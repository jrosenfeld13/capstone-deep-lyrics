# Team rituals and processes

Here we describe the team rituals and processes to efficiently build and improve this project. 

# Milestones 

We have 3 milestones for our Capstone. The first one is not graded, the other 2 are graded, with the last one being the final presentation. Milestones are 3 to 5 weeks long.

# Sprints

The milestones are divided into sprints. Each sprint lasts one week. This allows us to see where we are at each week and decide to make tactical changes. The sprint involves a series of rituals that help us drive progress and productivity. These need to be lightweight. 

## Standup: Tuesday, Friday, Sunday

Standups are the moment to say, in a few words, the following thing:

- What you did since the last standup
- What will be done by the last standup
- What is blocking you

Standup happens 3 times a week. Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays over slack, in written form. Simply fill in this template with your status:

- What I did: 
- What I'll get done:
- What I'm blocked on:

If we need to shift to more or less in-person standups, we can do that anytime. The process needs to make us more productive, not less.

## Sprint review: Tuesdays

Sprint review is the time to show off the cool stuff we did. Bring a 5 minute demo. 

## Retrospective: Tuesdays

We evaluate things that went well and things that we could improve in the process. Come to the meeting with at least one of each:

- What worked well this week?
- What can we improve next week?

## Planning: Tuesdays

On Tuesdays, we spend 30 minutes planning our next sprint. It is basically choosing which items from the backlog we will commit to do in the next week, and understanding whether other items need to be added.

## Tuesday timeline:

Tuesday sessions are divided into 3 sections:

- Sprint review: 20 mins
- Retrospective: 10 mins
- Planning: 30 mins

## Milestone planning

When a new milestone startes, we schedule a special planning meeting for the milestone, where we envision the success criteria and understand the work required.
