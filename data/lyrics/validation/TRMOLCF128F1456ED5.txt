I'm the picture of health
I'm called the evil one
We start a new religion
Now the fun's begun

Got the sex-beat from the Thunder T's
Got voodoo from our stars
We got a deadly weapon
We call it Bri's guitar

There's a method to my madness
It's something only time will tell
There's a method to my madness
Look inside my hell

When we got a message
They try and stop our song
Subliminal suggestions
You learned to play along

Once I lit a cigarette
They threw me in a cell
I think the hotel's burning
I hear those siren's yell

There's a method to my madness
It's something only time will tell
There's a method to my madness
Look inside my hell

Said we should be nice boys
Like all those other wimps
I talk about conspiracies
Then you crack the whip

"Well boy, you better shut your mouth
You can't afford to bail
Now don't go telling secrets
This record's gotta sell"

There's a method to my madness
It's something only time will tell
There's a method to my madness
Look inside my hell
