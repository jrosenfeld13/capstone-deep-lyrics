If I was having such a good time
It wasn't really that much fun
A counterfeit conspiracy
That's suddenly gone wrong

So come on, so come on
You're a luxury

A peculiar luxury
It always breaks my heart
You can keep your mystery
It doesn't mean a thing to me

Painted lips and L'Oreal
Are broadcast in the dark
A necessary cover up
That finally left its mark

So come on, so come on
You're a luxury

A peculiar luxury
It always breaks my heart
You can keep your mystery
It doesn't mean a thing to me

Your sneaky little schemes that show
The wolf's still at your door
A vicious little paragon
Of what you were before

So come on, so come on
You're a luxury
So come on, so come on
You're a luxury (stay away from me)
So come on, so come on
You're a luxury (stay away from me)
So come on, so come on
You're a luxury (stay away from me)
