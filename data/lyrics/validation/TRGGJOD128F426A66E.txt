Chorus:
Give me life, oh give me love
It's all I need, It's all I ask
I'll give you life, I'll give you love
That's what I need to feel like this

Love was meant to be
What you have been to me
Not just a runnin' free
What am I gonna do
To make my dreams come true?
You're all I need, I feel

Chorus:
Give me life, oh give me love
It's all I need, It's all I ask
And I'll give you life, I'll give you love
That's what I need to feel like this
