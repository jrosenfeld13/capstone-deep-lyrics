You are a moonchild and pretty soon child
I've got that feeling
That I'm gonna make you smile forever
If I can
Just give me a sign and I'll show you my plan
You are a blue child, forever true child
You know I'll try to paint the skies blue forever
If I can
Just give me a sign and I'll show you my plan
Tell me why you look so sad
Time slips by like grains of sand
Just put your future in my hands
You are a moonchild and pretty soon child
I've got the feelin I'm gonna make you smile forever
If I can
Just give me a sign and I'll show you my plan
Just give me a smile and I'll show you my plan
Just give me a sign and I'll show you my plan
