[Verse 1]
Honey, I love to go to parties
And I like to have a good time
But if it gets too pale after a while

[Chorus]
Honey and I start looking to find
One good man
Hmm, don't you know I've been searching
Oh yes, I have
One good man
Oh it isn't much, honey it isn't much
It's only everything, whoa

[Verse 2]
And I don't want much out of life
I never wanted a mansion in the South
I just want to find someone sincere
Who'd treat me like he talks

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Some girls they want to collect their men
They wear them like notches on a gun
Oh honey, but I know better than that

[Chorus]
