Sun's up
We wait all day
Sun's up
We wait all day, all day
The hell outside's kept away
If only we could move away
From here
This is how we build a place
An aviary for today
An aviary for today
Let's disappear till tomorrow
Let's disappear till tomorrow
Disappear, disappear, disappear
Blow up these play parades, let's go
To an aviary far from home
To an aviary far from home
A one hand clap is me and you
And you, and you, and you
While the hell outside's kept away
If only we moved away
Disappear, disappear, disappear
Last vacation was the same
We got moved away
Last vacation was the same
We got moved away
Last vacation was the same
We got moved away
Sun down now we have built our place
An aviary forever
An aviary forever
Forever, forever
Reappear, reappear, reappear, reappear
