Make this moment last
Forever and a day
Watching you drive by
Not letting you drive away

Pre Chorus
Can you see me ?
Can you see me?
Trying to wave you down tonight
'Cause I need to see you one more time

Chorus
You'll be there in my mind
In my dreams you can hide
And every night I'm gonna bring you back to life
They're in my mind
An angel bathed in light
Telling me everything's gonna be alright
If I can just fall asleep tonight

Lonely is the feeling
I can't comprehend
So I'm skipping to the last page
To see how this will end

Pre Chorus
Chorus

Have you ever felt so helpless
When the walls built to protect us
Suddenly are gone
And you hate everything that's breathing
The life you're used to cheating
Has finally caught on

Chorus
