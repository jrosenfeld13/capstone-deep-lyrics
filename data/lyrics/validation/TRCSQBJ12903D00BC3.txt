[Verse]
I was drunk as hell with a friend way back
Down by Scotts Addition off a mainline track
He said what was on his mind like Id never heard it

Then in come this train called the 170
I heard it air up then felt it pull
They say that rain on the face cuts when you deserve it

[Chorus]
And I sat and I thought
All that aint right is over for at least tonight
And if I die trying now I wont die wondering
How life could have turned out

[Verse]
Well, that train hauled ass and made good time
Down past Rocky Mount on that old seaboard line
My friend just slept and I sat there silent

I had some whiskey and some smokes and time to think it all out
It made sense this whole heading south
Sometimes its best to slow your pace when you cant control it

[Chorus]
And I sat and I thought
All that aint right is over for at least tonight
And if I die trying now I wont die wondering
How life could have turned out

[Verse]
Down in Jacksonville the train broke up
My legs were stiff I thought Id walk it off
My friend faced west and mentioned Pensacola

I did the truck stop deal and preyed on four wheels
Sat on my bag and heard a j-break scream
I saw my face in a window and I thought I know him

[Chorus]
And I sat and I thought
Although it aint right Im not heading home tonight
And if I die thinking right here, I wont die wondering
How life could have turned out
