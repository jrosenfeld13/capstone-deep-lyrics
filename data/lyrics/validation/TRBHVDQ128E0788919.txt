[Verse 1]
The world is a vampire, sent to drain
Secret destroyers hold you up to the flames
And what do I get for my pain?
Betrayed desires and a piece of the game

[Pre-Chorus]
Even though I know, I suppose I'll show
All my cool and cold like old Job

[Chorus]
Despite all my rage
I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage
I am still just a rat in a cage
Then someone will say
What is lost can never be saved
Despite all my rage
I am still just a rat in a cage

[Verse 2]
Now I'm naked, nothing but an animal
But can you fake it for just one more show?
And what do you want? I want to change
And what have you got when you feel the same?

[Pre-Chorus]
Even though I know, I suppose I'll show
All my cool and cold like old Job

[Chorus]
Despite all my rage
I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage
I am still just a rat in a cage
Then someone will say
What is lost can never be saved
Despite all my rage
I am still just a rat in a cage

[Middle Eight]
Tell me I'm the only one
Tell me there's no other one
Jesus was an only son, yeah
Tell me I'm the chosen one
Jesus was an only son, for you

[Bridge]
Despite all my rage
I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage
I am still just a rat in a cage
Then someone will say
What is lost can never be saved
Despite all my rage
I am still just a rat in a cage!

[Chorus]
Despite all my rage
I am still just a rat in a
Despite all my rage
I am still just a rat in a
Despite all my rage
I am still just a rat in a cage

Tell me I'm the only one
Tell me there's no other one
Jesus was an only son, for you

[Outro]
And I still believe that I can not be saved
And I still believe that I can not be saved
And I still believe that I can not be saved
And I still believe that I can not be saved
