Welcome to the world of love and laughter baby
Welcome to the sunshine of a brand new day
You drifted on to the sea, you flowed in to a dream
A dream that never will fade away

Living in the world of love and laughter baby
We can find the secret tool of constant smile
The music no one can hear, will sound for us loud and clear
You find forever it takes a while

It's time to give our love a chance
The music is going, shall we dance

Welcome to the world of love and laughter baby
Welcome to the sunshine of a brand new day
You drifted on to the sea, you flowed in to a dream
A dream that never will fade away

Welcome to the world of love and laughter baby
Everywhere is a world of love and laughter baby
