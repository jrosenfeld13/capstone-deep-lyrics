Everybody loves stars
Everyone fell
Into her world
She made here

Where everybody rates love
But I don't care
'Cause it's her world
She made me

You think you're half as good as me
The only thing you'll ever be
Is just a way for me to bleed
On this stage

Everybody loves stars
Everyone fell
Into her world
She made here

Where innocence is taken
But I don't care
'Cause it's her world
She made me

You think you're half as good as me
The only thing you'll ever be
Is just a way for me to bleed
On this stage

Now she's old
She's been blessed
Take a bow
And confess

She threw it all away
My angel died that day
No one came
No one cared

You think you're half as good as me
The only thing you'll ever be
Is just a way for me to bleed
On this stage
