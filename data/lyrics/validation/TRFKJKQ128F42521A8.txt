[Verse 1]
Simple souls overload as i explode data banks
Cuz the earth & space gave birth to this paleface

Supreme -- linguistic -- mental machine
My brain cells swell - the intellects extreme

Fire fills my veins as i proclaim my resistance
To the mind-swapping parasites that feed off my existence

As i -- skin the burn to relearn the royal plan
Out beyond the edges in the depths of spirit land

Its authentic, apocalyptic destroyer
Damaging challengers -- resurrection, disorder

A monument of crisis - i strikes this - your dead
Line my nest with your soul -- cleansed in bloodshed

[Chorus]
BATTLE READY!
Poets gonna take control

BATTLE READY
Souls violate parole

BATTLE READY
Violently invade your home

-- breaking the bones
OF THOSE WHO POSE


[Verse 2]
Commanding the mic -- striking up a verb-fest
Mass destruction is my function - time to put it to the test

In combat --- attacking since way back
In the days i drew praise for the way that i slayed facts

Formulating flows in revolutionary science
Its the catastrophic prophet from the anarchist alliance

Freaking techniques -- this creature of speech
We feel the fury of devastation cuz we tasted defeat

I'm alone on my throne in this universe of fear
Royalty divides my soul -- in this role i'm revered

As the pinnacle -- lyrical master -- queen of disaster
I ruin brain fluid -- the UNKNOWN IS WHAT I'M AFTER

[Chorus]
BATTLE READY!


BATTLE READY

-- breaking the bones
OF THOSE WHO POSE

BATTLE READY!
Poets gonna take control

BATTLE READY
Souls violate parole

BATTLE READY
Violently invade your home

-- breaking the bones
OF THOSE WHO POSE

[Verse 3]
Shaking up the world -- just like the 2nd coming of christ
-- when i write -- thrice divine with this goddess sight

Words will flow -- wounds will grow
Ewe know -- bones will be exposed from the force that i unload

Its THE SOUL EATER!! -- mic bleeder with the voice of chaos
I got the nectar of the gods flowing from my mental pod

Gather the flock -- alarm your block
Tell them the shepherds have come & got the keys to unlock

A holy war -- thru your veins it courses
More lyrical artillery than the armed forces

Supernatural -- styles be volatile
Its the mind manipulator -- the WAR CHILD

[Chorus]

BATTLE READY!
Poets gonna take control

BATTLE READY
Souls violate parole

BATTLE READY
Violently invade your home

-- breaking the bones
OF THOSE WHO POSE

[Bridge]
COME!
SHADOW SOLDIERS!

We came to defy - living life as a lie
We embryonic satellites need our freedom to fly

TO WATCH YOU DIE! -- agonizing cries are heard in stereo
I'm visualizing battlefield scenarios

In the line of fire -- watching empires fall
Into attack position -- ELIMINATE ALL!!!

MY SPECIES!!!

[Chorus]
BATTLE READY!


BATTLE READY

BATTLE READY

-- breaking the bones
OF THOSE WHO POSE

BATTLE READY!
Poets gonna take control

BATTLE READY
Souls violate parole

BATTLE READY
Violently invade your home

-- breaking the bones
OF THOSE WHO POSE

[Outro]
MY SPECIES!
MY SPECIES!
NO SURRENDER!
NO SURRENDER!
