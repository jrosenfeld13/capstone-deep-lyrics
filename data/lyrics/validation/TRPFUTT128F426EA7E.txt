Hopelessly a man starts to feed your day
Once he was there you never looked back
How did you think that his words might just fade away
He seemed harmless enough so you let him in and now you'll pay

I can't see him but he's stalking my thoughts
How does it feel when you can't concentrate?
I just stare
All of your daydreams are a seesaw for him to play on

How does it feel when he calls your name
You can plug your ears but it's not the same
How do you know when he pulls you back

Nobody's wrong, nobody's right, the Birdman wouldn't lie
Nobody's wrong, nobody's right, but I just can't trust him tonight

How do you forget a stranger that plagues your days
We arm ourselves when there's nothing to fear
Right? Wrong

How does it feel when he comes to pass, there's something there
But it's not quite right
How does it feel, does it make you mad?
Oh it makes you mad, mad mad mad

Get it on, get it on, get it on, get it on
Nobodys wrong, nobodys right, the birdman wouldn't lie
Nobodys wrong, nobodys right, its all on the other side

I feel him
I feel him close
I feel him
I feel him

But how do we find
Nobodys wrong, nobodys right, the birdman wouldn't lie
Nobodys wrong, nobodys right, people, all you people and

Get it on, get it on, get it on, get it on, get it on
Get it on and on and on
Get it on, get it on, get it on, get it on, get it on
Get it on

I feel him close
I feel him
