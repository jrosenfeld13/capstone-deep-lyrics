Your love will never fade even when we fail
In You we find strength for You're our shelter
We refuse to fall
This is our battle cry can we make it last until our last breath
I know that You'll remain the same today and forever
Will there ever be strength to stand for the call in my heart
With every passing moment I pray I'm ready
Now that our time is near we hold our own until the end
Fight with every breath without doubt and don't look back
We fight for the Truth
We fight for the Truth
We hold true and battle on
Put yourself to the test
Fight through your strong holds until there is nothing left
