[Verse 1]
There's a train leaving here tomorrow
And I'll be a free man once again
I'm so glad I served my time
I'm going to meet the girl that I left behind

[Chorus]
And when I see her
I'm going to give her all the love I've got
When I see her
I'm going to give her all the love I've got

[Verse 2]
There were times
When each day seemed like a year
But the sweet things she said in the letters
Made the time just disappear
She said no other arms will I let hold me
Because in your arms is where I want to be

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Baby, oh baby, my little darling
I'm coming home

[Verse 3]
The nights I've stared out my window at the moonlight
Thinking about the way I used to hold her tight
I must have been out of my mind to do the wrong I did
And leave her behind

[Chorus]
