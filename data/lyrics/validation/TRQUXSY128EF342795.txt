Here's a little story that I really want to tell
It's about Bo Diddley at the O. K Corral
Now, Bo Diddley didn't start no mess
He had a gun on his hip and a rose on his vest

'Cause Bo Diddley's a gunslinger
(Bo Diddley's a gunslinger)

Bo Diddley buys him a diamond ring
If that diamond ring don't shine
He better take it to a private eye
If that private eye can't see
Well, he better bring that ring to me

I said, "Yeah, Bo Diddley, yeah"
(Yeah, Bo Diddley, yeah)
"Yeah, Bo Diddley, huh"
(Yeah, Bo Diddley, hey, yeah, etc.)

I said, "Why'd ya come to my house
On Black Jack Road
Take my baby away from home
Where'd you go or where you been
Up your house and gone again

I said, "Bo Diddley, Bo Diddley
Have you heard?
(Hey, Bo Diddley)

She was a bird"
