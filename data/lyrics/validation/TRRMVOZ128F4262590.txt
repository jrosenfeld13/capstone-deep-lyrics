I'm bleeding misery
Oh, eternal discontent- how consistent
The only thing stable in my life is how I try...
To still this beating mind, so that I can finally rest
The essence of my character is that I'm unable to be without worrying
The words of dead humans seem so, so much more sincere than
The half-signed contracts that tend to occupy the open air
Still this beating mind, so that I can finally rest
The essence of my character is that I'm unable to be without worrying
