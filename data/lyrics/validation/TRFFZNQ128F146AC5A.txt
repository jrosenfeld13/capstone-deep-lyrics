Strange does it seem to me now
But I once loved that girl
Though she tore out the heart of me
I loved to see her smile
And look into her eyes
Though they told that
She hated the sight of me

She was the way
That the love died inside of me
It died inside of me

Oh and I'll never feel again
Oh no I'll never feel again

Holy, holy, lowly, lowly
Lowly, lowly, low
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely, lonely, low

Since the love died inside of me
