My mother nature and my father time
See their son run across that line
It's his fortieth final try

Charging forward now in heat
Then the awkward retreat
To his lonely stockade
To his imaginary maid
She's sweeping down the plain
She's under his reign

Like a rough wind howling through Oklahoma
It's a cold wind down in Oklahoma

He's been hurt once - and he's hurt one twice
And all the pain is still labeled "inside"
He's sorting it out inside

But now his voice no longer speaks
When the truth begins to leak
To the heavily love-laden mercenary maiden
But deep within their spark
His hidden orders bark

Like a rough wind howling through Oklahoma
It's a cold wind down in Oklahoma

My mother nature and my father time
See their son run across that line
It's his fortieth final try
It's his final try

Like a rough wind howling through Oklahoma
It's a cold wind down in Oklahoma
