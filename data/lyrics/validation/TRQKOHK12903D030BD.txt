Song Name: Directors Cut
Here we go, we're at scene one
The camera rolls
At the bottom of this building
We pull open, the door and dive right in
Each door we open
Brings an argument
The stairs shine, shine light
We spiral, spiral up them
No words spoke, spoken
We lose con-control
This feeling inside
Building for a long time
It's unbearable, are we capable
This feeling inside
Building for a long time
It's unbearable, are we capable
The top floor signifies it is time
As the final scene is captured
Out onto this picturesque skyline
The camera pans around
We fall to the floor, to the floor
This feeling inside
Building for a long time
It's unbearable, are we capable
This feeling inside
Building for a long time
It's unbearable, are we capable
This feeling inside (echo)
The camera is still rolling
At the end of the month, the minutes count down
A sudden stab in the stomach
Brings a happy twist
Blood is she'd for the good of us
This feeling inside
Building for a long time
It's unbearable, are we capable
This feeling inside
Building for a long time
It's unbearable, are we capable
This feeling inside
Building for a long time
It's unbearable, are we capable
This feeling inside, building for a long time
