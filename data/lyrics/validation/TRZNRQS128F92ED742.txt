[Verse 1]
I'll take you just the way you are
Imperfect words inside the perfect song

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel you closer than you are
But I've been waiting far too long
Too long

[Chorus]
It's my declaration
To anyone who's listening
You're my inspiration
As I stand alone against the world
'Cause you love
And you bleed
And you stole my soul to set me free
It's my declaration

[Verse 2]
Do you care what I believe? ('cause I'm still breathing)
Or that I wear your heart upon my sleeve?

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I think you never knew
The only truth I see is you
It's you

[Chorus]
It's my declaration
To anyone who's listening
You're my inspiration
As I stand alone against the world
'Cause you love
And you bleed
And you stole my soul to set me free
It's my declaration

[Bridge]
And are there any words to say
That would ever mean enough?
When the light runs from the day
Will the darkness be too much?
Will I ever be enough?

[Chorus]
It's my declaration
To anyone who's listening
You're my inspiration
As I stand alone against the world
'Cause you love
And you bleed
And you stole my soul to set me free
It's my declaration
So tell me can you hear these words tonight
It's my declaration
