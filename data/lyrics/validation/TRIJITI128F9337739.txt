Don't trust them as far as you can throw 'em
Because as strong as you may be, you won't be able to move them an inch
But you don't have to believe me go ahead and
Be the corporate stooge that they trained you to be
And then you'll see what you get for your loyalty

They call it "downsizing", but that's just a backhanded saying
For the phrase "We're gonna screw you until you're down on your knees."
And you better not try to complain
'Cause there's another hundred stiffs like you
All who'd plead "I'd kiss your ass just for a chance to be a whore to your company."

You see it every day, everywhere, on the TV screen
Each time a different face or family, but it's always the same
"We worked here all our lives
Gave them everything we had
And now they say they're gonna move the factory
To a third world country where the labor is cheap."

But the fact, my friend, that you don't see
Is the money you spend on the goods they make
Supports their methods of abuse on the third world scene
And in your very own backyard, yes your country

So I won't be the consumer that they want me to be
Because the goods I own, aren't going to set me free
So I won't buy that crap, they want to sell me
Because the goods I own, won't set anyone free
