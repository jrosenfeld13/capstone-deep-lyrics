Whisper like a summer breeze
All the secrets secrets keep
Scrimping like you skimmed your knees
You told them what they wanted to hear

Talk and talk and nothing please
In hours we build towers, we need
All the space that you can free
In hours we build towers we need

[?]
All across the country
Underneath the soil and trees
Footsteps shaking all of the ground
Shallow speak and little seeds
Carrying a message for me
Down below is where we'll be
Down below is where we'll be
