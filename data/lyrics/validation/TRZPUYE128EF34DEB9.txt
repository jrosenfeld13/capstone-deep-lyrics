Mmm, hmm

Every since you went away
I ain't been doing nothing but
(Thinking, thinking)
(Thinking, thinking)
With my head in my hands
(Thinking)

You been away from so long
And I just don't think I can carry on so I start
(Drinking, drinking)
(Drinking, drinking)
Each and every night
(Drinking)

(Ah, ah, ah)
Trying to drown all my loneliness away
I don't forget a day
Fall down on my knees wishing for your return
And oh, how I hurt

'Cause I
(Oh, I)
Oh, I
(Oh, I)
(Miss you)

(Miss you)
(Miss you, miss you)
Oh, Lord
(Miss you)

You can look at my eyes and see
That a great big man like me has been
(Crying, crying)
(Crying, crying)
Crying my heart and soul out to you, baby
(Crying)

Sitting in my lonely room
Filled with nothing but gloom and I feel like
(Dying, dying)
(Dying, dying)
Hey, y'all help me
(Dying)

(Ah, ah, ah)
'Cause ever since the day you left
I don't know what to do with myself
Oh, I wish for your return
And oh, how I hurt

'Cause I
(Oh, I)
Oh, I
(Oh, I)

(Oh, I)
Oh, I
(Oh, I)
I miss you, baby
(Miss you, miss you)

I miss you, baby, I miss you, baby
(Miss you, miss you, miss you)
Without you I don't know what to do with myself
What to do with my time

Hmm, hello, did I disturb you
I didn't mean to take up too much of your time
But just thought I'd give you a ring
And see how you was doing
How's, how's everything?

A friend of mine told me he saw you the other day
Said you was still looking good
Heh, made me feel kind of good, you know
Told me, told me that you did ask about me

Heh, I been really meaning to try
To get to talk to you for now
But you know how a man's pride is
Sometimes it kind of won't let him do
What he wanna do

(Oh, I)
Yeah, baby
(Oh, I)
Come back to me, darling
(Miss you, miss you)
(Miss you, miss you)

(Miss you, miss you)
I don't want nobody else, hey, hey, baby
(Miss you)
(Oh, I, oh, I)
Hey, baby

(Miss you, miss you)
I miss you, baby
(Miss you, miss you, miss you)
I miss you, baby
I don't know what to do with my time
With myself, without you, baby

Hmm, guess what
I know this will knock you dead but
I even went out and got a gig
Oh, forgot you know hip to the hip talk

Plain J-O-B, baby
In eight hours a day, all the overtime I can get
I don't know, I guess it might be too late but
I swear I miss you

(Oh, I, oh, I)
Yeah, Lord knows
(Miss you, miss you)
(Miss you)
Don't do me like this, baby
(Miss you, miss you)

Yeah, I'm on my knees, I'm begging you please
(Oh, I, oh, I)
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, I miss you, baby
(Miss you, miss you)
(Miss you)

Oh, Lord
(Miss you, miss you)
Hey, girl, hey, girl
Hey, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
(Oh, I, Oh, I)

I can't go on without you, baby
(Miss you, miss you)
(Miss you, miss you, miss you)
What am I gonna do? What can I say?
I love you, baby, ha

Heh, remember how I used to always say
How lucky I done been
You know being they got that lottery
I hit it, I'd like to kind of make up
For a lot of things that just seemed not to go right

Don't want you to think I'm trying
To buy back your love or your friendship
But now I feel I got a chance to kind
Of make things up to you a little bit

Heh, enough about you and me
How's my little son?
Hmm, he ever ask about me?
Just a little bit

Does he still like to go down by the supermarket?
If I could just, if I could just see you
Can't really say what you mean
Or what you want over the phone

I swear I miss you
You done heard it ten times or more but
I swear I done changed
I swear I done changed

(Oh, I, oh, I)
I miss you, baby
(Miss you, miss you)
(Miss you, miss you)
(Oh, Lord)

Miss you, baby, yeah, baby
Yeah, baby, yeah, baby
(Oh, I, oh, I)
(Miss you, miss you)
(Miss you, miss you, miss you, baby)
