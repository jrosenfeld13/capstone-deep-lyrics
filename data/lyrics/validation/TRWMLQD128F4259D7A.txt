Sitting here, my minds an empty page
But I'll try, yes I will to exist
A funky guitar, liberates me from my cage
Well you asked so I say, that's how songs are made

Where do I go when I need some inspiration
Love affair, jump a cliff, light a spliff
Simply vibe, with some wicked orchestration
Well you asked so I say, that's how songs are made

Oh, searching in the back of my mind
Try to sleep, see if I dream
See if something comes from nowhere
Oh oh. Search again theres something I can find
Try to sleep, see if I dream
If I let it go, it comes back to me
U res your head to lay
If you love it so. It comes back to you
Back to you. Back to you

What do I do, for a little motivation
On a beach, out of reach, ooh life's a peach
Sometimes I need just a little isolation
On my own, answerphone, toblerone, ummmmm

A little dedication, a little isolation, yeah
A little motivation, give me some information. Yeah
In the middle of the day. When you res your head to lay
