Warm nights in the city
Someone's playing Latin in the park
Street lights shining pretty
Shadows on the lovers in the dark
It's the reason for the getaway
Lay upon the roof and just forget about the day

Chorus:
Back in the city
Everybody moves to a different beat in the city
See the motion
Feel the heat of the city
Something's happening in the streets of the city

Cool breeze on the river
Making you aware that youre alive
Bodies start to shiver
Passions start to shift to overdrive

Picture feelings that you can't control
Elementary voices
Calling deep inside your soul

Chorus

(Instrumental break)

Chorus repeats out
