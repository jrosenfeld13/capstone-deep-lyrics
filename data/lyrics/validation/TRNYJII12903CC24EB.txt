First you give
FIRST YOU GIVE
Then you take, just like the turning of the tides
I will rise... HIGH TIDE rise and find good things and bring them within reach
Bring me good fortune; reward my good deeds
Then as the tide recedes, you steal a piece of me
This neverending cycle constantly CREATES ME
This cycle; it will NEVER END
Bring me love, take it away, just like the turning OF THE TIDES
Pick me up, then bring me down, just like the turning OF THE TIDES
Bring me hope, then hopelessness, just like the turning of the tides...
Learning to adjust my expectations, because I know that the TIDE WILL TURN
Strickened by this persistence, but I know that the TIDE WILL TURN
Preying on my existence, but I know that the TIDE WILL TURN
(High tide) Rise and bring me... BRING ME PEACE
Bring me everything and bring it within reach
LOW TIDE take everything... STEAL FROM ME
Steal all good fortune and leave me in defeat
Rise... AND BRING ME PEACE (2x)
Neverending cycle of life repeats
Tides keep turning... Why can't you leave me be? Give to me, then take from me
I know that the tide WILL TURN
Bring me life, then bring me death
I know that the tide WILL TURN
