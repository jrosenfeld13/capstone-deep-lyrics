[Verse 1]
They sit around tables rendered dumb
Colored sticks of chalk are passed around
Today the doctors allow the illusion of choice
Tomorrow the necks split, there is no voice

[Chorus]
Piggy
V.S.E.C
Cleaning cooking flower arranging
Dissolves a kind of liberation

[Verse 2]
Draw a perfect circle, sleep fetus-like
Six chalk colors, the very meaning of life
They wake to strobes and half circled light
Confusion lifts with potassium percolate

[Chorus]
Piggy
V.S.E.C
Cleaning cooking flower arranging
Dissolves a kind of liberation
Pig pig piggy
V.S.E.C
Cleaning cooking flower arranging
Dissolves a kind of liberation
Pig pig piggy
V.S.E.C
Cleaning cooking flower arranging
Dissolves a kind of liberation
