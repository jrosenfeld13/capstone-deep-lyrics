Born in the night when darkness has covered the sky
Eye for an eye, the code on the street to survive
Wielding the axe, the metal is forged in the fire
Burning inside, the music is always the driver

Time to take our place
Conquer one by one
We shall overcome

We will Rock the Earth, Praise You Lord, we must be heard
We will Rule the World, carry on, the metal flame

Thirst for the kill, displaying the passion and fury
Taking by storm, slay them with power and courage

Time to take our place
Conquer one by one
We shall overcome

We will Rock the Earth, Praise You Lord, we must be heard
We will Rule the World, Carry on, the metal flame

Time to take our place
Conquer one by one
We shall overcome

We will Rock the Earth, Praise You Lord, we must be heard
We will Rule the World, Carry on, the metal flame
