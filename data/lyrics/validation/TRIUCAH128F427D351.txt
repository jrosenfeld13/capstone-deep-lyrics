Listen to the lock, listen to the lock
Brandish apart
Culture in a thought, intricately wrought
Now let's see what you got
I Lord yeah, I Lord yeah
To invoke again
Upon Jah I lean, sir
Take away the cringe

In the sea nets are cast for most
Still don't stop, no don't stop
Hyper spots and their likes with them
Stay away from our crops

Listen to your heart, listen to your heart
What have you bought?
Open up your pot, dem guy now fe stop
Recognize silent tears
Let the children of Zion
Be joyful in their king
Bring I soul out of prison
That I may praise thy name

In the sea nets are cast for most
Still don't stop, no don't stop
Hyper spots and their likes with them
Stay away from our crops

Recognize dem silent tears
Recognize dem silent tears

Listen to the lock, listen to the lock
Brandish apart
Culture in a thought, intricately wrought
Now let's see what you got
I Lord yeah, I Lord yeah
To invoke again
Upon Jah I lean, Sir
Take away the cringe

In the sea nets are cast for most
Still don't stop, no don't stop
Hyper spots and their likes with them
Stay away from our crops
