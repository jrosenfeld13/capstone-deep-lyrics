[Mr. Lil One]
Where's my G's at sippin Mickey's and wearing Dickies
Throwin up your set with a neck full of hickies
No I'm not Ricky but I live la vida loca
Buckin down you socas that be talkin out your bocas
Mota for the smokers, coka for the nose
Peace to all my niggas that be talkin shit to hoes
Clothes always creased screamin out fuck peace
Nigga I'm from the streets where the devil never sleeps
Deep into the bangin started slangin tryin to make it
Run up on my shit, you got to murder me to take it
Never tried to fake, tried to make it the way I can
Cause man made the money, money never made the man
Listen to the whistle, keep your fingers on the pistol
Fuckin wit that crystal makes a mothafucka dismissed
Every thing you love, and every thing done
Don't mean a fuckin thing when a mothafuckas sprung

[Chorus]
Leave it alone you're fuckin up holmes
You're doin em wrong, You're doin em wrong
You're doin em wrong, for all the wrong reasons
You got a Karma with all the four seasons
[2x]

[Mr. Lil One]
Any ways, just another day but I'm livin
Givin it all I got for my mothafuckin Tot
Hustlin my shit makin sure it's in your spot
Bumpin down your block hear it every where you walk
Hocus Pokus I was faded when I wrote this
PCP smokers bangin who the lokest
Bury you, I'm darin you, see if I put scare in you
No air in you, left, when I done leave you hung
Tattos and hair nets, youngsters and vets
Throwin up their sets screamin out fucked the rest
Let the dogs loose, gettin faded off the juice
I'm fightin to get rich while you're fightin over a bitch
Mothafuck you both, I'm stickin to my oath
Terrorfy you bitches when you hear about my riches
It's not about my salary it's all about reality
I'm tryin to feed my family so why fuck you mad at me

[Chorus]

[Mr. Lil One(Talkin)]
Yeah, this is to all you back stabbing bitches
All you two faced hipocrits
You mothafuckin haters out there
You know who you are
You got some karma for that ass
Karma for all the four seasons
Gone
