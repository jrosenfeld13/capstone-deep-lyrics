Drink, s**, Cigarettes
Ford Cortina household pets
Bombs? War? Famine? Death?
An apathetic public couldn t care less

The Public watches itv
Reads The Sun drinks cups of tea
Two-star family stay content
Their lives controlled by parliament
Well daddy's lost his job again
Because he never had no brain
He only lives to watch tv
His life controlled by apathy

The Russians seem so far away
The government seems to be ok
The papers never mention war
Cos the people that they cater for have got:

The things that you never knew were there
Or was it that you didn't care
The biggest problem face to face
An apathetic human race
