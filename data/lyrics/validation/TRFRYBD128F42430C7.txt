[Verse 1]
But you were always one to stay the same, girl
I know you want to be the rain
And I know that we would fall in there
For a time and then unfall again
For a while, I'll take you burying old bones
Dawn's grey, the sign in the winter light
And I know that you can feel the pain
Your eyes speak one hundred million lies

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't tell me you've gone astray
I walk in circles
I've seen million things that tell me so

[Verse 2]
But I was one to play the fool, girl
Though rules were somewhat dark to me
And I know that we could fall in there
For a time and then unfall again
For a while, I give you darium bound stones
Grow through the roots of your mind set apart
And I know that you can feel the pain
Your eyes speak one hundred million lies

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't tell me you've gone astray
I walk in circles
I've seen million things that tell me so

[Chorus]
Total anxiety, pay for variety
Oh, we'll wait for time to turn around
Turn around your faith
We'll wait for time to turn

[Bridge]
The world we sold, there was a choir there
The world we sold, there was a choir there
Disgrace for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't tell me you've gone astray
I talk in circles
Everlasting chains that bind my purpose
Only I've seen million things that tell me so

[Chorus]
Total anxiety, pay for variety
Oh, we'll wait for time to turn around
Turn around your faith
We'll wait for time to...
Choked on society, laced with cyanide
Oh, we'll wait for time to turn around
Turn around your faith
We'll wait for time to turn
