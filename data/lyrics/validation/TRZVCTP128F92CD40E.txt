Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything starting to hum
Still it's a real good bet the best is yet to come

The best is yet to come, and babe won't it be fine?
You think you've seen the sun but you ain't seen it shine

Wait till the warm up's underway
Wait till our lips have met
Wait till you see that sunshine day, ain't nothing like it yet

The best is yet to come, and babe won't it be fine?
The best is yet to come, come the day your mine
Come the day your mine

I'm gonna teach you to fly, we've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drink that cup dry
Wait till your charms are ripe for these arms to surround

You think you've flown before but you ain't left the ground
Wait till you're locked in my embrace, wait till I draw you near
Wait till you've seen that sunshine place, ain't nothing like it here

The best is yet to come, and babe won't it be fine?
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine, come the day you're mine
The best is yet to come, and babe won't it be fine?
