For all time
We said we'd be
Lovers for all time
And eternity

Words we try to keep
Then leave behind
When we can't find the thought
We thought we'd be lovers for all time

For all time
I heard you say
We'd be friends forever
Not less a day

And we swore it in
Our blood
But it turned to mud
And now we call it child's play

For all time
I thought I'd be
The baby
In my family

But I know now
They can't possibly
Take care of me
For all time

For all time
I was sure
That you would be mine
Forever more

But foolish me
Fallin' for tricks
I've seen before
I thought we'd be lovers for all time

So if not
For all time
That I can tempt you
With my charms

Then baby
In the meantime
I will hold you
In my arms
