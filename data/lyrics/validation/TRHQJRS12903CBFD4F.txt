No Water:
No water can quench my thirst
I'm in bed send me a nurse
I'm thirsty thirsty Lord o' Mercy
Ooh we - other[?] the bottle, sweeter the victory
I've got your love, the power of your glory
Aah, Ooh yeah, trillin me, allright
Can't judge a mother by the [?] of the father
Can't judge a book by the [?] on the cover Read me read me baby

No water can quench my thirst
I'm in bed, need a nurse
Can you understand
Do you understand me baby

I've got a bottle, sweet the victory
I've got your love, the power of your glory
Aah, Ooh we, allright
You've got your love and I've got mine
Can't you [?],they work fine Do you believe me, baby, get it up baby
Break it back, turn it loose
What in heaven baby it got to choose
