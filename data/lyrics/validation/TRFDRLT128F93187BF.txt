Listen man, you really need to think about what you're doing here*...
Can't you See?
This Mona Lisa's taking you for a ride
La la la la la la la la la la
Well you came girl, but you gotta go
I just decided
Rockin' with the next man while I'm out the door, you need to roll
I just decided
Forgive and Forget? You wasn't straight with me
With me
So Close I could not breathe
Girl I can't breathe
Now I see you with skis
Pack your things and Leave
I just decided, I just Decided
Oh!
I know you don't wanna but you gotta man
Feeling like a stick in the mud, cos you ain't got a plan
Now she wanna stay witchu but she gotta friend
Man, Look to that chick, that she gotta scram
But Why?
Tell her you just decided
(I just decided)
Well you came girl, but you gotta go
I just decided
Rockin' with the next man while I'm out the door, you need to roll
I just decided
Forgive and Forget? You wasn't straight with me
With me
So Close I could not breathe
Girl I can't breathe
Now I see you with skis
Pack your things and Leave
I just decided, I just Decided
Yeah
You say girl explain yourself, but she ain't got no answer
(Yeah that's pretty typical, man)
Acting up, playing the fool, cos she don't want you to find her
(Find her OUT)
She's a Liar (she's a liar)
And a cheat (and a cheat)
Ringing on the phone while you sleep
Listen to your buddy, when I'm just tryna educate ya
(Hello, I'm really tryna get here on this thing here man
I think we need to try a little public chant thing, because it'll work.)
(Repeat After Me.)
She gotta go
(She gotta go)
She gotta Go
(She gotta go)
Man she lying to your face, don't you know?
Chillin' at your pad, eatin' out your fridge
Say you need to pay some rent
And she ain't got it
Man she wrong
(Man She Wrong)
Man she Wrong
(Man she Wrong)
Don't get me wrong, I know she look good in that thong
She ain't nothing but trouble man, you need to switch
Got you lookin' like a fam
Taking care of them kids
Now come on
She don't really care about you and how you feel
Look I know you not really hearin' me
But I'm just tryna keep it real
Wit cha
Messing with your feelings ain't a joke
Yes she fly, but she's also a
HOE!
Just follow my lead
Point to the door
And repeat after me
Cos she gotta go
Well you came girl, but you gotta go
I just decided
Rockin' with the next man while I'm out the door, you need to roll
I just decided
Forgive and Forget? You wasn't straight with me
With me
So Close I could not breathe
Girl I can't breathe
Now I see you with skis
Pack your things and Leave
I just decided, I just Decided
Yeah
Was that so hard?
You need to rock the house now she's gone
Thank God
I'm Proud of you man
(La la la la la la la la la)
I'm Proud of you man
(La la la la la)
A glorious day
Observin she's a fake and a fry is the way
She's runnin' for Ice Queen
No shit
I really think we need to go out and celebrate:
You did a good job there
For a second I thought you were a goner
Here's your balls back...
Aha!
La la la la la la
