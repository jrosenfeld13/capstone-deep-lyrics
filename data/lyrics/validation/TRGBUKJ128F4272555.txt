[Verse 1]
House is haunted
I just want to go for a ride
Out and on
Before I set this room alight
Left alone
Forever, and for crimes unclear
With my patience gone
Someone take me far from here

[Chorus]
Yeah, burning that gasoline
Yeah, burning that gasoline

[Verse 2]
New day yawning
Another day of solitaire
House is honest
Clearly more than I can bear
Drag me off
Before I set my world on fire
Out and gone
The sun will never set tonight

[Chorus]
Yeah, burning that gasoline
Yeah, burning that gasoline

[Bridge]
No "What fors"
Only a can of red
It says danger on it
I have found another way

[Chorus]
Burning that gasoline
Yeah, burning that gasoline

[Outro]
Burning it all the way
Burning it all the way
