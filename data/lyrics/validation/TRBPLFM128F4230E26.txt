I am the god of 42nd street.You may not love me but I'm hard to beat
I am the lord of all you see and feel.You may not want me but I'm oh so real
You cannot feel me when the light is on so come the darkness. I won't be very long

Close your eyes my darling and you'll find the light
Close your eyes my friend and they'll be no fright
Close your eyes my darling and you'll find the way

All the fire and all the hate won't change the feelings, won't change your fate
So stop your crying and feed my faith. I'll kill your god and take his place
Kill the leaches in your little dream. The bloods not spilling. It's not what it seems
Hey, have you ever walked beneath the rain in hope of washing away the pain and all your tears?
Hey, have you ever talked of all the shame within your everlasting fear of me?
