What are you really after?
What are you hoping to gain?
If nothing has ever pleased you
What makes you think you've changed?
You're running in circles, darling
From bed back to bed
Tell me what you're really after
Then, baby, just rest your head

Who are you really after?
Who are you trying to find?
Who is that certain someone
That's kept you awake all those nights?
You think it's just puzzle pieces
But they never fit right
If you can't see who you're really after
Then, baby, you're blind

Why are you always searching?
Why are you always undone?
You lurk in the darkest corners
Awaiting some heavenly ascension
You know you won't find it in liquor
Or that stuff your friend does
But c'mon, we've all had our stumbles
And some nights it almost feels like love
It feels like love
Now, now, now
It feels like love

So what are you really after?
Who are you trying to find?
Why are you so hard on yourself?
It's only life, and its only tonight
I'll pick up a six-pack at last call
We'll stay up drinking in bed
You could tell me what you're really after
Then, baby, just rest your head
Just rest your head
Now, now, now
Just rest your head
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, just rest your head
Just rest your head
Just rest your head
