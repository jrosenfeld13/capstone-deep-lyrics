They wanna kill, the mercenary comes to you
Now you have to, you really have to run away

Running, running away ! Fleeing, fleeing fastly !

They are cruel, get money to kill you
Their commanders are satisfied if you die

Mercenary - be careful !
Mercenary - careful !
Carefully, carefully, the mercenary, the mercenary

They are happy, when they got much money now
All the people afraid of their cruelty

Running, running away ! Fleeing, fleeing fastly !

In a hard fight many bombs are falling down
You are dying, the punishment is right oh yeah

Mercenary - be careful !
Mercenary - careful !
Carefully, carefully, the mercenary, the mercenary

They wanna kill, the mercenary comes to you
Now you have to, you really have to run away

Running, running away ! Fleeing, fleeing fastly !

They are cruel, get money to kill you
Their commanders are satisfied if you die

Mercenary - be careful !
Mercenary - careful !
Carefully, carefully, the mercenary, the mercenary

Mercenary - be careful !
Mercenary - careful !
Carefully, carefully, the mercenary, the mercenary
