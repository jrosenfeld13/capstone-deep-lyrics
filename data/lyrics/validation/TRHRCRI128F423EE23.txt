Take a stab for the waiting crowd
This time we fold, as the future draws your name

So stay away, when you go away
Now that its void
Calling the drop of a sure dime
Standing ground for the vain in the meantime
Run
Run from me now before this has the chance to be something more
This is the way for you
This is the way. This is the way

We're not a fan of the social part
The urban silence in the cage of sanity
I'm trying hard to let you go
And fighting not to let you know

Surround me
As the future draws your name
This time we fold
And it draws the line

Standing ground for the vain in the meantime
Run
Run from me now before this has the chance to be something more
This is the way for you
This is the way. This is the way

Im trying hard to let you go
And fighting not to let you know
(4x)

They're calling your name
You're there, so don't turn away

Standing ground for the vain in the meantime
Run
Run from me now before this has the chance to be something more
This is the way for you
This is the way. This is the way. (x2)
This is the way for you
This is the way. This is the way
