You're going to want to hear this
Simple thoughts from my head
Little like a box of pictures
Not what they are, just what you said
Take a look, don't decieve me
Our time together drained the life from me
Only thing I ask of you now
Take a step and push away
You step on me
You take from me
You lean on me
Why don't you push away

You step on me
You take from me
You lean on me
Why don't you push away

I hope you got what you wanted
Cost me everything I am
Your stare burns right through me
Timelessness was your demand

Take a look, don't decieve me
Our time together drained the life from me
Only thing I ask of you now
Take a step and push away

You step on me
You take from me
You lean on me
Why don't you push away
You step on me
You take from me
You lean on me
Why don't you push away

You step on me
You take from me
You lean on me
Why don't you push away
