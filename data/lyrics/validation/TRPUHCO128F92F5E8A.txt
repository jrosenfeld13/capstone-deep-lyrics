Youve changed your tune many times, since we met
But I always recognize you, you are part of me
I feel you whether in Jamaica or in the angel city
Youre such a gift to me, ooh

Hey you, I gotta tell you my long time friend
I think of all those years you saw me through tears and the good times that we spend
Hey you, youre my constant companion
You always let me explain just what I am sayin and weve just begun

Ive got one wish for this music to be an uplift
And I need an uplift to deal
And there are few songs all the people can sing along
And one song, come along and sing it for real, ooh

Hey you, I gotta tell you my long time friend
I think of all those years you saw me through tears and the good times that we spend
Hey you, youre my constant companion
You always let me explain just what I am sayin and weve just begun

As I wander around, town to town, lost and found
When so many many others come and go (come and go)
Your sweetness pulls me through (ooh, ooh, ooh)

Hey you, I gotta tell you my long time friend
I think of all those years you saw me through my tears and the good times that we spend
Hey you, youre my constant companion
You always let me explain just what
I am sayin and weve just begun

Hey you, you never turned your back on me
Ahh, when I gave up on myself
Hey you, you never turned your back on me
Ahh, when I gave up on myself
Hey you, what would the world be like
Ahh, without you around
Music youre my constant companion, ahh
