Something came along
And stopped me right in my tracks
Id tell you what it was
But I cant be exact

But it filled me with strength
And it held me intact
When it blessed me with courage
And shamed me to act

Im unable to establish
The moment in time
When swallowed in rhetoric
And dressed up in rhyme

I went and faced the music
And all that entailed
The right on my side gave
Wind to my sails

[Chorus]
When its time, let it go
Youve got to let it go
When the time has come
You have to let it go

You took me for granted
You took me for mad
And you know you took advantage
Of the trust that I had

It shocked me to notice
The mess I was in
It hurt me to find out
The fool that Id been

I know you always
Underestimated me
Well, theres more to this girl
Than the girl that you see

See, you thought that when youd gone
Id be fallin apart
But theres more to this woman
Than a womans heart
Theres more to this woman
Than a womans heart

[Chorus]
When its time, let it go
Youve got to let it go
When the time has come
You have to let it go

Theres a time to be faithful
Theres a time to be brave
I was trying to rescue
I was struggling to save

Every little piece of
What was left to me here
Every little shred
Of all I held dear

Until piece by piece
And bit by bit
I gathered them together
And I made them all fit

Until standing tall
And feeling strong
Im facing the future
And my life goes on
Life still goes on

[Chorus]
When its time, let it go
For God's sake, let it go
When the time has come
You have to let it go

Theres more to this woman
So much more to this woman
Theres more to this woman
So much more to this woman

I know you always
Underestimated me
See, theres more to this girl
Than the girl that you see

Yeah, you thought that when youd gone
Id be fallin apart
But theres more to this woman
So much more to this woman
