[Verse 1]
These four walls, they whisper to me
They know a secret I knew they would not keep
Didn't take long for the room to fill with dust
And these four walls came down around us

[Chorus]
Must have been something, sent me out of my head
With the words so radical
And not what I meant
Now I wait for a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left
Just me and these four walls again

[Verse 2]
It's hard now to let you be
I won't make excuses
I've made my peace
Didn't take long for me to lose the trust
'Cause these four walls were not strong enough

[Chorus]
Must have been something, sent me out of my head
With the words so radical
And not what I meant
Now I wait for a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left
Just me and these four walls again

[Bridge]
Yeah, it's difficult watching us fade
Knowing it's all my fault
My mistake
Yeah, and it's difficult letting you down
Knowing it's all my fault
You're not around

[Chorus]
Must have been something, sent me out of my head
With the words so radical
And not what I meant
Now I wait for a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left
Just me and these four walls again
