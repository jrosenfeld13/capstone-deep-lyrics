[Verse 1]
I'm worried 'bout you baby
Down in your rabbit hole
The evening of our great escape
Is starting to unfold
Out of bed, sleepy head
It's different than you know
Everybody pays as they go

[Verse 2]
Now pull yourself together
Get your chin up off your throat
Now whistle for the dogs
And get your sled into the snow
Nothing's ever buried
Under skull and bones
Everybody pays as they go

[Verse 3]
The playing field is level
But it's ugly down below
It's a devil of a handbook hi ho, hi ho
Either you're the butcher
Or the lamb but even so
Everybody pays as they go

[Verse 4]
The future busted open wide and ran like a
Beehive loaded with sand
You can't go back and see it
The way you saw it then
Nobody can

[Verse 5]
Look up and see the men returning
In their winter coats
Now some of them in one piece
An' some of them got rolled
Some less than others
Some right through the nose
But everybody pays as they go

[Outro]
Young, old, an' rich, an' poor
Your mother she too owes
Cause everybody pays as they go
Everybody pays
Yes everybody pays as they go
