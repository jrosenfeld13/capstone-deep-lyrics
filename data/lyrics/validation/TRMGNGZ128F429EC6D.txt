Donnybrook between two gangsters
And a bunch of merry pranksters

Two against a .22
Well who d'ya think is gonna win that
Fight... fight?

Ten to one it's the gangsters
Those pranksters, they can't even fight

Gangsters like their knuckles bloody
Pranksters spike the drinks of their buddies

Gangsters treat their ladies right
And pranksters curse their chickless plights
(Aw man, there's no...dames)

I've got all this Harvard LSD
Why won't anyone fuck me?!
