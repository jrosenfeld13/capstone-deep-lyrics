Louris-Olson

Well I know your name
Takes you back from where you came
Your words they show
Sometimes it's real to be alone
So real to be alone
I'll survive it's true
But when I get close to June
Alright, okay
It's just two hearts that make us pay
Two hearts that make us pay
It's no better when you cry
Well have you stopped to watch she'll fly
Well have you stopped to watch she'll
I, I'm lonely
I, I'm lonely
I, I'm lonely too
Well the love you need
I don't expect you to let me see
You help, your grace
It's just two hearts that make us pay
Two hearts that make us pay
You appear so strong
And your faith will lead us home
Alright, okay
It's just two hearts that make us pay
Two hearts that make us pay
Ooh two hearts that make us pay
