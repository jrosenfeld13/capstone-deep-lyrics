Show me one good paper guarantee
Oh my sweet promissory
Stern old men make a bed for me
I'm more than ready
One more confirmation
Of a new low
But I'm wired shut
Just say so
Got word when the light passed through
I'm more than ready to give it back
To give it back
Tight fist around a face out of history
Don't think I don't know what's over me
Over me
With a numbing certainty
I'm more than ready
Duty bound
With a guilt-fed guarantee
Good faith
In the narrow path laid for me
Past time to declare sovereignty
I'm more than ready to give it back
To give it back
