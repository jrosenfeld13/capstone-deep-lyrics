A bunch of flowers a word you say
A sparkle in your eye
A second glance you tip your hat
But the girl just passes by

Around the girl in 80 ways
Take her out tonight
Put my arms around you
Squeeze and hold you tight

80 ways around the girl
Most of them I know
All of them are substitutes
For feelings I don't show

A phone call when you're miles apart
Alone you lie you cross your heart
Wine and dine by candlelight
Admit you're wrong when she is right

Around the girl in 80 ways
Take her out tonight
Put my arms around you
Squeeze and hold you tight

80 ways around the girl
Most of them I know
All of them are substitutes
For feelings I don't show

Show concideration to make her day
If she like surprises don't give the game away
Passion romance ni history
Adds that air of mystery
Don't be late your meeting place
Smother her and give her space
A sense of humour little jokes
Shows you're not like other blokes

Around the girl in 80 ways
Take her out tonight
Put my arms around you
Squeeze and hold you tight

80 ways around the girl
Most of them I know
All of them are substitutes
For feelings I don't show

Little gifts and a birthday card
Because deep down you're not so hard
Tender moments sweet caress
Says more than words can express

80 ways around the girl
Most of them I know
All of them are substitutes
For feelings I don't show

Tell her what she needs to know
Eating out taking in a show
Walk her home and say goodnight
You play it cool she wonders why
