[Verse 1]
Shackled by a heavy burden
'Neath a load of guilt and shame
Then the hand of Jesus touched me
And now I am no longer the same

[Chorus]
He touched me, oh He touched me
And oh the joy that floods my soul!
Something happened and now I know
He touched me and made me whole

[Verse 2]
Since I met this blessed Savior
Since He's cleansed and made me whole
Oh I will never cease to praise Him (to praise)
I'll shout it while eternity rolls

[Chorus]
