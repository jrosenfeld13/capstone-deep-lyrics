And they're going away this month, so why can't she have her coat?

Man down, they said
Got a man down
Man down

Please know that I am distraught
Over the conversations we have had these last few nights
I love you
I love my job
Always wanna give it back to you
And make a difference
And not hold you down
Why would you say that?

No criticizing
We don't want you to criticize

Help a man when he's down

Please, can you do me a
Can you...can you help me?
Can you do me a kindness?
Could you do me a kindness?

Hold my cell phone
It's a BlackBerry, hold it
My second BlackBerry is ringing
Tell 'em I'm...just ask 'em to hang on for a minute
I'd love to talk to you right now
But I'm late for a meeting
And...it's Thursday
