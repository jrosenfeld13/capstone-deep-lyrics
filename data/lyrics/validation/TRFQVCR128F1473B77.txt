(Spoken:) Huh! Hah! Huh! Hah-Hum!

Remember when we were kids
We used to come up the runny nose? (come up with the runny nose)
And we would decide it in four hours
And count the blame on Ty Bear Jones?
Never see me when you doin' last night
You gonna go on and have a fight
And in the missed street bend their ways
You know the Devil's got to have his way

Spoken:
When the line of fright is in sight
What you gonna do? (Whatcha gonna do?)
Turn to the left, or look right?

He is a sore loser, if you're a user, every emotions are given to pride
You can't wait until after the fight

(Huh!) Are you used, so just start thinking
Like shifting out of concrete centers
All the things that we see each day
Only fools can afford to play

People in Russia and China
And the folks in the carolinas (folks in the Carolinas)
We couldn't blame this on "No-Neck"
You've gotta learn to be a good fighter
And if you're thinkin' out on the night
You're gonna go and have a fight (gonna go and have a fight)
And like Nixon at McDonald's, so late
It's goin' down with the Watergate

(Spoken:)
When the line of fright is in sight
What you gonna do? (Whatcha' gonna do?)
Turn to the left, or look right?

He is a sore loser, If you're a user, every emotions are given, pride
We can't wait until after the fight (Can't wait 'til after the fight)

(Spoken:) Huh! Hah! Huh!

The message in these generations
It's going through and out to the nations
If you think it's warm outside
We'd better stop and think for a while
Think about it deeper, we can't wait until after the fight
We can't wait until after the fight
To decide to do what is right, Now
