It's just a good excuse to watch the sun go down
On a gravel pit outside of town
My father had three daughters
So I became his only son

Summertime in Allen County
You can slice the air like bread
Pack up our old Rambler
With cane poles and little said

You never talk much in a fishin' boat
'Cause it just scares the fish away
You just give it time and watch your line

He's say, "Just an hour or two."
Some folks are always like that
And never really answer you

You never talk much in a fishin' boat
'Cause it just scares the fish away
You just give it time and watch your line

The sun goes down and why no one knows
I grew up out of my fishin' clothes
I told him once and he slowly smiled
That his only son was expecting a child

You never talk much in a fishin' boat
'Cause it just scares the fish away
You just give it time and watch your line

I'll remember all my life
My father's face in the de3ep twilight
In a boat under the evening sun
Throwin' back the little ones
