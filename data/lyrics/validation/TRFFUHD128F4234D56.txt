I sat with the drunks and the speed freaks
And I watched all the drones strolling by
We sat on the street with our beers and our weed
And we blew our smoke up towards the sky

I said, "It's one hell of an evening"
With a smile and I kicked back my can
They shooed us away so we walked down a ways
And we did the same damn thing again

Now I got nothing to wait for
And I got nothing but time
So I'll swim in these streams
And warm these poor beaten insides

Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme the key to the city
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme the key to the city
These Midwest eyes are dead tonight
This demon smile is aching to explode

Let's gather our bones
Our guts and our hearts
And scream so they'll
Hear us down in those parks

Under those trees where the pigs lurk and crawl
There are bonfires and parties that are fucking them all
They give it by the inch but they take it by the mile
It's one for the beating and two for the trial

They got nothing to wait for
And we got nothing but time
So I'll swim in these streams
Drown in these dirty streams till I die

Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme the key to the city
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme the key to the city
These Midwest eyes are dead tonight
This demon smile is aching to explode
Let's burn out here a thousand miles from home

I ain't here to remember!
I ain't here to breakdown

Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme the key to the city
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme the key to the city
These Midwest eyes are dead tonight
This demon smile is aching to explode
Let's burn out here a thousand miles from home

I know what I got
And I love what I know
Don't wait up
