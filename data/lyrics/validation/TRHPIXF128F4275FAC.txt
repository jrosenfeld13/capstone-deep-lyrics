I came back home to my old town today
My friends were different, nothing much to say
How could a year matter all that much
Then I heard 'em say, "man it must be tough"

Something changed
Something changed
She believed in blue skies
I just brought her rain
It ain't so strange, something changed

Well they said that I'd be gone for quite a while
When they watched another walk her down the aisle
She found a true heart like I feared she would
But what I found was what we had was good

Something changed
Something changed
She believed in blue skies
I just brought her rain
It ain't so strange, something changed

I must have been a fool to ever come back
I should've never gone across the tracks
Down by the depot is where we met
But I walked away and I'm walking yet

Something changed
Something changed
She believed in blue skies
I just brought her rain
It ain't so strange, something changed
It ain't so strange, something changed
