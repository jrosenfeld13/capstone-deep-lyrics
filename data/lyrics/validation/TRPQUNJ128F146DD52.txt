I've penned your poison 1000 times
You think you're mighty, I believe you're a swine
You're a disgusting child and everyone thinks so
I'm confused about how I want to be, am I you or are you me
A whisper will shout down most of my ego

So tell me, when the night moves slow, do your green shades grow
Is it jealousy or an ago?
Are you really, really that witty, when you're sitting at home being pretty clipping your nails with my old man?

See me, I'm not Edward, I've never been Edward
Darling I'm just a mere mistake
But I stay free! If i'm not Edward, i'll never be Edward
So Eddie is just a chance to be fake!

So you sit down and order a pint, do you want a friend or do you want a fight?
I can see the tears behind your fist
You may think this is just a joke, a little joke to promote my own
But darling, its the most truth your ears know!

So tell me, when the night moves slow, do your green shades grow
Is it jealousy or an ago?
Are you really, really that witty, when you're sitting at home being pretty clipping your nails with my old man?

See me, I'm not Edward, I've never been Edward
Darling I'm just a mere mistake
But I stay free! If i'm not Edward, i'll never be Edward
And Eddie is just a chance to be fake!
