Nothing can offer content
Nothing can ease the pain
Nothing can wear off the sorrow
One is born to bear within

While your world is worth of trying
My world is mere cold
No chance in disillusion
Only the end of the road

Man weighed down with sorrow
Anguished from the sole being
Destined to live with uneasiness
Always the hard way

Nothing can offer content
Nothing can ease the pain
Nothing can wear off the sorrow
One is born to bear within

While your world is worth of trying
My world is mere cold
No chance in disillusion
Only the end of the road

Nothing can offer content
Nothing can ease the pain
Nothing can wear off the sorrow
One is born to bear within

While your world is worth of trying
My world is mere cold
No chance in disillusion
Only the end of the road

Cold is the world
For the ones excluded
Dark is the path
In the absence of light

Compelled to cherish
Beauty in longing
Cling on love
Amidst of the suffering

No chance in disillusion
No, not in this world
Not for a man
Weighed down with sorrow
Only the end of the road
