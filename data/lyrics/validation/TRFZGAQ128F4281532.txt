I don't like no arga'ment
I don't like to raise no sand
I've got two women runnin' hand-in-hand
When they get together
I don't know which one's a man
I don't care, don't scandalize my name

(instrumental & harmonica)

Caught my woman by the hand
Come here woman don't you understand?
Get in the kitchen in them pots an pans
You wear the dress, you know you ain't no man
I don't care, don't scandalize my name

(instrumental & harmonica)

Bought my woman a diamond ring
An I placed it on her hand
Listen here woman, I ain't no monkey man
Don't like to be always raisin' sand
I don't care, don't scandalize my name

(instrumental & harmonica to end)
