The time has come for me to hang my head in shame
The time has come for me to say that I'm to blame
The time has come for love's return but it won't be the same
Oh please believe me I won't make the same mistakes again

The time has come to end this very sad affair
The time has come for you and I once more to share a summers kiss
But love's return won't ever be the same
Oh please believe me I won't make the same mistakes again

No more sorrows, no more cheating
Our tomorrows won't be repeating the past

So here am I to ask if you can still forgive
If you can love, the time has come for love to live
With no regrets, but take my word that love won't be the same
Oh please believe me I won't make the same mistakes again

Oh please believe me I won't make the same mistakes again
