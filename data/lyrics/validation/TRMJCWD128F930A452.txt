Got a new faith
It's called food on my plate
Dragging the lakes

Gave me a view
It's the least they could do
After what i been through

Did anyone tell you?
We've been waiting around
The jobs are over
All the value has been found

Bought a new ride
Got a new place to hide
All stops applied

Stole me a boat
And a flashy new coat
Now i'm digging the moat

Did anyone tell you?
We've been waiting around
The jobs are over
All the liquor has been downed
