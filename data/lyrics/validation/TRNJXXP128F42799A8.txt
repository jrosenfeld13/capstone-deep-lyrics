Ooh, ooh

Well, you used to be a rogue and that's no lie
Couldn't care if you lived, couldn't care if you died
Gettin' high, gettin' drunk out with your gang
Man, you were so bad they should've made you hang
You used to be a swinger and that's no lie
You had umpteen women all at the same time
Never had no money but you lived like the rich
Poncing all your money off of some poor bitch

But now oh, whoa oh oh
Now you're tryin' to be a family man
I said oh, whoa oh oh
Now you're tryin' to be a family man
Listen

Oh, don't you sit it down, get up

You used to be a rogue and that's no lie
Couldn't care if you lived, couldn't care if you died
Then you met a girl by the name of Sue
She looked just like your mother, she was badder than you

Oh oh oh oh oh

Nine months later you were totally changed
I saw you go to the church to be born again

And now oh, whoa oh oh
Now you're tryin' to be a family man
I said oh, whoa oh oh
Now you're tryin' to be a family man

There's no way out, there's no turning back
So keep it in the family

I said oh, whoa oh oh
Now you're tryin' to be a family man
I said oh, whoa oh oh
Now you're tryin' to be a family man
I said whoa, whoa oh oh
Now you're tryin' to be a family man
Could you be a family man?
Whoa oh oh
Now you're tryin' to be a family man

Do you know what I mean?
Oh oh
Tryin' to be a family man
Oh oh
Tryin' to be a family man
Tr-tr-tr-tryin' to be, baby, whoa baby
Tryin' to be a family man
Do you know what I mean? Do you know what I mean, now?
Oh oh oh
Now you're tryin' to be a family man

Whoa baby, yeah, yeah, yeah
Tryin' to be a family man
Alright now, said now whoa whoa, whoa whoa
Take it down, take it down, take it down, take it down, take it down
Tryin' to be a family man
I said oh, whoa oh
Now you're tryin' to be a family man
