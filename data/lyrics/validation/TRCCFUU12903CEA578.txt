Our love in little heaps
Our love now fast asleep
Our love was taking leaps
Don't land

You're so pretty floating through the air
How you pause by despair
Bullet flies toward disrepair
Don't land, dont land
Don't land, dont land

Alleluia! Alleluia!

Bright trails against the sky
So much destruction, how does it fly?
I must avert my eyes
Don't land, dont land
Don't land, dont land

Alleluia! Alleluia!
Alleluia! Alleluia!

Our love was built on heavy things
Our love survives and sings
Our love always it had wings
Don't land, dont land
Don't land, dont land
Don't land
