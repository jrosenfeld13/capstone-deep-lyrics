Can you save me from myself again
I'm drowning in this ocean
I'm sinking like a stone again
How long can I hold on
So somehow
I hear the waves come crashing
They'll just pull me down
To stay around

Together we can face it
I know we can turn the tide
Together we can change the way things are
Letting go is suicide
Give me back love love love

Can you take me to the end again
Paint a different picture
Message to me heaven-sent
Says that I'm forgiven
Closer now
I feel the storm upon us
Falling through the clouds
Headed down

But together we can break it
I know we can turn the tide
Together we can change the way things are
Letting go is suicide
Give me back the love love love

Never say never
I never kissed
My luck could've changed
Could've changed

Trust me now
I feel the winds are changing
I know we can turn the tide
Together we can change the way things are
Better take a look inside
All we need is love love love
All we need is love love love
I know we can turn the tide
Yeah
We need love love love
We need love love love
Love love love

We need love love love
Can you save me
