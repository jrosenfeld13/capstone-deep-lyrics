Im so overwhelmed that I
Wish I would die
Wish I could right now
Intense happiness presses
My heart against the sink
Oh wheres my head
Oh now you think youre special
Its hard to take it sometimes
Try to play dead now

I might just fall in love
With you and with the world
With you and with the world
Like mirrors facing mirrors
In endless blues and reds
Echoing pixels blend
I might just fall in love
But times running out
Im losing footing now
Hurry for the love I spread
Might turn into scorn instead

Drive claws into the steering wheel
I couldnt feel the pressure on my skin
Please tell me silly stories of golden youth
So lost and beautiful
Oh now you think youre special
And you try to play dead now
But the beatings too loud

I might just fall in love
With you and with the world
With you and with the world
Like mirrors facing mirrors
In endless blues and reds
Echoing pixels blend
I might just fall in love
But times running out
Im losing it now

I might just fall in love
With you and with the world
With you and with the world
Like mirrors facing mirrors
In endless blues and reds
Echoing pixels blend
I might just fall in love
My patiences running out
Im losing footing now
Forget everything Ive said
My hearts a liar and wheres my head...

Try to play dead now
