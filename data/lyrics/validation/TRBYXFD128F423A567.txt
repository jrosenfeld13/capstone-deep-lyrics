I'm overwhelmed and I don't know where to start
I tried to cut out the ugliness living in my heart
They tell me I'm lucky, lucky to be alive
Well, I don't feel lucky, and nothing feels right

The lucky ones have already gone down
The lucky ones are lucky they're not around

We did our dirty business as if nothing was wrong
It all stopped one day when most everything was gone
We ignored the warnings; what else could we do?
Now they're telling who's left we're the chosen few

The lucky ones have already gone down
The lucky ones are lucky they're not around
The lucky ones have already gone down
The lucky ones are lucky they're not around

If this is what it means to be saved
If this is what it means to be saved
If this is what it means to be saved
You can take my place; just give me your grave

The lucky ones have already gone down
The lucky ones are lucky they're not around
The lucky ones have already gone down
The lucky ones are lucky they're not around
The lucky ones are lucky they're not around
The lucky ones are lucky they're not around
