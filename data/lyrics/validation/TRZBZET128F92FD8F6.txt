Lost in space
Lost in space
Lost in space
(Lost in space) - lost without a reason
(Lost in space) - loved with a feeling
(Lost in space) - trapped in a 22
(Lost in space) - time is running out now
(Lost in space) - love never showed how
(Lost in space) - lost 'cause you've gone away
You know you took it all away
Losing control
Oh no, no - lost, lost in space for sure
Losing control
- Lost in space for sure
- Lost in space for sure
- Lost in space for sure
(Lost in space) - searching for a mission
(Lost in space) - lost without control
(Lost in soace) - lost with the chance that I had
(Lost in space) - did you get what you were after?
(Lost in space) - leaving disaster
(Lost in space) - left in the years to make!
'Cause you took it all away
Losing control
Oh no, no - lost in space for sure
Losing control
Oh no, no - lost in space for sure
Lost in space for sure, lost in space for sure
Lost in space for sure, lost in space for sure
(Lost in space) - lost without a reason
(Lost in space) - loved with a feeling
(Lost in space) - trapped in a 22
(Lost in space) - time is running out now
(Lost in space) - love never showed how
(Lost in space) - lost 'cause you've gone away
(Lost in space) - searching for a mission
Lost, lost, lost. - lost in space
