More Often Than Not (David Wiffen)

Well, have I not been quite far enough
How many times do you have to die now
How many sets has it been
Not another one, oh no
And would you believe
That it happens more often than not
But here's to all the people
That I'm not with tonight
Wherever they are

Well, I rolled into town last night, I'm tired
And would you believe I would like to cry now
I saw my lady laying there with a man
Not another one, oh no
And would you believe
That it happens more often than not
And here's to all the ladies
That I'm not with tonight
Wherever they are

So I went on stumbling to the town
How many times do you got to try
Someone said that she would love me
Not another one, oh no
And would you believe
That it happens more often than not
But here's to all the ladies
That fell for me tonight
Whoever they are

So pass that bottle, now give it here
There's so many reasons to drink it dry
Numb my pain maybe even kill me
Hey have another one let's go
And would you believe
That it happens more often than not
And here's to all the bottles
That I've drunk in my time
Whatever they were
