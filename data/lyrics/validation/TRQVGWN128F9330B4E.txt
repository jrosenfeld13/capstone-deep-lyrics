Ticking, that insane sound
We dance to the running of hours
Programmed moments passing by
Tighten the knot around our time

Fortunes slipping, ignoring despair
Generations deny their collapse
Staring up the gallows pole
To once more sigh in relief

So silent the breath of a dead man
So silent we don't want to hear
Just grin back at fate when it's smiling
The headsman won't forget

Expectations constitute the failures
As we pray to have the world
Programmed figures passing by
On their ceaseless hunt to conquer life
Wealth at the steps of the blind
Seeking on both sides

All clung to the ropes
Failing two feet down
We refuse to drown in the sand
And make decisions of no avail
Staring up with arrogance
To play the fool nothing daunted

So silent the breath of a dead man
So silent we don't want to hear
Laughing at those who we left behind
Just can't get enough of the ride

Ticking, that insane sound
We dance to the running of hours
Programmed moments passing by
Tighten the knot around our time

Fortunes slipping, ignoring despair
Generations deny their collapse
Staring up the gallows pole
To once more sigh in relief

All clung to the ropes
Falling two feet down
No need to flee, they have found us
Praying to have it all
