I tried to come down from you
I tried with your voice in my head
Knocking me back
Every inch I moved
I'm a sucker for a good lie
The way you say you understand
And how you always talk of catching me
But never open up your hand

Tell me does the world revolve the same
Tell me do the people all take care of you
Did you doubt the curve of the earth
And every word..
Every word
I'll bet you heard

I know you're here to catch your breath
But I'm not listening for the right words anymore
I'll take what's left
You're vicious like the blue sky
Right before the rain comes pouring through
Tell me does he look like me at all
Cause they're all an awful lot like you

Tell me does the world revolve the same
Tell me do the people all take care of you
Did you doubt the curve of the earth
And every word..
Every word...

Tell me does the world look all insane
Tell me how the people all just scare you
Did you doubt the curve of the earth
And every word..
Every word... I'll bet you heard

Tell me does the world revolve the same
Tell me do the people all take care of you
Did you doubt the curve of the earth
And every word..
Every word...

Tell me does the world look all insane
Tell me how the people all just scare you
Did you doubt the curve of the earth
And every word..
Every word... I'll bet you heard
Did you doubt the curve of the earth
Did you doubt the curve of the earth
