Here I go again me and a stranger
Here I go again me and a kind beast
Strangely enough I become the stranger
Frightened enough
I do not exist
Take my brand new friend for a ride in the city
Take my brand new friend for a ride in my great plan
Leave my brand new friend where he wants to get off
Leave my brand new friend take my pictures and run

Again from PLUTO to you
I have a vision
And DANCE
