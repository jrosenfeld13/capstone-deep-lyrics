Seems a little bit odd when you think about how the way he used to
Certain things that you did when you were with me but not with him or are you?
Looking for a purpose in the time we spend with me you argue
I don't want to be the man you used to have but in a brand new forum
So many times I let this go
But I won't let you do this
You tried to turn me into him
I will not stand for this again
I've held my thoughts inside my head
But now I'm leaving
I was hoping maybe things would change but I guess it's just the way you are
Even if you understood I feel like everything would carry on
See the little thing you're looking for it's not in me and you won't find it
He's the one you really want, it isn't me, you know you can't deny it
So many times I let this go
But I won't let you do this
You tried to turn me into him
I will not stand for this again
I've held my thoughts inside my head
But now I'm leaving
Seem to think you've got it right this time
This is never gonna be alright
I don't think you understand that I will never be the man that you need
Wanted me to be the only one
Couldn't live up to the chosen one
Sick of all the little games you play
And now I think it's time that I leave
So many times I let this go
But I won't let you do this
You tried to turn me into him
I will not stand for this again
I've held my thoughts inside my head
But now I'm leaving
