[Verse 1]
Bad guys do what you like
I'm getting high tonight on Kryptonite
'Cause since the day that she left
I've stayed in bed, I've been depressed
You knew that I saw through walls
So what'd you kiss him for? I saw it all
And now if you're in distress
You're gonna have to find someone else instead
The only time I use my X-ray powers
Is when I think you're gonna take a shower

[Chorus]
Don't you understand I'm just bad Superman
And I'd do anything to get you
Don't you understand I'm just bad Superman
Getting over Lois was nothing compared to you
'Cause I'm bad Super-ma-a-n
Kinda sad Super-ma-a-n
Just a man, without you
The only super thing about me, was you

[Verse 2]
Was I a little intense?
You never liked me when I was Clark Kent
Was it because of the glasses?
It may sound weird but I had to ask it
'Cause I could always wear lenses
I don't know why my laser eyes never mended
What's been happening to me?
But since you left I've just turned really mean
The only time I use my laser eyes
Is to make your new boyfriend cry

[Chorus]
Don't you understand I'm just bad Superman
And I'd do anything to get you
Don't you understand I'm just bad Superman
Getting over Lois was nothing compared to you
'Cause I'm bad Super-ma-a-n
Kinda sad Super-ma-a-n
Just a man, without you
The only super thing about me, was you
The only super thing about me, was you

[Chorus]
Don't you understand I'm just bad Superman
And I'd do anything to get back with you
Don't you understand I'm just bad Superman
Getting over Lois was nothing compared to you
'Cause I'm bad Super-ma-a-n
Kinda sad Super-ma-a-n
Just a man, without you
The only super thing about me, was you

[Chorus (Modified)]
Don't you understand I'm just bad Superman
And I'd do anything to get you
Don't you understand I'm just bad Superman
The only super thing about me, was you
