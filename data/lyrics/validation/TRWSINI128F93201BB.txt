Who's gonna wake me when I'm dead
Who's gonna arouse me from my bed
Get it in a bookshop son you said
Who's gonna wake me, you said

Tell me something to make me wonder
Tell me something for real

Should someone fly by today
I hope they fly me away
Small words and big things to say
I hope they drop by today

Ahhh, ahhh

Tell me something to make me wonder
Tell me something for real

You found the edge of a crowd
And found it's musty and loud
Big words and small things to say
With words that won't go away

Tell me something to make me wonder
Tell me something for real

Ahhh, ahhh
