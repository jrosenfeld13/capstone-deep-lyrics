Hark how the bells
Sweet silver bells
All seem to say
Throw cares away

Christmas is here
Bringing good cheer
To young and old
Meek and the bold

From every village town
Can you hear the sound
Can you see the light through the door

Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas
Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas

On on they send
On without end
Their joyful tone to every home

[Ding dong dong ding ding dong dong ding]
[Ding dong dong ding ding dong dong ding]
Christmas is here

Oh how they pound
Raising the sound
O'er hill and dale
Telling their tale

Hear how they ring
While people sing
Songs of good cheer
Christmas is here

From every village town
Can you hear the sound
Can you see the light through the door

Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas
Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas

Hear how they ring
While people sing
Songs of good cheer
Christmas is here

[Ding dong dong ding ding dong dong ding]
[Ding dong dong ding ding dong dong ding]
Christmas is here

Sing we now of Christmas
Sing we all Noel
Of the Lord and Savior
We the tidings tell
Sing we Noel
For Christ the King is born
Sing we Noel
For Christ the Lord is born
Angels from on high
May shepherds come and see
He's born in Bethlehem
A blessed family
Glory to God
For Christ our King is born
Glory to God
For Christ our Lord is born
Sing we now of Christmas
Sing we all Noel
Sing we now of Christmas
Sing we all Noel
Sing we all Noel
Sing we all Noel
