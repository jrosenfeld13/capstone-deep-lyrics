Mama go make my bed
Tuck in the absurd
These confessions are mine
But I'll not claim a word

This restless parade
Yes I watched it go by
Through the cracks in my palm
Seen them all gone
Some sequence of lives

Well she calls out alone
With the pain in her voice
It's the wound of betrayal
It's the weapon of choice

Left her heart on display
Though that she'll deny
Two tattoos of skin
One of ice one of tin
For the days have gone by

But I ain't one to reminisce
But close my heart and clench my fists

Now the days swiftly pass
With the chest full of fear
Here the minutes are hours
But the moments are years

And old acquaintances passed
In trios, in pairs
And if they stay or they go
One struggles to know
One struggles to care

But out beyond the penitentiary walls
The wind blows hard the highway crawls

And if you should pass the James Hotel
Please stop in for I knew you well
But that was oh so long ago
And I never learned how to let go

But when you fear your own faults
And you're sick of this life
When you're reckless of hand
And trembling the knife
And all your doors prefer locks
And your death prefers spoons
Why wouldn't you wait one last laugh at fate
Forever's too soon

But across the field death bell knells
Listen close hear the toll tell

To run and tell my darling true
My breath is short
My days are few
So please come down
And take my hand
My last demand

And lead me to some slender rest
And please dismiss what I confess
