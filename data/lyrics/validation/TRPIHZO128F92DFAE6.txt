A one, two, three, four
It was a long walk to the parked car
Keep your head down, keep your hands warm
I already can't see straight
Miles and miles from where we began
And I heard steel on steel
Blinding light and grating wheels
Everything moves so fast
Leaves no time to ask
Does nothing last?
Do all things pass?
Just ash to ash?
It was a short story to tell
Over and over to myself
Each time it became more clear
The only one to blame was standing here
And I heard steel on steel
Blinding light and grating wheels
Everything moves so fast
Leaves no time to ask
Does nothing last?
Do all things pass?
Just ash to ash?
What a curse
What a lie
Destined to survive
And relive every night
Like my hands were tied
