In this life we go through lots of hard times
And we say who knows what the day will bring
We learn to survive 'cause that's the only way
It's kinda nice to talk about the good times
Like the feelin' we all know when the summer comes
That's the reason we all know we are as one
Yesterday is over let's live for today
Good mornin' to the blue skies good-bye to the grey
So come into the sunshine step out of the rain
A new day is arising at daybreak
Everybody together people come into our world
People everybody together
People come into our world
I think it's time to have a celebration
It is time to find another way
To keep movin' on toward a better day, yeah
Yesterday is over let's live for today
Good mornin' to the blue skies
Good-bye to the grey
So come into the sunshine
Step out of the rain
A new way is arising at daybreak
People
Everybody together people come into the world
People everybody together
People come into our world
Whoa our world
Uh huh our world
Whoa people come into our world!!!
At daybreak we can live
We can love come on people
We can get it on
We can live together lets come together
We can live together lets come together
We can live together lets come together
Together at daybreak
Come together
We can live together lets come together
Together at daybreak
Come together
We can live together lets come together
Together at daybreak
Come together
