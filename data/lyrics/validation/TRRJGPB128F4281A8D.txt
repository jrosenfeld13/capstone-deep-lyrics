Well, you can stay all night if you want to
You can hang out with all of his friends
You can go and meet 'is mother and father
Mm, ya' better make sure that's where it ends

'Cause baby there's one thing that you gotta' know

Let him read your palm and guess your sign
Let him take ya' home and treat ya' fine
But baby
Don't let him waste your time
Don't let him waste your time

'Cause the years fly by in an instant
And you wonder what he's waitin' for
Ah, then some skinny bitch walks by in some hot pants
And he's a'runnin' out the door

So remember that one thing that you gotta know

(Chorus)

You ain't gettin' no younger
And you got nothing to show
So tell him that it's now or never
And then
Go go go go go

He can have his space
Yeah, he can take his time
Now he can kiss ya' where the sun don't shine
Oh baby
Don't let him waste your time (x9)
