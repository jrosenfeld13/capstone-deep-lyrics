Lost Parade
Woke from a dream I called
Out of my head that night
There were marchers
Saints and things singing
The epoch still leads
The party lines were drawn
It feels again
Feels again so long
Remember
We cried
The universe is mine
Tonight
We'll take it all this time
On and on we live it long
This generation must expose it
The lost parade you're riding on seek sanctuary
The lost parade moves on
The hidden admit that they knew
Changed beds with us
Some looked in and through it
Some never closed their eyes
Comes this way
And all gets overthrown
It feels again
Feels again so long
Remember
We cried
The universe is mine
Tonight
We'll take it all this time
On and on we live it long
This generation must expose it
The lost parade you're riding on seek sanctuary
The lost parade moves on
Lost parade keeps moving on, moving on, moving on
Lost parade keeps moving on, moving on, moving on
Remember
We cried
The universe is mine
Tonight
We'll take it all this time
On and on we live it long
This generation must expose it
The lost parade you're riding on seek sanctuary
The lost parade moves on
