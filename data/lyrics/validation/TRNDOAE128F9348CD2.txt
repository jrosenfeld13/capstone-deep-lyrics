I've lost my romantic ...
I can't float with you
Picking the flowers
From centre of heart

But this is a true
Lovesong for you

I've lost my romantic ...
There's a hole in my heart
Times they're changing
Too fast for your hearts

But, please understand
This is a lovesong for you

Now it's my fear
That the things come back
In the same way
Like ever and ever again

But this is a true
Lovesong for you

Now it's my fear
That I've lost my heart
To the wind
Whitch never, never comes back

But, please understand
This is a lovesong for you
