Have you ever heard youve got the wrong idea?
Yet, it aint the case; no fear
Cos you know just whats what and what goes where
So lies, otherwise, are from fools clutching air
You see theres always those who snide
Who go behind your back and your eyes
They think they know it all, but what do you care?
Cos all you want is burning sounds that comes from the heart
Burning sounds thats right from the start
They gave you that release
Hey, whats all this? Did you think me round the twist?
Did you think that nonsense I believe?
Well, youre very wrong, but you can carry on
It wont be me that you deceive
Cos thats where my strength lies
I can see through all you try
And heavy numbers, they get nowhere
Cos all I want is burning sounds that comes from the heart
Burning sounds thats right from the start
Gave me my release
Yeah, its burning sounds that make me feel strong
Make me feel that I could go on
Forever, it never cease
Burning sounds, burning sounds
Burning sounds, that release
Burning sounds make me feel strong
Make me feel that I can go on
Forever, never cease
