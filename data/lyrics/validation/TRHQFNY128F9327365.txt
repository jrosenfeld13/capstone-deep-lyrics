Seeing you, seeing me
We together, we without
Nothing will
Be the same
2nd thoughts, over again
There will be another (fucking) day, waiting...

[Chorus]
As we slide, through the end
If my twisted mind, could change the stars Before I die, could I change?
This is my end, this is the last time I cry

There will be
Something for the pain
If I just could see
What it may be

Time to get things right
Time to let it go...

[Chorus]
As we slide, through the end
My twisted mind, could change the stars
Before I die, could I change?
This is my end, this is the last time I cry
