I keep pictures of him in my mind yeah you know the
Kind they curl up on the edges, the corners are bended
Into a trickpulled from behind

Physically he is serene he looks good he looks
Clean yeah I know he's dead but I know what he
Said and I think I might know what he mean

With many thanks for your well, well wishes he says
Believe me, sincerely yours
Mr. E Leon Rauis would say
It's sentiment which he abhors

Seventeen Union Square North did he walk back and
Forth in the glass at the shop did he smile did he
Stop for awhile did he question his worth?

Seventeen Union Square West dressed up looking his best
Mr. E. Leon Rauis could never know
How this would seem his one small request

With many thanks for your well, well wishes he says
Believe me, sincerely yours
Mr. E Leon Rauis would say
It's sentiment which he abhors

Regretfully so he still wants you to know of the
Things in his heart he can't say

His penmenship does a disservice
It's illegible to this day

Oh, Mr. E. Leon Rauis believe me
I hope it all turned out O.K

Picking a shop for the shoot did he buy a new
Suit? was he tall, was he kind, did he finally
Find it that day, was his end absolute?

He got old like everyone, was he somebody's
Son? did he fall, did he try to succeed or deny
What he knew or things he had done?
