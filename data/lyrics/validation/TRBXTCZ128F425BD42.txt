Please don't cry for hammer in your teeth
We'll spoil the pretty snow that lies beneath
Who go cry for hammer in her teeth
We'll spoil her pretty face at least she feels real
No-go cry for hammer in your teeth
We'll spoil the pretty snow that never feels real

Breathe, you breathe, believe you me tonight
Breathe in, breathe out, make good, make float, bleed you me ' n'tt

Please don't cry for hammer in your teeth
We'll spoil the pretty snow that lies beneath
And summer will make good for all of our sins
If we only wish it hard enough

Breathe, you breathe, who go, who cry, believe you me to night
Breathe in, breathe out, make good, make float, bleed you me ' n'tt

She cry, who closes eyes and hopes not to come back
