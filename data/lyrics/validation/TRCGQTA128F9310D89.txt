Wander alone
Seeing is believing
Not without a soul
To hold me flat on the ground
I meant every word I said you are the one I've been looking for wanting more
I'm all alone in this
What part of that did you miss that will not last hey you I am the one you've been running from
But I know they don't know that maybe I was meant to live this way in a love struck kind of way
Follow me into the void
Excuse me do I even know you
No you don't
No you don't
Get a grip oh my God get a grip on what the final piece that I need is that spark in your eye
Where did it go
My own disguise is right in my sights
We learn we breathe
The sky hears my plea hey you I am the one you've been running from but I know they don't know that maybe I was meant to live this way in a love struck kind of way in two dimensions
Always I've been living in the light of the world
Even you can't change me now
