I could not face
I could not face you
Lost my place
Couldn't I fade away

Cannot wait
To trade my place again
You save face
When I hang my head in shame

Feelings hide
Feelings die

Cannot wait
To trade my place again
You save face
When I hang my head in shame

Feelings hide
Feelings die

They could not wait to open you up
They could not wait to open you up

I could not face
I could not face you
Lost my place
Couldn't I fade away
