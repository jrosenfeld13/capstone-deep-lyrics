[Verse 1]
I'm strong, but I break
I'm stubborn, and I make plenty of mistakes
Yeah I'm hard, and life with me is never easy
To figure out, to love, I'm jaded but oh so lovely

[Chorus]
All you have to do is hold me
And you'll know and you'll see just how sweet it can be
If you'll trust me, love me, let me
Maybe, maybe

[Verse 2]
Someday, when we're at the same place
When we're on the same road
When it's ok to hold my hand, without feeling lost
Without all the excuses

[Pre-Chorus]
When it's just because you love me, you let me, you need me
Then maybe, maybe

[Chorus]
All you have to do is hold me
And you'll know and you'll see just how sweet it can be
If you'll trust me, love me, let me
Maybe, maybe

[Bridge 1]
I'm confusing as hell, I'm north and south
And I'll probably never have it all figured out
But what I know is I wasn't meant to walk this world
Without you

And I promise I'll try, yeah I'm going to try
To give you every little part of me
Every single detail you missed with your eyes
Then maybe, maybe, yeah maybe

One day, we'll meet again and you'll need me
You'll see me completely
Every little bit
Oh yeah maybe you'll love me, you'll love me then

[Bridge 2]
I don't want to be tough
And I don't want to be proud
I don't need to be fixed
And I certainly don't need to be found, I'm not lost

I need to be loved, I just need to be loved
I just want to be loved by you
And I won't stop because I believe
That maybe, yeah maybe, maybe, yeah maybe

I should know better than to touch the fire twice
But I'm thinking maybe, yeah maybe you're mine

[Outro]
Maybe, love maybe
