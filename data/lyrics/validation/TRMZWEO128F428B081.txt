Coughing blood and I'm feeling fine
So I've done for a long, long time
Doesn't matter cause I got you
Never lonely, I'm never blue
Lock you up and I put you out
It's like a ritual to me

But every time I'm losing you
I'm going out of my head

Spend our fortune ALONG the way
WALK A MILE for you everyday
When I'm shaking you make me still
Your the one and the only thrill
Lock you up and I put you out
It's like a ritual to me

But every time I'm losing you
I'm going out of my head

Yeah

Looking good when you're in my grip
When you hide, from my hollering
I'm A Dragon you gotta see
It's the way that you wanna be
Lock you up and I put you out
It's like a ritual to me

But every time I'm losing you
I'm going out of my, every time I'm losing you (x2)
I'm going goddamn bananas
