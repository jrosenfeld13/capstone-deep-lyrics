I wouldn't change a thing about you
I wouldn't ask the green to be blue
I wouldn't ask the birds not to fly
Or change a thing in the sky
Or turn hello to goodbye

I wouldn't ask the birds not to sing
I wouldn't ask the phone not to ring
I just couldn't ask the wind not to blow

Or a boat not to row
Or a trio to go solo

You are amazing just as you are
You're a flower in the spring
You're the light each morning brings
And I adore you just where you are
You're not the star that I wish on
You're the wish on my star
