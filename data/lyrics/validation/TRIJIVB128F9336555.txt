Do you take this man for your lawful husband? Yes! I do
And do you take this lady for your lawful wife? Yes, I do

I'm getting married in the morning
Ding dong! You hear the church bell ring
She have mi yellow baby and I'm gonna?
So take me to the church on time

But hear me man!

Say if you think I'm s***, cho little girl reach out and touch me
If you really need me, cho little girl reach out and tell me
And, give me your loving, give me your loving
Don't forget about the all night squeezing
Don't forget about the hugging and teasing

Say on my way me a go to?
On my way me a go to?
Me? Mi wife? Name Susan
Say? Husband I beg you sing a love song
If you ever change your mind about leaving, leaving me behind

Say honey bring it to me, bring your sweet loving
Bring it alone to me. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Say that mi wife is a part of mi life
Mi wife is a part of mi life
Say some a married and some a divorced
Some a them a talk 'bout married life to?
But tell you Yellowman the girls them love the most
But when it comes to? Yellowman?

Say that a mi a the husband you a the wife
My fry the chicken and you boil the rice
Me sweet like sugar and me nice like spice
They say that me have one good?
But this come to? Fathead?

Roses are red my love but violets are blue
Sugar is sweet my love but not as sweet as you
