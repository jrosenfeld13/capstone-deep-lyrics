Fifteen million miles away from home
And I start breathing, and beleiving
That I can find the strength to carry on
Oh God I'm needing, too numb for feelings
Oh please don't kick me when I'm down
Or I'll drown, in my self loathing
Oh please, forget this in the morning
And I won't be mourning when I die
Anchors on my ankles, and I sunk
Into depression, or is this some lession?
And its cold and grey and no white light is guiding
Searching for insight, into my own life
Oh please, don't kick me when I'm down
Or I'll drown, in my self loathing
Oh please, forget this in the morning
And I won't be mourning when I die
And oh please, don't kick me when I'm down
Or I'll drown, in my self loathing
And please, forget this in the morning
And I won't be mourning when I...
Mouring when I, mourning when I die
