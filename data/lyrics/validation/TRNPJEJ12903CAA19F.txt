You really got to take a hold, of feelings deep down in my soul
You really got to taste this fire, you know my love will take you higher
And once we join we'll never part, we'll share the secrets of our hearts
We'll quickly move on past the pain, we'll quickly move on past the shame
And boy I think it's time you know, we're gonna take it nice and slow
No rushin cause we got the night we'll take some time to get it right

So come on and get it, you know that, I got it
I'm ready and willin, you know I am you know I am
Come on and get it, you know that, I got it
I'm ready and willin,you know I am you know
You make the world go round, you make my love come down
You make the world go round, you make my love come down
You you make the world go round, you make my love come down
Make the world go round, you make my love come down

Verse
They'll be noone to hold us back, from seeking each and every fact
Just lovin each and everyday, a lifetime full of passion and play

So come on and get it, you know that, I got it
I'm ready and willin, you know I am you know I am
Come on and get it, you know that, I got it
I'm ready and willin,you know I am you know
You make the world go round, you make my love come down
You make the world go round, you make my love come down
You you make the world go round, you make my love come down
Make the world go round, you make my love come down
