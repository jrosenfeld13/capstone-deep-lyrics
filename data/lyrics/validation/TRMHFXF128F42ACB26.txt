Before You, I was always falling
Sometimes even crawling
With nothing to hold on to
Before You, I was searching for something
To make my life worth living
But nothing could satisfy
Before You, standing in Your glory
I just wanna thank You
For all You've done for me
Before You, I offer You my worship
Now I can stand forgiven and free
'Cause I'm not the man I used to be
Before You, I'm humbled by Your mercy
And staggered by Your beauty
Honored by Your love for me
Before You, the angels raise their anthem
And I will gladly join them
In lifting up my praise
Before You, standing in Your glory
I just wanna thank You
For all You've done for me
Before You, I offer You my worship
And I can stand forgiven and free
'Cause I'm not the man I used to be
Before You, oh, before You
Before You, standing in Your glory
I just wanna thank You
For all You've done for me
Before You, I offer You my worship
Now I can stand forgiven and free
'Cause I'm not the man I used to be
I lay down my life as an offering before You
Before You I lay down my life as an offering
I'm not the man I used to be before You
