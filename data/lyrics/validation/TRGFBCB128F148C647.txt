[Verse 1:]
Danger eyes are no surprise
In staying wise to you
Shady walks
And midnight stalks
Have showed me what to do

Kept my cool
This ain't no fool
You think you're messing with
I know how to keep you 'round
Cause I know where you been

You think that
They really want just you
(Better think again, better think again)
I'm the only one knows what to do

'Cause you've been bad
Baby, oh, so bad
Baby
And there's only one thing can be done

[Chorus:]
You need a little bit of this medicine
(Just a little touch up)
Mama's gonna give you some medicine
You need a little bit of this medicine
(Just a little touch up)
Mama's gonna give you some medicine

[Verse 2:]
Every time I think you're mine
You're up to somethin' new
I've done almost everything
To try to get to you

All my friends are just dead ends
In helpin' me alone
I just keep on wondering
What am I doing wrong?

There is only one thing left to try
(Do it again, do it again)
On this cure
I'm sure I can rely

Cause you've been bad
Baby, oh, so bad
And there's only one thing can be done

[Chorus:]
You need a little bit of this medicine
(Just a little bit touch up)
Mama's gonna give you some medicine
(Just a little touch up)
You need a little bit of this medicine
(Oh, my medicine)
Mama's gonna give you some medicine
(Mama's gonna give you some medicine)

Cause you've been bad, baby
Oh, you've been so bad
And there's only one thing can be done

[Bridge:]
Take your medicine
(Doctor's here)
Take your medicine
(The nurse is here)

Take your medicine
(Don't you wanna get cured?)
Take your medicine
(Take your medicine, baby)

Take your medicine
(Take your medicine, honey)
Take your medicine
(Oh, come on)

Take your medicine
(Go on and take it)
Take your medicine
(Go on and take it)

You gotta take it
If you wanna shake it
(Medicine)
You gotta take it
If you wanna shake it
(Medicine)

You gotta take
It if you wanna shake it
(Medicine)
You gotta take it
If you wanna shake it

You need a little bit of this medicine
(Mama's gonna give you some medicine)
Mama's gonna give you some medicine
(Hey, I got all the medicine)

You need a little bit of this medicine
(Mama's gonna give you a touch-up)
Mama's gonna give you some medicine
(Come on, baby, take your medicine)

You need a little bit of this medicine
(I got the cure)
Mama's gonna give you some medicine
(I got the cure)

You need a little bit of this medicine
(Mama's gonna give you some medicine)
Mama's gonna give you some medicine
(I got the cure)

You need a little bit of this medicine
(Oh, take your medicine)
Mama's gonna give you some medicine
(I got the cure, you know I do, okay)

You need a little bit of this medicine
(Oh, my medicine)
Mama's gonna give you some medicine
