Oh, wise one
If you knew the answer, why'd you ask the question?
Oh, wise one
If you're such a someone
Why do you give nothing to anyone?
You wiggle your way into me time and again
You love to speak your mind
But now it's fair to say I'm not open today
To have my heart twisted up, oh

Your blue suitcase is empty, hey, what's your wait?
Your blue suitcase is empty, hey, what's your wait?

Oh, wise man
How do you get high, man?
You must be self-absorbing
Oh, wise man, save me from your high, man
I can't afford another of your stuck up drug
My confidence says 'I am worth it today', so try and change it's mind
Kiss your sweet girl away
You've found your fate
Now you will know what lonely pays

Your blue suitcase is empty, hey, what's your wait?
Your blue suitcase is empty, hey, what's your wait?

Na na na na na, na na na na na, na na na
Na na na na na na, na na na na, na na na

Tell me, how does it feel to be so high above the clouds?
So tell me, how does it feel to be so high above the clouds?

And tell me how will it feel when no one cares what you're not around?

Your blue suitcase is empty, hey, what's your wait?
Your blue suitcase is empty, hey, what's your wait?
Your blue suitcase is empty, hey, what's your wait?
Your blue suitcase is empty, hey, what's your wait?
Your blue suitcase is empty, hey, what's your wait?
