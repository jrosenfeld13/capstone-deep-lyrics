I married my baby
Married her for myself
Then if I's gon' keep her
Don't want nobody else

Got to give an account
Just what
Whatcha do

Now depot agent
Don't tell me no lie
Did my baby stop here?
Did she keep on ride?

Got to give an account
Just what
Whatcha do

Now I hate to hear
Illinois Central blow
When my feet get tickled
Makes me wanna go

Got to give an account
Just what
Watcha do

When a man does workin'
Know he's doin' what's right
Some old lowdown rouster
Tryin' to steal his wife

Got to give an account
Just what
Watcha do

(piano & mandolin)

Now I got up this mornin'
Couldn't make no time
I didn't have no blues
Never thought up any rhymes

Got to give an account
Just what
Watcha do

Now take me, baby
Won't be mean no mo'
You can get all my lovin'
Let that black snake go

Got to give an account
Just what
Watcha you do

Now pause in the mo'nin'
Rag tied 'round her head
Ask to cook you a breakfast
Swears she's near goin' dead

Got to give an account
Just what
What you do
