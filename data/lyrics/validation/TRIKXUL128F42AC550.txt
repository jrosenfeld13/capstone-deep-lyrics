[Chorus]
Make the world go away
Get it off my shoulder
Say the things we used to say
And make the world, make it go away

[Verse 1]
Do you remember when you loved me
Before the world took you away
Well if you do, then forgive me
And make the world, make it go away

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now I'm sorry if I hurt you
Let me make it up to you day by day
And if you will please forgive me
And make the world, make it go away

[Chorus]
