This feels like some kind of gun
But not the kind for killing
This could be some kind of fun
A ground force of the willing
Debase the values we learn
Ten like an early warning
You let her healed when she heard
Slack run you till the morning

The revolutions at hand
Lets form a rock and roll band

We did our time overseas
Post rock defends the nation
Two years to do as we please
Fucked up got ambushed zipped in
I hate the sinner but love the sin
Some sin brings mass redemption
I cant remember what state Im in
Post Cold War blues take the toll
Good friends but not quite soldiers
Boredom does good for the soul
One hand will wash the other
I lost my life on the Autobahn
Almost two inches closer
I bled to death on a neighbors lawn

The revolutions at hand
Lets form a rock and roll band

We did our time overseas
Post rock defends the nation
We learn for your expertise
Fucked up got ambushed zipped in
Cant play the play from the heart
Sing through the headphones screaming
Dont stray too far from your art
New Jersey sings like a bird
Not that exhausted really
I punched a cop for a girl
Apologized profusely
Lets drink until theres a world again
And talk of new beginnings
Lets not forget all the things weve been

The revolutions at hand
Lets form a rock and roll band

The revolutions at hand
Lets form a rock and roll band
