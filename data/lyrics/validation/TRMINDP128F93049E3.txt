I'm an escapist
Yup, it's time to get away
The day like any other
Outside forces conspire to smother
The flames of desire
Raging like wild brushfire
It's so easy to inundate
Your true state with one full of compromise
Content with the comforts 'til you realize
The size of the fascade you place before God
So just how do you set it straight?
And capture what you were initially after?
Yet another question for which you lack an answer
Can you outpace disaster if you run faster?
Not carrying the world's weight
Or a seemingly equivalent amount
Deep within can be a hard fought bout
So time to be refocus
Escape, be without, and I'm out

Yeah it's time to get away (go ahead and just get away)
Yup it's time to get away (it's time to get away)
Yeah it's time to get away (go ahead and just get away)
Yup it's time to get away (today it's time to get away)

I'm an escapist
It's time to get away
From bright lights and towers
Leeches, vampires, and those who devour
All of the nectar and take the very essence of the flower
So now it's time to motivate
Far away from the weeds and fields of barren seeds
To cultivate the mind state that you need
And later assess any mess and make progress
And no, no need to set a date
'cause this process occurs and is constant
See, life can be overwhelming from the onset
But there's paradise here for the one who truly wants it
So go, don't just contemplate
All the possibilities and what-ifs
Or become numb, drowning sorrorws by the fifths
Pour the pain down the drain
And make the scenery shift

Go ahead and just get away (yeah it's time to get away)
Today it's time to get away (yup it's time to get away)
Be an escapist, go ahead and just get away (go ahead and just get away)
Today it's time to get away (today it's time to get away)
