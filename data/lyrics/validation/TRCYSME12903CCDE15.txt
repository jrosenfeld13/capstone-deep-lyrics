[Verse 1]
Fast and furious, we ride the universe
To carve a road for us that slices every curve in sight
We accelerate, no time to hesitate
This load will detonate, whoever would contend its right

[Pre-Chorus]
Born to lead at breakneck speed
With high octane we're spitting flames

[Chorus]
Freewheel burning
Freewheel burning

[Verse 2]
On we catapult, we're thrusting to the hilt
Unearthing every fault, go headlong into any dare
We don't accept defeat, we never will retreat
We blaze with scorching heat, obliterations everywhere

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Look before you leap has never been the way we keep, our road is free
Charging to the top and never give in never stops the way to be
Hold on to the lead with all your will and then concede
You'll find there's life with victory on high

[Verse 3]
Look before you leap has never been the way we keep, our road is free
Charging to the top and never give in never stops the way to be
Hold on to the lead with all your will and then concede
You'll find there's life with victory
With victory on high

[Chorus x2]

[Outro]
Something is burning
