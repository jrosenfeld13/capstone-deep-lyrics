Call me up and tell me you love me
No matter the hour or stars that're above me
Just call me up
And tell me you love me
Come on
When you feel like hope is gone
And there's no one to depend on
When you feel like you need a friend
Stick by you 'til the end yeah
All you gotta do is
Call me up
When you feel like a creepy doll
And no one loves you at all
And you want to say goodbye to them all
Don't forget that it's a lonely world
All you gotta do is
Call me up and tell me you love me
No matter the hour or stars that're above me
Just call me up and tell me you love me
When the world turns its back on you
And it leaves you sad and lonely
Please do not do what I know you're gonna do
When no one hears your screams
And the world has smashed your dreams
If you feel that you can't go on
Put your hope into a love song
All you gotta do is call me up
And tell me you love me
No matter the hour or stars that're above me
Just call me up and tell me you love me
Please don't hang up
