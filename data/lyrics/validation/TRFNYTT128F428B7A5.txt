Feelings of rejection, no false hopes or misconception
Just a burning in my head and in my heart
Promises were made, friendship lost along the way
A twisted path of lies, deception from the start
The future lay in your hands with talk of stardom, all your plans
We had our dreams, high hopes, we trusted you
But the decisions that you made
And the staring role you played
Quickly made us realize what we must do
And I gave my trust to you
Got stabbed in the back and left for dead
Why'd you do the things you do?
With all the lies, deceit, wrong things got said
Never expected this of you
Should've known better than to do what I did
I was blind and you were shrewd
Had me eating from your hand like a naive little kid
Laid down my guard wound up screwed!
Betrayed!
There comes a time in all our lives when quickly we must learn from our mistakes
Now trusting no one, guard held high
Second guessing all the chances that he takes
We all must learn to use the term my friend
To those deserving of the phrase
Avoiding the pain and all the rage from knowing
That you've been Betrayed
Never again will I trust you
Left for dead knife buried in my back
I wish I would have knew
Your sneakiness, plan of attack
This is what you do
Lying, cheating, and all that crap
No chance for number two
With my guard held high and my wall built strong
Next time around I'll screw you!
There comes the time in all of our lives
When quickly we must learn from our mistakes
Not knowing why we made them, just the outcome
And the feelings they create
Whether it's sadness, loss of trust, death, pain, forgiveness
Love, joy, sex, happiness, or fate
It's one of these, the biggest one, that I really hate
It's a feeling you get when a trust so deep
A trust between friends has been broken
And you know you got played, it's that feeling...
You straight up been Betrayed!
Betrayed!
Betrayed!
Betrayed!
Betrayed!
Straight up been Betrayed!
Betrayed!
There comes the time in every life
When quickly we must learn from our mistakes
Betrayed!
Now trusting no one
Guard held high, second guessing
All the chances that he takes...
Betrayed!
