A thousand years of sleep
I miss the rising sun
Wish I could change this
Always the same
With each one, every night
I watch as the light
Slowly fades from their eyes
Ohh so long
Long ago
What he took
Then gave to me
There is no end
It's not what I thought it'd be
Left drained, felt impaired
The eyes drew me inside
Hypnotic waltz from his stare
Letting go
Ohh I still love
With the night will arrive
The cobblestones
Light misty air
The brief caress
Our sweet affair
Ohh so long
Long ago
I was just like any of you
A Simple Man
There was nothing I could do
But I've grown so tired
There's no need to hold on
If you hear me
Just wanna be
Be the man I was
(Lead Keys)
Please believe
If I could
I would change
One thousand years
And still I am
Looking like the day
This all began
Ohh so long
Long ago
What he took
Then gave to me
Take it back
And give back the man in me
I'm going on my way
I'm going where there's no desire
Goin' on where I'll stay higher than now
I want what you have taken
My life has been forsaken
Many nights I've lain torn, I'm breaking down
Why all this began
What's there to care for
Fade away
