Well it's so hard to face
That in this day and age
Somebody's race can trigger somebody's rage

And somebody's preference
Can drive some total stranger
To make somebody somehow feel the wrath of their anger

Why were we put here?
What for? We're unsure
We sure weren't put here to hate
Be racist, be sexist
Be bigots, be sure;
We won't stand for your hate

Now why so cut and dry
A simple concept missed
Give tolerance a try
This confusion still exists ignorant mongers
No area's gray
Couldn't be any wronger in this age and day

Why were we put here?
What for? we're unsure
We sure weren't put here to hate
Be racist, be sexist
Be bigots, be sure;
We won't stand for your hate
Get that straight

Now how far have we come?
How come there still are some
Who won't let some
March to the beat of a different drum
To face it, it's so hard
You must be on your guard
It's not okay
And you're not free to be a different way

Why were we put here?
What for? we're unsure
We sure weren't put here to hate
Be racist, be sexist
Be bigots, be sure;
We won't stand for your hate

Let's try to erase it, it's time that we face it
If we don't, then who will? Shame on us
Let's try to erase it, it's time that we face it
Let's face it, the time is upon us
Let's try to erase it, it's time that we face it
If we don't, then who will? Shame on us
Let's try to erase it, it's time that we face it
Let's face it, the time is upon us
