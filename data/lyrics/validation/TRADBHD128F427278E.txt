One more day within your shelter
Just one more day and I'll get cold
One more second and I'll break up
With what I hold

So cruel
It's so cruel
So cruel
But nothing ever
Nothing ever moves

One more day and it was over
One of these days and I would pass
Just one more day and I could vanish
From here at last

So cruel
It's so cruel
So cruel

So cruel
It's so cruel
It's so cruel
It's so cruel
Nothing ever really seems to move
