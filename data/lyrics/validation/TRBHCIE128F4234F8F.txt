I come around, but I don't see ya
It's kinda hard when you're already gone
My eyes are numb; bloodshot and heavy
The voice's silent but approaching me soon

He's got your name, he's got your number
Just one more slip and he'll be dragging you on
I feel the pain, oh i see the answers
The voices ring out like the siren of song

You're gone, when you stop believing
It's hard to sleep at the end of the day
Move on, don't try to get even
Looking hard just to find a new end
Cause it's hard to die
When you're already dead

Just when I can't quite remember
Just when I can't quite recall
The day we met upon a cold December
The day we met and I started to fall

You're gone, when you stop believing
It's hard to sleep at the end of the day
Move on, don't try to get even
Looking hard just to find a new end
Cause it's hard to die
When you're already dead
