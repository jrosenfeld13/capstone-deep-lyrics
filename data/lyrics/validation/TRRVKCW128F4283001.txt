So you come dripping from the hive
Glittering as you arrive
High half as long and twice as bright
See you burning from both sides (from both sides)
See you burning from both sides (from both sides)

You come slipping down the slide
Dragging me by your side
Phony colors in your eyes
Soul's obscene but I don't mind (I don't mind)
You're so obscene but I don't mind (don't mind)
Yea yea yea yea yea yea

You come whipping through my life
Flipping out like some old wife
Your syringe mouth is open wide
You go insane I go inside
