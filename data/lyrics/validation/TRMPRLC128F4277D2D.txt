2.4 million sold
A tender in your heart
Why can't it be my way?
Jealous note won't strike well
Given to sell
Both sides of the highway
Black man to the hilt
Plastered off white
This is where the sides change
Mouths shut, hurry on
The media protector
Hook him hard, pull him sidestage
Pull him sidestage
