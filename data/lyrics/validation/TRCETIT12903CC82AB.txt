Houses are spread out too far
Too many trees and too many cars
Everyone works or everyone hides
Too many birds in suburban skies
Too many burnouts, too many jocks
Middle class scumbags, think they're smart
They go to school and comb their hair
And always have the right clothes to wear
Suburbia
Go hangout at the Livingston Mall
Nothing to buy, too many stores
Too many joggers on the streets
Gonna run 'em over in my beat up car
Go for a walk through the center of town
Or hop in the car and cruise around
Mow the lawn, take out the trash
Go in mom's pocketbook and take her cash
Suburbia
