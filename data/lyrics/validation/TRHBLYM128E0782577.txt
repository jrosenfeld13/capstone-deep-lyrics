In my imagination running wild
I feel the time has passed us by
Staying in my mind all the time
Just like the endless beat, that beat
That flows in time, the maze of life is so difficult
I doubt what the children to run and fight
Respecter's in the eyes of the beholder who sees that
Fun that will come when the sun shines
Together living in unity there's no need to fight
The rough society
I know the time will be here
Again when the chances are thin
And you know it will lead to the end

I keep this dream in my memory
In my mind for a long time you see
I hope the day will come sometimes when
I know the stories to be told
We'll tell the stories to the young and old
Both children who grow together in school
Oh now I wish the time we will come that the dreams
That I dream will last for a long time

Pull me up - pull me up
Pull me up - pull me up
Pull me up - pull me up

Oh I feel so magical, that I feel the temptation running
Through my veins. Well if together in happiness and
I know the time, the time will come to this
As long as there holding on
Holding
Holding
Holding
Holding

Well imagine yourself in a large open space
No communication and no one to raise for you to be in this predicament in
Time
We'll leave our imaginations
Open wide so before the floods
The storms may raise
There should be a bride today
Well on that day we shall live together as one, happily under the sun
