[Bridge]
Love me, love me, long time
Love me, love me (love me)
Love me, love me, long time
Love me, love me, long (bang bang)

[Verse 1: Mr. Eon]
I spit dumber slang and Clubber Lang
Her toosh ain't the same just like a rubber band
Prepare to bareback, Eon champ, rare facts
To fucking unknowns, he still be getting a share of that
I'm too high, making these whores melt
Bring the pent undergarments, you would shit yourself
My last five rhymes, catch 'em by lines
So in the New York Times, in the city writing rhymes
High and Mighty elusive
Authenticate jerseys, my DJ wear Nike exclusives
Her pint sauce gained her a peep with the light sauce
Walking on stilts, must look like a high rise
Score the subversive with perfect cursive
Man ain't shit versus his penmanship
Creating death traps using 40 wet naps
Have him coming 40 days soon, he better get back

[Hook 1]
You a homecoming queen turned heroine fiend
Make 'em go (ahh) so you know when I cream
You just out the cradle discovering anal
Make 'em go (ohh) to all my [?] fables
You a porn star diva in g-string cheetah
Make 'em go (ahh) when I'm eating shaved beavers
Thigh high guarders, asking for it harder
Make 'em go (ooh) call me your fucking father

[Verse 2: R.A. the Rugged Man]
Ayyo, I'm ugly as shit, the Elephant Man
John Merrick, the modern day Rocky Deniss
We cracking sack like we black rappers, I'm hillbilly
Horse back-riding, I drive tractors, I'm ass backwards
In the farmland with the one-arm man
I don't get no pussy, I fuck my hand
Caution, this ain't recommended for the weak hearted
Special ED student, I'm half retarded
When I was banned from the Jive office
I brought a chick with a two foot vibrator up to Rawkus
Rugged Man, the autobiography
The pornography, dirty version of Dostoyevsky
My little brothers and sisters, they both wheel-chaired up
They can't talk, can't see and they can't stand up
They might prank-call your house, make noise and hang up
Get excited, fall out they beds and get banged up

[Hook 2]
You a homecoming queen turned heroine fiend
Make 'em go (ahh) so you know when I cream
Thigh high guarders, asking for it harder
Make 'em go (ooh) call me your fucking father

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: Mr. Eon]
I'm masturbating in my cellar
Fantasizing about a threesome with Sarah Michelle Gellar and Helen Keller
Didn't like Helen, but how was I going to tell her?
Stuck my balls in her nose and knew she could smell 'em
I'm still shaving box in her old age, full blown AIDS
More mistakes than what's a good vomit [?]
And now I'm hitting skanks dressing scandaly clad
Asking me to be their fucking fantasy dad

[Verse 4: R.A. the Rugged Man]
Born to be bad, white rhymer, night rider
I'm the male version of Elvira
At the diner, finger popping waitresses
Fake lyricist-es, stick my dick in their mouths
We take pisses, my dick is eight inches
At least that's what I say to bitches
Even if I added two extra fake inches
Bitch love me, 2001, still dirty crusty

[Hook 1]
