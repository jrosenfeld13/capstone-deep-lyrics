I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you say
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down
But wait...
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around and say...
That it's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late
I'd take another chance, take a fall, take a shot for
You
And I need you like a heart needs a beat
(But that's nothing new)
I loved you with a fire red, now it's turning blue
And you say
I'm sorry like an angel, heavens let me think it was for
You
And I'm afraid
That it's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late (too late)
It's too late (too late)
Ohh, it's too late to apologize
I said
Ooooh
It's too late...
I'm holding your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground...
