Even though it's hard to hear the truth
It's every little thing that makes you move
And there is a reflection in the mirror
You don't believe
And darling it's so hard to understand
I wish that I could fix what you feel instead
Baby, why'd you do that, I can see through that
Give it a chance

And you can't just disappear
I'm begging you come on out, come on out
Promise that the coast is clear

(chorus)
I don't mind the chase
Baby, you're lost out there in a different place
And I can't get to you
I don't mind the chase
Baby, you're lost out there in a different place
And I can't get to you
But I'll do what I have to

Every little piece you pick apart
You've hidden in a corner of your heart
And there is a reflection in the mirror
That you don't see
And darling, it's an awful lot to give
A memory you chase but you can't relive
Baby, it's supposed to, baby you're close to
Letting me in

And you can't just disappear
I'm begging you come on out, come on out
Promise that the coast is clear

Chorus

Oh, you never could quiet honestly explain
How much he means to you
You're doing everything they ask you to
There's a part of you, you wish you knew
And every escape you thought you could make
No, you did not think it would show
Darling it was way too much
Way to slow

Chorus
