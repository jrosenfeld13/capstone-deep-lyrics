How can you forget
Moments in the moonlight
Moments of a love that used to be...

As I stare in space
I still see your face
And once again I'm lost
In your thrilling embrace

Though the spell is gold
Somewhere in the moonlight
Memories of your kiss will live anew
And we'll meet, my love
As I keep dreaming of
Moments in the moonlight with you!
