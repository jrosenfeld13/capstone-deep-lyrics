She's always funny in the morning
She isn't always funny in the night
Once she gets a couple of drinks in
She's probably gonna tell you
You ain't doing anything right
And then you'll roll your eyes
And then you'll probably fight

She mainly trades in adorations
She gets pretty wasted at the celebrations
Benefits and at building dedications

It's always sunny in the morning
Sucks around the ending of the night
When she storms out of the restaurant
I think you're supposed to chase her to the lights

One boy hits her like a tambourine
The other dissing me on her message machine

Magazines and daddy issues
I know you're pretty pissed
I hope you'll still let me kiss you

(Magazines and daddy issues
I know you're pretty pissed
I hope you'll still let me kiss you)

One boy calls while the other texts
She's got boys on board and boys on deck
Second dates and lipstick tissues
New York is pretty heavy
Girl, I hope it doesn't crush you

(Magazines and daddy issues
I know you're pretty pissed
I hope you'll still let me kiss you)
