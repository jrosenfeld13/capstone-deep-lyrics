[Intro]
I'm comin' up, so you better you better get this party started
I'm comin' up, so you better you better get this party started

[Verse 1]
Get this party started on a Saturday night
Everybody's waitin' for me to arrive
Sendin' out the message to all of my friends
We'll be lookin' flashy in my Mercedes Benz
I got lotsa style, check my gold diamond rings
I can go for miles, if you know what I mean

[Chorus]
I'm comin' up (so you better you better get this party started)
I'm comin' up
I'm comin' up so you better you better get this party started

[Verse 2]
Pumpin' up the volume, breakin' down to the beat
Cruisin' through the west side, we'll be checkin' the scene
Boulevard is freakin' as I'm comin' up fast
I'll be burnin' rubber, you'll be kissin' my (whoo)
Pull up to the bumper and get out of the car
License plate says Stunner #1 Superstar

[Chorus]
I'm comin' up (so you better you better get this party started)
I'm comin' up
I'm comin' up so you better you better get this party started

[Verse 3]
Makin' my connection as I enter the room
Everybody's chillin' as I set up the groove
Pumpin' up the volume with this brand new beat
Everybody's dancin', and their dancin' for me
I'm your operator, you can call anytime
I'll be your connection to the party line
To the party line

[Chorus]
I'm comin' up (so you better you better get this party started)
I'm comin' up
I'm comin' up
I'm comin' up
