Lean on me devil; I'm a soul within your fist
I never feel alone when I'm wrapped around your wrist
3 years of solitude still knocking at my door
How I used to feel the pain. I won't feel it anymore

I witnessed the waking of the dead
3 years of solitude with you inside my head

Let's start a fire. Feed our love to the abyss
I never thought a friend would give a heart attack like this
Stay right behind me like a shadow on the floor
I've tasted evil, girl. I won't feel it anymore
3 years of solitude. 3 years of solitude

3 years of solitude with you
A feeling that stretched across the red, white, and blue
You've got big plans to find the perfect god
To see a religion that's more than meets the eye

This is the final moment with you
This is the last I swore it. It's true
The is the waking of the dead
I witnessed the waking of the dead
3 years of solitude with you inside my head
You've got big plans to find the perfect god
To see a religion that's more than meets the eye
