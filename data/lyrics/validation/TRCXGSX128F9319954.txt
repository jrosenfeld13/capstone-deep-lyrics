[Verse 1]
I bet you dont know how much I love you so
Ive been trying hard
Not to let it show
I bet you dont know how much I need you now
I know what to say
But I dont know how

[Pre-Chorus]
And my love keeps coming on
And coming on
And getting strong
What else can I do?

[Chorus]
I bet you dont know how I really feel
So let me prove my love to you

[Bridge]
Time after time
I find myself dreaming of you
Ive never felt this way before
This feeling is so new

[Pre-Chorus]
You make my love keep coming on
And coming on
And getting strong
What else can I do?

[Chorus]
I bet you dont know how I really feel
So let me prove my love to you

[Outro]
Let me prove my love to you
Let me prove my love to you
Let me prove my love to you
Let me prove my love to you
