"I saw you on TV Pablo and you were dressed like a girl
And I thought I must come down and take care of you
I must come down and rescue you"
Oh, my God! She's lost it completely and I don't know what to say
If you didn't know the direction away from me  you just found the way

I don't believe in Jesus Christ and I don't believe in God
And I don't believe in anything that makes you wanna save me
I need a break and I need a vacation
Take me away from the civilisation
This year has been so rough to me
I do believe I've had enough, you see

I need time to spend with the ones I love and I need to get away from you
'Cause I need love, love, love, oh, I need love
Oh, I need love, love, love, oh, I need love

"I saw you on TV Pablo. I called my friends right away
And I said turn on the TV, now, turn it on now
Watch Billie the Vision on the television
I've never heard about you before
But I must say you're responsible for the way I feel
'Cause I found a happy face in the mirror today"

I need time to spend with the ones I love and I need to spend time with you
'Cause I need love, love, love, oh, I need love
Oh, I need love, love, love, oh, I need love

And I didn't ask for forgiveness, so there is no use to forgive
I didn't ask for another letter from you. It's been taking away my will to live
I need a break and I need a vacation
Take me away from the civilisation
This year has been so rough to me
I do believe I've had enough, you see

I need time to spend with the ones I love and I need to get away from you
'Cause I need love, love, love, oh, I need love
Oh, I need love, love, love, oh, I need love

I need time to spend with the ones I love
I need time to spend with the ones I love and I need to spend time with you
'Cause I need love, love, love, oh, I need love (Oh, I need love)
Oh, I need love, love, love, oh, I need love (So much love)
Oh, I need love, love, love, oh, I need love (Oh, I need love)
Oh, I need love, love, love, oh, I need love
