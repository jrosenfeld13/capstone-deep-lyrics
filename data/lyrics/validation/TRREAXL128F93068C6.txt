The way I see it
Just ain't your way
You won't listen
To what I have to say
I won't tolerate
The things you want me to see
Say you're here to help
But you just fuck me

No more lies and deceit

Its not our fault
We are this way
We all have our views
And different things to say
You judge me, I judge you
Nothing will change
What are we to do?
