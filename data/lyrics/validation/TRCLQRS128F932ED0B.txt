Now is the day of salvation
Now is the time to be set free
And it's yours for the taking
The moment you believe
Now is the day of salvation
Now is the time to be set free
And there is no condemnation
The moment you believe
Like the man on the cross next to Jesus
Who had lived a life of crime
It wasn't too late for forgiveness
Jesus promised he'd wake up in paradise
Paul and Silas were singing in prison
When at midnight the doors opened wide
The jailer asked what must I do to be saved
They said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
