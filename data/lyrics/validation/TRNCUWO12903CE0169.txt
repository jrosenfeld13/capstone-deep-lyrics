[Verse 1: Playboy Tre]
Sometimes I like them trapped in Hollywood
Cause all the lames that used to get play
Nowadays they think they cool cause they got brace and shades, but they aint
Just because you went and bought you some glasses
Dont change the fact that real niggas whippin your asses
Oh no, here we go, he a lame, and I know, that he knows
We [?] and get the fuck out the store
When I come, on the block they used to call that nigga [?]
No he called himself Pistolgrip, gone with that
And then you got the ones to get a position
And try to talk down like he under beneath them
Better get a rubber [?], back to the real you
He used to kiss ass and I bet he still do

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Can somebody please tell me where the hell is [?] at?
He used to burn CDs and sell them at the [?]
But now he got a deal and signed a record contract
Then he cut his wrists off [?]
Me and Tre dont fuck with them [?]
We just fuck that girls and drop em off, without no bus fare
We on the same planet and we breathe the same air
So why the hell you actin like you aint from round here?
Quit actin like a fuck pop, you who nigga, you home boy
You shoe triggers and toe toys, but your respect is so void
And everybody say you actin scary now
Cause you aint with your boys no more, you roll with Paramount
