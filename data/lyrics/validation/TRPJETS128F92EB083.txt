Summer was meant for a hay ride
Fall was meant for stroll
Spring was made for an Easter parade
But winter, winter, winter
What a Night!
What a Night!
Splendid and serene
Journeying where
There's a chill in the air
Through this wintry scene
In the chill, what a thrill
Children's eyes are bright
Searching the sky
For a sleigh flying by
That just might come tonight
Jingle, jingle!
Watch out for Kris Kringle
Feel your noses tingle
Hands and feet are warn
Better hurry
Grandma starts to worry
She thinks every flurry
Turns into a storm
What a Night!
What a Night!
Now we're on our way
I'll bring the cocoa
And you''ll bring the ho! ho! ho!
Up and away!
What a Night!
What a Night!
What a Night!
For a flight, on a sleigh
Jingle! Jingle!
Watch out for Kris Kringle
Feel your noses tingle
Hands and feet are warn
Better hurry
Grandma starts to worry
She thinks every flurry
Turns into a storm
What a Night!
What a Night!
Now we're on our way
I'll bring the cocoa
And you'll bring the ho! ho! ho!
Up and away!
What a Night!
What a Night!
What a Night!
For a flight, on a sleigh
