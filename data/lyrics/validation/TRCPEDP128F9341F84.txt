Somebody, somebody's gettin' outa bed
Somebody, somebody's gettin' herself dressed
Somebody, somebody combin' back her hair
Somebody, somebody dancin' down the stairs

And on the TV and in magazines
She sees the people she would like to be

Somebody, somebody steals away her dreams
Somebody, somebody - race is all they see
Somebody, somebody takes away her pride
Somebody, somebody don't know wrong from right

Now they have taken everything she owns
How did she ever get this far from home?

See how we are
There ain't no four-leaf clover
In the blink of an eye
Ev'rything changes
We gotta start all over

Down in that deep muddy river (so long ago)
Blood is much thicker than water (the angels know)
Love is the ocean we swim in (so long ago)
Carry us to our beginning (the angels know)

Somebody, somebody takes away our name
Somebody, somebody tell me who I am
Somebody, somebody testify for love
Somebody, somebody where are you tonight?

Down in that deep muddy river (so long ago)
Blood is much thicker than water (the angels know)
She hears a voice sweetly singing (so long ago)
Carry us to our beginning (the angels know)
