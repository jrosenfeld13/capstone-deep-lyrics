[Verse 1]
I can't wait, wanna see how this night is gonna be
Just a touch away from this feeling that is here to stay
We can make it last forever, baby
Our love will stand the test of time
And in the middle of our world
I'll be waiting for you to be all mine

[Chorus]
We're walking on sunshine
In the middle of the night
And it feels like I'm somewhere above the sky

[Verse 2]
Take my hand and close your eyes
Say the sweet little things that make me cry
Catch my tears with a kiss
These special moments do exist
We can make it last forever, baby
Our love will stand the test of time
And in the middle of our world
I'll be waiting for you to be all mine

[Chorus]
We're walking on sunshine
In the middle of the night
And it feels like I'm somewhere above the sky

[Bridge]
Let's take a chance, and try love baby
No, I'm not kidding now
Until you tell me that you'll be in my life, until the end of time

[Chorus]
We're walking on sunshine
In the middle of the night
And it feels like I'm somewhere above the sky
