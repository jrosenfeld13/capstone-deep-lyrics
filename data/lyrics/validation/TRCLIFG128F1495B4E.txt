He said it's not okay
For them to come into
And take it all away
Another dead end sign

She brough a brand new day
But they stole it
And took it all away
Another dead end sign

Found three more reasons to live
And it changed the way I make my stand
Found three more reasons to live
And it changed the way I make my stand
Found three more reasons to keep inside

And to think is to feel
And to know is to hear
And to have it so see

Will you be there when I'm in need?
Through my selfishness and greed
