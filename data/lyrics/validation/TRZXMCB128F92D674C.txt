And it was the final straw
Though I never knew just what he saw
Never underestimate
The power of...
Never underestimate
The power of...

He could bring me to my knees
Though I never saw just what he sees
I was callin' out for him
He never turned
I was callin' out for him
I never learned

Never... Ever...
Never underestimate
The power of...
Never... Ever...
Never underestimate
The power of...

Saw you walking down the street
Those Velcro sneakers on your feet
You were walking faster than
I could run
I was walking in the shade
And you, the sun

Now we can watch it fall
'Cause they built it up to tall
Now I'm sinking lower than
All my tears
Sinking lower than
All your fears

Never... Ever...
Never underestimate
The power of...
Never... Ever...
Never underestimate
The power of...

Mmmm... Mmmm...

Boy you've got a lot to learn
Wait until it is my turn
And you stand ever

Never... Ever...
Never underestimate
The power of...
Never... Ever...
Never underestimate
The power of...
Never underestimate
The power of...
Never underestimate
The power of...
