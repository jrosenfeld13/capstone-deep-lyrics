Keep your powder dry and warm
Thru the coming darkest storm
All the fear that's sent your way
Thru your eyes you might wash away
When you can
Still your lantern's strong and bright
Even thru the darkest night
All those paper tigers
All their lies they might have sold you
Might be wasted on
One so young that you're old again
She walks out thru the wind and the rain uh-huh

They can't give you all those things
No pot of gold no big brass ring
Stay on the road for the night has come
Perhaps at dawn we will be like one again

All those paper tigers
All the lies they might have been sold you
Might be wasted on
One so young that you're old again
Sylvia walks out thru the wind and the rain uh-huh

Still the shock rips you thru every nerve
In the bell jar nothing can be heard

I would walk with you
I would talk with you
I would do anything that would get you thru
Draw the line for you
Take the fifth for you
I would stand on a bridge and jump off it too

All those paper tigers
All the lies they might have told you
Might be wasted on
One so young that you're old again
All those paper tigers
All the lies your mother told you
Might be wasted on
One so young that you're old again
She walks out thru the wind and the rain uh-huh
