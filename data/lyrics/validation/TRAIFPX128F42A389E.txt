Sunlight beats down hard here
Count the cracks in the ground
And we sleep through days of flood and fire
At night we fly above this town

Now we're coming down
Now we're coming down
We're coming down

At night I dream of the hummingbird
Feel the beatings of its wings
And if you only had one choice my dear
Would you fly or would you sing

Now we're coming down
Now we're coming down
We're coming down

And in a year of new beginnings dear
How do we write the end?

Here she comes
Here she comes
The hummingbird
The hummingbird
The hummingbird
