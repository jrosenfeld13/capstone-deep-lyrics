Count on me
Wherever you go, I'm gonna be beside you
Wherever you go, I'll be there
Whenever you get lonely
I'm only steps away, so count on me

Whenever you go, my heart is going with you
Whatever you do, I'll do too
I'll be right there beside you
I find you

Don't you know that I'll be there
Sharing all your tears and laughter?
I'll be there
Just call my name and I'll be there
With you, now and ever after, I'll be there

Count on me
Whenever you're sad I'm gonna make you happy
No matter how bad, I'll be there
And I'll go through it with you
So if you need me, you can count on me, oh yeah

I'll be there
I'll be right there beside you
I'll try to

Just say my name and I'll be there
Sharing all your tears and laughter
I'll be there
Just call my name and I'll be there
With you, now and ever after, I'll be there

Count on me
When everything is getting rough, girl
Count on me
Just call my name and I'll be there
Girl, you know you're such a tough one, I'll be there

Count on me
Wherever you go I'm gonna be beside you
Wherever you go, I'll be there
Oh, I'll be there, I'll be there
You can count on me
