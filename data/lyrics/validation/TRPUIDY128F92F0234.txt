Melody day what have I done
Now our hearts are locked up tight again
And when I pray it's all begun
Then when you smile it melts away again
Melody day where have you gone
All the hope I had is gone away
And what we had has come undone
And when you smile it melts away again

Easy!
Easy!
Easy!
Easy!

Melody day what have I done
Now our hearts are locked up tight again
And when I pray it's all begun
And when you smile it melts away again
Tell them
Tell them I always knew why
So long
So long to say goodbye

Easy!
Easy!
Easy!
Easy!
