[Verse 1]
Now I'm aiming for Heaven
But probably wind up down in Hell
Where, upon this altar
I will hang my guilt-ridden head
But it's time I'll take, before I begin
Three sheets to the wind, three sheets to the wind
Yeah, it's time I'll take, before I begin
Three sheets to the wind, three sheets to the wind

[Chorus]
Rebels are we
Though heavy our hearts shall always be
And no ball or chain, no prison shall keep
We're the rebels of the sacred heart
I said, no ball or chain, no prison shall keep
We're the rebels of the sacred heart

[Verse 2]
Terrified of the open road
Yeah, where it leads, you never know
But rest assured, he'll be on you back
Yeah, the Holy Ghost through his tongues in black
As the band dog howls and the young girl cries
The blessed virgin in her proud dad's eye
The albatross hangin' round your neck
Is the cross you bear for your sins he bleeds

[Chorus]
Rebels are we
Though heavy our hearts shall always be
And no ball or chain no prison shall keep
We're the rebels of the sacred heart
I said no ball or chain no prison shall keep
We're the rebels of the sacred heart

[Verse 3]
Genuflect all you refugees who fled the land
Now on guilt you kneel
And say a prayer for those left behind
From beyond the pale, to the northern sky
So you saved your shillings and your last six pence
Cause in God's name they built a barbed wire fence
Be glad you sailed for a better day
But don't forget, there'll be hell to pay

[Chorus]
Rebels are we
Though heavy our hearts shall always be
And no ball or chain no prison shall keep
We're the rebels of the sacred heart
I said no ball or chain no prison shall keep
We're the rebels of the sacred heart

[Bridge]
Resurrection, no protection, all things life must be
And no ball or chain no prison shall keep
We`re the rebels of the sacred heart

[Verse 4]
Now bless me father for I have sinned
But it's the same old story again, and again, and again
Ah well, such is the bread of an everyday life
From mornin' to noon to the shadowless night
Ah well, such is the bread of an everyday life
From mornin' to noon to the shadowless night

[Chorus]
Rebels are we
Though heavy our hearts shall always be
And no ball or chain no prison shall keep
We're the rebels of the sacred heart
I said no ball or chain no prison shall keep
We're the rebels of the sacred heart
