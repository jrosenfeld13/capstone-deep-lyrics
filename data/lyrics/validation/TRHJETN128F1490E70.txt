Somebody bring me back to the beginning
A place as nice as any place to start
That's where I must have misplaced my opinion
I wasn't sure where I was headed I was following my heart

In the beginning I'm recalling
Thinking I thought I knew it all
And I think I thought I knew a lot
Now I know I knew so little

So bring me back to where and when
I was convinced I could go up against whatever came along
Bring me back and I'll bring back what I've learned since
Lately I'm convinced in the beginning I was wrong

In the beginning I'm recalling
Thinking I thought I knew it all
And I think I thought I knew a lot
Now I know I knew so little
As time progressed
I've reassessed I know that now I know at best
It isn't all or nothing
It's somewhere I know in the middle

I know more - I know
Now then I knew
Then I know I know
Now I know I know
Then I knew less
Than I thought so

I know more - I know
Now then I knew
Then I know I know now I know
Then I knew less
Than I thought so

In the beginning I'm recalling
Thinking I thought I knew it all
And I think I thought I knew a lot
Now I know I knew so little
As time progressed, I've reassessed
I know that now I know at best
It isn't all or nothing
It's somewhere I know in the middle
