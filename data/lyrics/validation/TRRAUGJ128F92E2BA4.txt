I see you standin' there
Your long and golden hair
I'd like to climb the stairs
And taste your crooked heart

That's where I wanna be
I feel you under my thumb
That's where I wanna be
I feel you under my thumb

I feel your sweet caress
Your power overwhelms
Yeah, I'd like to love you
Where you stand

And what you don't know
Is what you might regret
When I show my fangs
And taste your sweet desire

That's where I wanna be
I feel you under my thumb
That's where I wanna be
I feel you under
That's where I wanna be
I feel you under my thumb
That's where I wanna be
I feel you under my thumb

[Instrumental break]

That's where I wanna be
I feel you under my thumb
That's where I wanna be
I feel you
That's where I wanna be
I feel you under my thumb
That's where I wanna be
I feel you under my thumb
