[Verse 1]
I'm writing you to catch you up on places I've been
And you held this letter
Probably got excited, but there's nothing else inside it

[Pre-Chorus]
Didn't have a camera by my side this time
Hoping I would see the world through both my eyes
Maybe I will tell you all about it when
I'm in the mood to lose my way with words

[Verse 2]
Today, skies are painted colors of a cowboy cliche
And strange how clouds that look like mountains in the sky
Are next to mountains anyway

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
But let me say
You should have seen that sunrise
With your own eyes
It brought me back to life
You'll be with me next time I go outside
Just no more 3x5s

[Bridge]
I guess you had to be there
Guess you had to be with me

[Verse 3]
Today I finally overcame
Trying to fit the world inside a picture frame
Maybe I will tell you all about it when
I'm in the mood to lose my way
But let me say

[Chorus]
But let me say
You should have seen that sunrise
With your own eyes
It brought me back to life
You'll be with me next time I go outside
Just no more 3x5s
