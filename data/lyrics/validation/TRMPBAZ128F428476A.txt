[Instrumental Intro]

The sky began to fall
Ripping open a path up to heaven
Time slowed to a crawl
Early morning, September 11th
Steel crumbling frames
The scales of justice are decimated
Hate ignites the flames
New York City incinerated

See the flames on the river
Is this our judgment day?
Praying hands of a killer
When evil flies our way
Our way...

[Short Instrumental Break]

The towers got hit
A steel bird with wings of destruction
As the buildings split
The skyline has been deconstructed
So many people killed
Two thousand nine hundred and seventy-four
Innocent blood spilled
Extremist plotting a holy war

See the flames on the river
Terrorism sealed our fate
Praying hands of a killer
Reciting a sermon of hate
Will you please reconsider?
Is this our judgment day?
Time to stand and deliver
When evil flies our way
Flies our way...

[Short Instrumental Break]

We will pick up the pieces
We never cast the first stone
Through all of the bereavement
We will rebuild our home

[Instrumental Break]

The sky began to fall
Ripping open a path up to heaven
Time slowed to a crawl
Early morning, September 11th

See the flames on the river
Terrorism sealed our fate
Praying hands of a killer
Reciting a sermon of hate
Will you please reconsider?
Is this our judgment day?
Time to stand and deliver
When evil flies our way
Flies our way...
