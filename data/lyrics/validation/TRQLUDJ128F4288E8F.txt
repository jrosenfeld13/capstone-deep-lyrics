[Intro]
I got a call from my old writing partner from college, Jeff
And uh you know we were kind of drinking talking to each other on the phone
And he goes, You know, I bet you I can name a subject that you cant write a song about.
And I said, Alright fucker. Lets hear it, what you got?
And he goes, How about a homeless guy?
And I said.  Easy.
And he said Who is French
Lets give it a shot
If this doesnt go over I owe him a lot of money

My story is so tiresome
*laughing from crowd*
Alright lets try that again

[Verse 1]
My story is so tiresome (tiresome)
Back in France I was rich as they come (as they come)
But I lost all my wealth and my good mental health
Now I live with the filth and the scum (and the scum)
Im Pierre, the only French bum in New York
When I open my Boones Farm I still sniff the cork
So have you a quarter Im begging you please
I have to have wine with my government cheese

[Verse 2]
I really should bid you adieu (bid adieu)
Im feeling a bit sac re bleu (sac re bleu)
My life is a hell, I give off a bad smell but Im French so thats always been true (P.U)
