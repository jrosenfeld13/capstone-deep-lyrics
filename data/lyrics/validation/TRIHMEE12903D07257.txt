Dark of the night, advancing armies
Dogs of war that surround me
Curse them all and lead them into hell
Bittersweet, the thrill of battle, ringing ears
The clash of metal, raise the banner high
Into the sky
Battle cries, blood stained armor
Slaughtered hordes, fearless martyrs
Scream out as they meet a bitter end
Die at my hands, vengeful with hate
Die for thy sins, bestowed unto fate
Sons of iniquity
Sons of iniquity

Metal maces show no mercy, savage graces
Swift with fury, crush the skulls that meet
A fatal blow
Swords of steel, slicing leather
Axes grind, surging legions
Fight for glory, vie for victory
Shields gleam, piercing lances, iron stings
Strikes and shatters, force destruction
The battlefield is mine

Light of day, brigs new promise
Heavens shine down upon us
Life's struggle is past and far away
Corpses lie, rotting bodies
Stench of death that engulfs me
War smiles with pain and misery
