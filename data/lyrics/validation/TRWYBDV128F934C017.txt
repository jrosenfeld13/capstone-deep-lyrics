Passion - the longing of a burning man - domination cannot be contained
Bleeding from the horns of the bull - callous as his history - anchorless
Severed from surrender - revolting martyr - the contender to the tentacles of filth
Oblivious to mercy - chasing down behemoth
Matador - Ride the knife through the flesh
Matador - Lungs of the war
Badge the worm - Bomb the Gods - Sleep with the lions
Matador - Lungs of the war
Manifest effects of the dawn destiny delivered through the chest
Lionheart obsession like a mouthful of fire - a well fed mass abortion
Those who die will be the lucky ones - aftermath eternally perverted
Forever prosthetic - ill stabled for life - forced into extinction
