[Verse 1]
You live so much, it's like you're dying
You can't give up, your body's trying
You build so tall it's like you're flying
But rocks will fall; the sky keeps climbing

[Chorus]
You're gonna lose everything
You're gonna lose everything
You're gonna lose everything
You're gonna lose everything

How does it feel

How does it feel

[Verse 2]
I'm not scared so much of trying
But don't look up you might start flying

[Chorus]
You're gonna lose everything
You're gonna lose everything
You're gonna lose everything
You're gonna lose everything
You're gonna lose everything
You're gonna lose everything
How does it feel
Oh how does it feel
Oh no

[Bridge]
I wanna know
Oh I wanna know
How does it feel
Oh how does it feel

[Chorus]
You're gonna lose everything
You're gonna lose everything
How does it feel
Oh how does it feel

[Outro]
You live so much, it's like you're dying
You can't get up, your body's trying
You build so tall it's like you're flying
But rocks will fall; the sky keeps climbing
