Fires outside
We're out there taking in the heat on ourselves now
No questions
Could let us believe that it could be impossible
Here we are picking up pieces
We have fallen and we will stay down

Now there is no love at all
Now there is no love at all

Beat the ground
Can't find no ashes
We will fight but we will not win
There's no time to capture a flame
To keep it burning
Here we are picking up pieces
We have fallen and we will stay down

Now there is no love at all
Now there is no love at all

Your hand on my shoulder
Is making me feel like moving away

Fires outside

Could let us believe that it could be impossible

We have fallen and we will stay down

Now there is no love at all
Now there is no love at all

Your hand on my shoulder
Is making me feel like moving away

Now there is no love at all
Now there is no love at all
Now there is no love at all
Now there is no love at all

Now there is no love at all
(fires outside)
Now there is no love at all
