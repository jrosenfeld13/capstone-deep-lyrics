That sugar, I like that Sugar Sally
But all she likes is cash
All she wants is cash
That Lincoln, he digs that Sugar Sally
But Sam took all his cash
Sam took all his cash

And Georgie's on the TV
Shaking his booty

I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I

That Sally, she stole my Lincoln town car
And George stole my cigars
He ripped off my cigars
So now I'm gonna get him
I never should have let him

I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I
