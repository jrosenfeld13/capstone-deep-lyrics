Set me free
Let me be who and what I am
Why can't you see?
You never seem to understand
This pain I feel
Which is real as your ignorance
Question fate as I await deliverance

Like a fantastic fork
In bloody meat
Don't give me love I wanna drown in your deep divide

Tumbleweed sew the seed in this ghost town
You never know what you'll see when the sun goes down
I saw her last in a dream she seems to astound
Heard of her first third verse (216) hands bound

Taken from me in my mind
Empty without it inside
Starving I am the deprived
Just want it once...
Desires strong
Resistance is weak
It's hard to win when you've got so many mouths to feed

Set me free
Let me be who and what I am
Why can't you see?
You never seem to understand
This pain I feel
Is as real as your ignorance
Question fate as I await deliverance

I could die for all of my sins
No not for all that I have never had
This life's a fight for fulfillment
Inside a war of my own
Hindsight
Look back with resentment
Taken as I find myself all alone...

All alone...

Taken from me
