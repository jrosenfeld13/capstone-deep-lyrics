I had a moment, when I thought I might be wrong
But Ashley how could it be
I waited on the rooftop, all night long
But you weren't coming for me
And now I'm sitting here like a mixed up little kid
You said you wanted me but you never did
There was a moment when I thought our love was strong
But now that moment is gone

I could stand right underneath the window of your room
Throwing rocks I've done it before
And I would love to find a reason to dazzle you with lies
But I don't have the energy no more
And you never promise anything you didn't give
I assumed that you'd say yes but you never did
There was a moment my love for you was strong
But now that moment is gone
Now that moment is gone

I saw you behind the camera
Whispering to your friends and watching me
I fell in love with you there
Which proves the fool that I can often be

I had a moment when I thought I might be right
But Ashley how could it be
I drank your share bourbon thinking you might come around
There ain't no one on the rooftop but me
And now I'm sitting here like a mixed up little kid
You said you wanted me but you never did
There was a moment my love for you was strong
But Ashley that moment is gone
Ashley that moment is gone
Now that moment is gone
