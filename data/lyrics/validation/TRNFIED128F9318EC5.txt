[Verse 1]
Look at you standing there
You look so out of place
I turn around one more time
Regret still has your face
I can read your mind right now
You want me to stick around
But nothing ends if I don't leave right now

[Chorus]
Let me go let me walk away, walk away baby
I can't stay let me walk away, walk away baby
I'll be fine, I will recover
And I will learn to love another
Sometimes goodbye is the hardest thing to say
So I'll walk away

[Verse 2]
It was love and there were times I even fooled myself
And I believe we really tried but some things you just can't help
As sure as we're both standing here
I can see it all so clear
And I can't wait for you to say goodbye

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I can hurt right now
Or I can hurt later
I think I'll get it over with
I think I'll get it over with

[Chorus]
