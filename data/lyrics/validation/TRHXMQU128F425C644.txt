Who's that creeping out of my back door
Don't say he's collecting for the poor
Don't you tell me you're not having fun
The green eyed monster's got me on the run
Phones keep ringing but there's no one there
You never told me why you changed your hair
Someone else's lotion on my side of the mattress
Green eyed monster's got me by the niagra's
Don't think i'm mad, it's paranoia
(i want what you got)
I'm sad, you're glad
(i want what you got)
I'm hungry for your love
Say the word, give me fever
(you got what i need)
Keep those goodies for me
Midnight shopping is a funny thing
But i'm not laughing, you don't wear your ring
You spend a fortune but your cupboard's bare
The green eyed monster's got his home in there
Somethings cooking at the laundromat
Dirty washing, i'm not having that
Fifteen visits and my threads are bare
The green eyed monster leaves me in despair
Don't think i'm mad, it's paranoia
(i want what you got)
I'm sad, you're glad
(i want what you got)
Hungry for your love
You say, the word, give me fever
(you got what i need)
Keep that something for me
What the hell is happening here
The more i get to know
I find out how much i don't know
Who can i turn to now
When everything i touch
And everything i see
Seems to crumble into dust
You put the evil eye on me
Green eyed monster's driving me insane
And jealous lovers play a deadly game
My fire is burning but you're as cold as ice
The green eyed monster throws a loaded dice
Who's that creeping out of my back door
Don't say he's collecting for the poor
Don't you tell me you're not having fun
The green eyed monster's got me on the run
The green eyed monster's got me on the run
The green eyed monster's got me on the run
