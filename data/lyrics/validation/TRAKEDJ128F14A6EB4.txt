Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Why you dress like me?
Is it honesty or you just a fool?
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Why the school kids laugh?
'Cause the papers got it wrong again
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Take a piece of me serve me
Up on a plate in your restaurant
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Is it 'cos I'm fly
'Cos I said what I said
When I said what I said but I didn't say
Is it 'cos I'm hip
Why you dig my shit
And you say I am a fan? Now I understand
Is it 'cos I'm hot
Why you mention me in your VIP memories
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
I ain't buying or selling today
I'm just looking around
For some decent conversation
No hidden agenda
No phony pretender
No holding on out for no sweet sixteen
Or peppermint dream
I'll call you please don't call me
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Is it 'cos I'm smart
Why you break my heart
With the lies you tell, baby, kiss and tell
Is it 'cos I'm wrong
That you jump right in
With no discipline baby sink or swim
Is it 'cos we're friends
Why you use my name just to entertain, yeah
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Time keeps ticking and running away
And it's taking us fast to a brand new free dimension
Too cool to mention, well, that's the intention
But some others too darn plan to say
Setting us free, say goodbye to jealousy
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
No one really cares
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Take a piece of me
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
Why you mention me
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
In your VIP
Is it 'cos I'm cool?
