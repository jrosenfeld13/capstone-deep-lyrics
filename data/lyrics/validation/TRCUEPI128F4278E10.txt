[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel the fear of uncertainty stinging clear
And I, I can't help but ask myself
How much I let the fear take the wheel and steer

[Pre-Chorus]
It's driven me before
And it seems to have a vague, haunting mass appeal
But lately I'm
Beginning to find that I should be the one behind the wheel

[Chorus]
Whatever tomorrow brings Ill be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings Ill be there
Ill be there

[Verse 2]
So if I decide to waiver my chance
To be one of the hive
Will I choose water over wine
And hold my own and drive?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's driven me before
And it seems to be the way, that everyone else gets around
But lately I'm
Beginning to find that when I drive myself, my light is found

[Chorus]
Whatever tomorrow brings Ill be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings Ill be there
Ill be there

[Bridge]
Would you choose water over wine?
Hold the wheel and drive

[Chorus]
Whatever tomorrow brings Ill be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings Ill be there
Ill be there
