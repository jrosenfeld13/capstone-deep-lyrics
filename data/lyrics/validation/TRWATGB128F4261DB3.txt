[Intro]
(When you're gone!)

[Verse 1]
I've been wandering around the house all night
Wondering what the hell to do
Yeah, I'm trying to concentrate but
All I can think of is you

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, the phone don't ring cause my friends ain't home
I'm tired of being all alone
Got the TV on cause the radio's playing
Songs that remind me of you

[Chorus]
Baby, when you're gone
I realize I'm in love
Days go on and on
And the nights just seem so long
Even food don't taste that good
Drink ain't doing what it should
Things just feel so wrong
Baby, when you're gone
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I've been driving up and down these streets
Trying to find somewhere to go
Yeah, I'm looking for a familiar face
But there's no one I know

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, this is torture, this is pain
It feels like I'm gonna go insane
I hope you're coming back real soon
Cause I don't know what to do

[Chorus]
Baby, when you're gone (When you're gone)
I realize I'm in love
Days go on and on (On and on)
And the nights just seem so long
Even food don't taste that good
Drink ain't doing what it should
Things just feel so wrong
Oh yeah
Baby, when you're gone

[Solo]

Oh, baby, when you're gone

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, when you're gone (When you're gone)
I realize I'm in love (You're in love)
Days go on and on
And the nights just seem so long
Even food don't taste that good (Ohh)
Drink ain't doing what it should
Ah, things just feel so wrong (So wrong)
Baby, when you're gone (Yeah, you're gone)

[Outro]
Oh, baby, when you're gone
Yeah, baby, when you're gone
