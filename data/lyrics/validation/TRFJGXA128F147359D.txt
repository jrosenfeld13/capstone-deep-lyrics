This morning's been cruel to me again
And even my bed is cold
Naked I seat down and break in tears
So hysterical
Tearing off the pillows of past
I bet all neighbours have heard me before
Can't beat another sleepless night
Does it have to go on?

(Carry on) Finding pieces of me on the streets
It's only when I lose my faith
And it won't stop raining
Chasing days on the runaway
From the deep burning
It's only when I fade away
And the fever stays

Water is gonna have to be
Once more the substitute for milk
I close my eyes:
I think they've seen enough
Light hurts:
Can anyone switch off the sun?

(Carry on) Finding pieces of me on the streets
It's only when I lose my faith
And it won't stop raining
Chasing days on the runaway
From the deep burning
It's only when I fade away
And the fever stays
