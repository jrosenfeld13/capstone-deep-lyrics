We sail across the sea
In our thoughts we float over mountains
All this vanity that we could hide
The truth

The truth is to be alive
And to live your life in fear by hate
And create our own gods

We all ourselves are created
Our own images
Ourselves we are created
Our own gods

In the misty morning
When the sun is rising
When the whole sky
Is red like blood

Man can realize
The real meaning of life
To love and respect
Respect your life

Your salvation
Or is just your damnation

We all ourselves are created
Our own images
Ourselves we are created
Our own gods

The truth is to be alive
And to live your life in fear by hate
And create our own gods
