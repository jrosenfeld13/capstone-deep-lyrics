Yeah the day is right my friends
Live life as full as you can
Just put through you my heart
Do what you want yourself
Oh there's a spark down inside
I would like to die
Whoa whoa

Ain't no good when your all alone
Life's a never ending road
If you feel like running
You better slow down what's your hurry now
Listen we got the feeling yeah
Feeling feeling

Yeah so exciting to be alive
It's a future you don't wanna hide
Put sadness straight out of your mind
So leave all your troubles behind
And I bring you the sweet
Right where we all wanna be
Yeah whoa whoa

Yeah it ain't no good when your all alone
Life's a never ending road
If you feel like you wanna run
You better slow down what's the hurry
We got the feeling yeah
Feeling feeling whoa whoa whoa

Yeah it ain't no good when your all alone
Life's a never ending road
If you feel like running
You better slow down what's the hurry
We got the feeling yeah
Feeling feeling oh no
