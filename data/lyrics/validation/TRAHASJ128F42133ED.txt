Down upon our souls we will ride
And it serves you right to build your kingdom in the sky
I man na lie, what a lullaby you sing to a young man so

Man down, way down, down upon our head and his soul
It was just a thought in the air, like something planted in the atmosphere, my dear
Oh my suffer loss is real

Oh why, why, why must we be shackled on ya
We were treated like a number and talked to like a fool
You better ascend before youre gone for so long

And the wind blow I man got to carry the soul of the waterfall
Were still so powerful my friends, you have got nothing to fear, nuclear
Oh the mighty stone building across them land

But the higher they build man try to fly over world
Man breaking their heart and so taking their head as them goal, man I pray
Still dey man champion so I, I, I, ring a man bone

But they throw rock, rock, rock, rock, rock stone Jah messenger down
Oh man erase them with wit and anger, like it was a joke, that that man say
Oh my suffer loss is real

What a rocky man road
But we shall embrace our souls against them
I mean dont let another day, go by
Down upon our souls we will ride
