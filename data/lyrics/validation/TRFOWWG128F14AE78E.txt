Already I'm too far behind
To make this up to you
Apologies will never do

You were too young the times not right
Things did not seem on our side
We did what felt right
(for us to carry on)

Come what may we'll see this through
To give up on this love I found in you
I can not do

Summer crush turned into love
Take my hand we'll ride above
All the things that might face us

You're my best friend words can't comprehend
The outline of a love That strongly holds us up (for us to carry on)

Come what may we'll see this through
To give up on this love I found in you
I can not do

Some may say it's all the same
Yet promises have brought me here in faith
Growing stronger everyday
And with that we can face anything

Come what may we'll see this through
To give up on this love I found in you
Come what may we'll see this through
Come what may we'll see this
Come what may we'll see this through

To give up on this love I found in you
(I can not do)
