Standin' on my front porch
Grabbed her and I kissed her
Boy (I) was surprised when I saw her little sister

Lights out
Lights out
I'm glad the lights was out
Sister knows (what) it's all about
What to do when the lights go out

Mother looked at me
She was peepin' through the window
Way she looked at me you'd have thought I was her sister

Lights out
Lights out
I'm glad the lights was out
Sister knows (what) it's all about
What to do when the lights go out

Lovin' on the front porch
Took mama's swing
I can almost hear those weddin' bells ring

Lights out

Lights out
I'm glad the lights was out
Sister knows (what) it's all about
What to do when the lights go out

Now we('re) married
And we got a little house
Had to marry little sister 'cause the lights went out

Lights out
Lights out
I'm glad the lights was out
Sister knows (what) it's all about
What to do when the lights go out

Now we('re) married
And we got a little house
Had to marry little sister 'cause the lights went out

Lights out
Lights out
I'm glad the lights was out
Sister knows (what) it's all about
What to do when the lights go out
