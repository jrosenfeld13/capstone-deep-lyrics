Yes its ok
No I dont mind
But take it slow cause I take
Time to unwind
And if youre nervous thats ok, hey
So am I, so am I, so am I
Put it down to my biochemistry
Put it down to the way I love champagne
Put it down to compatibility
And put your lips to mine again
Put your lips to mine again
No I dont mind
And to be precise
If you did well, it would
Be kind of nice
So let that sparkle overflow,oh
Dont be shy, dont be shy, dont be shy
Put it down to my biochemistry
Put it down to the way I love champagne
Put it down to compatibility
And put your lips to mine again
Put it down to my biochemistry
Put it down to the way I hate the rain
Put it down to compatibility
Put your lips to mine again
No I dont mind
And Id like to say
I love the fact that first you
Asked anyway
So slide on over here to me
Make me smile, make me smile, make me smile
Put it down to my biochemistry
Put it down to the way I love champagne
Put it down to compatibility
Put your lips to mine again
Put it down to my biochemistry
Put it down to the way I hate the rain
Put it down to compatibility
Put your lips to mine again
Put your lips to mine again
Yes its ok
Really its fine
Gentle shivers running down my spine
Have me feeling to my toes
Satisfied, satisfied, satisfied
Put it down to my biochemistry
Put it down to the way I love champagne
Put it down to compatibility
Put your lips to mine again
Put it down to my biochemistry
Put it down to the way I hate the rain
Put it down to compatibility
Put your lips to mine again
