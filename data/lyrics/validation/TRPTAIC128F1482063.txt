Whoa, I, whoa, I
Whoa, I fooled you this time
The last laugh is mine
I know that now you see
What lonelieness can be
You've got a taste of a pain
Hey, mama, for a change
I'm gonna, I'm gonna
Be with my new someone
Having lots of fun
Cause I fooled you this time
The last laugh is mine
I'm tired of staying at home
While you choose to roam
The last laugh is on you
Here's what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna, I'm gonna
Be with my new someone
Having lots of fun, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Whoa, I, whoa, I
Whoa, I fooled you this time
The last laugh is mine
I know you knew I knew
You don't know which way to go
And so called friends
Don't stop to talk
They just pass and grin
I'm gonna, I'm gonna
Be with my new someone
Having lots of fun, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Whoa, I, whoa, I
Whoa, I fooled you this time
The last laugh is mine
Cause I fooled you this time
The last laugh is mine
Yeah, don't you know I
Don't you know I
Fooled you this time, baby
Yeah, ha ha ha
The last laugh is mine...
