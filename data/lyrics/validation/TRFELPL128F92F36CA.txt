[Intro][x2]
Doo doo doo doobeedoo
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo

[Chorus]
Doo doo doo doobeedoo
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo
(Taste the summer, you can taste the summer)

[Verse 1]
Can you, can you taste the summer?
I do, I find it in your mouth
Now if I have a weakness it's for sweetness
And it's... floating on your breath, the sweetest melody

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Sure we can make it till the evenings
Cool haze is reflected off your thighs
Long days are coming up and staying up and playing
Music of the falling stars, a melody (melody...)

[Chorus]
