Ever since I was a young boy
I've played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played them all
But I ain't seen nothing like him
In any amusement hall
That deaf,dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball!

He stands like a statue
Becomes part of the machine
Feeling all the bumpers
Always playing clean
He plays by intuition
The digit counters fall
That deaf,dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball!

He's a pinball wizard
There has to be a twist
A pin ball wizard
S'got such a supple wrist

How do you think he does it?
I don't know!
What makes him so good?

He ain't got no distractions
Can't hear those buzzers and bells
Don't see no lights a flashin'
Plays by sense of smell
Always gets a replay
Never seen him fall
That deaf,dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball

I thought I was
The Bally table king
But I just handed
My pinball crown to him

Even on my favourite table
He can beat my best
His disciples lead him in
And he just does the rest
He's got crazy flippin' fingers
Never seen him fall
That deaf,dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball!
