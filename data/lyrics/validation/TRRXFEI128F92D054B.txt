[Verse 1]
The way that you looked at him
And then you looked at me
You must think that I'm proper blind
Proper blind not to see
That I was just a stop gap
Sitting somewhere in-between his hand and his lap
Let me tell you that I wasn't born yesterday, my dear

[Chorus]
That kiss it lasted too long
And we probably shouldn't have danced to that song
It was nothing
It was everything
It's really such a shame
It's so hard to explain to you

[Verse 2]
He's back in town tonight
He's expecting you round a quarter to nine
But you won't be there
Cause he bores the proverbials off you
If he only knew what you thought
The lust, the lack of trust, the temptation you fought
He's worthless, the maxims he flouts
And he's just a passing fashion and he's on his way out

[Chorus]
That kiss it lasted too long
And we probably shouldn't have danced to that song
It was nothing
It was everything
It's really such a shame
It's so hard to explain to you

[Bridge]
I know that I shouldn't but I enjoyed it
I know that I shouldn't but I enjoyed it
I know that I shouldn't but I enjoyed it
I know that I shouldn't but I enjoyed it
I know that I shouldn't but I enjoyed it
I know that I shouldn't but I enjoyed it

[Chorus]
That kiss it lasted too long
And we probably shouldn't have danced to that song
It was nothing
It was everything
It's really such a shame
It's so hard to explain to you

[Outro]
That kiss, that girl, that place that you go
Where is she now?
You don't even know
