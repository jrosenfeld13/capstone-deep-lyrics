Admiring paper on my wall
How many really take the time?
There may not seem that much creative latitude
But that's the challenge of design

The curves intuitively know
Which aspects of nouveau to save
Without succumbing to the full devouring will
Of Aubrey Beardsley in his grave

I'm not expecting that I'll end up with you just because I need to
I shouldn't count on having air around me just because I breathe
I've thought about it for awhile now and I'm okay with things not being okay

I'm trying to mean that I don't care
I'm learning not to be around
I'm on my feet, I'm on the phone demanding answers
Maybe I'd better just sit down

I'm not expecting that I'll end up with you just because I need to
I shouldn't count on having air around me just because I breathe
I've thought about it for awhile now and I'm okay with things not being okay
