Indecisive and deaf or dumb
Tongue-dried in the sun
Nervous speech and your mental health
Drunk on every detail
Loosened up from the moral slide as though
There's nothing to hide
It corresponds with your secret view and
Never weighs upon you

I'd blame someone but I've got you
Like everyday that bores me
Sleep fine at night and
Wake up to my early speechless morning

It works like crime, adjust your view
Waste your time improving
She's cut so well and lifelike too
You'll bleed to death before me
