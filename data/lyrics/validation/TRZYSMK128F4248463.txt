I found a mountain on my own (I'm encouraged)
Trust history to say it's unknown (it's discouraging)
There's a seventeen contest in my own home (discourage)
Sick of seventeen contests in my own home (discourage)
Don't cross the road, you're under a spell
A broken violin (discourage)
Don't cross the road, you're under a spell
Of broken violins

All I need is a little discourage
All I need is a little discourage
All I need is a little discourage
All I need is a little discourage
All I need is a little discourage

I ran away from my own telephone (discourage)
It rings to tell you what the future holds in store, so
There's a lack of confidence at home (discourage)
When a seventeen contest fills your own home (discourage)
Put your trust in courage, because no one can tell
The broken violent
Put your trust in courage, no one can tell
The broken violent

All I need is a little discourage
(the world knows what I need, but it's proving far too hard for me)
