The hours are slipping by
I stare into the night
Into my deep blue sea
Of unforgotten memory
I paint your face
Into my mind
And kiss your tears away
For me there's only you

I want you here, forever stay
My heart torn in two
I'll hold you close to ease your pain
'cause i feel it too

We are two souls in moonlit autumn nights
Rebelling hearts on wings of gentle smiles
Peaceful earth and star-filled skies
No demon, devil, ghost will make us cry

I want you here, forever stay
My heart torn in two
I'll hold you close to ease your pain
'cause i feel it too
Forever stay and save the day
Forever stay
