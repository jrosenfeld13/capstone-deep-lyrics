Midnight's calling
Are you close behind?
Midnight's calling
Are you close behind?
Trees without leaves
And notes that don't ring
Wine left to rot
And a voice that can't sing
And hours of makin' love and sadness
(Aaa aaa aaa aaa)
And a light that just won't shine in the darkness
(Aaa aaa aaa aaa)
Could I be any clearer?
(Aaa aaa aaa aaa)
Could I speak any plainer?
(Aaa aaa aaa aaa)
I need you here, just to lead my way
(Aaa aaa aaa aaa)
And fall, fall, fall
She'd scolded me
For my sinful and wicked ways
It's hard to bother me, do you follow?
And watched with concealed pleasure
I've ripped out my heart and said
"I'm just bad, I can't help it
But I t-t-try to be good"
And trees without leaves
And notes that don't ring
Wine left to rot
And a voice that can't sing
And hours of makin' love and sadness
(Aaa aaa aaa aaa)
And a light that just won't shine in the darkness
(Aaa aaa aaa aaa)
Could I be any clearer?
(Aaa aaa aaa aaa)
Well could I speak any plainer?
(Aaa aaa aaa aaa)
I need you here, just to lead my way
(Aaa aaa aaa aaa)
And fall, fall, fall
Aaa, aa, aa
Aaa, aa, aa
Aaa, aa, aa
'Cause people make you lonely
People make you lonely sometimes
