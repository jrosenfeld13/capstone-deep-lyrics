[Verse 1]
You were a million miles behind
And I was crying every time I'd leave you
Then I didn't want to see you
I still keep my watch two hours behind

[Chorus]
Someone turned the lights out there in Memphis
That's where my family's buried and gone
Last time I was there
I noticed a space left
Next to them there in Memphis
In the damn back lawn

[Verse 2]
I didn't know that I was in the crowd
And the fresh cut grass stopped growing
Everything on my shelf has fallen
I still keep my watch two hours behind

[Chorus]
Someone turned the lights out there in Memphis
That's where my family's buried and gone
Last time I was there
I noticed a space left
Next to them there in Memphis
In the damn back lawn

[Bridge]
Was that a bridge I was crossing
Somewhere I stopped walking
I guess I fell off on my own

[Alternate Chorus]
I heard all the roads they lead to Memphis
Except for the one I'm stumbling down
And I'll be damned if I ever get
This little son of a bitch from Memphis
Well, it's all there I guess
And I haven't forgot
