The water is wide
And I cannot cross over
Nor do I have wings to fly
Build me a boat
That could carry two
And both shall row
My love and I
There is a ship
And she sails the seas
She's burdened deep
As deep can be
But not as deep
As the love I'm in
And I know not if
I sink or swim
But love is gentle
And love is kind
As to a jewel
When first it's new
But love grows old
And it fades with time
And it fades away
Like morning dew
Build me a boat
That could carry two
And both shall row
My love and I
My love and I
My love and I
