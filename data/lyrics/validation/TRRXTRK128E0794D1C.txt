I had no knife but myself
It was me I cut but you bled as well
How could I help my dear sweet pretty one?
When I could not put down the gun

And I don't know your name
Sweet baby Jane

You'll find it unbelievable
I left you in the hospital
And you don't have a stitch to wear
'cos the doctors cut the clothes right off your back
And guess what I don't care
About who or what or when or where
And Heaven knows;
I burnt your clothes

That's it, there's no road left to run
I spilt myself 'til I had none
I grew thorns upon your path
They struck not at your feet but at your heart

Still don't know your name
Sweet baby Jane

You'll find it unbelievable
I left you in the hospital
And you don't have a stitch to wear
'cos the doctors cut the clothes right off your back
And guess what I don't care
About who or what or when or where
And Heaven knows;
I burnt your clothes

I howled outside your door
I was the wolf but I'll return no more
This life is black, and running through a
Heart that's cursed, I lost the best
But can I lose the worst?

I'll soon know your name
Sweet baby Jane

You'll find it unbelievable
I left you in the hospital
And you don't have a stitch to wear
'cos the doctors cut the clothes right off your back
And guess what I don't care
About who or what or when or where
And Heaven knows;
I burnt your clothes

I burnt your clothes
Burnt your clothes
I know your name
Sweet baby Jane
