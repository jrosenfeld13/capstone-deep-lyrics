(Chorus)
She said she's born to be wild
And she can't be tamed
All she wants in life is
Fortune and fame
So she keeps on moving
Moving right along
Even though she knows
Deep down inside
She knows something was wrong

No idle jubee dem couldn't
Cotch pon my pillow
Weh a love man for nike
An ah love man for fila
Dat's not the ways of
Anciento war gorilla
Me rather den to save all my sasaparilla

On a lonesome breezy Sunday morning
This maiden came to town
Me have to blick a sound
How she so cute
And plus so sexy and so round
Sunlight catch her skin and lord
It good from head to ground
Next candidate me see wh fit
Fi wear mi crown
And such tender smiles amaze me
The way that she looks Sunday night
She should be having my baby
My baby
The pleasure was all mine
Like yesterday news it's only for a time
Always on the go
Cause she live a life ah crime
She dont' want no man fi mind it
Di Muffin say dat he couldn't believe
I was living so blindly

(Chorus)
She said she's born to be wild
And she can't be tamed
All she wants in life is
Fortune and fame
So she keeps on moving
Moving right along
Even though she knows
Deep down inside
She knows something was wrong

Well no Shandy
Stricktly imported tequila
Vintage brandy
Skunk sensemilia
Rubies and roses
Diamond collar
Never check me for a money
Nor a penny nor a dollar
She can't go to London
Without visa
Me can't biuld me spliff dem
Without rizzla
Dem say look out the door
And you know di weather
Me start put two
An two together

First class flights
And she drinks the most expensive wines
When she can't maintain
Her lifestyle up on the minumum wages
She needs the coil
And just like a stubborn mule
I would tell that is all she's worth
Well tha smuggling and trafficking
Of ilegal substances is her line of work
Me say a good woman ration
Most of di gyal dem
Get so caught up inna fashion
Love vanity
Dem seem dem love it with a passion
Start to used dem body
For some dirty profession
Seem like dem need
Spiritual supervision
Ital craft
And a ital vision
Righteous path
And a righteous decision
Instead of di
Materialistic religion
Else there's gonna be
Crash course and collision

(Chorus)
She said she's born to be wild
And she can't be tamed
All she wants in life is
Fortune and fame
So she keeps on moving
Moving right along
Even though she knows
Deep down inside
She knows something was wrong

Well the it's all history
Me go up on a ends
Fi chack a one jubilee
Di way she rub me down
And make me feel so nice
Me say haffi left
And go ah studio go voice
Ayanna please stay home tonight
Ayanna please don't take that flight
Smuggling di drugs weh dem supply
To di poor
Destruction of my people
Well then she's got to go
Tell her nah fi mix up inna
Those drugs before
She said she want fi go up on
A smuggling tour
She missing gangsta parcel
Dem say her skull fi bore
She don't have all di dollars
Weh fi ever the score
But she wanna run
Her own drug store

(Chorus)
She said she's born to be wild
And she can't be tamed
All she wants in life is
Fortune and fame
So she keeps on moving
Moving right along
Even though she knows
Deep down inside
She knows something was wrong
