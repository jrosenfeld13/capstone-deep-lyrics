And Nietchze's dead, the poet wrong
I've stumbled on, my pretty song
Run for the middle, run for the shame
I cannot help it anyway
The sun is strong, the sun is strong
The truth be told, I am alone..

I am alone
I am alone
I am alone

A garden queen, with the common touch
Struggled here, I've asked too much
Oh, I can barely breathe
I can barely see
Every single action, I'll be, I'll be death defy

Death defy
Death defy
Death defy

It's all just a game
It's all just a game

It's all yours
It's all yours
It's all yours
It's all yours

Please don't give up now
Please don't give up now
Please don't give up now
Please don't, don't give it up
Give it up
Give it up
Give it up

It's all just a game
It's all just a game

I am alone
I am alone
Death defy
Death defy
Oh my ever loving
Oh my ever loving
Oh my ever loving
Back when we were small
