[Verse 1]
It's ironic
Considerate rarity patron of love
Higher knowledge engulfs me
Cause the blast of fate a lesson
To my eyes concerned and overwhelmed
Theirs were of fear yet, i'm feeling so empty inside
And yet it burns so awkward this time

[Chorus]
It's somethin' with my pride, lies
I cannot hide my true side
And maybe in distress
I can still come out laughing
That's the way I am

[Verse 2]
This little boy proud of helping those in need
But he's not me but just maybe he could be
I can see it now because I'm a hero to his eyes
Temporarily blind, this immature kid
A spirit as well an angel
Hiding by helping and wanting to understand me

[Bridge]
Tears a waterfall of acid cries from his eyes
I need to recognize its meant to be
Oh no

[Chorus]
It's somethin' with my pride, lies
I cannot hide my true side
And maybe in distress
I can still come out laughing
That's the way I am

[Refrain]
Am i hard to recognize?
What do i need to realize?
Why can't i see with my own fucking eyes?
What do i need to see?

See!

[Chorus]
It's somethin' with my pride, lies
I cannot hide my true side
And maybe in distress
I can still come out laughing
That's the way I am

[Refrain]
Am i hard to recognize?
What do i need to realize?
Why can't i see with my own fucking eyes?
What do i need to see?
