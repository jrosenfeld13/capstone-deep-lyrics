Well, I've been travelin over mountains
Now even through the valleys too
Well I've been travelin night and day
Runnin all the way
Baby tryin to get to you

Well since I read your lovin letter
Where you said you love me true
Well I been travelin night and day
Runnin all the way
Baby tryin to get to you

Well now theres nothin that could hold me
Or to keep me way from you ooooh
Since your lovin letter told me
Ah that you really love me true oooooh
I just had to reach you baby
Back of all that I've been through

I'll keep travelin night and day
Runnin all the way baby
Tryin to get to you
Well if I had to do it over
Well thats exactly what I'd do

I'd keep travelin night and day
Runnin all the way baby
Tryin to get to you

Well since I read your lovin letter
Well my heart began to sing
There are many miles between us
Ah but they didn't mean a thing

Lord's above he knows I love you
Well it was he who brought me through
When my way was black as night
He'd still shine bright as light
When I was tryin to get to you
