[Verse 1]
I read you
And God I'm good at it
I'm so spot on
Chord, shapes in air
Go press that dissonance
If you dare
And you, breathing in
Finesse an innocent
From her partying

[Chorus]
And I'm high enough from all the waiting
To ride a wave on your inhaling
And I'm high enough from all the waiting
To ride a wave on your inhaling
'Cause I love you, no
Can't help but love, you know

[Verse 2]
What part of "No"
Don't you understand?
I've told you before
To just get off my case
This isn't happening
Stop this now
And I, where was I?
I have to be somewhere
Now where did I put it?

[Chorus]
And I'm high enough from all the waiting
To ride a wave on your inhaling
And I'm high enough from all the waiting
To ride a wave on your inhaling
'Cause I love you, no
Can't help but love, you know

[Bridge]
Is this it? Is it?
Is this it? Yeah
Is it? No
Is this it? Oh
Is this it? No
Is this it? No
Is this it?
Yes, hello, we're back
And we're taking calls
Now what was the question?

[Chorus]
And I'm high enough from all the waiting
To ride a wave on your inhaling
And I'm high enough from all the waiting
To ride a wave on your inhaling
And I'm high enough from all the waiting
To ride a wave on your inhaling
And I'm high enough from all the waiting
To ride a wave on your inhaling
'Cause I love you, no
Can't help but love, you know
'Cause I love you, no
Can't help but love, you know
'Cause I love you, no
Can't help but love, you know
