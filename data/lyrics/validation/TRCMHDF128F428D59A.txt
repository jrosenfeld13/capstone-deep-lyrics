Yeah, mmmmm, oh
Listen here

:VERSE 1:
Cute face, most hate, but thats O.K
A big butt, like what, you shake it anyway
Fly all the time, ghetto dime, so get down the grind
Pop the clutch, hit the dutch, if its time to ride

:HOOK:
I need a down chick, who don't play around
I'll make you my chick, I can hold you down
Like Jigga said in his song (??????)
You can believe it for now (girl all trust)

:CHORUS:
Hey mami (yes daddy), joke with me (yes daddy), ride for me
See I'm making you my homie now
Hey mami (yes daddy), lay with me (yes daddy), sex with me
See I'm making you my lady now
Hey mami (yes daddy), joke with me, sit with me, ride for me
See I'm making you my homie now
Hey mami (yes daddy), lay with me, sex with me, moan for me
See I'm making you my lady now

:VERSE 2:
I'm goin' ask you some questions now answer me (one)
If I fell, would you be there to catch me (two)
If my cash flow was low, would you up and go (three)
For me, my seed, would you carry

:HOOK:

:CHORUS:

:VERSE 3:
I'm looking for a woman that'll ride for me
And when push comes to shove, she will lie for me (be my aliby)
And she's gotta be down and get this money with me
Cuz I'm down for a little bit of (???????)

:HOOK:

:CHORUS: til end
