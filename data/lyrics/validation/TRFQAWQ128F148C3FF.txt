Drugs and Kittens

Don't mind when it happens
No problem when I am sayin' it
But when I lose my mind
Kick my behind
Because I hate when my mind keeps replayin' it
I'm not braggin', and I'm not proud
I hang around a drunken crowd
We are happy, that I can say
And until we're not, I kid you not
We're gonna stay that way

We're down, down, down
One more day of sayin' we won't be no more
Down, down, down
One more good day of sayin' we won't be no more

Drinkin' the other day
I said "I love you", you turned away
Maybe the drinkin'
It made me cry
But I'm a happy, very happy, very happy guy
Drunks and children they tell the truth
That's just what I am, I'm drunken youth
And when I am drinkin' I don't know why
But I'm a happy, very happy, very happy guy

Sometimes when I'm playin'
I never watch what I'm sayin'
Sometimes I lose my head
I lose my head and things get said
I never should have said
Sometimes I get housed
I get housed I get soused
And shoot off my mouth
And sometimes I can't get out
And I don't know what I'm talkin' about

You know I've made mistakes
I've had my ups and downs
My ins and outs
My share of bad breaks
But when it's all
Been said and done
I raise my beer and I swear
"God it's been fun!"

Good God, oh my God, good God, good God
Good God, good God, God it's been fun!
Goddamn

I'll Drink to That

Standing stiff on a cliff and I'm not gonna leap
Checked out the water but it's much too deep
No going back there's no turning around
So I'll stay here and wait God I hope that I'm found
My my my my my my my thoughts were in knots but I couldn't get to sleep
Went up to the attic to see what to keep
Threw out the useless and now it's bone-dry
But I still couldn't die and couldn't figure out why

No way, no how, no what? what now?
The place is packed I needed that
The bottles cracked I'm glad for that
A good nights rest? forget about that
I feel alive in this dive so I'll drink to that

The place is packed I needed that
The bottles cracked I'm glad for that
A good nights rest? forget about that
I feel alive in this dive so I'll drink to that

The attic was empty and my eyes were shut
I had to do soemthing but I didn't know what
The darkness was nice but it wasn't enough
The clock wasn't stopping so I had to get tough
Get tough, get up, get out, get tough!

The place is packed I needed that
The bottles cracked I'm glad for that
A good nights rest? forget about that
I feel alive in this dive so I'll drink to that

The place is packed I needed that
The bottles cracked I'm glad for that
A good nights rest? forget about that
I feel alive in this dive so I'll drink to that
