Absorb all their fears, collect all their minds
We'll be the snakes wherever they'll play
And we'll be the demons wherever they'll pray
...It' will be the greatest fight on earth

Snatch the wings of a fly
Spit on them and nail them to my spine
Say "little insect now fly away"
But I'll be the demon in every psalm you pray

The disease, the love, the claws, the blood
The empty clinics of savaged hearts
The rusty nails in lidless eyes
...And the skin won't ever be cleansed from the dirt

Come here
Now come here
Let me smell your fears

Cry here
Now cry here
Let me enjoy your tears

Lick the wet segments of a worm
Taste it now
And let it wriggle down your throat
Mothers scram
"Little children now run away"
But I'll be the snake wherever they'll play

Commence the extermination
To weaken their wills
Uncover their hearts free the insects
And let them lead the way
