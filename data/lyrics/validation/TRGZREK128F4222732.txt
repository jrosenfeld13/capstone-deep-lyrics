Well I walked
Man I walked
Through some pain today
Well I guess today was my turn to hurt

Well, why not
You know I'm not any different
And no pain means no gain
I've heard them say

Well I used to think that life
Was so ugly
Live fast, die young
Leave a pretty corpse

But now I see things so much different
And life seems sometimes pretty to me
