Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what bought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet love comes but once, and yet

I'm so glad we met the second time around
Who can say what bought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet loves comes but once, and yet
I'm so glad we met the second time around
