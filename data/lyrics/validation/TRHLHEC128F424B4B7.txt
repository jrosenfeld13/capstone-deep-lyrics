I can hear the cars out on the street
As I lie awake and watch you while you sleep
It seems that it was only yesterday
When you took my hand and carried me away

Now everyday I look at you
And think of when you married me
Is it still the same for you?
As good as how it used to be?
Oh, I wonder are you still in love with me?

Our children are the garden we have grown
I see so much of you in them I know
This house is filled with memories of the past
When no-one thought that you and I would last

Now everyday I look at you
And think of when you married me
Is it still the same for you?
As good as how it used to be?
Oh, I wonder are you still in love with me?

Now after all this time we've been together
Did you ever think the right one could be wrong?
I know you said you'd stay with me forever
I just can't believe your love would last so long
So now I think I'll put my fears away
If not for love you never would have stayed
Forgive me if I feel this way again
But I need to know you love me now and then

Cause everyday I look at you
And think of when you married me
Is it still the same for you?
As good as how it used to be?
Oh, I wonder are you still in love with me?

I guess I wonder why you're still in love with me
