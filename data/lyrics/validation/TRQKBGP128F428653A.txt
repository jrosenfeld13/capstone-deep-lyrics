Whatever happened to the sun
It used to always come
Back when we were young
We'd sing
And party all night long

But seasons don't ever come on time no more
And war banks over the years
And anger fills our tears
What happened to the sun?

Chorus:
But I know, I know, I know I'm not alone
And I know, I know, I know I'm not alone

Every time I read the news
I'm always more confused
They're telling me to choose
But there's only lies to choose from
And how many died to today?
How many lost their homes or shot a gun?
Or a loved one?
What happened to our sons?

Chorus:
But I know, I know, I know I'm not alone
And I know, I know, I know I'm not alone

Even though I'm far from home I'm not alone
I'm not alone
Even though I'm far from home I'm not alone

Woo hoo hoo hoo
Woo hoo hooo hoo
Woo hoo hoo hoo

Spoken:
Walk to the front
Open the gate
I see a road there

Chorus:
Even though I'm far from home I'm not alone
Even though I'm far from home I'm not alone

Woo hoo hoo hoo
Woo hoo hooo hoo
Woo hoo hoo hoo
