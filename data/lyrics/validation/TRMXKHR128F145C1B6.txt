A skyhole here, the sun's let in
It melts the ice, it melts my skin
The oceans rise, the lands recede
Cities crumble, vermin feed
We will all go together when we go, when we go (repeat 2)
We will all go together when we go
The chainsaw roars, the forests fall
The natives hide, the cattle call
The water boils with toxic waste
We catch the fish to get a taste
We will all go together when we go, when we go (repeat 2)
We will all go together when we go

The atoms split to heat the town
And build a bomb to knock it down
Nothing is done For all of this
Till most to blame is most at risk
We will all go together when we go, when we go (repeat 2)
We will all go together when we go
A skyhole here, the sun's let in
It melts the ice, it melts my skin
The oceans rise, the lands recede
Cities crumble, vermin feed
We will all go together when we go, when we go (repeat to end)
We will all go together when we go
