Well, I'm trying to be patient
Yeah, the wheels keep turning 'round
But it's a treadmill and I'm just dragging my feet
I'm so tired of everything
Defeated by routine
By words that don't mean anything to me
At least not anymore
Now that I'm done with the morning
Of a day without ending
A year of decadence to escape from penance
But I suffered, yeah I'm over it
Yeah, I'm fine now, but I'm sick of it
I was happy being miserable
I used to lay down my head on the bar
And raise one lonely finger for a drink

It doesn't have to be so difficult
Just keep coasting by
So you lost a limb
Well hell, these wounds will heal with time
But what happens when you loved what you lost?
You didn't have to cut it off
But I did and I do and it took everything I had
I wonder if I could ever get it back to how it was
When I still thought of love as a risk I could take
If I was willing to make the commitment to rejection
And he mind games, the deception
The late nights under the covers
Pointing the finger at whoever started
Whatever we were fighting about

I guess that I'm fine now
Yeah, everything's better
Everything's cooled down
It's all copasetic
We'll move on, off to a better world
To a fresh start where anything's possible
But I'm sick of it
Yeah, I'm sick of it
I am so sick of it
