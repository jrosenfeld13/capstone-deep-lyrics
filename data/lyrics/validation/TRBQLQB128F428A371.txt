I'm afraid we're moving a little to fast
He think we're moving too slow (it figures)
I'm sittin' here praying this movie
Will last another hour or so
He whispers he loves me
He loves me so strong
He wants to show me tonight
(Yeah I'll bet he does)
When two people have wanted each other
So long you know it's only right
(Yeah tonight)

What if I do
Will he love me more
What if I don't
Will he walk out the door
I want to wait till I know it's true
He thinks I won't
But what if I do

He's got my body a screaming screaming let's go
He's got my mind all a mess
The part of me that always says no
Is losing to the part that says yes
It's a test

What if I do
Will he love me more
What if I don't
Will he walk out the door
I want to wait till I know it's true
He thinks I won't
But what if I do

He says we'll be together
From now until forever
Is he being clever or what

What if I do
Will he love me more
What if I don't
Will he walk out the door
I want to wait till I know it's true
He thinks I won't
He thinks I won't

What if I do
Will he love me more
What if I don't
Will he walk out the door
I want to wait till I know it's true
He thinks I won't
But what if I do

He thinks I won't
But what if I do
