Into your hand, into your mind
Out of your soul, race through your veins
You can't escape, you can't escape

Into your life, into your dreams
Out of the dark into the light
You can't explain, you can't explain

Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Rushin' through your hair and rushin' through your head
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?

Don't let nobody tell you your life is over
Be every color that you are
Into the rush now, you don't have to know how
Know it all before you'll try

Pulling you in, spinning you 'round
Lifting your feet right off the ground
You can't believe it's happening now

Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Rushin' through your hair and rushin' through your head
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?

Don't let nobody tell you your life is over
Be every color that you are
Into the rush now, you don't have to know how
Know it all before you'll try

It takes you to another place
Imagine everything you can
All the colors start to blend
The system overloads again
Can you feel it?

Don't let nobody tell you your life is over
Be every color that you are
Into the rush now, you don't have to know how
Know it all before you'll try

Don't let nobody tell you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't let nobody tell you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't let nobody tell you your life is over
Be every color that you are
Into the rush now, you don't have to know how
Know it all before you'll try
