[Verse 1]
To this world, I'm unimportant
Just because I have nothing to give
So you call this your free country
Tell me why it costs so much to live
Tell me why

[Pre-Chorus]
This world can turn me down
But I wont turn away (oh no)
I wont turn around

[Verse 2]
All my work and endless measures
Never seem to get me very far
Walk a mile just to move an inch now
Even though I'm trying so damn hard
I'm trying so hard

[Chorus]
This world can turn me down
But I wont turn away
And I wont duck and run
'Cause I'm not built that way
When everything is gone
There is nothing there to fear
This world cannot bring me down
No, 'cause I'm already here

[Bridge]
Oh, no, I am already here
Down on my knees
I am already here (on no)
I'm already here
I must have told you a thousand times
I'm not running away

[Bridge]
I wont duck and run
I wont duck and run
I wont duck and run
No, I won't pass away

[Chorus]
This world can turn me down
But I wont turn away
And I wont duck and run
'Cause I'm not built that way
When everything is gone
There is nothing there to fear
This world cannot bring me down
No, 'cause I'm already here
This world can turn me down
But I wont turn away
And I wont duck and run
'Cause I'm not built that way
When everything is gone
There is nothing there to fear
This world cannot bring me down
No, 'cause I'm already here
