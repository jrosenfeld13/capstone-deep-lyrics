Told you once before
And I won't tell you no more
Get down, get down, get down
You're a bad dog, baby
But I still want you 'round

I don't give a damn
And I'd like you if you can
Get down, get down, get down
You're a bad dog, baby
But I still want you 'round

Told you once before
And I won't tell you no more
Get down, get down, get down
You're a bad dog, baby
But I still want you 'round

You give me the creeps
When you jump on your feet
So get down, get down, get down
Keep your hands to yourself
I'm strictly out of bounds
