Come with me, my love
To the sea, the sea of love
I wanna tell you just how much I love you

Do you remember when we met
That's the day I knew you were my pet
I wanna tell you, oh, how much I love you

Come with me to the sea of love

Do you remember when we met
That's the day I knew you were my pet
I wanna tell you, oh, how much I love you

Come with me to the sea, the sea of love
