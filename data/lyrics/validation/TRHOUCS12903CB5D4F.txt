Wicked warriors grown up on bites and bore
Wear the uniforms but desert the war

Try not to...
Try not to understand it
Too young to choose
Still want to be a bird, cut loose

Don't mind the future
We'll live, we'll live, we'll live, we'll live again
In a time when you want it
It's all, it's all, it's all in your head
Don't mind the future
We'll live, we'll live, we'll live
In your head

Put your life on hold
For now, we never get old
Spending father's cash on Moroccan hash

Try not to...
Try not to understand it
Too young to choose
Still want to be a bird, cut loose

Don't mind the future
We'll live, we'll live, we'll live, we'll live again
In a time when you want it
It's all, it's all, it's all in your head
Don't mind the future
We'll live, we'll live, we'll live
In your head, in your head, in your head

Try not to...
Try not to understand it
Too young to choose
Still want to be a bird, cut loose

Don't mind the future
We'll live, we'll live, we'll live, we'll live again
In a time when you want it
It's all, it's all, it's all in your head
Don't mind the future
We'll live, we'll live, we'll live, we'll live again
In a time when you want it
It's all, it's all, it's all in your head
Don't mind the future
We'll live, we'll live, we'll live
In your head, in your head, in your head ...
