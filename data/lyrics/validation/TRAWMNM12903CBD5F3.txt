(verse)
You keep telling me....me....me
That I'm way too sure
Of you loving me long time
But I bet you always will

In so many ways
I've rubbed off on you
And you been loving me long time
And I bet you always will
We're inseparable
'Cause your soul's with mine
And you been loving me so long
And I bet you always will

(chorus)
We could be on separate planets
Mars and Venus, heart to heart
No spaces between us, 'cause (you know, you know) hearts don't lie
I could stay here inside in this here city
And you go sail clear across the ocean
I bet you always will

(verse 2)
You can't take away
And you can't forget
That you've been loving me long time
And I bet you always will
You won't worry
'Cause its evident
That you've been loving me so long
And I bet you always will

(chorus)
We could live on separate planets
Mars and Venus, heart to heart
No spaces between us cause (you know, you know) hearts don't lie
I could stay here inside in this here city
And you could sail the ocean
I bet you always will

We could be on separate planets
The Earth or the moon, heart to heart
We're still in tune (you know,you know)
I don't even care if we're not together
'Cause that's the part that never lasts forever
I bet you always will

We could be on separate planets
Mars and Venus, heart to heart
No spaces between us cause (you know, you know) hearts don't lie
I could stay here inside this here city
And you could sail the ocean
I bet you always will... I bet you always will...always will
