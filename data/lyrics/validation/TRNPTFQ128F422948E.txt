Be not dismayed whate'er betide
God will take care of you
Beneath his wings of love abide
God will take care of you

God will take care of you
Through every day, o'er all the way
God will take care of you
God will take care of you

No matter what may be the test
Oh my God will take care, yes, of you
Lean, weary soul, on Jesus' breast
My God will take care of you
