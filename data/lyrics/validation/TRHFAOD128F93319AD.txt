[Intro 2]
Ya know
I'm just tryin' to show appreciation
You know, I think
I think you deserve it
Ya know what I'm sayin'?

[Hook]
Clap your hands now
People clap now
I said that you should get a round of applause

[Verse 1]
When you were born
See you should've had a standing ovation
From all the doctors
And the nurse
And the patients
They didn't realize what was really in the room
They were looking at a star
Like a rocket to the moon
Now you're all grown
Got that wiggle when you walk
Got that sweet soft voice
Little giggle when you talk
Turnin' heads
Stuff it, chuff it
Like everywhere you go
You get praise
You get love
From everyone you know
See, I don't normally
Make a song for a woman
I try to educate
And extinguish all the venom
Make shoes for the club
And such and such
But you captured my attention
So much, so much
So please don't lose sight of the subject
I'm not trying to treat you
Like inanimate object
I'm just tryin' to say that you
Deserve an award
Or much less
You really really need a round of applause
C'mon!

[Verse 2]
I never knew
A l- l- l- love like wait
Gotta be somethin'
For me to dedicate
Yes, you're a queen
Double than the empress
Double that nefarium
That cant
Whats your interest?
I wanna know
What makes you tick?
Do you tire
Of those ignorant guys
That make you sick?
That get proached
With no genuine
Love and affection
Only looking for that
Late-night bedroom connection
(cmon) Nah
Thats not your style though
Youre as bad as the next girl
But you dont give it up
Like it's pie doe (true)
And you dont want a man whose
Only interest is hydro
Talking about his
Shucking and his ducking from the 5-0
Please
Youve been independent
Only one initial
You carry on your pendant
Not tryin to say youre selfish
If it's yours, it's yours
Thats why you give it up
I think you should get a round of applause

[Segue]
Gods anywhere you go
Yes youre the star of the show
And everybody they know
They feel the light of your glow
You deserve more than my vote
Red carpets and velvet rope
Cameras should flash when they scope
I got your back if they dont

Yeah (yeah)

[Verse 3]
Before I hit it
Like a hurricane knit it
Let me pay my respects
By dialin up your digits
And tell you to meet me
In the beautiful place
I got the scene all set up
To whatever your tastes
And as you arrive
From that chauffeured-driven drive
And I see your car
Pullin up slowly outside
And you step into the room
Through the big double doors
First thing Im gonna give you
Is a round of applause

[Hook]
Clap your hands now

[Outro]
I think you really
Deserve a round of applause
Applause

Deserve a round of applause
Thats why this song is all yours
I think you really
Deserve a round of applause
Applause
I think you really
Deserve a round of applause
Thats why this song is all yours
