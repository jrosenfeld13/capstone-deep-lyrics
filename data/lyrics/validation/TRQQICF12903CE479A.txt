Never got lost on this road before
Never saw a scene on the street before
Never got chose with the rest of the boys
So I must have needed something more
Always wound up in a cell for the night
Always had faith from the midnight fight
Always got caught by a squad car light
Kicking at a slot machine

Now, I got a little of Veronica, love
The way she is checking me out is enough
Somebody's messing my brain, growing pains
Ooh, I got a little of Veronica, love
The way she is checking me out is enough
I'm glad to say that she's mine, right down the line
Growing up and I'm fine

Didn't find luck and I ran out of prayer
Couldn't find much that I wanted to share
Looked for a key, but I found despair
Must have done something bad
Now I see through to the back of this town
Kind of wear love like a long lost crown
Now I take pride in the way I behave
Never seen stalking around

Now, I got a little of Veronica, love
The way she is checking me out is enough
Somebody's messing my brain, growing pains
Ooh, I got a little of Veronica, love
The way she is checking me out is enough
I'm glad to say that she's mine, right down the line
Growing up and I'm fine

Don't bug me 'cause he ain't your man
Smell trouble on the back of your hand
I won't fight, so just back down
Because you know I might change my mind
I can't tell you but you know what's wrong
You gotta know that's she's gone, gone, gone
I can tell you're not satisfied
I don't want to dent your pride
