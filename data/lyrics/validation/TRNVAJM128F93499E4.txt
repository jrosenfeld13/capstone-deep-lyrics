[Intro: Swoope]
You are a god, you are a king
Truth's a facade, you are supreme
Believe what is real and poof goes the dream
You are the spawn, you are the seed
All that you see can be attained
Just gas it up, then feed the flame
If you should choose, you'll be the flame
Who cares what you lose, you'll beat the game
Embrace the death, this is the life
Morning begins starting tonight
So just shut your eyes, part with the light
Nothing is wrong, this way is right

[Hook: Bleecker & Swoope]
Wake up, open your eyes
The lies are in disguise
Mirage
Say hello to forever, goodbye to never
All facades die, truth is forever
Wake up, open your eyes
The lies are in disguise
Mirage
Say hello to forever, goodbye to never
All facades die, truth is forever

[Verse 1: Swoope]
Deception, infiltrating minds all around us
Men, women, and children, civilians, out-of-towners
Perception becomes reality in a town where
The dreams that we drink are the waters that drown us
Conception, as illusion
Where the dream is conceived no contraception
For the fluid
So the child that is born is a life that is sworn to exceptions
As delusions, hallucinations of America
Yes yes this is hysteria, this is America
Trends that we see, that alone's what we crave
The land of the free, yet the home of the slave
Land where the masters blast us with visions
Through prisms of plasma screens
Give all we got just to have that dream, to have that green
Paid an arm and leg now we amputees
Forget that we limpin'
Homie this is livin', homie this is pimpin'
Don't you see this chain on my neck
How I make it rain with my check
How I become famous for sex
People know my name on the set
Fly minus plane or a jet
Pop champagne get it wet
This fun is insane, but this gun's to my brain
This vision of livin' is playin' roulette
Facade that we believe, is all a big disease
Fall into a dream, causin' us to sneeze
Off to the ??? which evolve into a ???
The cost of this flossin' is causin' us to bleed
Your chain, your name, the plane, champagne
??? your relief
Enthralled by what we see, the snarl of the beast
He crawls into our sheets, and lulls us all to sleep

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Swoope]
Illusion, this is the genesis of our nemesis
Slick spirited lyricist, killin' it with the sentences
Delusion, that there is unlimited benefits
Fun, illicit privileges, joining in with the membership of lies
Hostages, entrapment is our happiness
With blindfolds over our eyes
Ostriches with quackers
And the plaster is disaster in a nice disguise
Heads in the sands of time
Tryin' to get ahead in this land of mine
Not knowing that we stepped in a land of mines
Ready to explode, if it's not exposed
The wool's been pulled over your eyes
What's cool is wolves in a disguise
Posing as grandma, and all the grandeur
Poison the camper, is what her plans are
Hoping that you don't see the claws where her hands are
Fronting with the grill and her grin where her fangs are
Little Red is rising into a falsehood
That the lights and the night life is all good
That the Trinity doesn't exist as a trio
Jesus can't save you, only trust the Neo
But the Trinity does exist as a trio
Jesus can save you, don't trust the Neo
Displaced in the fake tricks of the matrix
Set ablaze by the lasers from the spaceship
And enslaved by the mind state of the agents
That the sacred pages of the Rock of Ages are fables
Who's the DJ? Who turned the tables?
Who switched the labels?
None of this makes sense, who switched to pesos?
Who whispers life? Whose kiss is fatal?
When did the life that Christ offered us become alternative?
Only for the elderly and uptight conservatives
When did eternity become the past?
Why choose to fail in a life that will pass?
(Wake up, open your eyes)
The enemy's imagery is meant to these
Entering into the flickering flame
So when freshness fades, the death will stay
So don't assume that the darkness is light
Cuz the ends will begin your morning tonight
Don't assume that the darkness is light
The ends will begin your morning tonight
(Mirage)
Say hello to forever, goodbye to never
All facades die, truth is forever

Wake up, open your eyes
The lies are in disguise
Mirage
