A few questions that I need to know
So I ask them in a row
The world keeps moving & I am too
It's just a shame about you
You tried to break me with your game
I'm still here and just the same
You put me down but never out
You're off the list for showin' doubt
You can try but I won't crack
There's the door so don't look back
Here's the message for me to send
I'm stayin' here until the end
Alright clarts yo what's goin' on
Still strong when I blow up like a condom
A fresh page means another new chapter
Maybe sell a tune and get wrecked after
Still razz gotta fat gold chain
I'll make your mother hot coz I'm Adam Hussain
I sing what I want but I won't drop a clanger
An MC off the tee like golf to Bernard Langer
When I was a banger if I danced like MC Hammer
.......
Special kisses off a girl who's been on the third page
Back to basics coz it's a new day
Yesterday is our tomorrow
And tomorrow is our forever
This constopulation will become alighted.....or something like that
Modern life is rubbish if you know what I mean
There's no point in living unless you've got a dream
This song's for those who rely on luck
Who know the world is yours if you don't give up
It's a new day, let's start the uprising
Live in the now that's what I'm advising
Believe in yourself and don't give in to rage
50 hours a week on a minimum wage
A sweet for the kids and what their lives are missing
Living on a shoestring without a pot to piss/spit in
Some times are hard so i've got to explain
That you can find sunshine in the rain
Don't believe the hype life ain't about wealth
You'll never get broke if you're true to yourself
The grass is greener and it's deep fuckin' purple
Back to the start now we've come full circle
