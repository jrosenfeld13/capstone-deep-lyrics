I'm Blessed
Oh I guess
I'm the Luckiest Guy in the World
Oh Babe - you don't know what you do to me girl - No ooh ooh

Sometimes
I forget
To say the things I should say to you
Oh Babe, I spend all my time lovin you - Lovin You ooh ooh

(Chorus)
Your Love Makes me Strong
When things go Wrong
Oh I Betcha Didn't Even Know that

Your My Sun Shiny Day
When Sky's are Gray
Oh I Betcha Didn't Even Know That

You're my everything
My whole world revolves around you

In times
Of despair
You proved to me that your love is real
I like, I like the way that you make me feel, make me feel

So proud
I am
To be able to say your my own
Oh Babe
In Your love I found me a Home
Found Me a Home

(Chorus)
Ohhhh I Betcha Didn't Even Know That

I Betcha Didn't Even Know That (repeat x 9)

Your My Sunshine, Your My Sunshine

(I Betcha Didn't Even Know That)

And you're my Everything, you're my Everything

(I Betcha Didn't Even Know That)

You Make Me Ha-happy, You Make Me Ha-happy

(I Betcha Didn't Even Know That)

No No No No Oh No Ooh

(I Betcha Didn't Even Know That)

Oooh Oooh Ooh No

I know you Don't Know it Oh

(I Betcha Didn't Even Know That)

I wanna Spend my Life with ya, spend my Life with ya

(I Betcha Didn't Even Know That)

Ooh No

I don't want No Other Girls, no other Girls

(I Betcha Didn't Even Know That)

You Turn my skies from Gray into a Sunny Day

(I Betcha Didn't Even Know That)

Ooh No No No No Oh Baby

Oh

(I Betcha Didn't Even Know That)

Fade Out
