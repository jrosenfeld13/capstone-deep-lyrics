Love lyah, Love iyah
Peace and Love lyah
Love Iyah, Love Iyah
Just a little love Iyah
My brother says Love lyah
My sister says Love lyah
This life is not for the weak but for those whose hearts are strong
Hatred begets evil but with love you cant go wrong no I say
Love lyah, Love Iyah, Oh I say Love Iyah
All the people say Love lyah, Love Iyah, oh Love lyah
Come on children Love Iyah
Glory Train Love Iyah
They will rise in arms against you in the name of the lawmakers
And turn your brother against you and make wrong the good youve done
But I say
Lovelyah, Lovelyah
My brother says Love lyah
My sister says Love Iyah
And I say Love Iyah, Love Iyah
Peace and Love lyah, Love lyah
They will try to buy your souls with money
Bribing with milk and honey
Distorting the youths in their minds
Doping the wool they pull over their eyes
Is just another Love lyah, Love Iyah
My brother says Love Iyah
My sister says Love lyah
Ail the people say Love lyah, Love lyah
I and I say Love Iyah
Even the babe Love lyah
Jah call on the youth cause theyre strong
Dont give your strength in vain now
Seek ye first the Kingdom all good things shall be added
Here I say Love your enemies
Bless all those who curse you
Do good to them that hate you a tell you
Pray for those that oppress you
And tell them is one Love Iyah
Peace and Love Iyah
My brother say
Love lyah
