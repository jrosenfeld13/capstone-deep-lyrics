You are so beautiful to me
You are so beautiful to me
Can't you see?

You're everything I hoped for
You're everything I need
You are so beautiful to me

You are so beautiful to me
You are so beautiful, baby, to me
Can't you see?

You're everything I hoped for
You're everything I need
You are so beautiful to me

Oh, can't you see?
Can't you see, baby?

You're everything I hoped for
And you're everything I need
You are so beautiful to me
