For many years ago
He left his home behind
No farewells or a note
Like a thief he fled into the night

Heart full of foolish pride
He caused a death of his clan's man
All prophesies he denied
And now in exile he grieves

Hear the call of the fallen ones
Wisdom of those whose time has gone
Live your life bravely my first born son
On battlefields fight, don't run

The wheel of time keeps turning
A boy becomes a man
But still shame burns him
At last he understands

He heads back to his homeland
He rides fast like a storm wind
But the flames in the horizon
Tell there is only death to be found

Hear the call of the fallen ones
Wisdom of those whose time has gone
Live your life bravely my first born son
On battlefields fight, don't run

By the smoking ruins of his past life
He raises his hands to the skies
Oh god of thunder
God of my fathers
Strike me down for what I've done!

Hear the call of the fallen ones
Wisdom of those whose time has gone
Live your life bravely my first born son
On battlefields fight, don't run
