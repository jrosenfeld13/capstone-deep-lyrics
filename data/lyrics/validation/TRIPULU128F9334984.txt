At night we are alone
You keep your lights on, that's your medicine
Old dreams they come and go
Gonna keep your lights on, that's your medicine
And as we move in time
You feel the world turn, I am just the same
But more and more I find
You fear the changes, I am not afraid

I'm just trying to make it back home
I'm not trying to follow you
We are walking along the same road
I'm not trying to follow you

And I said all that I said only to give an answer

At least for your own sake
Don't bet your life on some new miracle
Our hearts are changing shape
Gonna bet your life on something physical
And as we move in time
You turn the sweetness into memory
Now you can do what you like
Cos we're not friends and we're not enemies

I'm just trying to make it back home
I'm not trying to follow you
We are walking along the same road
I'm not trying to follow you

England has all gone away
All away, I'm the sound
Everything's all gone away
But today, I'm the sound

I am the sound...

I'm just trying to make it back home
I'm not trying to follow you
We are walking along the same road
I'm not trying to follow you
