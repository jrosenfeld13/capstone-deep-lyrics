Dancing in the dark 'til the tune ends
We're dancing in the dark and it soon ends
We're waltzing in the wonder of why we're here
Time hurries by, we're here and gone
Looking for the light of a new love
To brighten up the night, I have you, love
And we can face the music together
Dancing in the dark
What though love is old
What though song is old
Through them we can be young
Hear this heart of mine
Make yours part of mine
Dear one, tell me that we're one
Dancing in the dark 'til the tune ends
We're dancing in the dark and it soon ends
We're waltzing in the wonder of why we're here
Time hurries by, we're here and gone
Looking for the light of a new love
To brighten up the night, I have you, love
And we can face the music together
Dancing in the dark
