[Chorus 1]
I don't want to be a star
Just want my chevy and an old guitar
I don't want to be a star
I don't need the fat cigar

[Verse 1]
My friends wonder what is wrong with me
Because I don't get off on my fame
I got so much confusion now
Sometimes I don't even know my name

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Too many distractions run through my brain
So many girls they start to look the same
Too many options no time to choose
Too many clothes, too many shoes
I've had the world I've done it upside down
I played the part and I've been the clown
Now it's my time, it's a brand new day
To be myself in a different way

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I got to meet all the wonderful people
I drank with Dylan boy did we act a fool
I got to meet all the fabulous people
I got high with Jagger, it was really cool

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Never, never, never
Never, never, never
Never, never, never
Never, never, never, hey
I say never no no
I say never no no no
I say never no no
I say never no no
I say never no no
I say never no no no no
Never, never

[Chorus]
