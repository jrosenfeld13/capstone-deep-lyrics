All alone in your pajamas
Writing letters to your grandma
She doesn't understand what's wrong with kids today
Things were better back in 1938
You go to school, do the homework
Extra credit, but you still feel like a jerk
Second captain of the debating club
You've got the GPA, but where is the dirty love?
It's not right
You're by yourself on a Friday night
Lost and alone
You've got to bark if you want the bone

Put your hands on my cashmere sweater
My cashmere sweater
Put your hands on my cashmere sweater
Don't it make you feel better?

You drive your friend to the rock show
You've got suspicions that she's kind of a ho
She disappears with the drummer
You're sitting on the curb, what a bummer
It's not fair
You're dying and no one seems to care
Take, take a stand
Put down the pencil case and take my hand

Put your hands on my cashmere sweater
My cashmere sweater
Put your hands on my cashmere sweater
Don't it make you feel better?
Come to me, I'm warm and fuzzy
