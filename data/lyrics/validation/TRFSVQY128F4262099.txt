Well I set sail to find the edge of the planet
Instead I fell off before I got to the ship
One morning you'll wake up and you're actually caring about all the things that you said you'd never want... think about

Doctor, Please!
There's something wrong with me
I haven't been this clever
In what feels like forever
Surgery won't cut it out of me
It's spread throughout my body
So don't you even try and take it out

All my friends wonder how I developed a habit
To disappear without leaving a trace
You'll find myself six feet under, boy have I carried myself way down

Doctor, Please!
There's something wrong with me
I haven't been this clever
In what feels like forever
Surgery won't cut it out of me
It's spread throughout my body
So don't you even try and take it out

And not a part of me will be left in the room
No I won't lie to you, when I can die for you
Whoa, I'm doing better now
No I won't lie to you, when I can die for you
YOW!

(Awesome guitar solo)

Doctor, Please!
There's something wrong with me
I haven't been this clever
In what feels like forever
Surgery won't take it out of me
It's spread throughout my body
So don't you even try
So don't you even try to take it out
