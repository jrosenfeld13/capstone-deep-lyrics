Take your clothes off, lay down, please
Freakin' me and I wanna do it with the lights on
I wanna see your body
Come on my freak
Oh, do you like when I'm doin' those things
Racin' back and forth in your love lanes
Well, let me unbutton your jeans
(Put a towel on the bed so we don't leave no stains)
I wanna do things to you
Things you like, I will try
Let's start tonight, I'll do it right
I'm goin' insane, I need your love things
Can I take off your shirt now, baby?
Can I take off your pants now too?
Can I slide off your Victoria Secret?
Now hush, let me just look at you
Wanna lay you down and touch your body
You're so sexy, you tie me on, shorty
Got you hopin' and you got me so horny
It's just the freak in me
Hey, can I tailor your birthday suit?
Clothes off, I'll take off mine too
I got major things I wanna do
(Knock knock, it's me, let me inside of you)
Lookin' in my eyes, read my mind
Search and find, feel me rise
Take your time, it's alright
Just say the word so you can be
Can I take off your shirt now, baby?
Can I take off your pants now too?
Can I slide off your Victoria Secret?
Now hush, let me just look at you
Wanna lay you down and touch your body
You're so sexy, you tie me on, shorty
Got you hopin' and you got me so horny
It's just the freak in me
Come here, baby
You know what I wanna do to you
Everything
Now that we're alone
Promise you will do those things
Do me, to me, girl, come on
(Oh, tweety sing)
There's nothing wrong
Setting your mind and body free
Baby, love me
It's the freak in me
Can I take off your shirt now, baby?
Can I take off your pants now too?
Can I slide off your Victoria Secret?
Now hush, let me just look at you
Wanna lay you down and touch your body
You're so sexy, you tie me on, shorty
Got you hopin' and you got me so horny
It's just the freak in me
Can I take off your shirt now, baby?
Can I take off your pants now too?
Can I slide off your Victoria Secret?
Now hush, let me just look at you
Wanna lay you down and touch your body
You're so sexy, you tie me on, shorty
Got you hopin' and you got me so horny
It's just the freak in me
Can I take off your shirt now, baby?
Can I take off your pants now too?
Can I slide off your Victoria Secret?
Now hush, let me just look at you
Wanna lay you down and touch your body
You're so sexy, you tie me on, shorty
Got you hopin' and you got me so horny
It's just the freak in me
