Can you feel it
Can you hear it
I'm gonna show you now

Catch the rhythm and jump
Jump till the sky, come on jump
Open you heart and we give you the strength

This is the holy noise
We make this holy noise
This is the holy noise

It's not a religion
It just make you feel fine
It's the one god and your free mind

Come on move
We give you the groove
Let's smash together

This is the holy noise
We make this holy noise
This is the holy noise

Just stay as you are
Just stay as you are
Just stay as you are

So I said

Just stay as you are
Just stay as you are
Just stay as you are

This is the holy noise
We make this holy noise
This is the holy noise
