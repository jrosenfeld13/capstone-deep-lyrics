Do you really wanna know me?
Do you care what's inside?
Can you ever really show me?
There's no secrets I must hide

If I bare my soul, can you accept it all?
My darkest corner's safe behind a wall
Do you really wanna know me at all?

I can't accept the pain
My brain screams like a runaway train
Trying to keep my heart on track
The embers turned to flame and I want you back

But I can't trust a memory
I can't trust a memory
No, I can't trust me

Do you really wanna know me?
Do you know what makes me smile?
Can you ever really promise me?
This time it's not a lie

I'll believe it's true
When you're standin' at my door
I'm always here for you
And I'll open it once more

Do you really wanna know me?
Do you really wanna know me at all?
Do you really wanna know me?
Do you really wanna know me at all?

Do you really wanna know me?
Do you really wanna know me at all?
