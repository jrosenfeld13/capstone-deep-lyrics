THE SNAKES ARE GATHERING AGAIN
THEY SLITHER AROUND YOUR HEAD
GOING TO TAKE YOU DOWN ONCE AGAIN
YOU'RE SO EASY JUST LIKE ME
WITH A CROOKED SMILE
SUCH A TWISTED LIE
TRUST DOES NOT MEAN ANYTHING
WITH A CROOKED SMILE
SUCH A TWISTED LIE
WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR LAST BREATH
SAY ONE THING
BUT I KNOW
SO HARD TO KEEP TRACK ON YOUR LIES
STAND SO CLOSE
BUT I KNOW
YOU WANDERED TO PLACES BEYOND
AND I MEAN WHEN I SAY
YOU'RE SLIPPING AWAY EACH DAY
HARD TO STAND IN THE MIDDLE
WHEN THESE ROOTS START ROTTING AWAY
TOGETHER AND HAND IN HAND
WE GO TOWARDS THE END
PULL THE KNIFE OUT OF MY BACK
I'LL RETURN THE FAVOR, I PROMISE
WITH A CROOKED SMILE
SUCH A TWISTED LIE
TRUST DOES NOT MEAN ANYTHING
WITH A CROOKED SMILE
SUCH A TWISTED LIE
WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR LAST BREATH
SAY ONE THING
BUT I KNOW
SO HARD TO KEEP TRACK ON YOUR LIES
STAND SO CLOSE
BUT I KNOW
YOU WANDERED TO PLACES BEYOND
AND I MEAN WHEN I SAY
YOU'RE SLIPPING AWAY EACH DAY
HARD TO STAND IN THE MIDDLE
WHEN THESE ROOTS START ROTTING AWAY
