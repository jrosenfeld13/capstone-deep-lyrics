Are we the living
Or are we the dead?
Do we keep ticking
Or do we dig graves?
They say it matters
Which path you choose
But we see clearly
That either way we lose

Are we the living
Or are we the dead?
Do we keep ticking
Or do we dig graves?
They say it matters
Which path you choose
But we see clearly
That either way

We are the living
The living dead
I don't regret it
It's just the way it is
Let the stars
Guide the fools
To their destiny
But I'll stay living
Living my death
