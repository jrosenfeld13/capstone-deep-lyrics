Santa's got a mullet and he's coming christmas eve
Santa's got a mullet, he's bringing gifts for you and me
Frosty's got a stovepipe hat
And rudolphs nose is red
Santa's got a mullet
Sitting on his head

Santa's got a mullet, keep on looking out for him
Driving in his hotrod, with the killer rims
Santa's got a mullet
As he's streaking through the night
Jamming to Foghat
And drinkings Coor's Light

Singing Fa la la la...
Singing Fa la la la...

Angels up in heaven are plucking on their harps
Santa's wearing Oakleys, and he's looking mighty sharp
Santa's got a mullet, and presents for all of ya
I thought he was from the Northpole but he must be from Canada
Oh yeah Santa's coming, don't you worry, he won't be long
Santa's got a mullet
Santa's got
Yeah Santa's got
Santa's got... a schlong
