Lullay, thou little tiny Child
By-bye lully, lullay
Lullay, thou little tiny Child
By-bye lully, lullay

O sisters too, how may we do
For to preserve this day
This poor Youngling for whom we sing
By-bye lully, lullay

Herod the King, in his raging
Charged he hath this day;
His men of might, in his own sight
All children young, to slay

Then woe is me, poor Child, for Thee
And ever mourn and say;
For Thy parting nor say nor sing
By-bye lully, lullay
