Now, my baby wasn't even decided
About our weddin' ring
When it come to our marryin'
It didn't seem to 'mount to a other thing

But I been dealin' with the devil
I been dealin' with the devil
I believe I been dealin' with the devil
My woman don't love me, no mo'

Well now, I've got the meanest woman
The meanest woman you most ev'r seen
She sleep wit a ice pick in her hand
Man, an she fights all in her dream

I sooner be sleepin' with the devil
I sooner be sleepin' with the devil
I sooner be sleepin' with the devil
My woman don't love me, no mo'

Now, my mother, she said one thing
You know an then father said the same
'You keep on foolin' 'round, Sonny Boy
'Women, really gon' change your name'

I been dealin' with the devil
I been dealin' with the devil
I been dealin' with the devil
My woman don't love me, no mo'

Spoken
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

Ah, you know I been havin'
You know, little, you know, friendly
Just friendly with the devil , you know

Yeah, but I got in little trouble
I don't do that no mo', watch!

Now baby, you know I ain't goin' down
You know, this big road by myself
Now, an if I can't take you
I'm gonna carry somebody else

Because I been dealin' with the devil, now
I been dealin' with the devil
I been dealin' with the devil
A-my woman don't love me, no mo'
