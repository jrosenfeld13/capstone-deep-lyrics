Oooh burnin' inside yeah I'm burnin' inside yeah
Oooh burnin' inside now I'm burnin' inside now yeah

Yeah

So many times have I asked you to tell me
That I'm your girl
Time after time I have needed a reason
Just to get inside your world
So many times have I asked you to ask me
How it feels to love
And when this love seems the only
Conclusion that I'm guilty of
Oh baby then you

Put your loving arms around me
And it feels like shelter when you
Put your loving arms around me
And inside your arms I'm burning
Put your loving arms around me
And you whisper to me when you
Put your loving arms around me
And inside this love I'm yearning

Mmmm

And sometimes the way that you act makes me wonder
What I am to you
And sometimes I can't stand the way that I'm acting
To be part of the things you do
Often I've asked you for too much of your time
Like I'm stealing
And when I dream of the fear that you're leaving
Then I reach out

My baby then you

Put your loving arms around me
And it feels like shelter when you
Put your loving arms around me
And inside your arms I'm burning
Put your loving arms around me
And you whisper to me when you
Put your loving arms around me
And inside this love I'm yearning
Yearning yearning
Inside this love I'm yearning

Oooh burnin' inside yeah I'm burnin' inside yeah
Oooh burnin' inside now I'm burnin' inside now yeah
Burning inside yeah I'm burning inside
Burning inside yeah I'm burning inside yeah
Oooh burnin' inside yeah I'm burnin' inside yeah
Oooh burning inside now I'm burning inside now yeah
Burning inside yeah I'm burning inside
Burning inside yeah I'm burning inside yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah

How many times have I asked you to tell me
That I'm your girl
Time after time I have needed a reason
Just to get inside your world
So many times have I asked you to ask me
How it feels to love
And when this love seems the only
Conclusion that I'm guilty of
Oh baby then you

Put your loving arms around me
And it feels like shelter when you
Put your loving arms around me
And inside your arms I'm burning
Put your loving arms around me
And you whisper to me when you
Put your loving arms around me
And inside this love I'm yearning
Put your loving arms around me
Mmm yeah

Put your loving arms around me
(Burnin' inside yeah I'm burnin' inside)
Put your loving arms around me
(Burnin' inside yeah I'm burnin' inside yeah)
Put your loving arms around me
(Burning burning burning burning)

Yearning burning yearning
Inside this love I'm yearning burning yearning
Inside this love I'm yearning burning yearning
Inside this love I'm yearning burning yearning
