Don't get too close
This shore is cavernous and cold
Too close is cavernous and cold
Cavernous and cold
You're collecting empty shells

Too late to scribe, alive in my soul
I'd rather hide than fight you, stealing my soul

A marbled ocean of steaming ghosts
They bore what's tavernous and told
A haunted ocean is tavernous and told
I am where the fearing dwells

Too late to scribe, alive in my soul
I'd rather hide than fight you, stealing my soul

Don't get too close
To this haunted ocean of steaming ghosts

Too late to scribe, alive in my soul
I'd rather hide than fight you, stealing my soul

Too late to scribe, alive in my soul
I'd rather hide, hide, hide, hide
Cavernous, cold
Cavernous, cold, cold, cold, cold
