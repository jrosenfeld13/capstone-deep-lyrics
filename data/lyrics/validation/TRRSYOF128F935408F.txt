I'm discontented with homes that are rented, so I have invented my own;
Darling this place is a lover's oasis, where life's weary chase is unknown
Far from the cry of the city where (the) flowers pretty caress the streams
Cosy to hide in, to live side by side in, don't let it abide in my dreams

Picture you upon my knee, just tea for two and two for tea, just me for you
And you for me alone
Nobody near us to see us or hear us, no friends or relations on weekend
Vacations, we won't have it known, dear, that we own a telephone, dear

Day will break and you'll awake and start to bake a sugar cake for me
To take for all the boys to see
We will raise a family, A boy for you, a girl for me, oh
Can't you see how happy we would be
