[Verse 1: Tom Clarke]
Don't let the sun go down, on an empire
It's too much to waste
Don't let the walls come down
Round an empire, it's too much to wave goodbye
We've been working for a long time
We've been fighting far away
Now in the streets men standing in lines they're all wasted anyway
You're living in an incestuous world
Where you're conscious holds no weight
You sold us down the river like rats then
You drowned and beat the brave

[Chrous]
You're not alone you know, you're not alone you know
You're not alone at all
You're not alone you know, you're not alone you know
You're not alone at all

[Verse 2]
Don't let the sun go down, on an empire
It's too much to waste
And don't let the rains come down, on our empire
It's too much to wash away
We've been working for a long time
We've been fighting far away
Now in the streets men standing in lines they're all wasted anyway
You're living in an incestuous world
Where you're conscious holds no weight
You sold us down the river like rats then
You drowned and beat the brave

[Verse]
You're not alone you know, you're not alone you know
You're not alone at all
You're not alone you know, you're not alone you know
You're not alone at all (yeah)
No, no
There's just too many dreams in this wasteland for you to leave us all behind
There's just too many dreams in this wasteland for you to leave us all behind

You're not alone, you know

[Outro]
You're not alone you know, you're not alone you know
You're not alone at all
You're not alone you know, you're not alone you know
You're not alone at all
