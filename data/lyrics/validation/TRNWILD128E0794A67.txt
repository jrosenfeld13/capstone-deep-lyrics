I often wondered about the past
Wondered if our love was going to last or end
Rumors described in a way to me
Makes it easy to see that they would bend, I was shy

Could lend one penny to spend
On feeling I hide from you
No matter what I did or tried to do
Oh, any, anytime to you, oh no

And when I'm looking into your eyes
Am I too blind to see that you can see me?
Whoa, oh oh, you see me
Ay, ay, ay

Now that you've found out what caused an end
It is foolish but I call you just a friend
Oh, but it's in disguise in a way to me

But you make it so easy to see
I could just be the one that you see
I tried to describe the things
I know there's no chance that we might meet again

And when I'm looking into your eyes
Am I too blind to see that you can see me?
Whoa, oh, you see me, no, no, no

I can't waste no time, I wish I could lend one penny
To spend on those feelings that I stop and hide from you
I stop, I'm really gonna let you see
Whoa, I ever, ever, ever, ever I know

I feel my health is falling
Feel life is most appalling
Then I find you there but
Whoa, helps alright

I said, baby, I'm alright
I said, oh oh, I'm alright
I'm alright, I'm alright
I'm all, I'm all, I'm alright
Baby, I'm alright if it's alright with you

I know there's nothing you can do anymore
Oh, oh, oh
