[Intro: T-Dre]
Mike G, why don't you drop us somethin' else?
Yeah, this jam goes out to all my gente cruisin' in them classic Chevrolets, you know what I'm sayin'?
This song was done a long time ago before you know who fucked it up
Yeah, Lighter Shade Of Brown

[Verse 1: T-Dre]
I'm just coastin' on a sunny day
Got my homies on the way but still mashin' in my Chevrolet
But hey, I'm only makin' necessary stops
Clownin' on the coast as the bass just drops
Out your box while your Six-Four [?]
Stupid ass folks tryin' front off the air shocks
Glidin', feelin' the atmospheric breeze
Punks don't touch my mic cuz it's T's
Yeah, the jam of the year, is right here
I lift the front so I can drop the rear
Just got back from the B-ball court
Me and Tee are just coastin' in the super sport
Say "What's up" to my homies from around the way
Keep cruisin' that flat six Chevrolet
They say, "Let's go chill at Waller"
So I waxed and polished, my '65 Impala
Pick up my friends around one
Now my friends are fightin' over whose gonna sit shotgun
Not to brag about my ride but my it's nice inside
This is strictly dedicated to the Brown Pride
And I'm Coastin'

[Chorus: Raylene (x2)]
Just coastin' with the top down on a sunny day
I got the homies on the way

[Verse 2: Deluxe]
Coastin', blew another phat track
T-Dre and I are gonna take it to the sky and see
Just what it's all about
Cuz foos around my way are gettin' jacked for their clout
Throw a little bit of hype, comin' up, burnin' stripes
Peep game when you roll tight
Clowning with the locs in the lowrider
Macking to the jainas on the [?] tryna [?]
But yo, I keep snapping, put my time in
And hopefully one day, drop the bomb and start rhyming
Flossing through the trucks like a freight train
[?] one time, make a train and for myself, make a name
D to the slash, [?] 'bout to show improve
Peace to my homies still cruising on the avenue
Hitting off ends on them triple gold daytons
Staying true to the game
Busting caps, ain't a damn thing changed
But even though, I might not make a stay
I'm still giving love to them homies that love me back
So let the beat just ride
As we take a little trip to the 805
And I'm coastin'

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: T-Dre]
Bring it back, one more time for your friends
I'm hitting off ends on my ride, side to side
But be careful when you come to the dips
Take 'em nice and slow
And try not to scrape off the chrome tips
But anyways, back to the happy days
I'm gonna keep continuing the skill that pays
And relax, listen to the T-Double-E
Cuz everything is alright in the S-M-V
805 coming back again
Deluxe and T-Dre kicking back, just cooling
With the J-C-C at a show
Joke is gonna take to the next plateau
Let it ride as we take you to another stage
As soon as we hit the avenue, there's an outrage
People breaking [?] as we pass by
Put it in neutral, hit the [?] as I wave bye
But there's more thing I gotta say before I ride
Lighter Shade, put your head between your legs and kiss your ass goodbye
While we take you for a spin
California lifestyle, C-O-A-S-T-I-N

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Deluxe]
Well it's 1995 and we hittin'
Bumpin' in the studio, straight to your car system
Let the window down, hear me flow
Automatic on the floor for my SS '64
Hoppin' like a dog in heat
I got them hoochies on sight as we roll down the street
[?], lowridin', I got the [?] on some [?] now I'm glidin'
You know the beat is on so lay back in the cut
While I, Deluxe, follow up with that punch
Let the system thump, drop the top and straight front
Cuz Cali Life Style's got the flavor of the month
Coastin', Floatin', hit the 3 wheel motion
Comin' around the corner, got your back
Now straight boastin'
Even though I'm comin' kinda soft on this funky track
I'm still laid back and holdin' nothing back
For the simple fact, this on me and my crew
And for those foos' that were waitin'
Lighter Shade, here's the I-O-U
It ain't through, it don't stop just like I told ya
C-L-S is rollin' out tracks and gettin' over
Coastin'

[Outro: T-Dre]
Coastin', aw yeah
Straight up Coastin' for the '95 season, you know what I'm sayin'?
Special shouts goes out to my homies at X-Men's Car Club
Straight Coastin' down Broadway
I know my boy, Deluxe, is Coastin'
Yeah and we outta here

[Raylene]
T-Dre's just Coastin'
Deluxe is just Coastin'
Raylene is just Coastin' in 1995!
Oooh
