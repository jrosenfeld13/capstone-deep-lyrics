Place the stones in a circle of twelve
Give my night to a brother of the bell
Rise from the light that swallows me whole
Dig yourself, dig yourself
Sun comes up one brave day
Foll of the cobra, dries the sweat off my face
Righteous meat, righteous town
Dig yourself baby, dig yourself baby
Down that medicine now, yeah baby
Down that medicine now, my my my baby
Down that medicine now, yeah baby
Down that medicine now, yeah baby
Bitch got soul she bathes on time
The Lord got lazy took the world from behind
Life is sweet, sweet as hell
Dig yourself baby, dig yourself baby
Down that medicine now, yeah baby
Down that medicine now, my my my baby
Down that medicine now, yeah baby
Down that medicine now
Brother and sisters, let us make no mother fucking mistake
Your violation will be televised baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Bitch got soul, bitch got soul
Bitch got soul, bitch got soul
