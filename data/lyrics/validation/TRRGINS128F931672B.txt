BLACK DIAMOND HEAVIES
But I'm bidin' my time
Cause that's the kinda guy I'm
While other folks grow dizzy
I keep busy
Bidin' my time

Next year, next year
Somethin's bound to happen
This year, this year
I'll just keep on nappin'

And bidin' my time
Cause that's the kinda guy I'm
There's no regrettin'
When I'm settin'
Bidin' my time
