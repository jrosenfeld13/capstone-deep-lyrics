[Verse 1]
Hey girl how you doing
Do you feel like talking?
Or do you need me to call you back
You from round what way and when's your birthday
Or what's your zodiac sign (I'm an Aries, what's yours?)
Well I'm a Virgo so my sign's compatible
So we gone get along just fine (I hope so)
What you do for fun cause I don't drink or club
I just like to chill with somebody like you, yeah

[Chorus]
Everything is cool when love is all brand new
Cause you're learning me and I'm learning you (it's cool)
When love is all brand new
Cause you're learning me and I'm learning you

[Verse 2]
What type of work you do or are you still in school
Or do you have any kids (and if I did, what?)
If you did, that's alright
See I'm the type that don't mind
Cause I can understand that things happen sometimes, yeah
By the way, I 'm wondering are you cool with your family
Cause I would like to meet your parents someday
Let's hang out this weekend
Maybe we can begin something wonderful and beautiful cause

[Chorus]
Everything is cool when love is all brand new
Cause you're learning me and I'm learning you (it's cool)
When love is all brand new
Cause you're learning me and I'm learning you

[Bridge]
Girl, it's so cool (yeah)
Talking with you (yeah)
It gets better every moment I spend with you
Girl, you're so nice (nice)
And you so fine (so fine)
Plus you're real and that's just what I like

[Chorus]
Everything is cool when love is all brand new
Cause you're learning me and I'm learning you (it's cool)
When love is all brand new
Cause you're learning me and I'm learning you
