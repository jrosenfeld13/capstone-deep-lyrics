Tell me do you remember when you were gazing through my window
Did you ever see what you thought
Or was my stature convicted, was I left missing?
Without any words at all
And all the promises I made
And all the people I made wait
Id wait for you to know

This dirt thats been paced at your feet
My past life, youve changed me
And your hesitation doesnt surprise me
Its your will to forgive that drives me

Your whispering to everyone, Im coming home where I came from
You dont know me from this

So dig me out of this hole
Wash away the dirt and show my roots
At the pity of your conscience
Please dont shun me, dont shun me

I can't take this pity from you
When I live for everything that you want
I am this make me your legend
And I walk alone

Without any words at all
And all the promises I made
And all the people I made wait
Id wait for you to know

So take my callous heart, protect your eyes
From the poisons youve been viewing
And all I know is your gone
And you saved me from myself this time
You saved me from myself
You saved me from myself this time
And you saved me from myself
