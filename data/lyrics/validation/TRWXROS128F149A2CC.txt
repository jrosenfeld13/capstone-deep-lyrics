I quote from memory
It's you that I see
I'm drifting through the years of love and all the mystery

A photograph of you
Our firstente-nous
The night I decided to say:"yes, I do"

The years were passing by
Everything I tried
Men should propose, Why were you so shy

Now all is said and done
For always you're my sun
In spite of all anxiety we never stopped having fun

Woohoooo
Woohoooo

Now we're growing older
Our mysteries unfolded
Every night you hold me tight,I sleep on your shoulder

All I do is dream
Our love is so extreme
I filled my life with laughte, and now our love stands supreme

Come sail with me
In my beautiful baloon
Now we live in holy matrimony
Come sail with me
In my colourful baloon
Our life is an eternal honeymoon

I quote from memory
It's you that I see
I'm drifting through the years of love and all the mystery

A photograph of you
Our firstente-nous
The night I decided to say:"yes, I do"
