Subtle manipulation, it all comes down to accommodation
Integrity of belief, integrity of behaviour
You reckon they are your saviour?

A generation of no return, howling, it becomes eternity
In a brief history of time
Does it at any rate indicate your maturity?

Disown the disorder; what about your past?
Negate and agitate; did you hope it would last?
Mind-control terminology at any level
Be sure they'll disconnect the rebel

Did you comprehend the vast chain of being?
Did you reach the inner (other)-worldly council?
Draw into yourself all the sensation
And see if it is your collective nation

Subtle manipulation, it all comes down to accommodation
Integrity of belief, integrity of behaviour
You reckon they are your saviour?
