Butchery, my meat hooks sharpened to penetrate
Emasculate, gouging crotches I will eat
Hung upside down, holes punctured through half chewed gristle
Debauchery with dead bodies, turning green

Upheaval of human entrails
Deterioration of grated genitals
Dangling from the hooks
Obscene feelings deep inside me

Dislocating, separating a blood-drenched body
Begin the anal grouting

Awaiting insertion
To rip out intestine
Bodily destruction
Vulgar molestation

Treachery, never ending soul ripping
Lifeless bodies rot, petrified
Clogging veins, pressure building
Scabbing clotted sores dehydrate
Condemned to life of obscurity
Dismal dimensions of my being
I explore my thoughts through murder
Devoting my life to mutilation

Screams of blood saturate
Grubs feed on dilapidated stumps
Darkness overshadowing...
The killing

Eyes now dilate
Bodies disintegrate
Razor sharp hooks implanted in your rectum
Splitting bodies, spilling guts on the ground
Sodomizing living beings with my utensils
Stabbing on your life stripped of all your skin
Disgusting to the world
Beauty to my eyes
The body lying naked
Discharging my infection

Invigorating while I kill, intoxicating
Invoking suffering on human beings
Grinding orifices my only therapy
Sculpting gore, muscle tissue
Reshaping mounds of flesh, deformation
Skulls of victims stacked like trophies
Bleeding from your arse, sudden blood ejection
