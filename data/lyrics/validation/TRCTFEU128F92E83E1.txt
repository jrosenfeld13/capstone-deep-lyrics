Days stuck in the memory and the nights in doubt
I need somebody friendly when the lights go out
I ain't too crazy about Elvis
But I'm sure there's a few there in Memphis
And I don't know about Jesus
But I'd still walk the waters between us

And all of my life
I've been looking for someone, someone that won't let me go
And all of my life
I've been looking for someone, someone that won't let me go
Someone that won't let me go

I sit back and imagine all the dots connect
I get caught in a backspin when I least expect
Is she feeling this lonely?
Is it worse than anybody in history?
Is she thinking "If only I could find someone I wanted to kiss me"

And all of my life
I've been looking for someone, someone that won't let me go
And all of my life
I've been looking for someone, someone that won't let me go

Go and do something I'm gonna regret
Gonna make think I'm cool
Gonna teach me just like school
Gonna make me feel I truly am the best
That I can get days stuck in the memory and the nights in doubt
I need somebody friendly when the lights go out

And all of my life
I've been looking for someone, someone that won't let me go
And all of my life
I've been looking for someone, someone that won't let me go

And all of my life
I've been looking for someone, someone that won't let me go
And all of my life
I've been looking for someone, someone that won't let me go
Someone that won't let me go
