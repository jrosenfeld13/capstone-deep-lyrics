This is a song that came upon me
One night
When the news it had been telling me
Bout one more war and one more fight and
I, I sighed
But then I thought about my friends
Then I wrote this declaration
Just in case the world end

Our guns
We shot them in the things we said
Ah we didn't need no bullets
Cause we rely on some words instead
Kill someone in argument
Outwit them with our brains
And we'd kill ourselves laughing
At the funny things we'd say

And bombs
We had them saved for special times
When the crew would call a shakedown
We'd break down a party landmine
Women that so sexy
They explode us with their looks
Ah we blowing up some speakers
Jumping 'round 'til the ground shook

And missiles
They were the road-trips that we launched
T-t-tripping 'cross this island
Starting missions at the break of dawn
Yawn and smile say
What direction shall we take?
Somewhere where it warm and wet
This be the route we'd always take and

[Chorus]
Our weapons were our instruments
Made from our timber and steel
We never yielded to conformity
But stood like kings
In a chariot that's riding on a
Record wheel

[Chorus]
Our weapons were our instruments
Made from our timber and steel
We never yielded to conformity
But stood like kings
In a chariot that's riding on a
Record wheel

[Chorus]
Our weapons were our instruments
Made from our timber and steel
We never yielded to conformity
But stood like kings
In a chariot that's riding on a
Record wheel

And our air-force flying
When the frisbee in the sky
Have a session while we're smoking
Now we're feeling extra high
And we'd sneak into a car-park
With the skaties on our back
And we're flying down the levels howling
"On the attack now, on the attack"

And battles
They happened in these dancehalls
See we'd rather fight with music
Choosing when the rhythm won
Battle at these shakedowns
And we'd battle at these gigs
We do battle in our bedrooms
Made some sweet love to the beat

And our allies grew
Wherever we would roam
See whenever we're together
Any stranger feel at home
In a way we are an army
But this army not destruct
No instead we're doing simple things
Good loving, find it, run amuck

This be a declaration
Written about my friends
It's engraved into this song
So they know we're not forgetting them
See maybe if the world contained
More people like these
Then the news would not be telling me
Bout all that warfare endlessly and

[Chorus]
Our weapons were our instruments
Made from our timber and steel
We never yielded to conformity
But stood like kings
In a chariot that's riding on a
Record wheel

[Chorus]
Our weapons were our instruments
Made from our timber and steel
We never yielded to conformity
But stood like kings
In a chariot that's riding on a
Record wheel
