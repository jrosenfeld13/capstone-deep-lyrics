Why don't you and I build a house of love
Just the two of us is all we'll need to warm it up
Make it yours and mine part of me and you
Let it always be where we come running to
Why don't you and I build a house of love
Let's fill it up to the brim
Oh light it up with loving and keep it shining
Where the late night hours will find us in each other's arms
Then we'll hide away and you'll be all mine
And we won't come out until we're satisfied
Why don't you and I build a house of love
Let's just you and I build a house of love
