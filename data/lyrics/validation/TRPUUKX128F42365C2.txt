If I knew what to do I'd do it
If I knew where to go I'd get there someday
If I knew where to fly I'd fly away, forget about life for a while
But it never is that easy to just pick up and go and do as you're told like
'cause life never works out that way
If it were true the skies would be full everyday

If I knew how to fly, I'd fly away
If I knew how to fly, I'd fly away
If I knew how to fly, I knew how to fly away

Well I'm lost at 22 and I've got no fucking clue
No I don't know if things will work out right
I'm lost and confused
I'm lost at 22 and I don't know if my life's gonna end up right
'cause they keep on telling me that I'm young, dumb and naive
But that's just what they want me to believe

Well I'd rather be lost at sea than become part of this society
Where the grass is always green and the air is always clean
At least that's what they want me to believe
At least that's what they want me to believe

I'm lost at 22
I'm lost at 22
I'm lost
