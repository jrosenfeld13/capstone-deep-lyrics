We talk a little, relationshit
While listening to, "Lover's spit"
My thoughts go like... doedoeroetoetoe
And every time we, avoid a kiss
We're talking all, but relationship
And when you bring some, common sense
My eyes go like... doedoeroetoetoe
Everyday I work on the road
I pave it 'til it turns to gold
And every day that I am away you say you miss me
And every second I am away yeah it hits me
The giggles and the scent and the need make me dizzy
Maybe one day we'll awake and it will fall into place
So finally we, talk common sense
It doesn't work out, we'll act like friends
We smile a little... doedoeroetoetoe
If you still mean it, have a sip
On ending our, relationship
With every second, that goes by
Can you hear it? doedoeroetoetoe
Everyday I work on the road
I pave it 'til it turns to gold
And every day that I am away you say you miss me
Yeah every second I am away yeah it hits me
The giggles and the scent and the need make me dizzy
Maybe one day we'll awake and it will fall into place
-- music solo --
Now months have passed, another planet
And instincts rise, just to forget it
Still everyday it hits, doedoeroetoetoe
So many nights, nothing to say
I'm kept awake, by girls with fake names
Everything forward, no looking back
I'll have another sip doedoeroetoetoe
Everyday I work on the road
I pave it 'til it turns to gold
And every day that I am away I know you miss me
Even when I seem to stay I'm not with you
Right now I'm just an inch away you can't get through
Maybe one day we'll awake and it will fall into place
Every second I am away yeah it hits me
The giggles and the scent and the need make me dizzy
Maybe one day we'll awake and it will fall into place
