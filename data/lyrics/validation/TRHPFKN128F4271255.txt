[Verse 1]
Casey is an old man who wants to be a teen
He goes to all the dances and they call him cha-cha King
He cha-cha's when the band is playing rock and roll
He tries to keep in time but the beat leaves him cold

[Chorus]
Because he's too pooped to pop, too old a soul
Hips getting weaker when he tries to do this stroll
And every time his feet get to go in one way
Here comes a new dance and it's going to stray

[Verse 2]
Chicks told Casey, you better move man
This is only a one night stand
Casey wasn't in time but he was dancing awhile
Till a cramp caught his leg and he had to change his style

[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 3]
Casey finally learned to do the hoochie koo
This might have been fine back in '22
Now, I'm going to give you fellows just a little tip
If you want to keep your girl you'll better get hip

[Chorus]
Or, you'll be too pooped to pop, too old a soul
You hips are getting weaker when you'll try to do the stroll
And every time your feet getting to go in one way
Here comes a new dance you'll be left to stray
