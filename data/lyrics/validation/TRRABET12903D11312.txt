I know -- the policies of war
I know -- the ruthless sacrifice
I know -- that broken toys explode
You know -- I'll never compromise

Born into -- smashing divisions
Religious conviction in lime
Moral repression depression
Our cattle are starting to drive

Your reason for breaking the heart and your mind
Usurp the beliefs of last few who cry

Fucking tourist start your drive to mundane existence
This lifer could give a fuck
If you had your own opinion
