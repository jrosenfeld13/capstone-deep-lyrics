Gonna take a trip down the Mississippi line
Way down yonder, Georgia's on my mind
Gonna take a ride, gonna spend my money too
Baby, that's what I'm gonna do
There's a lot of places I ain't never have been
There's a lot of faces I ain't never have seen

Gonna take a trip down the Mississippi line
Down to Birmingham, where the corn is high
Gonna take a ride up to Memphis, Tennessee
Back again to New Orleans

So come on with me
Come on and see
We're doin' fine, my baby and I
Got a long way to go
We're doing fine, my baby and I
Down the Mississippi line

There's a lot of places I ain't never have been
There's a lot of faces I ain't never have seen

Gonna take a ride down the Mason Dixon line
Down to Macon, Georgia, me oh my
Gonna take a ride, yes I'm gonna take a ride
Down the Mississippi line

So come on with me
Come on and see
We're doin' fine, my baby and I
Got a long way to go
We're doing fine, my baby and I
Down the Mississippi line
