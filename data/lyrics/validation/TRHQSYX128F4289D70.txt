I'm a man in the rain
Here they come now, Teddy Boys
I'm a bad man all alone
I belong here, Teddy Boys
Oh, maybe I'm just lookin' for something nasty
Songs I'm gonna sing in jail
Or maybe I'm just lookin' for some affectations
Before somebody comes and kicks me out of the club
I'm a man, maybe two
And I see you, Teddy Boys
Like a mad dog in a dream
I want ice-cream, Teddy Boys
Oh, maybe I'm just lookin' for something nasty
Songs I'm gonna sing in jail
Oh, Bobby's not in trouble, baby, it's his birthday
And now somebody's come to kick me out of the club
Teddy Boys, Teddy Boys
Call me Jack anyway, could be fun
Here they come, anyone
You don't have to be clean to be seen
I'm a man movin' uptown
And the fat boys are trackin' me down
Oh my God, so I run and I run and I run
Till I'm right back laughin' with you
Ooh, Teddy Boys, Teddy Boys
Ooh, Teddy Boys
