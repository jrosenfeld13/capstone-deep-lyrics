As far back as I can remember
I either had a plow or hoe
One of those 'ole nine foot sacs
Standing at the old turn row

[Chorus]
Down in Mississippi
Down in Mississippi
Down in Mississippi where I was born
Down in Mississippi where I come from

They had a hunting season on the rabbit
If you shoot em you went to jail
Season was a always open on me
Nobody needed no band

[Chorus]
I remember, I use to walk down that gravel road, walking with my grandma
Mississippi sun, beaming down
I went to get some water

My grandma said, young 'un you can't drink that water
She said you drink from that fountain over there, heha
And that fountain had a sign
Said for color only
I was so glad I had my grandma and my papa, a huh
And I won't leave you out grandpa
My grandpa was so proud of me y'all
I went down in forest Mississippi one time na
Didn't know no better, but I integrated
Awasha terrier
He was telling everybody, my grandbaby mavis
She went up to washa terrier, and washed some clothes
And all the black ladies fallowed her on up in there
I'm proud of my grand baby
I saw many more of those signs as I lived in Mississippi
I'm so glad I can say that I saw everyone of those signs
Dr. King saw that everyone of those signs got taken down
Down in Mississippi

[Chorus]
