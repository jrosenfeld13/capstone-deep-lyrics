When I see you, when I see the things you do
When I hear you, when I hear the things you say
I wonder what I'm doing here
Hanging on to what I know is going wrong
Maybe I'm intentionally blind
Maybe I'm wiser than I think
Maybe I'm intentionally blind

Is it history repeating itself?
Is it science, biology or something else?
That leads me down familiar streets
Ignoring warnings and the danger signs that I see
Maybe I'm intentionally blind
Maybe I'm wiser than I think
Maybe I'm intentionally blind

You tell me you're good for me
And believe me there's no other place I'd rather be
When I'm down and need someone to hold me tight
That's the moment that makes it all alright
Maybe I'm intentionally blind
Maybe I'm wiser than I think
Maybe I'm intentionally blind
