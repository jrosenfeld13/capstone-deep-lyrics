Some win by inches
Some win by sweat
Can't take no chances
Got to hedge your bet
Competition
Ooh, competition

Gotta be a little better
That the best on your street
'Cause it's tough in the jungle
Ehen you've got to compete
Competition
(Competition)
Oh, competition

What you can't buy in this world
You know you can steal
You've got to be ruthless
To be number one, ooh...

Competition, you got to fight to stay alive
Competition, it's a struggle to survive
Competition, you know it's rough out on the street
Competition, once you've decided to compete

No satisfaction
Only quiet despair
Unbending heroes
Trapped in Darwin's nightmare
Competition
(Competition)
Ooh, competition

Deep in the arms of desire, yeah
How does it feel
To have what you've wanted
Since you were so young?
Yeah

Competition, you got to fight to stay alive
Competition, oh, it's a struggle to survive
Competition, 'cause it's rough out on the street
Competition, once you've decided to compete

Competition
Competition, oh, yeah
Competition
Look at the mess that we're in
Competition
Yeah, there's a better way to live, yeah
Competition
(Competition)
Competition
Yeah, yeah!
