I just saw you look at me
Tell me do you want what you see
And I was kind of wonderin'
Why you're sitting alone - you're just too cute
Is it that you want me to go over there
If you don't...
You better come over here

Slide over, baby
Slide over, baby

Don't you want me to get real nice and close
Baby I will
You're the kind of girl who wants the male to do the work
You gotta change
Why look as though there's fear
Cause baby, I know why you're here

Slide over, baby
Slide over, baby
Slide over, it's getting to hard for me
Slide over

I lie in my room alone
The other side of my bed is so cold
I might be only 19, but baby...
You can still grab a hold
I bet you wouldn't mind it
If I held you tight... all night
Slide over... baby
Slide over
Slide over, it's getting to hard for me
Slide over
Don't make me wait too long
