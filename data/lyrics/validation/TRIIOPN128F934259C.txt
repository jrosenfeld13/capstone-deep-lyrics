[Verse 1]
Jesus is just a Spanish boy's name
How come one man got so much fame?
To any me, it's pointless to anybody
That doesn't have faith
Give me the cloth and I'll wipe my face

[Chorus]
When it's all gone, something carries on
And it's not morbid at all
Just when natures had enough of you
When my blood stops, someone else's will not
When my head rolls off, someone else's will turn
And while I'm alive, I'll make tiny changes to earth

[Verse 2]
So you can burn me cause we'll all be the same, the same way
Dirt in someone's eyes cried down the drain
I believe in a house in the clouds
And God's got his dead friends round
He's painted all the walls red to remind them they're all dead

[Chorus]
And you know when it's all gone, something carries on
And it's not morbid at all just when natures had enough of you
When my blood stops, someone else's will not
When my head rolls off, someone else's will turn
You can mark my words, I'll make tiny changes to earth
And while I'm alive, I'll make tiny changes to earth

While I'm alive, I'll make tiny changes to earth
Tiny changes to earth, tiny changes to earth
