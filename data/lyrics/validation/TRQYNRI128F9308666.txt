[First Voice: Colin Meloy]
My true love went riding out in white and green and gray
Past the pale of Offa's wall where she was won't to stray
And there she came upon a white and wounded fawn
Singing, "Oh, the hazards of love"

She, being full of charity, a credit to her sex
Sought to right the fawn's hind legs when here her plans were vexed
The taiga shifted strange the beast began to change
Singing, "Oh, the hazards of love."
Singing, "Oh, the hazards of love."
You'll learn soon enough the prettiest whistles won't wrestle the thistles undone, undone

Fifteen lithesome maidens lay alone in their bower
Fourteen occupations paid to pass the idle hour
But Margaret heaves a sigh her hands clasped to her thigh
Singing, "Oh, the hazards of love."
Singing, "Oh, the hazards of love."
You'll learn soon enough the prettiest whistles won't wrestle the thistles undone, undone
Undone, undone, undone
