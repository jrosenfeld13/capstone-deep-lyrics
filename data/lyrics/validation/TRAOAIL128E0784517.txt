Stacey:
You took me up, drew me in
Like a moth to your flame
Put your jinx in a deadly kiss
Your body locked me down in chains

Rochelle:
Didn't read the danger signs
Til you crept into my mind
Made me believe you were so in
Love I was memorised

Boys:
Fell down to earth now baby
I heard my wake up call
You're not a high I can't get off

All:
Too little too late girl
Didn't now what you had til its gone (Stacey: Don't tell me you're sorry now)
Too little too late girl
Can't get back what's already lost
Now you're alone

Frankie:
I still see your reflection in a corner of my head
You're the tainted mirror image
That my heart has to reject

Stacey:
So I've gotta keep my distance
When you tell me you can change
You can't burn me with
The heart of your love
Cause I've put it in the shade

Boys:
Nothing you can do can phase me
Since I got my wake up call
You can't do your damage like before

All:
Too little too late girl
Didn't know what you had til its gone (Stacey: Don't tell me you're sorry now)
Too little too late girl
Can't get back whats already lost
Now you're alone

Boys:
Can't turn back the clock
Can't make the moment stop
And every time I look at you
And hesitate
I get a trigger in my mind
That makes me rewind
And remember how you blew my heart away
