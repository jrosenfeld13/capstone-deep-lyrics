Moonlight descends in the land of the shadows
The cold moon is rising, over blood red skies
Wolves' cries in the freezing night
Gathered in the twilight to summon the master below

Rising shadows over blood red skies
Mournful cries through the darkened night

Darkness spreads in a shape of evil
Over the rising kingdom of Transylvania
Shadows surrounds the ancient castle
The palace of death far away where no light exists

In the realms of Transylvania
The purest blood shall flow
The mortals shall please
The hunger of the undead souls

Shadows over Transylvania
Darkness in the land of frost
Whispers in the winds of evil
Storms in the blood red skies
