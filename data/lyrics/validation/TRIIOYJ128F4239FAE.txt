Somewhere in your mind
Every one can hide
Their soul, their mourning
Your memory confined

No one can be found
But they are still around
Like mindstalking
In ivory surrounds

Calling out your enemy inside
Like mindstalking
Intruder of life, call no more
Like mindstalking

Silently you fight
The anger in your cry
A sound invoking
The enemy inside

I reveal your shame
Sacred and profane
A crime revoking
Your memory in vain

Calling out your enemy inside
Like mindstalking
Intruder of life, call no more
Like mindstalking
