You taste a drink in your hometown
You smile for the things you've known
That's when you were playing games
You couldn't hope to play today

Dare you look to the future
The spped the pages turn
Today your hope
For tomorrow is to smile anyway today

Don't pray to a god
We're in this together all the way
From the old to the young
And from the cradle to the grave

Look to yourself
Because there's plenty of wealth
In us all
If we fight the good fight
The we gonna have to fall to us all

Do you remember the smells of childhood
Do they still come once in a while
Perhaps you're still full of that passion
Well if you go on then smile

Chorus
