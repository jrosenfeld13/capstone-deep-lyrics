What's California?
With them streams, and the creeks
Running down, down to the sea
Oh, let me see
I love a latex earned ice age
Descended upon the pint-sized children and the fathers
And the children of the land la la
Though the ice is repulsive to them
When the winter, it bloody clings
And the summer, it moves along
Oh, hit the road and hit the wrong
Oh move along, my bait's all right la la la
Make one famous, make next sick
Upon my collar I'll feel your prick
Row with the poly la la
I really do need you la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la
Oh this rain it's so rough
Cause I really do need you la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la
Oh the tree not so rough
Because it's a holy woods
And it's a holy creeks
And there's some holy streams
And they will rise and go on
They will rise from great occasions
And they will run from the falling apart
They will rise from great occasions
And they will rise, rise from the dust
Oh there's love in the creeks and
Oh there's love in the streams and
Oh there's love in the creeks and oh
