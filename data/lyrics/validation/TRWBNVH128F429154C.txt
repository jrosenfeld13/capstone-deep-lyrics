You say you're tired of TV Cartoons
Searchin' for taxis on wet afternoons
Telephones ringing and grey city streets
Sweet talking salesman in flashy boutiques
I think you're right and I want you to know
I've found a place where I think we should go

Ah Kailakee Kailakoo
An island near North Venezuela
On Kailakee Kailakoo
We'll spend the rest of our day

You'll do the fishing down by the shore
I'll build a home with a coconut floor
You'll find a parrot I'll teach it to speak
Tropical songbirds will sing you to sleep
Then when we think we're alone on this land
I'll find a footprint right there in the sand

Ah Kailakee Kailakoo
An island near North Venezuela
On Kailakee Kailakoo
We'll spend the rest of our day

Ah Kailakee Kailakoo
An island near North Venezuela
On Kailakee Kailakoo

We'll spend the rest of our day
When we get older we'll think of today
Laugh at the taxman who never got paid
Now that it's settled we'll call up our friends
Give them the things that we won't use again
I think you're right and I want you to know
I've found a place where I think we should go

Ah Kailakee Kailakoo
An island near North Venezuela
On Kailakee Kailakoo
We'll spend the rest of our day

Ah Kailakee Kailakoo
An island near North Venezuela
On Kailakee Kailakoo
We'll spend the rest of our day

Ah Kailakee Kailakoo
An island near North Venezuela
On Kailakee Kailakoo
We'll spend the rest of our day

Ah Kailakee Kailakoo
An island near North Venezuela...
