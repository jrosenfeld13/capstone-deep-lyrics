Goodbye, my love
I am going
I am slowing you down
I can feel you stop breathing when I come around
I'm slowing you down

Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday
Love turns its back and just stands in my way

Goodbye, my love
You don't get me
You don't let me inside
You once kept me close when you wanted to hide
You pulled me in close just to push me aside
Goodbye

Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday
Love turns its back just to stand in my way

Goodbye, my love
I'm going away
I know you won't follow me far
Once I went out just to look at the stars
I asked you to join me, but you were too tired
I wanted you to see them, too
Why did I let myself need you?

Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday

Goodbye, my love
I am going
I am slowing you down
I can feel you stop breathing when I come around
I'm slowing you down

Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday
Love turns its back just to stand in my way
