Why must you say those things
What are you thinking
Keep your feelings inside wait 'til no-one's around yeah
I can see this is no good
All you talk about is how I should be
I've had enough of feelin down I think I'm going downtown

What makes you think those things
What makes you think those things
What makes you think those things
What makes you think those things you do (repeat)

What I do what I don't do what I want to
What you see that I feel that you're not use to
What I give how I live who I'm close to
What makes you think those things you do
What I say when I'm away how I know you
How I look I never took I don't owe you
So anything that I bring I won't show you
What makes you think those things you do

What makes you think those things
What makes you think those things
What makes you think those things
What makes you think those things you do

Do what I wanna do
Do what I wanna do
What makes you think those things
What makes you think those things
What makes you think those things
What makes you think those things

What I do what I don't do what I have to
How I feel what is real wanna show you
By the way I don't play I don't want to
What makes you think those things you do

What makes you think those things
What makes you think those things
What makes you think those things
What makes you think those things you do
