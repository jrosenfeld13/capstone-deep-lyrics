[Verse 1]
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair
I wouldnt be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere
You got something I want plenty of
Ooh, a little touch of your love

[Verse 2]
Hazel, stardust in your eye
Youre going somewhere and so am I
Id give you the sky high above
Ooh, for a little touch of your love

[Verse 3]
Oh no, I dont need any reminder
To know how much I really care
But its just making me blinder and blinder
Because Im up on a hill and still youre not there

[Verse 4]
Hazel, you called and I came
Now dont make me play this waiting game
Youve got something I want plenty of
Ooh, a little touch of your love
