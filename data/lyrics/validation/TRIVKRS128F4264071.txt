Take this hammer and carry it to my captain
Tell him I'm gone, tell him I'm gone, tell him I'm gone
Take this hammer and carry it to my captain
Tell him I'm gone, just tell him I'm gone, I'm sure is gone

This is the hammer that killed John Henry
But it won't kill me, but it won't kill me, but it won't kill me
This is the hammer that killed John Henry
But it won't kill me, but it won't kill me, ain't gonna kill me

It a long ways from East Colorado
Honey to my home, honey to my home, honey to my home
It a long ways to East Colorado
Honey to my home, honey to my home, that where I'm going

John Henry he left his hammer
Layin' side the road, layin' side the road, layin' side the road
John Henry he left his hammer
All over in red, all over in red, that's why I'm gone

John Henry was a steel driving man
But he went down, but he went down, but he went down
John Henry was a steel driving man
But he went down, but he went down, that's why I'm gone
