I hear about you and all the things
The things that you do
And the hurt that it brings
I don't understand your reasoning
And I don't know why

You think that you can do things your way
A fool can only satisfy himself
My life's not perfect as you can see
It's just that I possess a broken heart

You claim to believe in forgiving love
Forgiveness is yours if you'd look up above
I can't understand your reasoning
And I don't know why
