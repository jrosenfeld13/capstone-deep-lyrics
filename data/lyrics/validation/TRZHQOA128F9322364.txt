Where are you heading towards?
You know you're not looking backward
Please don't leave me standing by
It's been a long time passin'
Thought it would be everlasting
Not all happen as it may

It's very sad, but true
I'm getting unattached to you
It feels as if a strain will call me
Telling me about all the appalling things you do

All dressed up with open guns
Spoken smart plays in a billion
Don't forget the curse of you

You don't wanna be too much this
You don't wanna be too much that
You wanna be nothing at all

It's very sad, but true
I'm getting unattached to you
It feels as if a strain, you'll call me
Telling me about all the exciting things you do

Don't count me out, monsieur
It's not appropiate
I don't wanna be there in your place

I have a box of pleasure
I hid the key as a treasure
For measure, won't you come and see?

It's very sad, but true
I'm getting unattached to you
It feels as if I--you explain, oh
You explain is "you're so ... when I'm embarrased to..

..See you"
