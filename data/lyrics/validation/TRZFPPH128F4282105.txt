It's not that bad
We could have died
Chalk it up to being young
Prove it was me

On a morning drive
A blurred headlight
From the corner of my eye
If only you were here right now
You'd tell me

Wouldn't it be something
If everything changed
Wouldn't it be something in your way
Wouldn't be more than
Livning in your wake
If you and I would ever cease to be

You summer dress
A late downpour
And how it caught us on the stairs
That silent song you sing to me
Keeps sayin'

Wouldn't it be something
If everything changed
Wouldn't it be something in your way
Wouldn't it be more than
Living in your wake
If you and I would ever cease to be

We bend I break
You fall we scrape
I blame it all on being older now
I'm still singin'

Wouldn't it be something
If everything changed
Wouldn't it be something in your way
Wouldn't it be more than
Living in your wake
If you and I would ever
Yeah...
If you and I would ever cease to be
