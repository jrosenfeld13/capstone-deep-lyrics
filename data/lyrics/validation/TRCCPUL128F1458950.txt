Faster than a falling star
Ever so close and yet so far
And I believe in everything
And I believe in everyone

Under the weather
We should be over the moon
The soul awakening

Forest hillor mountain grey
Dreamy weather to make you stay
And I believe in everything
And I believe in everyone

Under the weather
We should be over the moon
The soul awakening

Firelight, this promised land
Golden beach and yellow sand
And I believe in everything
And I believe in everyone
