Maybe we think we've
Such high and mighty flyers that
Heaven won't let us in
Maybe it turns out
We've been lied to
The whole time
I cannot wait for the dawn to come
It's "mind this station again"
My friends
There's no reason to wait in line
There's no trouble out there
You know you have to learn anyway
Yea, we're all waving goodbye
Here's you rock
Spit on me
For the roof almighty
God you trust
Don't follow him
Yes, 'cause justice knows another plan
On the seventh day the soldiers died
Into a fairly middle class
The kind of love that doesn't last
