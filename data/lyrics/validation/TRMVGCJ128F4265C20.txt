Tell me why, though I try to forget
Tell me why, why I think of you yet
I know I'll never be free
What has happened to me?

Tell me why, when we danced until three
Tell me why, why my heart couldn't see
I never dreamed of romance
Never gave it a chance

When I think of how you looked that day
In your gown of silk and lace
Should have known the day you came my way
That this was the time and the place

Tell me why I keep fooling my heart
When I know it was love from the start
Why don't we give it a try?
If you know, tell me why

Tell me why I keep fooling my heart
When I know it was love from the start
Why don't we give it a try?
If you know, tell me why

Tell me
Tell me why
