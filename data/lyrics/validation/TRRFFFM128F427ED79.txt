You're better off without him, don't call him
He's breaking your heart
He's hanging with your best friend and you're waiting there
It's tearing you apart

He lied to you a thousand times
When I was there, he kept you waiting

And I'm still here, waiting there
To catch you if you fall
I don't know why I care so much
When I shouldn't care at all

Finally got the nerve to tell you
How much you mean to me
You said that I was your best friend
A real sweet guy, but that's all I'd ever be

[Outro]
"Alright, listen to me. You pull up right where she lives, right? Before you get out of the car, you lock both doors. Then, get outta the car, you walk over to her. You bring her over to the car. Dig out the key, put it in the lock and open the door for her. Then you let her get in. Then you close the door. Then you walk around the back of the car and look through the rear window. If she doesn't reach over and lift up that button so that you can get in, dump her."
"Just like that?"
"Listen to me, kid. If she doesn't reach over and lift up that button so that you can get in, that means she's a selfish broad and all you've seen is the tip of the iceberg. You dump her, and you dump her fast."
