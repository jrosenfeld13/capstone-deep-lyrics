Here am I in this, world of mine I just keep pacin' the floor
There's this guy and he, keeps on buildin' things and slammin' my door
He's been in my dreams, and I'm sure I've seen him hauntin' before

Herobrine ain't real, but I know that I can't take this no more, yeah

But oh man here we go again, here we go again doin' what you do
Yeah I stopped pretendin' it, pretendin' it's not really you
No I don't wanna believe, wanna believe that it's all true
But here I'm so terrified, so terrified, oh man I'm through

So I cross my world, and I know tonight
That you're always gonna give me one more fright
And yeah I've denied it a million times
But I know you're gonna give me one more fright

Trying to run away, but somehow I keep on seeing you 'round
If it's not a hole, in the wall you've put a redstone torch down
Every day I find, myself always checking behind my back
Lava everywhere, yeah I wish I could say it was a hack, yeah

But oh man here we go again, here we go again doin' what you do (doin' what you do)
Yeah I stopped pretendin' it, pretendin' it's not really you (not really you)
No I don't wanna believe, wanna believe that it's all true (that it's all true, yeah)
But here I'm so terrified, so terrified, oh man I'm through

So I cross my world, and I know tonight
That you're always gonna give me one more fright
And yeah I've denied it a million times
But I know you're gonna give me one more fright (ooh, yeah)

(ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Yeah gonna give me one more fright
(ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Yeah gonna give me one more fright
(ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Yeah gonna give me one more fright
(ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

But oh man here we go again, here we go again doin' what you do
Yeah I stopped pretendin' it, pretendin' it's not really you
No I don't wanna believe, wanna believe that it's all true
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

So I cross my world, and I know tonight, (woah-oh, woah-oh)
That you're always gonna give me one more fright (oh, oh-oh-oh, oh)
And yeah I've denied it a million times (oh I've denied it a million times)
But I know you're gonna give me one more fright (oh gonna give me one more fright)

So I cross my world, and I know tonight, (yeah, yeah)
That you're always gonna give me one more fright (yeah, yeah)
And yeah I've denied it a million times (yeah, yeah)
But I know you're gonna give me one more fright (yeah, yeah)
