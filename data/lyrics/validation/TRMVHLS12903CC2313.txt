Please tell me you'll fight this fight
I can't see without your light
I need you to breathe into my life
Don't tell me this is goodbye
I won't grieve - it's not yet time
Each breath breathed is keeping hope alive

So keep breathing
Go on, breathe in
Keep on breathing
Go on, breathe in
Just breathe

Each breath breathed means we're alive
And life means that we can find
The reasons to keep on getting by
And if reasons we can't find
We'll make up some to get by
'Til breath by breath, we'll leave this behind

So keep breathing
Go on, breathe in
Keep on breathing
Go on, breathe in
Just breathe

All you have to do is breathe
All you have to do is breathe

So keep breathing (All you have to do)
Go on, breathe in
Keep on breathing (All you have to do is)
Go on, breathe in
So keep breathing
Go on, breathe in
Keep on breathing
Go on, breathe in
Just breathe
