Endless nights filled with misery
Sick of familiar patterns
Bruise after cut
Can't wash away my scars

This is a night of...sal-vation, salvation....
On the night of sal-vation, salvation...

This life always painted me
Tired of the same routine
All the lies I've told
Can't hide the little things

This is a night of...sal-vation, salvation
On the night of sal-vation, salvation

Life has been left behind me
I will not cower away
Cower away

Adrenaline stronger than ever
Feel it all come together
(x2)

On the night of...sal-vation, salvation...
On the night of sal-vation, salvation...

Life has been left behind me
I will not cower away

Salvation(x4)
