Don't know where you been
I don't know what you do
But I'm so tired of lies
Why should I keep track of you
If you won't be
True to me
Then feel free to leave

But don't forget I let you in
And now I let you out again
You have yet to win
My heart, my friend

Don't know where you go
I don't know who you see
But I'm so tired of lies
What do I have to believe
If you say your mine
One more time
I'll know your lying to me

And don't forget I let you in
And now I let you out again
You have yet to win
My heart, my friend

Don't know where you go
I don't know what you do
But I'm so tired of lies
Why should I keep track of you
If you won't be
True to me
Feel free to leave

But don't forget I let you in
And now I let you out again
Don't forget I let you in
And now I let you out again
Don't forget I let you in
And now I let you out again
Don't forget I let you in
And now I let you out again
Don't forget I let you in
And now I let you out again
