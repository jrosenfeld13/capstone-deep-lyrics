Tell that taxi driver to leave your beat up suitcase in his cab
And tell him youre not staying here
And this time Im not picking up the tab
Here you are knocking on my door
Coming back like you done before
But Im not gonna listen anymore
Anymore

Dont blow no smoke on me
Just save your lies for another day
Dont blow no smoke on me
Just say goodbye
Cant you see Im wise to your ways

Where were you last summer
When teardrops fell like raindrops from my eyes
You stayed away all winter
And I barely found the courage to get by
Somehow I made it through
And right now I dont need you
So save your breath and dont say youll be true
Youll be true

Dont blow no smoke on me
