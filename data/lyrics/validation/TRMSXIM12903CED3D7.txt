Hard times here and everywhere you go
Time is harder
Than ever been before

The people are driftin'
From door to door
Can't find no heaven
I don't care where they go
I don't care where they go

And you said you had some money
But you'd better be sure
You'll never get down
This low no more
You'll never get down this low no more

When you hear me singing
This lonesome song
And the people these hard times
Can't last us so long
(can't last us so long)
