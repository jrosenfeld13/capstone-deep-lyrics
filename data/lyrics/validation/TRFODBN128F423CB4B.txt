I started out to write you this letter

But it ended up another song

I am sorry that the news cant be better, dear John

When we started out I thought we were different

We ended up exactly the same

So in order to protect the innocent

The names have been changed

I just got to get back to my music, to my music

And I know that we both promised forever

Forever didnt last that long

Maybe someday I will write you a letter

Until then at least I wrote you this song, dear John

I just got to get back my music, and all the things that go along with the job

And lying in bed with the room spinning round

Its the price that you pay when youre on the way down

Its the price that you pay

Sincerely yours...
