Night, follows me when you're gone
And now...how am I to carry on?
But into the night...
...into the darkness
I must be strong, carrying on

Night, follows me when you leave
And tonight, my mind is under siege
So into the night...
...into the darkness
Unto the morn, carrying on...

Hate as your co-conspirer
He'll set your soul on fire
Hate, make the flames get higher
Kneel for me now...
VAMPIRA!!!

GO!!!
HEY, HEY!!!

Night, follows me when you leave
With the sights, and the sounds you'd not believe
So into the night
Into the darkness
Until the morn
Carrying on and on and on...

Hate as your co-conspirer
He'll set your soul on fire
Hate, make the flames get higher
Kneel with me now...
VAMPIRA!!!
