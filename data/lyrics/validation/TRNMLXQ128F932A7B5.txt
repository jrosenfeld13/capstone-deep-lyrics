[Chorus] X2
Nuff people a cry bout Dem Nah get no bly
Who no get no bly a no try dem no try

[Verse 1]
As a little youth weh dung a middle east
Sometime war and sometime peace
Never want fi de a loyer, Doctor or prist
Nider a beggerman nider a thief
Israeli policy to join di Army
To serve and protect my country
Me let di army and my family
Falla reggae music come a kingston City

[Chorus] X2
Nuff D.J. a cry bout dem no get no bly
Who no get no bly a no try demno try

[Verse 2]

Nuff CHICABOWOW inna reggae nation
See AL CAPONE de we a fi listen weh him se
With him ye-ye-ye it a echo eveyweh

From Jammys though Bobby straight up to Grammy
See Buju de-prince of truth and right
No matter weh dem a se and all di fight dem a fight girl

Get up, stand up, stand up for your right
Chant reggae music with a born israelite

[Chorus] X2

Who no get no bly a no try dem no try
Some people a cry bout dem no get no bly
Who no get no bly a no try dem no try
