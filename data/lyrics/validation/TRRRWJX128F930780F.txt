[Verse 1]
Baseball season's underway
Well, you'd better get ready for a brand new day
Hey, Chicago, what do you say?
The Cubs are gonna win today

[Chorus]
They're singing
Go, Cubs, Go!
Go, Cubs Go!
Hey, Chicago, what do you say?
The Cubs are gonna win today

Go, Cubs, Go!
Go, Cubs, Go!
Hey, Chicago, what do you say?
The Cubs are gonna win today

[Verse 2]
They got the power
They got the speed
To be the best in the National League

Well this is the year
And the Cubs are real
So come on down to Wrigley Field

[Chorus]
We're singing, now
Go, Cubs, Go!
Go, Cubs Go!
Hey, Chicago, what do you say?
The Cubs are gonna win today

Go, Cubs, Go!
Go, Cubs Go!
Hey, Chicago, what do you say?
The Cubs are gonna win today

[Verse 3]
Baseball time is here again
You can catch it all on WGN
So stomp your feet and clap your hands
Chicago Cubs have got the greatest fans

[Chorus]
(Keep on singing, now)
Go, Cubs, Go!
Go, Cubs, Go!
Hey, Chicago, what do you say?
The Cubs are gonna win today

(Let's go!)
Go, Cubs, Go!
Go, Cubs, Go!
Hey, Chicago, what do you say?
The Cubs are gonna win today!

(Teach a man!)[?]
Go, Cubs, Go!
Go, Cubs, Go!
Hey, Chicago, what do you say?
The Cubs are gonna win today

(Take charge!)
Go, Cubs, Go!
Go, Cubs, Go!
Hey, Chicago, what do you say?
The Cubs are gonna win today
