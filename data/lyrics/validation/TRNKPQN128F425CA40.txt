Do, do, do-wah
Do, do, do-wah
(Goin back, goin back)
Im going back to country living
Where the air is fresh and clean
Going back to natural living
Where the grass grows tall and green
And the skies can be seen
Ill say goodbye to Kingston city
City life is not for me
Going where the stars shines brightly
And the sound of natures voice
Goes in the scene
Cause theres room enough for both of us
Time enough to tell
All the things you wanna do
Country life
Oh with you, yeah with you.(goin back)
Yeah, yeah
I'm Going back to country living
Thats where I was meant to be
Gonna take life nice and easy
Country town is my (?)
Gonna live as I please, ooh ooh
Cause theres room enough for both of us, yall
Time enough to tell
All the things you wanna do
Country life
Oh with you, yeah with you
Going back to country living
Thats where I was meant to be
Gonna take life nice and easy
Country town is my old hometown
Gonna live as I please, yes
Cause theres room enough for both of us, now
Time enough to tell yall
All the things you wanna do
Country life
Oh with you, yeah with you
Theres room enough for both of us, now
Time enough to tell yall
All the things you wanna do
(Country) life
Oh with you, yeah with you
