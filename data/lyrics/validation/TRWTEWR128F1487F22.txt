Things ain't working out so very fine
I seem to be running out of time
I thought I'd won your heart
I thought I'd learned my part
But now I'm back at the start
Still learning my part
Learning my part

Things ain't working out so very fine
You say I keep stepping out of line
Well all I did was say
"I like you every other way!"
Till now it seems I've broke her heart
I'm learning my part
Learning my part

Things ain't working out so very fine
Things ain't working out so very fine

I say "stay" and she just goes away
I say "bye for now" and she says "stay"
I smile at her and she says "why?"
I laugh and she begins to cry
I really don't know where to start
I'm learning my part
Learning my part

Things ain't working out so very fine
Things ain't working out so very fine

If I talk she says I talk too much
If I get too close she says "don't touch"
She says I waste my time
And then she says she's mine
I really don't know where to start
Learning my part
Learning my part

Things ain't working out so very fine
Things ain't working out so very fine
Things ain't working out so very fine
Things ain't working out so very fine
Things ain't working out so very fine
Things ain't working out so very fine
