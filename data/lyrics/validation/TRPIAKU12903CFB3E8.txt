Well I was sitting, waiting, wishing
You believed in superstitions
Then maybe you'd see the signs
Lord knows that this world is cruel
And I ain't the Lord no I'm just a fool
And a loving somebody don't make them love you
Must I always be waiting, waiting on you?
Must I always be playing, playing your fool?
I sang your songs, I danced your dance
I gave your friends all a chance
Putting up with them wasn't worth never having you
Aw, maybe you've been through this before
But it's my first time so please ignore
The next few lines 'cause they're directed at you
I can't always be waiting, waiting on you
I can't always be playing, playing your fool
I keep playing your part
But it's not my scene
Want this plot to twist
I've had enough mystery
Keep building it up
But then you're shooting me down
But I'm already down
Just wait a minute
Just sitting, waiting
Just wait a minute
Just sitting, waiting
Well if I was in your position
I'd put down all my ammunition
I'd wonder why it had taken me so long
But Lord knows that I'm not you
And if I was I wouldn't be so cruel
Because waiting on love ain't so easy to do
Must I always be waiting, waiting on you?
Must I always be playing, playing your fool?
No I can't always be waiting, waiting on you
I can't always be playing, playing your fool, fool
