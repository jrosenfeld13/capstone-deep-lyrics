The moon above you
It seems so sad
But that's not the reason
Why I feel so bad
I can't believe you're walking out that door
To go and fight some crazy war

Some politicians
Are born without hearts
They declare new borders
Tear families apart
You came into my life many years ago
I pray to god you'll come back home

(Chorus:)
I will fight by your side
For peace that lasts forever
And I will scream to all mankind
We're all in this together
I pray every mother's son
Will someday lay down his gun
I will fight by your side
I will fight by your side

Your father died
On the day you were born
Did you ever know
What he was fighting for
They send you far away
Where I know the world's on fire
I only have one desire

(Chorus)
I will fight by your side
I will fight by your side
I will fight by your side
I will fight by your side
