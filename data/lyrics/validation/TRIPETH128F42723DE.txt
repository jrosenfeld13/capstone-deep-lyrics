I wanna play with fire

[Verse 1:]
Even in the pouring rain
Even in the stars above
I'm here with you again

Even if we're not in love
We'll dance together in the dark
I know how to light the spark
I'm burning up with my desire

I wanna play with fire
Ah Ah Ah
I wanna play with fire
Ah Ah Ah

[Repeat x4:]
Ah, aah, ah, aah, ah, aah, ah, aah, ah

[Verse 2:]
Guess this is where it all begins
When we let the music play
Wanna drag me in
Taste me like champagne
And let your hands go everywhere
On my body
Through my hair

Your moves are so amazing
You know it makes me crazy
Ah Ah Ah
I wanna play with fire
Ah Ah Ah
I wanna play with fire

[Repeat x4:]
Ah, aah, ah, aah, ah, aah, ah, aah, ah

[Chorus:]
Don't stop it, no
Surrender to the beat just you and me
Just like it used to be
Set your heart free when you surrender

Don't stop it, no
'Cause I can feel the heat of you and me
Just like it used to be
Set your heart free when you surrender

[Bridge:]
I can barely breathe
I can not believe
There's only you and me
Moving
Desperately
Suddenly dance the dance

[Repeat x4:]
Ah, aah, ah, aah, ah, aah, ah, aah, ah

El beso
Otro beso
Nada se compara
Only you to me
Nothing means more to me

And when we can't get enough
And history repeats
I only hear the sounds
Of your voice echoing

We'll do it all again somehow
Because it feels so good
We'll do the things that
Everybody else wishes that they could

[Repeat Chorus:]
