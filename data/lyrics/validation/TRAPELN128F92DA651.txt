The machines never died
The machines never died

The recurring threat of technology
Can be used to confine populations
It's not a reason to reject it all
Just the minds who abuse the knowledge

The machines never died
The machines never died

Saw it once in a dream
Buildings extend
Mankind the sea

It'll happen
Culture mesh into one
See it now as we open our eyes

We will traverse the empty season of now
We will be vindicated
We will be vindicated

The machines never died
We will be vindicated
The machines never died
We will be vindicated
The machines never died
We will be vindicated
The machines never died
We will be vindicated
