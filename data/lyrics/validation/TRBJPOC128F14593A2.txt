It's a world of laughter
A world of tears
A world of hopes
And a world of fears
There's so much that we share
That it's time we're aware
It's a small world after all
[yodelling]
There is just one moon
And one golden sun
A smile brings
Friendship to everyone
Though mountains divide
And the oceans are wide
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small world a-a-after all
It's a small world after all
[yodelling]
It's a small world after all
It's a small world after all
It's a small world a-a-after all
It's a small world after all
Though the mountains divide
And the oceans are wide
It's a small world
[yodelling]
After all...
