Died for the flag and the master
Cried for the road to disaster
For real, bad deal
Only death in their eyes
They found the graves
At the fields of Vietnam
For life we're breaking you down
Bloodbath on the ground
It's their turn to die
Full metal jacket
Fight for the Star Spangled Banner
Survivor, but what is to live for?
Dark dreams at night
Walk the earth like a cursed
Take stand, don't hide
Face the shadows tonight
For life we're breaking you down
Bloodbath on the ground
It's their turn to die
Full metal jacket
For life we're breaking you down
Bloodbath on the ground
It's their turn to die
Full metal jacket
