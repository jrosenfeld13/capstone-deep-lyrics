Well, here comes the daylight
Here comes the dirty sun
Another sleepless night
Just to find my way home
You left me for dazed
I'm amazed that I'm still breathing
Unstuck in time, it's so sublime
Just being here

Are you looking for a ghost in the crowd?
I'm drifting along between the day and the night
Shot down, right before my prime
But I'm trying to see the light
Yeah, I'm trying to see the light

There goes serenity
There goes my gravity
When you lose your heart
You don't ever have to bleed
Too many spirits here
Drifting around and around, yeah
Speaking in silence
Am I lost or am I found? Yeah

Am I looking for the ghost in the crowd?
Walking the line between the day and the night
Shot down, right before my prime
But I'm trying to see the light
Yeah, I'm trying to see the light
Well, I'm dying to see the light
Get it right

Well, here comes the daylight
Here comes the dirty sun again
Another sleepless night
Just to find my way home
Take the bottle away
Before I have too much to think
Another morning comes
And I'm gone in the blink of an eye

I am a ghost in the crowd, yeah yeah
Drifting along between the day and the night
Cause I'm shot down right between my pride
And I'm trying to get it right
Now, I'm trying to get it right
And I'm trying to get it right
Trying to get it right
