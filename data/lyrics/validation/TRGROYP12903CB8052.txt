I need violent dying
I need quiet time
If you don't believe me as I slide in the sea ...
It doesn't matter much to me
I lie down and I float nowhere
I know why, because I lie
Just hearing my mouth open
I feel the water on my skin
Dry
I scorn and shame you
Berate and blame you
I beg you to come to me
It's easy; you let me
Don't leave me
Now you won't come out tonight
Your clothes are clung to you with fright
How am I here again
I fear the mornings as they pull near
I need violent dying
I need quiet times
Hear me, save me as I slide in the sea
No hands, no one. No
