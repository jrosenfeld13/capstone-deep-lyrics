There's a big race down in Dallas
Don't you wish that you were there?
You could bet your bottom dollar
On that iron gray mare

Had a black horse named Delilah
And I raised her on the farm
There was thunder, there was lightning
On the day Stewball was born

Won't you bet on Stewball, she might win win win
Bet on Stewball she might win
Bet on Stewball, she might win win win
Bet on Stewball she might win

So I sold off my possessions
And I headed for the town
I brought Stewball here to Dallas
And I laid my money down

Won't you bet on Stewball, she might win win win
Bet on Stewball she might win
Won't you bet on Stewball, she might win win win
Bet on Stewball she might win

All the children are a-laughin'
And the women, they a-cryin'
All the menfolk are a-hollerin'
Old Stewball, she's a-flyin'

Won't you bet on Stewball, she might win win win
Bet on Stewball she might win
Won't you bet on Stewball, she might win win win
Bet on Stewball she might win

Won't you bet on Stewball, she might win win win
Bet on Stewball she might win
Won't you bet on Stewball, she might win win win
Bet on Stewball she might win
