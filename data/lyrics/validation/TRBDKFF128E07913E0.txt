You painted offense while you plead a defense
You took advantage of average
You pleased those deceived but couldn't earn me
My god wouldn't use his leverage

If faith had an eight-hundred number
I'd disconnect myself
If I had to be a member
I'd rather be left out

You fell for those lies while they took your mind
Your eyes were closed from the inside
Your heart was so full of infomercial
You couldn't hear the blind talking

If faith had an eight-hundred number
I'd disconnect myself
If I had to be a member
I'd rather be left out

Stay away
Away from me
Stay away

If faith had an eight-hundred number
I'd disconnect myself
If I had to be a member
I'd rather be left out
