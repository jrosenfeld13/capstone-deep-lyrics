When you see that feathered friend better get out of the way
Especially if they're packing a piece better arm yourself today
It's us or them have to stop them in their tracks
Always keep watching your back
It's time to kill not a time to die so load your weapons now
There's a dark cloud on the skyline better shoot those suckers down
They're out to get you, you'd better be first
Give them what they deserve
Guns don't kill duckling, ducklings kill ducklings
Stop them all they will destroy our whole society
Guns don't kill duckling, ducklings kill ducklings
They're the biggest threat to your masculinity
It's not a sport if the other team doesn't want to play
Need to lend a helping gun don't let them get away
Pick on someone with a limited I.Q
Start shooting at someone like you
Guns etc
They're here to start the fight
Look in your sights what do you see?
Is it the innocence you call the enemy
Or is it a sad reflection on your capacity to deal with your
Fucked up inbred violent tendencies
