On a day-to-day there's no way most men make it through
I got to tell you now
Family tied to me, I'm doing just what I got to do
I got to tell you now
All a man's got is his word and to keep himself free
Do with your life what you will, stay away from my family
Born blue collar been working since I was thirteen
My father was up at five and broke his back to keep us clean
My mother sweated and slaved and suffered for the family
So when you push me don't think that I won't shove
I got to tell you now

What does it take to be a man, what does it take!?!

On a day-to-day there's no way most men make it through
I got to tell you now
Family tied to me, I'm doing just what I got to do
I got to tell you now
When I was a young man I was told to take a stand
And damn it boy, you better stick to a plan
So on a day-to-day you better walk a man's path
Learn how to walk a man's mile, get that game face smile
Don't put up with people who get in your way
And when you push don't think that I won't shove
I got to tell you now

What does it take to be a man, what does it take!?!

Work!!!

What does it take to be a man, what does it take!?!
