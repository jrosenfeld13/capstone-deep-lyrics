So the king went riding
On a silver horse
Quit the throne
Gone running

For a bit of sugar
And a bit of salt
He waged a war
About nothing

But it's alright
Yeah, it's alright
The king is dying
Come out with me tonight

Take on the world
Take up your act
Take out your violence on the sun

You're a speck of dust
I'm a speck of dust
One day we'll fall on everyone

Can we try laughing
Instead of fighting on the phone
Dancing on our own
And the King's in the corner saying

Don't look down
Don't look down
Don't look down
Don't look down

I can't walk
I can't talk
I'll probably find our home
Like a dog chasing a bone

The sky is laughing
The sky is laughing
At me
At me

So when the devil asks you
What went wrong
Just tell the beast
His kids are in the garden

You can find a million
Faults in me
But darling you can't say
I gave you nothing

It's alright
Yeah, it's alright
Oh, you look so good
Come out with me tonight

Come out with me tonight
