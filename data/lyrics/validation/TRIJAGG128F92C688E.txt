If I need to be curious
I'll hold it back
If I seem to be serious
I'll spout it out

Last year was the best that I ever had
Last year was the best and I sold you that

Now I hear your voice again
It's like someone listening
I know that you're there
Someone listening
I know that you're there
If you're not in this world once again

Watch the way you backstroke across the room
Arms out floating
It consumes me
You haunt in your trail

Last year was the best that I ever had
Last year was the best and I sold you that

Now I hear your voice again
It's like someone listening
I know that you're there
Someone listening
I know that you're there
If you're not in this world
If you're not in this world
If you're not in this world once again

Sure you won't
You won't be coming back
