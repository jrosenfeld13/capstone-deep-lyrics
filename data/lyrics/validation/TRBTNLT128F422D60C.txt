Brouwer-Gibbs-S. Hurley-P. Hurley

Bedside table spilled with this and that
I tried to damn the memories but lipstick on the glass - lipstick on the glass

She told me everything you do comes back around
The answering machine rewinds a hollow sombre sound - hollow sombre sound

Got a hole in my head
Got a hole in my heart
Got a hole where my soul's supposed to be
Can't you see this is hard for me

Something blue is spilling to the ground
I tried to turn the faucet off I still need you around - still need you around

Got a hole in my head
Got a hole in my heart
Got a hole where my soul's supposed to be
Can't you see this is hard for me

Got a hole in my head
Got a hole in my heart
Got a hole where my soul's supposed to be
Can't you see this is hard

Got a hole in my head
Got a hole in my heart
Got a hole where my soul's supposed to be
Can't you see this is hard for me
This is really hard for me
This is really hard
