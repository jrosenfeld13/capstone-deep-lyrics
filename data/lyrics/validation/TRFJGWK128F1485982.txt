We're playing games
I'm not your man
All this romantic shit I can't understand
You say you love me
Well you should know
I got a history of playing it touch and go
Yes, we are friends and we can f**k
And we may learn to like each other
If that's our luck
It's life and death
It's sun and rain
Come on and gamble
We'll dance in the pouring pain

(Chorus)
Swing high, swing low
Dance dance in the pouring pain
Girl, rock to that or rock alone
Dance dance angel for me

Call me your lover
Call me your man
All this possessiveness, I can't understand
I got a name, my name is Alex
You wanna chill with me it won't be in no place
We on the run
The time will come
To ditch the glamour and learn how to handle a gun
I ain't insane it's sun and rain
Come on and gamble
And we'll dance in the pouring pain

Chorus

Dance angel with me
So painful to be

Angel let's tango with rainbows
LIke riders on the
Rainbows we tango like angels we're
Riders, we're riders on the storm

Tracy 2 Step, what a shame
I step 2 step she couldn't hang
Wendy Walts talked the game
Left her crying in the rain
Jen Jitterbug what a dame
3 step 4 step went insane
And none of them know what beauty sprang
And only grows in the pouring pain
Sue Sue, Rockin' Sue 5 step 6 step
Sad and blue
Gorgeous Grace always true till that day
I told the truth
Pretty Paula you had the flame, 7, 8 step
Then the same
And none of them know what beauty sprang
And only grows in the pouring pain

Chorus
