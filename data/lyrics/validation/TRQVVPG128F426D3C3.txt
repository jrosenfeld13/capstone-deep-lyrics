49 hours and 46 minutes to go
But who's counting. i just thought
I'd let you know
I filled my head with your voice
And now I'm drowning
Well I wrote this song for you

You can stay tonight
And make everything alright
You can hold me down
And tell me that you're right
Tell me what it's like to be alone

And we have this down
Unlike everybody
I'll spend a million nights
Just like tonight you know
I screamed your name at the sky
Until I lost my voice
Well I'd give my life for you

You can stay tonight
And make everything alright
You can hold me down
And tell me that you're right
Tell me what it's like to be alone

You can stay tonight...

You can stay tonight
And make everything alright
You can hold me down
And tell me that you're right
Tell me what it's like to be alone
