Yeah-yeah, Magno ya heard huh
AKA Magnificent, Wildlife/Desert Storm South mayn
Hey say I got the South locked right about now, you know I'm saying
I'ma need ya to hold me down up top too, when it go down mayn
(once again back is the incredible, the incredible)
Magno ya heard, yeah

[Magno]
Mag's back, collecting his cash stacks
Laptops in the beamer, I'm checking my Nasdaq
You only as good, as how you wrecked your last track
Check my last 8, I'm doing this for fun besides the cash great
Oh and did I mention, I'm from the Lone Star State
Getting eight bucks, a tape
Anything less, than you fake fucks'll wait
I'm getting cash up, you ain't got the right to ask
Plus these fags on my ass, like a diaper rash
I dropped the New Print, and made quick cake dummy
And then popped up, on MTV Mixtape Monday's
Hmm not bad, I came around quick
Seem like only last week, I had my shit on Soundclick
Cop the real, or the CD-R
Results the same, I'm giving the game CPR
DVD's coming soon, fuck your VCR
Wanna know my influence, bitch read these bars
Bitch read these bars

(*talking*)
(Now hold on now boy, I'm your host I'ma tell you the real
You going too hard for em, you need to calm down)
These niggas think they fucking with me mayn
(naw, you need to clam down, I tried to tell you)
Wildlife/Desert Storm fucking South

[Magno]
C taught me how to pimp, 'Face showed me how to cock a pump
P taught me game, Bun showed me how to pop a trunk
I got a holster, that hold three 9's on it
Leave your shirt, looking like somebody squeezed Heins on it
I know I'm good, that's a part of me that you'll hate
Bringing more soul singing, than R&B Screw tapes
That's real, I'll cave on your dome
Cheese legal so I'm in the Regal, with Raven Symone
Just getting a lil' dome, she like to blaze it alone
Cop the new home, came with a maid in a thong
Ha-ha I'm so fly, style's pure gravity
Flow's so sweet, I'm giving you ear cavities
Dames on cock, that's why I snitched on the kid from G-Unit
I'm the reason, the game's on lock
I'm a H-Town nigga, riding swangs on drops
We swang on cops, if they try to plant dope on us
We swang on cops, bang on cops
If it was beef, thank God that you here
But I was platinum and smiling, a prank call at your crib

(*talking*)
That's what that is mayn, who can fuck with me
Magno ya heard, Wildlife/Desert Storm South
Taking over the Third Coast, and beyond nigga ya know
Wiliferecords.com, desertstormsouth.com nigga
Yeah, Shouts out to that boy Stack Bundles mayn
You doing a fool on the CD baby, New Print in stores
