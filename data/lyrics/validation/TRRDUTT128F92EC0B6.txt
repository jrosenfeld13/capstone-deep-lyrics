Tick tock
Tick

[Verse 1]
Come to me
The moon is closer than your eyes
I can barely see through the cracks
Light shines out my scars
Sirens scream in vain
I have already died a million times inside

[Chorus]
I surrender
Shoot me down
No bullet could
Stop me now
My love does not depend
On anyone or anything
It'll never die, (it'll never die)
It will never die, (it'll never die)
No, will never die, (never die, never die)

[Verse 2]
I'm ticking like a time bomb
Soon to blow away
I am not you
You are not me
It still plays
I could say I love you
If only for a day
My mind sunk this ship
I am drowned in it

[Chorus]
I surrender
Shoot me down
No bullet could
Stop me now
My love does not depend
On anyone or anything
It'll never die, (it'll never die)
It will never die, (it'll never die)
No, will never die, (will never die, will never die)

[Bridge]
Ticking like a time bomb
Ticking like a time bomb
Ticking like a time bomb
Ticking like a time bomb

[Chorus]
I surrender
Shoot me down
No bullet could
Stop me now
My love does not depend
On anyone or anything
It'll never die, (it'll never die)
It will never die, (it'll never die)
No, will never die, (never die, never die)
It will never die
It'll never die

[Outro]
(Tick tock)
(Tick tock)
(Tick tock)
(Tick tock)
