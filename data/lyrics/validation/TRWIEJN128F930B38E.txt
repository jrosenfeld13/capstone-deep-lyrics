Sitting in this asylum, thinking not allowed
Looking into walls, there's no way out

It's not the way that I wanted
To be confined here
Stuck among the spirits who tell me why go on?
Come, give me a reason to keep on walking here
Come, voice, make way for reason
I need assurance now

Arguing with myself
Not getting anywhere
To, or not to, find an answer
That is the question here

Chorus

Are you a friend or just a judgment, to tell me it's too late?
Your epileptic eyes, they are no disguise
Cause in your mind you lie
Thoughtless thinking, in my head, raging fury
Am I dead?
Can I please have one more chance?
Just one more chance...

Chorus
