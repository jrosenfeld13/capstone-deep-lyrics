It's a shame, it's a shame
It's a shame, it's a shame
That you're going
Cause I wanted to feel what it's like with your hands on my stomach
It's a shame
Let it go
Cause I want you to feel and I want you to know
It's a shame
Let it go
Cause I want you to feel and I want you to know
Can you feel it honey?
A cinderalla night
A stab at life together
We'll get the feeling right
A one way sign but a one track mind
Let it go
But I'll never let it happen
I said I'd never do it again
And again
Got a one way sign for a one track mind
Let it go
Can you feel it honey?
A Cinderella night
A stab at life together
We'll get the feeling right
But I'll never let it happen
I said I'd never do it again
And again
It's a shame
Let it go
Cause I want you to feel and I want you to know
It's a shame
Let it go
Cause I want you to feel and I want you to know
It's a shame
That you ran so hard that you hide in vain
It's a shame
It's a shame
It's a shame
I don't know
