[Intro]
Ordinary, no
Really don't think so
Not a love this true
Common destiny
We were meant to be
Me and you

[Verse 2]
Like a perfect scene
From a movie screen
We're a dream come true
Suited perfectly
For eternity
Me and you

[Chorus]
Everyday, well I need you even more
And the nighttime too
There's no way, I could ever let you go
Even if I wanted to

[Verse 3]
Everyday I live
Try my best to give
All I have to you
Thank the stars above
That we share this love
Me and you

[Chorus]
Everyday, well I need you even more
And the nighttime too
There's no way, I could ever let you go
Even if I wanted to

[Verse 4]
Ordinary, no
Really don't think so
Just a precious few
Ever make it last
Get as lucky as
Me and you

[Outro]
Me and you
