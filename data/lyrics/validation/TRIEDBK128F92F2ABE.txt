[Verse 1]
I went to see her dad for a sit down man to man
It wasn't any secret, I'd be asking for her hand
I guess that's why he left me waiting
In the living room by myself
With at least a dozen pictures of her sitting on a shelf
She was

[Chorus]
Playing Cinderella
She was riding her first bike
Bouncing on the bed and looking for a pillow fight
Runnin' through the sprinkler with a big popsicle grin
Dancin with her dad, lookin up at him
In her eyes I'm prince charming
But to him I'm just some fellow
Riding in and stealing Cinderella

[Verse 2]
I leaned in towards those pictures
To get a better look at one
When I heard a voice behind me say
"Now, ain't she somethin son?"
I said "Yeah, she's quite a woman"
And he just stared at me
And I realized that in his eyes she would always be

[Chorus]
Playing Cinderella
She was riding her first bike
Bouncing on the bed and looking for a pillow fight
Runnin' through the sprinkler with a big popsicle grin
Dancin with her dad, lookin up at him
In her eyes I'm prince charming
But to him I'm just some fellow
Riding in and stealing Cinderella

[Bridge]
Oh, he slapped me on the shoulder
Then he called her in the room
When she threw her arms around him
That's when I could see it too

[Chorus]
She was playing Cinderella
She was riding her first bike
Bouncing on the bed looking for a pillow fight
Runnin' through the sprinkler with a big popsicle grin
Dancin with her dad, lookin up at him
If he gives me a hard time
I can't blame the fellow
I'm the one who's stealing -- cinderella
