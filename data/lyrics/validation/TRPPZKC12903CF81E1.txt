Maybe we're not the only ones
Let's just say we're the admitted
Let's make believe that we are capable of parallel galaxies
How and why
There's unrest in the mind with my limbs untied
How and why
There's unrest in the mind with my limbs untied

(Beautiful girls with no ambition)
(Piling hair at the fucking salon)
(Happily managing all of their friends)
(You can't live life through your cellular phone)

I told you I don't need you
Baby, I need you
I don't need you (Kurt, cut your loose ends)
Baby, I need you
I don't need you (Man, cut your loose ends)
Baby, I need you
I told you I don't need you (Don't follow the trends)
I can't decide, I can't decide

No, it's okay, you don't need them anyway
And if I go, you can stay, everything will be the same
(It was the first time, but it won't be the last)
No, it's okay, you don't need them anyway
And if I go, you can stay, everything will be the same

I can make you laugh, but I know it won't last
When the air is thin I know you'll be over this again
I know you'll be over me someday

Maybe we're not the only ones
Let's just say we're the admitted
Let's make believe that we are capable of parallel galaxies
How and why
There's unrest in the mind with my limbs untied
How and why
There's unrest in the mind with my limbs untied
