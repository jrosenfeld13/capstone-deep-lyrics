[Verse 1: Jerry Cantrell]
Know me - broken by my master
Teach thee a child, of love hereafter

[Chorus: Layne Staley]
Into the flood again
Same old trip it was back then
So I made a big mistake
Try to see it once my way

[Verse 2: Jerry Cantrell]
Drifting body, its sole desertion
Flying, not yet quite the notion

[Chorus: Layne Staley]
Into the flood again
Same old trip it was back then
So I made a big mistake
Try to see it once my way

[Guitar Solo: Jerry Cantrell]

[Chorus: Layne Staley]
Into the flood again
Same old trip it was back then
So I made a big mistake
Try to see it once my way

[Outro: Layne Staley]
Am I wrong?
Have I run too far to get home?
Have I gone?
Left you here alone
Am I wrong?
Have I run too far to get home? Yeah
Have I gone?
Left you here alone

If I would, could you?
