Another night comes down
And it ain't so hard
To see which one of us holds the highest card
I get the wordless mouth
It comes to lock me out
No confrontation
Just the stepping out of light
Another night comes down with another set of thoughts
And we're so quiet
In fear of kicking up a storm
Whatever made us glow
It's any place but here
Let's go outside and fill our lungs with air

I turn off my heart and let the feelings all be gone
From one day to the next I stop believing
And it goes on and on

So much unspoken
And it seems so hard to take it all in
Just leave it in the past
All else continuing as peaceful as before
With sounds and rhythms as sorrowful as yours
