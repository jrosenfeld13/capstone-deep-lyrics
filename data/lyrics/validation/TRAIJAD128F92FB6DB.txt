You're driving us down to the sunset
Where the wind blows warm on the sand
Where the old trees smile to the Ocean
It feels like your smile is feeding the day
It's like the flowers are dancing on your way

And you say (x4)

You've been driving, driving all night
I've never found any rest in a car before
I had beautiful dreams for so long
And when I wake up, you say

You beat my heart
You know my eyes
I guess it's love
That I'm feeling
