What a nice surprise
Well have I spoilt your appetite
And I told you once
I told you once
So let me tell you twice
I wanted to say
A toast to emotion
Raise your glasses high
And turn them this way
A balance of hormones
That make you feel like no one else
Make you just the sane

Here's to love, here's to hate
Here's to all the things that makes me realise
This is a four letter word
Here's to fear, here's to fate
Here's to all the things that makes me realise
This is a four letter word oh oh

It's coming loud and clear
God I fancy you my dear
Well I might be wrong
I might be wrong
I might need glasses all along
My deepest emotions
Nothing more than chemical equations
Symphonies of stimulants
Swimming round in a beating gland
Really caused a traffic jam

Here's to love, here's to hate
Here's to everything that makes me realise
This is a four letter word
Here's to fear, here's to fate
Here's to all the things that makes me realise
This is a four letter word
Here's to love, here's to hate
Here's to everything that makes me realise
This is a four letter word
