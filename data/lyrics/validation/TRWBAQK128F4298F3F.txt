Put paid to what you say
Put your money where your mouth is
Come and join us on holiday
I won't lose you round the mountain

I didn't like you very much when I met you
I didn't like you very much when I met you
I didn't like you very much when I met you
I didn't like you very much when I met you
And now I like you even less
I don't know what to do
For the best

You spend your money so frivolously
Why don't you save it for the children?
You spend your money but it's not on me
Or a man of lesser income

I didn't like you very much when I met you
I didn't like you very much when I met you
I didn't like you very much when I met you
I didn't like you very much when I met you
And now I like you even less
I don't know what to do
For the best

Far Out!
