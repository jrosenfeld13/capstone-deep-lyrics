I saw you last night
Alone in your car
It wasn't quite right
Your headlights were out

I woke up today
I had to find out
If all was okay
But your phone line was out

If you don't come quickly
If you don't come to
I'll be gone

I walked to the square
I called out your name
They said you were dead
And we were to blame

If you don't come quickly
If you don't come to
I'll be gone

I saw you today
Alone in your room
It wasn't okay
Your headlights were out
