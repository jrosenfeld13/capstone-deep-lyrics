I don't get around much like I used to
I don't cry, not unless I want to
Might be somethin' in the air
Might be that I just don't care
Might be cuz I lost my baby
Or it might be my mind, yeah

Well, you might think that I'm talkin' crazy
Might even believe its true
Cuz right now my life's a little hazy
Can't even put on my shoes
Might be cuz the worlds gone crazy, darlin'
Or it might be my mind

Search your soul and you will find
That your heart won't tell a lie

I can't lie even if I want to
My momma didn't raise no fool
Hey, I seen what you go believin'
And I know about the Golden Rule
Might be cuz I'm a dreamer, baby
Or it might be my mind

Search your soul and you will find
That your heart won't tell a lie

Search your soul and you will find
That your heart won't tell a lie
