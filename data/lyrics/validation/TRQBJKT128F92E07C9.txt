Well I broke my nail on your coffin lid
Trying to get to the beauty within
Oh yeah, you're gonna be mine

Digging a grave while wearing a skirt
Asking for trouble, gonna get myself hurt
But its fine, you're gonna be mine

Let me wipe those maggots from your eyes
You make me feel like warm and fuzzy inside
Now my wigs all frizzy
And I've got a run in my hose
Rigor mortis has been kind to you
And left you in a sexy pose

Happily, I'm so happily ever cadaver
You're gonna be mine

This transvestite moves by moonlight
With six inch heels and a pink flashlight
Oh yeah, you're gonna be mine

I put you in the back of my Cadillac
Next to my lingerie and tire jack
Oh yeah, you're gonna be mine

Let me wipe those maggots from your eyes
You make me feel like warm and fuzzy inside
Now my wigs all frizzy
And I've got a run in my hose
Rigor mortis has been kind to you
And left you in a sexy pose

Happily, I'm so happily ever cadaver
You're gonna be mine

All right, dig 'em up
Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi
Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi
Alright

Let me wipe those maggots from your eyes
You make me feel like warm and fuzzy inside
Now my wigs all frizzy
And I've got a run in my hose
Rigor mortis has been kind to you
And left you in a sexy pose

Happily, I'm so happily ever cadaver
You're gonna be mine
