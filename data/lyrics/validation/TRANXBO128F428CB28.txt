I need to taste your breath
Every day I need the love you bring
I just want to live my life
With you forever by my side
Never again to feel the pain of life
Your smoke takes me away
Always to love the taste of your breath
Never to be apart, I'll always need you

I need to taste your breath
Every day I need the love you bring
I just want to live my life
With you forever by my side
Never again to feel the pain of life
Your smoke takes me away
Always to love the taste of your breath
Never to be apart, I'll always need you

Yes, I love
I love you
