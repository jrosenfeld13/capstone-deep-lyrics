[Verse 1: Fagen]
I got a girl and Ruby is her name
(Ruby Ruby Ruby baby)
She don't love me, but I love her just the same
(Ruby Ruby Ruby baby)
Ruby Ruby how I want you
Like a ghost I'm gonna haunt you
Ruby Ruby when will you be mine

[Verse 2: Fagen]
Each time I see you baby my heart cries
(Ruby Ruby Ruby baby)
I'm gonna steal you away from all those guys
(Ruby Ruby Ruby baby)
From the sunny day I met you
Made a bet that I would get you
Ruby Ruby when will you be mine

[Solos]

[Verse 3: Fagen]
I got a girl and Ruby is her name
(Ruby Ruby Ruby baby)
I'd give the world just to set her heart aflame
(Ruby Ruby Ruby baby)
Got some lovin' money too
Gonna give it all to you
Ruby Ruby when will you be mine
