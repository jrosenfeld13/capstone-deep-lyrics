Are you here just to pass the time of day
Or is it love, that brings you back way
Did you miss me in the time we've been apart
Are you looking for a way back to my heart

Are you on the road to loving me again
Is the trail at Yellow Creek come to an end
Do you realise your future lies
Right here where it began
Are you on the road to loving me again

I don't need any promises and such
Only you and the way we used to touch
Could I really see or could my heart be blind
Is it really me you're coming home to find

Are you on the road to loving me again
Is the trail at Yellow Creek come to an end
Do you realise your future lies
Right here where it began
Are you on the road to loving me again
