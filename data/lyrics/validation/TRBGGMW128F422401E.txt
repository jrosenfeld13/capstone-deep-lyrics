Oh, oh
Every hour, every day
Every minute you are away
Every second I'm alone
And I miss you that's my heart
You will find by myself
Do you hear seasons to relax?
Relations on my heart
Every hour, every day
Every minute you are away
Every second I'm alone
And I miss you, that's my heart
You will find by myself
Do you hear seasons to relax?
Relations on my heart
Oh, oh
Every hour, every day
Every minute you are away
Every second I'm alone
And I miss you that's my heart
You will find myself
Do you hear seasons to relax?
Relations on my heart
