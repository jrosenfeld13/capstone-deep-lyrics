Follow me thru my tale of this one boy and this one girl
And Ill show you simple mistakes and how they lead to this boys heartache
Now this heartaches like a landslide falling faster every time I take a listen to what you say
Is it safe now; I just cannot stay

And now there is no doubt, Im all inside out
Now there is no doubt, Im all inside out and I know

Theres no time left for second chances
Im left here on my own, defying fear; will I be better off without you here?

So lets talk about stories of our past-time glory
Lets take on the world and give it back, just you and me girl
This could last all day and never ever fade away so lets give it one last try and let the clock run down before we say goodbye
Before we say goodbye

You took time and kept your future bright, but Ill always know that you and I stay in this together
You and I stay in this together cause I know
