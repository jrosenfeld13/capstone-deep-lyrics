Since I've become unworthy
A fixture of contempt
You save your tainted clemence
My tears, my tears will go unwept
Isolated
A lost illusion of time
To purify
I've been replaced
Castigation
A lost illusion of time
Fading away
I can't feign my atonement
Can't make another me
The truth won't help console it
There is no sanctity
Isolated
A lost illusion of time
To purify
I've been replaced
Castigation
A lost illusion of time
Fading away
Solo Jellum
Release me from confusion
Alleviate my pain
A life unconsecrated
The endless, the endless stain
Isolated
A lost illusion of time
To purify
I've been replaced
Castigation
A lost illusion of time
Fading away
Solo Kettner
