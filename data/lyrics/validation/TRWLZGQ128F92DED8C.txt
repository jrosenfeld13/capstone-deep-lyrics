I'm through with your wicked games
Don't let memories curl me up again
What happened to the old you?

You took out the fire escape
Dressed up in a superhero cape
How come you didn't take me with you?

Please stay by my side
I know you need some time

And people will wonder why we're together
And people will wonder why we still came together

And the movie is still the same
Except for one missing frame
I believe it when I awake with you

It's hard to keep the pace
I painted your colors all over my face
Do you think I am queasy too?

I wanna stay by your side
You will love me sometimes

And people will wonder why we're together
And people will wonder why we still came together
And people will wonder why we're still together
And people will wonder why we stay together
