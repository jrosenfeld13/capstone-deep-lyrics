Blessed are your eyes that have seen
And your ears that have heard these wonderful words
(Wolde wolde wolde wolde)
Yea, dem a fight against Rastaman philosophy
Dem heart well set and fixed
Yes their mind all dressed in dem pride and vanity
Dem say we born in sin and shame and iniquity
By the works of the almighty
So don't let them fill up your vocabulary
With a whole lot of things and them no necessary
Yes, give us the teachings of His Majesty
One and all got to face this reality
Say we all got to face this reality
And when you coming say fe coming with your posse
Take a taste of this living water and you will never thirsty '
Dem say Say that the half have never been told
Say you fe come a with your heart and soul
Don't be hypnotized
Only the fittest of the fittest must survive
Survive Got to stay alive
We got to survive
Survive. Survive

Say when you coming say fe come with your posse
Take a taste of this living water and you will never thirsty
Dem say,-say that the half have never been told
Say you fe come a with your heart and soul
Don't be hypnotized
Only the fittest of the fittest must survive

Got to stay alive,-We got to survive
Trodding through the valley of the shadows of the wicked
We fear no evil
Tell them,-a tell them we fear no foe
Say we don't care about them sound and pressure
In this tradition there ain't no measure
We got to survive
I and I and I...
