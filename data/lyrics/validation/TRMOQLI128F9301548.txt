Crawling on all fours
On a sidewalk
I an unknown town
Try to get up
But you can't
Weakness holds you down
Pretend to be looking for something
Lost in the ground
Cause people stare at you

This is a nightmare
This is a nightmare

Uniformed Children
Dancing around you
Stab on your hands
Cute little creatures
With the features
Of your best friends
They try to stem you
With marbles and chewing gum balls

You're to weak to get out of there

This is a nightmare
This is a nightmare

Climbing the stairs
Of a house
That is rocked by a storm
Higher, higher
You're tired
You crawl
Like a weakend worm
There's a raw on your ears
The voices appear
You are jolted around
Still creeping to nowhere

This is a nightmare

Drag yourself
Through deserted streets
Under a dusty Sun
Trying empty burrows, flats, stores
One by one
Youre brothers, your friends
All the others, where have they gone?
Is anybody there?

This is a nightmare
This is a nightmare
