Get to his chest, compress, his heart stopped beating
A breath, resuscitate some feeling
The ambulance will take over from here
Looking down on you in preparation
With mask and tools, this operation
Is your last chance to live so close your eyes
As I'm putting you under

I can save your heart even though it's destined to fail
But don't be afraid
You just might make it out alive this way
As I review your chart, you dispute your need for repair
But I guarantee
You'll never make it out alive without me

To see what hides inside, I cut you open
A mass of pride, bruised and swollen
And it must be removed so you can heal
Now the choice is yours, accept the treatment
Say the word and I'll proceed
Now there's nothing left to do but close your eyes
As I'm putting you under

(Patient:)
"There's a pain in my chest and I'm told by the best
They can't save me
What make You think You can?"
(Doctor:)
"The drugs they prescribe and procedures they try
Will not save you
But I swear to you I can"

Let me play my part
I'll keep you breathing I swear
But I guarantee you'll never make it out alive without me
