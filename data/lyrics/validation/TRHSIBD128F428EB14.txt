One, two, three, yeah!

I'm in love with everything i see
Today
Well, it's bright and new

Some waves have borrowed all of my pain
For the next few hours
I can sway
I can sway
Oh, where i lay
I can sway

The water's rising
Life is ending
Oh, i've lived on top of my own words

Simplified
I'm not shaking
Speed is the only factor

A kitten on a patio
A kitten on a patio is looking for me
A kitten on a patio
That kitten on the patio can't get to me
Where i lay

Where i lay
I can sway
Where i lay
I can sway

The water's rising
Life is ending
Oh, i've lived on top of my own words...

Have it all
We'll have it all
We
We can...one, two, three, yeah!
