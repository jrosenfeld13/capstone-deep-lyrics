Whirlpools of wonder
Try to wash away a memory
Unfathomable leaks of thought
Lost in the deep blue me
Below the calm surface
Pain flows to and fro

Sunken love
Chasing drowned sorrow
Harbor a horror
'Til tomorrow

Plunged into dark dark depths
Anchor where secrets are kept
Dark feelings, mystery voyages

Try to avoid those forgotten ages

Sunken love
Chasing drowned sorrow
Harbor a horror
'Til tomorrow

Don't worry, don't fear
Drowned loves will reappear
Reserve a scene within that vessel
Destiny

So don't mourn
'Cause everything is reborn
