They say everything can be replaced
They say every distance in not near
Yet I remember every face
Of every man who put me here

I see my life come shining from the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now I shall be released

They say every man needs protection
They say that every man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Somewhere so high above this wall

I see my life come shining from the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now I shall be released

They say there'll be a new enquiry
They say there's been a slight mistake
But while they write reports,we've heard it all before
Let's get him out before it's all too late

Now yonder there's a man in this lonely crowd
A man who swears he's not to blame
Ten long years he's been there shouting so loud
Just crying out that he was framed

I see my life come shining from the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now I shall be released
