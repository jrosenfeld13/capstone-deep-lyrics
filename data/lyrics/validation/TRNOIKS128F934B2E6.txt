Icy stares from upper echelon
So confused, i just don't belong
Out of place, the spotlight glares on me
When you don't fit in, nothing comes naturally

Aah, they're watching as i fall
Ahh, i'm not invisible - not like the rest

I'm an outcast, free at last
So long, don't need you anyway
Outcast, i am who i am, here to stay

Solitaire, alone i stand
It's all so clear, impressions falsely take command
Distorted views, you see what you wanna see
I'm not like you, there's more than meets the eye in me

Aah, they're watching as i fall
Ahh, i'm not invisible - not like the rest

I'm an outcast, free at last
So long, don't need you anyway
Changes, i am who i am, here to stay

I'm an outcast, i can see at last
Goodbye, i won't be caught in your trap
So long, i'm never coming back

I'm an outcast, under siege attack
Stand out, you didn't bargain for me
Wasted, i'm not what you want me to be

I'm an outcast, free at last
So long, don't need you anyway
Changes, i am who i am, here to stay
