We are the remnant, the boulder stands
The disconnected, the after plan
An alien from another place
Breathing your air, and taking up space

No longer empty out your words

Many days we come away
Are we get-get-getting it down?
Many days do we come away
Are we getting it getting it down?

We are the remnant, the boulder stands
Beneath the ocean, the earth and sand
They own the circle, they earned it well
They erect the statues, convince themselves

No longer empty out your words
(No longer will keep breathing)
No longer empty out your words
(What say you I'll become the remnant)

Many days we come away
Are we get-get-getting it down?
Many days do we come away
Are we getting it getting it down?

Don't breed anymore
