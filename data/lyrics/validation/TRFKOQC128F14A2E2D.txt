I can't do it any quicker
I don't want it any slicker
As far as the eye can see
Is miles and miles of icy sea

So try your best
And think about it later
Or you will never know

I don't feel fear anymore
But I can't risk getting mauled
As far as the ear can hear
The wave is coming loud and clear

So try your best
And think about it later
Or you will never know
So try your best
And think about it later
Or you will never know
Which way your life could go
And you'll know when you know

So try your best
And think about it later
Or you will never know
Which way your life could go
And you'll know when you know
