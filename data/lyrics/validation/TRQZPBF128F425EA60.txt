I wish I could fall in love again and feel the way I always used to do
I wish I could fall in love again then maybe I'd fall out of love with you
I know it's all over between us and you're happy with someone new
And I wish I could fall in love again then maybe I'd fall out of love with you
Oh I know it's all over...
