You are the Holy One
You are Gods only Son

We are complete in You
When we submit to truth
Your judgement s they are sure

We desire, O majesty
That we might live by Your decree
Establish righteousness in us
That we might live victorious in You
(Repeat)

We desire, O majesty
That we might live by Your decree
Establish righteousness in us
That we might live victorious in You
