When I'm looking for the perfect things
Some fantasies they save me with their grace
All around you little things are shining like
They are one

When I'm looking for the perfect things
Just stand up and put on another face
So you're exploring all you see you should live
Everything

Perspiring deeply
Watching this fears
As big as planets
And I'm hot and I'm hot
Perspiring deeply
Watching this fears
As big as planets
And I'm hot and I'm hot
Perspiring deeply
Watching this fears
As big as planets
And I'm hot and I'm hot
Perspiring deeply
Watching this fears
As big as planets
And I'm hot and I'm hot

I'm waking up in a good day
So happy walking into the sun
So you are living all you are in your eyes
Is there an end

Just gimme some time sister
Just gimme some trust sister
I really want you to see me the way I am
The way I am, the way

Perspiring deeply
Watching this fears
As big as planets
And I'm hot and I'm hot
Perspiring deeply
Watching this fears
As big as planets
And I'm hot and I'm hot
Perspiring deeply
Watching this fears
As big as planets
And I'm hot and I'm hot
Perspiring deeply
Watching this fears
As big as planets
And I'm hot and I'm hot
