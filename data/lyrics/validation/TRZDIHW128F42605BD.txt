A bully enjoying his vacation
Oblivious to all our confrontations
Speaking fondly of his junior years
When i was fighting tears
A bully enjoying his vacation

I can taste the anger and the hate
I have come to set the record straight
Twenty years seems long enough to wait
A bully enjoying his vacation

Cruising with my nemesis on high seas
Five drinks, he doesn't recognize me
Full of anticipation
I don't notice his depression
Cruising with my nemesis on high seas

My act of concern is just to tease
I'm about to send him to his knees
So close to force him begging please
He mentions terminal disease
A bully enjoying his vacation

And how he feels someone is dangling
His vile existence on a string
And now the sea he's conquering
Knows he can conquer anything
A bully enjoying his vacation

Aware of his terminal condition
Frustrated by my indecision
Knowing i'd regret this very day
I hit him anyway
Aware of his terminal condition

Once again, he got the best of me
I left him conquering the sea
A bully enjoying his vacation
