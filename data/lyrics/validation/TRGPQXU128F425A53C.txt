The city streets are wet again with rain
But I'm walking just the same
Skies turn to the usual gray
When you turn to face the day

Oh... and love don't show up in the pavement cracks
All my water colors fade to black
I'm going nowhere and I'm ten steps back
All my dreams are fallen flat

Love don't show in the pavement cracks, oh...
There will be no turning back, oh...

Time and space will pass us by and by
When we don't see eye to eye
I... would have done anything
For happiness to bring, oh...

But it don't show up in the pavement cracks
I can't even cover up my tracks
I'm going nowhere and I'm light years back
Ooh I wish you well

How come every day
I'm still waiting for the change?
How come I still say
Give me strength to live...

Love don't show in the pavement cracks, oh...
There will be no turning back, oh...

Where is my comfort zone?
A simple place to call my own
'Cause everything I wanna be
Comes crashing down on me, oh...

And it don't show up in the pavement cracks (it don't show up in the pavement cracks)
I can't even recognize my tracks (I can't even recognize my tracks)
You and I can't turn the whole thing back
Ooh I wish you well

Love don't show in the pavement cracks, oh...
There will be no turning back, oh...
