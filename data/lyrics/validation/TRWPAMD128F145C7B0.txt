Shut ur eyes my darlin
Theres nothing u can say
The man on the moon won't follow u
He doesnt live there anyway
U dont have to be a soldier
To fight in your private war
Let the blood u might see rain down on me
U don have to fight no more

Theres nothing u can say
Theres nothing u can send
Theres nothing that can change the facts
Not all the kings men

Ride upon your stalion
And ill ride upon your mare
Well ride so far, ride so hard
Far away from here
And when we look back upon it
It all will become so clear
And the gates will open up for us
And we won't have no more fear
Theres nothing u can say
Theres nothing u can send
Theres nothing that can change the facts
Not all the kings men

Look away, look away
U might seen time and trouble but not today
And when they come down upon u
I won't let them get anything on u
And ill be there for u
And all when they want some time
Look away, look away
U might seen time and trouble but not today
And when they come down upon u
I won't let them get anything on u
And well dream away
All your fears and troubles but, look away

We both were motherless children
They sent us separate ways
And the family u see beat down on u
And mine it was OK
Ive come to take u back now
To save u from this fate
They won't have anymore chances
To treat u this way
Theres nothing u can say
Theres nothing u can send
Theres nothing that can change all that
Not all the kings men

Look away, look away
U might seen time and trouble but not today
And when they come down upon u
I won't let them get anything on u
And well dance away
All your fears and troubles but look away
Look away
