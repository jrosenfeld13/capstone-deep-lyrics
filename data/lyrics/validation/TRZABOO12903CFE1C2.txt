There's never been a Texan who's ever been outdone
He'll outbig the biggest for spite or for fun
He's got bigger tractors and bigger trucks
Bigger and of course bigger bucks

But pride is the biggest thing in Texas
It's the only thing bigger than the land that we love
And we got big down to the letter, we ain't saying we're no better
It just seems like out in Texas there's more to be proud of

Broke or broken won't show in his eyes
He'll never back down and he'll never say die
See he's naturally a Texan the day he is born

But pride is the biggest thing in Texas
It's the only thing bigger than the land that we love
And we got big down to the letter, we ain't saying we're no better
It just seems like out in Texas there's more to be proud of

If you can't love it or fight it
Rope it or ride it, shoot it or sip it
What the hell good is it

There's never been a Texan who's ever been outdone
He'll outbig the biggest for spite or for fun
He's got bigger tractors and bigger trucks
Bigger and of course bigger bucks

But pride is the biggest thing in Texas
It's the only thing bigger than the land that we love
And we got big down to the letter, we ain't saying we're no better
It just seems like out in Texas there's more to be proud of

Broke or broken won't show in his eyes
He'll never back down and he'll never say die
See he's naturally a Texan the day he is born

Pride is the biggest thing in Texas
It's the only thing bigger than the land that we love
And we got big down to the letter, we ain't saying we're no better
It just seems like out in Texas there's more to be proud of

Yes, it just seems like out in Texas there's more to be proud of
