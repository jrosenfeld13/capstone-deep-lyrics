[Verse 1]
Now youre here beside me, baby
Youre a living dream
And every time you get this close
It makes me want to scream
You touched me and you knew
That I was warm for you and then
I am never going to be the same again

[Verse 2]
Sorry if I hurt you, baby
Sorry if I did
Sorry if I touched the place
Where your secrets are hid
But you meant more than everything
And I could not pretend
I am never going to be the same again

[Verse 3]
You give me something to think about, baby
Every time I see you
Dont worry, baby, I dont mind leaving
Id just like it to be my idea

[Verse 4]
You taught me how to love you, baby
You taught me, oh, so well
Now, I cant go back to what was, baby
I cant unring the bell
You took my reality
And cast it to the wind
And I am not going to be the same again
