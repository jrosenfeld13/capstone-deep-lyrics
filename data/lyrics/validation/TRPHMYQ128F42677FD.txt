[Verse 1]
She nursed him there, ooh, over a night
I wasn't so sure she wanted him to stay
What to say? What to say?
But soon she was down. Soon he was low
At a quarter past. A holy no
She had to turn around

[Chorus]
When she couldn't hold, oh, she folded. A dissident is here
Escape is never the safest path
Oh, a dissidence. A dissident is here

[Verse 2]
And to this day she's glided on
Always home but so far away
Like a word misplaced. Nothing said, what a waste
But when she had contact with the conflict
There was meaning but she sold him to the state
She had to turn around

[Chorus]
When she couldn't hold she folded. A dissident is here
Escape is never the safest path
Oh, a dissidence. A dissident is here. Oh Oh Oh

[Verse 3]
She gave him away when she couldn't hold. No, she folded
A dissident is here
Escape is never the safest path
Oh, a dissident, a dissident is here
Oh, couldn't hold on. She couldn't hold. No, she folded. A dissident is here
Escape is never the safest place. Oh, A dissident is here
