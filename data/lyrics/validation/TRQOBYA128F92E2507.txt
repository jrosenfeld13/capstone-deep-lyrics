Now you're walking that well-healed ground Upon a fragile course
The Gin Lane talk has been getting you down
Cos the hero Blake could not be found
And there's a lot of faking going down

The smoke that clouded your eyes
Was a daily event
And those weren't ghosts they were only men
Just the beauty that you sensed
Could heal all indifference

Beneath the cruel lives and the hard face
I can't believe what I have found
I touched the spirit of this ordinary town
And in the summer heat Under the crowded sheets
They were feathering the beds
I felt the spirit Of this place we'd left for dead

The Darkened streets for a guide
We Search vainly for your sight
The Tension rising on every side
You find comfort in its might
But that sun burns more than she lights

Beneath the cruel lives and the hard face
I can't believe what I have found
I touched the spirit of this ordinary town
And in the summer heat Under the crowded sheets
They were feathering the beds
I felt the spirit Of this place we'd left for dead

Further down in this town
You hear the common word of mouth
That back-street talk just a hollow sound
Cos the hero Blake could not be found
And there's a lot of faking going down

Beneath the cruel lives and the hard face
I can't believe what I have found
I touched the spirit of this ordinary town
And in the summer heat Under the crowded sheets
They were feathering the beds
I felt the spirit Of this place we'd left for dead
