A message from the realm of darkness
Caught inside a vivid dream
Underneath a hidden meaning
There's a mystic prophecy

And you will shine - (shine on dreamer)
And then you'll find - (dream on dreamer)
The Revelation
Shine - (shine on dreamer)
From the other side - (dream on dreamer)
The Revelation

With your rapid eyes of movement
You find symbolic imagery
A piercing light against the shadows
Leads to synchronicity

And you will shine - (shine on dreamer)
And then you'll find - (dream on dreamer)
The Revelation
Shine - (shine on dreamer)
From the other side - (dream on dreamer)
The Revelation

There's haunting fascination, deep inside telepathy
Extra sensory perception, showing you the mystery

And you will shine - (shine on dreamer)
And then you'll find - (dream on dreamer)
The Revelation
Shine - (shine on dreamer)
From the other side - (dream on dreamer)
The Revelation
Shine - (shine on dreamer)
To another dimension - (dream on dreamer)
The Revelation
Shine - (shine on dreamer)
From the other side - (dream on dreamer) - The Revelation
