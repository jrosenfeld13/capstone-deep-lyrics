The beast is rising
21st century killing machine
A terror from below
Unchained, awake and ready to kill
Hometown apocalypse
Rise of a monster catastrophe
Tomorrow's heaven
Where all do follow the ecstasy of gold

Still marching on a mission in blood
Such power takes on the world
Still searching for souls that will never betray
Revolution - all the victims come to real life

Future annihilation
21st century killing machine
M-60 bullet raid
Purely nothing against the undead
You're the devils playground
Embraced and choked are you ready to die
To the world of the dead seen through your eyes

Still marching on a mission in blood
Such power takes on the world
Still searching for souls that will never betray
Revolution - all the victims come to real life

All hail the army - the dead alive
All hail the army - the dead alive

The mean machine is coming for you all
Say your prayers mother fuckers!
'Cause I won't

The beast is rising Lyrics
21st century killing machine
A terror from below
Unchained, awake and ready to kill
Hometown apocalypse
Rise of a monster catastrophe
Tomorrow's heaven
Where all do follow the ecstasy of gold

Still marching on a mission in blood
Such power takes on the world
Still searching for souls that will never betray
Revolution - all the victims come to real life

Mission in blood!
Takes on the world!

Still marching on a mission in blood
Such power takes on the world
