I said you're the cutest thing that I've ever seen
I really love your peaches, wanna shake your tree
Lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time
Said lovey dovey, I can't get you out of my mind

I tell you that I love you and you ought to know
I love the way your father slammed the back door
Lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time
Said lovey dovey, I can't get you out of my mind

I get a high when you kiss me and I'm on the ceiling
My knees get weak, my heart beats, my head starts dreaming
I love you pretty baby, place no one above
Give it up, I can't wait because

You're the cutest thing that I ever did see
Love those peaches, got to have that tree

Lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time
Said lovey dovey, I can't get you out of my mind

I get a high when you kiss me and I'm on the ceiling
My knees get weak, my head starts dreaming
Give it up, I just can't wait

You're the cutest thing that I ever did see
I really love your peaches, got to shake that tree
Lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time
Said lovey dovey, I can't get you out of my mind

And I'm walking and I'm talking but I feel alright
Said lovey dovey, I can't get you out of my mind
Lovey dovey, I can't get you out of my mind
