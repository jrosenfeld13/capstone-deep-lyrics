Everything's a blessing in disguise
You wear yours
I'll wear mine

Everything's a blessing in disguise
Falling to rise

The vanishing me
Is aching to be
Something you need

Thin, thin as a strand
She stands at the edge
And pulls me back in
Thin as a strand
She stands at the edge
And does what she can
To pull me back in

Everything's a blessing in disguise
We've got time

Everything's a blessing in disguise
You're all I want
And maybe you
You don't make me say it
You don't make me say it

Thin, thin as a strand
She stands at the edge
And pulls me back in
Thin as a strand
She stands at the edge
And does what she can
To pull me back in
