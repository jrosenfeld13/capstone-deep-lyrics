They say they built this fort 2000 years ago
A man named James carved his name in 1983
Congratulations, James
Now youre a dick for eternity
I dont know what your words for it are
I just know what it is

And so we chop chop chop
At the tree tree tree
Today I stopped and shopped
Inside the walled city
Congratulations, gentlemen
There was something there for me
I dont know what your words for it are
I just know what it is

Wanna go back to fifth grade
But Id be twenty-three
Theres a dream where I am naked
A dream where I cant see
Congratulations, James
Ive got you inside of me
I dont know what your words for it are
I just know what it is
