Hey you fool
Aren't you cool?
With your words
And your rules

Take back all those hearts that bled
Open big black gaps they said
Go give into words of love
Where is your soul?

Hey you fools
Aren't you cool?
With your words
And your rules

Take back all those hearts that said
Too much couldn't be reread
Open up those gifts of gold
Well where is your soul?

Take back all those gifts that said
Nothing till they all were dead
Give them gifts and all your gold
Well where is your soul?
