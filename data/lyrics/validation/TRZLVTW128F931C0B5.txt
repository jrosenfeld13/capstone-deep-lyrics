My love waits by a lonely shore
Grey eyes that look out for me
Tray winds, that's your doubt destiny(?)
Call out across the sea from our island of love

Island of love, island of dreams
Bringing her love to me
Send her my love, tell her my dreams
Tell her to wait for me

One night under a summer moon
Soft eyes, that say them all
A tender touch that says: "I want you so"
Longing takes me back to the island of love

Island of love, island of dreams
Sun in the wine-dark sea
Send her my love, tell her my dreams
Bring back her love to me

Island of love, island of dreams
Ask her where she waits for me
Island of love, island of dreams
Island of fantasy
Send her my love, tell her my dreams
Bring back her love to me
