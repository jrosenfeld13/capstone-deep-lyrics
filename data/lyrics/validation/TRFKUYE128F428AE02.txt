Rather be dead
Than alive by your oppression
Rather be dead
Than alive by your design

Poisoned my fingers
Burned out my eyes
Cut up my throat
To be alive

Rather be dead
Than alive by social values
Rather be dead
Than alive by your tradition

Poisoned my fingers
Burned my eyes
Cut up my throat
To be alive

Rather be alive
Rather be alive
Rather be alive
Rather be alive

Rather be alive, rather be alive, rather be
Rather be alive, rather be alive, rather be
Rather be alive
Rather be alive

Poisoned my fingers
Burned out my eyes
Cut up my throat
