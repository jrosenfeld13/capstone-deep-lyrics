You can come round my home mister
I don't mind
Call me up on the telephone mister
I don't mind
Cause I got much more to do than to bother with you
And I ain't got no time for you violent little mind
Lord you can push, push, push I won't push you
Back
You try to get me and you might get gat
Somebody's gonna shoot you down
Sooner or later, sooner or later, somebody gonna get you
You can do what you want I don't
Care what you do
I've got people to see who don't wanna see you
So if you come round my block you better
You better watch your back because you
You trouble with me and some
Somebody gonna get you
