(Lisa Brokop/Ryan Reynolds)

Hey, hey, baby
You seem so sure a-yourself
Think you can make me love you
Just you and nobody else
Well, I might be already there
Truth is, I'm not sayin'
I wanna see if you believe that
(I'm) Well worth the chance you're takin'
I would like to see you try
I double-dog dare you to cross that line
You say deep inside you're feelin' like
You could love me for the rest of my life:
I would like to see you try

No, I don't need a Prince Charmin'
Or a joker with a silver tongue
Guess a knight in shinin' armour
Is what every little girl dreams of. (Dreams of.)
Yeah, I see you talkin':
I heard every little thing you said
You wanna hold me, then show me
On your mark, get ready, get set:

I would like to see you try
I double-dog dare you to cross that line
You say deep inside you're feelin' like
You could love me for the rest of my life:
I would like to see you try

It ain't worth doin'
If we don't take it all the way
When it comes to forever
Nothin' ventured, nothin' gained

I would like to see you try
I double-dog dare you to cross that line
You say deep inside you're feelin' like
You could love me for the rest of my life:
I would like to see you try

(Deep inside, you feel like you could love me.)
Will you love me, baby?

(Deep inside, you feel like you could love me.)
(Do you love me,) baby?

(Deep inside, you feel like you could love me.)
Do you love me, baby, yeah?

(Deep inside, you feel like you could love me.)
(Do you love me,) baby?

(Deep inside, you feel like you could love me.)
Yeah, I'd like to see you try

(Deep inside, you feel like you could love me.)
(Do you love me,) baby?

(Deep inside, you feel like you could love me.)
Do you love me, baby?

(Deep inside, you feel like you could love me.)
(Do you love me,) baby?

(Deep inside, you feel like you could love me.)
