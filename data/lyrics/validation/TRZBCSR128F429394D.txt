When i wanted you, you faked it
What does it take to really make it with you. anyway
Now you're so far away

I'm on the porch
The night's a throne
I'm sitting on it, all alone

And it wasn't that hard to tell
I can't hide that kind of thing very well
And you always say you know what i'm thinking, anyway

I'm on the porch
The night's a throne
I'm sitting on it, all alone

And the oak tree
And the river
And the train
And the wind makes them sound just the same
And the train takes my crown into the night
And the moon takes my scepter for its light

But i'm not much for distances
But i know what the difference is
Between my heart and my brain
And my heart wins just the same

I'm on the porch
The night's a throne
I'm sitting on it, all alone

And i'm not much for distances
But i know what the difference is
Between my heart and my brain
And my heart wins just the same

I'm on the porch
The night's a throne
I'm sitting on it, all alone

Yeah, yeah, yeah
