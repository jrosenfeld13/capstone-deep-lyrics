Take a look, what do you see
Image in the mirror
Yesterday is yesterday
You'll meet your marker
I know that time grows old
Can't stop the seasons
Shifting sands slip through your hands
Time is gone before it's begun...

[Chorus]
Die
A little more
A little more for every day
Lord why
Oh tell me why
Do the seasons slowly grey?

Days of blue just turn to grey
The picture slowly aging
Nothing left to the memory
Death will not forsake them
God fearing people say
They are not afraid of dying
So why do they turn to faith
When faith has no meaning in life?
Time worn, worn time
Say goodbye to yesterday
After life, life after
It's all the same
The golden years bring out the pain
Death rolls in like the seasons change
You've lost all hope but still you pray
Aging eyes that fail to see
The mirror has been shattered
Death's knocking on their door
A vision filled with laughter
I know that time grows old
Can't stop the seasons
And as the end draws near
The story's over before it's begun...

[Chorus]
Die
A little more
A little more for every day
Lord why
Oh tell me why
Do the seasons slowly grey?
