Well I wish that I could land
Well it is what they demand
Well i'll need a gun or a hand
Well I wish that I could land

The take off is sometimes hard
I dream of a bodyguard...a bodyguard
My friends all died in a plane crash
Well there is a god but he wants cash

I had a bear, gone to Hawa
And Kevin Costner has retired
The take off is sometimes hard

I dream of a bodyguard

The take off is sometimes hard
I dream of a bodyguard...a bodyguard
...a bodyguard
