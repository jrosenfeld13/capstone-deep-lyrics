Well, I've been around
For all these years
And all your troubles
They all turn into fears

I wanna thank you
I wanna shake you
I wanna break through

I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm on my way

And all these people
They're all coming to you
I always thought that
I knew it was true

Oh, here she comes now
All dressed in red
Those were the days that I hoped
We might be dead

I wanna thank you
I wanna shake you
I wanna break through

I'm on my way
I'm on my way

And when they come to get you
I hope you're all right
We're gonna get free
We're gonna get out tonight

And when it's over
Well, I hope it's okay
We're gonna make up
We're gonna make it today, hey

I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm on my way

I'm on my way
What did they say?
I'm on my way
