If you take me straight to heaven
I could never fall
'Cos loving you is what I'm made for
I'd gladly give my all and all
It doesn't matter where I am
As long as I'm with you
You can take me high above
Whatever I've been dreaming of

In all the right places, it's feeling so good
In all the right places. just like it should
And I swear, I love you
And I swear, I love you

If we're dancing all alone
Or in a crowded room
When you wrap your arms around me
You can always send me to the moon
When we kiss our sugar kisses
And the music starts to play
We've got love, we've got each other
And we're going all the way

In all the right places, it's feeling so good
In all the right places. just like it should
And I swear, I love you
And I swear, I love you

Find time's never wasted, when it's ours to kill
I know in all the right places, you're touching me still
And I swear, I love you
And I swear, I love you

And I swear, I love you
And I swear, I love you
I love you
