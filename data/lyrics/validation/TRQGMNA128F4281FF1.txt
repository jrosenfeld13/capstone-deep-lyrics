Take back the heart you stole
Baby's soft, well baby, so?
And I'm full of s-s-s- ooh

It's on the way down
It's on the way down
Its on the way to you

Shot down the hearts of love
Well baby's back, well baby, so?
And I'm full of s-s-s- ooh

It's on the way down
It's on the way down
Its on the way to you

I don't have the time
To lose my mind
Every single time
Every second of every day
It's my heart
It's your way
Bring me back
No one else can

Take back the heart you stole
Well baby's hurt, well baby, so?
And I'm full of s-s-s- ooh

It's on the way down
It's on the way down
Its on the way to you
