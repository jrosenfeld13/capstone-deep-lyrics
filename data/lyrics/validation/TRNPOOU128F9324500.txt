Looking back
Alot has changed
We never thought there'd come a day
When everything we used to live for
Everything we did
And everything we said could be
Away!

Now we're left
Holding onto dreams
Two small town kids
We're gonna get them
Now it's time
I see those city lights
I think it's time, time to . . .go!

And we'll come back home
When we hit the bigtime
And we'll come back someday
And we'll come back home
When we hit the big time
Yeah we'll come back. (x2)
