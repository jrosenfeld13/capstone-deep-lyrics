Christmas time
In the business around that time
I could not lift my head enought to see
The face that I wanted to see

Through the door
Where the packages lie on the floor
Evergreen and incense in the air
There was a year i didn't care

With my voice I sang this before
That grace would come and sorrow be no more
With my ears I've heard this before
That grace would come and sorrow be no more
With my knees I bend to the floor

Christmas day
In the stillness that protects this day
The string of lights was strung into a tree
A string of lights was strung inside of me
I felt at peace and fell asleep
I felt at peace
And slept
