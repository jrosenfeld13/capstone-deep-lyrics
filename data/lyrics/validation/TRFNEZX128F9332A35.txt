This place is making me sick now, so I'm pouring whiskey down. I'll stumble off the edge of the world tonight. I sit back and take this in. Now I'm paying for your sins.

I'll grit my teeth and bare it as you barrel through my skin. This place is making me sick now, so I'm pouring whiskey down. Let's celebrate the end of my world tonight.

I love you Seattle, but I'm counting down the days 'til you break my heart again and wash my feelings down the drain. And is this necessary to feel this pain again?
