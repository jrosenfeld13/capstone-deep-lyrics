I'll take this chance and won't look back
I could never feel that way again
You crush the lights I've known so long
And all I thought was real

Confusion clouds my mind
Stop looking at me that way right now
Your god told you that it's ok
I guess you'll see what's real

So, tell me now
Why should I take this from you
How could I waste my time
Why should I take this from you
A thousand years
A thousand yesterdays
I used to care
I used to see
So, tell me now
Does it dream

Now I'm the world you've feared so much
And what you always meant to me
I'll take this time to say goodbye
This is forever

Confusion clouds your mind
Stop telling me how it is so right
Your god told you that it's ok
And now you know what's real

So, tell me now
Why should I take this from you
How could I waste my time
Why should I take this from you
A thousand years
A thousand yesterdays
I used to care
I used to see
So, tell me now
Does it dream
