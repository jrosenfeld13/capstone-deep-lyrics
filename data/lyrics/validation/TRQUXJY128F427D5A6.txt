Every little word
With every lesson learned
I think I know why hearts are made of stone
Every little pain
Fans a bitter flame
Nothing stops me loving you

Can't you see that we belong?
Oh how I want it to be
So tell me do u feel the way I feel...

Baby like the rose
Oh darling
You put color in my life
Baby take my heart forever
'Cause I don't want to be afraid
No No

Turn another page
The story will never fade
Sleep with thoughts of you until daylight
When you're far away
Forever love will stay
Keep this loving feeling deep inside

Can't you see that we belong?
Oh how I wanted to be...
Tell me do you feel the way I feel...

Baby like the rose
Oh darling
You put color in my life
Baby take my heart forever
'Cause I don't want to be afraid
No No

Baby like the rose
Oh darling
You put colour in my life
Baby take my heart forever
'Cause you're the colour in my life

Like the rose
