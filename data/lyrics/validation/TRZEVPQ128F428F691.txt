That woman
Lives in a house of stone
You better not cuss
You better not roam

She'll put you out
On your ass all alone
That woman
Lives in a house of stone

Fair lady
Give a drunkard a chance
Got a brand new suit
I got two pair of pants

Easy on the eyes
And I love to dance
I could dance right now
If you give me the chance

I'm waiting for a man
But he hasn't shown
I'm on the corner freezing
Through my bones

Give me one more week
I'll make good that loan
To that woman
Up in that house of stone

The deacons in her church
Say to leave me alone
They say my brain
Is in the twilight zone

And maybe I sin
But I ain't high tone
I'm after that girl
In that house of stone

I'm after that girl
In that house of stone
