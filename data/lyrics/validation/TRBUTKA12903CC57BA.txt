Oh no, there you go again with all your useless
Conversation
Don't cry, don't think I don't know that we
Could use a short vacation

Leap for me
Sweep for me
Fill my crater
Try me later

So long, I'll be gone before the dawn of time
Spent on my mission
Too late, have a date with patron saint of
Waiters who audition

Sleep with me
Weep with me
Fly like nice birds

How long before you feel that pain
How long before you heal that pain
How long before you see that train going
Backwards

Oh no, there you go again you've got some boy
To do your biddin
Don't lie, don't think I don't know that you've
Got secrets you keep hidden

Sweep for me
Weep for me
Cry like nice birds

How long before you heal that pain
How long before you kill that vein
How long before you see that train's going
Backwards
Going backwards
Going backwards
