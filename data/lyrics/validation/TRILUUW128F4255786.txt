I'm a black thought
Hangin' in the air
You're a white cloud
And you are everywhere

It may be winter
In our faces
It may be winter
But I'm leaving a message

There's nothing
Nothing
Nothing here

And nothing
As in something
Disappears, out of sight
But not out of heart

I don't want a surprise
If it isn't any good would you stop it if you could

There are people
People
Everywhere
And somewhere
Someone
Disappears
Out of sight
But not out of heart
