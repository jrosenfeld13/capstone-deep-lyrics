Here We Go!...
So sadistic, I'm coming apart like a ten-cent toy
Soul sadiction, I know it's something you enjoy
Trap, scream trap - These broken wings I'll wrap
Trap, scream trap, scream trap, scream trap

[Verse 2]
Reclusive and fleeing
I'm coming apart like a ten-cent toy
Soul addiction, I know it's something you enjoy
Trap, scream trap - These broken wings I'll wrap
Trap, scream trap, scream trap, scream trap

[Chorus]
Here we go... Down, down, down, down
Away we go... (repeat x4)

[Verse 2]

[Chorus] ...Sever this tie! (x4)
You don't know me - I don't know you
You don't know me - And you never will

[Chorus]...
...Sever this tie -(Tie)- (x4)
...Sever -(What do you need them for?)- (x4)
