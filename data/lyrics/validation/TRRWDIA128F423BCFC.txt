Lead me, I'll follow
Lead me, I'll follow
Here is a question that I need to know
Why turn my back and just refuse to go
When You have made for me a path so bright
Through this life
(Come on girl)
Oh Lord, I know You want to help me see
'Cause You know exactly where I need to be
There will be troubles there to block my sight
But I'll be alright when You shine Your light
Lead me, I'll follow wherever You lead me down
Lead me, I'll follow wherever You need me now
You take my circumstances into Your hands and make a way
Lord, You take me by the hand
Showing me the things You've planned
So lead me, I'll follow wherever You go
There is no question that my future's clear
'Cause I know You're answerin' my every prayer
And when You don't say what I want to hear
I won't fear, 'cause I know You will
Lead me, I'll follow wherever You lead me down
Lead me, I'll follow wherever You need me now
You take my circumstances into Your hands and make a way
Lord, You take me by the hand
Showing me the things You've planned
So lead me, I'll follow wherever You go
Lead me, I'll follow
Lead me, I'll follow
Lead me, I'll follow
Lord, You take me by the hand
Showing me the things You've planned
Lead me, I'll follow wherever You lead me down
Lead me, I'll follow wherever You need me now
Lead me, I'll follow wherever You need me now
Lord, You take me by the hand
Showing me the things You've planned
So lead me, I'll follow wherever You go, yeah yeah
Lead me, I'll follow wherever You lead me down
Lead me, I'll follow wherever
Let every sun set for me
Let every sun set for me
Lead me, I'll follow
