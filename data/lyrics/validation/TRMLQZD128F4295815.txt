Come, thou Fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing Your grace
Streams of mercy, never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise

Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
And praise the mount, I'm fixed upon it
The mount of Thy redeeming blood

And oh to grace, how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
And let Thy goodness like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to Thee

Prone to wander, Lord I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
And here's my heart Lord, take and seal it
Seal it for Thy courts above

Prone to wander, Lord I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Prone to hear You and not heed it
Prone to scorn You in Your love

Prone to wander
Prone to wander
Prone to wander
Prone to wander

Oh to grace, how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
And let Thy goodness like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to Thee

Jesus sought me while a stranger
Wandering from the heart of God
And He to rescue me from danger
Used His own precious blood

Come thou Fount
Come every blessing
Come with the love
Come with the healing

Come thou Fount
Come every blessing
Come with the love
Come with healing

Come thou Fount
Come every blessing
Come with the love
Come with healing
