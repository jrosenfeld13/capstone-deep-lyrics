Im running on a dusty road
The evil one behind me
I hear his breath and turn around
Theres no place left to hide here

Wanna break the chains of fear
Theres no way back
Your whisper in my ear
Your touch will save me again

Youll change my dream
Youll guide my way to be
You are the light
You turn black into white
Youll change my dream
Youll bring reality
You shine so bright
You turn black into white

Ive lost my soul in the game he plays
No doubt that he wont spare me
Hunting me, trapped in his chase
Subject to violation

Im afraid to fall asleep
Whether day and night
But once Im there in my dreams
Youll come to save me again

Youll change my dream
Youll guide my way to be
You are the light
You turn black into white
Youll change my dream
Youll bring reality
You shine so bright
You turn black into white

Youll change my dream
Youll steer my way to be
You are the light
You turn black into white
Youll change my dream
Youll bring reality
You are the light
First star I see tonight
