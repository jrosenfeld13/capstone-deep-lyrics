She spends her time writing other people's words
He sneaks glances at the canteen girls
She works out what the bosses want to know
He keeps waiting 'til it's time for her to go

Every day trying to attract her attention
Hopin' that she won't see through his best intentions
All day wondering where's she going to go
He could catch her eye but he'd better take it slowly

Then you get a thought, the fun begins at dark
I put my best suit on, to be the fashionable one
Do you know what they're wearing this weekend?

Evening standards, what are you doing?
Evening standards, where are you going?
Evening standards, what you going to be tonight?

Flicking through the pages of her glossy magazines
He's pinned up with high fidelity
Sweater patterns and this week's recipe
He's genned up on cubic capacity

Making up excuses to get her on the phone
Saving up the good ones for when he gets her home
All day wondering if she's on the market
All day drawing little rings around his target

Then you get a thought, and you don't have to work
You get on the floor, turn up the M.O.R
Do you know what's number one this weekend?

Evening standards, what are you doing?
Evening standards, where are you going?
Evening standards, what you going to be tonight?

Evening standards, what are you doing?
Evening standards, where are you going?
Evening standards, what you going to be tonight?

How he's believing his own lies
Towering above, he's in her eyes
He snaps his fingers, she's down at his feet
It's time for love to take the place of scandal
And the typing chaperones get hard to handle
Nine to five

Evening standards
Evening standards
Evening standards
Evening standards

Evening standards, what are you doing?
Evening standards, where are you going?
Evening standards, what you going to be tonight?

Evening standards, what are you doing?
Evening standards, where are you going?
Evening standards, what you going to be tonight?
