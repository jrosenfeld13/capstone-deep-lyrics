Honey I'm a good man
But I'm a cheatin' man
And I'll do all I can
To get a lady's love
And I wanna doo right
I don't wanna hurt nobody
If I slip well then i'm sorry
Yes I am

When I was a young boy
I use to watch my daddy play
And in my heart I'd always say
He was wrong
He had to be crazy
Knocked stoned cold out of his mind
To be leaving my pretty momma all alone
She'd always sit patient and waitin' then cussin' and cryin'
And who would have to be there to comfort her
And I would have to look my momma
Right square in her eyes
And I swear that I would never hurt no one like that

Baby i'm a good man
But I'm a cheatin' man
And I'll do all I can
To get a lady's love
And I wanna do right
And I don't wanna hurt nobody
If I slip well then I'm sorry
Yes I am

Now that i'm older
I've found it's time to settle down
Because I need some love around to make me whole
But something is funny
Cos things I swore I'd never do
I find myself falling a victim to losin' total control
Oh yea
Cos recently
I ran into
Someone that reminds me of you
And even though I know that kind of thing ain't right
I'm finding myself caught up in lies
Tryin' to swim against the tide
And as the stage gets set for drama
I can't stop thinkin' about my momma
Oooooo

I'm a cheatin' man
And I'll do all I can
To get a lady's love
And I wanna do right
And I don't wanna hurt nobody
If I slip well then i'm sorry
Yes I am

Honey i'm a good man
But I'm a cheatin' man
And I'll do all I can
To get a lady's love
And I wanna do right
I don't wanna hurt nobody
If I slip well then i'm sorry
Yes I am
Yes I am
Yes I am
