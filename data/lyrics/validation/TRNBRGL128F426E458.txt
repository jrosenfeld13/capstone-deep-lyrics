All I saw, not in me
Nothing left, I can see
What you are, What you've done
And I cannot be myself

Fill me up with your words
What you came here for
Fight me, Fight you, Fight everyone!!

For I now know exactly what I'm in for
Deny that I never was what you cared for

(I) This can't be
(Power)Same as me

Watch me break inside I am an outcast to myself
The mirror sickens me as I adjust to fit your way

What about me!!

Tell me is it gone? all you were?
Turn around introvert
In the past I see all as clear as daylight

Turn to me, justify what you think you've done
Hollow words
Fuck you, Fuck everyone!!!

For I now know exactly what I'm in for
Deny that I never was what you cared for

(I) This can't be
(Power)Same as me

Watch me break inside I am an outcast to myself
The mirror sickens me as I adjust to fit your way
What about me!!

I have to be myself!!

Hollow words
Fuck you, Fuck everyone!!

Watch me break inside I am an outcast to myself
The mirror sickens me as I adjust to fit your way

What about me!!
