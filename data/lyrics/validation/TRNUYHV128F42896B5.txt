Well, properly positioned
But still i'd lost my way
The trucks are comin' through the grass
And I know they're here to stay
Delectible? Hell yes!
Seems to fit right in
I'm a criminal, a criminal
And I'm never givin' in
Long time
Long way
Well, properly propositioned
I'm sure I'd find a way
Snakes are lyin' in the grass
And I know they're here to stay
I'm a criminal, an animal
I'm never givin' in
Long time
Long way
Now properly positioned
But still I'd lost my way
Trucks are comin' through the grass
You know what they say
I'm a criminal, an animal
I'm never givin' in
Long time
Long way
