You know, love makes the world go 'round
And love, baby, make the seesaws go up and down
And it makes the trees grow tall
And the most important thing of all
It makes a boy and girl, yeah, say they feel so fine, now (feel so fine)

Without love, the flowers wouldn't grow in spring
And without spring, yeah, the birdies just wouldn't sing
Whoa, everybody needs love and to watch the twinkling stars above
It makes a boy and girl, yeah, say they feel so fine, now (feel so fine), yeah

Whoa, everybody needs love and to watch the twinkling stars above
It makes a boy and girl, yeah, say they feel so fine, now (feel so fine)
Love, love make you cry, now
That goes for Billy, Sherry, Bobby, and Marsha, baby, you and I
Yeah, I can prove to you that these words of love I'm sayin' are so true
It makes a boy and girl, yeah, say they feel so fine, now (feel so fine)

Love, love, love, love is so sad
It's so sad
