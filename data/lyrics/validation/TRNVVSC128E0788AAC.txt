Blank page is all the rage
Never meant to say anything
In bed, I was half dead
Tired of dreaming of rest
Got dressed, drove the state line
Looking for you at the five and dime
Stop sign told me, "stay at home"
Told me you were not alone

Blank page was all the rage
Never meant to hurt anyone
In bed, I was half dead
Tired of dreaming of rest

You havent changed
Youre still the same
May you rise as you fall

You were easy, you are forgotten
You are the ways of my mistakes

I catch the rainfall
Through the leaking roof
That you had left behind
You remind me, of that leak in my soul

The rain falls, my friends call
Leaking rain on the phone

Take a day, plant some trees
May they shade you from me
May your children play beneath

Blank page was all the rage
Never meant to say anything
In bed, I was half dead
Tired of dreaming of rest
Got dressed, drove the state line
Looking for you at the five and dime
But there I was, picking pieces up
You are a ghost, of my indecision
No more, little girl
