First they told me that they loved me
Dressed me up in the light of gold
All they wanted was to know me
Gotta get me on before I get too old

Then they told me I was big time
Lots of favors of limosine
This might be what they told me it would be
But I'm not sure it's what I need

Not what I need Now, won't you tell me
Oh, my lady where's my lady
All this glory where's my lady
To share it with me
Oh, to share it with me

First they told me I could love you
And then they told me never mind never mind
Gotta keep those cards and letters
Flowing in my friend
Gotta try and have a real good
Real good time now wouldn't you tell me

Oh my lady where's my lady all this glory
Where's my lady to share it with me
Oh to share it with me
Now won't you tell me
Oh where's my lady all this glory
Where's my lady to share it with me
To share, to share it with me
Oh my lady
