I want a bit part in your life
A walk-on would be fine
I just want a bit part in your life
(A bit part in your life)

I want a bit part in your life
Rehearsing all the time
I just want a bit part in your life
(A bit part in your life)

Little more than a cameo
Nothing traumatic when I go
Litle more than a stand-in
I won't need reprimanding
