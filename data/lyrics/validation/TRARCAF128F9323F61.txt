I don't know where to go
How to find you
You could be anywhere

Something you gotta know
To remind you
I still believe

You must be out there somewhere, somewhere, somewhere
Somewhere, somewhere

[Repeat: x23]
I need you in my life

I dont know where to go
How to find you
You could be anywhere

Something you gotta know
To remind you
I still believe

You must be out there somewhere
Somewhere, somewhere
I don't know where to go
How to find you

You could be anywhere
Something you gotta know
To remind you

I still believe
You must be out there somewhere
Somewhere, somewhere

[Repeat: x30]
I need you in my life
