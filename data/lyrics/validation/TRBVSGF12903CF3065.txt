My Baby's got way, I just can't understand
My Baby's got way, I just can't understand
Leaves me in the mornin', goes with another man

I said, "Baby, baby please come back to me"
I said, "Baby, baby please come back to me"
I'll make you as happy, as my little girl can be

My baby's got something that shines like the risin' sun
My baby's got something that shines like the risin' sun
You're the sweetest thing, I have ever seen

Wake up in the mornin', my love has just begun
Wake up in the mornin', love my baby all night
Hold my baby in my arms, and love her all this night
I gotta rock my baby right, rock my baby tight
Gotta rock my baby, rock my baby
Rock my baby, rock my baby all night
