When I rise a new day
I look and I see
Just how much of my life
The wind has taken from me

When will the rain come?
When will the rain come?

One lonely flower is all thats here
No one else will shed a tear
For when it dies, well all be gone
To join the dust that drifts on by

When will the rain come?
When will the rain come?

Now that I have more time
Much more than I could need
No past
No present
No future
One mouth, one child to feed

When will the rain come?
When will the rain come?

The wind is blowing my life away
The clouds of dust drift on by
A land that once was good to me
Is gone and now its dry

When will the rain come?
When will the rain come?
When will the rain come?
