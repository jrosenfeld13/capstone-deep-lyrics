Loving is to live with the power to forgive
Loving is to live with the power to forgive

Lead me, show me, where can it be found?
Reach me, hold me, don't ever let me down

(Tell me what you've seen.)
I know the story
(Tell me what you mean.)
Maybe or surely
(Tell me what you've seen.)
The crimson fell like rain
(Should I even try?)
Whatever before me
(Living out a lie?)
I believe in glory
(Should I even try?)
Until it comes again

Forgiveness you're the key, you're no fool that died for me
I'm real sorry though, I simply could not see
Forgiveness you're the key, you're no fool that died for me
Forgiveness is forgiving endlessly

Reach me, show me, where can it be found?
Teach me, grow with me, don't ever let me down

(Tell me what you've seen.)
Every day I fail him
(Tell me what you mean.)
As I bang another nail in
(Tell me what you've seen.)
Living my life the same
(Should I even try?)
Paying the debt back
(Living out a lie?)
A long time side-tracked
(Should I even try?)
Until it comes again

Forgiveness you're the key, you're no fool that died for me
I'm real sorry though, I simply could not see
Forgiveness you're the key, you're no fool that died for me
Forgiveness is forgiving endlessly

Oh oh

Forgiveness you're the key, you're no fool that died for me
I'm real sorry though, I simply could not see
Forgiveness you're the key, you're no fool that died for me
Forgiveness is forgiving endlessly
