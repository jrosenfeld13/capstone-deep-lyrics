Oh, one more drink and then I'll go
But there's one more thing I've got to know
Does he take you places that I don't?
And what happened to the story that we wrote?
You just say you don't know, you don't know
Oh no, you don't know, you don't know, woo!
Oh, let's just get this whole thing straight
I don't wanna kidnap the truth and negotiate
Or miss the point that they met you
Just wanna hear you say something that you believe to be true
But you say you don't know, you don't know
You just say you don't know, you don't know
What it feels like, what it feels like
And so I'll go before I fall to pieces
Yes, I'll go before I fall to pieces
Now I'm just waiting for something that might never come
If it's a million to one shot, I'll make sure I'm one
Seems that nothing is safe except the truth turns to lies
Never figured it out, I found out why
So I'll go, yes I'll go
Yes I'll go, yes I'll go
Oh baby I'll go, oh yes I'll go
Yes I'll go, oh yes I'll go
Before I fall to pieces
Before I fall to pieces
Yes I'll go before I fall to pieces
Yes I'll go before I fall to pieces
