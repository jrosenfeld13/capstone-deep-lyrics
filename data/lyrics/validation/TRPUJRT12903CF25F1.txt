Crucify Your Beliefs

I must seek shelter for my sins
Leave the world behind
I must go to extremities
The death extremities
Believe in my way because I'm pure
Your ultimate is your ultimate sin
Believe in a new way to separate
Your ultimate sacrifice is your ultimate sin
I must bring myself to hell
To know what heaven is
I must go to extremities
The death extremities
Believe in my way because I'm pure
Your ultimate is your ultimate sin
Believe in a new way to separate
Your ultimate sacrifice is your ultimate sin
Crucify your beliefs and make contribution
Crucify your beliefs for the sake of redemption
Crucify your beliefs for the great contradiction
Crucify your beliefs and save your own skin
A bullet and bible is all you need
In God We Trust... On Earth We Die
This is your fate; slave on the line
Crucify your belies for the great contradiction
Crucify your beliefs and save your own skin
