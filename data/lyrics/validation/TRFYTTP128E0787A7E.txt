A church in front of a window
To a world
He don't need to see anymore
Cause he's just seen it all
In a picture show
In a theatre long ago
We're watching movies
And now we want more
But one more tragic life
I am not so sure
The elephant man lives on
Elephant men live on

The cats were big as men
And the girls would fly
Back and forth across the stage
Throwing glitter
On all those down below
So amused with second hand rage

We're watching movies
And now we want more
But one more tragic life
I am not so sure

The elephant man lives on
Elephant men live on

One is keeping another
Hidden somewhere
Keeping him company
Like a picture of dorian gray
That no one's allowed to see

The elephant man lives on
The elephant man lives on
Elephant men live on
Elephant men live on
