I saw a little beam of sunlight
Steal across a purple sky
And bent down to kiss a rose bud
Oh, it made me wanna cry

And to think that I've been permitted
To see a part of nature's plan
Oh, there's nothing that stands out more
Than the selfishness in man

Little children painting pictures
Of the blooms and apple trees
Oh, why can't the grown up people
Have faith of one thing?

And to think those tiny fingers
Might become a killer's hand
Oh, there's nothing that stands out more
Than the selfishness in man

Why can't we see the folly?
And the uselessness of pain
Love could lead to understanding
Maybe it's not too late

Then perhaps through His great wisdom
We might learn to understand
Then there'd be no shame or sorrow
And no selfishness in man

Then perhaps through His great wisdom
We might learn to understand
Then there'd be no shame or sorrow
And no selfishness in man
