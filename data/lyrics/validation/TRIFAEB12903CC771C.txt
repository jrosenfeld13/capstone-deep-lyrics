The bells are ringing for me and my gal
The birds are singing for me and my gal
Everybody's been knowing
To a wedding they're going
And for weeks they've been sewing
Every Susie and Sal
They're congregating for me and my gal
The Parson's waiting for me and my gal
And sometime
I'm goin' to build a little home for two
For three or four or more
In Love-land for me and my gal

See the relatives there
Looking over the pair!
They can tell at a glance
It's a loving romance

It's a wonderful sight
As the families unite
Gee! It makes the boy proud
As he says to the crowd:

The bells are ringing for me and my gal
The birds are singing for me and my gal
Everybody's been knowing
To a wedding they're going
And for weeks they've been sewing
Every Susie and Sal
They're congregating for me and my gal
The Parson's waiting for me and my gal
And sometime
I'm goin' to build a little home for two
For three or four or more
In Love-land for me and my gal

(repeat chorus)
