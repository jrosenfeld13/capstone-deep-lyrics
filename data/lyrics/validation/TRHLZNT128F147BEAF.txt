Oh, she never had a chance
Oh, she was only five years old
Pity the poor darling now
Oh, she never had a chance
Death come quick
For a girl
Victim of a homicide
Brutally raped
Cut and beaten
The five year old
Didn't escape
Her mom and friend
Cigarette burns
To hit her again
Did her in
On her arms
From her mom and her friend
He had a whip
Do you wanna party? It's partytime
We gotta party! It's partytime
Oh, she never had a chance
Oh, she was only five years old
Oh, she never had a chance
She was unaware
Her grand mother
Her older sister
Except Veronica
Was sent to jail
She wasn't loved
Where ever she is
It's partytime
For a dime
We gotta party/It's partytime
Do you wanna party/It's partytime
We gotta party/It's partytime
It's partytime
Do you wanna party/It's partytime
It's partytime
It's partytime
It's partytime
