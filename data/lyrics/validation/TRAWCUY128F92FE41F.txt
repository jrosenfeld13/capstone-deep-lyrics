They say that in 1842 on a plantation in Alabama
The slaves unearthed a huge skeleton
The bones of a giant whale
A leviathan
From the time when all the world was covered with water
From the Andes to the Himalayas
And even Alabama was deep down under
And the slaves looked at the huge bones and they said:

These must be the bones of a fallen angel
These must be the bones of a fallen angel

Out on the ocean, out of the water
We look for signs of him
He looks like a giant snow hill, a fountain
Then he disappears. He's a speck on the horizon

We see him only in parts
The flash of a tail, his beating heart
He's in pieces and parts

It's easier for a camel to slide through the eye of a needle
Than to find a whale who hides at the bottom of the ocean
It's easier to sail around the world in a coffee cup
Than to see a whale when he comes rising up

We see him only in parts
A fountain, fins, a speck on the horizon
Giant teeth, an open mouth
Look out, look out, look out, look out

So hit an elephant with a dart
And he just reaches around and pulls it out with his trunk
But hit a whale in the hear and the whole ocean turns red
It turns red

We see him only in parts
The flash of a tail, his beating heart
He's in pieces and parts

So get hit in your head
And there may be a few things you can't recall at all
But you get hit in your heart
And you're in pieces and parts
Pieces and parts
