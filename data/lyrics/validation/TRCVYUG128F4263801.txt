White, bright and yellow
No blue left to cry
No you in the middle of the night
No way around it
Was in the stars
All night long i'll be watching them
As I rest until tomorrow
Rest until tomorrow

Purple hush and velvet
I'll remember them
In, out, over
It's not possible
No color here X4

All my mistakes woven in a rug
Black, blue and dusty
Is there a beauty there?
Reach, reach, reach
I'll be reaching now
Cryin' out
Is there an angel here?
As I rest until tomorrow
Rest until tomorrow

Emptiness and ice woven in this rug
I'll surround the past
Was there a beauty there?
No color here
No color
And no beauty, sorry
No color here
No color
And no angels either

No way around it
Was in the stars
No color here
