[Verse 1]
Take me to the sea
And let her waters cover me
Though my heart may sink
There beneath her skin I know I'm safe
From the lies they told to me

[Verse 2]
I wonder if you'll come to me
I wonder if I'll know your face
So beautiful and far away
'Cause if you look inside, you'll see I'm not
I'm not what you would want

[Verse 3]
I heard you were a sailor
You sailed the seven seas
Gathered lots of treasure
But you never
You never uncovered me, no
Uncovered me

[Bridge]
I am
Only in this world now
And I am, I am
Only in this world
Hoping that you'll discover me
I hope that you'll uncover me

[Outro]
Pour yourself like water over me
Pour yourself like water over me, me
In the sea of love, I'm lying
Sea of love, I'm lying
Sea of love, I'm lying
Sea of love, I'm lying
It's over
([?] far away [?])
Hidden
Hidden
(It's what you'd want)
