(Valure)
It's Friday night
Hittin' the club with my girls tonight (what)
I'm hanging out with my girls tonight (who?)
Tamika, Ranisha, Shaniqua, Alicia, Myesha, Aylisha, Janelle
Shanelle, Danielle, Michelle, Rochelle, Anelle
Leave your troubles at the door
Ya'll know what you came here for

(Eddie B.)
Tell your friends to come along (okay)
My crew, your crew, we can get it on
And wear that little thing I like
You know. A thong
I wanna see you bounce and shake it all night long
Baby, leave your digits on the dresser
I'll call you (sure you will, yeah, whateva)
Okay, I'll have it your way
It's all right with me, so what's it gonna be?

(Chorus, Valure)
Ladies, open up a bottle of cris, and make your man lose it
You ain't gotta hurt nobody
Shake it on the floor
Let him know that you want some more
Fellas, if your game is tight
You'll be leavin' with a lady tonight
Take her home and lay down the pipe and make this night last forever
Do what ya gotta do to the music
Take yourself and losse your mind to the music
Let these brothers know you know how to move it
Don't procrastinate
Just get right to it
Cuz if you know what it is then the game's on
Sky's the limit, baby girl, you got on and on
Too hot in here
I wanna take my clothes off (take my clothes off)

(Gabrielle)
Body goin' through convulsions like you on crack
Yeah, baby, you can dance, but your game is wack
The way I work it on the floor, I know you like that
I'm with my crew Fatty Koo, you know where I'm at
And maybe I can take your cell
But I won't hit you back
Come get with me
You fell you won't, but you still wanna
For me the night is goin' just how it's supposed ta
It makes me kinda wanna get a little closer

(Chorus, Valure)
Ladies, open up a bottle of cris, and make your lose it
You ain't gotta hurt nobody
Shake it on the floor
Let him know that you want some more
Fellas, if your game is tight
You'll be leavin' with a lady tonight
Take her home and lay down the pipe and make this night last forever
Do what ya gotta do to the music
Take yourself and lose your mind to the music
Let these brothers know you know how to move it
Don't procrastinate
Just get right to it
Cuz if you know what it is then the game's on
Sky's the limit, baby girl, you got on and on
Too hot in here
I wanna take my clothes off (take my clothes off)

(Break, Valure)
You wan com test me?
My style's too sweet, he can't touch me
This lady's style spittin' lovely
Are you really ready for this jelly?
Ya like it when we do it right there
Tell your man com chill right here
While the models take down their hair
Strike a pose and step right there
Ya wonder how I walk in these jeans
There's room for two in these jeans
Lookin' so fresh and so clean
I talk slick.......you don't have to call, I'm a be okay
Said I'm chillin' with my girls tonight
So it's gonna be all right
I said it's gonna be all right

(Chorus, Valure)
Ladies, open up a bottle of cris, and make your man lose it
You ain't gotta hurt nobody
Shake it on the floor
Let him know that you want some more
Fellas, if you know your game is tight
You'll be leavin' with a lady tonight
Take her home and lay down the pipe and make this night last forever
Do what ya gotta do to the music
Let these brothers know you know how to move it
Don't procrastinate
Just get right to it
Cuz if you know what it is then the game's on
Sky's the limit, baby girl, you got on and on
Too hot in here
I wanna take my clothes off (take my clothes off) come on dance with me
Do what ya gotta do to the music
Take it slow and lose your mind to the music
Do what ya gotta do to the music
Cuz if you know what it is then the game's on
Sky's the limit, baby girl, you got on and on
Too hot in here
I wanna take my clothes off (take my clothes off)
