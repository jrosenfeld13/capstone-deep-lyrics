[Verse 1]
I kill, kill, kill little girls
I kill, kill, kill little girls
It's such a thrill, thrill, thrill to the world
When I kill, kill, kill little girls

[Chorus]
Don't you come near me
Don't you come close to me
Why don't you fear me
Don't dance so close to me
Don't you come near me
Don't you come close to me
Because they won't let me stop now

[Verse 2]
I hate, hate, hate what you are
(You're so pretty when you fly right by)
I hate, hate, hate what you are
(I wanna pluck out your sexy eye)
'Cause I'm a punk rock, punk rock star
(You are everything I despise)
I hate, hate, hate what you are

[Chorus]
Don't you come near me
Don't you come close to me
Why don't you fear me
Don't dance so close to me
Don't you come near me
Don't you come close to me
Because they won't let me stop now
Because I won't stop, can't stop now

[Bridge]
Lost twelve hours of my day
But it's okay
Just black it out
Keep the thief in my pants
Forever fearing contact
Woah yeah, woah
Now I know
Why I wanna be left alone
Lost twelve hours of my day
But it's okay
Just black it out

[Outro]
I'm a psycho, whoa-oh
I'm a psycho, whoa-oh
Don't you come near me
Don't come close to me
Why don't you fear me?
Don't dance so close to me
Because they won't let me stop now
Because I won't stop, can't stop now
Because they won't let me stop now
No
