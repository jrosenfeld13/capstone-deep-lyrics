Dear Mr. Omar Bay
Heard news that you left today
You still countin' all them taxicabs, takin' you back to the time you have left?
Do you well remember Vietnam
When you had a mother who loved her son?
Did you have to leave us all and go away?

Omar Bay, I think I'm fallin' to pieces
Won't you help a good man get up and back on his feet?
Five winters, five winters in New York is plenty
I'd even say it's four too many
Won't you help a good man get up and back on his feet?

Dear Mr. Omar Bay
I saw your old friend form the war today
He said you went to seek God in a church or to get some warmth, whatever came first
And now your standpipe it stands alone

If where you place your cap is your home
Did you have to leave us all and go away?

Omar Bay, I think I'm fallin' to pieces
Won't you help a good man get up and back on his feet?
Five winters, five winters in New York is plenty
I'd even say it's four too many
Won't you help a good man get up and back on his feet?

Omar Bay, I think I'm fallin' to pieces
Won't you help a good man get up and back on his feet?
