Watch yourself before you crawl inside somebody else
Were you here to trap me like a thousand bottled tears?
Even though you disappeared with no goodbye, I see you almost everywhere
You're everywhere

I'm haunted
And all I see is you
I'm haunted
All I need is you
There is no one else
There is no one else except for you

I still dream; I won't give up until I wear your ring
Violate; and if you do it, try not to be late
A hundred winters make the spring insane
A hundred nights without you, I'm not okay
I'm not okay

I'm haunted
And all I see is you
I'm haunted
All I need is you
And I can't go too far to find out where you are
I'm haunted
And all I see is you
I'm haunted and
Everyone is you
And there is no one else, there is no one else

The memory burns so deep in my heart through the hollow hours
You're close to me, I can feel, I can feel

I'm haunted
I'm haunted
I'm haunted
And all I see is you
I'm haunted
And everyone is you and there is no one else
There is no one else except for you
