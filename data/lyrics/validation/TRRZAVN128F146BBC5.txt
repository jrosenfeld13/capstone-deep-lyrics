[Verse 1]
You always find a way, to hurt my pride
If i'm not crying, you're not, satisfied
I don't know why you want to, hurt me so

[Chorus]
If you're trying to break my heart
You don't have very far to go

[Verse 2]
You don't have very far to go before the heartaches, begin
I already feel the sadness, of a heartbreak, setting in
You've turning down the flame of love, too low

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Turn around
You don't have very far to go before the heartaches begin
I already feel the sadness of a heartbreak setting in
You can't love me and still love, to hurt me so

[Chorus]
