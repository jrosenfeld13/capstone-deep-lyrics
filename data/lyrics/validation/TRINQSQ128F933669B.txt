They took a piece of the evil me, the evil me
Expressing that I was not asked but it was unimpressive and overspread

We can't conceive of the whole ordeal when the outcomes' real
Going on to become a mess, there's no turning back, that's in your head
You can't believe what you have all been seeing through this sick ordeal
Waking up to recognize there's not any doubt you've been killing the evil me

...An unbelieveable breed

Stepping on the feet of unnatural anatomy
Doubled up on trauma and treating the catastrophy

Your crazed aversions of the completed task have come to pass
And moving on to bring out the best of the one that's sad, the other's dead
You can't conceive what you really need to kill the greed
Waking up to recognize there's not any doubt you've been killing the evil me

...An unbelievable breed

Stepping on the feet of unnatural anatomy
Doubled up on trauma and treating the catastrophy
