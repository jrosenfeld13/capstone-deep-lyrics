[Verse]
You say tomorrow you're going
It's so hard for me to believe
I'm making plans for the heartaches
Because you're making plans to leave
The tears for me will be falling
Like a tree shedding its leaves
I'm making plans for the tear drops
Because you're making plans to leave
You're making plans to forget me
I'm making plans to miss you
I'm getting ready ti grieve
I'm making plans to be lonesome
Because you're making plans to leave
I'm making plans to be lonesome
Because you're making plans to leave
