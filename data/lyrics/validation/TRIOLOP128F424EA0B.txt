If the worlds can't be combined
If the words checkmate the mind
I will join the sleeper
In my gullible repose

And the demon lurks in doubt
And the brilliance blackenes out
And my cuts go deeper
Than a feeling ever goes

Come erase my greed
Come erase my hunger
Come erase my name and number...

Can you protect me from myself
And play my part in all i care for
So i can leave the scenery
Tape up my eyes, inject the void
And play my part in all i care for
So i can leave the scenery

I'll ignore the side-effect
If the fraud remains intact
In galvanic motion
In reverse-slow-motion-play

In a long-forgotten note
Underneath an icy coat
In a damaged ocean
I'm safely locked away

Come erase my greed
Come erase my hunger
Come erase my name and number...

Can you protect me from myself
And play my part in all i care for
So i can leave the scenery
Tape up my eyes, inject the void
And play my part in all i care for
So i can leave the scenery

Disassamble the machine
Interrupt the smooth routine
No more false resistance
No control and no restraint

In your promise to be there
To protect me and to care
In redeeming distance
I may rest in deepest faint

Come erase my greed
Come erase my hunger
Come erase my name and number...
Come erase the scars
Come erase the memory
Come erare the evidence...

Can you protect me from myself
And play my part in all i care for
So i can leave the scenery
Tape up my eyes, inject the void
And play my part in all i care for
So i can leave the scenery
