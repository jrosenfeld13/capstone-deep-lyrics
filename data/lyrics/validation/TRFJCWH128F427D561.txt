Da poetry
By now you should know it's me
The brother of word
Giving thanks and praises
To so many names and faces
In different places
From '84 to '99
It's been a very long time
Since the movement called hip-hop arrived
To this cold country of mine
Seen the old, the new
And now the true school
And for once I can say
Something has changed
Or is it just me
In the place to be (hardcore)
Am I about to take it in my face
Question, where were you at at the time of the fat shoelaces
When the hell was really raised, huh
I know every face
Writers, breakers, DJ's, MC's, Fly girls
Representing, respecting, unwritten laws
Rules, star wars
But even though
There's one thing I know
And it's been said before
Eliminate the distance
It's not where you're from, it's where you at
Mentally
The poetry
Enough love, peace and respect
Come correct
You gotta pay your dues
If you've got something to prove
It is a competition
Cause the business side can't see the mission
A-k-a the B-boy vision
Two thousand and still counting

Yo it S-U-C-K-S
And I gotta run but come for the Bomfunk crew
So you'd better listen if you don't wanna be missing
The perfect combination on a mission to rock the dancefloor
To hit you right where it hurts, I'll leave you begging for more
Like Roger, but this is not a story of a rabbit
Gismo and B-O-W just got a habit
Of speeding up your heartbeat
Moving you no doubt, so Bomfunk MC's do it to the crowd
What up looking good, catch me cooking food
