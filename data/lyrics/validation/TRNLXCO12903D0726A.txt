Well in the end my friend well all be together again
Cause you hold onto my hand
And I thought it was sand but youre slipping again
In the wild we smile budge on another mile
A [?] deals tied to the level of resell
No one's ever going to say a thing
And well be together together again
Take me on a city on down

Just a while ago my soul was confused abused
And what it did not know days went by and the amusement cried
I decided to let my soul fly on by itself
Thank happiness Ive bringing back to myself
Well be okay one day in the valley well say
I know were moving on I think Im reminded all along
I wont have to hold your crown no one to look around
Yes hold you all tight on the city on down
The city on down yeah yeah

A while ago my soul was confused amused
At what it did not know days went by
Amusement cry I decided this I we got to move on now
But Ive been so scared well Ive been frightened
You're all someone lighting we can change our shoes
Now we walk through a valley of color
So much better than the other
We were just dont know now we can be united we can

We can walk together at a regular speed
And dare to be silent in an argue [?]
