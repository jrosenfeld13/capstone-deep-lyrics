Well traveling to the point that I, I can't stop it
Get so familiar
Never get enough
Talk about it all the time
Just drop it
Damage on your pretty little eyes says it all

I can't stand to be under your wing
I can't fly or sink or swim it's a lot like falling down
Standing up and I'm falling down
Fill my cup till I understand
Wait a minute and see the pieces don't fit this time

Well yesterday's news is what I been reading
See you at the Comet and I end up needing
To know if you were thinking it could have been
If it was nothing it's cause nothing's what you did

I can't stand to be under your wing
I can't fly or sink or swim it's a lot like falling down
Standing up and I'm falling down
Your my cup till I understand
Wait a minute and see the pieces don't fit this time

Well I can't stand to be under your wing
I can't fly or sink or swim it's a lot like falling down
I'm standing up and I'm falling down
Fill my cup till I understand
Wait a minute and see the pieces don't fit this time
