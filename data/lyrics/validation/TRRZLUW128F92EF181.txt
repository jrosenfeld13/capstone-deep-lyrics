Some changes are occurring in the next few weeks
A long-standing problem will be sorted out at last
Don't expect miracles, but look on the bright side
When you're in a hurry nothing happens fast
Stand by your beliefs because your star is genuine
Look towards the future, don't dwell on the past

It's time to embark on a dreamt about project
Throw caution to the winds and build that sailing boat
Answer that letter, it means so much to hear from you
Mum's kept every word you ever wrote
Always keep your own counsel in matters of the heart
But don't despair when the love sign seems remote
In a matter of moments life can make a new start
Though your heart feels like sinking, keep your spirit afloat

When things can ensue from a glimmer of hope
You can steer by the stars in your horoscope

Don't be afraid of the slippery slope
There's a new day tomorrow in your horoscope

Sealed with a kiss in a blue envelope
Delivered with pleasure is your horoscope
