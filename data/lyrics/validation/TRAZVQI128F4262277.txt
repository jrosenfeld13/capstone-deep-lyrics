Everyday I think 'Man, it can't get no worse'

Everyday I surprise even myself

Every night I sit and wonder why

Everyday I want to fucking die

Fuck the World

Everyday the shit it brings me down

Every night I want to go out and kill

Everyday I somehow rise above

Every night I pray that I always will

Fuck the World

Fuck the World

Fuck the World

Fuck the World

.......................

Fuck the World

Fuck the World

Fuck the World

Fuck the World..... YEAH
