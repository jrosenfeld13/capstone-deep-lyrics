Well play me anything that makes my heart sing man
Never turn this car around
Well set fire to the smokes and drive all night
Looking for that golden lonesome sound

There aint no saints out on the highway tonight
Just a couple lost and lonely drunken seekers
We hear the tires on the ice but we aint scared
Black Rose is blowing out them speakers

Free man now
Youre free
Up in the arms of them drunken angels
Dancing on the moon

Well Im all coiled up and ready to strike
Like a viper in the rough in the setting sun
Shocked and terrified
Like a sniper in the grass long after the war is done

I miss you in my bed
I miss your heartbeat sound
I swear to god sometimes I can still feel it

And the things I said to you still shatter my head
But you knew me so well you knew I never meant it
Set fire to my smoke and drive all night
Looking for that golden lonesome sound

Free man now
Youre free
Up in the arms of them drunken angels
Dancing on the moon

Tears crystallize on the highway
Sparkle in the sun
Tears crystallize on the highway
They sparkle in the sun
Tears crystallize on the highway
They sparkle in the sun
Tears crystallize on the highway

Its not your fault
Its not your fault
Its not your fault

Free man now
Youre free
Up in the arms of them drunken angels
Dancing on the moon

Free man now
Youre free
Up in the arms of them drunken angels
Dancing on the moon

Fade away
Fade away
Fade away
Fade away
Fade away
