[Verse 1]
"Come waste your millions here"
Secretly she sneers
Another corporate show
A guilty conscience grows
I'll feel a guilty conscience grow
I'll feel a guilty conscience grow

[Hook 1]
She burns like the sun
And I can't look away
And she'll burn our horizons
Make no mistake

[Verse 2]
Come let the truth be shared
No one ever dared
To break these endless lies
Secretly she cries

[Hook 1]
She burns like the sun
And I can't look away
And she'll burn our horizons
Make no mistake

[Hook 2]
And I'll hide from the world
Behind a broken frame
And I'll run forever
I can't face the shame

And I'll hide from the world
Behind a broken frame
And I'll run forever
I can't face the shame
