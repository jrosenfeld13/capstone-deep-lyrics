Look to the children
They shine forevermore
The light in their eyes
Can open up the door
Light our way

Lost in the night
We watch how they play
Mystic moon in the sky
Hear what I say
Dont go, dont go away

Is there no reason
Reason of the Ghost
I see no reason
Reason of the Ghost
Is there no reason
Reason of the Ghost
Oh, save our souls

They have magic and games
Theyve hope for the day
Dont hand them their dreams
Just to take them away
Dont tell them the lion is rugged and pale
Tell them you're dreaming

Theyre hungry, theyre poor
They stand in the rain
They wait for theyre sure
The pain stays the same
Step into the night
And live with the shame
Their tears have all dried
But are they ok

Reason of the Ghost
