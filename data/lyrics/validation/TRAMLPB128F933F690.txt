I put the locket you gave me in a shoe box
With all my favorite high school pictures in a ziplock
So when I think about myself
And all that I'm not
Thanks for the extra cash
Please take good care of dad
I promise you I'll call along the way

Mama, don't you cry
I'm movin' on
But know this ain't goodbye
We might be miles apart
I'll carry you in my heart
I'll send you kisses on the phone
But mama, I'm leaving home

In only four months
I'll be comin' home for Christmas
I bet that all the time will fly
You know how it does
Maybe I'll go and find a nice guy and fall in love

I'll do my best to make you proud
Keep my room safe for now
Just in case these big dreams don't work out

Mama, don't you cry
I'm movin' on but know this ain't goodbye
We might be miles apart
I'll carry you in my heart
I'll send you kisses on the phone
But mama, I'm leaving home

We knew this day would come
And as bad as you wanna hold on
We both know it's time to let go
(To let go)

Mama, don't you cry
I'm movin' on
But know this ain't goodbye

Mama, don't you cry
I'm movin' on
But know this ain't goodbye
We might be miles apart
I'll carry you in my heart
I'll send you kisses on the phone
But mama, I'm leaving home

I'm leaving home
I'm leaving home
