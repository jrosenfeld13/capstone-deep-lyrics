(wener)
Got an open mind just for show
Got a one track mind don't I
Got to go got to go but I'm easily lead
Got to go got to go but I'm easily
God I'm lost inside you again
Got an old desire for you
Got to go got to go but I'm easily lead
I'd like to stay and get more bedhead
Higher, higher, higher ooh ah ooh o wow
Higher, higher, higher ooh ah ooh o wow
Yes, yes I think so
Yes, yes I think so
Think I'll try to call you again
Make a nice surprise don't you
Got to go got to go but I'm easily lead

Got to go got to go but I'm easily
Made a note to leave you alone
I'm too drunk to read aren't I
Got to go got to go but I'm easily lead
I'd like to stay and get more bedhead
Higher, higher, higher ooh ah ooh o wow
Higher, higher, higher ooh ah ooh o wow
Yes, yes I think so
Yes, yes I think so
Got to go now, know I must see you soon
We'll get bedhead and stay awake 'til high noon
Yes, yes I think so
Yes, yes I think so
Yes, yes ooh I think so
Yes, yes ooh I think so
