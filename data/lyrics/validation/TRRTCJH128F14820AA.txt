Breathe in you are strong
All the barriers are gone
Let it carry us somewhere unreachable
I would never hurt you
Baby my virtue
Has proven itself unimpeachable

Lets just say
There are those long days
There is this dumb luck
There is a brand new way opening up

Streets buildings and cars
Faraway stars
My fingers move over the borderline
Breathe in you're the stranger
There is no danger
We'll fall into that rogue right hand of mine

CHORUS

Skin all over you
I'm a worrier it's true
I came over to cushion your breakables
Breathe in you are stronger
You don't have to wonder
You know my conviction's unshakable

CHORUS

There are these long eyes
There is this good love
There is a brand new way
Opening up (x3)
