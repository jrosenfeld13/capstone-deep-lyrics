I found another girl that I had to love, aw shit man
She's the kind of woman I've been so scared of, aw shit man
Now I'm going to make her
Well I'm gonna make her
I've got to make her mine
Aw, shit man
Aw, shit man

I'm gonna be an asshole for the rest of my life, aw shit man
I'll never be forgiven by my daughter and wife, aw shit man
Don't know if I can take it
Don't know if I can take it
Don't know if I can take it
Aw, shit man

They say it's just another fucker with a mid-life crisis, aw shit man
But I'm a motherfucker with the midwife Christ, aw shit man
Now i'm undertaking
I'm undertaking
It's undertaker time
Aw, shit man
Aw, shit man
Aw, shit man
