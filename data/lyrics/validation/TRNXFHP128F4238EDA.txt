I could feel your fire down on the dance floor darling
And I know that Ive been needing you around
So dont make a sound now girl, cause I feel your flame on me
And it feels so good, cause I could feel your warmth
Give a little try now girl
Try to understand
I aint no fool in love
I just want to be your man
Come a little closer now
You know you should girl
You wont need nothing else
I could do you some good

(Chorus)
Ohh, you catch me a fire girl
You catch me a fire girl
And in that fire theres a flame that dances the whole night through
I know that flame wont burn out, as long as Im with you
So come on baby, wear this ring, dont you worry about a thing
Because I want your fire to light up my future
Try a little tenderness
Take me by the hand
You dont have to change
Just make me a better man
Come on make that fire light shine
Shine upon my soul
You let that love wood burn
So now youre in control

(Chorus)
