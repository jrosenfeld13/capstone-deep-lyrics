I live behind the perfect mask
Erase the rule forever

I live behind the perfect mask
Unleash the truth forever

I live behind the perfect mask
Too late gonna live at last

I live behind the perfect mask
Too late gonna live at last

I live behind the perfect mask
Erase the truth forever

I live behind the perfect mask
Only the true endevour

Help me....i dare say theres no other way
Help me....i dare say theres no other way to go

Wanton fallacy again
Merciless until the end
Recognise my heart is there
So reveal me and disgrace me
