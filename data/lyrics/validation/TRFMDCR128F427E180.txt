Thou shalt never love another
And stand by me all the while
Take happiness with the heartache
And go through life wearing a smile

Oh, how happy we would be if we
Keep the ten commandments
Of love, of love

Thou should always have faith in me
In everything I say and do
Love me with all your heart and soul
Until our life on earth is through

Oh, how happy we would be if we
Keep the ten commandments of love

Love, oh, sweet love
It's oh, so grand
You will find since
The beginning of time
It has ruled in all the land

Come to me when I am lonely
Kiss me when you hold me tight
Treat me sweet and gentle
When we say goodnight

Oh, how happy we would be if we
Keep the ten commandments
Of love, of love

Oh, how happy we would be if we
Keep the ten commandments of love

Love, ooh, ooh, ooh
