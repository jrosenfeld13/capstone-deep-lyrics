They don't ask cause they know I'll say
It ain't nothin' just another woman done walked away
Still on track, no I ain't fazed
I rock on all night long just playing this masquerade

Well, I've got everybody thinkin' I'm superman strong
But that big ole "S" ain't on my chest at night when I get home
One look at my reflection and lonely's all I see
I can tell 'em all I'm glad you're gone
But the truth is I can't lie to me

Call you up and get shot down
Throw my pride aside and I just cry out loud
Called my bluff, now just look at me
A fool in love and all tore up
Down here on my knees

Well, I've got everybody thinkin' I'm superman strong
But that big ole "S" ain't on my chest at night when I get home
One look at my reflection and lonely's all I see
I can tell 'em all I'm glad you're gone
But the truth is I can't lie to me

Oh the truth is I can't lie to me
