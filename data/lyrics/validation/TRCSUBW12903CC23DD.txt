My epitaph shall say "and come what may" With a grain of salt I walked away Commit the past into blue flame They're not crying - I'm not crying We found you hiding - We found you lying Unfazed Unchanged Tomorrows too late Into blue flame Tomorrows too late With a grain of salt I walked away With my eyes shut into the fray The worlds on fire theres no turning back An empty shell, from heaven I fell With a grain of salt I walked away Commit the past into blue flame They're not crying - I'm not crying We found you hiding - We found you lying And Come What May (No matter what may come Whats done is done)
