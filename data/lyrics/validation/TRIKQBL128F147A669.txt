I want you to understand
I'm gonna be your man
You make it easy
You make it easy

I like it here by myself
But I want what no one else
Just sometimes need me
You make it easy

And I want you and I need you
And you know it's true
I can't see myself with no one else

You close down with my hand
Your fallouts be comprehend
You sometimes need me
You make it easy

It's a sad turn
To be on your own
It's a strange view
With no sight of home

And I want you and I need you
And you know it's true
I can't see myself with no one else
I don't see myself with no one else
Could you believe?

I want you to understand
I'm gonna be your man
You make it easy
You make it easy

And I want you and I need you
And you know it's true
I can't see myself with no one else
I don't see myself with no one else

Could you believe?
Could you believe?
Could you believe?
Could you believe?
