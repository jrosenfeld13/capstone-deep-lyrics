Now it begins, now that's you've gone
Needles and pins, twilight till dawn
Watching the clock till you return
Lighting that torch and watching it burn

Now it begins, day after day
This is my life, ticking away
Waiting to hear footsteps that say
Love will appear and this time to stay

Each time you go
I try to pretend
It's over at last
And this time the big hurt will end

Now it begins, now that's you've gone
Needles and pins, twilight till dawn
But if you don't come back again
I'll wonder when, oh when will it end
The Big Hurt
The Big Hurt
The Big Hurt
