[Verse 1]
Something's wrong and it's not me for once
And I know you'll call me crazy
But I hate the way you look straight through me
What have I done that's so wrong?
Remember me, when I'm so far from your reach
When you'll know you had your chance
Take one more glance, and that's the end of our romance

[Chorus]
You've turned your back on me for the last time

[Verse 2]
Remember when we use to be friends?
Nothing could ever go wrong, or so we thought
But I guess you've changed a lot since we were young
Times will change, and there's nothing I can say
To right all of your wrongs
Just grow up, and pray we'll keep in touch

[Chorus]
You've turned your back on me for the last time

[Verse 3]
I still dream of the day that I watched you choke
They'll act like I'm so crazy
When they find you dead on my floor
Right now, right now

[Bridge]
I'd say something went wrong in our lives
And I pray that god saves us before we die

[Refrain]
He's everything that you could never be
[x6]

Right now, right now, right now

[Bridge]
I'd say something went wrong in our lives
And I pray that god saves us before we die

[Outro]
Slowly die
[Repeats until fade out]
