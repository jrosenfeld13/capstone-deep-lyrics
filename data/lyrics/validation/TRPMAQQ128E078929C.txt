Alone And Isolated
Reflecting On My Sorted Past
I've Chosen Not To Stay
Take My Chances Elsewhere Now
Behold The Flask From Where I Stand
Chrome Nectar Scalds My Trembling Hand
My Fate Is Sealed
I Draw It To My Anxious Lips
A Spellbound Urge I Can't Resist

Fell The Rush Of Pain Within My Vain
Inflamed Power Mainlined To My Brain
Metamorphosis

My Flesh, A Composite Outershell
Metalium Changing Every Cell
Shield For Eternity
Perfect Pure Automaton
Body And Mind Are Fused As One

Fell The Rush Of Pain Within My Vain
Inflamed Power Mainlined To My Brain
Metamorphosis
Sensation Intensified Beyond Belief
Thankful For The Mission I Received
Metamorphosis

Feel The Rush Of Pain Within My Vain
Inflamed Power Mainlined To My Brain
Sensation Intensified Beyond Belief
Ohh Thankful For The Mission I Received
Fell The Rush Of Pain Within My Vain
Metamorphosis
Inflamed Power Mainlined To My Brain
Sensation Intensified Beyond Belief
Metamorphosis
Ohh Thankful For The Mission I Received

Metamorphosis !
