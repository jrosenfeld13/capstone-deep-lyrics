Daylight splits the room
You sleep while I watch you
How the light shines on you now

Breathless and playing tricks
But you rise to my fingertips
How the light shines on you now

I'll be the one to set the story straight and
I'll be the one to take your hand and say
Now we run
What's done is done
Let time heal time
Your hand in mine

Sundance my friend
Truth is the city's dead
It's been dying since you left

Don't look for me here
These waters will never clear
Even light dies through the years

I'll be the one to set the story straight and
I'll be the one to take your hand and say
Now we run
What's done is done
We slip through the wires
Fight fire with fire
And we search for a sign
Through white noise, white lies

Daylight leaves the room
You sleep while I watch you
How the light shines on you now
