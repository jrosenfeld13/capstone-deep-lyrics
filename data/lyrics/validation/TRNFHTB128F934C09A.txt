Glowing rocks, blazing heat that covers our worlds
Down their throne they send their armies of worms
Consuming misery
This is breeze of the kings
Extrusion of the malice beyond erased reality
Exterminated all blackness seed
Eradicating the roots of mortal history
This is the breeze of the kings!
This is the answer to our sins!
This is the storm to be unleashed
A storm to wash away a storm for a decay
This is the poison we will drink, a storm to clean the wounds
A storm for a rebuilding, this is the breeze of the kings
This is the breeze of the kings!
