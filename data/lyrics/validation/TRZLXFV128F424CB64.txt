Some kind of magic in the air apocalyptic
I don't care I am a rocket I am the lady you can't get
Some more love tricks in my hat supersonic
May I be blond or brunette I am the soulmate you can't get

People and pleasure, objects and power

Playmate of the century posing in the galaxy

Some kind of cosmic in the air electrostatic
I don't care I am a magnet I am the power you can't get
Some more love kicks from the hood intergalactic
In your planet of your regret I am the girlfriend you can't get
