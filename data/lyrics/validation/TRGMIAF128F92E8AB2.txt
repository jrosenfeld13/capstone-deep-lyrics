Not of this world
And nothing bites like I do
Nothing screams out loud
In this empty night
Nothing can keep me from you

And you think that you know
The reason I'm alive
Truth is you only
Know the lies

Not of this world
And nothing can hold it back
I am the dawn upon your bloody beach
Come to pass

Not of this world
For I am nothing known
When the seasons shift
They call my name
To carry me home

And you think that you know
The reason I'm alive
Truth is you only know the lies
And I feel all the things
You could never understand
Choose where you stand
Am I mortal
Are you
Man

Not of this world
Nothing bites like I do
Nothing screams out loud
In this empty night
Nothing can keep me from you

Choose where you stand
Am I mortal
Are you
Man
Yea

Not of this world
For I am nothing known
When the seasons shift
They call my name
To carry me home
