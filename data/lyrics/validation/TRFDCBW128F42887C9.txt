[Intro:]
Are you strong enough?
Give me what I want
Can you please me?
Right now?

Are you strong enough?
Give me what I want
Can you please me?
Right now

(Right now, right now)
Come on!
(Now, now, now, now, now, whoa, oh)

[Verse 1:]
So you know my name
Now you know my number
Don`t the others want you anymore?

If you`re gonna call
You`ll see
I`m stronger
Stronger than the girls you had before

[Chorus:]
Well
Do you know how to please?
Do ya
Do ya wanna please me?

Do ya
Do ya wanna please me?
Do ya
Do ya wanna please?
Please me now
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2:]
Tell me how it feels
Now the table`s turning
I could get you underneath my thumb

Have you got a heart?
Is your heart burning?
Tell me
Is it pounding like a drum?

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Please
Please

[Repeat x4:]
Give me what I want
Give me what I need

[Chorus:]
Oh
Do you know how to please?
Do ya
Do ya wanna please me?

Do ya?
Do ya wanna please me?
Do ya
Do ya wanna please?
Please me now
Oh, oh, oh
