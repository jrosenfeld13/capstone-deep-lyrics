The Romance is over
The game we played
We said our last goodbye
We ran out of luck
We ran out of love
And there's no reason to cry
Then I remember our time together
You were the dream of my life
I remember you

Chorus:
Be mine - tonight - tonight
Be mine just one more time
You think I'm crazy
I think you're blind
Who's the one to blame
The poison was sweet
Surrender with passion
The magic never sustained
Then I remember our time together
You were the queen of my nights
Chorus
