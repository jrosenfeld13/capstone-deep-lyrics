Time for the old smashy, smashy

[Verse 1]
Through the ceiling
And over the streets
The astral plane
Can't be beat

For crime
On my mind
Totally leaves my feet

Son, do you have an alibi
Yeah, anytime
Got me, officer
I was asleep

[Chorus]
We're young
We're fast
We're dangerous
And we're hard to catch

Got style so fine
And with criminal minds
We're young
We're fast
We're dangerous

[Verse 2]
You're not gonna believe it
So you'll never see it
Jon Gilch, our man with a plan
He took the ball then he ran

Incendiarism
Manic precision
Boys and girls
With a mission

Some things appear
And others go away
Girls and boys
Who hate your day

[Chorus]
