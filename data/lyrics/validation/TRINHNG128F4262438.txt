A different pain when the axe falls on you
Watching hurt from far away
Can only make us blue
My life is only mine
And no one really cares if every day
I hit that peel and stumble down the stairs
You don't know you don't know the pain
You can't feel the same
Many things i want
That i will never get
Go through my life without even a little regret
Some things i need will never come to me
Even if i kneel and pray and squeeze my rosary
You don't know the pain
You can't feel the same
In this life you're always on your own
Nobody really hears a cry of pain
That sounds like it's alone
Sounds like it's alone
