HOW CAN YOU BE SO QUICK TO CONDEMN
BY WORD OR RUMOR, HEARD FROM A FRIEND?
ONE CAN'T BELIEVE ALL THAT ONE HEARS
IT'S YOUR DECISION, AND NOT YOUR PEERS
THINK FOR YOURSELF
DON'T RELY ON SOMEONE ELSE
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT I'M THAT WAY?
YOU DON'T KNOW, JUST HEARD IT WAS SO
YOU'RE AGAINST ME, WELL HOW CAN THAT BE?
WE'VE NEVER MET, YOUR OPINION'S BEEN SET
THINK FOR YOURSELF
DON'T RELY ON SOMEONE ELSE
INSPECT EACH SITUATION, SEE FROM BOTH SIDES
SEEK OUT THE TRUTH, BURY THE LIES
ONE CAN'T BELIEVE ALL THAT ONE HEARS
IT'S YOUR DECISION, AND NOT YOUR PEERS
THINK FOR YOURSELF
DON'T RELY ON SOMEONE ELSE
