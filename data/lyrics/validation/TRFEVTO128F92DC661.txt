Stand in war or rest in peace...
Rage...rage
Got some rage to exorcise
Rage...rage
Got some rage to exorcise
Go!
No turning back and no way out
Nobody leaves without a fight
Time is always a bit early
Victory precedes the Victor
The virtual war...fora concrete peace
Put...put your soldiers on the line
And your wish will be divine
Stand...stand and walk above the rest
No one but you can be the best
The virtual war...for a concrete peace
Rage...rage
Got some rage to exorcise
Go!
So much to see so much to hear
So much to give so much to get
Life is never more than you know
But it's sometimes more than you see
Something has to be cleaned
Before you bring your own nex dirt...Yeah!
Something has to be cleaned
Before you bring your own nex dirt...Destroy!
Rage...rage
Got some rage to exorcise
Rage...rage
Got some rage to exorcise
Go!
No turning back and no way out
Nobody leaves without a fight
Time is always a bit early
Victory precedes the Victor
The virtual war...for a concrete peace
