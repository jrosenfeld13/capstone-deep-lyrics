Walk by the ocean, swim in the seas
There's a line in the river where 2 waters become free
Walk by the ocean, swim in the sea
There's a mark in the river where 2 waters become free

Underneath my eyelids there are vivid pictures
Of a face I have not seen, yet a spirit so clear to me
A strong current that of a river joined by the seas
Where two waters become together, two waters become free

Let's walk by the ocean, swim in the sea
There's a line in the river where 2 waters become free
Walk by the ocean, swim in the sea
There's a line in the river where 2 water become free

Above my lips, there is a scent of a kiss
That I have not tasted, no time has been wasted
And the flavor of a kindred soul, blended in the mist
Where two angels become one soul, there's truth in this

Let's walk by the ocean, swim in the sea
There's a line in the river where 2 waters become free
Walk by the ocean, swim in the sea
There's a line in the river where 2 water become free

Taken by every word that leaves your fingers
I dream of your hips, the dancing of your body expressing your gift
And as deep as a flood I'm in to my knees

Twisted in the bliss of the obvious, for every drop of rain
Reminding me of the tears you gave
And as sure as the day, I love you in many ways

Let's walk by the ocean, swim in the sea
There's a line in the river where 2 waters become free
Walk by the ocean, swim in the sea
There's a line in the river where 2 water become free
