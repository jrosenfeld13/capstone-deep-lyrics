In a bar in San Francisco
We are dancin' in the night
And her ruby lips are sayin'
Love me right now!

As she wrappes her arms around me
It all seemed to be alright
You are yesterday and gone
While she's right here and now

And I'm dancin' and dancin'
And givin' and livin' your memory away
Now I'm ready to say: I am alive!

In the arms of a stranger
My heart's out of danger, I am OK
Let the music play - I am alive!

And I'm dancin' and dancin'
And givin' and livin' your memory away
Now I'm ready to say: I am alive!

In the arms of a stranger
My heart's out of danger, I am OK
Let the music play - I am alive!

In a way I'm glad it's over
Even though I'm feelin' blue
It was time for me to move
Into a town

I will learn to live without you
And I know I'll make it through
'Cause our love was just a circus
I'll never be your clown!

And I'm dancin' and dancin'
And givin' and livin' your memory away
Now I'm ready to say: I am alive!

In the arms of a stranger
My heart's out of danger, I am OK
Let the music play - I am alive!
