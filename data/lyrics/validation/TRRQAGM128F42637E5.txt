Not shocked at your buff and cocky smart-ass grin
Not hooked, you know you got to sink or swim
Not found when you look into the scorcher's eyes
Not there when the history books are printing lies

You got the weary number
Pick up the party line
You get the bad cucumber
Ah, you're never going to fall behind

You're not shocked
You're not shocked

Not dreamt in my dreams, enough is said
Not false, it's the velvet circus in your head
Not nails, the gallow glass is cracking fast
Not wrecked, but feeling just a little smashed

You got the weary numbers
Pick up the party line
You get the bad cucumber
Ah, you're never going to fall behind

You're not shocked
You're not shocked

They get so excited
They get so united
They get so endangered
And you become a stranger

They get so endangered
And you become a stranger

You're not shocked, yeah
You're not shocked

(I'm not shocked, I'm not shocked)
You're not shocked
(I'm not shocked)
You're not shocked
You're not shocked
