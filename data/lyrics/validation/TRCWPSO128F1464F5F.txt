Take your medicine
Scented roses
One for the sake of it
Keep to small doses

Swallow it
Like a good girl
Swallow it
Like the fool you are
Swallow it
Like a good boy
Swallow it
Like the fool you are

You believe in anything
Put in front of your face
Watch the mass be served more trash
Up to my neck in garbage

Swallow it
Like a good girl
Swallow it
Like the fool you are
Swallow it
Like a good boy
Swallow it
Like the fool you are

Poisened personalities
Talking in household names
The package is the prize
That's sure to catch your eye
And the contents taste the same

Swallow it
Like a good girl
Swallow it
Like the fool you are
Swallow it
Like a good boy
Swallow it
Like the fool you are

Like the fool you are
Like the fool you are
