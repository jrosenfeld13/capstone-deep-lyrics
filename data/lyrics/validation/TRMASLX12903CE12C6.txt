[Verse 1]
You want me to come over, I got an excuse
I might be holding your hand, but I'm holding it loose
Go to talk then we choke its like our necks in a noose
Avoid the obvious, we should be facing the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
Start to think it could be fizzling out
Kinda' shocked because I never really had any doubts
Look into your eyes, imagine life without ya

[Chorus]
And the love kickstarts again
Starts again
And the love kickstarts again
Starts again

[Verse 2]
It's the same old you, the same old me
You get bored and I get cold feet
Get high get wandering eyes
Forget I've never ever had it so sweet
I realize what I got when I'm out of town
'Cos deep down you're my girl in a golden crown
My princess and I don't wanna let you down
No I don't wanna let you down down down down...

[Verse 1]
You want me to come over, I got an excuse
Might be holding your hand, but I'm holding it loose
Go to talk then we choke its like our necks in a noose
Avoid the obvious, we should be facing the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
Start to think it could be fizzling out
Kinda' shocked because I never really had any doubts
Look into your eyes, imagine life without ya
Kick kickstarts again
Start to think it could be fizzling out
Kinda' shocked because I never really had any doubts
Look into your eyes, imagine life without ya
Imagine life without ya
Without ya
Without ya

[Chorus]
And the love kickstarts again
Starts again
And the love kickstarts again
Starts again
Kick kickstarts

[Verse 2]
It's the same old you, the same old me
You get bored and I get cold feet
Get high get wandering eyes
Forget I've never ever had it so sweet
I realize what I got when I'm out of town
'Cos deep down you're my girl in a golden crown
My princess and I don't wanna let you down
Kick kickstarts again

[Pre-Chorus]
Start to think it could be fizzling out
Kinda' shocked because I never really had any doubts
Look into your eyes, imagine life without ya
And the love kickstarts again
