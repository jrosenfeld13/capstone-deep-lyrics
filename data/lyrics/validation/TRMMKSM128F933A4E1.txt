I get along
Fall apart through the night, then I get back right for the daytime
I'm never wrong
Once I clear my mind and I hear the signs all around me
And as for the sunrise
She just can't wait to see me cry (Cry)
Baby, I've been flying
I don't know what's happening inside
I'm not even trying (I'm flying)
I want to be
Christ, I don't know
I'm innocent
So I can't make a dent, there's no big event to attend to
Or I would take you
Baby, I've been flying
I don't know what's happening inside
I'm not even trying (I'm flying)
I want to be
Christ, I don't know

Baby, I've been flying
I don't know what's happening inside
I'm not even trying (I'm flying)
I want to be
Christ
Baby, I've been flying
I don't know what's happening inside
I get along
Fall apart through the night, then I get back right for the daytime
And as for the sunrise
She just can't wait to see me cry (Cry)
