[Verse 1]
Here's another state to mind
My head is clear but I'm cold
I fulfil all your dreams

[Verse 2]
Here's another point of view
My head is free but I ain't cool
I fulfil all your dreams

[Verse 3]
I put myself in big disgrace
For I had to fall down my face
Could not carry on

[Verse 4]
I put myself in big disgrace
When trouble come I know my fate
So pay the price with blood and hate

[Chorus]
I feel right
I feel right

[Verse 5]
When the point of time is right
Then I try to change my mind
Give me some relief

[Bridge]
But I know one day will come
Where I will find peace

[Verse 4]
I put myself in big disgrace
When trouble come I know my fate
So pay the price with blood and hate

[Chorus x2]
I feel right
I feel right
