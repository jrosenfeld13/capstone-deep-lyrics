Come to me, you who are weak
Let my strength be yours tonight
Come and rest, let my love be your bed
Let my heart be yours tonight
Peace be still, peace be still
Please be still
And know that I am God
And know that I am God
Come empty cup, let me fill you up
I'll descend on you like a dove tonight
Lift your head, let your eyes fall into Mine
Let your fear subside tonight
Peace be still, peace be still
Please be still
And know that I am God
And know that I am God
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Peace be still, peace be still
Please be still
And know that I am God
And know that I am God
