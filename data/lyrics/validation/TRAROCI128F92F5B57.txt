Part 1, Spring is Alive

Refrain

Spring is alive in Carolina
Deep in the forest where the foxfire glows
High on a mountain, down in a holler
Thunder and lightnin' so it goes

Verse 1
Over a hundred years ago we came to Carolina
Far across the water, it's a long hard road
With little more than courage
We came seeking independence
A little less than nothin' is a heavy load

Verse 2
From the heather to the highlands
We have found the Smoky Mountains
Hard work and simple ways
And life is good, life is good

Refrain

Spring is alive in Carolina
Deep in the forest where the foxfire glows
High on a mountain, down in a holler
Thunder and lightnin' so it goes

Part 2, You Are

Verse 3
You are every mornin' sunrise
You are every rain
You are every peal of laughter
You are every cry of pain

Verse 4
You are all the summer flowers
You are all the falling leaves
You are everyone rejoicin'
You are everyone who grieves

Verse 5
You are all my unknown secrets
You are all my hidden fears
You are known in lover's kisses
You are seen in childhood tears

Verse 6
You are where the stars are shinin'
You are where the rainbow ends
You are why the war is over
You are how the peace begins

Part 3 Whisper the Wind

Verse 7
Whisper the wind over the water
Whisper the wind all through the night
Whisper the wind along the canyon
Whisper the wind into the light

Verse 8
Whisper the wind brothers and sisters
Whisper the wind all the same
Whisper the wind love one another
Whisper the wind your precious name

Part 4 Spring is Alive (Reprise)

Spring is alive in Carolina
Deep in the forest where the foxfire glows
High on a mountain, down in a holler
Thunder and lightnin' so it goes

Spring is alive in Carolina
Deep in the forest where the foxfire glows
High on a mountain, down in a holler
Thunder and lightnin' so it goes, so it goes
