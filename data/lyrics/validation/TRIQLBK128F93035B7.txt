So many times you ran yourself over
Talking back on a cold-crying shoulder
Get in a car with the taxi driver
Sympathy of strangers, hoping to find her

Oh oh oh oh-oh-oh

Collisions came as consequence
Watching the scene after the accident
Mixed-up words, find out what she meant
Witness the scene after the accident

Passersby, nothing to see here at all
Fast-forward talking yourself into the wall
You never asked for an audience
So why'd you care 'bout the reviews you're gonna get?

Mixed-up words, find out what she meant
Witness the scene after the accident
Collisions came as consequence
Watching the scene after the accident

Oh oh oh oh-oh-oh

Mixed-up words, find out what she meant
Witness the scene after the accident

Oh oh oh oh-oh-oh

Collisions came as consequence
Watching the scene after the accident

Oh oh oh oh-oh-oh

Mixed-up words, find out what she meant
Watching the scene after the accident
