There is a place that has no name
No sound of laughter, no children playing
It's not on the map but it's there just the same
The places that built the toys for the nuclear game

Sascha digs the food in the snow
It fills the gaps where his pension don't go
He spent his life making weapons of war
Times have changed
They don't need him no more
Beat the drum
Beat the drum

Since Joseph built his iron wall
And America raced for the moon
We wasted our breath, on the science of death
It was what we were told we must do
A lethal quest to show who's best
What on Earth did it prove?
I don't know

Beat the drum
Like an army
You've got the voice
So state your choice
Beat the drum
Beat it loudly
You have nothing to lose
Beat the drum
Go your own way
Just speak your mind
Don't follow blindly
Beat the drum
Beat it proudly
Every step of the way

In every time and every place
There are those who believe they must lead
Their ambition is used as a hiding place
For selfish and terrible deeds
Don't let them make the same mistakes again
It's their role
To take control

Beat the drum
Like an army
You've got the voice
So state your choice
Beat the drum
Beat it loudly
You have nothing to lose
Beat the drum
Go your own way
Just speak your mind
Don't follow blindly
Beat the drum
Beat it proudly
Every step of the way

Beat the drum
Like an army
Armed with your pride
You'll turn the tide
Beat the drum
Beat it loudly

Let them know where you stand
Beat the drum
Raise the standard
A coloured rag
Becomes your flag
Beat the drum
Beat it proudly
Cause the world's in your hand

Go on, beat the drum
Go on, beat the drum

Even though we know the score
There's always those who'd lead us into another war
Though we might hope this story's through
Beware of those who claim to know what's best for you
