[Verse #1]
When I see you, I see my own face
I want to save you from yourself

[Chorus]
What could I do?
What could I say?
It's a downward spiral

[Verse #2]
I don't know what causes sorrow
Or why it has to hurt to learn
But I have had a heart that's empty
I've felt the vacuum nature hates

[Chorus: Modified]
What could I do?
What could I say?
It's clear to me
I wish that you could only see it
Believe me

[Chorus]
What could I do?
What could I say?
It's a downward spiral

[Chorus: Modified]
What could I do?
What could I say?
It's clear to me
I wish that you could only see it
Believe me

[Chorus]
What could I do?
What could I say?
It's a downward spiral
