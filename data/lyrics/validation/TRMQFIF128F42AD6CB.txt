Don't say you're having fun
There's no fire in your sun
There's nothing here that is real

Nothing that I'd stay here for
Nothing I'd like to steal
And I'm sick of it all
I'm sick of it
Don't say you're heaven nigh
There's no stars in your sky

There's nothing here that is real
Well nothing that I'd stay here for
Nothing I'd like to steal
And I'm sick of it all
I'm sick of it

There's nothing here that is real
Nothing that I'd stay here for
Nothing I'd like to steal
And I'm sick of it all
I'm sick of it

Don't say you're having fun
(Don't say you're heaven nigh)
There's no fire in your sun
(There's no stars in your sky)

Sick of it
Sick of it all
Sick of it
Sick of it all
