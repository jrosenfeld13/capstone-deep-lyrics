Your only daughter's turning tricks, cause she's jonesing for a fix
She just blew your mechanic, that's when you will lose your wife
Overdose was a success, humiliation was too great
Now with your estate foreclosed, you will surely lose your head
Was in a bad place when you punched your supervisor in the throat
An inadvertent fatal blow, were the words your lawyer used
On the unsympathetic judge, who was having a bad day
So he threw your life away, is your faith a comfort still?
I know the answer, still I ask, where is your god now?

You thought it was the Christian thing to do, breaking up that fight at school
'Til the gun came into play, and the sight was set on you
Running was ironic cause it was the last time you would
Wish the kid you tried to help wouldn't laugh when he saw you
Are the invisible man, no one looks you in the eye
You've become an anecdote, for the wrong place at the wrong time
The worst case scenario, the proverbial "that guy"
You never did question your faith; you flushed it with your first piss bag
That's why I have to ask, where is your god now?

Where is your god, where is your god?
Where is your god, where is your god?
(Where is your god?)
Where is your god, where is your god?
(Where is your god?)
Where is your god, where is your god?
