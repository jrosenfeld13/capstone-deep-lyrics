Im weak its too late
Finger paint and i trace
The skies to break ova me
We get back to the place
Where you lick im screaming
Dream cry as i hear the voice ova again and again
Its so loud, im sleeping
My god mosses in vain
Im free YEAH!
The powderburns are always seeing
The powderburns the daylights dreaming
The powderburns the suns to bright here
Powderburns
The powderburns are always seeing
The powderburns the daylights dreaming
The powderburns the suns to bright here
Powderburns
Skin and bones underneath
Your nails as you preach
Can't you see im over him
Skin and bones underneath
Your nails as you preach
Can't you see im over him
The powderburns are always seeing
The powderburns the daylights dreaming
The powderburns the suns to bright here
Powderburns
The powderburns are always seeing
The powderburns the daylights dreaming
The powderburns the suns to bright here
Powderburns
Coz its under skies
