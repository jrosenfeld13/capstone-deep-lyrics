[Verse 1]
There's not a mean bone in my body
I never could be unkind
And I know we're not talkin'
But there's somethin' on my mind
It ain't rightteous indignation
I don't plan to rant or rave
No need for us, to fight and fuss
I just want to say

[Chorus]
Have a nice rest of your life without me
I'll be proud to be a part of your history
If it makes you happy, honey, keep talkin' bad about me
Have a nice rest of your life without me

[Verse 2]
I know you're not heartless
Not callous and you're not cruel
And I know you don't mean to
When you treat me like a fool
I believe that your good nature
Will emerge with someone else
If I can't be beside you
I can be beside myself

[Chorus]
Have a nice rest of your life without me
I'll be proud to be a part of your history
Well if it makes you happy, honey, keep talkin' bad about me
Have a nice rest of your life without me

[Outro]
Without me
Don't forget your pocketbook, honey
Oh, and your toothbrush... don't forget your toothbrush, dear
Have a nice rest of your life
Have a nice rest of your life
Have a nice rest of your life
