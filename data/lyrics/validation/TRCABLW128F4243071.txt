When almost anyone took you from me
I chased you down to say to you
When almost anyone can take you from me

What does that make me now?
What does that make me now?
What does that make me now?

And i know you better than i need to know anyone
Better than i did when it was for fun
When i digged you more than i
More than i ever dug anyone and yet

When almost anyone might look my way
I slowly turned and said to you
Your services here are no longer needed here today

What does that make me now?
What does that make me now?
What does that make me now?

And i know you better than i need to know anyone
Better than i did when it was for fun
When i digged you more than i
More than i ever dug anyone and yet

When i know you better than i need to know
More than i need to be
When i dig you more than i
More than i ever dug anyone and yet
A little bit more than i am willing to forget
