My heart, slow down
Oh won't you beat a little slower
But don't stop, no
Never end the hunting
The hours catch me
Naked and wondering what to do next
Hey cause there is so much time to kill
There's so many holes to fill with anything, something

Don't run
You see I'm lost without your rhythm
Don't run
You see I'm lost without your rhythm

My heart don't know
That even the fastest will get older
And the clock will count down the hours, the minutes, the seconds
The rush in my heart
Look under the bed for all those moments
But there are none, no
No there's nothing to paste or to paint over now

Don't run
You see I'm lost without your rhythm
Don't run
You see I'm lost without your rhythm

My heart believes that there's no reason
To increase that pulse into running horses
Don't make me slip and loose that feeling
Of a few seconds' immortality

My heart believes that there's no reason
To increase that pulse into runnin' horses
Don't make me slip and loose that feelin'
Of a few seconds' immortality

My heart believes that there's no reason
To increase that pulse into running horses
Don't make me slip and loose that feeling
Of a few seconds' , hey, immortality

My heart believes that there's no reason
To increase that pulse into running horses
Don't make me slip and loose that feeling
Of a few seconds', hey, sweet immortality

My heart believes that there's no reason
To increase that pulse into running horses
Don't make me slip and loose that feeling
Of a few seconds of sweet immortality

Don't run
Cause you see i'm lost without your rhythm
Don't run (don't run)
No, no, you see i'm lost without your rhythm
Don't run (don't run)
Cause you see i'm lost without your rhythm
Don't run (don't run)
Cause you see i'm lost without your rhythm
Don't run
Cause you see i'm lost without your rhythm
(don't run, you see i'm lost without your rhythm)
