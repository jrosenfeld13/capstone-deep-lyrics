I was paving all down on the summer to the ground
You know I need is someone to come around, I was so wrong, baby
I was so wrong, baby
Just in time my baby came to me saying "what you get is what you see"
And now she, she want have it only

No one can do what you do to me, honey
You're right on the money
No one can do what you do to me, honey
You're right on the money

I ain't rich, I got a fancy car but I've got your loving and my guitar
That's all I need, that's all I need
When you're doing what you doing to me
Well, the left bend's easier and I can see that's all I need
Baby you're all I need

No one can do what you do to me, honey
You're right on the money
No one can do what you do to me, honey
You're right on the money

No one can do what you do to me, honey
You're right on the money
You're right on the money
Yes, right on the money
Right on the money
Right on the money
Right on the money
