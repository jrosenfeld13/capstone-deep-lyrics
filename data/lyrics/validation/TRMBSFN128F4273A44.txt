Imagine the godlike devil
Representing the thesis
Repress, redress and reform
Still together uniform
A new order of things is born
Culminating in an antithesis
Wish for a moribund equanimity
Released from earthly emancipation

Vivit et non vivit [he lives and he lives not]
No truthfulness, no nothing
It could never spare your life anyway

Give me symbolical antidote, refresh the blood
Daemon impetus, aria of a silent dream
Time and being, rendez-vous the flood
History bears witness of doctrinal screams

Semigod; for all what it's worth
Values; no pity, no f**king liability
Demigod; heading towards north
Morals; always behold the ambiguity

Honour the siege by he
Who's going to judge the living
And the dead and the world by fire
Antagonism, join the precepts of violence

Presence of flesh, of all that I gave you
Rotten to the core
Would you ever ask for more?
Vivit et non vivit [he lives and he lives not]
With no human intervention
