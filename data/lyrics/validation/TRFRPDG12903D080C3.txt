(Hammerin' hammerin' hammerin')

Hammerin' hammerin'
Hammerin' hammerin'

Halleluhoodwink a hound's life is for me
Everything but the kitchen sink he built it just for me
Hallelu you're the thing that leads me to the mark
I'd build you a river but I'm still not through with this ark

Man built a furnace a Mercedes-Benz
Man built the cities of Kansas and Berlin
Man slew the bison and he built a Thieves' Road (oh oh oh oh)
That pass over Tel Aviv-Jaffa and lead to the Mother Lode
Mother Lode

Hallelu-half-a-wit a mule's life is for me
Steppin' off a parapet with a dog nippin' my knee
Hallelu you're the girl that whispers through the wall
I'd build you a hammer with a thick (thick thick) head and long claws

Man built an empire out of ocean and earth
Man built the prisons of Joliet San Quentin Leavenworth
And man built a market for Muhammad Ali (oh oh oh oh)
Evel Knievel and the legacy of John Wayne
Gacy Gacy

But I can't sing along (Bury my body girl)
But I can't sing along (Bury my oh)
But I can't sing along (Bury my body girl)
But I can't sing along
Sing along
Sing along

Hallelu hallelu
Hallelu hallelu
Hallelu hallelu hallelu hallelu

But I can't sing along (Bury my body girl)
But I can't sing along (Bury my oh)
But I can't sing along (Bury my body girl)
But I can't sing along
Sing along
Sing along

Man built a furnace a Mercedes-Benz
Man built the cities of Kansas and Berlin
