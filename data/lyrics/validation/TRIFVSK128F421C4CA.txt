Oh yeah oh yeah come on yall

(CHORUS)
Ou got me in your, I
Well I can't decide which way I'm stuck
Come'on
You got me (well) in your, I (power)
Well I can't decide which way I'm stuck
I've been here before, don't wanna be here no more
Don't wanna be here no more no no no
You got me like a blind man, You got me like a blind man!
I'm just feeling my way, doing the best I can, best I can
Your love don't come today, baby I can warantee that I'm not'gonna be

Girl you turn me on, turn me on...
