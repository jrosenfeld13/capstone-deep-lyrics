Hasty in a way
To forget a capital trade
To lead is to follow
As a run is to run
She keeps to the brakes
He prefers the atom in each space
And she would have told him
But she'd rather leave it up in the air
She appeals to the attitudes on his arm
As they fell through the altitudes store in a parking lot
He could no end
He ain't that tough
He know, he needed his help
Because your whole life
Crazy for their chase
All take it to some cannibals' luscious place
Your heart can in jungles, baby
But the jungle's changed
Crazy there's a pull
A magnetic pull grips their souls
And she's got to scar him
So they're gonna play it when they call
And you're leaving them here
You're leaving them there
You're wrecking a world without any care
And evil's all bent and askew
You're leaving them here
You're leaving them there
Did I have a feeling
There's something in the air
If you could see that she's falling, falling
You would put a stop to these games
Help yourself from the burdens, burdens
They are the wounded and strained
If you could see that she's falling, falling
You would put a stop to these games
Help yourself up the burdens, burdens
They are the wounded and strained
Dizzy from the fall
Dizzy from the fall
Dizzy
Keep on, he could no end
He ain't that tough
He know, he needed his help
Because your whole life
Keep on, he could no end
He ain't that tough
He know, he needed his help
Because your whole life
