Notorious they call me
From my blood stained savage hands
And now that I am king
I'll rule forth to take my stand

Blowing hard the winds of war
The gods have sent their love
Giving me the power
To destroy all those corrupt (Yeah)

I've got the power

By the hand of Caesar
I command you to obey
I'll slit your throat
And make ya choke on my royal name

The ones who came before me
I would not dare forsake
But they don't hold a candle
To the power of my strength

Carry my words I am the law
Never betray or you'll pay with your life

Notorious - Hail Caesar
It's a fight to the death
With every ounce of breath just for us
Notorious - Hail Caesar - Notorious

When evils pass and evils yet to come
A brother kills his brother
Who's killed his father
Who's killed his son

Notorious they call me
Just daggers in their hands
Dare defy and crucify
The ruler of this land

Breaking down the barriers
My blood will flow like wine
At the feet of treason
Crown the cursed who's next in line ?

Carry my words I'm the new law
Never betray or you'll pay
With your life

Notorious - Hail Caesar
It's a fight to the death
With every ounce of breath just for us
Notorious - Hail Caesar - Notorious - Hail Caesar
Notorious - Hail Caesar - Notorious
