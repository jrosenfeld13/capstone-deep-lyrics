[Verse 1]
Punishment for intolerance
So, entertain us when you're still able to perform
I'm sorry to admit that I won't be around
When the world you created will collapse and drown

And drown
Collapse and drown

[Verse 2]
Back to the crypt, nothing will last
We'll all fade away, in one single blast
Out from the dust, machines arise
One second left to live and we'll open our eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't find shelter, in this world
I'm searching for another world, where I'll feel safe

[Refrain]
Punishment for intolerance
So entertain us when you're still able to perform
I'm sorry to admit that I won't be around
When the world you created will collapse and drown
And drown

[Chorus]
I can't find shelter, in this world
I'm searching for another world, where I'll feel safe
I can't find shelter, in this world
I'm searching for another world, where I'll feel safe

[Chorus]
I can't find shelter, in this world
I'm searching for another world, where I'll feel safe
I can't find shelter, in this world
I'm searching for another world, where I'll feel safe

I can't find shelter, in this world
I'm searching for another world, where I'll feel safe
I can't find shelter, in this world
I'm searching for another world, where I'll feel safe
