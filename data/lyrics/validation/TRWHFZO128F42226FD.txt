From dawn to dusk I pound the earth, Looking for meaning to give live its worth
But what I love just tastes like shit, And I wonder how stupid can you get
The more I see the less I get, My life smoulders out like a cigarette
The more I need, the less I want, I want to live but I know I won't
Roses are red and violets are blue, Money is green and I hate you
Humans are humans but their blood is so red, I'm gonna put a bullet through my head

(Chorus)
{Hate edge, hate edge, I hate you, Hate edge, hate edge I hate you too. Hate Edge}

No one understands anything till its dead, Under the human lampshade they'll never shed
You'll never know what its like not to be shunned, I think you're all fucking scum
Watching dead bodies on the news, saw my friends burned up like jews
Spilt my soul for what it would bring, But now I hate everything
Ashes are ashes and dust is dust, Fuck each other with your power lust
Humans are humans but their blood is so red, I'm gonna put a bullet through my head

(Chorus)
