Mr. Love & Justice
Please, tell me what am I to do
Everything you told me
I found out none of it was true

I'm looking for some answers
To these problems I face
Desertion should mean disgrace
So tell me do I have a case

And I know that nothing is forever
But still though I want to make the effort
So he knows you just can't walk away

Mr. Love & Justice
I ask you, is it really fair
If all of that commitment
Just vanishes in the air?

Feel I'm on a one way ticket
To the end of the line
It won't stop the children crying
But I want some justice this time

I'm still waking up in the morning with a troubled mind
Can't believe he left me, how could I be so blind?
What else can I do but make this appeal to you
Is there any love or justice in the world today for me?

Mr. Love & Justice
If there's one thing that I must do
If only for my own sake
I've got to see this thing through

I've just got to find out
If I was right or I was wrong
Then I'll believe he's gone
Pick myself up and move on

'Cause I know nothing is forever
But still though I want to make the effort
So he knows you just can't walk away
