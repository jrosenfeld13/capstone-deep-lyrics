Honey, I don't know what to do
I do all the things that you tell me to
Don't know what it is I try to prove
I just wonder why you still need me

I've got a feeling that something's wrong
Did someone leave the iron on?
Something in here that don't belong
Now I wonder why you still need me
Why do you need me?

As a matter of fact
You've been turning your back
To the one that you're missing
And it's led me astray
Every step of the way
I don't know what it's for
But honey don't care no more
So leave it and close the door

You look so peaceful when you win
But I've got a feeling the fix is in
If you get the best of everything
Then I wonder why you still need me

Something is waiting in the wings
That's your excuse for everything
If you let it out but don't let it in
It's no wonder that you still need me

I don't know what it's for...

As a matter of fact
You've been turning your back
To the one that you're missing
I've been doing my best
Not to do like the rest
It's so hard not to follow you
In what you do
And where you're going to
