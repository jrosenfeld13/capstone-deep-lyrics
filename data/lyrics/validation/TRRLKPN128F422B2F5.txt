Music: Lynch

Awaiting for a shadow to draw near my bned
Shakin' off thoughts that keep my head
She's a blackbird that swallows
Ruler of my world
Woman full of deception
Stole my heart with just a word

So strange to me, but she sends shivers through my spine
So strange it seems, oh she might be evil
But she's mine, all mine

She's so evil but she's mine
She's so evil but she's mine
I'll say it again now

Oh, lady brings me sorrows
Loves to push my mind to edge
Edge of an endless sea, oh
Where the skies are black, she'll follows me
Her evil eye won't let me be
You know that little devil's love take care of me

So strange to me, but she sends shivers through my spine
So strange it seems, oh she might be evil
But she's mine, all mine

She's so evil but she's mine
She's so evil but she's mine
I'll say it again, now
She got a hold on me
A black bird in heat
Oh lady of my sorrows
