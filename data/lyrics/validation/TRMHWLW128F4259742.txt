I've got six things on my mind
You're no longer one of them
I've got six things on my mind
You're no longer one of them
I've got six things on my mind
You're no longer one of them
(Desire as a sylph figured creature who changes her mind)
I've got six things on my mind you're no longer one of them

[Verse 1]
They were the best times
The harvest years with jam to lace the bread

So goodness, goodness knows why I'd throw it to the birds

But there it is
And there we are
And all I ever want to be is far
From the eyes that ask me
In whose bed you're
Gonna be and
Is it true you
Only see
Desire as a sylph figured creature
Who changes her mind?
Desire as a sylph figured creature
Who changes her mind?

It's perfect as it stands, so why then crush it in your perfect hands?
(Desire as a sylph figured creature who changes her mind)
I've got six things on my mind you're no longer one of them
I've got six things on my mind you're no longer one of them

So tell me
You must have thought
It all out in advance
Or goodness
Goodness knows why you'd throw it to the birds
You mock the good things
You play the heart strings
Play them one by one

But there it is
And there we are
And all I ever want to be is far
From the eyes that ask me

In whose bed you
Gonna be and
Is it true you
Only see
Desire as a sylph figured creature
Who changes her mind?
It's perfect as it stands
So why then crush it in your perfect hands?
(Desire as a sylph figured creature
Who changes her mind)
In whose bed you
Gonna be and
Is it true you
Only see
Desire as a sylph figured creature
Who changes her mind?

I've got six things on my mind
You're no longer one of them
I've got six things on my mind
You're no longer one of them

It's perfect as it stands
So why then crush it in your perfect hands?
(Desire as a sylph figured creature
Who changes her mind)
Desire as a sylph figured creature
Who changes her mind

I've got six things on my mind
You're no longer one of them
(It's perfect as it stands
So why then crush it in your perfect hands?)
I've got six things on my mind
You're no longer one of them
I've got six things on my mind
You're no longer one of them
