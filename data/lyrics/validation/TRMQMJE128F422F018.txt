[Intro]
Smokey, smokey

[Verse 1]
Throughout my lifetimes, I'd hesitate
I'd feel some joy
But before I'd show my thanks
It became too late
But now all the way
I want to find the time and stop to say
I want to thank you Lord
For giving us each new day
And as I think back over so many years
Love that's filled my ears
I want to thank you Lord
For giving us pure smokey

[Chorus]
And anyone who hears that voice so free
He really got a hold on me
And I thank you Lord
For giving to us pure smokey, pure smokey
Smokey, pure smokey

[Verse 2]
Singing it so sweetly like no one else could do
Always trying something new
Well, I thank You Lord
For giving us pure smokey

[Chorus]
And anyone who hears, hears that voice so free
He really got a hold on me
And I thank you Lord
For giving to us pure smokey, smokey

[Outro]
Thank you Lord
