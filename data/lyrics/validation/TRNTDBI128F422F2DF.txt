Do you think you're the only one who hates?
The only one bound to humanistic restraints?
Well my belief doesn't make me a saint

Through these veins, blood still flows
So trust me when I say you're not alone
Just alone in your pity
At times, all I see is red
And all I want is bloodshed
I desire nothing more
Than feeding my thoughts what they crave for
I can feel evil too
But I refuse, I refuse to let what haunts my mind
Destroy the reason this creation was designed
Although my eyes are still set on the Divine
I am still a member of Mankind

Through these veins, blood still flows
So trust me when I say you're not alone
Just alone in your pity
At times, all I see is red
And all I want is bloodshed
I desire nothing more
Than feeding my thoughts what they crave for
I can feel evil too
But I refuse, I refuse to let what haunts my mind
Destroy the reason this creation was designed
Although my eyes are still set on the Divine
I am still a member of Mankind

I will not grovel at your ability to wallow your love
For sorrow I will not follow
