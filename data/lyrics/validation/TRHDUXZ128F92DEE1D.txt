[Verse 1]:
You know the kind of song that'll get you high
When the moon's so big it looks close enough to touch the sky
When the sun don't play and the moon won't shine, no little moon
I got a little thing that'll get you by for just a little while
When you turn it on it's gonna blow your mind
Head over heels you go
Look at you, look at you fly

[Chorus]:
Dance and sing
Swing, baby, swing
You my queen
Swinging like a demolition ball
Break them walls down
Go floating across the floor
And then you get to the end
You want to start at the beginning again

[Verse 2]:
I want to write a song that'll get you high
I want to find the words that'll make everything feel alright now
So in another world and another time, another lonely little moon
I'll be the kind of man that'll do you right, right by you
When you turn it on it's gonna blow your mind
Head over heels you go
Look at you, look at you fly

[Chorus]:
Dance and sing, you got it
Swing, baby, swing
You my queen
Swing like a demolition ball
Break them walls down
Dancing across the floor
When you get to the end
Gonna start at the beginning again

[Bridge]:
It's gonna blow my mind
Head over heels for you
Look at you, look at you fly

[Chorus]:
Dance and sing
Swing, baby, swing
You my queen
Swing like a demolition ball
You break those walls down
Go floating across the floor
And you get to the end
You want to want to start all over again
