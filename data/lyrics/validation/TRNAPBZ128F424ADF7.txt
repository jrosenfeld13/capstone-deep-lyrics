There's no need of you dogging me
Mama I ain't done nothing to you
There's no need of you dogging me
Mama I ain't done nothing to you
If you keep on dogging me
No telling what I'll do

You dog me in the morning
Mama you dog me late at night
You dog me in the morning
Mama you dog me late at night
If you keep on dogging daddy
I sure ain't going to
Treat you right
