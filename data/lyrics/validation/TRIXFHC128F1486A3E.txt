The black widow spider is deadly
And she has a strange, strange trait
She lures her victim in to her silken web and when
She has loved him she kills her own mate
The black widow slowly kills her mate

Like a black widow spider
You wove your web and then
You lured me in with lies and trapped me inside
And slowly, you closed me in
Like a black widow spider
You spun your web carefully
Each strand was designed with one thought in mind
To capture some poor fool like me
I didn't know I was the victim until
One day when I tried to escape
Then your steel web closed in
And trapped me within
And I'm caught here to wait for my fate
The black widow slowly kills her mate

The black widow spider is deadly
And she has a strange, strange trait
She lures her victim in to her silken web and when
She has loved him she kills her own mate
The black widow slowly kills her mate
