Grab your board and go sidewalk surfin' with me

Don't be afraid to try the newest sport around
It's catching on in every city and town
You can do the tricks the surfers do
Just try a Quasimodo or the Coffin too
Grab your board and go sidewalk surfin' with me

You'll probably wipeout when you first try to shoot the curve
Taking gas in a bush takes a lot of nerve
Those hopscotch poledads and pedestrians too will bug you
Shout "Cowabunga" now and skate right on through
Grab your board and go sidewalk surfin' with me

You can do the tricks the surfers do
Just try a Quasimodo or the Coffin too
Grab your board and go sidewalk surfin' with me

So get your girl and take her tandem down the street
Then she'll know you're an asphalt athlete
A downhill grade, man, will give you a kick
But if the sidewalk's cracked, you better pull out quick
Grab your board and go sidewalk surfin' with me
Skateboard with me, why don't you skateboard me?
Grab your board and go sidewalk surfin' with me
Skateboard with me, why don't you skateboard me?
