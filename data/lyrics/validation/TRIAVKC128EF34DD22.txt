Are you lonesome tonight
Do you miss me tonight
Are you sorry
We drifted apart

Does your memory stray
To a bright summer day
When I kissed you
And called you sweetheart

Do the chairs in your parlor
Seem empty and bare
Do you gaze at your doorstep
And picture me there

Is your heart filled with pain
Shall I come back again
Tell me dear
Are you lonesome tonight

"I wonder if you're lonesome tonight
You know someone said the the worlds a stage
And each must play a part
Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart
Act One was when we met, I loved you at first glance
You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came Act Two
You seemed to change, you acted strange
And why I've never known
Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than to go on living without you
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then they can bring the curtain down"

Is your heart filled with pain
Shall I come back again
Tell me dear
Are you lonesome tonight
