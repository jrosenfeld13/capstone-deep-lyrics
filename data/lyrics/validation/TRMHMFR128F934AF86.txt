I'll take away this selfish pride
Is there room for more than one inside?
Walk the course in shallow strides
A bridge connects, and space divides

How had I misjudged so badly
All the things you tried to hand me?
Ties of truth should bind us tightly
For tired wills die so gently

Wrong, so wrong
You and I
Long, so long
Living lies

Living, driving through indecision
Face to face, without recognition
Blind, we ignore this condition
Now I'm left with only division

Wrong, so wrong
You and I
Long, so long
Living lies

Breathe, one breath
And I find
A voice, one voice
And it's mine...

...And it speaks a heart-felt silence
