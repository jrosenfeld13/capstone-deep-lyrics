(I. Mills-D. Ellington-I. Gordon)
When you hear a song in blue
Like a flower crying for the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss
When you hear a song that grows
From my tender, sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss
Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy, nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Schubert tune with a Gershwin touch
Oh, how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
My prelude to a kiss
With nothing fancy, nothing much
A Schubert tune with a Gershwin touch
Oh, oh, how my love song gently gently
Gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never, never
Never, never dies
My prelude to a kiss
