Verse 1:
Float into the flame like a river boat gypsy

Gather 'round the river cause I'm gonna set you all free

Do what I'll say and you'll have all the power

Make the suckers dance and charge 'em by the hour

Chorus:
Stoppin the clocks when you do that thing
Now you're gonna shake for the mississippi king

Now you're gonna send
Now you're gonna send
Now you're gonna send for your medicine

Now you're gonna send
Now you're gonna send
Now you're gonna send for your medicine

Verse 2:
You were the queen of a second horse town

All of his buddies can't be rodeo clowns

Line 'em with sugar till the river runs bone dry

Servin' up the fantasies, unlimited supply

Chorus

Now you're gonna send
Now you're gonna send
Now you're gonna send for your medicine

Verse 3:
I know you've been bruised by losers lovers liars

Set the tables long baby labor lives no longer

Spend all your life and you'll wish it were flowers

Your camera's full of petals can't back up those hours

Chorus
