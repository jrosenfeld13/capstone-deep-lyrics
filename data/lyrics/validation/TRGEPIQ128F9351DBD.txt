There's a ghost in my house
The ghost of your memories
The ghost of the love you took from me

Where our love used to be
Only shadows from the past I see
Time can't seem to erase
The vision of your smiling face
Though you found someone new
I can't get over you
There's a ghost in my house
I can't hide (ghost in my house)
From the ghost of your love that's inside (ghost in my house)
It keeps on haunting me (ghost in my house)
Just keeps on remiding me (ghost in my house)

In my mind I know you're gone
But my heart keeps holding on
To the memories of those happy times
To the love that once was mine
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
There's a ghost in my house
I can't hide (ghost in my house)
From the ghost of your love that's inside (ghost in my house)
You're still such a part of me (ghost in my house)
Still so deep in the heart of me (ghost in my house)

I just keep hearing your footsteps on the stairs (ghost in my house)
When I know there's no-one there (ghost in my house)
Every day I love you more (ghost in my house)
So much more than the day before (ghost in my house)

Sittin' in my easy chair
I feel your fingers running through my hair
Lookin' down in my coffee cup
I think I see your face lookin' up
All alone in my gloom
You voice echoes through the room
There's a ghost in my house
And I can't hide (ghost in my house)
From the ghost of your love that's inside (ghost in my house)
It keeps on haunting me (ghost in my house)
Just keeps on reminding me (ghost in my house)

I just keep hearing your footsteps on the stairs (ghost in my house)
When I know there's no-one there (ghost in my house)
You're still such a part of me (ghost in my house)
Still so deep in the heart of me (ghost in my house)
I can't hide (ghost in my house)
From the ghost of your love that's inside (ghost in my house)
