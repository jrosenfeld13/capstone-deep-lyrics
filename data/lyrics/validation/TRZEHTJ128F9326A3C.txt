[Verse 1:]
There's the strangest excitement today
If you're awake then you're welcome to hear
I got a gift and it blew me away
From the far eastern sea straight to here
Oh God I feel like I'm in for it now
It's like the rush has gone straight to my brain
But my voice is as lonely as loud
As I whisper the joy of this pain

[Pre-Chorus:]
And suddenly
You've done it all
You've won me over
In no time at all

[Chorus:]
And now I'll stop the storm if it rains
I'll light a path far from here
I'll make your fear melt away
And the world we know disappear

[Verse 2:]
If you ask I will do what you say
All we have is this night to get through
With a twist of your smile your own way
You left me all up in arms and confused
Oh God I feel like I'm in for it now
And how this kiss will be wonderfully vain
I swear I'll melt if you touch me at all
But then I'll ask you to do it again and again

[Pre-Chorus:]
And suddenly
You've done it all
You've won me over
In no time at all

[Chorus:]
And now I'll stop the storm if it rains
I'll light a path far from here
I'll make your fear melt away
And the world we know disappear

I'll stop the storm if it rains
I'll light a path far from here
I'll make your fear melt away
And the world we know disappear

[Chorus:]
And now I'll stop the storm if it rains
I'll light a path far from here
I'll make your fear melt away
And the world we know disappear

I'll stop the storm if it rains
I'll light a path far from here
I'll make your fear melt away
And the world we know disappear

Make the world we know disappear
