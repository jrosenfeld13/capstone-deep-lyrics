Summer days are gone now
These ways I must not allow
To override where you reside
In front, behind, but still beside
The stars shine so much brighter when I'm with you
You put such a sparkle into my eye
Sing softly lullaby and warm me like the sun of July

Where can I draw my inspiration from?
Where can I find the means to motivate?
To get me out of bed, when I'm down, go ahead

Well I don't know why it's cold outside
But it's still warm in our hearts
Where else would we wanna start?
Well I don't know why it's cold outside
But it's still warm in our hearts
Where else would we wanna start?

Breathe your breath upon me
Please rain your smiles down on me
Blow through my hair, you're in the air
I sing this song in the form of a prayer
The stars shine so much brighter when I'm with you
Always and forever is how we'll be
Behind me is all the things I give up for your company
Where can I draw my inspiration from?
Where can I find the means to motivate?
To pick me up when I'm down, once again, go ahead
