It's getting pretty late
We spoke for just an hour and I don't feel that great
It's nothing that you said
It's just these pictures I don't wanna see
Keep running through my head
I know you never meant to, make me feel the way I do and
I never will desert you, but I cannot make you stay

No
So leave if you wanna leave
Change if you wanna change
Go where you wanna go
I won't follow
And love if you wanna love
Run if you wanna run
Go if you need to go
I won't follow you

I'm staring at the walls
Trying to convince myself that it is not my fault
But no one is to blame
Cause the fidelity of man is such a complicated game
The feelings of first love
They never really seem to last and
The spell that once drugged us has worn thin and
Soon will pass

So leave if you wanna leave
Change if you wanna change
Go where you wanna go
I won't follow
And love if you wanna love
Run if you wanna run
Go if you need to go
I won't follow you
No, you, no, you, you

And if you leave
Don't feel bad, time can't replace what we have
So don't regret
A single day
I'll always think of you when
All that's left is empty space
A void that I just can't escape
When nothing's left in me to take, no
Don't be scared I swear I'll make it

So leave if you wanna leave
Change if you wanna change
Go where you wanna go
I won't follow
And love if you wanna love
Run if you wanna run
Go if you need to go
I won't follow you
No
I said I won't follow you
No
I said I won't follow you
