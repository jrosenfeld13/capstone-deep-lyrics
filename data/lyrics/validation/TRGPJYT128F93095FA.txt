You know you burn inside
Feels like you won't survive
But you go on

Nothing can stop your pain
Over and over again
But you go on
You carry on

The people that are living everywhere
Are the people that got lost and didn't care
If you did that will always be around
You'll know it's the right time
Wind keeps coming down

I was a ship, a child
Trying to pretend your smile
But we went on

Attracted like moths to a flame
Over and over again
But you went on
You still carried on

The people that are living on their own
It somehow feels good to be alone
If you think that will always be around
You'll know it's the right time
Wind keeps coming down

When all is gone
When you're not that strong
When you're feeling wrong
Gotta carry on

The people that are living everywhere
Are the people that got lost and didn't care
If you did that will always be around
You'll know it's the right time
Rain keeps coming down

You know you burn inside
You know you burn inside
