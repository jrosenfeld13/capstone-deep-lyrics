I'm discontented with homes that are rented so I have invented my own
Darling this place is a lover's oasis where life's weary chase is unknown
Far from the cry of the city, where flowers pretty caress the streams
Cozy to hide in, to love side-by-side in. Don't let it abide in my dreams

Picture you upon my knee, just tea for two and two for tea
Just me for you and you for me, alone!
Nobody near us, to see us or hear us
No friends or relations on weekend vacations
We won't have it known, dear, that we have a telephone, dear
Day will break and you'll awake and start to bake
A sugar cake for me to take for all the boys to see
We will raise a family, a boy for you, a girl for me
Oh, can't you see how happy life would be?

You are revealing a plan so appealing I can't help but falling for you
Darling, I planned it; can't you understand it is yours to command it, so do
All of your schemes I'm admiring, they're worth desiring but can't you see
I'd like to wait there for some future date dear;
It won't be too late, dear, for me

Picture you upon my knee, just tea for two and two for tea
Just me for you and you for me, alone!
Nobody near us, to see us or hear us
No friends or relations on weekend vacations
We won't have it known, dear, that we have a telephone, dear
Day will break and you'll awake and start to bake
A sugar cake for me to take for all the boys to see
We will raise a family, a boy for you, a girl for me
Oh, can't you see how happy life would be?
