Honey remember me, I'm the one you brought home
Do you remember last night
It was a party, down on the block
Honey do you think that was right
Is it so easy for married women to hide their
Rings in their coat pocket
Take out a youth from some scene, and really
Think they really got it

Take it, eat it, put it in your pocket
Honey leave the rest of me behind
Take it, eat it, put it in your pocket
Handbag or something of that kind

Is that your old man on the dresser
Honey turn his face to the wall
I can't perform, perform in these conditions
Honey I can't perform at all
I can't believe that someone like you
Could really take someone like me
Can you believe in grandsons or grandchildren
Honey can this really be

You got no future

Is it so easy to take me to your country home
Is it so easy to leave
What do you think I do for a living
Honey won't you look at my sleeve
Hole is there it's poking right through
Elbows and even the bone
Don't you believe someone like me
Really has some kind of home

You like her a lot, you need some more
But then pour me a drink, and close that door
I'm dressed real sharp, sharp enough for you
I can see the place we're going to

No future
