[Intro]
In Napoli where love is king
When boy meets girl
Here's what they sing

[Chorus]
When the moon hits your eye
Like a big pizza pie, that's amore
When the world seems to shine
Like you've had too much wine, that's amore

[Bridge]
Bells will ring ting-a-ling-a-ling
Ting-a-ling-a-ling and you'll sing, "Vita bella"
Hearts will play tippy-tippy-tay
Tippy-tippy-tay like a gay tarantella

[Verse 1]
When the stars make you drool
Just like a pasta e fazul, that's amore
When you dance down the street
With a cloud at your feet, you're in love

[Verse 2]
When you walk in a dream
But you know, you're not dreaming signore
Scusami, but you see
Back in old Napoli, that's amore

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Bells will ring ting-a-ling-a-ling
Ting-a-ling-a-ling and you'll sing, "Vita bella"
Hearts will play tippy-tippy-tay
Tippy-tippy-tay like a gay tarantella
Lucky fella

[Verse 1 & 2]

[Outro]
That's amore
