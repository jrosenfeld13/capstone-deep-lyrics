[Verse 1]
One thing is for sure, I don't need it
Makes my life a war, what a bore
Don't you understand?
It wasn't even my plan
I guess you just can't see
What you do when you blame it all on me

[Chorus 1]
(White like that, I'm white like that)
It's all the same
(I'm white like that, white like that)
It's all the same

[Verse 2]
Said one thing and mean another, yeah
Who are you gonna lose?
Oh, who are you gonna choose?
What you think I'm gonna do?
What you thinking?

[Chorus 2]
(I'm white like that, white like that)
It's all the same thing
(I'm white like that, white like that)
It's all the same game

[Bridge 1]
Oh, who's gonna lose?
So who's gonna lose?
They call me white trash
They call me white trash

[Chorus 2]
(I'm white like that, white like that)
It's all the same
(I'm white like that, white like that)
It's all the same game

[Bridge 2]
So who's gonna lose?
So who's gonna lose?
So who's gonna lose?
So, so who's gonna lose?
Who's gonna lose?
