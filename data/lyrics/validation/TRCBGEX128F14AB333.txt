Babe, I want to make you understand
We have so many oceans to cross
Oh and girl, if you only reach for my hand
I will give you the dreams that you've lost

Even thought the cold winds may chill you heart
They could never tear it apart
If you just believe

Mountains may fall
Stars fade away
Rivers run dry, but love will survive
Tears may pour down
Hearts will collide
Passion may die, but love will survive

Babe, surely as the seasons change
And the sun will return to the sky
Oh girl, there will be an end to this pain
If you'll only be willing to try
Even when the rain falls
I will keep you warm
And there to shelter you from the storm
If you just believe

Mountains may fall
Stars fade away
Rivers run dry, but love will survive
Tears may pour down
Hearts will collide
Passion may die, but love will survive

Even though the cold wind may chill your heart
They could never tear it apart, if you just believe

Mountains may fall
Stars fade away
Rivers run dry, but love will survive
Tears may pour down
Hearts will collide
Passion may die, but love will survive

Through the longest night
And the deepest valley
Love will survive
Through the raging storm
And the test of time
Our love will survive
