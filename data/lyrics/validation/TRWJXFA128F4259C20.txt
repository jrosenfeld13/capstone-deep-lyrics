[Verse 1]
This house is full of ears
But I can't talk to anyone
They've heard this one a thousand times
Most exciting thing I do
Hang halfway out a third floor window
Maybe throw lit cigarettes down

[Chorus]
And maybe I'll catch fire
Something warm to hold me
Something pure to burn away the darkness
That hides inside my mind
All that evil shit's not hard to find
I guess I only claim to be nice

[Verse 2]
This house is full of eyes
But I can't look at anyone
They've seen this face a thousand times
Most relaxing thing I do
Hang halfway out a third floor window
And look at rocks, if I fall out...

[Chorus]
Well, maybe I'll fall hard
Something tough to break me
Something sharp to rip into my insides
And bleed out all that pain
Sorry, I don't even know your name
I guess for me, it's easy this way

Maybe I'll catch fire
Something warm to hold me
Something pure to burn away the darkness
That hides inside my mind
All that evil shit's not hard to find
I guess I only claim to be nice
