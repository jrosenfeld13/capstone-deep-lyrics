(scatting)

Crazy rhythm
Heres the doorway
Ill go my way
Youll go your way
Crazy rhythm
From now on
Were through

Here is where we have a showdown
Im too high hat
Youre too low down
Crazy rhythm
Heres goodbye to you

They say that when a high brow
Meets a low brow
Walking along Broadway
Soon the high brow he has no brow
Aint it a shame
And youre to blame

Whats the use of prohibition?
You produce the same condition
Crazy rhythm
Ive gone crazy too
