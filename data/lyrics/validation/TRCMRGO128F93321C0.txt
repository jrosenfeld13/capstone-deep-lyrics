Tribute

This rhythm is a mama

Hey I want to tell you a story
It's about the groove
All Right now look hope here
Hope it makes you move
And get's the rhythm too
Yeah oh yeah

Well there's music from the past
Music for the young and old
Music revelation rock and roll and soul

Ref:
Right on right on
Right on (repeat)

There was Little Richard ( Tutti Fruti)

And Elvis too (shook up, shook up, shook up)
Way back in the fifties ( way back, way back, way back)
There were doing it for me and you

Well I know there is way
With music we can say
These songs are in our blood
So let them play cos it's happening today

Ref:
Right on right on
Right on (repeat)

And we see it all so clear
The music while we are here
And we need it everyday
No doubt about it we can show the way

Talking about Sam cooke
Jackie Wilson was their names
Ever since then things ain't been the same
(ain't be the same)
Otis Redding God may rest his soul
Play back James Brown
How slides I don't know Bram

There's Motor City that gave us the motown tunes
They laid the foundation lord
And made Detroit some thing new
Yeahwe're talking about Marvin Gaye
(What's going on)
Little Stevie ( For once in my life)
Smokey ( Tears of a Clown)
Supremes ( Baby love)

Ref:
Right on right on
Right on (repeat)

Ike and Tina Right on right on
Aretha Franklin Right on right on
Jimmy Hendrix Right on right on
Sound of Philly The Jackson %
All these sounds are still alive
