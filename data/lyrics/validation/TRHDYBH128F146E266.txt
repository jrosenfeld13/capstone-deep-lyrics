It's easy to fall in love with a guy like you
Someone I know will be true
Someone I can put my trust in and never doubt
I couldn't live without your tender charm
Once I was in your arms
It's easy to fall in love with a guy like you
You make gray sky seem blue
Suddenly I realize how much I miss
'Cause with just one kiss
My hands start thrilling my heart 'cause I'm willing
Willing to love all the way
And I'll encounter what may
I'll follow you wherever you go
I want you so, don't make me wait
For another day, just take me in your arms
And baby, time has come, my love
Easy, you've put a smile on my face
Easy, even sadness can't erase
Easy, time seems to stand still
So easy, whenever you're near me
Easy, you're Heaven in disguise
So easy, you're so real
And that's why it's easy
To fall in love with a guy like you
You've touched me all the way through
You exposed the part of me
I didn't know existed and if I'm missing
There's music in the air, so glad you near
'Cause it's easy to fall in love with a guy like you
Someone I know will be true
Someone I can put my trust in and never doubt
I couldn't live without your tender charms
Once I was in your arms
It's easy, easy
