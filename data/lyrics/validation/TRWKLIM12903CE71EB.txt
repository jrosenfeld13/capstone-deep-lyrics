Now woman I do, woman God knows I do
Woman I do, woman God knows I do
I dos all for you that any poor man can do

I done did everything, woman but die for you
I done did everything, woman but die for you
Want you to tell me what more, woman, do you want me to do?

Woman, I done done, all I know to do
Woman, I done done, all I know to do
I done did everything woman, but lay down and die for you

Now if you don't want me, give me your right hand
Now if you don't want me, give me your right hand
I'll go to my woman, and you can go to your man

You better come here woman, sit down on my knee
You better come here woman, sit down on my knee
Oh and talk all night tell poor Timmy what you please

Want you to tell me something, give my mind some ease
Want you tell me something, give my mind some ease
I can't be satisfied, woman, and I can't be pleased

'Cause I'd rather be dead, buried on my face
'Cause I'd rather be dead, buried on my face
And to love you woman, you treat me this a way

But I don't want nobody, baby don't want me
I don't want nobody, baby don't want me
I'd rather be somewhere, friend, buried on my knee

I got something to tell you, tell you 'fore I go
I got something to tell you, tell you 'fore I go
Meet me down at the station, and kiss me 'fore I go

'Cause I'm going up the country, coming here no more
'Cause I'm going up the country, coming here no more
Oh I love you woman, but you always treat me so

If today the day, that you walked away
If today the day, that you walked away
Oh you told me you was, going, you was going to stay
