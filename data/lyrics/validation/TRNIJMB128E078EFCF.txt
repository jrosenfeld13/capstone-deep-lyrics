Ooh, she's out of my life
She's out of my life
Ooh
I don't know whether to laugh or cry
I don't know whether to live or die
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life

Ooh, she's out of my hands
She's out of my hands
To think for two years that she was here
And i took it for granted
I was so cavalier
Now the way that it stands
She's out of my hands

So i've learned that love is no possession
And i've learned that love won't wait
Now i've learned love need expression
But i've learned much too late

And she's out of my life
Out of my life
Damned indecision and cursed pride
Kept my love for her locked deep inside
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life
Ooh, she's out of my life
