The storytelling of ravens
The storytelling of ravens

Of the slither of snakes
And the pride of lions

And the convocation of eagles
The deceit of the lapwings

The ambush of tigers
And the screech of gulls

The choral of sparrows
And the quiver of cobras

And the pity of doves
And the host of angels

Storytelling
Storytelling of ravens

Storytelling, the story told of the unkindness of old

The watching of wolves
And the nest of vipers

A wake of buzzards
And the cry of hounds

The shimmer of hummingbirds
The wisdom of owls

A harry of hawk
Ascension of larks

The storytelling of ravens
The storytelling of ravens

The storytelling of ravens
The storytelling of ravens

The storytelling, the story told of the unkindness of old

The crash of rhinos
The siege of [?]

The radiance of robins
The hive of bees

The (de)livery of elephants
Of the earth of foxes

[?] of dragons
The unkindness of old
