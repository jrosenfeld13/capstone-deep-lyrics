You thought you'd conquered space
But now your reign is through
Dissect the human race
Until they conquer you
Fame is now mine
Even though it's illusion
Space and now time
Has just reached its conclusion
2000 years ago
My race created you
We turned you loose in space
Now a polluted zoo
Fate is no crime
I can face this illusion
Space and now time
Has just reached its conclusion
Light years are passing before me I'll soon begin
Carnivores roam the stars all in the place of men
Singular manifestation of time
And as your kingdom falls
I've taken after you
You may have wished this on me
And now you see it through
Your time is rolling over
My time is coming soon
I'll resurrect the ancient spores
Eclipse the Vargr moon
Matter warps space
So now time is illusion
How can I face this miraculous conclusion?
Light years are passing before me I'll soon begin
Right from the start I can see you're an alien
Singular manifestation of time
Your stories do amuse me
Although your eyes are vacant
I did not wish this on you
Your madness is quite blatant
Inside your mind I see the source of your hallucinations
Your body's wasted but your brain's on fire
The future still looks grim now
The human race is wasted
But soon you must turn over
The power you have tasted
In all your mercy I can see you are an ideal agent
To bring this curse upon the galaxy
Wait and see
Light years are passing before me I'll soon begin
Carnivores roam the stars all in the place of man
Infinite manifestation of time
