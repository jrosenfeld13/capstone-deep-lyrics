Here I stand
Where I planned
Given one more chance
Take it then
Start again
Time to join the dance
All I've seen
And all I've been
Led me here today
Forget the lies
The tears I've cried
I'm doing it a different way

I want a positive role model
I want a positive role model

Reinvention
My intention
How to make the change?
We're children then
Boys to men
It doesn't feel so strange
A broken heart
For a start
A new identity
Feel the love
Up above
Watching over me

I want a positive role model
I want a positive role model

My reflection on the street
Is that the way I walk?
Introspection as I speak
I need to change the way I talk
In a changing world
There's so much you could be
Why can't you choose your self
Like your enemy?
Have you ever imagined
A new you?
I could be someone else
The question is: who?

I want a positive role model
I want a positive role model
I want a positive role model
I want a positive role model

Give me hope
Give me all your love
Give me hope
