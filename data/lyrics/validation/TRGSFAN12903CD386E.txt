Bully me, with your glasses on
You think that I can't see through what's going on
You leave me here, to clean up your mess
You think you can come back here and I won't guess

Who's going down with you?
Who's coming on to you?
Who's using whom, well I wish I knew for sure

Wasn't I worth a bit more line?
You seem hell bent on running out on me this time
I hope she knows what a jerk you are
And what a fool I've been for going on down this road so far

Who's going down with you?
Who's coming on to you?
Who's using whom, well I wish I knew for sure

Why don't you hit me if you don't love me?
You can't hurt me anymore
Go on without me if you don't want me
But don't nail me to the floor
