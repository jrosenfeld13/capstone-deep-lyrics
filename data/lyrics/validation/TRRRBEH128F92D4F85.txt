I'm talking in my sleep
And every full moon light
I fight against my sin
And I just don't know why
I wonder, what it is
That makes me feel alright
Waiting for the one
Is going make my life
I try to stand back
'Cause in my dreams at night
I meet a pretty girl
Is going make my life
I'm trying to forget
The fact that its a dream
Saying to myself
That even dreams are real

That even dreams are real
That even dreams are real

Don't wake me up, don't let me go
'Cause all I need, and all I see is you
Don't wake me up, don't let me go
'Cause all i ever dream about is you
Don't wake me up, don't let me go
'Cause all i need & all i see is you

Don't wake me up, don't let me go
'Cause all I need, and all I see is you
Don't wake me up, don't let me go
'Cause all i ever dream about is you

All I need, and all I see is you
All I need, and all I see is you
And all I ever dream about is you
