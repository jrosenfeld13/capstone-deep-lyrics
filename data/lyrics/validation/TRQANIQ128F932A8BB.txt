This is the time
We make our choice
You have to beside
Between good and evil
We build or claim
To new world order
You can fight with us
Or choose your death
We have to feed
The rich and mighty
So we can use them
For our plans
We don't need the poor and helpless
We destroy what we don't need

And we fight for the human future
With bombs and rockets
No one can't stop us
And we fight for a better race
A nation of fighters
It's a new world

We have the money
We have the strength
We have the brain
We have the have the success
We build a nation
Full of power
Politics is on our side
We control the stated people
What they do
What they for us
We are better
Than ever before
A higher race
Is what we are
