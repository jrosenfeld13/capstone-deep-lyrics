Midnight star
Light the way
For thoughts that change
Like night to day-
And bless the course
That runs in time
No matter how for-
Shine my way

I've gotta need to be loved
Yes i want to be loved
I gotta need to be loved
Like anyone else

Bring the night
Go bring all your thunder
Nearer the light
Shine here amongst us
No matter the flight
Fill me with wonder

No matter how far-
Shine my way-

I've gotta need to be loved
You i want to be loved
