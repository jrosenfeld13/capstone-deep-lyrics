Be it true, you ain't got nothin' to do
I think I'm better than you. whee whoo
Be it true, you ain't got nothin' to do

Sun stroke, and it satisfies
He's the killer of retentative lies
Maybe i could carry on..
Let's not nothing a gallon flawed

Be it true you ain't got nothing to do
I think im better than you. whee whoo
Be it true, you ain't got nothin' to do

Sun stroke, but now satisfies
You know she tries, she tried and tried
Chutes and sorrows are over now
An opportune in a world of dreams

Be it true you ain't got nothing to do
I think im better than you. whee whoo
Be it true, you ain't got nothin' to do

Be it true you ain't got nothing to do
I think im better than you. whee whoo
Be it true, you ain't got nothin' to do

Be it true you ain't got nothing to do
I think im better than you
Be it true, you ain't.. got nothin'.. to do
Wheeww..
