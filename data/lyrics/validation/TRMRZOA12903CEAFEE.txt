This is the time to move
A creeping sense of suspicion but little to prove
A sense of distrust
A heart of darkness is imposing itself on us
This time I'm scared
Of what is near
This time we're scared
Of what may be near
Yeah, I can smell something in the air
I can see the red glow of their eyes
They say it can't happen here
But as the jungle swallows us
Morality becomes less clear
This time I'm scared
Of what is near
This time we're scared
Of what may be here
When the wolves run, we won't even see them come
When the wolves come, we will be overrun
When the wolves run, we won't even see them come
When the wolves come, we will be overrun
Again and again
Is history repeating again?
Again and again
A cycle that will not end
When the wolves run, we won't even see them come
When the wolves come, we will be overrun
It sure as hell can happen here
If vigilance is oushed aside with fear
I leave you with this one thought
And that is that they will come as you sleep
And if you see them running at you
Fight till the death
