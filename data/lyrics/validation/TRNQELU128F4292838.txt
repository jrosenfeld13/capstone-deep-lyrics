I put it out on a silver plate
And your thickens thick
I love to see you turn
From brown to pink

I love the taste of human waste
When it's on your face
So be polite to stop and stare
They wanna take your place

Pig pig
You're such a pig
A P-I-G pig
Pig pig
You're such a big
My special pig
Pig pig
You're such a pig
Covered in shit
Pig pig
You're such a pig
My beautiful pig

Come on baby
Come on girl
Come on baby
P-p-p-p-pig!

I see it runnin' all sticky and brown
Runnin' down your leg
I don't want to ask
I'd much rather beg

I love the taste of human waste
When it's in my mind
Some people think it's pretty sick
But I don't give a fuck

Pig pig
You're such a pig
A P-I-G pig
Pig pig
You're such a big
My special pig
Pig pig
You're such a pig
Covered in shit
Pig pig
You're such a pig
My beautiful pig

Come on baby
Come on girl
Come on baby
P-p-p-p-pig!
