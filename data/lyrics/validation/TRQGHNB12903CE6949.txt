Oh Billy come on, oh Billy come on oh
Cause I've heard your hundredth song
And though I liked the tale of the millionaires
That constructed the fine bolts and put the buildings in the air
Billy come on, oh Billy come on come and sing your hundredth song
Bring cautionary tales to reactionary table, ha-ha

Granted your songs have been living in this world
Have been eating in this world
Have been breathing in this world
Rain on, rain on
I find it unacceptable
I've made concessions to the world
To the running of the world
To the turning of the world
Can beneath me burn

Billy was a girl, but he couldn't tie his curls
But the proxis breaks, the angry bear
The lover in the wood lives on common care
Oh Billy come on oh Billy come on oh in the echoing morning calm
Oh try to find your breath and breathe the air
For the troupe of sellers and millionaires
Billy come on oh Billy come on oh like a population bursts from your songs
For the birdies and the babies and the downtown pushers, please Billy ha-ha

Granted your lungs have been sucking in this world
Have been breathing in this world
Have been lying in this world
Rain on rain on
I find it unacceptable that you keep singing to the world
And keep lying in the world
And keep crushing everybody's everybody all thinks about
Rain on rain on rain on
Keep ringing the wrong, the wrong, the wrong
Keep singing to the wrong, to the wrong, to the song singers
And rain fuckin' on and on and on
This set of millionaires
That burst the town and ripped the hair
The final fan of lies, dear
The final fare and sail
