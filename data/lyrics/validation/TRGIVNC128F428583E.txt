Along the road the places I pass are different
Ones I've never seen
I shut my eyes, they roll up in my mind
I see the same places, the ones I've always seen
Letting it all fly by
Sleeping, dreaming, getting a ride
The more I look, the less I find my way
The places I been I could never name

I'm riding around on ripples of sound
Get up, get off, get down

The pokey wagon rolling along
And my little life carrying on
Cities and trees and people who believe
So much, so much outside me

I'm riding around
Get down, hear the sound
Get up, get off, get down

A six-pack of beer and I have no fear
On my lap, in the back
Stereo blasting
That's that
Sing along as we zoom along up state
Up and down freewheeling tires squealing

I'm riding around
Get off, hear that sound
Get up, get off, get down
