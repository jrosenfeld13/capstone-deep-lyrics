You look so fine
When you passed me by this morning
And I would feel so proud
If you would just let me walk you
Across town

Hey pretty thing, won't you look my way
And let me know now
If there's the slightest chance
Of us making romance
Let me know now

I felt my heart kick a beat
The sunlight covered the street
If I can't love you tonight (3x)
Maybe tomorrow (3x)

I felt my heart kick a beat
The moonlight covered the street
The time was right, so I waited outside
For her to answer
Lord, the stars in the sky
They were all on my side in the twilight

I felt my heart kick a beat
And then she looked over at me
If I can't love you tonight (3x)
Maybe tomorrow (3x)
