Hey, there ain't a bit of truth
In anything that you've heard about her
She's good, she's sweet, she's kind
And she's mine

And when we're walking down the street
I feel so proud when she's with me
She's good, she's sweet, she's kind
And she's mine

Maybe she's changed her ways
From what they used to be
She gives me everything
'Cause she belongs to me. (Yes, she belongs to me, that girl belongs to me)

Hey there ain't another girl in this world
Who comes close to her
She's good, she's sweet, she's kind
And she's mine

Could it be she's changed her ways
From what they used to be
She gives me everything
'cause she belongs to me. (Yes, she belongs to me, that girl belongs to me)

Hey there ain't another girl in this whole, wide world
Who comes close to her
She's good, she's sweet, she's kind
And she's mine

She's good, she's sweet, she's kind
And she's mine

She's good, she's sweet, she's kind
She's all mine
