[Verse 1]
Life leaks from your fingertips, onto sparkling pavement
Having heard the news, you stumble, stuttering, confused
Helicopters line the sky
Marching men are rolling by
Babies in their baskets blankly stare through space, hey, hey

[Chorus]
Ever since I first saw you
Standing in the black frozen night
I've been blind
But I'm driving in the dark towards you
Not stopping 'til I catch the sunlight
In my eyes

[Verse 2]
Sirens sing over the streets
Chimpanzees are on TV
Everybody's working, waiting for the week to end

[Chorus]
Ever since I first saw you
Standing in the black frozen night
I've been blind
But I'm driving in the dark towards you
Not stopping 'til I catch the sunlight
In my eyes
And nothing's left to hide

Ever since I first saw you
Standing in the black frozen night
I've been blind
I'm running out of time

Ever since I first saw you
Standing in the black frozen night
I've been blind
But I'm driving in the dark towards you
Not stopping 'til I catch the sunlight
In my eyes
And nothing's left to hide
