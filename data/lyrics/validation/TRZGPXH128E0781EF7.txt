Oh what a shambles has been my day
I know I have to go to work but I wanna play
Well, I'm lookin' at my watch and it's almost half past three
And it's time for tea
And I don't want nobody tellin'
Trying to tell me
What I have to do and what I have to be

You know I just wanna have some fun
Yeah now, come on and have a party
Yeah, well, have some fun

Let me tell you now
All through the day the night's been on my mind
Now I've got myself together, baby, and you're lookin' fine, so fine
And I'm lookin' at my watch and it's almost half past eight
Now then don't be late
I don't want nobody tellin'
Telling me and you
Who we have to be or what we have to do

I know you've got some lovin', it's something we can share
We're gonna have a big night out, even if they say we ain't goin' nowhere

I see you walkin' to my car, lookin' like something sweet to eat
Girl, you're my brightest star
Come on now, let's get it. Let's get it

Everybody on the dance floor, everybody get up
Everybody keep movin', let's have some fun
