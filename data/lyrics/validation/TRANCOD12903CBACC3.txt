I've been alone now for so long
Afraid that love would turn out wrong
Playing games with my heart
I'd find love then I'd run

Please don't walk away from me tonight
I know we'll make it baby
Give me one more chance to make it right
Oh, baby, please don't walk away

I guess I've learned what I've been told
Love keeps the heart from growing old
And I'll be there this time
Our light will never die

Please don't walk away from me tonight
I know we'll make it baby
Give me one more chance to make it right
Oh, baby, please don't walk away

I cried and I worried afraid love would hurt me
I'm ready to open the door
Please listen to me 'cause this time it won't be like before

Please don't walk away from me tonight
I know we'll make it baby
Give me one more chance to make it right
Oh, baby, please don't walk away
