[Intro]
Do good my brother
And good will follow you
I know
I know
Hey

[Verse 1]
I will always do the good I can, war and hatred I can't
Stand
And I hope you feel the same way too
The goodness of your works will carry you through
Do good onto others and Jah will do the same for you
Give it a try, my friend, and you will prove what I'm saying is
True

[Chorus]
Love is the answer
There ain't no other
Oh oh, love is the answer
True love of the Father
If your neighbour come begging you something
Don't say, "Go, and come tomorrow", give it now, while you can
And I know I know Jah will bless you
Oh oh, love is the answer
There ain't no other

[Verse 2]
We must exercise our love by forgiving and helping
We should teach others what they need to learn forgive
Them even when our heart burns
Love I am feeling
Love: lifes' true meaning
Love I am feeling
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
Love is the answer
There ain't no other
Oh oh, love is the answer
True love of the Father
Love is the answer
There ain't no other
Oh oh, love is the answer
True love of the Father

[Interlude]
Love, how are you feeling?
Love: lifes' true meaning
Love: lifes' true meaning
Oh

[Verse 1]
I will always do the good I can, war and hatred I can't stand
And I hope you feel the same way with you
The goodness of your works will carry you through
Do good onto others and Jah will do the same for you
Do!
Give it a try, my friend, and you will prove what I'm saying is
True

[Outro]
Love is the answer
There ain't no other
Oh oh, love is the answer
True love of the father
Love is the answer
Love
Love is the answer
Jah Love!
Love is the answer
Got to believe me
Ooh ooh ooh
Love is the answer
Jah Love
Love is the answer
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Love is the answer
True love yeah, let Jah love, my friend, yeah
