[Intro: Buju Banton]
Love up di woman dem excess, I will comfort you and nothin' less
Reassure you and cure you, hear me nuh dawta
If your thirsty I man ready to give you water
Drink at my fountain, feel rejuvenated mon, love har again
Hear this now, girl child

[Chorus: Nadine Sutherland]
What I'm gonna do if you break my heart
Be unkind, you would a tear me apart?
What I'm gonna do, what I'm gonna do, baby ?
What I'm gonna do, what I'm gonna do?
With you I really wanna take a step
But if anything go happen, a mi a get left
What I'm gonna do, what I'm gonna do, baby?
What I'm gonna do, what I'm gonna do?

[Verse 1: Buju Banton]
Now, woman on the path of love we're about to embark
It's like this feeling tearing me apart
Girl, I promise to cherish you like the life I have
Never disrespected as there's a God
Baby girl, you can trust me know I'm for real
Never let insecurity stop the way you feel
I could never live without you girl and that's the real
No matter how rough it feel

[Chorus: Nadine Sutherland]
What I'm gonna do if you break my heart
Be unkind, you would a tear me apart?
What I'm gonna do, what I'm gonna do, baby?
What I'm gonna do, what I'm gonna do?
With you I really wanna take a step
But if anything go happen, a mi a get left
What I'm gonna do, what I'm gonna do, baby?
What I'm gonna do, what I'm gonna do?

[Verse 2: Buju Banton]
Could say a thousand words but three would be fine
I love you, girl, you are mine
As sure as the sun we must intertwine
Feel the beat of my heart I know it's genuine
To hurt you girl it's not an aim of mine
Keep givin' your lovin' to me all the time
Let me reassure you settle your mind
Discuss it at a later time

[Interlude: Nadine Sutherland (Buju Banton)]
(See Buju, see Buju, see Buju yah)
My love I'm feeling insecure
I know I can give you so much more
Feel so vulnerable my heart trembles
Cushion me when I fall

[Chorus: Nadine Sutherland]
What I'm gonna do if you break my heart
Be unkind, you would a tear me apart?
What I'm gonna do, what I'm gonna do, baby?
What I'm gonna do, what I'm gonna do?
With you I really wanna take a step
But if anything go happen, a mi a get left
What I'm gonna do, what I'm gonna do, baby?
What I'm gonna do, what I'm gonna do?

[Repeat Verse 1]

[Chorus: Nadine Sutherland]
What I'm gonna do if you break my heart
Be unkind, you would a tear me apart?
What I'm gonna do, what I'm gonna do, baby?
What I'm gonna do, what I'm gonna do?
With you I really wanna take a step
But if anything go happen, a mi a get left
What I'm gonna do, what I'm gonna do, baby?
What I'm gonna do, what I'm gonna do?

[Repeat Verse 2]
