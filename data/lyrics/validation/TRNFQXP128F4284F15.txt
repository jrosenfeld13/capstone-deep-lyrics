I think I've had enough
I think I might erupt
I'm looking for some information

It's digging in the skin
Whenever I begin
There's gonna be a complication

I take another breath
It's deeper than the rest
I'm swimming to the final breaker

It's sitting in my mouth
I wanna get it out
I wanna know when somethings on

But anyway
I just can't be myself today, apparently
But anyway
Cause nothing seems to come to me so easily
But anyway
Cause I mistake my memories for company
But what a day, I've gotta say
I can't believe in myself today

Sitting on the bed
Every finger spread
Looking for some motivation

If I can offend
I'll try to fit in
And I dont need an explanation

I think I'd better wake
I'm starting to deflate
I'm looking for some compensation

I'll never understand
I'll never be a man
When I don't know when something's on

But Anyway
I just can't be myself today, apparently
But Anyway
Cause nothing seems to come to me, not possibly
But anyway
Cause I mistake my symphony for suffering
But what a day, I've gotta say
I can't believe in myself this way

And I'll face it face down, the long way
And I'll face it face down, the long way

I think it's got an end
I think it's gonna bend
I think I gotta a new impression

So tell me how I look
Tell me what I took
To try to keep the conversation

I think I'll get it right
I'm fucking with the light
I'll turn it to the situation

I'm doing what I can
I'll never understand
When I don't see when something's on

But Anyway
I just can't be myself today, apparently
But Anyway
Cause nothing seems to come to me so happily
But anyway
Cause I mistake my memories for company
But what a day, I've gotta say
They're getting harder to seperate

But Anyway
I just can't be myself today, apparently
But Anyway
Cause nothing seems to come to me, not possibly
But anyway
Cause I mistake my symphony for suffering
But what a day, I've gotta say
I can't believe in myself today

I can't believe in myself today
I can't believe in myself today
I can't believe in myself today
I can't believe in myself today
