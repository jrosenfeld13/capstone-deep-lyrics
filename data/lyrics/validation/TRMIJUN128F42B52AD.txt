[Verse 1]
He has hurt you, that is true
Now he's gone and you feel blue
But I know you will survive girl
You can leave it all behind
I can help, I'll be there
I will take good care

[Chorus]
Sooner or later you're gonna be mine
Sooner or later a matter of time
Sooner or later you're losing defence
And the emotions that you hide
Straight to my heart they'll fly
Sooner or later

I will fight to set you free
Step by step and then you'll see
Time can heal a wounded heart girl
And we're gonna find a start
Just give in, let it go
Let your feelings flow

[Chorus]
Sooner or later you're gonna be mine
Sooner or later a matter of time
Sooner or later you're losing defence
And the emotions that you hide
Straight to my heart they'll fly
Sooner or later

Just give in, let it go
Let your feelings flow

Sooner or later you're gonna be mine
Sooner or later a matter of time
Sooner or later you're losing defence
And the emotions that you hide
Straight to my heart they'll fly
Sooner or later

Sooner or later you're gonna be mine
Sooner or later a matter of time
Sooner or later you're losing defence
And the emotions that you hide
Sooner or later you're gonna be mine
Sooner or later a matter of time
Sooner or later you're losing defence
And the emotions that you hide
Straight to my heart they'll fly
Sooner or later
Sooner or later you're gonna be mine
Sooner or later you're losing defence
