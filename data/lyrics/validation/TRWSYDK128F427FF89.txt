A little blond-haired boy, comes to mind
Though hes someone that I havent seen in a long, long time
He comes in late from his fishing-hole, he missed his supper and now its cold
Momma shakes a spoon as he walks by, but he sees a wink in her eye ey, ey, ey, eye
I do not ask why you look in your mirror, so why do you ask why I look in my past
The moon is sneaking up over my memorys trees, the bull-bats are skating through that evening breeze
An old cow is lowing for her baby somewhere, the windmill creeks as it chops the air
The dogs get kinda restless, trot off in the night and two rabbits brave the yard when theyre out of sight
The breeze speaks through the screen and says close your eyes, youre up to late for a boy your size ey, ize
I do not ask why you look in your mirror, so why do you ask me why I look in my past
You say that I dream my life away, and youre partly right and youre partly wrong
But what you cant see is where Ive gone, in my past
You say that I dream my life away, and youre partly right and youre partly wrong
But what you cant see is where Ive gone and what I own, in my past
