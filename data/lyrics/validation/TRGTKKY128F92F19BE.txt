Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Everything, everthing, everything gone be alright
Oh yeah

When I was a little girl
Only twelve years old
Couldn't do nothing to save my dog gone soul
My mama told me the day I was grown
She says "Sing the blues child, Sing it from now on"

I'm a woman, oh yeah
I'm a woman, I'm a ball of fire
I'm a woman, I can make love to a crocodile
I'm a woman, I can sing the blues
I'm a woman, I can change old to new

Spell w o uma n
Oh yeah

That means I'm grown
I'm a woman, I'm a rushing wind
I'm a woman, I can cut stone with a pin
I'm a woman, I'm a love maker
I'm a woman, you know I'm an earth shaker

I'm a woman, I'm a rushing wind
I'm a woman, I can cut stone with a pin
I'm a woman, I know my stuff
I'm a woman, I ain't never had enough

I'm going down yonder, behind the sun
I'm gonna do something for you, that ain't never been done
I'm gonna hold back the lightning, with the palm of my hand
Shake hands with the devil, make him crawl in the sand

I'm a woman, oh yeah
I'm a woman, I'm a ball of fire
I'm a woman, I can make love to a crcodile
I'm a woman, I'm a love maker
I'm a woman, you know I'm an earth shaker

Oh oh oh I'm a woman
