[Intro: Colt Ford]
Thank y'all, how y'all doin'
Yeah, my names Colt Ford
I just came here to do a little song for y'all
'Bout where I come from, the way I see it
I brought my buddy Mr. John Michael Montgomery with me
He's gonna play a lil' guitar and sing a lil' bit
I'm gonna do a lil sumthin' for y'all
Called ride through the country, let's go John

[Verse 1: Colt Ford]
Down the road where the black top ends
You can find Colt Ford with all his friends
We're used to gravel roads, and fishin' with cane poles
Wasn't no swimmin' pools, just swimmin' holes
We was dirt road poor, and cane switched raised
I done came a long way since back in the day
Been 'round the world twice seen all fifty states
Ate on thousand dollar china, but love some paper plates
There ain't nuthin' wrong with them big city lights
But me, I prefer them slow country nights
Where I can see the darkness come and then go
Most folks is honest, and they all speak slow
You can leave your door open, ain't nuttin'll happen
Most country folks sing, but I couldn't, so I'm rappin'
I wanna show y'all where I come from
And invite ya all down to any country town

[Chorus: John Michael Montgomery]
Now before I pack and things and leave
There's somethin' I need y'all to understand
I seen alotta things in my lifetime that's why I walk the line
I'm just a simple man
And I done done things for cheap thrills
But all my scars heal, so don't you ever cry for me
'Cause I ain't ashamed where I'm from
You always will come to take a ride through the country

[Verse 2: Colt Ford]
Up, dressed, and gone by 5 am
He's country, and he's rappin' we gots to play him
Folks been waitin' for some one like me
To give 'em some hot beats and spit that country
My jeans don't sag, they fit, and kinda tight
Got on a white t-shirt, no nothin' but work
Daylight 'til dark, that's how I was bred
And I'll keep bein' country 'til the day I'm dead
See, country folks eat biscuits called catheads
Barbeque, baked beans, sweet tea, and white bread
We like to fish and hunt, ain't scared of a fight
Love the good Lord and believe in doin' right
Got 4-wheel drives, some got mud on 'em
You can keep your Rolls Royce, 'cause baby, we don't want 'em!
So now y'all all know exactly who I am
And if you ain't into that, I don't give a damn!

[Chorus: John Michael Montgomery]
Now before I pack and things and leave
There's somethin' I need y'all to understand
I seen alotta things in my lifetime that's why I walk the line
I'm just a simple man
And I done done things for cheap thrills
But all my scars heal, so don't you ever cry for me
'Cause I ain't ashamed where I'm from
You always will come to take a ride through the country

[Verse 3: John Michael Montgomery]
You might see my on your TV, but honey
That don't mean a thing, you see
I'm still that same 'ol country boy, and that's all I'll ever be
And sometime, those bright lights blind me
And make it hard for me to see
But when I need to be reminded
I take a ride through the country
Yeah

[Verse 4: Colt Ford]
At about 5 o'clock on Friday afternoon
Them country boys head down to the local saloon
You're welcome to stop in and have a cold bottle
Big city boys and stuck up super models
We don't care where ya from, as long as you polite
'Cause push come to shove and every one of us will fight
We mostly easy like Sunday morning
Ol' Colt came here to give y'all fair warnin'
Country folks won't be pushed around
And there's some of us livin' in every town
We believe in the Bible, and the U.S.A
Work hard for what you want, it's the American way
No body owe you nothin' supposed to earn your keep
But in a hard days work, get a good nights sleep
I know some of y'all think ol' Colt's kinda odd
But I'm loud, proud and country by the grace of God

[Chorus: John Michael Montgomery]
Now before I pack and things and leave
There's somethin' I need y'all to understand
I seen alotta things in my lifetime that's why I walk the line
I'm just a simple man
And I done done things for cheap thrills
But all my scars heal, so don't you ever cry for me
'Cause I ain't ashamed where I'm from
You always will come to take a ride through the country
