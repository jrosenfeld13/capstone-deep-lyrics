A flat planet in the centre of the universe
Who punctured us?
Who thrust the needle into our flesh?
Geocentrism came crawling back - licking the needle marks -
"Copernicus was never right", and our world turned as
Introvert as our minds

Kepler, Copernicus & Galilei suffocating in the vacuum of
The microcosms
The inside can wait as long as we're preoccupied with
Shining the facade

We brought this upon ourselves - the connection breach
We cut the rope, we shut the power down
The line does not reach out any more
Diagonal traded for horizontal - there is no up and down
Gathered, trapped, closed into a linear thought

Kepler, Copernicus & Galilei suffocating in the vacuum of
The microcosms
The inside can wait as long as we're preoccupied with
Shining the facade

Somehow we lost the ancient connection
All perspective eaten by newborn abilities
Entangled no more? - Simplicity the order of absent
Relations
Complexity a distant relative or a strange rumour

Reflective surfaces mirroring skin, cores diminish slowly
And silently
Nourishment torn away, light dimmed to the unrecognizable
Show us your universe and we'll give you our world - we do
Not recognize it anyway!
