Silence slowly comes to me...
Embraces me so tight to keep me cold...
A thought that's drifting through my mind...
Struggles to be free and wails alone...

Embraces me... So tight...
Struggles to... Be free...

We turn to stone!
We don't find home!

Can you hear this broken whisper?
Can you hear it how it calls?
We turn to stone!
We don't find home!
