VERSE 1
GUILTY
ARE THE FEELINGS THAT YOU AND I SHARE INSIDE
THOUGH WE BOTH LOVE SOMEBODY ELSE WE CANNOT HIDE
THIS LOVE THIS PASSION THIS PAIN AND THIS PRIDE
UNFAITHFUL
EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW WHAT WE DO IS SO WRONG
THIS LOVE WE HIDE INSIDE IT IS SO STRONG
WE KEEP ON LETTING GO AND HOLDING ON

CHORUS
HOW LONG CAN WE KEEP GOING
WITHOUT THIS LOVE FROM SHOWING
AND EVERYBODY KNOWING
WE'VE GOT SO MUCH TO LOSE
BUT SOMEDAY WE MUST CHOOSE

IT'S NOT THAT WE'RE UNHAPPY
WE LOVE OUR LOVERS DEARLY
COULD SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL ME
IF THIS LOVE IS SO WRONG
WHY DOES IT FEEL SO STRONG

WHY IS LOVE THE CRIME OF THE CENTURY
SO MANY OF US HERE ARE GUILTY
THOSE WITHOUT SIN CAST YOUR STONE ON ME
WHY IS LOVE THE CRIME OF THE CENTURY

VERSE 2
HAPPY
IN BOTH OF OUR RELATIONSHIPS AT HOME
I CAN TELL WHEN I CREEP AND CALL YOU ON THE PHONE
AND HEAR YOU SOFTLY SPEAK AND SOFTLY MOAN
NONSENSE
YOU CAN'T LOVE TWO PEOPLE AT THE SAME TIME
ARE WE THE ONLY ONES GUILTY OF THIS CRIME?
LOOK AND YOU'LL BE SURPRISED AT WHAT YOU FIND

CHORUS

BRIDGE
NO MATTER HOW WE TRY WE CAN'T LET THIS THING GO
SO UNTIL THEY FIND OUT WE'LL KEEP IT ON THE LOW

WHY IS LOVE THE CRIME OF THE CENTURY
SO MANY OF US HERE ARE GUILTY
THOSE WITHOUT SIN CAST YOUR STONE ON ME
WHY IS LOVE THE CRIME OF THE CENTURY
