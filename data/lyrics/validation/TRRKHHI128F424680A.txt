Again we're on the line
And this time i feel the day is not mine
Touch gently on the surface
Or crash like hell
I won't be sacrificed

I let the hours wear my heart
I leave the others to impale nightly moon
And when I hear the call crying loud
I just turn and turn and run away

Impleasant all the way
Still a form of life tradition yet remains
And when its starts to rain
I seek for shelter and blow my storm away

I let the hours wear my heart
I leave the others to impale nightly moon
And when I hear the call crying loud
I just turn and turn and run away
