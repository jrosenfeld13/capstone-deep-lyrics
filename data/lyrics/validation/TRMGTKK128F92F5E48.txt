Full speed ahead now, we're never lookin' back
Turn up your radio, and the music will attack
Just like a dinosaur, get out of the way
You've got the guts and energy to blow them all away
Turn it up, supersonic sound
Drive it up, rock it on the ground
Get out everyday, you ain't just havin' fun
It's something you believe in, you wanna hit the sun

Autoblast
Don't look back
Autoblast
Loud and fast

Out on the highway, middle of the night
You're like a bullet with the pressure to ignite
Your radio is sending signals to your brain
This ain't no child's play, no, it's not a game
Turn it up, pound into the night
Drive it up, past the speed of light
You've got everything at your fingertips
It's something you believe in, the world is in your grip

Autoblast
Don't look back
Autoblast
Loud and fast

It's alright, man and his machines
'Cause he knows where he's goin'
People sometimes do believe
This world is turnin' just for you

Whoo!
Alright, c'mon!

Autoblast
Don't look back
Autoblast
Loud and fast
