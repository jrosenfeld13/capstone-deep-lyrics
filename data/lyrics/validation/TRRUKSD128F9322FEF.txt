[Verse 1: Jill Scott]
So many times you tried to cut we
You wanna tear we down but you
Can't touch we
We ain't invincible
But Lord knows we're beautiful and
Blessed
Check the affirmative
(oh yes)

[Chorus]
Brotha don't let nobody hold you
Back no no no
Don't let nobody
Hold ya, control ya or mold ya
Brotha don't let nobody hold you back

Am I my brother's keeper?
Yes I am!

[Verse 2: Jill Scott]
So many times you tried to burn we
You wanna break we down
(Use and discard)
We ain't invincible
But Lord knows we are magnificent
And blessed
Check the affirmative

[Chorus]
Brotha don't let nobody hold you
Back no no no
Don't let nobody hold you never no
Brotha don't let nobody hold you back
Don't let nobody
Hold you never no
Brotha don't let nobody hold you back no no no

[Bridge]
If nobody told ya brotha, I'm here
To let you know that
You're so wonderful
You're so marvelous
You're so beautiful
You're splendid
You're fabulous
Brilliantly blessed in every way
Ya'll can't touch we

Brotha don't let nobody hold you back
