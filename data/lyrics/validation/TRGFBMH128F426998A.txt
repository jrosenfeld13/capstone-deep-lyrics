[Verse 1]
Your tender smile gives me happy thoughts of you
You got me so close to my dreams now they have to come true
Ooh baby, nothing to be shy about
Nothing we have to lie about
Hope loving you don't confuse you
Ooh baby baby, i don't wanna lose you
And when we touch our hearts move at a steady pace
I'm trying hard not to show the blushing over my face
Ooh yeah yeah, you bring out the woman in me
What can i see that you can't see?
I like the way we carry on
Hope you understand my feelings got me just a reeling

[Chorus]
What can i do, with this feeling?
Hooked on your love, sweet love, love
What can i do with this sweet feeling?
Hooked on your love, sweet love, love, ooh
What can i do, with this feeling?
Hooked on your love, sweet love, love

[Verse 2]
Your eyes within me, they send me just a staring me down
I'm so turned on in time and child, i got to move around
Ooh yes i do, over and over you astound me
I take pleasure to have you around me
My loving arms would love to squeeze you
Ooh baby take it, i don't want to tease you

[Chorus]
What can i do with this feeling?
Hooked on your love sweet love love
What can i do?
What can i do, with this feeling?
Hooked on your love sweet love love
What can i do, with this feeling?
Hooked on your love, sweet love, love

[Verse 2]
Nothing to be shy about
Nothing we have to lie about
Hope loving you don't confuse you
Hope you understand these feelings me got me just a reeling

[Chorus]
What can i do with this feeling?
Hooked on your love sweet love, love
Oh what can i do with this feeling?
Hooked on your love sweet love love
What can i do, with this feeling?
Hooked on your love, sweet love, love [x5]
