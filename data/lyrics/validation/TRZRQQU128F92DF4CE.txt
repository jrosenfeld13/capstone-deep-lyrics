I want to be remembered as "one of a kind"
Unique and why not "out of her mind"
I want to be special, unpredictable and absurd
I want to tell people the most aberrant things they've heard

I want to have an eye-catching, distinctive look
I want to have all the loonies on the hook
I want to do everything without moderation
Without a single thought or consideration

Cause i, you, them
What wouldn't we do to be
Irreplaceable?

None of my partners introduced me their folks
Afraid that i might pull off some awkward jokes
And once we've split up they would always say
That i'm not a girl to marry anyway

Cause i like to complain and i love to start fights
I always leave out the milk and never turn off the lights
I don't change the bin bag event though it's packed
I just jam in the trash until the bag is cracked

Cause i, you, them
What wouldn't we do to be
Irreplaceable?
