You hit me just like a train wreck
Got me looking in the mirror
You fit me 'cause we were both bent
You know it's easier to see from here

But I was wrong to let you go
But I just had to let you know that

(Chorus)
I've got my heart strapped to my sleeve
I've got my sleeve tucked in my jeans
I've got my jeans stuffed in my boots
I've got my boots walking back to you

Only time is gonna tell the truth
You know it's the only way to go
And in my mind I am bulletproof
There's only one way to know

I was wrong to let you go
But I just had to let you know that

(Chorus)
Everybody says take your time
No reason now you have to walk that line
I'd listen but my heart says wrong
These boots are already long gone

(Chorus x2)
