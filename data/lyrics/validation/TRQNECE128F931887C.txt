Count the pictures
On the walls

This place, was it always
So empty
Was everything the way
I remember

Your image is dull and blurred
By the rust of time again
An era has come and gone
And everything that belongs
Exists no more

The air i'm breathing
It is changing

One would think
Memories are living
But behind these pictures
Lies nothing
Nothing at all
