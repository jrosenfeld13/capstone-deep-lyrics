[Verse 1]
Lord, I miss the highway, running against the wind
Blessed are the stoned and all the places they've been
Shadow of a man at home, beating a dead horse
Home too long, cross to bear
Methods of the past mold the future
You can't fall short as you get older
Being run aground is being trapped
Seized up... Kept

[Pre-Chorus]
Wear the chains you forged in life
Link, by link by link
Wear the chains you forged in life
Link, by link by link

[Chorus]
I've been sober 13 days and 7 nights
I know next time I'll get it right
You tried to make me stay, I said, "No way"
Grabbed my bag and hit the highway

[Verse 2]
Echoes in the dark, new faces bring the sun
Comfort the disturbed, always think the worst
You live and die by your own decisions
You live and die by your own religion
Being run aground is being trapped
Seized up... Kept

[Pre-Chorus]
Wear the chains you forged in life
Link, by link by link
Wear the chains you forged in life
Link, by link by link

[Chorus]
I've been sober 13 days and 7 nights
I know next time I'll get it right
You tried to make me stay, I said, "No way"
Grabbed my bag and hit the highway

I've been sober 13 days and 7 nights
I know next time I'll get it right
You tried to make me stay, I said, "No way"
Grabbed my bag and hit the highway

[Solo]

[Outro]
Sobriety suits you so well
It suits you so well, it suits you so well
It suits you so well, it suits you so well
So well

(It suits you so well, it suits you so well)
(It suits you so well, it suits you so well)
(It suits you so well, it suits you so well)
(It suits you so well, it suits you so well)
