It's all right, we're gonna be fine
But let's give my mama and my daddy a little time
'Cause I've been good up 'till now
They see you and they think that I have changed somehow
But I'm not being radical when I kiss you
I don't love you to make a point
It's the hollow of my heart that cries when I miss you
And it keeps me alive when we're apart
We go downtown, some people they stare
But there are lots of people who really don't care
I just want to hold your hand
I don't feel like making some big stand
'Cause I'm not being radical when I kiss you
I don't love you to make a point
It's the hollow of my heart that cries when I miss you
And it keeps me alive when we're apart
It's all right, we're gonna be fine
Even if this world is taking so much time
And though I mind what people say
Love is stronger than any words anyway
And I'm not radical when I kiss you
I don't love you to make a point
It's the hollow of my heart that cries when I miss you
And it keeps me alive when we're apart
