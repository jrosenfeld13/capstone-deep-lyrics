Amanda the actress
Waits at the station
She's drifting with nothin' to do
With dilettante steps
She's quick to accept
The weather in times turning screw
She lives in a tower
Armed with defences
She learned from her mother and friends
She walks like a Pharaoh
Dresses in day-glo
When she's in pain she pretends

('Cause) late in the night
When the lights are all out
She slips off her stockings and shoes
She makes you her lover
And lets you discover
The smile she keeps
She keeps for you

She keeps no
She keeps no
She keeps no secrets from you

She keeps no
She keeps no
She keeps no secrets from you

She keeps no
She keeps no
She keeps no secrets from you

Facing the morning
Wearing her shadow
She throws her dice
And I-Ching
Success in Japan
A rescuing man
Knows she won't change anything

('Cause) late in the night
When the lights are all out
She slips off her stockings and shoes
She makes you her lover
And lets you discover
The smile she keeps
She keeps for you

She keeps no
She keeps no
She keeps no secrets from you

She keeps no
She keeps no
She keeps no secrets from you

She keeps no
She keeps no
She keeps no secrets from you

She don't keep no secrets

Whoah, late in the night
When the lights are all out
She slips off her stockings and shoes
She makes you her lover
And lets you discover
The smile she keeps
She keeps for you

She keeps no
She keeps no
She keeps no secrets from you

She keeps no
She keeps no
She keeps no secrets from you

She keeps no
She keeps no
She keeps no secrets from you

She keeps no
She keeps no
She keeps no secrets from you

She keeps no
She keeps no
She keeps no secrets from you

She keeps no
She keeps no
She keeps no secrets from you
