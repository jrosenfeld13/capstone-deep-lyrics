Loss leader, losing sight of the shore
Can't take this loss loop anymore, anymore
Water - running down
Water - running down

Now things taste kind of bitter
Two muddy shoes, far from home, far from home
Water - running down
Water - running down - RUNNING DOWN

And as I walk back
I feel the moon against my neck

Loss leader, losing sight of the shore
Can't take this lost loop anymore
