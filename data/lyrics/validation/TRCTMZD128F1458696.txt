Boys From Brazil
Champagne
Desert Shore
Celebrate
Memorize
Associate lips with the poor
Eyes of the world on you
Boys From Brazil

Desert Shore

What can you say
About anything lost now
What can you say
About stolen things too
Anything Stolen
Something is lost now
What can you say
And how fast can things move

Boys from Brazil
Fortune of bird in flight
Tycoons and whirlwind
Brings a hush on lover's voice
Eyes of the world on you

Boys from Brazil
Champagne
Desert shore

Babies cannot manage
Lust and Ambition
Babies only speak and ingenious talk
Badies don't remember
Chance or up in shame
Badies cannot manage crocodiles

Boys from Brazil
Gentleman and adventure
Killing Hearts and gentle life
Spending money in capitals
Eyes of the world on you

Not just the boy that's crying wolf now
Someone else is screaming up at our door
Not just a body that's crying wolf now
Eyes of the world on you

Taking tracks back
Slip a while back
In forward moves
Boys taking tracks back
Slip a while
Forward moves forward moves
Slip a while
