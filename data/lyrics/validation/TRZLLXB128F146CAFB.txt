It's a sign of devotion
You made everybody else seem insane
You filled my head with your notions
You made everybody else seem so tame
In your bed I lay reeling
You made everybody else seem a shame
I knew from the way I was feeling
Nothing could ever be quite the same

I moved straight into your shoes
I took up your cause and answered your phone
I couldn't really imagine
What life was like when I was alone
Then I started to worry (then I started to worry)
I thought of our lives left on the shelf
Too much TV and curry
Too much time spent on ourselves

We were sitting in, waiting
And I told you my plan
You were far too busy writing
Rhymes that didn't scan
And you leant me your records
And I leant you an ear
Funny how it seems to me now
That you were never here
Never really here

In our bed I lay reeling
You made everybody else seem a shame
I knew from the way I was feeling
Nothing could ever be quite the same
It's a sign of devotion
You made everybody else seem so plain
Then it felt like going through the motions
First impressions never remain

We were sitting in, waiting
And you told me your plan
I was far too busy writing
Rhymes that'll never scan
Now I've sold all your records
Cause they give me the fear
Funny how it seems to me now
That you were never here
Never really here
Never really here
