You don't need to be afraid those hesitations of the past
Your best selling paperback, the ugly duckling has the last laugh
Everybody's got a fighting chance
Cos I've spent years looking back
Got me nowhere got me nowhere
While the wind caught your hair
Yes the wind caught your hair
Do do do do do do....
Darling no more empty words
They're just hurtful and misleading
Can't you see that?
Darling no more empty words, they're just hurtful and misleaiding
Can't you see that?
So you threw it all away
But you're worth the whole damn lot of them
But this morning something changed
I saw my life stretched over plains
And everybody had a fighting chance
While I spent years looking back
Got me nowhere got me nowhere
While the wind caught your hair, yes the wind caught your hair
Do do do do do do do do do do do do
Darling no more empty words
They're just hurtful and misleading
Can't you see that?
Darling no more empty words
They're just hurtful and misleading
Can't you see that?
Do do do do....
Someday I'll rise up again and try to make something in my life
It's not too late
Darling no more empty words
They're just hurtful and misleading
Can't you see that?
