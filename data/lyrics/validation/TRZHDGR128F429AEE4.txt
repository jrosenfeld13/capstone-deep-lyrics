From day one, something was wrong
I thought I could see you through it
Thought you would change, but i was wrong
And now i stand here screaming
Too many papers wasted on someone who never gave a damn
I've got better things to do than waste these words on you
I have better things to say
Too much time i've spent on you
This is the last song i write about you
A couple songs, so what?
Cause what has been gained?
This is that last song i write about you
Time to move on
I've held your hand for far too long now
Beating all these thoughts of you to death tonight
Dead
