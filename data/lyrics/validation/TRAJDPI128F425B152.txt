Pressure on me
Can't get out
Situation it's a melt down
Nine to fiving, want to shout
New direction, got to get to high ground

I've got to get back to the floor
Just grab my keys and pop the door

Going to give it up
Get on down
Little by little going to turn it around...

Wash the week out
Of my mind
Slap my face on
Now i feel sublime
Put some sounds on
To unwind
Caught the moment
Just about the right time

I've got to get back to the floor
Just grab my keys and pop the door.. yea
Going to give it up
Get on down
Little by little...

Make my heart sing like a wild thing
Yea yea yea

Give it up....
