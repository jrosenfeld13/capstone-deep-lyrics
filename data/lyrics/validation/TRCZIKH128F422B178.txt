Mom said, "no," I said, "why?"
She told me not to cry
Tears came down, I said, "please"
She told me to get off my knees

I said, "I had to," She said, "Oh"
I said, "I need to," She said, "So."
I said, "Try to sympathize."
She said, "No," to no surprise

I said, "later?" She said, "No."
I said I'd run away, she said, "Go."
I said, "maybe?", Then I asked again
She was silent, so I said, "When?"

She said I was just a pest
So I called Daddy and he said, "yes."
