[Intro]
Girls.. all fruits ripe
Unuh a gwan good
I waan yuh jus truss mi
Hear whyme holla!

[Hook]
Gal yuh see yuh battyrider, murder!
You must fi want the DeeJay charge for, (ah dead!)
Woman yuh see yuh battyrider, murda
Yuh mus fi waan di DJ charge fa

[Verse1]
Shorts hitch up pon your saddle, ride up pon your back
Exposing your property, man ah say it fat
Merchandise ever there there never run out of stock
Full of shape like a coke bottle without the top
Things ah gwaan fi your body, trust me 'pon that
All fruits ripe, so mek them gwaan chat
What them ah do? What them ah try? Who dem ah try stop?
From battyrider ah wear girl haffi inna that, so me say

[Verse2]
It can't, hold in a bucket, can't hold in a pan
My Idren Wayne Wonder want a fraction
The Dee Jay want fi know, ah where she get it from
Battyrider the gal ah use, ah no mad man
Without the battyrider, Jacqueline nah go out
If the face nah say one, the body fi ah shack out
So she ah go check ah jus make ah later down ah south
Want come ah dance, they come more come shack out

[Verse3]
Nuff gal inna batty shorts, feel say them hot
But them flop! Cause under their batty draw blank
So yuh fi, banner di lola and deal with the case
Go do bogle dance, an mek up yuh face
An make your mate know your have a slice of the cake
Cause your battyrider, it ah mash up the place
