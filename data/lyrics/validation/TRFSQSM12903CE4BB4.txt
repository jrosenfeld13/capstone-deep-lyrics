Ooh, yeah

Cobblestones, quaint little homes
Shutters locked, sirens drone
And, over at the factory, workers on the dole
Nothing to take heart in now
It's begun to take its toll
Begun to take its toll

I saw Babylon slowly start to burn
Heard the voices crying, refusing ever to learn
Ooh, Babylon

The glory of it all: God become a man, the pure and holy lover
You betrayed him with a kiss, murdered your own brother

Sometimes it flowed like a magic
The pleasure hid the flaw
But, oh, forever tragic: him you never saw
I saw the heavens shake, saw the city fade
Shattered in one hour
Time to build again
Babylon, Babylon is fallen
