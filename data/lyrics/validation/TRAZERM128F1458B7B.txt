So me give it to ya in a parable :
Old time people them used to say :
When short mouth tell you you can't hear
So when long mouth tell you ya a go feel it, feel it
You talk too much, you will pay for what you don't eat
Goat never know the use of him tail till the butcher cut it off
Goat never know the use of him tail till the butcher cut it off

Looks is deceiving, man - don't underrate no man
Looks is deceiving, yeah - don't underrate no man
Don't watch the tool, the work it can do
Watch the man that behind it
The man laugh first, him nuh laugh
Yet the man laugh las', get it full....
