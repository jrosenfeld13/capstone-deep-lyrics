[Verse 1]
Aha, shake
Taper jean girl, with a motel face
Aha, shake
Bury your eyes in a secret place
Aha, shake
Black as night on a summer day

[Chorus]
Cunts watch their bodies, no room for make-up
I think he's tasted, tasted the watcher

[Verse 2]
Heart, Heartbreak
Knocking them down like the seventh grade
Heart, Heartbreak
Cigarettes and song with a winter's chafe
Heart, Heartbreak
Keep like my daughter and a run away

[Chorus]
Cunts watch their bodies, no room for make-up
I think he's tasted, tasted the watcher

[Bridge]
Aha, shake, taper jean girl kills me

[Chorus]
Cunts watch their bodies, no room for make-up
I think he's tasted, tasted the watcher

[Outro]
I gotta shake, shake, shake
I gotta keep on, keep on, keep on
I gotta keep on, keep on, keep on
I gotta shake, shake, shake
