There is no trial that He can't bring me through
There is no tunnel that He can't bring light to
Though I feel like giving up, in Christ I shall maintain
Because of my faith in God, my joy shall remain
Trials worketh patience and patience worketh hope
In spite of my situation, I won't let go

There is no problem I know that God can't solve
When I get into it, He's already involved

Though I feel like giving up, in Christ I shall maintain
Because of my faith in God, my joy shall remain
Trials worketh patience and patience worketh hope
In spite of my situation, I won't let go

There is no trial that He can't bring me through
There is no tunnel that He can't bring light to
Though I feel like giving up, in Christ I shall maintain
Because of my faith in God, my joy shall remain
Trials worketh patience and patience worketh hope
In spite of my situation, I won't let go

You may be weary and feel you can't go on
My friend take courage, in Christ you must be strong

Though I feel like giving up, in Christ I shall maintain
Because of my faith in God, my joy shall remain
Trials worketh patience and patience worketh hope
In spite of my situation, I won't let go

There is no trial that He can't bring me through
There is no tunnel that He can't bring light to
Though I feel like giving up, in Christ I shall maintain
Because of my faith in God, my joy shall remain
Trials worketh patience and patience worketh hope
In spite of my situation, I won't let go

No I won't let go
No, no I won't let go

Break I
Leader Chorus
I was locked in jail Shackled me
Then Your blood Set me free
For the rest of my days Honor Thee
I've got it, I got it I've got victory

Son of Man Called my name
Then Your blood Broke the chains
With the Word of God His story
I've got it, I got it I've got victory

Vamp

There is no problem I know that God can't solve
When I get into it, He's already involved

You may be weary and feel you can't go on
My friend take courage, in Christ you must be strong
