[Chorus:]
Keep on choogling [x3]
Choogling [x2]

[Verse 1]
Maybe you don't understand it
But if you're a natural man
You got to ball and have a good time
And that's what I call choogling
Here comes Mary looking for Harry
She going to choogle tonight
Here comes Louie, works in the sewer
He going to choogle tonight

[Chorus x2]

If you can choose it, who can refuse it
You all be choogling tonight
Go on, take your pick, right from the git go
You got to choogle tonight

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh, we're Creedence!
Clearwater!
Revival!
