What would I do
If I could never come back
When I'm sitting here
I'm not mean anymore

I don't feel safe
When I'm feeling down
But I'm not afraid
Of hanging around

You thought you could
Leave me out of your will
It's only fair to tell me
Not to hang around

I don't feel safe
When I'm feeling down
But I'm not afraid
Of hanging around
