The gravity of the wish
That centers 'round a lie
That imitates a smile
And condescends to give
And wishes it could live
The judgement and the love
That killed the singing bird
That comes and goes at will
And plays and plays until
The game of desperation
Controls the situation
Smile when you say
You've reached me again
Smile when you say
You've reached me again

Oh what a happy sound
Brings me to your side
Can't you understand
I can't make it end
And so I turn aside
In voidness I'll abide
The door of my house is open
And evermore shall be
The only thing for living
Is what you cannnot see
And that shall not be me
Smile when you say
You've reached me again
Smile when you say
You've reached me again
