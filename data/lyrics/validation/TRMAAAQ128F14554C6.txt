[Verse 1]
Economics Legality (Chuck it)
Does it show, we love to be free?
Plain and simple, are you okay?
For tomorrow, we generate the courage today

[Chorus]
Is your will about to quake and melt?
Let me help, let me help

[Verse 2]
Psychopathic Brutality (Stop it)
Rejuvenate more integrity
Universal all live as one
Edification first, then we can have some fun

[Chorus]
A voice cried loud and clear as we knelt
Let me help, let me help

[Verse 3]
Bummy thoughts again, but hey you got a friend
And he may bless thee
Even the dungeon, and the one that's on the crumb
Live eternally

[Chorus]
When they kill and pain for gains of wealth
Let me help, let me help
Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life
