When you're thrown out of work
Got no money to eat
You've got nowhere to live
And there's holes in your feet
Bite the Bullet

When it's Saturday night
You've got no money to spend
And watching your girl
Go off with your friend
Bite the Bullet

Believe in tomorrow
There'll be much less sorrow
Look around you at your brothers
You've got more than most others
They can't stop you from living
They can't stop you feeling
They can't stop your dreaming
They can't take that away from you
