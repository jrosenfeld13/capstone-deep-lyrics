The singer finished singing and she's walking out
The singer sheds a tear, fear of falling out

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's hard to say how I feel today
For years gone by
And I cried

[Chorus]
It's hard to say that I was wrong
It's hard to say I miss you
Since you've been gone it's not the same

My worries weigh the world how I used to be
And everything I'm caught seems a plague in me

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's hard to say how I feel today
For years gone by
And I cried

[Chorus]
It's hard to say that I was wrong
It's hard to say I miss you
Since you've been gone it's not the same
It's hard to say I held my tongue
It's hard to say if only
Since you've been gone it's not the same

Worse than the fear it's the lie you told a thousand times before
Worse than a fear it's the knife

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's hard to say how I feel today
For years gone by
And I cried

[Chorus]
It's hard to say that I was wrong
It's hard to say I miss you
Since you've been gone it's not the same
It's hard to say I held my tongue
It's hard to say if only
Since you've been gone it's not the same

It's hard to say that I was wrong
It's hard to say I miss you
Since you've been gone it's not the same
