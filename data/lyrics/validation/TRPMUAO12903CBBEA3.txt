(Fire with fire, fire with fire)
You had to open up that door
It's never gonna be the way it was before
So what do we fight for?
Do we always have to even up that score?
I don't know where we went wrong
I don't know where we belong
Tell me why we are so lost
Will we decide which side we're on?
And now it's on
We're fighting fire with fire
The flames burning, burning
Higher and higher
It always has to be an eye for an eye
Justice remains the one and only desire
Fighting fire with fire
You do to me like I do to you
And I do to you like you do to me
Fighting fire with fire
Fighting fire with fire
There's a feeling deep inside
It's way too hard to ever push aside
It's all that's on your mind
I wanna give in, but I can't this time
I don't know where we went wrong
I don't know where we belong
Tell me why we are so lost
Will we decide which side we're on?
And now it's on
We're fighting fire with fire
The flames burning, burning
Higher and higher
It always has to be an eye for an eye
Justice remains the one and only desire
Fighting fire with fire
You do to me like I do to you
And I do to you like you do to me
Fighting fire with fire
Fighting fire with fire
You aren't backing down
Backing down
And I ain't giving into you
There's no more common ground
Common ground
You broke the only golden rule
Fire with fire, fire with fire
Fire with fire, fire with fire
And now it's on
We're fighting fire with fire
The flames burning, burning
Higher and higher
It always has to be an eye for an eye
Justice remains the one and only desire
Fighting fire with fire
You do to me like I do to you
And I do to you like you do to me
Fighting fire with fire
Fighting fire with fire
You do to me like I do to you
And I do to you like you do to me
Fighting fire with fire
Fighting fire with fire
Fire with fire
