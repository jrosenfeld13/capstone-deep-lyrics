Hello, yeah, this is me
Lord, it's been a long, long time
I know this ain't no social call
So, go ahead, get it off your mind

You heard what? Well, it ain't true
I was here most all last night
I got over you the day you left
Could it be somebody lied?

They said what? That I was cryin'?
I haven't shed a tear in years
That I spoke your name? Well, that's insane
I've hardly noticed you're not here

That I showed your picture to some stranger?
Don't you think I've got no pride
They've been here at home, face down on a shelf
Lord, I bet somebody lied

But if they were true
What would it matter to you?
Would it change the way you feel?
If the rumors were right
Would you be here tonight
To help this old heart heal

Well, don't worry, it wasn't me
Just someone whose world was torn in two
Someone who looks a lot like me
And loves someone like you

So, forget the tears I've never cried
Lord, I bet somebody lied
