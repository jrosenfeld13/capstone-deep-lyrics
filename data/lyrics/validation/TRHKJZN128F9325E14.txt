If they could see me now, Booming and Zooming
If they could see me now, Booming and Zooming

F104, come in F104......
C'mon get down F104
Ho, get back up F104!
Aw, now, one more time for me
On the ground F1--104 get down..

'Cause you know and I know it's a private thing
At twice the speed of
Sound blue goes to black

You're spinning flat like a skipping stone F104
But don't green apple
Ok. We want no defenstrations today, okay?

F104 where are you at? Play it Kenneth!
Uh! You think you're staying cool while its getting hot,eh?

F104 here, uh, stop flapping your gums
I wear my own clothes now
And I don't need you to roll up my sleeves, ok?

Uh ground here, uh, that's a couple of million, F104

F104 here, uh, look this is a private thing
And I don't want you talking about it
Down there with your nice friends
Cause this is a private thing, ok?
Cause I've tried A
And then I've tried B
And then I've tried C...
But no, I won't green apple

Uh, this is the ground F104
Get outa there, get outa there F104!

F104 uh, not to sweat baby
It's my hide and I can ride her out

This is the ground get down here F104
You and I know who your hide
Belongs to!

F104 here, uh, I guess I'm at about 75 thousand feet
And the rpm's are damn near zero
Uh, maybe falling about 150 feet a second
Uh, that makes about 9000 feet a minute
Uh, Like I said I've tried A
And I've tried B
And C, didn't do nothing
Just spinning around
Like a boomerang
In the sky up here!...I reckon

I got about one last shot

Ok, this is a private thing
This blue to black
At twice the speed of sound
It's green silent peace
With waves around
And it's lighting up
Like a damn Christmas tree in here!

But we'll ignore what these little lights are saying
And enjoy the view because
You know and I know
It's just that little old problem
Our boys in Engineering find so entertaining

This is the ground, come in F104
Come in F104, come in F104

F104 here, I'd love to talk to you sweetheart
But this Christmas tree is smoking
And it's obscuring the view
I'm preparing to disintegrate now
I'll see you boys
For a drink on the ground
At about 1900 hours, okay? BYE!

If they could see me now, Booming and Zooming
If they could see me now...
If they could see me now, Booming and Zooming
