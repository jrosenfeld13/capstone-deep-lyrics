Thought of hatred in my brain they can't get me down
Makes me think that I'm insane they can't get me down
I wish people weren't so cruel they can't get me down
So many assholes in this world they can't get me down
Seems most people act the same
I don't know why this can't change
Why can't people just open up
And start to act just like themselves
So many people do not think they can't get me down
All my father does is drink they can't get me down
People think that I'm a disgrace they cant get me down
I wanna punch them all in the face they can't get me down
Seems most people act the same
I don't know why this can't change
Why can't people just open up
And start to act just like themselves
These are the best moments of your life
Savor each moment be glad to be alive
Make the most of this time you have left
You may never have it this good again
Don't worry you're not alone WE'RE WITH YOU
We understand how you're feeling
Certain people have to follow the rules. BUT WE DON'T
WE CAN THINK FOR OURSELVES

Why do they fuck up my world
I see violence all around me
Bloody wars fought all the time
Business, drug lords, government
They kill us with their crimes
Taking it all for themselves
Leaving nothing left for us
Why do they fuck up my world?
Fucking assholes deserve to die
Hate them all cause they're full of lies
Tell us all that they are right
For our freedom we must fight
Dont believe them, they exploit us all
Patriotism will kill us all
You better act now before it's too late
Complacency will seal your fate
100,000 dead in our latest fascist war
Now do you realize what our government stands for?
Don't just watch it on TV
Go out and protest in the streets
Why do they fuck up my world?
Fucking assholes deserve to die
Hate them all cause they're full of lies
Tell us all that they are right
For our freedom we must fight
Don't believe them, they exploit us all
Patriotism will kill us all
You better act now before it's too late
Complacency will seal your fate
Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight
Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight, FIGHT BACK!
