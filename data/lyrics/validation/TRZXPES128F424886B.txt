Chorus:
When I hear music, it makes me dance
You got the music, heres my chance
Repeat (1x)

Went to the disco, couldn't belive my eyes
I looked on the dance floor, saw so many guys
I asked myself, could this really be
Whether it is or not, I'm going to see

Chorus

The guys look really fine, they almost blew my mind
They almost blew my mind
The guys looked really good, just like I knew they would
And I'm gonna get a man if I get a chance
Here's my chance

Chorus (2x)

The night is still young and I'm gonna have some fun
And I'm in a trance, all I want to do is dance
Watch me dance
Everybody's having fun, and the musics number one
And the lights shining bright, theres a party here tonight

Chorus

It stated getting late, the night was really great
When I hear music, give me a chance, heres your chance
When I hear music, I wanna dance
You got the music, I'm gonna dance

Chorus (5x)
