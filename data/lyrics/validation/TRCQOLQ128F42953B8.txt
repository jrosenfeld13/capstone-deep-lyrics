It's crazy
The way love can go astray
You're together
Then you turn your separate ways

Good times, yes
They come and go
I know that's just a part of life
But there's one thing I need to know
If you doubt don't hold it inside
(Oh no)

CHORUS
Just take it slow
Let me know
All the things on your mind
Let's talk it over
Suddenly you may find
Now's the time to unwind
And talk it over

Mixed emotions
Let's lay them on the line
All your questions
There's answers we can find

Love can have uncertainty
I know that's just a part of life
There's just one heart
That I really need
That's yours
I will never deny

CHORUS

Good times, yes
They come and go
I know that's just a part of life
But there's one thing I need to know
If you doubt
Don't hold it inside
(Oh no)

CHORUS
