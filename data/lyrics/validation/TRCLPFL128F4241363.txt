Roll river
Keep on rolling
Ancient lady, cold
I'm forsaken
Lost and forgotten
Roll river
Roll

Roll river
Roll river
Roll

Let it take me
Free and unchain me
Ancient lady, cold
Keep on rolling
Roll on forever
Hope you send me
Home

Roll river
Roll river
Roll

You hold my body
Lost and forsaken
In your deep waters cold
Oh sacred river
Take me to my sweetheart
My lonely bones

Will she remember
Oh river take me
On my journey home

Deep dark waters
To learn your secrets
River angel rise

Roll river
Roll river
Roll

Roll river
Roll over my
Bones
