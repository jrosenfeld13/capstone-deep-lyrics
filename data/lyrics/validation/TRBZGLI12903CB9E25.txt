What's the use of moving on
Maybe here's where I belong
I've had my fill of life's uncertainties

You think too much they say you're strange
They even raised the drinking age
This place has gone to hell since I've been away

But now this time I'll do it right
Yeah let's start tonight
Make the call and see who's still around

Don't look now, but Johnny's back again
I am your man
I paid the price, I'll take that slide again
Nothing stays the same

Tell the boys to step aside
Tell the girls to form a line
The king is back to claim the land again

Wanna fight? Let's get it done
Need to love, I am the one
Time to remember how we played the game

But now this time we'll do it right
Yeah let's go tonight
What the hell you've got to lose?!

Don't look now, but Johnny's back again
I am your man
I paid the price, I'll take that slide again
Nothing stays the same

Tell the boys to jump inside
Tonight we're gonna ride
It's time to show'em how its really done

You ever play - you never win
You don't even know what's happening
Until the end and then your race has run

This time we'll do it right
Yeah let's start tonight
Make the call and see who's still around

Don't look now, but Johnny's back again
I am your man
I paid the price, I'll take that slide again
Nothing stays the same
