Couldn't get in the show
Hangin' out in the street
(We had nowhere to go
In the Miami heat)
We were just kickin' the shit
We were just out havin' fun
(We didn't bother no one)
Four punks in a park
A big stick in your hand
(It was late, it was dark
You had to prove you're a man)
You wear your badge with pride
A gun close by your side
(You're just a pig, mother fucker
Just a pig)

(Above the law, above the law, above the law)
You mother fucker!
(Above the law, above the law, above the law)
You think you're big?
(Above the law, above the law, above the law)
You're fuckin' nothing but a pig!

(Above the law, above the law, above the law)
You mother fucker!
(Above the law, above the law, above the law)
You think you're big?
(Above the law, above the law, above the law)
You're fuckin' nothing but a pig!

You like to push us around
That's how you have your fun
(You're the law in this town
You answer to no one)
You swore to serve and protect
But who protects us from you
(From me you'll get no respect
It's time to pay your dues)
I think back to that night
Out in the cold dark street
(I should have put up a fight
But my revenge will be sweet)
You pushed too far this time
And I've committed no crime
(You're gonna die pig
You're gonna die)

(Above the law, above the law, above the law)
You mother fucker!
(Above the law, above the law, above the law)
You think you're big?
(Above the law, above the law, above the law)
You're fuckin' nothing but a pig!

(Above the law, above the law, above the law)
You mother fucker!
(Above the law, above the law, above the law)
You think you're big?
(Above the law, above the law, above the law)
You're fuckin' nothing but a pig!

In the shadows I hide
A blade close by my side
(You're gonna die, pig!
You're gonna die, pig!)
Under a blanket of night
I keep myself out of sight
(You're gonna die, pig!
You're gonna die, pig!)
Feel my blade at your throat
Now on your own blood you'll choke
(You're gonna die, pig!
You're gonna die, pig!)
Your wound pours out in a flood
I slip and slide on your blood
Your body drops with a thud
I push your face in the mud

(Above the law, above the law, above the law)
You mother fucker!
(Above the law, above the law, above the law)
You think you're big?
(Above the law, above the law, above the law)
You're fuckin' nothing but a pig!

(Above the law, above the law, above the law)
You mother fucker!
(Above the law, above the law, above the law)
You think you're big?
(Above the law, above the law, above the law)
You're fuckin' nothing but a pig!
