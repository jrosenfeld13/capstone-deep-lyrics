If someone tells you there's no other form of life
And you believe in them too
I'm gonna tell you 'bout the other night
I swear that it's true
A cloud of white, and green, and flying ships
I've never seen
Came into my view

Was I frightened? Was I scared? Was I thrown into confussion?
As they glided down so silently, it wasn't an illusion
No no
No doubt about it
Oh no
No doubt about it

What kind of magnetism kept me in this place?
Was it out of my control?
What was the ship from outer space?
What was this creature that appeared before my eyes?
Was it good? Was it evil?
On the ship from other skies

I was frightened. I was Scared. I was thrown into confussion
As they stood right there in front of me
It wasn't an illusion
No no
No doubt about it
Oh no
No doubt about it

They stood right there infront of me
What can they be?
No illusion
No no doubt about it
Oh no
No doubt about it
Oh no
No doubt about it
Oh no
No doubt about it
No no
No ain't no doubt
Ain't no doubt
No no
(repeat)
