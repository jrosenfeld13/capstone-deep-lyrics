1, 2, 3, 4

I don't want another man
I cry myself to sleep at night
Thinking of your love in me
Oh baby, please come back and be

Oh won't you be my daddy, love you oh
No other daddy can tell me what to do
Oh won't you be my daddy, please me daddy
Be my daddy please (1, 2, 3, 4)

I love you madly
Sex bomb

I don't want another man
Sleeping in my room at night
Don't want his dirty fingers
Up inside, up inside my tights

Oh won't you be my daddy, love you oh
No other daddy can tell me what to do
Oh won't you be my daddy, please me daddy
Be my daddy please

Oh won't you be my daddy, love you oh
No other daddy can tell me what to do
Oh won't you be my daddy, please me daddy
Be my daddy please (1, 2, 3, 4)

(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

Come home and do it right
Come home and do it right
I'm yours tonight

Oh won't you be my daddy, love you oh
No other daddy can tell me what to do
Oh won't you be my daddy, please me daddy
Be my daddy please (1, 2, 3, 4)

Oh won't you be my daddy, love you oh
No other daddy can tell me what to do
Oh won't you be my daddy, please me daddy
Be my daddy please (1, 2, 3, 4)

I love you madly
Sex bomb
I love you madly
Sex bomb (1, 2, 3, 4)

I love you madly
Sex bomb
I love you madly
Sex bomb (1, 2, 3, 4)

I love you madly
Sex bomb
I love you madly
