I thought love at first sight was a fate for someone else
And you'd never catch me fallin' that fast myself
But I didn't even need two seconds alone with you
All it took was one and only one

CHORUS:
Now, I see me bein' faithful, me bein' true
Holdin' on and never lettin' go of you
Girl, look what you've done
The one thing I want is you lovin' me
And from now on the only thing I want to be
Is your one and only one, one and only one

You've got a heaven sent heart and an angel's touch
Not to mention your kiss that I can't get enough of
And when I see your smile this feelin' deep, down inside
Tells me you're my one and only one

CHORUS

I didn't even need two seconds alone with you
All it took was one and only one

CHORUS
