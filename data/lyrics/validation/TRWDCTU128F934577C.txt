[Dope-ass bass intro]

[Chorus]
Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap you hands

Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands

[Verse 1]
Music never lets you down
Puts a smile on your face any time, anyplace
Dancing helps relieve the pain
Soothes your mind, makes you happy again
Listen to those dancing feet
Close your eyes and let go
But it don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing
Bop-shoo-wa, bop-shoo-wa, bop-shoo-wa

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Spinning all around the floor just like Rogers and Astaire
Who found love without a care stepping to our favorite tune
The good times always end too soon
Everybody's dancing lift your feet, have some fun
Come on everybody, get on your feet
Clap your hands everybody's screaming

[Chorus] (x2)

[Bass solo]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Everybody dance
Everybody dance
Everybody dance
Everybody dance

Everybody dance
Everybody dance
Everybody dance
Everybody dance

[Outro]
Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap you hands
(x4)
