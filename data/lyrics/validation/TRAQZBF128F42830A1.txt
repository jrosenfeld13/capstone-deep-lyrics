Tell you about the place
I've lived all my life
I'll tell you all the truth about
The struggle and stife
All the toffs say it's a bit of a dive
It's the only place left
Where anyone is alive
East end
Take a walk around bethnal green
Or meet the mile end mob
Well they're mean
Gt a 69 bus to canning town
It's never ever gonna get us down
East end
We can't help it if we're
Working class yobs
We can't help it if we hate the snobs
So you can stick to your seaside
Your beaches and sand
Cos we've got the best home in the land
