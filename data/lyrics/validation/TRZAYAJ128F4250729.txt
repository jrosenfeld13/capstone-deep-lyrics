Make this right
We're going to
Don't you worry
We're going to

All of the drawbridges
In the city are upright
Nobody, not even you
Can bring them down

So cry about it
It's in your mind
It's in your way
It's underneath your skin

I guess I was wrong
The way I felt about you was right
I guess it's alright

One in a million
Chances are always on our side
We're looking for anything
Anything to keep us alright
Alright

The next time you find yourself
In the water
You hold tight
And why don't you ask yourself
What you're living for

So cry about it
It's in your mind
It's in your way
It's underneath your skin

I guess I was wrong
The way I felt about you was right

So hold on
Won't you hold on

One in a million
Chances are always on our side
We're looking for anything
Anything to keep us alright
Alright

Happy, I just want to be happy
With myself tonight

Make this right
You've got to
Don't you worry
You've got to

One in a million
Chances are always on our side
We're looking for anything
Anything to keep us alright
Alright

Happy, I just want to be happy
With myself tonight
