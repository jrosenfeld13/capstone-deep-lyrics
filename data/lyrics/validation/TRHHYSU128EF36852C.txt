[Chorus]
She's calling you
She's calling you
She's calling you
She's calling you, you, you, you

[Verse 1]
Floating up the street
Synthetic sounds are sweet, oh yeah, yeah
To everyman I meet
This is how I greet
Did you get that call?
Or were you not at home?
Little chance you'll miss
Just steady on your phone

[Bridge]
I know you're glad
Wisdom's not sad, ohuouoh
Uuhh
I know you're glad
Wisdom's not sad, ohuouoh
Uuhh

[Verse 2]
Vibrating cosmic waves
Spirit electricity, uh yeah, uh yeah
Kaleidoscopic trees
In the endless sea
Is there one for all
Inseparable to no other
One voluntary kiss
Keeps contemplating home

[Bridge]
I know you're glad
Wisdom's not sad, ohuouoh
Uuhh
I know you're glad
Wisdom's not sad, ohuouoh
Uuhh

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Oh, she's calling
Yes, she's calling
Yes, she's calling you
Yes, she's calling
Yes, she's calling
Yes, she's calling you and you
Yes, she's calling
Yes, she's calling
Yes, she's calling you
Oh, she's calling you

[Bridge]
I know you're glad
Wisdom's not sad, ohuouoh
Uuhh
I know you're glad
Wisdom's not sad, ohuouoh
Uuhh
