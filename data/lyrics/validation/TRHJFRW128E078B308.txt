I found her diary underneath a tree
And started reading about me
The words she's written
Took me by surprise
You'd never read them in her eyes

They said that she had found
The love she'd waited for
Wouldn't you know it?
She wouldn't show it

When she confronted
With the writing there
Simply pretended not to care
I passed it off
As just in keeping
With her total disconcerting air

And though she tried
To hide the love that she denied
Wouldn't you know it?
She wouldn't show it

And as I go through my life
I will give to her
My wife
All the sweet things I can find

I found her diary underneath a tree
And started reading about me
The words began stick
And tears to flow
Her meaning now was clear to see

The love she'd waited for
Was someone else
Not me
Wouldn't you know it?
She wouldn't show it

And as I go through my life
I will wish for her
His wife
All the sweet things she can find
All the sweet things they can find
