[Part I: "Your Only Doll (Dora)"]

[Verse 1]
I fell into the street, poison in my veins
Clambered to my feet and into the night again
Back to my home, back to my owner
Who screams at my tardiness
Put his hands to the sky

[Chorus]
And says, what can I do with a girl
If she refuses to be mine?

[Verse 2]
In his bed I am queen, unobtainable me
Sexual being, human with feelings
The two are not me
The two will not be mine

[Chorus]
And what can you do with a girl
If she refuses to be mine?

[Verse 3]
Put his hand on my shirt
Hand on my face
Head to the wall
When you've broken your only doll

[Chorus]
And what will you do with a girl
If she refuses to be alive?

[Outro]
And you've broken your only doll
And what will you do with a girl
If she's refusing to be alive?

[Part II: "Alas, I Cannot Swim"]

[Verse 1]
There's a house across the river but, alas, I cannot swim
And a garden of such beauty that the flowers seem to grin
There's a house across the river, but alas, I cannot swim
I'll live my life regretting that I never jumped in

[Verse 2]
There's a boy across the river with short black curly hair
He wants to be my lover and I want to be his peer
There's a boy across the river but, alas, I cannot swim
And I never will get to put my arms around him

[Verse 3]
There's a life across the river that was meant for me
Instead I live my life in constant misery
There's a life across the river, but I do not see
Why I should please those who will never be pleased

[Verse 4]
There is gold across the river, but I don't want none
There is gold across the river, but I don't want none
Gold is fleeting, gold is fickle, gold is fun
Gold is fleeting, gold is fickle, gold is fun

[Verse 5]
There is gold across the river, but I don't want none
I would rather be dry than held up by a golden gun

[Outro]
Saying, work more, earn more, live more
Have more fun
