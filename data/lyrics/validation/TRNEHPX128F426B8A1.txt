If you think this is a drag
Then don't let me stop you
If you think it's time to change
Then I hope that change mocks you
I won't get in your way
I've got nothing left to say but
Goodbye

Goodbye Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

I thought that I would be lost
Without you
But I was wrong
I thought that I would be lost
Without you
But I was wrong

So Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
