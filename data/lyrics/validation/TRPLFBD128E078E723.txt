It's a big day in the North
It's a big day in the North, love

Touche, Toshack, pineapple
With a smile, en coule, big apple
I turn to you, get up Georgey best
Mais oui, mais oui, mon ami

It's a big day in the North
It's a big day in the North, love
Grand jour pour le nord, amour

Sticks and stones
May break your bones
But love, love will always hurt you
Blood shot eyes
Scan the sky
Oh my, oh my, oh my!

It's a big day in the North, love
It's a big day in the North, love
Grand jour pour le nord, amour

It's a big day in the North, love
It's a big day in the North, love
Grand jour pour le nord, amour

It's a big day in the North, love
It's a big day in the North, love
Grand jour pour le nord, amour
It's a big day in the North, love

It's a big day in the North, love
It's a big day in the North, love
Grand jour pour le nord, amour
It's a big day in the North, love...
