When the hour is struck, the dead will rise
They'll dig up from below, they'll feed tonight
Terror through the streets, hunting for the weak
They shall reign supreme until we're all dead

The skies are black with the plague of death
You look upwards while you take your last breath
You're one among the masses if the living dead
You walk these streets, just to kill

Now it's in your veins
You're one among the mass of the living dead
You walk these streets with no objective in mind, then to kill

Now the hour has struck, the dead will rise
They dig up from below, they'll feed tonight
You will perish

Viciously killing, spreading their disease
The skies are black with the plague of death
Buried beneath the blood
