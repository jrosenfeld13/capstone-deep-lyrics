Think of you often in silk and in rags
Think of you laughing and feeling so sad
Think of your life I think of your time
Think of you aching and feeling divine

If you knew if you knew
How I loved you

Think of you trying to cure your mistakes
The mother father you hate
Think of you sitting there in your cell
Think of your anguish your living Hell

If you knew if you knew
How I loved you
How I loved you
