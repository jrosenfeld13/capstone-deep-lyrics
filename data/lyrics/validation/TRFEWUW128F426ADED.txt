The sound of a screaming hound howling in my ears
Black visions from yesterday feeling all my fears
Another vicious night behind, I can't recall a thing
I've sunken down again into the liquid of the kings

Chorus:
Trying to clear things out
Trying to get my life back on track again

Breathing hard, it feels like my heart is bursting out
Makes me crazy, a hit insane, so I just scream and shout
Every single time gets worse, will I ever learn?
'coz when it's time to choose the way, I take a fatal turn

Chorus:
Trying to clear things out
Trying to get my life back on track again

Time after time I fall down into the depths of my mind
Searching my way out from this endless circle
And time after time I climb up again on the highest spire
I'm on my way, on my journey into darkness

Burning life fuel far too fast, driven by addiction
This ride is getting frightening, feels like a bad prediction
Mayhem, confusion, I'm under attack
The one who's calling my name, knows that I'll be back

Chorus:
Trying to clear things out
Trying to get my life back on track again

Time after time I fall down into the depths of my mind
Searching my way out from this endless circle
And time after time I climb up again on the highest spire
I'm on my way, on my journey into darkness
