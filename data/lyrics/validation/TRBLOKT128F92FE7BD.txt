Paroles de la chanson Millionaire :
Well, I started out with one long dollar
Gambled with the man and I won me another
I bought me a gun and I robbed my brother
I'm bad, but I don't care boys, I'm gonna be a million-
Aire

Well, I hopped on a ship and we sailed on the waves
Dealt in rum and we dealt in slaves
Left my captain and sold him brave
He's gone, but I don't care, I'm gonna be a millionaire

How many of you wanna see me dead?
How many of you wanna have my head?
How many of you just live your lives?
Wishing you were me boys, wishing you were me?

Well, I married rich, a pretty little wife
Brought her misery every day of her life
She slit her wrist with a silver knife
You can't blame that on me boys, her money belongs to

Me

Well, I found myself in a good position
To buy myself some cheap politicians
Bought myself a big election
That's just how it went boys, now I own the president

How many of you wanna see me dead?
How many of you wanna have my head?
How many of you just live your lives?
Wishing you were me boys, wishing you were me?

When you say your prayers down on your knees
Ask the Lord, forgive you, please
If it crosses your mind say one for me
I know where I'm bound boys, I know where I'm bound

Cause I started out with one long dollar
Gambled with the man and I won me another
I bought me a gun and I robbed my brother
I'm bad, but I don't care boys, I'm gonna be a
Millionaire
