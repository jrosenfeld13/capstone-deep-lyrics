[Verse #1]
Rows of houses on forever
What the neighbors never know
When the hammer fell
The kettle whistle yells
All good sinners go to hell
Serpent turns onto itself

[Chorus]
Did it occur to you too?
What was the worst you could do?
You wouldn't believe it, wouldn't believe it
I don't believe it too

Never occurred to you too
Wouldn't believe it, wouldn't believe it
I don't believe it too

[Verse #2]
Can you really keep a secret?
Cross your heart and hope to die
Maybe an evil one
The mind is all but gone
Trespass fits you like a charm
A scarlet letter on your arm

[Chorus]
Did it occur to you too?
What was the worst you could do?
You wouldn't believe it, wouldn't believe it
I don't believe it too

Never occurred to you too
Wouldn't believe it, wouldn't believe it
I don't believe it too

[Bridge]
Arms open for the taking
I'm telling you the truth
Strange choices you've been making
They will be coming back to you

[Chorus]
Did it occur to you too?
What was the worst you could do?
You wouldn't believe it, wouldn't believe it
I don't believe it too

Never occurred to you too
Wouldn't believe it, wouldn't believe it
I don't believe it too

[Outro]
Answer me, will you be received?

[Interlude]
