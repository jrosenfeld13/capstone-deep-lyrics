[Verse 1]
So now you're gonna change everything?
How expected and unoriginal of you
Now that everything is crumbling and
Not falling for your words
You found the glue asked for not long ago

[Refrain]
You're scared
Your existence no longer means
What you thought it did
Your body doesn't even accept
What comes out between your teeth as truth

[Verse 2]
So hurry up now boy
Start sweeping and gluing
Get to work
Get to work
Get to work

[Verse 3]
Nothing makes those around happier
Than to see that rabid mask melting onto your face
This isn't a party, this isn't a holiday
Your costume will not come off
Your costume will not come off

[Bridge]
I know I can help you
I'm inside you
I am you
I laugh as your idiotic mind wanders
And it wanders

[Refrain]
You're scared
Your existence no longer means
What you thought it did
Your body doesn't even accept
What comes out between your teeth as truth

[Outro]
So hurry up now boy
Start sweeping and gluing
Get to work
Get to work
Get to work

You're scared
Well sniff the glue, you fuck
You're too late
Nothing will change
This will be a bad dream come true
You're too late
Nothing will change
You're too late
