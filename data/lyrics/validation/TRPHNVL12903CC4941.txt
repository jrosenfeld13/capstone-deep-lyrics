Full moon light's calling me
My kingdom lies within
The mystic soul and lion's heart
Brought by the talisman
The ecstasy of battle takes me
Where the falcons fly
Immortal youth was granted me
I will never die

Born of black wind, fire and steel
Born of black wind, fire and steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Born of black wind, fire and steel

Pounded by the hammers
Of the giants of the world
I can see in darkness
I'm the overlord
Single combat I await
My shadow brings them fear
The spikes upon my chariot
Will grind them when they're near

Born of black wind, fire and steel
Born of black wind, fire and steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Born of black wind, fire and steel

I am an outcast on the path of no return
Punisher and swordsman
I was born to burn
Black wind always follows
Where my black horse rides
Fire's in my soul
And steel is on my side

Born of black wind, fire and steel
Born of black wind, fire and steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Born of black wind, fire and steel

I am an outcast on the path of no return
Punisher and swordsman
I was born to burn
Black wind always follows
Where my black horse rides
Fire's in my soul
Steel is on my side

Born of black wind, fire and steel
Born of black wind, fire and steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Born of black wind, fire and steel

I am an outcast on the path of no return
Punisher and swordsman
I was born to burn
Black wind always follows
Where my black horse rides
Fire's in my soul
Steel is on my side

Born of black wind, fire and steel
Born of black wind, fire and steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Born of black wind, fire and steel

Black wind, fire and steel
Black wind, fire and steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Black wind, fire and steel

Born of black wind, fire and steel
Black wind, fire and steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Black wind, fire and steel

Black wind, fire and steel
Black wind, fire and steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Born of black wind, fire and steel
