Isam:
A smile is a charity
Like a million bucks, to the refugees
Study knowledge for a single year
Study decency for the next two years
The beloved (peace be apon him)
Was a messenger
And the mercy apon anyone and anywhere
A slave like the moon, with words so kind
Angels lower their wings
Son of mary
Was a prophet too
Would give it all up for me and you
Oh what happy, like a ghetto child (AYYY?)
(???????????) same inside
(???????????) world
A traveller who takes
Shade under a tree
Only to resume
The whole journey so beautiful

************CHORUS

Angels lower their wings
And i
Oh we may shine
Oh oh oh oh oh
Angels lower their wings
So we can find
The truth in everything
Without your life
Wouldn't be able to survive
???????? colours and lines
Angels lower their wings

*******************************

See the world, See the world, See the world, See the world
See the world, is but a moment (come on)
Player so make it a moment true
And try to move your feet
But judge your soul
Try to gain some wisdom
So we may glow
Everybody
Wanna go to paradise
Dont no body no
Wanna die
But the traces we gone leave behind
Angels lower their wings tonight

*****CHORUS
Waqas:
When your left in the dark without a spark trust me kid we gone shine

LENNY:
Oh holar ??????????????????

And if your stuck in the gutter like butter dont worry cos we gone find

?????????????????????

Life is packed with trouble, last with struggle, without your life no struggle

Wouldn't be able to find
Shades colours and lines
Angels lower their wings

When your left in the dark without a spark trust me kid we gone shine

Oh oh oh oh oh angels *we gonee shine* lower their wings *we gonee shine*

And if your stuck in the gutter like butter dont worry cos we gone find

Oh oh oh oh oh *gone finddddd* truth in everything

Life is packed with trouble, last with struggle, without your life no hustle

Wouldn't be able to find chains and colours and lines
(so'll am saying baby)
Angels lower their wings (ngssssssssss)
Oh we may shine
Oh oh oh oh oh
Angels lower their wings
(And if your stuck in the gutter like butter dont worry cos we gone finddddddddddd)
Truth in everything
Without your liiiifeeee
Wouldn't be able to smile
Chains and colours and lines
Angels lower their wings
