(Tremble, tremble, tremble)
(Tremble, tremble, tremble)

My lips they tremble from this silence
But I'd rather chew on razor blades
Then speak the words I want to say

Don't tell me you are sorry
I see this thing all too clearly now
We're past apologies
I just want you to bleed like me

I (Tremble)
Should have known (Tremble)
But I never thought you'd do this to me (Tremble)
It (Tremble)
Hurts to laugh (Tremble)
Now that I know the joke was on me (Tremble)

(Chorus:)
And it makes me sick to think
About all those dirty things
And the pictures in my head
You should have slit my throat instead
It would of made more sense
We wouldn't have this mess
The blood would dry
But the lies you hide are rotting your insides

(Tremble, tremble, tremble)

My stomach's got this aching feeling
Thinkings got the best of me
Brought out the worst for all to see
This feels like everybody knows a secret I don't
These malicious grins and whispering
A vicious plot to kill what's left of me

(Chorus)
They'll never know
'Cause we'll never tell
Your secret's safe with me
I'll never let it out (And they'll never know)
(And they'll never know)
(And they'll never know)
(And they'll never know)
(And they'll never know)
(And they'll never know)
(And they'll never know)
Your secret's safe with me (And they'll never know)
I'll never let it out (My lips they tremble from this silence)
(Silence, silence, silence)

I (Tremble)
Should have known (Tremble)
But I never thought you'd do this to me (Tremble)
It (Tremble)
Hurts to laugh (Tremble)
Now that I know the joke was on me (Tremble)

(Chorus 2x)
(My lips they tremble from this silence)
(Silence, silence)
