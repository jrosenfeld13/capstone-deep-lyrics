On the phone
Til 4 a.m
We go over everything
The last years
And how we wasted them

On the phone
Til 4 a.m
We go over everything

Tomorrow keeps on coming
I will never leave you, love
I will never leave you
16 days will melt away
And, I'll be on the plane

Your face is the sun
How did I choose the darkness
There seems no explanation
I'd travel back
To change it if I could
I'd change it if I could

Tomorrow...

So, let's hang on
To the last precious minutes
Of today
As they slip away
Soon the dark will give in
To the first grey light

Tomorrow keeps on coming
Thank God for second chances
For true love and forgiveness
16 Days will melt away
And I'll be on the plane
Moving through time to you
16 days will melt away
And I'll be on the plane
