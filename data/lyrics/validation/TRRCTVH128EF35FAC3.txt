The sequence found but pushed away
I'll love nothing more
Drink, plant, eat, drink, take my time
Drink, plant, eat, drink, take my time
A stage set for the plague of primates
In the sky, on the wind, in the soil
I'm waiting for my cloudbank
To rain and rain and rain on the world

Atoms smash, seeds hit ground
The craters birth new plants
They swallow my friends

A single seed crashes into me
I'm lifted by my thrashing strings
What am I? What have I combined?
What am I? What have I combined?
I'm a spiral, I think quickly
I expand, my strings grow wings and hands
I expand, my strings grow wings and hands
I'm a spiral, I am spiraling

[Hook]
Atoms smash, seeds hit ground
The craters birth new plants
They scream and spiral towards
Deep-space dark mass (dark mass)
They swallow my friends
They swallow my friends

Stop!
This must be hell!
A universe grows in myself!
Oh, I will let it grow!
It will stretch my strings!
And in that pitch-black brightness
I become everything

[Hook]

Atoms smash (my friends, oh?)
They swallow my friends
Atoms smash (my friends, oh?)
They swallow all of them
