I walk like you guide me, my eyes
Are shut like I'm blind
Turn to you and listening and tryin'
To be in your mind
There's a feeling that I get
When I look to the west
'Bout having all the answers
Still failing the test

Wolf packs and convoys and
Captains of men
Surprised in translation
World without end
Welcome back to real life
The picture is gone
Put a contract out on things that go on and on
How do you stay where
You most want to be?
Where'd you get the patience
Did it come easily?

Ahhhhhh
Ahhhhhh
Ahhhhhh

On whose authority
I have none over me
On whose authority
There's none that I can see
On whose authority
I have none over me
On whose authority
No one speaks to me
On whose authority
I have none over me ...
Ahhhhhhh

All the tales with paper heroes
The ones who dyed the sun
And called it yellow
The ones who made you run

On whose authority
I have none over me
On whose authority
There's none that I can see
On whose authority
I have none over me
On whose authority
None that' speaks to me
On whose authority
I have none over me ...
Ahhhhhhh
