I, sat down
She gonna get a lamplight
Eh eh eh eh eh eh, eh

Babe I see your lamplight
Shining from your window
Babe I see your lamplight
Let it shine on me, uhuh

Baby see your window
Baby do you feel low
Waiting on your fear, no
Waiting on me

But I don't really
Wanna go alone
But I get the feeling
I better get on home

Ooh baby, would I look right
Climbing up the drainpipe
Baby would it feel right
If I stayed all night

And I don't really
Wanna go alone
Should I pack my bag
And get on out, get home

Got me rocking and reeling
Reeling and feeling
Gotta get to you babe
Just gotta get through, ooh ooh

I can see lamplight
Shining from your window
Babe I see your lamplight
And it shine on me, uhuh
It shine on me, uhuh
Shine on me, uhuh
Shine on me, uhuh

Shine on, me
Ah, Shine on, me
Now now now shine on, me

Wooh on me
Mmm gonna shine on, me
Cha cha cha, on, me
Cha cha ha ha ha
