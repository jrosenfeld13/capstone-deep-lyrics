Fast and pure desolation
Lust the blood in my brain
Hard and dry destruction
Wet under the neutron rain
Die in this Holocaust
Scream the deflect attack
Burn before we reload
Strees before...
The power blast
WAR! A command for blood
We scream
DIE! Nothing less than
Death we creep
Storm the only weather
Start the directives assassins
Warm inside the under shelter
Wait and fell your broiling skin
Hot oz one disappear
Blight in the atomic detention
Rats it's a survival breed
Destroy with deflagration
I have one track it's to kill
You'll never stop me
Running my evil way
With radioactivity
My machine comes at night
Missiles they stike
Save your life in the dark
For the loud attack
Hey! nuclear war!
I'm realy up tonite
For my last ride
Never returning at home
I'm gonna die
The war machine is not save
And i can't escape
When the bombs will hit
My face, It will drive me insane
