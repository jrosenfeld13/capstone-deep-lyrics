Do I?
Oh do I?
Remain in your mind?

Only to poison
The Love that we find

Desires have misplaced
My wishes are washes
The Air is filled with vibrations
I'm crying for you
You're crying for me
From station to station to station

Silent, soft beauty
Where are you now?
The tide is turning
On your mermaid eyes

Desires have misplaced
My wishes are washes
The Air is filled with vibrations
I'm crying for you
You're crying for me
From station to station to station
