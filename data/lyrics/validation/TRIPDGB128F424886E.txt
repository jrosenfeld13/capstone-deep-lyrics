Jumping music, slick deejays
Fog machines and laser rays

Lookout weekend cause, (here I come)
Because weekends were, (made for fun)

Jumping music, slick deejays
Fog machines and laser rays

Lookout weekend cause, here I come
Because weekends were, made for fun, fun, fun...

I work hard, everyday
Its all work and no play
With the boss on my back
He don't give me any slack
I sit down, I daydream
Of how my weekend's gonna be, be, be...

Lookout weekend cause, (here I come)
Because weekends were, (made for fun)

Lookout weekend cause, (here I come)
Because weekends were, (made for fun)

By the time wednesday comes
I feel the beat and I wanna have fun

Lookout weekend cause, here I come
Because weekends were, made for fun

Lookout weekend cause
Because weekends were

All you ladies, clap your hands
Stomp your feet and grab your man, man, man...

Lookout weekend cause, here I come
Because weekends were, made for fun, fun, fun...

Okay men, its your time
Show the ladies what's on your minds, minds, minds...
