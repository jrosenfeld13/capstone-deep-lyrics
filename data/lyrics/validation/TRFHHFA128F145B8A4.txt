Discouraged is the word these days at homes acros the range
The livestock markets down and it don't look like it's gonna change
Nobody's found a cure for what we are goin' through
But I'll tell you boys just what I'm gonna do
Well I'm gonna saddle up old paint right after shipping time
Ride out on the mountain among the aspens and the pines
Take along my fishing pole and leave my cares behind
And find myself a little piece of mind
I'm gonna ride up on the mountain live like a mountain man
Lay my body on the ground eat from a fryin' pan
I know it's not the answer but I'm gonna try to lose
These dog gone low down workin' cowboy blues

Well next year it might get better aw thats what they always say
But I've seen a string of next years come and Lord they're all the same
But as long as there's a mountain, someplace to get away
Well this old cowboy just might not go insane
I'm gonna ride up on the mountain...
These dog gone low down lonesome workin' cowboy blues
