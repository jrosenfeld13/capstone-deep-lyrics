I was waltzing with my darling
To the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
Introduced him to my loved one
And while they were waltzing
My friend stole my sweetheart from me

I remember the night
And the Tennessee Waltz
'Cause I know just how much I have lost
Yes, I lost my little darling
The night they were playing
That beautiful Tennessee Waltz

She goes dancin' with the darkness
To the Tennessee Waltz
And I feel like I'm falling apart
And it's stronger than drink
And it's deeper than sorrow
This darkness she left in my heart

I remember the night
And the Tennessee Waltz
'Cause I know just how much I have lost
Yes, I lost my little darling
The night they were playing
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz
