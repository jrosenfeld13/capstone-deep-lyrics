Wondering hands, the trees!
The naked stones of grey beauty
Gathered to kiss the ground's hunger
Extatic hate upon man's reply
The war against human instinct
I summon the dirty blood of what we are covered

Still I watch the sky
I see within a cry
For what we fear!
For the why we leave!

Naked hands, the forgotten trees
Stare as I paint the last eagle
The symbol of life
The black sign of the sky
A last leaf of a tree
The only breath left

Questions have been made to give no answers
On the hill I gaze the fortress
Made by Nature's hands

It stares useless for the weak ones
But precious for those who know the way

Still! I watch the sky
I see without wanting to cry
For what we still believe
For the reason we live
