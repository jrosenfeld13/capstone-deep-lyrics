You can make the sun turn purple
You can make the sea turn turtle
But you know you can never make me love you more

You can turn wine into water
And sadness into laughter
But you know you can never make me love you more

Let the sky fall down
Let the leaves turn brown
Still you know you can never make me love you more

Let the redwoods die
Let the wells turn dry
Still you know you can never make me love you more

You make dew into diamonds
And pacify the lions
But you know you can never make me love you more

You can make me dance to order
My sex hung, torn and quartered
But you know you can never make me love you more

Let the new day hide
Leave the scars inside
Still you know you can never make me love you more

Let the rain pour down
Let the valleys drown
Still you know you can never make me
(hey) you know you can never make me love you more

We can make the sun turn purple
We can make the sea turn turtle
But you know you can never make me love you more

We can turn wine into water
As fathers rape their daughters
But you know you can never make me love you more

Let the sky fall down
Let the leaves turn brown
Still you know you can never make me love you more

Let the redwoods die
As the wells run dry
Still you know you can never make me
(hey) you know you can never make me
(yeah) you know you can never make me love you more
