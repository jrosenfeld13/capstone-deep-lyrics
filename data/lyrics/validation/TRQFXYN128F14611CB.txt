Hi! Nice to see ya
C'mon in, c'mon in
Sorry the place is a mess

Need an ashtray?
Drink some coffee, some coffee
I know you've been upset

What I mean is
Maybe a part of your problem
Is simply, you were teased

I know what you'd like
But the good stuff promised
Is hard fought and not for free

Get tough, don't be so patient
Get smart, head up, shoulders straight
Since when is it a disaster?
If the "S" on your cape is a little frayed?

What's a girl to do?
Born to shop? No! Pretty victories
What's a girl to do?
Scream and screw? No! Pretty victories

Go out jumpin'
With your dumplin', your dumplin'
Go wheelin' with your pet

Never worry
Even a bit, just a bit
If there're any good ones left

Use your credit
At the boybank, the boybank
If those you've bounced, you've broke

Spit out the F-word
Like a shotgun, a shot gun
If they can't take a joke!

Get tough, don't be so patient
Get smart, head up, shoulders straight
Since when is it a disaster?
If the "S" on your cape is a little frayed?

What's a girl to do?
Born to shop? No! Pretty victories
What's a girl to do?
Scream and screw? No! Pretty victories

Starting to see what I mean?

Nice things
Nice things
Oh oh oh, so many nice things
As your biggest fan I want you to have them

Nice things
Nice things
Oh oh oh, so many nice things
Don't mean nothing, if they're dumping
Things that sting on you!
Don't take that, honey!

Don't work your buns off
For a fool, for a fool
Who can barely tie his shoes

Don't answer phone calls
That old boyfriend, old boy friend
Would love to see you lose

You don't need that!
When your girlfriend, your girlfriend
Falls for all these creeps

Can you tell her?
Take the cure, take the cure
Love is obsolete? Maybe!

Get tough, don't be so patient
Get smart, head up, shoulders straight
Since when is it a disaster?
If the "S" on your cape is a little frayed?

What's a girl to do?
Born to shop? No! Pretty victories
What's a girl to do?
Scream and screw? No! Pretty victories

What's a girl to do?
Born to shop? No! Pretty victories
What's a girl to do?
Scream and screw? No! Pretty victories

Starting to see what I mean?
Sure, stop by anytime
Will yesterday be better?
I think you'll do just fine!
