If I had money I'd go wild buy you furs dress you like a queen
And in a chauffered limousine
We'd look so fine
But I'm an ordinary guy and my pockets are empty
Just an ordinary guy
But I'm yours till I die

I can't give you anything
But my love
But my love
I can't give you anything
But my love
But my love

I cannot promise you the world
Can't afford any fancy things
I cannot buy you diamond rings
No string of pearls
But my devotion I will give all my life just to you girl
My devotion I will give for as long as I live

I can't give you anything. but my love. but my love . .
