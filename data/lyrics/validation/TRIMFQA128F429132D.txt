What changed the look in his eyes what made the change in his heart
What changed his mind about the love we had what's tearing us apart
What's come over my baby he's not the same as before
What's come over my baby my baby don't love me anymore

Can it be his old love is back again or has he found someone new
Can it be with time he's just grown tired of me what our love come into
What's come over my baby...
