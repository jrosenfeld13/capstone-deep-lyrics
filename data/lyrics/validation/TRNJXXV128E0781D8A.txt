[Verse 1]
You get the burn
We're on the train
I feel no pain
I feel no pain
You set the sights
But i'm already there
Do you care?
Do you care?

[Chorus]
I can't get it out of my head
When you said
I'm gonna leave

[Verse 2]
I felt surprised
That you wanted to know
Where the geese go to
Late at night
I'm feeling fine
What is it inside
It's inside

[Chorus]
And i can't get it out of my head
When he said
I'm leaving
