Downtown is like a slot machine
Shine neon signs and stoplights turn to green
Sit down, the moon is in my hair
It shines upon the rainfall in the air

I see you everyday
I watch you as you talk away
I often think of things to say
But I just watch you as you walk away

Cross-town the street is like a stream
Asphalt and people driving in a dream
Slow down, the moon is in my eyes
It shines upon the rainfall by the roadside

The rainfall
The rain falls down on the ground
It's down on the ground

The rainfall
The rainfall's bringing me down
It's bringing me down
