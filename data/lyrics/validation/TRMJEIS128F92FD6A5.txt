(Andy Sears)
The tighter the turn
The harder the means of escape
The deeper the nail
The stronger the coffin we make
You're free--glory
Hope you'll find silence
The biggest attraction
The hardest the habit to break
The sharper the needle
The lesser the mark that we make
In my heart is something
More precious than gold
You know something
I love you--
Take it all
Young hearts in pain
Look to the rain--
So lonely--
Nothing to say
Cloudy and grey
The louder the brave
The darker the secrets they fear
The weaker the mind
The stronger the voice will appear
Oh you'll get over glory
Song of joy today is gold
All this time what have we solved
Circle on circle of
Young hearts in pain
Look to the rain--
So lonely--
Nothing to say
Cloudy and grey
Sleep tight
Tired of learning--
How are you?
Sleep tight
Tired of learning--
How are you?
There may be times
I dream away
Young hearts in pain
Look to the rain--
So lonely--
Nothing to say
Cloudy and grey
So lonely--
Young hearts in pain
Who's going to take your nightmares away
They're going to take you for one last song
So lonely--
