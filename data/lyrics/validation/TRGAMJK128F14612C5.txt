I wanna march with the band of the promised land
March with the band of the Lord
I wanna march with the band of the promised land
March with the band of the Lord

I'm lookin' forward to the great, great day
The day that I can march with pride
To the cadence of his mighty, migty voice
With the angels by my side

I wanna march with the band of the promised land
March with the band of the Lord
I wanna march with the band of the promised land
March with the band of the Lord

Glory be to my Lord above
Hallelujah all the way
Shine upon me with your heavenly advice
So I can be with you someday

I wanna march with the band of the promised land
March with the band of the Lord
I wanna march with the band of the promised land
March with the band of the Lord
I wanna march to that, that promised land
March with the band of the Lord
I wanna march to that land, oh that, that promised land
March with the band of the Lord
Yes, march with the band of the Lord
Oh, march with the band of the Lord
Yes, march with the band of the Lord
