On a childhood highway through a night alone
I was barely breathing, I was crawling home
Well it's not quite London or the south of France
Or an Asian island or a second chance

Going back to Nashville, thinking about the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train rolling down a mountain
Watching all my life go by

You're a distant memory, you're an exit sign
I was talking crazy on the driver's side
And I know I hurt you but I can't confess
Was that blood or a wine stain on your wedding dress?

Going back to Nashville, thinking about the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train rolling down a mountain
Watching all my life go by

Going back to Nashville, laughing at a bad break
What's the use in wondering why?
Baby, I'm a storm front blowing through the valley
Tearing up a good July

And it's safe and warm where nothing ever happens
Would it be so hard to realign a star or two?
Change a southern night for you

Well it's not quite evening and it's not New York
There's a scar in the blue sky by the old airport
And I'm talking crazy on the driver's side
I will always love you like a long goodbye
