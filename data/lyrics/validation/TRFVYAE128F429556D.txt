Darlin' darlin'
If I could have you to call my very own
I work my fingers to the bone, I am alone
To you I'd always come home

'Cause there's something about you, baby
That makes me keep loving you
There's something about you, baby
Makes me love you just a little bit more
Truly does, just a little bit more

Sweet sweet thing, I'm satisfied
Sweet sweet thing, you set my soul on fire
I need you, yeah, badly
I know what price I have to pay
'Cause without you, darlin', I'd worry hard
I love you anyway

'Cause there's something about you, baby
That makes me keep loving you
There's something about you, baby
Makes me love you just a little bit more
Truly does, just a little bit more

Sweet sweet thing, I'm satisfied
Sweet sweet thing, you're my only desire

I'm just yours puppet on a string
And tears sometimes it brings
Do me any way you wanna when you wanna
I'll keep you just the same

'Cause there's something about you, baby
That makes me keep loving you
There's something about you, baby
Makes me love you just a little bit more
Truly does, just a little bit more

You're a real heartbreaker
You will never let me sit down
There's something about you, baby
That shakes me all up inside
You're a real heartbreaker
But I need you just the same
