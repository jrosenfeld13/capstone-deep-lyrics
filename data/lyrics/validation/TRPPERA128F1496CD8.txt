I thought the fight was over
All battles won
I thought you'd lit your blindfolds
Watch them burn
I thought that I could show you
All that I've found
But barriers dictate all sight and all sound

I found love in the loneliest places
Places I shouldn't have found
I found love in the home of a sinner
Wrapped in some bitter sweet song
Let me tell the truth
Let me come alive
Let me build bridges into your life
I'm sick of being born
Again and again
I don't need conditions to let you in

Have you noticed how we talk and how
We play our games
A leather bound appeal to
Change our ways
All I wanted was to show you
All that I've found
No answers, no exits, no prophecy bound

But I found love in the loneliest places
Places I shouldn't have found
I found love in the home of a sinner
Wrapped in some bitter sweet song
Oh, let me tell the truth
And let me come alive
Let me build bridges into your life
I'm sick of being born again and again
I don't need conditions to let you in

I never meant to hurt you or
Drive you away
The barriers we've built, looks like there
Here to stay
