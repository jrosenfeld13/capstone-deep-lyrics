Dying over and over in my mind
As you twist the knife I wonder why
Why you bothered to take this time
Too concerned with yours I should think of mine
Do you sleep alone thinking of me (I can see)
While I sit alone wondering what could be (while I dream)
Do you lay with another but not with me (you've never been alone)
I sit alone because you're not with me (you're not with me)
My pain is all inside
Until razor and arm collide
From my heart upon the floor
Take my blood but you take more
Do you sleep alone thinking of me (I can see)
While I sit alone wondering what could be (while I dream)
Do you lay with another but not with me (you've never been alone)
I sit alone because you're not with me (you're not with me)
Take my life, you take more
Of my life, take some more
Just let me die
Dying over and over in my mind
As you twist the knife I wonder why
Why you bothered to take this time
Too concerned with yours I should think of mine
Do you sleep alone thinking of me (I can see)
While I sit alone wondering what could be (while I dream)
Do you lay with another but not with me (you've never been alone)
I sit alone because you're not with me (you're not with me)
Of my life, take some more
