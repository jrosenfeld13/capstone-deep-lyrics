Do you wanna hear a story?
Let me take away what I left in you
Even though I lost my chances
I guess that's what I might go through
Can't deny what's getting wasted
It's not enough to keep me there
Even though I stumble down
It's all for the best

And when I go away it'll be too late
It seems the thing that I would do
Didn't really mean to hurt you
I just got out from what you think

I'm getting nervous and pretentious
A few more things that lead to insanity
Even though it is obsession
I guess I'll pick it up for you

I'm growing tired of little chances
It's not that hard to understand
It's all about reaching out and grab my hand

And when I go away it'll be too late
It seems the thing that I would do
Didn't really mean to hurt you
I just got out from what you think

Can't deny what's getting wasted
It's not enough to keep me there
Even though I stumble down
It's all for the best

And when I go away it'll be too late
It seems the thing that I would do
Didn't really mean to hurt you
I just got out from what you think
