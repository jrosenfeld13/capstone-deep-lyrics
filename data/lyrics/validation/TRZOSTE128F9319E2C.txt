No time to run, permission to go, times running in
With troops, and bombs, and guns
From the left and right, people are fighting
Screaming, shooting, fighting, hanging from the ground
One, two, call the death squad
War is business, war is business
Arrogate, fall out, stand in line
Why do our lives have to go with indecisions
We have permission to take, to decide, to fight!
More and more fighting its making me sick
We fought with them, the rich don't have to fight
One two call the death squad
War is business, war is business
Death squad, collision, finish this
As long as we are here you won't need to worry
Just close your eyes, decide, think on your own
Can you hear bodies their f*cking dead in the streets
Just close your eyes, and you will think and see
One two call the death squad
War is business, war is business
Arrogate, fall out, stand in line
