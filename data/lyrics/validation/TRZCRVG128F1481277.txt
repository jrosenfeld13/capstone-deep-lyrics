How many nights, how many days, do I wait here for you?
Have you long forgotten all the things we'd said
And how many times must I let the phone ring, just to get to you
Could it be that now this love is long gone dead
Oh, no, no, the way hasn't been so long
No, I'm sure your feelin's gone and then
(Love, love feels like a ball and chain)
What a fool I've been to fall in love again
(Love, love, when will it ever end?)
And I don't think that I can ever love again
Well, how many nights, have I stayed by the phone?
Just to hear from you, could it be that I just wanna hear you say
That all of this time, you'd been thinkin' alone
Wonderin' what to do and that "I love you" is all you wanna say
No, the way, it hasn't been so long
No, I'm sure your feelin's gone and then
(Love, love feels like a ball and chain)
What a fool I've been to fall in love again!
(Love, love, when will it ever end?)
Well, I don't think that I can ever love again
No, no, I'm sure your feelin's gone and then
(Love, love feels like a ball and chain)
What a fool I've been to fall in love again
(Love, love, when will it ever end?)
And I don't think that I can ever love again
I don't think that I can ever love again
'Cuz your love feels like a ball and chain
