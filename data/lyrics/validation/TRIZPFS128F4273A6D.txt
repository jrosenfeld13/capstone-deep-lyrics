Can't you kindly hide it
Can't you make it can't grow weaker
Can't you push it harder
Push it hard so you can't see
No need to sleep
I need to rest
Can't you kindly hide it
Can't you make it can't grow weaker
Can't you push it harder

I can be hard...
No need to sleep
No need to rest
Just one could kill the pain
No need to sleep
No need to rest
Just one could kill the pain
The end point of zero
