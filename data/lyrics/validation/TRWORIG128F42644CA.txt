Land sakes alive, the steak's alive
Give him a hug and he drinks and
He drives
Why the long face Mr.Ed? It's
The hour of darkness and
The hour of dread

Hey Betty

Find 'em and grind 'em and
Never remind 'em
Biscuits and jam you're
Eating your pie too. Minor legends

And you're right too
Give 'em a hug
