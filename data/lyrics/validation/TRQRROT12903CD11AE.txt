Feat. Xaviera Gold
I remember when you would say
That you'd love me in every way
You loved me once, you loved me twice
But my boy hasn't been so nice
You used to hold me
You used to feel me
You used to kiss me
You used to touch me
You used to please me
You used to squeeze me
You used to love me
You used to touch me
Ohhhh wouh
Baby Baby I miss you so much
When you hold me with that loving touch
You gotta know how you make me feel
For all these years has it been for me
Yeahhhh
You used to hold me
You used to feel me
You used to kiss me
You used to touch me
You used to please me
You used to squeeze me
You used to love me
You used to touch me
Now honey let me tell you something about my man
You know he's a good looking sweet lil' thing
That man knows how to satisfy a woman
You know what I'm talking about?
Girlfriend let me tell you
He bought me this fur coat
A brand new car and this 24 karat gold diamond ring
Ain't it pretty?
Girfriend you know how it is
When you got a good man
You start doin' things like wearing those high heel shoes
And the lace pocket with the garter belt
And putting on that sweet smellin' seductive perfume
Hm hmm
But you know what?
I'm gonna have to put some lame brain in check honey
Cause she got her locks on my man
But baby I ain't givin up ON THIS HEAR good thing not for nobody
Cause what that dorky chic GOT wouldn't satisfy a cheese stick let alone my baby
She better take her big long haired butt and move on cause he's mine all mine!
Move On, All All All All Mine!
You used to hold me
You used to feel me
You used to kiss me
You used to touch me
You used to please me
You used to squeeze me
You used to love me
You used to touch me
