Hang on the falling edge of reason
Everyone is upside-down and inside-out
Your bed is missing, the keys are gone

In a perfect world
The perfect place is with you

Under delicate breath...

In a perfect world, there are perfect places with you
But the truth is, the world is without love
In a perfect world, the perfect place is with you
The truth is, the world is without love

In a perfect world, the perfect place is with you
The truth is, the world is without love
In a perfect world, where perfect place is with you
The truth is, the world is without...
