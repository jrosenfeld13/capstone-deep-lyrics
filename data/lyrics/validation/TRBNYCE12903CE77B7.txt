In the taxi
Spit the bad seed
Spit the bad seed
He came out to testify
Rip the black jean
With his gold teeth
In the back seat
He came out to testify

I'm not a follower
Don't want to follow her
Don't want a piece of the pie
Where I land I don't care
I don't need a plan
One night at a time

Who kicks open every door lately?
He can't stop
He can't stop fighting
Who says, "I won't leave 'til you make me?"
He can't stop
He can't stop losing a round

Looks like me
Dressed like me
Just like me
Looks like me
Dressed like me
Just like me

In the back seat of the taxi
He came out to testify
In the back seat of the taxi
Kept saying, "Who am I?"
In the back seat of the taxi
He came out to testify
In the back seat of the taxi
Said not to move, he's fine

Don't play with drugs in your bloodstream
Don't play with bugs for your bad dreams

I'm gonna hold my breath 'til you come back clean
Gonna hold my breath 'til you come back clean
Gonna hold my breath 'til you come back clean
Gonna hold my breath 'til you come back clean
Gonna hold my breath 'til you come back clean

In the taxi
Spit the bad seed
Spit the bad seed
Rip the black jean
With his gold teeth
In the back seat

(Make it up)
(Hold my breath)
(Where I land I don't care, I don't need a plan)
(I don't give a damn, I don't need a plan)

Don't play with drugs in your bloodstream
(Gonna hold my breath 'til you come back clean)

Come back to us when you come clean
