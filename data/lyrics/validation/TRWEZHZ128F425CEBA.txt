I hope the castle's clean
For your man, he'll be home soon
And I hope his lies come clean

CHORUS
Leave the light on he'll be home by 11
Just leave the light on he'll be home by 11

Will you be there when his ship comes in
He'll bring you pure silk
And some sweet perfume
While the mandolin plays he'll dance you
'Round the room

CHORUS

Will you be there when his ship sets off
For the call of the sea is much too strong
His answer will be a kiss, a wave
And a soft good bye

CHORUS
