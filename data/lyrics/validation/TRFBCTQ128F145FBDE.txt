Come on now mister
Step right inside and see the show
You'll like it mister
It cures you if you're feeling low
We'll take care of you
Especially if you've got the dough

They'll move you mister
Just like a hurricane moves a tree
See here now mister
Just look at what they've done for me
You're gonna like it
They'll take you where you wanna be

Alright now mister
Come in and join the other guys
Just one thing mister
Don't try to touch the merchandise
Or get too friendly
You know that wouldn't be too wise

Come on now mister
Step right inside and see the show
You'll like it mister
It cures you if you're feeling low
We'll take care of you
Especially if you've got the dough
