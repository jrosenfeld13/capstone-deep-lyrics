Tell me when the work is done
Tell me when the day is through
And I'll drive safely inside my car
Taking islands in Africa

Shout if someone gets too near
I'll know just what I ought to do
And I'll arrive safely in my car
Taking islands in Africa

Now your feet are back on the ground again
She'll say the weather's dim
But relax my love, relax and swing
And swing

Things you say are not too clear
I'm someone you'll neither know nor care
But I'll sit here and watch from afar
Taking islands in Africa

Now your feet are back on the ground again
She'll say the weather's dim
But relax my love, relax and swing
Whisper in the wind
