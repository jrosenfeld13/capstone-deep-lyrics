Sutton

It's Late and she's Waiting
And I know I should go Home
But ev'ry Time I start to Leave
They play another Song
Then someone Buys another Round
And wherever Drinks are Free
What's Made Milwaukee Famous
Has made a Fool out of Me

CHORUS
Baby's Begged me not to Go
So many Times Be-[5]-fore
She said Love and Happiness
Just Can't live Behind those Swinging Doors
Now she's Gone and I'm to Blame
Too late, I Finally See
What's Made Milwaukee Famous
Has made a Loser out of Me

REPEAT CHORUS

TAG:
What's Made Milwaukee Famous
