So let it be felt
Aftermath
Shades of hell
I set them free
But struggle
Eternally

It's too late now
To turn the clock around
Frozen world outside
Made by foolish pride

Time to mend
Your life begins
Breathe for me
Make me feel
I'm not alone

Rowen
Final stunt
Will the blood shed
End at once
Rowen
Is no doubt
Life in limbo
Is our home now

Rowen
Final stunt
Will the blood shed
End at once
Rowen
Is no doubt
Life in limbo
Is our home
