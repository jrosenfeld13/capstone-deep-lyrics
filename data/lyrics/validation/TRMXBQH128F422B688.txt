[Verse 1]
Two shades of blue
Chime in the morning time
How do you do?

[Verse 2]
The two best hours
Are separated by night
Before after
And still entwined
Two shades of blue

[Bridge]
When the wicket space cow appended the candle generator
We saw that a flame in zero gravity is cooler and steadier
A perfectly round flame
A candle in the windlessness is cooler and more blue

[Verse 3]
Two shades of blue
Chime
How do you do?
Two shades of blue
Two shades of blue will do
Two shades of blue
Two shades of blue
Two shades of blue will do
Two shades of blue
