No way, I say no way
You can't put me down
I know who you are
I know what you want

You can say anything
You can do everything
I don't care anymore
'cause you need to know
That

No
One
Else
Only god can judge me

I am all your thoughts
'cause you're so envy
You just fuck up your energy
Cause you need to know
That

No
One
Else
Only god can judge me
