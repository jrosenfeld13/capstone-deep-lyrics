(Verse 1)
Hello David, as I was walkin' by
Hesitated and then I realized
'There go David'
I was surprised to see you
And I asked 'Do you remember me?'
Boy I'm so elated to run into you here
Shadow faded with diamonds in your ears
The memories that go, I don't wanna let go
Hear you say you got a girlfriend, but I know

(Hook)
She don't even touch you like this
She don't even kiss you like this
She don't even treat you like I do
Boy you know that
She don't even touch you like this
She don't even kiss you like this
She don't even treat you like I do
Boy

(Verse 2)
Ooh, I see us makin' plans
Me and you, forget your circumstance
Don't be actin' like me and you don't go way back
Late night tippin' in yo Cadillac
See I'm no psychic, but I can understand
She's a sidekick, but I know all your fantasies
She can't do it to you like I used to
And you know that I know
That she can't do you like I do, whoa

(Hook)
She don't even touch you like this
She don't even kiss you like this
She don't even treat you like I do
Boy you know that
She don't even touch you like this
She don't even kiss you like this
She don't even treat you like I do
Boy you know that

(Bridge)
Look at me and tell me you ain't feelin' me
Boy you know that I'm the one you need
(oh-oh-oh)
She's a waste of time, I can love you right
(Boy you know that)
I already know you want it personal
So there ain't no need to take it slow
(oh-oh-oh)
You know your best is your first
So tell me why you're with her

(Hook)
She don't even touch you like this
She don't even kiss you like this
She don't even treat you like I do
Boy you know that
She don't even touch you like this
She don't even kiss you like this
She don't even treat you like I do
Boy you know that

She don't even touch you like this
She don't even kiss you like this
She don't even treat you like I do
Boy you know that
She don't even touch you like this
She don't even kiss you like this
She don't even treat you like I do
Boy you know that
