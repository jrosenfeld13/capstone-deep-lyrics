I am the bad one
Distant and cruel one
I am the dream that
Keeps you running down

With distraction
Violent reaction
Scars of my actions
Watch me running out

Hell doesn't want them
Hell doesn't need them
Hell doesn't love them
The Devil's rejects
The Devil's rejects

Yeah, I am the brains
Some say insane
Blood is the rain
That's what life's about

In the great wide
Head split and tongue tied
Watch the sun die
When you're running out

Hell doesn't want them
Hell doesn't need them
Hell doesn't love them
The Devil's rejects
The Devil's rejects

Yeah I am the knuckle
Bow down and buckle
Hold your breath
Your world is running down

Live for the family
Die with the family
All is the family
My gun is running out

Hell doesn't want them
Hell doesn't need them
Hell doesn't love them
This world rejects them
This world rejects them
This world rejects them
This world rejects them
The Devil's rejects
The Devil's rejects
