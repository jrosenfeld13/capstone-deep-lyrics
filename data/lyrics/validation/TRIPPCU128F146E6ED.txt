The ungrateful few who tangle inside
Don't care where they're born, they're growin' up wild
The rain makes me thirsty and fightin' to go
My mind turns determined, dark as a storm

So my love has, grown as sharp as, a bramble rose
Like a real good woman nobody knows

I get so ashamed for makin' you blue
I come back to this porch to make it all up to you
The rain's got me thirsty, falling wasteful and slow
I'm restless enough. I'm so scared to go

So my love has, turned as hard as, a bramble rose
I'm a real good woman nobody knows

Do you think I'll be happy out on the wind?
Do you think I'll get halfway 'fore it's rainin' again?
Will I find that I'm true when it's hardest to be?
Or will the notions I follow have all turned on me?

Once my love has, blown as far as, a bramble rose
Just a real good woman nobody knows
