Are you ready, Heidi?
Uh hum
Keisha?
Yeah, Amelle?
Oh yeah! Let's go!

Keisha:
You're messed up from your chromosomes to your enzymes
Remember the time when you took my ride?

Amelle:
I had to get it from the impound
My favorite rims were gone
And later when I asked you bout it you just said "yeah"

Heidi:
But then at least you didn't crash
If you had some cash
Left from selling my rims in the car
Parked behind the bar

All:
And baby that's you on a good day
And baby that's you on a good day
Disaster is always just a beat away
But baby I'm sticking with you anyway

Heidi:
You messed up like when I went to Tokyo for promotion
And got back, I had a bill for two G's

Keisha:
And when you fell asleep
Calling me overseas
Asking bout my code for the cash machine
And you just said "yeah"

Amelle:
But you tried to keep the house neat
But then your new party friends went
And called for some stripper again
I just said fine

All:
And baby that's you on a good day
And baby that's you on a good day
Disaster is always just a beat away
But baby I'm sticking with you anyway

And baby that's you on a good day
And baby that's you on a good day
Disaster is always just a beat away
But baby I'm sticking with you anyway

Keisha:
Ladies, oooh ooh
Ooooh oooh
Let me get the beat

All:
I want it, I hate it, I need it
I want it, want it, want it
I hate it, I want it, I need it
I hate it, I want it, I need it

Amelle:
But you tried to keep the house near
But then your new party friends went
And called for some stripper again
I just said 'you're gonna make it up to me, you know you are'

All:
And baby that's you on a good day
And baby that's you on a good day
Disaster is always just a beat away
But baby I'm sticking with you anyway

And baby that's you on a good day
And baby that's you on a good day
Disaster is always just a beat away
But baby I'm sticking with you anyway

And baby that's you on a good day
And baby that's you on a good day
Disaster is always just a beat away
But baby I'm sticking with you anyway
