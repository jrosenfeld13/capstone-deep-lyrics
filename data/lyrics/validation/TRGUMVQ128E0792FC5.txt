I swear to you - I will always be there for you - There's nothin' I won't do
I promise you - All my life I will live for you - We will make it through

Forever - We will be
Together - You and me
Oh and when I hold ya - Nothin' can compare
With all of my heart - Ya know I'll always be right there

I believe in us - Nothin' else could ever mean so much
You're the one I trust
Our time has come - We're not two people now we are one
Yeah you're second to none

Forever - We will be
Together - A family
The more I get to know ya - Nothin' can compare
With all of my heart - Ya know I'll always be right there

Forever - We will be
Together - Oh just you and me
The more I get to know ya - The more I really care
With all of my heart - Ya know I'll always be
Ya know I really love ya - Nothin' can compare
For all of my life - Ya know I'll always be
Right there
