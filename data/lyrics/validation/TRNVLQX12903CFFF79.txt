I LET YOU UNDER MY SKIN
THE POISON STOPS ME FROM BREATHING
INJECT THE SOUL TILL I SPIN
YOUR HEART ATTACKS WITHOUT HEALING

SAVE ME
FROM THE DARKNESS SWALLOWING YOUR LIFE
AND IM A SLAVE TO YOUR NEEDLE
WHEN YOU DOMINATE MY MIND

YOU ACT LIKE YOUR A STAR
BUT NO ONE KNOWS JUST WHO YOU ARE
IM TIRED OF BEING ALONE EVERYDAY
IM ON MY KNEES, THERES NOWHERE LEFT TO FALL
AND YOU SAY, YOU WANTED TO BE
SOMETHING MORE THAN JUST AN ENEMY

SAVE ME
FROM THE DARKNESS SWALLOWING YOUR LIFE
AND IM A SLAVE TO YOUR NEEDLE
WHEN YOU DOMINATE MY MIND
SAVE ME
OH WONT YOU SAVE ME
ARE YOU FEELING ALIVE
ARE YOU FEELING ALIVE
ARE YOU FEELING ALIVE

INTO NOTHING I WILL STUMBLE

SAVE ME
FROM THE DARKNESS SWALLOWING YOUR LIFE
AND IM A SLAVE TO YOUR NEEDLE
WHEN YOU DOMINATE MY MIND
SAVE ME
OH C'MON WONT YOU SAVE ME
ARE YOU FEELING ALIVE

ARE YOU FEELING ALIVE
ARE YOU FEELING ALIVE
