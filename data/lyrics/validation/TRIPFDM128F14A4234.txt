I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment you passed by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye
My heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the flame of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me
It's foolish to start
For that old feeling is still in my heart
