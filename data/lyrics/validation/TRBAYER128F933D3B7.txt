(Dicky Barrett/Nate Albert)

Police have no suspects yet
Both women have been shot twice in the head
Gang violence in Boston
No parent has planned that their children would leave them on this earth through violence
Arrrgghhh
Hey whats the big idea? Why don't you look where you're
Police are on full alert
357 magnum 9 millimeter handgun A-K 47 and an UZI sub machine gun(4x)
You see it on TV, you know it looks cool
All these actors going around killing thousands of people
In two or three minutes, it builds up in your head and you say
"yo I can do that" just stand facing a wall
Your enemies are all around you
You can feel the tension, right behind you

Everybody's trying to take Take!
Take over my spot, people just trying to take Take!
Take what I got see if I'm strapped, they can't get to me
Everybody's afraid of each other
You make enemies so easily just hangin' on the corner
Gang violence in Boston(4x) Nathan!
Chains snatched a couple of times, shoes off your feet
Feel like you've got to arm yourself to protect yourself
Chains snatched a couple of times, shoes off your feet
Feel like you've got to arm yourself to protect yourself
Help (8x)
What do you do if someone's packin'?
What the hell can one man do?
What do you do if he's crackin'?
Hope he can't shoot straight?
