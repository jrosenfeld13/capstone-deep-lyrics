When the girl in your arms
Is the girl in you heart
Then you have got everything
When you are holding the dream
You have been dreaming you would hold
You're as rich as a king
So hold her tight
And never let her go
Day and night
Let her know
You love her so
With the love of your life
Spend the lifetime of love
Make her yours for evermore
So hold her tight
And never let her go
Day and night
Let her know
You love her so
With the love of your life
Spend the lifetime of love
Make her yours for evermore
Make her yours for evermore
