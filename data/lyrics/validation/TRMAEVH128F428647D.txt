Disappointing change in seasons
Cold has come again
Streets are flooded with excuses
Stories never end
People walk in their dillusion
Wading through despair
We must come to stand as one
And take the cross they bare

So we'll try not to cry
When we are
Walkin' in their shoes
Have you heard the news?

Hey (hey), have you seen
The blind man in disguise
Lookin' for his eyes
Hey (hey), have you seen
The rain man lookin' to the sky
Beggin' for sunlight
The darkest times
Ain't always at night

A man will hold a sign and preach
This world will not stand
We are all among the scared
So will you hold my hand

So we'll try not to cry
When we are
Walkin' in their shoes
Have you heard the news?

Hey (hey), have you seen
The blind man in disguise
Lookin' for his eyes
Hey (hey), have you seen
The rain man lookin' to the sky
Beggin' for sunlight
The darkest times
Ain't always at night

-Solo-

So we'll try not to cry
When we are
Walkin' in their shoes
Have you heard the news?

Hey (hey), have you seen
The blind man in disguise
Lookin' for his eyes
Hey (hey), have you seen
The rain man lookin' to the sky
Beggin' for sunlight
The darkest times
Ain't always at night
