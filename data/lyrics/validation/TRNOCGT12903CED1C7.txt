[Verse 1]
Talk to myself again, all alone, on my own
Walk by the scene again, just to see what people see
Caught in your stubborn hold, and I'm so far from home

[Chorus]
So turn the lights on, turn the lights on
Turn the lights on for me
Keep the lights on, keep the lights on
Keep the lights on for me
Don't go to sleep

[Verse 2]
Lost in your thoughts again, consciously you think of me
Focus your perfect words with a pen you write me in
I can't be reached, so far from here, I need you near

[Chorus]
So turn the lights on, turn the lights on
Turn the lights on for me
Keep the lights on, keep the lights on
Keep the lights on for me
Don't go to sleep

[Bridge]
Don't go to sleep
I wait for you, I stay for you

[Chorus]
So turn the lights on, turn the lights on
Turn the lights on for me
Keep the lights on, keep the lights on
Keep the lights on for me
Don't go to sleep

[Outro]
Don't go to sleep
I wait for you, I stay for you
