You hear the buzzin' of the machine, the ink's locked and loaded
Time to get another piece and just right before the needle hits your skin
You feel a calm taking over, you're in a state of peace thanks alot to the doja
The session starts, seconds turn to minutes, minutes turn to hours
But no stopping 'til its finished. the pain is pleasure, instantly gratified
The end result will be with you 'til the day you die
(D-LOC)
Roll a joint, see the point, take a hit, there it is
Got that bomb ass chronic, let my high set in
In the chair is where I sit, leaning back
Getting tagged on my neck and my chest got the color green and black
Sub Core represent, gimmie love up on the dab
Let me stop at my pad, hit me up, I hit 'em back
The tats going down, it's all coming over
Kingspade For Life on my back and on my shoulders

(CHORUS)
That's what its like being tattooed
Feeling pain as it pulses right through you
Permanent for life, it's now a part of you
Inked up forever, never coulda felt better
And that's what it's like being tattooed
People always stop to stare and interview you
Don't care what people think to me, it's beautiful
Inked up for forever, never coulda felt better(RICHTER)
I got so many tattoos, so many memories
Remember a lot of good times, built a lot of good friendships
It's a pure expression of ones self of the world
Remembering the love of a portrait of your little girl
(D-LOC)
When you ride by my side, it's goin' down
Seein a picture of your face on my arm its never mocked
Together forever through the ink thats whats up
I got your smile on my skin, everyday I get the love
(RICHTER)
And that's how I felt at the moment that I got it
Just to let you know that you'd never be forgotten
Everytime I look at that part of my body
You'll always gonna be there, always right beside me
(D-LOC)
Can't forget about the time I was sittin in the chair
With my head drippin' off like the world don't care
Talkin' representin for life, lets do it hold tight
Tonight's the night, stick a needle in my skin

(CHORUS)
That's what its like being tattooed
Feeling pain as it pulses right through you
Permanent for life, it's now a part of you
Inked up forever, never coulda felt better
And that's what it's like being tattooed
People always stop to stare and interview you
Don't care what people think to me, it's beautiful
Inked up for forever, never coulda felt better
(RICHTER)
I catch alotta eye balls thrown in my direction
For being tattooed from my toes to neck
And it doesnt bother me, if does to yourself
But if it does go to hell, I got a pocket full of wealth
(D-LOC)
Yeah, let's take a trip to big bear
Take a pill, drink a beer, get a tat up there
Repped a hill, go see bill and nandra
People that always wandered back to shop down yonda

(CHORUS)
That's what its like being tattooed
Feeling pain as it pulses right through you
Permanent for life, it's now a part of you
Inked up forever, never coulda felt better
And that's what it's like being tattooed
People always stop to stare and interview you
Don't care what people think to me, it's beautiful
Inked up for forever, never coulda felt better
That's what its like being tattooed
Feeling pain as it pulses right through you
Permanent for life, it's now a part of you
Inked up forever, never coulda felt better
And that's what it's like being tattooed
People always stop to stare and interview you
Don't care what people think to me, it's beautiful
Inked up for forever, never coulda felt better
That's what its like being tattooed
Feeling pain as it pulses right through you
Permanent for life, it's now a part of you
Inked up forever, never coulda felt better
And that's what it's like being tattooed
People always stop to stare and interview you
Don't care what people think to me, it's beautiful
Inked up for forever, never coulda felt better
