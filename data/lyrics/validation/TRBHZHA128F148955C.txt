I mean everything
That falls out my mouth
When I throw my arms around you

I love you like family
I love you like you don't know
When I throw my arms around you

I know I dance like a drunken arse
Every weekend it's my own advice:
Let me drink myself to death
To forget about the rent

Money gets like a twisted snake, hissing
I'll show you more if you meet me here
Come over come over come over here
This is my only tendency
This is all I have left you see
Will you believe me?
Would you believe me?
Now

You think that it's not enough
Well fella I'm all grown up
It's clear that we don't...
Well I'm moving on and up
But I'm still the boy you knew
The boy who threw his arms around you
If I said:

This is my only tendency
This is all I have left you see
Would you believe me?
Would you believe me?

A healthy man with a healthy plan
My kids will think im a healthy dad
When there's nothing I don't care to mention
Nothing I don't care for

Now be my girl, yeah she is my world
Because she is the best bitch I've ever had
Come over come over come over me
And if I said

This is my only Tendency
Would you believe me?
Would you believe me?

Cause I mean everything
That falls out my mouth
I love you like family
I love you like you don't know
But I'm moving on and up
But I'm still the boy you knew
The boy who threw him arms around you
The boy who threw his arms around you
The boy who threw his arms around you
