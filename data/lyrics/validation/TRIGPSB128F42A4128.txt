Close the door of the temple of hope
Bring her all the paraments renew the fire
In the hall
There's no reason to fight for the life
Slowly goes the Queen to the meeting she have
With the snake

With no freedom no joy knew anymore
It was the anguish that long in heart she bore
And the willing to set free her world

[Chorus]
In the field of peace
She purify her soul
She's no mortal, she precious stone
Jackal calls your name
Fairy Queen of gold
You'll be sitting side by side now

Mornin' found the land haggard and worn
Rise the cries from the slaves down on
Their knees they stay now
The sun's dawnin' again and again, the vessel
With the Queen soul is sailing away
On that day

With no freedom no joy knew anymore
It was the anguish that long in heart she bore
And the willing to set free her world
