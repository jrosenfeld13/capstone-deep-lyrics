"I slowly wake up to the conscious world, was i beaten down?
There's bodies everywhere...how could it go so wrong...this place reeks of death
No...it can't be...is it, I found my brother slayed... a sword is plunged right
Through his heart!!!
Suddenly he opens his eyes in a silent glare...he signals me to come close..."

As the smoke has cleared
The dust lays heavy in the air
I wake up covered in blood and sweat
Can't reminisce what really happened

So hold me tight
As my life runs short
Listen now and be strong
There's something you should know
A secret well kept
You're not one of us
You're a dragon's son

The sunset is upon me
Was it all worth, is this the last light i'll see
So take me away...

Never again! Never again!
These sight's before me are for real
Death spreads her wings as far as my eyes can see
Never again! Never again!
These visions haunt me day and night
This day will i always will remember in my graveheart

You can see it in his eyes
And hear it in his voice
When joy's no longer felt
When a heart is empty and closed

The day still echoes in my mind
Those few words cut right through my all
And my world ceased to be
As you killed my inside
I can no longer feel

The sunset is upon me
Was it all worth, is this the last light i'll see
So take me away...

Never again! Never again!
These sight's before me are for real
Death spreads her wings as far as my eyes can see
Never again! Never again!
These visions haunt me day and night
This day i will always will remember in my graveheart

Oh... In my graveheart
