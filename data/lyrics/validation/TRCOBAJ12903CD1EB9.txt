[Verse 1]
She sits in silence, in her midnight world
Her faded pictures, of her dancing girls
Her, distant dreamer, on the seas of time
Her happy memories, dancing through her mind

[Chorus]
In days of romance
She was the queen of dance
She'd dance the night away

[Verse 2]
And as the seasons turn the days to years
She holds her pictures, hears the silent cheers
The days grow lonely for the dancing queen
And now, she dances only in her dreams

[Chorus]
In days of romance
She was the queen of dance
She'd dance the night away, away, away, away

[Instrumental Outro]
