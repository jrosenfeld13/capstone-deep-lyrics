[Verse 1]
I'm high above the city
I'm standing on the ledge
The view from here is pretty
And I step off the edge

[Chorus]
And now I'm fallin', baby
Through the sky, through the sky
I'm fallin', baby, through the sky
It's my callin'
Baby, don't you cry, don't you cry
I'm fallin' down through the sky
Toward the street that I'm from
Oh, Broadway, here I come
Broadway, here I come

[Verse 2]
The pressure it increases
The closer that I get
I could almost go to pieces
But I'm not quite there yet
See I've been bravin' crazy weather
Drownin' out my cries
I'll pull myself together
I'm focused on the prize

[Chorus]
I'm fallin', baby
Through the sky, through the sky
I'm fallin', baby, through the sky
It's my callin'
Baby, don't you cry, don't you cry
I'm fallin' down through the sky
Its a tune you can hum
Oh, Broadway, here I come
Hmm-mm-mm-mmm

[Bridge]
Will I remain the same, or will it change a little bit?
Will I feel broken or totally complete?
Will I retain my name when I'm the biggest, hugest hit?
Or will I blend in with the rest of the street?

[Verse 3]
The people all are pointing
I bet they'd never guess
That the saint that they're anointing
Is frightened of the mess
But even though I fear it
I'm playin' all my cards
Baby, you are gonna hear it
When I give them my regards

[Chorus]
I'm falling, baby
Through the sky, through the sky
I'm fallin', baby, through the sky
It's my calling
Baby, don't you cry, don't you cry
I'm fallin' down through the sky
And I refuse to go numb

Oh, Broadway, here I come
Broadway, here I come
Broadway, here I come
Broadway, Broadway, here I come
Here I come!

And the last thing I hear
As the impact grows near
Is it a scream or a cheer?
Well, never mind, I'll never find out
'Cause Broadway, I am here
