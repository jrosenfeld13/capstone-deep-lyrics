People come and
People go
They take and they give
Build you up
Just to let you down
That's just the way it
Is

All I need is one friend
To get me through the
Day
One friend
That never goes away
Only one friend
To understand
And never let me down

I've been in love
I've been in pain
I'm a sinner
And a saint
No matter where I am
Or what I do
It's you I appreciate

All I need is one friend
To get me through the
Day
One friend
That never goes away
Only one friend
To understand
And never let me down

Can't nobody love you
More than you love
Yourself
And as long as I've got
My one good friend
I don't need nobody else

All I need is one friend
To get me through the
Day
One friend
That never goes away
Only one friend
To understand
And never let me down
