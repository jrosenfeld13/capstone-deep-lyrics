Crawl from my hole
Covered in mud
Force my face up
Towards the sun
Burnt
This happened to me Once before
Now I've let myself go back
Am I there?
Ignore me
Smother me
Forget I even exist
Am I really?
I don't need you
I don't need your help
Leave me down here
Faceless pounded pulp
I know I am
You I shouldn't be
Continue to exist
Under all of this
Rubbing me out
Pushing me down
Is picking me up
Is moving me on
Starving me
Depriving me
Starving me
Depriving me
Leaving me
Out
Stick your neck out
Ignore me
Smother me
Forget I even exist
I don't need you
I don't need your help
Leave me down here
Faceless pounded pulp
I know I am
You I shouldn't be
Continue to exist
Under all of this
Rubbing me out
Pushing me down
Is picking me up
Is moving me on
