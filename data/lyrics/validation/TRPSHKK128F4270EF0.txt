He never minded he never cared he walks with his shirt off he walks
And we stare don't laugh, don't mock, don't snicker don't point, he's happy
To be alive he's happy that's the point} (well i think that) they're all
Called Charlie yet probably not, they're always sweating buckets, skins
Beating red hot, well it's like do you think you'll make it home ok, because
Step after step you'll be digging your grave they're good they got it they
Know what they need life's better for them for them i see, they ignore what
They hate and keep what they like, this time i'm going to do it right - see
Him, in a store walking down the aisle, on his face a great big smile can't
Be certain moveing side to side, celebrating living is his passion and his
Pride out of control, asleep at the wheel, dave's got a friend and his name

Is neil {chorus} (manchester, singing beach, 2:00) a bleached whale he tries
To flip over now, can't, move, sand, what, tries to thrash around while the
Tide starts to move in, god i hope charlie swims now a red bellies floating
Around, all the kids are jumping off him on the beach there's a crowd, he
Doesn't mind in fact i think i see a smile, fatman's playing all the while
Thinking of the time when he thought that no one cared, celebrating apathy
Controlled yet unaware, wondering if people thought that he was dumb and
Slow, maybe i don't know, but i don't think so, slip and slide out on the
Lawn so sad those days are gone, grass stains on all of his clothes, got
Yelled at by his mom well i'm fine now you wonder why now i always had my
Self respect never had a single doubt, never let your words cut through me
Through me, it's those words that took his laughter, it's those words that
Took his pride
It's those words that left you helpless all alone you wonder why (repeat)
{chorus}
