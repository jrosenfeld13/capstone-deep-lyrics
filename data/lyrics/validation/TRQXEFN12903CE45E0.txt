(Lawrence Gowan)
I've got rain in my shoes
Every dime from the bank's been used
And every time I play the lottery - I lose
But I don't care much for the clothes that I wear
I'm never bothered by the length of my hair
Set my sights on finer things
That all a rich man's gold can bring
Out of a deeper hunger
I'm at your door tonight
Out of a deeper hunger - I want you
My work just makes ends meet
I don't live on the best of streets
In my rusty car the picture's quite complete
But don't be fooled by this appearance you see
'Cause there is one thing sure to motivate me
Maybe since I'm not impressed
By common measures of success
Out of a deeper hunger
I'm at your door tonight
Out of a deeper hunger - I want you
Under this exterior
There's a deeper world - ball of fire
And I knew when I looked at you
You got something to bring me higher
Set my sights on finer things
That all a rich man's gold can bring
Out of a deeper hunger
I'm at your door tonight
Out of a deeper hunger, baby
That's burning in me
Where it never felt so empty
Out of a deeper hunger - I want you
Out of a deeper hunger - I want you
Out of a deeper hunger - I want you
