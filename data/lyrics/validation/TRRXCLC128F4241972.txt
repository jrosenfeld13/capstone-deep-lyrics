Well I'm an angry man, I sing an angry song
Tell you honey it won't be long
Well I'll pack my bags, get outa here
With my guitar and a case o' beer
Well I'm goin' north and I'm goin' south
Tell you honey, better shut you're mouth
Well I'll kick your head from here to hell
You better know I can do it well

Midnight train, ramblin', ramblin'
All night long I'm a-gamblin', gamblin'
Losin' all my money well it really is funny, hon
Midnight train, ramblin', ramblin'
All night long I'm a-gamblin', gamblin'
Tell you what'n baby well you better be movin' on

Well I really don't know where I'm goin' for sure
Ain't got a map, and it ain't no tour
I'm just headin' out for the open sky
Who knows? Might even die
Well don't you worry your pretty little head
I never give a damn what I did or said
That's why I'm packin' to leave this place
Can't stand look at your cheatin' face

Midnight train, ramblin', ramblin'
All night long I'm a-gamblin', gamblin'
Losin' all my money well it really is funny, hon
Midnight train, ramblin', ramblin'
All night long I'm a-gamblin', gamblin'
Tell you what'n baby well you better be movin' on

Well you treated me like a little boy
And you played around like I was a toy
I guess you thought I'd have the blues
Look who's cryin', guess you lose

Midnight train, ramblin', ramblin'
All night long I'm a-gamblin', gamblin'
Losin' all my money well it really is funny, hon
Midnight train, ramblin', ramblin'
All night long I'm a-gamblin', gamblin'
Tell you what'n baby well you better be movin' on

Midnight train, rambling, rambling
All night long I'm gambling, gambling
Losing all my money, well it really ain't so funny, hon
Midnight train, rambling, rambling
All night long I'm gambling, gambling
Tell you what'n baby, well you better be moving on

Midnight train, ramblin', ramblin'
All night long I'm a-gamblin', gamblin'
Losin' all my money well it really is funny, hon
Midnight train, ramblin', ramblin'
All night long I'm a-gamblin', gamblin'
Tell you what'n baby well you better be movin' on

It's about that time, better be movin' on
Get outa here, you better be movin' on
Well that's all she wrote, you better be movin' on
