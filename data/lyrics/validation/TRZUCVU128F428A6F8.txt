Time, no time
For pointless emotion
It's never helped me in this life
Oh life, if thats what you call it
But I've been thinkin'

As I sit here
I'm not feeling or dreaming or smiling
Forget what was...
And I cry out, is this life?
...is this life?
Is this life?
Is this life?

Want, I want
What everyone else has
But first I focus on my needs
I need, what no-one can give me
Am I too needy?

And all I long for
Is some clarity, sole and stay focused
Is that too much?
And I cry out, is this life?
Is this life?
Is this life?
Is this life?

Hope, I hope
That I find asylum
From all of these thought in my head
My head, has grown much too heavy
So I'll just drop it

And I confess
That security, honesty
Are just some made-up bull
And I refuse
To just fade out, to mess up and all I see is the worst
And I cry out, is this life?
Is this life?
Is this life?
Is this life?
