All across the south...
They've got the boogie bands that sound so fine
On both coasts they've got the record company machines
Turnin' out hits on an assembly line
But in the heart of America...we've got the beat
That's guaranteed to tap your toes
Oklahoma's got the Tulsa shuffle...
And this am the way it goes....

Up north in Chicago...
You've got your authentic blues bands
And way down yonder in New Orleans...
They got a thing they call Dixieland
All around this whole wide world...
There's one thing that everybody knows
All God's children love the Tulsa shuffle...
And this am the way it goes....

I love England--I love the Beatles
The who and the rolling stones
I love Nashville country and Texas Tex-Mex
And Cajun and Motown soul
But in the heart of America...we got the beat
That's guaranteed to tap your toes
Oklahoma's got the Tulsa shuffle
And this am the way it goes....
