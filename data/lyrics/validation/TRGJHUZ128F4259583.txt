[Verse 1]
Walking down the street of dreams
Eating from the fruits of life
Tripping out on the smallest things
Trying to reach the light, trying to reach the light
Pick the key up off the floor
Put the key into the lock
Turn the lock, open up the door
Look at all you've got, look at all you've got

[Pre-Chorus]
All the sinners and saints
All you creatures of faith
Don't need to be afraid
If you know what I mean
Let me hear you say

[Chorus]
Peace be upon us
Peace be upon us
Be upon us all
Peace be upon us
Peace be upon us
Be upon us all

[Verse 2]
If we speak in tongues of love
But we kill in the name of God
How can we profess to own his name
And still be so lost and still be so lost
The world will turn even when we're gone
The earth will host many souls to come
Who will write the history, tales of
Wisemen, villains and innocent ones

[Pre-Chorus]
All you shepherds and sheep
When you wake from your sleep
It will be a new day
If you know what I mean
Let me hear you say

[Chorus]
Peace be upon us
Peace be upon us
Be upon us all
Peace be upon us
Peace be upon us
Be upon us all

[Bridge]
As-salaamu alykum
Wa-alaykum assalaam
Assalaam alykum
Wa-alaykum assalaam

[Chorus]
Peace be upon us
Peace be upon us
Be upon us all
Peace be upon us
Peace be upon us
Be upon us all
