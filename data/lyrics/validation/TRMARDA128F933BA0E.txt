If you want to win my loving baby
Let me tell you what you need

You better move just like a women
Taste just like a Georgia peach
If you want to win my loving baby
Let me tell you what you need

Saw this girl
The other day
This pretty little girl walking 'round my way
Her hair was blonde
Eyes were blue
This girl had rhythm yo
Thad this girl could move you
She looked my way
She heard me say
She said "boy I really think you're crazy"
If you want to win my loving baby
Let me tell you what you need
