[Verse 1]
I have a trainset and a garage full of cars
And a soldier with a gun
My mother says I should have more responsibility
As I'm nearly 31

[Verse 2]
I have a plane, I have a crane
That can lift up all my trains and all my cars
I have a boat that doesn't float
But a big machine that takes me to the stars

[Chorus]
But my mother says I should get a job
Or my father she will tell
She says 16 years is a long enough rest
Though I say that I'm not well

[Verse 3]
I have a trainset and a garage full of cars
And a soldier with a gun
My mother says she'll break up all my toys and all my games
And she'll say I'm not her son

[Chorus]
But your mother says you should get a job
Or your father she will tell
She says 16 years is a long enough rest
Though you say that you're not well

[Verse 4]
I had a plane, I had a crane
That could lift up all my trains and all my cars
I had a boat that couldn't float
So my machine and me are going to the stars
