Wake up another day
It's funny how you put yourself in cruise control
You say you say your life is very plain
Waiting for a spark to light the coal inside
And that is when you feel alive
But that's just where it starts
Are you too comfortable in the dark?

*CHORUS*
You threw it all away
You had so much to gain
You threw it all away
Now there's nothing left to claim
(repeat)
And now you're lost inside of you
What am i supposed to do

Generation lost
All for everything until it comes to the cross
A fear of faith becomes their cage
They're getting used to
Feeling weightless
Breathing fakeness
Dreaming faithless

*CHORUS*

To talk to you
Feeling weightless
Breathing fakeness
Dreaming faithless

*CHORUS*

What am i supposed to do?
