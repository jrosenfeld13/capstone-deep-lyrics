Can't believe what you see with your eyes
The disguise that's put on
When you look at her from far away
And she looks good when you're just driving by
Then I cry when I notice up close she don't look the same
So just be careful about what you see
Don't believe anything until you get a second look
And just make sure that you always check out the bait
Before you take the hook, yeah

You gotta make sure you know exactly what you see
D.D.F
You can't just look passing by
You never know, it might turn out to be a guy
D.D.F
It's just so hard to decide
What is wrong from far away and what is right
D.D.F
It makes a great difference to me
You gotta know what you see now
