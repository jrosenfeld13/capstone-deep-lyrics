Hoppin' on a plane
Feels kinda strange, 'cause I'm shovellin' the same load
Lookin' for a change
But I keep on travellin' the same road
A belly full'a pain
But I don't mind carryin' the payload
A holiday in Spain
Y'see, I keep on travellin' the same road

Keep on travellin'
Keep on travellin'
Keep on travellin' the same road
Keep on travellin'
Keep on travellin'
Keep on travellin', travellin' the same road

They never tell the truth
They say I got a villa out in Magaluf
When I hit the ground
It's a long, long way from the main road
Summertime's come
Headin' for the sunshine lookin' for a good time
Could've been anywhere
But I keep on travellin' the same road

Keep on travellin'
Keep on travellin'
Keep on travellin' the same road
Keep on travellin'
Keep on travellin'
Keep on travellin', travellin' the same road

Seein' life go past and it's lightnin' fast
Seein' time that's wasted
Makin' no excuse, 'cause I'm doin' it all again

Got a fat cigar
But I know I keep smokin' in the same bar
When I tell the truth
I don't mind travellin' the same road
Bless my soul
I could'a made a livin' out of Rock'n'Roll
When I spread my cards
Thank God I'm travellin' the same road

Keep on travellin'
Keep on travellin'
Keep on travellin' the same road
Keep on travellin'
Keep on travellin'
Keep on travellin', travellin' the same road

Keep on travellin'
Keep on travellin'
Keep on travellin' the same road
Keep on travellin'
Keep on travellin'
Keep on travellin', travellin' the same road

Keep on travellin'
Keep on travellin'
Keep on travellin' the same road
Keep on travellin'
Keep on travellin'
Keep on travellin', travellin' the same road
