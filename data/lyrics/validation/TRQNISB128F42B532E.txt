You take me to the light, you take me to the light

When I met you in the sun, I fell in love with you
But now it's dark, I'm on the run
You broke my heart in two
Oh but I need you
I need you all the time
Oh, how I need you to be mine

Oh oh oh, you take me to the light, and I believe in love
When you are by my side, I know it's getting better
Come take me to the light, and I believe in love
When you are by my side
Oh oh oh

Did you ever feel the same, why don't you take my hand'
You left me standing in the rain, but I don't understand
Oh but I need you
I need you all the time
Oh, how I need you to be mine

Oh oh oh, you take me to the light, and I believe in love
When you are by my side, I know it's getting better
Come take me to the light, and I believe in love
When you are by my side
Oh oh oh
