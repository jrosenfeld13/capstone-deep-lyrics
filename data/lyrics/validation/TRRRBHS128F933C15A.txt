I woke up with a loved one's eyes upon me
Loved one's arms around me
Oh, she's my one and only

I grew up in the bosom of my family
Eight strong arms around me
Oh, from the seed they've grown me

And I thank those, those who kept me company
They are a wall of arms around me
Oh, it is they who are my army

Oh, it is they who are my army

Through these eyes, there's no god above me
No devil below me, no purgatory, no pearly gates, the worms are what await me
It's only me that can forgive me

And I have faith, oh, I have faith
I have faith, oh, I have faith
In those who put
Up with me

She's my one and only
If I'm the seed they've grown me
They who are my army
The wall of arms around me

She's my one and only
If I'm the seed they've grown me
They who are my army
The wall of arms around me
