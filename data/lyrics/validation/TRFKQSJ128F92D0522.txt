Mr. Oslo, Mr. Oslo
How did you get so far
Just a D.I.L.F. and a retard
Mr. Oslo, Mr. Oslo
Sucking your fancy cigar
Stolen from Cote d'Ivoice

You irritate us, man, but that's beside the fact
We're gonna drop something and we don't want it back

We're gonna drop the atom bomb
We're gonna burn your city down
Another day is over and the sun is gone
But it won't be gone for long
'Cause we're gonna drop the atom bomb

Oslo Woman, Oslo Woman
How do you get your kicks
Playing with various dicks
Oslo woman, Oslo woman
How did you get so dumb
Sucking on various thumbs

You're so high culture, you think you're so fucking hot
You see the circling vultures, and look at what we got

We're gonna drop the atom bomb
We're gonna gonna kill your happy home
Another is over and the sun is gone
But it won't be gone for long
'Cause we're gonna drop the atom bomb

Burn your eye, it's coming from the sky
Burn your eye, it's coming from the sky
Atom Bomb
