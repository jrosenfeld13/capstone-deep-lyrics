Well, I got a gal, she lives up on the hill
Well, I got a gal, she lives up on the hill
Well, this woman's tryin' to quit me
Lord, but I love her still

She's got eyes like diamonds
They shine like Klondike gold
She's got eyes like diamonds
They shine like Klondike gold
Ev'ry time she loves me
She sends my mellow soul

Well, you're so beautiful
You've got to die someday
Well, you're so beautiful
You've got to die someday
All I want's a little loving
Just before you pass away

Pretty baby, I'm goin' away
And leave you by yourself
Pretty baby, I'm goin' away
And leave you by yourself
You've mistreated me
Now you can mistreat somebody else
