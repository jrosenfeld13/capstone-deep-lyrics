[Intro]
Now let me holla at you for a minute
Cause I just got somethin that I need to say
You ever heard about that thing?
I mean that real thing?
I mean sometimes when you just cant even sleep, you cant think
You just lose yourself, wrapped all up in it
Hmm, shit, baby, you got me mesmerized
Let me sing it for you

[Verse 1]
You dont know
What you do to me
Let me tell ya
How ya make me feel

Boy, you got me weak (yeah!)
My heart is on fire since you put that thang on me, oh
You put that thang on me, that thang, baby

[Chorus]
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, mesmerized
(I said 1234 hit it, uh!)
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, mesmerized

[Verse 2]
You got me mesmerized
I dont know what to do
Baby got me hypnotized
I think Im in love with you
You got me so caught up
Baby, Im spellbound

And I dont think Im comin down

Said you knock me off my feet
I cant even sleep
Boy you got me weak
Your love is so sweet
Said you knock me off my feet
