[Verse 1]
Well I am, what I am, what I am, could be who you are?
Is your pain, when you smile 'cause you built a wall around your heart?
Do the thoughts in your head keep you up 'cause you feel alone?
And are you strong enough to be yourself?

[Pre-Hook]
My papa used to say
You're just a loser
And you're never gonna have what it takes
Mama used to say
All that loud music you play ain't gonna get you nowhere

[Hook]
Na naa, you gotta be yourself
Na naa, you gotta be yourself

[Verse 2]
If you cried, would you hide?
Would you want all the world to know?
And if you believe in love, would you let it show?
Are you in, are you hip, are you cool?
Do you try too hard?
Or are you strong enough to be yourself?
Wait

[Pre-Hook]
My papa used to say
You're just a loser
And you're never gonna have what it takes
Mama used to say
All that loud music you play ain't gonna get you nowhere
My papa used to say
You're just a loser
And you're never gonna have what it takes
Mama used to say
All that loud music you play ain't gonna get you nowhere

[Hook]
Na naa, you gotta be yourself
Na naa, you gotta be yourself

[Bridge]
If you can't, can't oh, be yourself, what are you living for?
If you can't, can't oh, be yourself, you're gonna lose it all
If you can't, can't oh, be yourself, what are you living for?
You're gonna find someday, you gotta run away
You gotta run, run, run, run away

[Pre-Hook]
My papa used to say
You're just a loser
And you're never gonna have what it takes
Mama used to say
All that loud music you play ain't gonna get you nowhere

[Hook]
Na naa, you gotta be yourself
Na naa, you gotta be yourself
Na naa, you gotta be yourself
Na naa, you gotta be yourself
