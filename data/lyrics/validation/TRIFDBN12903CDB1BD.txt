I know what I'm really like...
I'm bleeding...
I don't mind...

That was very foolish of me
I can do nothing now

Light shines in the darkness
I don't wanna go
Wish I could turn back time
Oh my Guardian Angel
Take me away from here
I think I'm ready now
But still can't make up my mind

Memories of yesterday
Hopes left behind
I have to fade away now
There's no other way out

The curtain falls...
