I can hear their song from miles away
It's carried in the wind
Its melody is sung to me in miracles
The sun rises over the sea

When I hear their love song
I don't understand
From out beyond the shadows
I can hear it calling me

Honestly, if I'm honest with myself
I've cried myself to sleep
Crying out, 'Oh God, where are you?
Can you hear my scream way up there
Through the clouds, in heaven?
Do you even care?'
And honestly if I'm honest with myself
I hate the song they sing
It's like salt on an open wound
But I can't get it out of my head

This melody kills me
It's out of key and foolish
But I think I might just like it
If I could just get past my pride
I turn my head and look away
'Cause you know it hurts to see the light of day

When I hear their love song
I don't understand
From out beyond the shadows
I can hear it calling me

Honestly, if I'm honest with myself
I've cried myself to sleep
Crying out, 'Oh God, where are you?
Can you hear my scream way up there
Through the clouds, in heaven?
Do you even care?'
And honestly if I'm honest with myself
I hate the song they sing
It's like salt on an open wound
But I can't get it out of my head

The whole world hates you
The whole world hates your song
Oh God I'm a sinner and I think I wanna sing along
The whole world hates you
The whole world hates your song
And I wanna sing
I wanna sing along

Heaven's not so far away
I can hear its melody from here in the waiting room of hell
Well heaven's not so far away
I can hear its melody calling me
Calling me home

Honestly, if I'm honest with myself
I've cried myself to sleep
Crying out, 'Oh God, where are you?
Can you hear my scream way up there
Through the clouds, in heaven?
Do you even care?'
And honestly if I'm honest with myself
I hate the song they sing
It's like salt on an open wound
But I can't get it out of my head

And honestly, if I'm honest with myself
I've cried myself to sleep
Crying out, 'Oh God, I need you
Can you hear my prayer way up there
Through the clouds, in heaven?
Do you even care?'

And honestly, I've never really been honest with myself
Well this melody heals my wounds
And I can't get it out of my head
