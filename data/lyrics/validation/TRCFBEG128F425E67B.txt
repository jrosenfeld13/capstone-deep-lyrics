[AJ:]
Here we are, seven days
And seven nights of empty tries
It is ritual, habitual
But it is never going to work this time

[Brian:]
We are to the point of no return
And along the way the only thing we have learned
Is how to hurt each other

[AJ:]
I am looking back and wondering why
It took so long to realize
That nothing's changed, it never will
All these years of standing still
And still we stay in all this pain
And nothing's going to make it go away

[Chorus (emphasis on Nick):]
I do not want to wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
I can read your mind baby you are not in it
And we are not what we used to be
No you would not have to lie to me
If you would only let me go
And I do not want to wait another minute to hear
Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know
Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know

[AJ:]
So save your voice
Do not waste your breath
Cannot you see we are at the end
And this goodbye is permanent
So wish me well and try to forget

[Nick:]
And all the fights
And all the ways
We almost made it
But we never did
And it is finally come to this

[Repeat Chorus]

[AJ/All:]
We cannot hide what we have become
So sick and tired of being numb
It is done, it is done
It is done

[Chorus II:]
I do not want to wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
I can read your mind baby you are not in it
And we are not what we used to be
No, you would not have to lie to me
If you would only let me go
And I do not want to wait another minute to hear
Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know
Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know
Something that I already know
I know, I know, I know
I know, cause I know
