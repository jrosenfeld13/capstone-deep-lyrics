[Doo wop doo wop]
And so with the explorers on my heels
[Doo wop doo wop]
I started t'wheel
[Doo wop doo wop]
Set aside stone walls
[Doo wop doo wop]
I was sick of it all
[Doo wop doo wop]
And so I set my sail
[Doo wop doo wop]
On your coattails
[Doo wop doo wop]
And your warm shawl
[Doo wop doo wop]

Up where
There's an Everlasting Arm
Sends us out alone
Moves us out of harm
Ever-reaching always sweeping...

[Whistle solo]

[Doo wop doo wop]
[Doo wop doo wop]
And though I struggled t'take my place
[Doo wop doo wop]
There stood my mistake
[Doo wop doo wop]
Standing there like some
[Doo wop doo wop]
Great big theater curtain
[Doo wop doo wop]
He knew for certain
[Doo wop doo wop]
I'd come down on you softly
[Doo wop doo wop]

Up where
There's an Everlasting Arm
Sends us out alone
Moves us out of harm
Ever-reaching always sweeping...

Up where
Up where

By and by the gates swung wide
[Doo wop doo wop]
Loved ones came in sight
[Doo wop doo wop]
Storming down the street
[Doo wop doo wop]
Like Puerto Rican kids in a summer rain
[Doo wop doo wop]
Breaking open the hydrants
[Doo wop doo wop]
And going insane
[Doo wop doo wop]
And going insane
[Doo wop doo wop]

Up where
There's an Everlasting Arm
Sends us out alone
Moves us out of harm
Ever-reaching always sweeping...

Up where
There's an Everlasting Arm
Sends us out alone
Moves us out of harm
Ever-reaching always sweeping

Up where
Up where
Up where
Up where
