Fell the black light once more, it's rising again
Hear the tempting voices in the whispering shadows
See the shapes of Lilith silently hovering in the air
Waiting for someone to chant these words once again

Shem ham forash

Lilith is rising again -- her black light shall be the guide
Lilith is rising again -- her sinful temptation shall allure

Night again, this black barren night
The sinister cradle of wicked fascination
Absolute and delightful obscurity of naked lust
Shadows of ill natural being haunt the dreams
Guided by these creatures of the night
Swallow the souls of all men as they sleep
Unhallowed vision in the cold thoughts
As they die Lilith shall rise again

Shem ham forash

From the land of no return, from the abyss of mankind
Forever to dwell in demise, her life is in the death of humans
Never to be seen by any living human to tell the tale
Boundless pain and lust for the human soul and flesh

Lilith is rising again -- her black light shall be the guide
Lilith is rising again -- her sinful temptation shall allure

Lilith is rising again -- her black light shall be the guide
Lilith is rising again -- her sinful temptation shall allure
