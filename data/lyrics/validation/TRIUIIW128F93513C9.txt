We were real twin souls
We were always together
We coudnt hear the world
We two had only each other
Until the day, until the day
I started to blame her for things, ooh
I screamed in her face
That she belongs in space
She ran then away out of my life
I screamed and I weeped
In my my dark sleep
I know she won't care, she won't see
Because I've lost her (x2)
She told me mean lies
I know it wasn't just me
And in the last few months
She sure was as cold as ice
What did I do wrong, what did I do wrong?
I rally want her story now, ooh
I screamed in her face
That she belongs in space
She ran then away out of my life
I screamed and I weeped
In my my dark sleep
I know she won't care, she won't see
Because I've lost her (x2)
A week ago I saw her again
With her new friend, walking by
She had a happy face
And she isn't missing me at all
I screamed in her face
That she belongs in space
She ran then away out of my life
I screamed and I weeped
In my my dark sleep
I know she won't care, she won't see
Because I've lost her (x2)
She won't see, because I've lost her
She won't care, because I've lost her
She won't see or care
Because I've lost her (2x)
Now
