Open up your heart I'm comin' through your world today
Release yourself upon my eagerness In every way
So young and innocent, too naive to understand
I'll take you by the hand And lead you to the promised land
Wind that beats across my face Rain that soaks my skin
Excitement that I feel down below And deep within
Each time I look at you My little girl, I know it's true
I just can't help myself Can't stop myself all over you
I'm just a spirit on a mission from above
Sent here to satisfy the lust we're all thinkin' of
Your conscience holds the sins, beg me for forgiveness
The penance you receive Will fill your heart with happiness
Save yourself I have come to take your soul
Save yourself Your finest hour has just begun
Save yourself A night with me is all it takes
To save yourself Your finest hour has just begun
I've never known so much power Since it all began
The Lord him self must have touched me With his very hand
Such loveliness lying here before This troubled man
My little angel spread your wings And fly me upside down
I'm just a spirit on a mission from above
Sent here to satisfy the lust we're all thinkin' of
Your conscience holds the sins, beg me for forgiveness
The penance you receive Will fill your heart with happiness
Save yourself I have come to take your soul
Save yourself Your finest hour has just begun
Save yourself A night with me is all it takes
To save yourself Your finest hour has just begun
