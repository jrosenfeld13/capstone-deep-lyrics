Please don't ask me to dance
Please don't ask me to dance
Skin remembers what the heart forgets
And I might do something that I will regret
How can you smile at me now
After all the ugly words we used
Don't you remember anything we said
Tonight I'm younger and it's going to my head
No I don't want a second chance
Please don't ask me to dance

Skin remembers what the heart forgets
And I might do something that I will regret
Why don't you leave me alone
Why don't you bother someone else
What do I care if you've got no-one to hold
What does it matter if the night is getting old
Oh god if I feel your hand
Please don't ask me to dance
