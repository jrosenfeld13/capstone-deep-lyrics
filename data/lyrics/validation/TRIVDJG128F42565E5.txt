What is peace
To the people
Who work the land
And die in wars?

And it was learned in a game
That was played by us all
Who held the top of the hill
From the rest was called the king

And I can't believe it all
Was good for humankind

Is it peace
To point the guns?
Is it war
To fire the guns?

We would run with all our might
Push the king off to take the hill
And to learn who was king
And who makes the better serf

I can't believe it all
Was good for humankind
And I have to read the lies
Between the lines

Believe in this
We are a part
Of a whole
We call the Earth

And I can't believe it all
Was good for humankind
And I have to read the lies
Between the lines
