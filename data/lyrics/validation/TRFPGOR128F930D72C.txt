Scarred souls, remain raw
Unveiling my world as blood soaked

Mankind, Expired paralyzed
Broken by the doctrines imposed
Civilized breed
A myth portrayed
To pacify and enslave

Starve the basic needs
Of born kings
Classified as insane
Lies are thy mask of the cowards
Faceless beings

Fear
Unveils your weak feeble beliefs
You dare diagnose those
Who obey no laws
As disturbed and unstable
Though the strength of the lunatics
Will survive
Thee apocalyptic wars

Truth. We're all insane
My hands are tied, restrained
Truth, define your truth
Reality reigns in pain
PROVOKING THE DISTURBED!

Desensitized behavior, ensures
I despise equally
Release is my, savior
From confined masochistic beliefs

Civilized breed
A myth portrayed
To pacify and enslave
Starve the basic needs of born kings
Classified as insane

Lies truth be untold
Impressions of lawless society
Clash of the evident curse
Demise of those who are out spoken
Chaotic reign of the insane
Lies truth be untold
Impressions of lawless society

Scarred souls, remain raw
Unveiling my world as blood soaked

Mankind, expire paralyzed
Broken by the doctrines imposed
Lies, are the mask of the cowards
Faceless beings

Fear
Unveils your weak feeble beliefs
You dare diagnose those
Who obey no laws
As disturbed and unstable

Though the strength of the lunatics
Will survive
Thee apocalyptic wars

Truth, we're all insane
My hands are tied, restrained
Truth, define your truth
Reality reigns in pain
PROVOKING THE DISTURBED!
