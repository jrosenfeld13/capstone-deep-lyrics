I can't describe
I can't believe
How i feel inside
I know i just met you
The other night
But i've never
Felt anything
That's felt so right

Chorus:
I want you to
Take my Lips
And make them yours
Take my fears
And let my heart soar
Cause i've never felt
Like this before
So won't you
Take my lips
And make them yours

I can feel your body
Next to mine
Everytime i close my eyes
Everytime
I feel your breath up on my skin
I can't wait to be with you
Again and again

So won't you take my lips
Take my vision (fears)
And let my heart soar
Cause i've never felt
Like this before
So won't you
Take my lips
And make them yours

And I
O, I wanna take your body (2x)
So close to mine
I wanna take your body
And make love
Last for all time (2x)

Yeno
I wanna make sweet love (2x)
To you baby
So would youyou take my lips
Take my vision (fears)
I want my heart to soar
Cause i've never felt
Like this before
So take my lips
And make them yours

Come on now
I said will you take
My lips
And make them yours
