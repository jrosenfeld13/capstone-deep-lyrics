Your eyes, your concrete eyes
Cross, crisscross my path
They walk
Walking in circular patterns
[?]
Shoe shine your ammo
Shoe shine
Polish your metal
I need not your wicked weapons
[?]

My war is not with someone like you
My war is not with someone like you

String of blood
That is not my own
Strings between
A sword and my heart
So much so
That it makes its way through
My throat giving me thought to speak
My pistol
My dagger
This becomes your future
Unseen war

String of blood
That is not my own
Strings between
A sword and my heart
It's so much so
That it makes its way through
My throat giving me thought to speak
This becomes my pistol
This becomes my dagger
This becomes your future
Unseen war

Your weapons are useless
Drop the gun
Golden gun
Drop the
Your weapons are useless
Drop the gun
Golden gun
Drop the gun
Your weapons are useless
Drop the gun
Golden gun
Drop gun
Your weapons are useless
Drop the gun
Golden gun
Drop the
Weapons are useless
Drop the gun
Golden gun
