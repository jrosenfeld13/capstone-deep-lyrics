It happens every time
You wake up screaming
And say you're feeling fine
It happens every time
You think you're changing
Water into wine

Well it helps to think that we're all selling pearls
To swine

It happens every time

Well don't you think that it's a crime to keep pretending
Pretending that you're mine
And don't you think that it's a crime to keep repeating
Repeating all those lies

Well you never seem to know to read between the lines

It happens every time
It happens every time

Once upon a time i woke up screaming
And realised that you're blind
And don't you think that it's a crime to go on dreaming
'cause it happens every time

Well it helps to think that we're all selling pearls
To swine

It happens every time
It happens every time
It happens every time
