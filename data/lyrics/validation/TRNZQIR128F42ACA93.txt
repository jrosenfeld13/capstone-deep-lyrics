Paranoid, you have no idea
Listen to all the voices
And tell me what you hear
Is it right or wrong?
Just to sit and wait

(Wait for someone else to wait for someone else)
You push your body to the knife
But it feels as if you hesitate

Gotta get away lover
Just a place to crawl away
Is this a love or just a fear?
What if there were traces
Shots of different faces follow me

I keep you close enough to know
That I am never alone
I disappear within the night
Though I act as if I'm coming home

Gotta get away lover
Just a place to crawl away
Is this a love of just a fear?
What if there were traces
Shots of different faces fall

You gotta wait for her
But it's a wounded alibi
You gotta wait for her
If I fall asleep tonight
Will it all remain the same?

Are we just creatures of the night
Running to the light?
So what if it turns us on
Is it right or wrong, right or wrong?

Gotta get away lover
Just a place to crawl away
Is this a love of just a fear?
What if there were traces
Shots of different faces fall

You gotta wait for her
But it's a wounded alibi
You gotta wait for her
If I fall asleep tonight
Will it all remain the same?

Love is a word we abuse
With the things we say
Time keeps a changing the rules
To the games we play

Dreams that awaken the fear
That we're left in doubt
Tears that come rolling
And rolling and rolling down

You wanted it all
You wanted it all

What keeps me broken in this world?

You gotta wait for her
But it's a wounded alibi
You gotta wait for her

If I fall asleep tonight
Will it all remain the same?
If I fall asleep tonight
Will it always end the same?
