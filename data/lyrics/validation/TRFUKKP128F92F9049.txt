You can't (you can't)
Yiou can't take it with you
You can't (you can't)
You can't take it with you

You can trust possessions
Gathered on a shelf
Making a profession
Of giving to yourself

You can trust in money
You can work for gold
But you don't have a prayer
If you buy it with your soul

You can't (you can't)
You can't take it with you
You can't (you can't)
You can't take it with you

You can build your empire
Gain the world's respect
See your little kingdom
As something to protect

What is wood and paper
Where eternity's concerned
Reinvest your heart
In something that won't burn

CHORUS

It's not what you have
It's not what you do
All you can take
Is what He's done in you
And all the other stuff

CHORUS

REPEAT CHORUS

It's not what you have
It's not what you do
All you can take
Is what He's done in you

REPEAT CHORUS
