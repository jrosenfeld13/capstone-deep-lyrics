When first to this country as a stranger I came
I placed my affection on a comely young dame
She being warm and tender, her waist small and slender
Kind nature had formed her for my overthrow

On the banks of bann water, where I first beheld her
She appeared like fair juno or a grecian queen
Her eyes shone like diamonds, her hair softly twining
Her cheeks were like roses, or like blood drops in snow

It was her cruel parents that first caused our variance
All because I was poor and of a low degree
But I'll do my endeavour to earn my love's favour
Although she is come of a rich family

My name is delaney, its a name that won't shame me
And if I had saved money I'd have plenty in store
But drinking and courting, night rambling and sporting
Were the cause of my ruin and absence from home

Had I all the money that's in the west indies
Or had I the gold of the african shore
I would spend it on pearls, and on you my brown girl
For there's no other love in this world I adore

And now that I've found her I'm contented forever
I'll put rings on her fingers and gold in her hair
And we'll live on the banks of the lovely bann river
And in all sorts of splendour I will style her my dear

One of several songs with this name
