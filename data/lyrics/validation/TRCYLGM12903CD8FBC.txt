Right in the night, the rhythm lights for you
Right in the night, you're hoping and you're praying
Right in the night, a wish is coming true
Right in the night, you got to feel the heaven
Right in the night, the rhythm lights for you
Right in the night, you're hoping and you're praying
Right in the night, a wish is coming true
Right in the night, you got to feel the heaven
Right in the night, the rhythm lights for you
Right in the night, you're hoping and you're praying
Right in the night, a wish is coming true
