Yeah, if you go down to Athens, G-A
And you're driving in your car
You won't get very far before
You hear people shoutin' out!
What's that?
Butterbean! Yeah!
Gramps and grannies
Kids in their teens
Junkyard dogs and campus queens
Yeah, everybody likes butterbeans

Don't you wait, don't you linger
Butterbean don't slip through my fingers

Pass me plate full, I'll be grateful
1-2-3-4
Pick 'em, hull 'em, put on the steam
That's how we fix butterbeans
(Fix 'em hot hot hot)
(Yeah, make 'em jump outta the pot)

Come here you little butterbean you come on!
Butterbean-butterbean
Butterbean-butterbean
Butterbean-butterbean
Butterbean-butterbean
Butterbean grows on the vine

Some people are fat, some people are lean
But I want you to show me the person
Who doesn't like butterbeans
Yay!

Well, you can have your yams
You can have your collard greens
But if you want to please little ol' me
You better fix butterbeans

Don't you wait, don't you linger
Butterbean don't slip through my fingers

Pick 'em, hull 'em, put on the steam
That's how we fix butterbeans
(Fix 'em hot hot hot)
(Yeah, make 'em jump outta the pot)
Fix 'em for me now
