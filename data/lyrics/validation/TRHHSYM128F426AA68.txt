[Verse 1]
She's taking her time, making up the reasons
To justify all the hurt inside
Guess she knows from the smiles
And the look in their eyes
Everyone's got a theory about the bitter one

They're saying
"Mama never loved her much
And Daddy never keeps in touch
That's why she shies away
From human affection."
But somewhere in a private place
She packs her bags for outer space
And now she's waiting
For the right kind of pilot to come (And she'll say to him...)
She's saying

[Chorus]
I would fly to the moon and back
If you'll be, if you'll be my baby
I've got a ticket for a world
Where we belong
So would you be my baby?

[Verse 2]
She can't remember a time
When she felt needed
If love was red then she was color blind
All her friends, they've been tried for treason
And crimes that were never defined

She's saying
"Love is like a barren place
And reaching out for human faith
Is, is like a journey
I just don't have a map for."

So, baby's gonna take a dive
And push the shift to overdrive
Send a signal that she's hanging
All her hopes on the stars (What a pleasant dream...)

[Chorus]
I would fly to the moon and back
If you'll be, if you'll be my baby
I've got a ticket for a world
Where we belong
So would you be my baby?

Hold on
Hold on (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)

[Verse 3]
"Mama never loved her much
And Daddy never keeps in touch
That's why she shies away
From human affection."
But somewhere in a private place
She packs her bags for outer space
And now she's waiting
For the right kind of pilot to come (And she'll say to him)
Just saying

[Chorus]
I would fly to the moon and back
If you'll be, if you'll be my baby
I've got a ticket for a world
Where we belong
So would you be my baby?

[Chorus]
I would fly to the moon and back
If you'll be, if you'll be my baby
I've got a ticket for a world
Where we belong
So would you be my baby
