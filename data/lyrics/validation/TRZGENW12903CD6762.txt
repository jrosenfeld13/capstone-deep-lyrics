The day it was explained to me
I understood it finally

Oh oooh oh

I got the letter in the mail
I saw the stamp, I knew I'd failed

Oh oooh oh

In a way it was better than today, it was a special day
It was the last time that I smiled
In a day, we were made in a day
I used to think this world was for me to save

Oh ooh ooh oh

Then I grew and I grew and everything I knew was a simple thing
It was the same old silly game

Oh ooh ooh ooh oh

I thought it was the lemonade but nothing really came to my aid
Nothing really came
It's all a silly game

Oh you silly world
Are you famous to the stars?
Born a little girl
You woke up as a single mother

Just a name, just a name, everybody has a name
It's a useful thing but to me they're the same

Oh ooh ooh oh

I'm alone, I'm alone and I'm waiting at the phone
As the seconds pass I grow heavy like a stone

Oh ooh ooh oh

I wish it was the time of year
But everything was crystal and clear
Everything was clear
Nothing more to fear

Oh you silly world
Are you famous to the stars?
Born a little girl
I remembered everything you said

You woke up on the other side of the bed
Oh you world
Sleep all you can
You'll wake up as a single mother
