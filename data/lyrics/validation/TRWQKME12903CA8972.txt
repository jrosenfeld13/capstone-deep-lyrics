A happy science
So why so sad?
'Cause I thought you know
We're always held

Through fire and lightning
The occasional war
And telling me that
Your chest is sore

That's 'cause your soul's on fire

Boo-hoo-ooh, we are ghosts
You? You are losing your religion
Boo-hoo-ooh, we are ghosts
We're haunting Europe
And tomorrow the world

An earthly died
At a mystic feast
We keep on falling
Detached the sun

Now light our lanterns
Before moon
Just keep waiting
You'll be judged

Just 'cause your heart's an open book

Boo-hoo-ooh, we are ghosts
You? You are losing your religion
Boo-hoo-ooh, we are ghosts
We're haunting Europe

Are we human
Or are we dynamite?
Are we human
Or are we dynamite?

And God is dead
And God is dead
And God is dead
And God is dead
