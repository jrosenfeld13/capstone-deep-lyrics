I been kickin myself ever since
I gave my love to you a hundred percent
And you gave nothin in return
The only time you seemed concerned
Is when you wanted to lay up
You kept telling me that I was the one
And you kept sellin me dream after dream
But after so many dreams deferred
I saw you for what you were
And that was someone who really didn't care

How can somethin feel so right really be so wrong
Why were youfor the ride
I just can't let you get back inside

And now you're wantin to make it right
Blowin up my pager and phone day and night
Like I should up and let you in
To my open arms again
I don't think so, not a chance
I am stronger now thanks to you
I've turned a negative thing into something positive
Now I know that I can live
Without the likes of you around

And now you swear to god
That you have made a change
But when I look at you
I think of all the pain
You uneccessarily
Brouht on me
Never again, never again

How can somethin feel so right really be so wrong
Why were youfor the ride
I just can't let you get back inside
