[Verse 1]
You are the original template
You are the original exemplary
How seen were you actually?
How revered were you, honestly, at the time?
Why, pleased with your low maintenance
You loved us more than we could've loved you back
Where was your ally, your partner in feminine crime?

[Refrain]
Oh ho, mother, who's your buddy?
Oh ho, mother, who's got your back?
The heart of the house
The heart of the house
All hail the Goddess

[Verse 2]
You were good old
You were counting on her till four a.m
You saw me run from the house
In the snow melodramatically

[Refrain]
Oh ho, mother, who's your sister?
Oh ho, mother, who's your friend?
The heart of the house
The heart of that house
All hail the Goddess

[Verse 3]
We left the men and we went for a walk in the Gatineaus
And talked like women, like women to women would
Women to women would
Where did you get that from?
Must've been your father, your dad
I got it from you, I got it from you
Do you see yourself in my gypsy garage sale ways?
In my fits of laughter
In my Tinkerbell tendencies
In my lack of color coordination
