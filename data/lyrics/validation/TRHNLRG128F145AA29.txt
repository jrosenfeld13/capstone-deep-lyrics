I feel temptation
As every day goes by
I reach for salvation
Somewhere inside
Somewhere in time
I drift through the people
Wherever I look I take a second glance
Cause I know there is a reason
My only chance
My soul
Always believing

First chorus:
Dreaming of one place I know
It's within your eyes
Show me the road to go I don't know
The answer for me - where it lies
It's within your eyes
Oh
So now, I'm dreaming
Living inside of those eyes

Your eyes are shining
And every night I pray
The light of their passion
Won't fade away
My soul
Always believing

Second chorus:
Dreaming of one place I know
It's within your eyes
Show me the road to go I don't know
The answer for me - where it lies
It's within your eyes
Oh
So now, I'm dreaming
Living inside of those eyes

Don't close your eyes
In your eyes
Don't close your eyes
In your eyes
Don't...
