I saw a picture yesterday
You know the one, we were laughing in the rain
Remember how it used to be
Remember when you were still in love with me

But you turned away
And I start to cry
I'm lost without your love
And I won't survive
Don't leave me alone tonight
I'm lost without your love and I won't survive

I can't believe that we are through
Is it someone else?
Have ya found somebody new?
Cuz I die inside everytime I close my eyes
And imagine myself living without you

But you turned away
And I start to cry
I'm lost without your love
And I won't survive
Don't leave me
Alone tonight
I'm lost without your love
And I won't survive
