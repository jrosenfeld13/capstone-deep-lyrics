I wonder how the morning came last night
I went insane
I threw some things, I smashed some things
What happens next, I haven't figured out yet

I'm not quite sure what drove me to the madness
Bringing on my dark side
Was it me? Was it you and your obnoxious friends
Who made me feel defenseless

Couldn't care less about
The things you'll think when I walk out
Couldn't care less about
What happens now
I couldn't care less about
The psycho-babble from your mouth
(the things you'll think when I walk out)
Don't think I care enough to care

Tripped on your diploma
Who knows what could (be this Spring)
Bringing, just bringing to the moon
Somewhere on a country road
Probably killing me
Under broken things
You found your wings, goodbye

I couldn't care less about
The things you'll think when I walk out
(the things you'll think when I walk out)
Couldn't care less about
What happens now
I couldn't care less about
The psycho-babble from your mouth
(the things you'll think when I walk out)
I don't think I care enough to care

Right now, you've reached the mountain
Deny yourself the fountains at...
Exit 41
Gold-blue cavern that hides the sun so well

I Couldn't care less about
The things that you're thinking, you're thinking when I walk out
I couldn't care less about
What happens now
I couldn't care less about
(the things that you're thinking, you're thinking when I walk out)
The things you'll think when I walk out
Couldn't care less about
What happens now
I couldn't care less about
(same "thinking" part as above)
The psycho-babble from your mouth
Don't think I care enough to care, to care
Oh, I couldn't care less about
(same "thinking" part again)
The things you'll think when I walk out
Couldn't care less about
What happens now, what happens now, what happens now

Oh, woah woah-woah woah-woah(chant with song) 5x
