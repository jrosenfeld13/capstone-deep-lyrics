[Hook x2]

I say peace when I walk through the wilderness
In spite the devils civilization
I'm filled with this calm that I radiate
Know when I'm armed with a bomb that'll slay the hate

[Verse 1]

Right here in my palm
I brainstorm as the best knower of self
With an art full of rhymes it survives over time
These are just one kind mans words for mankind
When you walk with your God watch out for land mines
That divide and conquer, profit from the prophets
Conceal the truths pipeline like a soffit
You're telling me I'm going to hell man, get off it
I told you it's a path not a destination
My heaven and hell are just exits on a highway
Like truth or consequences
So where do you get off trying to judge me
Justice will be a reward or penalty
But one thing's for sure though, you will remember me
As strong whether neutral, ally or enemy
If not the name, then the face will serve the same purpose
As to make ya'll nay-sayers nervous

[Hook]

Who am I supposed to thank for my circulation
Or my respiration
I know he was Haitian
But aside from that, all he gave me was a name
But a seed is a seed so we're still the same
My pops bounced but I need no explanation
Or extra patience
Would I look like waiting for a mystery man to spark conversation
I'mma be where he wasn't for my own little nation
Now who I gotta thank for making it this long
From the sidewalks of New York to write this song
See mamma ain't raised no fool, nah
She raised a wise soldier, and taught him how to get over
Yo I've been around the sun and back
Three times since the first time I said that
And guess where my head's at
Over the same foundation on the next story
The next chapter
What you think I rap for
Merely to repeat myself in different ways
Simply to show off, amuse and amaze, nah
I'm trying to show and prove god through music see
Ten years strong, this is not just a phase

[Hook]
