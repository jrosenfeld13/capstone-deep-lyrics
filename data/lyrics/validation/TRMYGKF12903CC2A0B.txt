This song is written for you
You love that, and I hate it
It starts off so soft and sweet
You like that, do you like me?

(I'm gonna break it down, 'cause you like it rolling down here.)

Hey!
Like that funky, funky!

I can't write music
You hate it when I do it
You just want me to sound like
Every God damn man on the radio

This song is written for you
You like it, and I hate it
I can't breathe, I can't write
I can't live my life like this

It's gotten quieter
Cause you like that
In the third verse, keep it mellow
Cause you know you're building up for
The final chorus

It's our song written for you
You like it, I hate that

It's our song(x3)

I'm singing it different now!
I'm breaking it down!
You love it!

This is my song(x4)

Rock! Rock! Rock!
