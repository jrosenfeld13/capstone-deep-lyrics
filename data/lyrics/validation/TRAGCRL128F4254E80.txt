What child is this
Who lay to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping
Whom angels greet with anthemsweet
While shepards watch our keeping
This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepards gaurd and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring him love
The Babe, the son of Mary

Hooah, hoaah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

So bring him incense, gold and myrrh
Come peasant King to own him
The King of kings
Salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone him
Praise, praise the Son on high
The Virgin sings her lullaby
Joy, joy, for Christ is born
The babe, the Son of Mary
The babe, the Son of Mary (Mary)

Hoah, Hoah, Hoah

SPOKEN: And lo the angel of the Lord came upon them
And the glory of the Lord shown round about them
And they were so afraid
And the angel said unto them
"Fear not, for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy
Which shall be to all people
For unto you is born this day in the city of David
A Savior which is Christ the Lord
And this shall be a sign unto you
You shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger"
And suddenly there was with the angel
A multitude of heavenly hosts
Priasing God and saying "Glory to God in the highest (Glory to God in the highest)"
And on Earth, peace, goodwill toward men
