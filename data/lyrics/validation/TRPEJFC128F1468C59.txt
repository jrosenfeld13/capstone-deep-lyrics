[Verse 1]
Ice will melt, water will boil
You and I can shake off this mortal coil
It's bigger than us
You don't have to worry about it
Ready or not, here comes the drop
You feel lucky when you know where you are
Y'know, it's gonna come true
Here in your arms, I remember

[Chorus]
It's only natural
That I should want to be there with you
It's only natural
That you should feel the same way, too

[Verse 2]
It's easy when you don't try going on first impressions
Man in a cage has made his confession
Now, you've seen me at my worst
And it won't be the last time I'm down there
I want you to know I feel completely at ease
Read me like a book
That's fallen down between your knees
Please, let me have my way with you

[Chorus]
It's only natural
That I should want to be there with you
It's only natural
That you should feel the same way, too

[Verse 3]
It's circumstantial
It's nothing written in the sky
And we don't even have to try
But we'll be shaking like mud
Buildings of glass
Sink into the bay
They'll be under the rocks again
You don't have to say
I know you're afraid

[Chorus]
It's only natural
That I should want to be there with you
It's only natural
That you should feel the same way, too

[Outro]
It's circumstantial
It's something I was born to
It's only natural
Can I help it if I want to?
Can I help it if I want to?
