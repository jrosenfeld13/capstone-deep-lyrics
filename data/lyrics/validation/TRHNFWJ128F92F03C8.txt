You say it's not so easy*
You say this life will tear us apart
Let's make tonight feel easy
Pretend there is a start
You say you look for sweet lies
You say tonight theres a lot we can do
You gotta learn to let go
Before its killing you (2x)
Wahaa
Yeaheah
Wahaa
Yeaheah
You want the perfect no one
Make it last to the moment hes gone
Someone to run away from
You're not the only one
Your life
Spot life
Sweet lies
Sometime
