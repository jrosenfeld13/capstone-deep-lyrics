Death breathes down my neck. The sword will soon decide. Who was right and who
Was wrong. Jesus saves, but death prevails. The execution protocol. The
Inquisitions deatch call. The execution protocol. Is it God's decision after
All? I look at you, you're my saviour. Bow my head as I kneel. You're the one
I fear most. You're the one who wields the sword. The execution protocol. The
Inquisitions deatch call. The execution protocol. Is it God's decision after
All? Persecution mania of heretics. I climb the stairs to the scaffold. Blind
My eyes so I can't see. The grin on your disgusting face. You're a tool of
God's inferior race. The inquisitions deatch call. The execution protocol. Is
It God's decision after all?
