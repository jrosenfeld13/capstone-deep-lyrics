[Verse 1]
I pushed your head down flat onto the page
I held the weapon flat against your face
I remembered the promise that I had made
And turned the pen back, back onto myself

[Chorus]
So you can stick your words of comfort
And you can take your well wishes too
Singing allez les blues
'Cause they hold me closer than you would ever do
Allez les blues

[Verse 2]
I know your shape and I know your size
You are the weight of the concrete boots
That pull me under the tide
And now youre marching on to a different drum
Leaving my body here without a beat
A body drained of all feeling could be nothing but a piece of meat

[Chorus]
So you can stick your words of comfort
And you can take your well wishes too
We're singing allez les blues
'Cause they hold me closer than you would ever do
Allez les blues
'Cause they hold me closer than you would ever do
Allez les blues

[Bridge 1]
This lump in my throat is the knot that you tied
With a flick of your tongue and a wink of your eye
This lump in my throat is the knot that you tied
With a flick of your tongue and a wink of your eye
This lump in my throat is the knot that you tied
With a flick of your tongue and a wink of your eye
This lump in my throat is the knot that you tied
With a flick of your tongue and a wink of your eye

[Bridge 2]
Ive been sitting sidesaddle on the devils chair
Ive been muddying upholstery, you didnt care
[?] right into the dead of night
Yeah, but the fire keeps me warm and keeps my heart alive
Ive been sitting sidesaddle on the devils chair
Ive been muddying upholstery, you didnt care
[?] right into the dead of night
Yeah, but the fire keeps me warm and keeps my heart alive

[Verse 3]
You pushed my head down flat onto the page
You held the weapon flat to my face
You remember the promise that you would break
But now the bloodline runs through my veins

[Chorus]
'Cause they hold me closer than you would ever do
Allez les blues
They hold me closer than you would ever do
Allez les blues
