Sleepless nights and twisted fucks
Barely breathing on the bathroom floor
I can't stand this place i'm in
I can't bear to live in this skin
Cold sweats and dirty sheets
And i'm so alone
I'm rotting from the inside out
This isn't how it's supposed to be
I'm sick and i'm tired
And i can't take anymore
Sleepless nights and twisted fucks
Barely breathing on the bathroom floor
Please don't talk to me
I'll be alright all by myself let me live in peace
Expel these thoughts right from my brain
