[Verse 1]
I pinch myself
Sometimes to make sure I'm not in a dream
That's how it seems
I close my eyes and breathe in the sweetest moments I've ever known
It feels like home
And here I am
I want to be your everything
There you are
Turning winter into spring

[Chorus]
And everyone that sees you
Always wants to know you
And everyone that knows you
Always has a smile
You're a standing ovation
After take years of waiting
For a chance to finally shine
Everyone calls you amazing
Yeah
I just call you mine

[Verse 2]
I fall apart
And just a word from you
Somehow seems to fix
Whatever's wrong
Oh
You reach into the weakest moments and remind me that I'm strong
You got to know
I'd be a fool not to see or even worse to forget
That you're more than I deserve

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Nothing makes sense when you're not here
As if my whole world disappears
Without you what's the point of it

[Chorus]
