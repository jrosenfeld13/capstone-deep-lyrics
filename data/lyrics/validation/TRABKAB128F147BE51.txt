Night time - all alone - nowhere to begin
It seems to me that in the past
The darkness was my friend
Those times have changed, i'm now a stranger
In a violent place
I walk alone down empty streets
I turn my head, did someone call my name?

I feel allright - but i keep on hearing voices in the night

I've got a feeling something's wrong
But i can't place it
A feeling that i know is real
'cause i can taste it
Someone's watching me - i feel their presence
But i can't see them
Some else is right behind me
I hold my breath - i get the feeling...

I feel allright - but i keep on hearing voices in the night
