I can feel the weakness in you
It's just a matter of time
Once I have control
You'll never be the same

I make you question faith
Put your morals to the test
Bend you into submission
My essence you can not fight

I'll show you things you've never seen
Expose the darkness deep within
Taste and feel a different world
Leave behind all you were

New heights of passion and the pleasure of pain
Show no compassion, show no remorse
My helpless slave, do as I say
Indulge in me to the end

Taunting
And destructive
Go ahead
You know you want it
Feel tmptation
Just give in
Taste it once
You won't go back

The easy path was clear to see
The choice you made has brought you here
Your broken life in front of me
Spiral down into my arms
