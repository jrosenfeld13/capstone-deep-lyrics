Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corn cob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know how he came to life one day
There must of been some magic in
That ol' silk hat they found
But when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said lets run and we'll have some fun before I melt away
Down to the village with a broom stick in his hand
Runnin' here and there all around the square
Sayin' catch me if you can

He led them down the streets of town
Right to that traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler stop

Frosty the snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye sayin' don't you cry
I'll be back again some day

Look at Frosty go
Over the hills of snow
