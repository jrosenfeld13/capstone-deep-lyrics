Blue
I'm getting kinda close to you
Like a shadow I can't lose, hey
You've been hanging with me everyday
Now you're getting in my way, yeah

I know you understand me
But don't you think that maybe
It's time to move on?

What's up, lonely?
Seems you're my only
Friend who wants to share my pain
Tell me, heartache
What's it gonna take
For you to leave me alone today?

Just when I think that you're gone, yeah
You're in the mirror looking back at me

So what's up, lonely?
Lonely, oh

Sometimes, I wish you weren't by my side
Can't you find another shoulder?
'Cause I, I wanna leave this broken heart behind
We're both wasting too much time

Find someone else to rain on
I'm really getting tired of singing this sad song

What's up, lonely?
Seems you're my only
Friend who wants to share my pain
Tell me, heartache
What's it gonna take
For you to leave me alone today?

Just when I think that you're gone, yeah
You're in the mirror looking back at me

So what's up, lonely?

Don't wanna give you a reason
To hang around anymore
You won't be hurting my feelings
If you find another broken heart
You can lean on

Gotta go, gotta move on
Gotta go, gotta move on
Just leave me alone

What's up, lonely?
Seems you're my only
Friend who wants to share my pain
Tell me, heartache
What's it gonna take
For you to leave me alone today?

Just when I think that you're gone, yeah
You're in the mirror looking back at me

So what's up, lonely?

Gotta go, gotta move on
Gotta go, gotta move on
Yeah, yeah, yeah

What's up, lonely?
Seems you're my only
Friend who wants to share my pain
Tell me, heartache
What's it gonna take?

What's up, lonely?
