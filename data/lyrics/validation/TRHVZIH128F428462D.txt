He says Phoenix
Pegasus
Grecian urn
Midwest turn
So much to learn
Together
Together
She says our souls
Are warm
Lives
Reborn
From hearts
That were torn
Before before
Performs performs
Together
Together they say
A breath renewed
Everyday
With you
Our arms
Are moved
We are not alone
Not alone
Together
Our souls are warm
Lives reborn
From hearts that were torn
Before
Breath renewed
Everyday with you
Our arms, our hold
We are not alone
Together
Together
Together
We're ready
