Cursed to the darkness
In fear of the light
Having crosses oceans of time

Hunt in the darkness
They feed in the night
Feast upon flesh
Eternal life

Condemned to living death
To hunger from bleeding flesh
Powers over the storm
Over beasts that walk the earth

Ancient evil
Saviors to the few
Insane bloodlust carnage sacrifice
Ancient evil undead immortal

Ancient evil
Saviors to the few
Great unholy lord
Demons heard on high

I shall do thy bidding
Death becomes my life
Insane bloodlust carnage sacrifice
Ancient evil undead immortal
