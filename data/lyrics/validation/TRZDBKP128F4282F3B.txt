See that sky through the window, that sky for me
But I got to learn to breathe water before I get that high
And all that is pure, through all that is meaningless
Strike the balance
Strip back to the core
And it's too late now, I'm much too far gone
To get a hold of my security and the cloud that I flew from
And I'm ready to start now, this is what I waited for
And the vision it brings such a beautiful thing
That I'm brought to my knees as I finally learn to breathe

See that face in the mirror
Past bone and skin and into the heart of me
I celebrate this bleeding
If that's what scares you
If that's what's pulling you down
Then it's time you stop deceiving
'cause it's too late now
I just can't go on
Holding out on myself what and what I could become
And I'm ready to start now
I will 'cause I can
I gotta get up
I gotta get up
Get off my knees... Get up... I will stand
