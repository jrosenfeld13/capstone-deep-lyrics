You're always such a spectacle
You said you would
But you never will change
You only do it if I do the same
Love is such a dangerous game
A dangerous game

At first I could see
That you were weak in the knees
Your smile was so rehearsed
When you gave me your t-shirt
On the honeymoon
Where we never left the room
Sometimes I want to go back there
But then I'll remember
I've got to remember

You're always such a spectacle
Guess it was the best you could do
Your favourite dress for the world to see through
You spilled your drink but you didn't mean to
You're always such a spectacle
You said would but you never will change
You only do it if I do the same
Love is such a dangerous game
A dangerous game

When you told me this

That wickedness is a myth
That was invented for losers
Cause baby the truth hurts
Baby the truth hurts

Well I thought you were shallow
But then I fell in deep
Why couldn't you keep it
Our little secret
You're my only weakness

You're always such a spectacle
Guess it was the best you could do
Your favourite dress for the world to see through
You spilled your drink but you didn't mean to
Love is such a spectacle
Just when you think it's going well for you
Life's a movie that we sleep through
Every little thing that we do

You're always such a spectacle
Nothing ever really does change
Cause if you feel it baby
Know I feel the same
Love is such a dangerous game
Love is such a dangerous game
A dangerous game
