Looks like a ruin, you think nothings doing
Under the arches, somethings still moving
We lie together, forever and ever
The truth be uncovered, no face in the mirror

I always said, you should leave them dead
Now this house is haunted, now look in the ruins

The day they'll discover, you're still with me my lover
The creedence is craving, the truth be uncovered
I sent them your letter, that read like a lecture
There on the pages, the laughter, the rages

She always said, we'd be better off dead
This house is haunted, the face in the mirror

Kiss me and shiver, one day they'll discover
You're with me my lover, the truth be uncovered
Kiss me and shiver, one day they'll deliver
The news of your heart, so dearly departed

I always said, we'd be better off dead
This house is haunted

She always said, I'd be better off dead
This house is haunted
