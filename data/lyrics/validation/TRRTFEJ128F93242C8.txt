Oh!

(I'm that sick
I see it that way)

I'm that sick I see it that way
I'd rather be dead then have you stay
You pretend that it's okay
Right now it's my time to take!

Feeding off my hate today
Feeding off the lives I waste
Now it's time to change my ways
Now it's time to erase my name

Can't see my face
You can't see my face (now)
Can't see my face
You can't see my face (now)
Can't see my face
You can't see my face (now)
Pass out of existence

Can't see my face
You can't see my face (now)
Can't see my face
You can't see my face (now)
Can't see my face
You can't see my face (now)
Pass out of existence

Gone!

Disgusted by your presence now
I wonder what it would be like if you were down
Could you cope?
Could you really cope?
Could you hope?
Or would you sit and wait for me?
Seeking for my placement now
Seeking for my placement now
Now it's time to change my ways
Now it's time to erase my name

Can't see my face
You can't see my face (now)
Can't see my face
You can't see my face (now)
Can't see my face
You can't see my face (now)
Pass out of existence

Can't see my face
You can't see my face (now)
Can't see my face
You can't see my face (now)
Can't see my face
You can't see my face (now)
Pass out of existence

(When I close my eyes
I see myself dead
I know you want it this way don't you?
When I close my eyes
I see myself
I want you to disappear
I want you to disappear
I wanted you to disappear
You wanted me to die)

Now
Now
Now
