I hear the music of the world a-turnin';
Can't you hear the sound of the world a-turnin'?
If you stop and listen, you can hear things grow;
You can have music wherever you go
I hear the music of the world a-turnin';
There are some folks laughin'; there are some folks cryin'
Kids playin' in the streets sound sweeter than a choir;
All you gotta do is listen to ...

Hear the music of the world a-turnin'
Can't you hear the sweet sound of the world a-turnin'
If you stop, look, and listen, you can almost hear things grow;
You can have music wherever you go
I hear a symphony of traffic in the city;
There are horns a-blowin'; there are heels a-clickin'
Hear those ashcans rattlin' as the sun begins to rise;
All you gotta do is listen to ...

Hear the music of the world a-turnin'
Can't you hear the sweet sound of the world a-turnin'
If you stop, look, and listen, you can almost hear things grow;
You can have music wherever you go

Windgot a special song for each and every day;
It's got the waves a-dancin' and the thunder clapping
Now, don't just ignore itthere's a concert all around you;
All you gotta do is listen to ...

Hear the music of the world a-turnin'
Can't you hear the sweet sound of the world a-turnin'
If you stop, look, and listen, you can almost hear things grow;
You can have music wherever you go

You can have music wherever you go
