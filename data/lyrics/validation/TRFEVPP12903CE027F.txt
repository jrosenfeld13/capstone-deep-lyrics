I wanna break my guitar
It won't get me nowhere
It's gonna scream at my fingers
I wanna rip out my hair
I wanna throw it on the ground
And turn it up real loud
Kick it with my foot
And throw it in the crowd
It don't matter anyway
If my hands
Are in the right place
Notes and chords
Mean nothing to me
Just listen and you will see
It don't matter anyway
If my hands
Are in the right place
Notes and chords
Mean nothing to me
Just listen and you will see
Stand on the stage
And you feel like an ass
You're just too cool
And this won't pass
I won't be sad
If you I play it real bad
This is ain't most fun I ever had
It don't matter anyway
If my hands
Are in the right place
Notes and chords
Mean nothing to me
Just listen and you will see
It don't matter, it don't
It don't matter anyway
If my hands
Are in the right place
Because notes and chords
They don't mean shit to me
Just listen and you will see
