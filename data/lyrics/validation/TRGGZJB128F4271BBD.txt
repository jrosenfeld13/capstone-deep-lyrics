Every day she gets a little weaker
The beauty she once knew has come and gone
We've murdered all her sons and all her daughters
The blood is on our hands, the time has come
And now she's gonna die

We've strangled all her trees and starved her creatures
There's poison in the sea and in the air
But worst of all we've learned to live without her
We've lost the very meaning of our lives
And now she's gonna die

Once she ruled the earth with love and wisdom
But we were much too smart to live her way
With greed and lust we tried to rise above her
The ignorance of man will reach an end
And now she's gonna die
