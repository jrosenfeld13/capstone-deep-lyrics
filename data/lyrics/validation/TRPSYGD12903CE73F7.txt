Cryin', who did you know
Comin' down the road?
Comin' down the road
Umm, who does ya know
Comin' down the road?
Well, it look like Maggie, little bit
But she walks too, slow

Now, the sun is gonna shine
My back door ov'are the trees
My light due somedays
Ooo-ooo
Come your turn and
My light due someday
And the wind gon' change all
Blow my blues away

Now, cc rider
See what you done, done
See what you done, done
Umm-mmm
Cc rider
See what you done, done
You done made me love you
Now you're through
Tryin'-a throw me down

Well, I'm gon' away, now
Won't be back 'till fall
Won't be back 'till fall
Well, I'm gon' away, now
Won't be back 'till fall
'Till I meet my good gal faror
Won't be back a'tol

Now, who that yonder
Comin' down the road?
Comin' down the road?
Umm-mmm
Who's that yonder
Comin' down the road?
Does it look like Maggie, a little bit
But she walks too, slow

Umm-mm, goin' baby
Won't be back' till fall
Won't be back' till fall
I'm goin' away, long
I'll be back in fall
Well, I might meet my new gal
But I, I won't be back a'tol
