The night is bitter
The stars have lost their glitter
The winds grow colder
And suddenly you're older
And all because of the man that got away

No more his eager call
The writing's on the wall
The dreams you've dreamed
Have all gone astray

The man that won you
Has run off and undone you
That great beginning
Has seen a final inning
Don't know what happened
It's all a crazy game

No more that all time thrill
For you've been through the mill
And never a new love
Will be the same

Good riddance, goodbye
Every trick of his you're onto
But fools will be fools
And where's he gone to

The road gets rougher
It's lonlier and tougher
With hope you burn up
Tomorrow he might turn up
There's just no letup
The livelong night and day

Ever since this world began
There is nothing sadder than
A one man woman
Looking for the man that got away
The man that got away
