[Chorus]
But you dont love me the way that I love you
Cause if you did, girl, you would not do those things you do
You kill my heart just to see if I will rise
Above your anger and above your lies

[Bridge]
But all I see of you is when youre not so busy
Oh, youre not so busy

[Chorus]
And you dont love me the way that I love you
Cause if you did, girl, you would not do the things you do
You turned my life around and for that, I am glad
However much I love you, this love is getting bad

[Verse 1]
And oh, my darling, you could choose
The words that only you could use
But you know youll always be my girl, girl
Ill take you out just for a bite
And show you all the city sights
But you know youll always be my girl, girl

[Chorus ]
But you dont love me the way that I love you, oh
Cause if you did, boy, you would not do those things you do
You kill my heart just to see if I will rise
Above your anger and above your lies

[Bridge]
But all I see of you is when youre not so busy
Oh, when youre not so busy
Girl, do-do-do

[Outro]
But you dont love me, you dont care, woman
And you dont love me, you dont care, oh, woman
Cause you dont love me, you dont care, woman
You dont love me, you dont care, woman
