When you said our love was dying what could I do but believe you?
When you told me to stop trying what could I do but deceive you?
What other way could I reach you?
What could I do?
What could I do?

This pain won't go away, though I want it to
This pain won't go away
But if I died tonight you'd have to think of me
I need to know, would you even cry?
If I died tonight you'd have to think of me
I won't let go, oh, no
Not while you're alive

When you said you needed nothing what could I do but to need you?
All these tears you claim a bluff and what other way could I reach you?
What could I do but deceive you? [deceive you]
What could I do?
What could I do?

This pain won't go away, though I want it to
This pain won't go away
But if I died tonight you'd have to think of me
I need to know, would you even cry?
If I died tonight you'd have to think of me
I won't let go, oh, no [no]
Not while you're alive

Hey yeah yeah yeah yeah
You know it, c'mon and say you're mine

This pain won't go away, though I want it to
This pain won't go away
But if I died tonight you'd have to think of me
I need to know, would you even cry?
If I died tonight you'd have to think of me
I won't let go, oh, no, oh
If I died tonight you'd have to think of me
I need to know, would you even cry?
If I died tonight you'd have to think of me
I won't let go, oh, no [oh]
Not while you're alive

When you said our love was dying what could I do believe you?
