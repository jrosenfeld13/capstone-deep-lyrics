You sit in the classroom bored out of your mind
Waiting for that 4 o' clock bell to go
You wanna leave the school gates far behind
Cause there's a little trick you wanna show
Dirty schoolgirls
So you've got no money you've got no things
But you don't really give a toss
You've found a use for your uniform
You've got a little trick up to kids cross(?)
Dirty schoolgirls
They can't teach you what you need to know
Out to make money and what to show
Love to seem them looking at you
And they're all dying to see what you do
Dirty schoolgirls
