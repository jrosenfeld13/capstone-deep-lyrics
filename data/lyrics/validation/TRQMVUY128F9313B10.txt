Sunshine go away today, I don't feel much like dancing
Some man's gone he's tried to run my life, he don't know what he's asking
When he tells me I better get in line, I can't hear what he's saying
When I grow up, I'm gonna make it mine, these ain't dues I been payin'

How much does it cost?
I'll buy it!
The time is all we've lost
I'll try it!
He can't even run his own life
I'll be damned if he'll run mine
Sunshine

Sunshine, go away today, I don't feel much like dancin'
Some man's gone he's tried to run my life, he don't know what he's asking
Working starts to make me wonder where fruits of what I do are going
When he says in love and war all is fair, but he's got cards he ain't showing

How much does it cost?
I'll buy it!
The time is all we've lost, I'll try it!
He can't even run his own life
I'll be damned if he'll run mine
Sunshine

Sunshine, come on back another day
I promise you I'll be singing
This old world, she's gonna turn around
Brand new bells 'il be ringing
