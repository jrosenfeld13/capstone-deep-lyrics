I search for what I need and everyday I bleed
Something in my heart that's gone
And I long for what is real
I don't know what it is that life's been missing
I feel like a stranger in this world

I, I'm going to fly, never want to die
Spirit in the Sky

Fate or free will, the choices that I make
Is freedom just illusion or something I control?
I don't know what it is that life's been missing
I feel like a stranger in this world

I, I'm going to fly, never want to die
Spirit in the Sky
I, I will arrive on the other side
Spirit in the Sky
