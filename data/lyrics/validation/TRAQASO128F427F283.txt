Cecilia in black and white
Prettily made-up eyes that look away from the camera
All eye-shadow and eye-liner

Cecilia in black and white
Prettily made-up eyes
Held to her lips, between her fingers
Her just-lit cigarette smoulders

She's everything I want
She's everything I want
Cecilia in black and white
Cecilia

A hair-grip holds her dark hair to the right
A patterned scarf around her neck tied

Her just-lit cigarette smoulders
A girl within a club in London

She's everything I want
She's everything I want
She's everything I want
