Staring at the mirror
Can you see what the mirror sees?
Where is the reflection?
A blank mind staring back at me
Watching the reaction
Trying to fake the reality
Missing in the action
I need someone to set me free

[Chorus:]
I'm lost - within my mind, within my head, within myself
Lost - within my mind, within my head, within myself

Looking through a window
Faceless strangers watching you
Staring at the victim
Trying to change my point of view
Feeling like a failure
Those who just don't have a clue
Actions of a saviour
Heartbeat kick start overdue

[Chorus:]
I'm lost - within my mind, within my head, within myself
Lost - within my mind, within my head, within myself
Lost
