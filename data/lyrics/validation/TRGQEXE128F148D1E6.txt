Well it seems that everyone we've known
Their love's grown cold, hearts turn to stone
One by one they break, it's such a shame
And now you say you wanna do the same

Don't toss us away so thoughtlessly
It just ain't right, oh can't you see?
I still love you
I want you to stay
Darlin' please, don't toss us away

Well, just think of all that we've been through
The world we were building, me and you
How could all those years be tossed away
In just one moment, in just one day?

Don't toss us away, it just ain't right
To let love die without a fight
I still love you
I want you to stay
Darlin' please, don't toss us away

So now I'm askin' once again
To understand, to be my friend
Oh, it hurts so bad to think you'd go
But still the same, I love you so

Don't toss us away, there's no reason why
Just because we're not perfect
Oh, you know, we still try
I still love you
I want you to stay
Darlin' please, don't toss us away

Oh darlin' please
Don't toss us away
