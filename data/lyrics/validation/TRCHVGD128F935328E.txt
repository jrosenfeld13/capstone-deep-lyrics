I am not gonna make it
I can see the crowd around me
Is getting bigger, & as it is
I'm trying to figure out
Why I feel so isolated
I have my friends
But don't have much time for them
I have my house
A tiny pocket in my luggage
I have my boyfriend
But he's also so tired of listening to me
Every single day
Seems like a mountain to climb
Every single word
It takes all my strength to get it out
I'm tired of talking about me
But in fact, it's the only thing
I get a grip on
I feel like I'm not gonna make it
I really feel like I'm not gonna make it
But it might be the best thing
That ever happened to me, so now

Hey little girl keep on smiling!!
'Cause they don't want to hear you complaining
You're a lucky girl
Your life's so exciting
So I'll keep on making bad jokes
'Cause you think I'm strong
& it might be the way you like it
Oh how I need you to like me

I have tried as hard as I can
I have tried to go through 9 to 5
But I was like a train
Between work and bars
Never found out what I was travelling for
Now I have my car
But I ain't got no safe place to go
I still hold my drink
But I'm not as thirsty as before
I have my voice
But I heard lately that people
Don't want to hear sad songs
Every single place
It's all the same to me
Every single face
I know it will be replaced
By another smiley one
Who will also be left soon
Somewhere behind
I feel like I'm not gonna make it
I really feel like I'm not gonna make it
But it might be the best thing
That ever happened to me, so now

Hey little girl keep on smiling!!
'Cause they don't want to hear you complaining
You're a lucky girl
Your life's so exciting
So I'll keep on making bad jokes
'Cause you think I'm strong
& it might be the way you like it
Oh how I need you to like me

Please now just don't count on me
I can't handle it anymore
& don't ask me why
If you don't want me to lie
But don't be alarmed
Don't you see that I'm just down
Just don't worry soon
I'll be back on the tracks

Smiling!!
'Cause I'll get tired of complaining
I'm a lucky girl
& I'm doing exactly what I wanted
So I'll keep on making bad jokes
'Cause I need to be strong
It might be my only chance to get out of it
& now I really need to make it!!
