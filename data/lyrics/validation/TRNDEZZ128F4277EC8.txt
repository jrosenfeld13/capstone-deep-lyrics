She screams bloody hallelujias
To the alter, these lungs of mine are closing in
And in her nasty dress like her mothers she falls between the skin
And the lines on her forehead

I have found my place, face down heading forward
And i can't sleep tonite, because all these lights are scaring me, they're scaring me tonight

Pencil thin, walking a line, about that size
But he knows the worst to come
By the black in her eyes

I have found my place, face down heading forward
And i can't sleep tonight, because all these lights are scaring me, they're scaring me tonight

But he knew what a good girl was, when he saw one

I have found my place, face down heading forward
And i can't sleep tonight, because all the lights are scaring me, there scaring me tonight

Cocaine is gonna kill baby tonite
