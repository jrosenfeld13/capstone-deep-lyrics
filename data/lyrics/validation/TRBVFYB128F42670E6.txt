Fallen into the rain
The world blurs in front of me
In the window of this cafe
I sip the truth like delicacy

Chorus:
I'm alright
I know I'm not alonge
If I can't walk to You
You know, I'll crawl

Tenacious and trembling I lift
This cup up to my mouth
I always knew it'd be like this
These waves keep rising up and down

I'm alright
I know I'm not alone
If I can't walk to You
You know, I'll crawl
I'm alright
Every day I'm coming close
If I can't walk to You
You know, I'll crawl

I set my face like a flint to the north
I watch these storms gather and sort
And I sing
I still sing

CHORUS
