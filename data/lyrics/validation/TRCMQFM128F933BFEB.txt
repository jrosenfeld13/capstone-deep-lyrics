The heavy rain feels like tears on her face
Waiting for the train, she's leaving for a new place
'Cause she and I, something wasn't right
We were so uptight, she had to say goodbye

She's going to the city, she's going to the city
She's leaving her people and all her troubles behind

The roses in the garden that she planted long ago
I put them in a vase, so I'd get a chance to know
What it was like to live with someone who could do this
What it was like to live with someone now she doesn't miss

She's going to the city, she's going to the city
She's leaving her people and all her troubles behind
And, yes, she's so happy like she never thought she could be
She's going to the city on her runaway train

I didn't know what was going on
Too busy to care about what you were living through
Living through, living through

She's going to the city, oh-oh
She's leaving her people and all her troubles behind
And, yes, she's so happy like she never thought she could be
She's going to the city on her runaway train, on her runaway train
