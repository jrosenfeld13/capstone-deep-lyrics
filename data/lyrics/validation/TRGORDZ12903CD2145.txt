[Verse 1]
I became a crystal healer and my ministry was to the sick
Creeping vines would send out runners and seek me in their numbers
I sold self-help tapes

[Refrain]
Go down to the netherworld, plant grapes

[Verse 2]
And as the word spread of my powers, they would seek me far and wide
All sad faces at my window, I would welcome them inside
I sewed clothes for them, cloaks and capes

[Refrain]
Go down to the netherworld, plant grapes

[Verse 3]
My house will be for all people who have nowhere to go
My supply of shining crystals a shield against the snow
There's more like me where I come from so mark our shapes

[Refrain ]
Go down to the netherworld, plant grapes
