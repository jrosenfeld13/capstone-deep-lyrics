Can I borrow your bones and marrow
Till I get my own
Lovely, lovely, lovely bones till I get my own
I won't tell me new friends
That they're on loan
They won't know
It's no smart thing to do
When you're far from home

Can I borrow your skin blushin to get lucky in
Lucky, lucky, lucky with a special friend
Well I hear that on planet Earth
That it's a sing big sin
Well all the more fun for me
To get lucky then

Ohhh, I'm gonna be a baby girl
A round ticket to a blue planet
Flip a uueyy at mars
Ohhh, I'm gonna swim in the water first
Blowin up her belly
Though she didn't plan it
I took the invitation
When she rocked the hammock
Pullin all the wild cards
And now I'm swinging from the stars
From an umbilical chord
From an umbilical chord
Feels like I've been here before

On my tongue on my tongue
I put your fingers on my tongue
I want some intelligent tactile
When foreign play things come
I'm gonna study em with my tongue
I want some intelligentactile 101

Can I borrow your hips and your lips
And your wink and curl
Is I is or is I ain't one flossy girl
I'm gonna paint that planet red
Cuz I'm in the world
In the world
And leave a trail of kisses
When my loves unfurled

Will you steady my ground
Dizzy ground when I'm turned around
Dizzy dizzy dizzy ground
When I'm lost you'll found
Well I'm headed to planet Earth
To search the sound
Deep sound
So keep my compass wound
When I'm on the ground

Ohhhh, I'm gonna be a baby girl
From an umbilical chord
On my tongue
