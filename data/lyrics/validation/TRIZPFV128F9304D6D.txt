The inquisition will take her to the hill
Ready for the kill, giving GOD his will
Everybody's there, none of them will care
Not a single prayer

Burn in the night, You're the devil's child
Burn in the night, You're the devil's child

Looking at the sky, soon the girl will die
Nobody will cry, hear her screaming "why?"
The priests are all in line, now they give the sign
Let the fire shine

Burn in the night, You're the devil's child
Burn in the night, You're the devil's child

They say the devil is here tonight
Then let him play his violin so wild

Higher, burning higher, flames will soon devour
Higher, burning higher, the smell of skin turned sour
Guitar solo ANDY
Higher, burning higher, her lefs are scorched by life
Ashes to ashes, I see a smile on their wicked faces
Guitar solo PETE
Burn in the night, You're the devil's child
Burn in the night, You're the devil's child
Guitar solo ANDY
Lightning from the sky, magic's coming by
As her necklace flies height into her eye
The priests are all in line, now they give the sign
Let the fire die

Burned in the night, there are no remains
Burned in the night, just a magic chain
