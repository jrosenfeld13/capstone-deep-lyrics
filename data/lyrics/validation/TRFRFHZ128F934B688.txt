I'm the upsettor holding your hand
It seems you have forgotten about your man
Alone in the darkness my bed's a different land
Your touch intensifies and I'm in the quicksand

[Chorus]
I'm in the quicksand
I'm in the quicksand

You're the upsettor stroking my hand
What's my position? I don't understand
Am I your possession, am I in demand?
Oh, when you turn to me I'm in the quicksand

[Chorus]
I'm in the quicksand
I'm in the quicksand

You, you moved into my mind again, oh
You walking around and free, oh
Oh, I could let you stay but I'm walking on broken ground again
Oh, oh, when will I learn all you do is push me back in the dark?

[Chorus]
I'm in the quicksand
I'm in the quicksand
I'm in the quicksand
I'm in the quicksand
I'm in the quicksand
