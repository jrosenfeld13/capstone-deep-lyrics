Long ago our visits were recorded on great stones
As man became more sinister he was best left alone
Those in power hid the truth though some had learned first hand
We are the real creators of what lived upon this land

For centuries your people searched for the meaning of life
Believed in many different stories
That might help them in their strife
Now for you the truth will no longer be concealed
Now the time has come for you when all will be revealed
So kneel!

We are the lords; we're your creators
Place no other before us
Kneel Down, we're your creators
Place no other before us

Who are you really and why am I here?
Way down below us, what's that blue sphere?
Is that the earth, why am I bound?
One hundred thousand miles above ground?

It's all too hard to grasp
I'm trying to believe you
I suppose that you
Made the dinosaurs too?

No, that was somebody else

What about the jungle animals
All the wildlife, cats and dogs?

Some of our finest work

Now you shall learn the truth

You were but hosts for the DNA
This precious code must not fade away
We made your kind to keep it alive
Now only you can ensure that it survives

We are the lords; we're your creators
Place no other before us
Kneel Down, we're your creators
Place no other before us

We are the lords; we're your creators
We made your world now we took it away
Kneel Down, we're your creators

Go now 'Adam', make your life you are our last recruit
Just be sure you don't partake of the forbidden fruit!

...Why was I planted here?
