You ought to see my Cindy
She lives away down south
She's so sweet the honeybees
Swarm around her mouth
The first time I saw Cindy
She was standing in the door
Her shoes and stockings in her hands
Her clothes all over the floor
I wish I were an apple
A-hangin on the tree
An' every time that Cindy passed
She'd take a bite o' me
She told me that she loved me
She called me Sugarplum
She drew her arms around me
I thought my time had come
She loved me on the mountainside
She loved me on the hill
And every time she said "I won't"
Her echo said "I will!"
She took me to the parlor
She cooled me with her fan
She said I was the prettiest thing
In the shape of mortal man
She loves me in the summertime
She loves me in the fall
If she don't love me all the time
I want no love at all
My Cindy is a pretty girl
My Cindy is a peach;
She throws her arms around my neck
And hangs on like a leech
If I had a pretty gal
I'd put her on a shelf;
Ev'ry time she smiled at me
I'd jump right up myself
Wish I had a needle and thread
Wish that I could sew
I'd sew that gal to my coat tails
And down the road we'd go

Chorus:
Get along home, Cindy Cindy
Get along home, Cindy Cindy
Get along home, Cindy Cindy
I'll marry you some day
(or I'm gonna leave you now)
