And time stood still july was prettier than anything
And though we lived beyond the end of the world with motor waste and wasteland all around
At least it was ours
Yeah time stood still and every morning was the same old thrill
Will I see you again will you speak or let them devils do that for you?
Just let me wrap my tongue around this taste
The picture you gave never goes away
How you give your life to meaningless things and all that you dream about but never will see
And here you once laid on your back in the yellow sunburned swaying grass
Yeah time stands still ten years passes just like that
Should I come up with some conclusion over what has happened
Well somewhere in america they still put poison in their foreheads for fifteen more minutes of fame
That hasn't changed it hasn't changed it's still the same still the same
And you give your life to meaningless things and all that you dream about but never will see
And here you once laid on your back in the yellow sunburned swaying grass
In the yellow sunburned swaying grass in the yellow sunburned swaying grass
