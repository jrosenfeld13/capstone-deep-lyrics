For a small girl
Barbara sure has got a big crush
The kind that makes you wanna break stuff
And blame it on a man you don't know

She came down
To New York City in a big bus
Nine hours driving
And you can't just stay home
So it doesn't matter which way you go

And now all day
The radio's been playing the same song
Can't shake that tune
But it's ok
Maybe the world isn't so small
Barbara knows
It doesn't matter at all

And each day
Barbara wakes up in a bad way
Tells me quietly she has absolutely nothing to say
But I don't seem to mind
And she says
She won't listen to our band play
She hates songs that never seem to go away
And now neither will mine

And now all day
The radio's been playing the same song
Can't shake that tune
But it's ok
Maybe the world isn't so small
Barbara knows
It doesn't matter at all

And now all day
The radio's been playing the same song
Can't shake that tune
But it's ok
Maybe the world isn't so small
Barbara knows
It doesn't matter at all

Barbara knows
Barbara knows
It doesn't matter at all

At all
At all
At all
