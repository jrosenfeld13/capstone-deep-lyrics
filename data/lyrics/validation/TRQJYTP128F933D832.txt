Waking up your fantasy
Starts by simply saying
In your world of apple trees and flowers never fading
Please take me where you wanna be
We live in childhood memories
Our little piece of heaven
In our world of make believe
We can make it happen
I wanna find what you're searching for in heaven

But sometimes I'm drowning in the rivers that you cry
Sometimes I'm sinking while I try to relate to your mind
Sometimes I'm hoping and I fear
Cause I'm so near, with you in outer space

I'm saving all the tears you cry
To fill a sea of sadness
And later when we learned to fly
We cross it our madness
We are looking down the life below
And laugh about the waves of pain
The endless days of sorrow
And never we'll come down again
There's a path to follow
We're going to find
What we're looking for in heaven

But sometimes I'm drowning in the rivers that you cry
Sometimes I'm sinking while I try to relate to your mind
Sometimes I'm hoping and I fear
Cause I'm so near, with you in outer space
With you in outer space
