Something's gone and something's over
You put the pieces of yourself together
Put them all into a suitcase
Wait for the next man, wait for the next place

You think there?s a better a place for you
Where everything will be brand new
And there you'll find yourself safe again
You won't make the same mistakes again

All your anger and misgivings
Tie your shoes up, polish your mask
But all your anger and misgivings
Makes you tattered round the edges

You think there?s a better a place for you
Where everything will be brand new
And there you'll find yourself safe again
You won't make the same mistakes again

Next time someone comes along
Gets close enough to pull a loose thread
All of you comes crashing down
And there you are back where you started

You think there?s a better a place for you
Where everything will be brand new
And there you'll find yourself safe again
You won't make the same mistakes again
