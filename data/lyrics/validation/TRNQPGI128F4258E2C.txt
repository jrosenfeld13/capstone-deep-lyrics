No Cash!
You don't wanna fuck with me
I burn churches like persons in the 3rd degree
With the strike of a match hit the gasoline
Pop Pills! Drugs kill? It's worth the thrill
Started in the Nazo pits "Quick to Draw" (one time)
Sharp like a blade, we'll cut ya like a chainsaw
Drink your blood by the pitcher until we feel drunk
Grind your fuckin' bones to lace my fuckin' blunt, punk!
Snap back crackle pop, motherfuck the cops
Always staying on my toes when I walk the block
When I go to the store, I bring my own discount
'Cause I'm sick of paying money to suck corporate cock
Yo, I know my Spanish is rusty, but my English is olde
40 down grab yourself an ice cold Colt 45
Feelin' alive drunk as fuck in the daylight
Ready to die!

Sometimes, sometimes
I count the hours
When I'm alone, all alone with a thousand downers
A life thread we're all just gonna stitch the seams
My body soaked in gasoline!

(Yo! Yo!) x5
Nazo step to this
And I'll slit your wrists
Cross you off the list
Unless you're gonna wanna throw a punch
It'll break your fist
Man up, duck down 'cuz the caps won't miss
Bust six shots on an undercover cop
They're all crooked motherfuckers and it ain't gonna stop
So hold your ground down
Run your own town
Down with the man
Let the drums sound
I'll hit you hard with accurate precision
Split decision
Yo, I'm sinning and I'm grinning
Fuck religion
Fucked up got a vision so listen
Do what makes me happy, not for money or attention
Flying on a 40, that's how I get down
You say you're the king but I'm wearing the crown
High on my throne
Sniffin' lines making deals
Got a chef in the kitchen cooking my last meal

Sometimes, Sometimes
I count the hours
When I'm alone, all alone with a thousand downers
A life thread we're all just gonna stitch the seams
My body soaked in gasoline!

Sometimes, Sometimes
I stay alive
Witness sickness in the cloudy skies
A life thread we're all just gonna stitch the seams
My body soaked in gasoline!

Body soaked in gasoline
Body soaked in gasoline
My body soaked in gasoline
Body soaked in gasoline (x4)
