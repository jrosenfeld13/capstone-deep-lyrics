When the great pyramids
Dragged themselves out to this spot
A sickness sank into the little one's heart
Mama said son
That's just the cold
That's just the emptiness
It's being alone
In the dark
You'll get used to it
You'll have friends who won't come home
You'll see their bones
Not separate yet from death
But you'll get used to it
You'll get used to it
We all get used to it
See the bloody arrow above us
See the blood that underlines it
Dark repetition
