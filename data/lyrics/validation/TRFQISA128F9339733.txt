Something to write home about
The fade of your smile
I knew you were giving up
I've known for a while

I am always here for you
I am always near by you

Your 'two for me' attitude is always the same
I laugh at the sound of your voice and I'm sorry I came
I pick up the slack for you and I sing it back to you

Hands up everyone who feels cheated
How dare it be like this?
Feel bad for the weak one I am - I let it happen
There's a thrill in something new
And i hope it lasts don't you?
And if not
I hope we do

I could fall asleep on you...
