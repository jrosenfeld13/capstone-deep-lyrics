When all the bonds are broken
When the life inside feels dead
With empty space inside you
And only shadows left
Who can bind your heart?
Take these broken fragments?
Who can build you up
And make you whole again?
It is He who binds infinity
With endless silken thread
Who weaves the verdant tapestry
And the time in which we tread
He can bind your heart
Mend these broken fragments
He can build you up
And make you whole again
