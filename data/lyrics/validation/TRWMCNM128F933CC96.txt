Deep in my thoughts in the middle of the night
You're lying next to me in the pale moonlight
Your lovely body has put a spell on me
My heart is longing for a deeper harmony

Show me your feelings, your joy and hidden fears
I want to share your laughter and your tears

I want it all, soul to soul
I give it all, soul to soul
I want it all, soul to soul
I wanna share my life with you

The walls are down, your light is shining through
We're sharing feelings that we never knew
Looking at the world through the eyes of a child
Living for the moment, our future's out of sight

Eternal river winding through the land
It has no beginning and it has no end

I want it all, soul to soul...

I want it all, soul to soul...

I want it all, soul to soul...

Soul to soul...
