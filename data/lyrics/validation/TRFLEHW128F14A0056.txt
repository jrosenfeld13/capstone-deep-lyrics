I found the love but it didn't last
Wonderful days belong to the past
I will know where I stand and what I'm to do
Tried to forget and I found someone new

So I pray on my knee's to the Heaven's above
Send me somebody please - someone to love
I'll tell you my story give me your hand
Don't let me down babe I'll try to feel sound
