[Verse 1]
Heartless, heartless
I've got something on my mind
Yeah, oh, and you keep on talking
Won't even listen my side, oh, oh
And now lately I've been
I've been thinking about our love
I've been thinking about our love
Show me something 'cause what you give is not enough--no, oh

[Chorus]
And I'm not that kind of man
Gonna stay around and plead just to please you
I'm the kind of man
Wants to live a little easier

[Verse 2]
Heartless, heartless
Even when you're in our bed
And there must be something
Some other picture in your head
There's gotta be, I don't understand
When I feel like coming
I know that there's something more, yeah, oh yeah
But I don't know, so I'm looking at the door
I'm looking at the front door now

[Chorus]
And I'm not that kind of man
Gonna stay around and plead just please you
I'm the kind of man
Wants to live a little easier

[Outro]
I'm that kind of man
I'm that kind of man
I'm that kind of man
I'm that kind of man
