Crawling on your hands and knees
You've shown us the beautiful things
Living life in a box to attain

The name across your chest means nothing to me
The things you have, don't make a man complete
Living life in a box to attain, insipid life in a box to attain

I've seen the way in which I should go
Darkened by the flash of light so false as to blind
The fad is fleeting

Crawling on your hands and knees
You've shown us the beautiful things
All the best at your grasp, facade is complete

This plow is hard and rough
My back breaks under the yoke
That has attached, that has attached

It was all a lie, it was all a lie
The way that seems
The way that seems right

And all the world is for sale
Crawling on your hands and knees
And all the world is for sale
You've shown us the beautiful things

And all the world is for sale
All the best at your grasp
And all the world is for sale
It was all a lie

It was all a lie, it was all a lie
The way that seems
The way that seems right, right

And all the world is for sale
Crawling on your hands and knees
And all the world is for sale
You've shown us the beautiful things

And all the world is for sale
All the best at your grasp
All the world is for sale
It was all a lie
