[Verse 1]
All around the world
I said listen, listen what I say now
For every boy and girl
Wanna hear some happy baby talk

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything is mine
And mine, mine because I choose you
I lose it everytime
Just to hear some of your baby talk

[Chorus 1]
Ride, ride, don't stop
Babe, baby, babe, baby, baby, baby
All your baby talk
Babe, baby, babe, baby, baby, baby
All your baby talk
Babe, baby, babe, baby, baby, baby
Now your baby talk, baby talk

[Post-Chorus]
Everything is mine
And mine, mine because I choose you
I lose it everytime
Just to hear some of your baby talk

[Verse 2]
Rosy's on my chest
I got Suzy, Suzy's on my arm now
Ride all around the world
Searching for some happy baby talk

[Chorus 2]
Red Hot, don't stop
Babe, baby, babe, baby, baby, baby
All your baby talk
Babe, baby, babe, baby, baby, baby
All your baby talk
Babe, baby, babe, baby, baby, baby
Now your baby talk, baby talk
(Got a feeling on my mind)

[Bridge]
What do you wanna hear
What do we wanna hear
What do you wanna
What do we wanna
What do we wanna hear

[Chorus 1]
Ride, ride, don't stop
Babe, baby, babe, baby, baby, baby
All your baby talk
Babe, baby, babe, baby, baby, baby
All your baby talk
Babe, baby, babe, baby, baby, baby
Now your baby talk
Babe, baby, babe, baby, baby, baby
Now your baby talk

[Outro]
Ride, ride, don't stop
The punk rock, red hot
Don't stop, the blood rock
The hard rock, the hot love yeah
The hot love, don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop yeah don't stop
