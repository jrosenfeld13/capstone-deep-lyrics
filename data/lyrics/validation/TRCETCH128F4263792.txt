Jigga man got grammys so grams cops cannot stand me
Ladies want me to put cock in they hot panties
Big man on campus six sadan
Over 100 million made niggas shipped and scanned
Niggas cannot stop, knocking that big pac
Knocking that big pun, poppin my big gun quick
Run duck as soon as the gun bust
Forget where I'm from be coughin ya lungs up
Robbin hood a the big truck
Pickin the bums up
I never know when I can be down my dumb luck
But the flow so tough I've been beatin the drums up
Been hot so long like I'm heatin the sun up
Wanna come up ones and I'm beggin niggas to run up
So I can take this heat and bang you ta next summa
Number 1 rapper dippin mo mos'
Don't make me come press ya wit this fo fo nigga
