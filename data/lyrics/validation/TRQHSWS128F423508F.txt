When the leaves turn red, our hearts beat silently
A winner's prayer
For the ones who cannot stay
Goodbye to yesterday, when all the stars seem crying
Will I once meet you again, somewhere in heaven
These days the skies are wailing and their tears tell you again, somewhere in heaven and their tears tell what I feel
Remembrance upholds me as I know you're always near
Goodbye to yesterday, when all the stars seem crying
Will I once meet you again, somewhere in heaven
