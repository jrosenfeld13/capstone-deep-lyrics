That's when the music takes me
Takes me to a brighter day
That's when the music takes me
Helping me to find my way

When the day is so long that I can't hold on
When I'm down and I think my hope is gone
Oooh, yeah
That's when the music takes me
Closer to a brighter day
I can feel my soul exploding

There's a good feeling
Helping me to find my waaay
My, my, my way

When the bluebird sings her sad, sad song
And the wind brings a cold to tag along
Oh, yeah
I can feel the spirit move me
I can almost touch the sky
Reaching for a new tomorrow
I know it's hard
But music makes me wanna try
Wanna try

And then
That's when the music takes me
Takes me to a brighter day, yeah, yeah
That's when the music takes me
Helping me to find my way
(That's when the music takes me)
(That's when the music takes me) oh, yeah
That's when the music takes me
Closer to a brighter day
I can feel my soul exploding
There's a good feeling
Helping me to find my way
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And then I'm saying
That's when the music takes me
Takes me to a brighter day
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That's when the music takes me
Helping me to find my way

Happy, happy, happy day
Happy, happy, happy day
Happy, happy, happy day, woo
(That's when the music takes me)
(That's when the music takes me)
(That's when the music takes me)
And that's when the music takes me
Happy, happy when the music takes
Woo
