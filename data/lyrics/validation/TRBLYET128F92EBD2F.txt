Lookin' up at the big sky
What do I see?
A thousand years of bullshit
Comin' down on me

Pump up your head kid
Make it cool, aaah!

Slippin' into your house girl
What do I find?
20 years of lies and confusion
Pourin' outta your mind

Pump up your head kid
Make it cool, aaah!

I'm gonna give you the big roar
I'm gonna make you see yeah, yeah
That when you pick up your freedom
It ain't exactly free

Pump up your head kid
Make it cool - aaah!

When I woke up to another day
A world of flaming angels
Standing in my way

They can't judge me till they
Wear my shoes
And I'll be laughing when they're
Singin' the blues
Singin' the blues, yeah
Singin' the blues
Singin' the blues, yeah
Singin' the blues
Singin' the blues, yeah
Singin' the blues, yeah
Singin' the blues, yeah
