Candice morganauer's gone to join
The quick and the dead clever
Tonight we're seeing her final film
Her crowning endeavour
She washed herself for years
In mouthwatering praise
But we all know she never grew up
She just shrank sideways

Yesterday was fine, I've forgotten it somehow
Last week wouldn't even show up on radar now
Last week wouldn't even show up on radar now

Winnie the obscure
He's weighing his own heart
He's been sleeping like calvin coolidge
To keep himself apart
And now he's crying
Old drella is dead, and I didn't feel a thing
And jude the pooh with a landslide smile replies
All the more power to him

Under the roofs and the gutters up above
Even the sparrows are burning up with human love
Even the sparrows are burning up with human love

Night of light
It's failing over gringley-on-the-hill
Powders are on the plantation wind
Over dallowgill
We reach the doors to the doubtful city
They close as if in pain
Out on howard devoto boulevard
I remember you and me
We're kissing in the rain

And it's all so gone
And this could never last
I'll stay with you
I'll stay with you
Against the past

It's gone
It could never last
I'll stay with you
I'll stay with you
Against the past
