Here she stands in the doorway
Her face is framed in golden light
With creamy thighs and bedroom eyes
Call it "Urchin With an Appetite"
My favorite shirt  my terry towel
A bowl of cherries in her hand
It's breakfast and some headshots
That she's bringing for her brand new man

It's a one  it's a two  it's a three
It's a three picture deal
I said a one  it's a two  it's a three
It's a three picture deal

Her new house on the hillside
Some blocks above the Sunset Strip
The yoga den is megazen
The vibey lighting ultrahip
She's gushing on her cellphone
The trainer's on eternal hold
Producer X is talking film
But the bottom line is solid gold

With a one  maybe two  even three
Yes a three picture deal
Yes it's a one  even two  or a three
Yes a three picture deal

Well she's leaving in the limo
She's sorry but they're running late
The night is here  the big premiere
It's "The Lady and the Reprobate"
Now a man like me should never be
Where a man like me does not belong
But I know they're gonna need a soundtrack
I know they're gonna need a song

For the one
Two
Three
Three picture deal
