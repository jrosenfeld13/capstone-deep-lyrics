Some kind of evil woman is bringing me down now
She don't understand what I say
She thinks it's a crime now
She look like Egyptian queen, she drivin' me crazy
Come on like a Voodoo scene, Samara she take me

She give me love fever
She give me love fever
She give me love fever
Oh love fever

She play my mind in her hand, she snake in the grass now
Slippin' and a slidin' she snide she Amazon ass now
Weavin' a spell in my head
I'm tossin' and turnin'
Feel her comin' over my bed, the fever is burnin'

She give me love fever
She give me love fever
She give me love fever
Oh love fever

She shine like night into day she set me on fire
Satori light is her way, she Passe Messiah
She Haiku Zen with her style Kyoshi Meisetso
She fire fly in the dark, she make like a Geru

She give me love fever
She give me love fever
She give me love fever
Oh love fever
