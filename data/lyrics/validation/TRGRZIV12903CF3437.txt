Hit your knees freeze, if you can
Looking up must make you feel like half a man
Try to play in tune, but the song and dance is ruined
What's the bright idea? Can't you get a real career?

It's no use trying to call bluff
And there ain't no use in you wriggling the cuffs
Try to play in tune, but the song and dance is ruined
Plain as it can be, a dog's eye view is all there is to see

Oh, a sinking feeling sets in
No defense and not a dime to drop
And a sinking feeling sets in
Can't pick up a phone and call the cops

Now you've got time on your hands
From such a big shot to half a man, (right)

No defense and not a dime to drop
A sinking feeling sets in
