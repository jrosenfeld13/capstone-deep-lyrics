I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying
As my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you

You left me and you went away
You said that you'd be back in just a day
You've broken your promise
And you've left me here alone
I don't know why you did dear
But I do know that you're gone

I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying
As my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you

Now darling, you know I love you well
Love you more than I can ever tell
I thought that you wanted me
And always would be mine
But you went and left me here
With troubles on my mind

I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying
As my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you

Now someday you may be lonesome to
Walking the floor is good for you
Just keep right on walking
And it won't hurt you to cry
Remember that I love you
And I will the day I die

I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying
As my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you
