Stayed up late last night
Lying here in bed
Looking for words
To say the things I left unsaid
Wind at my window
Whispers to me instead
And I lie alone
Writing letters in my head

Where you are, I am
Through nights that never end
Where you are, I am
In words I'll never send

Walked alone last night
Cold streets of could be anywhere
Looking for words
To share the thoughts I could not share
Road at my heels
Takes me away instead
And I walk alone
Writing letters in my head

Where you are, I am
Through streets that never end
Where you are, I am
In words I'll never send

Where you are, I am
Through nights that never end
Where you are, I am
In words I'll never send
Never, never send

Stayed up late last night
Lying here in bed
Still looking for words
Still writing letters in my head
