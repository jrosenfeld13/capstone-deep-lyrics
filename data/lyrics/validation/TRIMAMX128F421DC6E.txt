Hey listen mama
The world is done gone away
Hey listen mama
The world is done gone away
I'm got a bad luck deal
Give me trouble every day

And I'm goin', I'm goin'
Pin black tape on your door
And I'm goin', I'm goin'
Pin black tape on your door
Tell your man ain't dead
Just ain't coming to your house no more

And I'm going downtown
Goin' to stay around there till dark
And I'm going downtown
Goin' to stay around there till dark
I don't want no trouble
Don't want you to drive me home

Now when you lay down at night
Lit out early, try to take your rest
Now when you lay down at night
Lit out early, try to take your rest
You'll get a couple phone calls
Wake up and try to do your best

I'm got a gal in the country
I'm got two that stays in town
I got a girl in the country
I'm got two that stays in town
Reason I can fill it so careful
Because nar' of them don't throw me down
