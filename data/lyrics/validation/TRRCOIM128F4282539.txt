Well, you get up every morning
And you see it's still the same
All the floors and all the walls
And all the rest remains
Nothing changes fast enough
The hurry-worry days
It makes you want to give it up
And drift into a haze

Revelations seem to be another way
To make the days go fast anyways

We're all exchanging pleasantries
No matter how we feel
And no one knows the difference
'Cause it all seems so unreal
You'd better grab ahold of something
Simple, but it's true
If you don't stop to smell the roses now
They might end up on you

Expectations only mean you really think you know
What's coming next, and you don't

Yearbooks with their autographs
From friends you might have had
These are your important years
You'd better make them last
Falling in and out of love just like...
These are your important years, your life

Once you've seen the light, you suddenly
Realize it might end up all right
It might end up all right now

Yearbooks with their autographs
From friends you might have had
These are your important years
You'd better make them last
Falling in and out of love just like...
These are your important years, your life
