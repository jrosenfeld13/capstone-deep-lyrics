Sing, yeah
It's a long, long time ago
It was a strange story
A girl loved a boy
You, you have to know
When a witch is lovin'
She's losin' her magic
One cold evening at home
The boy found her broom
And lies flew away
And then she looked at him
And was filled with magic
And she said to him
And she got her magic
'Cause this is witchcraft, babe
And it is everywhere
In the wood, in the sea
And the moon got it, yeah
This is witchcraft, babe
And it is everywhere
That shimmering and glimmering
Is what I am
And Miss Elliott, with that
Really ugly tweed pullover
And those striking red shoes
They're a witness of times long ago
Close your eyes
And see that she's beautiful
But it's not the way you thought
Take care of the secrets
That old witches told
I'm not doubtful about you
See, I tie knots in my shoe laces
Let me sleep in your arms
We are at home
Where we're loved
'Cause this is witchcraft, babe
And it is everywhere
In the wood, in the sea
And the moon got it, yeah
This is witchcraft, babe
And it is everywhere
It will make you lose
If you think about shoes
Oh, oh, oh, this is witchcraft
Oh, oh, oh, this is witchcraft
Oh, oh, oh, this is witchcraft
Oh, oh, oh, this is witchcraft
Oh, oh, oh, this is witchcraft
'Cause this is witchcraft, babe
And it is everywhere
In the wood, in the sea
And the moon got it, yeah
This is witchcraft, babe
And it is everywhere
That shimmering and glimmering
Is what I am
'Cause this is witchcraft, babe
And it is everywhere
In the wood, in the sea
And the moon got it, yeah
This is witchcraft, babe
And it is everywhere
It will make you loose
If you think about shoes
Oh, oh, oh, this is witchcraft
Oh, oh, oh, this is witchcraft
Oh, oh, oh, this is witchcraft
Oh, oh, oh, this is witchcraft
Oh, oh, oh, this is witchcraft
Oh, oh, oh, this is witchcraft
