Well I listen for your footsteps
Comin' up the drive
Well I listen for your footsteps
But they don't arrive
Just a waitin' for your knockin'
On my own front door
I don't hear it that doesn't mean
You don't love me anymore

Well I hear that clock a tickin'
On the mantle shelf
Well I see the hand's a movin'
But I'm by myself
Well I wonder where you are tonight
And why I'm by myself
I don't see you it doesn't mean
You don't love me anymore

Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't make me blue
You now darlin'
I love only you
You know it hurt me so

How I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

I'm sorry that I doubted you
I was so unfair
You were in a car crash
And you lost your hair
And you said that you would be late
About an hour or two
Well that's alright baby thats alright
I'm waitin to hear from you

Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't make me blue
You now darlin'
I love only you
You know it hurt me so

Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't make me blue
You now darlin'
I love only you
You know it hurt me so
