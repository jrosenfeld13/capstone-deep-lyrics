I was never young, even as a child
Said, I was never young; I've always felt beguiled
Oh, I just never smiled, but you have a glow, a glow from an inner sense I'll never know

'Cause I was never young, even as a boy
No, I was never young; kindness seemed no ploy to temper or annoy
But you, you have a mind full of wonderment I'll never find 'cause I was never young

I was never young

Ever since I was a kid, I've been a brooding basket case
Ever since I was a kid, I've been a brooding basket case
Ever since I was a kid, I've been a brooding basket case
