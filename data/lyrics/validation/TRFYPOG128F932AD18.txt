I watch you when you're sleeping
I softly touch your skin
I can't believe that you are here with me
I never let you go
Everything feels so unreal...
So perfect and so new
You promised me that you won't hurt me
Why can't I believe?

Tell me why I feel uncertain
And put my trust in you
I'm hiding behind the wall of doubts
Unable to break free
Nothing good will last forever
Another broken dream
I'm too weak to change the future
Even if you're here with me

Another dream will turn to dust
I can not change my destiny
I am damned to fight alone
Against these gloomy shadows

I'm diving in this bloody ocean
I'm surrounded by my fear
No light will ever touch me
In this world of agony

Tell me why you feel uncertain
Put you're trust in me!
You are hiding behind the wall of doubts
But I can set you free
This pain won't last forever
I know this is our dream
Together we can change the future
As long as you are here with me

Another dream will turn to dust
I can not change my destiny
I am damned to fight alone
Against these gloomy shadows

I'm diving in this bloody ocean
I'm surrounded by my fear
No light will ever touch me
In this world of agony

Don't be afraid, this is our future
Trust me when I say
We will be together
I will always guide your way

Another dream will turn to dust
I can not change my destiny
I am damned to fight alone
Against these gloomy shadows

I'm diving in this bloody ocean
I'm surrounded by my fear
No light will ever touch me
In this world of agony
