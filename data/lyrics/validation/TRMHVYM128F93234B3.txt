[Verse 1]
Ive been running in circles all day long
Im out of breath but Im still going strong
Im going to get you, yeah, no matter what they say
You think Im losing, but I always get my way (hey!)

[Chorus]
Don't walk away when I'm talking to you
This aint no time for your bad attitude
Don't give me that face
When you know I'm really down for the chase
'Cause my heart's already in it, and I'm never going to quit it
When you finally going to get it?
Don't walk away (when I'm talking to you)

[Verse 2]
You act, act like that I dont have a clue
You think you know it all, but Im so on to you
You think you figured out just how to win this game
Im on your tracks, yeah, I know every move you make (hey!)

[Chorus]
Don't walk away when I'm talking to you
This aint no time for your bad attitude
Don't give me that face
When you know I'm really down for the chase
'Cause my heart's already in it, and I'm never going to quit it
When you finally going to get it?
Don't walk away

[Bridge]
I won't give up just like that
I'm going to make you mine if it takes everything I have

[Chorus]
Don't walk away when I'm talking to you
This aint no time for your bad attitude
Don't give me that face
When you know I'm really down for the chase
'Cause my heart's already in it, and I'm never going to quit it
When you finally going to get it?
Don't walk away

[Interlude]
(Don't walk away when I'm talking to you)
When I'm talking to you
(This aint no time for your bad attitude)
Yeah

[Outro]
Don't give me that face
When you know I'm really down for the chase
'Cause my heart's already in it, and I'm never going to quit it
When you finally going to get it?
Don't walk away
