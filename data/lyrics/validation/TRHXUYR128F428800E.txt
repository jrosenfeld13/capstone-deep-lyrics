[Verse 1]
Sometimes I wanna take you down
Sometime I wanna get you low
Brush your hair back from your eyes
Take you down, let the river flow
Sometimes I go and walk the street
Behind the green sheet of glass
A million miles below their feet
A million miles, a million miles

[Chorus]
I'll be with you girl, like being low
Hey, hey, hey, like being stoned
I'll be with you girl, like being low
Hey, hey, hey, like being stoned

[Verse 2]
A million poppies' gonna make me sleep
Just one rose and knows your name
The fruit is rusting on the vine
The fruit is calling from the trees
Hey, don't you wanna go down
Like some junkie cosmonaut
A million miles below their feet
A million miles, a million miles

[Chorus]
I'll be with you girl, like being low
Hey, hey, hey, like being stoned
I'll be with you girl, like being low
Hey, hey, hey, like being stoned

[Verse 3]
Blue, blue is the sun
A brown, brown is the sky
A green, green are her eyes
A million miles, a million miles
Hey, don't you wanna go down
Like some disgraced cosmonaut
A million miles below their feet
A million miles, a million miles

[Chorus]
I'll be with you girl, like being low
Hey, hey, hey, like being stoned
I'll be with you girl, like being low
Hey hey hey like being stoned
I'll be with you girl, like being low
Hey, hey, hey, like being stoned
I'll be with you girl, like being low
Hey hey hey like being stoned
