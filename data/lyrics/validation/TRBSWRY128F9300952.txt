In this room there's no pictures on my wall
The music plays but I can't hear it anymore

The world turns around the sun goes down
And all the ghosts inside my room
Are laughing in the evening gloom

A voice outside shadows on the wall
A thousand eyes they can't see me anymore

The world turns around the sun goes down
And all the ghosts inside my room
Are laughing in the evening gloom

Don't you know the world can be so cruel
Sometimes it leaves you feeling like a fool
The world it turns and now it's turned on you

The world turns around the sun goes down
And all the ghosts inside my room
Are laughing in the evening gloom
