My battle, slips through the back door
But it doesn't make a difference to you
My battle's over rated
Got my throat slit, in 47
Lay me face down eyes on the stars
Let me sleep in safe abandon
Yeah
Like we know
Because we know, yeah?
What makes a difference to you?
Yeah
Like we know
Because we know, yeah?
My battle, can you hear it?
Baby (softly) no ones caring
Marriage means less that is ever will
Blood boils up through the storm drains
One in three kids split the difference
Too many jackals end up in this bad
Yeah
Like we know
Because we know, yeah?
What makes a difference to you?
Yeah
Like we know
Because we know, yeah?
Stabbed with your own sword
Confetti follows the blow
We've got the head phones
But were not listening to you
