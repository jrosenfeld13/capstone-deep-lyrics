[Verse 1]
Overwhelming
I am failing
You tell me it's everything i wanted
So I'm taking it over
Won't you tell me what this means if I'm right
Some kind of distance between the lines

It's getting harder for me to control this

[Verse 2]
I will never give up what i started
Cause I'm losing everything i wanted
So I'm taking it over
Won't you tell me what this means if I'm right
Some kind of distance between the lines

It's getting harder for me to control this
But i won't let go

[Chorus 1]
What do you think of me now
That i have spoken out against you

Resist (x4)

It's getting harder for me to control this
But i won't let go

[Chorus 2]
What do you think of me now
That i have spoken out against you
Now tell me what do you think of me now
That i have spoken out against you

I have taken over!

[Verse 3]
I will never trust you
Don't tell me it's everything i wanted
Cause I've taken it over
Won't you tell me what this means if I'm right
Some kind of distance between the lines

It's getting harder for me to control this
But i won't let go
