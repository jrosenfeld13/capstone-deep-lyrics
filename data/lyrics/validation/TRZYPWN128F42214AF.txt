I never do what I'm told
I'm a fucking time bomb waiting to explode
I'm a walking revolution
I got problems, no solutions

I never do what I'm told
I'm a fucking time bomb waiting to explode
I'm a walking revolution
I got problems, no solutions...damn!

So you say I've got a problem with authority
Well I just don't know what to do
'Cause all your rules and regulations
Benefit no one but you
So I refuse to let you run my life
And be a rat in your race
So you'd better get outta my sight
Before I fuckin' smash your face!

I never do what I'm told
I'm a fucking time bomb waiting to explode
I'm a walking revolution
I got problems, no solutions...damn!

Pressure's buildin' up and I'm gonna explode
I'm gonna grab my Glock and empty my load
I'm stuck in a dead end job burger flippin'
Everybody's movin' forward but I'm slippin'
Further, further down with no hope
Every day's a struggle, I just can't cope
My head's a mess and I can't think straight
Look in my eyes and all you see is hate

I never do what I'm told
I'm a fucking time bomb waiting to explode
I'm a walking revolution
I got problems, no solutions...damn!
