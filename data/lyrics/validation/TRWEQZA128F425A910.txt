[Verse 1]
Ooh, girl it's what you say between a phrase
It's written in your face
It's rain against a windowpane the sound it makes
It's dreamin' the day away
It's the shine of a precious pearl light of the world
Smile of our baby girl
It's finding a moment for a thought so pure
It's a walk along the shore

[Bridge]
I hold on to the feeling
'Cause I don't know when I will feel it again
I've become amused by the little things
Seconds of pleasure

[Chorus](X2)
Second of pleasure
Life's little treasures

Ooh, girl, it's small talk, a touch so soft
It's watchin' you walk
It's the taste, the taste, the taste of a sour pop - a lemon drop
Last one in the box
It's a kiss in the mornin' sun, a few minutes of fun
Before you have to run
It's all of the little things that you've done to ease my burden
And my confusion

[Bridge]

[Chorus](x4)
