The devil put a sign out on the edge of town
"Live it up now before they lay you down!"
They standin' in line when I was startin' to leave
The men and the women and a coupla thieves
Now the moon ain't shinin' and the stars just hide
I can't miss that train when it blows through here tonite
The hills are howlin' and the river is risin'
And the devil don't sleep tonite
Move on up a little higher
Save my soul from the burnin' fires
The Good book is my temple, Holy Spirit's my sword
And I can't sleep until I see the Lord
The fox is in the hen house and he's handin' out keys
He's a cool politician he'll set your mind at ease
He gonna lead 'em out the front door in the broad daylight
And you best believe he's eatin chicken tonite
Now, Mother Teresa's outside beggin' for a dime
She says she needs it to fix her busted spine
She says the burden is heavy but it suits me fine
Now gimme what you got and I will tell you the time
She sang....
Move on up a little higher
Save my soul from the burnin' fires
The good Book is my temple, Holy Spirit's my sword
And I won't rest until I see the my Lord
Look at the valley, it's eerily quiet
It's a cool misconception, I won't tell you no lies
If you look a little harder and listen you'll find
People screamin' out they windows for redemption tonite
