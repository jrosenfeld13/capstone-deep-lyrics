[Verse 1]
What's that playin' on the radio?
Why do I start swayin' to and fro?
I have never heard that song before
But if I don't hear it anymore
It's still familiar to me
Sends a thrill right through me
Cause those chords remind me
Of the night that I first fell in love too

[Chorus]
Those magic changes, my heart arranges
A melody, that's never the same
A melody, that's calling your name
And begs you please, come back to me
Please, return to me
Don't go away again
Oh, make them play again
The music I wanna hear is once again
You whisper in my ear
Ohhh, my darling, uh huhh

[Verse 2]
I'll be waiting by the radio
You'll come back to me someday, I know
Been so long since our last goodbye
But I'm singin' as I cry-iy-iy
While the bass is sounding
While the drums are pounding
Beatings of my broken heart
Will rise the first place on the charts

[Outro]
Oh, my heart arranges
Ohh, those magic changes
Ohhh, ohhh, oh-ohhh
Ohhh, ohhh, oh-ohhh
Oh-oh yeah
