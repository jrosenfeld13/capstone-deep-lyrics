Oh, I'm lonely
But I only seem to need him when he's not around
Cause he comes up
At the same time that I go down

Then I give him what he needs
And then he pours it all over me
Everybody, everywhere wants something
What could it be?

That's why (that's why) girls cry
That's why (that's why, that's why) girls cry

Cause the summer
Brings heat and the winter comes and takes it away
Cause I came to work
But the boy only came to play

Then he gives me what I need
And then I tell him, "Get over me"
Everybody, everywhere wants someone
Who could it be?

That's why (that's why) girls cry
That's why (that's why, that's why) girls cry

I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna talk about it
Talk and talk and talk and talkin', ooh
Oooh-waa, oooh-waa, oooh-waa
Talk and talk and talk and talkin', ooh
Oooh-waa, oooh-waa, oooh-waa

Why bite the hand that needs you
Why break the heart that bleeds you
Why give my hand, I don't understand
Why lose a love that almost leads you?

There's a line in a dream
Where the ocean always meets the sky
If I think real fast
I can make it by the end of the night

Why can't I live my love that way
So perfect in every way
I can't stop this feeling
What could it be?

That's why (that's why, that's why) girls cry
I don't wanna talk about it
That's why (that's why, that's why) girls cry
I don't wanna talk about it

That's why (that's why, that's why) girls cry
I don't wanna talk about it
That's why (that's why, that's why) girls cry
I don't wanna talk about it

I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna talk about it
