I'd like to take a minute to apologize
For not taking advantage of you
Through all the years you passed me by
Honestly, I really wanted to be mad at you, yeah hey
For so many hours waiting, yeah
I finally know what it means to be patient, yeah
And everything has its place, yeah
And reason and I've learned that
Time waits for nothing
(No)
And everything
(Yeah)
Is gonna take its time
(For it to happen)
Time waits for nothing
(Hah)
And everything is gonna take its time
(Cause it'll happen)
Time waits for nothing
(Yeah)
And no one
(Cause everything has its time)
I used to think that if I tried
Then maybe I
Hah, could change the things that
I regretted in my past life
But through all the lessons that you taught me
I have learned my experiences enhanced my character, yeah
Now, as I look back with what I know now I can say
That I wouldn't change a thing
Cause I love who I became, yeah
And when it's all said and done
I can only live for today
Cause I've learned that
Time waits for nothing
(Yeah)
(Ho oh)
And everything
(Oh, yeah)
Is gonna take its time
(For it to happen)
Time waits for nothing
(Yeah)
And everything is gonna take its time
(Hmm)
(Things are gonna happen)
Time waits for nothing
(Yeah)
(Ho oh)
And no one
(Cause everything has its time)
(Woo woo woo woo)
I used to find it hard to believe
(Hard to believe)
(Woo woo woo woo)
And almost impossible to conceive, yeah
(To conceive)
(Woo woo woo woo)
Everything I do revolves around you
(Woo woo woo woo)
And knowing that, its kind crazy to me
(Woo woo woo woo)
Now if I had a dollar for every moment that I spent
(Woo woo woo woo)
Watching my days go by
Doing, doing, doing nothing
(Woo woo woo woo)
I probably never be penniless or hopeless
(Woo woo woo woo)
Hah ah ah ah
So for a while now, I've kept in mind
Cause what they say is true
That you are of the essence
Down to the very last second
And I'm so glad that I've grown to
Respect you
Time waits for nothing
(Yeah)
And everything
(Ho oh)
(Yeah)
Is gonna take its time
(Cause things are gonna happen)
Time waits for nothing
(Yeah)
(Ho ho, time ho)
And everything is gonna take its time
(Yeah)
(Cause things are gonna happen)
Time waits for nothing
(Yeah ha )
And everything is gonna take its time
(Yes, yea)
(Yeah hey)
Time waits for nothing
(Hah)
(Hah hah)
And everything
(Yeah yeah)
(Yeah yea)
Time waits for nothing
(Hoh)
(Ooh)
And everything is gonna take its time
(Hah)
