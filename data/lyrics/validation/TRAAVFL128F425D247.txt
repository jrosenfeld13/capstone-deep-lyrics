So we're living
Living in a world of apathy
A pathetic disease, our society
Symptomatic enmity

So we're sleeping
With a false sense of security
Sleeping in the cage of luxury
Violent serenity

Here we're laughing
Spitting at the face of anarchy
While victimized by hierarchy
Capitalistic leprosy

Now we're sipping
From the cup of irony
Raise a toast
To hypocrisy
Honesty
Fallacy

But the Word is alive
And alive is the Word
Existing
Existing inside the mind
But the heart sets the pace
Puts the change into motion
That's why the Word is alive is the Word

So we're walking
Between the walls of sanity
Encircling mendacity
Come to efface the effigy

And we're listening
Without a sense a urgency
Relying on the weight of policy
To fill the scars of humanity

Escaping
Crack the core of reality
Glimpses of eternity
Monumental idealism

But we're learning
To turn the pages of history
To realize the mystery
Behind the man and his mortality

Yeah!

But the Word is alive
And alive is the Word
Existing
Existing inside the mind
But the heart sets the pace
Puts the change into motion
That's why the Word is alive
Is the Word

Alive
Alive

Yeah!
The Word is alive
Yeah!
The Word is alive
Come on!
Yeah!
The Word is alive
Yeah!
The Word is alive
Is Alive!

But the Word is alive
And alive is the Word
Existing
Existing inside the mind
But the heart sets the pace
Puts the change into motion
That's why the Word is alive
Is the Word
But the Word is alive
And alive is the Word
Existing
Existing inside the mind
But the heart sets the pace
Puts the change into motion
That's why the Word is alive
Is the Word
Is the Word
