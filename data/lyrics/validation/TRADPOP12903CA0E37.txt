I write these lines, I write these lines with blood on the wall
My dedication for when I'm gone
What you remember if you see these words
Love hope and a bitter taste of truth

I write these lines with blood on the wall
My dedication for when I'm gone
What you remember if you see these words
Love hope and a bitter taste of truth

How long will I
Hold this to me

Making the same mistakes
Again and again
Again and again
The same mistake

I am sorry, no time to see you
Now I don't have good thoughts anymore
Would you remember
If you see these words
Love, hope and that bitter taste of truth

I wish one day this world will
Hear me
My dedication
For when I'm gone
Love, hope and a bitter taste of truth
