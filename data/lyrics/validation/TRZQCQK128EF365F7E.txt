We are all fascinated
You'll find us captivated
When we watch the shock box talk, talk, talk
It's my imagination
X, Y, Z generation
We like to watch the shock box talk, talk, talk

I've gotta get to the big city
On the other side of my TV
And everybody's going to see me
On the other side (Of my TV)
On the other side (Of my TV)
On the other side (Of my TV)

Hello my audio visual
My hi-fi super channel
Is gonna make your talk box shock, shock, shock
Never before seen footage
I've got to find the passage
Get in and make your talk box shock, shock, shock

I've gotta get to the big city
On the other side of my TV
And everybody's going to see me
On the other side of my TV
I've gotta get to the big city
On the other side of my TV
And everybody's going to see me
On the other side (Of my TV)
On the other side (Of my TV)
On the other side (Of my TV)
I'm on the other side
