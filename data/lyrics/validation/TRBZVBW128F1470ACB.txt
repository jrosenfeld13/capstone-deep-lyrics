[Verse 1]
She's only 18
Don't like the Rolling Stones
She took the short cut
To being fully grown
She's got that mood ring
A little sister rose
The smell of Springsteen
A pair of pantyhose
This talking picture show
Is leaking from a silhouette
She said "My man, you know
It's time to get your fingers wet"
Your hustle's busted
When you can't afford a cigarette
The last I heard from you
You were screaming "Handle it!"

[Hook]
Knock the world
Right off it's feet and straight onto it's head
The book of love will long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you
And what was said
Make a play
For all the brightest minds in like will share

[Verse 2]
I heard some P-Funk
Out on the road again
To get your head shrunk
Is what I recommend
It's in your bloodline
A perfect Frankenstein
Out on that lone pine
I'm going to make you mine
It's understood
You wrapped your voodoo right around my neck
You've got some glitter
On your kitty at the discotheque
I put my loving in your oven now it's time to check
The last I heard from you
You were screaming "Resurrect!"

[Hook]
Knock the world
Right off it's feet and straight onto it's head
The book of love will long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you
And what was said
Make a play
For all the brightest minds in like will share
Knock the world
Right off it's feet and straight onto it's head
The book of love will long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you
And what was said
Make a play
For all the brightest minds in like will share
