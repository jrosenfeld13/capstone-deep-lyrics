[Verse 1]
Eddie and Betty Machete
Were over faded
To the movies holdin' hands
(Holdin' hands, a-holdin' hands
A-holdin' hands, a-holdin' hands)

[Hook]
Eddie Machete
Betty spaghetti
Eddie Machete
Betty
Eddie Machete
Betty spaghetti
Eddie Machete
Betty

[Verse 2]
Machete in my hand
Spaghetti in my plan
Now
The demon in my cereal bowl
Nefarious take on charm
The Zebra, with a laser sword
Searching for his stolen bottle of Jack Daniels

[Outro]
And are you ready?
For Eddie and Betty Machete?
And are you ready?!
(I don't think so)
You better get your helmet on
It's a fight and the ring's on
You better get your helmet on
It's a fight and the ring's on
