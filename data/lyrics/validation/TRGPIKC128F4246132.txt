[Intro]
See the brightest shine, see you open your eyes
See you, see me right through the seems
You know that I'd have you
Some one to give myself to
To make more than my wildest dreams

[Verse 1]
From the first day I met you
I couldn't believe how it all clicked
How quickly I'd forget and how you fell right into me
Ever since the start
You were let into my heart
Every second I wanted to be with you and I hoped you did to

[Chorus]
Holding on to my hands
You became afraid I might fall over backwards
With the ice under your feet as well
Hoping for you to decide
Trying to make up my own mind
I swear to you I'm not a dead end street

[Verse 2]
Words can never describe what's inside me
The way you make me feel, it's as if I'd known you forever
And now I know this time its real
Love you just for who you are
I love more than the shining stars that float above
As you fall asleep at night
And as your dreams come true
I just want you to know that I miss you
And I want to be with you too

[Chorus 2]
Holding on to my hands
I'm glad you reached out to grasp onto my heart
Because I was also hooked right from the start
Only waiting for you to decide
Trying to make up my own mind
I swear to you I'm not a dead end street
