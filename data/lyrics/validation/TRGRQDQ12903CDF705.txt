Beneath the spite in shattered minds of the weak
Breathes the truth the knowing, their faith has died
Blind and unguided, they wander through desolation
Through the ashes of the world consumed

Enlightened by their hate
Bathing in their lust
Bleeding for the taste of revenge
The stricken arise

Festering deep inside manipulation
Beyond the light, the shadow's fall, this prison's hold
Awakened and growing, beyond what eyes can see
Tasting the rebirth the crowning of our king

Enlightened by their hate
Bathing in their lust
Bleeding for the taste of revenge
Thriving in their hate
Writhing in disgust
Feasting on their weakness
We rise

The path of Blind Faith. The path of Idolatry
Their path of meekness
My wrath of Sickness
My wrath of disease
My wraths dismantling
Hope of life

Beneath the spite in shattered minds of the weak
Breathes the truth the knowing, their faith has died
Blind and unguided, they wander through desolation
Through the ashes of the world consumed

Enlighten by their hate
Bathing in their lust
Bleeding for the taste of revenge
Thriving in their hate
Writhing in disgust
Feasting on their weakness
