[Verse 1]
Three spikes of fury
I can't depend on this
Deadly hesitation
Just watching from a distance
Makes you feel like hell
Fear of detection
Left in overnight
A thought can quickly disappear
None left to ration
She left me for dead
Because I have interfered
Dreams of resurrection

[Chorus]
I have wandered into red zone
Lines quickly alter the state of physical shape

[Verse 2]
It's a thrash of more than one lifetime
But I couldn't stand to think of
A more dignified way to die
To be smiling at the end of one's life

[Bridge]
Fragmented I'll hang
From her as a trophy
In the line of defense
I'll promptly agree
(I'll promptly agree)

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Pushing forward everyday
Trying to escape this maze
Pushing forward everyday
When will we find our way

Pushing forward everyday
Trying to escape this maze
Pushing forward everyday
When will we find our way

Pushing forward
Pushing forward
Pushing forward
Pushing forward
