So you wanna stay tonight and you're not bothered
What your boyfriend said, it'll be alright
But I'm just a little concerned. If you're gonna go and
Play with fire, you'll get your fingers burned

So it's your place or my place, his under the staircase
Waiting for his van to leave
Everything was alright, could've been a right night
If he'd not forgot his keys

Ohhh I'm here, you're there
He could find us anywhere
But I'll still lay you down tonight

I think we should cool things down
Maybe leave it for a little while
See if you can work things out
But then my telephone beeps and I get another
Text from you, saying you can't sleep

So it's your place or my place, hid under the staircase
Waiting for his van to leave
Everything was alright, could've been a right night
If he'd not forgot his keys

Ohhh I'm here, you're there
He could find us anywhere
But i'll still lay you down tonight

You know I didn't mean to hurt you
But it just didn't seem right
Killing time together when he's working nights

Na na na na na etc

Your place or my place, hid under the staircase
Waiting for his van to leave
Oh everything was alright, could've been a right night
If he'd not forgot his keys
Your place or my place, hid under the staircase
Waiting for his van to leave
Oh everything was alright, could've been a right night
If he'd not forgot his keys

Ohhh I'm here, you're there
He could find us anywhere
But I'll still lay you down tonight
