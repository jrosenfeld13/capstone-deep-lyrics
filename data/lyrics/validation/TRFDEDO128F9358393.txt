[Verse 1]
Aunt Clara kept her Bible right next to the phone
In case she needed a quote while she talked to someone
In my memory she smiles while the blessing is said
And visions of freeze tag dance in my head
She says Ill grow up big if I eat all my roast
Ill still believe in heaven, but I wont believe in ghosts anymore

[Chorus]
Ill put away childish things
Ill put away childish things

[Verse 2]
Every other weekend, age o' thirteen
With my fishing pole and my Field and Stream
Ridin' back home on the Trailways bus
I looked out the window til I saw too much
And I called my parents by their own first names
I played in the alley, but I didnt play the game anymore

[Chorus]
Ill put away childish things
Ill put away childish things

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
The wolves howl all night long
They wont stop and they wont go home
Beneath my window they run
Probably itll be alright
If I keep it all locked up tight
And wait til daylight comes

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Now my boy goes like a house on fire
Hell never burn out and hell never retire
And I remember when I used to think like that
When I was young and the world was flat
But Im forty-some years old now and man, I dont care
All I want now is just a comfortable chair
And to sell all my stock and live on the coast
I dont believe in heaven, but I still believe in ghosts

[Chorus]
Ive put away childish things
Ive put away childish things
Ive put away childish things
Ive put away childish things

[Outro]
The wolves howl all night long
They wont stop and they wont go home
Beneath my window they run
Probably itll be alright
If I keep it all locked up tight
And wait til daylight comes
If I wait til daylight comes
