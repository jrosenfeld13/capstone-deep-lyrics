A darkened room, a blackened hole
A septic grain turns the flesh into sand
The night is slain, the light is gone
I feel, how the vision fails me
Let them bleed, then suck them dry
A severed dream turns will to submission
This dying world, will bring rebirth
They kill, they kill for pleasure

The pathway is open
A choice must be made
I'm not afraid
Call out my name

Faceless god
A soul for a crown
His eyes are the color of blood
A life for a throne
Faceless God

Rejoice in sin, come on in
Repent no more but the scarring remains
Poisoned sheep, the flock has died
I know, how their blood still stains me
A prophecy, it comes to life
The curtain falls and out comes the truth
Whole death awaits, the memory comes
I know how the vision failed me
