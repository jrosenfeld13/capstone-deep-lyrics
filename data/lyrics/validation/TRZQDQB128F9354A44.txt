[Verse 1]
Ev'ryday we make up some of the damage done
Ev'ryday we make up when we're alone
Dust blows and follows the lost and knows no sorrow
Ev'ry [?] tomorrow, just follow this raw cold

[Chorus]
Cool down, cool down
We will catch fire
Cool down, cool down
Cool down, cool down

Cool down, cool down
We will catch fire
Cool down, cool down
Cool down, cool down

We kiss softer, embraced by sirocco
We kiss softer, and held by sirocco
We kiss softer, embraced by Sirocco
We kiss softer, and held by sirocco

[Verse 2]
Ev'ryday we tiptoe on the [?]
Ev'ryday we pray we're not too slow
We slide and follow the path we hold too dawn
We can't deny what's in our marrow: this raw cold

[Chorus]
Cool down, cool down
We will catch fire
Cool down, cool down
Cool down, cool down

Cool down, cool down
We will catch fire
Cool down, cool down
Cool down, cool down

We kiss softer, embraced by sirocco
We kiss softer and held by sirocco
We kiss softer, embraced by Sirocco
We kiss softer and held by sirocco

[Outro]
By sirocco
