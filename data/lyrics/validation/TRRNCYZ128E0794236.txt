The love was standing on is shaky ground
There ain't no way on earth to hold you down
And every road I take to you higher ooh yea ha

I gonna find a boat to row away
Where I won't be reaching for you night and day
Where there's no windows ain't no doors
To let your love in ooh I, I

I can't quit your love, ooh yeah
No matter how hard I try to
I can't quit your love, no I can't
I keep running back to you
You know I can't quit your love, ooh yeah

You snap your fingers and I feel on fire
Like silly spinning wheels of desire
You have to be a bird with wings to get me higher

The minor things for me has lose control
The weakness of my judgment rules my soul
You know you got each claim in me after the wire, ooh

I can't quit your love, ooh yeah
No matter how hard I try to
I can't quit your love, no I can't
I keep running back to you
You know I can't quit your love, ooh yeah
