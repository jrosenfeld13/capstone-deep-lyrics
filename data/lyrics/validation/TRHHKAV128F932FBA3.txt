I was about to give up and that's no lie
Cardinal landed outside my window
Threw his head back and sang a song
So beautiful it made me cry

Took me back to a childhood tree
Full of birds and dreams

From this one place I can't see very far
In this one moment I'm square in the dark
These are the things I will trust in my heart
You can see something else
Something else

I don't know what's making me so afraid
Tiny cloud over my head
Heavy and grey with a hint of dread
I don't like to feel this way

Take me back to a window seat
With clouds beneath my feet

From this one place I can't see very far
In this one moment I'm square in the dark
These are the things I will trust in my heart
You can see something else
Something else
