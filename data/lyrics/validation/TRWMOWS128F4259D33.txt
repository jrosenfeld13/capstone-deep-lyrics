I know that I love you
With all the weight of the world
Upon your shoulders
Sit back and don't let the blues
Take over your love
You got to share with the world
All the bright things you are to me
I need you baby
Look out the window
And you'll find the sky is blue
And your eyes are matching
What I'm feeling for you
I know a place we can go
Where we can get up and lose control
Let's go baby
We're soul dancing together
Hearts beating with pleasure
Soul dancing forever
Feels so sweet, like heaven
I know that you've traveled far
You're weary and you're in doubt
But I am here to hold you baby
You've got to trust in this love
It's bigger than any one of us
Believe me baby
Kick off your worries and frowns
There's no time to get down
Just move on up
Sweet now baby
I got a place that I know
Our minds and bodies will float away
Let's go baby
Chorus
Kick off your worries and frowns
There's no time to get down
Just move on up
Sweet baby
I got a place that I know
Our minds and bodies will float away
Let's go baby
Chorus
