I've been kind of tired
Maybe I've been not myself
I'm feeling like I should be putting in
So much more than what I put in
The wife, the kids are starting to get in the way
Of the important things like cars like ours like customers
Just keep smiling
And I'll try harder

Is this a joke?
I'm not laughing
I'm not trying to be difficult, cause a scene
I dress real good, I talk real good
I act exactly like I should
Just like you taught me
Like I'm part of something bigger
More fullfilling
More worthwhile than anything
Left in my life
And I'll try harder
