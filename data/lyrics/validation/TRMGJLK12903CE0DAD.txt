If I had a dollar for every word you say

I'd be the richest man alive today

That jibber jabber don't get in the way

I kind'a like it when you misbehave

Girl is on a rave - trying to be my slave

She give me that mumbo jumbo

She wants my mumbo jumbo

She loves that mumbo jumbo

She loves that mumbo jumbo, yeah

I don't mind all that crazy talk

Just keep on doin' those things that really rock

Just love the way she put me to that test

That girls amazing I don't get no rest

Don't care what you say - Gonna get you anyway

She loves that mumbo jumbo

She wants my mumbo jumbo

She loves my mumbo jumbo

Give me that mumbo jumbo, yeah

Tickle my fancy any time of day

That girl just likes when I come out to play

Just love the way she put me to that test

That girl's amazing I don't get no rest

Girl is on a rave - trying to be my slave

She loves that mumbo jumbo

She wants my mumbo jumbo

Give me that mumbo jumbo

She wants my mumbo jumbo, yeah
