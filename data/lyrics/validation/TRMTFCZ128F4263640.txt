Cottonhead, cottonhead
I say I will not
Go to Sobercity I won't
Curtailed times
Once all the best was mine
Tipp City, yeah,  I'm still here

Tammy all day
I hate old people I do
Everything dispensed that we missed
The busting studs said it was good

Whoa-----yeah!
You got me going, You got me going
Oh yeah
You got me going, You got me going

Peacock, caught looking in a mirror
Stop drinking my beer
With dawn patrol on
I wanna be a city official
'Cause no one gets ya

Whoa-----yea!
You got me going, You got me going
Ohhhhh
You got me going, You got me going

Cottonhead, cottonhead
I have relations
With anonymous internet nation
Curtailed times
Once all the best was mine
Tipp City yeah, I'm still here

Whoa-----yeah!
You got me going, You got me going
Oh yeah
You got me going, You got me going

You got me going, You got me going
You got me going, You got me going
