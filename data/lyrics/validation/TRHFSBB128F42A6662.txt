(I SET)I set
(MY FRIENDS) My friends on fire
(ON FIRE)Well I looked at your grave, I do not feel alive
(I SET) I set
(MY FRIENDS) My friends on fire
(ON FIRE) Well I looked at your eyes, I do not feel alive

I set (I SET)
My friends (MY FRIENDS)
On fire
Now I will give up
I set (I SET)
My friends (MY FRIENDS)
On fire
Now I will give my life

If I tell you now I will not feel alive
If I kill you now I will not feel pride
If I tell you now I have set those fields on fire
What's this?  One more time

(Burn!) LIES! (Lies!) ONE MORE TIME
(Burn!) LIES!  SET, ONE MORE TIME!

"Tisiv ot ecalp ecin a si lleh
Hell is a nice place to visit"

YEAH!  YEAH!
Well I gave one more time
YEAH!  YEAH!
Well I gave one more time now

"The sun came through the leaves
And lit them up
Like it was on fire
Right at sunset."

Let's look the world into the eyes
And say just one more time much less
Let's look the world into the eyes
And say just one more time, one more time

YEAH!
One more--
YEAH!
One more time
One more life
When I pray it's time
When I gave one more time
To lie into the afterlife
One more time, I praise
One more lie
