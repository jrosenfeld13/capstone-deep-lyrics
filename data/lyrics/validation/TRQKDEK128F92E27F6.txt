Welcome to the vicious circle
Welcome to the vicious circle
Where gossip runs amuck
And no one gives a fuck
Now you're caught inside
And there's no way out alive
Welcome to the vicious circle
Welcome to the vicious circle
Where hate and war rule
And people are so cruel
Now you're deep inside
No way out you'll die
Welcome to the vicious circle
Welcome to the vicious circle
