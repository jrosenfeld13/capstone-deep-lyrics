Like the sunlight falling through a fence
The image comes and goes
Memories flickering within me
Where they are I don't know

An orange light, a flash of white
Feel the sun, hear that sound within me

The past is but a moving image
It reappears then disappears
And though I can't understand its movements
It erases all those years

An orange light, a flash of white
Feel the sun, hear that sound within me
And you are there once again
And you are there once again

An orange light, a flash of white
Feel the sun, hear that sound within me

What I carry deep inside me
These feelings come and go
The past I thought was so distant
Flickers like an afterglow

And you are there once again
And you are there once again
And you are there once again
