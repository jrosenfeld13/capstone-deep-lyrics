He is alone and it seems that no one wants to know
He calls her up and she just tells him where to go
No is the answer so you try again tonight
And maybe this time he is gonna put things right!

All the time that he ends up lieing
All of the nights that he feels like dieing

Lets Face it, Lets face it now
Lets Face it, Lets face it now
Lets Face it, Lets face it now
Lets Face it, The boy can't make with girls
Lets Face it, The boy can't make with GIRLS!

Maybe he can help himself
But he'd like to make her cry
He's not responsible but no one wonders why!

And in the night he'll make her regret it
And she'll make sure that she can't forget it

Lets Face it, Lets face it now
Lets Face it, Lets face it now
Lets Face it, Lets face it now
Lets Face it, The boy can't make with girls
Lets Face it, The boy can't make with GIRLS!

Lets Face it, Lets face it now
Lets Face it, Lets face it now
Lets Face it, Lets face it NOW!
Lets Face it, The boy can't make with GIRLS!

And in the night he'll make her regret it
And he'll make sure that she can't forget it

Lets Face it, Lets face it now
Lets Face it, Lets face it now
Lets Face it, Lets face it now
Lets Face it, The boy can't make with girls
Lets Face it, The boy can't make with girls! [Repeat - some variation]

The boy can't make it with girls
