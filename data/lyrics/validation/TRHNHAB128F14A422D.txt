If you could be so kind
To help me find my mind
I'd like to thank you in advance
Know this before you start
My soul's been torn apart
I lost my mind in a wild romance

My future is my past
Its memory will last
I'll live to love the days gone by
Each day that comes and goes is like the one before
My mine is lost until the day I die

Words would fail me if I tried to describe him
Though I know he's not what he should have been
He was the Devil with face of angel
He was cruel and sweet, sweet and cruel as homemade sin
If you could be so kind
To help me find my mind
I'd like to thank you in advance
Know this before you start
My soul's been torn apart
I lost my mind in a wild romance
