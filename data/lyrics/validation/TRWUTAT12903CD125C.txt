I see girls....

I see girls
Here there and everywhere
Short skirts long hair
Love it when they walk yeah
I'm on cloud 9
You look so fine
Can't wait to make you mine
I kinda like the way you walk past
Gotta take a glance
Body shaped like an hour glass
Pulling up to my bumper so hot
You work so hard like the way you work it
I look first, you look back
Attracted to the way you shake that
Yo, I know you can't fake that
So bring it over here, so near, I can touch that
One night just isn't enough
I wanna have you givin' it up
So put ya number on the back of my hand
You got a man, but i got other plans
So baby girl, your in luck uh..

[Chorus]
Ohhhh...
You know i see you girl
You know i want you girl
Cuz your driving me crazy
Ohhhh...
You know i see you girl
You know i want you girl
Cuz your driving me crazy

Driving me crazy...

I see girls
Here there and everywhere
Short skirts long hair
Love it when they walk yeah
I'm on cloud 9
You look so fine
Can't wait to make you mine
I kinda like the way you walk past
Gotta take a glance
Body shaped like an hour glass
Pulling up to my bumper so hot
You work so hard like the way you work it
One night just isn't enough
I wanna have you givin' it up
So put ya number on the back of my hand
You got a man, but i got other plans
So baby girl, your in luck uh..

[Chorus]
Ohhhh...
You know i see you girl
You know i want you girl
Cuz your driving me crazy
