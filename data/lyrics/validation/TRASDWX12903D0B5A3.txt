The difference between fact and fiction
A quest for the young and the old
The power of sheer superstition
That often turns dirt into gold

We will end up making a baby
We will end up losing control
A job for a man and a lady
With similar spirit and soul

Do you think it's true
That our love will tear us apart?
That I'm crazy for you
But will end up breaking your heart?

In hope of some sort of reaction
I'm slightly ahead of my time
Because it gives me satisfaction
I claim what is rightfully mine

And I am in many ways a pilgrim
But my intuition has gone
In presence of ghosts and of children
You will catch me singing a song

Do you think it's true
That our love will tear us apart?
That I'm crazy for you
But will end up breaking your heart?

On a trip to the Moon
I wander inbetween the stars
They explode like balloons
It has been like that from the start

Because it gives me satisfaction
I claim what is rightfully mine

And I am in many ways a pilgrim
But my intuition has gone
In presence of ghosts and of children
You will catch me singing a song

Do you think it's true
That our love will tear us apart?
That I'm crazy for you
But will end up breaking your heart?
