[Verse 1]
Watching blood stained windows
He must just love the pain
See the children crying
His mother's died again
Dig her grave much deeper
The fatal price she paid
I hope I'm here to hold her
When she comes back again

[Chorus]
I see the death and the disaster
There is no happy ever after
The time has come
Countdown's begun [x2]

[Verse 2]
Is the Armageddon
Finally here at last?
You may see the mushroom
But you won't hear the blast
Don't need a self made prophet
Don't need a holy war
Don't need another leader
To even up the score

[Bridge]
I'm cursed with living on a fault line
The doomsday clock was made by mankind
No place to run
Countdown's begun [x3]

[Chorus]
I see the death and the disaster
There is no happy ever after
The time has come
Countdown's begun [x6]
