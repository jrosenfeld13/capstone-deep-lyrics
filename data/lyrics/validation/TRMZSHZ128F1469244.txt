You got a grown man for a boyfriend
So you better treat him just like a baby
He's a saint on Sunday, he's a bum on Monday;
The rest of the week he's just crazy

He's unpredictable, like an animal
Proud as an eagle, big and strong like a bear;
He's a snake and a frog, he's a pig and a dog;
There's a menagerie that's living in there

You'll be his princess--forever after, yes--
If you keep acting like you're always sixteen
He is the king, ruling the kingdom's his thing;
Just remember his mother is queen

Sometimes he fools around when he goes out of town
But sooner or later he's bound to get caught
He loves coming home, but then he has to roam;
Mr. Ambivalence is the guy that you've got

He's got some problems--no, you can't solve them--
He's got some goblins he can't exorcise
Mostly he wants to cry, he's afraid to die
But he's living life like it's a booby prize

He wishes he were young, a little better hung
And he's paranoid you feel that way too;
So reassure him, you'll never cure him
But he still needs his daily dose of you

You got a grown man for a boyfriend
So you better treat him just like a baby
Yeah, he's a saint on Sunday, he's a bum on Monday;
The rest of the week...
He's asleep on Sunday, he's a beast on Monday;
Rest of the week...
He's blue on Sunday, and he's manic on Monday;
Rest of the week he's just crazy
