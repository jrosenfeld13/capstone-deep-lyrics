See the sky open up, then turn crimson red
Judgement time is here tonight, all will soon be dead
Centuries past have warned about doom that has arrived
Armageddon upon the Earth, evil will arise
Unholy ones desecrate, 'cause they gotta burn
Coming from the other side, here we now return
If there's a knocking from the coffin
Then you better let us out
We rule through ultra-violence
And we are foaming at the mouth

Watch them die

This is the final Armageddon
The final judgement day
See the false run and hide
The weak will all be slayed
A massacre, a holocaust, total genocide
Face your fate like a man or choose suicide

Endless Armageddon
Endless Armageddon

Evil law desecrates the land once a whole
Swarming through the emptiness, predicted long ago
Subject to a blazing light, only to turn black
Armageddon here tonight, nothing's coming back

Endless Armageddon
Endless Armageddon

Symbols placed upon the Earth, warning all of death
Inverted minds mediate channeling the pest
Demonic forces pulling through, all will go to Hell
Flashing light blinding all, time is standing still
Fire storming demigods, time is at its end
Molten power overloads, Hell is here again
Bestow upon the powerless excruciating pain
Vital blood, drained of life, all will die today
