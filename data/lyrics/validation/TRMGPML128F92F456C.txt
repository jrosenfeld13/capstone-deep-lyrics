I, I pushed off the pier
Infinity ran cold
And filled up my ears
There's the weapon you hold
There's the thing that you hold it to
And the thing you hold dear

Oh the speed of a year
It runs the wood dry
And water unclear
There's the thing you hold high
Then there's the thing that you hold it to
And the thing you hold dear
I will be an enemy to men seen in the light
Do you think it's all right? yes, I think it's all right! it's all right!

If you make the waves the sun makes the rays
The speed of the light can be trusted to prey
To prey on the fools that pushed off your pier
The whirling of pools runs clear
Da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da
Da-da-da-dum
So I'll be out till the shimmering dies
I said I'll be out till the shimmering dies
It's the ringing of the predatory nature of the sky
And the ringing sound it makes when it's burning out your eyes
It's all right, it is all right!
It's the speed of the light
It's the speed of a year
It's the weapon you hold
And the thing you hold dear
Oh my dear, oh my dear
It's infinity's time to shine out here
If you make the waves the sun makes the rays
The speed of the light can be trusted to prey
To prey on the fools that pushed off your pier
The whirling of pools runs clear
Da-da-da-da-dum
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-dum
Da-da-dum
The rocking of boats and the making of mirrors
The whirling of pools running clear
Da-da-da-da-da-dum

Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

I hear them say, "put the weapon away"
It's the thing you know and they're taking it away
I know, but I'll find a way I'll find a way to let the dear thing go

Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum ba-da-dum

If you make the waves the sun makes the rays
The speed of the light can be trusted to prey
To prey on the fools that pushed off your pier
The whirling of pools runs clear
Da-da-da-da-dum
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-dum
Da-da-dum
The rocking of boats and the making off mirrors
The whirling of pools running clear
