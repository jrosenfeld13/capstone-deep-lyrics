Everything's laughter, always the same
When the light fades the moment ends
Empty and Restless
The fact remains
You're tied to the highs that others live

Can I talk you down tonight?
Surrender...
I'm not strong enough to fight with you anymore

I don't wanna fear with love when we're so fragile
I could never be the one to tear apart
Help me free these selfish lies and jaded alibies
With tears in my eyes i'll carry on...

Careless expressions and they're cold and vague
Stealing truth from the words you say
I cowardly reason while life escapes
Scared of running, afraid to stay

I just need a little time
Surrender...
I won't be your concubine, not for anyone...

I don't wanna fear with love when we're so fragile
I could never be the one to tear apart
Help me free these selfish lies and jaded alibies
With tears in my eyes i'll carry on...

Reach out you're not alone
Release your hope, let go
Though the light may darken as your fears unfold...

I don't wanna fear with love when we're so fragile
I could never be the one to tear apart
Help me free these selfish lies and jaded alibies
With tears in my eyes i'll carry on...

With tears in my eyes..
