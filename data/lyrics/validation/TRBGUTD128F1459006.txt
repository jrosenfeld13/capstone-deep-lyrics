The killer lives inside me: yes, I can feel him move
Sometimes he's lightly sleeping
In the quiet of his room
But then his eyes will rise and stare through mine;
He'll speak my words and slice my mind inside
Yes the killer lives
Angels live inside me: I can feel them smile...
Their presence strokes
And soothes the tempest in my mind
And their love can heal the wounds
That I have wrought
They watch me as I go to fall
- well, I know I shall be caught
While the angels live

How can I be free?
How can I get help?
Am I really me?
Am I someone else?

But stalking in my cloisters hang the acolytes
Of gloom
And Death's Head throws his cloak into
The corner of my room
And I am doomed...
But laughing in my courtyard play the pranksters
Of my youth
And solemn, waiting Old Man
In the gables of the roof:
He tells me truth...

And I too, live inside me and very often
Don't know who I am
I know I'm not a hero, but
I hope that I'm not damned:
I'm just a man, and killers, angels
All are me:
Dictators, saviours, refugees in war and peace
As long as Man lives...

I'm just a man, and killers, angels
All are me:
Dictators, saviours, refugees...
