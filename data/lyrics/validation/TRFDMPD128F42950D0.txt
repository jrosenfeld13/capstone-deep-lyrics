[Verse 1]
World without sound
Can't you keep the noise down
'Else you gonna make the baby cry
Over split blood
Heavens anyone would
Think you had an axe to grind

[Chorus]
Baby look out here come the Romans
With their steely gaze they're climbing on your sofa
Cheap veneers and a swinging brick for a heart
Forked tongues same song we're tired and we wanna go
Home

[Verse 2]
Hide the swag bag
Quick before the tongues wag
Cross your heart and claim a noble cause
Quote the scriptures
Paint your pretty pictures
Fleece them with your filthy paws

[Chorus]
Baby look out here come the Romans
With their steely gaze they're climbing on your sofa
Cheap veneers and a swinging brick for a heart
Forked tongues same song we're tired and we wanna go
Home

[Bridge]
Bad news spread fast and they're spreading
They're spreading like a chip pan fire
We must confess
We ain't progressed
Since Elvis has left the building a mess

[Verse 1]
World without sound
Can't you keep the noise down
'Else you gonna make the baby cry
Over split blood
Heavens anyone would
Think you had an axe to grind

[Chorus]
Baby look out here come the Romans
With their steely gaze they're climbing on your sofa
Cheap veneers and a swinging brick for a heart
Forked tongues same song we're tired and we wanna go
