They got me runnin' from 56 hope road
Seems my world came crashin' down a moment ago
I got this banner cross my back that says I'll be okay
And save the dyin' for some other day
When you're walkin' in my city you gotta duck and dive
'cause in the city bullets fly
They put a gun in the hand of a juvenile
When you look them in the eye things get wild
Took a little detour down to washington boulevard
Dreadlocks in the moonlight down in lee perry's yard
I'm in the wrong place at the right time
No longer in the line of fire now I'm stayin' alive

Hit it hit it get ready to roll
Your world's been fallin' down now it's startin to show

You got your reasons hidden deep behind your eyes
Your blowin' up mines crossin' over police lines
They're gonna fight against us but they will not overcome
No one's touchin' my life till my job gets done
When you're walkin' in my city you gotta duck and dive
'cause in the city bullets fly
They put a gun in the hand of a juvenile
When you look them in the eye things get wild
Now this bounty been placed upon my head
What does it really mean if a man wants me dead?
If I'm gunned down in the streets of trenchtown
Will the people come around when they hear the sound?
