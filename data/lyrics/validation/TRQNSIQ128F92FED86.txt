Then she dances
Skirt swaying in the half-light
She dances
White blossom in the black sky
'I need new clothes', she thinks
'new skin; a mind I can bear to live in'
'to live in'

Then she dances
Skirt swaying in the half-light
She dances
White blossom in the black sky
'I need new clothes', she thinks
'new skin; a mind I can bear to live in'
'to live in'
