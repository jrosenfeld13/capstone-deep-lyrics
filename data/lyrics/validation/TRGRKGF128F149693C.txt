[Intro]
Damn man...
Your life must be so happy
You've got a wife and some lovely kids
As for me...
I'm here trying to lick the life

[Chorus]
Lucky you, you've got a woman to go home to
I've got to find me myself a woman
What I wouldn't do, man
Lucky you, you got some kids to attend to
I've got to find me myself a woman
What I wouldn't do now

[Verse 1]
Ain't nothing funny
Sitting there making fun of me
Just because you've got your kids and your honey
You've got money
Damn good for you
Damn, your life must be so happy
Now on the other hand
I'm here trying to lick a life, just get a wife
Having a family would be so nice
It would bring joy to me
To find a lady who would bring a baby boy for me or a girl for me
Would mean the world

[Chorus]
Lucky you, you've got a woman to go home to
I've got to find me myself a woman
What I wouldn't do, man
Lucky you, you got some kids to attend to
I've got to find me myself a woman
What I wouldn't do now

[Verse 2]
When you reach home, your greeted with hugs and kisses
By your wife and your three lovely kids
Just to see your dinner on the table
Ain't got nothing to worry about, you've got your cable
Still got a young one coming up in the cradle
Damn man, your life must be so stable
As for me I'm unable...
Disabled...
I'm like a fable

[Chorus]
Lucky you, you've got a woman to go home to
I've got to find me myself a woman
What I wouldn't do, man
Lucky you, you got some kids to attend to
I've got to find me myself a woman
What I wouldn't do now

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when I'm passing
I would see you and your family together laughing
I would just stand there, and imagine, and staring
But right now, right now I feel alone
Right now I need someone to call my own
Right now I feel as if I'll pick up the phone and call and ask the kids if they're alright at home
But, oh...

[Chorus]
Lucky you, you've got a woman to go home to
I've got to find me myself a woman
What I wouldn't do, man
Lucky you, you got some kids to attend to
I've got to find me myself a woman
What I wouldn't do now

[Verse 1]
Ain't nothing funny
Sitting there making fun of me
Just because you've got your kids and your honey
You've got money
Damn good for you
Damn, your life must be so happy
Now on the other hand
I'm here trying to lick a life, just get a wife
Having a family would be so nice
It would bring joy to me
To find a lady who would bring a baby boy for me or a girl for me
Would mean the world

[Chorus]
Lucky you, you've got a woman to go home to
I've got to find me myself a woman
What I wouldn't do, man
Lucky you, you got some kids to attend to
I've got to find me myself a woman
What I wouldn't do now

[Outro]
Lucky you, lucky you
