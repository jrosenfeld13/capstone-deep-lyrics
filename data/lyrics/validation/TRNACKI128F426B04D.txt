Show me a place, where nothing is wrong
Where thruth sets the standards, and lies are forlorn
A place we all dream of, were greed wasnt born
A world without chaos, with no love torn

So bring deliverance, and heal all vicious wounds
Reroute all mankind, the jester of the fools
Bring forth salvation, unleash us from our fate
Come bear our burdens, before it is too late

Under the skies were reborn, unleashed from covenant sins
Into the dawn we are one, walking towards whats right

Show me a face, where nothing is wrong
A body thats flawless, a mind yet untorn
Wipe out the heavens, to end all the wars
Life has no meaning, when the world is no more
