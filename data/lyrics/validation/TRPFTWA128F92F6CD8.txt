Can You Hear Me
Hope You Can
Listen Here Closely
You'll Understand
Make Way For The Killer Race
They Use The Bible
Millimeter By Millimeter
Millimeter By Millimeter
Six Times Hot As The Sun
Didn't Mean To Hurt Anyone
Didn't Mean To Hurt Anyone
Sorry, Sorry Yeah
Don't Try To Force Them
To Help Them
Do What They Do What They Do
So The Hurting's Not On You
Chasin' For Miles
Until You're Standing Before
The Human Being Lawnmower
