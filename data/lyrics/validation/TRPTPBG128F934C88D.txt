[Verse 1]
He drink his last cup of coffee from the morning pot
Sun was going down
He loaded some shells in a twelve gauge shotgun
Got in his truck headed into town
He rode eleven miles stopped at a neighbor's house
Said I might be gone for a while
If its not too much trouble and you get the time
Would you take care of cows

[Verse 2]
He drove into town with a bad wind blowing
Stopped at a bar he had frequented
He looked over the room with his pale green eyes
Had some shots off to kill
He walked out of the bar with a band wind blowing
One thing on his mind
He looked into the window of a small cafe
And already knew what he would find
His woman of twenty years was laughing and holding hands
With a man hed never seen before
He went inside sat down at the table
Laid his shotgun on the floor

[Verse 3]
He never said a word and they both started crying
He could feel the heat in his chest
He could hear the bad wind howling
And he was ready to kill em all
And let God take care of the rest
No one will ever know why
He picked up the shotgun quietly left the room
The wind had settled down and was quiet as ashes
Took a deep breath and just stared at the moon
He felt peaceful inside headed back to his place
Sometimes its just best to ride away
