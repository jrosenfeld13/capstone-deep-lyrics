Christmas time is here again
Santa needs a helping hand
We cannot his evil sheet
To draw his laying for the night
So all the waiting christmas trees
Gonna hear their master sing....

There's no presents, Not this Christmas
There's no presents
Tom and Jerry, Drinking Sherry
They don't give a damn

Christmas time is here again
Santa needs a helping hand
It's getting very, very late
St-Peter's crossed the Golden Gate
An Donald Duck is still in bed
I wonder who he's gonna help

There's no presents, Not this christmas
There's no presents
Tom and Jerry, All done Sherry
They don't give a damn

There's no presents, Not this Christmas
There's no presents
Tom and Jerry, Still Drinking Sherry
They don't give a damn

I'm dreaming of a white.... Sabbath....
