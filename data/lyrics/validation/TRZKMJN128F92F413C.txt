Toes against the water's lip
You stood there looking...

Then you strode to the meniseus
Lighter than the air
Frail as reason, and released
Slowly torn away

Oh, farewell Kathleen

Walking on the water
God doles it out for free
I believe you- I believe you
I believe in you

Oh Frewell, Kathleen
Walking on the water

I can touch you now, I think I'm ready
Time has come: EXACT-Ly
I can touch you now
I can hear you cursing
I will never let you go
