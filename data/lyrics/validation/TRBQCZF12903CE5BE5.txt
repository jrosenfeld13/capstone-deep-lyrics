[Chorus]
We drop around the clock
Scoobity-doobity-doobity
Trippin' it down the beats along the bloc
Steady she goes
Every all is love in every way
Kiss the peace frog with conviction, say

Beats drop like codfish stocks
Scoobity-doobity-doobity
Trippin' it down the beats along the bloc
Steady she goes
Every all is love in every way
Kiss the peace frog with conviction, say

[Verse]
Dear Lordosis
Please relieve psychosis
Behaviour through osmosis
Dipsogen cirrhosis
The paranoids playin' xylophones
With rusty leucotomes
Chordates makes ideal mates
And perfect posture

Ain't it maxic how thigmotaxic
The herd hath become?
Fluoride makes you dumb
Shock the Kasbah, diffusion is next
Check the sonic death text
Are we but infinite specks
Left perplexed? No

[Chorus]
We drop like Merck Corp. stock
Scoobity-doobity-doobity
Trippin' it down the beats along the bloc
Steady she goes
Every all is love in every way
Kiss the peace frog with conviction, say

[Verse]
Circadian bowling pin manufacturer, rhythm machine
We dopamine fiends
Studies show
Geniuses pick green
So chlorophyll me upstream, how scalene
Waltzing to Rotterdam

Dirty Shirley
Knockin' on the membranes
Of reptile brains like Mr. Furley
Jack the Tripper
Pineapple juice sipper
I don't do crystal, hence no use for blipper
'Cause

[Chorus]
We drop like Merck Corp. stock
Scoobity-doobity-doobity
Thalamus gets outlined with chalk
Steady she goes
Every all is love in every way
Kiss the peace frog with conviction, say

[Verse]
To live chromatically
Or achromatically is my choice
So I choose hues
Of oranges and blues
No doubts, simple purity
Would you be my surety?
Should I arrest myself, a mea culpa?

She's golden by the gram
Words like pixie dust
She sweeps the room with a smile
And a broom, so chill
Yet so hot
Got no cover for the pot
I pray that these dreams is not for cots
So

[Chorus]
We drop around the clock
Scoobity-doobity-doobity
Trippin' it down the beats along the bloc
Steady she goes
Every all is love in every way
Kiss the peace frog with conviction, say
