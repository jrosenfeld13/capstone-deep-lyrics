You know what the others know
Seven years stay at home
Talk about the old fun
People never listen hard

I can't stay
It's got to be that way
Can't be alone
I guess that you know

Many times I heard you say
Try and last just one more day
Listen to the rain again
Trying hard to understand

I can't stay
It's got to be that way
Can't be alone
I guess that you know

I can't get along
Take me back where I belong
I've been gone too long
Take me back

I can't get along
Take me back to my home
Seven years way too long
Call me up and I'll be gone

I can't stay
It's got to be that way
Can't be alone
I guess that you know

I can't get along
Take me back where I belong
Been gone way too long
Take me back to my home
I can't get along
Got to get back there where I belong
Got to get back baby back to my home
Back to the place where I belong
Can I get back?
O Can I get back?
