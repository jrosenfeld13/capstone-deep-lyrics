God bless the USA
And only the USA
I fuckin' hate this town
I wanna make it go away!
Rednecks with riot gear and guns
Patrol, breathe down my fuckin' neck
Lookin' for any excuse...
And I'm a wreck

I won't go down, I never will
And if you put your fuckin' hands on me
Its kill or be killed!
I won't go back, I'd rather die
Die!
And if the cops catch up with me
I'll bleed tonight

I can't sleep at all tonight
The weight of youthful indiscretion
Still weighs on me all night, all night!
I won't be raped or beaten
By psychos, all in green
You won't, you won't, you won't, you won't get me!
No!

I won't go down, I never will
And if you put your fuckin' hands on me
Its kill or be killed!
I won't go back, I'd rather die
Fuckin' die!
And if the cops catch up with me
I'll bleed tonight

No black, no blue
Find someone else to abuse
Cuz' I won't be arrested tonight!
