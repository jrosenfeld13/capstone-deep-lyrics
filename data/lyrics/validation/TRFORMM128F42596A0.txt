Oh yeah! Do-do-do-oh! Santa Claus is coming to town!

Oh! You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's making a list
Checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!

So! You better watch out
Oh! You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming
Santa Claus is coming
Santa Claus is coming to town!

Do-do-do-oh!

Yeah, oh yeah! Santa Claus is coming to town!

Oh! You better watch out
You better not cry

You better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town!

He's making a list
Checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!

Oh! You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming
Santa Claus is coming
Santa Claus is coming to town!

Oh- you better watch out!
You better not cry!
You better not pout!
I'm telling you why!

Santa Claus is coming to town!
