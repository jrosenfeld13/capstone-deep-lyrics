You're no friend of mine
You've wasted all my time
You're no friend of mine
You're dancing in my garden
Dancing in my garden
There's no New Year's Party
So don't come dancing in my garden

Always knocking at my door
Please go away
Knocking at my door
Please go away

Don't try and shake my hand
Don't try and shake my hand
You'll never understand
So don't try and shake my hand
Summer came and went
But now you're back again
You'll never be my friend
So don't come round here again

Always knocking at my door
Please go away
Knocking at my door
Please go away

Always knocking at my door
Please go away
Knocking at my door
Please go away
