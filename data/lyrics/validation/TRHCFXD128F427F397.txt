On this planet anywhere you go
People reaching for the status quo
Others wanting what some others have-
And still the few who take a different path

What you do, who you are
Makes you unique and beautiful by far
So there's never reason to compare
Things missing now will soon be right there

Refrain:
When you're hot, you're hot
When you're not, you're not
Give it all you got
And you'll find a way to make it through
Straight from your heart
You'll know you've done you're part
Between you and God
And the rest will be c'est la vie'

Into all our lives some rain must fall
But we can keep our heads up through it all
If by chance we slip and hit the ground
Work to rise again - do not stay down

Keep movin', keep goin'
The hardest part is behind you now
With every step you take just do your best
Don't give up and you will pass each test

When you're hot, you're hot
When you're not, you're not
Give it all you got
And you'll find a way to make it through
Straight from your heart
You'll know you've done you're part
Between you and God
And the rest will be c'est la vie'

And so it is the life we live
Yes there's ups and downs
Throughout the life I've found
Can't let it keep me down
Again I will abound

Refrain:
When you're hot, you're hot
When you're not, you're not
Give it all you got
And you'll find a way to make it through
Straight from your heart
You'll know you've done you're part
Between you and God
And the rest will be c'est la vie'

What matters most in life is how we live-
Do we close our hands or do we give?
Love our neighbors as we love ourselves
Sacrifice our time for someone else

Keep living, keep growing
Let every day be a lesson learned
When at first I do not find success
Know my time will shine, I will possess

When you're hot, you're hot
When you're not, you're not
Give it all you got
And you'll find a way to make it through
Straight from your heart
You'll know you've done you're part
Between you and God
And the rest will be c'est la vie'

When you're hot, you're hot
When you're not, you're not
Give it all you got
And you'll find a way to make it through
Straight from your heart
You'll know you've done you're part
Between you and God
And the rest will be c'est la vie'

When you're hot, you're hot
When you're not, you're not
Give it all you got
And you'll find a way to make it through
Straight from your heart
You'll know you've done you're part
Between you and God
And the rest will be c'est la vie'
