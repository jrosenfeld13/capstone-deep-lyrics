Appear distracted; the only way to move on
So much to flee from, let's call me bitter and old
Two-hundred-fifty milligrams of escape
More weeks of TV as someone forgets my name

A brand new diet, a week's vacation I saved
I'd better settle for settling in
You'll see me happy when all the bastards are dead
When counting heartbeats means I am still alive

And all of a sudden, this insight crashes down
I'm all out of memories; they somehow wore out

Who watches watchmen? Who takes control of your life?
So much to choose from that I've got no choices left
Stay well-behaved and be good looking when you mourn
All with a surface but certainly no within

Talk of progression no matter how hard you try
This disillusion will most likely get you too
You'll see me happy when all the bastards are dead
When counting heartbeats means I've not given in
