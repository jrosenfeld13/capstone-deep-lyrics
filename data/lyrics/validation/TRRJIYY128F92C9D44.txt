Say yes to a real life ambition, say yes to our hopes and our plans
Forget about your indecision, let's get the beast off our land
A tree that can grow no longer, a beach that has got no sand
I would pay out a king's ransom, if we could just understand
Got your last meal, filled up with pesticide
Hamburger chain third world infanticide
Got robot car your jobs will disappear
It's the politics of a brand new year
Manhattanization is coming, open your eyes if you dare
Carry us on to the crossroads, come to your senses and care

16 million, I can't hear you at all

Some say that's progress
I say that's cruel

You may be safe in your hemisphere
But there's so much junk in the stratosphere
We got our eyes on the firmament, hands on the armaments
Heads full of arguments, and words for our monuments

I won't deny it, can we survive?

Some say that's progress
I say that's cruel
