I am just reaching and I want to know You
Can You take, take, take this broken light of mine
And lead me one step closer to new heights?

Now I believe I'll become who I can be
And it's You closing the distance
Now I can leave everything I've been holding on to
'Cause it's You that makes me different

My wounds are healing now and I found my hope in You
You can make, make, make this darkness shine so bright
Lead me one step closer to new heights
Yeah, I believe, I believe in You

Now I believe I'll become who I can be
And it's you closing the distance
Now I can leave everything I've been holding on to
'Cause it's You that makes me different

Take my life, change my heart, make me different
Take my fears and my hopes, make me all Yours
Take my dreams, everything that I want to be

Now I believe I'll become who I can be
Now I believe I'll become who I can be
And it's You closing the distance
Now I can leave everything I've been holding on to
'Cause it's You that makes the difference
And it's You that makes me different
