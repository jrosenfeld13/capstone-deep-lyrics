Time won't change your fate, my friend
But your fate might change with time
So listen close and surely hope or your fate may end like mine

Knee-deep in muddy waters
I had her on my mind
Now the fish won't bite
My old side
Was weak enough to die

The earth, she only spins but once
And she takes her time
The earth, she only spins but once
And she takes her time

And I wake up in the morning with my old dog by my side

Knee-deep in muddy waters
I had her on my mind
Now the fish won't bite
My old side
Was weak enough to die

The earth, she only spins but once
And she takes her time
The earth, she only spins but once
And she takes her time

And I wake up in the morning with my old dog by my side
