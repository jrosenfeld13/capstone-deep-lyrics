There's a hole in my pocket
And my hand through the hole
And my crotch beats the rhythm
Of the flashing light

It's a little too early
To pick up a bone
Or steal a souvenir
Out of a body bag

Crashes and drownings and arson fires
The birth and the breeding of desire
Meet me at the scene of the crime
Hiding a satisfaction smile, say

Blood-o-rama (oyoyo) can you feel it
Ain't nothing better to feel alive
Smell of coma (oyoyo) I can't help it
Gets me relaxed and bucked up
Ain't no drama (oyoyo) just forget it
There's no reason there's no cause
Splattered remains overdose
Cartilage holocaust

I heard a neck snappin'
Think I heard a jaw crackin'
Drunk at the wheel
Here's another pal crashin'

Half naked bodies lying dislocated
Wide opened torsos, members isolated
A real delight for the eyes
The real beauty is inside
(Check out the real beauty)

Humerus, radius, humerus, radius
Duodenum...
Humerus, radius, humerus, radius
Cerebellum...
Humerus, radius, humerus, radius
Sacrum...
Humerus, radius, humerus, radius
Chewing-Gum...

Blood-o-rama (oyoyo) can you feel it
Ain't nothing better to feel alive
Smell of coma (oyoyo) I can't help it
Gets me relaxed and bucked up
Ain't no drama (oyoyo) just forget it
There's no reason there's no cause
Splattered remains overdose
Cartilage holocaust

I heard a neck snappin'
I thought I heard a neck snappin'

All right
