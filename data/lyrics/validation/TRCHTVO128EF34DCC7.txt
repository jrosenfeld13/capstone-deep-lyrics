[Hook]
I said, the fence can't hold
Too much bull inna the pen
I said, the fence can't hold
Too much bull inna the pen
The mark of the beast is on a president
I said, the fence can't hold
Too much bull inna the pen

[Verse 1]
Round the bend, vesting supernatural force
While babies with open mouth holler and shout
Shed tears for food, to eat day and night
Ethiopia is calling, show your African pride

[Hook]
I said, the fence can't hold
Too much bull inna the pen
I said, the fence can't hold
Too much bull inna the pen

[Verse 2]
The truth doesn't make you less of a man
So mixed South-Africa no, they are lying
You can't get nothing to eat
They all are freaks
Come and get shot
Some send to the desert to suffer

[Hook]
The fence can't hold
Too much bull inna the pen
I said, the fence can't hold
Too much bull inna the pen
The mark of the beast is on a president
I said, the fence can't hold
Too much bull inna the pen

[Verse 3]
To hide the truth from my people
Why stomp and steer when technology is advance?
Your reward shall be your treat
Some walking up and down the street
With nothing to eat

[Outro]
The fence can't hold
Too much bull inna the pen
The fence can't hold
Too much bull inna the pen
Mark of the beast is on a president
I said, the fence can't hold
Too much bull inna the pen
The mark of the beast is on a president
I said, the fence can't hold
Too much bull inna the pen
Modernized, walking, up and down all over
The fence can't hold
Too much bull inna the pen
