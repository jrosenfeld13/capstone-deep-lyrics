Sweet Sixteen and youre on your own
And your family family kick you out of the house
Working part-time at diners, saving money for college
At least youre passing with Bs, so its no real tragedy

In a dark room, theyre rubbing photographs
I decided to kiss you but it felt like a downer
Since you left in a hurry and didnt speak for a week
Then you finally called and said that which you need

Its not quite quite what I expected from you
I never thought that you even even liked me
But it was just a little kiss, little kiss, little kiss
Now Im ready for more, we made out on the pier

And the sewage the sewage drag you straight to my heart
At least three years ago when I arrived from India
Wearing Morrison clothes youre the first thing I noticed
Youre the pearl in my heart, the golden seashell in my dreams

Oh in the summer nights dancing in the gay clubs
All the magic was brewing, we slept late every day
Oh I, I want to tell you Juliet
Youre the pearl in my heart, the golden seashell in my dreams

Oh the days when I didnt feel obscene
Making prank calls to China and slow dance radio station
Got your hands on my arms and my hands on your hips
Calling all the stations to request another doo-wop

Oh radio DJs play my song
All day long I want to sing along
Come on radio DJs play my song
All day long I want to sing along
Come on

She said its not quite what I expected from you
I never thought that you even even liked me
But it was just a little kiss, little kiss, little kiss
And Im ready for more we made out on the pier

And the sewage the sewage drag you straight to my heart
At least three years ago when I arrived from India
Wearing Morrison clothes youre the first thing I noticed
Youre the pearl in my heart, the golden seashell in my dreams

Oh radio DJs play my song
All day long I want to sing along
Come on radio DJs play my song
All day long I want to sing along
Come on
