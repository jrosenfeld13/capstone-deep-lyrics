Do you ever think of Portugal?
I remember seeing cedars growing tall
As we passed a verdant scenery
I blushed from its noble beauty

Your hands were fixed on to the wheel
To convey me across this country

And you drove my pain away
Left it hanging among those cedar trees
Yes you drove my pain away
Left it hanging among those cedar trees

Will you will you will you be my friend?
Even though love came to an end
You don't have to decide just yet
Take your time and measure me in your mind

I will wait so patiently
You know very well that isn't much like me

You drove my pain away
Left it hanging among those cedar trees
Yes you drove my pain away
Left it hanging among those cedar trees
