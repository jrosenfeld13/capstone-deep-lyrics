Think it's been the time that you get in fun
Think it's been the time that you settle me down
She cries, can't stand, she won't understand
Duff mouth it's not a fault. it's your turn
She can have it done fast & slow
She's not wrong
Plugged up and see take the weird sit, now she's ill
Running by don't look
By myside let it go
Think it's been the time that you get in touch
Think it's been the time that you stay in the middle
She cries, can't stand, she won't understand
Duff mouth it's not a fault. it's your turn
Breathing in the taste try the soar side
Your not wrong
Strengthed her tongue and she claimed for more
Strengthed her tongue and she wanted more
Running by don't look
By myside let it go
& i'll stand while waiting
& i'll run, hard falling
