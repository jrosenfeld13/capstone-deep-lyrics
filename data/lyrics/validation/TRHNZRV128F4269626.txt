It's so strange what we are going through
We barely know each other
Have I found what I've been searching for?
I can't believe that this is true

Far away
Out of sight
Silence tells me that I'm right
It's not fair
It's okay
Can I join you on this way?

Wish you were here

Will you wait for me until the day?
When I finally draw the line

It's not me
It's my fate
These decisions to be made
And I doubt
That I can take
Anymore of this disgrace

Wish you were here
