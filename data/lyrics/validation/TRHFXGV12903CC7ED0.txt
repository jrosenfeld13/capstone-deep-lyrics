If hip hop's deceased, I'm the rhyme of the living dead
Walking really slow with metaphors oozin' out of my head
If you're a wack rapper, I'll be somethin' you dread
'Cuz I will put you under quicker than a comfortable bed
Yall's gonna go crazy off the stuff that I said
'Cuz it's immaculate compared to most the stuff that you're fed
I wanna be thorough so I can stay ahead
And I'll be flaky and fall off like some skin bein' shed
But my skin's being she'd 'cuz I'm dead, I'm a zombie
If you didn't catch the situation previously said
And with that said, it just means my blood is no longer red
And my clothes are really tattered like I lived in a shed
I don't eat anyone, just the rappers instead
I go for backpackers and the ones that have some street cred
So don't go to sleep 'cuz I might break through your wall
And I'ma eat your ass alive while you're layin' in bed

They say hip hop is dead, so I'm sure it's in hell
All the rappers on the earth ain't doin' too well
Have to tag around the zombies killing people on sight
All the people in the world, you'd best run for your life
I walk the streets, I walk the streets at night
I walk the streets, I walk the streets at night
If you see a zombie comin', nigga run for your life
I walk the streets, I walk the streets at night

I'm filled with embalming fluid, aka Lil' Wayne
And it's really hard to rap 'cuz all the things up his brains
I once was a rapper tryin' to seek me some fame
But now I'm dead, and I can't recall the way I was slain
What probably happened was a drive-by on hip hop, right?
And then I got caught in the crossfire ridin' my bike
I had to be with him, man, me and hip hop was tight
I've been ridin' tight with hip hop for most of my life
And hip hop was popular, he had a lot of cash, right?
Which is probably why there's so many zombies at night
So we're just walkin' the streets, lookin' for rappers to eat
But about midnight there was no one in sight
See what I do is take a little off the top like Bo-Ricks
And leave a rapper packin' shookin' up like Glo-Sticks
Being a zombie really ain't as bad as you think
But hip hop is dead, so this rhyme is deceased

They say hip hop is dead, so I'm sure it's in hell
All the rappers on the earth ain't doin' too well
Have to tag around the zombies killing people on sight
All the people in the world, you'd best run for your life
I walk the streets, I walk the streets at night
I walk the streets, I walk the streets at night
If you see a zombie comin', nigga you'd best run for your life
I walk the streets, I walk the streets at night
