I will wait for this moment
When our lips collide
And almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

So I've come
To complicate the dead
Are you with me?
I've rewritten all my vows again
We're almost home
To see the silence break
On new years eve
We're only 17
If love exists
I will fall

I will wait for this moment
When our lips collide
And almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

Just one more kiss
To see the pain exists
In a world of lies
Misery take my shame alive

And everything

Fails a violent death
The smile you gave
Visit me in hell tonight
And say
"if love exists, I will fall"

I will wait for this moment
When our lips collide
And almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

I'll wait for this moment
When our lips collide
And almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

So I I laugh alone (I laugh alone)
So I I laugh alone (I laugh alone)
So I I laugh alone (I laugh alone)
So I I laugh alone (I laugh alone)

I feel so alive
I feel so alive tonight
I feel so alive
I feel so alive, can't stop this feeling

So alive
I feel so alive
I feel so alive tonight
I feel so alive
I feel so alive, can't stop this feeling

If love exists, I will fall

I will wait for this moment
When our lips collide
And almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

I will wait for this moment
When our lips collide
And almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

I will wait for this moment
When our lips collide
And almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight
