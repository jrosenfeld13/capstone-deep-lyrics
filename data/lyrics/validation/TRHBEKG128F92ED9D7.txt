Remove this blade
That has been shoved in my back
At a time that i was so fragile
You Offered Nothing
But the cold of your shoulder
And when i needed
A hand to hold
You instead offered this blade
And tore me forever
With its effect
But your intentions and hopes
Will fall to deaf ears
This heart will mend
To find strength and the beauty
Amidst this tragedy
Will be found to mend this wound
That have plauged my heart
To be born again
And to find hope in life
Remove this blade
That has been shoved in my back
At a time that i was so fragile
You Offered Nothing
But the cold of your shoulder
I stand alone but I am still standing
And I will not fall
To become something less
