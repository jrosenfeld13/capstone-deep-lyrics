Just a castaway
An island lost at sea, o
Another lonely day
With no one here but me, o
More loneliness
Than any man could bear
Rescue me before I fall into despair

I'll send an SOS to the world
I'll send an SOS to the world
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
Message in a bottle, yeah
Message in a bottle, yeah

A year has passed since I wrote my note
But I should have known this right from the start
Only hope can keep us together, yeah
Love can mend your life
But love can break your heart, o

I'll send an SOS to the world
I'll send an SOS to the world
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my

Message in a bottle, yeah
Message in a bottle, yeah

I'm sending out an SOS... (repeat)
