My first kiss was- underwater
I liked to have it- underwater
Four years old and- underwater
I waited for it- underwater

I think about it when Im alone, I wanna go
Kissin when im at home, why dont you
Just kiss me! Its just a kiss
Its just a kiss

Gave up kissin- out of water
Gave to punchin- out of water
Bloody knuckles- out of water
Gone kissin- out of water

Kisses turned to punches instead
They threw footballs at my head
Why dont You just kiss me!
Its just a kiss, Its just a kiss!

1st base, 2nd base, all the way home, I can't go kissin alone!

Back to kissin- underwater
I wanna kiss you- underwater
Gonna drown me- underwater
Gone kissin- underwater

I think about it when Im alone
I wanna go kissin when Im at home
Why dont you just kiss me!
Its just a kiss, its just a kiss!

1st base, 2nd base, 3rd base, FUCK!
