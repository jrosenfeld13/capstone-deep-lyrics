[Verse 1]
"I dont think I want this anymore"
As she drops the ring to the floor
She says to herself "You've left before
This time you will stay gone, that's for sure"

[Hook]
And he shattered something as
She dragged her suitcase down the path
To the driveway
She had never gone that far
Normally this would be
The time that she
Would let him talk her out of leaving
But this time, without crying
As she got into her car
She said...

[Chorus]
No..
Happily never after
That just ain't for me because finally
I know, I deserve better, after all
I'll never let another teardrop fall

[Verse 2]
As she drove away she starts to smile
Realized she hadn't for a while
No destination, she drove for miles
Wonderin' why she stayed in such denial

[Hook 2]
Laughing about the way he shattered something as
She dragged her suitcase down the path
To the driveway
She had never gone that far
Normally this would be
The time that she
Would let him talk her out of leaving
But this time, without crying
As she got into her car
She said

[Chorus]
No..
Happily never after
That just ain't for me because finally
I know, I deserve better, after all
I'll never let another teardrop fall

[Bridge]
I'm done, I'm done
Said I'm so done
So done, I'm done, I'm done
I'm free, I'm free, I'm free
Free to be me

[Verse 3]
She inhales in air she'd never breathed before
The air of no drama, no more
She said

[Chorus]
No..
Happily never after
That just ain't for me because finally
I know, I deserve better, after all
I'll never let another teardrop fall
No..
Happily never after
That just ain't for me because finally
I know, I deserve better, after all
I'll never let another teardrop fall
No..
Happily never after
That just ain't for me Because finally
I know, I deserve better, after all
I'll never let another teardrop fall

[Outro]
Another teardrop fall
