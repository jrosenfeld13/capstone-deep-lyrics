Mercy

If you feel like goin' crazy
If you feel like losin' your mind
Well I'll give you fare warning
No one gets out alive

Cause

This place is an animal house
Once you're in, you never get out
This place is an animal house
Once you're in, you never get out

Whoa!

If you feel your body achin'
Then you feel your body sweat
Do you know the rules we're breakin'
Do you know we ain't done yet

This place is an animal house
Once you're in, you never get out
This place is an animal house
Once you're in, you never get out

This place is an animal house
Once you're in, you never get out
This place is an animal house
Once you're in, you never, never get out, no!t

Whoa!

This place is an animal house
Once you're in, you never get out
This place is an animal house
Once you're in, you never get out

This place is an animal house
Once you're in, you never get out
This place is an animal house
Once you're in, you never get out, no!

You'll never get out
No, no, no, no
