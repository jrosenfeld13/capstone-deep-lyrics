And your face is turning hard through the winter
There's nails in our feet

Hide her
And don't break her
And we'll hide her
And we'll leave

And her blood is never spilled after dinner
And there's wine on our breath

We'll hide her
And don't wake her
And we'll hide her
And we'll leave

And you're the grandson's
You're the grandson's toy in the corner
Don't tell anyone else
And you were seen in the cherry tree
Look what you have done

'Cause you're a handsome
Just a clever boy on the border
Don't tell anyone else
And you were seen near the hollow tree
Look what you have done

You're all on your own
'Cause you said you failed to care

And there's a message in the card in your favour
And we're grinding our teeth

Hide her
And don't wake her
And we'll hide her
And we'll leave

And you're the grandson's
Just the grandson's toy in the corner
Don't tell anyone else
And you were seen in the cherry tree
Look what you have done

'Cause you're a handsome
Just a clever boy on the border
Don't tell anyone else
And you were seen near the hollow tree
Look what you have done

You're all on your own
'Cause you said you failed to care
And don't leave your morals there
And you said you failed to care

Did you fall
When we dragged her along
You will never know Thursday's gone
I called you every name from her son

Did you fall
'Cause you said you failed to share
When we dragged her along
You will never know Thursday's gone
I called you every name from her son

Did you fall
'Cause you said you failed to care
