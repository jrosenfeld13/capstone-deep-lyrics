The strands in your eyes
That colour them wonderful
Stop me and steal my breath
Emeralds from mountains
That first touch the sky
Never revealing their deaths
Tell me that we belong together
Dress it up, with the trappings of love
Ill be captivated, ill hang from your lips
Instead of shallowed heartache
From heartache that hangs from above

Ill be your crying shoulder
Ill be loves suicide
And ill be better when im older
Ill be the greatest fan of your life

Rain falls angry on the tinned roof
As we lye awake in my bed
Your my survival, your my living proof
That love is alive and not dead
So tell me that we belong together
Dress it up with the trappings of love

Ill be captivated, ill hang from your lips
Instead of shallowed heartache
From heartache that hangs from above

Ill be your crying shoulder
Ill be loves suicide
And ill be better when im older
Ill be the greatest fan of your life

And i dropped out, ive burned up
Ive fought my way back from the dead
And i tuned in, i turned on
Remember the things that you say

Cuz ill be your crying shoulder
Ill be loves suicide
And ill be better when im older
Ill be the greatest fan of you life

Ill be your crying shoulder
Ill be loves suicide
And ill be better when im older
Ill be the greatest fan of you life
