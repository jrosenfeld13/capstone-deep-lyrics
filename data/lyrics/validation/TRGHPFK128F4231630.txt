Well, you're the cutest thing that I did ever see
I really love your peaches, gonna shake your tree
Lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time
Lovey dovey, I can't get you out of my mind

Every time you kiss me you just thrill me so
So never, never, never, never let me go
Ooh baby, lovey dovey all the time
Lovey dovey, I can't get you out of my mind

I sigh with the feeling when you are near me
I'm high as the ceiling, oh baby, hear me
'Cause I'm saying that I love you, place none above you
Give it up, pretty mama, I can't wait because

My love is tumblin' down, I feel the mood
For you, my darlin', I would break my mama's rule
Oh baby, lovey dovey all the time
Lovey dovey, I can't get you out of my mind

The kiss and stealin' has got me fallin'
My head is reelin', my heart is rollin', baby
Never leave me, don't deceive me
[Incomprehensible] pretty mama, got to have you

'Cause I never, never knew the thrill of ecstasy
So tell me that it's gonna be just you and me
Lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time
Lovey dovey, I can't get you out of my mind
