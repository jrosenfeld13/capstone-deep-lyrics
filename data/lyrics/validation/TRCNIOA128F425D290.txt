[Verse 1]
Oh Mother
I pray for you, and I pray for me
I pray for you like I'd never do
And feel dreadful about it

[Chorus]
Hold me in your arms
Please hold me in your arms
Please hold me in your arms

[Verse 2]
Oh jealousy
We've been alone for too long
We've been alone; now it's history
Feed me again

[Verse 3]
Oh Mother
You were fragile when you came to me
You were discreet; you were silent
Your silent was golden

[Chorus]
Hold me in you arms
Please hold me in your arms
Please hold me, hold me, hold me in your arms

[Verse 4]
Oh Mother
You jumping jack, your plaything
Your troublemaker, your trigger
Says: "don't try again"

{Verse 5]
Oh jealousy
I was a good motherlover
For I was keen on everything
I was a dream

[Chorus]
Hold me in your arms
Please hold me in your arms
Please hold me, hold me, hold me, in your arms
In your arms, in your arms, in your arms, in your arms
