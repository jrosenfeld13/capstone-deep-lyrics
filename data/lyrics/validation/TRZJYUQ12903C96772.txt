It's a beautiful pain
When Your grace shines and touches my face
I know Your love
I've heard it sung a thousand times before

But still I cry for more
Surrender to my Lord

CHORUS
And tonight and the rest of my life
I want to live for You
Still I cry for You

Still I cry out for You

I stay completely quiet
I'm determined to rest in Your strength

But still I cry for more
Surrender to my Lord

REPEAT CHORUS

Still I cry out for You

It's a beautiful pain
When Your grace shines and touches my face
