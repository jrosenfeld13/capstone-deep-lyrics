Well tell me, tell me what your wandering now
Are you headed up north or down south?
Back in the days of the old
A little bit of knowledge was told
About the sun about sky
About the winds and why they cry
In my dream I saw a man naked in ashes he said
That there is a road far beyond
Far beyond the streets and the cars
Far beyond the clouds and the stars
Far beyond what you call God

I heard of a House, where death can not enter any more
Many rooms in this mansion all covered in gold

Over the oceans and seas they were, they were searching for me
But I hid in the crest of a wave, protected by the Lion's mane
Humbled by the sight and the sound
Let me tell you of the love I have found

I heard of a House, where death can not enter any more
Many rooms in this mansion all covered in gold

Sits upon a land where misery has lost its grip
And the rains they shower all our fear away

Well my body said just turn and run
But then I felt the light of the sun
In the heart that I thought had just died
Started coming slowly alive
We awoke in the mansion above and
Call it love

Well my body said just turn and run
But then I felt the light of the sun
In the heart that I thought had just died
Started coming slowly alive
We awoke in the mansion above and
Call it love

I heard of a House, where death can not enter any more
Many rooms in this mansion all covered in gold

Sits upon a land where misery has lost its grip
And the rains they shower all our fear away

I heard of a House, where death can not enter any more
Many rooms in this mansion all covered in gold
