One Illusion
It's one for all we're gonna pay
Too much confusion
So much abuse can't get away

It's raining blood before my eyes
It's getting dark, nowhere to hide

[Chorus]
One life One mind
We're so blind no one sees
It's a slow ride but a sure sign
We're all soon history (mes amis)
Descent
Descent

We hope that somewhere
Someone will stand up and fight
It's all a big lie
The life we live is such a crime

It's raining blood before my eyes
Glow in the dark, no place to hide

[Chorus]
One life and One mind
We're all blind can't you see
It's a slow ride but a sure sign
We're all soon history (mes amis)
Descent
Descent
Is this the end?
Descent
This is the end

It's raining blood . . 

[Chorus]
One life and One mind
We're all blind can't you see
It's a slow ride but a sure sign
We're all soon history (mes amis)
Descent
Descent
Is this the end?
Descent
