Hey, what do you know about the song and the dance in your mind
That boy is looking at you and he says that he knows your kind
I see you dancing but you never ever mark your words
Hey, what do you know I think you've done it to yourself again

[Pre-Chorus]
Have you ever felt so lonely
In this cold, world so cold
Have you ever felt so lonely

[Chorus]
She's got me dancing, she's got me dancing
She's got me dancing and she's always one step behind
She's got me dancing, she's got me dancing
She's got me dancing and she's always one step behind

Hey, you, I moved to the side
Just to live a little least of your life
That ex got a bullet aside and she likes what you did before
You see me dancing but I never ever like to talk
Hey, what do we know I think we've done it to ourselves again

[Pre-Chorus]
Have you ever felt so lonely
In this cold, world so cold
Have you ever felt so lonely

[Chorus]
She's got me dancing, she's got me dancing
She's got me dancing and she's always one step behind
She's got me dancing, she's got me dancing
She's got me dancing and she's always one step behind

[Pre-Chorus]
Have you ever felt so lonely
In this cold, world so cold
Have you ever felt so lonely

[Chorus]
She's got me dancing, she's got me dancing
She's got me dancing and she's always one step behind
She's got me dancing, she's got me dancing
She's got me dancing and she's always one step behind

She's got me dancing, she's got me dancing
She's got me dancing and she's always one step behind
She's got me dancing, she's got me dancing
She's got me dancing and she's always one step behind

She's got me dancing, she's got me dancing
She's got me dancing and she's always one step behind
She's got me dancing, she's got me dancing
She's got me dancing and she's always one step behind
