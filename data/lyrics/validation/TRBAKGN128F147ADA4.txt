[Verse 1]
I feel like I've been here once before
You threw my bags out through the door
And in the road
I came home to find them on the floor
And as the rain began to pour
I got cold

[Pre-Chorus]
And I tried to compromise
But you kept telling all these lies
Now I don't get to say my last goodbyes

[Chorus]
Goodbye to you, been wasting all my time
You're no longer mine
And now you've left me
I can't seem to get you off my mind
That's when I realised you had me hypnotized
(You had me hypnotized)

[Verse 2]
Why am I now living on my own?
She keeps inviting people home all the time
Why am I still paying for her phone?
When all the luxuries she owns should be mine

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now I start to wonder why
You shrug me off when I say hi
You treat me so bad
Despite how hard I try

[Chorus]
Goodbye to you, been wasting all my time
You're no longer mine
Now you've left me
I can't seem to get you off my mind
That's when I realised you had me hypnotized
(You had me hypnotized)

[Bridge]
Girl, you can't hold me back no more
You're not even worth me writing lyrics for
We had something good together
Did you think you were being clever
To throw me out in awful weather
How do I forget you now?

[Chorus]
I can't get you off my mind
That's when I realised you had me hypnotized
Goodbye to you, been wasting all my time
You're no longer mine
And now you've left me
I can't seem to get you off my mind
That's when I realised you had me hypnotized
