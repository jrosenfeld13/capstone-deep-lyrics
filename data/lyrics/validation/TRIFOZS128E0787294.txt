Oh, boy you're doing fine now
Oh, boy you're making time now

You were the schoolboy, nobody used to know
I was the one who made you cry all the time
I was the cool boy, everyone used to know
You were the sad boy, but now you're doing fine

Oh, boy you're doing fine now
Oh, boy you got a girlfriend
Oh, boy you're doing fine now
Oh, boy you're making time now

You walked a fine line, nobody knew your name
I made the headline, the type that was set for fame
Great expectations, we know you're gonna go far
Lame explanations, they put me in the jar

Oh boy, my mind's ajar, oh boy, oh boy

You were the loner, you got in everyone's way
Nobody got to know you until the other day
You caught me crying and introduced your eyes
I said so good to meet you, it's nice to be alive

You were the loner, you got in everyone's way
Nobody got to know you until the other day
You caught me crying and introduced your eyes
I said so good to meet you, it's nice to be alive

Oh, boy you're doing fine now
Oh, boy you're making time now

Oh, oh boy, oh, oh boy, oh, oh boy
Woe woe woe woe
