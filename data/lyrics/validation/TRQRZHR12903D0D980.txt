I know his blood can, know his blood can
I just touched... hem of his garment
Blood of Jesus, blood of Jesus
I just touched, hem of his garment

Well his blood has, well his blood has
I just touched, hem of his garment
I was a gambler just like you, I was a gambler
I just touched, hem of his garment

Oh his blood have, well his blood have..
I just touched hem of his garment
I was sick and I couldn't get well, I was sick and I couldn't get well
I just touched hem of his garment

Let his blood have, let his blood have
I just touched hem of his garment
Jesus blood can, Jesus blood can
I just touched hem of his garment

Ohh his blood have, well his blood have
I just touched hem of his garment
I was sick and I couldn't get well, I was sick and I couldn't get well
I just touched hem of his garment
