Something's missing, something's wrong
Something's not right where it belongs
Why am I doubting what I thought I knew
What's come over you

Where's the laughter where's that touch
That made me feel you were in love
I pray it's just a phase you're going through
What's come over you

BRIDGE:
I can roll with the tide, come in from the rain
Turn my back to the wind, stand my share of pain
But if you don't love me there's nothing I can do
What's come over you

All these memories of all those times
Make it so hard to say goodbye
To all those dreams we shared that won't come true
What's come over you
