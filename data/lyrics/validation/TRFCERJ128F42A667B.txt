This is the last time
Through hell i've seen your insides
Tear out your eyes, tonight you'll see

Is this where my angel lies?
I've cut you up to see me
Am I worth a thousand lies?

Infect your perfect sliced up skin
You wrote the book on silent eyes
And I wrote this song to say goodbye
This is the last time that I'll...
It's raining in cuts so bright
The screaming soothes the anger
I've never been so scared alive

When friends that crash goodbye
Their soul will change the future
And that's where the beauty in death resides

Infect your perfect sliced up skin
You wrote the book on silent eyes
And I wrote this song to say goodbye
This is the last time that I'll...

Save the rain he's alive
Save the rain he's alive
Save the rain he's alive
Save the rain he's alive

Friends that crash goodbye
Their soul will change the future
And that's where the beauty in death resides

Infect your perfect sliced up skin
You wrote the book on silent eyes
I wrote this song to say goodbye
You wrote the book on silent eyes
Well I wrote this song to say goodbye
This is the last time that I'll cry
