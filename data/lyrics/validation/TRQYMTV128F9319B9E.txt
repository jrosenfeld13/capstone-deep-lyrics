I know you'd like to stay a while
And watch her smile through the night
You are a lonely soul
You just wanted to be loved for a while
Sometimes it's just a tease
So strange a fire
You will find someone
You will find someone
You will find someone
Out there, somewhere
Try to be brave
I once when drowned in circles
Like you, I lost my way
By tide
Sometimes it's just a tease
So strange a fire
But if you keep believes
You will find someone
You will find someone
You will find someone
Out there, somewhere
Try to be brave
So brave, so brave
And I, and I
You'll find someone
You'll find someone
Out there
