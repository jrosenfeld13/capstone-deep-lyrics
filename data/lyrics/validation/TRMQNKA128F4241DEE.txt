The theatre is letting out
From the roof the raindrops fall
Like a river they should flow
But what does a raindrop know ?

Admission is a penny now
The theatre is burning down
All the faces in a crowd
Like the raindrops in a cloud
Like the river they should flow
But what does a raindrop know ?

In the backroom, fires rage
All the masks lost in a haze
How can we put on our play ?
But what does a raindrop know ?

Raindrops kill, raindrops die
They've lost their freedom from the sky
They kill for things they must not show
Die in rivers they will never know
Is it more important to come into or go ?
But what does a raindrop know ?
What does a raindrop know ?
