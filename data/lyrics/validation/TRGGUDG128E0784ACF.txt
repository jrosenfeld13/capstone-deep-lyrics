[Verse 1]
And I long to go
Love started here
Shoot your stars
Be a light
Star

[Chorus 1]
Don't you call
Deer stop, bottle in a shell
Shoot your thousand stars over me

[Post-Chorus 1]
Shoot a star
Shoot a star
To be...

[Interlude]
Love to come home
You've arrested me now

[Chorus 2]
Say my name, whisper it
Don't ever turn
I'm deliciously wired
I'm falling in a cloud

[Post-Chorus 2]
Shoot your thousand stars over...
Shoot your thousand stars over...

[Bridge]
Lalalalalalalalalalalalalala...

[Outro]
Say my name
Whisper it
