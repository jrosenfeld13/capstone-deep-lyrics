I am all that a man can be
Muscle, bone insecurity
I reasess the referencee points I use
Some of them are modest, some are huge
If you ask my lovers what I am-
They sould tell you I am a complex man
I rendevoux with women who agree to prominade my passion, and let me be
Cool water adn cold distain keep me standing sturdy and strai
I know I could have been something more
But it stikes me as a bore this (?)

Im a man with a (?) fuse
Deep pesimissm and a love of fear
I quantify the qualities I price
Reasess your meanings and meet your eyes

Cool water and cold mistakes
Keep me standing sturdy and strait
I know I could have been something more
But strikes me as a bore
This mistake

Cool water and clean cocaine
Keep me standing sturdy and strait
I know I could have been somthing more
But It strikes me as a bore this (?)

Strikes me as a little too late
