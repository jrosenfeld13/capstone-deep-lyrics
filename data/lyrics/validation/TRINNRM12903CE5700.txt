You know I seen this all before
And I know what your waiting for
But I won't be fooled again
By someone like you

I knew right from the start
That you would break my heart

Don't Call it love, Don't Call it love
Don't Call it love, Donlt call it, Don't Callit love

You know you seem so far away
But for me, just another day
You know the good times go so fast
That they never last

So if you take your time
You could change my mind

Don't call it love, don't call it love
Don't call it love, don't call it, don't call it love

Please don't call it love
From the moon and stars above
Please don't call it love
Don't call it, Don't call it love
