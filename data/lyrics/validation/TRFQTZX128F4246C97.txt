Well, me and my baby are goin' steady
We ain't married but we're gettin' ready
To tie the knot and I'm gonna make her my own
Now that I've found her I'm gonna keep her
Finders keepers, losers weepers
She's my baby she's goin' steady with me

Well, I've been honky tonkin' round nearly all my life
But now I got a steady babe and I'm gonna make her my wife
All you rovin' ramblers can leave her alone
Don't even try to date her on the phone
'Cause she's my baby, she's goin' steady with me

Well, now sweet baby that we're goin' steady
I'll pull up and ask your daddy
What he thinks if you and I are wed
'Cause I love you and you love me
We're both as happy as can be
And I hope your daddy will let you go steady with me

Well, we'll get the rings and be on our way
To see the preacher man
And when you say I do sweetheart
I'll slip the ring on your loving hand
Everything's gonna turn out fine
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
'Cause you're my baby, you're goin' steady with me...
