Open your eyes, still heavy and inflamed by late night television and tears
Tears you attribute to lack of sleep, while ignoring your soul sick weariness
Stretch out your hands, still crippled and burnt from keyboards and cigarettes
Cigarettes filled with tobacco, that out of mere historical curiosity, you wonder how would have burned, if harvested by slave
How sweet cane, cut by a nubile wench, would have tasted
How soft to the touch cotton, picked by a strong buck, would have felt
How effective indigo dye of yesteryear, would be at disguising your inadequacies
How fulfilling it would be to reclaim land still damp with the blood of first nations
Imagine all this while we fuel wars with beautiful diamonds and kill infants with horrible ignorance
A 500 year, harvest of catholic church green-housed, white-supremacist- manicured new growth patriarchs
Rotten five century fruit betrays its genetically modified, socially engineered design
Hurry, hurry, faster. We haven't much time. We're still vomiting salt so our bodies can come home
We're still walking on water, aided by the buoyant remains of our brethren
We appear like messiahs, but from below we stand hollow on the still rotting corpse of inherited shame. Come, woman
Show no deference to vacant effigies
Place this mirror-womb to the face of humanity and betray god-head proffered mythologies
Come, man
Burn your conscience
Burn it slowly
Betray us never again
Hurry n*gger
Hurry
Time is running out
Come, Child
Kill if you half to
We will burden you no more
Come, child. Bring this world to its implosive end
The time has come. This is the harbinger of a new age. We are the children of God's fire
