Riding the storm out
Waiting for the thaw out
On a full moon night in the Rocky Mountain winter

My wine bottle's low
Watching for the snow
And thinking about what I've been missing in the city

[Chorus]
And I'm not missing a thing
Watching the full moon crossing the range
Riding the storm out
Riding the storm out
Riding the storm out
Riding the storm out

Lady beside me
She's there to guide me
She says that alone we've finally found home

Well, the wind outside is frightening
But it's kinder than the lightning life in the city
It's a hard life to live, but it gives back what you give

[Chorus]
