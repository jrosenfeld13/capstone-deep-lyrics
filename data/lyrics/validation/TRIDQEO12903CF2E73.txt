Who loves the sun
Who cares that it makes plants grow
Who cares what it does
Since you broke my heart

Who loves the wind
Who cares that it makes breezes
Who cares what it does
Since you broke my heart

La, la, la, la, who loves the sun
La, la, la, la, who loves the sun
La, la, la, la, not everyone

Who loves the rain
Who cares that it makes flowers
Who cares that it makes showers
Since you broke my heart

Who loves the sun
Who cares that it is shining
Who cares what it does
Since you broke my heart

La, la, la, la, who loves the sun
La, la, la, la, who loves the sun
La, la, la, la, not everyone

La, la, la, la, who loves the sun
La, la, la, la, who loves the sun
La, la, la, la, not just anyone
La, la, la, la, who loves the sun
