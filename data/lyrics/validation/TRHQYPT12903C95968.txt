It feels like a dream
How did things all get so crazy?
I'm remembering
Before, when I felt so clean

Alone in my room
It feels like the walls are closing in
I'm thinking of you
'Cause I know what'll happen soon

I'm spinning out of control
Not knowing which way to go
Feelin' left out in the cold
I just wanna let go of it all
And climb up over the wall
I need some help
To get back on my feet
If you're out there, comfort me!

You thought you could come and take
It all without hurting me
That was your biggest mistake
Should have known
When you saw me break!

Alone in my room I sit
And pray that the walls
Stop closing in
And every breath I take's
A step further away
From the end of me

I'm spinning out of control
Not knowing which way to go
Feelin' left out in the cold
I just wanna let go of it all
And climb up over the wall
I need some help
To get back on my feet
If you're out there, comfort me!

(I wanna get this off my mind
There's no one else I can tell
Please listen to me
I just need you to listen to me
Come listen to me!

In a world where confusion
Is only an illusion
And fear itself is just another
Weak-minded solution
I live in a generation
With too much information
Instead of bonding together
We bring anger to the nation
My faith is the only thing I've got
And no one can take that from me
No one, nothing, there's no one
Who can take that from me!)

I'm spinning out of control
Not knowing which way to go
Feelin' left out in the cold
I just wanna let go of it all
And climb up over the wall
I need some help
To get back on my feet
If you're out there, comfort me!

I just wanna let go of it all
And climb up over the wall
I need some help
To get back on my feet
If you're out there, cover me!
