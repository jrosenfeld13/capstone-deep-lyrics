Gazing into outer space
My telescope sent me to another planet
Since I was a child
I yearned to wear the rings around Saturn
My fingers burned

But when you hold me baby
That's the only time
I'm content, element, so sublime
Don't it make you wonder that your universal lover
Could be wearing the same smile

Oooh, you are my starchild...
Baby, beam me
Baby, beam me up, up
Drink the milky from the Milky Way cup

Hold me tighter
Touch me, then do
All of the sweet things that star lovers do

Visions of another time
A strong pyramid where secrets of life hid
Ancient Hieroglyphics told
Of one man touching like Midas
He turned my love to gold

And when you hold me, baby
And I wear your magic ring
I feel you like no one in this world I've seen
Don't it make you wonder that your universal lover
Could be wearing the same smile

Ooooh, you are my starchild...
Baby, beam me
Baby, beam me up, up
Drink the milky from the Milky Way cup

Hold me tighter
Touch me, then do
All of the sweet things that star lovers do

Take me to your heaven
I'll lay your odds to seven
And the stars up in the sky
I can see them in your eyes

Ooooh
You are my starchild
Starchild
Starchild
