Well isn't it a lovely day
Oh, I'm feeling all brand new
Well isn't it a lovely day
Oh, boating on sunday with you

And if you really want to kiss her
Just go right up and tell her
Oh, isn't it a lovely day for love

Well isn't it a lovely day
Oh, my patio's on fire
Well isn't it a lovely day?
Oh, no words of wisdom from liars

And if you really want to kiss her
Just go right up and tell her
Oh, isn't it a lovely day for

Mae'n bwrw glaw
So dal fy llaw
Ond mae'r gaeaf mor hir
Mae'n cymryd gormod o tir

Dal fy llaw
Mae'n bwrw glaw
Ond mae'r gaeaf mor hir
Mae'n cymryd gormod o tir
