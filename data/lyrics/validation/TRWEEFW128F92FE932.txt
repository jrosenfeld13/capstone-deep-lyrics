You're my love
You're my angel
You're the girl of my dreams
And I'd like to thank you
For waiting patiently
Daddy's home-Daddy's home -To stay

How I've waited for this moment
To be by your side
Your best friend wrote and told me
You had tear drops in you eyes
Daddy's home- Daddy's Home-To stay

It wasn't on a Sunday
(Monday and Tuesday went by)
It wasn't on a Tuesday afternoon
(All I could do was cry)
But I made a promise
That you treasure
And I made it back to you

How I've waited for this moment
To be by your side
Your best friend wrote and told me
You had tear drops in you eyes
Daddy's home- Daddy's Home-To stay
I'm not a thousand miles away
