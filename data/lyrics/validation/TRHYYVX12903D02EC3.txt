It's simple, so easy
Somethin' 'bout your gentle way that frees me
I feel it, all I can do is love you

This one thing I'm sure of
Nothin' sweeter in this world than your love
I'm certain all I can do is love you

All of my dreams are yours
Those distant shores of love at last have found me
Best way I can explain is there's hope again
And you're the light surrounding me

My lifetime I'll prove it
'Cause baby when it gets right down to it
I can't help it all I can do is love you

Like warm sun in winter
All I expected was this sweet surrender
I now know all I can do is love you
Forever, all I can do is love you
