Well, everybody tries
To keep themselves alive
You were younger yesterday
I'm feeling not so great

Well, everybody cries
I think I'm beginning to find
I was younger yesterday
And I'm feeling not so great

We're laying down in there
The days go by in my head
Yeah, faking if I can't sleep
And then together we can get some relief

And now you know you're beautiful
You'd always wonder
Now you know everything's alright

And now you know you're beautiful
You'd always wonder
Now you know together we're alright

We're marching left to right
I think it's little bit aside
Yeah, I've always felt like this
And I think it's got a lot to do with the sound

Of everybody's sighs
I think we can create a line
But we are standing and are straight
'Cause together we can make it great

And now we know we're beautiful
We've always wondered
Now we know together we're alright

And now we know we're beautiful
We've always wondered
Now we know with everyday
Everyday is a fight

You will make it right
You were misunderstood
The world wants

You too make it right
We were misunderstood
The world wants love

Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
