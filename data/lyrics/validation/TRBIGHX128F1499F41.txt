[Verse 1]
I can see you in each of drop rain
As it falls all through the night
Haunting memories keep me awake
Its been so long since I held you tight

I thought that I had you out of my heart
But I dont, no
I imagine you here with me
But I guess its gonna be

[Chorus]
Just another lonely night
And Im thinking about you
(Just another lonely night)
Oh, just another lonely night
Wanting your love

[Verse 2]
What can I do in times like this
When its you I miss so much
In the darkness, your voice I hear
Calling me from deep, deep, deep inside (Johnny)

How can I get you out of my mind?
Nobody elses touch can make it right
So I try to forget about you
Looks like thats something I just cant do

[Chorus]
Just another lonely night
Thinking about you
(Just another lonely night)
Oh, just another lonely night
(Just another lonely night)

[Bridge]
I need you to be here with me
But I guess its gonna be

[Chorus]
Just another lonely night
And Im thinking about you
(Just another lonely night)
And its just another lonely night
Wanting your love

Oh, its just another lonely night
And I cant live without you
(Just another lonely night)
Just another lonely night
Wanting your love

Oh, its just another lonely night
(Just another lonely night)
And its just another lonely night
