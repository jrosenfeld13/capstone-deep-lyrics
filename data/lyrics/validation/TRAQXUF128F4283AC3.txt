Motorcycle and me
Motorcycle set me free
My motorbike don't go too fast
Just sets me free

Motorcycle and me, and me
Motorcycle set me free, set me free
My motorbike don't go too fast

Just sets me free, just you and me
Just sets me free, just you and me
Just set me high, high, high, high
High, high, high

I feel warm inside on my motorcycle
The wind is all around, we are free

Me and my motorcycle
We, we are free
You set me high, high, high, high
You set me high

You and me, just set me free
You and me, set me free

Just you and me, set me free
Just you and me, set me free
You and me, set me free
You and me, set me free, you and me
