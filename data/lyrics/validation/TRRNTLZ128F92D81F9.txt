I won't run away
I won't leave tomorrow
But if you care, if you worry
I won't run away
I won't leave tomorrow
But if you care, if you worry
I'll be home when it's dark outside

You don't need to be scared
I won't run away tonight
But if you care, if you worry
I'll stay home till the morninglight

Your scared, it's my fault
'cos i didn't come home last night
My hands were so cold
I stayed out till the morninglight
I didn't come home

And if you knew that i'm sorry
Would you let me get out of here?
Don't bother, don't worry
I'll be home when it's morninglight

Your scared, it's my fault
'cos i didn't come home last night
My hands were so cold
I stayed out till the morninglight
I didn't come home
