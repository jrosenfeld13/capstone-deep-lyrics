People say I'm crazy and they say that I'm insane
But everything was lost and I had everything to gain
And it all became a song, the one I waited for
So long, just to play
Something in the air that makes the feeling so complete
I'm living as a warrior that can never know defeat
And the battle rages on
'Til the brightness of the sun is gone, gone away

Look on high, to the hill
To the place where time stood still
Then you'll see there's no returning
From a heart where love is burning
How can men hope to hide
Blinded by their pride

A day is like a thousand years, and a
Thousand like a day
You're questioning the reason and you're
Hoping for delay
But it always comes out right
And it's coming like a thief at night
Steal away

Look on high, to the hill
To the place where time stood still
Then you'll see there's no returning
From a heart where love is burning
How can men hope to hide
Blinded by their pride

On the dark horizon rose the light of a different day
Spreading over all the world to show the living way
And it makes it all so clear
If you open up your ears and hear, now I say

Look on high, to the hill
To the place where time stood still
Then you'll see there's no returning
From a heart where love is burning
How can men hope to hide
Blinded by their pride
