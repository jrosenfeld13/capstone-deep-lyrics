Yeeh ha

I ain't lying when I tell you I've been riding everyday
It's the greatest sensation it just makes me wanna play
The way I move when I'm on top makes me hope that it won't stop
Cause I'm a cowgirl soul and mind I won't leave no horse behind
And baby that is why yeeh ha

I've been riding all night I'm a country girl
Fits the saddle just right yeeh ha
There just ain't no cowboy I'm a country girl
Who can't be my boy toy yeeh ha

Showgirl cowgirl you can call me anything

I'll be your pearl every night
If you touch me I will open and inside is pure delight
You think that I'm a no mans land but if you do just understand
Cause I'm a cowgirl soul and mind I won't leave no horse behind
And baby that is why Yeeh ha

I've been riding all night I'm a country girl
Fits the saddle just right yeeh ha
There just ain't no cowboy I'm a country girl
Who can't be my boy toy yeeh ha

I shot the sheriff yeah i shot him down
Blew him away when i got to his town
Down shot him down flat on the ground
His gun was smokin' the kind a girl could choke in
But way to eager to pull his trigger
A faster shooter than Lucky Luke ahh
So i went out to find the kid
Cause one thing 'bout Billy he's the shit
Go Billy it's your birthday we gon' party yeeh ha

I've been riding all night I'm a country girl
Fits the saddle just right yeeh ha
There just ain't no cowboy I'm a country girl
Who can't be my boy toy yeeh ha
