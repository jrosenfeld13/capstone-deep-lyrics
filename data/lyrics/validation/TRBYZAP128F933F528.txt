I ran away with myself
I think I ran a little too far
Your love is more than a tease
And I'm gonna give it all of my heart

Situations is all wrapped up
And no more needs to be said, oh no

You live in my world gotta heed me
And I know that you can cause you need me
There ain't nothin' gonna stop us now
We're willing and we both know how

And baby you're gonna be my queen
Cause the king always know just what he means
Well, alright

The future looks only a sea
Of the troubled times ahead for you and me
And the desert oasis just sand
For the kingdom and all of my plans
On no, said all will fall, yeah
