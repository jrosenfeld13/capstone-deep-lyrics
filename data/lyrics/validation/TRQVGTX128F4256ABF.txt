Fight fire with fire and everything will burn
An eye for an eye will make the whole world blind
I won't go out to find wars
I'm going inside to find peace
I'd rather die for something
Than live for nothing

Not he who controls others
But he who controls himself
It takes more strength
To put down the guard
Than it takes to hate
And try looking hard
