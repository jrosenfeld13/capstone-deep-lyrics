I have been hiding, contemplating
Oh denying feelings I have inside when you are near me
Something within me makes me feel so out of place

I am running away, running away, running away
Running away from you
It is true
I am taking my space, taking my space, taking my space
Taking my distance from you
It is true

It was love in the first place, must admit you really blew me away
All the music inside of me, got me feeling some kind of madness
It was love, it was love, it was love
