[Verse 1]
She wants to get out of the car in the middle of the road
And her screaming and hollering is getting mighty old
She checks every paper when you step out the room

[Chorus]
Ain't got no trust in your mama
Ain't got no trust in your daddy
Ain't got no trust in your sister
And she ain't got trust in you

[Verse 2]
She want a simple life, she need a simple man
That don't drink or smoke darling, play in a rock and roll band
Oh, but she want you to hold her at night when she lonely and blue

[Chorus]
Ain't got no trust in your mama
Ain't got no trust in your daddy
Ain't got no trust in your sister
And she ain't got trust in you

[Verse 3]
Yeah she's a beautiful gal and when she wanna be
But if you told her so darling, she'd just disagree
Oh, she hate your job and what you want him to do

[Chorus]
Ain't got no trust in your mama
Ain't got no trust in your daddy
Ain't got no trust in your sister
And she ain't got trust in you
