You picked me up when I was down with nothing
And gave me something , I can't face the world without
You showed me just enough to fuel my fire
My desire, never wanna live without it

Both of us need something like we had before
We can't keep fighting like this anymore
This love affair is breaking my heart

All the pushing and the shoving
When we know that we ought to be loving
And the lying and the cheating
When we ought to be loving and squeezing
Come on come on
Lay down your guns and surrender

Remember days we thought would last forever
Nothing better but we let them slip away
Cause in the end we make the bed we lie in
Lets start trying
What's the point of talking about it

Never seems to make it better
If we can't get on together
Take a chance and try a brand new start

All the pushing and the shoving
When we know that we ought to be loving
And the lying and the cheating
When we ought to be loving and squeezing
Come on come on
Lay down your guns and surrender
