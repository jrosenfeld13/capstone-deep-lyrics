One day an angel told me, "your time here is fleeting"
Behind his back - a pistol - here comes a beating
His suit, his silk, flower / but my razor is faster
"hey Carlos, you been drinkin' Florida water"

Looking for a new technique
They never believe I put my weapons down
Another page turns in the book
Another one falls on their knees to the ground

A message from the tiger & she shivered like chord on a harp:
"the bedroom must be returned to its original sailor"
She reached for the lipstick from her handbag
On the edge of the sink
& the sad loves surrounded the lade of perpetual squalor
