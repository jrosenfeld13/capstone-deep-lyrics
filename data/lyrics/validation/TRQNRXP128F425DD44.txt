Where do monsters go
When they're not on the film set
I wanna know if they ever sleep
Or do they wonder the night

Do they have a home
Just like you and me
Or are they homeless
Living in the street
Do they have bills to pay
Or watch T.V
Where do they buy their groceries
I wonder what they eat

Alive on the silver screen and in my head
The restless unded
Where do they go...
I wanna know...

Where do monsters go
When they're not on the film set
I wanna know if they ever sleep
Or do they wander the night

Do they have kids
Friends and Family
Are they still looking scary
Or wearing a disguise
Do they have abank account
Do they even pee
Do tears ever fall
From a monsters eyes

Alive on the silver screen and in my head
At night under my bed...
Where do they go...
I wanna know...

Where do monsters go
When they're not on the film set
I wanna know if they ever sleep
Or do they wander the night
