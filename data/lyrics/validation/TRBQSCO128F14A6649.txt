I'll follow you
Through the people to
The train station
You're one in a million you're blue
I'll take a lesson from you
Be taught what not to do
In situations where the animal's in me

I'll stop dreaming
Start living through
The lives of my children and you
My ego's dying
To hold onto
The better part
That lived here before and I'm
Getting older
Moving further from
The heart of the sun
What have I done

Locked out of life
Stripped of my stripes
Even be banned from the Smile Party
I can't commit myself
To waking up I'm
Posessed by arseholes
They channel through me and rule

Frank's the greatest
At 55 he's dead
I play his songs
To keep him alive in my head
He'll watch over
A budding failure
Bad luck maker
Walking out of step with sense

Superhero songwriters
Fixing to change the world from our rooms
Maybe I should stick to writing wills
'Cause I'm no good at finding ways
Superhero songwriter
Super-clich
Chorus finder
I can feel a blue moon coming my way
Any day
