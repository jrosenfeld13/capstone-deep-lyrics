You oughta see my baby when she walk down the street
Upsettin' everybody she meet
She's twenty-three in the waist, thirty-eight in the hips
She got long black wavy hair and ruby-red lips

Oh she's tuff
Oooo, she's tuff
My baby's tuff, she ruff and tuff
And that's tuff enuff

She walk past a clock, the clock won't tell time
She walk through the college, professor lose his mind

Cause she's tuff
Oooo, she's tuff
My baby's tuff, she ruff and tuff
And that's tuff enuff

The president said to my baby, come here, sweetheart
You can stop a world war even before it start
We know the enemy won't pull the trigger
When they walk out on the front line and they see your fine figure

Cause you tuff
Oooo, she's tuff
My baby's tuff, she ruff and tuff
And that's tuff enuff

And that's tuff enuff
And that's tuff enuff
And that's tuff enuff
