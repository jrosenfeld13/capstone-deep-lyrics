Sometimes, sometimes

Sometimes I feel like Im playing on the radio
Sometimes I feel like Im on a travelling road show
Sometimes I got the power of the will
And I know my song is going to be all right

Sometimes I feel like Im on a freight train
Forever rescued by the mystery rain
Sometimes Im just out for a thrill
She always said, baby, you're going to be all right

The sun going to come shining down
Push it all away, make it all right
Sometimes in the heart of a long, cold night
It's all too far out of sight, out of sight

Hard to know everything's going to be all right
Everyone thinks you got everything you want
Hard to have and then have not
Hard to have and then have not

Sometimes I want to take a pill and hide
Sometimes I want to shut down and ride
And go where no man should go
Go where no man should go
Go where no man should go
Go where no man should go
Could it be, ever really be all right?
