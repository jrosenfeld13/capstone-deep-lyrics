I wanna make that very clear
I love the handicapped
I love the chicks with no more limbs
Whellchair trapped
I love those stumps and I love those stubs
They totally turn me on
I wanna fuck those lovely amps
Heckles Acrotomophilia Don

You better take it off
That artifical limb
And sing with me this song
It's the amp hymn

Some men love animals
Others prefer human brats
But I do like the crippled ones
Much more than dogs and cats
When I see a handicapped
I almost wanna cum
Taking off their prosthesis
And fuck'em in their bum

Upper and lower extremity
Take'em off for your Doctor Amputee

Love that babe, beautiful hair
No arms no legs, make love in the wheelchair

Oh, how I love the sound of your
Stubs when they stamp the ground
Oh, your stumps turn me on
And make me cum

You better take it off
That artifical limb
And sing with me this song
The amp hymn
You better take both off
I love your crippled stumps
Acrotomophiliac
