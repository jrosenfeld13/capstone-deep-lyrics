Love is...
Then it hurts...
Sometimes it's hard to tell the truth
Then it hurts, but nothing lasts forever
Love is such a fragile thing
And I know, you better never say never
Confused about what's real what's right or wrong
Emotions last forever
You and me are too blind to see what we feel
Oh baby never say never
Love is such a fragile thing
And I know, emotions last forever
Love is such a fragile thing
And I know, you better never say never
Love is such a fragile thing
And I know, emotions last forever
Love is such a fragile thing
And I know, you better never say never
Love is such a fragile thing
And it hurts, emotions last forever
Love is such a fragile thing
And it hurts, you better never say never
