After the fire, their bodies at rest
Beyond mere blood, beyond mere breath
Their terror summons the vapours of fright
A mating call to things of the night

The things they'll become after they die
Have called to us before their time
The dark horse of dreams has brought them here
To this Ur-Place that feeds on fear
Where the only light comes from their bones
That glow, now all their flesh is gone

(A) Voice between rivers
Sings (the) truth that destroys
Then it laughs like a dog

(The) Voice between worlds
Has existence to void
And it dwells in their bones

"That which was drawn in sand for me
By the man of blood
Whose hand never ends
Heralds all mortality
And he-who-waits-beneath-the-scream"

Oh, to be possessed of carrionshine
To dream past the limits of carcasskind

The prayer goes:
"Unite to thee thy bones - What appertains to thee is complete"
