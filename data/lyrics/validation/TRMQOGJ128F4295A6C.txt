By the time the buzz was wearing off
We were standing out on the sidewalk
With our tattoos that looked like rings
In the hot Nevada sun

Gifts piled high
And our moms and dads shook hands
And our party of polaroid friends
Rented a pool and hired a band

Maybe they knew more than we knew
'Cause they danced and drank
While we jumped off the deep end

Oh, I've got you to thank for this

Christmas came around
Yeah, and everything was going to crap
For moms and dads, not a clue to be had
Yeah, we put on a pretty good act

And they seemed to all need to believe it
So we danced and smiled
And paddled hard beneath it

Oh, I've got you to thank for this

You can't say
You've never had a doubt
And smoked it down
But really wanted out

Oh, God damn!

By the time the buzz was wearing off
We were standing out on the sidewalk
With our tattoos that looked like rings
In the hot Nevada sun
And they won't fade

I've got you to thank
