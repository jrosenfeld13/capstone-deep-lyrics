It's like a dream come true
Theorise
Come Alive
Through and through
It just goes to show
Take a chance
If you're ready
Let everything flow
Each and every one of us
Can talk in circles
Yeah each and every one of us
Will walk in circles
It's all you'll ever need

Chorus 1:
Why do we idolize it
(It's all you'll ever need)
If you can't justify it?
(It's all you'll ever need)
I'm bedazzled
By the answers that unravelled
That were fantasized
There's no single disposition
On the planet
Just the colours that collide
Yeah each and every one of us
Can talk in circles
Yeah each and every one of us
Will walk in circles
It's all you'll ever need

Chorus 1:
Why do we idolize it
If you can't justify it?
Why do we idolize it
If you can't justify it?
Get ready to go
Come on let's pick up speed
It's all in the mind
It's all you ever need
It's all you ever need
