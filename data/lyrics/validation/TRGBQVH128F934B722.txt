A divided soul in pain
Scarred for life, forever damned
Haunted by demons --
A lifetime as prey
40 Years of nightmares and unable to scream
Searching for a way to slay without disgrace
Now I know the answer:
Holy Murder Masquerade
Now I know the answer:
Schizophrenic getaway
Bitter sweet solution
No more of hell's illusions
Now I know the answer!
On a quest for vengeance
To find an end
And now the time is here
To rip the holy face
Now I know the answer:
Holy Murder Masquerade
Now I know the answer:
Schizophrenic getaway
Bitter sweet solution
No more of hell's illusions
Now I know the answer!
Wearing a mask of flesh
Stripped, skinned from Jesus' face
Fighting inner demons
To overcome a fear to kill
Now I know the answer:
Holy Murder Masquerade
Now I know the answer:
Schizophrenic getaway
Bitter sweet solution
No more of hell's illusions
Now I know the answer!
(What a dream...A vision so clear. Now I know...Now I know the answer!)
