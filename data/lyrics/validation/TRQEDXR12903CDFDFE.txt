I never won for losing
But it ceased to be amusing when you told me
That ev'ry night you're shining bright
And the big apple band a callin' out your name
And what do you mean the Rolling Stones ain't nothing to you
'Cause they ain't got the beat right
I'm trying to tell you something
But you're gonna jump around crazy half the night

Ev'rybody be dancing, dancing
Dancing half the night away
Ev'rybody be dancing
Dancing half the night away

Say you like to have a good time
But you don't want to go no place cold and old
You're heading for the neon light
To join the crowd shaking from door to door
You get me in such a heat
You know I'm gonna catch that beat if it kills me
But don't you think it's a crying shame
That they don't dance like Carmen here no more

Ev'rybody be dancing, dancing
Dancing half the night away
Ev'rybody be dancing
Dancing half the night away
