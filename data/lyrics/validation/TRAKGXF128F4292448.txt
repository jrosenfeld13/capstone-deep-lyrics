[Verse 1]
I guess I lost my head last night
Kept on until I made you cry
Walked out with my stubborn pride
Wasn't nothing you could do to stop me
I hit the road but I didn't get far
Just drove around all night in my car
Now I'm not sure where to start
To tell you that I'm sorry

[Chorus]
I just want to hold you
I don't want to hurt you
I don't want to leave
I just want to be with you
And after living alone, lost for so long
Finally found the love of my life
Why would I say goodbye

[Verse 2]
I don't know what is is about the edge of a cliff
Makes we want to get so close to it
I guess this time I finally slipped
What a foolish way to end it
Maybe that's why I'm back here now
Got both feet back on the ground
Hoping you won't turn me down
When I ask you for forgiveness

[Chorus]
