Give me your gold
Gold, gold
Gold, gold
Gold, gold
Gold
Blue moon is walking
These lips are smoking
Big time disaster
My heart gets faster
My pot is melting
Doctors consulting
Destiny
Give it to me
This is your show
And it's old and it's a wonder
This day I give it to you
Give it to you
Give me your gold
Give me your gold
You got a nugget in your pocket
Got a nugget in your hand
You got a nugget in your pocket
Got a nugget for a grand
So forget your hesitation
Take a dozen invitation
Like it's for a great confusion
Like it's for a grand illusion
Clouds, love, stars, colors
Goldrush
Goldrush, rush
You got a nugget in your pocket
Got a nugget in your hand
You got a nugget in your pocket
Got a nugget for a grand
So forget your hesitation
Take a dozen invitation
Like it's for a great confusion
Like it's for a grand illusion
Clouds, love, stars, colors
Gold
Take it into the night
Gold
