All we do is waste our time, at least if you ask our neighbours
You never see we in a factory line, or sitting and pushing paper

Yeah, we do the ska, yeah we ska, yeah we ska
We do the ska, yeah we ska, yeah we ska
We do the ska, yeah we ska, yeah we ska
And ska is all we need

Headed for the big, big time, ready to face our vultures
Signing on the dotted line, designing to raise our culture

Yeah, we do the ska, yeah we ska, yeah we ska
We do the ska, yeah we ska, yeah we ska
We do the ska, yeah we ska, yeah we ska
And ska is all we need

The deeper the water, the cooler the stream
The thicker the lumber, the stronger the beam
Now rudie come lately all over the scene
Trading the black and white for green
Yeah, because he don't know what it means
Yeah, we ska

We do the ska, yeah we ska, yeah we ska
We do the ska, yeah we ska, yeah we ska
We do the ska, yeah we ska, yeah we ska
And ska is all we need

No voice from the tower can tell me what's real
You bring your own honour, so honour the real deal

Yes they would take you to the moon
If you would only change your tune
Waving the mighty dollar sign
They bait and hook their bottom line
But now we say goodbye to greed
Because life is sewing seed
So red stripe and collie weed, yeah
And ska is all we need. Yeah, we ska

We do the ska, yeah we ska, yeah we ska
We do the ska, yeah we ska, yeah we ska
We do the ska, yeah we ska, yeah we ska
And ska is all we need. Yeah, we ska

We do the ska, yeah we ska, yeah we ska
We do the ska, yeah we ska, yeah we ska
We do the ska, yeah we ska, yeah we ska
And ska is all we need
