You take me to paradise
And I feel as though I'm goin
Out of my mind, can't you see
Every time I'm with you I feel weak
Even though we're in a dream, oh I
Can't last a day without
Your touch, your kiss
Gently caressing my body
My body is only for you
Distant love, wish I
Knew how I met you
I know I shouldn't waste
Time wonderin
Is it you who yearns when
I touch your skin
So gentle, so gentle, I can feel you
Tell me
Tell me this is no lie
I see you in the reflection
Of my eyes
If your not here, please
Tell me where

Chorus

I know that you're out there
(I can feel that you are close
By your here somewhere)
I've been waitin so long for you
(Is life a dream, are things
Really what they seem)
When I close my eyes you're here
(Yo, I wanna hold you if only I could show you)
Dreamings not like reality
(Cause you're my destiny
Girl you know)
Need you too

Is this a curse or am I blessed
I think I'm going mad
Up in this cold world
Without my girl
I visualize her daily because I am feeling incomplete without my lady
I see things like her image
Lurking in the mirror
I'm fantasizing, wishing she were right beside me

But realising I am
Dreaming its an illusion
So much confusion
I'm crazy about this lady
You haunt me, I have never met
You but I can swear to god in my dreams I smell and touch you
I long for you wanna hold
You when I am lonely
Cause in my heart you're
The only one who knows me
If only I could manifest
Your very being I could show
You a part of me
No girl has ever seen
Believe me you're the only
One in this whole world for me
I know your out there so
Baby girl just wait for me

Chorus

I know that you're out there
(I can feel that you are close
By your here somewhere)
I've been waitin so long for you
(Is life a dream, are things
Really what they seem)
When I close my eyes you're here
(Yo, I wanna hold you if only I could show you)
Dreamings not like reality
(Cause you're my destiny
Girl you know )
Need you too

Bridge

How will I know its you
So many faces in the world
(Which on belong to you)
Would you pass me by
(If I don't say hi)
Please leave a clue
(I'll come find you and make
Our dreams come true)
I won't hesitate nor wonder
But please don't make
We wait no longer
(If I had my way you'd be
Here with me, I know its destiny, coz we we're meant to be)
Chorus
I know that you're out there
(I can feel that you are close
By your here somewhere)
I've been waitin so long for you
(Is like a dream are things
Really what you seem)
When I close my eyes you're here
(Yo, I wanna hold you if only
I could show you)
Dreamings not like reality
(Cause you're my destiny
Girl you know )
I Need you too x2
