[Verse 1]
The color of infinity inside an empty glass
I'm squinting my eye and turning off
And on and on and off the light

It's for this experimental film
Which nobody knows about and which
I'm still figuring out what's going to go
In my experimental film

[Chorus]
Yeah!
You're all gonna be in this experimental film
And even though I can't explain it
I already know how great it is

[Verse 2]
I already know the ending
It's the part that makes your face implode
I don't know what makes your face implode
But that's the way the movie ends

And in my experimental film
Which nobody knows about but which
I'm still figuring out
Whose face implodes
In my experimental film

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The color of infinity
Inside an empty glass
It's for this experimental film
Which nobody knows about and which
I'm still figuring out what's going to go
In my experimental film

[Chorus]
