I would hold your hand
For hours on end
Still I find bizarre
My serene content

Perfectly still

You were my exceptional affair
Longing for perpetuating summers
Just a boy frozen stiff
You just left me shivering alone
Your scent of perfection in the air
A simple girl [in a shroud of myth(?)]
A debutante so fair

I would watch you bend
As you checked what said
The clock upon the wall
While gripping your rosette

Perfectly still

You were my exceptional affair
Longing for perpetuating summers
Just a boy frozen stiff
You just left me shivering alone
Your scent of perfection in the air
A simple girl [in a shroud of myth(?)]
A debutante so fair

You were my exceptional affair
Longing for perpetuating summers
Just a boy frozen stiff
You just left me shivering alone
Your scent of perfection in the air
A simple girl [in a shroud of myth(?)]
It was quite a mystifying evening
Satisfied by your audience alone
A vicious boy, a modest girl
Surely an ineffable assembly
Of two souls completely unaware
Both consumed in ectacy
While passion each ensnared
