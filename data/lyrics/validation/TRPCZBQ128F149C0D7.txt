We've got nothing but that's alright
Nothing could be something if the feeling's right
Holding onto something doesn't make it mine
Got to get to heaven but we don't have time

So come on
So come on
So come on
Yeah baby, come on

Bright light city set my soul on fire
Couldn't get me worried, couldn't get me higher
Scream for me baby 'cause I'm going down
Got to get to heaven when the sun goes down

So come on
So come on
So come on
Yeah baby, come on

Don't need religion, we can work it out
Don't need estimation what the world's all about
Don't need money to feel alright
You don't need nothing but me tonight

So come on
So come on
So come on
Yeah baby, come on

So come on
So come on
So come on
Yeah baby, come on

Yeah baby, come on
Yeah baby, come on
Yeah baby, come on
So come on

Yeah baby, come on
Yeah baby, come on
So come on
