I'm sitting here drinkin' in the last bar on earth
Sittin' here drinkin in the last bar on earth...
Out in California she's takin' off her tight red skirt

The mountains out the window - they're a woman lyin' on a bed
The mountains here are shaped like a woman lying naked on a bed
She may be out in California, but I can't get her out of my head

Out in California...

They killed off the Indians, they shot all the grizzly bears
Out in California, they shot all the grizzly bears
She just stands by the window, combing out her long black hair

If a man keeps runnin', he'll run right into himself
It a man keeps movin', he'll run into himself
Out in California she's lyin down with somebody else

Out in California...

Gonna buy me a Chevy, as soon as my luck turns around
Gonna buy me a shotgun, soon as my luck turns around
Gonna drive on back to that California town

I'm sitting here drinkin' in the last bar on earth
Sittin' here drinkin in the last bar on earth...
Out in California she's takin' off her tight red skirt
