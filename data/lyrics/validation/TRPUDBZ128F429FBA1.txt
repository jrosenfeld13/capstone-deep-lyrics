Rainin' on the ocean
Stormin' on the sea
Rainin' on the ocean
And it's stormin' on the sea
Blues in that shower
Is showering down on me

Come back, baby
Won't be bad, no more
Come back baby, woo-ooo
Won't be bad no more
I'll sing on my knees
An I'll follow anywhere you go

(piano and guitar)

Mean ol' fireman, good old engineer
Mean old fireman, woo-ooo, good old engineer
They took my baby 'way
And left me standin' here
