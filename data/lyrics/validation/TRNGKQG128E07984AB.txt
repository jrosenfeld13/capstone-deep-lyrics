Can't we two go walkin' together, out beyond the valley of trees?
Out where there's a hillside of heather, curtsyin' gently in the breeze
That's what I'd like to do, see the heather, but with you
The mist of May is in the gloamin', and all the clouds are holdin' still

So take my hand and let's go roamin' through the heather on the hill
The mornin' dew is blinkin' yonder, there's lazy music in the rill
And all I want to do is wander through the heather on the hill
There may be other days as rich and rare

There may be other springs as full and fair
But they won't be the same, they'll come and go, for this I know
That when the mist is in the gloamin', and all the clouds are holdin' still
If you're not there I won't go roamin' through the heather on the hill
The heather on the hill
