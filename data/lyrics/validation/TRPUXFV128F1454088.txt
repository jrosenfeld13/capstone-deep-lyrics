Bacon Brothers, The
Can't Complain
She Is The Heart

"it was fun writing a song for piano, but writing it on a guitar. since i can't play piano, it was a thrill to hear irwin bang it out for the first time." kb

She says she's from the city
But he knows that's not true
'cause she came down on angel wings
Out of the blue
She brings him things that he can't buy
Like light and wind, and rain
She brings a child
And he is born again

He is lost, she is the way
He is darkness, she's the break of day
When he's lying there, dying there
And his world's been blown apart
She is life, she is the heart

She's a botticelli
A breathing masterpiece
She can lift him up on high
Or bring him to his knees
When he's falling through the clouds
Just falling to the ground
Her arms are like a parachute
And together they go down
They go down

He is lost, she is the way
He is darkness, she's the break of day
When he's lying there, dying there
And his world's been blown apart
She is life, she is the heart
