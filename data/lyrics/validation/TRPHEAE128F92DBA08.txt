Youre lying to yourself if you say you dont like the games
Cause I noticed all the smiles that youve been sneaking
And Im analyzing simple things
I guess Im just afraid
But my friends all say Im really over-thinking

[Chorus]
Cause everything I know has gone out the window
And Ill re-learn how to cope, through one more song of hope

If this is how its gonna go, I tell you what
Ill let you know when I get back, cause as for now Im leaving
Another day, another night, another chance to make this right
I cant believe youve got me still believing

[Chorus]

And you know how I feel cause its all on my sleeve
But Im not gonna beg
If you leave, then you leave
But its killing me silently, sitting here
Swear that its over
Its over
