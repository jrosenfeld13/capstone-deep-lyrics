Hold me closer so I can't breathe
Tell me a story I don't know I believe
You stole this heart right out of me

And when you steal a heart that's true
Be sure you know just what you do
Mind can't be relied upon to forgive, forget it

Squeeze me nearer, sweep me off my feet
Whisper me secrets I don't know I can keep
You stole this heart right out of me

And when you steal a heart that's true
Be certain that you want it too
Mind can't be relied upon to forgive, forget it
