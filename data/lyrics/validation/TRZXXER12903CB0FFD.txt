Little girl - do you know what you are (do you know)
This baby's gonna be a STAR - do you know-wow
A Teenangel-Empress from Hollywood highs
(With wonderful eyes)
You're beautiful - put on your strato-blue suit -
(Put it on)
I know that you're in the mood to fly
And you get the power to make it come true -
The most exciting news

We'll be together 'til the end of time
And when you S.M.I.L.E., Red Rose
It's just like Blue Sunshine, Blue Sunshine
Oh, we're ascending and we'll never die
'Cause when we kiss, Red Rose
We're changing 6 to 9
It's Revolution Time
When 6 turns into 9

Move over - closer to my phantasies (pretty baby)
We're standing at the turn of the centuries
The daughter of time is groovin' Tonight - Tonight - Tonight
Tonight, little dreamer, you're the DJ of your soul (little dreamer)
C'mon let's swing to that Rock and Roll
The sweetest arrows of desire
Will set this night on fire

We'll be together 'til the end of time
And when you S.M.I.L.E., Red Rose
It's just like Blue Sunshine, Blue Sunshine
Oh, we're ascending and we'll never die
'Cause when we kiss, Red Rose
We're changing 6 to 9
It's Revolution Time
When 6 turns into 9

(Change, change 6 to 9)
(Change, change 6 to 9)
(Change, change 6 to 9)
(Change, change 6 to 9)

Above the City of the million Moons
We'll reach the Palace of the Sun
DO WHAT YOU WILL - shall be your destiny
We will unfold the secrets of the new JERUSALEM

We'll be together 'til the end of time
And when you S.M.I.L.E., Red Rose
It's just like Blue Sunshine, Blue Sunshine
Oh, we're ascending and we'll never die
'Cause when we kiss, Red Rose
We're changing 6 to 9
It's Revolution Time
When 6 turns into 9
