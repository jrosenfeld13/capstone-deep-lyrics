[Verse 1]
A little country church on a two lane road
A bride and groom coming out the door
White lace dress and a red bouquet
Just married written on a blue Chevrolet

[Chorus]
Don't that make you want to fall in love
Don't that look like a picture of us
A match made in heaven if there ever was
Don't that make you want to fall
That just makes me want to give you my heart
Ever forever needs a place to start
Gotta be a sign from up above
Don't that make you want to fall in love

[Verse 2]
Old folks sitting in a front porch swing
Still holding' hands like they were sixteen
Fifty good years they're a lover's dream
Darling' that could be you and me

[Chorus]
Don't that make you want to fall in love
Don't that look like a picture of us
A match made in heaven if there ever was
Don't that make you want to fall
That just makes me want to give you my heart
Ever forever needs a place to start
Gotta be a sign from up above
Don't that make you want to fall in love
Yeah, yeah
Don't that make you want to fall in love
