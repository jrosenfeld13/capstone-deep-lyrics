[Verse 1]
15th heir to the ball and chain
House full of hungry kids to his name
Everything to lose and nothing to gain
Long reign Alfred the Great
Touched his toes down the company store
Scrubbed till he see his face in the floor
Lost his place to a foot in the door
Long reign Alfred the Great

[Chorus]
He's never been too good with words oh no
Said you don't need a Doctor
You don't need a Doctor to show
It's a hard, hard road
When your folks ain't cracked the code
And your tears don't put
Food on the plate
Alfred the Great
Watch out!

[Verse 2]
Ever get the feeling you been stitched up?
Textbook case of bad, bad luck
There's a hole in your bucket and cracks in your cup
Long reign Alfred the Great
Touched his toes down the company store
Scrubbed till he see his face in the floor
He ain't gonna dance for the suits no more
Long reign Alfred the Great

[Chorus]
He's never been too good with words oh no
Said you don't need a Doctor
You don't need a Doctor to show
It's a hard, hard road
When your folks ain't cracked the code
And your tears don't put
Food on the plate
Alfred the Great
Watch out!

It's a hard, hard road
When your folks ain't cracked the code
And your tears don't put
Food on the plate
And the rent won't wait, oh no

It's a hard, hard road
When your folks ain't cracked the code
And your tears don't put
Food on the plate
Alfred the Great
Watch out!
Food on the plate
Alfred the Great
Watch out!
