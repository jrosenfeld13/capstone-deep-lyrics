I was born in a trunk
Mama died and my daddy got drunk
Let me hear two dying crows
In the middle of tobacco road
Grew up in a rusty shack
All I owned was hanging on my back
Only lord knows how I loved tobacco road
But it's hard, hard the only life I've ever known
But the lord knows how I loved
Tobacco road
Gonna leave, get a job
With the help of the tree some God
Save my money, get rich enough
Bring it back to tobacco road
Bring dynamite and a crane
Blow it up and start all over again
Build a town be proud to show
Give the name tobacco road
'Cause it's hard, hard the only life I've ever known
I despise you 'cause you're filthy
But I love you 'cause you're home
Bring dynamite and a crane
Blow it up start all over again
Build a town be proud to know
This place called tobacco road
'Cause it's hard, hard the only life I've ever known
But the lord knows how I love
Tobacco road
