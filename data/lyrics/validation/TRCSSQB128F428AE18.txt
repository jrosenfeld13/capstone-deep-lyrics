I try to write every line with perfection
Scarred to constantly remember the violence
The wounds that you put me through
It never meant the pain to you

Weak one shall continue as weak one
And when it hurts it won't be the last time
Clouded thoughts make it harder to fly
Your pornographic dream is a lie

This pretty face
This pretty face
This pretty face

Suppose I could oppose the role that you set for me
The object you tried to make of me
But this time I will just close my eyes
Bite my lip and and not try to cry

Point that gun at your own head
Kill this male ego dead
Constantly fueled, constantly fed
Watch this beautiful skin turn red

This pretty face
This pretty face
This pretty face
This pretty face
(Destroy)
This pretty face
(Destroy)
This pretty face
(Destroy)
This pretty face
(Destroy)

Your constant abuse
Constant comments
Constant date rapes
Constant drive
