Have your nails scratched the deepest?
Have you broken skin this time?
Made your mark and took me deeper
As you drown me with your eyes
I held my hand over your mouth
As you scream at me to feel
You felt my scars with understanding
But I can't promise anything

Can you tell
That I picked my poison well
That I have no more to sell to you
Is it really that important that I settle down?
Does it really even matter that I have my doubts?
I search for the one who bleeds
I reach for the one who bleeds

I forget to dream in color
I am better off alone
Honest hearts are undercover
We are shadows on our own
Lose ourselves in open waters
Always swimming back to shore
My addictions have no boundaries
Now I'm crying out for more

Can you tell
That I picked my poison well
That I have no more to sell to you
Is it really that important that I settle down
Does it really even matter that I have my doubts
I search for the one who bleeds
I reach for the one who bleeds
Like me

I have my doubts
I have my doubts
And so does everybody else
So help me take this all away
You gotta help me take this all away
Please help me take this all away
And bleed like me
So help me take this all away
You gotta help me take this all away
Please help me take this all away
And bleed like me

Is it really that important that I settle down?
Does it really even matter that I have my doubts?
I search for the one who bleeds
I reach for the one who bleeds

I reach for
I reach for
I reach for
I reach for
I reach for the one who bleeds
Like me
