What would be if the life we live
Is just the first stage
...existence what it might being
...a new phase
Imagine death, oh it's just a gauge
Of new dimension
Urgency workin' out of passion
Rules that lose their place
What would be if the dreams we have
Are just the first step
To new life form in which we fade
Right after death
So now go ask yourself
Why the hell are we scared to die
Listen to my advice
Life's too short to think about goodbyes
Kick over your traces
Enjoy life's horrible faces
No more fear of the end
Just stop to pretend
See the positive side
Throw away all your pride
Kick over your traces
Enjoy life's horrible faces
What would be if the way we feel
Is just a first bite
Of the slippery gauntlet of unknown fears
Across the eternal night
Forget your happy life
Cause it's your lucky night
Forget your happy life
Cause it's your lucky night
Don't put your heart in confusion
Be no more, no more illusion
