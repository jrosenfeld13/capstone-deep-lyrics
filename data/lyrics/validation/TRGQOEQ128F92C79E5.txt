Believe me
I'm not afraid
Teach me
To learn your ways
Carry me
Under your wings
In your perfect time

Only you
Can make me shine
Only you
Can days be right
In your perfect time

I know You told me that I'm not alone
You know I couldn't do it on my own
See my eyes are older now
Broken dreams behind
Fill my heart with precious love
I know it's there to find

Believe me
I'm not afraid
Teach me
To learn your ways
Carry me
Under your wings
In your perfect time

Only you
Can make me shine
Only you
Can days be right
In your perfect time

Precious love
You gave me
Precious love
I know forgiveness is the key not pride
I want to heal this pain I hide inside
Free my fears and promise me
That you won't let me go
You're the one to comfort me
The past my God You know

Believe me
I'm not afraid
Teach me
To learn your ways
Carry me
Under your wings
In your perfect time

Only you
Can make me shine
Only you
Can days be right
In your perfect time
