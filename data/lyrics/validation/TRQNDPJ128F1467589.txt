Hey pal
Can I take your picture for the people back home
They won't believe it when they see this stuff
You see the camera that I got in Hong Kong
Completely duty free

This really is a pretty scene
But could you ask your kid to smile please
Sorry what exactly do you mean
Can you say it in English
(Say it in English)
'Cause we're the . . 

Jet set - get out of our way
And don't be messin' with the . . 
Jet set - get out of our way
We got a lot of things to see

Let's get a Big Mac
Get it while the dollar's worth a thousand yen
It's quite a bargain here
Next year
We'll save some money and we'll hire Big Ben
For our anniversary

This really is a pretty place
But I'm happy I don't live here
Hey what's the matter with the waiter's face
Can you say it in English
(Say it in English)
'Cause we're the . . 

Jet set - get out of our way
And don't be messin' with the . . 
Jet set - get out of our way
We got a lot of things to see

We're the jet set
Don't be messing with the jet set

Jet set

We're the jet set
Get out of our way
Don't be messin' with the . . 
Jet set - get out of our way
You know we got a lot of things to see
