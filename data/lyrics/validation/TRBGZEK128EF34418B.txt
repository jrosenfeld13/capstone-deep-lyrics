I want to be ready
When the Son Almighty comes
To lay claim to Him
And Him, alone

I want to be ready
To stand at His side
For His eyes to gaze upon me
In His glory and might

I want to be ready
I want to be ready
I want to be ready
For Him and Him, alone
I want to be

I want to be ready
To cry out His name
To lay up in His arms
Delight in His fame

I want to be ready
To be embraced by His love
Before Thee Almighty
To take me up above

I want to be ready
I want to be ready
I want to be ready
For Him and Him, alone

I want to be ready
I want to be ready
I want to be ready

To gaze upon Your throne
To give You all I own
O my King

To fall upon my knees
To give You all the glory

I want to be ready
I want to be ready
I want to be ready
For You alone
I want to be
