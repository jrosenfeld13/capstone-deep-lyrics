Exploitation of young
Consumer groups
Inspired to say yes
Debasement by
Your mad persuasion
Destroyed while you progress

Bullet in the head
Kick the bucket
Are you prepared?

There is a bullet in your head
To stop the way
You earn your bread

Cold blooded and mendacious
Selling of illusions
Ferocious without remorse
You give them a trip
Like there is no tomorrow
Don't care what H. will cause

Bullet in the head
Kick the bucket
Are you prepared?

There is a bullet in your head
To stop the way
You earn your bread

Suffer the children
Coming to me
Enjoy the habit
The first is free
The best you can get
Between heaven and earth
Nothing ventured
Nothing gained

Bullet in the head
Kick the bucket
Are you prepared?

There is a bullet in your head
To stop the way
You earn your bread
