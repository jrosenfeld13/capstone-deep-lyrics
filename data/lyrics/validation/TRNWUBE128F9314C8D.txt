A man takes his seat by himself he stares at his plate life has taken a bite i want to cry or just cry out wanting to speak but i don't even try so we go on our way to wind down the days what is it that makes life this way? i will leave you alone as i leave alone what could have been had i not kept to my own? there is a woman i see every week on the street i think of the life we could have if i'd speak we don't say a word lovers who will never meet i have to live out my life in my sleep walking around in a cage every day what is it that makes life this way? i'm just a simple man who's lost his way hoping that i'll find real life one day shrinking through life never making a sound who will hear us when we fall to the ground? a shile at last as my head hits the floor i don't have to live like this anymore
