As I turn and walk away
Can't believe the things you say
No more I cannot stay
I feel our time is over
I have always been the same
I am not the one to blame
Yourself and don't complain
I feel our time is over
I can't take this I can't fake this
Sometimes I just want to break it
No I can't just walk away
So much more we have to say
You love me I will stay
Maybe the pain is over
Long as you can bear the shame
I am not the one to blame
Is yours so don't complain
Maybe the hurt is over
Anger coming
Can't control me
Lost in agony
Pain is growing
Hatred growing
Anger flowing
The hating elevating
I feel my control is fading
Hear me as I plead
You better stay away from me
Pressure flowing
And now my anger is showing
The hating elevating
And now my control is fading
I will turn and walk away
Can't believe the things you say
No more I cannot stay
I feel our time is over
I have always been the same
I am not the one to blame
Is yours I feel no pain
I feel my life is over
