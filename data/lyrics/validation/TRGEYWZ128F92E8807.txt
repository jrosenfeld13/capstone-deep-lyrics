(Verse 1)
You were walking towards my first
Apartment with hesitance
Feeling like you were making mistakes
Oh I've made them I'm sorry
It's an awkward time to replace
History with feelings
But I'll suck the pain out anyways
I'm hardly alive now

(Pre-chorus)
So cut into my chest
And leave me on the bed

(Chorus)
I could crawl on my hands and my knees
Change the way I do everything
My desires crumble away
Leaving me safe driving away

(Verse 2)
I've been a mess no sleep for weeks
My head hurts I've earned it
The other day I heard your voice
For the first time in two years

(Pre-chorus 2)
It should keep me on my way
Chasing after you

(Chorus 2)
I could crawl on my hands and my knees
Change the way I do everything
My desires crumble away
Leaving me safe driving away
Keeping me all alone
Thinking away everything

(Bridge)
Start my car and drive
I'm headed to you and
I'll never hide my face
I'll never go running away again

(Chorus)

(Chorus 2)
