Night, here comes the night
Another night to dream about you
Night, each lonely night
The only time I'm not without you

Once more, I feel your kisses
Once more, I know what bliss is
Comes dawn, my darling, you're gone
But you come back into my arms each night

Once more, I feel your kisses
Once more, I know what bliss is
Comes dawn, my darling, you're gone
But you come back into my arms each night
