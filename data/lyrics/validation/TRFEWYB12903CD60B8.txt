You're always cold
You're always sad
You can't get more
Than what you have

When night is falling
When all is quiet
You get back home
The morning comes
Get out of bed
The sun shines on
Not in your head
Imagining problems
Inventing lies
It helps your soul

You want golden hair
You want great affairs
A sweet home in the fields
And a potion for
Eternal youth
Never grow old and sad again

You wanna run but
You think you fly
And when you fall
The sorrow rises
Imagining poems
Inventing friends
Who could help

You want a boy
Who calls you dear
The only songs
You wanna hear
Are tearing your little heart out
That's what you need

You want valentine
With good red wine
A big black horse and
A diamond ring and then you think
To those things you already got
