Between the lines
More is meant than meets the eye
I can see so clearly now
The secrecy the tell tale signs
Hollow words fall on evil days
A byword of reproach
A burning shame, a dark mistake you made

I can't forgive...
I can't forgive...

The gift of sadness, proud in hand
You often bring
Common enemies, masking words
Untruthfulness in everything
I'm first to admit my self-destructive choice
Where do I go from here
I sense the lies
I sense the fear in your voice
