Chorus:
Dim all the lights, we darlin'
Cause tonight it's all the way
Turn up the old victrola
Gonna dance the night away

Love it dont come easy
No it seldom does
When you find the perfect love
Let it fill you up

Chorus

Love it dont come easy
No it seldom does
When you find the perfect love
Let it fill you up

Dim all the lights we honey
Cause tonight it's you and me
No need to worry darlin'
Cause its for eternity

Love it don't come easy
This you know I understand
Want to be your woman
If you'll be my man

Let yourself go free and i'll
Show you things that you've dreamed of
Dont think that you're dreaming
Cause we found the perfect love
And i'm not a get caught
So fill me up oh!

Dim all the lights, we darlin'
Cause tonight it's all the way
Turn up the old victrola
Gonna dance the night away

Do what you want
You can use me all up
Take me all of the time
Dont believe me one dry

Do it tonight
You know a woman so right
Baby dont you read my mind
Coem on dim all the lights

Chorus (2x)
