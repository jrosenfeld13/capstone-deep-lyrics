Searching for truth to hold onto
Your looking for a reason
So much confusion, the world is crying out
It's time for me to speak aloud
I will never be silent, can never be tamed
I will always speak Your name

Chorus:
You invade my soul
Lord take control
I'm coming back, coming back to
(2x)

Throw away your sadness and let it go
Let the oil of gladness take control
Give Him your burdens, cast your cares
He died for you, He'll always be there

Chorus

You, your always there
I remember you, you remember me
I live in You

Holy are you, worthy are you
Your worthy of the praise I bring to You
I lift my voice to worship You
Then you come, then you come

You invade my soul, yeah you take control
Im coming back, coming back

Chourus (4x)
