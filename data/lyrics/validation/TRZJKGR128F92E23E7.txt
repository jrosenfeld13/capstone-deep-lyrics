See these arms that were broken
How they held you so
Never once did they fail you
They won't let you go

We're just waiting looking skyward
As the days go by
Someone promised there'd be answers
If we stayed around

Over decades, now this romance
Has sustained us all
Never questioned only giving
What it made us for
