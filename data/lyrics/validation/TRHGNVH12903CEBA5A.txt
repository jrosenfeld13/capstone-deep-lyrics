In the cool of the evening
When everything is getting kind of groovy
I call you up and ask you
If you like to go with me and see a movie?
First, you say no, you got some plans for tonight
And then you stop and say all right
Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little girl like you

You always keep me guessing
I never seem to know what you are thinking
(Spooky spooky girl like you)
And if a fella looks at you
It's for sure your little eye will be a-winking
(Spooky spooky girl like you)
I get confused, cause I don't know where I stand
And then you smile and hold my hand
Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little girl like you
(Spooky spooky)
Spooky

If you decide some day to stop this little game
That you are playing
(Spooky girl like you)
I'm gonna tell you all the things
My heart had been a-dying to be saying
(Spooky girl like you)
Just like a ghost you've been a-haunting my dreams
So I'll propose on Halloween
Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little girl like you
(Spooky spooky)
Spooky

(Spooky spooky girl like you)
Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little girl like you
