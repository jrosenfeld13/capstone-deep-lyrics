She opened her eyes
With a look of surprise
And she started to cry
She remembered the dream
Which wasn't a dream
Abbey of Thelema

Going to another place
Running in another race
She tried to do what she would
That was the law she understood

I was on another plane
She was out alone again
Scarlet women ride the beast
And Leah will enjoy the feast
She will enjoy the feast
She will enjoy the feast
Leah will enjoy the feast

If she follows the law
Then she can sure open any door
It's not for the fool
And it's not for the mule
Shaytan makes the rule

Going to another place
Or running in another race
She tried to do what she would
That was the law she understood

I was on another plane
She was out alone again
Scarlet women ride the beast
And Leah will enjoy the feast
She will enjoy the feast
She will enjoy the feast, Leah

Going to another place
Running in another race
She tried to do what she would
That was the law she understood

I was on another plane
She was out alone again
Scarlet women ride the beast
And Leah will enjoy the feast
She will enjoy the feast
She will enjoy the feast
She will enjoy the feast
She will enjoy the feast
