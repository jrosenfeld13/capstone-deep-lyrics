Look
Look cus
I don't care how hard they f*cking try
Or, how many stunts they wanna pull
Cus them clowns will never see me fall
They'll never pull the wool over my pupils
I know there's no pitch, no studs, but I stay on the ball
Now I've seen it all
They wanna see me fall like the berlin wall
Play the typical black fool and loose my cool
They want to me to burn like guyfawkes
They wanna hear dead on arrival
They wanna destroy my character like my childhood idol michael
No way!
Look cus mandem know how it is when trying to get paper
Life is bloody stressful
But some of my own friends don't wanna see me be successful
Cus certain heads are bad minds
So friendships not perpetual
We're enemies now, they can kiss my ass, I hope they burn in petrol
Yes I think I'm special
I feel it in my vessels
I'll climb to the top and try not to drop just like a game of netball
I'm like an elephant, never forgetful
But always respectful
To those who wanna see me prosper and get to where I wanna get to
But see me fall I won't let you
Watch me crash out you won't get too
And if I fall slightly. I swear down, I bet you
I'll come back 10x stronger and even more vengeful
So attempt to see fall, na lowe that blud don't even attempt to
{I don't know wagwan for certain mandem out there you see it
Straight up and down it's like mans on a grind out here and all they can do is
Hate and pray to see man drop on the floor and them ting
And when they in mans face they just fake and ting and you see it.}
Cus when they spot me or they hug me
I know they wish me bad luck
They wanna see me holding my face or maybe locked in handcuffs
An alcoholic, hooked on work maybe I'll be a copper
I hardly drink, I don't even smoke and that's a matter of fact cus
I'm in this ting for the long haul
Like pope john paul and I won't fall until I, hear gods call
Supporters jump on board
Haterz you're ignored
My opposers will get fought
Because my pen is my sword
You'll never see me fall!
