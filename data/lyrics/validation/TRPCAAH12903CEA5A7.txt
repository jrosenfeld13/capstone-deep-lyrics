[Verse 1]
Well, that cocaine habit's mighty bad
It's the worst old habit that I've ever had
Hey, hey, honey, take a whiff on me

[Chorus]
Take a whiff on me, take a whiff on me
All you rounders take a whiff on me
Hey, hey; Honey, take a whiff on me

[Verse 2]
Well, I went to Mr. Lehman in a lope
He got sign on the window, said "No more dope"
Hey, hey; Honey, take a whiff on me

[Chorus]
Take a whiff on me, take a whiff on me
All you rounders take a whiff on me
Hey, hey; Honey, take a whiff on me

[Verse 3]
I love my whiskey, and I love my gin
But the way I love my coke that's a doggone sin
Hey, hey; Honey, take a whiff on me

[Chorus]
Take a whiff on me, take a whiff on me
All you rounders take a whiff on me
Hey, hey; Honey, take a whiff on me

[Verse 4]
Now, if you don't believe cocaine is good
You ask Karl Rove and Elijah Wood
Hey, hey; Honey take a whiff on me

[Chorus]
Take a whiff on me, take a whiff on me
All you rounders take a whiff on me
Hey, hey; Honey, take a whiff on me
Take a whiff on me, take a whiff on me
All you rounders take a whiff on me
Hey, hey; Honey, take a whiff on me
