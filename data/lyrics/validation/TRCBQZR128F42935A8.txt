Intro:
Hey now brother man hit me with music
Hey now brother man hit me with love

Verse 1:
Brother wont you hit me with your love
Big it up and give me some of your sensi
Now brother wont you hit me
I say one time with your love
Come right on sweet reggae song
You know that we want to do it all night long
Its not the way the doctor ring dong mash his drum
Sounds like a bomb please give me some

Chorus:
Oh brother man you cant bring us down
Cause theres to much love inna this town
Sstruggle and push to get the ground
But no brother man dem not cant bring us down
Get together, we can have a party
Right about now I think its time to get it started
Jump up and down move it all around
Hey brother man dem not cant bring us down no

Verse 2:
Stuck in a mess too much stress
We play the music to bring you higherness
Put me to the test anyone can be the best
Lets groove it and feel the love in your chest
Keep moving just like in a game of soccer
Its getting hot someone bring me some water
Watch out Mister I got my eyes on your daughter
My body's gonna drop, oo oo
Call the doctor!
The way she move her hipps
The way she shake her hair
The way she lick her lips tell me
I better be aware
When she starts to move the bottom of her buttocks
I should be the one that tells you that she realy rocks

Chorus:
See now brother man dem not cant bring us down
Cause theres to much love inna this town
Struggle and push to get the ground
But no brother man dem not can't bring us down
Get together, we can have a party
Right about now I think its time to get it started
Jump up and down move it all around
Hey brother man dem not cant bring us down no
Ganja feeling, ganja Feeling
Coming right down upon all of ya
Ganja feeling, ganja Feeling
Coming right down
