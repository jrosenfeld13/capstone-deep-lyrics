[Verse 1]
Can you stay up for the weekend
And blame God for looking too old?
Can you find all that you stand for
Has been replaced with mountains of gold?
You can untrain yourself to notice
To feel pain and swallow fear
But can you stay up for the weekend
'Til next year?

[Pre-Chorus]
God, I cant do this any more
Though I'll be laid down on the floor
As many feet walk through the door
Im not alone

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 2]
If I see a light flashing, could this mean that Im coming home?
If I see a man waving, does this mean that Im not alone?
If I see a light flashing, could this mean that Im coming home?
If I see a man waving, does this mean that Im not alone? No

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 3]
If I see a light flashing, could this mean that Im coming home?
If I see a man waving, does this mean that Im not alone?
If I see a light flashing, could this mean that Im coming home?
If I see a man waving, does this mean that Im not alone? No

[Instrumental Chorus]
