Talk, talk.. Empty sentiment
I haven't got the heart for disappointment
Ten thousand reasons why i should get out
The state you're in, i better get you home

Car crash, running through my head
I'm saying things that are best left unsaid
Stop looking at me that way
I'm not the answer, i'll be your anchor

Tired of the fight
Well i dont understand you better than most
I am just your friend, with troubles of my own
And i don't understand you better than most
Better than most

You say you're unravelling
I haven't got the heart to watch you crying
One for the road, and another for the darkness
I'll get you home and tomorrow you'll forget this

Get ready for the fight
Well i don't understand you better than most
I am just your friend, with troubles of my own
And i dont understand you better than most
Better than most

Hailstones beating on my heart
And i'm tired of holding back
What if i was to? What would be so wrong with that?
These days i'm surrounded by people i dont even like
But boy, you are a flower, tonight i'll be a liar
And tell you, it's not right..

That i dont understand you better than most
I am just your friend with troubles of my own
And i dont understand you better than most
Better than most
