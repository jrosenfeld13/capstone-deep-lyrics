[Verse 1]
People
They don't mean a thing to you
They move right through you
Just like your breath
But sometimes
I still think of you
And I just wanted to
Just wanted you to know
My old friend...
I swear I never meant for this
I never meant...

[Hook]
Don't look at me that way
It was an honest mistake
Don't look at me that way
It was an honest mistake
An honest mistake

[Verse 2]
Sometimes
I forget I'm still awake
I fuck up and say these things out loud

My old friend...
I swear I never meant for this
I never meant...

[Hook]
Don't look at me that way
It was an honest mistake
Don't look at me that way
It was an honest mistake
An honest mistake

[Hook]
Don't look at me that way
It was an honest mistake
Don't look at me that way
It was an honest mistake
An honest mistake
