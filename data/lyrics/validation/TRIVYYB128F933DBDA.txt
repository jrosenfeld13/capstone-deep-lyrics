Life is one big road, with a lot a signs
Youthman growing up pon di borderline
Better yu live in love an nuh commit nuh crime
Oh venders Beenie Man a sey is your time again
Life is one big road, with a lot a signs
Youthman growing up pon di borderline
Better yu live in love an nuh commit nuh crime
Oh venders, woah now

[Verse 1]
How comes the Babylon a talk 'bout all the gun things fi down
When dem a stop the hustlin' and mek nuh dollars nah run
Di youth dem have a tendency fi tun to dem gun
Fi tie up Mr. Chin and all bruck him place down
Well dem haffi wear the latest brand wey come down
Ghetto boys and ghetto girls dem just want to have fun
To big up all the people who sell a arcade
Most a dem a ghetto people and dem people dem nuh fraid
But wha happen to teh youths dem wey can't buy nuh stall
Wey string up pon di sidewalk and mek a one call
Government nuh matter 'bout dem people deh a tall
Dem only cater fi di people who a mek dem tax tall

[Chorus]

Di others lock a hallah fi a yatty

Life is harmony, life is freedom, life is long love
Give thanks to on to Halli Sailassie but cho
