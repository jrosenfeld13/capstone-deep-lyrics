[Verse]
Some people drink champagne out under the stars
While others drink wine leaning over a bar
But all that I need dear to make me feel fine
Is to know that your love will forever be mine
I'd give an ocean of diamonds or a world filled with flowers
To hold you closely for just a few hours
Hear you whisper softly that you love me too
Would change all the dark clouds to bluest of blue
I don't drink their champagne and I don't drink their wine
So if you refuse me my poor heart will pine
I'll be so lonely till the day that I die
And as long as I live dear you'll still hear me cry
