I'm happy just to be with you
And loving you the way I do
It's everything I need to know
Just resting in the afterglow of your...

Love,love is all around me
Everywhere
Love has come to touch my soul
With someone who really cares
No one can deny us
People who once passed me by
Will turn their heads 'round

I'm happy just to be with you
And loving you the way I do, yeah
It's everything I need to know
Just resting in the afterglow of your love

You
Yes you have always been here
Feeling deep inside
A feeling that I could not see
Or touch, or try to hide
My love is in and around you
I bless the day that I found you
So listen up baby

I'm happy just to be with you
And loving you the way I do, yeah
It's everything I need to know
Just resting in the afterglow of your love

Love is like a voice in my head
Keeps turning 'round the things that we said

I'm happy just to be with you
And loving you the way I do, yeah
It's everything I need to know
Just resting in the afterglow of your love
