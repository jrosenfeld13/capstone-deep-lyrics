How can I give a testimony of my life
When I'm still trying hard to hold my head up high
I'm trying so hard to hold my head up high

And every time I turn around
Feel as though I've let you down
Always something else
And every time I turn around
Feel as though I've let ya down
But I can't outrun myself

How can I give a testimony of my time
When it's so hard to pen a simple valentine
It weighs a little heavy on my mind

And every time I turn around
Feel as though I've let you down
Always something else
And every time I turn around
Feel as though I've let ya down
But I can't outrun myself

Oh oh you know
If I told ya once I've told you loads before
I couldn't love ya more

And every time I turn around
Feel as though I've let you down
Always something else
And every time I turn around
Feel as though I've let ya down
But I can't outrun myself
No oh oh oh
But I can't outrun myself
Ooh ooh ooh
