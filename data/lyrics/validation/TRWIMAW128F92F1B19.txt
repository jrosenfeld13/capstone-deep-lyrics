Violence everywhere i go, in everyone i meet
Down the club, In the disco, Violence on the street
The way you stand alone and proud, the way you crop your hair
Violence in your boots and braces, Violence in your stare

(chorus)We've got Violence
Violence
Violence
Ultra Violence, Blood on the Streets
Violence down the football, Violence in the pub
Violence is a way of life, violence you love
And your friends, kids of Britain til you run amok
You got violence is in your mind but you don't give a f***

(chorus)
