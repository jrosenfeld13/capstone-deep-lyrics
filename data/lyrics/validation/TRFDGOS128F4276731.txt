So here we are, back to the start again
Trying hard to wait til morning
Hey, rise and shine and open up your eyes
To give this world some color
Shine on, diamond eyes
Separate the space between love and lies

[Chorus]
And as days go by, the memories remain
I'll wait for you
And as days go by, the memories remain
I won't let go

These days remain the same
Pictures fade away
Please, don't ever change
Please, don't change your mind
No matter what they say, I'll always wait

[Chorus]

These days remain the same
Pictures fade away
I hope you never fade
As you drip through my veins
Shine on, shine on, diamond eyes

As days go by, I swear Ill try until I die
Anything for you
