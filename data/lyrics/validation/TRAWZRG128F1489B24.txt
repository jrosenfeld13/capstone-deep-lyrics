Shot down a million times
But I won't be fooled again
I need some time to figure it out
And put things on the mend
They say that time heals all
Well I hope that's true for me
Been stabbed in the back so many times
By my troubled history
Just need a reason why can't I just justify
All the pain and suffering
Yell Out in defiance
Your world's not for me
Confused on a path down a one-way street
Blind from what I can't see
I did it once before like some stupid trend
But I won't be fooled again
Blank stares from a million eyes
That are looking back at me
I sit around and ask myself
Just what the fuck they see
Am I all that you ever wanted
Do I fit your policy?
Won't be a victim of your mad disease
Or your uniformity
