I couldn't close my eyes
I stayed up all night
I thought of promises
You gave me for life
Your words were racing through my head
"Forever together"

I just remembered that you swore
You won't lie
Cause you're in love again
There's nothing to hide
Of all the other ones you've had
Baby you can't fool me

I take no prisoners
I have no demands
But baby let me make you understand

I don't know
What you did last night
Keep your secrets, maybe I'll keep mine
Watch your step
Like I told you to
I'm keeping my eye on you
Keeping my eye on you

You got the best of me
I think that's allright
But don't you mess with me
You'll never survive
Cause there's a part of you I feel
That drives me crazy

I've learned to trust myself
And nobody else
It's in the way you look at me
I can tell
You try so hard to make me feel good
Baby, I don't buy it

I take no prisoners
I have no demands
But I don't want a lover second hand

REPEAT CHORUS :
I take no prisoners
I don't take a chance
I'd pull the trigger
And you'd understand

REPEAT CHORUS :
