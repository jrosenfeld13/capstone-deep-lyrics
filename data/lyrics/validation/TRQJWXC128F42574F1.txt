He gets his information from overhearing conversations
He doesn't ask questions, doesn't learn many lessons
And he keeps his mouth shut until it boils over and he blows up
And then he can't form his words right, and they don't fit together so tight
And I hope to God that he will find his name
And not listen to his so called friends when they so boldly say

"This is the way that you are," don't let them say
"This is the way that you are"

She doesn't have much to say about yesterday, or what happened to her when she was eight
So she drinks a lot and it makes her feel okay for the moment, but it's gone when she awakes
And I hope you know that Someone out there loves you
So don't give yourself away
And don't listen to what they say
