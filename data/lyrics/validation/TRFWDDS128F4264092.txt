I was comin' off of a heartache;
Addin' up all my mistake: you know how it is
An' I was beatin' up myself up real good
Over all those "shoulda coulds but never dids"
An' I could lose myself in my self-pity
But I done that an' that ain't pretty
An' somewhere in this mess I've made
Is my philosophy

That if you don't jump every chance you get
Roll a dice an' run some risks
If you don't fall, then how you ever gonna fly?
An' if you don't break an' you don't bruise
If you don't look back an' laugh at one or two
Wrong moves in your life
You ain't doin' it right

I've been flush an' flat broke
Made some lousy bets, but that's ok, yeah that's all right
'Cause never gamblin', never losin'
Is a sorry substitution for livin' life
Yeah, I've got scars that I'm proud of
I been down but I got up
An' the only thing I know about love is
There ain't no guarantees

So if you don't jump every chance you get
Roll a dice an' run some risks
If you don't fall, then how you ever gonna fly?
An' if you don't break an' you don't bruise
If you don't look back an' laugh at one or two
Wrong moves in your life
You ain't doin' it right

So go ahead an' put the bow to the fiddle
Pick you a spot an' jump in the middle
Love just a little
Then love just a little more

If you don't jump every chance you get
Roll a dice an' run some risks
If you don't fall, then how you ever gonna fly?
And if you don't break an' you don't bruise
And if you don't look back an' laugh at one or two
Wrong moves in your life
You ain't doin' it right

Naw, you ain't doin' it right
