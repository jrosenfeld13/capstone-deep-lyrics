So humane and so incredibly
Well preserved for a moment such as this
In his eyes ten thousand enemies
In his head one pocket for a kiss
All the animals hunting everywhere
Trying everything for something more or less

Lock all your animals in cages
Hide your weakness forget your fears
Live by the laws you made for your safety
Safe behind the walls
You thought would last for years
He's just an isolated case
Johnny jumps and Johnny comes clean
He's just an isolated case
Johnny jumps and Johnny comes clean

Wise men and animals live by their instincts
Their motive for fightings their will to win
Wise man never loved doesn't need the complication
Passion brings no fascination
Doesn't like to think
Animal feelings need no hidden meanings
I'd love to have lied
But I couldn't so I cried

Lock all your animals in cages
Hide your weakness forget your fears
Live by the laws you made for your safety
Safe behind the walls
You thought would last for years
He's just an isolated case
Johnny jumps and Johnny comes clean
He's just an isolated case
Johnny jumps and Johnny comes clean

I'm not messiah I can't move a mountain
I'm not superman I can't save the world
I'm sick of following I'm sick of leaders
Nothing seems to help
But something got to have to

He's just an isolated case
He's just an isolated case
He's just an isolated case
Johnny jumps and Johnny comes clean
