[Verse 1:]
Woke up this morning
Feeling so bad
Out my window, it was raining
Didn't even feel like running
I didn't feel like doing anything

Then the phone wouldn't stop ringing
And my head wouldn't stop pounding
I feel so down I don't know why
There's something overwhelming me inside

[Chorus:]
Just one of those days
Just another day, it don't go your way
(And tomorrow can't come soon enough for me)

Just one of those days- oooh
Just another day, it don't go your way
(And tomorrow can't come soon enough)

[Verse 2:]
Gotta get up, anyhow
I can't afford to lose no hours
Got a deadline that I must meet
Every second matters to me
Hard to function feeling like this

But I got to keep on going
Am I in a huddle to get over
I've got to do things much darker and colder

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Hook:]
Why does it seem
(Like the hours are much longer, like the day just won't be over)
(Tell me why)
Why do they fly
(When you least expect them, always you can never breathe in those days)

[Repeat Chorus 2x:]

La la la la
(Just one of those days)
La la la
La la la
(Tomorrow can't come soon enough for me)

La la la la
La la la
(Just another day)
La la la
(Gotta get up)

La la la la
La la la
(I've got to do things much darker and colder)
La la la la
