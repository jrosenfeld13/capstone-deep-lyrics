Ping Pong, pool, poker and spades
Dominos, dice, darts and Charades
Eight Ball, Nine Ball, 42, Moon
I ain't playing games with you
I ain't playing games with you

Tenaha, Timpson, Bobo and Blair
Inside, outside, up or down stairs
Walla Walla, Washington, Newport News
I'd go anywhere you ask me to
I'll go anywhere you want me to

Chorus:
Dance in the moonlight, dance in the shade
Dance in the kitchen while the marmalades made
Fifty pounds of peaches, sugar in a sack
Please be sweet, honey, take me back
Oh honey, come on won't you take me back

Richey Rich, Batman, Archie and The Hulk
Read my funny books, sit around and sulk
Rembrandt, Remington, Russell H3
Do I have to paint a picture; I need you here with me
Do I gotta paint a picture; I need you here with me

Chorus:
Dance in the front yard, dance on the side
Dance in the kitchen while the chicken gets fried
White meat, dark meat, wishbone crack
I sure hope you'll take me back
Cross my fingers that you'll take me back

I sure love you
I hope you can find a way to love me too

Snap, crackle, pop, walk a mile for a Camel
Scrubbing bubble action won't hurt your enamel
Name your bologna the man behind the star
I ain't selling nothing I like who you are
I ain't selling nothing I like who you are

Chorus:
Dance on a dirt road, dance where it's paved
Dance in the kitchen while the gravy gets made
Little bit of flour and grease make rue
Keep on stirring till it all gets smooth
I really want to smooth things out with you
I really want to smooth things out with you
