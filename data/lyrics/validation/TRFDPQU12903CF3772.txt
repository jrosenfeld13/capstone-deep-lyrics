Well I spend my money 'cuz I don't care
I hoard my dollars 'cuz I won't share
It's a time to communicate, a time to be shrewd
A time to liberate, a time to be rude

OH OH, OH OH, OH ain't got no sense, OH OH, OH

My mother kicked the bucket and my dad's on his way
Well I can hardly wait to cash his pay
My little sister's shy 'cuz she's got no sense
She learns her lesson when I get intense

OH OH, OH OH, OH ain't got no sense, OH OH, OH

Does she love me for the money, that I keep for my own
Does she love me, really love me tonight
Well I spend my money 'cuz I don't care
I hoard my dollars 'cuz I won't share
It's a time to communicate, a time to be shrewd
A time to liberate, a time to be rude

OH OH, OH OH, OH ain't got no sense, OH OH, OH

Does she love me for the money, that I keep for my own
Really love me, really love me tonight

If I could change your mind, then things, they would be fine
If I could change your mind, then things, they would be fine
If I could change your mind, then things, they would be fine
Then I know

Well I spend my money 'cuz I don't care
I hoard my dollars 'cuz I won't share
It's a time to communicate, a time to be shrewd
A time to liberate, a time to be rude

OH OH, OH OH, OH ain't got no sense, OH OH, OH
