Do you have a minute
Can you spare me a line?
I'm sure you've got the words
But do you have the time?
Do you have a reason
Try and tell me why?
I know it ain't easy to believe your own lies

This is a call for your final thought
This is a call for your final breath
This is the call

Cry me tears of joy
If this is what you want
This is what you voted for
Your wish has been granted
Spare me the sorrow
And every hollow phrase
You know you played and gambled, lost an entire race

This is a call for your final thought
This is a call for your final breath
This is the call
