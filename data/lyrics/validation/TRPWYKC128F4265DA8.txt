A lot of people think I'm evil
Because I am not in their world
But then again, who would want to be like them?
And in their weakness they will cheat this
And act like they are always winnin'
And if you're one of them I have something for you

I'm so, you're so
Simple-minded (x4)

And in this situation
Time is changing
I'm still waiting for you to say
Something I understand
So I can deal with you
And in your mental little ways that
Make you look to me so tasty
I'd like to be inside of you
To feel like you

I'm so, you're so
Simple-minded (x4)

I'm so simple minded like the one that...
Is so simple minded like the one that...
Is so simple minded like you (x2)

I'm so, you're so
Simple-minded (x4)
