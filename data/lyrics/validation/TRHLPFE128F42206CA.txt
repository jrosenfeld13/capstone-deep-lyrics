Every time I stop and think
I'm hit with everything
That I was taught about right and wrong
And what to get used to
They're cheating in the seats of SUVs
In the shade of the trees
Down my street, behind the backs of husbands, wives and bosses
And I'm sitting here with my dog, six beers and my guitar
On this porch of wood making them my business
They say the economy is in a slump
And folks like them, they're giving up
They jump from planes, in front of trains, and some from bridges
That's alright, that ain't my life
I cough all morning and I smoke all night
That's alright, that ain't my life
I pay $200 rent and I work when I like
Woah woah, where did we go wrong?
Woah woah, have I been sitting out too long?
No cash in my hands means I'm nothing to you
But I won't sell myself
I've got this friend close to me
She called from NYC
Said she's got stock options, salary and full benefits
She works the 22nd floor
In a cubicle built for her
She answers phones and talks a bunch about investments
Well she's finally in love
She met some guy from Texas
She says he's the one but she has yet to meet him
They talk now everyday, online to communicate
I said fuck that job, fuck that new beau, yeah fuck that pension
Cause that ain't right, that ain't no life
You work a 60 hour week to see one hour of sunlight
That ain't right, no that ain't no life
That guy, when you finally meet in the end, you won't even like
Woah woah, where did we go wrong?
Woah woah, have I been sitting out too long?
No cash in my hands means I'm nothing to you.,
But I won't sell myself
Every time I stop and think
I'm hit with everything
That I was taught about right and wrong
And what to get used to
I let the greedy deal with greed
I ain't got nothing but myself
And I ain't selling that for no one else
I won't surround my emptiness with greed
Or shit I don't even need
In don't ask don't tell relationships based on infidelity
I know it ain't right, it ain't much of a life
But I let tomorrow be tomorrow
And let tonight be tonight
