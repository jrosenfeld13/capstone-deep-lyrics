[Verse 1]
Waltzing Matilda, looked at her wallet
The sexy one smiled in dismay
She pulled out four twenties
'Cause she liked round figures
Everybody stayed for a day
I think I'm on fire and you know I admire you
Buy it, why don't we slip away
Although I'm sure you're certain
It's a rarity me flirting
Sha la la la lay, come on

[Hook]
Sha la la la la, Sha la la la la, Sha la la la la
Come on and slip away, Sha la la

[Verse 2]
Cascading lowly he entered her slowly
And showed her where he coming from
And sha la la la la. Made love to her gently
Just like she had never come
And sha la la la la. Sha la la la
When the sun rose and she made to leave
And sha la la la la. Sha la la la you know
Neither one regretted a thing

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
We need your loving so badly
We need your loving so
Slip away, come on, slip away
Sha la la la la, Sha la la la la
Love has gone away
She took the ring from my finger
And there's nothing left to say
We need your loving so badly
We need your loving so
Come on, slip away
