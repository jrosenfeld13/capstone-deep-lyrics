-(Welcome all, (x3), my friends)-
-(Welcome all, (x3), again)- (repeat)
...Welcome all again (x4)

Waking the day - All seems in order
Sweet water taste - The world's now starting

-(Yeah, yeah)- I got the mountain foreground
-(Yeah, yeah)- I've got the river deep down

[Chorus]
-(Woo-hoo-hoo)- Welcome all my friends
-(Woo-hoo-hoo)- Welcome all again

Night time in bloom - It's not so frightening
Swim with the Moon - That's how we like it

(-(Yeah, yeah)- We got the singer singin'
-(Yeah, yeah)- We got the drinker drinkin'

[Chorus]...
...-(Woo-hoo-hoo)- Welcome all my friends

[Chorus x2]
