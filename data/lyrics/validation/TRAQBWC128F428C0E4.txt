The sweetest girl in the world
Is my blue eyed Jane
We fell in love like turtle doves
While the moon was shining down

I asked her then I asked her when
The wedding bells would ring
She said, oh dear, it seems so clear
That this could happen here

Yeah, you are my little pal
And I never knew a sweeter gal
My little blue eyed Jane
I love you so

And when the sun goes down
And the shadow's creeping over town
Just meet me in the lane
My blue eyed Jane

Jannie dear, listen here
I've come to say farewell
The world is drear without you dear
But now, I cannot linger here

I'm going away, this very day
Oh, please, come go with me
I'll be sad and blue, I'm wanting you
Longing all day through

My little, blue eyed Jane
You'll always be the same sweet thing
I know, you'll never change
I love you so

And when the sun goes down
And the shadow's creeping over town
Then I'll come back again
My blue eyed Jane

And when the sun goes down
And the shadow's creeping over town
Then I'll come back again
My blue eyed Jane
