There was a time when you were mine

I thought you were mine, there was a time

We would go on, out in the sunshine

We talk on for hours, and forget the time

The stars always shone, over our bed at night

And made you look just right, every night

We wished for things, and swore theyd come true

We made some plans to follow through

Me and you

When i looked to you i knew i love you

And i was so sure about it, when i looked to you

Time brought on tears, you went away

Through all my fears, i thought i could stay

We wished for things, that never came true

We made some plans, that fell through

On me and you

Autumn leaves blow around me

I see your ghost, pass from tree to tree

Theres noone here with me

Now i walk alone, on such a perfect day

I think of a time, and smile on your face

Cause i thought i knew, so much about you

And you knew me so well too

We wished for things i thought we could do

Now i want to know you love me anyway

Yea i want to know you love me anyway
