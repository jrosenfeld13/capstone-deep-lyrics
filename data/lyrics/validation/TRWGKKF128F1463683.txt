[Verse 1]
Time will swallow
Your precious time
Like magic create the future

[Chorus 1]
What makes a man so fickle?
Who put the daggers in those eyes?
Was it to learn through dark days of struggle?
Was it to burn, to burst all our bubbles?
Thunder and rain
Well the cynical flame, will it heat, stick and blister?
Thunder and rain

[Verse 2]
Evangelistic brother
Should be banging a tambourine
Go wash your hands and fingers
'Til your mind is clean

[Chorus 2]
Was it your fate
To sleep like a normal?
Time and decay
No man is immortal
Thunder and rain, boredom and pain lit the cynical flame
Will it heat stick and blister?
Thunder and rain
Still try to resist the pessimist, the pessimist, no, no

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
And these things I find
In the back of my mind
Where time lasts forever
I get all mixed up, think I'm all mankind

[Chorus 3]
Listen, Mr. Pessimister
With your Catholic taste
Oh, listen, Mr. Pessimister, Pessimister
We do not relate
Listen, Mr. Pessimister, Pessimister, Pessimister
Mr. Pessimister
