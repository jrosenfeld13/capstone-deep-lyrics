Ain't gonna hesitate
The way we'd like to see you are and feel the way
Hear that song and sing all day and make it pay
The people want to jump and say make our way
You sounded like you came from mars

Times are changing and I'll take my chance on a steel river
Rearranging all the faces and the places I've seen

I like the way
The way your eyes they seem to say take me away
And would ya know it's not the same
So would ya please me
Think back the trade it's you for free you'd stop the day
This one ratt is on to say

Times are changing and I'll take my chance on a steel river
Rearranging all the faces and the places I've seen
Times are changing and I'll take my chance
On a steel river
Yeah

A railbreak
The way we'd like to see G.R
And hear the way
You sounded like a man from mars

Times are changing and I'll take my chance on a steel river
Rearranging all the faces and the places I've seen
Times are changing and I'll take my chance
On a steel river

Steel river
On a steel river
On a steel river
On a steel river
Yeah
