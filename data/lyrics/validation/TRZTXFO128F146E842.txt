[Verse 1]
Rely on me to supply your needs from now on
Shelter you and be a pillar to lean on
For in your eyes I see what I was born to be

[Chorus 1]
And now, now my life can begin
For I am your man
Oh yes, I am, yes I am
I'm your man

[Verse 2]
There's no sacrifice great or small I wouldn't do
See my ambition is, is bringin' happiness to you
And if trouble comes our way
I won't run, I want us to stay

[Chorus 2]
Right by your side, see that's where I'm gonna stay
For I am your man
Oh, yes, I am, little darling, little darling
I'm your man

[Verse 3]
My childish days are through
Wanna be someone you can look up to
Someone who can protect
Oh, someone who you can respect
Oh, I just wanna make myself worth it
Of the precious, precious love I know you be givin' me
Yeah, I want nothin' more for myself
Your love is my greatest wealth

[Chorus 3]
And when you take my hand
And when you take my hand
You will proudly say, "Oh, this is my man"
Oh, yes, I am, little darling, little darling
I'm your man
Oh, oh, oh, baby, baby, yeah, yeah
I'm your man, baby, oh, oh, oh
Oh, baby, baby
