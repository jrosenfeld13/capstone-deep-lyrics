[Chorus]
Young girl
Get out of my mind
My love for you is way out of line
Better run, girl
You're much too young, girl

[Verse 1]
With all the charms of a woman
You've kept the secret of your youth
You led me to believe you're old enough
To give me Love
And now it hurts to know the truth

[Chorus]
Whoa, oh, oh, young girl
Get out of my mind
My love for you is way out of line
Better run, girl
You're much too young, girl

[Verse 2]
Beneath your perfume and make-up
You're just a baby in disguise
And though you know that it's wrong to be
Alone with me
That come on look is in your eyes

[Chorus]
Whoa, oh, oh, young girl
Get out of my mind
My love for you is way out of line
Better run, girl
You're much too young, girl

[Verse 3]
So hurry home to your mama
I'm sure she wonders where you are
Get out of here before I have the time
To change my mind
Cause I'm afraid we'll go too far

[Chorus]
Whoa, oh, oh, young girl
Get out of my mind
My love for you is way out of line
Better run, girl
You're much too young, girl

Young girl
Get out of my mind
My love for you is way out of line
Better run, girl
You're much too young, girl

Young girl
Get out of my mind
My love for you
