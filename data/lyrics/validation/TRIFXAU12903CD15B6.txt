You take this sacredness for granted
Just to satisfy your love
Is this for real that I am stranded
On this edge of time

This is the end breaking down the ight maybe I'll surrender
Can this be real scattering above this is my life

You make a lie out of this damage
Closing everything between
And when you smile against the dark side
Visions of new dawn

This is the end far beyond the sun I will not surrender
Can this be real waiting in the night I feel se weak

Cause you might see victims of heavenly eyes
Building the power of love
When you have the answer you must be aware
Shadows are the cradle of love

Can make you chatter out of anger

Time has come and you must pay
The price I'd never thought you wanted
This is just for real

This is the end breaking down the ight maybe I'll surrender
Can this be real scattering above this is my life

Cause you might see victims of heavenly eyes
Building the power of love
When you have the answer you must be aware

This is the end far beyond the sun I will not surrender
Can this be real waiting in the night I feel se weak

Cause you might see victims of heavenly eyes
Building the power of love
When you have the answer you must be aware
Even though you....
Running from the cradle of love
