Mmmmm, oooooh
Baby girl, if you gonna move on that's fine
Before you leave let me put something on your mind
I never did wrong girl, I just made a mistake
I learned from my lesson
So now I gotta pay

I understand all that
You leaving and all that
Telling all your girls you hate me
And how you ain't coming back

But tell me something shortie
Do you still love me
Cause nowadays it ain't cool to stay
If a guy did you wrong

You don't wanna be nobody's fool
But if deep inside you still wanna hold on

Listen to ya heart, do what it say
If it's telling you to hold on
Don't let go, baby, listen to your heart
Let it lead the way, you just follow
I hear it saying, I hear it saying
You should be staying, you should be staying
Baby, listen to your heart and don't let go

Don't listen to them girls
They don't mean no good
Misery love company and if they could
Get with a dude like me you know that they would

Jump at a chance to get up, get up out the hood
But nevermind all that, they hating and all that
It's up to you if you're gonna decide to take me back
But it's no pressure, baby girl, I just want ya

Listen to ya heart, do what it say
If it's telling you to hold on
Don't let go, baby, listen to your heart
Let it lead the way, you just follow
I hear it saying, I hear it saying
You should be staying, you should be staying
Baby, listen to your heart and don't let go

Baby girl, I ain't trying to play with ya mind
Baby girl, I ain't trying to waste ya time
You welcome to leave, you welcome to stay
As long as you do what ya heart say
All you gotta do is think about it
Tic tock, think about it
Tick tock, keep thinking about it
Whatever it is I'll do it

As long as you

Listen to ya heart, do what it say
If it's telling you to hold on
Don't let go, baby, listen to your heart
Let it lead the way, you just follow
I hear it saying, I hear it saying
You should be staying, you should be staying
Baby, listen to your heart and don't let go
