Silver things, they've never been good to me
Oh silver please, you know you've never been good to me
And I could see, I'm understanding
And it's just I didn't want to travel alone that much

Simple things, they tend to mean a lot to me
And Busy? Please, you know some people are swamped
Those little things, yeah you should pay attention
Cuz busy? Please, Some people are swamped!

Tell me where the start is
You can tell me where you heart is
Tell me where you heart is, but don't say nothing

It's not for me, and I'm understanding
So speak up please, I don't want to be a stranger in the golden state
It's just I didn't want to travel alone that much
I didn't want to come back home and be alone
