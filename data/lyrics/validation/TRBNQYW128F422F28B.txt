[Verse 1]
I'm cutting through
You're bleeding out
And I would tell the truth, but I can't help myself
Red rushes out, dissect this nerve
And I'll stop myself before I reach my cell

[Chorus]
I wasn't asking for the world
And you know that I'm not one to follow through
All these city streets, the people look the same
And I can see your face and I can hear your name
I wasn't asking for the world

[Verse 2]
You're stabbing in
Permanent scars
And you'll justify it all inside yourself
You've finished me
My pulse is gone
And you're satisfied to put this all to hell

[Chorus]
I wasn't asking for the world
And you know that I'm not one to follow through
All these city streets, the people look the same
And I can see your face and I can hear your name
I wasn't asking for the world

[Bridge]
Drink the poison when you think it's over
Stabbing yourself, when you think it's too late
Tragic endings are your thing, you love them;
You love letting go. The ending's the same
Drink the poison when you think it's over
Inevitable, Verona lives inside of you

[Chorus]
I wasn't asking for the world
And you know that I'm not one to follow through
All these city streets, the people look the same
And I can see your face and I can hear your name
I wasn't asking for the world
