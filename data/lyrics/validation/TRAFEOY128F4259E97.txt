CHORUS
Out of my darkness Jesus' blood has won the fight
Into His likeness what a wonderful sight
Making my way into His kingdom so bright
Out of my darkness and into His light
REPEAT CHORUS
VS 1
Stumbling in darkness I was bound up in sin
Constantly losing the battle within
But what a great transformation Oh the glory did roll
On that wondrous day my name was added to the roll
CHORUS
VS 2
Long ago and far away a tomb was occupied
The victim of a cruel death was tightly sealed inside
But then the victim turned to victor when the stone was rolled away
He stepped outside the darkness died His light remains today
REPEAT CHORUS
