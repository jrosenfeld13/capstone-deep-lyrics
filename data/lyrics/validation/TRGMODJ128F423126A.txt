Ha, ha, ha, haa
There are times when you feel
That you don't know where you fit in
So, you hide what is real
Even when it hurts to pretend
To be the one that you think
Everybody wants you to be
No one sees
The one you really are
But you don't have to hide your heart
'Cause nothing needs to change
Sometimes it might seem hard
And your whole world falls apart
Just know that you when you feel that way
Even heaven cries, everybody cries
It's okay to doubt yourself sometimes
You don't have to be afraid of what you feel inside
It's alright 'cause even heaven cries
When you look in the mirror
And you don't see picture perfect
What they say breaks your heart
And makes you feel that you're not worth it
What if this fear hides in tears
Still play and make believe
So no one sees
The one you really are
But you don't have to hide your heart
'Cause nothing needs to end every way
Sometimes it might seem hard
Your whole world falls apart
Just know that you when you hear the rain
Even heaven cries everybody cries
It's okay to doubt yourself sometimes
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you feel inside
It's alright, it's alright
No you're not alone don't be ashamed
To let your feelings show, you should realize
You're special, who you are
In time you're gonna see, you're gonna see
Ha, ha, ha, haa
Don't you realize?
Even heaven cries everybody cries
It's okay to doubt yourself sometimes
You don't have to be afraid of what you feel inside
It's alright, it's alright
