You are the fire
And I'm the ice
Taht slowly melting
Under your eyes
And tough our time is running out
It's you
Burning in me
It's you
Struggle for pleasure

You take me higher
Hunger inside
To leave myself
And this foolish pride
And tough our time is running out
It's you
Burning in me
It's you
Struggle for pleasure

Life is dessire
Pumping your heart
Let me inspire
Your best by far
And tough our time is runningout
It's you
Burning in me
It's you
Struggle for pleasure

You are the fire
And I'm the ice
That slowly melting
Under your eyes
And tough oour time is running out
It's you
Burning in me
It's you
Struggle for pleasure
