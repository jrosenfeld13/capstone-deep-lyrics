Even though you're well intentioned
One or two or three things you mentioned
Leave a taste familiar to me so
Even with a slight sarcastic
A ripple in a voice elastic
I could crack the slightest code of woe

You look familiar, I know you
We've met before, is it not true?
I'm zero, don't waste words with me
Here's not the chamber for it

What do you mean?
Evil has never loved you
Evil has never loved you
Evil has never loved you as I do
What do you mean?
Nobody has ever loved you
Nobody has ever loved you
Nobody has ever loved you like I do

Find it at the further reaches
Smelling like a rose or peaches
Crippling the hardest pig nose shell
Find it when I look in your eyes
A little spark that would be kingsize
The mirror does no justice to your spell

You look familiar, I know you
We've met before, is it not true?
I'm zero, don't waste words with me
Here's not the chamber for it

What do you mean?
Evil has never loved you
Evil has never loved you
Evil has never loved you as I do
What do you mean?
Nobody has ever loved you
Nobody has ever loved you
Nobody has ever loved you like I do
