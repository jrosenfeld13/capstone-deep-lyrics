I stick to my ID
Its filling my veins
My life is an idea
Because I love my chains

You push your stone
You climb your hill
And then you're down again
You push your stone
You climb your hill
And then go down again

Out of it
Out of it

You push your stone
You climb your hill
And then you're down again
You push your stone
You climb your hill
And then go down again

Out of it
Out of it !
