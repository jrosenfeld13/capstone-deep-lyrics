Say your prayers, it's not fuckin' late
Say your prayers, we can't let them mate
Under God, 'cause that is a sin
Say your prayers, human and human

The weak won again, and killed their happy day

Son, what happened to them
You're upset, it's out of your hands
When your God has left you stranded
Argument? Human and human

The weak won again, and killed their happy day
The weak won again, and killed their happy day

Man you've got to wake up
Fuck, you've got to wake up friends
Why can't you see that, that a man can love a man
We've got to wake up
Fuck, you've got to wake up friends
Why can't you see that, that woman can love woman

So go see it for yourself
I'll bet you'll be amazed at what the hell is wrong with you
Start saving up your fuckin' prayers
Start saving up your fuckin' prayers
Start saving up your fuckin' prayers for you!
Human, human, human, human
Human and human
