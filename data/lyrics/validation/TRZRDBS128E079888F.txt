[Verse 1]
Life is hard
And so am I
You'd better give me something
So I don't die

[Chorus 1]
Novocaine for the soul
Before I sputter out
Before I sputter out

[Verse 2]
Life is white
And I am black
Jesus and his lawyer
Are coming back

[Chorus 2]
Oh my darling
Will you be here
Before I sputter out
Before I sputter out
Before I sputter out

[Bridge]
Guess who's living here with the great undead?
This paint by numbers life is fucking with my head, once again

[Verse 3]
Life is good
And I feel great
Cause mother says I was
A great mistake

[Chorus 3]
Novocaine for the soul
You'd better give me something to fill the hole
Before I sputter out
Before I sputter out
Before I sputter out
Before I sputter out
