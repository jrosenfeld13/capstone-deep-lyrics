(Bators - Secich)
This is the last year of my life
Can't seem to do much more than i've done
Gone and used up all the fun
And the alternative is none
This is the first time i've realized
I loved believing all your lies
And didn't mind it when you cried
I plan on living just to die
This is the final year
I'm living out the very last year
The end is flashing on the screen
I'm living in the last year of my life
