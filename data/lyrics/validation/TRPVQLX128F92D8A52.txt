[Intro]
This is the turn around moment
I'm grown now, you zimme?
Zeph Ellis
Check it, yo

[Verse]
I've been influencing way before you was a tadpole
Young black yout from South West, with a mad flow
16, I was up in Reading giving cats snow
And now I'm in the studio, tryna make these tracks blow
Done my dirt on these roads, and I've seen a load of drama
Now I'm making tracks getting spun on radio by Logan Sama
Niggas hate when I jump on the mic and say the facts
I just made Acid Bomb, that track just bought Kano back
Renting out apartments just so you can stunt in your vids
Got these lighties upset, when they come to your crib
For me it's never been an image ting
Brudda, it's a cold world that we're living in
Tell me take my chain off, no, I ain't giving in
Nigga put his hands on my fam, then I'm killing him
'Cause I grew up on them estates where gangs roll
I'm waiting for my brudda F.A to land road
Skrr-ing through the city in a Add Lee
Chilling with a bad b, in the back seat smoking mad weed
Give a pinky to the driver in the taxi
Walk into the bar with my wife and order some brandy
She just wanna chill, smoke some weed and eat some healthy food
Plan our future, she supports me plus we're getting wealthy too
I tell her "Babes, just have faith in me"
She say "I don't care where you're taking me, as long as I'm with you there's a purpose in my day for me"
I swear if I was a God she would follow plus pray to me
Uh
Behind every successful man is strong woman
These Instagram bitches weak plus I'm not looking
These road rappers got these niggas so gassed
Buying clothes for the vid, then bringing the clothes back
What's the problem with your yard?
Show 'em that you own that
Renting cars for the vid, show 'em that you loaned that
I don't care what he says
Stunting with medallions, with Medusa heads on, that you got from eBay
Man said it's three bills
Man said it's four bills
Man said it's five bills
What does the receipt say?
Niggas need to holla me for beats so they can get writing
Money up front, for a track fam it's Z prices
For a session it's a Q to hit the microphone
That's the engineer and you in studes to write alone
Doubling my stacks, yeah I'm hustling this cash
Hollering your manager like "Where's my money? Bring it back"
No one wants to pay when they owe you shit
To you in the face, swammy'ed up, ready to unload at him
My brudda's'll popcorn
Nuttin' like the Odeon
Buss case, and swear they didn't do it on the podium
Salute a real G when I pass tru
Minarmy the army, if someone's standing next to me they're hard too
Found myself a younger and I showed him how to bar too
Over 50,000 plays on Soundcloud on our last tune
I can see competitors, they're plotting on our last moves
While girls be screaming "Let me heal you" shouting out Jamal Woon
Uh, that's my brother from another mother
And I just lost a brother from another mother
So shout my brudda Nash Nine Lives
RIP, I wish I could bring you back nine times my G
Before the interview with Posty there was hella hating
I was sitting down contemplating me and Melanation
Spent a year in country segregated, meditating with some vegetation
Now I'm back to give 'em hella statements

[Outro]
Everything's good man
Looking around me I feel good
The team is strong
Trust me
And for everyone listening don't be chasing all the money and cars and all of those things
Everything starts with love
Feel me?
My love for music kept me here, that's why you're listening
