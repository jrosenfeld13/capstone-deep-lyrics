My body's 21 but my mind is ageless
My memory is M.I.A
Livin' overdrive to the point of excess
Wake up in the evening use the night as day
Stopped lookin for the people that are gonna save me
You can still try
Living like a woman since i was a baby
And everyone i know has told me a lie

My body's 21 but my mind is ageless
(Livin' overdrive)
Livin' overdrive to the point of excess
(if your future is now you better make it last)

First it was my legs
Now my heart is open
All of it was D.I.Y
I still wanna play but I'm sick of the gropin'
And if were gonna meet I'll look in you in the eye
I might of made mistakes but I call it learnin'
You can call it what you will
If I had a candle and it was burnin'
It would be from one end that's enough of a thrill

My body's 21 but my mind is ageless
(they wanna dumb you down)
They're telling everyone that they're gonna save us
(youre future is now you can forget the past)
My body's 21 but my mind is ageless
(Livin overdrive)
Livin' overdrive to the point of excess
(if your future is now you better make it last)

They're tellin all of us that we're gonna make it
But they don't tell us how
Even when I'm living I feel like I fake it
All the rules I been taught I'm gonna disavow

My body's 21 but my mind is ageless
(they wanna dumb you down)
They're telling everyone that they're gonna save us
(if your future is now you can forget the past)
My body's 21 but my mind is ageless
(Livin overdrive)
Livin' overdrive to the point of excess
(if your future is now you better make it last)
My body's 21 but my mind is ageless
