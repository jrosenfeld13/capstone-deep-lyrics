I can smell something burning
There's a breeze somewhere on main
The flyers begin to pile up
And my jacket has a stain

It don't mean anything to me
But it might mean something to you
I have a feeling that it means something to you

They're not trying to impress us
See how they walk around
They got dirty jeans and greasy hair
And a heavy metal sound
It don't mean anything to me
But it might mean something to you
I have this feeling that it means something to you

Meet on the corner
Down on 7th avenue
Make sure you keep your hat on
And worn out high heel shoes

It don't mean anything to me
But it might mean something to you
I have this feeling that it means something to you
