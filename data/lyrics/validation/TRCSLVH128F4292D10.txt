I don't stay out all night
I don't close down the bars
And i don't make a fool of myself
Well, i don't drink too much
And i don't get too loud
And i don't ever raise too much hell

But there's a first time for everything
Since you said goodbye
There's not much of anything
That i haven't tried
To somehow get over you
There's no tellin' what i might do
'cause if i've learned anything
There's a first time for everything

I don't call up old flames
'cause i don't have a blackbook
I don't spend all my time in the past
I don't wake up with strangers
'cause i don't sleep around
No i don't believe in love that won't last

But there's a first time for everything
Since you said goodbye
There's not much of anything
That i haven't tried
To somehow get over you
There's no tellin' what i might do
'cause if i've learned anything
There's a first time for everything

Yeah yeah

When i somehow get over you
There's no tellin' what i might do
'cause if i've learned anything
There's a first time for everything

Yeah yeah
'cause if i've learned anything
There's a first time for everything
Yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
