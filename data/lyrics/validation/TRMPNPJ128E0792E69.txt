When I first met you I thought
I ain't searching any more
'Cause we've got everything
I've been looking for
And now I'm not so sure
I can be who you want
There'll always be a part of me
Wondering

I'm just a lost soul looking for my home
I'm just a lost soul looking for my home

When I learnt that you had gone
For a week I carried on
Until the truth that dawn dawned on me
Hit me like a stone
And it's taken me so long
To know where I went wrong
You always make the same mistakes
Until you learn

I'm just a lost soul looking for my home
I'm just a lost soul looking for my home
