Your back's against the wall
There's no one home to call
You're forgetting who you are
You can't stop crying
It's part not giving in
Part trusting your friends
You do it all again and I'm not lying

Oh oh oh
Standing in the way of control
Yeah live your lives
By the only way that you know, know

I'm doing this for you
Because it's easier to lose
And it's hard to face the truth
When you think you're dying
It's part not giving in
And part trusting your friends
You do it all again but you don't stop trying

Oh oh oh
Standing in the way of control
Yeah live your lives
By the only way that you know, know

Oh oh oh
Standing in the way of control
We'll live our lives
Because we're standing in the way of control
We will live our lives
Because we're standing in the way of control
We'll live our lives
Because we're standing in the way of control
We will live our lives, lives, lives

Your back's against the wall
There's no one home to call
You're forgetting who you are
You can't stop crying
It's part not giving in
And part trusting your friends
You do it all again, you don't stop trying

Oh oh oh
Standing in the way of control
Yeah live your lives
By the only way that you know, know
