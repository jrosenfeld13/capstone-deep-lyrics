FOREVER OF THE STARS:
There is danger ahead. But do not be afraid. For I am with you
Like breath itself. Darkness will lead to light. Colour will bleed
Into the night. Beautiful colours, the like of which you have never
Seen. Let the dream of confusion lead you into the virgin light!
Be gone! Be all seeing, be brave... Be gone!

(A. Amazing Flight In Space)

BARBARIAN:
I'm looking 'round bewildered
Is this some dark and evil jest?
What brought me to this cursed keep?
Perchance some crazy quest?
Gods forbid I am no coward!
Pitted against a monster, man, or ghost
I'd wield my blade with crimson gusto
For I am the proud barbarian host!

HIPPIE:
Hey dude, you're so uncool!
But hey, that's alright...
Like, there's no need to get uptight
My eyes reflect the stars
And a smile lights up my face
We're on an amazing flight in space!

BARBARIAN:
I shook city walls and towers!
Wreaking havoc in the streets
Burned palaces of cowardly kings
Not a one stood up to me... fools
Bear bloody banners in blazing skies!
Brandish battle axe and broadsword!
Let drums of glory sound like thunder!
Hail Barbaric Warlord!!

HIPPIE:
Hey dude, you're so uncool!
But hey, that's alright...
Like, there's no need to get uptight
My eyes reflect the stars
And a smile lights up my face
We're on an amazing flight in space!

BARBARIAN:
I load my black stallion
With grim determination
I found a kingdom
Where I chose to settle down
Righteous men would hang me
But I've given hell to pay
Cause nothing is as dangerous
As a barbarian warlord

I trained some of the minstrel men
I laid this place aspears
For a barbarian warlord...
