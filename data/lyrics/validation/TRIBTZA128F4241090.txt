Island lady
Won't you stay
I will bring you
Baskets of flowers
Every day
Until the pain is gone
Island lady
How long has it been?
Over a year
Won't you let me
Open up your door?
Island lady
Hear my words
All the battles
Are somebody else's
For a while
Won't you please come down?
On a corner
A beggar with his cup
Says he has visions
And God appears before him
Only in the form of bread
Won't you let me
Open up your door?
Island lady
When you smile
All the battles
Can wait 'till tomorrow
For a while
Can we please touch smiles
Touch each other's smiles?
In the park
A girl in an army shirt
With long hair
And white smiles
Says between visions
That God is the grass
Won't you let me
Open up your door?
Island lady
Here's my bed
Can I lie
Beside and around you
'Till you smile
Until the pain is gone?
Island lady
God appears often
And if he were lies
I'd promise you beautiful lies
You could live in
Won't you let me
Open up your door?
Island lady
Won't you stay
I will bring you
Baskets of flowers
In my way
Until the pain is gone
