The judge said "Screw 'em!
Boys, you're only human
They brought it on themselves
By being born a woman
Like a mountain's there to climb
And food's there to be eaten
Woman's there to rape
To be shoved around and beaten."

Chorus:
The judge took his position
The judge he wouldn't budge
So we've got out this petition
And we're going to screw the judge

Now if you beat a horse or dog
Or violate a bank
Simonson will haul you in
And throw you in the clink
But violate a woman
Your equal and your peer
The judge will slap you on the wrist
And lay the blame on her

(Chorus)
To draw a true conclusion
From what Simonson has said
Woman has to live in fear
And cover up her head
She has to dress in purdah
And lock herself in cages
And this kinky judge in Madison
Is from the Middle Ages

The judge took his position
The judge he wouldn't budge
So we've got out this petition
And we're going to dump the judge
