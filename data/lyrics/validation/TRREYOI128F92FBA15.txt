I found a better life in Your arms
And now I'm movin' on with a brand new start
Nothing can stop what's started in my heart
Oh, I'm glad Your love came my way

I never want to be alone again
Here's my declaration of dependence
Without Your love I ain't got a chance
Yeah, Your love is life to me

Love's taken over, I found a better life in Your arms
Your love's taken over, I'm movin' on with a brand new start
Love's taken over, nothing can stop what's started in my heart
Love's taken over, I found a better life in Your arms

I'm movin' on, gonna scale these walls
I'm pressin' on now with a full assault
Nothin' can stop what's stirrin' in my heart
I've got a fever for life again

Love's taken over, I found a better life in Your arms
Your love's taken over, I'm movin' on with a brand new start
Love's taken over, nothing can stop what's started in my heart
Love's taken over, I found a better life in Your arms

Love's taken over, I found a better life in Your arms
Your love's taken over, I'm movin' on with a brand new start
Love's taken over, nothing can stop what's started in my heart
Love's taken over, I found a better life in Your arms

I found a better life in Your arms
I'm movin' on with a brand new start
Nothing can stop what's started in my heart
I found a better life in Your arms
