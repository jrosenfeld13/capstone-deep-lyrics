Hello little girl
Hello little girl
Hello little girl

When I see you everyday
I say: mm mm hello little girl
When you're passing on your way
I say: mm mm hello little girl
When I see you passing by
I cry mm mm hello little girl
When I try to catch your eye
I cry mm mm hello little girl

I send you flowers
But you don't care
You never seem to see
Me standing there
I often wonder
What you're thinking of
I hope it's me
And love love love

So I hope there'll come a day
When you'll say: mm you're my little girl

It's not the first time
That it's happened to me
It's been a long lonely time
And it's funny funny to see
That I'm about to lose my mi-mi-ind

So I hope there'll come a day
When you say: mm mm
You're my little girl, mm mm mm
You're my little girl, mm mm mm
You're my little girl, oh yeah
You're my little girl
