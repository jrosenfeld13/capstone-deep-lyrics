Been working all day
Like I'm doing time
The foreman say you
Got to do some overtime

Mister foreman, got to tell you
I can't wait until noon
Cause I got to get on home
To my love bones

I know my baby's waiting
Cause she's anticipating
I'm gonna be connected so
Our love can be protected

(Going home to get my love bone)
Going home and get my love bone
(Going home to get my love bone)
I'm going home, right or wrong
(Going home to get my love bone)
(If I were you, I'd check mine too)

Mister foreman seem so dumb
He's just sitting there
I think you better cut
Out on this overtime

Now, overtime might help
To make the money grow
But it gives me neighbor time
To steal my love bone

I know my baby's waiting
She's anticipating
I'm gonna be connected so
Our love can be protected

(Going home to get my love bone)
I'm going home and get my love bone
(Going home to get my love bone)
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
(If I were you, I'd check mine too)

Hey, hey, get it
Get it, get on home

You're gone ??
Oh, a man is a fool to be

Get it, alright
Get it, you better check
It out now, baby

(Going home to get my love bone)
Going home and get my love bone
(Going home and check my love bone)
(Going home to get my love bone)
(If I were you, I'd check mine too)

Mister foreman, I think we
Better make a compromise
If you keep me any longer
It won't be too wise

My baby thinks I'm
Fooling with another ?
Now fire me if you wanna
Cause I'm going home

I know my baby's waiting
Cause he's anticipating
I'm gonna be connected so
Our love can be protected

Going home, get my love bones
If I were you, I'd check my love bone
I'm going home and get my love bone
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Going on home
You take like James Brown
You better check on your love bone
And you, Wilson Pickett
You better get on the telephone
And check at home

I remember that number you
Gave me that time 634-5789
Youbetter call it right now
And check on your love bone

Tyrone Davis
You better check on your love bone
Tell em JT told you
You better check on your love bone
