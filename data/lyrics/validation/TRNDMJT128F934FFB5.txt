You jumped a little too late
You jumped a little too late
You jumped a little too late
And I'm afraid for you

You jumped a little too late
You jumped a little too late
You jumped a little too late
And I'm afraid for you

For every song that the birds don't sing
For every little glitter that they don't bring
It'll be older and a little less wise

I'm afraid for you
'Cos you don't care
I'm afraid for you
'Cos you don't care
I'm afraid for you
'Cos you don't care
I'm afraid for you
'Cos you don't care

You jumped a little too late
You jumped a little too late
You jumped a little too late
And I'm afraid for you

You jumped a little too late
You jumped a little too late
You jumped a little too late
And I'm afraid for you

For every song that the birds don't sing
For every little glitter that they don't bring
It'll be older and a little less wise
For every song that the birds don't sing
For every little glitter that they don't bring
It'll be older and a little less wise

You jumped a little too late
You jumped a little too late
You jumped a little too late
And I'm afraid for you

I'm afraid for you
I'm afraid for you
'Cos you don't care if they thrash you hard

I'm afraid for you
I'm afraid for you
'Cos you don't care if they thrash you hard
