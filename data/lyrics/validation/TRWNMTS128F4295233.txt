[Pre-Chorus]
Sing about that, oh love it's a brittle madness
I sing about it in all my sadness
Not falsified to say that I found God so
Inevitably well it still exists, pale and fine I can't dismiss
And I won't resist and if I die well at least I tried


[Chorus]
And we just lay awake in lust and rust in the rain
And ponder on everything we say, "We trust"
Well it happened again, I listened in through hallways and thin doors
Where the rivers unwind, rust and the rain endure
The rust and the rain so thin
Well I'm in like Flynn again
I'm in


[Verse 1]
So go on place your order now
Cause some other time is right around the clock
You can stand in line well it finally begins oh just around the block
You can have your pick if your stomach is sick, whether you eat or not
And there is just one thing that I almost forgot


[Verse 2]
Oh, see, you and me, we lay awake in lust and rust in the rain
And ponder on everything we say, "We trust"
Well it happened again, I listened in through hallways and thin doors
Where the rivers unwind, the rivers unwind so easy
Oh, these are the comforts that be


[Verse 3]
You see, well, I'm feeling' lucky oh well, maybe that's just me
Well you'd be proud of me oh well, if you could only see
How we're gonna grown up to be
Ah yes, we are thick as thieves


[Pre-Chorus]


[Chorus]


[Verse 4]
Because I'm in so far to know, the measure of love ain't lost
Love will never, ever be
In so far to know, the measure of love ain't lost
Love will never, ever be
In so far to know, the measure of love ain't lost
Love will never, ever be lost on me


[Outro]
Oh not tonight, said, "Love will never ever be lost on me"
Love will never ever be lost on me
Love will not be
Love will never be lost on me
Love will not be lost on me
