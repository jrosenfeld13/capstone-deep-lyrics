I wait for you in Heaven
On this perfect string of love
And drink your soup of magpies
In a pottery bowl that looks as I am now
Brown and round and warm

Chime on the rain
Wet an ankle, toes or two
Sweetly as it drops upon your head
Just like it did today
Fortunately gone
Ba-ba-ba-ba
I wait for you

Chime on rain
Wet an ankle, toes or two
Sweetly as it drops upon your head
Just like it did today
Fortunately gone
Ba-ba-ba-ba
I wait for you

Fortunately gone
Ba-ba-ba-ba
I wait for you
