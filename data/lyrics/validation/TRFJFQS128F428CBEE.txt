[Intro]

Um hmm thats right uh huh uh huh
Um hmm thats right uh huh uh huh

[Verse 1]

Walking down the street
Something caught my eye
A growing epidemic that really ain't fly
A middle aged lady
I gotta be blunt
Her spandex biker shorts were creepin up the front

I could see her uterus her pants were too tight
She must'nt own panties that were not in sight she walked right by the poor woman didn't know
She had a frontal wedgie
A Camel Toe

[Chorus]

Um hmm thats right uh huh
Oh no
Fix yourself girl
You got a
Camel Toe
Um hmm thats right uh huh
Oh no
Fix yourself girl
You got a
Camel Toe

[Verse 2]

Girl thats gotta hurt
Take some time and adjust can't you see people staring
And making a fuss
Could not believe my eyes had to take a second glance
Is your crotch hungry girl
Cause its eating your pants
Do you enjoy the comotion and attenetion it brings
The only lips i wanna see are the ones that sing
In public putting on an x rated show grossin' people out
With your Camel Toe

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 3]

First day of spring and by the looks of things these girls have forgot how to dress
A little quick to wearin
Pum pum shorts
And its causin me much distress
Whoomp there it is
Yeha right in the front
Everybody come and get a good look
I can see everything through the panty cling every cranny
And every nook
You better take a quick minute
Before you step outside
And check the area thats pubic
Or you'll get your panties all up in a bunch all twisted up
Like rubic
Take these words of advice
Cause its not very nice
I wanna put you al in the know
Girls don't sleep
Don't let your pants creep
Watch out for
The Camel Toe

[Repeat Chorus]
