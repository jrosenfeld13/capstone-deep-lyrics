Who's that stomping all over my face
Where's that silhouette I'm trying to trace
Who's putting sponge in the bells I once rung
And taking my gypsy before she's begun

To sing in the meaning of what's in my mind
Before I can take home what's rightfully mine
Joining and a-listening and talking in rhymes
Stopping the feeling to wait for the time

Who's saying baby, that don't mean a thing
'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing

And who's all hung up on that happiness thing
Who's trying to tune all the bells that he rings
And who's in the corner and down on the floor
With pencil and paper just counting the score

Who's trying to act like he's just in-between
The line isn't black if you know that it's green
Don't bother looking, you're too blind to see
Who's coming on like he wanted to be

Who's saying baby, that don't mean a thing
'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing

And who's coming home on the old nine-to-five
Who's got the feeling to keep him alive
Though having it, sharing it ain't quite the same
It ain't a gold nugget, you can't lay a claim

Who's seeing eyes through the crack in the floor
There it is, baby, don't you worry no more
Who should be sleeping, but is writing this song
Wishing and a-hoping he weren't so damned wrong

Who's saying baby, that don't mean a thing
'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing

Who's saying baby, that don't mean a thing
'Cause nowadays Clancy can't even sing
