I broke though the stitches
Of your wounded heart
And ruined the sketches
For our brand new start

So this is where I ended up
(a loveless place)
'cause I never know when to stop
(came face to face)
With a liar's grace

I broke all the mirrors
To keep you at bay
A brutal reminder
No matter what you say

So this is where I ended up
(a loveless place)
'cause I never know when to stop
(came face to face)
With a liar's grace
