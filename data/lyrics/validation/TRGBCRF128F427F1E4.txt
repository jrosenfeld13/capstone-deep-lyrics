I wonder why, why stars collide
Why she's there, why she's there with you
I made a wish that she'd be mine
But she's there but she's there with you
I saw my face, taking your place
But she never knew
What I'd felt what I'd do for...
For two whole nights she was in sight
I had my chance, had my chance with her
But wishing's not enough so I
I missed my chance, missed my chance with her
Please don't tell her, that I miss her
I'm not really sure, If she'd even recall my name
