What you don't understand
Is where everything's leading
When all of the signs you see still point to overload
As you reach out your hand
A shattered vision's receding
Like daylights along that lonesome stretch of broken road

'Cause you've been to the past
And it's just a reminder
A recollection of faces that will never come to call
When you've cut through the mask
When you've been through the grinder
Sometimes you forget that you had ever been there at all

Up here in Room 429
The world ain't so unkind
I wanna take you to that empty room tonight

In the shadow of doubt
In the crush of an instant
Standing in the rain outside your door, hand on my knife
When you reach a brick wall
There is still a decision
Always thought if I had to lose I'd surely take you all

Up here in Room 429
In a world that's so unkind
I wanna take you to that empty room tonight
We'll tell the world outside the door
That we ain't never coming back no more
We're gonna stay in here 'till we turn out the night

The city breathes so softly
Everything is sleeping
I am at the window silently watching
I can see you standing
Alone against the winter
I can hear you asking, but the streets, they are not giving
Don't look to the ocean
Restless in its dreaming
Don't look to the heavens for they will tell you nothing
If living is for learning
Then dying is forgetting
Once we have forgotten then we can go on loving

In a lifetime of hope
In a second of kindness
There is never a doubt that we are born and die alone
From within or without
There's no way they can find us
When they knock at the door, the lights are on, but we ain't home

Up here in Room 429
The world ain't so unkind
I wanna take you to that empty room tonight
We'll tell the world outside the door
That we ain't never coming back no more
We're gonna stay in here 'till we turn out the night
