(G. Feldhausen)

It was one those nights I'd better turned off the light
But I'd been out drinking with the boys
Then I saw that woman like a superstar she's coming
As I saw that face it was too late

(Chorus:)
She's coming over top, coming over top
And she don't wanna stop, don't wanna stop
Oh yea she's coming over top, coming over top
And she won't give it up, don't give it up
Oh yea she's coming over top

After 2 a.m. when I was drinking again
I fell head over heels in love
She was looking in my eyes
And I couldn't tell her lies
When she took me upstairs for a ride

(Chorus:)
She's coming over top, coming over top
And she don't wanna stop, don't wanna stop
Oh yea she's coming over top, coming over top
And she won't give it up, don't give it up
Oh yea she's coming over top

It was a long wild night and I held her tight
And I told her not to go away
I saw you in the stars wanna paint you on my arm
And I'm ready for the price I have to pay

(Chorus:)
She's coming over top, coming over top
And she don't wanna stop, don't wanna stop
Oh yea she's coming over top, coming over top
And she won't give it up, don't give it up
Oh yea she's coming over top
