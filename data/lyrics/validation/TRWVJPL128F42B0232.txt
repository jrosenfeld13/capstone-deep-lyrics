Love is a burning thing
And it makes a firery ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell in to a ring of fire...
I fell in to a burning ring of fire
I went down,down,down
And the flames went higher
And it burns,burns,burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like our's meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild..
I fell in to a burning ring of fire
I went down,down,down
And the flames went higher
And it burns,burns,burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
I fell in to a burning ring of fire
I went down,down,down
And the flames went higher
And it burns,burns,burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
I fell in to a burning ring of fire
I went down,down,down
And the flames went higher
And it burns,burns,burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
