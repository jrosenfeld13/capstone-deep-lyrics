On a summer day you can hear her call
But in a funny way she reminds you of the fall
On a summer day you can hear her call
But in a funny way she reminds you of the fall

Thru the fields an the streams an the lakes an the trees
An the grass an the logs run all my dogs
And I am home again

In the autumn air
You can see her smile
But in a funny way she reminds you of a child

In the autumn air
You feel her soul unfold
And in a funny way you feel your own explode

Thru the fields an the streams an the lakes an the trees
An the grass an the logs run all my dogs
And I am home again

Ahhhh Ahhhh
Ahhhh Ahhhh

On a winter day
You can hear her call
But in a funny way when the snow begins to fall

On a winter day
You can hear her call
And in a funny way
You love her even more

Thru the fields an the streams an the lakes an the trees
An the grass an the logs run all my dogs
And I am home again

Thru the fields an the streams an the lakes an the trees
An the grass an the logs run all my dogs
And I am home again

On a summer day you can hear her call
But in a funny way she reminds you of the fall
On a summer day you can hear her call
But in a funny way she reminds you of the fall
