Can I have a moment of your time
And leave this far behind
Can you find the time to take a chance
Just walk with me tonight

Even though the rain must fall
Baby that will pass
Listen to the words I say
I've saved them just for you

You're safe with me tonight
And Always
As sure as this full moon
And Always

Lets sit around and shed those lonely tears
While days turn into years

Even though the rain must fall
Baby that will pass
Listen to the words I say
I've saved them just for you

You're safe with me tonight
And Always
As sure as this full moon
And Always

Nothing lasts not the good times or the bad
They all just become the past
Sometimes your heart can turn on dime
What made you cry will one day make you smile

You're safe with me tonight
And Always
As sure as this full moon
You're safe with me tonight
And Always
