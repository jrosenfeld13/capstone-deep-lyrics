Electric hearts don't torture dear
I was getting better
I was getting better you know
My heart's not in control

Fire, fire, fire the door today
I was getting better
I was getting better you know
My outside's in control

If we can't set fire to anything
Then what's the point in being scared
If we can't set fire to anything
Then what's the point in being scared
If we can't set fire, you can't set fire
If we can't set fire, you can't set fire to me

I heard the end, today you go
I've already set goodbye
And know that life was taking it's toll
When there's nothing left you know

I thought the night had slept with day
I'm a thousand miles away
And didn't know for days i'm cold
My outside's in control

If we can't set fire to anything...

So we'll hide this holiday
And wait here on my own
With the kids in Montreal
'Cause that's the place to go
Have you ever escaped
From your conscious and your thoughts
I was trying to do this on my own

If we can't set fire to anything...
