[Verse 1]
You are the daughters of sorrow
And somehow I just know
I'm gonna have to hang around you

[Non-Lyrical Chorus]
(Bom bom bom bom bah)
(Bom bom bom bom bah)
(Bom bom bom bom bah)

[Verse 2]
We walk through the world
As if by starlight
We've been alright
We'll kick 'em

[Non-Lyrical Chorus]
(Bom bom bom bom bah)
(Bom bom bom bom bah)
(Bom bom bom bom bah)

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
You are the daughters of sorrow
And somehow I just know
And somehow I just knew!

[Non-Lyrical Chorus]
(Bom bom bah)
Somehow I just knew
(Bom bom bom bom bah)
Somehow I just knew
(Bom bom bom bom bah)
And somehow I just knew

[Outro]
(Bom bom bom bah bah)
Bom bom bom bom bah
Bom bom bom bom bah
Bom bom bom bom bah
Bom bom bom bom bah
