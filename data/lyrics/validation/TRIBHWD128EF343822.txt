Way down south, way down in the winter
Frost on the mouth, frost on the river

Is there any love on the harbour?
Is there any love, is there any love
Is there any love on the harbour?
Is there any love, is there any love?

Bay in the sun, stall from the shiver
Run just for fun, run like a winner

Is there any love on the harbour?
Is there any love, is there any love
Is there any love on the harbour?
Is there any love, is there any love?

Lost to the swell, stand and deliver
My coins in the well, arrows in my quiver

Is there any love on the harbour?
Is there any love, is there any love
Is there any love on the harbour?
Is there any love, is there any love?

Half ounce of lead, sunk to the bottom
I pray to the dead that love's not forgotten

Is there any love on the harbour?
Is there any love, is there any love
Is there any love on the harbour?
Is there any love, is there any love?
