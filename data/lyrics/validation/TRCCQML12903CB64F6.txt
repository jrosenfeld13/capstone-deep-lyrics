When I wake up in the morning
Feel the sun shine on my face
I get up and I'm yawning
There is so much time I can waste

'Cause I need this
God feed me with your love
And take me through the day

Fool me into believing
I don't care if you're deceiving me
I wouldn't want it any other way
'Cause then I'd only stay the same

Fool me into believing
I don't care if your deceiving me

When I wake up in the dawning
And the day is not far away
Find my way in a dark room
That my eyes fail to see through

If God made me
Will Jesus save me?
And take me through the day

Fool me into believing
I don't care if you're deceiving me
I wouldn't want it any other way
'Cause then I'd only stay the same

Fool me into believing
I don't care if your deceiving me
Before I go I need to be
Something more than the skin and bones you see

'Cause everywhere I go
Everywhere I've been
And everywhere I'm going to
I only go with you
