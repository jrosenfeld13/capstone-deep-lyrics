[Verse 1: Rell]
Started out a boy that didn't know the game
But some many years I remained same
Use to be a love maker, heart breaker, major part player
Never thought that my heart ever change
Since then I have grown to know this much
What it really means to fall in love
But I don't know how I know I just know
Baby you're the one for me

[Chorus: Rell & Tweet]
Could it be (could it be)
That I'm falling in love with you
Tired of the same old thing and playing all same old games
And if I could trade one thing, all in the exchange for you
Boy I give anything, anything

[Verse 2: Tweet]
As a little I was taught I was trained
Never trust in a man, cause they all remain the same
But you came along and you brought out a little woman in me
And it's all in the things you do yea
Never thought I be here with thought of loving you
But I claim it and name it
Baby your the reason I want a love brand new

[Chorus: Tweet & Rell]
Could it be (could it be)
That I'm falling in love with you
Tired of the same old thing (the same old thing)
And playing all same old games
And if I could trade one thing, all in the exchange for you
Girl I give anything, I give anything that I have for you

[Bridge: Tweet & Rell]
See I never had someone to hold me quit this close
And out of everyone of everyone I ever wanted
Seems that I want you the most
I can't deny you got me so high
I can't come down

[Chorus: Rell & Tweet]
Could it be (could it be)
That I'm falling in love with you
Tired of the same old thing (the same old thing)
And playing all same old games
And if I could trade one thing, all in the exchange for you
Boy I give anything, anything

[Chorus: Tweet & Rell]
Could it be (could it be)
That I'm falling in love with you
Tired of the same old thing (the same old thing)
And playing all same old games
And if I could trade one thing, all in the exchange for you
Girl I give anything, I give anything that I have for you
