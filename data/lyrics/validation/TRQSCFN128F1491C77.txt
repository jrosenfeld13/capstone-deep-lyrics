Please don't you do it to me no more
And don't you do it to me
I wouldn't do it to you And don't you do it to me

The feelings on it as I lie sleeping
With burning desire
Trying to be nice, all in keeping
Lighting up my fire

Oh she's so professional
She's so professional
She's just as cool as ice, and every time she smiles
She is so professional, so professional

She's so professional
Mmm, she takes it cool as ice Every time she smiles
You know her smiles are nice She needs a confidante
You tell her you're the one
With the mouth that smiles
And then she has to leave
Never satisfied, as I light up my fire

She is, so professional, so professional

Wouldn't do it to you, so don't you do it to me
Mmm, playing with me like you do, it's okay
Oh, you only want me when you want to, but it's alright
About time I got an answer I'll pay
Now I finally finally lost my reason, tonight

I wouldn't do it to you, so why you do it to me?
I wouldn't do it to you

Paying the price, and love is cheaper
I'm not the only buyer
Sugar and spice a choice of sweetenin'
Tasten' to acquire

Oh she's so professional, so professional
She takes a change of grace, it's just a change of way
She is, she she Mm

Playing with me like you do, it's okay
Oh you only want me when you want to, but it's alright
Mm now, mm now, about time I got my answer I pay
Now I finally finally lost my reason, tonight

Mm, I wouldn't do it
You twist me this way and that way, and I don't know
Which way that you want me go
Come on babe what you want me to do
Come on baby don't you be untrue, yeah
