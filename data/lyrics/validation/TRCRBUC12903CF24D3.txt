We are the nothing grating against the norm
We are the something that will not conform
No one understands what we've been given

We are the useless by-products of soulless meat
We are all gone we all sing the same tragedy

Open wide and eat the worms of the enemy
We are the enemies of reality, in a world that's unforgiving

Waiting to sanitize bastard tongues
To purify the ignorance that hides the sun
The less you understand the more you're driven

Packaged and processed the masses are force fed
The standards they judge us on swallow the rot we shed

Open wide and eat the worms of the enemy
We are the enemies of reality, in a world that's unforgiving

Breathing dust and decay while I'm sipping
Human trust and betrayal
Losing faith once again
Take my hand my friend, my foe, I am enemy

Open wide and eat the worms of the enemy
We are the enemies of reality, in a world that's unforgiving
Open wide, eat the words, become what you most fear
