She's the reason for the inch that I steal
To see through the glass and watch her reveal
The smile that she wears
To see another man who don't see it

I trip but stand for another 5 seconds
To see the smile she wears
To hide her unseen intentions
But I'm wise to it
If only you knew that you walk through my mind each night

I can see from the smile that you wear, you're a star and I'm making sure of it
I can see from your innocent way, you're a queen and nobody knows it

You see everyone else but they don't see you
And whatever I say I do
I'm a shadow for you

Shadow

She walks in the rain so you don't see her cry
She's a fool of a woman and I'll tell you why
If you just look behind you, you see me lying beside you

Month or so passed and I returned to the store
Her eyes look as sad as when I came here before
Cause no other man has told you
What I've known for so long

I can see from your innocent way you're a star and nobody knows it
I can see from the smile that you wear way you're a queen and I'm making sure of it

You see everyone else but they don't see you
And whatever I say or do
I'm invisible to you

I can paint a sky blue, walk down into
Whatever I say or do
I'm a shadow for you

You know you're my women
There ain't no hesitation
I said that I love you
A love for all time

Sure yeah
