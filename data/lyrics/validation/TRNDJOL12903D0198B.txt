Welcome to the pleasure dome
Now take a seat, the crowd is watching you
Just rats in this experiment
Now learn the maze, but don't tear yourself in two
Don't let it pull you down

And one by one we crawl and two by two
Into the mouth of madness, we seek the perfect view
We reach another turn, then fall out of time
In organized chaos
Evolution 169

You can touch but never taste the answers
Like the way that I want you
Today I killed my ego, if Hell is real
Dear God, please tie my noose
And then he pulled me down

And one by one we crawl and two by two
Into the mouth of madness, we seek the perfect view
We reach another turn, then fall out of time
In organized chaos
Evolution 169

And one by one we crawl and two by two
Into the mouth of madness, we seek the perfect view
We reach another turn, then fall out of time
In organized chaos
Evolution 169
And one by one we crawl and two by two
In organized chaos, we fly away

Don't set your mind to one side
Don't set your mind to one side
