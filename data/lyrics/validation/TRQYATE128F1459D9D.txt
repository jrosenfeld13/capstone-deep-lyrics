Save your money on the flowers
What's yours is mine is ours
And i can grow my own

Diamond rings and cars are easy
And I think they're kinda cheesy
Like summering in Rome
I'm a little jaded
If you wanna know what gets me
You ain't got to get so complicated, all i want's a

Sprinkler on the garden hose and
Aim it at the patio
Iced tea, you and me
Pink flamingo (kind of love)
Let the clothesline be our fortress
Gas up the tiki torches
Sun up, sun down, big dreams, small town
Pink flaming kind of love

Life is great without the clutter
Pass the applebutter
I can't believe this heat

Ain't it simple, ain't it clever
How good we go together
Like june bugs on a string
If our yard was an ocean
And we were sittin' in our lawn chairs
I wouldn't feel any more emotion
Than I do now, all I want's a

Sprinkler on the garden hose and
Aim it at the patio
Iced tea, you and me
Pink flamingo (kind of love)
Let the clothesline be our fortress
Gas up the tiki torches
Sun up, sun down, big dreams, small town
Pink flaming kind of love

Pink flamingo kind of love
Pink flamingo kind of love
