[Verse]
And now, I'm like
"Well, well, well, what the fuck is this?
A condom in my bed
You better start talking, fucking bitch
'Fore I take a match and burn this motherfucker down"
I said, "You better start talking
And start talking right god damn now"
Then she said, "Baby, I'm so speechless"
Then I said, "My baby, you gon' be breathless
If ya don't start talking quick
Woman, I'm gon' have a fit
You don't know what ya fucking with
Girl ya better cut the bullshit
Now it's obvious somebody has been all up in my home
In my bed, and plus I smell cigarettes."
Now I'm sniffing and looking around
Suspicious like someone's here
And then I looked in her eyes
And in her eyes there was so much fear
Pull out my gun said, "Is he still here?"
She shook her head and said nah
I'm checking behind every door
She cried out, "He left right after you called."
I said, "What the fuck was you thinking?
Thought that I wouldnt find this out?
Then I said you must be crazy or
On crack to have somebody off up in my motherfucking house"
She hopped up and said, "That's enough."
She said, "I can't take no more."
And then she said, "You made your point
But now it's time to even the score."
She said, "I know all about last night
And where you went when you left the club."
Said, "That's right, nigga I was there
With this guy in the back of the club."
I said, "I thought you was with yo' girls?"
She said, "I thought you was with yo' guys?"
She said, "You was at that bitch's house
And don't even try to act surprised."
I say "babe...", she said, "Shut up
Don't you say a word
It ain't nothing you can say
That I ain't already heard."
Then I said, "Woman, don't you try to turn it all around
'Cause the fact still remains that someone else was in my house."
Then she said, "You're right about that
Something did go down, but I don't have to turn it around
'Cause what goes around comes back around."
I'm moving a little closer to her
She's tripping over the furniture
She said, "Wait first, just let me explain."
I said, "No need to just give me his name."
And then she said, "Uh... uh"
I say, "Uh, what?"
She said, "please sit down in a chair"
And I say, "No, I'm standing up"
And then she cries out, "I'm so scared to tell you
Because of what you might do"
And I screamed, "Look girl, you better give me this man's name
And I'm not playing with you."
She says "Okay", wipes her nose and then asks me about a girl named Tina
I thought to myself said it sounds familiar
Then I said, "I probably know her if I seen her"
Then I said, "Anyway, girl
What the hell does that got to do with this man?"
She said, "He know my girl Roxanne"
I said, "Who the hell is Roxanne?"
Then she says, "Roxanne's a friend of mine
Who knew this guy named Chuck
Chuck's cool with this guy named Rufus"
And I'm sitting here like, "what the fuck?!"
Then she says, "Rufus wife, Cathy
We both went to high school
She introduced me to the policeman that stopped you"
