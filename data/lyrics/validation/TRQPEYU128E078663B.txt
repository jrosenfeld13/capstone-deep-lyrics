Away beyond the blue
One star belongs to you

And every breath I take
I'm closer to that place

Yeah, baby
I'm gonna meet you there
On the outskirts of the sky
Yeah, baby
I'm gonna meet you there
And we will fly

Away beyond the blue
One star belongs to you

This life is but a dream
Go gently down the stream...

Is nind se, Prabhu, kya mujheuthaoge?
(From this steep, Lord will you wake me?
Is swapan se, Prabhu, kya mujhe jagoge?
From this dream, Lord will you wake me?
Tum hi mai dubu, Turn hi mai uthu
In thee I dive, in thee I rise
Tere sagar me, Tum hi me
In thy sea, in Thee.)
Tere sagar me, Tum hi me
