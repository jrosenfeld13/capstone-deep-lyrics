YOU ALWAYS HURT THE ONE YOU LOVE
Writers Doris Fisher, Allan Roberts

You always hurt the one you love The one you shouldn't hurt at all You always take the sweetest rose And crush it till the petals fall You always break the kindest heart With a hasty word you can't recall So If I broke your heart last night, It's because I love you most of all
