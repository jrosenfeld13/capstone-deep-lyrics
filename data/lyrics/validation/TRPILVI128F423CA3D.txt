I look in the mirror, and it don't seem too late
But I can remember why I have to wait

It keeps me spinning, in a spiral I fall
There's nothing to cling to, no-one to hear me call

This time, well it's now or never
I know, cause I have been there before
A last chance, should be grabbed with both hands
Not thrown, thrown on the floor

I laugh on the outside, but still with a terrible fear
A burning amibition, yeah it's all I can hear
I'm cut by the splinters, been burned by the rope
A proposition, in an entry of hope

This time, well it's now or never
I know, cause I have been there before
A last chance, should be grabbed with both hands
Not thrown, thrown on the floor
Thrown on the floor

This time, well it's now or never
I know, cause I have been there before
A last chance, should be grabbed with both hands
Not thrown, thrown on the floor
