Tired of oozing sentimental like a candy store
Tears trickling down like blood from a sore
Cause your sun don't shine anymore
It's just a manufactured star on a worldwide tour

C'mon try to touch somebody with your ten foot pole
Microwave yourself put some fire in your soul
Instant joy being bottled and sold
It's a new genration wearin' a sugar coat

What you so busy lookin' for
When you know you're already there
But we keep wanting more
Yeah we keep wanting more
But we end up with less

Watch the smoke you blowin' don't inhale the fumes
So busy flossin' but it don't get to the root
I'm so sick of tryin' to consume
Another one trick pony singing in my living room
