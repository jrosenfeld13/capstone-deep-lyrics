Take a little piece now
And save a little for laters
If you come back in time
There might be more for the taking
Bite only what you can chew
Take only what you can use
There's plenty to go around if we don't abuse
Revine the soul by letting go
The weighty heart and heavy conscience
Release the woes of a troubled world
And give them one by one their fair dealing
Take a little time to give a little more
Take a little time to know a little more
Save some time to understand
Take a little time to give a little more
Take a little time to know a little more
Save some time to understand
Oh take a little time to give a little more
Take a little time to know a little more
Save some time to understand
Oh take a little time to give a little more
Take a little time to know a little more
Save some time to understand
It's a heavy burden to bare
If it's knowledge and wisdom we're wasting
To allow a people to fall forsaken
It's a heavy load to shift
What matters now we begin
And don't take to long with the mending and the fixing
So many souls are aching
Too many hearts have been breaking
Forgive the fools that were mistaken
No one ever did find a good use for regret
Take a little time to give a little more
Take a little time to know a little more
Save some time to understand
Take a little time to give a little more
Take a little time to know a little more
Save some time to understand
Oh take a little time to give a little more
Take a little time to know a little more
Save some time to understand
Oh take a little time to give a little more
Take a little time to know a little more
Save some time to understand
????
Revine the soul by letting go
Release the woes of a troubled world
Forgive the fools that were mistaken
No one ever did find a good use for regret
Take a little time to give a little more
Take a little time to know a little more
Save some time to understand
Take a little time to give a little more
Take a little time to know a little more
Save some time to understand
Oh take a little time to give a little more
Take a little time to know a little more
Save some time to understand
Take a little time to give a little more
Take a little time to know a little more
Save some time to understand
So give a little
Take a little now
Give a little
Take a little now
Give a little
Take a little now
Give a little
Take a little now
