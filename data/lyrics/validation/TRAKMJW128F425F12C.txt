I'm a coward I'm a whore
I'm not a problem to ignore
Guess it all will change someday
I will fight to find a way
I'm a freak and I'm a cunt
I'm not proud of all my stunts
I'm more tired than it seems
But I will fulfill my dreams

I got no feelings
I don't love you
You see, everyday
I'm gonna burn you
You don't need someone
New to break you
Leave while you can
Or I will make you

I am weak and you are strong
Never ask what I'll become
I got reasons that is wrong
No way you can't come along
Never left what I believe
Even though what I received
Thinking evil minds are pure
Someday I'll walk out through that door

I got no feelings
I don't love you
You see, everyday
I'm gonna burn you
You don't need someone
New to break you
Leave while you can
Or I will make you

So you think you can recover
From what you'll discover
I think when you'll become a problem
I will run for cover
I got bad intentions baby
But I got good obsessions now

I got no feelings
I don't love you
You see, everyday
I'm gonna burn you
You don't need someone
New to break you
Leave while you can
Or I will make you x2
