We're coming back
We're coming back
We're coming back to you
We're never gonna go away again
Hold on a little longer, try a little harder
'til we're arm in arm together to the end

(Chorus)
So remember, out there somewhere you've got a friend
And you'll never walk alone again

Don't get worried
Don't get scared
We're fighting to get there
Never doubt we're gonna get through
We're gonna run
We're gonna crawl
Kick down every wall
It won't be long we're coming back to you

(Chorus)
So remember, out there somewhere you've got a friend
And you'll never walk alone again

(Guitar Solo)

We're coming back
We're coming back
We're coming back to you
We're never gonna go away again
Hold on a little longer, try a little harder
'til we're arm in arm together to the end

(Chorus)
So remember, out there somewhere you've got a friend
And you'll never walk alone again

(Guitar Solo)
