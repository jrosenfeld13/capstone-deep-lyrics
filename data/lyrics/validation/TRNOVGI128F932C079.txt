Our romance won't end on a sorrowful note
Though by tomorrow you're gone
The song is ending
But as the song writer wrote the melody goes on
They may take you from me, I'll miss your fun caress
But though they take you from me, I'll still posses

The way you wear your hat
The way you sip your tea
The mem'ry of all that --
No, no! They can't take that away from me!
The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams --
No, no! They can't take that away from me!

We can never, never meet again
On the bumpy road to love
Still I'll always, always keep
The mem'ry of --

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced 'til three
The way you changed my life --
No, no! They can't take that away from me!
No! They can't take that away from me!

We can never, never meet again
On the bumpy road to love
Still I'll always, always keep
The mem'ry of --

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced 'til three
The way you changed my life --
No, no! They can't take that away from me!
No! They can't take that away from me!
