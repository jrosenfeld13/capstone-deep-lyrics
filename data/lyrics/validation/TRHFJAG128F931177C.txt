Something's got my fear
And then won't get through my head
But there's something missing
There's something missing here, yeah

Here I go again
React without a plan, oh
But there's something missing
There's something missing here, alright

Makin' love in mama's room
Takin' all I can from you
And when you go, go, go, oh, oh, oh
Go, go, go, oh, oh, oh

She's on high demand
I can try but nobody can, oh
But there's something missing
There's something missing here, yeah

Whoa, lay right on the floor
I want to hear no more, oh
But there's something missing
There's something missing here, alright

Makin' love in mama's room
Takin' all I can from you
And when you go, go, go, oh, oh, oh
Go, go, go, oh, oh, oh

Makin' love in mama's room (makin' love)
Takin' all I can from you (takin' all)
And when you go, go, go, oh
And when you go, go, go, oh, oh, oh

Makin' love in, makin' love in in mama's room
I can't sleep alone in mama's room
I can't sleep alone

Makin' love in mama's room
Takin' all I can from you
And when you go, go, go, oh
And when you go, go, go, oh, oh, oh

Makin' love in mama's room
Takin' all I can from you
And when you go, go, go, oh
And when you go, go, go, oh, oh, oh
