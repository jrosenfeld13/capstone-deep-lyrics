Here I am
I need your shoulder sister, I need your hand
To help me stand, 'cause there's a hurricane where ever I land
And you can fly through any weather
I guess any place is better
Tomorrow, Anna, when the snow whirl's round
I will be waitingt on the lee side hiding from the storm
And any evening when when the heavy sky falls
You will be catching it before it even reaches my door
'Cause like the core of a star
I belong where you are, Anna
I see her scars, as her golden hair lightens up the dark
She's a part of a poetry and I long to hear her talk
She is standing by the river
I know this season makes her bitter
Tomorrow, Anna, when the snow whirl's round
I will be waitingt on the lee side hiding from the storm
And any eveningwhen when the heavy sky falls
I will be catching it before it even reaches your door
'Cause like the core of a star
I belong where you are, Anna
You're the core of my heart
And you belong in my arms
Tomorrow, Anna, when the snow whirl's round
I will be waitingt on the lee side hiding from the storm
And any evening when when the heavy sky falls
I will be catching it before it even reaches your door
'Cause like the core of a star
I belong where you are
You're the core of my heart
And you belong in my arms, Anna
