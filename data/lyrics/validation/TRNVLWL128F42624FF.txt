Youre always talking but the things you say have no meaning
They carry no weight
Take your time but dont waste mine
Go sell your stories im not looking to buy
We all have flaws but this is your downfall
Talkin a game you can't even back up and youre so hollow you have no clue
Theres repercussions and theyre comin for you
Confessions-i leave it up to you
I know where i stand
Oppressions-something i must choose to make you understand
To make you understand i dont share your pains cuz i dont preach about pointless things
I only speak when i have something to say or i won't fake moves disgrace my name
Self pride-i can't throw away
I have too much love for family
Self pride-i won't throw away
Raised to be real from the first day
