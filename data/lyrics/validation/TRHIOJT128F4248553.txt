This time we've gone too far
This time we've opened the scars
To feel destruction
Inside this worlds addiction
Last dance for the new generation
Beloved ones
Virgins of war
Never seen the true
Colors of sufferance

Forever
Face the face of war
Forever
We shall face the face of war
We shall not fall
We shall stand tall
In the midst of all this pain
We will face the face of war

'Til the end of time
Worlds will collide
People will die
And everyone you trust
Will turn on you
To save themselves
From the devil's grip

Stay on guard
Make sure you
Don't drift away
Prepare for battle
Bloodbath of innocent man
Guilty for taking life
For taking life!

Corpses of dead man surround me
Release me from this sanctuary

Forever
Face the face of war
Forever
We shall face the face of war
We shall not fall
We shall stand tall
In the midst of all this pain
We will face the face of war
