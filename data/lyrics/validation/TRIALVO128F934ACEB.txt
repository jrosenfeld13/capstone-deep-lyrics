If the fire can't be put out
Let it burn, let it burn
If you haven't learned your lesson yet
You'll never learn, never learn
When it's hard to hold them down
Let em fly, let em fly
If they don't want to live
Let em die, let em die

It's not so complicated so
Just let them have their way
You see I, I always get my way
Another lucky day

If it's easier to let it go
Let it go
When the water keeps on rising
Let it flow, let it flow
Under too much presure
Then explode, just explode
If they don't want to know
They won't know, they won't know

It's not so complicated so
Just let them have their way
You see I, I always get my way
Another lucky day, lucky day

If it's cheaper to kill
Then let em die, let em die
If their tears can't be stopped
Let em cry, let em cry, cry

It's not so complicated so
Just let them have their way
You see I, I always get my way
Another lucky day, lucky day
