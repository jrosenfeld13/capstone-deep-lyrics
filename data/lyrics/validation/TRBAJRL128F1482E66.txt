Don't say another word
Put my finger to your lips and press
(and press)

God is not watching us
(watching us)
We can do whatever we want
So let's
So let's
It's been so long, so long
It's been so long, been so long
Stop your resistance, this is where you belong

This is where you belong

It's been so long, so long
It's been so long, it's been so long
Stop your resistance, this is where you belong

This is where you belong

This is where you belong

Stop your resistance, this is where you belong

(This is, this is where you belong.)
