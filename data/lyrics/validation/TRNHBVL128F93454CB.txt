I pawned my watch, pawned my chain
Pawned my diamond ring
If that don't settle my drunken spree
I'll never get drunk again
It was late last night when Miss Willie come home
She'd made one rap on my door
I said, "Is that you, Miss Willie? I'd like to know
Don't you rap no more"
I love Miss Willie, yes, I do
I love her till the sea go dry
And if I thought she didn't love me
I'd take morphine and die
She's up in her little stockin' feet, tippin' 'cross the floor
Just like she had done before
Yes, and I pawned my clothes, pawned my shoe
I'll never get drunk no more
I begged Miss Willie, down on my knee
To forgive me, if she please
"Well, you done caused me to weep
And you caused me to moan
Done caused me to lose my happy home"
I hollered, "Oh me, oh my
I'll never let another drink go by"
If I thought she didn't love me
I'd take morphine and die
I pawned my watch, pawned my chain
Pawned my diamond ring
And if that don't settle all my drunken spree
Lord, I'll never get drunk again
