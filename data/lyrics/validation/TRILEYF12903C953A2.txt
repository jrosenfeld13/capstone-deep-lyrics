[Intro]
Again under over wonder
Again under over wonder
Again under over wonder
Again under over wonder

[Chorus]
I met you then fell apart now I'm nothing more than a broken heart
I see you from the inside out, first we turn it up, then we turn it out

[Bridge]
Again under over wonder
Again under over wonder

[Chorus]
