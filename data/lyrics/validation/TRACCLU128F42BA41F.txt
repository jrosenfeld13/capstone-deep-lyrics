Eyeliner up, you knock me down
You hold your breath
And I hold mine
Every step, another step
Towards half-heartedness

Let us be happy while we're still young
Let us be happy while we're still young

Until it all seemed pointless, we lifted up the mattress
From underneath the window seat
'Is this what checkmate means?' she said
Lighting up again
Yes, I like the stillness

Sometimes we had endless hope
And tranquillizer eyes
Fear so close
It's hard to breathe
So close, but we believe

Let us be happy while we're still young
Let us be happy while we're still young

Until it all seemed pointless, we lifted up the mattress
From underneath the window seat
'Is this what checkmate means?' she said
Lighting up again
Yes, I like the stillness

Let us be happy while we're still young
Let us be happy while we're still young
Let us be happy while we're still young
Let us be happy while we're still young
Let us be happy while we're still young
Let us be happy while we're still young

Until it all seemed pointless, we lifted up the mattress
From underneath the window seat
'Is this what checkmate means?' she said
Lighting up again
Yes, I like the stillness
