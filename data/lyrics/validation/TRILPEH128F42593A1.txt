Are you dreaming Jacobs dream?
Could that be why youre smiling?
Could you not be a man like he
So wily and beguiling?
Do you see a ladder there
Reaching up to heaven?
Do the angels fill the air?
Could you reach out and touch them?
Jacob dreamed about Someone
The Way to heaven, God, the Son
Someday its my prayer for you
That in your heart his dream comes true
Jacob dreamed about Someone
The Way to heaven, God, the Son
Someday its my prayer for you
That in your heart his dream comes true
You do not sleep upon a stone
You have a bed to lay in
But, you and Jacob arent alone
We all need dreams to seek Him
