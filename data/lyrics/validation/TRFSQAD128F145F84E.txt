I'm lost in my head, been thinking all around
I've gotta find the off ramp to my heart
Stop lights in a row, when all I want is go
Drop it into first and I'll get home

Its ok I'm alright
I'm just a little rough around the edges of this life
Play it cool, you can always follow
Bread crumbs in a line when you are lost

Little little seeds grew into troubled trees
A sorry sorry sight between my ears
I need to settle down and eat my troubled fruit
The sweetness of the taste will do me good

Its ok I'm alright
I'm just a little rough around the edges of this life
Play it cool you can always follow
Bread crumbs in a line when you are lost

Well the corners of my frown have slowly turned around
No more upside down, no more upside down
They've slowly turned around, they've slowly slowly turned around

Its ok I'm alright
I'm just a little rough around the edges of this life
Play it cool you can always follow
Bread crumbs in a line when you are lost

Repeat
