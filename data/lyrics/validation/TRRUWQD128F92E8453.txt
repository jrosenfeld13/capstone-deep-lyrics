Something's wrong, that made me realise
Maybe now we're not so right
Two people living their different lives

I used to think that
I would never
Ever be so sucked in
You proved me wrong when I held you and felt it take me over
With you by my side
I wanted to be with you
And stay with you
It's so embarrassing
That I...

Fell in love
Fell in love
Fell in love

I
Feel
So weak
When I'm with you
Why can't I get you
Out of my head?

When I go to sleep
I lay my head
Then all I can see
Is you in front of me
Why Did You
Creep into my head
One Day?
And you never went away
Why did you do this
I am Scarred In The Nic-est way
But I want it to heal
Feel so Pa-the-tic that I can't
Control my emotions
Why I am so hyper everyday
Because of you

If you weren't so perfect
Maybe I could get over you
Do you think I deserve this?
Why can't you just be cool?

And I wonder now, what you are
As I fall down

So good once

Fell in love
Fell in love

Get out
My Head!

When I go to sleep
I lay my head
Then all I can see
Is you in front of me
Why Did You
Creep into my head
One Day?
And you never went away
Why did you do this again
I am Scarred In The Nic-est way
But I want it to heal
Feel so Pa-the-tic that I can't
Control my emotions
Why I am so hyper everyday
Because of you?

And I wonder now, what you are
As I fall down
Take my soul away from you
And I wonder now
If you weren't so perfect

What you are
As I fall

Well, maybe she never loved you
Maybe you never loved her
Did you ever think of that?
Stop bothering yourself with whispers
Stop bothering yourself
Pull yourself together, would you...

Sucked me in
With Just three words
These three words
