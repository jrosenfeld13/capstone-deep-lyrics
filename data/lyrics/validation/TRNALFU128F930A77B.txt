Rip it up

If you were in the movies who would you play?
If you were tried for murder what could you say?
And if you were out to lunch what would you eat?
We wanna know the answers, who do you want to beat?

Don't show your fear
You better keep it out of site
Don't lose your place in here
And you might be all right

Don't say nothing, shut your mouth
Youre out of time, work it out
You're living in a cruel world
And your face is out of style
Boogey man, magic word
Walk a crooked mile

If you were Armageddon who would you spare?
If you were judge and jury why would you care?
And if you were out of breath how would you breathe?
The world deserves the answers, what do you have up your sleeve?

Can't show your hand
Remember what I say
Can't play that ace in here
Never see another day

Plead no contest, pass the buck
Running scared, you ain't so tough
We hold rehearsal for your death
We're tired of your smile
Boogey man, see what you get
Walk a crooked mile

Standing in the spotlight, what would you need?
If you were a soldier how would you bleed?
And if you were in the rain what would you wear?
We're hungry for the answers, don't seem right, but we don't care

Don't bring your friends
Send them all away
Don't meet your end in here
Don't throw your life away

Don't you change, don't drop your guard
Double bluff throw down your cards
Death has put his mark on you
Man and boy and child
Boogey man, back to start
Walk a crooked mile
In my shoes, babe
