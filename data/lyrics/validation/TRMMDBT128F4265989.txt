If i had me a bag of good wishes
There's no mystery to what i would do
I would use all my magical powers
And try to get next to you
I would bring you a field of flowers
As your lucky star would do
With my heart i would paint you a rainbow
If i could get next to you
There's so much we can share
However far too long
We both know that there's so much here
This is where I belong
Late at night when I close my eyes
Make believin' that you are here
Dreamin' of the things we do
If I could get next to you
In my mind, Ooh ooh, I have kissed you
And it feels like a thousand times
I'd lose track of all the hours
Dreamin' i'm next to you
This is where I belong
Late at night when I close my eyes
Make believin' that you are here
Dreamin' of things we do
If i could get next to you
In my mind, Ooh ooh, I have kissed you
And it feels like a thousand times
I'd lose track of all the hours
Wishing and hoping
That I could get next to you
