There's no reason to be sad
Or wallow in your misery
Somewhere in the city
Far away from here
When the light of life turns sour
We can spend our final hour
My melancholy friend

The deep and haunted cavern
Is our temporary heaven
It's not hard to see
So drink up and take your desire
By the morning your brain is on fire
With a wealth of possibilities
I see no reason to resist this

He's shedding skin
He's shedding skin, yeah!

Whatever, whenever you feel blue
It don't matter what you do or say
I will be here for a million years
To keep the hands at bay
The wind and rain away
Ooh...

He's shedding skin
He's shedding skin
So come on and do it with him
