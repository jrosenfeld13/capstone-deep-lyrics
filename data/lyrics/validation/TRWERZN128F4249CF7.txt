I remember daddy's hands
Folded silently in prayer
And reaching out to hold me when I had a nightmare
You could read quite a story in the caluses and lines
Years of work and worry had left their mark behind

I remember daddy's hands
How they held my momma tight
And patted my back for something done right
There are things that i've forgotten that I loved about the man
But I'll always remember the love in daddy's hands

(chorus)
Daddy's hands
Were soft and kind when I was crying
Daddy's hands
Were hard as steel when I'd done wrong
Daddy's hands
Weren't always gentle but I've come to understand
There was always love in daddy's hands

I remember daddy's hands working til they bled
Sacrificed unselfishly just to keep us all fed
If I could do things over
I'd live my life again
And never take for granted the love in daddy's hands

(chorus)
Daddy's hands
Were soft and kind when I was crying
Daddy's hands
Were hard as steel when I'd done wrong
Daddy's hands
Weren't always gentle but I've come to understand
There was always love in daddy's hands
(repeat)
