Ten minutes of death, murder, destruction
Preceeded by some simple instructions
Channel 2, channel5, 36, 46, click click, yo ain't that a bitch?
Don't snooze on the news 'cause you're gonna lose
Hell, is what you sell on a large scale
Profit for misery, you know it's sick
The people that you sell, a mindless clientele

The poison schools, the prison pools is where you send your youth to break the rules
Education's been non-void, that's why I'm so paranoid
One time, and one time only if it's detrimental to your ass home
But let it be something making no sense, they pump a lot of hype and make a strong defense
To spread the ideas and burn the ones...

Propaganda. Don't believe the hype
Propaganda. Don't believe the hype
Propaganda. What lies do you read?
Propaganda. Tell me, what do you believe?
Propaganda. Is white really good?
Propaganda. Is black really bad?
Propaganda. We're talking about propaganda

Hid a secret from a nigga put it in a book
Ohh shit, my race got took
Ever heard of Maat?
I think not, Black man's religion that got faded out
Nigga lovers, I treat them like my brothers
Civil rights, they killed plenty whites, but they'll have you to believe
That no white died for black
Do you reall beleive?
