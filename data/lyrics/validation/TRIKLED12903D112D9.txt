What if I'm wrong and you figure it out
That we just don't belong and you're better off without me?
The minute you're gone, I bet it would dawn on me
Suddenly, suddenly, yeah
So what if I, what if I fall
Would you hate me? Would you let me go?
What if I realized that you're the only one
Who makes me, who makes me whole?
Blundering on, making no sense
Without any thought to the consequences
But one of these days the truth will be facing me
And I will find a way back to you again, oh
So what if I, what if I fall
Would you hate me? Would you take it all?
What if I realized that you're the only one
Who makes me, who makes me, who makes me whole? Yeah
Who makes me whole now
What if I, what if I find the thing that I want?
The minute you're gone, I bet it would dawn on me
Suddenly, suddenly, yeah
So what if I, what if I fall
Would you hate me? Would you take it all?
What if I realized that you're the only one
Who makes me, can make me, who makes me whole?
