[Verse 1: Sesta]
Rocked up without an invite, crashed the planet
Shock in a host but, happen to manage
And I'll be takin' advantage and leavin' a little something
Like becomin' an ex of a midget, listen
I ain't here to impress you or the misled
Quit tearin' at your wrist for shit the chick said
You know she know nothin'
And I ain't here to discuss it, but I know she ain't bluffin'
Black Sally the baddest, you don't romance with her hold hands with it
She cold, she plan nothing but your downfall
Oh, and you do it again
And if it ain't enough this time she's bringing two of her friends Yeah, now we sit in agreement and if you keep it a secret
But you tell us all, "you snitch and I'm leaving"
Yeah, man would have thought on a planet of lies
Under the ground for the love, for the pride, then you gone

[Hook: Maurice Greer]
Black Sally's coming down to get you, it won't be long
Black Sally's gonna hold on tight, and she's oh so strong
Black Sally's coming down to get you, it won't be long
Black Sally's gonna hold on tight, and she's oh so strong
Spell on you, nothing you can do

[Verse 2: Trials]
Hey, you messed up right, having trouble standin' upright
Pulled over dancin' to the siren like they club lights (Sally)
You keep doin' me wrong back
Back when Kirsty Alley used to be hot
It's not about a woman scorin' seats
I caught you looking at me for the wrong reason like a Woman's sport
What you want I can't give it, listen, liquor my love
So many pictures of you, so very little of us, huh
(Sally) Listen up, god damn you're body banging
Boy meets girl in a second she body bag 'em
Hook line and sinker, that's why I drink 'er
Warm in the winter, warnin' you in for
Black Sally she the girl of my dreams, huh
Black Sally she there whenever I need her
Black Sally three-seventy-five
Black Sally, seven fifty, plenty of time, ugh

[Hook: Maurice Greer]
Black Sally's coming down to get you, it won't be long
Black Sally's gonna hold on tight, and she's oh so strong
Black Sally's coming down to get you, it won't be long
Black Sally's gonna hold on tight, and she's oh so strong
Spell on you, nothing you can do

[Verse 3: Hons]
Now you say that we can work it out, but yo, I doubt it girl
Wakin' next to you only makes me wanna power-hurl
I built a tolerance over the years to your moods
But I can't take no more I need to divorce you
Now you've gone and made me raise my voice again, Sally
We never alone, it's always you and your annoying friends
When we met, you were bubbly
But over time you turned flat and needed warmin' up to touch me
That night with Charlese was a one-time flick
Plus you always nagged me, "I need to try new things"
Yo, my human instinct tells me that you're the best Sally
Your head and body lift my mood like a pep rally
We've got a love-hate relationship
Love the way you keep me high-spirit but hate the fact you made of it
Girl you're my flavour, my number one saviour
Got me counting down the seconds till the next time I taste ya

[Turntablism: DJ Reflux]
(Break it down like this)
Black Sally's coming down to get you
Black-Black-Black Sally
Black Sally's gonna hold on tight, And she's oh so wrong
(Break it down)
Black Sally's coming down to get you
Black-Black-Black Sally
Black Sally's gonna hold on tight, And she's oh so wrong (Black Sally)

[Hook: Maurice Greer]
Black Sally's coming down to get you, it won't be long
Black Sally's gonna hold on tight, and she's oh so strong
Black Sally's coming down to get you, it won't be long
Black Sally's gonna hold on tight, and she's oh so strong
Spell on you, nothing you can do
