Travesty the way the wretched stand
Upon the earth blind in their ignorance
Embracing the slavery of their minds
Soulless voids of being left wandering

Take this blade of Elohim
Drain the life from within these fools
Release the soul, from within the flesh
Saviours your name we celebrate

Forlorn, they shutter at their shrines
Tortured by Deities, they hold no revelance
Enslaved by the weakness of their minds
Their cripple prayers have left them smothering

Seize this, the hand of our god
Drain this life the burden of this fools
Release the soul, from within the flesh
Cleanse the soul, of their lives
Cleanse the soul fo impurity
Sickness unyielding pestilence
Sickness infects of meek
Sickness bound to deities
Sickness formed by lies

Travesty the way the wretched stand
Upon the earth blind in their ignorance
Embracing the slavery of their minds
Soulless voids of being left wandering
