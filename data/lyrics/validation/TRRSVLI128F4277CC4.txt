And as we walk
To the place still farther
All the colors, of the day ????
All the features, still glistening
Within me

From the moments
Come home to ?????

And as we walk
Past a weatherbeaten fencepost
Get to see the land
That somebody stole

While some of our friends go there
And never see
The living miracles
And the color... and the colorful stone

And I saw your eyes
They were shiny sparkling crystal clear
And I said
"Keep the spirit clean...... and let the high times roll"

(Hey hey) And let the high times roll
Hey hey, hey hey
