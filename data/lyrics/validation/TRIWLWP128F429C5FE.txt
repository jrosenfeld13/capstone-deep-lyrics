[Intro]
It took five women to get you off of my mind
It took five months, a plenty good wasted time
But it just took five minutes when I saw your face again
To fall in love all over, I guess with you I'll never win

[Verse 1]
March was a cold one in more ways than one
Went down to the nightclub looking for the sun
Looking for a light that could brighten up a day
That's been darker than a hole since you went away
April usually brings showers
This time it was a hurting kind
This woman said she wanted my baby
I told her I'd have to be deaf, dumb, and blind
To fall in love with someone that I barely knew
The baby would never really have a father
Because I still, Because I still, Because I still, still, still, huh
Be stuck on you

[Chorus]
It took five women to get you off of my mind
Get off my mind, baby
Falling in love all over... you I'll never win

[Verse 2]
May was her name, she was jumping
Jumping from plane to plane
Actress or model or something
Can't even remember her first name
June brought an Easter bunny
Needless to say, hmph, that girl was late
Told a made-up story to a busy-body of our only date
What a sketch!
July was a heartbreak, extraordinary
Said I met this woman whose kiss was something scary
It felt so much, so much like yours
But it only made me, made me want you more
She's gone, she's gone but you're still here
I want you very..., huh, it's you I fear

[Outro]
But it took five women to get you off my mind
It took five months, five months, a plenty good wasted time
But it just took five minutes and I saw your face again
I fell in love all over with you, I guess I'll never win
(I'll never win)
