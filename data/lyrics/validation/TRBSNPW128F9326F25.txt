Saturday night a'cruisin the streets in the city
Hey mister can you tell me where to go
He said I know a place, now if you want the real nitty gritty, well Lucrecia is the girl that you oughta know
So I jumped in the cab, I followed this stranger's direction, We pulled up to the Paradise Hotel
I walked up the steps so eager in need of affection
I reached out and stuck my finger on the bell
And then a voice outta nowhere said kindly state your business, please
Lucrecia, angel in the night, spread your wings and take me on a magic flight
Lucrecia, a quarter for the dance
Well if you spend your money, she'll supply the sweet romance
On up in her room, my fantasy went into motion, she thrilled me like I never been before
I was weak in the knees, after the ragin' commotion
I stood up and slowly staggered to the door
She said you came in like a schoolboy but you leavin here a man
Lucrecia, angel in the night, spread your wings and take me on a magic flight
Lucrecia, a quarter for the dance
Well if you spend your money, then she'll supply the sweet romance. (repeat)
