Friends of mine don't know me
They say that I don't seem the same
Gone, the sounds of laughter
And we both know who's to blame

And why did you have to leave me
Tell me why you said we're through?
Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me I love you?

Thank you for the summer
Could you tell I wanted more?
Years it took to find love
Walked away and just what for?

And why did you have to leave me?
Tell me why you said goodbye?
Can you tell me why
Tears are falling from your eyes?

Why did you have to leave me?
Tell me why you said goodbye?
Can you tell me why
The tears are falling from your eyes?
