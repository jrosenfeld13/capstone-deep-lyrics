[Intro]
Oh, you can have it all and wrap it in the world
You can have everything
You can have love and lots of other things
To make you think
But when it all comes down to you, girl
Yeah, no matter what you do
Take a look at yourself and realise
I've been good to you, I've been good to you

[Verse 1]
Oh, no, I didn't mean to say what I did say
About lovers and how they should lay
Well, that was never for me to say and say
Don't you see now how I pay?

[Refrain]
I see the sun rising
And all you see is it fall, fall, fall

[Verse 2]
So come on up, wasn't it you who said life was like a plastic cup?
To be used and then disposed of
Yeah, but that's no way to live a life like yours
Don't you see now how I pay?

[Refrain]
I see the sun rising
But all you see is it fall, fall, fall

[Chorus]
For all the times I never, never turned away
And now she's here on someone else's arm
For all the times I never, never turned her way
And now she's here on someone else's arm

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
For all the times I never, never turned her way
And now she's here on someone else's arm
For all the times I never, never turned her way
And now she's here on someone else's arm
