[Verse 1]
I asked your mother for you
She tole me that you was too young
I wish to the good Lord that I'd never seen your face
I'm sorry that you ere were born

[Chorus]
Irene good night
Irene good night
Good night Irene
Good night Irene
I'll get you in my dreams

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I live in the country
Sometimes I live in town
Sometimes I haves a great notion
Jumping in to the river and drown

[Chorus]
Irene good night
Irene good night
Good night Irene
Good night Irene
I'll get you in my dreams

[Verse 3]
Stop ramblin', and stop gamblin'
Quit staying out late at night
Go home to your wife and family
Stay there by the fireside bright

[Chorus]
Irene good night
Irene good night
Good night Irene
Good night Irene
I'll get you in my dreams

[Verse 4]
I love Irene God knows I do
I love her til the sea runs dry
If Irene turns her back on me
I'm gonna take morphine and die
