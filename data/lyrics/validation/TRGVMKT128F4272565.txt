[Verse]
Mississippi
You've been on my mind
Like a mist in the morning
From some dream I've left behind
Mississippi
I've been kinda down
Because it's been such a long time
Since I've seen old Jackson town

[Chorus]
I could be on the other side of the world
But in my memory, all I can see
Is Spanish moss hanging from a live oak tree

[Verse 2]
Mississippi
Save a place for me;
I'll be coming home again [coming home again]
Mississippi, until then [until then]
You'll be on my mind
I'll be coming home again
Mississippi, until then
You'll be on my mind

[Chorus]
