Hey hero what you do
Ain't gonna wait one heart on you
Again and again
Hey hero who are you
Ain't got no hint, Ain't got no clue
Now give up your name
Let us down
Don't let us down
Gone find a way
Gone find a way without you
Though we're not the same
No never the same
Without you
Oohhh

Where are you, my friend so true
How come my love gone make you blue
I saw it today
Tell us all your point of view
Tell us a thing we'd never knew
Please tell right a way
Take us down
Don't take us down
Gone find a way
Gone find a way without you
Though we're not the same
No never the same
Without you
Hey hero what you do?
Mmmm
What you do
Ooohhh
