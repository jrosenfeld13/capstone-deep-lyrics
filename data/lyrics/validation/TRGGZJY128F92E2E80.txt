This is where I want to be
This is where I like it best
Up here asleep on my baby's chest

This is where I hope to stay
This is where I might end my quest
Up here asleep on my baby's chest

I've been North
I've been South
I've been bait in the fish's mouth

If we put it to a test
She might end up best
Have I finally found some rest

And if it comes to an end
I can say I had a friend
And that makes me feel blessed

Up here asleep
Up here asleep
On my
On my
Baby's chest
