They take my voice and they feed my eyes
All I read is a bed of lies
I know the truth of the idiot youth
Is nothing than a guise
And who's scared?
Not me
So get up and use me
The universe, white from a bed
And don't you know he's already dead
So get up and use me
Tell me I have everything to live for
It means nothing to me
And from what I can see
And I'm blind
So get up and use me
The dumbing down of lies
The dumbing down of a bed of lies
So tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
To get up, get up, get up, get up
