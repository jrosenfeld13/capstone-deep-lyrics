This world is not my home
This life will pass
Only what is done for God will last

With the time we have
Let's not waste it away, no
Let every heartbeat, let every breath we breathe say

Lord, take my life and use it up
Spread it thin like a blanket of love
Over the world that You gave Your blood for
Take my life, take it all, Lord

Lord, without You
Nothing makes sense
Down here the grass dies on both sides of the fence

So all my vain searching
Will never amount to much
Here's my life, Lord, use it up for the cause of Love
For Your cause
