Tell me what they said when they found out that I've lost you

Tell me that you feel better when I say it scares me too

I'm not a friend of yours anymore

I'm not a friend of yours anymore

Tell me every bent

Tell me all of the dances I never know

Tell me every fence

Tell me all the gaves you never show

I'm not a friend of yours anymore

I'm not a friend of yours anymore

Refrain:

And tonight

I hate birds

I hate birds

I hate birds

I hate birds (x2)

I hate birds (x3)
