I bought a car it's yellow
I drove around a lot
I caught a fish and fried it
I ate it on the spot - hot
And that's my year in review
With you things could be different

Looks aren't everything
Looks aren't everything
Looks aren't everything

By Jove I think I've got it
By Jove it's come at last
By Jove there's fingers on it
By Jove it's come at last

For the one who has made us all
Can't be seen even if you're tall
Looks aren't everything

Sleep sound and dream you've earned it
A most impressive day
Deeds and props rewarded
It's almost Saturday - say!

I like you more when the view and you are less than perfect

Looks aren't everything
Looks aren't everything
Looks aren't everything

Wake up the dawn's upon us
No don't go run and hide
I've got some jokes to tell you
And God is on your side

For the one who has made us all
Can't be seen even if you're tall

Looks aren't everything
Looks aren't everything

We'll move in to the city
Where we just bought a house
And nature's non existent
But there they under stand that

Looks aren't everything

By Jove I think we've got it
By Jove it's come at last
By Jove there's fingers on it
By Jove it's come at last

For the one who has made us all
Can't be seen even by the tall
For the one who has made us all
Can't be seen even if you're tall
