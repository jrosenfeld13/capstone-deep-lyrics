Making choices and hoping that they're alright
Hating waiting for something to make this
Worth the waiting and what are you waiting for
Any advice

Intevention
Of a mental melt down
Too late to help
It's out of my hands now
Do you want to
Do what you want to and
Not tell me how
Explanations
Are more than I'm asking for
Just suggestions
Not unfeeling metaphors
No recaps
All over again
To remember tonight
And make this worth a fight

Making choices and hoping that they're alright
Hating waiting for something to make this
Worth the waiting and what are you waiting for
Any advice

We are losing
All sight of
The big picture
And there is no light on
Upstairs there's nobody home
And I'll unplug the phone
Misdirected aggression
From an obvious lack of attention
Would you care if I mention the fact
That I'm losing my mind
And I'm not even looking this time

Making choices and hoping that they're alright
Hating waiting for something to make this
Worth the waiting and what are you waiting for
Any advice

Could you spare for a friend
So I don't do it twice
And fall into a trend
And make this happy story end
There's a crack in the ice
Any advice
Any advice
Any advice

Making choices and hoping that they're alright
Making mistakes and thinking they're always right
Making choices and hoping that they're alright
Hating waiting for something to make this
Worth the waiting and what are you waiting for
Any advice

Intervention
Of a mental melt down
Too late to help
It's out of my hand now
Do you want to
Do what you want and
Not tell me how
