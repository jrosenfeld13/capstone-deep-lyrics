Here and now
And now and now
And now and now
And now and now
And now and now

Here and now
And now and now
And now and now
And now and now

Here I am, you made it all so clear
I understand, I am just a stranger here
I leave it all behind
All that's left is gone
And I know about my mind
Straight into your arms

Here and now we will stand with one voice hand in hand
We will never back down, we will never give in
Here and now we will sing with one voice and we bring
Our life as an offering we bring you everything
