You had plenty money, 1922
You let other women make a fool of you
Why dont you do right, like some other men do?
Get out of here and get me some money too

Youre sittin there and wonderin what its all about
You aint got no money, they will put you out
Why dont you do right, like some other men do?
Get out of here and get me some money too

If you had prepared twenty years ago
You wouldnt be a-wanderin from door to door
Why dont you do right, like some other men do?
Get out of here and get me some money too

I fell for your jivin and I took you in
Now all you got to offer mes a drink of gin
Why dont you do right, like some other men do?
Get out of here and get me some money too
Why dont you do right, like some other men do?
Like some other men do
