[Verse 1]
This morning there was joy in my heart because I know that I loved you so
Scrambled eggs, are so boring, for you're all, all that I want to know
Kisses never lie when delivered with milk from your lips
Morning glories never cry
My love for you, baby, drips

[Chorus]
Life can be so nice
It's a wonderful world, sweet paradise (paradise)
Kiss me once, kiss me twice
Life can be so nice, so nice
Life can be so nice, so nice

[Verse 2]
No one plays the clarinet the way you play my heart
I come a thousand different ways before I even start
You're so nice

[Bridge]
Shivering madly (Shivering madly in your embrace)
Your embrace (is it better than a trip?)
Better than a trip (Morning glories never cry)
(My love is just dripping)
Morning glories crying (Scrambled eggs are boring)
Embrace (mama, you're all I want to know)
I do love you baby, (This morning there was joy in my heart)
You baby (because you know I loved you so, yeah)
Alright

[Chorus]
Life can be so nice
It's a wonderful world, sweet paradise (paradise)
Kiss me once, kiss me twice
Life can be so nice, so nice
Life can be so nice, so nice
Life can be so nice
It's a wonderful world, sweet paradise (paradise)
Kiss me once, kiss me twice
Life can be so nice, so nice
Life can be so nice, so nice
