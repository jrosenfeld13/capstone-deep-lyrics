All of the things you wanted were just outside your atmosphere
And if you could just have them you would be happy apart from me

And it took a while but it was more than worth the wait

The rain was falling when you said "I'm leaving"
I had to watch you go
I want this fall to change
I never heard you say that you were wrong

You picked out your path but didn't you ever wonder if I was ok?
And doesn't the guilt eat up your mind? I just thought I'd ask

And it took a while but it was more than worth the wait
This year october came

All these questions hid in me so long
I just want to hear you say you were wrong
