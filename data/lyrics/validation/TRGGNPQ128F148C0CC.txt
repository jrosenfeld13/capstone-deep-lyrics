In a dream a long time ago
We fell in love but what did we know
Years seemed to pass as time took its toll
You're here at last, so why must you go?

But tonight you belong to me, yeah
Yes tonight you belong to me

I know your leaving, going away
And I'm going out of my head
Well go on and leave me, what can I say?
You don't hear a word that I'll say

But tonight you belong to me
Yeah, tonight you belong to me

(You belong)
(You belong)

Well don't say, "I love ya," baby, love isn't sorrow and pain
I hope and pray this never happens again
Well go on and leave me, all I can say
Baby, I know you will be sorry someday

But tonight you belong to me
Oh, tonight you belong to me, hey

(You belong)

Oh tonight you belong to me, yeah
Yeah, tonight you belong to me
Yeah, tonight you belong to me
Well, tonight you belong to me
