I Am The Black Goat
Wandering Amongst The Trees
Bastard Of Thousands
Selfish God Of All

Sullen Skies Alight In Curiosity
If All Else Ends, This Time Man Has Arranged A Doubt
In All Shortcomings Brings This Struggle
To Ignite The Once Force Of Stable Unity
To Die As One In This Creative Legion
These Colors Of Life Almost Bleed Out Loud
These Ancient Lores Of Kindreds Unknown
A Myth Unveiled To Bring The End Of Eternity

I Am Drunk On The Blood Of The Unborn Child
The Wolves Gather Around To Greet Me In The Shadows

Black Candles Burn As The Demons Swarm My Eyes
Blood Is Shared... Invocation To The Elder Gods
Rights Of The Blackened Angel Now Come To Me
I Hear The Voices Call To Me In The Darkness

Untold Oceans Of A Black Beyond... Cast Out For These Deeds
Infect The Bloodline To Bleed All... Glorious Taste Of Victory
This A Key That Lies Within... The Flesh Of A New Frost
Bitter To Summon Locust Winds... Among Gardens Of Pain

I Am The Testament Of Lucifer
I Shall Give My Kingdom To The Beast
I Call Upon The Four Corners Of Hell
Come Forth To Me With Your Wrath

Wormholes Descend For Eternity
Mausoleum Of Tears Combust Into Fire
Visual Myth Of The Underworld
Taught To Keep A Mortal Man To Fear

Release The Black Curse
And Drink The Poison Of God

Uncleansed Hands Breath Death Into This Stream
An Offering Of Tranquility Upon The Winds
A Scavengers Brittle Silver Wings
To Yeild This Sickle Of Contemplation...

...Upon All Who Have Denied ...Silence Grows Weak
...A Dormant Lying Disease ...Not A Soul Shall Speak
