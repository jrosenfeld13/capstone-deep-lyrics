[Verse 1]
Sometimes I shave my legs and sometimes I dont
Sometimes I comb my hair and sometimes I wont
Depend on how the wind blows I might even paint my toes
It really just depends on whatever feels good in my soul

[Hook]
Im not the average girl from your video
And I aint built like a supermodel
But I learned to love myself unconditionally
Because I am a queen
I not the average girl from your video
My worth is not determined by the price of my clothes
No matter what Im wearing I will always be
India.Arie

[Verse 2]
When I look in the mirror and the only one there is me
Every freckle on my face is where its suppose to be
And I know my creator didnt make no mistakes on me
My feet, my thighs, my lips, my eyes, Im loving what I see

[Hook]
Im not the average girl from your video
And I aint built like a supermodel
But I learned to love myself unconditionally
Because I am a queen
I not the average girl from your video
My worth is not determined by the price of my clothes
No matter what Im wearing I will always be
India.Arie

[Verse 3]
Am I less of a lady if I dont wear panty hose
My momma said a lady aint what she wears but what she knows
But Ive drawn the conclusion, its all an illusion
Confusions the name of the game
A misconception, a vast deception
Something's got to change
Now dont be offended this is all my opinion
Aint nothing that Im saying law
This is a true confession of a life learned lesson
I was sent here to share with y'all
So get in when you fit in, go on and shine
Clear your mind, nows the time
Put your salt on the shelf
Go on and love yourself
Cause everythings gonna be alright

[Hook]
Im not the average girl from your video
And I aint built like a supermodel
But I learned to love myself unconditionally
Because I am a queen
I not the average girl from your video
My worth is not determined by the price of my clothes
No matter what Im wearing I will always be
India.Arie

[Verse 4]
Keep your fancy drink, and your expensive minks
I dont need that to have a good time
Keep your expensive cars and your caviar
Alls I need is my guitar
Keep your Cristal and your pistol
Id rather have a pretty piece of crystal
Dont need your silicone, I prefer my own
What God gave me is just fine

[Hook]
Im not the average girl from your video
And I aint built like a supermodel
But I learned to love myself unconditionally
Because I am a queen
I not the average girl from your video
My worth is not determined by the price of my clothes
No matter what Im wearing I will always be
India.Arie
