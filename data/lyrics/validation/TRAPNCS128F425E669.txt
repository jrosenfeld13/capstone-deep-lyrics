Sitting in my chair and thinking
Thinking of the crowd I've been with
Thinking of the music I make
And all the things I don't wanna give
Well dig everything I want
The girls are fighting for me
But everytime that I take one
Their indisposed poor old me!
Well, this is my life of sadness
This is the life I live
This is my life of gladness
This is the life I live
Last week I went to the graveyard
My dog was killed by car
Feel the pain, the pain is started
He's dead, but friends, we still are
Sunday we played in a dancing
The public was very down
But it didn't bore us a thing'
Cos we smoked ourselves a kick
Well, this is my life of sadness
This is the life I live
This is my life of gladness
This is the life I live
I had a girl and I loved her
She knows, she knows I still do
But she married with a rich man
But the things she wants, he can't do
Once we were on Joops wedding
We smoked and drink all nicht
At twelve we were thrown out
'Cos the house was changed into a crowd
Well, this is my life of sadness
This is the life I live
This is my life of gladness
This is the life I live
