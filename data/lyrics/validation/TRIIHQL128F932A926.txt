Slow down, you move too fast;
You got to make the morning last;
Just kickin' down the cobblestones
Lookin' for fun, and feelin' groovy
Hello, lamppost, whatcha knowin'?
I've come to watch your flowers growin'
Ain'tcha got no rhymes for me?
Dootin'-doo-doo-doo, feelin' groovy
Ba da da da da da da, feelin' groovy
Got no deeds to do, no promises to keep;
I'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep;
Let the mornin' time drop all its petals on me
Life, I love you, all is groovy
Slow down, you move too fast;
You got to make the morning last;
Just kickin' down the cobblestones
Lookin' for fun, and feelin' groovy
Ba da da da da da da, feelin' groovy
