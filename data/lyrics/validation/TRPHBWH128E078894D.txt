Sipping tea
Let the rivers pass me by
These dusty tears
Need no place to cry

I need no reason for the first time in my life
I just need to be on my way
I don't want for anything that i don't have
All i want is waiting for me there, for me there
With my czarina, queen of all that i believe
Stillborn seasons cradle our affairs

I light a candle
My lover to protect
In sackcloth and ashes
My lover will descend

I need no reason for the first time in my life
I just need to be on my way
I don't want for anything that i don't have
All i want is waiting for me there
I don't want for anything that i don't have
All i want is waiting for me there for me there

Hid behind your walls
I waste the day
If i want
All this and more are under me

I need no reason for the first time in my life
I just need to be on my way
I don't want for anything that i don't have
All i want is waiting for me there
I don't want for anything that i don't have
All i want is waiting for me there
For me there
For me there
