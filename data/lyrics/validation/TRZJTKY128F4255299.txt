Believe in someone
Other than yourself
Someone special
Who lifts you in the air

We got to learn
Learn to find a way
And we gotta live
Live for love today

No colors, no borders
Just you and I
No teardrops, no heartache
To tear apart our lives

No colors, no borders
Just you and I
No teardrops, no heartache
To tear apart our lives

There's a purpose
A reason to be
Can you feel it?
Don't you want to break free

No colors, no borders
Just you and I
No teardrops, no heartache
To tear apart our live

No colors, no borders
Just you and I
No teardrops, no heartache
To tear apart our live

No colors, no borders
Just you and I
No teardrops, no heartache
To tear apart our live
