No thunder, no lightning, no showers in your eyes
No dark nights, because they're frightening
No me in a disguise
And when ya feel good, well I feel good too
I wouldn't put nothin' over on you

This mornin' without warnin'
She dropped in on me
We sat there, but that there girl means nothin' to me
While she was schemin', well I was dreamin' of you
I wouldn't put nothin' over on you

I know it was just a misunderstanding
That ya saw
I happened to be kissin' your best friend
Who lived next door
And in an unfortunate sequence of events
The next day the whole town was talkin'
About me behind the fence
But don't believe a thing of ya

Until ya talk to me
I wouldn't put nothing over on you
I wouldn't put nothing over on you

I know it was just a misunderstandin'
That ya saw
I happened to be kissing your best friend that lived next door
And in an unfortunate sequence of events
The next day the whole town is talkin'
About me behind the fence
But don't believe a thing of you hear
Until you talk to me
I wouldn't put nothin' over on you
No no I wouldn't put nothin'
I wouldn't put nothin' over on you
No no I wouldn't put nothin'
I wouldn't put nothin' over on you
No no I wouldn't put nothin'
I wouldn't put nothin' over on you
