It's in the air like pestilence spreading to the settlements
Infecting residents trapped in irrelevance
'cause presidents - dead or alive - take precedence
According to the preference of so-called intelligence
The communities are sacked with impunity
By stooges of il duce with immunity
Soon to be distorted and contorted when the story gets reported
And I'm foolish enough to still think that it's important
So I look the all seeing eye in the retina
Bettin' ya that it won't blink so I don't blink back
Far reaching but not far fetched
So far so good but what comes next?

Chorus
The rings they kiss, the arms they twist
Get pissed at this
The chances missed, the cowardice
Get pissed at this

So what happens to a dream deferred of purple mountains
Accountants scrounge for coins they found in fountains
Serving promisary notes for lives lived a la mode
Will it dry up like a raisin, or just explode
I've seen the signs in semifore
And those dreams that died like dinosaurs
So come with me underneath the streets that pound you feet
And treat your life lines more like they metaphors
Drop the bomb, stop the watch, end the silence
And learn from Circe cause I hear sirens
Tyrants seek compliance from their cohorts
Freedom has it's price, can they afford yours?

Chorus
Did you change the world our your point of view..
Will I change the world or my point of view
Chorus
