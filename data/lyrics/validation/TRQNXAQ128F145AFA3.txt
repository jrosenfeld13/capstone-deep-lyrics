I played a wedding for the money
And I wished I could have told the bride and groom
Just what I think of marriage
And what's in store after their honeymoon
And I was grumbling to the dancers
About how men and women ought to live apart
And how a promise never made can not be broken
And can never break a heart

Then suddenly, from out of nowhere
A little girl came dancing cross the floor
And all her crinolines were billowin'
Beneath the skirt of calico that she wore
And oh, what a joy fell on the honored guests
As each one of them was drawn into her dream
And they laughed and stamped and clapped their hands
And hollered at her, dance little Jean

And they said, dance little Jean. this day is for you
Two people you love stood up to say I do
Dance little Jean, a prayer that you had
Was answered today, your mama's marrying your dad

Well, my cynical heart just melted
'Cause I figured what this get-together meant
How it ended years of tears and sad confusion
That little girl had spent
And they told the band to pack it up
About the time the couple cut the cake
But we played as long as they stayed
For love and laughs and little Jeanie's sake

And we played dance little Jean, this day is for you
Two people you love stood up to say I do
Dance little Jean, a prayer that you had
Was answered today, your mama's marrying your dad
It was answered today, your mama's marrying your dad
