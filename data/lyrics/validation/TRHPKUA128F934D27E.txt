Slain dynamics of incarnation
Caged in anatomy
Condensed mass of energy
Constant unfolding
Passing through centuries

Confinement in the universe

Perceiving lives to come
Oncoming complications
Move through infinity
Towards slower density

And stillness begs for awakening

Descending entities
Awe-inspiring scenery

The end descending from above
Our fading cries embrace the skies
Nonhuman era has arrived
Quintessence rise and realign
Nonhuman era has arrived

We knew this day would come
Behold the constellations
Point to fatality
Dismissed as mere blasphemy

And stillness begs for awakening

Descending entities
Awe-inspiring scenery

The end descending from above
Our fading cries embrace the skies
Nonhuman era has arrived
Quintessence rise and realign
Nonhuman era has arrived
Virtue to vice, the fall and rise
Nonhuman era has arrived
This form must die to come alive
Nonhuman era- now arise!

Definite end to human incarnations
Souls realigned
Non-dual state of realization
Called to end all life
Begin the process of excarnation
End this strife
Disconnect, depart, ascend
Reversed creation

Slain are our needs for all things
And slain are our hopes, reduced to dust

Slain dynamics of incarnation
Caged in anatomy
Condensed mass of energy
And stillness begs for awakening
Constant unfolding
Passing through centuries

Our fading cries embrace the skies
Nonhuman era has arrived
Quintessence rise and realign
Nonhuman era has arrived
Virtue to vice, the fall and rise
Nonhuman era has arrived
This form must die to come alive
Nonhuman era will rise!
