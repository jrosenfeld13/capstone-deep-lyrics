He sits in the car
Walks in the park
Waits in his room as the city gets dark
He can't understand why he's falling apart
It's never too late-
It's only too hard

He locks all the doors
Pulls down the shades
He's not the same since he went away
He can't figure out what to do with his days
He's wasted his time
Now he's wasting away

He's wasting away
He's wasting away
He's wasting away
