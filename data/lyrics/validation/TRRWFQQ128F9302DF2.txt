Oh, my soul, sometimes we don't know what to do
We work so hard being tough on our own
But now it's me and you
Let's get up sad bones
'Cause we are fall on hard times
But you don't have to stand up all alone
Just put your hand in mine

Climb on a back that's strong
Yeah, you can get what you want
Climb on a back that's strong

If you could save me a place in heaven
With a clean well-lighted room
I'd muscle up to Armageddon
And wave to you darling, be home soon
If you could show me the story of love
I would write it again and again
And then you could be the woman you need
If you would just let me be the man that I am

Oh, I don't know
Sometimes we try to hard to see
But we've got one down and one more to go
That's when you say to me
