We're gonna be keeping the mystery alive
I'm telling you girl
The secret is keeping the mystery alive

It's hurry up and wait, red tape, can't escape
Mustn't be late, the school bell is ringing
Soon as we're born we're taught to conform
Don't you get above your upbringing!

But you and me girl
We'll keep the magic that we've got
In the future when we're surrounded by robots
We're gonna be

Keeping the mystery alive
I'm telling you girl
The secret is keeping the mystery alive
As you go through this world
Remember this

From nine to five you'll lose your mind
If you don't keep the mystery alive!

Television screen someone's telling me
What I should think and how I should be living
Everything's so predictable don't you know
Everyone takes more than they are giving

But you and me girl
We'll keep the magic that we've got
In the future when we're surrounded by robots
We're gonna be

Keeping the mystery alive
I'm telling you girl
The secret is keeping the mystery alive
As you go through this world
Remember this

But you and me girl
We'll keep the magic that we've got
In the future when we're surrounded by robots
We're gonna be

Keeping the mystery alive
I'm telling you girl
The secret is keeping the mystery alive
As you go through this world
Remember this

Keeping the mystery alive
I'm telling you girl
The secret is keeping the mystery alive
As you go through this world
Remember this
