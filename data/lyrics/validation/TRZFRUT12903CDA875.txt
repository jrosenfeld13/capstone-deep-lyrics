There's just one thing that I need to say
Before I close my eyes and walk away
There's just one thing that I need to feel
Before I walk away against my will

There's just one thing that I need to hear
Before I walk away for the last time
There's just one thing that I need to see
Before I take this chance and set us free

Don't forget me
Don't regret me
Don't suspend me
Don't neglect me

The memory of this still reminds me of you
The memory of this still reminds
The memory of this still reminds me of you
And that is where you'll find me

Stars in your eyes
Did you take the time to realize

Can you count the stars in your eyes?
Did you take the time to realize?

There's just one thing that I need to say
Before I walk away
There's just one thing that I need to feel
Before I walk away against my will

Don't forget me
Don't regret me
The memory of this still reminds me of you
Don't suspend me
The memory of this still reminds me
Don't neglect me
The memory of this still reminds me of you

The memory of this still reminds me
Stars in your eyes
Did you take the time to realize?
