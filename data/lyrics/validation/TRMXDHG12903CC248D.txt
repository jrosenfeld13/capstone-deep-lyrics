Fuck everything and everybody
Hypocrites and all the fakes
Leaches and the followers
Best to stay out of my way
Out of my face
Out of my way
So many times you crossed my path
With clenched fists I made my way
Force fed so many lies
You can't get ahold of me

Out of my face
Out of my way
Fuck everything you believe
Fuck what you say

So many rats in my face
You won't get the best of me
So many traps set in my way
You could never break me
