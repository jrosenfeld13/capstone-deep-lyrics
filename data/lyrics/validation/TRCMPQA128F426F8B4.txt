[Verse 1]
Don't want to study on the G.I. bill
Want more action, haven't had my fill
Mercenary, fight for anyone
Fight for money
Fight for fun

[Chorus]
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go

[Verse 2]
Got a country you want to protect
But your army is more likely to defect
Hire my SMG with a full clip
On automatic it's guaranteed hit

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Gee it's kinda scary out here
Mosquitoes are happy tonight
Mommy, Daddy, can I please come home
Even if just for one night

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Schocked how deadly we fight back
Troublemakers who attack
Mercenary, fight for anyone
Fight for money, fight for fun

[Chorus]
