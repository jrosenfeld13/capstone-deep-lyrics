I`m kicking holes in Heaven's gate
It keeps me young
And picking bones from empty plates
I'd hazard one

Acid tongue (you give me)
Acid tongue (I said Heaven)

Rehearsing lives on violins
It keeps me young
And starting fires with methalyn
I'd hazard one

Acid tongue (you give me)
Acid tongue (I said Heaven)

I'm dressing up and dropping hints
It keeps me young
I'm the passenger I'm driving in
I'd hazard one

Acid tongue (I said Heaven)
Acid tongue (I said Heaven)
Acid tongue (I said Heaven)
Acid tongue (I said Heaven)
