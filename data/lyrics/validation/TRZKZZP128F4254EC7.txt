After all these years i've never shed any tears. i'm happy just to be here drinking all your beer. it's been so long since i wrote that stupid song. i love these fucking places i get comfort from your faces. well i am what i am and we ain't what we ain't. we're way too old to change now and you'd probably hate it anyhow. after all these years we do it just for the beer
