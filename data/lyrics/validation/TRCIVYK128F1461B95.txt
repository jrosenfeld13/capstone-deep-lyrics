Oh it hurts
When your lover goes another way
I gave it up
Couldn't stand it for another day
I don't know what love is all about
I'm so confused
It's gonna take a little time
To get out of this state of mind
So come with me
We're really rollin' now
Why don't ya come with me
Move on up don't let me down
Running around
Seems the kinda thing I need
The way I feel
A cut won't even let me bleed
I have seen what pain is all about
I won't be fooled
It's gonna take a little time
To get myself out of this state of mind
So come with me
We're really rollin' now
Come with me
Move on up don't let me down
Don't want to listen to that
Silly kind of small talk
I take the middle of the street
And leave the sidewalk now
I don't care anymore anyhow
Come with me...
Still I don't know what love is all about
I'm so confused
It's gonna take a little time
It's gonna take a little while alright
So come with me...
I've had enough of all those stupid conversations
I want the things I see in my imagination now
Now I don't care anymore anyhow
So come with me...
