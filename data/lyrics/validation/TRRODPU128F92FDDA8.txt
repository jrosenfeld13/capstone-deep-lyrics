Once you were my life and breath
And you rode your free horse to death
Oh you trifled around too much
Then you lost your loving touch

Now whose shoulder will you cry on
You didn't love me all alone
'Cause you can't love and do me wrong
I don't trust you no more
So go knock on another's door
And whose shoulder will you cry on

Just let those hot tears burn your eyes
They're just payments on the line
That made a wreck of me
From that chain I've been set free
Now whose shoulder will you cry on

You didn't love me all alone...
