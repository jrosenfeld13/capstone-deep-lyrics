It's been a long time comin'
And it's good to be back
Been in a head on collision
With a medicine man
I've been down in the alley
Where the odds are stacked
Down on my knees
Had to turn back

CHANGE
CHANGE
I need a change
OH LORD
CHANGE
CHANGE
I need a change
OH LORD OH LORD

Down in a no mans land
Between sorrow and sweet
Where the devil himself
Sits on the judgement seat
Where you drown in your rain
Your wind and your sleet
When you're six feet under
Dead on you feet

CHANGE
CHANGE
I need a change
OH LORD
CHANGE
CHANGE
I need a change
OH LORD

It's got to be tough
To be so true
It's got to be even tougher
To be you
You hammer at the door
Singing "God save the Queen"
I want to leave this place

CHANGE
CHANGE
I need a change
OH LORD
CHANGE
CHANGE
I need a change
OH LORD

CHANGE
CHANGE
I need a change
OH LORD
CHANGE
CHANGE
I need a change
OH LORD

It's been a long time coming and it's good to be back
