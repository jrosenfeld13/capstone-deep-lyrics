On and on
It must be better this way
Love never dies it just fades to gray
It doesn't matter what you say

You're the only one
In this age of wisdom
Who can understand
How to turn me on

There's been so many times
Oh I wish I could go someplace
Steal a moment's grace
Talk to you face to face

I only wish we can do
The human thing

On and on
It must be better this way
Love never dies it just fades to gray
It doesn't matter what you say

I believe you
Whatever keeps pullin' me back
Is at the heart of the matter
It's a matter of fact
It must've been a love attack
Love changes nothing

I was your angel
I was you angel and you trusted me
I gave you all I had but it wasn't to be
Oh you trusted me

I tried to be like a rock for you
Everything I did I just had to do
On & on it must be better this way
Love will never die just fade to gray
Like a rock for you

It doesn't mean that I love you less
We got lost in the wilderness
Wish we could do the human thing
On & on

It must be better this way
Love never fades it just fades to gray
It doesn't matter what you say
I believe you

Whatever keeps pullin' me back
Is at the heart of the matter
It's a matter of fact
It must've been a love attack

Love changes nothing
Love changes nothing
Wish we could do the human thing
On and on

It must be better this way
Love never fades it just fades to gray
It doesn't matter what you say
I believe you

Whatever keeps pullin' me back
Is at the heart of the matter
It's a matter of fact
It must've been a love attack

Love changes nothing nothing
Took a walk in the wilderness
Doesn't mean that I love you less
That I love you less

I had to get away from this
Love changes nothing
Nothing
Nothing at all

I gave you all I had but it wasn't to be
