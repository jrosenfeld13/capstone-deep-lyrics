[Verse 1]
Marcus Garvey's words come to pass
Marcus Garvey's words come to pass
Can't get no food to eat
Can't get no money to spend, Wo-oo-oo
Can't get no food to eat
Can't get no money to spend, Woo -oo- oo
Come, little one and let me do what I can do for you
And you, and you alone
Come, little ones come, wo-oo-oo
Let me do what I can do for you, and you alone, woo-oo-oo

[Verse 2]
He who knows the right thing and do it not
Shall be spanked with many stripes
Weeping and wailing and moaning
You've got yourselves to blame, I tell you
Do right, do right, do right
Do right, do right
Tell you to do right, Woo -oo- oo
Beg you to do right, Woo -oo- oo

[Musical Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Where is Bagawire? He's nowhere to be found
He can't be found
First betrayer who gave away Marcus Garvey
Son of Satan, First prophesy
Catch them, Garvey old
Catch them Garvey, catch them Woo -oo- oo
Hold them Marcus, hold them Woo -oo- oo
Marcus Garvey, Marcus Woo -oo- oo
