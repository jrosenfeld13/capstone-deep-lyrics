Rhubarb Pie
Rhubarb Pie
It might rain tomorrow
Better get some before I die

Rhubarb Pie
Rhubarb Pie
It might rain tomorrow
Better get some before I die

Save your lemons
Get 'em up in the tree
Save your peaches
They really don't get to me
Talk about somethin' sure gonna
Make me shout
Go on get some rhubarb pie
That's what it's all about

Rhubarb Pie
Rhubarb Pie
It might rain tomorrow
Better get some before I die

Hey little mama come I walk with you
Got a hole in my pocket
Another one in my shoe
Pies in the kitchen settin'
Out the window sill
Talk about make my eyes bug out
Lord they surely will

Rhubarb Pie
Rhubarb Pie
It might rain tomorrow
Better get some before I die

Hey little mama come I walk you home
Ain't had no lovin'
Since my use-ta gal been gone
Come on in my kitchen
Lord I wish you would
Roll my eyes and shut my mouth
This rhubarb sure is good

Rhubarb Pie
Rhubarb Pie
It might rain tomorrow
Better get some before I die
