[Verse 1]
What goes on in your mind?
I think that I am falling down
What goes on in your mind?
I think that I am upside down

[Chorus]
Lady be good, do what you should
You know it'll work alright
Lady be good, do what you should
You know it'll be alright

[Verse 2]
I'm going up, I'm going down
I'm going to fly from side to side
See the bells up in the sky
Somebody's cut the string in two

[Chorus]
Lady be good, do what you should
You know it'll work alright
Lady be good, do what you should
You know it'll be alright

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
One minute born, one minute doomed
One minute up and one minute down
What goes on in your mind?
I think that I am falling down

[Chorus]
Lady be good, do what you should
You know it'll work alright
Lady be good, do what you should
You know it'll be alright
