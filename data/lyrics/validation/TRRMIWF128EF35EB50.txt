Vampires are alive
Vampires are alive
The legends have to survive
We'll never come undone
And we will be forever young

Vampires get alive

I am a vampire, I'm a slave
I sleep through the daylight, hence my grave
In the darkness, in the shadows  here I am
(Here I am)

I want you to be forever mine
Together until the end of time
Like a nightmare never ending
Let me change your world

Vampires are alive
The legends have to survive
We'll never come undone
And we will be forever young

Vampires are alive
(And we will be forever young)
Vampires, vampires are alive
(And we will be forever young)

Tonight is the night, live a thousand years
Don't be scared, don't drown in tears
Free your spirit after midnight, sell your soul
(Let it go)

From heaven to hell, enjoy the ride
You're here to surrender with your life
Precious victims, my desire, live eternally

Vampires are alive
The legends have to survive
We'll never come undone
And we will be forever young

Vampires are alive
(And we will be forever young)
Vampires, vampires are alive
(And we will be forever young)

(Vampires) are alive
Vampires are alive
(Vampires)
