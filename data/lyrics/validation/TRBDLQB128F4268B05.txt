Death rides and the old man cries, where on earth can we hide?
This transformation he fears, he knows not where he'll end
Will he burn in hell and rot, damned for eternity
Or will he re-incarnate once more and face this life again?

(Chorus)
Metamorphosis, a necessary transformation
A halfway point 'tween dusk and dawn
Death comes and the wise man sings
A glorious day has arrived
This transformation he welcomes
He'll fly to the other side
He knows he'll not rot in the crypt
Worm food for eternity
Death is not the end he knows
But a time when the soul is free

(Chorus)
Cast In The Abyss what waits for thee?
New life beginning or re-incarnate eternally?
Will you find the answer before your time?
You're on your way, don't know what you'll find
The gods have your answers but they're not in your mind
Swers before your time?
You're on your way, don't know what you'll find
The gods have your answers but they're not in your mind
