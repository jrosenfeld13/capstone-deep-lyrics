I may not know
Just where you are
But there is a place to go
From here
The dark's been long
And all you hopes seem dim
Shacked by fragment of you fear
So when life's giving out on you
There is love to come rescue you

And you will find your tomorrow
Oh life's not in vain keep the faith
And you will get to the water
And taste the golden rain
Swept away in his sweet embrace

The gentle truth falling on wounded hearts
Sending the light into the dark
You face the fears talking to angry ears
Feeling no one knows who you are
There is joy in a wounded song
There is love that will lead you on

CHORUS
