Don't give up your dreams

Baby, let it be, let it be
Baby, baby, let it be, let it be
Baby, baby, let it be, let it be
Baby, baby, let it be

Baby, let it be
Baby, let it be, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Come on baby, let it be)

Tell me that you know what you're doing
Show me that you keep control
You say that's the way that you choose it
'Cause you want to free your soul
But you do what you do when you're playin' with fire
Don't burn your hands as you're takin' a chance
You're on a trip to get higher and higher
Baby, can't you see?

Baby, let it be, let it be
Baby, baby, let it be, let it be
Baby, baby, let it be, let it be
Baby, baby, let it be

Baby, let it be
(Come on baby, let it be)
Baby, let it be, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Come on baby, let it be)

As you think you can't be wrong
Feelin' cool and feeling strong
In the long run you will lose
And it's not the way to choose
Check your style and turn back
Live your life on the right track
Life is precious, don't you break it
If you get a chance, then take it

But you do what you do when you're playin' with fire
Don't burn your hands, as you're takin' a chance
You're on a trip to get higher and higher
Baby, can't you see?

Baby, let it be, let it be
Baby, baby, let it be, let it be
Baby, baby, let it be, let it be
Baby, baby, let it be

Baby, let it be
(Come on baby, let it be)
Baby, let it be, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Come on baby, let it be)

Baby, let it be, let it be
Baby, baby, let it be, let it be
Baby, baby, let it be, let it be
Baby, baby, let it be

Baby, let it be
(Come on baby, let it be)
Baby, let it be, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Come on baby, let it be)
