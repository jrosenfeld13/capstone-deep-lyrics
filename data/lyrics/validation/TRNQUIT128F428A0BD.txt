[Verse 1]
Whenever I look back
On the best days of my life
I think I saw them all on TV
I am so homesick now
For someone that I never knew
I am so homesick
For some place I will never be

[Hook]
Time won't let me go
Time won't let me go
If I could do it all again
I'd go back and change everything but
Time won't let me go

[Verse 2]
I never had a "Summer of '69"
Never had a Cherry Valence of my own
All these precious moments
You promised me would come in time
So where was I when I missed mine?

[Hook]
Time won't let me go
Time won't let me go
If you gave me back those years
I'd do it all better I swear
Time won't let me go

Ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba
Ba ba

[Bridge]
If I could go back once again
I would change everything, yeah
If I could go back once again
I'd do it all so much better

[Hook]
Time won't let me go
Time won't let me go
If I could do it all again
I'd go back and change everything
But you won't ever let me go, oh

Ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba
Ba ba
