[Verse 1]
Watch your mouth, hold your tongue boy
Because you're running out of breath
Running out of time before every careless word
That you utter, renders you utterly useless
Now you're drowning in your own saliva
Trying to speak yourself to the top of your empty world
Well keep on talking, just keep on rambling
You've got your mouth full

[Bridge? 1]
Listen, here's the pleasant part
You and I, we fell apart
Listen, here's the pleasant part
You and I, we fell apart (continues...)

[Chorus 1] [x2]
Why can't you make up your mind?

[Verse 2]
Shut your mouth, burn your bridges
Throw your words like an attack and
Stab me in the, wait a second, wait a second
What's that I just heard? Nevermind
It's obviously worthless
Now you're standing on your soapbox
Yelling from the rooftops
Everything you say is a lie
A lie, a lie, lie, lie, yeah

[Bridge 2?]
Listen, here's the clever one
Who speaks before his thoughts are done
Listen, here's the clever one
Who speaks before his thoughts are done (continues...)

[Chorus 1] [x2]

[Chorus 2] [x2]
Watch your mouth, hold your tongue
Somethings are better left unsaid

[Verse 3]
Now I hope you're pleased
You got your prize and tongue
I dance between your words
Right before you fall
Right before you...
Why don't you? Why don't you say that to my face?
I had a rip down, torn out so many things
Everything you, every time you, every word you say
If I told you this was killing me, would you? Would you stop?
