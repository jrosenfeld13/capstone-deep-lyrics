Big business ain't easy
I'm sure you'd agree
Especially when the product is eternity-
To stay one step ahead we must achieve
And turn this holy temple
Into a factory
Is there anywhere you can run
To hide from these thieves' -
Cause eternity's on sale today for a fee

Faith is buying me away
Buying me a way
To convert the masses into little servants
Faith is buying me away
Buying me a way
Buying me into your home (soul)

Our sanctuary of this high-rise
Our steeples our billboards
Our slogans our converts
Oh don't forget to buy this T-shirt
As you leave
And open up the offering box
And give until it hurts
Show me an open heart and we'll steal it away
Cause eternity's on up for sale for a small fee today
You Know

This altar is a stage
Our sponsor must be paid
And maybe even make the front page
