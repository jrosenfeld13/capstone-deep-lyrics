Are you sleeping my baby?
Just close your eyes and let me run away
Now, don't cha cry
I am leaving my sweet baby
I've been in love with one who's far away
I can't live a lie
I've got something inside of me you know I can't hide
And each day since I left her
She's been on my mind
So take care of yourself and my, my Ricky besides
He's the best friend I had
I guess this is good-bye

Are you weeping my baby?
I let you down but I just cannot stay
I can't live a lie
Now I am leaving my sweet baby
I got my ticket, it won't pass me by
I can't live a lie
I've got something inside of me you know I can't hide
And each day since I left her
She's been on my mind
So take care of yourself and my, my Ricky besides
He's the best friend I had
I guess this is good-bye
This is good bye
I guess this is goodbye
