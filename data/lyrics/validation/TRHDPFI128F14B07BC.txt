I never dreamed I would be like this
But now I found out just how much I have missed

My baby wants me
And it feeds me, and it calls me
Every night
And he holds me when I'm crying
Just to show me it's all right

I never dreamed I would be like this
I never dreamed I would be like this
I never dreamed
No, I never dreamed

He tells me I'm pretty and then I feel pretty
He says I make him happy
And that makes me happy

Each time I see him I feel like we're closer than before
And I find out new reasons to love him even more

I never dreamed I would be like this
I never dreamed I would be like this
I never dreamed I would be like this
I never dreamed I would be like this
