As you know
I was the king of rock'n roll
I played guitar, yes, with my soul
But I just can't remember
How to do it now
I'll sing for you just a little bit
Of Ska
I'll be the new king of Ska
I'll be the new king of Ska

As you can see
Something is changing around me
Even my smile
Is changing style
Now I know I remember
What to do because
Yes, I've got the groove
Which is making me move

I am now the new king of Ska
I am now the new king of Ska
I am now the new king of Ska
I am now the new king of Ska

My music
My music
My music

Till the end
I was the famous one man band
They've changed my smile
They've changed my style

I am now the new king of Ska
I am now the new king of Ska
I am now the new king of Ska
I am now the new king of Ska
..the new king of Ska!
