Every night, to take a walk on high to see
The shadows of the moonlight, when this guy
Began to follow me, and now you see

Thats the trouble

Then he turned my head, to my surprise
He stared so seriously, in my eyes and said
"Why, I'd like for you to come on home woth me."

Thats the trouble
Every man I see, thats the trouble
Taking every little thing so heavily
Thats the trouble if you wanna' let you be
Thats the trouble if you really wanna' be free

When I did not realise, he was the
Serious type of guy, and I ran his [?]
And said "Will you marry me?"

Thats the trouble
Every man I see, thats the trouble
Taking every little thing so heavily
Thats the trouble if you wanna' let you be
Thats the trouble if you really wanna' be free
