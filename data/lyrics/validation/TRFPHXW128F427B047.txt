Gone today, to the coast of San Jose
With the money that I made
Sold the rights to my play
Run to the beach
Where the salty air is sweet
Dance on the shore
Cos the ocean is the cure
Lost my name in the grain of the sand
No worries still remain, let the water keep you sane
Run to the beach
Where the salty air is sweet
Dance on the shore
Cos the ocean is the cure
And I wonder as time rolls by
After midnight the thunder is nice
Run to the beach
Where the salty air is sweet
Dance on the shore
Cos the ocean is the cure
And I wonder as time rolls by
After midnight the thunder is nice
