Make believe you're in a jungle movie
Watch the baby elephants go by
The beat is groovy
It's a brand new dance you ought to try
Come to the jungle and see the animal attraction
Baby elephants in action walk

See the big baboon beat on the bongo
As the baby elephants advance
Down in the Congo
All the swinging monkeys do this dance

Come to the jungle and see the animal attraction
Baby elephants in action walk

If you plan on joining a safari
Don't get dressed for going on a cruise
The thing to carry is an extra pair of dancing shoes
Come to the jungle and see the animal attraction
Baby elephants in action walk
