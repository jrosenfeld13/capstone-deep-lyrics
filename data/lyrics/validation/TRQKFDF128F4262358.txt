And even if it's easy to be free
What's your definition of freedom?
And who the fuck are you, anyway?
Who the fuck are they?
Who the fuck am I to say?
What the fuck is really going on?
How did the cat get so fat?
Why does the family die?
Do you care why?
'Cause there hasn't been a sign
Of anything gettin' better
In the ghetto
People's fed up
But they get up
You point you're fuckin' finger
You racist, you bigot
That's not the problem, now is it?
It's all about the money political power is taking
Protectin' the rich, denying the poor
Yeah you love to watch the world from the white house and I wonder

How can they sleep at night?
How can they sleep at night?
How did the cat get so fat?
How did the cat get so fat?
How did the cat get so fat?
How did the cat get so fat?
