I sit right here baby, baby, and sit down on my knee
Yes, right here darlin', baby, and sit down on my knee
I want to tell you babe
Abut the way you're treatin' me

You're the mean mistreater darlin'
And you don't mean no man no good
Yes, a mean mistreater
And you don't mean no man no good
Yes, I'm going to quit you darlin'
And live like a wise man should

Yes, I'm going away to leave you darlin', babe
And your cryin' won't make me stay
Well, I'm going away to leave you, baby
And your cryin' won't make me stay
Yes, I'm gonna leave you darlin'
Some day you will change your way
