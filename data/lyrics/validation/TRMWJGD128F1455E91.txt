Well I met her out at Murphy's
Resturaunt, She said she was
Fresh from the farm. And I remember
Thinkin' for a country girl, That she
Went pretty well armed
We sat there talkin by the lobster
Tank I ordered her a sloe gin fizz
And when them chicken fried streaks arrived
She said "I like livin like this..."

[Chorus]
So I made her the Queen of my double
Wide trailer with the polyester Curtains and
The red wood deck, now she's run off and I've
Got to trail her, dang her black heart and her pretty
Redneck

Well a few nights later I run into her
With some stranger on a park bench
She said he rebuilds engines and his
Name is Earl, He's the Charlie Daniels of
The Torque Wrench. I whispered honey let's just
Go on home and and have some onion rings and
Watch T.V. And as I walked her to the truck
Earl was cryin "Don't you leave me"

[Chorus]

I told him this is the Queen of my double
Wide trailer with the polyester Curtains and
The red wood deck, sometimes she runs and I've
Got to trail her, dang her black heart and her pretty
Redneck
I said this is the Queen of my double
Wide trailer with the polyester Curtains and
The red wood deck, sometimes she runs and I've
Got to trail her, dang her black heart and her pretty
Redneck
I said this is the Queen of my double
Wide trailer with the polyester Curtains and
The red wood deck, sometimes she runs and I've
Got to trail her, dang her black heart and her pretty
Redneck

She's the queen
She's the queen
