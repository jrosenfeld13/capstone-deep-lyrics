Unter Null
The Failure Epiphany
Destroy Me
I know you despise me
But what can I do?
You once said you loved me
I took it as truth
I know you'd destroy me
With your very first hit
But it's already done
I'm too scared to admit
The mindgames are timeless
The angish won't end
I've tried to repair the things that won't mend
The heartbreak is caustic
The rancour lays deep
I thought I would fight the battle so steep
I know you resent me
With my every breath
I'm sorry, I'm trying
I'd fight to the death
I know you ignore me
To punish my past
To tarnish my future
I thought it would last
You'll take no more
I'll rise from it all
You'll see that I'm not who I was anymore
You can't tear me down
You can't bring me pain
I will never be the martyr again
