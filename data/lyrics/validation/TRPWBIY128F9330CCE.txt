If you were gone tomorrow
What would I do then
If this is it and I who thought that when
I saw you next I should say I need you
Simply 'cos I do
And you should know

If you were gone tomorrow
What would I do then
If this is it and I who thought that when
I saw you next I should say I love you
Simply 'cos I love you
And you should know

I would have been a fool if I, fool if I
Lost you either way
I would have been lost if I, lost if I left you
I'll stay
Now I know
I've learned from mistakes

If you were gone tomorrow
What would I do then
We think there's lots of time
We have enough of time

I would have been a fool if I, fool if I
Lost you either way
I would have been lost if I, lost if I left you
I'll stay
Now I know
I've learned from mistakes
