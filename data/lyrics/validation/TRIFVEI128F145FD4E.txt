YOU'RE A KNIFE TO HIS GUN
WHEN YOU'RE BORED
HE'S OUT HAVING FUN

YOU'RE ALWAYS ON THE LOOKOUT
AND HE'S A STAR
YOU STRUGGLE WITH DO'S
AND WHO THE HELL YOU ARE

SO C'MON - C'MON YOU WANNA GET ON
IF YOU ONLY KNEW
YOU'RE A GIVER HE'S A GETTER
JUST ALITTLE BIT BETTER THAN YOU

HE'S A DOCTOR
YOU'RE A NURSE
HE'S GOT UNBOUNCED CHECKS
YOU GOT AN EMPTY PURSE

HE'S A HUNDRED AND TEN
WHEN YOU GOT A HUNCH
HE'S A FIVE STAR KING
AND YOU'RE OUT TO LUNCH

SO C'MON - C'MON YOU WANNA GET ON
IF YOU ONLY KNEW
YOU'RE A GIVER HE'S A GETTER
JUST A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN YOU

HE'S PILING TROPHIES
YOU'RE ON THE HUNT
HE'S OF ROYAL DESCENT
YOU'RE A BONAFIDE RUNT

HE'S THE DON OF YOUR
HUMILIATION
WHILE YOU PAINT IT PINK
HE CRANKS BROWNSVILLE STATION

SO C'MON - C'MON YOU WANNA GET ON
AND IF YOU ONLY KNEW
YOU'RE A GIVER HE'S A GETTER
GOTTA GIVE IT SO YOU'LL GET IT
JUST A - JUST A
JUST A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN YOU

OH YEAH
