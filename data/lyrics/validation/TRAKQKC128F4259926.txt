Pretty thing, sweet as rain on a hot summer day
I want you
Pretty thing, I don't pray but to you I will pray
I want you
Let's take a walk together
It's quiet down by the river
Come on now, come on now, come on now

Pretty pretty give yourself to me
Pretty pretty give yourself to me
Pretty pretty give yourself to me
Come on

Pretty thing, you're so young
I see you blowing bubble gum and I want you
Pretty thing, when you smile I say hey little child
I want you
Give me your vows come with me
Open your mouth and kiss me
Come on now, come on now, come on now

Repeat Chorus

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
