Should be missing you
Sat on a chair
And I stared at the wall
Memories of you
I couldn't recall
They say that the first love
Is the one that you dream of
But everything comes to an end

I was blind for so long
Realised I was wrong
And now I can see

I should be missing you now
But my heart is in another place
I kept on fooling myself
And nobody else
I am feeling shame
It's just a game
(should be missing you)
It's just a game
(should be missing you)

You always said that
I knew right from wrong
And how my heart
Would beat so strong
And I'm feeling a yearning
But I guess I'm just learning
All the tricks of the trade

I was blind for so long
Realised I was wrong
And now I can see

I should be missing you now
But my heart is in another place
I kept on fooling my self
And nobody else
I am feeling shame
It's just a game
(should be missing you)
It's just a game
(should be missing you)

Be missing you now
But my heart is in another place
I kept on fooling myself
And nobody else
I am feeling shame

I should be missing you now
But my heart is in another place
I kept on fooling myself
And nobody else
I am feeling shame
It's just a game
(should be missing you)
It's just a game
(should be missing you)
It's just a game
It's just a game
(should be missing you)
It's just a game..(fade out)
