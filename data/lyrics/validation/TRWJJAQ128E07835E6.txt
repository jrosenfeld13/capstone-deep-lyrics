Always seem to get things wrong
I waited here a bit too long
For you to come along to me

I thought that I would kiss your lips
But the sky went dark and the moon eclipsed
And what I missed is all that I can see

Now I'm stuck here looking back
At where I lost the thread
So ashamed here thinking back
At how I lost my head

Way back when the world was young
Long before this song was sung
I know someone must have hurt like me

Now I'm stuck here looking back
At where I lost the thread
So ashamed here thinking back
At how I lost my head

Way back when the world was young
Long before this song was sung
I know someone must have hurt like me
