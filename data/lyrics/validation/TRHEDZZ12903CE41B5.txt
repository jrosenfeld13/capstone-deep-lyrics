Well, I wish I could tell somebody
'Bout the way I feel today
Wish I could pack my leavin' trunk
And make my getaway

There's nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
Well I ain't goin' home no more
My feet, they feel so slow

Well I go to a downtown party
I feel like leavin' soon
There ain't nobody seem to know my name
But a great big hollow moon

There's nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
Well I ain't goin' home no more
My feet, they feel so slow

Well I was lookin' for some friend now
Since the day that I arrived
I wish somebody would call my name
And make me know that I'm alive

There's nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
Well I ain't goin' home no more
My feet, they feel so slow
They feel so slow

Well, I wish I could tell somebody
'Bout the way I feel today
I wish I could pack my leavin' trunk
And make my get away

There's nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
Well I ain't goin' home no more
My feet, they feel so slow
