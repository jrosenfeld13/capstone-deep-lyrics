Concentrate at the back of my classroom
You should try harder
You should be better
You failed
So listen up
It's about destruction
You're going to pay
You're going to scream out loud
I can see the dying
I can do the numbers
Everyone will have ice cream
And there'll be stars
So now we're mad
You say you hold up the future world
People they're not stupid
We both can scream out loud
I can see the dying
I can do the numbers
Everyone will have ice cream
And there'll be stars
I took the lead
It's about destruction
I can hear you scream
I hear you shout out loud
So remember
That i'm the teacher
So remember
I'll remember
I can see the dying
I can do the numbers
Everyone will have ice cream
And there'll be stars
There'll be stars
There'll be stars
There'll be...
