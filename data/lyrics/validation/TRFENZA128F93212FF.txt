Who will comfort the fucked-up girl?
Feed her wine and bread?
Who will quiet the multitudes that live under her bed?

Who will marry the fucked up girl?
Read to her impassioned verse?
She speaks a thousand tongues all of them in reverse

She will kiss you like galaxies colliding
She will cut your hair and hide it in her closet

Who will sleep with the fucked up girl?
Share her bed with porcupines?
She dreams of steam shovels, a cactus grows out of her spine
