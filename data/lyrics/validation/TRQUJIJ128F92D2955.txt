[Music: Memory Garden, R. Gustafsson]

Embrace the darkness and light will grow inside of you
Enjoy the sadness - In a time of sorrow, joy will do

I keep on dreaming of good and evil every night
And for a moment the dreams become my guiding light

I'm led astray by anger - I look inside for clues
I'm lost within my own mind - I've lost the right to choose

It cannot go much faster, but still the speed increase
There is no use to fight it - I fall onto my knees

What's the point, what will we learn, how do we know which way to go
We've passed the point of no return how do we know which way to go

Our precious values were lost along this winding road
We feed the fire - not aware it will soon explode

A lifeless face stares back at mine in every mirror
I see no trace of what the future has in store

A deadly race heading straight
Into the deep oblivion
I stand amazed and wonder
What's behind the door?

What's the point, what will we learn, how do we know which way to go
We've passed the point of no return we have to ask ourselves
Do we really want to know, do we really want to know?
