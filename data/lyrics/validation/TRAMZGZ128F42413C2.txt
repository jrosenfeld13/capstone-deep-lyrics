[Verse 1]
Time has come, take my stand
Show the world who I am
I've been waiting so long
For this day to come
On my own, I'll survive
Leave the past all behind

[Hook]
Reach out, as far as you can see
Reach out, and fulfill your dreams
Reach out, as far as you can see
Reach out, and fulfill your dreams

[Verse 2]
People say it won't last
Time will tell, I don't care
Having faith in my dream
And I know what it means
Make the right sacrifice
Make the [?] in my life
Never doubt, hold it down
On my own, feeling strong

[Hook]
Reach out, as far as you can see
Reach out, and fulfill your dreams
Reach out, as far as you can see
Reach out, and fulfill your dreams

[Saxophone Solo]

[Verse 3]
Time has come, take my stand
Show the world who I am
I've been waiting so long
For this day to come
On my own, I'll survive
Leave the past far behind
