He said to me "come body sing"
I say to you "my body's singing"
Whose body sings? My body's singing
Whose body sings? My body's singing
I've seen it all, I lived here too
There's nothing wide across the street
Grandmother born as I get in
Grandmother died, she lived here too, shut that door

If there's a face then I will come today
Hang on to your mother or she might go away
Whose body sings? My body's singing
Whose body sings? My body's singing
I seen it all, they form a child
From back to front it's not too good
Divide it over, much more to do
The city laughs much more then I do

Fall asleep for years, been too much here
Lets see why we are driving on the streets
Reality is all grown up now
I'm looking up my old friends now

Shut that door right on my face
Shut that door, you ain't going no place
I seen it all from back to front
Just pass it down and I won't need to get old

I seen it all, I lived here too
There's nothing wide across the road
Grandmother born as I get in
Grandmother died, she lived here too

Shut that door, gonna fall on my face
Shut that door, you ain't going no place
She said to me "come body sing"
I say to you "my body's singing"
He said to me "my body's singing"
She said to me "come body sing"
I say to you "my body's singing"

Hit by the waist, my body's singing
I got a wound, all up and away
If there's a road, then there has to be a place
If this is a time, then we've got some time to waste
If there's a road, then there has to be a place
If this is a time, then we've got some time to waste
