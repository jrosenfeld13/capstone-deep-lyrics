Day 'n' nite
I toss and turn, I keep stressin' my mind, mind
I look for peace, but see, I don't attain
What I need for keeps' this silly game we play, game we p-p-play

Now look at this
Madness to magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run, but see, I'm not that fast
I think I'm first but surely finish last, finish l-l-last

'Cause day 'n' nite
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite
He's all alone through the day 'n' nite
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite, a-a-at nite

Day 'n' nite
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite, a-a-at nite

A-a-at nite
A-a-at nite

A-a-at nite
A-a-at nite

Hold the phone
The lonely stoner, Mr. Solo Doe Low
He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shade
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made

The pain is deep
A silent sleeper you won't hear a peep, peep
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too
It seems the feelings that she had are through, thr-r-rough

'Cause day 'n' nite
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite
He's all alone through the day 'n' nite
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite, a-a-at nite

Day 'n' nite
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite, a-a-at nite

A-a-at nite
A-a-at nite

A-a-at nite
A-a-at nite
A-a-at nite
A-a-at nite

A-a-at nite
A-a-at nite
A-a-at nite
