[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Lime and limpid green
A second scene
A fight between the blue you once knew
Floating down, the sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania
Neptune, Titan
Stars can frighten

[Verse 2]
Blinding signs flap
Flicker, flicker, flicker blam. Pow, pow
Stairway scare Dan Dare whos there?

[Verse 3]
Lime and limpid green, the sounds surrounds
The icy waters under
Lime and limpid green, the sounds surrounds
The icy waters underground
