Don't even say it, baby
'Cause your words cut like a knife
Don't even think it, baby
'Cause I can read everything in your mind

You just don't know how much I'll miss you
Maybe a thousand years or more
So don't tell me that you're leaving
Don't you walk out that door

There's no bridge I wouldn't cross
There's no river that's too wide
If you leave me, I would search for you, baby
Nothin' could keep me away

Don't you deny it, baby
Holding back love can cause you real pain
This is our one chance
So don't lose it, baby

Here comes the rest of your life once again
We gotta grab this with both hands
And we should never let it go, now we've got each other
Oh, I want the world to know

There's no bridge I wouldn't cross
There's no river that's too wide
If you leave me I would search for you, baby
Nothin' could keep me away

And I'll succeed at any cost
There's no bridge I wouldn't cross
All I want is just to be with you, baby
Hold you once again in my arms

Somebody told me, boy
You've got so much to learn
But they didn't know I heard all the lyin'
Done all my cryin', now it's got to be my turn

There's no bridge I wouldn't cross
There's no river that's too wide
If you leave me I would search for you, baby
Nothin' could keep me away

And I'll succeed at any cost
'Cause there's no bridge I wouldn't cross
All I want is just to be with you, baby
Hold you once again in my arms

There's no bridge I wouldn't cross
There's no river that's too wide
If you leave me I would search for you, baby
Nothin' could keep me away

And I'll succeed at any cost
'Cause there's no bridge I wouldn't cross
All I want is just to be with you, baby
Hold you once again in my arms
