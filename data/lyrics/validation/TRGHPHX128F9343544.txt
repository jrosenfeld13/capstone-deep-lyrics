On the corner of 5th and main
By an old riverbed and a railroad train
There's a shop near the track
The owner works in the back
He's got a hole in his shirt, a hole in his shoe
He walks around without a whole lot to do
He's got no car, he's got no clothes
Does what he does
And that's all he knows

Coz he's a donut man
He's doin' what he can
He's happy every day
He's got nothin' to lose
He's found his way
He's a donut man
He's doin' what he can
He's happy every day
He's got nothin' to lose
He's found his way

For at least ten years and a day
He's been going in and out of his way
To give what he's got
The lord knows he gives a lot
With his fortune made and money down
The gifts he gives are all over town
On his face a beautiful smile
He's sending out all the while

Coz he's a donut man
He's doin' what he can
He's happy every day
He's got nothin' to lose
He's found his way
He's a donut man
He's doin' what he can
He's happy every day
He's got nothin' to lose
He's found his way

His children grew up and he grew old
His hands got shakey and his shop got sold
Now many lies and the story's been told
There ain't nothing left but a donut hole

Coz he's a donut man
He's doin' what he can
He's happy every day
He's got nothin' to lose
He's found his way
He's a donut man
He's doin' what he can
He's happy every day
He's got nothin' to lose
He's found his way

Donut man
Donut man
Donut man
