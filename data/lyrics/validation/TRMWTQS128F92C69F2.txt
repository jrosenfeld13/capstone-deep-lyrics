Never knew someone could make me feel
Like you do, 'cause it's true
You got me prayin' that this love is real
All I need, is you with me
'Cause there's something 'bout the way you smile I like
Something I don't know
I'd give anything to be with you tonight
'cause I can't let go

All I wanna do is get with you
Take a little time get next to you
Let's get it on, let's get it on
All I want now is you and me
You and I are meant to be
Let's get it on, let's get it on

So many times I've looked into your eyes
And all I see, is the love for me
But if you took some time to realise
You could be, the one for me baby
'Cause there's something 'bout the way you smile I like
Something I don't know
I'd give anything to be with you tonight
'Cause I can't let go

You be the honey that I never could forget
And got me trippin' out, you got me thinkin' we were set
I thought that we would always be together you and me
Remember thinking that you've got to be my destiny
Can't you see that I know that I was wrong in what I did
But if you take me back I know that we could try again
And I'm gonna keep on calling keep on hitting with my charms
Until the day you finally take me back into your arms
Take it back now

'Cause there's something 'bout the way you smile I like
Something I don't know
I'd give anything to be with you tonight
'cause I can't let go
