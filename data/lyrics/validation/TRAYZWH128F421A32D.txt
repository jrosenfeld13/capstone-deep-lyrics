My discipline will make your teeth shake
Your restraint gets a laugh track
Accolades for staunch ardor
Reparations for heedful orders
It's funny I don't feel like a winner
Weighted spoils for small steppers
Here's a trophy for atrophy
Chastened humility
We're the fretful and the overwrought
Our pre-planning is your after thought
Limitless capacities
Close to the vest without cruelty
It's funny I don't feel like a winner
Weighted spoils for small steppers
Here's a trophy for atrophy
Chastened humility
It's funny I don't feel like a winner
Weighted spoils for small steppers
Here's a trophy for atrophy
Chastened humility
Hopefully we'll get trophies in the end
