I've seen it in your eyes
And I've heard it in your voice
The way you speak my name
Tells me there's no doubt
That the dream that i held on for
Will be everlasting

You know poverty
Can be romantic
In black and white
It looks like art
Just as long as we're together
I couldn't care less

We've got
Harmony and understanding
It's love for the first time
Like the morning sun that's breaking
Giving out that special light

True love
True love
We've got true love
True love

We've laid the right foundations
And we've built our love on trust
No one can tear the walls down
That surrounds us
We've got
Harmony and understanding
It's love for the first time
Like the morning sun that's breaking
Giving out that special light

True love
True love
We've got true love
True love

Now I'm certain of the future
We've got
Harmony and understanding
It's love for the first time
Like the morning sun that's breaking
Giving out that special light

True love
True love
We've got true love
True love

You can't buy a faithful heart
Or true love
