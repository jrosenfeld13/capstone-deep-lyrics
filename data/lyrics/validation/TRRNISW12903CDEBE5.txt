Another way, another road
Another act, another show
Another love, another dream
Another song for us to sing

There you are, here I am
What can I do to make you mine?
It'd be so nice to be with you
To spend the night

On the road, on the road
On the road again
On the road, on the road
On the road again

We're on the road, on the road
On the road again
On the road, on the road
On the road again

Here we go!

Another way, another road
Another act, another show
Another love, another dream
Another song for us to sing

Give me your time, give me your love
To get me ready to be yours
It'd be so nice to be with you
To spend the night

On the road, on the road
On the road again
On the road, on the road
On the road again

We're on the road, on the road
On the road again
On the road, on the road
On the road again

Here we go!

Another way, another road
Another act, another show
Another love, another dream
Another song for us to sing

There you are, here I am
What can I do to make you mine?
It'd be so nice to be with you
To spend the night

On the road, on the road
On the road again
On the road, on the road
On the road again

We're on the road, on the road
On the road again
On the road, on the road
On the road again

Here we go!

Road, road
On the road again
Road, road
On the road again

Road, road
On the road again
Road, road
On the road again

Road, road
On the road again
Road, road
On the road again

Road, road
On the road again
Road, road
On the road again

Come on, come on, come on, ooohooo
Come on, come on, come on, ooohooo

On the road, on the road
On the road again
On the road, on the road
On the road again

We're on the road, on the road
On the road again
On the road, on the road
On the road again

Then we go!

Come on, come on, come on, ooohooo
Come on, come on, come on, ooohooo

On the road, on the road
On the road again
On the road, on the road
On the road again

We're on the road, on the road
On the road again
