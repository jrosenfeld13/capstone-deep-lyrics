[Verse 1]
Colour me your colour, baby
Colour me your car
Colour me your colour, darling
I know who you are
Come up off your colour chart
I know where you are coming from

[Chorus]
Call me (call me) on the line
Call me, call me any, anytime
Call me (call me) I'll arrive
You can call me any day or night
Call me

[Verse 2]
Cover me with kisses, baby
Cover me with love
Roll me in designer sheets
I'll never get enough
Emotions come, I don't know why
Cover up love's alibi

[Chorus]
Call me (call me) on the line
Call me, call me any, anytime
Call me (call me) I'll arrive
You can call me any day or night
Call me

[Bridge]
Aah, he speaks the languages of love
Aah, amore chiamami
Ooh, appelle-moi mon cherie
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere, anyway
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere, any day

[Outro]
Call me my love
Call me, call me any, any anytime
Call me for a ride
Call me, call me for some overtime

Call me in my life
Call me, call me in a sweet design
Call me, call me for your lover's, lover's alibi
Call me, call me, call me
