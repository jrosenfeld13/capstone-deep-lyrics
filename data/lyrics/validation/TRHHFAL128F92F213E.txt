She said, ?I like just lying on the bed
Beneath the ceiling with her head upon my pillow
There's nothing else I'd rather do?

And I said, ?I'd rather do it on the couch or in the kitchen
Where about you seem so down, child
Like nothing could destroy your world?

But I never ever wanted to
You would never ever let me to
I would but you must wait until it gets dark

So what is it that you want me to?
Well, I can make it if it's good for you
So play me a song from 1954

Before rock'n'roll
Yeah, before rock'n'roll
Before rock'n'roll

Well, later she came with flowers in her arms
Said, ?We can do it in the car
My brother owns it
The driver seat is made for us?

And I said, ?I'd rather grab a bite to eat
There is a diner down the street
Let's take it easy and join this lovely harmony"

But I never ever wanted to
You would never ever let me to
I would but you must wait until it gets dark

So what is it that you want me to?
I can make it if it's good for you
So play me a song from 1954

Before rock'n'roll
Yeah, before rock'n'roll
Before rock'n'roll
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Before rock'n'roll
Before rock'n'roll
Before rock'n'roll
Before rock'n'roll

Before rock'n'roll
Before rock'n'roll
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Before rock'n'roll
Long before rock'n'roll

Before rock'n'roll
Before rock'n'roll
Before rock'n'roll
Yeah, yeah, yeah
