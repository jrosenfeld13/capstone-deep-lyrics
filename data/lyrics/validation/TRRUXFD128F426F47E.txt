24/7 we'll be makin' love
I'll take it down, that's if you want me too

(Girl) Don't you get scared
I'm gonna take my time
Whatever it takes I gotta make you mine
It's getting late save a thing for J
Let me love you my ghetto love way, yeah

Baby, 2 weeks ago I met* you at that party
You was knockin' by and rockin' lookin' my way
Standin' at the bar sippin Bacardi
I was tempted (Tempted) to slide across the floor
To drop my digits
Then you looked and turned away
Like you weren't with it
But I knew in my heart that I
Could rip it, girl I'm gifted...
What you wanna do

Repeat 1

Stop frontin' it's time to give a
Nigga what he wantin'
You know I got that flavor
Don't you want it? (Don't you want it)
While I'm lookin' in your eyes
And you kissin' on my lips
Girl I'm rubbin' on your thighs
You got me slippin' (slippin')
So fine at times you got a nigga chicken, yeah
So all I wanna do is
What you wanna do
While you persist on frontin'
I got's to tell the truth

Repeat 1

(Flippin' up) Stop the fake keep it real
What's the deal (Wanna tear it up)
You know just where a man
Ain't trying it right for you
(Wanna wipe it up) Slide up to my crib
That's where I penetrate (Wanna tear it up)
Chardonnay by the fire place you ridin' (Wanna wipe it up)
JaJa's gonna freak you know
How you want it girl (Gonna tear it up)
Gonna put in work until you see the sun
Come up (Gonna whip it up)
Hands up in my back
She tight like that
That's all I really want
Tell me can you handle that?
