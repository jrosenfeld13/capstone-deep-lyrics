Hey beautiful, you think you have me fooled?
But i know you're game
Like the pretty face it hides behind
It's time you learn this world isn't yours

You waltz around
Room to room
Looking, searching
You waltz around room to room
Looking for a bed to find worship in
But you're not going to find any worship here

You knocked on my door too many times
I've heard your screams from the other room
Your motives are as pure as the body you pass around

You call this love, but we both know
That it is damned to the end
I hope you learn this world isn't yours
