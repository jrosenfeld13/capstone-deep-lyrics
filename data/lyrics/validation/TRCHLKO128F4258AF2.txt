Each and everyone a comin' my day
Each and everyone a comin' my day
And I wonder why
And I wonder why
Some a dem a jus' a wait
Some a dem a wash dem face
Some a dem a eat dem chow and stick around
Dem a run come, come
Dem a run come, come
Could I take them offering
And a who see the Prophet in the Kingdom of Jah
Oh dem a run come, come

Big crowd a-gathering
Big crowd a-gathering
Smaller one jus' a walk underneath
Smaller one jus' a walk underneath an' stick around
Them a run come, come
Big and small
Young and old
Weak and strong
Dem a run come
Dem a dem a dem a
Dem a
Dem a hi-hi-hi-hide
Dem a run come, come
You should see dem a come
Dem a, dem a run, dem a come
One by one
Two by two
Make it up to three
Four by four
Five by five
Square it up to six
Dem a run come, come
Dem a run come, come
