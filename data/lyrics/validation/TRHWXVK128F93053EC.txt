Why did I waste my time
Two steps I don't rewind
Feeling I can't define
I give back to you
(Give it all away)
(Take it all the way)
(Give it all away)
(Take it all the way)
I see my demise
From behind your eyes
I can't pass you by
I give back to you
(Give it all away)
(Take it all the way)
(Give it all away)
(Take it all the way)
(Give it all away)
(Take it all the way)
(Give it all away)
(Take it all the way)

Between love
Between hate
Shake this silence before it's too late
And it haunts you
And it haunts you
It's a love-hate
Heartbreak

This could be suicide
A kiss with these red knives
Why am I driving blind
I give back to you
(Give it all away)
(Take it all the way)
(Give it all away)
(Take it all the way)
Try you on for size
I thought boys don't cry
You're my perfect lie
I give back to you
(Give it all away)
(Take it all the way)
(Give it all away)
(Take it all the way)
(Give it all away)
(Take it all the way)
(Give it all away)
(Take it all the way)

Between love
Between hate
Shake this silence before it's too late
And it haunts you
And it haunts you
It's a love-hate
Heartbreak

Between love
Between hate
Shake this silence before it's too late
And it haunts you
And it haunts you
It's a love-hate
Heartbreak

Between love
Between hate
Shake this silence before it's too late
And it haunts you
And it haunts you
It's a love-hate
Heartbreak

Between love
Between hate
Shake this silence before it's too late
And it haunts you
And it haunts you
It's a love-hate
Heartbreak

(Give it all away)
(Take it all the way)
(Give it all away)
(Take it all the way)
