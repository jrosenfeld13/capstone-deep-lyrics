[Verse 1: Ella Fitzgerald]
I thought I'd found the man of my dreams
Now it seems, this is how the story ends
He's going to turn me down and say
"Can't we be friends?"

[Verse 2: Ella Fitzgerald]
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong
Not for long! I can see the way this ends
He's going to turn me down and say
"Can't we be friends?"

[Verse 3: Ella Fitzgerald]
Never again, through with love
Through with men
They play their game without shame
And who's to blame?

[Verse 4: Ella Fitzgerald]
I thought I'd found a man I could trust
What a bust, this is how the story ends
He's going to turn me down and say
"Can't we be friends?"

[Verse 5: Louis Armstrong]
Yes, I thought I knew the wheat from the chaff
What a laugh, this is how our story ends
I'll let her turn me down and say
"Can't we be friends?"

[Verse 6: Louis Armstrong]
I acted like a kid out of school
What a fool, now I see this is the end
I'll let her turn me down and say
"Can't we be friends?"

[Verse 7: Louis Armstrong]
Oh, what should I give?
Though he gave me the air
Why should I cry?
He was sigh and wonder why

[Verse 8: Louis Armstrong]
Yes, I should have seen the signal to stop
What a flop, this is how the story ends
She's gonna turn me down and say
"Can't we be friends?"

[Verse 9: Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong]
What should I give?
Though he gave me the air
And why should I cry?
He was sigh and wonder why

[Verse 10: Together]
I should have seen the signal to stop
What a flop, this is how the story ends
I let him turn me down and say
Can't we be, can't we be, can't we be
Can't we be, can't we be, can't we be friends?
Oh, yes
