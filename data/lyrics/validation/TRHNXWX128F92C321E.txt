You ran cryin' to the bedroom
I ran off to the bar
Another piece of heaven gone to hell
The words we spoke in anger
Just tore my world apart
And I sat there feeling sorry for myself

Then that old man sat down beside me
And looked me in the eye
And said "Son, I know what you're going through
You ought to get down on your knees
And thank your lucky stars that you got someone to go home to."

(Chorus)
You don't know about lonely
Or how long nights can be
Till you lived through the story
That's still livin' in me
And you don't know about sadness
'til you faced life alone
You don't know about lonely
'til it's chiseled in stone

So I brought these pretty flowers
Hoping you would understand
Sometimes a man is such a fool
Those golden words of wisdom
From the heart of that old man
Showed me I ain't nothing without you

You don't know about lonely
Or how long nights can be
Till you lived through the story
That old man just told me
And you don't know about sadness
'til you faced life alone
You don't know about lonely
'til it's chiseled in stone
You don't know about lonely
'til it's chiseled in stone
