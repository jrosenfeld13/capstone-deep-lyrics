I originate
You must appreciate
All the others imitate
Yeah!
You're my crowd and I want you tonight
I am sure this tune makes you feel right
No discussions disturbing your mind
Feel the vibes leave those troubles behind
Five years now it's along time to go
Check our records that you still don't know
Get prepared for the next decade
Join the crew 'cause it's never too late
Come on

Yeah!

Yeah!
I'll put you on the guestlist
I originate, you must appreciate, all the others imitate
There is something that you have to learn
Our mission is we love the jam
Up on the stage or down on the floor
We can't stop we always need more
Five years now it's along time to go
Check our records that you still don't know
Get prepared for the next decade
Join the crew 'cause it's never too late
Come On

I'll put you on the guestlist

I'll put you on the guestlist

Feels like strawberry sun
Thank you
