It was the hottest day of August
All of us were down by the banks of the Paint Rock River
I was next in line to be baptized at the innocent age of ten
And I?ll never forget, I remember it yet, the taste of that clear, pure water
And that preacher?s words still fill my head and I hear them now and then

He said, ?Do you wanna go to heaven?"
And I said, "Yeah, just lead me on"
?Take my hand, can you feel that feelin???
And I said, ?Yeah just lead me on?

It was the hottest night of summer
And our final high school dance were just about over
I was old enough for the taste of love when boys turn into men
And I?ll never forget, I remember it yet, the taste of that clear, pure water
But the preacher?s words I've barely heard, as sweet Bonnie Lou gave in

She said, ?Do you wanna go to heaven?"
And I said, "Yeah, just lead me on"
?Take my hand, can you feel that feelin???
And I said, ?Yeah just lead me on?

It was a lonely night in August
She was sittin? at the end of the bar when I saw her
And with the little wine and a little time she would be a prize to win
Now I?ll never forget, I remember it yet, the taste of that clear, pure water
But that preacher?s words could not be heard
Wen she whispered, come on in

She said, ?Do you wanna go to heaven?"
And I said, "Yeah, just lead me on"
?Take my hand, can you feel that feelin???
And I said, ?Yeah just lead me on?

She said, ?Do you wanna go to heaven?"
And I said, "Yeah, just lead me on"
?Take my hand, can you feel that feelin???
And I said, ?Yeah just lead me on?

She said, ?Do you wanna go to heaven?"
