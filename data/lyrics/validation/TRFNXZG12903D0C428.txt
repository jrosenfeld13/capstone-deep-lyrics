I wanna be your only man
Don't wanna see you with no other man
Now, just me! Only me .. ooh
I wanna be your only man
Don't wanna see you with no other man
Now, just me! Only me

I see a sunbeam comin down
I know it's you by your footsteps on the ground
(repeat)

I wanna be your only man
Don't wanna see you with no other man
Now, just me! Only me
