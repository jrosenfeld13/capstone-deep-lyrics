Don't worry so much
Can you see the stars that are assembled?
When you held love tight remember how it trembled?
So soft to the touch
Don't hurry so much
It will come as sure as we are bleeding
Let's groove before the vultures start feeding
Don't worry so much
Let it all out, let it all in, let it out'

And go easy on yourself
That's what I'd do
I'd go easy on myself
If I were you
I'd go easy on myself
Sister try and breathe
Breathe
Killing the tumor
We're killing the tumor
While it's still a rumor

Let it all out, Let it all in, let it all out'
Don't worry so much
Don't hurry so much
Soon the maple leaves will be turning
Red leaves and autumn winds will keep us yearning
Don't worry so much
Breathe
