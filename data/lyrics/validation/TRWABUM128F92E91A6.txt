I know, here's an idea, maybe we can put together a little tour
For the core forces of Low Pressure's finest
Combined with Goodnight Musics the crew would set out from Halifax
Earning props and greenbacks and wearing party hats
Gather 4 crazy rappers in a van plus moves
And do twenty dates in the states mostly for free booze
Got stiffed at every phase, got sniffed at every border
Lost battle after battle with karma and fate
Made to order struck with bad luck and nothing went right
Except for the rapping part we ripped it night after night
Filling up clubs filling up on road food, road beer
Road rash ass smelling like sulphur fast food draft beer
1 hotel room 5 dudes piled in here
And moves and T be chain smoking
Cracked out broken, can't wait to hit the road and
Then come home when it ends, and become legends to our friends
Bumping devin the dude across Canadian plains
Me Noah T, Kaleb, B, and Paul hauling ass to Maine
Let's just say the border guards in Calais don't like black folks
They made up warrants and lied this shit'd gone past jokes
No laughing matter had to say goodbye to Caleb
Give the finger to the bailiff cm'on let's be gone
So we grab T and be back on the highway
They can't stop the prophets they can't stop our posse

Chorus:
I've had a hard fall, i kinda fell hard. I think i learned a little. But who knows you know?
I mean i'm leaning towards leaving this lifestyle of the road, but when it goes right it goes so right
Verse 2
Wrong motto, tour sponsor must have been Murphy's law
The farther we looked ahead the worst we saw
Driving at night through Indiana by headlight
What's that in the road asked Noah, then shit just exploded
I noticed the huge deer on the median immediately
It tried to run away but couldn't quite flee my vehicle
Bang Flying deer, Dang, is everybody ok?
What in the hell was that comes the question from the back
Crank shaft gear shift down just killed a deer near town
And so we get towed, get back in the van that mowed down the doe
That chose that night to freeze and frozen in the road
And we hit it dead on, then and there the creature's life gone
I pulled onto the shoulder, radiator smoking holding
Head in hand and can't stop shaking
I was fucking driving when it happened, hadn't taken
Two steps out the dented van and then it hit me
I declined insurance when I got the rented auto, that means this dented rent-a-wreck just became a big problem
Out of pocket, out of purse thinking worse case scenario
We're fucking stuck in angola, indiana
This can't happen man we had to get going, see the show must go on and we had to go on showing off
So it's off to the dodge spot to get a hot not purple green van it looked like just the minivan to make the scene in
But we can't take it out of state so they replaced it with a car, now there's 5 dudes crammed into a buick. Far from home, 18 dates left, and then I get a call on my phone, hey josh, all them Cali dates is gone
No Project Blowed, no Fillmore, No California here I come. My jaw dropped I'm awestruck dumb
Wonder what'll take to flip fate to make this right
But there was nothing we could do so we just drank all night

Chorus:
I've had a hard fall, i kinda fell hard. I think i learned a little
But who knows you know?
I mean i'm leaning towards leaving this lifestyle on the road, but when it goes right it goes so right
Verse 3
I'mma be alright. I'mma be on my feet again
And meanwhile I'll freestyle but there's really nothing sweeter than
Meeting your darkside and seeing sparks fly, by the end we oozed booze
And everyone had gone crazy
Just to deal with the range of the strange, things kept on going, noone ever thinking long range
I know sometime's it sucked and nobody got fucked
At least not with ladies, but at least no road babies
Never punched out any lights, although sometimes I thought we shoulda
Stuck some punk rocker in a locker we didn't but we coulda
So many suckers sucking suffering suckatash fucking suckers you stuck up suckdick fucksticks
Buck65/sixtoo/scratch bastard greymatter drunc caleb gordo and everybody else that matters
This damn crew who've been doing it forever, you couldn't handle this tour, not now not ever
