Nomad killing legions of the tenebrous wide steppes
Servants of the universal emperor
Wielder of the samurai's steel
Rides of destrcutive doctrines
Reaping and burning the conquered
No wall nor gates could stop the mongol race

Throughout valley's of death possession
Armies of ravishing troops ride
Surrounding the realms of cursed kingdoms
Breeding the havoc of the wolfen lord
Battle steeds march and scream
Ruled by the code of the fierce cavalry
Ordered to march and slay
Till the last of the foes fall

Irreligious brutal nations
Ascending hate of the empire of crucify

Decapitation soaked soil
With the blood of cointless prey

Infernal armies marching out
For the dawn of the wolfen tyranny

Conquering of the blood and soil
For the king of the empyreal madness
