There's a million things I'd like to say
But if you'll stay I'll try to hold 'em back a little
And a million things I'd like to hear before you disappear
And then you raise your voice a little

It's been a minute and it's no surprise
That you roll your eyes every time I wanna talk about it
Another minute you throw up your hands
And then you make demands like you never wanna hear about it
So let's be clear about it

(chorus)
There's a million things I wish you were
But what's for sure is one thing I wish you were not
I wish you weren't the one to leave me stranded
Here empty handed with a head full of wishes

There's a million words and I've said none
I've held them on my tongue and carry them into the evening
I lie in bed and swallow every word and though it seems absurd
It's worth it to keep you from leaving

And in the morning when I lie awake because my insides ache
I try to get back to a dream about it
Where every word makes up the air you breathe
You never think to leave 'cause you know you couldn't live without 'em
You won't survive without 'em

(chorus)
