Do right by your woman, she'll do right by you

Well, you always gave me lovin' though I treated you so bad
Changed my mind about wasting my time
Spending money and drinking wine

Do right by your woman, yeah, she'll do right by you
Do right by your woman, she'll do right by you

Well, you always loved a loser, but it's diff'rent from now on
I've changed my plans, gonna be a better man
I tell you so you'll understand

Do right by your woman, she'll do right by you
Do right by your woman, she'll do right by you

Do right by your woman, she'll do right by you
Do right by your woman, she'll do right by you

Do right by your woman, she'll do right by you
Do right by your woman, she'll do right by you
