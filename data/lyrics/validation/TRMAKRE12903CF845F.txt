[Verse1]
You look around
I'm staring back at you
Another wave of doubt
Will it pull you under
You wonder
What if I am overtaken?
What if I never make it?
What if no ones there?
Will you hear my prayer?
When you take that first step
Into the unknown
You know that he won't let you go

[Hook]
So what are you waiting for?
What do you have to lose?
Your insecurities try to alter you
You know you're made for more
So don't be afraid to move
Your faith is all it takes in you
You can walk on the water too

[Verse 2]
So get out and let your fear fall to the ground
No time to waste don't wait
And don't you turn around and miss out
Everything you were made for
I know you're not sure
So you play it safe, try to run away
If you take that first step, into the unknown
He won't let you go

[Hook]

[Bridge]
(Step out) even when the storm hits
(Step out) even when you're broken
(Step out) even when your heart is telling you
Telling you to give up
(Step out) when your hope is stolen
(Step out) you can't see where your going
You don't have to be afraid

[Hook]
