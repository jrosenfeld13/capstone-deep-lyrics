Better listen good girl
I'm gonna tell you smomething
I want you to hear
Don't stand me up now
If you can't be trusted
Let's get the signals clear

'Cause you may want to be confidential
And let your feelings show
But before I open up my heart
There's the thing you've got to know

Some things are private
Better off left unsaid
Some things are private
You've got to learn to keep your head

I'm gonna take you to all the right places
See teh right faces
Show you the things you've never seen
Take you uptown girl in your party dress
Intorduce you to society
But just remember when they're asking questions
You've got to be discreet
Keep in mind I've never been the kind
Who lives his business on the street

Some things are private
Better off left unsaid
Some things are private
You gotta get it through your head
Some things are private
Sworn to secrecy
Some things are private
Just between you and me

I'm gonna let you see
All of my faces
All the soft places
Let you get a closer look
I can show you a side that you've never seen
But girl don't be an open book
'Cause you c may want to be confidential
And put your trust in me
I'm gonna try and put my trust in you
Just don't invade my privacy
