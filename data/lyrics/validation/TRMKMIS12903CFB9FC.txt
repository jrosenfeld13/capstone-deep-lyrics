A life screaming silence
No knife, silent violence
Sleeping beast, green eyes
Not enough for life
Not enough for life

Fused opposition swallowed faith
Under ?'s grace
Bedtime ?
Memory displacement
Vaccination wins

New start, new area
New life, new religion
New aggression
End's not gained never

Unexpected fire
Causes pave the way
To the decay
? gray
Freedom lies
His pretended aim to expose humanity
Growing airy senselessly
It's a fact of ?
Freedom lies

Inner motion
Holistic despair
Put to sleep slaves
Regenerate luxury
Push away the feeding carcass
Standing fixed on crippled feet
Rover bounded life-long
Strange Mother Earth
Unknown violation
Thinks maternity
Throwing their poison gift
On the feet of their ?
Victim uttering, his legs touched by faith
No rest left, empty resort
Along the skies
Freezing sub-paper
On the civil sight

Yell to above
Yell to above
Yell to above
Yell to above
Yell to above
Yell to above
Why?

Unexpected fire
Causes pave the way
To the decay
? gray
Freedom lies
His pretended aim to expose humanity
Growing airy senselessly
It's a fact of ?
Freedom lies

Fleeting fire
Paradise burns
Not a soul to extinguish
Disposer of genetic waste
Freedom lies
