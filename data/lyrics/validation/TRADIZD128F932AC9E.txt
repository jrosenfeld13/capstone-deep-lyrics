It's been so long since we said goodbye
I guess that's the reason why I sit and cry
I miss you baby every day and night
It's been so long since I held you tight

Everything's different since you went away
It gets so lonely every night and day
I can't help feeling that you ought to know
I love you baby and I miss you so
Nothing ever seems the same my sunshine has turned to rain
Every time I hear your name my heart becomes a burning flame
It's been so long since we said goodbye...
( fiddle - steel )
It's been so long since we said goodbye...
Everything's different since you went away...
It's been so long since we said goodbye...
