For new era to come
No mercy shall done
For those on my way
And i will surely prevail

As vowed for name astarte
Revenge shall be one part
As now betrayals crushed
All behind turns to dust

- Our victory on battle -

So now i`ve reached the crown
On my feet mortals go down
From shadows my army rides
To end up weakness and light

Now there`s throne for two
I rule the world with you
No enemy shall defeat
Cause we have the only key

- Our victory for the crown -

So now i`ve reached the crown
On my feet mortals go down
From shadows my army rides
To end up weakness and light

- Our victory for eternity -

So now i`ve reached the crown
On my feet mortals go down
From shadows my army rides
To end up weakness and light
