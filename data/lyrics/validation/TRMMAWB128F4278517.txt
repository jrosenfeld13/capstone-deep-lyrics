Won't you come see about me?
I'll be alone, dancing you know it baby
Tell me your troubles and doubts
Give it everything inside and out

Love strange, so real in the dark
Think of the tender things that we were working on
Slow change may pull us apart
When our life gets in to your heart baby

Don't you, forget about me
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't you, forget about me

Don't you try to pretend
It's my feeling we'll win in the end
I won't harm you or touch your defenses
Vanity, insecurity

Don't you forget about me
I'll be alone, dancing you know it baby
Come to, I'll take you apart
I'll put us back together at heart baby

Don't you, forget about me
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't you, forget about me
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't you, forget about me
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't you, forget about me

Will you stand above me?
Look my way, never love me
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling
Down, down, down

Hey hey hey hey hoo yeah

Don't you, forget about me
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't you, forget about me

But you walk on by
Will you call my name?
As you walk on by
Will you call my name?
As you walk away

Will you walk away?
Will you walk away?
Come on baby call my name
I say, will you call my name?

I say
La la la la la........

Will you call my name, baby
Won't you please let me feel like
I know I feel you
Let me see my hands before you
Let me see your hands before me
I said why don't you call my name
I need for you to call my name
I need you to call my name
