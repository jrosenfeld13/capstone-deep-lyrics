Dean

I want the world to know your love belongs to me
Now and for ever, now and for ever

Before you said hello, my life was sad and blue
Let's stay together now and for ever

Every night I lie awake my love and whisper your name
And I'll tell you just how much I care again and again
And again and again

Until the seas run dry and the birds no longer sing
Let's stay together now and for ever

Every night I lie awake my love and whisper your name
And I'll tell you just how much I care again and again
And again and again

Until the seas run dry and the birds no longer sing
Let's stay together now and for ever
Now and for ever
Now and for ever
