Lonesome is I, I wished I could die
Nobody cares for me
Lonesome is I, I wished I could die
Nobody cares for me

It was a bright moonlight night, the moon shining bright
When you and I made love
Your heart wasn't true, I'll say unto you
I'm more like a turtle-dove

Lonesome is I, wished I could die
Nobody cares for me
Lonesome is I, wished I could die
Nobody cares for me

I'm coming home, no more to roam
Darling I'm coming home
I'm coming home, no more to roam
Darling I'm coming home

Down in the pasture, where the birds are singing
You can't hear nothing but what the birds are saying
Down in the pasture, where the birds are singing
You can't hear nothing but what the birds are saying

It was a bright moonlight night, the moon shining bright
When you and I made love
Your heart wasn't true, I'll say unto you
I'm more like a turtle-dove

Lonesome is I, wished I could die
Nobody cares for me
Lonesome is I, wished I could die
Nobody cares for me
