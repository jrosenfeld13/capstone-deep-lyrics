[Verse 1]
When I'm all alone with you
We do the things that lovers do
Tell me is this not true
When I look into your eyes
I'm convinced that you're mine
Or is this just in my mind
You feel like my everything
When you're near my aura beams
My eyes tell everything
Don't you know the joy you bring
Just to be around you
So crazy about you
Wanna get away with you
La di da di do you
Feel the ocean's breeze
Where will this all lead
Deeper in my arms hopefully

[Verse 2]
Could you be the one for me
Am I blind and not see
You're truly in love with me
And the things that you do
Always seems to lead to
You're truly in love with me
You treat me just like a queen
So good to me, you make my heart sing
My smile says everything
Love everything about you
Even the air around you
If I gave my all to you
Would you change your attitude
Could your love still be true
Would it always feel brand new
Only this I want from you
If I gave my heart to you

[Chorus]
Am I wrong for loving you
Oh the way that I do
Truly in love with you
Could you be the one for me
Am I blind and not see
You're truly in love with me
And the quality time
Makes me feel you're all mine
I'm truly in love with you
And the things that you do
Always seem to be too
You're truly in love with me

[Bridge]
So crazy about you
Will it always feel brand new
Want to get away with you
Would you change your attitude
Where would this all lead
If I gave my heart to you
Deeper in my arms, hopefully

[Chorus]
Am I wrong for loving you
Oh the way that I do
Truly in love with you
Could you be the one for me
Am I blind and not see
You're truly in love with me
All the quality time
Makes me feel you're all mine
I'm truly in love with you

[Outro]
When I'm all alone with you
We do things that lovers do
I'm truly in love with you
(You're truly in love with me)
