Working for vacation, walking for meditation
Watching television for as long as I want
People got science but make no sense
Still can't do anything for cutting out violence

When I think of something, it goes out to space
Then it comes back (to me) in another shape
We know we are not apes
But we could make sweet seedless grapes

Feeling wrong cause the days are too long
Counting heartbeats seventy-two in a minute
Feeling wrong cause the days are too long
Counting heartbeats seventy-two in a minute
Feeling wrong cause the days are too long
Counting heartbeats seventy-two in a minute
Feeling wrong cause the days are too long

I need to talk to an ancient Egyptian
To know the transcription,  to read the prescription
For the friction we've got
Or the options we'll have
Maybe God only knows

Feeling wrong cause the days are too long
Counting heartbeats seventy-two in a minute
Feeling wrong cause the days are too long
Counting heartbeats seventy-two in a minute
Feeling wrong cause the days are too long
Counting heartbeats seventy-two in a minute
Feeling wrong cause the days are too long

Feeling wrong cause the days are too long
Counting heartbeats seventy-two in a minute
Feeling wrong cause the days are too long
Counting heartbeats seventy-two in a minute
Feeling wrong cause the days are too long
Counting heartbeats seventy-two in a minute
Feeling wrong cause the days are too long
Counting heartbeats seventy-two in a minute
Feeling wrong cause the days are too long
Counting heartbeats seventy-two in a minute
Feeling wrong cause the days are too long
Counting heartbeats seventy-two in a minute
Feeling wrong cause the days are too long
Counting heartbeats seventy-two in a minute
Feeling wrong cause the days are too long
Counting heartbeats seventy-two in a minute
