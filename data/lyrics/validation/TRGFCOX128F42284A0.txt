I'm feeling so tired can't understand it
Just had a fortnight sleep
I'm feeling so tired, oh, so distracted
Ain't touched a thing all week
I'm feeling drunk juiced up and sloppy
Ain't touched a drink all night
Feeling hungry can't see the reason
Just had a horse meat pie

Yeah when you call my name
I salivate like a Pavlov dog
Yeah when you lay me out
My heart is beating faster than a big bass drum

Yeah you got to mix it child, you got to fix
It must be love, it's a bitch
You got to mix it child
You got to fix it must be love
It's a bitch

Sometimes I'm sexy, move like a stud
Kicking the stalls all night
Sometimes I'm so shy, got to be worked on
Don't have no bark or no bite
