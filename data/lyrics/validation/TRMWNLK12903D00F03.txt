[Verse 1]
Why do I just lie awake and think of you?
I need some sleep
Tomorrow I have things to do
Every time I close my eyes I see your face
So I try to read, but all I do is lose my place

[Chorus 1]
Am I obsessed with you?
I do my best not to want you
But I do all the time
I do all the time

[Verse 2]
I just had to call you up and say hello
I know it's 3 AM
And I saw you a while ago
But I still have this aching pain to hear your voice
To know you're there
I don't seem to have any choice

[Chorus 1]
Am I obsessed with you?
I do my best not to want you
But I do all the time
I do all the time

[Bridge]
I'm so sorry I just had to wake you up
I feel so lonely by myself
Is this the way it feels when you're in love?
Or is this something else?
Yeah

[Chorus 2]
Am I obsessed with you?
I do my best not to want you
But I do all the time
Want you all the time
Ooh, yeah, but I do all the time
I want you all the time
Am I obsessed with you?
