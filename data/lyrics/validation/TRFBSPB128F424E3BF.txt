My baby breaks by the sea
Floats her arms around me
They pretend to be free
She don't mean nothing to me

This broken opera just screams
What don't get said in my dreams
Don't need no shoulders to lean
Still I feel far too clean

My baby's beauty explodes
My wounded conscious unloads
I go where cold winds don't blow
I go where nobody knows

Now my wave breaks down on me
Whole world seems out to sound me
I'll drown, no one to show me
Can't swim I lost my floatie

My baby's gone (x8)
