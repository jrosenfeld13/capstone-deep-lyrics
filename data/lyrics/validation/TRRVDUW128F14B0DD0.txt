I wanna go home been gone so long
Remember the way it was when Dad and Mom
Now it's gone but somethin' gotta keep the family strong
So we keep holdin' on to each other and our faith in God
Is what keeps is sane and carries us on
So kids from now on ya betta recognize
That there's no place like home
No place like home
Some say that home home is where the heart is
Not just your heart but your brotha and your sista
Your mother your father that's were it's at
Fell in love said I do I love you then came you
Into a world that you once knew
Now it broke in two and you don't know what to do
Brought tears to your eyes that made you realize
That there's no place like home
No place like home
Take take take take me home
Yeah I grew up in a Christian house
Listenin' to Psalty and Charity Church Mouse
Never did I know and never did I guess
That 18 years later our home would be a mess
Don't get all the treason don't know all the reasons
Why life takes turns good and bad seasons
Something's gotta mend these ripped up hearts
Whatever happened to death do us part
Mom n' Dad come back around
Breakin' me the family tree gettin' shut down
No place like home
Take take take take me home
