All you fellas, gather 'round me
And let me give you some good advice
What I'm gonna, gonna ask you now
You'd better think about it twice
While you're out cheatin' on your woman
There is something I never ever dreamed of and that is

Who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love
Who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love

I've known so, so many fellows
All in that same old bag
Thinkin' that a woman was made to
To be beat on and treated so bad
Well now fellows, let me tell you something
Something I never ever dreamed of

Who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love
Who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love

I know there are some woman guilty of this too
I'm not trying to run you life boy, the choice is up to you
Yeah you, you you

Reason why I ask this question
I used to be the same old way
'Til I started to straighten up
I found out it was a bit too late
Oh yeah, that's when it all started
Something I never ever dreamed of

Somebody was a lovin' my old lady
While I was out making love
Somebody was a lovin' my old lady
While I was out making love

Now who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love
Who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love

Somebody was a lovin' my old lady
While I was out making love
