If you took away what I think I have
Would I crumble and fade saying
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust?
If you drop me upside down how would I land
Flat on my back due to lack of self trust?
Time moves fast like I said in sand
But I refuse to just stagnate and rust

You can fool everybody else but you can
Fool yourself your decision
Gotta find your inner strength because sometimes
Nobody else can give you help
Never give up
