You grow your nails too long
The scratches on your arms
You taste like orange chocolate
You always put your hands in my pockets

Your teeth are not quite straight
Your mood swings oscillate
Your language is appalling
And you play with my hair in the morning

Your imperfections are so beautiful
I can't control
My animal soul
Your imperfections have got me unashamed
Can't concentrate
I'm a sucker for your beautiful-ish face

Sometimes when we kiss
You touch my fingertips
Synthetic words can't hide me
Passion breeds like death inside me
And slowly we become one
We stick like chewing gum
I want your language to be appalling
I want you to play with my hair in the morning

Your imperfections are so beautiful
I can't control
My animal soul
Your imperfections have got me unashamed
Can't concentrate
I'm a sucker for your beautiful-ish face

Your imperfections are so beautiful
I'm out of control
My animal soul
Your imperfections have got me unashamed
Can't concentrate

Your imperfections make you what you are
My defective star
My inelegant love

Your imperfections are so beautiful
I'm out of control
I'm a sucker for the defects in your soul
