I'm a rebel, soul rebel
I'm a capturer, soul adventurer
I'm a rebel, soul rebel
I'm a capturer, soul adventurer
See the morning sun, the morning sun
On the hillside
If you're not living good, travel wide
You gotta travel wide
Said I'm a living man
And I've got work to do
If you're not happy, children
Then you must be blue
Must be blue, people say
I'm a rebel, let them talk
Soul rebel, talk won't bother me
I'm a capturer, that'w what they say
Soul adventurer, night and day
I'm a rebel, soul rebel
Do you hear them lippy
I'm a capturer, gossip around the corner
Soul adventurer. How they adventure on me
But, see the morning sun, the morning sun
On the hillside
If you're not living good, travel wide
You gotta travel wide
Said I'm a living man
I've got work to do
If you're not happy, then you must be blue
Must be blue, people say
I'm a rebel, soul rebel
I'm a capturer, soul adventurer
Do you hear me?
I'm a rebel, rebel in the morning
Soul rebel, rebel at midday time
