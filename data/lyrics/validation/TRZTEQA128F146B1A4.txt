There was a time
When I thought I knew
Everything about
This great big world
Until I met you
Into my life
Like a brand new sun
Now I find my home
Inside your eyes
Wherever you are
It's hard to say it
Cause I hide things so good
But you make me say it
Like only you could
I love you
More than any man could ever say
I need you
Baby let me count the ways
And I'll be here
I believe in everything you do
So how did I get by without you
For the longest time
Playing games of solitaire
Taking my wine
But now I'm with you baby
And I can dream out loud
You're as pretty as a picture
And you make me so proud
It's hard to say it
Cause I hide things so good
But you make me say it
Like only you could
I love you
More than any words could ever say
I need you
Baby let me count the ways
And I'll be here
There's nothing in this world I couldn't do
So how did I get by without you
You love me
Now I know that I'm the lucky guy
You've got me
And there's nowhere I can hide
So I'll be here
I believe that all my dreams came true
So how did I get by without you
In the morning light
To see you wake up next to me
It's a beautiful sight
Now everything's alright
Yeah
I love you
More than any words could ever say
I need you
Baby let me count the ways
And I'll be here
I believe in everything you do
So how did I get by without you
You love me
Now I know that I'm the lucky guy
You've got me
And there's nowhere I can hide
So I'll stay here
I believe in everything you do
So how did I get by without you
How did I get by
How did I get by without you in my world
How did I get by without you as my girl
You're beautiful
Beautiful
So how did I get by without you
Without you
Without you
