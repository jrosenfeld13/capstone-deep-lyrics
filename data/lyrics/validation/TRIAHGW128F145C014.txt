How much longer 'til the curtain rises?
First night stage fright always hypnotizes
Leading ladies never think about it
Live without it

Try to hide your fear of falling
Keep your eyes on me, I'm calling

Don't look down girl
You know you're holding aces
Don't look down girl
Don't give the game away

One more heartbeat and you walk the wire
Why wait? Ooh, it's too late to put out the fire
Almost strangers, can you stop deceiving
Start believing

Try to hide your fear of falling
Keep your eyes on me, I'm calling

Don't look down girl
You know you're holding aces
Don't look down girl
Don't give the game away, 'cause baby

Oh, even when you feel you can't go on
Laughing at the rain you fool no one
If you don't wanna lose what you have found
Then don't look down

Changing partners is just substitution
It's no solution

Try to hide your fear of falling
Keep your eyes on me, I'm calling

Don't look down girl
You know you're holding aces
Don't look down girl
Don't give the game away

Don't look down girl
You know you're holding aces
Don't look down girl
Don't give the game away

Don't look down
Don't look down
Don't look down
