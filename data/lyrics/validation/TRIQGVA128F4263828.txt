I know I don't know you
I know that we don't think along the same lines

But what do I do when I can't reach out
Through this iron-built
Bubble of pain

Your house settled in deep country
With acres and a farm and a stream to cleanse me

Your house with a view of purity
Overlooks a hillside of green
Green as your eyes

I embrace the moment
I'm in love with the dream
And toy with ideas
That burn deep inside me

Cause a picture is all you are to me
A picture is all you'll ever be

I know you don't know me
A nervous, wordless face brings shade to your light

But I want so bad to walk beside you
But fall back into a world
Where I believe

I embrace the moment
I'm in love with the dream
And toy with ideas
That burn deep inside me

Because a picture is all you are to me
A picture is all you'll ever be
