We're gonna break these walls down
Come on, baby
Let's bring them down, to the ground
Let's get outta this place
We've been so long
We're getting outta here
Let's bring them down

No more fear
No more holding back
Let's be stronger
Than we've been in the past
We're gonna break
These walls down
Come on, baby
Let's bring them down

(chorus)
We're tired
Tired of being held back
Captive by these walls and fear to tear them down
We're tired, tired of being helpless
We're so weak
But as one we'll tear them down

Tired of being put down
You put it down
Breakin' free
Breakin' free
I'm so sick and tired
Tired of being held back
You hold it back
Breakin' free
Breakin' free

We're tired, tired of being held back
Captive by these walls and fear to tear them down
We're tired, tired of being afraid
It will be hard
But we will keep trying till they fall
We're tired, tired of being helpless
We're so weak but as one we'll tear them down (tear them down echo)

We're gonna break these walls
We won't wait any more
Never been so strong before
We're gonna break these walls
We won't wait any more
Never been so strong before (we are)
We're gunna break these walls (we are stronger)
We won't wait anymore (we are)
Never been so strong before (we are stronger)
We're gunna break these walls
We won't take anymore

Today is the day
Beating harder
Today is the day
Breaking free
