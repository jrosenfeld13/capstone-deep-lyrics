Where did the future go?
I was feeling down, I was feeling so low
Had to get out, had to get out
Parts unknown

Where did the feeling go?
I got it back when the plane touched down
I was over, I was over
Overwhelmed

Here it comes
Here it comes
Here it comes
Here it comes

The frozen land
I'm never going back there
It was a lie, a lie believing itself
And it's so hard

I saw a light, saw the reconstruction
And I will go, I will go
Out in the heat and the rush
And they push us by a knife

Your little heart is gonna beat so
Where did the future go?
Parts unknown
Parts unknown

Your little heart is gonna beat so
Where did the feeling go?
It comes and goes
Comes and goes

Here it comes

[Instrumental]

Your little heart is gonna beat so
Where did the feeling go?
It comes and goes
Comes and goes

There it comes
Here it comes
Oh
Blackout

I've seen the future and it's coming in low
I've seen the future, I will never be repatriated
I've seen the future and it's coming in low
I've seen the future, I will never be repatriated

I'll never be repatriated
Never be repatriated
I'll never be repatriated
Never be repatriated
Never be repatriated
Never be repatriated
