If it rains, now we'll change
We'll hold and save all of what came
We won't let it run away
If it rains, woah, woah, woah, woah

If it rains, different this time
We won't break the chain or make our own rain
We'll just take what came
If it rains, woah, woah, woah, woah

If it rains, we'll worship again
We've seen what came without the rain
We'll be thankful that it came
If it rains, woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, oh, oh
