Have I sinned? Have I told her lies?
What did I do to make you cry?

Somebody help me to get home again
Give more chance to renew our romance

This love that binds me tighter than chains
Will always be a memory in my heart

We'll live in a world that knows no shame
That's why our love will not be in vain

Well, tell me, tell me

Have I sinned? Was I to blame?
If tried, could things be the same?

Please say the word, that you will forgive
For without your love, I don't want to live

This love that binds me tighter than chains
Will always be a memory in my heart

We'll live in a world. that know no shame
That's why our love will not be in vain

Baby, tell me, tell me

Have I sinned? Was I to blame?
If I tried, could things be the same?

Please say the word, that you will forgive
For without your love, I don't want to live
