Up above my head there is music in the air
Up above my head there is music in the air
I really do believe there's a heaven somewhere

Well music makes the world go 'round
That's the way to be happy that much I found
Sing a song and be happy and free
So turn around children and follow me

Well I have a soul that's weary and worn
But I heard the music since the day I was born
And I remember what the good Lord said
Now I hear His music, and its

Up above my head there is music in the air
Up above my head there is music in the air
Up above my head there is music in the air, oh yeah!
And I really do believe, I really do believe
There's a heaven somewhere

(repeat)
