You're down in the hole
You're down in the ground
It's 7 a.m
And you're scratching around
The money's all gone
And you're poor like the poor
Your lover just called
She don't love you no more

You're in the black bunker
You're in the black bunker
In the black bunker
You're in the black bunker

You're down in the hole
You're down in the ground
It's 7 a.m
And you're scratching around
You're itching and scratching
Scratching and itching
Trying to break on through?
Or hanging round my kitchen?

In the black bunker
You're in the black bunker
In the black bunker
You're in the black bunker

In the black bunker
You're in the black bunker

The bunker!
The bunker!

In the black bunker
You're in the black bunker
