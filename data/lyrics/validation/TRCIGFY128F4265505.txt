When we were at school i thought he had it sussed
Fighting the law with the rest of us
Smoking, drinking, acting cool
'til they started treating him like a fool
Then he stayed on his own
For most of the time
Dreaming dreams of a life of crime
In and out of trouble
He cheated and lied
But who'd have thought he'd join the other side

He's in the riot squad
The wanna fight squad
The shoot-on-sight squad
For law and right

Down to hendon with the boys in blue
It's amazing what a few weeks can do
Out in the car, out on the street
South of the river on the frontline beat

He's in the riot squad
The wanna fight squad
The shoot-on-sight squad
For law and right

Cracking heads, it was all a game
A finger was pointed, and he got the blame
Now he's back where he started
He ain't got a pound
Queuing with the sorts he used to kick around

Riot squad
The wanna fight squad
The shoot-on-sight squad
For law and right

The riot squad
The riot squad
The shoot-on-sight squad
The riot squad
