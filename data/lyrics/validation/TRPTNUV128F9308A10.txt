Ill protect you, dont be scared
No matter what, I will be there
Ill be gentle, Ill be light
These are the words you whispered in the night
Here I am
Here I am

CHORUS
Now Im standing in the cold
(Everything is said and done)
Atomic winter in my soul
(From the absence of the sun)
The only remedy I know
Is I got to let you go
Here I am
Here I am

But where were you when I was scared
A broken promise left me here
A post-it note is what Ive got
It says: Im sorry, but I know youre not
So
Here I am yeah
Here I am

CHORUS
Now Im standing in the cold
(Everything is said and done)
Atomic winter in my soul
(From the absence of the sun)
The only remedy I know
Is I got to let you go
Here I am
Here I am

There will come a day when all of this is in my past
And there will come a day when youre out of my head at last
Im trying not to fall
Damn its such a long way down
But here I am
Yeah Yeah Yeah

CHORUS
Now Im standing in the cold
(Everything is said and done)
Atomic winter in my soul
(From the absence of the sun)
The only remedy I know
Is I got to let you go
And Now Im standing in the cold
(Everything is said and done)
Yeah Yeah Yeah
(From the absence of the sun)
The only remedy I know
Is I got to let you go
Here I am
Here I am
