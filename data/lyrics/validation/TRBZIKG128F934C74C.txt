[Verse 1]
Mommies
I've been stealing your babies
I gag the brat and then maybe
I'll suck out his brains!
You know those dead kids
They're making me feel almost hard
I go get one from the school yard
He bled like a stuck pig!

[Chorus]
Have you seen me?
Have you seen me?
Have you seen me?
Me
Have you seen me?
(Have you seen me?)

[Verse 2]
Suckle
My bloated love knuckle
Just like Fatty Arbuckle
I'm gay and I'm proud!
That's right
Faggot
And a corpse full of maggots
I wanna blow cum not bag it
Goddamnit I'm horny!

[Chorus]
Have you seen me?
Have you seen me?
Have you seen me?
Me
Have you seen me?
(Have you seen me?)

[Interlude]
It's just a dead child
An object I've defiled
Yes I know it's wrong
You'd rather that it was your mom?

So! So!
So! So!
So! So!
Whoaaa!

It's just a dead child
An object I've defiled
Yes I know it's wrong
You'd rather that it was your mom?
Your mom
My mom
Our mom
Anybody's mom!

So! So!
So! So!
So! So!
So! So!

[Unintelligible chattering and screaming]

[Chorus]
Have you seen me?
Have you seen me?
Have you motherfucking seen me?
Have you seen me?
Have you seen me?
Me
Have you seen me?
Have...You...Seen...
ME!

[Outro]
S-S-S-S-S-S-S-Sated!
Now that I've masturbated
I'm in love and I'm hated
I don't follow the crowd
But I said you
I said your covered in vile spew
My filthy chunks is all over you
My filthy filthy filthy chunks
My filthy filthy filthy
Oh!
