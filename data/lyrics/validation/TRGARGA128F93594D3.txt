At the end of a long lonely day without you
When the world seems to fall in my face
I'm all right through the day, but the day fades away
And the long lonely night takes its place

Chorus #1

Another day to wish that you were here
I dread each lonely night that's filled with fear
Oh, I've cried and I've cried these are tears that I can't hide
At the end of a long lonely day

At the end of the day, I go up to my room
And I watch while the sun fades away

And the lonliness there brings me grief and dispair
At the end of a long lonely day

Chorus #2

Another day to sit alone and cry
It makes no difference if I live or die
With a world locked outside I just lay there and cry
At the end of a long lonely day

Repeat Chorus #1
