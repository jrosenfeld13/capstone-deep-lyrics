Hello
Its mercy medical
We've done everything we can do
There's nothing left
Its up to her
And so

Welcome to your funeral
Where they talk about the girl they knew
A tragedy. a shame to lose her
Little girl so beautiful
A life so new and meaningful
That little girl so beautiful

Is it difficult to swallow?
The air is thin and you can hardly breathe
Tell them now
They'll listen now
They'll help you now
Just tell them how

Does it feel like nothing ever changes
That makes you want to sleep forever
Tell them now
They'll listen now
They'll help you now
Just tell them how

Its bravery to stay awake
From ending life before its over
