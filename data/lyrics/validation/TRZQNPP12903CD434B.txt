Destroying world peace is the name of the game
In the land that says they're treating everybody the same
They greed for so much power seeking total control
And express no human feeling
Towards the lives that they stole

Shot down, an innocent plane
Shot down, they gave us the blame
For this they should be punished an indefinite time
For committing such a peace disturbing hideous crime

Should we believe Moscow?
Are they telling the truth?
While Ronnie and the press
Are still searching for proof
To say they didn't do it with the intention to kill
Seems they twist the facts with every story they tell

Shot down, an innocent plane
Shot down, they gave us the blame
For this they should be punished an indefinite time
For committing such a peace disturbing hideous crime
