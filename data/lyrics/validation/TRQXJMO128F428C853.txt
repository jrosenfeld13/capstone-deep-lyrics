I can be as humble as the next guy
Or I can blink and make you crumble from the inside
I could be every nasty thing you ever thought a man could be

Cuz they all fall down (down)
Cuz they all fall down (down)

I can make you see the beauty of a new sun
Or I can be the source of your desperation
I could be every nasty thing you ever dreamt a man could be

[Chorus]
Jaded, dated, i'm the type you hated
Haunted, taunted, i'm what you've always wanted
Yeah, yeah, i'm what you've always wanted [x2]

You can turn away like you don't even see me
Yea, you can smile like you got something I need
But every night you go home alone
And dream about being underneath me

[Chorus]
Jaded, dated, i'm the type you hated
Haunted, taunted, i'm what you've always wanted
Yeah, yeah, i'm what you've always wanted [x2]

Can't you see through this disguise
Find the little boy inside
I'm afraid of falling
Love is pain and now she's calling
And she's
Jaded, dated, i'm the type you hated
Haunted, taunted, i'm what you've always wanted
Yeah, yeah, i'm what you've always wanted [x2]

[Chorus]
