"Sorry"
Is all that you can't say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like "sorry" (like "sorry", like "sorry")

"Forgive me"
Is all that you can't say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
Like "forgive me" ("forgive me") Forgive me

But you can say, baby
Baby, can I hold you tonight?
Baby, if I told you the right words
Oooh, at the right time
You'll be mine

"I love you"
Is all that you can't say
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily
(Words don't come easily)
Like "I love you", "I love you"

But you can say, baby
Baby, can I hold you tonight?
Baby, if I told you the right words
Oooh, at the right time
You'll be mine

(Baby, can I hold you)
But you can say, baby
Baby, can I hold you tonight?
Baby, if I told you the right words
Oooh, at the right time
You'll be mine

(Baby, if I told you)
(Baby, can I hold you) You'll be mine
(Baby, if I told you)
(Baby, can I hold you) You'll be mine

(Baby, if I told you)
Baby, can I hold you
