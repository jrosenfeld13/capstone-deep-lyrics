I would bet you don't care
So I pray to the ether
I thought the city air would hear me whisper

When the blue expanse of morning comes
You sleep while I stalk the sun, like a baby
I don't break in icy blasts
I ache for the past, like a baby

A tourist in your head
I capture shining moments
To busy myself with whenever you're a jerk

When the blue expanse of morning comes
You sleep while I stalk the sun, like a baby
I don't break in icy blasts
I ache for the past, like a baby

This gnawing emptiness seeps in like a cold mist
Their touching approval feels so awful

When the blue expanse of morning comes
You sleep while I stalk the sun, like a baby
I don't break an icy blasts
I ache for the past, like a baby

But beauty's few and far between
Who knows what you have seen...
