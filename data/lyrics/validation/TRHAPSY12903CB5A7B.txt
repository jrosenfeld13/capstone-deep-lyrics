And all those stupid things we buy
Each other when it's cold outside
A little warmer and we turn to God to make it cold once more
But all those silly things you got me
That won't even last until the of
January when we start
To hope again for this departure
Please Return so we can get the things
We want and forget about the reason
We are not in school
Getting presents might be cool but
But That is not why we are here
And 5 days later, we've forgotten
The man who saved or souls
Cause everybody's wasted
I'll change my name cause this is rad
I'll change my names cause this is rad
