Searching for answers about the meaning of life
I can tell you they're harder than kryptonite
You want to get in touch with your inner self
Destroy your principles, get rid of all your lies

You can take your stuck up pride with you as you fall to die
No heads down when you take the hit
Your life ain't worth shit

Demons from within turn your heart so cold
You have nothing inside that cage you built around you

You can take your stuck up pride with you as you fall to die
No heads down when you take the hit
Your life ain't worth shit

Don't you ever let anybody in?
Totally worthless
You know they'll eat your soul and slit your throat
Don't you ever let anybody in?
Kill!
You know they'll eat your soul and slit your throat
