It feels so right now
Hold me tight
Tell me I'm the only one
And then I might
Never be the lonely one so
Hold me tight tonight, tonight
It's you, you, you, you

[Molly]
Hold me tight
Let me go on loving you
Tonight, tonight
Making love to only you so

[Lucy]
Hold me tight tonight, tonight, tonight
It's you

[Molly]
You, you, you

[Lucy]
Oh no
What it means to hold you tight

[Molly]
Being here alone tonight with you

[Lucy]
It feels so right now
Hold me tight
Tell me I'm the only one
And then I might
Never be the lonely one so
Hold me tight tonight, tonight

[Molly]
It's you, you, you, you

[Lucy]
Oh no
What it means to hold you tight
Being here alone tonight with you
It feels so right now
Hold me tight
Let me go on loving you
Tonight, tonight
Making love to only you, so
Hold me tight tonight, tonight
It's you, you, you, you
