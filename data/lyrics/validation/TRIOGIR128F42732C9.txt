You only want me 'cause you can't have me
I was there for a while just waiting
I moved on and now you're wishing you had the opportunity

You only want me cause you can't have me
I'm sorry I am not for the having
You sadly failed to see
Now you are wishing
Wishing

You could have had a taste
Love was staring you in the face
But you chose to walk away
Walk away

And I wasn't gonna wait
And now you're too late
Too late

You only want me cause you can't have me
I saw the game that you played
Didn't fool me
Now you're the one left standing all alone
All alone

You don't know what you want 'til it's gone
Too bad I've been there all along
I already stopped waiting for you
So long ago
So long ago

You could have had a taste
Love was staring you in the face
But you chose to walk away
Walk away

And I wasn't gonna wait
And now you're too late
Too late
And I wasn't gonna wait
And now you're too late
Too late
