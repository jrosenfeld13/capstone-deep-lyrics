I was at the bar with my drinkin team
It was me Jack Daniels and my homey Jim Bean
We were kinda blitzed and we were trying to behave Y'all
When in walked a soldier he was from the fuzzy naval
We were fallin, stumblin, crawlin
Her come da police, Captain Tom Collins
And the rapper said freeze
He said "hands in the air and hand over your keys"
Now we did, and that was kinda simple
Now here came Marguarita and her friend Shirley Temple
I asked my friend 'bout Marguarita
He said Shirley was a virgin an I wouldn't wanna meet her
So I talked to Marguarita, cause yoh, she was flyer
I took her to the coast cause I wanted to Screw Driver
Now Im not one for a speech
But there was plenty of Tequila and Sex On The Beach, Y'all
Tequila
Te-Te-Te - Tequila
Tequila
Here we go again and Im not fussin
See I'm a French Mexican but I can get with White Russians
At the bar with a drink in my hand
In walked Jose Cuervo what was marguaritas man
I talked to the wise man cause, yoh he's distinguished
His name was St. Ives and he spoke in old english
He said "you'd better think fast
Cause Jose is kinda crazy and I heard he Shot Glass"
He gave me some advice and it went like this:
"catch the night train and head up to 'cisco"
I didn't wanna stick around
I caught the 1:51 to New York, the Grey Hound
Now I'm at the Red Zone, everybody's stylin'
Was sippin Ice Teas on Long Island
I blacked out and the party came to a halt
Cause I was drinking the Tequila with the lemon assault Y'all
Tequila
Te-Te-Te - Tequila
Tequila
I woke up in the morning and felt like a Zombie
The Tequila Gold Label had bombed me
You see I woke up late and wasn't feelin' so great
And Mike said there's a Bicardi party startin' at eight
Yo we walked in the party and started playin our games
We played tops, fuzzy quarters, with Bartles & James
Here came Shirley Temple and they told me to chill
Because the Mickey Brothers took her up to strawberry hill
They took her $1000 mink and she could barely think
Cause the Tequila that she drank had her tickled pink
Now the music came on and I rocked the instrumental
There's a groupie named Mai Tai, a fly oriental
A groupie is a girl that jocks
She wore the def Black Velvet and drank Scotch on the Rocks
We had a fake marriage, now here's to honeymoon
Ya zone vagabond and the Blue Lagoon
Now everybody take a word from the wise
A girly and a bottle, Tequila Sunrise
Tequila
Te-Te-Te - Tequila
Tequila
Tequila
Te-Te-Te - Tequila
Tequila
