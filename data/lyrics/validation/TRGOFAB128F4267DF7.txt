Baby, why'd you leave me
On the airport with my fingers
Put together while I was praying for your lover
I wasn't keen on love at the moment
I didn't even like your modesty hairstyle
But then I froze when you left me for another

Don't tell me this dream is over
And don't stop telling me your love
Don't tell me this dream is over
And don't stop burning my eyes my bird of blue

Well I waited on the corner of your street
'Cause you're a street cat and I'm a mad dog
And this night is ours whether you want it or you don't
Well I picked you flowers and wrote you a poem
About a guy who owned the world but no women
Maybe you'll see, maybe someday that I might end you
I'll do you ill

Don't tell me this dream is over
And don't stop telling me your love
Don't tell me this dream is over
And don't stop burning my eyes my bird of blue

I can't live without you breath by my past babe
I can't breath without your life by my future
I can't see clear without your teardrops in my eyes

Don't tell me this dream is over
And don't stop telling me your love
Don't tell me this dream is over
And don't stop burning my eyes my bird of blue

Don't tell me this dream is over
Please don't tell me this dream is over now
