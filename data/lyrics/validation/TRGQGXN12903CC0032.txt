We want the best of both worlds
We want it slow and hot
We like to taste revenge, yeah
But we can't waste the shot

We want to see from both sides
We like it cool and fast
We want to get it over
We like to make it last

Keep it on
It's getting closer
The best of both worlds
Double fun

We'll make the most, girl
To get the best of both worlds
We must obey the law
What good's a place to stand up
Without a place to fall?

Two and one
Fast and slow girl
The best of both worlds
Double fun
I'd like to now propose a toast
To the best of both worlds

I think about the war that is no fight at all
I think about the peace that is a fight for all
The best of both worlds
Keep it on
Fast and slow girl
The best of both worlds
Tight as a drum, loose as a gun holster
Yeah, it's getting closer

Why do we waste our breath, child
On what we like the most
Seeing as we've wound up here
We ought to do them both

Back and forth
We get the most
Yeah, the best of both worlds
South and north
I'd like to now propose a toast
To the best of both worlds
Two and one
Fast and slow girl
The best of both worlds
Double fun
We'll make the most girl to get the best of both worlds
