Got me the strangest woman
Believe me this trick's no cinch
But I really get her going
When I get out my big ten inch

Record of a band that plays the blues
Well, a band that plays the blues
She just love my big ten inch
Record of her favorite blues

Now now hey

Last night I tried to tease her
I gave my love a little pinch
She said, "Now stop that jivin'
Now whip out your big ten inch."

Record of a band that plays the blues
Well, a band that plays the blues
She just loves my big ten inch
Record of her favorite blues

I, I, I cover her with kisses
And when we're in a lover's clinch
She gets all excited
When she begs for my big ten inch

Record of a band that plays the blues
Well, a band that plays the blues
She just love my big ten inch
Record of her favorite blues

My girl don't go for smokin'
And liquor just make her flinch
Seem she'll go for nothin'
Suck on my big ten inch

Record of a band that plays the blues
Band that play the blues
She just love my big ten inch
Record of her favorite blues
