There has been a question circling in my mind
About the feelings that I cannot find
What I want to know is why I view this way
Is this the image you want to portray?

My friends say, "Dan, why are you so negative?"
I say it's the world in which I live
They say, "Dan, why are you so negative?"
I say that it's the world in which I live - GO!

Give it a go
Give it a shot
That's what they say

I never denied
Giving it a try
So get off my back

Do all you can
Live up your life
So get off my back

I never denied
Living my life
So forget all those thoughts

Rock Out!

Give It a go
Give it a shot
That's what they say

I never denied
Giving it a try
So give it a rest

Do all you can
Live up your life
So I've been told

I never denied
Living my past
So die all your thoughts

Rock Out!

There has been a question in my mind
About the feelings that I cannot find
I never denied
I never denied
There has been a question in my mind
About the feelings that I cannot find
I never denied
I never denied

Questions I cannot find - I never denied
Feelings I cannot find - I never denied
Why you view this way - I never denied
Image want to portray - I never denied

LATES!!!
