I met an old friend today
In the caf on the hill
To see him after all these years
Somehow did not seem strange
We laughed and reminisced about
The life we used to live
And I could tell at least with him
That nothing much had changed
An invitation to the party
Was all he had to offer
'Everyone will be there
And all the high you need is free'
As he checked the time and he paid the check
He said 'we ought to hurry'
And I could tell the one he was talking to
Was the old me

And I said Look a little closer
(Look closer)
Can't you see that I have changed?
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I am not the girl I used to be
My life is rearranged
Look a little closer
(Look closer)
I'm not the one I use to be
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I gave my heart to Jesus
And He gave a brand new life to me

As we began to leave the table
And we started for the door
In my heart there was a stirring
And I knew there was something more
In his eyes there was an emptiness
That only Jesus could fill
It reminded me of how I use to be
Before I accepted Him
After an awkward moment
He broke the silence when he said:
'I've hear about a Savior
Or was it something that I've read?
But I don't need religion
There's nothing to it anyway'
I asked him if he wouldn't mind
If we, if we took time to pray

Lord, help him look a little closer
(Look closer)
Help him feel Your loving touch
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Remove the blinders and change his heart
Surround him with Your love
Lord, help him look a little closer
(Look closer)
Help him know that You are near
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Do for him what You've done for me
Lord, set my brother free, yeah, yeah

Set my brother free
Would You do that for me, yes
Oh, Lord, my Lord
Set my brother free, oh, yeah
Jesus makes a difference
He is everything you need

Lord, help him look a little closer
(Look closer)
Help him know that You are near
I am not the girl I used to be
My life is rearranged
Look a little closer
(Look closer)
I'm not the one I use to be
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I gave my life to Jesus
And He gave a brand new life to me, yeah

(Look closer)
Help him feel Your loving touch
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Remove the blinders and change his heart
Surround him with Your love
Lord, help him look a little closer
(Look closer)
Help him know that You are near
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Do for him what You've done for me
Lord, set my brother free

(Look closer)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I am not the girl I used to be
My life is rearranged
Yeah, yeah, look a little closer
(Look closer)
I'm not the one I use to be
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I gave my life to Jesus
And He gave a brand new life to me

Jesus, set me free
And He alone is worthy
Yes, He alone is worthy
Just look a little closer
