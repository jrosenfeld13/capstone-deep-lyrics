I think I'm missing something
A subtle target on my heart
I think I'm missing someone
And that someone is you

I want you right here
I want you right now
You want me, you got me
Right here, right now
Right now

So take a step back, tell me what you wanted
Falling off the deep end, feeling guilty as charged
Bullets are scene

So take your time
I want it all in just one sentence
So I can comprehend
Why you left me stranded, torn and useless
Words can't describe the pain I feel inside
So tell me why you left me
Make this story easy, easy come easy go
And what I love so deeply
Is kind of short and crazy
I want to see you before you go
Giving up on you is the hardest thing I'll ever have to do
Keep this in mind as you waste your time with him
It's so over-rated

What you said wasn't what you meant
