[Verse 1]
Clear the way for the prophets of rage
Engaging on the stage, on a track, t ell Jack stay in the back
I was born
Every level I'm on, you're warned
Just in case you forgot, I pump in kilowatts
To let 'em know which direction
To go what's up I wanna know
I test the front row
Forgiven the giving while the living is living it up
So many people are sleeping while standing up
Not dressed to impress or fess it
That's it test to the brain like FedEx
Treated one and the same beause the name of the game
Don't give 'em checks above necks
Some don't realize we're on the same side
Subdity in the city, suburbs or projects
But we're living in a different time
Some speed, some lead while some just pump rhymes
Then again we're all in the same gang
Info to flow and heal all below
Let's go and find the piece of mind that's taken
Or else the black starts breakin'
Public Enemy Number One
Public Enemy Number One
Public Enemy Number One
Public Enemy Number One
Public Enemy Number One
Public Enemy Number One
Public Enemy Number One

[Outro]
"One, one, one, ooh-ha!"
Public Enemy
Apocalypse '91... The Enemy Strikes Black
Hardcore will never die
"Bring that beat back, man! Bring that beat back! Bring that beat back!"
