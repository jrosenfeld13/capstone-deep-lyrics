I see the morning sun
Coming over the hill
Sorrow and pain for me
Coming over the hill

I'm very sad
Lost love for me
But i will love again

I know a man
Who breaks every heart that he can
I know him well
For i have been hurt by this man

I'm very sad
Tears follow me
But i will love again

I'm very sad
Tears follow me
But i will love again

I know a man
Who promises that he'll be true
And i look back once again
Well, what else could i do ?

I'm very sad
But he is true
And we will love again

I see the morning sun
Coming over the hill
I see him and he says
That he'll stay
And he will

I'm sad no more
He comforts me
And we will love again
