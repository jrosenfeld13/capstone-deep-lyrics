I started by giving you brace yourself
And how it made you feel, I have look farther than your face to tell
Brace your family, consider yourself warned
Lets come together, and watch hell mourn
Good defeats evil, theres no showdown
Been watching the world unravel and wrote it down
If you didnt know, then you know it now
Ladies and gentlemen welcome to my second go around

I remember when I had my mind and almost lost it
I saw the bodies that you were hiding inside the closet
Im just a man, thoughts, a pilot, and Microsoft Office
You can either choose to be a prophet or make a profit
Forget tradition, I would prefer to do both
And say what needs to be said because you wont
Before continuing its essential you prove to me
You even understand what this instrumental can do to me
Youre putting your entire life on the line
Trying to be my wife believing I am right in my mind
Youre using prayers as weapons
I hope that youre aware theyre annulling your marriage at the reception
I swear that these amateurs are obsessed with Inception
Planting ideas they stole in the your minds  arrest them
I offer advice, experience, and suggestions
15 bucks for an hour and twenty minute session so you can
Is rap dead and in need of a resurrection?
Your fans put your record in for a second and press rejection
You think youre so dope; stop  I doubt you kill it
We need to stop for a minute talk about your feelings because uh
When life is quality love is the stipulation
Youll suffer when the policys hate and manipulation
You wont apologize when youre severing all the ties
If Waking disoriented by empty bottles of wine
But if you sever ties when youre wearing a suit and tie
Its like youre severing the bind between you and the suicide
I grew up the youngest of six
And it might have to do with becoming this sick as if it was something I wished
And I dont mean sick as in amazing at what I do
I mean whatevers wrong with me came to me and its coming for you
You offer disproval, saying you cant get used to me
As if I care youre not a fan of ambiguity so you can

Take a ride on my mood swing
Tell me, what do you see?
Take a ride on my mood swing
It might explain why I do things
Take a ride on my mood swing
Tell me, what do you see
Take a ride on my mood swing
If you don't like it you can sue me

Good evening, welcome to my album, only if I
Could, be me, then I would leave this asylum and this
Choir of demons, then I could be free and not be
Required to seem even keel when I flip the script I have written and get
Even, and resemble what I run away from
I mirror the horrors that manifest once they come
I try to counteract what I asked for, but since its my fault
Im too consumed in whats unseen as soon as its nightfall
I used to dream when I was under my own spell
But now I look at what my immaturity viewed as likely like oh well
If you cant see the tragedy there youre in danger of being too far gone
And subsequently like me you accept it with no choice but to march on
Soldiers only lay down and die when they feel they have nothing to stand for
Looking the devil in the eye and shouting is this all youve got I DEMAND MORE
Can I really hide in a church to avoid Satan OR is that exactly what he wants
Cause if I stay there then I help no one and its all about me and the ambience
I finna comeback with a riddle but given the fact that Im on one
On what? Whatevers got me so high strung, yet undone
I wonder if all of this wonderings even worth the time I invest in it
Be a church of open arms and healing, not the one with the best image

Take a ride on my mood swing
Tell me, what do you see?
Take a ride on my mood swing
It might explain why I do things
Take a ride on my mood swing
Tell me, what do you see
Take a ride on my mood swing
If you don't like it you can sue me
