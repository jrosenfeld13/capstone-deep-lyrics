Well I'm searching for somethin'
That I can't reach
So I whisper your name
In my sleep

N' time it isn't giving me
The space that I need
But you know at this pace
I don't think
I can
Pull into the lead

Forgiving myself is too simple too hard
There's got to be another way
To stop this car

But you know
Somehow we get there
Through the blind night
We got the while lines flashing past the tip of our headlights
Somehow we get there
From whatever we are
Somehow we get there
No matter how far

'Cause I can't
Carry this around anymore
It's getting heavier with age
It is the boulder in my stomach
It's the avalanche in my veins

So let's leave it behind
I want to bury it beside the road
I will sit there until it comes out of me
I'll be freezing in the summer desert cold

But you know
Somehow we get there
Through the blind night
We got the white lines flashing past the tips of our head lights
Somehow we get there
From wherever we are
Somehow we get there
No matter how far

So hold my head
While I rock
Myself back to sleep
And I tell you that I am not easy
And you tell me that I am
Sweet
