You taste of potato chips in the morning
Your face has the Marlon Brando club calling
And who would have thought that I'd owe it all to Tulsa
And that fat guy with the green shirt that we both signed together
Once he hears this song won't live it down forever

Your suit was the whitest thing since you-know-who
I fear that that savior I mentioned may be you
And who would have thought that I'd owe it all to Tulsa
And that poor girl who waited in the rain for hours to meet me (not you, baby)
Once she hears this song won't live it down completely

And I owe it all to Tulsa, Oklahoma
This is just a reminder
Of the antique shop that I want to go back to and visit when it's open
In Tulsa, Oklahoma
Just in case you don't appreciate this song about you
