Dirty street and dirty hands
A broken kid and a helpless man
All that they know given the barren land
A storefront clerk told me, "Walk away
You need not live this life of shame."
I said, "Hold on my friend, for you will find a way."

You cannot break it, love will help you make it
Don't throw yourself in a burning fire
And when you come home, singing all your sad songs
Why don't you leave it in the water
For the friends and all the lovers tonight

Turning back I want to leave it again
Losing track I want to leave it again, leave it again
I'm running out
Alright

So tell me what's you weight in gold
Will it amount to what you made when the story's told, no
Don't turn your head, let all the people know

You cannot break it, love will help you make it
Don't throw yourself in a burning fire
And when you come home, singing all your sad songs
Why don't you leave it in the water
For the friends and all the lovers tonight

And when you feel like you're alone and no one's by your side
Open your hands, open your heart, and open your eyes
Although the flame is out, the answers have been left behind
So don't pretend you understand what you have yet to find
It's alright, yeah it's alright, c'mon

You cannot break it, love will help you make it
Don't throw yourself in a burning fire
And when you come home, singing all your sad songs
Why don't you leave it in the water

You cannot break it, love will help you make it
Don't throw yourself in a burning fire
And when you come home, singing all your sad songs
Why don't you leave it in the water
For the friends and all the lovers tonight
