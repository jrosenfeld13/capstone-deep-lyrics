I've got to say it now
And I'll explain somehow
The way I feel about the way we are
I know no other way that just to say it straight
I want to shout it from the rooftops

'Cos you wake me up and light me up
When your eyes start dancing with my mind
You fill me up and cheer me up
I wanna tell you time after time

Every little thing that I do reminds me of you
All I wanna do is make love to ya
I breathe in and breathe out in every breath there's no doubt
All I wanna do is make love to ya

You've put a spell on me
And baby hopefully you'll never break the spell I'm under
Whatever this shall be
I know you've made me see a feeling louder than the thunder

'Cos you wake me up and light me up
When your eyes start dancing with my mind
You fill me up and cheer me up
I wanna tell you time after time

Every little thing that I do reminds me of you
All I wanna do is make love to ya
I breathe in and breathe out in every breath there's no doubt
All I wanna do is make love to ya

Every little thing that I do reminds me of you
All I wanna do is make love to ya
I breathe in and breathe out in every breath there's no doubt
All I wanna do is make love to ya

I've got to say it now
But I'll explain somehow
The way I feel about the way we are
I know no other way than just to sat it straight
I want to shout it from the rooftops

'Cos you wake me up and light me up
When your eyes start dancing with my mind
You fill me up and cheer me up
I wanna tell you time after time

Every little thing that I do reminds me of you
All I wanna do is make love to ya
I breathe in and breathe out in every breath there's no doubt
All I wanna do is make love to ya
