I talk only to the dead
They are the only ones I trust
They are the ones who understand
Everything inside of me has turned to dust

I dont exist, I dont resist
I only miss the chance to live
I dont exist, I dont resist
All I ever be is this mystic bliss

You are all confused
You dont understand
You are just as good as bad
Just feel the bullet in your head

You dont exist, you dont resist
You only miss the chance to live
