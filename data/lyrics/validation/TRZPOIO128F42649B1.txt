[Verse]
I got a wild thing for you
Were talking hoops you got me jumping through
You got those lemon drop martini eyes
And if my karma suits you would cross the line into another place & time
Tell me how pretty she is when she turns the colors of the rainbow
One more day with you Trip Hopping
One more night with you no stopping
Ain't no smoking fantasy because love you is tripping to me
You got me cycled in size? you got my situation bonified
It took a sunset to get me to see
That i all really needed was your love to yeah forever shine on me
You promised promised you & me is like waiting for your ectasy
That one more day with you trip hopping yeah
One more night with you no stopping
Get my way with you trip hopping
In my kaliediscope i'm looking through my only color was a neon blue
I was hanging on to yesterday and now the only way i get through
I'll be on my rainbow is my laying down your end of pillow

[Outro]
One more day with you trip hopping
One more night with you no stopping
Ain't no smoking fantasy because love you is tripping to me
One more day with you trip hopping
One more night with you no stopping
Get my way with you trip hopping
One more day with you trip hopping
