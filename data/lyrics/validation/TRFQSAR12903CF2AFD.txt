Tick, tock, tick, tock

Life is not a race, theres always time
Let her go, let her go, let her go, its only time, only time

All this stress, give it away
Make it best, not every day
You dont want to be slave
Liberate yourself from trouble

Let your thoughts, want her today
Take your claws, throw them away
No alarm, leave it to fate
Trust me, I am on the level

Life is not a race, theres always time
Let her go, let her go, let her go, its only time, only time

All this stress, give it away
Make it best, not every day
Run along, leave it to fate
Trust me, you will feel much better

Life is not a race, theres always time
Let her go, let her go, let her go, its only time
The hourglass is broken, its a sign
Let her go, let her go, let her go, its only time, only time

Life is not a race, theres always time
Let her go, let her go, let her go, its only time
The hourglass is broken, its a sign
Let her go, let her go, let her go, its only time, only time
