Devil made you high
Devil may she hide you
The long forgotten bones
To stand in fields & shadows
Never oh so alone
The street lights and their guidance
Shall find their own way home
Find their own way home
Devil may you know her
Through the cloudy days
With grace of gods and holding
In her arms embrace
In her arms embrace
Step outside this moment
And see yourself in mine
See that the these lights are golden
Come wait for awhile
Wait for awhile
Devil dont you wait up
Cause I will be back home
Through the thoughtless jungles
That ride the tubes back home
To see the light are waiting
And see that my babys home
That my babys home
Step outside this moment
And see yourself in mine
See that these light are golden
Come stay for awhile
