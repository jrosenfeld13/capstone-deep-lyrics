I, I wonder where you are, ah
Why, why did you have to go?
I would give anything to you
The love that we shared was all so true
Wanna be by your side!
I'll be the one, who'll stand by your side
Wanna be there to hold you whenever you cry
My comfort will guide you and make you believe that
I'll be the one that you need
I'll be the one
I, I didn't need your lies, no
I've tried to tell you one more time
That I would give anything to you
The love that we shared was all so true
Wanna be by your side!
I'll be the one, who'll stand by your side
Wanna be there to hold you whenever you cry
My comfort will guide you and make you believe that
I'll be the one that you need
I'll be the one, I'll be the one
My comfort will guide you and make you believe that
I'll be the one that you need
I'll be the one
I'll be the one, who'll stand by your side
Wanna be there to hold you whenever you cry
My comfort will guide you and make you believe that
I'll be the one that you need
I'll be the one, who'll stand by your side
Wanna be there to hold you whenever you cry
My comfort will guide you and make you believe that
I'll be the one that you need
(The one that you need)
I'll be the one that you need
I'll be the one
