There's just no way to say how much I love you
You never made me cry
And that's just fine
Only got my fear
To put above you;
You know we all get scared from time to time

Love me with your head and heart;
Love me from the place it starts
Love me from your head and heart;
Love me like a child

There's just no way to play the things I'm feeling;
No way to tell you all the things you mean
Everyday I only feel like stealing
Away to where I know I can be clean

Love me with your head and heart;
Love me from the place it starts
Love me from your head and heart;
Love me when I'm wild

Laying down the ways to say I need you
Scared of looking tall and feeling small
Running through the days I have beside you
Scared of being wrong and that's it all

Love me with your head and heart;
Love with your very self
Love me with your head and heart;
Love me like a child

There's just no way to say how much I love you
You never made me cry
And that's just fine
Only got my fate
A bird above you;
You know we all get scared from time to time

Love me with your head and heart;
Love me from the very start
Love me with your head and heart;
Love me like a child
