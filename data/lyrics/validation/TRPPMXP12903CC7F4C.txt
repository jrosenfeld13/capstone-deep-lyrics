With the military capitulation in 1940
Weapons are sheltered away
Contact is kept by officers
Resistance is growing by the day
Some men fight for freedom
Some men die for you
Some men fight the oppressor
Warriors of the Milorg group
By Allied Support
They are trained to reclaim the North
With Sten guns in hand
They serve their kingdom and land
Some men fight for freedom
Some men die for you
Some men fight the oppressor
Warriors of the Milorg group
Airdropped in the cold mountains
Crossing the Nordic sea
Camouflaged by the inaccessible nature
Sabotaging the German War Machine
While depressions and negativity
Is ravaging our land
Their youthful battle spirit
Ignites the resistance
Their courage and will
A growing inspiration
To stand up and fight
For the day of liberation
