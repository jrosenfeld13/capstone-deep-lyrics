Real talk
I'm a attracted to you
Wanna do something to you
Wanna feel your body all over mine
Tell me what your feeling
Can we make this happen
We can get this crackin' in no time
But there's one condition
Before we get to sexin'
Promise me that you won't get to attached
Don't start catching feelings
Wanna start having children
Baby I'm the wrong for that

Real as I can be with you
I just want to creep with you
I ain't trying to be your man
Girl I hope you understand

When you
Wanna get broken off girl
Need someone to call girl
Wanna be the one who fills that void
As much as I would like to
The one thing that I can't do
Is get in another relationship at this point
So lets keep it simple
And do out the dizzle
This way no one gets hurts, baby
At least I'm being up front girl
Telling you what I want girl
Let me know if this works for you

Real as I can be with you
I just want to creep with you
I ain't trying to be your man
Girl I hope you understand

Real talk this is
Real talk this is
Real talk this is
Real talk this is
Real talk this is
Real talk this is
Real talk

Real as I can be with you
I just want to creep with you
I ain't trying to be your man
Girl I hope you understand

Real as I can be with you
I just want to creep with you
I ain't trying to be your man
Girl I hope you understand

Real as I can be with you
I just want to creep with you
I ain't trying to be your man
Girl I hope you understand
