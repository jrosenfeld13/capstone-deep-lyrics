There stands the glass, fill it up to the brim
Till my troubles grow dim, it's my first one today

There stands the glass, that will ease all my tears
That will settle my brain, brother, I'm on my way

I wonder where you are tonight
And I wonder if you are alright
I wonder if you think of me in my misery

There stands the glass, fill it up to the brim
Till my troubles grow dim, it's my first one today

I wonder where you are tonight
And I wonder if you are alright
I wonder if you think of me in my misery

There stands the glass, fill it up to the brim
Till my troubles grow dim, it's my first one today
