Everybody want it
Everybody need it
Everybody got to have it
Everybody knows

Lookin' for some, sugar sugar, sugar sugar, sugar sugar in my life!
Sugar sugar, sugar sugar, sugar sugar in my life !

When the day is over
And the work is done
That's when I got to find my baby
Shes the only one

Lookin' for some, sugar sugar, sugar sugar, sugar sugar in my life!
Sugar sugar, sugar sugar, sugar sugar in my life !

Mama always told me
Don't yah be no fool
Take some time to share your lovin'
That's the golden rule

Got to have some, sugar sugar, sugar sugar, sugar sugar in my life!
Sugar sugar, sugar sugar, sugar sugar in my life!
Sugar sugar, sugar sugar, sugar sugar in my life!
Sugar sugar, sugar sugar, sugar sugar in my life!
Sugar sugar, sugar sugar, sugar sugar in my life!
