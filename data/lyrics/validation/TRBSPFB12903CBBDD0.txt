An address to the stillborn, lost brothers in arms;
To see the cursed earth claim to providence;
A pyramid New Jerusalem
The dream is dead
We're burning the carcass clean
We pretend-but we never sleep

500 miles to the faultline
We decompose and decay

Captivating the moment
Spread the disease
"We come in peace"
As if we almost believed it
"Strapped to the back of a live grenade"

If there was ever a saviour
She'd be the first to leave

500 miles to the faultline
We decompose and decay
Ten thousand leagues through
The coal mines
We hesitate and comply

Equal in death only, subject to
Our own betrayal
Inhuman, suspending reality;
What you see is truthful, but lacking
Misinformation is the new black
Perfect rejects, we're all incomplete
Disfigured at birth, we're
The human debris
We're freaks
We live
We die. beneath the faultlines
One more truth to bury

500 miles to the faultline
We hesitate at the light
One day we rise through
The cold tide
And face away from this
Dead end failure to see
