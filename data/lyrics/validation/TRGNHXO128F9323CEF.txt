I don't plant crops and
I don't build fences
I don't ride on railroads
And I don't dig trenches
I'm living in between
The earth and sky
I don't go to school
I don't go to churches
I don't visit graveyards
I don't know the purpose of 'em
I'm living in between
The earth and sky
Following phone lines
To good times and bad times
Under the starlight
Under the moon
Shining down on me
Shining down on me
I'd write letters
But i'd never send 'em
The post script on 'em
Is never ending
I'm living in between
The earth and sky
I'm living in between
The earth and sky
