[Verse 1: Spank Rock]
It musta been the stance that got you, stopped all them clown niggas that danced around and watched
Threw a glance in a flash I found
Your little fingers in the buckles that my pants were bound to
Now may the force be with you, shirt wetter than the crevice that my claws just slipped through
Closer to dawn
I bet your jaws look like they swallow stars as my saber sets through
Now tell me how you feel about it
When I'm out though you might just have to dream about it, Hot

[Hook: Spank Rock] (x4)
You know all I really wanna do is (touch me)
You the angel of my dreams, girl you must be

[Bridge]
Ooh you're so lovely
Will you think of me
Trust you to trust me
I could touch you softly
Or love you toughly
We could get comfy
Want you to want me
Please say you love me

[Verse 2: Typical Girls]
Boy if you wanna dip in this
Swim at your own risk you might sink in this
I ain't the bitch to be flashin' my tits
Plus your little broke bling look ridiculous
So you dream about it, go and think about it
Act on it and your ass might leave without it
Think I bluff then shout it
Dumb dude you doubt it
Do what you got to do
But the bitch is bout it, Hot

[Hook] (x4)

[Verse 3: Spank Rock]
I had one on the futon
One in the shower
One in the back seat
Three this past hour
One in the balcony, two on the dance floor
I need a seat I can't stand no more
Ho I ain't tired back it up to the sofa
Spread twist a little pump back then bend over
Test is getting harder, you must be getting smarter
Huddle form a game plan then break like Nell Carter
