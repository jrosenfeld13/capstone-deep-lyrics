[Intro/Chorus]
'Cause I'm free
Because I'm free
'Cause I'm free
Because I'm free

[Verse 1]
A message from the other world
To every little boy and girl
Let your spirit fly until
The day I let the flag unfurl

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm free
I'm faster than a shadow
'Cause I'm free
Because I'm free

[Verse 2]
I left my home and everything
I know that I'll be back again
When everything is what it seems
Reality becomes a dream

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm free
Freer than the wind blows
'Cause I'm free
'Cause I'm free

[Verse 3]
All the things I wanna be, and all the places I wanna see
And all the things I never had that I know are mine
All my friends and family, I know they'll always come with me
I am a messenger and I tell you why

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm free
Faster than a shadow
'Cause I'm free
Freer than the wind blows

[Bridge]
If I should walk, if I should run
I know this time I'm comin' home

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm free
Freer than the wind blows
'Cause I'm free
Faster than a shadow
'Cause I'm free
No one I have to follow
'Cause I'm free
Freer than tomorrow
'Cause I'm free
Because I'm Free
