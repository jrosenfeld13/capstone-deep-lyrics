I embody this defective lifestyle
And I endanger everything, I praise the horns within

Ill flush my soul down the drain
And I'll use you and throw you down a hole
As hell is my witness, I have sold my soul

Label me
Label me
Label me into what you want

I hate everything around me, trust is overrated
And I contaminate those feelings, you'll die without me leaving

I loathe you, won't pull you through
I loathe you, you're cancer in my room

Label me
Label me
Label me into what you want

I loathe you, won't pull you through
I loathe you, this cancer in my room
