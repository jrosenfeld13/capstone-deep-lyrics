Mowgli: Can you hear it?
Yea...man!
Y-y-yyyyyea!
Now I'm the king of the swingers, Oh, The jungle V.I.P
I reached the top, and had to stop
And that's what's bothering me!
I wan'na be a man, mancub
And stroll right into town
And be just like the other men
I'm tired of monkeying around
Oh, Ohbeedoo
I wan'na be like you! [abee dobee dobee]
I wan'na walk like you, [ching]
Talk like you do [ching]
You'll see it's true [shobee doo]
An ape like me [shobee dobee dobee]
Can learn to be
Human too!
Now don't try to kid me mancub
I made a deal with you
What I desire is man's red fire
To make my dream come true
Now Gimmie the secret man cub
C'mon tell me what to do
Give me the power of man's red flower
So I can be like you
Oh, Ohbeedoo
I wan'na be like you! [abee dobee dobee]
I wan'na walk like you, [ching]
Talk like you do [ching]
You'll see it's true [shobee doo]
An ape like me [shobee dobee dobee]
Can learn to be
Human too!
Mowgli: Check this out!
Can you hear it?
Y-y-yyyyyea!
(Elephant Noise)
Moglee: Hit it papa bear!
(Instrumental Break)
Yeah, you!
I wan'na be like you! [abee dobee dobee]
I wan'na walk like you, [ching]
Talk like you do [ching]
You'll see it's true [shobee doo]
An ape like me [shobee dobee dobee]
Can learn to be
Human too!
I can learn to be
Someone like me
I can learn to be
Someone like you
I can learn to be
Someon like me!
Mowgli: Yea, man!
