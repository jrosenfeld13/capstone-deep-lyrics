When a friend betrays
You can hit rock bottom
Love and trust
Forgotten
Love and trust forgotten
I see a streak of deceipt and lies
You're living in a man-made paradise

Don't bite the that feeds you
If you bite it too hard it will only bleed
Don't bite the hand that that feeds you
You've bitten, you've bitten too hard
You've bitten too hard

When you go to shake a hand
Do you see the watch before you see the man
What goes up must come down
Do you hold out your hand
Or would you let him drown

Don't bite the that feeds you
If you bite it too hard it will only bleed
Don't bite the hand that that feeds you
You've bitten, you've bitten too hard
Do you open your hand
Or make a fist
Do you wipe the brow or hit hard

I can see what you're doing to me
You're feeding off my insecurity
Naivety is the word

So don't bite the that feeds you
If you bite it too hard it will only bleed
Don't bite the hand that that feeds you
You've bitten, you've bitten too hard
Don't you know you've bitten you've bitten
Too hard
