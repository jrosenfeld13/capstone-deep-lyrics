There was a time when life
Was easy
My heart did soar for what
The future stored and life
It pleased me
But it's all gone now
Gone away now
Far away
My life it's changed or have
I rearranged what was
My life
What once brought fright
Now seems oh so trite
And I'm scared
Catastrophe and calamity
Are the norm now
And life seems like some
Old forgotten dream
Far away
But when I look into
Your eyes
I forget myself and
My sighs
I'm alone with you on
The sea
On a crystal sea
