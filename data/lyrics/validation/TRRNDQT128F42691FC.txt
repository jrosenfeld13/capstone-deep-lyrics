I don't want to be a memory
Just a shadow in your mind
Wanna be the one you always need
Not the one you left behind

I don't want to be a notch in your handle
Another love casualty
So lay back down and let's talk it over
'Cause I don't want to be a memory

Don't you remember how it used to be
When we were so in love
We spent the nights in a two-room flat
Drinking wine from a coffee cup

Making love was so very easy
We couldn't get enough
I never dreamed there would come a time
When you'd think about giving me up

I don't want to be a memory
Just a shadow in your mind
I wanna be the one you always need
Not the one you left behind

I don't want to be a notch in your handle
Another love casualty
So lay back down and let's talk it over
'Cause I don't want to be a memory

I know you've had other lovers
But that's all history
I got to know that you'll let me be the last one
To share your company

I don't want to be a memory
Just a shadow in your mind
I wanna be the one you always need
Not the one you left behind

I don't want to be a notch in your handle
Another love casualty
So lay back down and let's talk it over
'Cause I don't want to be

I don't want to be a memory
Just a shadow in your mind
I wanna be the one you always need
Not the one you left behind
I don't want to be a memory
