Watching the world go by (watching the world go by)
Under a sunny sky (sunny sky)
Strolling 'round the park on a Sunday afternoon (Sunday afternoon)
Oh how the moments fly (oh how the moments fly)
Watching the world go by (the world go by)
When you're with your love
Life is a beautiful tune (life is a beautiful tune)

Even if clouds are there
Way up above
For us the day is always fair cuz we're in love
Others may have some tears, others may cry
Darling not you and I (not you and I)
We'll spend years and years and years
Watching the world go by

(Watching the world go by) Some day Sunday
(Under a sunny sky) When church is through love
(Strolling round the park on Sunday afternoon) Hand and hand 'neath a crimson sky
We will dream as the world goes by
(Oh how the moments fly) One day one day
(Watching the world go by ) Dreams will come true love
(When you're with your love ) They'll be beautiful days to see
(Life is a beautiful tune) In the future with me
(Even if clouds are there) Each tomorrow
(Way up above) We'll be fair
(For us the day is always fair 'cause we're in love) Free from sorrow just as long as you care
Others may have some tears (others may have some tears)
Darling not you and I (not you and I)
We'll spend years and years and years
Watching the world go by
