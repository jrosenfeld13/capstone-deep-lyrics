Through my soul I can life forever
The sense of death is the escape of life
But I'm neither angel still devil
No ghost - No human being
In the maze of torment rules fear and pain
The priest of doom guard above
In the maze of torment rules fear and pain
The priest of darkness guard above offer dead corpse
In that can die eternal
In realm of souls - I sorrow for new life
Through my soul - I can't die
Through my soul - Let me alone
Dooms day near - revenge is here - mirrors broke
Soul in hope - Soon i'll be death
Trough my painless soul I can life forever
The sense of death - In human sacrifice...
...sacrifice... sacrifice... sacrifice...
