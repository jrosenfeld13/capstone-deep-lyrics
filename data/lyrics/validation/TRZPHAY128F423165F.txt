There you stand saying youre all in black
And the weight thats on my back
Could bend a man and Im sure it would
But Im not sure I see one
Say whats come between us
Say what we've come to

Late at night when Im all alone
And I look out the window
The room feels right, kind of spinning round
So the drink is working
Say whats come between us
Say what we've come to
Am I never to stand your forever man
Never to stand your forever man

She could stand there all day for all Id notice
She could lie there all night for all I care
Say whats come between us
Say what we've come to
Am I never to stand your forever man
Never to stand your forever man
