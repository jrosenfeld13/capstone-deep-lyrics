Here alone now I'm staring at the sea
Behind the far horizon
Is there a better place for me?

Afraid to drown, afraid to dive
Scared by fears and the hot sunlight, yeah

And I dance in the rain, dive in the pool of life
Wash away the poison
And I dance through this pain, my body in a starless night
To wash away the poison from my soul

Between the devil and the deep sea
I don't know how to carry on
I only feel that inner force that's pushing me along

The tides of life bring clarity for my tumbling mind
I'll dive to see, set me free

And I dance in the rain, dive in the pool of life
Wash away the poison
And I dance through this pain, my body in a starless night
To wash away the poison from my soul, turn it to gold
