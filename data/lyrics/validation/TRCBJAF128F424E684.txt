Slit my wrists
Bathe in the ecstasy of my pain
The trial of a mortal soul
Begging to die
Lost life in faith
All faith is gone
Hate replaces all love
Fallen - not alone this time

Drowning in my own blood
Wounds ripped open
Never wanting to go back
Never again to be tortured like this

My words are
Spit back at me
Moments - days to die for
Drowned out by screams
I was warned I ignored
Falsely finding hope in the abyss
Lost everything in nothing

Drowning in my own blood
Wounds ripped open
Never wanting to go back
Never again to be tortured like this

Lost life in faith, all faith is gone

Tear out my inside
Take everything for your selfish kind
Followed in line, led deep into failure
Blind to reality
