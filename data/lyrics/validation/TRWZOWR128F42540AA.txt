[Verse 1]
It's a Saturday night
Nothing will go wrong
But if it does do I care?
I just dont know how to run
It's a saturday night
And I hope you believe
My heart is calling your name
So hear me out when I say

[Chorus x2]
I can see it in her eyes
When she turns to me and smiles
Everything feels so right
Until the morning light

("Are you ready to party?!")

[Verse 1]

[Chorus x2]

("Are you ready?")

I can see it in her eyes
