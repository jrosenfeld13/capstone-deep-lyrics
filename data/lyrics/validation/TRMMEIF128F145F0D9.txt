Your homes are all-electric and your dreams are built to last
I walk the streets at night and see your image in each pane of glass
Passing by your houses, through your windows I can watch you all
The TV in the corner and the green and Chinese ladies on your wall
Build a better home in the phantom zone
Read the papers, light the tapers, worship with the news at ten
Film your own atrocities, it's time to crack the whip again
You clothe your body in synthetics
To celebrate some strange aesthetic
Your tongue is locked and your lips are hermetically sealed
Your relatives are white and all your children have record players
They listen to Tom Robinson, the Beatles and the Byrds and Leo Sayer
You take them to the zoo to watch the animals walk circles in their cages
Your politics are fashionable, you got them from the yellow pages
Build a better home in the phantom zone
It's funtime in the factories where they make the little batteries for your thrill machine
You say it's only therapy and doesn't mean a thing but it looks good to me
I caught you in the kitchen you were curing something itching or so you said
Then you turned off all the motors put away your toys and photos and crawled back to bed
Build a better home in the phantom zone
Go to parties, mix with artists, burn the candle at both ends
Be a winner, dress for dinner, kiss your food and eat your friends
Turn on the sound, tune in the static, set all controls to automatic
Your crash will be the more dramatic if you come as you go to the phantom zone
A better home in the phantom zone
