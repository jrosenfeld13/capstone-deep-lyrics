Fragile you are
And yet the strongest by far
Who's to save us now
That you've turned weak

I can see it in your eyes
I can feel it in my gut
Now we've really reached
The point of no return

(chorus)
We've all been traumatized
We were all a part of the revolution
We call the truth a lie
Too much got lost in translation

From my heart to your ears
Transforming words to tears
As vibrations of a string
Become a sound

I realize we're frail
Burnt-out and pale
Do you think we will ever learn to love again?

(chorus)
