Small bones small bodies, sink into semantics
The slightest excuse - the tiniest exo-skeleton
She said, the fossil, it sets such a standard
Forgetting the reason - small bones, bigger problems
With this, I miss you, I finally admit that
And beg forgiveness, my finest exo-skeleton
I am the fossil, we are the fossil, that beg forgiveness
Small bones small bodies

Small bones small bodies
Where's the harm in being accidentally miniaturized?
Who put the brakes on courages - my finest exo-skeleton?
She said, the fossil, it caused so much carnage
Forgetting the comeback - small bones, racist neighbours
With this, I miss you, I finally admit that
And beg forgiveness, my finest exo-skeleton
I am the fossil, we are the fossil, that beg forgiveness
Small bones small bodies

Grow into your body happily
Grow into your body happily
