Life chases fiction with contradiction
Pick yourself up, it's all right
Blood marks the pavement
So this is where I am
Well, stop the car and look around
We're getting nowhere

I'm not looking for a miracle
And I wasn't born a Kennedy
And I wonder if time would stop tomorrow
Would I hunger for things I never had?
Then I wonder, am I going to anyway?
I hunger for you and me, you and me

Gold, no I can see it beyond my reach
But I can't give up until it's mine
Green is how I see the fence's other side
There is no room for open minds, we need some action

I'm not looking for a miracle
And I wasn't born a Kennedy
And I wonder, if time would stop tomorrow
Would I hunger for things I never had?
Then I wonder, am I going to anyway?
I hunger for you and me, you and me

Let the water fall on me
And I wonder if time would stop tomorrow
Would I hunger for things I never had?
Then I wonder, am I going to anyway?
I hunger for you and me, you

And I wonder if time would stop tomorrow
Would I hunger for things I never had?
Then I wonder, am I going to anyway?
I hunger for you and me, you and me

For you and me
For you and me
For you and me
