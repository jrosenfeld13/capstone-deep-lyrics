So you think my heart's made of stone?
And when you're near me there's no reaction
Well, you're wrong

From the tip of my toes
My love for you steadily grows on and on
And each day you're not here
I'm so wracked with my tears
Not on the outside, but inside strong

I love you, I love you, baby
(Not on the outside)
Without you, I can't go on
(Not on the outside, but inside strong)
I need you, I need you so badly
(Not on the outside)
To keep this cold heart warm
(Oh, oh)

So when you smile at me
And I don't speak (Huh)
It's not that I don't care
But oh, oh, oh, I'm so weak
I'm so weak

Cause from my head to my toes
My love for you steadily grows
Not on the outside, but inside strong

I love you, I love you, baby
(Not on the outside)
Without you, I can't go on
(Not on the outside, but inside strong)
I need you, I need you so badly
To keep this cold heart warm
Oh, hmm, hmm

Ooooh, baby
(So you think my heart's made of stone)
And when you're near me there's no reaction
Girl, you're wrong

Cause from my head to my toes
My love for you steadily grows
Not on the outside (Not on the outside)
Not on the outside (Not on the outside)
Not on the outside (Not on the outside)
But oooh, but inside strong (Inside strong)

I want you
I need you, baby
Not on the outside (Not on the outside)
Not on the outside (Not on the outside)
Not on the outside (Not on the outside)
But oooh, but inside strong (Inside strong)

Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby
Not on the outside (Not on the outside)
Not on the outside (Not on the outside)
Not on the outside (Not on the outside)
But oooh, but inside strong (Inside strong)

I need ya
I need ya, baby
Not on the outside
Hey, oooh, oooh
Not on the outside (Not on the outside)
But oooh, but inside strong (Inside strong)

I love ya
I need ya
Oooh, I need ya, baby
Not on the outside (Not on the outside)
Not on the outside (Not on the outside)
Not on the outside (Not on the outside)
But oooh, but inside strong (Inside strong)
