[Verse 1]
I said a prayer for you
You didn't ask me to
But your face was locked in my mind

I saw you in a dream
Screaming out my name
And I know that something's not right

[Chorus]
Wherever you are
Wherever you are
I hope you read the words I've written in the stars

If you could hear my voice
I've never forgotten you
Wish I could let you know how wonderful you are
Wherever you are

Wherever you are
Wherever you are
Wherever you are

Wherever you are

[Instrumental]

Wherever you are
Wherever you are
Wherever you are
Wherever you are

[Verse 2]
Do you remember days
When we would drift away
I never thought we'd ever say goodbye

Now we're a world apart
But it's not so far
When our hearts are tangled in time

[Chorus]
Wherever you are
Wherever you are
I hope you read the words I've written in the stars

If you could hear my voice
I've never forgotten you
Wish I could let you know how wonderful you are
Wherever you are

Wherever you are
I hope you read the words I've written in the stars

If you could hear my voice
I've never forgotten you
Wish I could let you know how wonderful you are
Wherever you are

Wherever you are

[Instrumental]

Wherever you are
Wherever you are
Wherever you are

Wherever you are
Wherever you are
I hope you read the words I've written in the stars

If you can hear my voice
I've never forgotten you
Wish I could let you know how wonderful you are
Wherever you are
