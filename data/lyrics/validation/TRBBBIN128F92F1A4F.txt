Hey, that last summer day
When we hung out
I thought that it would last forever
You, knew it wasn't true
I'd known all the clues
Then I lost it to the weather

If I'd known what I know now
Wouldn't be surprised
Would have realized
Would have realized

Chorus:
This summertime
Why did you lie to me?
This summertime
Why don't you leave me be?
This summertime
You took away from me

Hey, the clouds have come around
How does that sound?
Knowing you won't last forever
Leaves are all falling down
And she's not around
Why couldn't we have worked together?

If I'd known what I know know now
Wouldn't be surprised
Of this demise
Would have realized

Chorus:
This summertime
Why did you lie to me?
This summertime
Why don't you leave me be?
This summertime

As winter gets colder
The weights getting bolder
I just run and hide
Why don't you run and hide?
Yeah, I don't want to see your face anymore
Don't you come around here anymore

Chorus:
This summertime
Why did you lie to me?
This summertime
Why don't you leave me be?
This summertime

You took away from me
