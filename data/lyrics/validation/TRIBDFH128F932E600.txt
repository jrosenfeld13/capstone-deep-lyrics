Rock my world
Welcome to my visions
Rock my world
We gonna have a party
Rock my world
Now it's time to start the show
So come on, rock my world

Rock, rock my world
Rock, rock my world

So here we are, standing strong
We've been inside the circus
Took the pleasure and pain
It's sometimes the same
I feel the power
So let the music move you

I'm back with my visions I know what to do
Let's rock the world 'cause this ones for you
Clap, scream, freak out and jam
Jump to the rhythm, shake that thang
We gonna have a party so here we go
Now let's get lose are you ready for the show
The countdown five, four, three, two, one
Rock my world I mean everyone

Today is the day and we're minutes away
Turn the lights down low 'cause it's time to play
Okay here and now we gonna rock to the rhythm
Rock to the groove and rock my world
Stand up we're about to start the show
Let's go with the flow in stere-ereo
I hear you screaming my heartbeat is rising
I give everything, let the party begin

Let the music take control now
Feel the passion of the night
This will be a night to remember
Here - now - we gonna have a party
