Said, I went down to the Turkish feast
People was eatin' like big wild geese
I'm on my way, I'm goin' back, Coney Isle

Talk about people have a devil of a time
Eatin' up chicken and a-drinkin' the wine
I'm on my way, I'm goin' back, Coney Isle

Bake that flapjack, bake him brown
Swing them flapjacks around, around
I'm on my way, I'm goin' back, Coney Isle

Make that featherbed and make it up a-right
Old Miner Brown are gonna stay all night
I'm on my way, I'm goin' back, Coney Isle

Some folks say that a coon won't steal
I caught three in my cornfield
I'm on my way, I'm goin' back, Coney Isle

One had a bushel and the other 'un had a peck
The other 'un had a roastin' ear tied around his neck
I'm on my way, I'm goin' back, Coney Isle

Coon is settin' on the end of a log
Finger on his trigger, but his eye on the hog
I'm on my way, I'm goin' back, Coney Isle

Gun went, "Boom!", the hog went, "Zip!"
Coon jumped on it with all of his grip
I'm on my way, I'm goin' back, Coney Isle

Along comes Sal, hoppin' down the street
Patent leather shoes and kitten feet
Good mornin' babe, hello now
Get over there Sal, sooey on now, babe

Hello Sal, I know you
One old slipper and a run-down shoe
Good morning now, sooey
Go on, Sal, get on over now, babe

People downtown gettin' so mean
It's chased the coons up a 'simmon tree
I'm on my way, I'm goin' back, Coney Isle

Makes no difference how the time may be
Everything in the world sure suits me
I'm on my way, I'm goin' back, Coney Isle

Get over, Sal, you ain't allowed in the street
Crawdad man done passed his gate
Go on now, sooey on, babe, get over now

When I get ready to leave this Earth
I look a-back, say my money's worth
I'm on my way, I'm goin' back, Coney Isle
