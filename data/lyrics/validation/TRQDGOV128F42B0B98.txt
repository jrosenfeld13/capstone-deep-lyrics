Your pretty face is not enough
Behind your eyes
I know your lying
You think that love is all a bluff
You flash your smile
And keep denying me
I want you to see
I need something more
Than you gave me for

I want you to burn
I want you to steal
I want you to bleed
And see how it feels

I want you to beg
I want you to crawl
Give more than you take
And smile through it all
And know that everything you do
I do it for you
.....I do it for you

I see your heart is broken
And your tears are real
No word unspoken
Say what you feel
The way you keep pretending
Its such a crime
You gotta give me whats mine

I want you to burn
I want you to steal
I want you to bleed
And see how it feels

I want you to beg
I want you to crawl
Give more than you take
And smile through it all
And know that everything you do
I do it for you

Your pretty face is not enough
Behind your eyes
I know your lying

I want you to burn
I want you to steal
I want you to bleed
And see how it feels

I want you to beg
I want you to crawl
Give more than you take
And smile through it all
And know that everything you do
I do it for you
