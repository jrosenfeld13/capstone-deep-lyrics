Long as I remember
The rain been comin' down
Clouds of myst'ry pourin'
Confusion on the ground
Good men through the ages
Tryin' to find the sun
And I wonder
Still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain

I went down Virginia
Seekin' shelter from the storm
Caught up in the fable
I watched the tower grow
Five-year plans and new deals
Wrapped in golden chains
And I wonder
Still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain

Heard the singers playin'
How we cheered for more?
The crowd had rushed together
Tryin' to keep warm
Still the rain kept pourin'
Fallin' on my ears
And I wonder
Still I wonder
Who'll stop the rain
