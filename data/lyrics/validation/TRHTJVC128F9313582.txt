My love is like footsteps in the snow, baby
I follow you everywhere you go, baby
The pain inside has come to wake you
But you will never realize
That I inspire the dreams that guide you, baby

You're half a world away
But in my mind I whisper every single word you say
And before you sleep at night
You pray to me, your lucky star, your singing satellite

Your singing satellite

You say a prayer
You say a prayer

You're half a world away
But in my mind I whisper every single word you say
And before you sleep at night
You pray to me, your lucky star, your singing satellite

I follow the winds that bring the cold, baby
I light a fire in your soul, baby
The lightest touch of feathers falling
My love may be invisible
But I inspire the dreams that guide you, baby

You're half a world away
But in my mind I whisper every single word you say
And before you sleep at night
You pray to me, your lucky star, your singing satellite
