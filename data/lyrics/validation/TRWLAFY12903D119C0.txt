Sunrise, and the new day's breaking through
The morning of another day without you
And as the hours roll by
No one's there to see me cry
Except the sunrise
The sunrise and you
Tired eyes drift across the shore
Looking for love and nothing more
But as the sea rolls by
No one's there to see me cry
Except the sunrise
The sunrise and you
Sunrise, bless my eyes
Catch my soul, make me whole again
Sunrise, new day heed my song
I'm tired of fighting and fooling around
But from now until who knows when?
My sword will be my friend
And I'll love you...love ya
For all of my time
Sunrise, bless my eyes
Catch my soul, make me whole again
(Repeat)
Sunrise
