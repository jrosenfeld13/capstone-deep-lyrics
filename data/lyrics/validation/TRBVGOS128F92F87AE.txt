The stone that the builders refused
Has become the head corner
The stone rejected by men
Has become the One to save them
The stone that stood alone
Has become the stone that brought them liberty

So don't feel bad when you don't fit in
With the world's fast pace
Don't be discouraged
When all of your friends, they laugh in your face

It's not so much the things you do
But it's just the stone that lies in you;
So don't you think you can't stand alone
Yes, you can, you and the denied stone

He's the stone that shall never be moved
He's the Rock of All Ages
He's the stone that went rolling down through Babylon
Tearing down the kingdom of the world
Rolled into hell, and loosed the saints from satan's cages
He's the stone they crucified
But He rose and said, "behold, I'm still alive"

He's the mountain that's just laying in Zion
A Chief, a Precious Cornerstone
He's the stone that's low enough
To hear His people crying
And we're never ever left alone

He'll give life when life is gone
For I heard them say, "we all love that stone"
So don't you ever think you can't stand alone
Yes, you can, you and the denied stone

(Vamp:)
I can stand, I can make it;
(no matter what friends may say)
(you can go on anyway)

I can stand, I can make it;
(you see, I've been down)
(but I'm coming up and I'm coming up)

Yes, I can stand, I can make it;
(oh yes, I can, me and the denied stone)

I can stand, I can make it;
(oh yes, you can, you and the denied stone)

(Stand therefore, stand anyhow)
(you and the denied stone)
