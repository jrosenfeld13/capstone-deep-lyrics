[Verse 1]
Seize upon that moment long ago
One breath away and there you will be
So young and carefree
Again you will see
That place in time...so gold

[Verse 2]
Still away into that way back when
You thought that all would last forever
But like the weather
Nothing can ever...and be in time
Stay gold

[Verse 3]
But can it be
When we can see
So vividly
A memory
And yes you say
So must the day
Too, fade away
And leave a ray of sun
So gold

[Verse 4]
Life is but a twinkling of an eye
Yet filled with sorrow and compassion
Though not imagined
All things that happen
Will age too old
Though gold
