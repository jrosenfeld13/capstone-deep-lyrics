Forever lost in 90 days
From early March till late in May
Then I pulled out in a day
To catch my breath some place far away
All to say farewell for now
No one brings you down like I
All to say farewell for now
No one brings you down like I
Tomorrow morning set me free
For many nights youll never sleep
When Im far from reaching out of sight
Enough to get me on my high tonight
All to say farewell for now
No one brings you down like I
All to say farewell for now
No one brings you down like I
Forever lost in 90 days
From early March till late in May
Farewell for now, farewell for now, farewell
All to say no one brings you down like I
All to say farewell for now
No one brings you down like I do
