Be my one, would you take my son
Would you tell someone
Whether we had fun
With your heroes, double zeroes
Going in circles around your fear
Then I'm never ever fallin' again
Would you take my grace
Look into my face
With your limp handshake
And your smile that's fake
Would you back my fight
Say your down for life
Well it's easy to say
When your words don't mean nothing

Maker makes me long for a better way
You'll fear my strength if I'm backed into a cage
Because I...
I Defy
I Defy
I Defy
I Defy

See my fate, underestimate
I intoxicate while you emulate
With the losers and the users
Suckin' up to the abusers
And I'm never ever fallin' again
For the tricks you play
Or the fronts you claim
And you just can't fake
The respect I've made
You're a parasite
You conform on site
You're the link in the chain
That was weak and always will be!

Maker makes me long for a better way
You'll fear my strength if I'm backed into a cage
Because I...
I Defy
I Defy
I Defy
I Defy

So burn it apart, son

I give it away
I say, why did you end the pain?
I give it away
I say, why did you end the pain?
I give it away
I say, why did you end the pain?
I give it away
I say, why did you end the pain?

I can't take this
I can't fake this
I will break this
I will break this

'cos
I Defy
I Defy
I Defy
I Defy
