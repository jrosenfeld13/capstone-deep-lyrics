Tell me lies, dazzle me with stories
Tell me that our greatest glory's yet to come
Tell me lies, tell me when the stars explode
They shine a mother lode of answers out across the sky
'Cause I just can't take it
This feeling we won't make it out alive
Tell me lies

Tell me lies, whisper in my ear
Tell me that our greatest fear is not come true
Tell me lies, tell me when I hear the er(?)
With sirens in the night, it is not a bloody fight
It's sweethearts in disguise, setting off alarms
Turned on by surprise
Tell me 'cause I just can't take it
This feeling we won't make it out alive
Tell me lies

Tell me 'cause I just can't take it
This feeling we won't (make it)
