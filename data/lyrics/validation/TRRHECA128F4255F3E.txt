All in the discotech
All in together now
Hip pip pip, No matter what the weather now
Rich in your bag and pull another record out
Gather out out steppers we are out stepping now

Ohhhh, hot as a furnace
Got everybody jumping across the Earth's surface
So please, turn it up
It's about a thousand degrees and I'm burning up
I wanna piece of what you're cooking so serve it up
You think that you've heard it all
You haven't heard enough. I wanna
Keep rocking till the beat starts thumping
When the b-line's jumping and my feet start stomping
Ohhh I'm feeling oh so marvelous
And the people gather out in the club with as
Theres something that people should know now

We play the music for the people all around
Getting hot of my feet on the ground
We keep it moving and it aint no stopping now
So my DJ just turn it right round

Life without music is unbearable
So terrible, unfeasible
Unbelievable and incomprehendible
Cannot even imagine the life without festivals
House parties home lands to bestival glastenberrie
To nottinghill carnival
We commit tonight the party
We follow you now
Lets get down

We got it if you want it, people never give it up
Dance until your feet get hot
We got it if you want it, people never give it up
Dance until the music stops
We got it if you want it, people never give it up
Dance until your feet get sore
We got it if you want it, people never give it up
DJ please give them one more

We play the music for the people all around
Getting hot of my feet on the ground
We keep it moving and it aint no stopping now
So my DJ just turn it right round

Stand up, hands up, no sit down
Gather around everybody and get down
Slim, fat, white, black, all people
It no matter where are you from, all equal
All colors, all creed and gender
Races and faces presenter
To the center of floor surrender
To the sound of the music and explenda
I yell my party animal Hell yes
To let you know if you dont already notice
Make intentionally everybody notice
cause you where listerning to random acts of kindness
Its summing for the world to enjoy
Every god damn man every girl and boy
Swing it over here
And give it to me now

We play the music for the people all around
Getting hot of my feet on the ground
We keep it moving and it aint no stopping now
So my DJ just turn it right round
We play the music for the people all around
Getting hot of my feet on the ground
We keep it moving and it aint no stopping now
So my DJ just turn it right round
