When I wake up in the morning
The first thing that I do
Is when I see your smiling face
I give the world a loving brace
Feeling so glad that I found you
I need you every moment
I need you by my side
My ultimate desire is your tender kiss
I'll always miss
So kissing is all we should do
No anyone could love you better
Much better than I do
No anyone could you more
The one that I adore

Now that we found love
All I wanna do
Is always making love to you
Cause now that we found love
In each and every night
I wish to hold you thight
Just making love

When I lay down in the evening
To have sweetest dreams of you
I only need to close my eyes
When suddenly I realise
That all of my dreams have come true
In each and every moment
I need you by my side
My ultimate desire is your tender kiss
I'll always miss
So kissing is all we should do

No anyone could love you better
Much better than I do
No anyone could you more
The one that I adore

Now that we found love
All I wanna do
Is always making love to you
Cause now that we found love
In each and every night
I wish to hold you thight
Just making love

If we only have one life to live
To live life in love
I'll spend it with you
And we just got one love to give
To give all my love
I'll give it to you

Now that we found love
All I wanna do
Is always making love to you
Cause now that we found love
In each and every night
I wish to hold you thight
Just making love

Now that we found love
All I wanna do
Is always making love to you
Cause now that we found love
Moved by desire
Love burns like fire
No feelings yeah higher than love
