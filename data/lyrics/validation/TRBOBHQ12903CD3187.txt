I don't mind
My heart can wait
Its got nowhere to run

Every time you hesitate
Makes me think there's another one
Oh its getting hard to notice
That I pray its still there

There's no hope in waiting
For I love threadbare

Oh I need somebody to calm me down
Before my body can rest
Every time I come back
This town puts my will to the test
Never thought that I'd back down
Settle for anything less
Somebody to calm me down

I can't tell my friends to go
Well they've there to long
If I die before I'm old
I'd love to prove 'em wrong

Oh I need somebody to calm me down
Before my body can rest
Every time I come back
This town puts my will to the test
Never thought that I'd back down
Settle for anything less
Somebody to calm me down
