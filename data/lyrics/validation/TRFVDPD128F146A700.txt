When I walk through the earth
I get stuck in the middle
I can't see your love
I don't know your love

When I walk through the earth
I get stuck in the middle
I can't see your love
I don't know your love

Why won't you take me away?
Take me a day
Keep on rising higher

Why won't you take me away?
Take me a day
Keep on rising higher

Chorus x 8
Hey, knock me
Picking on your own reality

When I walk through the earth
I get stuck in the middle
I can't see your love
I don't know your love

When I walk through the earth
I get stuck in the middle
I can't see your love
I don't know your love

Why won't you take me away?
Take me a day
Keep on rising higher

Why won't you take me away?
Take me a day
Keep on rising higher

Chorus x 8
Hey, knock me
Picking on your own reality

Instrumental break

Chorus to fade
Hey, knock me
Picking on your own reality
