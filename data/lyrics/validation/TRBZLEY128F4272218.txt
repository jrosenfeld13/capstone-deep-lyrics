Open your heart and let the sunshine in
Open your heart, let the sunshine in

Sun is shining on my world
Sun is in my shoes
While I'm passin' through this life
This job is spent with you
Wrap my dreams in silver paper
Gonna give them all to you
Use them on some rainy morning
And they'll tell you what to do

Open your heart and let the sunshine in
Open your heart, let the sunshine in
Open your heart and let the sunshine in
Open up your heart and let the sunshine in

Life is what you're reaching through
When your path I spied
Wake up in the rainy morning
You'll be satisfied
Gonna wrap up my dreams in silver paper
Give it all to you
Use it on some rainy morning
It'll tell you what to do

Open your heart and let the sunshine in
Open your heart, let the sunshine in
Open your heart and let the sunshine in
Open your heart, let the sunshine in
