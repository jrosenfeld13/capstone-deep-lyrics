When death shall close these eyelids
And this heart shall cease to beat
And they lay me down to rest
In some flowery bound retreat
Will you miss me?
(Miss me when I'm gone)
Will you miss me?
(Miss me when I'm gone)
Will you miss me?
(Miss me when I'm gone)
Will you miss me when I'm gone?
Perhaps you'll plant a flower
On my poor unworthy grave
Come and sit along beside me
When the roses nod and wave
Will you miss me?
(Miss me when I'm gone)
Will you miss me?
(Miss me when I'm gone)
Will you miss me?
(Miss me when I'm gone)
Will you miss me when I'm gone?
One sweet thought my soul shall cherish
When this fleeting life has flown
This sweet thought will cheer when dying
Will you miss me when I'm gone?
When these lips shall never more
Press a kiss upon thy brow
But lie cold and still in death
Will you love me then as now?
Will you miss me?
(Miss me when I'm gone)
Will you miss me?
(Miss me when I'm gone)
Will you miss me?
(Miss me when I'm gone)
Will you miss me when I'm gone?
