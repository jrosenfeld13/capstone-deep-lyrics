Now I've realized what you told were lies
You couldn't ever seem to look me in the eyes
There's no point to fight, you're cut from my life
Never even gave a chance to compromise
I'm digging a grave for all of the memories
And times we used to share
I've laid them to rest, don't make apologies
You've made this a nightmare
You can't pull the plug on these words I write
We'll never forget what you did to us that night
You can't run and hide, cause you've been exposed
For the liar and the cheat we've come to know
I'm digging a grave for all of the memories
And times we used to share
I've laid them to rest, don't make apologies
You've made this a nightmare
You've pushed this too far
There's blood on the floor
Dragging pieces of our friendship out the door
I guess I can say, I'm guilty as charged
For being dumb enough to trust you from the start
I'm digging a grave for all of the memories
And times we used to share
I've laid them to rest, don't make apologies
You've made this a nightmare
