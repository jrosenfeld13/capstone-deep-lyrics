Where perfect dreams meet the perfect life
My days are the richness of your praise
I can't imagine what it feels like
To fully know all that You say

CHORUS:
And everything, and everything
And everything is holy, holy, holy

All that I want to say has been said before
So I'm glad You know just what I mean
Your groans express the way I feel right now
Cause above all else I want to be

CHORUS:
Where everything, and everything
And everything is holy, holy, holy
Where everything, and everything
And everything is holy, holy, holy

BRIDGE:
I would not have to fear anymore
All I'd be capable of would be holy, holy, holy, holy
And I would, I would not shame Your name anymore
I want to be, I want to be

CHORUS(2x)
