Thundering down from the mountain you ride
Clutching a sword made of steel
The ones you call friends they all left you for dead Alone on the
Battlefield many were at your command Renegade
Souls on your command Holding each life in your hand
Living for all and for one
Shining into the night you
Are riding Through the darkness and light you are
Flying with the wind in your hair The flight of the
Warrior
Drunk with revenge from winch on one can
Hide Into their midst you will run A face from the
Grave is the last thing they'll see And die with your
Name on their tongue many were at your command
Renegade souls on the run Holding each life in your
Hand Living for all and for one
Shining into the night
You are riding Through the darkness and light you are
Flying with the wind in your hair The flight of the
Warrior
Thundering down from the mountain you ride
Clutching a sword made of steel The ones you call
Friends they all left you for dead Alone on the
Battlefield Many were at your command Renegade
Souls on your command Holding each life in your hand
Living for all and for one Shining into the night you
Are riding Through the darkness and light you are
Flying with the wind in your hair The flight of the
Warrior
