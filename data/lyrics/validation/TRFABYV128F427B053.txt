I know I can trust myself cause I believe in what I say
I believe in my friends, because their with me everyday
Believe that we can overcome because the scene is strong today
Believe I live this life, because I know HARDCORE'S THE WAY
Believe we are right
Believe we are strong
Believe in yourself
BELIEVE - HARDCORE
I know things look bleak sometimes I wish it wasn't that way
We know we're in the right WE STAND PROUD TODAY
