My life ain't been so easy
I've been through my share of pain
I've had some ups and downs and
There's been some crazy days

In the midst of a storm I learned that
I had to wait it out
I found if I be patient
The noise would quiet down

Smilin' through all my troubles
It just might be too much
Sometimes your fall is just
A set up for your comin' up

Everything, everything's gonna be alright
(In the midst of all your troubles, you don't have to worry)
And I know everything, everything's gonna be alright
(Don't you worry, don't you worry)
It's gonna be alright

I've wrapped in a toothpick home
I swear I've done it all
Lived check to check, I've been the
Highlight of my girlfriends gossip

I've warmed water on the stove
Used the oven to warm my home
But I don't regret it, it made me better
I appreciate it all

In the midst of a storm I learned that
I had to wait it out
I found if I be patient
The noise would quiet down

Smilin' through all my troubles
It just might be too much
Sometimes your fall is just
A set up for your comin' up

Everything, everything's gonna be alright
(Ooh, your laughs and cries is gonna be alright)
And I know everything, everything's gonna be alright
(Tell your worries, tell your pain goodbye)
It's gonna be alright

There's a reason for everything
Any promised words are for the good
Find the goodness in all the things
Good or bad and it's understood

You can lose love just to find it
You can find joy when you're cryin'
And I know everything's gonna be alright

Everything, everything's gonna be alright
(I know, you gotta know, we got to know that it's gonna be alright)
And I know everything, everything's gonna be alright
(Hold on, hold on, hold on now, now, hold on now, yeah)
It's gonna be alright

Everything, everything's gonna be alright
(Your grandmama prayed for you, your mamas did the same thing too)
And I know everything, everything's gonna be alright
(We've been layin' door from the night but joy, joy comes in the morning)
It's gonna be alright
