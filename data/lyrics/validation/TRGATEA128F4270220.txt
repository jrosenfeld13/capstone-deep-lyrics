Sing me a rainbow, shine me a dime
Drop in and see me, any old time, honey
And if you love me, tell me you do
Reason I'm asking is 'cause I love you, honey
Oh don't you know that I love you

When I was living, I felt so ashamed
Now I've been giving and feeling less pain
Sing me a rainbow, shine me a dime
Drop in and see me, any old time
And if you love me, tell me you do
Reason I'm asking is 'cause I love you, honey
Oh don't you know that I love you

Oh yes you are magic, I know that you are
'Cause I saw you riding last night on a star, honey
Sing me a rainbow, shine me a dime
Drop in and see me, any old time
And if you love me, tell me you do
Reason I'm asking is 'cause I love you, honey
Oh don't you know that I love you
Oh honey, don't you know that I love you
