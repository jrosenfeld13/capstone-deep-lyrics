Plug me in, I'm alive tonight, out on the streets again
Turn me on, I'm too hot to stop, something you'll never forget
Take my fist, break down walls, I'm on top tonight, no, no
You better turn me loose
You better set me free
Cause I'm hot, young and running free
A little bit better than I use to be
Cause I'm alive , live wire
Cause I'm alive, I'm a live wire
Cause I'm alive, live wire
Cause I'm alive, I'm a live wire
I'm gonna break her face or take down her legs, get my ways at will
Go for the throat, never let loose, goin' in for the kill
Take my fist, break down walls, I'm on top tonight, no, no
You better turn me loose
You better set me free
Cause I'm hot, young, running free
A little bit better than I use to be
Cause I'm alive, live wire
Cause I'm alive, I'm a live wire
Cause I'm alive, live wire
Cause I'm alive, I'm a live wire
Come on baby, gotta play with me, well I'm your live wire
You better lock your doors, I'm on the prowl tonight, well be mine tonight
Cause I'm alive, live wire
Cause I'm alive, I'm a live wire
Cause I'm alive, live wire
Cause I'm alive, I'm a live wire
Come on be my baby, come on tonight
Come on love me baby, come on tonight
I'll give you everything, you want inside
Plug me in, plug me in, plus me in cause I want you
