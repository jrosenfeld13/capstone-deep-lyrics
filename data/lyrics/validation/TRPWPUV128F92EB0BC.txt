[Verse 1]
Speeches won't be made today, clocks will carry on
Flowers won't be left in parks, work will still be done
People won't be dressed in black, babies will be born
No flags will fly, the sun will rise but we will know that you are gone

[Chorus]
You who loved to love
And believed we can never give enough

[Verse 2]
It wakes me every single night thinking through the day
Did you stop at any time, have doubts at any stage?
Or were you calm or were you numb, or happy just to get it done?
I've lived my life without regret until today

[Chorus]
And you who loved to love
And believed we can never give enough

[Verse 3]
I didn't get to say goodbye the day before the day
Was trying to get to work on time that's why I turned away
And missed the most important thing you ever tried to say
I've lived my life without regret until today

[Chorus]
And you who love to love
And believed we can never give enough
And you who hoped that underneath
We all felt the same
That was until the day before the day, the day before the day
The day before the day, oh the day before the day
The day before the day, oh the day before the day
Oh the day before the day, oh the day before the day
