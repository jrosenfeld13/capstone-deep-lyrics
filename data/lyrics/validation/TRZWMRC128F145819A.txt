Bless me, Father, I have sinned
I've broken hearts, got drunk on gin
And still I lust for sweet young things

On the day that I was born
Bells rang out in Babylon
Still I can't tell right from wrong
No matter what the Good Book says

Now I can see the sun is shining
But I can feel the rain
Falling down to wash my tears away
Wash my tears away

Holy Mother, save your tears
You've cried for me a thousand years
But I was blind to all your fears
Now I can't stop the tears from falling down

Come the dawn of judgement day
I'll get down on my knees and pray
St. Peter don't you, don't you send me away

Now I can see the sun is shining
But I can feel the rain
Falling down to wash my tears away

Bless me, Father, I have sinned
I've broken hearts, got drunk on gin
And still I lust for everything
Every little thing

Come the dawn of judgement day
I'll get down on my knees and pray
The Good Lord don't send me away
I'll never ever go

Now I can see the sun is shining
But I can feel the rain
Falling down to wash my tears away

Wash my tears away
I'll get down on my knees
Don't send me away
Don't you send me away, no, no, no
