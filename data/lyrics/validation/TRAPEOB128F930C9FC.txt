If and when you do decide
To leave this rotting bar behind
Not an inch left to explore
Of this dingy bathroom floor
Wake up
Time to sober up and catch the ride that leaves for south end
Wake up, baby!
She can't see the state you're in, let's keep it down a little
Wake up
Time to sober up and catch the ride that leaves for south end
Wake up, girl!
Devour the sympathetic moon above
And climb into the light
Jim and Ray are done for the night
If and when you do decide
To leave this rotting bar behind
Not an inch left to explore
Of this dingy bathroom floor
