The Politician says
There's a new way coming to town
But I ain't seen nothing
Nothing to stop this frown
'cause it's guns to the left
Dollars to the right
Down the barrel of an armalite

I-cry-they-lie
Blood-red-all-dead
Oh oh that's the way
Pushin' and a-shovin'
In the Id Parade

Got a finger in the Dope pie
And a bomb to blow you sky high
A tricky old
Sticky old
Fickle old war
Dust that leaves a half lie
'cause it's guns to the left
Dollars to the right
Down the barrel of an armalite

I-cry-they-lie
Blood-red-all-dead
Oh oh that's the way
Pushin' and a-shovin'
In the Id Parade

I-cry-they-lie
Blood-red-all-dead
Oh oh that's the way
Pushin' and a-shovin'
In the Id Parade
