Slip from reality
Physical senses fade
Thought becomes reality
Experience is mind made
Dreaming perpetually
Existing infinitely
A state of being
A continuation
Assimilation
Mental comprehension
Living infinitely
Dying perpetually
Feeling everything
Touching nothing
Becoming everything
Become nothing
