T-t-truck t-t-trucker man
Going to a foreign land
Roads converging, paths emerging

T-t-truck t-t-trucker man
Moving down the motorway
Service stations, destinations

T-t-truck t-t-trucker man
Going through a foreign land
Girl hitchhikers, motorbikers

Train train, choo-choo-choo-choo train
Coming through the rushing rain
Lights are red, ???

Train train, choo-choo-choo-choo train
T-t-train, train on track
Level crossing, double crossing

Train train, choo-choo-choo train
Coming through the rushing rain
And you'll probably never stop me

Choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo tractor man
Driving up the agriculture land
Open spaces, nowhere places

Choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo tractor man
Jamming up the country roads
I can't wait to overtake

T-t-tractor mr farmer man
T-t-tractor mr farmer work
Roll in the hay and do it again

When I'm cruising along at a leisurly pace
Sometimes find I'm not too out of place
Now I've been up and I've been down
And I've seen the world absurd and round
Seems quite odd most of what goes on
But here I am so I must be wrong
Gravity's got a hold on me
