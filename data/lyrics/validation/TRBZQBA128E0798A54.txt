You fall hard, you fall deep
Even when you're awake, you look half asleep
Do you even know what you did last summer?
Wandering around that dumb and blind
With the girls all hanging around you

Is that a no or yes?
We'll have to guess
Mysterious eyes let you see what you want
Half the time you didn't know any better, but half the time you did
Hanging around like tomorrow doesn't apply to you

Lazy dreamer
You never want to rise
Seven in between us you're almost paralyzed
Makes no difference to you the sun shining in your eyes
Waiting for you they don't even realize
