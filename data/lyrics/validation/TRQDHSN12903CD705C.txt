Nobody cares about me
I ain't even got a friend
Baby's gone and left me
When will my troubles end?
Black night is falling
Oh how I hate to be alone
I keep crying for my baby
But now another day is gone
I've got no one to talk with
To tell my troubles to
Don't even know I'm living
Since I lost you
Black night is falling
Oh how I hate to be alone
I keep crying for my baby
But now another day is gone
[musical interlude]
My mother has the trouble
My father has it too
Brother's in Korea
And I don't know just what to do
Black night, black night is falling
Oh how I hate to be alone
I keep crying for my baby
But now another day is gone
