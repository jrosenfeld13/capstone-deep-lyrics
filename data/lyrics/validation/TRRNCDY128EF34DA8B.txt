All I said:
"I'm not easily led
But I will praise you
I will praise you."

If I could stand beside myself
Well, I could walk with someone else;
Like you
Like you

If you could see through my eyes
You'd see why I stand paralyzed
By you

All I said:
(by you)
"I'm not easily led
And I will praise you."
