Holding on to a dream. I sacrifice. Holding ont to this dream that I had without a solid plan. And nothing's falling in my lap. I'm making sacrifices. I never let it go. With everything in front of me. An overwhelming sight. Making sacrifices. I never let it go. Won't let it go

Don't shut your eyes. Open look where you are. You're in control. You're in control of the situation. Don't make the same mistakes. This is mine and I won't slow down. It's mine and I won't slow down

I'll make a way. Make way. Still it seems miles away. I'm crawling the whole way it seems
