Techno man - turn insane
We are going wrong!
Poisoned sky - make Manito cry
Where are the angels tonight?
Where is that light?
We're going wrong - going wrong
We're going wrong...
***
Techno mind - turning blind
We are going wrong!
Children die - make Manito cry
Where are the flowers of heaven tonight?
Where is that light?
We're sailing home - sailing home
We're sailing home...
***
Please show us the way, Lord!
Please show us the way to heaven
'Cos we're on the road to hell...
Please show us the highway home
Please show us the road to heaven
'Cos we're on the road to hell...
***
Are we heading home or are we way gone?
Hades bound or are we living on?
Are we heading home or are we way gone?
Chaos bound or are we living on?
When the sun goes down
To die alone is certain now
When the lights go down
Silence cries for the clown
***
When the sunlight cries
When the last purple warrior dies
When we learn to live and to die...
When the last man stands
When the midnight hour calls
Then we shall sail away
To the land of dawn
Sailing to the sun of glory
(The rainbows show the way)
Avalon waiting at the end of a story...
***
Feel the dark shroud falling
From the wings of night itself...
See a dark cloud slowly palling
As the sign of the grail tolls the bells...
Hear the night wind calling
From the edge of life itself
Chasing shadows of tommorow
With the light of the lantern of time
***
When the lion wind is roaring
We shall find the land of the dawn
When the lion wings are soaring
We will ride into the dawn
With the summer wind -
On the summer's wings...
When the lion brings the thunder
We shall find the land of the dawn
When the lion calls from yonder
We will fly towards the dawn
With the summer wind -
On the summer's wings...
***
Hear the night wind calling
From the edge of life itself...
