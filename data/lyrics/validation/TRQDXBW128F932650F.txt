[Verse 1: Julz Sale]
Can I have a taste of your ice cream
Can I lick the crumbs from your table
Can I interfere in your crisis

[Chorus: Julz Sale]
No, mind your own business
No, mind your own business

[Verse 2: Julz Sale]
Can I have a taste of your ice cream
Can I lick the crumbs from your table
Can I interfere in your crisis

[Chorus: Julz Sale]
No, mind your own business
No, mind your own business

[Verse 3: Julz Sale]
Can you hear those people behind me
Looking at your feelings inside me
Listen to the distance between us
Why dont you mind your own business
Why dont you mind your own business

[Verse 4: Julz Sale]
Can you hear those people behind me
Looking at your feelings inside me
Listen to the distance between us
Why dont you mind your own business
Why dont you mind your own business

[Verse 5: Julz Sale]
Can I have a taste of your ice cream
Can I lick the crumbs from your table
Can I interfere in your crisis

[Chorus: Julz Sale]
No, mind your own business
No, mind your own business

[Verse 6: Julz Sale]
Can you hear those people behind me
Looking at your feelings inside me
Listen to the distance between us
Why dont you mind your own business
Why dont you mind your own business

[Outro]
Mind your own business!
