Let it rain, let it rain
Oh won't you let it rain
Let the storm rage
Let the water run higher
Let it rain, let it rain
Oh won't you let it rain
Baptized in a river of fireThe storm's here
I'm so high
Thunder's calling me, I'm going outside
The sky cracks
The wind stings
I want to feel you strike me down with lightning

Let it rain, let it rain
Oh won't you let it rain
Let the storm rage
Let the water run higher
Let it rain, let it rain
Oh won't you let it rain
Baptized in a river of fire
Let the storm rage
Let the water run higher
Baptize me in a river of fire

I cry out
For glory
I wanna drown in your wrath and fury
I feel your need
I taste your pain
Show me what you got
Bring on the hurricane

Let it rain, let it rain
Oh won't you let it rain
Let the storm rage
Let the water run higher
Let it rain, let it rain
Oh won't you let it rain
Baptized in a river of fire
Let the storm rage
Let the water run higher
Baptize me in a river of fire


Let it rain, let it rain
Oh won't you let it rain
Let the storm rage
Let the water run higher
Let it rain, let it rain
Oh won't you let it rain
Baptized in a river of fire
Let the storm rage
Let the water run higher
Baptize me in a river of fire

Let the storm rage
Let the water run higher
Baptize me in a river of fire
Let the storm rage
Let the water run higher
Baptize me in a river of fire, baptize me in a river of fire
