When love's in vain, love can be so strange
There ain't nothing I can take to kill this pain
Set me free
Why don't you, Rosa Lee?

She is a dream, but she's so hard to please
She moves around like an Egyptian queen
Set me free
Why don't you, Rosa Lee?

I'm so afraid of losing you
But there's only so much that a man can do
For Rosa Lee
Why don't you set me free?

When I hit the road the time goes slow
Thinking about the places I used to go
With Rosa Lee
Why won't you set me free?

They're trying to close the Tu y Yo
The Latin Playboy and the Sky Room shows
Oh! Rosa Lee
Why don't they let them be?

I can't get used to losing you
But there's only so much that a man can do
For Rosa Lee
Why don't you set me free?

When love's in vain, love can be so strange
But I never thought I'd wear a ball and chain
Set me free
Why don't you, Rosa Lee?
