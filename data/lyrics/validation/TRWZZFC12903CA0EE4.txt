The Heart Is A Rebel
Nite after nite I open my eyes
Read between the silver lines, the end
The more I want you
The closer I come
Sting me
Back into your arms
Ooh
You light my fire and you light my wish
I never wanted anything but this, the end
It's a pitch black void when I turn my tricks
My heart catch fire and my nine turn six
It's an answer to what I already knew
The heart is a rebel
Make me see
I'm waiting for the wild
The heart is a rebel
Stay with me
I'm waiting for the wild
Nite after nite I open my eyes
Read between the silver lines, the end
Baby let's pretend it won't be always so hard
Somewhere along the end we'll be back at the start
It will be easier
It will be easier
The heart is a rebel
Make me see
I'm waiting for the wild
The heart is a rebel
Stay with me
I'm waiting for the wild
