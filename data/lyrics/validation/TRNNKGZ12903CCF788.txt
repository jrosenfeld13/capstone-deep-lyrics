I've been away, I've been working
But now I'm back I need to know if you're still there
And I need to know if you still care
Of course you do, of course you do
You were made for me, and I was made for you

Some things change, but the majority stands still
And I need to know if you want to
And I need to know if you will
Of course you do, of course you do
But I was made for this place, and I was made for you

I don't know if you would welcome me back with
Open arms through the door
I don't expect anything but please know that I love you for sure
Please be sure

I miss your eyelashes and the streets where I grew tall
I miss getting piss wet through
Getting to yours and getting warm
I miss stopping over and borrowing someone else's clothes
It's so nice to be home, you'd never have known that
I'd even been away

I miss the city I love but I've been having an affair
With L.A and New York, Dundee
And Doncaster if I may dare
Of course I do, of course I do
But I was meant for this place, and I was meant for you

I miss the city I love but I've been having an affair
With L.A and New York, Dundee and Doncaster if you
Should care. Of course you do, of course you do

But I was made for this place and I was made for you
My heart is here, here to stay
My heart is here, here to stay
My heart is here, here to stay
My heart is here, here to stay
My heart is here, here to stay
My heart is here, here to stay
My heart is here, here to stay
My heart is here, here to stay
My heart is here, here to stay
My heart is here, here to stay
My heart is here, here to stay
