They want to believe
Everything you say
You'll blow away
Their worries today

They want to believe
Your education
Want to taste the
Local animation

Receive the facts
Get in lane
Despite the lack
You will obtain

Receive the seed
Follow the train
Support the spread
Then you'll obtain

You tell the trees
The thoughts in your head
A thorn in your flesh
Waiting for the crash

You tell the trees
That you're a tool
Laconic they listen
You act the fool
