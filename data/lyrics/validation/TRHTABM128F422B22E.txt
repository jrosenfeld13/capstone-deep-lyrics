Come as your noise
Your little voice
It's the only way to relax
So you forgot what you sound like
That's no way to relax

Turn the sound down to hear yourself
It's the only way to relax
Come as your noise
Your little voice

I smell fear cooking somewhere 'round here x2

Come on, scout, relax
Nothings yours anyway x2

Come as your noise
Your little voice
Its the only way to relax

As i go my way, you
(-) 'till safety
My special friend
You're all around
All the better to see you live

Come as your noise
Your little voice
Oh it's the only way to relax
