Lullaby playing in my head
Volume's loud enough to wake the dead
Terrified that I might really be
What everyone else thinks of me
And I happened all the time
I left it all behind
When I was young I always needed help
I never had the nerve to be myself
Recognize that I will never care
Who am I to way just what is fair
Compromise my position is clear
But I never thought it'd get me here
