Silence, silence all sides
Raw with indecision
Without the mind to congregate
In fault the line extends
To further burden divided friends
Silence all sides
Why bother to defy when we still can't unite
So put your fist down until sanity can be contained
We burn out before we fade away
Losing time and not changing anything
Burn out we isolate
Rather stand alone than divided
Stuck on lines deplete
Chant slogans timed one step off beat
Full loss of common sense
When passion becomes status end
Silence, silence all sides
Why bother to defy when we still can't unite
So put your fist down until sanity can be contained
What's been said has spread like fire to all
It takes no strength to pass blame
We burn out before we fade away
Losing time and not changing anything
Burn out we isolate
Rather stand alone than divided
