On my heart
The nights are drawing in
Above, the stars are spiralling
And Heaven, Earth are roaming in a spin
Memories of light and laughter
Hope and peace from far here after
Oh in heaven, wings of angels from a dream

On my heart
The nights are drawing in
Above, the stars are spiralling
And Heaven, Earth are roaming in a spin
