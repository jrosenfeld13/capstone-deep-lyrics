[Verse]
Well, when the sun rose this morning
I didn't have my baby by my side
Oh, when the sun rose this morning
I didn't have my baby by my side
Well [?] know where she was
Well, she's out with another guy
Well, don't the sun look lonesome?
Shading down behind the trees
Well, don't the sun looks so lonesome
Shading down behind the trees
Well, don't your house look so lonesome?
When your baby packed up to leave
Well, alright
Well, blow wind, blow wind
Blow my baby back to me
Oh, blow wind, blow wind
Blow my baby back to me
Well, you know if I don't soon find her
My heart's going to be in misery
Well, alright, alright
Oh, goodbye, baby
I don't have no more to say
Oh, goodbye, baby
I don't have no more to say
Well you know I know you don't love me
Go ahead and have your way
