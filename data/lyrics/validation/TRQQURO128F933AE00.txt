I know that things are far from perfect please don't walk away give me a minute listen to what i have to say i always put you number 1 in my life never thought we'd say good-bye
I miss my boo my fellas say I'm strong and it's true without your love i wouldn't know what to do thought it would always be me and you deep in my heart i know i hurt you being apart but there's no such thing as perfect i made mistakes but our relationship didn't have to break
I'm so in love that L-O-V-E works to your voice it takes me to the stars up above no one would ever love me like you do I'm so in love your every word is deep inside me your loving makes me come back to you girl i'd give everything up just for you..
You are my nights you are my days you are my shining star you are my angel that was sent from up above cause it's all about you and your future with me girl it's simple to see that this was destined to be
When you're in my arms theres nothing that could tear us apart i knew that there was love from the start i felt it from the beat in my heart love ain't a game i wanna bless you with my last name then making the promise to stay forever                     I'm so in love that L-O-V-E works to your voice it takes me to the stars up above no one would ever love me like you do I'm so in love your every word is deep inside me your loving makes me come back to you girl i'd give everything up just for you..
