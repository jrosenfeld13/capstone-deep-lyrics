It was late in November
When we first met
That's the time I remember so well

We were two passing strangers
Who would know what we know now
Just two hearts reaching out for each other

The sun was shining
And my heart was falling in love

We got so much love
Now is the right time
We got so much love
You're always on my mind

We got so much love
Feels so good you're mine
We got so much love
Feels so good you're mine

When I'm with you it's the right time
I feel so good you're mine
There's no words to express how I feel

Put some logs in the fire
When you hold me in your arms
And feel that love burning with desire

The snow was falling
Outside my window pane
It still had me falling in love

We got so much love
No words could express the way I feel
We got so much love
Now I know, I know that this love's for real

We got so much love
Rain or shine you'll be mine
We got so much love
I'll be there to comfort you my baby, oh

We got so much love
Come and hold me
Hold me close
I need you the most

We got so much love
Come and show me that you love me
That you're always thinking of me

We got so much love
I'll show you, I'll guard you
I'll always be beside you now

We just got to take our time
'Cause I'll always be beside you
You'll always be in my mind
