[Verse 1]
I think I'll be a good ghost when it's time for me
To haunt all the people I knew when I was alive
I wear designer sheets as my only ghost clothes
And get good scissors to cut the eye-holes

[Chorus]
And hey, it'll be nice
To be seen through for a while
And hey, it'll be cool
To be feather-light for a while

[Verse 2]
I think I'll be a good ghost when it's time for me
To haunt all the people I knew when I was alive
But i wonder if the girl ghosts will know that I am there
Or if ghosts in general don't really care

[Chorus]
And hey, it'll be nice
To be seen through for a while
And hey, it'll be cool
To be feather-light for a while
And hey, it'll be nice
To be seen through for a while
And hey, it'll be cool
To be feather light for a while
