She kisses me like music
I dont pretend I don't like it
Her lips are soft and Swedish
She leaves me gasping for more

Summer bleeds into my skin and
Paints me the colour golden

And I'm done, I'm left alone exausted
Pick myself up off the road

And I won't come down to earth
It's along way down to...

And I dont come to earth
It's a long way down, It's a long way down
