How could I've known

Just to fall in love could happen so easy

Now my love has grown

It's been a long time now

Since I loved a lady like you

Sweet misery is the flaxen hair that's driving me crazy

Can you see through me?

It's been a long time now

Since I loved a lady like you

Big Pink's on the stereo set

Pickin' for fun

And I figured you hard to get

But here we are making love as the sun comes up

Ooooh, it's been a long time now

Since I loved a lady like you

Big Pink's on the stereo set

Pickin' for fun

And I figured you hard to get

But here we are making love as the sun comes up

Buy you a ring and a mare to ride

Should you go to the country

I'll give everything

'Cause it's been a long time now

Since I loved a lady like you

Such a long time

Since I've loved a lady like you

Long time
