[Verse 1]
I want to be alone for a while
I want earth to breathe to me
I want the waves to grow loud
I want the sun to bleed down
To bleed down

[Pre-Chorus]
See the waves go down
See the moon alone
I raise my head and whisper

[Chorus]
Rise and shine (rise and shine)
Rise and shine, my sister
Rise and shine (rise and shine)
Rise and shine, my sister
Rise and shine (rise and shine)
Rise and shine, my sister
Rise and shine (rise and shine)
Rise and shine

[Verse 2]
I want to see the wounded moon
I want the sea to break through
I want it all to be gone tomorrow
So I've come to say goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]
To say goodbye
See the waves go down
See the moon alone
I raise my head and whisper

[Chorus]
Rise and shine (rise and shine)
Rise and shine, my sister
Rise and shine (rise and shine)
Rise and shine, my sister
Rise and shine (rise and shine)
Rise and shine, my sister
Rise and shine (rise and shine)
Rise and shine

[Outro]
Rise and shine
Rise and shine
Rise and shine
