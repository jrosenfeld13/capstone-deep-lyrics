She said its not about you
It's not about you, it's me
She said it's not about you
It's not about you, it's me

And sometimes its good
Sometimes its bad
But living with you, well it's driving me mad
And sometimes its good
Sometimes its bad
But living with you is, well it's becoming a drag

She's a beautiful smile, she's a gleam in your eye
Dresses like a princess, playing games in your mind
Falling out of her top, runs a hand through her hair
Playing so hard to get, cause she knows that you care

I don't know how to love you more, how to love you more
How to love you more, my friend
I don't know how to love you more, how to love you more
How to love you more, my

I guess we got, I guess we got
I guess we got nothing to say
I guess we got, I guess we got
I guess we got

It's not about you (don't you go)
I guess we got
It's not about you (don't you go)
I guess we got

And sometimes its good
Sometimes its bad
But living with you, well it's driving me mad
And sometimes its good
Sometimes its bad
But living with you is, well it's making me sad

So is this how it ends? Well nobody knows
She'll be gone for a year and we'll see how it goes
Moving out of your flat, slipping right through your hands
She's a difficult girl and your a sillier man

I don't know how to love you more, how to love you more
How to love you more, my friend
I don't know how to love you more, how to love you more
How to love you more, my

I don't know how to love you more, how to love you more
How to love you more, my friend
I don't know how to love you more, how to love you more
How to love you more, my

I guess we got, I guess we got
I guess we got nothing to say
I guess we got, I guess we got
I guess we got

It's not about you (don't you go)
I guess we got
It's not about you (don't you go)
I guess we got

It's not about about you
(don't you go home, don't you go home, don't you leave me here alone)
(don't you go home, don't you go home, don't you leave me here alone)
(don't you go home, don't you go home, don't you leave me here alone)
(And sometimes its good
Sometimes its bad
But living with you, well it's driving me mad
And sometimes its good
Sometimes its bad
But living with you is, well your driving me)

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
How to love you, but I love you so
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Why I love you, but I love you so

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Why I love you, but I love you so
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know

I guess we got, I guess we got
I guess we got nothing to say
I guess we got, I guess we got
I guess we got (nothing to say)
I guess we got (nothing to say)
I guess we got (nothing to say)

It's not about about you
(don't you go home, don't you go home, don't you leave me here alone)
(don't you go home, don't you go home, don't you leave me here alone)
(don't you go home, don't you go home, don't you leave me here alone)
(And sometimes its good
Sometimes its bad
But living with you, well it's driving me mad
And sometimes its good
Sometimes its bad
But living with you is, well your driving me)
