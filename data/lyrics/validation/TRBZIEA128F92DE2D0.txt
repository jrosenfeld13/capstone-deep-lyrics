Too dark
Too dark to see
And I can't feel my fingers anymore
I don't think you can save my life again
'Cause tonight destiny is at my door
Knocking on my door

Too cold
Too cold to run
And I can't sell my soul anymore
I don't think you'll call my name again
'Cause tonight destiny is at my door
Knocking on my door

Getting deep
Too deep to breathe
And I can't feel my fingers anymore
I don't think you'll call my name again
'Cause tonight destiny is at my door

Too dark
Too dark to see
I don't think you can save my life anymore
