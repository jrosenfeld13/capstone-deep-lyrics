You have all read the beautiful stories
Of the countries far over the sea
From whence came our ancestors
To establish this land of the free

There are some folks who still like to travel
To see what they have over there
But when they go look it's not like the book
And they find there is none to compare

To beautiful, beautiful Texas
Where the beautiful bluebonnets grow
We're proud of our forefathers
Who fought at the Alamo

You can live on the plains or the mountains
Or down where the sea breezes blow
And you're still in beautiful Texas
The most beautiful place that I know

You can travel on beautiful highways
By the cities, the village, the farms
Or fly above on the skyways
And the beauty below you will charm

White cotton, green pastures, blue rivers
Golden wheat fields and fruit trees that bear
You can look till doomsday and then you will say
That Texas has beauty to spare

Beautiful, beautiful Texas
Where the beautiful bluebonnets grow
We're proud of our forefathers
Who fought at the Alamo

You can live on the plains or the mountains
Or down where the sea breezes blow
And you're still in beautiful Texas
The most beautiful place that I know
And you're still in beautiful Texas
The most beautiful place that I know
