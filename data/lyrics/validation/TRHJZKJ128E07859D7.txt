[Verse 1: Ryan Miller]
When you look in the mirror
Wish you were somebody else
Just a perfect reflection
You and no one else

Minutes run into hours
Hours run into days
You're still waiting for someone
Who never ever came

[Chorus: Miller]
Fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa
Never be the same again
Fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa
Never be the same again

[Hook: Miller & Adam Gardner]
You were always saying something
Swear you'd never say again
You were always saying something
Swear you'd never say again

[Chorus: Miller & Gardner]
Fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa
Never be the same again
Fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa
Never be the same again

[Verse 2: Miller/Miller & Gardner]
Go and run through the hallways
Find your way to the door
You will end up like always
Back where you were before

Then you look in the mirror
Wish you were somebody else
But it's still your reflection
You and no one else

[Hook: Miller & Gardner]
You were always saying something
You swear you'd never say again
You were always saying something
You swear you'd never say again

[Chorus: Miller & Gardner]
Fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa
Never be the same again
Fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa
Never be the same again

[Bridge: Miller]
No matter where you go
You'll never find your way home
You'll never find your way home
No matter where you go

[Hook: Miller & Gardner]
You were always saying something
You swear you'd never say again
You were always saying something
You swear you'd never say again

[Chorus: Miller & Gardner]
Fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa
Never be the same again
Fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa
Never be the same again
