[Chorus]
Orange skies
Carnivals and cotton candy and you
And I love you too, you know I do

[Verse 1]
Nightingale
Prettier than anything in the world
And I love you too
You know I do

[Chorus 2]
You make me happy
Laughing, glad, and full of glee
And you don't have to try, girl
For you it comes so naturally
Right here in my arms

[Chorus]

[Chorus 2]
