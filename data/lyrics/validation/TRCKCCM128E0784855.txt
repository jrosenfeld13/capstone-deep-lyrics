Uh uh uh uh
Kick it out
If you went away and never came back
That would be too soon
The smell of your mouth would
Probably be still hanging in the room
He is a boy well he stole your dream
He let you in a magazine
But you're so full of shit
You couldn't even ever make that scene
I'm so glad
It feels so good
I'm so glad
It feels so good
I'm so glad
It feels so good
It feels so good
I'm not you
All of the words that you wrote
Really were lots of fun
But I don't think I ever really realized
Anyone could be so dumb
So butt-fucked inside your head
Don't even know it's gonna get any better
It didn't mean much to get you
No you didn't even print the letter
I'm so glad
It feels so good
I'm so glad
It feels so good
I'm so glad
It feels so good
It feels so good
I'm not you
So John Young in your black and white
OR
.................... on your bathroom wall
You should be in a hospital
Strapped down to one of those beds
And testing on some new drug
But I don't even think anyone would even
Know if you really got a tumor
You're so brain-dead it might even
Give you a sense of humor
I'm so glad
It feels so good
I'm so glad
It feels so good
I'm so glad
It feels so good
It feels so good
I'm not you
It feels so good
Now what happens
I'm so glad
It feels so good
I'm so glad
It feels so good
I'm so glad
It feels so good
I'm so glad
It feels so good
I'm so glad
It feels so good
I'm so glad glad
I'm so glad
It feels so good
I'm so glad
It feels so good
I'm so glad
It feels so good
I'm so glad
