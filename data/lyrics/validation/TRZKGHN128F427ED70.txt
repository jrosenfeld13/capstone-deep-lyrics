I took a ride on your fingertips
Heaven high with the thrill of it
And in your eyes for a moment
It's like we never said Goodbye
We took a walk for the hell of it
And we talked through the thick of it
And in your eyes for a moment
It's like we never said Goodbye

But something went wrong
You never came home
And time takes so long
What are these tears we're crying?

'Cos I remember the open roads
Met at the corner where no one goes
And no one mattered at all
And I remember the driving rain
Soaked to the skin these were perfect days
And I remember it all

'Friends' is such a horrid word
I sit at home with the thing we learned
You didn't phone
And in a different world
We'd have never said Goodbye

Where are we going with feeling alone?
We'll never know
What are these tears we're crying?

And I remember the open roads
Met at the corner where no one goes
And no one mattered at all
I remember the driving rain
Soaked to the skin these were perfect days
And I remember it all

And as for then and as for now
As for who and as for how
There's just one thing I can't forget
How beautiful
How beautiful you are

Hold onto dreams and to memories
They're the only things that really exist
And in your eyes I remembered
That we never said
Never said goodbye
