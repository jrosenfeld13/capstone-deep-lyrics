Oh sunny sunny day
I've never felt this way
My heart so light
The sight so bright
Oh honey honey say?
Did you make me this way?
Made me take life with ease
So darling won't you...

Spin the bottle, kiss and tell
Whisper wishes down the well
Hide and seek, Simon say?
...Do you wanna play?

Sunny sunny day
You make my heart sway
You make me sing
With all light you bring
Oh darling darling love
You're a gift from above
Now quit your foolish game of tease
And honey won't you please...

Spin the bottle, kiss and tell
Whisper wishes down the well
Hide and seek, Simon say?
...Do you wanna play?

Don't let the sun go down on this day
Can't it stay for ever this way?
But before our joy will cease
Oh honey, honey won't you please...

Spin the bottle, kiss and tell
Whisper wishes down the well
Hide and seek, Simon say?
...Do you wanna play?"
