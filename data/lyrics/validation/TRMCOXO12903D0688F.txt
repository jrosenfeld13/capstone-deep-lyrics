Deep in my heart - there's the storm
Always changing - cold and warm
I have slipped out - run and hide
Till I found out - what is right

Like a sharp thorn - won't let go
Like a new born - needs to know

No more pain now - calling out
She's my baby - there's no doubt

Gotta move now
Get in on now
Talking's done now
Taking charge now

Here I am again - it ain't over
What a fool you think I am - cannot leave her

I don't care friend - love doesn't need to make sense

Never told her - you're the one
While she waited - all so long

Gotta catch her - let her know
Ain't afraid now - touch and go

Gotta move now
Get in on now
Talking's done now
Taking charge now
