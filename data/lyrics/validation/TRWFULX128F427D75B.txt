One of these days is like a Christmas in April
One of these days is like a time in a rush
One of these days is like a disco on death row
When the music I s over, save the last dance for me
So what difference does it make
We all end up in the same wake
To dream of love or to dream of hate
A price or a pauper, the doctor or a leper
We all end up feeding worms one of these days
One of these days - Oh yeah
One of these days - Oh yeah
One of these days is gonna take me away
And I can't believe it - No, no
How old tramp John slept outside one night and froze
It was in the municipal park
That he laid his weary bones down
Hey! Hey! Hey! Who am I to pass judgement that way?
On a prince or a pauper or priest it's all the same
So when I finally drop off this mortal rock
Was it one day too early or one day too late?
One of these days - Oh yeah
One of these days - Oh yeah
One of these days is gonna take me away
