Dream wild in waves of confidence and heart
Don't underestimate the power of your part
Throw the rules away
Trust your gut and make it
On your own

Don't underestimate the glories of the road
Because when you're on your own you've got it all
Throw the rules away
To stand and deliver now
All is yours

I don't want to sit back to slack and waste it all
Since surrounded with the "Hearts and Souls"
I'll get back on my feet, wash my hands clean
And roll back to the front to sing out
"Here we go!"
Here we go, here we go, here we go...

Throw the rules away
To stand and deliver now
All is yours

I don't want to sit back to slack and waste it all
Since surrounded with the "Hearts and Souls"
I'll get back on my feet, wash my hands clean
And roll back to the front to sing out
"Here we go!"
