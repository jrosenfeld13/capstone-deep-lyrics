Welcome back Victoria
Since you've gone you know that no-one's really missed you
Welcome back Victoria
And now your friends watch over everything
That we-ee do

Welcome back Victoria
So the pendulum swings back
Welcome back Victoria
You went away, OK
We got a little slack

And once again you'll cover up
What you don't understand
Don't close your eyes
You can't hide behind your hands

Welcome back Victoria
We'll be no threat when we're deaf, dumb and blind
Welcome back Victoria
Clean books, clean screens, clean words
Dirty minds

I am a child of the sixties
And for that I must pay
You wag your finger all you like
I'll tell you something, it's my children
They'll have no choice but to say

Welcome back Victoria
I trust your piano legs are covered up again
Welcome back Victoria
Double standards are your forte, now as then

Welcome back Victoria
We'll tip our tophats
To those who walk the streets
And you know what i mean, now
Welcome back Victoria

On Commercial Street
Be careful who you meet
But you're alright, jack
Welcome back, welcome back, yeah
Welcome back, welcome back, eehee hee
