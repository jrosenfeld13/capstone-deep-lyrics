[Hook: Z-Ro]
Loving you is cool
But getting money is the only thing thats on my mind
I dont know what to do but hustle
Id be living on the street if Im not on my grind
Im doing the best I can, I need you to understand
To be on my side
Its a hell of sacrifice, Im chasing this cash for life
Its a long, long ride

[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
Its a long ride, a lot of lonely nights
Might be a lot of fuck-ups, for I finally get it right
Shit, I hope Im worth it, cause shit, you aint perfect
All them Gucci and Louis purses, I hope you deserve this
Stay down, only weak bitches lay down
We cant afford to just walk away from this pay now
Im shipping shit through greyhound taking that kind of chance
Could be locked up, but you rocked up living in many mansions
Hog life, gotta get it if its good
Niggas who get lazy end up back in the hood
If I lost it all, I probably lose you
So if its paper on the table, I can't choose you

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
Uh, if my pockets on flat, I cant enjoy you, baby
Doing anything without money to me, is just annoying, baby
I know you love looking at satellite TV
Them other niggas shit off, youll have to look at a DVD
Bitch I aint trying to hold your hand and take a walk in the park
I'd rather get my hustle on, so we dont have to talk in the dark
And fuck the repo, I aint give up my Bentley like that
Ill be god damned if I let the recession pin me like that
If I go to jail it's bail money
Its your red bottom, its Channel money
Plus the mortgage, fuck motel money
You smell good, but I'd rather smell money
I-10 is a football field, and I swear I'm a running back
So sit the fuck down and wait for me to come back with that money bag

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Z-Ro and Slim Thug]
Uh, I dont wanna be just news, baby
I wanna be the hot topic
Eat lobster every day of my life, what the hell is a hot pocket?
Catch your case it's all good, I hide your kid, shape up, now they got to drop it
Come home, keep fucking you until you say
Z-Ro, you got to stop it!
When Im done Im back, Im back, right back on my grind
Like YC I got racks on racks on racks right back on my mind
Youre living lavish, you love that shit
Cause you was broke before, you rode that dick
So I hope you learned how to love that brick
Cause without that bitch we wouldnt be shit
Shit, without these licks, you wouldnt be shit, no red bottoms
Bragging to your friend about how you got them
Different pair every time they spot them
Taking trips, first class flights
Its getting hard, but I love my life
Imma make sure my money right
Grind all day and I grind all night
Like drive around in foreigns and vacate when its boring
Touring the town like Im a tourist, sipping on drink 'til you see me snoring
I sleep good, since Im out the hood
I eat good in these streets (streets)
So Im gonna get this paper, Ill be back next week, Bye!
