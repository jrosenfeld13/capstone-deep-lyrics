The night will fall, the axe will drop
The key will turn, the door will lock
The needle will push, the pain will stop
The scene is set, prepare for shock

Fade to black
Fade to black
Fade to black
Fade to black

Your mind is full of evil thoughts
Your senses dulled as your body rots
You will go down on my command
Your will is gone, fall by my hand

The night will fall, the axe will drop
The key will turn, the door will lock
The needle will push, the pain will stop
The scene is set, prepare for shock

Fade to black
Fade to black
Fade to black
Fade to black
