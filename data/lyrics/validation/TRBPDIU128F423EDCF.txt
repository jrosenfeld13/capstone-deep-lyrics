Born of no nation
No occupation
Straight was my gait
If I mean what I think
Cold heart emotion
King of commotion
Just get me out of this life while I stink

I'm not sure if I'm in or I'm out
I had hope now where I keep my doubts

But if had confessions
I'd have concessions
I had to win at all costs
So it ends

Carers gave me life
Sharers gave me strife
I must get out
I need body and soul
I gave you madness
I gave you sadness
I don't have much body and you were all soul

I'm not sure if I'm in or I'm out
I had hope now where I keep my doubts

But if had confessions
I'd have concessions
I had to win at all costs
So it ends

All rise
All rise
All rise again

All rise
All rise
All rise again
It's the end

I'm not sure that my heart can grow
Once around this town has shown
That we're not survivors
We are the gizers
At this moment your heart should grow
But I'm tired, cold, used and sore
My childhood surrounds me
Please come and find me
Go, lassie, Go

All rise
All rise
All rise again

All rise
All rise
All rise again

All rise
All rise
All rise again

All rise
All rise
All rise again
It's the end
