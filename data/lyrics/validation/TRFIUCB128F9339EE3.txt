Bells you hear from everywhere
Fire is lightening through the air
Fear is driving you insane
Death - your life is in vain

He will tear your mind apart
Rip out your soul and heart
He will flame your eyes
He'll leave you no disguise

Bells exploding in your ears
Fire is burning up your tears
Fear - now for your life you cry
Death - you know you're gonna die

Time has come - incompetent you ruled
Time has come - with life and death you fooled
Time has come - a curse fell on your name
Time has come - you've got yourself to blame
