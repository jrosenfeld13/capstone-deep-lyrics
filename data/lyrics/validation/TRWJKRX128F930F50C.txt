*Note: Almost positive it's "grave" silence

Foreshadow my papers
Dress the living room
With your tears and a smile

A clashing rain
Drops to the ground
When you miss, you kiss
Your wounds

Next to me are your silly notes that
Came around and reversed my soul
Envelopes empty, they're closed
On another day

Looking for you
The picture isn't all that's left of you
And I never knew what to do
And it wouldn't have been love
If it wouldn't have been for your ...
Ooh, ooh

In the grave silence (x3)
I locked your love
(x2)

Drapes were drawn
When I let you in
But you were never invited

... come
And they ain't cheap
If I can be late
It's gonna hurt
If I wet my seal, so
Don't say "Go back
The way to the moon"

Send me the postcard just as soon
And the bird clock ticks all afternoon
Curfew's past, back in two
There's two, with the name
And date and time
And you

In the grave silence (x3)
I locked your love
(x3)

I'll buy the envelopes on another day
When your blood makes stamp stick
Drop the papers on your child's head

The warmest color of the dead
The blackest white you've ever read
And the crooner's man instead
With a warrior's face
And an arm
And a crossbow head

In the grave silence (x3)
I locked your love
(x3)

I didn't love
Silence!
Silence, ooh
