[Intro]
Moving without you
Moving without you
Loving without you
Loving without you
Happy without you
Happy without you
Happy without you
Better without you
Better without you
Happy without you

[Verse 1]
Everything is cool (I'm doing things my way)
I packed up all my things (I'm headed down the highway)
Every step I took (I took it on good ground)
Every move I made (I always make it somehow)
I been through the storm (yeah)
Been through the rain (yeah)
Suffered the hurt (yeah)
Dealt with the pain
I used to say I didn't know what I'd do without you
If I can make it without you
But I am doing better without you

[Chorus]
Moving without you
Moving without you (oh)
Moving without you
Moving without you
Moving without you
Moving without you
Baby I am
Loving without you (happy)
Happy without you (oh better off)
Better without you
Better I

[Verse 2]
Pursuing all my goals (and knowing what's best for me)
Living out my dreams (and saw what's important to me)
My focus is on point (and I can see clear now)
And every day is a brighter day (the darkness has died down)
I had some doubts (yeah)
I cried some tears (yeah)
Felt all alone (yeah)
But It is crushed all my fears
I used to say I did not know what I would do without you
If I can make it without you
But I am doing better without you

[Chorus]
Moving without you
Moving without you (oh)
Moving without you
Moving without you
Moving without you
Moving without you
Baby I am
Loving without you (happy)
Happy without you (oh better off)
Better without you
Better I

[Verse 3]
I am not reminiscing
I am living
In this moment
I am moving
Forward Because the worst is far behind me
I am leaving the resentment
I am releasing all the tension
Because It is finally about me

[Chorus]
Moving without you
Moving without you (oh)
Moving without you
Moving without you
Moving without you
Moving without you
Baby I am
Loving without you (happy)
Happy without you (oh better off)
Better without you
Better I
Moving without you
Moving without you (oh)
Moving without you
Moving without you
Moving without you
Moving without you
Baby I am
Loving without you (happy)
Happy without you (oh better off)
Better without you
Better I
