The army of Juda was paralyzed by fear
When they heard a mighty multitude was quickly drawing near
But as they prayed for deliverance
The victory would begin
For when we call upon the Lord, we summon all of Heaven

[Chorus]
Pray on
For you are who the Lord is looking for
Pray on
For this will tear those mighty strongholds down
Stay on your knees for this is where the battle is won
Very soon you'll win the victory, pray on

When Daniel faced the lions for worshiping the Lord
It seemed there was no hope at all for what would be in store
But when we stand on holy ground our smallest prayer is heard
Instead of on our circumstance our eyes are on the Lord

[Chorus]
Pray on
For you are who the Lord is looking for
Pray on
For this will tear those mighty stongholds down
Stay on your knees for this is where the battle is won
Very soon you'll win the victory, pray on

When your questions go unanswered
And your prayers may seem in vain
They don't seem to make a difference
They don't seem to make a change
Just rest assured God knows your needs
And He hears each time you pray
Your prayers are reaching Heaven and the answers on the way

[Chorus]
Pray on
For you are who the Lord is looking for
Pray on
Tear them mighty strongholds down
Stay on your knees for this is where the battle is won
There's no better place for you to be
Then seeking the Father prayfully
Very soon you'll win the victory
Pray on
