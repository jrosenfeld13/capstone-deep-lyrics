You always said that you would stay
I never thought you would
I never thought you would
I finally found the words to say
I never thought I could
Never thought I could

Right here and now
Hand upon my heart
I need you now
Never be apart
Believe me when I say
I wont ever let you down

You never said that you would go
I always thought you would
I always thought you would
But I can't live without you now
I always thought I could
Always thought I could

Nobody else
Could ever woo me like you do
Wrap me around your heart
And let me love you
Let me love you
