Do you
Girl im talking about you
You're so fine, online, with that view
Girlfriend, im the man they call love
No other man can do what I does, (does)
Your boy's a twerp, he's a lame, ma he can't work
He's ain't go money but promises
And im about money with promises, (ay)
Lay back im about to pay-back
Haters wanna front, but they quick to lay back
Quick to stay back. Here's a prozac
I go to the bank, that's where my dough's at
Online she flaunts her curves
She's coming on like "its hot in here"
Fantasy girl, fantasy what
Fantasy girls all over the world

She's a star in every scene
Nothing ever gets between us
My Fantasy Girl (come play with me)
Dancing to me in her janes
Nothing ever gets between us
My Fantasy Girl (come play with me)

Sofia Legend
She's a legend yea
She's the reason I lose sleep, like everywhere
Shake your derriere, got me really tongue-tied
Turns the lights off, you ain't got a man right?
A lot of guys got really angry
Me on your blog, so they chose to envy
How you wrote my name all over your chest
Yes, I'am all over your chest, baby
Turn around and be free
Can't go wrong, unless, you do he
He's a fake, he's not me
He ain't got cake, no, not like me (meeee)
I'm so contagious
Im in my zone
21 years old, C-E-O
Young money many, what chu know about, dough

She's a star in every scene
Nothing ever gets between us
My Fantasy Girl (come play with me)
Dancing to me in her janes
Nothing ever gets between us
My Fantasy Girl (come play with me)

I think of love like everytime, I look inside your eyes
You made me feel alive again, then left me hypnotized
Ive been alone for several months, coz I can't find a girl
Who understands the way I work and live inside my world
So I went online to meet this girl, shes something like a star
Shes my fantasy, my drama queen, my every breath and (ahhh)
Shes my fantasy girl, and I like the way she move
With them boots with the fur, with them boots with the fur (fur)

She's a star in every scene
Nothing ever gets between us
My Fantasy Girl (come play with me)
Dancing to me in her janes
Nothing ever gets between us
My Fantasy Girl (come play with me)
