A windstorm dropped a bird from the sky
It fell to the ground and it's wings broke and died
But when the time got by, back to sky it flied
Cause the wings healed in time and the bird was I

Time is the death, and the healing
Take your last breath, cause death is deceiving
Time is the past, now and tomorrow
Days fly so fast, and it leaves me so hollow

Time is the death, and the healing
Take your last breath, cause death is deceiving
Time is the past, now and tomorrow
Days fly so fast, and it leaves me so hollow

A snowstorm blew inside a wolf's eyes
And the frozen tears covered all the mountainsides
But then the time got by and the wolf died
And someday that wolf would be I...

Time is the death, and the healing
Take your last breath, cause death is deceiving
Time is the past, now and tomorrow
Days fly so fast, and it leaves me so hollow

Time is the death, and the healing
Take your last breath, cause death is deceiving
Time is the past, now and tomorrow
Days fly so fast, and it leaves me so hollow
