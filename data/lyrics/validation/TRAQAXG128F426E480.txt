Decapitated, but feel no pain
Reign of terror, Hell's the name
Will not die with no regrets
My spirit lives, Return undead

Blood spills out from your neck
A twisted thought, A brutal fucking set
Blood will start to ooze
Now I leave you scarred and bruised

Still I breathe, From severed neck
I love to kill, I die and hate
An evil power in a blacken night
Without a head, Don't try to fight
