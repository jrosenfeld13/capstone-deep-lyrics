Jimmy met Jackie
And Jamie was suffering
Marco met Marlon
And Maddie was suffering
Suffering
Drifting apart
She needs someone to say to her
No go away
This is over
Get over it
He knows it over
But she knows she loving him
Hes found another to take care and mother him
Does love fall apart by itself?
Or does it just find someone else?
Tell me
Do you need somebody?
Tell me
Do you love somebody
Are you loving somebody
Cause i got to got to got to got to know
Are you needing somebody?
I really need to know
Do you love somebody?
Do you love somebody?
And is that somebody ?
