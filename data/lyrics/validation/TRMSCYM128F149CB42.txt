I can't feel my love anymore
I can't feel my love anymore
The mystery and the splendor
Don't thrill me like before
I can't feel my love anymore

I don't want to talk to anyone
I don't want to talk to anyone
All the words that used to work
Have melted in the sun
And I don't want to talk to anyone

Faces look familiar
But they don't have names
Towns I used to live in
Have been rearranged
Highways I once traveled down
Don't look the same
Everything has changed
Everything has changed

I can't find my joy anywhere
I can't find my joy anywhere
All the magic vanished into the misty air
And I can't find my joy anywhere

Now I don't know where my faith has gone
Now I don't know where my faith has gone
From the wonder I had a sense of
To the brightest star that shone
And now I don't know where my faith has gone

Faces look familiar
But they don't have names
Towns I used to live in
Have been rearranged
Highways I once traveled down
Don't look the same
Everything has changed
Everything has changed
