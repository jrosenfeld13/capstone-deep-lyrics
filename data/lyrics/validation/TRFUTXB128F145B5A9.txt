You're like fire and ice
Oh you love me so good
But you don't think twice about leaving me here
I get use to you gone
Then you tell me you care
And I got to find a way to get you
To commit to me
Oh can't you see?

Like a ball and chain around my neck
You weigh me down but I'm not ready yet
To give you up and face the pain
I'd rather wear a ball and chain

I've never been touched this way
And I give you my all but I want you to say you need more than my time
Oh you say you'll be here
But your still not mine
And I want you give your love oh to only me
Oh can't you see

Like a ball and chain around my neck
You weigh me down but I'm not ready yet
To give you up and face the pain
I'd rather wear a ball and chain

Oh they say that all good things will come to those who wait
But the more I wait the more I wonder
Am I holding a love going nowhere?

Like a ball and chain around my neck
You weigh me down but I'm not ready yet
To give you up and face the pain
I'd rather wear a ball and chain

Like a ball and chain around my neck
You weigh me down but I'm not ready yet
To give you up and face the pain
I'd rather wear a ball and chain

Rather wear a ball and chain
