Can I prevent this loss and pain to hasten my release
Or am I damned to existence alone
Sear me child, let this pain set me free again
With broken promise, never know what this life could bring
And the time spent alone sorting through emotions
Is a blessing that I know I cannot repay
With only words I can't express my deep regret
Of time gone by and of feelings that I'll never know
Pain believed but never shared has left me damaged here
My wounds will bleed anew, I am now exposed
Reaching out, reaching in the pain that grips me
Holds me tight in crushed embrace
Holding out, holding out, try to protect from what I fear
Reaching out, reaching in the pain that grips me
Hold me tight is crushed embrace
Holding out, holding out, try to protect from what I fear
Revel in my loss
Sear me child, let this pain set me free again
With broken promise, never know what this life could bring
And the time spent alone sorting alone through emotions
Is a blessing that I know I cannot repay
Revel in my loss
Reaching out, reaching in the pain that grips me
Holds me tight in crushed embrace
Holding out, holding out, try to protect from what I fear
Reaching out, reaching in the pain that grips me
Holds me tight in crushed embrace
Holding out, holding out, try to protect from what I fear
The end draws light with this pressure
Lacerations upon you relieve yourself
Pain that grips me
