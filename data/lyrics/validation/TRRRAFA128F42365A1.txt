A boy, a girl- a love story
But why did it end in misery?
Taking our chances, getting our thrills..
Taking and taking but never getting our fill
And this is what I see
A modern love story
Love defined on our TV
Telling us, teaching us what we need
Are we in love or just so alone
That we're looking for anyone to hold?
When the prey is caught, the thrill gone
So we'll switch partners and move along
And we won't use our brains
Because our lust is too strong
Overlooking the person to whom the body belongs
