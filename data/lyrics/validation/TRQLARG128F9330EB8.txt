Take up the hammer, strike the iron
Silence is filling you now
No escape for your misdealings
Misery guides the vines that twist and choke inside you

Seize the day, drop the blade
The end is truth, I'm living proof
I watched my future die

Through all the burned down bridges
Wasted years spent chasing demons

There's nothing left to regret
Not even a fool like you should go on
Fly into the sun
I'll laugh when worn out wings burn

Through all the burned down bridges
Wasted years spent chasing demons
Another burned out town, acidic, dried out
Starving, desolation dealt in spades

Kill yourself, let there be no lies between us
Trephination of the will
Kill myself, let there be no ties between us
Another chalk line for the till

There's nothing left to regret
Not even a fool like you should go on
Fly into the sun
I'll laugh when worn out wings burn

I haven't shed a tear
It's been so long through bitter years
Maybe I'm the one who'll die
When worn out wings burn

Temptation baits the addict gene
Familiar places, empty spaces
Hereditary path of destruction
Coma-white riddled with sickness

Through all the burned down bridges
Wasted years spent chasing demons

Abandon your hope, for no one is listening
Turning a deaf ear to you
Excess of this unfit king I am
To this earth flesh I'll deliver

There's nothing left to regret
Not even a fool like you should go on
Fly into the sun
I'll laugh when worn out wings burn

I haven't shed a tear
It's been so long through bitter years
Maybe I'm the one who'll die
When worn out wings burn
