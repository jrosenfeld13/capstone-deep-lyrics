Why, why should I feel so sad
Thinking of times
When life was a smile
I've dreamed of turning back time
To memories so dear
Now I'm here
Where I must go on

When I close my eyes
I long to be there
One more time

Sometimes I look back and smile
With a tear
No end at all
Never go back
Anymore

When I close my eyes
I long to be there
One more time

I know tomorrow
I'll look on today
So now I step back
And reach for a smile for now
Here's my yesterday

When I close my eyes
I long to be there
One more time
