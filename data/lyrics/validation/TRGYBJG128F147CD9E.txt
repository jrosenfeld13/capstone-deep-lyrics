Seek me, hear I come
Seek me, hear I come
Think I lost the bra
Think I lost mine too
Wanna take the car?
Seek me, hear I come
We could drive all night
We could stop and spoon
Wanna take the car?
Seek me, hear I come
Look at all the pretty girls
See her yeah she smiles for you
Look behind the pretty girls
See me yeah, I'm smiling too
Hey, hey
Had the time of my life with you
Hey, hey
Had the time of my life with you
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Seek me, hear I come
Seek me, hear I come
Think your mamma's out
Brother's in his room
Hope she's out all night
Seek me, hear I come
Tiny hands what cheat
A river lost at sea
Hope she's out all night
Seek me, hear I come
Look at all the pretty girls
See her, yeah, she smiles for you
Look behind the pretty girls
See me, yeah, I'm smiling too
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
