Grant me the powers of thunder
And give me a sword forged in the raging Hell's fire
Lend me the eight legged black stallion of Odin and I'll have my vengeance
Oh, I'll kill with desire

Vengeance flows like boiling poison through my twisted veins
Tonight I'll blood shed with wrath and set the night on flames
Invincible in battle, wargods hear my deathwish cry
I'll laugh in the face of death, I into glory ride

Snarling breath upon your backs, I'm vengeance incarnate
Now it's time, the moment's comed, stand up now, face my hate
See the fire in my eyes, the final light you'll see
I send you to the darkness with my sword of thunder and steel

(Repeat second verse)
I let the bodies lie in shame
I let mighty earth drink their blood
I turn my face to eternal sky
And praise my elders' God
Equimanthorn hear my Hail
You're the mighty four winds night and day
Steel in every warrior's heart and sword
The brave and wise in flesh and soul
Equimanthorn, Equimanthorn, Equimanthorn, Equimanthorn
Equimanthorn, Equimanthorn, Equimanthorn, Equimanthorn
