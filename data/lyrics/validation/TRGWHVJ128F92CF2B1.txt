I believe in miracles
I believe in you
I believe in miracles
I believe in you

They say the day is ending
Let's watch the sun go down
And plan a holiday for two
For all eternity
I'm gonna count till you can see
The world I created just for you

Oh, I saw you standing on the street
I wanted to meet you and stop for a while
You gave me a smile when you said hello

Now everything's so good inside
Never realized that I didn't hide
The feeling that came when you felt the same

I believe in miracles, I believe in miracles
I believe in miracles, don't you?
