Oh my god, oh my god, I'm insane
Nothing works, you know
But everyone seems safe
They control, everything is a static scene
Is this all, at all? I need more than what I see
Have you got a chance, have you ever found a reason?
Before you can forget
Have you got a chance, everybody gotta need to know
Is there something to believe?

Now, there's nothing I can change
I need the speed of light
Nothing I can save
No less than the speed of light
Dream another place
Away
Away

Oh my god, oh my god, I'm insane
Time's too short, you know
And someone I want to be
Gets no choice, forgetting my reality
Need to know, you know, if everything is destiny
Have you got a chance, have you ever had a reason?
Collapse into myself
Have you got a chance, everybody gotta need to know
Where eternity begins

Now, there's nothing I can change
I need the speed of light
Nothing I can save
No less than the speed of light
Dream another place
Away
Away
Away

Nothing I am now
I need the speed of light
Nothing I can save
No less than the speed of light
Nothing I can change
I need the speed of light
Dream another place
Away
Away
Away
