Eyes don't see you
They'll see your life looking back on you
And when your stuck there kissing yourself
Nobody's gonna be around to tell you
Eyes don't see you
They'll see your life looking back on you
And when we're stuck there kissing ourselves
Nobody's gonna be around to tell you
Oh Regina, keeps herself busy holding hands
Oh Regina, trying to imagine
You always said you'd never be alone
Oh Regina, oh Regina
Slurring a reason to thank you
These things the same
All of the tears we gave each other
Don't change a thing
Well hello, take care
That friendly weather we were planning on
Didn't work out that fair, you feel mad to be sad
We gotta turn this thing round and start again
Oh Regina
Likes to keep herself busy holding hands
Oh Regina
Trying to imagine
You never said you'd be alone
