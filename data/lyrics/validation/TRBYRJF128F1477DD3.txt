Sailin' down the coast of Mexico
With a person I loved since long ago
Into a place nobody wants to go

Into a hurricane
Whoa, hurricane
Some'll be taken
Some'll remain

Heard people screamin' and the sky was torn
I looked around and the faces were so forlorn
No relief, only scorn

In a hurricane
In a hurricane
Some'll be taken
Some'll remain

Hurricane's just another name
For the torment in a man's soul
His mind is gone
And he starts to lose control

In a hurricane
Oh, the hurricane
Some'll be taken
Some'll remain

How long will the wind blow?
How long will the wind blow?
Everybody talks; nobody really knows
How long will the wind blow?
How long will the wind blow?
Shoo-ba-ree-ba, shoo-ba-ree-ba
Nobody knows

How long will the wind blow?
How long will the wind blow?
Everybody talks; nobody really knows
How long will the wind blow?
How long will the wind blow?
Shoo-ba-ree-ba, shoo-ba-ree-ba ...
