We sleep at day, we feed at night
We catch the flight
We taste the wine amd life's a scream
And love's a bite

Silence breaks through the air
Eyes of flame, burn my stare
Can't resist it's way too strong
Come where only you belong

And be one of us
One of us come taste the wine and fly away
One of us last boys alive we die to play
One of us come taste the blood of life with me
One of us be one of us I know the way

We fear the sun, worship the moon
We've come undone
We've sold ourself, immortal youth
Nomads we are one

Silence breaks through the air
Eye's of flame burn my stare
Can't resist it's way too strong
Come where only you belong

And be one of us
One of us come taste the wine and fly away
One of us last boys alive we die to play
One of us come taste the blood of life with me
One of us be one of us I know the way
