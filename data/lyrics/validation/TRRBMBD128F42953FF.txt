When he comes bursting thru that door
Mama leaps and hits the floor
Calling himself Louis Quatorze
He's so young and dangerous

Oh I love it when he says so seriously
With his gun in my back
"Honey, close your eyes and think of England"
Just one second
It's his genuine act
As a matter of fact, Louis was horrible to me
He tears down my defenses
He pretends that I'm against him

Chorus:
Come back again
Don't tell me when
Louis Quatorze always surprise me

Louis, Louis, Louis did love me
Louis Quatorze made love to me
Fourteen's how I'll ever be
I don't know how long it lasts
But one thing's for sure

Louis Quatorze must hurry to love me
And more and more and more and more
Louis Quatorze loves me some more

Louis, Louis's locking my door
Louis's serious
I'm delirious
He loves me just 'cos he's so ware
Louis's gonna shoot me

No plays
He just doesn't care
Louis Quatorze starts to undress me
You just don't mess with Louis Quatorze
With his gun in my back
I start to undress
He's my partner in this crime of happiness
Cause I'm just fourteen

Oh I love it when he says so seriously
With his gun in my back
"Honey, make love to me"
Chorus repeats 2x

Louis Quatorze, I love you
