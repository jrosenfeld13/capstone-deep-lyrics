Cry! Cry! Cry!
It's bad you know
When you have those girls
And they try to slip out on you
I had one like that
But I heard her feet
When they hit that bridge
That's when I told her

I'm gonna leave you babe, I'm gonna leave you baby
I'm gonna leave you babe, I'm gonna leave you baby
I don't care where you go

RL:She said what!?
JS:What?
RL:I told her again, Jon
JS:What!

I'm gonna leave you babe, I'm gonna leave you baby
I'm gonna leave you babe, I'm gonna leave you baby
I'm gonna leave you babe
I don't care where you go

RL:Come on Brown!

I'm going
I'm going
Don't care where you go

RL:Then I told her these words

I'd rather be dead, I'd rather be dead
I'd rather be dead, I'd rather be dead
Six feet in the ground

RL:She ask me why?
JS:What!
RL:Yeah!
JS:What!
RL: I just told her

Some other man, some other man
Some other man, some other man
Always hanging around

RL: Look out Jon!

RL:Hey!

I'm going
I'm going
Don't care where you go

RL:Well well well!
