Close your eyes
Give me your hand, darling
Do you feel my heart beating?
Do you understand?
Do you feel the same?
Am I only dreaming?
Is this burning?
An eternal flame

I believe
It's meant to be, darling
I watch you when you are sleeping
You belong with me
Do you feel the same?
Am I only dreaming?
Or is this burning?
An eternal flame

Say my name
Sun shines through the rain, oh
Light surrounds me
Then you come and ease the pain
I don't want to lose this feeling, oh

Say my name
Sun shines through the rain, oh
Light surrounds me

I don't want to lose this feeling, oh

Close your eyes
Give me your hand, darling
Do you feel my heart beating?
Do you understand?
Do you feel the same?
Am I only dreaming?
Or is this burning?
An eternal flame

Close your eyes
Give me your hand, darling
Do you feel my heart beating?
Do you understand?
Do you feel the same?
Am I only dreaming?
Or is this burning?
An eternal flame

Close your eyes
Give me your hand, darling
Do you feel my heart beating?
Do you understand?
Do you feel the same?
Am I only dreaming?
Is this burning?
An eternal flame
