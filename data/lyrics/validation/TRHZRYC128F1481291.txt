Your Life dreams are shattered, now you're gone away
We've cried here for hours, and the hours turn to days
We know you regret this, leaving us here
With portraits and memories that we've held so dear

When I hear your name, it's not the same
No matter what they say, I'm not okay
And we started at zero, and went different ways
Now we're all out here wasting away

And if we started at zero, then how did things change?
It seems like just yesterday we were the same

It's been 3 months since he left us
So far nothing's been the same
And my question without answer is:
Am I the one to blame?

And he was such a good description of a favored future man
He spoke well of other people, and they said the same for him

When I hear your name, it's not the same
No matter what they say, I'm not okay
And we started at zero, and went different ways
Now we're all out here wasting away
And if we started at zero, then how did things change?
It seems like just yesterday, we were the same
We were the same

They say they're sorry, well what are they sorry for?
How can they possibly know what I'm going through?

I feel like no one's ever had to deal with this pain that I'm dealing with right now
Just 6 months ago everything was fine, or so it seemed
What turn of event caused him to go downhill?

His parents are devastated
His girlfriend's depressed
What was he thinking!?

And we started at zero, and went different ways
Now we're all out here wasting away
Wasting away
Wasting away
Wasting away

And we started at zero, and went different ways
Now we're all out here wasting away
And if we started at zero, then how did things change?
It seems like just yesterday, we were the same
We were the same
We were the same
