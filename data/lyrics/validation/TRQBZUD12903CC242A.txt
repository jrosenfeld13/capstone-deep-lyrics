Looking into reaching someone
Filling up my vase with dimes
Smashing into this tin cup
Fixed up with a pair of broken pliers

Get what you are, right into me
One thousand more times

Here it comes (i'm saving you, i'm saving me)
Mother nature so cold and severe
Turns my tears into icy skies
Reaching for self preservation
Stale blood surrounds you drawing muddy flies

Get what you are, right into me
One thousand more times

Here it comes (i'm saving you, i'm saving me)

Not of this world, for in my mind, i roam around in space
So far away i long and wait, to meet a friendly face
Voices echo in my past, but still i'm lost in space
In the silence a flickering light, that blinks on endlessly
So far away i long and wait, to meet a friendly face
Not of this world, for in my mind, i roam around in space
