Got a vicar with a dice to see the world is not my size
To breed a creed that keeps my mind from off this world for sure
There's a traitor without fear screamin' truths into my ear
Yes I've surely got your point;
Please stay away anyhow

Please don't say you care, please don't say you dare
Please don't say you understand what I demand
When all you see is nothing but your gain
So don't try to make me believe you care

Got a devil deep inside - take my hand when worlds collide
To lead aside from all the views that penetrate my mind
Far to sell my inner soul - earn some money, gain control
But lately I have come to hear me talkin' to myself

Please don't say you care, please don't say you dare
Please don't say you understand what I demand
When all you see is nothing but your gain
So don't try to make me believe you care

There must be something else - far away
There must be more to this - somewhere in my dreams
Is it hiding in my sleep ?
Am I made to never know ?
Where to go

Please don't say you care, please don't say you dare
Please don't say you understand what I demand
When all you see is nothing but your gain
So don't try to make me believe you care
Don't try to make me believe you care
Don't try to make me believe you care
