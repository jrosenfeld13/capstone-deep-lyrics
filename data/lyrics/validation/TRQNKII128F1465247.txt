There's a time of the day
When the sun is going down
That's the golden time of day
It's a time that the sun
Turns a gold all around
That's the golden time of day
At the end of the day
When the wind is soft and warm
Don't it makes the flowers sway

When the sun settles down
And it takes a lovely form
That's the golden time of day

People let me tell you
There's a time in your life
When you find who you are
That's the golden time of day
And in you mind you will find
Your a bright shining star
That's the golden time of day
That's the golden time of day
That's the golden time of day
Shining can't you see it shining
Shine you just shine
Shining can't you see it shining
That you love my shine
Shining can't you see it shining
Feel it feel it
Shining can't you see it shining
Shine if you believe in love
Shining can't you see it shining
Look above and keep your heart yeah yeah
Shining can't you see it shining
And you belive in love shine
Shining can't you see it shining
Shine your love
Shine your love
Shine your love
Shining can't you see it shining
