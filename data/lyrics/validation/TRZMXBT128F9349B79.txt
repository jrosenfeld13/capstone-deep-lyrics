Yeah, yeah, oh yeah
I've got it all but I feel so deprived
I go up, I come down and I'm emptier inside
Tell me what is this thing that I feel like I'm missing
And why can't I let it go?
There's gotta be more to life
Than chasing down every temporary high
To satisfy me 'cause the more that I'm
Trippin' out, thinkin' there must be more to life
Well, there's life but I'm sure there's gotta be more
(Than wanting more)
I've got the time and I'm wasting it slowly
Here in this moment I'm half-way out the door
Onto the next thing
I'm searching for something that's missing
There's gotta be more to life
Than chasing down every temporary high
To satisfy me 'cause the more that I'm
Trippin' out, thinkin' there must be more to life
Well, there's life but I'm sure there's gotta be more
I'm wanting more
Oh, I'm always waiting on something
Other than this
Why am I feelin' like
There's something I've missed? Yeah
(Something I've missed)
There's gotta be more to life
Than chasing down every temporary high
To satisfy me 'cause the more that I'm
Trippin' out, thinkin' there must be more to life
Well, there's life but I'm sure
There's gotta be more to life
Than chasing down every temporary high
To satisfy me 'cause the more that I'm
Trippin' out, thinkin' there must be more to life
Well, there's life but I'm sure
(There's gotta be more to life)
More to, more to, more to life
(There's gotta be more to life)
More to, more to life
More to life
There's gotta be more
(There's gotta be more to life)
More to life
