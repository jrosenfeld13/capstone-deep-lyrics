I'm out of life, gimme my blood
I need some fuel
Give it to me
Out of control gimme some blood
Can't stop me now

Don't shout this is my blood
I'm here, this is for you
Open the veins
Again and again, again and again

Another night, gimme your blood
You need to feed me
Give it to me
Out of control gimme some blood
Can't stop me now

Out of my mind, gimme my blood
I need your love
Give it to me
Out of control gimme some blood
Can't stop me now

This heaven now will pass away
No, I can't wait anymore
Another life another day
I'll never let you go
Another scar inside my pain
Gimme something more
Inside my heart you'll find my reign
You'll find my reign
