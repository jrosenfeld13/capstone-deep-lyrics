Sunrise,sunrise I'm sleepy hard
I should get up to school but i couldn't get out of bed
I never came back alive from the dream that i had
It seemed like every night then,every night

Spoiled,oh yes I've always been wanting more at first sight of your life then the sight of a whore
Because it all comes down to the nightmares I've had
And I don't think you'll understand

I was on the lonliest road girl,yes I was
You put me back on it
Yeah you did and I will walk here until the end of time
If you don't send a rescue team
But I ain't really sure if I want you to

A new morning arrived,I'm the greatest hero,I felt the comfort
Reminding of my time in utero
One creates nothing but two creates one and I kill my half

'Cause I'm the son of a gun girl,yes I am
On this lonely road girl,that I'mm on
And I will walk here until the end of time
If you don't send a rescue team
But I ain't really sure if I want you to

No I ain't really sure if I want you to
Perhaps I'd rather be on my own
No I don't think I want you to carry me home
