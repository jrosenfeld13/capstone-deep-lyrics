Don't go to gibsom cross the river
The devil is hungry
The devil is sweet
If you are soft then you will shiver
They hang the alley cats on gibsom street
I wish my baby were forbidden
I wish my world be struck by sleet
I wish to keep my mirror hidden
To hide the eyes that looked on gibsom street

In my sorrow, oh my morning

There is a man he knows where I'm going
Gave me a strawberry to eat
I sucked its juices never knowing
That I would sleep that night on gibsom street
