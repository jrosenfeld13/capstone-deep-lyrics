We fear for our lands, fear for our lives
Fear for the sake of the world
A terrorist strike unforgiving and rude
Rapes this shell of its pearl

Terrible tyranny goes undetected
Though thousands of souls are now lost
Terrible tyranny asks for a price
The innocent all pay the cost

Their evil is darkness, it steals all the light
That shines from our purified souls
Their evil is wrong with no sense of right
It spoils, ruins and controls

Our time is now to make a stand
Take matters in our own hands
We'll strike at the core of this tyrant's heart
Win back the pride of our land
