We're the red heads with curly hair
October scented lingerie
Today found tomorrow
I'm not kidding you around
I found a way into my mind

Well we're ready to roll
Well we're ready to roll
Well we're ready to roll
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't want
I don't want to know
I don't want to know (x2)

My only daughter's on my mind
She's got curly blond hair and I've got straight brown

Well we're ready to roll
Well we're ready to roll
Well we're ready to roll
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't want
I don't want to know
I don't want to know (x2)

I remember her hair, it smelled like bonfire
Her jawbone so sharp, it would cut your hand off

I know what you're thinking Barbara, but you gotta believe me the only
People that are around at this time of the night are the cops
