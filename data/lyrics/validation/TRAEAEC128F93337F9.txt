How long I have wanted
This dream to come true
And as it approaches
I can't believe I'm through

I've tried
Oh, how I've tried for a life
Yes, a life I thought I knew

Oh, it's the price we gotta pay
And all the games we gotta play
Makes me wonder if it's worth it to carry on
'Cause it's a game we gotta lose
Though it's a life we gotta choose
And the price is our own life until it's done

Time seems to have frozen
But the mind can be fooled
As the days pass, I discover
Destiny just can't be ruled

Hard times
Oh, hard times for the prize
Yes, the prize I thought I knew

Oh, it's the price we gotta pay
And all the games we gotta play
Makes me wonder if it's worth it to carry on
'Cause it's a game we gotta lose
Though it's a life we gotta choose
And the price is our own life until it's done

Oh, it's the price we gotta pay
And all the games we gotta play
Makes me wonder if it's worth it to carry on
'Cause it's a game we gotta lose
Though it's a life we gotta choose
And the price is our own life until it's done

Oh, it's the price we gotta pay
And all the games we gotta play
Makes me wonder if it's worth it to carry on
'Cause it's a game we gotta lose
Though it's a life we gotta choose
And the price is our own life until it's done
