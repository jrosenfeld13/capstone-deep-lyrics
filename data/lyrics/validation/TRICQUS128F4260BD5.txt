There's no time for what I say. There's the girl friend of the whirling dervish. When there's time for love, I'll be there to fall in love with ya
Shall I be the boy of the whirling dervish or you? I think your the girl friend of the whirling dervish. Shall I say that again or maybe should I not. You're the girl friend of the whirling dervish
[Instrumental solo]
Should I have called you the girl friend of the whirling dervish baby? Now I know you're the girl friend of the whirling dervish
