Have I waited too long
To say that I love you?
Have I waited too long
For my dreams to come true?

Each day here I pray
That you will forgive me
I know I was wrong
Have I waited too long

It seems that all started
The day that we parted
I love you much more, now
Than ever before

If you'll only forgive
You'll never be sorry?
I'll right every wrong
Have I waited too long?

Have I waited too long
To beg you forgiveness
Down hearted and blue
Always thinking of you

Each night in my dreams
Your memories haunt me
I just can't go on
Have I waited too long

It seems that all started
The day that we parted
I love you much more, now
Than ever before

If you'll only forgive
You'll never be sorry?
I'll right every wrong
Have I waited too long?...
