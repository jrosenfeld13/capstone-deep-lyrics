[Chorus](x3)
Stationary robbery
I stole your pen, so you can't even write again

Stationary robbery
I stole your pen...

[Verse 1]
I took your HB, 2B and your sharpie
Your protractor set, laptop and PC
Now you can't write, nor can you type
Let's just say your office supplies are really tight
You can walk and talk, but you can't use chalk
I've even got your blackboard on my jock
I cock back your stapler with my hole punch caper
The Grand  android; Toy bandit cause I'm their paper clip taker

[Chorus](x2)

[Verse 2]
Finders keepers
Three ring binder weepers
Death to your desk, I'm the cubicle reaper
No ethernet, no internet, no email, no
Actually I saw your modem in an old box at my yard sale
Frustration
You lack a power point presentation
No pointer, no laser, just a pencil with a wore down eraser
I own your paper, stapler and your hole punch
And while I robbed your office
I even stole lunch

[Chorus](x3)

[Chorus](x4)
