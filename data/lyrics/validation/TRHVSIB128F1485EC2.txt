[Verse 1]
Please speak softly, for they will hear us
And they'll find out why we don't trust them
Speak up dear, 'cause I cannot hear you
I need to know why we don't trust them

[Chorus]
Explain to me this conspiracy against me
Yeah-yeah
And tell me how I've lost my power
Oh-oh-yeah

[Verse 2]
Where can I turn, 'cause I need something more
Surrounded by uncertainty I'm so unsure of
Tell me why I feel so alone
'Cause I need to know to whom do I owe

[Chorus]
Explain to me this conspiracy against me
Yeah-yeah
And tell me how I've lost my power
Oh-oh-yeah

[Bridge]
I thought that we'd make it
Because you said that we'd make it through
And when all security fails will you be there
To help me through

[Chorus]
Explain to me this conspiracy against me
Yeah-yeah
And tell me how I've lost my power
How

(I lost my power)
