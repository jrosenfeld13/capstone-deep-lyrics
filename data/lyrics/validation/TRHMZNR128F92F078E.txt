[Verse 1]
I think I'm going to stay home
Have myself a home life
Sitting in the slow motion
And listening to the daylight
I am not a nomad
I am not a rocket man
I was born a house cat
By the slight of my mother's hand
I think I'm going to stay home

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to live in the center of a circle
I want to live on the side of a square
I used to be in my M-Z now
You'll never find me because my name isn't there

[Chorus]
Home life
Been holding out for a home life
My whole life

[Verse 2]
I want to see the end game
I want to learn her last name
Finish on a Friday and sit in traffic on the highway
See, I refuse to believe that my life's going to be
Just some string of incompletes
Never to lead me to anything remotely close to home life

[Chorus]
Home life
Been holding out for a home life
My whole life

[Verse 3]
I can tell you this much, I will marry just once
And if it doesn't work out
Give her half of my stuff
It's fine with me
We said eternity, and I will go to my grave
With the life that I gave
Not just some melody line
On a radio wave
It dissipates, and soon evaporates
But home life doesn't change
(But home life doesn't change)

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to live in the center of a circle
I want to live on the side of a square
I used to be in my M-Z now
You'll never find me because my name isn't there

[Chorus]
Home life
You take the home life
You keep the home life
I'll come back for the home life I promise, home life
I promise, life I promise, home life, home life
