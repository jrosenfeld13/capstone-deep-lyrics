Lets see how it feels (lets see how it feels)
So thought to stick to what youve earned
What you believe in? (what do you believe in?)
No matter what they say

You better board the right ship
Cause sinking has never been so easy
Like a stone in this sea of strangers

This time you better watch out
Out of the line, I wont be pushed around
Cause there is one too many lessons
Far too many ways to learn
Well make it, make sense

Lets see how it feels (lets see how it feels)
Doing the dance to prove them wrong
Is this even real? No doubt
Its bound to hit the ground

You better board the right ship
Cause sinking has never been so easy
Like a stone in this sea of strangers

This time you better watch out
Out of the line, I wont be pushed around
Cause there is one too many lessons
Far too many ways to learn
Well make it, make sense

Cant you see that everythings wrong
Time had come for us to move on
Heres our chance to take it back
Spread attack and make this world our own
Cant you see that everythings wrong
Time had come for us to move on
Heres our chance to take it back
Spread attack and make this world our own

Ill stick around and solve the problem
Only now the clock is ticking
Out of time and out of breath
Im out of breath but drowning wont take me away

Lets see how it feels (let's see how it feels)

This time you better watch out
Out of the line, I wont be pushed around
Cause there is one too many lessons
Far too many ways to learn
Well make it, make sense

This time you better watch out
Out of the line, I wont be pushed around
Well make it, make sense
