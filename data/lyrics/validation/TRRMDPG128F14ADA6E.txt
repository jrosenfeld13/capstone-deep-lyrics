Jesus, garden of my rest
Your fragant beauty fills the air
I lean and lay against Your chest
Forever safe and happy there
Eyes that flame with holy fire
I stay my love and fix my gaze
You emet and fill my heart's desire
And fill me with Your perfect grace
I love You more with every passing day
I love You more each time the sun displays
I love You more and more
Every passing day
I love You more every passing day
Jesus, garden of my rest
Your fragrant beauty fills the air
Yours is the face I love the best
Most loved - most high - dear and fair
