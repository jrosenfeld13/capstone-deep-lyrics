Anyway you're OK, I'm away to the day when you won't pray for a better day
Never say stay wide awake, be always late, for devils sake smile when you're afraid
In the gray, be a slave, everyday, create a wave, create your own fate
But you will fail, (...) lack the will, you'll be chasing your tail

Push the envelope, wild child, come on x2
Come on x3
Now
Come on x3

Single mind, wastin' time, doin' fine most of the time, sure you walk the line
Make it shine, for the dime but always shines left behind there's no better crime
You will climb, until you find you sat in grime sublime, (...)
But you decline, to the blind, I'll stay alive yeah ! I know you know that you're divine

Push the envelope, wild child, come on x15

Sometimes you feel like you're running around in the clouds
Sometimes you feel like you're living your life wasting time
Oh you're so true yet so blue ~ is it all in your mind?
Tell me, amaze me, seduce me, you still make it mine

Push the envelope, wild child, come on x4
