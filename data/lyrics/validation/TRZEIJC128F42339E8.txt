I keep on thinking that I've
Seen it all before
I can't see through the shades
It's getting hard for you to know me anymore
I'm hiding from the days

And I want to keep all of my privacy
And keep it to myself
A circle of friends in my memory
I hope they're doing well

I saw sunshine yesterday
I looked to the sky
Then I ran back inside
I saw sunshine yesterday
It blinded my eyes
It made me realize
That I'm not missing anything

I'm drawing pictures of myself on the wall
They're not that flattering
I'm singing songs that I've never heard at all
And singing out of key

Please uncle, please show me
What I should do now
Please uncle, please show me
Show me the way out

I'm scraping all I can from the bottom of a jar
So I don't have to leave
I'm keeping shelter from a giant burning star
That isn't kind to me
