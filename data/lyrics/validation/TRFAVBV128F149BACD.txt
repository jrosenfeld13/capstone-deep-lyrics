She justified it then
She may well justify forever
She figures it's the only way
To keep herself together
Something about hotel rooms and horses
And losing all her friends
And hearing all their voices

She rubs it out, she covers it over
She's stronger by far, than a war-torn soldier
She rubs it out....

She makes a little money
And sends it to the mother
She's living with some guy
Who's fighting off the sharks
She hopes some day
She'll get some kind of letter
Well you don't hold much
If you haven't got the heart

She rubs it out, she covers it over
She's harder by far, than a war-torn soldier
She rubs it out...

Some time ago, I thought that she was trying to move on
I thought wrong...

She rubs it out, she covers it over
She's harder by far, than a war-torn soldier
I'd die for her gladly
Lord knows I've told her
But she rubs it out...

I justified it then
I may well justify...forever
