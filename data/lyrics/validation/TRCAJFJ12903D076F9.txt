(Verse 1)
I'm in a new place, with the same face
And nothing is familiar to me
But theres a storm rush, then the wind starts
And its bringing out the woman in me

(Bridge)
I know that you're out there somewhere
Waiting on a deeper connection
Now I'm lookin to my left, searching on my right
'Cause we could be the greatest adventure, I'm

(Chrous)
Ready
Come and find me, I'm not gonna hog
Out the sun on my side, it's
Heavy 'cause I'm finally open for the woman
I'm ready, ready

(Verse 2)
I'm moving out there
So baby beware, because now its just a matter of time
(now it's just a matter of time)
Before our paths cross, and the sky falls
The very moment that I tell you you're mine

(Bridge)
I know that you're out there somewhere
Moving in another direction
So just hurry up and come, as fast as you can run
I've been waiting far too long, and I'm

(Chorus Repeat)

(Bridge)
Oh you, You gotta be close
Because I breathe you in and out, wherever I go
Ohh

I'm ready come and find, I'm not gunna hog out the sun on my side it's
Heavy, 'cause I'm finally, open for the woman
I'm ready (repeat 3x)

I'm ready for love, I'm ready (repeat, fade)
