Ain't no need-a goin' no further, brother
Ain't no need-a goin' no further, man
Told you back in forty-five you had better quit that jive
Ain't no need-a goin' no further, man

Ain't no need-a goin' no further, brother
Ain't no need-a goin' no further, man
You thought you was pretty slick, takin' everybody's chick
Ain't no need-a goin' no further, brother

Ain't no need-a goin' no further, brother
Ain't no need-a goin' no further, man
You had diamonds and Cadillac cars
Tourin' the world and settin' up bars
Ain't no need-a goin' no further, now

Ain't no need-a goin' no further, brother
Ain't no need-a goin' no further, man
Your money's gone and your health is bad
All you can tell is the fun you had
Ain't no need-a goin' no further, now
No, ain't no need-a goin' no further, now
