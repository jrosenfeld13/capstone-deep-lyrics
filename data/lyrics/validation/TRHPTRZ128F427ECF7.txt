Though it took me by surprise
One by one I realized
There was something I could do

I lost my way, that's what she said
Back to the 101
If we don't know somewhere to go
Back to the 101

I never said to feel relaxed
I never said to love me back
What was I next to you?

And in my mind it all goes black
I lost control of what I had
All my thoughts left one by one

I lost my way, that's what she said
Back to the 101
Back to the 1, another one
Back to the 101

I caught the 1, I caught the 1
I caught the 101
I caught the 1, I caught the 1
I caught the 101

I know I lost my way
(I caught the 1, I caught the 1, I caught the 101)
This time we'll find a place
(I caught the 1, I caught the 1, I caught the 101)

I know I lost my way
(I caught the 1, I caught the 1, I caught the 101)
This time we'll find a place
(I caught the 1, I caught the 1, I caught the 101)
