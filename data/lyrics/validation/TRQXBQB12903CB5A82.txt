If there was anything at all
That could rid you of your conference calls
Then I know I'd come rolling by
To break the surface tension in your eyes

And if we could live a little longer
And break this mood that's cold and somber
Then I'd sing your songs forever
I'd sing your songs forever

When you're finally sick of getting high
And you're ready to be back in the public's eye
Then I'll turn to you for comfort
But until then I'm undiscovered

So Talk Talk til the morning and the police come
This spot is the biggest mistake I have come
By Come by

And if there's a will then there's a way
And I know I will win someday
Even if we're not together
I still hope you don't hate her

And in the end what you deserve
Is on your plate when you are served
And the end is coming closer
So I hope you like departure
