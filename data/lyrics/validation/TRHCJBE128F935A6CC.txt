Hes a nasty one
Cant take youre number one
He just hates when you are right
Hes going to hang me high
Filling you up with lies
Dont want to have his kind around

Cant you tell me something new
Lack of talent, it must be cruel

If you can't sing or dance
This is your only chance
Tell them all what they should do
Look at that ugly face
You can smell her hate
But girl, try to report the truth

Cant you tell me something new
Lack of talent, it must be cruel
What you do and what you say is who you are
Dont try to deceive me

Do you believe me now
We have to put them down
Theyre just wasting our time
Lack of confidence, explains the arrogance
Dont wanna have this kind around

My review: they gotta go!
