[Verse 1]
Got an old dog, it don't like me much
That thing starts to bark his head off every time we touch
Sitting on the porch listening to the radio
We sing every single song we know
Even the ones we don't
When she moves a little closer
She puts her hand in mine
Oh what I wouldn't give just to stop the hands of time

[Chorus]
She's got long blonde hair and big blue eyes
I got all I ever need when that girl is by my side
Everything I love is there inside
A little brick house on the Oklahoma-Texas Line

[Verse 2]
She's got a part time job at the Tastee-freeze
She took the weekend off to spend a little bit of time with me
I got an old car we drove to the edge of town
We stopped by Old Man Millers' farm
Just to watch the world spin around
And she moves a little closer
She puts her lips to mine
Ain't funny how the good Lord out does himself sometimes

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Everything I love is there inside
A little brick house with a black top drive
Big oak tree with our names carved on the side

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh here they come
Long blonde hair and big blue eyes
Everything I love[?]
