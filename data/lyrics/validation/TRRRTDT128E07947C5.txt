I'm just a cool handed fool gonna ride it out with the sun
Now I'm to crawl through the fold and the curls of the human mind
'Cuz I'm in a world of marching soldiers and who am I?
Bullet for guns through the door and retires and it fades away

With three little colors lying in the gutter
They're lying in the heart
They're still aching from a dream
Bu' the feel of a bullet cold until it finds the hole, hey

I'm just a cool handed fool gonna ride it out with the sun
Now I'm to crawl through the fold and the curls of the human mind
An' I'm in a world of marching soldiers and who am I?
The bullet for guns through the door and retires and it fades away

'Cuz I'm in a world of marching soldiers and who am I?
Bullet for guns through the door and retires and it fades away
