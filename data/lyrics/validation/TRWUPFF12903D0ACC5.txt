Oh Temple darling, you have made my life so neat
But a dirty old death still waits in the bridal suite
And oh, I can't see around that bend
Oh, in the end they put my head in a box

And then they give me the wire
They're gonna give me the wire
They're gonna give me the wire
They're gonna give me the wire

Oh Temple dear, I don't mean to be a thankless boor
But as bad as its been, I think I'd still rather have taken more
So, as you've eased my way, my friend
Won't you watch them put my head in a box?

And watch them give me the wire
Watch them give me the wire
Watch them give me the wire
Watch them give me the wire

So, as you've eased my way, my friend
Won't you watch them put my head in a box?

And watch them give me the wire
Watch them give me the wire
They're gonna give me the wire
They're gonna give me the wire
