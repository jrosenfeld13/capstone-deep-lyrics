[Verse 1]
Heaven knows I love you
Heaven knows how much I care
Couldn't live without you
Look for me and I'll be there

[Pre-Chorus]
But even though you're a joy to me
I think you think, "he's a bore to me"
What's your thing, am I still your guy?
I"m so confused, my darling, I could die

[Chorus]
You're the one on my mind
Got me working overtime
I only think about love and you
Talk to me, don't be shy
Heaven knows I really try to love you
I try to love you

[Verse 2]
Used to be amazing
Used to make the world say "wow"
Heaven brought us together
That's how I know it'll all work out

[Pre-Chorus]
We bulit our love on a solid ground
And can't a thing ever bring us down
Back together like we wanted to
Forget me not, 'cause I remember you

[Chorus]
You're still the one on my mind
Love is working overtime
I only dream about love and you
Talk to me, don't be shy
Heaven know I really try to love you
I try to love you, yeah

You're the one on my mind
Got me working overtime
I only think about love, don't you?
Talk to me, don't be shy
Heaven knows I really try to love you
I try to love you, baby

[Bridge]
This is love that you can't ignore
I never knew a girl like you before
And Heaven knows I couldn't love you more...

This is so right (Baby, yeah)
This is so right (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
This is so right (Baby, uh-huh)
Because I love you
I really love you, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Back together like we wanted to
Forget me not, 'cause I remember you

[Chorus]
You're the one on my mind
Got me working overtime
I only think about love, don't you?
Talk to me, don't be shy
Heaven knows I really try to love you
I try to love you, girl

You're the one on my mind
Love is working overtime
I only think about love and you
Talk to me, don't be shy
Heaven knows I really try to love you
I try to love you, baby

[Outro]
