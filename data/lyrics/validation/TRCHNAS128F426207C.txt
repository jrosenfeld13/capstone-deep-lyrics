As He left is how He shall return, separating the sky
It's up to you, what choice will you decide?
Will you live or will you die?
Many things are written, written in His Word, prophecies being fulfilled
Suffering and pain for the wicked ones, but peace for those who have been sealed
Time is short now count the cost. He will come back to judge the lost
Earthquakes and famines, a world that's filled with pain
Hatred and war, the suffering begins. Earthquakes and famines, a world that's filled with pain
Vengeance and murder, the earth is at
Its end
As He left is how He shall return separating the sky
It's up to you what choice will you decide? Will you live or will you die?
