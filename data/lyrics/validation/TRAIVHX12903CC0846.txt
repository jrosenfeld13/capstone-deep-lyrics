Stop complaining you're out of your mind
You've got things some people only dream of
If you make yourself a list of the thing that you hate
You'll be living a life like you're sleeping
You're so deep into this crazy phase
Don't give into it
And Amy I know not everything is fine
But counting all the times
You fall it's changing
And Amy I knew it everything was fine
And all this all went right
And I know she's still here
Stand up straight and then swallow you doubts
Take a look at the world that your left with
It may seem a little blurry at first oh I know
But your eyes will learn to adjust it
You're so deep into this crazy phase
Don't give into it
And Amy I know not everything is fine
But counting all the times
You fall it's changing
And Amy I knew it everything was fine
And all this all went right
And I know she's still here
You sent a thousand letters home
About what went wrong
I read them more than you should know
You're so deep into this crazy phase
Don't give into it for anything
Don't give into it
And Amy I know not everything is fine
But counting all the times
You fall it's changing
And Amy I knew when everything was fine
And all this all went right
And I know she's still here
Amy
Amy
And Amy I knew when everything was fine
And all this all went right
And I know she's still here
