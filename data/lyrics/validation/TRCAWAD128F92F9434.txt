No religion persuades me but the religion inside of me; I'm alive
Tower of Babel fell for a reason - the tongues that you speak is laid of flies
You're not anointed to take up the serpent; You've backslid on all of your faith
This line to heaven shall not fit you in - no room for such a disgrace
You deserve fire

(Chorus)
Fire - set alight
Burns the mark in my soul brilliantly
Rise following signs
I am catatonic - the spirit's inside
Glory be...

(Post-Chorus)
I burn all the bridges I see
We pull in sunder instantly
Embody the laws of all hate

A latticework of psuedo-faith, why wait? Subjugate
Forcing the gospel outside it's own gate
This is and intimate portrait of faith, of believers who fear the same fate
Lead me from hell with salvation cocktails; I deny any treatment you praise
Fiction looks best when it's dipped in deceit
Of your brush arbor meetings a virulent sweep in disguise

(Solo: Tony)

(Chorus)
