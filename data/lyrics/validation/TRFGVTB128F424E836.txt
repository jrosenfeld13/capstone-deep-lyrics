When you meet a boy
That you like a lot
And you fall in love
But he loves you not
If a flame should start
When he holds you near
Better keep your heart
Out of danger dear

For the way of love
Is a way of woe
And the day may come
When you'll see him go
What will you do
When he sets you free?
Just the way that you
Said good-bye to me

Corazon triste corazon
Mira como me haz dejado
Solo y triste sin tu querer
Mira como va esa ingrata mujer
Despreciando a mi querer

Me dejo aqui solo y triste
Con el corazon pisad
