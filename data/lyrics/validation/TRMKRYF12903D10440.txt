Imagine standing on a mountain top in Utah
Seashells at your feet
Ravens rising everywhere
Their crying fills the air
It's so hard to believe
That ten thousand years ago
Could it really be
Where you're standing was the sea?
She's cried out before
Rising from her core
Now we're looking through that door

Is she going to Rollover?
Rolling over you and me
Rollover
Rolling over could it be?
All the cities are going to be
Two Thousand feet under the sea
Rollover
Rolling over you and me

Walking through the city of Jerusalem
They said it will be washed clean
It's getting pretty dark out there
No one doesn't seem to care
Looking for my submarine
A voyage to the ocean floor
To find a city lost in lore
So many things left unseen
Don't believe
We will have the final say
Cause she will always find her way
She might roll over
Rolling over you and me
Rollover
Rolling over can't you see?
Can't you see that we're going to be
Two thousand feet under the sea?
Rollover
Rolling over you and meRollover
Rolling over you and me
Rollover
Rolling over could it be?
All these cities are going to be
Two thousand feet under the sea
Rollover
Rolling over you and me
Rollover
Rolling over you and me
Rollover
Rolling over can't you see?
Can't you see that we're going to be
Two thousand feet under the sea?
Rollover
Rolling over you and me
