[Verse 1: Ms. Jade]
I don't know if it's this drink or what
That got me thinking all kinds of crazy thoughts
About touchin myself and wantin myself
Lovin' myself, that's so nasty
I wonder what would happen if I didn't have me
Probably I'll wake up satisfied and energized
The co founder of do it yourself renaissance
Girl interrupted in Southern Hummingbird
Ms. Jade and Tweet 'bout to show you how a woman work

[Tweet]
Perfect start, Oooh
It was smooth sailin, Oh
I played my part, Oooo
In this here relation, Oh
I was blind, Oooh
But I had new visions, Oh
It's my time man it's me you'll be missing, come on

[Hook: Tweet]
Ooooo, what is this feeling
It's more than sexual healing
Ooooo, tellin me to go for 'self
And knowin me I gotta trust myself
Ooooo, what is this feeling
It's more than sexual healing
Ooooo, I just gotta love myself, love myself

[Verse 2: Tweet]
Taught my heart, Oooh
To reduce it's given, Oh

And make sure that I'm listenin, Oh
With love lost, Oooh
And it looks real steady, Oh

[Verse 3: Ms. Jade]
Now I ain't never been the freaky chick
But I'm feeling kind of twisted
My shirt is lifted, all up over my head
I'm slippin, phone is ringing, heart is beatin
Lovin what I'm seein, lookin at myself in the mirror
Tell me what's the reason I'm looking to my left and lookin to my right
Now I'm focused on myself again I know this shit is right
And the pressure keeps callin me
Oops my skirts gone caressin my skin
It's 3 in the morning I keep on stallin, never did this before
I'm a grown ass lady so what am I drawing for
Give what I can give basically that's what it is
Lights off, flipping the sheets, handle my biz, uh

[Hook: Tweet]
Ooooo, what is this feeling
It's more than sexual healing
Ooooo, tellin me to go for 'self
And knowin me I gotta trust myself
Ooooo, what is this feeling
It's more than sexual healing
Ooooo, I just gotta love myself, love myself
