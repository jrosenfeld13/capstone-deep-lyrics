Tame my heart, take my fears away
Tame my heart, I'll turn to pulp someday
Saint in my home - shame on my shame of pace
Hole in my bag - complacency
Hole in my soul - deficiency
Hole in my book - where someones been
Say to me "come back" and sink in me
Say to me "come back"
Turn my night to day, save my home
Shame on my big black sin

Surround me with the King of Pause
Don't say "the meek come back"
We're gonna birn in the bowl of fools
Don't say to me, don't say to me "birn a hole"
I'm gonna kill one day, don't birn a hole
Shave my belly, you gonna say to me
"I'm gonna fake every hollow break"
You gonna look like a bird wood cage
Somebody's hands have reached inside of me

Think to myself cross nothing left to say
"Come with me like walking on the water"
Walk on me, walk on me like walking on the water
Walk on me, walk on me, walk on me like walking on the water
Like swimming in the water
Like sinking in the water
Like walking on the water
Sinking in the water, sinking in the water...
(unrecognizable whispers)
