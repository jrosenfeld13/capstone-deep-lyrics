It's a good night for my drinking
I don't wanna hear it, you don't wanna see me fall
And you don't know what I'm thinking
Just a good guess with your back against the wall
You don't care and I don't call
It's hopeless it's a big mess
You don't understand and I can't make you try
It's all stress and I guess
I've been getting lost in the sauce, yeah that's why
I'm too drunk and I'm too high

Hey let's go and have another fight
Someone's wrong and someone's right
You're my girl and I'm your guy
No more hanging up and hanging out to dry

More drinks, this love stinks
It hurts and hits that makes you cry
It's insane, in the membrane
The pain that kills won't let you die
But man it sure does try

So we go and have another fight
I'm just wrong and yeah you're right
You're my girl and I'm your guy
So I take it back, lets hit the sack and let's just say goodnight

Yeah it's a good night for my drinking
I don't wanna hear it, you don't wanna see me fall
And you don't know what I'm thinking
Just a good guess with your back against the wall
You don't care and I don't call

Do we really have to fight?
We know I'm wrong and yeah you're right
I can't say the reasons why
Just because just doesn't fly
When we're old and when we're gray
You'll just turn and walk away
And you won't have to hear me when I say
