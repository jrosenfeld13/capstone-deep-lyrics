Whoa baby
You don't have to go
Oh baby
You don't have to go
I'm gonna pack up darlin'
Down the road I go

Well I give you all my money
Then you go downtown
And you get back in the evenin'
And called me all kind' of clown

Whoa baby
You don't have to go
I'm gonna pack up darlin'
Down the road I go

Whoa baby
Honey what's wrong with you
Oh baby
Honey what's wrong with you
Well you don't treat me darlin'
Like you used to do
