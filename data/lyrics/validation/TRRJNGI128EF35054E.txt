How can I defend myself against yesterday?
Anyway I'm not ashamed of all that much, up to the present day, anyway
I took the path from Journal Square
That's how she taught me to get there
When I cut out for the matine on that Mother's Day
So why should I define myself when in a sort a way today wouldn't be today without that day
And what about when I woke up, woke up to morning rain every day?
I'm not ashamed of all that much in those squalidays between the holidays
The Indiana winter's rough. Although I still can't get enough
I took a room in downtown South Bend where I was born again
So why should I defend myself anyway? Today's another day
And here it comes while everybody's down in the dumps
And I'm pleased with myself. And so it goes, while everybody's coming to blows
And I've still got my health
