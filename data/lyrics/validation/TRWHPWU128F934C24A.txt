I'm out of breath and all my muscles ache
It feels like spikes with every step I take
My heart beats it's about to burst
This day my luck turned to the worse

There's nowhere to run
Darkness is closing in
I don't fear the setting sun
Or the twilight that it brings

Dark clouds fill the sky
My fate is close at hand
Today is the day that I die
Today I make my final stand

I fought so hard for a taste of victory
The war is lost but I refuse to kneel
I can't go back now there is no retreat
I will fight hard for all that I believe

I'm out of breath and all my muscles ache
It feels like spikes with every step I take
I can't go back now there is no retreat
I will fight till death
I make my final charge

I
Make my final charge
I
Have no fear in heart
I
Will no longer run
I
Do not fear the dark

There's nowhere to run
Darkness is closing in
I don't fear the setting sun
Or the twilight that it brings

Dark clouds fill the sky
My fate is close at hand
Today is the day that I die
Today I make my final stand
