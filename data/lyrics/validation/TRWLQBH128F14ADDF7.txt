Hey

Oh, I could sing unending songs
Of how You saved my soul
Well I could dance a thousand miles
Because of Your great love, yeah

My heart is bursting Lord to tell of all You've done
Of how You changed my life and wiped away the past
For I wanna shout it out from every roof top sing
For now I know that God is for me not against me

Oh, I could sing unending songs
Of how You saved my soul
Well I could dance a thousand miles
Because of Your great love

Oh, everybody dance, yeah - spoken
