So I'll write these words now
For you, my friend, here after all this time
We may never sing this one, it's just here
As a light to help you

When the power goes out
Like the moments you might shake yourself awake
From those horrible dreams
The only ones we never talk about

The glare of madness in grown-ups' eyes
The rage that takes the whole room by surprise
This vicious trap, the male cultural disguise
Is the one we fight against

We go, we go, we go
The one we fight against
We go, we go, we go

So I'll write these words now
For you, my friend, here after all this time
We may never sing this one, it's just here
As a light to help you

The sickness, the silence
As you hide in your room
Wishing so hard to forget you're alive
But you're alive

So the sight of broken things won't mean a pound of flesh
And the time you speak up won't be repaid with fists
Praying not to be missed
The night you ran away

We go, we go, we go
The night you ran away
We go, we go, we go

So I'll write these words now
For you, my friend, here after all this time
We may never sing this one, it's just here
As a light to help you

This violence passes for an apology
The trickle down in our society
This violence passes for an apology
The trickle down in our society

This is for the peace you never had
This is for the peace we never had
This is for the peace we never had
How do we guard the door against your dad?

We go, we go, we go
The night you ran away
We go, we go, we go

So I'll write these words now
For you, my friend, here after all this time
We may never sing this one, it's just here
As a light to help you
