Tell you 'bout a city girl
She's suprising
You never get the better
So totally amazing
Dont worry 'bout nothing
She just gotta be free, yeah
So won't you, dont you
Try to mess with me
No

CHORUS
They can't tame us
So they blame us
For everything
But I say
Hey
People dont know who I am
All they can
Say
She's a bad girl
But they just dont understand
No they dont know who I am
No, no, no

Burst my bubble
Just try, why dont you
Dont matter anyway
Im putting up a great show
Moving on up
And it feels so right
Speeding in the fast lane
That is my vibe

CHORUS
They can't tame us
So they blame us
For everything
Hey
People dont know who I am
All they can
Say
She's a bad girl
But they just dont understand
No they dont know who I am
No, no

I hear a knocking at my door
I turn the stereo up some more
But what can you do
When they blame it all on you

CHORUS
Hey
People dont know who I am
All they can
Say
She's a bad girl
But they just dont understand
No they dont know who I am

Hey
People dont know who I am
All they can
Say
She's a bad girl
But they just dont understand
They dont know who I am
They dont know who I am
