Distant mountains look like they're so hard to climb
Rushing oceans always seem so deep and wide
But it's only inside your mind
Remember that those who search will find
Many apples in the barrel won't be ripe
Sometimes flowers never open to the sky
But it's only a part of life-
Nature demands the strong will survive
We can make it

There's so many highways runnin' right up to the door
And it's up to us to choose which way to go
So, be very careful and you'll never have to fall
Got to take your time and let life come to you
Give it all your heart

Sometimes sunshine fails to brighten up the day
You see only rain and tears along the way
But it's only inside your mind
Everyone gets a chance to smile
There'll be rainbows that don't ever have an end
Pots of gold aren't always waiting 'round the bend
But it's only a part of life-
Nature demands the strong will survive
We can make it

There's so many highways runnin' right up to the door
And it's up to us to choose which way to go
So, be very careful and you'll never have to fall
Got to take your time and let life come to you
Give it all your heart
