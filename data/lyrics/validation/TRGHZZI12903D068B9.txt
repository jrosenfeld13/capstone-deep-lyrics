I've seen a million girls before
A wanting I just can't ignore
Keep on searching, far too much
Always craving, women's touch
I feel attraction all the time
Keep giving out a million signs
Been deceiving, no regards!
Kept misleading, many hearts
Run down, feeling so strange
Hold out, I'm gonna change
Don't cry and you will see
No lies, you're all I need
Really want to see your smile
I would hate to watch you cry
Run down, feeling so strange
Hold out, I'm gonna change
Don't cry and you will see
No lies, you're all I need
