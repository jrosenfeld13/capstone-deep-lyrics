Lead me down to the sea
To where the sirens call and where the waves are raging free
Sing for me, all of your sweetest melodies
And then let me drown into your arms, into the sea

Hear the sirens of the sea
They're calling for our hearts and they will have them eventually
Sing for me, all sirens of the seven seas
Take me away, lead me astray in your deceitful ways

Hear a thousand voices calling me
Down by the deceitful sea
They sing for me
The sirens of the seven seas
Their eyes are all fixed on me

I heard you call my name
On a stormy day
From beneath the waves
I watched you slip away
And I knew it was far too late
