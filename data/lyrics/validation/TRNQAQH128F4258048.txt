Burn the bridges of the empire
The kingdom will fall
Infaction of democracy
Bleed the weak and sew the eyes, of them all

My solace will not bring us down
Generations fall to the ground
The absence, the sorrow, ensue
Mind fucking the truth

Feel so far away
It's burning on the inside
I am so cold
One last breath

Count the victims as they die
Embed the thoughts in your mind
Regression of peace for all life
Man, the power, the drive, will decide

The violence will drag us down
As blood spills we fall to the ground
This world is not a slave
We must embrace

It's time to rise

Everyday more people die
From mindless acts of violence
Man will kill us all, he will kill us all
