Sit all day pissin' away my time
Looking into a crystal ball and I don't know why
Living too fast to live too long
I don't want to die but I don't know yet where I belong

I've had it better than some and I know I shouldn't complain
Though my grandfather told me once that all pain hurts the same
Your bottle is empty but your glass has been filled
Now, I don't want to break your heart but I probably will

Some are born to be good, some are born to be bad
Most did the best that they could and others wish that they had
If I could return to when I was a child
I'd forget what I learned and go back to the wild

Back to the wild
Back to the wild
Back to the wild
