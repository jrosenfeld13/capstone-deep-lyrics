I give the punishment
I take the brandishment
I am the one so hard on me
I am the implement
I am the battered one
(against? I give?) Myself to rape
I stay out in the sun
I am the one so pale

Taking it all too hard
Too serious and way too smart
Too analytical
Taking it on the chin?
Holding it deep within
Letting it hurt again
Dare not to swell with pride
Taking it on the chin

Nothing here works out
Nothing to cry about
I've ruined it negative
I killed it with my ?
Clock my attention span
The fingers of one hand
I count down 3-2-1
And start all over again

Nothing here works out
I should be more secure
Drink in the morning sun
My work could turn to fun
I give the punishment
I take the brandishment
I am so hard on me
I am the implement
