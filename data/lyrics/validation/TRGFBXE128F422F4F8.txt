[Hook: Kate Nash]
I remember those days on the road
Just staring at the whole front row
Just me and my microphone
Back, back, back, back in the day
Rap, rap, rap, rapping away
Just me and my microphone

[Verse 1: Kano]
Look, don't be mistaken, the beats are basic
Mix JD with 138 Trek
Remember the days on a 238?
[?] travel cars reused for days
We used to say
We had to make it
We can't be wasting
We needed patience
Cause who knew the youth from the basement's
Music would move the nation
It was all a dream
I used to read Rewind magazine
Recite "No Way" and "Heartless Theme"
Used to think it was MI3
The one Tom Cruise nigga by MIC
From E6 to this, Hackney to Hollywood
Tottenham to top the charts, anybody could
I don't hate I root for anybody good
I'm EH but speak for everybody's hood

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kano]
I'm a catch, look, give me a Kelly Brook figure and I'll deal with it
Give me Miss Milian and I'll deal with it
Give me Beyonc and I'll deal with it
Give me all three Sugababes and I'll deal with it
Cause I'm real with it, flow so ill
With a [?] microphone, yes, I'm still with it
From a young boy dreaming of better days
From a ghetto background to a better place
Better safe than sorry's what my n1ggas say
So I'm leaving, on a jetplane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Nah, I'm joking, I'm back on my grind

[Hook]
