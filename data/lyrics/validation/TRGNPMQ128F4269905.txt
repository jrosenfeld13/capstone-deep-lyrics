Oh I can see
By the way you walk
You're a lady
That won't come easy
Oh but let me tell you something
About the man I am
I love what it takes
What it takes to please you

Try, try, try
A little piece of my love
Try, try, try
A little piece of my love
Try, try, try
A little piece of my love

Oh you just can't get enough
You can't get enough, just can't get enough

Oh you know your moves (you know your grooves)
And you play them cool
But I'm turning on your heat (turning on your heat)
Come on now drop that act
I'm no fool, no need to play it so sweet

Try, try, try
A little piece of my love
Try, try, try
A little piece of my love
Try, try, try
A little piece of my love

Oh you just can't get enough
You can't get enough, just can't get enough (just can't get enough)
You can't get enough, just can't get enough
Look at me now

Ooh tell me honey
I know everything takes a little freedom
So good
So try a little piece
Come on

Try, try, try
A little piece of my love
Try, try, try
A little piece of my love
Try, try, try
A little piece of my love

Oh you just can't get enough
You can't get enough, just can't get enough (just can't get enough)
You can't get enough, just can't get enough

Hey face it girl
The time is right
Hey all the science (all the science)
Just keeps on getting stronger
Oh lady (lady)
We can burn up the night
Now don't you fight me
Don't you fight me along girl
Come on

Try, try, try
A little piece of my love
Try, try, try
A little piece of my love
Try, try, try
A little piece of my love

Oh you just can't get enough
You can't get enough, just can't get enough (just can't get enough)
You can't get enough, just can't get enough
(come on and)
You can't get enough, just can't get enough (try, try, try, try, try a little piece of my love)
You can't enough, just can't get enough
(oh come and)
You can't get enough, just can't get enough (try, try, try, try, try a little piece of my love)
You can't get enough, just can't get enough (just can't get enough)
You can't get enough (just can't get enough)
You can't get enough, just can't get enough
