Let's improvise, Let's improvise
We've got what it takes, let's improvise
We've got what it takes, let's improvise

Bodies in motion, hearts wide open
Minds searching for love

You can do it if you wanna. Make it happen if you try
You can do it if you wanna. Make it happen if you try

Everyday people do what you can
Hold on to your dreams
For the freedom to learn, in our time
Freedom to live and to love

Freedom to learn, in our time
Freedom to live and to love
Freedom to learn, in our time
Freedom to live and to love

We've got what it takes, let's improvise
We've got what it takes, let's improvise

Doers and dreamers, voices are calling
Needing somebody to love
The mind is a garden, let the inspiration grow
Evolution everyday, for love

Bodies in motion, hearts wide open
Minds searching for love
Seeking direction, life's affirmation
A journey forever to love
