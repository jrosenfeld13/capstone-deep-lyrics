The sweetness of the rain over my face
The softness of your touch caressing my skin
Feeling shy after your waterfall of words
Try to print them in my mind
By singing the words like a verse
-
Chorus
I don't know who you are
But you are my muse so devine
What if we'd meet
Things'd never be the same
So you will stay rain
-
The shadow of the moon filling my eyes
Your sensuality warming my nights
Left behind after your house-call 2 my dreams
Try to visualise my thoughts
By watching them scene after scene
-
Chorus
I don't know who you are
But you are my muse so devine
What if we'd meet
Things'd never be the same
So you will stay rain
-
I would surrender myself
If you could hold me in your arms
But I know there's just no way
Or I'd loose it all
-
Chorus
I don't know who you are
But you are my muse so devine
What if we'd meet
Things'd never be the same
So you will stay rain
