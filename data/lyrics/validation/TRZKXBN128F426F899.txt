[Verse 1]
Breathe, trust, bless me and release
Climb hard or never be seen
Closed off, rescue to breathe
Just bless me

[Pre-Chorus]
Two-sided time
Your rebirth can't hurt
Branch out behind
The pain

[Chorus]
Closure has come to me myself
You will never belong to me
Closure has come to me myself
You will never belong to me

[Verse 2]
Had to turn and lay down, your sting of disease
Phase you out, should've seen this coming
Go on confusing this soul
Hold my breath 'til you rupture

[Pre-Chorus]
Three days aside
Your rebirth can't hurt
Branch out behind
Pride

[Chorus]
Closure has come to me myself
You will never belong to me
Closure has come to me myself
You will never belong to me

[Verse 3]
Like a leech, I hold on as if we belonged
To some precious pure dream
Cast off, you've seen what's beneath
Now fail me

[Bridge]
Forget closure
Forget closure
Forget closure
Forget closure

[Chorus]
Closure has come to me myself
You will never belong to me (No)
Closure has come to me myself
You will never belong to me (No)

[Outro]
So breathe
