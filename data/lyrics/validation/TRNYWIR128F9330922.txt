By GO WEST
How much longer 'till the curtain rises?
First night stagefright always hypnotizes
Leading ladies never think about it
Live without it
Try to hide your fear of falling
Keep your eyes on me... I'm calling
Don't look down girl
You know you're holding aces
Don't look down girl
Don't give the game away
One more heartbeat and you walk the wire
Why wait? It's too late to put out the fire
Almost strangers.. can you stop deceiving
Start believing
Try to hide your fear of falling
Keep your eyes on me.. I'm calling
Don't look down girl
You know you're holding aces
Don't look down girl
Don't give the game away
Even when you feel you can't go on
Laughing at the rain you fool no one
If you don't want to lose what you have found
Then don't look down
Changing partners is just substitution
It's no solution
Try to hide your fear of falling
Keep your eyes on me.. I'm calling
Don't look down girl
You know you're holding aces
Don't look down girl
Don't give the game away
