You know the love I gave you
Is slipping from your hands
Cause I was born to wander
Like the shifting of the sands

They say that I did hurt you
But they don't understand
That I was born to wander
Like the shifting of the sands

They say that I will follow
Beware my heart commands
For I was born to wander
Like the shifting of the sands
