(from the day we met, you never should have let me fall for you)

I made my bed
Those are the words you said
I hate to hear that sound
It gets like this when you're around

You had no fear
You know you got me here
Into your web I fall
I'm at your very beck and call

I keep going over and over
Just what I'm waiting for
I'm deep inside and yet
I still come back for more

[Chorus:]
From the day we met
You never should have let me fall for you
You know that it's true
I have just become
Aware of what you've done to me
So please let me be

You had your fun
My mind is all undone
Your face is all I see
I've let you deep inside of me

What can I say?
You have it all your way
Too bad and though I tried
It just won't keep me satisfied

Have I been a burden to you?
I tried so hard to please
What you gonna do
Don't make me get down on my knees

[Chorus]
When will I ever learn, my darling?
When will I ever learn?
