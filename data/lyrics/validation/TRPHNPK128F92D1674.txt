If tomorrow is the day before we think it is
Are we doing what we've done before
If the future is splitting of infinities
Are we living in the past, can we really be sure
Is this the future shock

Do you recognise the symptoms of uncertainty
Are we serving any purposes at all
There is only one thing that is sure to be
And you know you can be sure, sure of nothing at all
Is this the future shock

You're going the wrong way if you're looking out for paradise
You know your future is lying deep in your brain
And you can get there just by throwing out the bad advice
Ah yes I've tried it so I know, but I'm going insane
Is this the future shock
