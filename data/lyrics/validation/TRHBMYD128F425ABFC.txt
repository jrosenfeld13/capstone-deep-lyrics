[Verse 1]
The day's last one-way ticket train pulls in
We smile for the casual closure capturing
There goes the downpour
Here goes my fair thee well

[Chorus]
There's really no way to reach me
There's really no way to reach me
There's really no way to reach me
'Cause I'm already gone

[Verse 2]
Only so many words that we can say
Spoken upon long-distance melody
This is my hello
This is my goodness

[Chorus]
There's really no way to reach me
There's really no way to reach me
There's really no way to reach me
'Cause I'm already gone

[Bridge]
Maybe in five or ten yours and mine will meet again
Straighten this whole thing out
Maybe then honesty need not be feared as a friend or an enemy
This is the distance
And this is my game face

[Chorus]
There's really no way to reach me
There's really no way to reach me
Is there really no way to reach me?
Am I already gone?

So this is your maverick
This is Vienna
