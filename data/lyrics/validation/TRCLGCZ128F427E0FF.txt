Only 21 with his whole life ahead of him
Thinking about the friends he had
Now that they're six feet under
Paying the price for a blunder
Can you feel his pain; it's crashing like thunder
But he rolls on, the gun by his side
The bullet in the chamber and the fear he can't hide
Another punk sucker steps into the focus
Making him disappear, with a little hocus-pocus
Just another punk sucker from the boulevard farm
Your mind is blind, and your eyes can't see
My silence, bred violence as I sit here on the inside
Deceived, taking for granted the air that I breathed
Names carved deep inside these time scared walls
What's up boo? Step up; check in, you better start praying, Is it your time to fall?
