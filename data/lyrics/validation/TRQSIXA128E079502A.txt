Sleep, love, be merry
Soft like a child
Your heart is
What love is
You're saved

Star o'er the ocean
The light in your eyes
Your heart is
What love is
You're saved

The sun in the evening
The red in your hair
Your heart is
What love is
You're saved

And time flows through Eden
The sands o'er the lea
Your heart is
What love is
You're saved

Your laughter, it sparkles
The diamonds of truth
Your heart is
What love is
You're saved
