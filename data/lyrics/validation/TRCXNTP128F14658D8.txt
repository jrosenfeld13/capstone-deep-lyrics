Udgement days have come
And righteous man shall stand
Unworthy they shall perish
They shall burn in fire
Hark! Words of the Prophet Isaiah
Behold! They weep
Hark! Words of the Prophet Isaiah
Behold! They weep

Wages of sin is death
Gift of Jah is eternal life
Mankind, a sinner
Mankind, you shall pay for your false transgression
That's why I say now
Woe unto you
Woe unto you
That's why I say
Woe unto you
Woe unto you
