Sylvia is missing
Dark stars tatooed
Across her face...
Tiny bruises
Black & blue
The dedication on her arm
Reads " Love & Hate"
Yea Yea

Passing through the underground
Sylvia is coming down
The Queen has lost her crown
To-day

She wants to fall
Into a deep deep sleep
So she can forget herself
Run away to London
Lipstick tainted
Powered painted
Perfume in her hair
Run away to London
A thousand cold caresses
Couldn't keep her there
Yea Yea

The fingerprints
Of strangers
On the ugly bedroom floor
Reveal the only traces of what Sylvia is for

She wants to fall into a deep deep sleep
So she can forget herself
She wants to fall ino a deep deep sleep
So she can forget her self

Passing through the underground
Sylvia is coming down
The Queen has lost her crown
To-day...

She wants to fall into a deep deep sleep
So she can forget herself
She wants to fall into a deep deep sleep
So she can forget herself
She wants to fall into a deep deep sleep
So she can forget heself
She wants to fall into a deep deep sleep
So she can forget herself
She wants to fall into a deep deep sleep
So she can forget herself...
