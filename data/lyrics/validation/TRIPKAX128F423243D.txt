Well, I have known you
I've been seeing you
I've been kissing you
Now I know I need you
So when I knock on your door
And if you're ready for more
So when I knock on your door
And if you're ready for more
I'm better than before

Well, I've been talking to you
I've been listening to you
Well, I've been hugging you
Now I know I need you tonight

So when I knock on your door
And if you're ready for more
So when I knock on your door
And if you're ready for more
I'm better than before
Motherf****s
If you're ready, I'm gonna knock on your door
Let me come on in, I'm gonna knock on your door
Put on a little light, if you're ready for mo-ore
