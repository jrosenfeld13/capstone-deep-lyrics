[Chorus]
Its hard to see
Everything I could be
Hurricanes or typhoons
Until I meet my moon
Im making waves
Im making waves
Im making waves
Im making waves

[Verse 1]
How could I start
When Im strong of mind but Im faint of heart
Got a lotta rhymes chilling in my mind
Cant keep it short like its Bonaparte
'Cause a novels gotta have an exposition
My music is my decision
Dont know me, better check the vision
Dont know me, check if youre listening
I got sobered up chilling on these waves
A-Town bred, so Im A-ok
Sick beats, what the mayos say
Try to dap me up and then they walk away
'Cause they just dont care
Laugh it up, sipping finer air
But when the times change and the change is mine
Theyll be just too late, while Im on the climb
With my people, we glow, man
And change waits for no man
Ripples all day, in the driveway
Just the fate of a snowman
But I dont know, man
Blowing up like a parachute
So cold, mind zero, call it absolute
Never ever will I melt, thats my attribute
Ill just change form when I flame on
Sniping on sight, keep my aim on
And if I get a new case and Im in a new place, I'ma still be the ace
Keeping things going
Or at least try to, as I master these waves
These rivers and waterways, they are new to me
Work of a community
Dont miss your opportunity

[Chorus]
Its hard to see
Everything I could be
Hurricanes or typhoons
Until I meet my moon
Im making waves
Im making waves
Im making waves
Im making waves

[Verse 2]
Rising up, tryna see horizons
Pressure strong, turning me to diamonds
Making waves, Im the young Poseidon
These bright lights so mesmerizing
But they can't shake me, I got future vision
I pave the way for my new decisions
I love the rain, this that new edition
Of the boy on the rise from a new condition
Called change, Im losing my shame
Look to the sky, nothing was the same
When I looked to the sea I just saw reflections
Of a young prince emulating king directions
Im a young lion, no empire
Yet building strong with this red fire
And cooling off with this blue flame
Thats Sapphire blue, if its all the same
I ain't a crystal gem, but Ill find a way
To change the world before I decay
They say, What do you want? I say, "IDK"
I dont even really know whats on today
Or whats on my brain or if Im okay
Im making this all to say
That I refuse to let my day-by-day
Be a repeat of the same play-by-play
Til I fade away, Im changing minds
Arranging these lines, exchanging these rhymes
Draining the agents that hate on design
Im an angel of time and Im just tryna
Keep it cool tryna show my name
Keep it icy tryna show my waves
Keep it warm when the times are gray
If I could meet my idols I would love to say
That you've all inspired me
Being more than interviews, resumes, and the hirings
When I thought God just might fire me
I listened to you and I just got lost
And you wouldnt even know the cost
If I told you, your chains would all fall
I want to tell you all thank you, for real
For saving me from the snowfall

[Chorus]
Its hard to see
Everything I could be
Hurricanes or typhoons
Until I meet my moon
Im making waves
Im making waves
Im making waves
Im making waves

[Outro]
You know, in the beginning
I didn't really know what I was doing
Just making things that sounded really cool
And people told me, "You know, you should stop that
'Cause, you got academics."
So I left it alone and it became like a spider in the room
That's always creeping up on you
And it's always on the prowl, it's always behind you
Always waiting to strike
You know, that thought in my mind became like an ocean
A sea of despair
And, um, if I left that alone
If I didn't make these waves
Would I ever truly be ok?
