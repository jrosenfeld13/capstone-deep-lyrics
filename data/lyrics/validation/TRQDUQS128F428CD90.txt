[Intro]
Well, well, well,well, well
Hmm, whoa
Check it out

[Verse 1]
Sitting at the light, she pulled up on my right
Looking in the mirror making sure her shit was tight
I know she felt me watching but was scared to look my way
I know she wants to look, but I think I got her shook
Under pressure, don't know what to do
She's got two cuties with her and I got my peoples too
She put it in one, stepped on the gun, and made a U
Looked inside, gave me a smile, then she blew, what am I gonna
Do

[Chorus]
Tell me which way did she go
Pretty young thing in a GS4
Love was so bangin had me open from the door
Tell me have you seen her? yeah
She had a smile that I couldn't forget
Shining brighter than the floss piece around her neck
The girl was so fine I just gotta make her mine
Tell me have you seen her?
Have you seen her?

[Verse 2]
Its been a while now, and I'm steady on the case
Everyday I'm looking for her face
It's like a dream to me, and I gotta make it real
Gotta let her know just how I feel
Now there she goes again, driving by
I hit my horn she throws her beams on high
I put my joint in gear and I tried to give chase
She disappears again without a trace
Tell me have you seen her?

[Chorus]
Tell me which way did she go
Pretty young thing in a GS4
Love was so bangin had me open from the door
Tell me have you seen her? (Somebody tell me)
She had a smile that I couldn't forget
Shining brighter than the floss piece around her neck
The girl was so fine I just gotta make her mine
Tell me have you seen her?
Have you seen her?
I've gotta find her
Where did you go, babe?
Hmm, listen

[Bridge]
Girl you seem to think you got away from me
You got me looking for you in all these busy streets
I must admit I got a thang for you
It's just a little test of all the things I'll do for you

[Chorus]
Tell me which way did she go
Pretty young thing in a GS4
Love was so bangin had me open from the door
Tell me have you seen her?
She had a smile that I couldn't forget
Shining brighter than the floss piece around her neck
The girl was so fine I just gotta make her mine
Tell me have you seen her?
Have you seen her?

[Chorus]
Tell me which way did she go
Pretty young thing in a GS4
Love was so bangin had me open from the door
Tell me have you seen her?
