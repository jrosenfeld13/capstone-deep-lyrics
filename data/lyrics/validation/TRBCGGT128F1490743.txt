Pictures of taboos
The roar of the pacita
Piano collects the siren
Of the hazard falsetto
Et l'odeur de la pacita
Whisper, whisper
And I don't understand
Losing you
Losing you
Please don't go
Howl to the best of la luna pacita
Moonshine
Moondog
Moonshine, moon fucks
Moon fucks; la luna pacita
We're gathered here with you, Cachita
La luna pacita
La muerte
I'll die, I'll die tonight
I'll die, the moondog die tonight
But no, Cachita
It can't fool us
La muerte in staggering vain
Bold and ugly
We'll just grind
'Till the sunlight leaks
Out of the broken window
And fall for the roar
And flow to the roar
Of the pacita
And flow on
Flow on
And jangle
And dress
Like princes do when they
Dance
Dance to la muerte
In staggering vain
Bold and ugly
Dance
Like princes do when they
Die

Shake-a to the middle wave
Shake-a to the middle wave
And clinch the red lynch
To superfall in real
And real as in
Adoption
Collaption
In in in
In time
Twice
Triple
Don't stop 'till it's over
The single man
He's a con
Whisper, whisper, Cachita
Don't mean a thing
Heat Cachita
Heat gives wings
Whisper, whisper
And I don't understand
I'm-a losin' you
