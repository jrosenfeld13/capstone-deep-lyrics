Had me a woman, give me all her love
She gave me her blessing, I gave her my curse
I drove her crazy, I drove her crazy
Sent her insane, like a one-way train

In my lonely bed at night wish that I could die
Hell's coming down, hell's coming down

Made love in the morning, we got drunk at night
When she was sleeping, I stabbed her with a knife
I did decieve her, I was a midnight creeper
I robbed her blind, I drove her outta her mind

In my lonely bed at night wish that I could die
Hell's coming down, hell's coming down

Feels like the whole world's coming down on me
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Pain in my heart murder on my mind
I wish I was with her, I wish I could kiss her, alright

There's no sun in the sky, no love in my life
Since I lost my baby all I do is cry
She won't come back, no she won't come back
I broke her heart, I tore it all apart

In my lonely bed at night wish that I could die
Hell's coming down, hell's coming down
In my lonely bed at night wish that I could die
Hell's coming down, hell's coming down
In my lonely bed at night wish that I could die
Hell's coming down, hell's coming down, here it comes now
