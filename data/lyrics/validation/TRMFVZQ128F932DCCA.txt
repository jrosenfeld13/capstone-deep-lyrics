[Intro]
In this needle and haystack life

[Verse 1]
The world begins with new born skin
We are right now
You're a needle girl in a haystack world
We are right now
You're breathing in the highs and lows
We call it living

[Chorus]
In this needle and haystack life
I found miracles there in your eyes
It's no accident we're here tonight
We are once in a lifetime

[Verse 2]
Don't let go, don't give up hope
All is forgiven
You're breathing in, you're breathing in
We call it living

[Chorus]
In this needle and haystack life
I found miracles there in your eyes
It's no accident we're here tonight
We are once in a lifetime

[Bridge]
All is not lost, all is not lost
Become who you are
It happens once in a lifetime

[Chorus]
In this needle and haystack life
I found miracles there in your eyes
It's no accident we're here tonight
We are once in a lifetime alive
We are once in a lifetime

[Outro]
In this needle and haystack
We are once in a lifetime
