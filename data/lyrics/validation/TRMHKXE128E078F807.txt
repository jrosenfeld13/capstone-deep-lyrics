In all this mad excitement
Isn't it fine to know
That love is real
And what we feel
Is all we have to show
In all this gay confusion
It's a comfort just to see
That what you say
Is what you mean
The words are meant for me

Let people say just what they will
As time goes by, I love you still
You are my love
They think they know us, but they don't
They never will, I know they won't
They never will

You know, I tell you so
I know, cos you tell me
You know cos I tell you so
And I know, you tell me

Every day I see your face
It makes this world a better place for me to be
A better place for me to be
And every time I touch your hand
My troubles fade like grains of sand, and trickle away

People say just what they will
As time goes by, I love you still
You are my love
Think they know us, but they don't
They never will, I know they won't
They never will
And I don't care

You know, cos I tell you so
I know, cos you tell me
You know cos I tell you so
I know, cos you tell me

You know, cos I tell you
I know, cos you tell me
You know
I know cos you tell me
It's true
