[Verse]
I must obey the rules
I must be tame and cool
No staring at the clouds
I must stay on the ground
In clusters of the mice
The smoke is in our eyes
Like babies on display
Like Angels in a cage
I must be pure and true
I must contain my views
There must be something else
There must be something good far away
Far away from here

[Outro]
Far away, far away from here
Far away, far away from here
Far away, I'm far away from here
And I'll be here for good
For good
