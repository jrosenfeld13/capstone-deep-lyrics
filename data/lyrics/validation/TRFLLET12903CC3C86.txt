I saw the whiteman coming
He gets off his plane
He gets in his land-rover
And heads from the mines

I saw the whiteman coming
Coming to steal
And to rape
And he calls it business

I saw the black man waiting
Ready to rob his brothers
And to give away his sisters
For a couple of US dollars

I saw the black nurses wondering
Wondering why
They keep sending all these white nurses
To take away their jobs

I saw Art and Tom coming
They get off the train
They're all geared up to record
And they're kind of insane

I saw the white girls coming
Coming to get
What they can't get at home
It's cheap it's fun
And it don't last too long

I saw the businessmen coming
Cheatin' on their wives
With underage girls
Buzzing around their hives
I saw you coming back a year ago
Won't you please tell me more
All about your voyage
All the things that you did
All the people you met

Now I wanna know
My blue eyed son
All the cars that you drove
All the girls you've been fooling around with

I saw the whiteman coming
Coming to steal
And to rape
And he calls it business

I saw you coming back a year ago
