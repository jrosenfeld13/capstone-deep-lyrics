He's 68 and brings my morning paper
Each day while it's dark
Then hustles off to greet folks
At the Highway 9 Walmart

His daughter moved back home last year
With their two boys, twelve and ten
Then she skipped town and left him
And his wife to care for them

CHORUS:
It used to be Superman
Johnny Bench and then George Jones
But lately I've been finding
All my heroes closer to home

Every time I see a squad car
Or pass a firehouse
I think of brave hearts behind badges
Ready when a call goes out

Seems since 9/11
It's been on my mind
How they wake up every morning
And put their lives on the line

It used to be Superman
Johnny Bench and then George Jones
But lately I've been finding
All my heroes closer to home

I've got a life I'm loving
Got some children of my own
And some nights I tuck them in and stand there
In the dark alone

And I think back on my childhood
And the sweet days that I had
Now I see the sacrifice it took
From my mum and dad

It used to be Superman
Johnny Bench and then George Jones
But lately I've been finding
All my heroes closer to home
But lately I've been finding
All my heroes closer to home
