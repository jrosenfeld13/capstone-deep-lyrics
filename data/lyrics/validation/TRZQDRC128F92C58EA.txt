Ready or not
Change is comin'
Can you feel the spirit rising in you
Has it been a while
Since you felt the fire and passion and joy anew

Are you ready for a revelation
We all know that there is so much more
We're in need of this inspiration
Can't wait another day
I gotta have it right away

*chorus*
Revive us again
Revive us again
Restore the joy of our salvation
Revive us again
Revive us again
Renew life within
Revive us again

Love is alive and exciting
If we only let it take control
Drink from the fountain
It's so inviting
It will strengthen and refresh us all

Nothing can stop this revolution
When we're determined to see it through
If we believe that there is one solution
You know his name is Jesus
He is the one to free us

*chorus* (2x)

You know we need you to revive us
And not just speak it
Let is just go on and on
And never come to an end
(2x)

Are you ready for a revelation
We all know that there is so much more
We're in need of this inspiration
Can't wait another day
I gotta have it right away

*chorus*

You know we need you to revive us
And not just speak it
Let is just go on and on
And never come to an end
(2x)
