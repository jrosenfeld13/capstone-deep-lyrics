Rains of winter have come and gone
Signs of a season's change
Winds they rush through the empty streets
No one
No one invades

Cool evenings now of days gone past
Remind me of you
Lights from times and I could see
A tear now
A tear now around me

Days are short and now and I've grown week
All the colors of summer
Happy lives reach their peak
Are gone now away
I walk along an empty beach
Walk alone today
Old man steals from down that road
It moves on

Change of a season
Devil, you maiden
Change of a season
Devil, you maiden

You people here just don't believe
These changing times
When all that dies you just don't see
That I'll turn so blind
Sky grew black and stone grey dawn
Went on for days
They (???) sun to find a way
Dead, she's on the floor

Change of a season
Devil, you maiden
Change of a season
Death of creation
Change of a season
Devil, you maiden
Change of a season
Death of creation

I'm still here far from home
(???) froze off the desert sea
I'm still here far from home
Minds hoping now on the winds of hell
Still a flame of life in me
I've lost a flower and seasons change

Rains of winter have come and gone
Sign of a season's change
I've been here now for a thousand years
Well I'll return again

Don't want to end up like you
Oh so all alone
Your travel road comes once a year
I know you wait till then

Around me now the ocean's seas
Turn black with rage
A devil's game so hard to see
You're not your own disguise

Change of a season
Devil, you maiden
Change of a season
Death of creation
Change of a season
Devil, you maiden
Change of a season
Death of creation
