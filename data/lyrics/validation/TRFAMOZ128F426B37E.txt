Be my guest, become a witness, this prosecution is now about to begin
In conclusive assimilation, you?ll comprehend the chaos within
Raise me into?

Fail to save my sanity, out of perception
Clear signs of a soul disturbed by definition
Revelations of utopia? I?ve crossed all lines of rationality
I raise distress in search of true stability
The need, the urge to soon escape from the delusion
Awake, alive ? still meant to choke in fantasies
The will, the thrill, safe in hiding? now or never!
There?s something in between? now or never!
I?ll vent the anger when the time is right?
Darkest deeds in order to attain deliverance
A narrow path unclosing realms of self-rejection
Sacrificial deceit? I came, I saw but conquered nothing at all, Nothing at all!
As conformity neglects affliction, a twisted sanity is all that remains

[ Lead : Bache ]

Now! I?ll vent my anger!
Now! The time is right!
