Welcome to my battlefields
Poison ivory sprung

I'm worth my weight in water, the southwest in a drought
If I could make it rain a year straight
Flush the desert out, flush all the people out too
Make em' move north, where the soil is dark
Away from where the day is long and the night is short
Some people gonna die for sport, some people gonna die for god
Some people gonna stay in my heart, some people I already forgot
Some people get it handed to em' on a platinum plate
And I can't understand it to em'
But they gonna understand when the card is handed to em'
Whats it gonna be like when the planet go inside a deep sleep?
Where electric sheep don't even dare to dream
Between the hipster bars, and the vegan shops, and the concrete streets
Ain't safe

We got broken strings, sore spines, stolen dr sample high
Gas no, brakes no, rolling through your town on a tank
No candy bars passed out, no credit or federali's to the back
So we can't roll down the windows

This is for my campesinos, my navajos holding down casinos
Peace to Montana the state, what-up to the last buffaloes
We gotta hold it down, cuz if everyone stuck our their necks
There'd be a lot of blood on the street

People always said I was too smart for my own good and I see that now
They say you reap what you sew, I see that pal
Beat a song out of metal, but you can't stab yourself to death with it
Don't cry little devil, but be ready to fall through the floor when they pull that lever
Maybe they throw you a line, seems like they threw you away
To those who own the world, keep on selling them dreams

And in my older years, I became an adult
Poverty stricken is seems, cuz my fame was occult
I watered them plants everyday, poison ivory sprung
Brushed my shoulders off, all that was left was bones
Now the the world can't stop me nothing, only piss me off
The soundman got beef, great Satan's on my mind
You know it's hard to dance with your foot so far up the empires ass
Still find a way to scream with its boot on my neck
But technology move faster than rap so, I'm rolling with it
Like my train was bound for Auschwitz
Bound for glory, haha
Bound to old glory, like a slave ship
And we keep it poppin', we love the music like moths to a flame to a burning home
And since the world ain't stoppin', fools should learns these poems
These words are weapons and they got hydrogen bombs
The venue's a skirmish, welcome to my battlefields
