[Verse]
You're the devil in me
I brought in from the cold
You said your body was young
But your mind was very old
You're coming on strong and I like the way
The visions we had have faded away
You're part of a life I've never had
I'll tell you that it's just too bad

[Hook]
I'll tell you that it's just too bad (X4)

[Bridge]
You're coming on strong (X2)
You're showing your color
Like a setting sun

[Verse]

[Hook]
