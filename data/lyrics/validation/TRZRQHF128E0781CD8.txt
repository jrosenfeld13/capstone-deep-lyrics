You've always been searching for something
But everything seems so so-so
Tightly close your eyes
Hold out your hand
We'll make a stand
Forget their plans
And their demands
PLAN B
They're testing you - but don't worry
PLAN B
This week I'm strong enough for two
I'm coming
I'm running
I'm burning
I wouldn't sell you anything
It starts off just joking
And then they stop talking to you
And that's the worst thing of all
The worst thing of all
Whispers more than loud enough
Try to make you feel not good enough
Try this
Don't believe your eyes
Hold out your hand
We'll make a stand
Forget their plans
And their demands
PLAN B
Bill Withers was good to me
PLAN B
Pretend I'm Bill and lean on me
I'm coming
I'm running
I'm burning
I wouldn't sell you anything
PLAN B
Hold on to me
PLAN B
No don't be nervous. Just trust in me
I'm coming
I'm running
I'm burning
I wouldn't sell you anything
