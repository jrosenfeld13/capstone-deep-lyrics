Promises
We forgot all our promises
And only keep some of the easiest
I confess I do

Make believe
However small the possibility
But sometimes tripped up by reality
Formality it seems

Now I found
Having come the long way round
I am closer closer than before
Here and now is all that it's about
Let's use it or we'll lose it

Go and ask anybody
They will all say the same everyone
Love is contagious
We are part of a chain

History
We could live our life from history
But there's no future in a memory
You'll see my love
Oh, there's no future in a memory
You'll see my love

Now I found
Having come the long way round
I am closer closer than before
Here and now is all that it's about
Let's use it or we'll lose it

Go and ask anybody
They will all say the same everyone
Love is contagious
We are part of a chain

Go and ask anybody
They will all say the same everyone
Love is contagious
We are part of a chain

You'll see my love

Go and ask anybody
They will all say the same everyone
Love is contagious
We are part of a chain
