What does it take to getcha
To admit it?
How much light
Till it shines on you, yeah?

How much did she betcha
You couldn't get it?
What does it signify
When it lands on you?

They will tell you you're a loser
They'll stone you in the streets
Makes you kinda wonder 'bout the people you meet, yeah

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Mmm ...

There's a telegram they send ya
To tell you that you won
And that now your life is gonna
Suddenly be fun

It's a piece of empty paper
It's a piece of empty pie
It's a vision of illusion
It will surely pass you by

And I don't know what to tell ya
I haven't got a clue
I don't know why people do the things that they do, no

Mmm ...
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

What does it take to getcha
As confused as me?
And how much information
Is gonna finally set you free?

What does it take to getcha
To admit it?
How much light
Shines on you, yeah?

How much light
Is gonna shine on you?
How much light
Shines on you?
