Wannabe
Yeah you
You're just a wannabe
Do you want to be like me

Dum dum dummy
Dum dum dum

Feels like a hole inside
Can't breathe my lungs have dried
My heart's a bomb
Ready to go off

A wannabe
That's you
A fucking wannabe
Why do you want to be like me

You hate yourself
But rate yourself
As a number one

Feels like a hole inside
Can't breathe my lungs have dried
My heart's a bomb
Ready to explode
Brings out the prick in me
Don't think it's purity
I stick in you
Try to tell yourself
It ain't true
