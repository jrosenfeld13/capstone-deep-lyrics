I got baggy pants, I got crazy trees
I got things in my pocket that you can't believe
I know what I want and I want it know
Fuck the intellectual mega wow

I don't wanna sleep, I just wanna fight
Fight in the night, no chill delight
I wanna stay in the bush and feel the rush
The made up drugs and petty violence

They always come here with the mega art forms
I wanna feed 'em with progressive trance storms
I got rave sticks in my ears and I've been
Sticking glow bombs on them for years

Even though it never seems to work
I have to keep on working to the deform the jerk
He's got a psilo full of crazy beats and
I am here to represent the Swedish fetus
