[Intro]
Fuck you

[Verse 1]
You took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you could now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back may as well have disappeared
For as long as I remember, you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, you're on your fucking own

[Chorus]
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open

[Verse 2]
If I had it my way I'd slit your throat
With the knife you left in back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you, I'm inside of you
I'm inside of you, I'm inside of you
And this is your world
Fucking falling apart mate, from the inside out
Everything will fall apart at your feet
You got hell to pay
Yeah, you got hell to pay
And you better fucking bow down to me
You better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees and cry me a fucking river

[Chorus]
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open

[Outro]
Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever
Cunt
