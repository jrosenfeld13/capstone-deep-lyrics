There's a little girl lives on our street
She's awful sweet and pretty
The boys stand on their heads for her
But she thinks they're all silly

She's got freckles on her nose
Her hair is light and sandy
Penelope Candance is her name
But we call her Penny Candy

She doesn't know what a nickel is
She's got no use for dollars
There's always a penny in her hand
And a licorice on her collar

She's the sweetest girl in town
The little boys think she's a dandy
But the monkey shines don't bother her
When she's eatin' Penny Candy

Penny Candy
She eats that messy kind
Penny Candy
She eats it all the time

--- Instrumental ---

She brightens up the neighborhood
Her little face is always glowing
And when she's in a hurry
We all know where she's a going

It's to the little corner store
That's awful close and handy
Then once again her happy face
Is black with Penny Candy

Penny Candy
She eats that messy kind
Penny Candy
She eats it all the time

--- Instrumental ---

She's always got a smile for you
If you should ever meet her
And with Candy on her face
Her smile is a little sweeter

Penelope Candance is her name
And she likes that fine and dandy
But if you want to see her dimples show
Just call her Penny Candy

Penny Candy
She eats that messy kind
Penny Candy
She eats it all the time...
