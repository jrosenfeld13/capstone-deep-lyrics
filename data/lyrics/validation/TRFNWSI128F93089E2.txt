With you it's always lies, lies, lies

Yeah, I know that you have lied to me
So don't even try to play now
Yeah, you said you didn't do those type of things
Yeah, but you went and did 'em anyway

Now there is nothing you can say to me
Yeah, there is nothing you can do now
The awful truth is that you broke my heart
Yeah, and now I'm going to break yours, too

You get what you pay for
You gotta own what you sell
I know I will forgive you when I give you
Just a taste of hell

Yeah, a little flavor of the pain that you gave me
A little taste of hell
Now, all that trouble you have put me through
It will come back to you

Because I know you fucked around on me
Yeah, I kind of caught you in the act
Yeah, you made a choice to take us to this place
Now there is no going back, yeah yeah

I don't want to be vindictive now
Yeah, I don't want to make you sad
But you broke the rules of this game that we play
Now it's my turn to be bad

You know they say you get what you pay for
You gotta own what you sell
I think I'm going to like it when I give you
Just a taste of hell

A little flavor of the pain that you gave me
A little taste of hell
All the trouble you have put me through
It will come back to you with a taste of hell

A little flavor of the pain that you gave me
A little taste of hell
Oh, now all that trouble you have put me through
It will come back to you

There is nothing you can say to me
Nothing you can do
Yeah, you had to go and get some on the side
Now I'm going to go and get some too

You get what you pay for
You gotta own what you sell
I am going to look like Satan when I give you
Just a taste of hell

Oh, a little flavor of the pain that you gave me
A little taste of hell
Oh, now all the trouble you have put me through
It will come back to you with a taste of hell

Oh, a little flavor of the pain that you gave me
A little taste of hell
Yeah, now all the trouble you have put me through
It will come back to you
