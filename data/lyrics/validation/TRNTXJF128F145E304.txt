[Verse 1]
Why am I using words
No more to say without you
Close the door, put out the lights and go

Late at night, in the night
Your shadow falls between us
Nevermore, I'll never know

[Pre Chorus]
There, memories are sorrow
When there's no tomorrow

[Chorus]
Sleep while the sweet sorrow wakes my daydream
Sleep while you think of me with kindness please
Remember former days
Sweet the song that once we sang
That silent parting ways
And you know
And you know

[Verse 3]
And you know, long ago
When first we made our promise
Empty words, I wonder did you know

[Bridge]
The laugh that love could not forgive
Is gone and tells no call to live
And we who look in beauty's love
Must now through all think back on before

The tears that I first cried, no more
Your love has come and gone, no more
And we who look in beauty's love
Must now through all think back on before

[Chorus]
Sleep while the sweet sorrow wakes my daydream
Sleep while you think of me with kindness please
Remember former days
And you know
And you know

[Verse 4]
And you know, when we two
Parted in tears and silence
Lost the days, the parting ways

Fare thee well, fare thee well
You that was once dear to me
Think of me with kindness, think of me
