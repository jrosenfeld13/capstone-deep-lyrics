You were sitting at the coffee table
Where you're reading Kierkegaard
Minutes later, you proceeded to say
Something that almost broke my heart

You said, "Darling, I am tired of livin' my routined life
There's so much in the world that I'd like
To soak up with my eyes."
Well, baby I never did stop you from going out to explore
We can do it all together from the colds of the poles
To the tropics of Borneo

Ba da da ba da...

Let's pack our bags
And lie on the easy stream
Feel the water on our backs
Where we can carry on dreamin'
Where we can finally
Be where we'd like to be
Darlin', just you and me

Just you and me...

So Darlin', what do you say?
Does that sound like a plan to you?
We can build our own little world
Where no one can come through
We can live in huts made out of grass
We can greet father time as he walks pass
We can press feet into the dirt
A little mud, no, it wouldn't hurt

Ba da da ba da ba...

Let's pack our bags
And lie on the easy stream
Feel the water on our backs
Where we can carry on dreamin'
Where we can finally
Be where we'd like to be
Darlin', just you and me

Just you and me...
