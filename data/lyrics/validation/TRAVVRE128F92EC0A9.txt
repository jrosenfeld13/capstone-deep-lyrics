[Chorus 1]
There she goes again
Shes out on the streets again
Shes down on her knees, my friend
But you know shell never ask you please again

[Chorus 2]
Now take a look, theres no tears in her eyes
She wont take it from just any guy, what can you do
You see her walking on down the street
Look at all your friends shes going to meet
You better hit her

[Chorus 1]
There she goes again
Shes knocked out on her feet again
Shes down on her knees, my friend
But you know shell never ask you please again

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
Shes going to bawl and shout
Shes going to work it
Shes going to work it out, bye bye
Bye bye baby
All right
