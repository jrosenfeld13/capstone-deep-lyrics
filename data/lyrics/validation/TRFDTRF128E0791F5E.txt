[Verse 1]
Never thought that I could really trust you (Trust you)
Ever since I fell out of love with you
But when I lay you down (Lay you down)
You turn my feelings around
Something bout your seductive beauty (Beauty)
Things you do that nobody else can do to me
Captivating my mind
Doing just what I like

[Chorus]
My minds telling me that I hate you
But my bodys saying (I want that)
Tried to play me on the low
Still my bodys saying (I need that)
Contagious is what you gotta be
Still my bodys saying (I want that)
All of my boys say you aint right, baby
But my bodys saying (I need that)

[Verse 2]
From the ice to the trips to Hawaii (Hello)
BMWs and Benzes with the 20s
I gave you everything (Everything)
Then you went and bounced on me
Every night I still think about you
Sipping wine, making was our chemistry (Ooh yeah)
Laying in bed all day
Ooh girl, I miss those days

[Chorus]
My minds telling me that I hate you
But my bodys saying (I want that)
Tried to play me on the low
Still my bodys saying (I need that)
Contagious is what you gotta be
Still my bodys saying (I want that)
All of my boys say you aint right, baby
But my bodys saying (I need that)

[Bridge]
Your pretty tone (Im thinkin bout that)
French manicure (Im thinkin bout that)
Youre so prime (Thats why you got me)
Sprung on youryour love

[Chorus]
My mind is telling me that I hate you
But my bodys saying (I want that)
Tried to play me on the low
Still my bodys saying (I need that)
Contagious is what you gotta be
Still my bodys saying (I want that)
All of my boys say you aint right, baby
But my bodys saying (I need that)

My mind is telling me that I hate you
But my bodys saying (I want that)
Tried to play me on the low
Still my bodys saying (I need that)
Contagious is what you gotta be
Still my bodys saying (I want that)
All of my boys say you aint right, baby
But my bodys saying (I need that)

Ah, even the preacher said you aint right for me (I want that)
All of my family say leave you alone, but I (I need that)
Oh, even my best friend, my best friend (I want that)
All say you aint right for me
