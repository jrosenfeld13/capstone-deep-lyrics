[Intro] [Kelly]
Don't talk, just listen

Yo, have you ever thought about being with me?
No, I don't mean be with me like just be with me
I mean that as in something that's yours
And nobody else on this earth can touch
And nobody else can match the feelings that you have for me
And the love that we share, is so undeniable
'cause this is how I feel about you
Yeah

[Chorus]
My lady you know I love her
Nothing else in this world that comes before her
'cause she's my favorite girl I keep her laced so properly
And yet I let her push the ride 'cause she rides for me
My lady I, I, I love her
I'll be texting her early before she wake up
When we fight I'm the first one trying to make up
Never gonna break up
She's my all, she's my everything
My girl you know she's got it like that

[Verse 1] [Patrick]
First thing in the morning I'll be texting her phone
Trying to check up on my lady
Try to see just what she's on (see just what she's on)
'cause I got something planned today
Baby gonna get fly right away
'cause my driver's on his way

[Verse 2]
First up baby we gonna hit the mall
And shortie if you wanna we can buy it all
'cause there's no limit when it comes to lacing you
I'll do whatever it take to please you, oh

[Chorus]
My lady you know I love her
Nothing else in this world that comes before her
'cause she's my favorite girl I keep her laced so properly
And yet I let her push the ride 'cause she rides for me
My lady I, I, I love her
I'll be texting her early before she wake up
When we fight I'm the first one trying to make up
Never gonna break up
She's my all, she's my everything
My girl you know she's got it like that

[Verse 3] [Patrick]
Girl you're so amazing in everything you do
'cause even when I'm down you always get me through, ha (you always get me through)
'cause you don't trip when I'm on the phone
Or when I'm rushing off the phone
It's so incredible
Baby taking trips whenever you wanna dip
'cause that's the least that I can do for you girl
(it's the least that I can do)
And I'll never quit she deserves every bit of it
And if I could I would give her the world, oh

[Chorus]
My lady you know I love her (I, I, I)
Nothing else in this world that comes before her (nothing comes before my baby)
'cause she's my favorite girl I keep her laced so properly (so properly)
And yet I let her push the ride 'cause she rides for me ('cause she ride for me)
My lady I, I, I love her (love her)
I'll be texting her early before she wake up (early before she wake up)
When we fight I'm the first one trying to make up (first one)
Neva gonna break up
(oh no, Yeah)
She's my all, she's my everything
My girl you know she's got it like that

[Verse 4]
See you mean everything to me
Can't afford to let you go
I won't stand without you here beside me
You bring out the best in me
That's why I gotta let you know
That for you girl I'd give anything
Girl no matter what (oh)
I would loose it all (oh)
If it could be the 'cause of me losing you
Yeah there's nothing I'd ever brought before my girl
'cause the love that we've got is true, oh!

[Chorus]
My lady you know I love her (you know I love her)
Nothing else in this world that comes before her (nothing else before my baby)
'cause she's my favorite girl I keep her laced so properly (properly, yeah)
And yet I let her push the ride 'cause she rides for me (push the ride)
My lady I, I, I love her (so love her)
I'll be texting her early before she wake up (oh)
When we fight I'm the first one trying to make up (first one oh)
Never gonna break up (oh yeah)
She's my all, she's my everything
My girl you know she's got it like that (got it like that)
