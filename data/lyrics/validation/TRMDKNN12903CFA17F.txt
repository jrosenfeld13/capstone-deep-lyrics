Once again I've lost my way
Going nowhere fast
I dread the return
Spend my days in this self-made cage
Where my soul can dwell
And my loneliness is thriven far to well

All and none of the answers I've found
Alone I stand on hollow ground

Too many years have passed
Too much blood has been spilt
I realize it's my destiny, my will

All and none of the answers I've found
Alone I stand on hollow ground

Things aren't always what they seem
As the scars on my skin will show
On hollow ground I stand
On hollow ground repent
The sins were mine. I'm gone, I know

Dazed and weakened by the haze
Went nowhere fast
I dread the return
I've lost my ways
Am I losing my mind?
Maybe then my redemption's there to find

All and none of the answers I've found
Alone I stand on hollow ground...
