[Intro]
It's just a stupid little love song
It's just a stupid little
It's just a stupid little love song
Here we go
Put 'em up
Put 'em up, put 'em up

[Verse 1]
Granddad fought in World War II
Your cousin landed on the moon
Your mother is a diplomat, Senator of Connecticut
Your sister's got a 4.0
Your father's got his own talk show
Your brother aced the science test, he found the cure for morning breath
I came here by taxi you came by limousine

[Chorus]
And all I have to offer you is this
Just a stupid little love song
Three chords and a microphone
Just a stupid little love song
Hip-hop and rock-n-roll
So sit right down, I'll sing this song to you

[Interlude]
Put 'em up
Put 'em up, put 'em up

[Verse 2]
You're captain of the football team
A cheerleader's recurring dream
You're on the road to Harvard law
I'm on the bus to Arkansas
I stand in your doorway your world looks so enchanting

[Chorus]
And all I have to offer you is this
Just a stupid little love song
Three chords and a microphone
Just a stupid little love song
Hip-hop and rock-n-roll
So sit right down, I'll sing this song to you

[Interlude]
Put 'em up
Put 'em up, put 'em up

[Bridge]
And the moon comes in the window like a spotlight
(Listen up, cause this is real)
I sit you down and I begin to gently rock the mic
(Cause I'm trying to tell you what I feel)
And we're truly approaching a moment
And then you lean over and say
"What's my name, what's my name, what's my name?"
Oh, come on
Here we go

[Verse 3]
Hi, is Brett home?
Well, will you tell him I came by?
I stand in your driveway
Your world looks so far away

[Chorus]
And all I have to offer you is this
Just a stupid little love song
Three chords and a microphone
Just a stupid little love song
Hip-hop and rock-n-roll
So sit right down, I'll sing this song to you

[Outro]
Put 'em up, put 'em up
Just a stupid little love song
So sit right down, I'll sing this song to you
