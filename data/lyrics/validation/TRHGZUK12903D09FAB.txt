I'm gonna fight, in the Metal night
My guardian angel is my sword
I hear the call, I see the light
I'm gonna give my life for my lord

The quest is long and the end is near
I sail away in seas of doom
My shield is strong and I feel no fear
I'm gonna face the enemy soon

The night is cold and the air is clear
The enemy could be anywhere (beware)
The serpent's eyes enlarge with fear
It's all about those who dare

Thunder! Lightning! Fighting! Heavy Metal in the night!
Monsters! Are dying! By axes! Bleeding in the burning light!

Face to face with an army from hell
A sudden flash the battle is on
So swing the axe and cast the spell
Kill or be killed - dead and gone

The taste of Metal is the taste of blood
The enemies have got their reward
We buried them in seas of mud
They've felt the rage of my sword

The night is cold and the air is clear
The enemy could be anywhere (beware)
The serpent's eyes enlarge with fear
It's all about those who dare

Thunder! Lightning! Fighting! Heavy Metal in the night!
Monsters! Are dying! By axes! Bleeding in the burning light!

Thunder! Lightning! Fighting! Heavy Metal in the night!
Monsters! Are dying! By axes! Bleeding in the burning light!

Die, die, die, killing in the dead of night!!!

Thunder! Lightning! Fighting! Heavy Metal in the night!
Monsters! Are dying! By axes! Bleeding in the burning light!

Thunder! Lightning! Fighting! Heavy Metal in the night!
Monsters! Are dyin'! By axes! Bleeding in the burning light!
