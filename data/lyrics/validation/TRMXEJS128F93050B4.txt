You'd think I was doing good
With this smile upon my face
My rent is overdue
I leave here in disgrace
I know nobody loves me
And no one rings my phone
I'm gonna get real good at, jammin' alone
Jammin' alone, jammin' alone...

There's a woman on my corner
With her rags, bags and wine
She's laughing with nobody
Beating out the time
She sees me and she's smiling
'Cause she knows I'm coming home
I recognize my sister, jammin' alone
Jammin' alone, jammin' alone...

Living well is the best revenge
Take pleasure where you can
Don't be too hard on yourself
Or your fellow man
And wear a smile upon your face
Till it becomes your own
And love your own sweet music
When you're jammin' alone
Jammin' alone, jammin' alone
