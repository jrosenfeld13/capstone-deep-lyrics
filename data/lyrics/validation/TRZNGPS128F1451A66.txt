Ive driven this road as a stranger
Ive driven this road as a friend
Ive driven this road as a slack-jawed tourist
And Im drivin on it once again
It might be cold and long and lonely
But shes waiting on the other side
And Im an hour closer to sarah in the summer
And joyfully I ride

I climb through georgetown, silver plume
The tunnel at lovelands cove/cold?
The lake on the left is a little low
Route 9 is the breckenridge road? ?
Theres a sign right below copper mountain
Telling whether independence runs free/where the weather and independence run free
And Im an hour closer to sarah in the summer
And thats where I wanna be

In the evening shadow of red butte
Up the lane from the slaughter house bridge
The first cabin the moonlight strikes as it crests the cleft in hunter crick ridge
Up frombetween old red and smuggler
Rising high on a piano bench there
And Im an hour closer to sarah in the summer
And what lies between beware
What lies between, beware

And the red sandstone sentinels rising high on either side
As I follow the eagle valley
Through the canyon where the saints reside
In mt snowmasss majesty south
And east out of glennwood springs
And Im an hour closer to sarah in the summer
Where the roaring river sings
Where the roaring river sings
