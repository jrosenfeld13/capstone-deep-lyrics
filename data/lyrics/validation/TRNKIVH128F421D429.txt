Pick up a pizza, pineapple ham
And put it in the back of a Good Times van
Well go out and pick up the rest of the band
We're gonna have a good time

Yeah Lilly of the valley, Lilly on a rug, Lilly drove here in a VW bug
Am I on the guest list, give her a shrug
We're gonna have a good time

Yeah we gonna be like an icecream cone
Better eat it quick gonna be long gone
By me a whiskey, get yourself stoned
We're gonna have a good time

Well sit on a table, sit on the floor
Act like a virgin, act like you're sore
Winner or loser they're both too fine
We're gonna have a good time

When we see you in Atlanta or Abilene
The prettiest girls that I've ever seen
Be sweet as honey girl don't be mean
We're gonna have a good time

Yeah we gonna be like an icecream cone
Better eat it quick gonna be long gone
Buy me a whiskey, get yourself stoned
We're gonna have a good time

Well, a lot of people talk can shut the hell up
Sneak out a beer in a styrofoam cup
I'm gonna start singing so don't interrupt
We're gonna have a good time

Well live in the country, live in the town
Come out tonight gonna burn them all down
Don't let the bastards get yourself down
We're gonna have a good time

Yeah we gonna be like an icecream cone
Better eat it quick gonna be long gone
Buy me a whiskey get yourself stoned
We're gonna have a good time

I said buy me a whiskey, get yourself stoned
We're gonna have a good time
