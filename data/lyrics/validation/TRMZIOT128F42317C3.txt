Hate

Beast inside wrathed embruonic breathe
The Vision's clear but you can't fucking see
Reverence raped curse this feeble being
I'm above but I can't fucking feel

Taken centuries back
When uncouth minds
Led the herd of rats

Forged black minds and flesh rebellion
Ghoulish scions sickened by thee arise
Under an aureate alluring star
Wrath lingering love entwines us
