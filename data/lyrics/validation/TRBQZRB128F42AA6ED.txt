You wouldn't believe where I've been
The cities and towns I've been in
From Boston to Denver
And every town in between

(Everyone looks the same)
The people they all look the same
(Yes, the same)
Oh, only the names have been changed
(Just the names)

But now that I'm home again
I'll tell you what I believe

It's a miracle (miracle)
A true blue spectacle
The miracle come true
We're together, baby
I was going crazy
Till the miracle came through

Now you're here
And my arms are around you
And, baby, there'll be
Dancing in the street

For the miracle (miracle)
A true blue spectacle
The miracle is you
(Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo)

I never knew you looked so good
Oh, I never knew anyone could
I must have been crazy
To ever have gone away

(Almost forgot you, babe)
I almost forgot what it's like
(Every night)
Oh, holding you near me at night
(Every night)

But now that I'm home again
You know that I'm home to stay

'Cause it's a miracle (miracle)
A true blue spectacle
A miracle come true

We're together, baby
I was going crazy
Till the miracle came through

Now you're here
And I'm feeling so good
And, baby, there'll be
Dancing in the street

For the miracle (miracle)
A true blue spectacle
The miracle is you
(Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo)

Now you're here
And my arms are around you
And, baby, there'll be
Dancing in the street

Ha, there's gonna be
Dancing in the street
Gonna be dancing in the street

(Dancing in the street)
Dancing, dancing, dancing
(Dancing in the street)
Dancing, dancing, dancing
Dancing in the street
Dancing, dancing, dancing
Dancing in the street

For the miracle (miracle)
A true blue spectacle
The miracle is you

Hoo, the miracle is you
(The miracle is you)
Hoo, the miracle is you
(The miracle is you)
Hoo, the miracle is
