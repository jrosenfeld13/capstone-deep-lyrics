When the evening sunlight's fingers stretch across the floor
Cover up your eyes with feathers softly close the door
Take me in your heavy lips take me where the shadows slide
I'm with your blind full secrets I'll be fast and loose
The lacey intrigue of this weekend should not be abused
You can take me where you want but could you take me all the time?
Away yeah, oh wait a little longer don't go too far
I wouldn't lie, I wouldn't like you keeping me in the dark
Tender is the truce I'm tasting watching you dictates
Heady nights of sleepless wasting a face I can't escape
We could wave the world goodbye to all of the boys cheerio
Away yeah, oh wait a little longer don't go too far
I wouldn't lie, I wouldn't like you keeping me in the dark
Away yeah, oh wait a little longer don't go too far
I wouldn't lie, I wouldn't like you keeping me in the dark
Help me now I'm slipping deeper tell me what to say
When without words you call me closer each time you turn away
Something inside you cries but is it something I'll never find
Away yeah, oh wait a little longer don't go too far
I wouldn't lie, I wouldn't like you keeping me in the dark
Away yeah, oh wait a little longer don't go too far, you're gone too far
I wouldn't lie, I wouldn't like you keeping me in the dark
