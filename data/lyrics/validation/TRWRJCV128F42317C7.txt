[Intro]
Storm is over
Yeah
Now I've got to see the sunshine

[Verse 1]
I was in a tunnel and couldn't see the light
And whenever I'd look up I couldn't see the sky
Sometimes when I'm standin' it seems I got to walk a mile
My heart could be cryin' dead in the middle of a smile

[Bridge]
But then I climbed the hills
And saw the mountains
I hollered help 'cause I was lost, then I felt the strong wind
Heard a small voice sayin'...

[Chorus]
The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Come on and set me free
Oh oh

[Verse ]
In the midst of my battle all hope was gone
Downtown in a rushed crowd and felt all alone
And every now and then I felt like I would lose my mind
I've been racin' for years and still no finish line

[Bridge]
But then I climbed the hills
And saw the mountains
I hollered help 'cause I was lost, then I felt the strong wind
Heard a small voice sayin'...

[Chorus]
The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Come on and set me free
Oh oh

[Verse 3]
Somehow my beginning stepped right in (Right in)
Then faith became my friend (My friend)
And now I can depend
On the voices of the wind
When it's sayin' (Sayin')

[Chorus]
The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Come on and set me free
Won't you come and set me free

[Chorus]
The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Come on and set me free
Won't you come and set me free
