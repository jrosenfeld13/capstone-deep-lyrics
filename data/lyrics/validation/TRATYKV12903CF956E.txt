Is everybody happy now?
Is everybody clear?
We could drive out to the dunes tonight
'Cause summer's almost here
I've been up all night
I might sleep all day
Get your dreams just right
Let them slip away
I might sleep all day
When the roads are clear, we'll head on out of here
If you're comin' back, I'll see you in the morning
I'm just starin' at the ceiling starin' back at me
Just waitin' for the daylight to come crawlin' in on me
And I've been up all night
I might sleep all day
Get your dreams just right
And let them slip away
I might sleep all day
Oh, it's too late to get high now
Oh, it's too late to get high now
Fix your hair just right and put your jeans on tight
Wear a dress, so I can get it off real easy
'Cause I've been thinking I'd like to see your eyes
Open up real wide, the minute that you see me
If you don't come through, I wouldn't wait for you
I understand that everyone goes disappearing
Into the greatest gray that covers over everyday
And hovers in the distance and the distance and the distance
I've been up all night
I might sleep all day
Get your dreams just right
Let them slip away
I might sleep all day
Oh, it's too late to get high now
Oh, it's too late to get high
I said baby, I'm not alone
I said baby, I'm not alone
It's too late
Baby, I'm not alone
I said baby, I'm not alone
Said it's too late
Oh, I only wanna get high
Na, na, na, na, na, na
I said, na, na, na, na, na, na
It's too late
Oh, I only wanna get high
Na, na, na, na, na, na
I said, na, na, na, na, na, na
I said, it's too late
Oh, I [Incomprehensible]
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Oh, na, na, na, na, na, na
It's too late, oh
