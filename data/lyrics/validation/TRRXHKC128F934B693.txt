Forever your eyes will hold the memory
I saw your heart as it overtook me
We tried so hard to understand and reason
But in that one moment I gave my heart away

I gave my heart away
In that moment I gave my heart away
In that moment I gave my heart away

With that perfect breath where my mind lay beside me
And all I knew is what had overtaken me
With no reason I am comforted by inability to understand

Forever your eyes will hold the memory
I saw your heart as it overtook me
We tried so hard to understand and reason
But in that one moment I gave my heart away

I gave my heart away
In that moment I gave my heart away
In that moment I gave my heart away

Forever your eyes will hold the memory
Forever your eyes will hold the memory
Forever your eyes will hold the memory

When I wake from this dream
Will your smile still open my heart
And leave me transparent?
When I wake from this dream
Will your smile still open my heart
And leave me transparent?
