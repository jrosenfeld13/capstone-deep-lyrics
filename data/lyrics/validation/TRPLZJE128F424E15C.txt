So turn the music down
I'm tired of talking really loud
I've got just one last thing to say

Let's just drive across the country
Just drive me to the coast
Let's just drive across the country
Just drive me to the coast

It's just that I'm sick of this
I'm sick of here
I'm sick of everyone and everything around
Let's just start over new
Somewhere else in a coastal city
Such a view

You won't regret a thing
It's not like something is
Keeping you from me
And you won't miss a thing
About this place, about today

So turn the music down
I'm tired of talking really loud
I've got just one last thing to say

Let's just drive across the country
Just drive me to the coast
Let's just drive across the country
Just drive me to the coast

We're almost there
It's twenty hours that we've been driving together
We're almost to the coast
I'm almost there
It's twenty hours that we've been driving together
I'm almost to the coast

So turn the music down
I'm tired of talking really loud
I've got just one last thing to say

Let's just drive across the country
Just drive me to the coast
Let's just drive across the country
Just drive me to the coast

Let's just drive across the country
Just drive me to the coast
Let's just drive across the country
Just drive me to the coast

Let's just drive across the country
Just drive me to the coast
Let's just drive across the country
Just drive me to the coast

Let's just drive across the country
Just drive me to the coast
