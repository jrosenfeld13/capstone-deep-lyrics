Serpent monolith
Exhaling cipher
Of millennial doubt
Carved in soil
Erect in myth
Memory
Of soul
Of blood
Before, and again
Reborn
Radiant prismatic
While atoms radiate
Decomposition
Of timeless space
In flesh
Through cipher
By fire
Breathe life
Where none is found
Nothing
Reflects somethingness
Through millennia
Of monolithic
Memory
