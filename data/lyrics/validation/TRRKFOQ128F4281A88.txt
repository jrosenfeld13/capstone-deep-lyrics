It all starts tonight
Tonight's the night, I guess
So let's go take some drugs
And let's go have some sex
The first time it's alright
The future starts tonight
And you cannot make everything alright
But you could stop being wrong

Tonight
Tonight

And someone's gettin' born and someone's gettin' killed
Somebody falls in love, somebody falls from a window sill
But you, you just sit tight
Hidin' out from life
Ooh, and you cannot set the world to right
But you could stop being wrong

Ooh, tonight
Yeah, tonight

Oh well, the past devours the future, the world is changin' shape
And someone's gettin' a piercin' done for goodness sake

Tonight, tonight, tonight
Yeah, tonight

Oh and all the culture vultures and all the snot nosed kids
And all the so called artists, wannabes and never did's
You claim you're not involved, but you're in up to your neck
The night belongs to lovers, so show some respect

Ooh and you cannot set the world to rights
But you could stop being wrong

Oh, tonight (x5)

Tonight
