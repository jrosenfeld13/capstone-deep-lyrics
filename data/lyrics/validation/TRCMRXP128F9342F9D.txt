You drove the road so many times
You should know from here
I fumble back a million miles
I think you should steer

If Tuesday is open I would like to drop in
And see if you could hang around
Don't want to be social
And I don't want to befriend
All you passers around

Around
Around
And around
Around
And around
Around
And around
Around

Lucky I suppose
Just you and I know
The secret will unfold
Lucky I suppose

If Tuesday is open I would like to drop in
And see if you could hang around
Don't want to be social
And I don't want to befriend
All you passers around

Around
Around
And around
Around
And around
Around
And around
Around
