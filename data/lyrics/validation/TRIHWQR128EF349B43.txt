This is where we fall from the tree
This is where the sky cowers up
Daft king of joy
You made a man out of me

This is where the glass leaves the lens
Splintering a chemistry of friends
I'll treasure you always
You know I love you
You know I love you
You know I love you

This is where we wake in the ditch
This is where our bodies say no more
Fallen apples on the floor
Picked out our red wings

So pour another whiskey out for me
It'll be the last bottle we share
As I drift into nowhere
Know that I loved you
Know that I loved you
Know that I loved you
But love was not enough
To hold my head

Can't you just feel my fingers slip
Into those ocean and sky where we both swim
Ocean and sky calling me in
Ocean and sky, I tell myself
I'm not kidding anybody else

You know I'm leaving
You know I'm leaving
They know, they know
They know, know leaving, leaving, leaving
Know that leaving, this behind
Leaving this behind
Oh, oh, oh, mmm
So I'm leaving my best friend
Just for the hell of it
Just for the sake of it
But how much I loved you
