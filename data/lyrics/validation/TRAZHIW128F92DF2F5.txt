[Verse 1]
All of that thick time without you
Has made me so thick and drunk
"And it's okay to laugh about it"
I said, "It's okay to laugh about it"

[Verse 2]
Running twice as fast to stay in the same place
Don't catch my breath until the end of the day
And I'd rather be shot in the face
Than hear what you're going to say

[Pre-Hook]
One day the wind will come up
And you'll come up empty again
And who'll be laughing then?
You'll come up empty again
There's no reason, no explanation, so play the violins

[Hook 1]
It's always funny until someone gets hurt
And then it's just hilarious
It's always funny until someone gets hurt
And then it's just hilarious!

[Verse 3]
You beat me every time you blink
If only I did not have to think
Think about you crackin' a smile
Think about you all the while

[Pre-Hook]
One day the wind will come up
And you'll come up empty again
And who'll be laughing then?
You'll come up empty again
There's no reason, no explanation, so play the violins

[Hook 2]
On the ricochet
It's going to hit you
It's always funny until someone gets hurt
On the ricochet
It's going to hit you
It's always funny until someone gets hurt
You can laugh at me
When it misses you
And you can laugh at me
When it misses you
(It's always funny until someone gets hurt
And then it's just hilarious)
(It's always funny until someone gets hurt
And then it's just hilarious)
(It's always funny until someone gets hurt
And then it's just hilarious)
