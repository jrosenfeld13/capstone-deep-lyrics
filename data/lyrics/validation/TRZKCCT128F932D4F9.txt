Oh, the faucet started drippin' in the kitchen
And last night your picture fell down from the wall
Today the boss said "Sorry I can't use you anymore."
And tonight the light bulb went out in the hall

[Chorus]
Things have gone to pieces since you left me
Nothing turns out half-right now it seems
There ain't nothing in my pocket
But three nickels and a dime
But I'm holding to the pieces of my dream

Somebody threw a baseball through my window
And the arm fell off my favorite chair, again
The man called me today and said he'd haul my things away
If I didn't get my payments made by ten

[Chorus]
Things have gone to pieces since you left me
Nothing turns out half-right now it seems
There ain't nothing in my pocket
But three nickels and a dime
But I'm holding to the pieces of my dream...
