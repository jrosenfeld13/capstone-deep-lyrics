[Verse 1]
O holy night! The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Saviour's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks, a new and glorious morn

[Chorus]
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
O night divine, oh night when Christ was born;
O night divine, oh night, oh night divine

[Break]
(Ohh)
Ohh yeah

The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger
In all our trials born to be our friend

[Chorus]
