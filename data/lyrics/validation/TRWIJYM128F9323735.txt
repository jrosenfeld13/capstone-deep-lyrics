She was crying since a long long time ago
She had the child he'll never know
She knew love until it got a little slow
And why he left she'll never know

And in a lonely tenement
???
She had no way to pay her rent
And all her money had been spent
She couldn't get a compliment
???
In a lonely tenament
A lonely tenament

In a lonely union hall
He's waiting for some work to call
Waiting for his raise to fall
Got his ass against the wall
He's giving them his all and all
They're expecting for him to crawl
In a lonely hall
A lonely tenement

Well there were times when his work came easily
When he could stand up and feel free
He even dreamed of raising a family
Something that now will never be

Well in a bar in her neighborhood
She remembers when it was good
Or was it that she understood
All her crummy neighborhood
She'd buy a round if she only could
??? drink it if she only would
In a bar in her neighborhood
A lonely neighborhood
A loney tenement

Looks at her life and wonders where did it all go
She'll never know
