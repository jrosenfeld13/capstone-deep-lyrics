Where will you go, my love
After tonight, my love
Who will you lean upon?
When the night, it circles you in, my love
Wish I knew what to save you from
I'd come around just now, if you need talking to
You sound so uptight, my love
If I was wrong all along
Should I hold on to you?
When did I lose your love?
At what point did you choose, my love
I'm not sure what I'm looking for
But it used to be in that smile of yours
Wish I knew what to save you from
I'd come around just now, if you need talking to
You sound so uptight, my love
If I was wrong all along
Should I hold on to you?
Wish I knew what to save you from
I'd come around just now, if you need talking to
You sound like you're with someone
If I was wrong all along
I'm sure somebody knew
