I'm a guitar king
Sing the blues everywhere I go
Lord, have mercy now
I'm a guitar king
Sing the blues everywhere I go

I'm 'on sing these blues
'Till I get back to in yo' territory

Now, my mama told me
Son, you 'most to old
Now, my mama told me
Son, you 'most to old

I won't forget
You gotta a sow

But that ain't none-a yo' business
Keep it to yo'self
That ain't none-a yo' business
Keep it to yo'self

Don't you tell yo' kid, man
Please don't tell nobody else

Now, I went to my baby's house
Now-now, knocked upon her door
Went to my baby's house
Knocked upon her door

What did she say?
She had a nerve to tell me
That she didn't want me no more

I said, "That's alright, babe
Anyway you do"
That's alright
Most an-ol-way you do

If you mistreat poor Tommy
I swear it's comin' back home to you

It's a cryin' pity
Lowdown, dirty shame
It's a cryin' pity
An a cryin' lowdown, dirty shame

Crazy 'bout a married woman
Afraid to call her name
