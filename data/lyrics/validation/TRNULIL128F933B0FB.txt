There's a hundred bluebirds
Up above the clouds
Putting all the color in the sky
And twice as many teardrops
There to wash it down
Every one's another lullaby
But there's only one and only
Who could go and leave me lonely

There's a world of trouble
Trying to take its turn
I can hear it shaking underground
And half a dozen lessons
I might never learn
Not until them troubles come around
But there's only one and only
Who could go and leave me lonely

There's a mile of blacktop
Where the road begins
It takes a time or two to recognize
Growing at the roadside
Scattered by the wind
Are everybody's unsaid sad goodbyes
But there's only one and only
Who could go and leave me lonely

But there's only one and only
Who could go and leave me lonely
