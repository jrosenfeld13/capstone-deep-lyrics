The bait - the prey - the mice
Debate the method of demise
Debate your high
I'll lie beside you, walk you down
And lay the beat beneath your bed
Beneath the dead
Debate the method in your head
The chemical misanthropy saving you from blame

I'll stand below you, lift you up, increase the pain
I'll stand below you, lift you up, increase the pain

I want to see you, hear your voice regret the choice
Rejoice in watching you collapse
Destroy the map falling headlong into the gap

Swallow poison, swallow the bait
Swallow poison, swallow every word
Said to free you from blame
I'll stand below you, lift you up, increase the pain
I'll stand below you, lift you up, increase the pain

I want to see you, hear your voice regret the choice
Rejoice in watching you collapse
Destroy the map falling headlong into the gap
The hunter dying in his trap
The hunter dying in his trap
The hunter dying in his trap
The hunter... dead

Swallow poison, swallow the bait
Swallow poison, swallow every word
Hook, line and sinker
