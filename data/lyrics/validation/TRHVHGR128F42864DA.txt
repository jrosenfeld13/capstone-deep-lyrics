[Intro]
We need to interrupt this program
To bring you a special bulletin
To the Russian and the American

[Hook]
Hey
Go tell the Russians to cool it off
And tell Americans cool it off
Don't ya juggle with life, boss
Are ya listening me?
But tell the Russians to cool it off
And tell Americans cool it off
Don't ya juggle with life, boss
Are ya listening me?

[Verse 1]
You must be saying, "Who the hell is he?"
Is he a spy or a refugee?
But I'm just a youth from a shanty town
Come-a, come-a, come-a, giving a crucial sound

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Gentleman, gentleman stand at ease
Here is some bread, now pass the cheese
It's as easy as ABC
Yo, yo, yo, a take it easy with me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You must be saying, "Who the hell is he?"
Now is he a spy or a refugee?
But I'm just a youth from a country town
Come-a, come-a, come-a, giving a crucial sound

[Hook]
Telling the Russians to cool it off
And tell Americans cool it off
Don't ya juggle with life, boss
Are ya listening me?
Go tell the Russians to cool it off
And tell Americans cool it off
Put down your guns and run fast
Are ya listening me?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

[Outro]
Hey
Go tell the Russians to cool off
And tell Americans cool off
Don't ya juggle with life, boss
Are ya listening me?
Cool off, cool off
