(lee, wagon)

You drive me ape
You big gorilla
You drive me ape, ape
I wanna tell ya

Swinging around from every town to town
I swing around and I never come down
City is a jungle now this is it
Every time I look at you I go ape shit

Chorus

Cruising through the trees
With the birds and the bees
Baby, baby monkey, I ain't so hard to please
Cruising through the trees
With the birds and the bees
Baby, baby monkey, you won't get no disease

Lead

Chorus
