Time and again I dream about you
I haven't seen you for so long
Time and again I dream about you
I dream about you time and time again
I remember your arms around me
I remember your kisses too
I remember your arms around me
Time and again I dream of you
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Wherever you are
I hope you are happy and
I hope my heart is being good
Time and again I dream about you
I dream of you time and again
Do you ever think about me
Do you ever think of me
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Wherever you are
I hope you are happy and
I hope my heart is being good
