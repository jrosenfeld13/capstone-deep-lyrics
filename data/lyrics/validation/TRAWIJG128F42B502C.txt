[Verse 1]
You are the moonlight, I am the stars
Together we light up the night
You are the passion, I am the flame
We are both one and the same
I am the taker, you are the chance
This is the rule of romance
I am the seeker, you are the find
Together we are two of a kind

[Chorus]
Two hearts, one love beating together
I am yours, you are mine
Two hearts, one love always forever
Standing the test of time

[Verse 2]
I can be happy, you can be sad
Together things aren't so bad
You are the sailor, I am the sea
The treasure of eternity

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Here we are the two of us
Nothing in our way
Wanting you, wanting me
Everyday

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You are the passion, I am the flame
We are both one and the same

[Chorus][x2]
