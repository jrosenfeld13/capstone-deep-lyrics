Dont teach me about politics and government
Just tell me who to vote for
Dont teach me about truth and beauty
Just label my music
Dont teach me how to live like a free man
Just give me a new law
I dont wanna know if the answers arent easy
So just bring it down from the mountain to me

I want a new law
I want a new law
Gimme that new law

Dont teach me about moderation and liberty
I prefer a shot of grape juice
Dont teach me about loving my enemies
Dont teach me how to listen to the Spirit
Just give me a new law
I dont wanna know if the answers arent easy
So just bring it down from the mountain to me

I want a new law
I want a new law
Gimme that new law

Whats the use in trading a law you can never keep
For one you can that cannot get you anything
Do not be afraid
Do not be afraid
Do not be afraid
