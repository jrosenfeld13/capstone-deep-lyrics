Hey Chico
Can you feel it
Ah yeah ah ah oh
Hey Chico
Ooooh
Aah na na na

The rhythm makes you wanna dance
Wanna dance, wanna dance
The rhythm makes you wanna dance
Wanna dance, wanna dance

Can you feel the rhythm
Can feel the rhythm

There is no fancy house of music
You can't escape you have to move
We don't stand still we just imagine
This mystic house this perfect groove
Turn around (Turn around)
Feel the music's beat
Turn around (Turn around)
Feel the magic hymn
Take my hand (Take my hand)
Just come with me
Take my hand (Take my hand)
Where the rhythm will be

Ooooh
Aaah na na na
I feel music

The rhythm makes you wanna dance
Wanna dance, wanna dance
The rhythm makes you wanna dance
Wanna dance, wanna dance

Let's come together to the place
Where house is jammin' please come here
The ... rhythm burning with your body
I love this music you will see
Look around (Look around)
You may lose control
Look around (Look around)
There in your soul
Come with me (Come with me)
Get into the move
Come with me (Come with me)
And you'll feel free

Ooooh
Aaah na na na
Ah yeah ah ah oh
Aaah na na na
I feel music

The rhythm makes you wanna dance
Wanna dance, wanna dance
The rhythm makes you wanna dance
Wanna dance, wanna dance

Can you feel the rhythm
Can you feel the rhythm

The rhythm makes you wanna dance
Wanna dance, wanna dance
The rhythm makes you wanna dance
Wanna dance, wanna dance

Dance !

I'm in the music, I'm in the song
Let the rhythm move you all night long
I'm in the music, I'm in the song
Let the rhythm move you all night long
