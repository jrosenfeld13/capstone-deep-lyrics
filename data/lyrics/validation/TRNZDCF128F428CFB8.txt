I lay awake the whole night trough
With the memory
The memory of you
The memorys of walks we used to take
The memorys of moonlight on the lake
The memory of violets in the spring
The memorys of songs we used to sing
The memory of dancing close to you
The memorys of candle light for two
The memorys of lips that used to thrill
The memorys of tears of heart break him
I lay awake the whole night rough
With the memory
The memory of you
I remember the walks we used to take
I remember the moonlight on the lake
I remember the violets in the spring
And the songs we used to sing
The memory of counting stars at night
The memorys of arms that held me tight
The memory of your last valentine
The memory of love that once was mine
I lay awake the whole night trough
With the memory
The memory of you
The memory of you
The memory of you
The memory of you
