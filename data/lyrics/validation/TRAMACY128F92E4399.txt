I saw a girl across the street
Looked like someone off tv
She was fit and dress to be's and had me falling to my knee's
The way she walked
Her lipstick smileand everything about her style
It toxicates it factuates
I've got a feeling she'll drive me wild

Girls just like you rock my world
Thats how i like it yeah
Sexy crazy drives you girls, and that how i like it yeah

She so hot, a fashion queen, like something out of a magazine
The way she flirts, i can't resist
Her rockstar image with a twist
Her attitude is off the dial you can see if from a mile
It toxicates it factuates

Girls just like you rock my world
Thats how i like it yeah
Sexy crazy drives you girls, and that how i like it yeah
Girls just like you rock my world
Thats how i like it yeah
Sexy crazy drives you girls, and that how i like it yeah

Girls just like you rock my world
Thats how i like it yeah
Sexy crazy drives you girls, and that how i like it yeah
Girls just like you rock my world
Thats how i like it yeah
Sexy crazy drives you girls, and that how i like it yeah
