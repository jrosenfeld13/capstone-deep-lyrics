[Chorus]
When you got a good friend
That will stay right by your side
When you got a good friend
That will stay right by your side
Give her all your spare time
Love and treat her right

[Verse]
I mistreated my baby
And I can't see no reason why
I mistreated my baby
And I can't see no reason why
Any time I think about it
I just wring my hands and cry

Wonder could I ever apologize
Or would she sympathize with me?
Would she sympathize with me?
She's a brown-skin woman
Just as sweet as a girlfriend can be

Babe, I may be right or wrong
Babe, it's your opinion
Well, I may be right or wrong
Watch your close friend, baby
Then your enemies can't do you no harm

[Chorus]
