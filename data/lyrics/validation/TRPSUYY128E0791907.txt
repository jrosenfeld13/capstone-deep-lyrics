M.C.:
I know what you're thinking
You wonder why I chose her
Out of all the ladies in the world
That's just a first impression
What good's a first impression
If you knew her like I do
It would change your point of view-

If you could see her
If you could see her thru my eyes
You wouldn't wonder at all
If you could see her thru my eyes
I guarantee you would fall
(Like I did)
When we're in public together
I hear society moan
But if they could see her thru my eyes
Maybe they'd leave us alone

How can I speak of her virtues?
I don't know where to begin
She's clever, she's smart, she reads music
She doesn't smoke or drink gin
(Like I do)
Yet when we're walking together
They sneer if I'm holding her hand
But if they could see her thru my eyes
Maybe they'd all understand...

Why don't they leave us alone?

(Spoken)
Ladies and Gentlemen, I ask you
Is there a crime to fall in love?
Can one ever choose where our heats lead us?
All we as is 'Ein bichen Verstndnis', a little understanding!

(Sung)
Oh, I understand your objection
I grant my problem's not small;
But if you could see her thru my eyes
She wouldn't look Jewish at all!
