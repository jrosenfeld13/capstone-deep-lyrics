Never too busy, I'm never too busy for you babe, never too busy
I've got things on my mind
I'm not too busy for you, I'm not too busy
If you're feeling alone
I'm not too busy for you, I'm not too busy

Girl when we first started we were spending all our time together in love
Now we're growning on and you're afraid of losing me, don't be
I've got a heart full of love even though I might not show it
Girl it's you I dream of and just so you know it
You have my attention, anything you need at all
I'll be there when you call me

(Chorus 1)
I've got things on my mind, takin' my time, but I'm...
I'm not too busy for you, I'm not too busy
If you're feeling alone, just pick up the phone, 'cause I...
I'm not too busy for you, I'm not too busy

We used to dream that one day we'd have everything we want
But now that things are movin', I hope that we don't move apart
You still have my heart
I've got so much to do, but girl it doesn't matter
But when it comes down to you I can't think of nothing better
Every time I'm stressin', I find that it's a blessin' to
To be hearin' from you

(Chorus 2)
I've got things on my mind, takin' my time, but I'm...
I'm not too busy for you, I'm not too busy
If you're feeling alone, pick up the phone and call me, 'cause I...
I'm not too busy for you, I'm not too busy

Whenever you need me

(Chorus/Vamp out)
