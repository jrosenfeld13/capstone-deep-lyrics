(Tim Mensy/Tony Haselden)

We came here to get away
Hopin' paradise could save our love
Breathe some life back into us
But it's 98 degrees and still
I can't seem to shake this chill inside
There's a distance in your eyes
I tried
To wake old feeling 'neath the moon and stars
If I could
I would send a post card to your heart

Wish you were here
We're lying face to face
Wish you were here
You'd really love this place
Wish you were here
We've come all this way and left you behind
Heart, without you love is blind
Wish you were here

For love's sake you try to smile
But your heart's a million miles away
Oh, and mine's about to break
But I won't give up 'cause I believe
Love is still alive in me and you
Together we can pull it through
Let go
We can leave our doubts here in the dark
Hold on
We will send this message to your heart

Wish you were here
We're lying face to face
Wish you were here
You'd really love this place
Wish you were here
We've come all this way and left you behind
Heart, without you love is blind
Wish you were here

Wish you were here
Wish you were here
Wish you were here
Wish you were here....
