(Rock H Bomb Rock)
One more time
(Rock H Bomb Rock)
What you want, you lost your mind?
(Rock H Bomb Rock)
Every single day
(Rock H Bomb Rock)
All my baby want to say
(Rock H Bomb Rock)
Is, "Daddy, get this to a rockin' place"
(Rock H Bomb Rock)

Oh we rock in the mornin'
(Rock H Bomb Rock)
Rock in the night
(Rock H Bomb Rock)
Rock every day by the north star light
(Rock H Bomb Rock)
She's my baby
(Rock H Bomb Rock)
All that love like gravy
(Rock H Bomb Rock)
Tell me, tell me
(Rock H Bomb Rock)
Do you feel the same?
(Rock H Bomb Rock)

I said rock, rock and rock
Rock baby rock
Rock baby rock
Rock baby rock
Tell me, do you feel that rockin' bomb
Oh yeah, let's rock

All that lollipop mama
Fanny Brown
Got a lotta jazz in every town
I'm your baby
And I feel that gravy
Tell me tell me
Do you feel the same?

Well we rock, rock and rock
Rock, rock and rock
Rock baby rock
Tell me when to stop
I feel it, feel that rockin' bomb
