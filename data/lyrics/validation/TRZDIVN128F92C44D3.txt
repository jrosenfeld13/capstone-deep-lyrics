Paroles de la chanson The war of the gods :
The time has come, for bad things to end
The time has come, for life to begin
The time has come for the war of the gods

Lucifer, oh lucifer
God of evil, you're the god of hate
We see you every day
Father of the light
Your main man died
When the light shines
You're running on
The darkness is where you find your light
Master of tricks,the master of pain
I said;
You're the one, you're the one who has a chain
Lucifer, Satan, the devils your name
Do you have the time to get your army ready
You know love conquers all
Will you stand, will you stand
Or will you fall
The time has come
For bad things to leave
The time has come
For life to begin
The time has come
For the war of the gods

God is just a title
It's like calling somebody father
Preacher,president or general
Allah, Buddha, Hare Krishna
Jehova, just to mention a few
Some people even call Jesus god too

Love, peace, and eternal light
Is your reward
To anyone
Who knocks on your doors

There's only one God that's true

You know
His name is not the same
One day the people of the world
Will know * ? * His name
You are the Strong
And you are The Mighty
I hope I?m with you
When they start the firing
The war of the gods

Love, peace, and eternal life
That's what I want
Love, peace, and eternal life
Is what I want

God, God
You are The Strong
And you are The Mighty
I hope I am with you
When they start the firing
God !

Lucifer
Say, is the devil your name?
Have you had time
To know?the christians?(whispered)

Lucifer, god of evil
Hey, we see you everyday:
The father of the life
He knows you start to running high

The father did well, did well
Is where, is where
Did well
Gotta talk ?bout the things you find
Of your life

G-d, G-d I know it

Lucifer, lucifer, lucifer, lucifer

G-d treated you this way
?cause you didn?t pay your rent

G-d, He sent you out of heaven
?cause you didn?t pay your rent. (Repeat)
And He is The Strong
He is The Mighty?
