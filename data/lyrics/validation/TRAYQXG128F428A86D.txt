Well I've got a couple things to say about a guy and a girl
They met a few months back at a coffeehouse
He said, "I like that dress that you're wearing
Why don't you just let me take you home tonight?"

I know you've heard it all before
And everyone makes mistakes these days
Hey, nobody's perfect
But the choices that you make may involve someone else

Well I met a girl I thought I loved but, unfortunately
I guess I didn't take the time to get to know that girl
Before I made a lot of choices
That I wasn't prepared to make

If you think you've found that one
That you really love
Make sure they love you back
