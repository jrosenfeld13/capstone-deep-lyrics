You hide your tears so well
I can't tell if you've been cryin'
But it ain't that hard to tell
Inside your heart is dyin'
And if I could change the world
I hope you'll be there to guide me
Through power and vision
And all the indecision
It's a crime you hurt all the time
Wipe wipe them away

You hide your fears so well
No visible anxiety
Bid them a fond farewell
Welcome to soul sobriety

And if I could change the world
I hope you'll be there to stop me
'Cause I don't profess to
Know what's best for me and for you
It's just a notion I had
Wipe wipe them away

So why cry your life away
Wait for a sunny day
Why cry your life away
There is tomorrow
So why cry your life away
Wait for a sunny day
Why cry your life away
There is tomorrow

So why cry your life away
Wait for a sunny day
Why cry your life away
There is tomorrow

You hide your tears so well
Why cry your life away, why cry
You hide your tears so well
Why cry your life away, why cry
