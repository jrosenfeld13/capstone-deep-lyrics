I'm too far down this time
I've crossed that line too many times
So leave me behind
I'll let my failures speak
For itself, I'm weak and always tired
It's time to retire

But I've seen the way you come and go, you're like a ghost
Only when everyone's away do you come close
And I saw you leave a shadow there
And I couldn't but help and stare
And wonder is there something in the air?

I felt that salty breeze
When you said to me
"Show me the world
I'll see the world,"
And I'm starting to feel like you
So I'll say it too
"Show me the world
I'll see the world,"

And I saw you fall into the sand beneath the trees
And I saw you sitting up and staring at your knees
And I saw the waves arrive in pairs, through the sand into your hair
And wondered is there something in the air?

And I saw you leave a shadow there
And I couldn't help but stare
And wonder is there something in the air?
And wonder is there something in the air?
