A darkened highway seemed like just the place tonight

Thought I was such an easy target at first sight

[Chorus:]
Now all your plans have come undone

Here's my advice

Boy you better think twice

Before you take my money and run

Cause it's a long way down and you're staring at the barrel of a gun!

You would take all I got I'm left for dead alone

You leave me here to rot 'til vultures pick my bones

[Chorus]
A sweet taste of your worst nightmare awake

I'll give you one last chance don't put your life at stake

Now take a long look at this spanish twilight

And say all your prayers cause this may be

The last breath you take

[Chorus]
