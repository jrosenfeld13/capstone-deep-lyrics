[Verse 1]
She sat all alone on a bus out of Beaumont
The courage of just eighteen years
A penny and quarter were taped to a letter
And Momma's goodbye in her ears

[Verse 2]
She watched as her high school faded behind her
And the house with the white picket fence
Then she read the note that her momma had wrote
Wrapped up with 26 cents

[Chorus]
When you get lonely, call me
Anytime at all and I'll be there with you, always
Anywhere at all
There's nothing I've got that I wouldn't give
And money is never enough
Here's a penny for your thoughts
A quarter for the call
And all of your momma's love

[Verse 3]
A penny and quarter buys a whole lot of nothing
Taped to an old wrinkled note
And when she didn't have much she had all Momma's love
Inside that old envelope

[Chorus]
When you get lonely, call me
Anytime at all and I'll be there with you, always
Anywhere at all
There's nothing I've got that I wouldn't give
And money is never enough
Here's a penny for your thoughts
A quarter for the call
And all of your momma's love

[Bridge]
Oh it's been years since Momma's been gone
But when she holds the coins
She feels her love just as strong

[Chorus]
When you get lonely, call me
Anything at all and I'll be there with you, always
Anywhere at all
There's nothing I've got that I wouldn't give
And money is never enough
Here's a penny for your thoughts
A quarter for the call
And all of your momma's love

[Tag]
Here's a penny for your thoughts
Quarter for the call
And all of your momma's love
