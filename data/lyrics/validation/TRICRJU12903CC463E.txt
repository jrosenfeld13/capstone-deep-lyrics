Sitting a chair in my own mind
Watching the trees that pass me by
Looking for my other side of life
To help me to find a lullaby

Feel no sorrow
Lover, i need to cover your feet

Trying to remember just a face
Did i ever try to find a place?
But looking back... my hands were tied
Trying to hear this lullaby

Feel no sorrow
Lover, i need to cover your feet

I dont know where the river is going to take us
But I know that i am sure that
I want to travel with you

Feel no sorrow
Lover, i need to cover your feet
