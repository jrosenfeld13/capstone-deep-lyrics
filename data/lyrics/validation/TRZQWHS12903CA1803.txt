Oh what a face, too many nights
Too many loose ends, you're tearing up
You had your friends last night
But they're all scurry
You didn't wanna feel alright
Too many weekends, you're burning up
You told a lie last night
But who's to worry?
So what a feel, or I don't know
Just like rash hands, jacking off
A callous ecstacy, Oslo fade-out
Oh, you're going down, falling now under pressure
Oh, you're passed out, falling out of sleep last night
Oh, you're not that fun, take a long hard look at yourself
Now this is it, you're spent like change
Too many eyes, too many lights
Too many loose ends, you're tearing up
You hurt yourself last night
Falling in love in a hurry
Oh what a wonderful waste of time
Too many weekends, are burning up
A callous ecstasy, Oslo fade-out
Oh, you're going down, falling now under pressure
Oh, you're passed out, falling out of sleep last night
Oh, you're not that fun, take a long hard look at yourself
Now this is it, you're spent like change (2x)
