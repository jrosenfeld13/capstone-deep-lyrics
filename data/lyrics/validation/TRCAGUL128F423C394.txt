Take the long drive home
It's time to bid farewell to those you'll leave behind
I know it's hard but you have got to do it
It's time to go and make it on your own

Highway signs lit by headlights
200 miles more under this moonlit summer sky
On a path to new found happiness

I'll drive out memories, the evening air keeping me awake
Those I leave behind only make room for more to be made

Heavy eyes, broken white lines
The thought of her still restless in your mind
I know it's hard but you have got to do it
Steady now, your dreams are impending

Overdrive on an uphill climb
30 minutes more until I'm free from all your lies
If you love it, let it go
That's what they say

I'll drive out memories, the evening air keeping me awake
Those I leave behind only make room for more to be made

I need this now more than I ever did
As the stereo Bleeds American
I drive the 405 it's now past midnight
And it all makes perfect sense

I'll drive out memories, the evening air keeping me awake
Those I leave behind only make room for more to be made
