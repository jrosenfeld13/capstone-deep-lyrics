It's almost Christmas
What do I do
Where do I go
Don't want to be alone
For all I've said
What do I know?
What do I know?
Now that the TV's gone
I can see why you placed it there
Weeks just keep rolling by
Still look to see the glare
It's easy to hold it back
Easy to just move on
Convince yourself not to care
Hope strength might come along
It's almost Christmas
What do I do
Where do I go
Don't want to be alone
For all I've said
What do I know?
What do I know?
Now that there's snow outside
It's reason to think aloud
Pride tends to eat me up
Pride doesn't mean I'm proud
I believe that there is more to this
Believe that true love waits
I believe someone put me here
Believe they might take me away
But it's almost Christmas
What do I do
Where do I go
I Don't want to be alone
For all I've said
What do I know?
What do I know?
