Seek within your own kind of depths
And tell me the tales of your thousand lies
Yet, I have withered, but I've grown again
And designed my own blackness to judge

For as we all are awake of this suffering pain
It drowns in this planet's mortality
Grand changing cosmos offers to man in itself
Myths greater that those unexplored
If the light, will seem as dark as the day;

Even though my dreams were laid down for ashes
And the fates never were stated, nor told

Even then I will allow myself the treasures of existence...

Related with my own balance of knowledge
I am divined from the pain and the pleasure
Which has been gained from...
All thoughts and memories
(from thoughts and memories described)
As I feel the Divinity of wisdom
Float inside the veins
Of my earthly visions
I am me. Master, but not divine

"I am not trying to give you ideals - or to tell you to become this and that
Simplified, I am only trying to help convince you to see that you're already
Everything you ever needed to be. Just let go off all you yearning, all
Longing, all ambitions concerning being someone else, so that you can only
Become what you really are. I do not wish to carry you away from your inner
Existence. I wish to come even c you, in the end, remain all alone inside
Yourself."

(These above-written words, including all words written within quotation marks)
(are all thoughts of Bhagwam Shree Rajneesh; one of the greatest philosophers)
