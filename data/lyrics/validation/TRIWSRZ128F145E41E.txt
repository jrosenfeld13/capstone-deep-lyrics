Come back and take this hurt off me
Baby come back and take this hurt off me
'Cause I'm too young to be in misery now
Baby come back and take this hurt off me

I've been waitin' at the bus station
'Cause that's where you left me standin'
Got my clothes in a twenty-five cents locker
I'll be here till the greyhound brings you back again baby

Come back and take this hurt off me
Baby come back and take this hurt off me
'Cause I'm too young to be in misery now
Baby come back and take this hurt off me

I knocked on my mother's door
She said "Stevie, what honey -
Son you don't have to say a mumbling word"
She left my little baby again, yes she did now

Come back and take this hurt off me
Baby come back and take this hurt off me
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby now
What kind of love could this be
Baby, baby, baby I don't know what you got
It's got me, it's got me, it got me yes it has now

I've been to see my doctor, (I've been to see my doctor now)
He did all he could (He did all he could)
But there was nothing he could do for me girl
You're the only one that could, come on baby

Come back and take this hurt off me
Baby come back and take this hurt off me
Hurt me, (Hurt me)
So bad, (Hurt me)
Oh yeah, (Hurt me)
So bad, (Hurt me)
Take this hurt off me baby, (Hurt me)
Oohhh, oh yeah, (Hurt me)
You know it's hurt me so bad like I've never been hurt before, (Hurt me)
So bad...
