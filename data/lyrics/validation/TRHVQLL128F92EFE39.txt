[Intro]
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
I can't believe what I've seen, so scratch my eyes out!
You, were at ease, on your knees, in his apartment!
You, said his name, as I came, in your direction!
Now, I can choose, what to do, with both of you!

[Chorus]
I loved you! (I hate you)
You hurt me! (I loved you)
I loved you
You hurt me bad!
Go!
Your words, bury me, of what I used to be
I can't erase all those things I've seen
Your heart smothers me, now it's hard to breathe
I can't erase all my memories


[Verse 2]
I, take a step, to the left, now you see me!
Tears, start to pour, as you crawl, in his apartment!
You, screamed his name, as I came, in your direction!
Fists, start to fly, say goodbye, there's no excuses!

[Chorus]
I loved you! (I hate you)
You hurt me! (I loved you)
I loved you
You hurt me bad!
Go!
Your words, bury me, of what I used to be
I can't erase all those things I've seen
Your heart smothers me, now it's hard to breathe
I can't erase all my memories
Oh!

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Wha-oh-ah-oh!
Wha-oh-ah-oh!
Wha-oh-ah-oh!
Wha-oh-ah-oh!

Get up!
(Hey!) There's no excuses! (Hey!)
(Hey!) There's no excuses! (Hey!)

[Chorus]
I loved you! (I hate you)
You hurt me! (I loved you)
I loved you
You hurt me bad!
Go!
Your words, bury me, of what I used to be
I can't erase all those things I've seen
Your heart smothers me, now it's hard to breathe
I can't erase all my memories
