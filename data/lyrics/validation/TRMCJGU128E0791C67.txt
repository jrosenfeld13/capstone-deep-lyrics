How does it feel to feel the way?
The self-same way you've felt most everyday
When you were young that feeling kept you strong
Now you don't know if you can carry on

I don't wanna hurt you baby
I don't wanna hurt you darling
We just need to carry on

I was the only child of five
I had to struggle hard to stay alive
Walking on water now with open arms
Just singing a hymn for those you thought had gone

I don't wanna hurt you baby
I don't wanna hurt you darling
We just need to carry on

How does it feel to feel the way?
The self-same way you've felt most everyday
When you were young that feeling kept you strong
Now you don't know if you can carry on

Time comes down very hard
No matter how you try
You'll never get by
