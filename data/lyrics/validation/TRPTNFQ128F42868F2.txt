I wanna wake up with a reason to celebrate
I wanna wake up before it's too late
I wanna hear that song on the radio
Spinning around my head like a halo

As I fade to another place
Where I dream while I'm still awake
I feel shame as I waste away
I sip this cheap champagne
It's just another day

Hey, old man, you used to live for the heroin
You were a shooting star leaving impressions
Now you're sitting alone in your rocking chair
Wishing you could rock it right out of there

As I fade to another place
Where I dream while I'm still awake
I feel shame as it waves away
I sip this cheap champagne
It's just another day

It's hopeless, devotion, it drags me down and weighs a thousand pounds
I'm drowning in all these lies how can this be true, I have been denied [x2]
It's hopeless; I have been denied [x3]
How can this be true?
I have been denied, denied
