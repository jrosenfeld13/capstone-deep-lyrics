Can't nobody do me like Jesus
Can't nobody ever come and take His place
Can't nobody do me like Jesus
Northing ever stays the same
Everything changes
Everytime I call His name
Lord I wonder who would cover me
When I found myself standing all alone
The ones I trusted they didn't love me
Cause when I looked around
My family and friends were gone
Mama told me where my help comes from
And when things get rough
I know just where to go
There's a peace that I jst can't explain
For those who don't know
It ain't nothing but the Holy Ghost
