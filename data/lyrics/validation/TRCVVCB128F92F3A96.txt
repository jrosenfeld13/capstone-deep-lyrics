[Instrumental]

I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you

I'm gonna write words, oh, so sweet
They're gonna knock me off my feet

A lotta kisses on the bottom
I'll be glad I got 'em

I'm gonna smile and say, "I hope you're feeling better"
And close "with love" the way you do
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe it came from you

[Instrumental break]

Gonna smile and say, "I hope you're feeling better"
And close "with love" the way you do
I'm gonna sit right down and write myself a letter
And make believe, make believe, make believe it came from you
