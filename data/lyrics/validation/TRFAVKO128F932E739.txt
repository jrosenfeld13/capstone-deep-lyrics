[Verse 1]
I know what you're thinking
But I'm not your property
No matter what you say
No matter what you say

[Chorus]
Move along, there's nothing left to see
Just a body, nothing left to see

[Verse 2]
A couple more for breakfast
A little more for tea
Just to take the edge off
Just to take the edge off

[Chorus]
Move along, there's nothing left to see
Just a body, pouring down the street
Move along, there's nothing left to see
Just a body, nothing left to see

[Outro]
Move along
