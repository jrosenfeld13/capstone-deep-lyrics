Chorus:
Take up your cross and follow Jesus
Take up your cross every day
Dont be ashamed to say that you know Him
Count the cost, take up your cross and follow Him
What are you doing for the King
Have you really given everything
For the One who gave His all for you
Dont be satisfied just to know
That the Lord has saved your soul
Have you forgotten what you need to do

(chorus)
Dont be ashamed to say that you know Him
Count the cost, take up your cross and follow Him
I know sometimes the road is long
And I know sometimes you feel like you cant go on
But you can make it, you just

(chorus)
Dont be ashamed to say that you know Him
Count the cost, take up your cross
Follow Him
