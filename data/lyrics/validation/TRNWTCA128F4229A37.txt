Staring at her straight in the eyes
So profoundly, almost able to see, understand something invisible
Intangible pure and innocent or simply spontaneous

Seeking the touch the breath and the warmth of that body with eyes half
Closed, she listened to the beat of her heart and, she smiled

Like a succession of shivers
Running through your bones

In the air
Invisible
Energy
Provides
The key to global understanding without words
The Universal language
