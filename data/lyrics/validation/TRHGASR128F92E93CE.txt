I dont know its hard
Reaching a dead end
But Id rather see you like this
Than pretending again
Now Im looking over big brothers shoulder
Now until this is over
I cant keep a lie
But I can keep an eye on you
Pat yourself on the back
Beat yourself up instead
How youll ever clean up
This mess thats inside your head
Now Im looking over big brothers shoulder
Now until this is over
I cant keep a lie
But I can keep an eye on you . . 
Yeah you are long lost again
As meaningful it is to hear your voice now
You keep your spirits high
While youre still alive
Now Im looking over big brothers shoulder
Now until this is over
I cant keep a lie
But I can keep an eye on you
Making everyone laugh at themselves
Putting us all through hell
Keep your spirits high
I cant keep a lie
I cant keep a lie
But I can keep an eye on you
