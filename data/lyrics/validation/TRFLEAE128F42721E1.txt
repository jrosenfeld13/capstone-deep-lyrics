If our God is for us, who can be against us?
He will keep His promise
There's nobody like Him
What can separate us from the love of Jesus?
He will keep His promise
There's nobody like Him, nobody like Him, oh

There's nobody like Him
What can separate us from the love of Jesus?

There is none in heaven or earth like You
There is none in heaven or earth like You
There is none in heaven or earth like You
There is none in heaven or earth like You
