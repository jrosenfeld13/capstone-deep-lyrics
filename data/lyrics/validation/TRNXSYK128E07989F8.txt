Alright

Twist my arm behind my back
Burn me with a lighted match
Bind me with ropes and chains
None of these things can cause me pain

I can be hurt by love
Yeah, hurt by love
So hurt by love
I can be hurt by love
Yes, hurt by love
Hurt by love
So hurt by love

Where do I hurt
I can be hurt
I'm hurt by love
Hurt by love

Stick a ring through my nose
Drag me across burning coals
Cough out a witch's curse
The pain of love's far worse

I can be hurt by love
Hurt by love
So hurt by love
Hurt by love
Hurt by love
Hurt by love
So hurt by love

I can be hurt (hurt)
I can be hurt (hurt)
I can be hurt (hurt)
Hurt by love (hurt)

Take it easy now
Said, take it easy
Take it down
Way down
To the floor

Hurt me a little more now

Hurt me
Hurt me

Oh, yeah

Oh, yeah

Hurt
Hurt
Hurt
Hurt

I can be hurt by love
So hurt by love
So hurt by love

Hurt me
Hurt me
Hurt me
Hurt me
Hurt me
Aghh!
Aghh!
Hurt me
Hurt me
Hurt me
Hurt me
Hurt me

Well, I can be hurt by love
