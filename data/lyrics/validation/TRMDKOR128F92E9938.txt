Don't keep me framed like this, yo

You got me in the wrong state, wrong phase man
This is just my face
This not what I am

Trapped like 'john' mac rebennack
In the wrong place, wrong time
Now I'm freezed in the minds
As that kind out of line
Porcupine, yes man I can sting
You don't know me, you don't know me
With that bullshit that they bring
Never caught me stealin', but I'm still feelin'
And I'm dragged outta my bed
Would you look appealin' ?
Scrutinized like mice, for years to come
'N I don't even know where I'm comin' from

Got me framed, got me framed
Got me framed, got me framed
Got me framed, got me framed

Don't keep me framed, like this yo ! like this yo !

You got me in the wrong state, wrong phase man
This is just my face
This not what I am

Subject and one of the mass
See I'm all that
Diverse from upper-class
See I'm all that
See I'm all that and it's a fact
I bleed when you beat
But a principle idea, belief
You can never crack
You got me black and blue battered
But I can go boogie down bronx buck wild
When you want damage done
See what you're seeing, but this can't be shun
It's me, you call disease
A human being one
