Don't want your dirty eyes pointing on me!
Don't wanna see your face tricking me another time!
My life reached it's pinnacle
But your wet touch isn't my goal
I fly to different skies
I can't stand no more your lies!
Bridge
Another stupid soul has fallen into my trick again!
Another pure soul will increase my reign!
I am the rainbringer, the ruler stronger than your gof!
And you will drown forever lost!
Chorus
It once seemed love...
(But) was all a lie!
Will someone else need a try?
I feel like a dove
So far away
But I forgotten all the rain!
Don't wanna touch your dirty hand
That write false words on the sand!
I am the wind that cleans 'em up!
I will blow until you'll drown in pain!
My life reached it's pinnacle
But your wet touch isn't my goal
I fly to different skies
I can't stand no more your lies!
Bridge
I'll break the glass of pain that you
Make from kidnapped souls!
I'll run for my new life that you
Won't rule or destroy!
Chorus
