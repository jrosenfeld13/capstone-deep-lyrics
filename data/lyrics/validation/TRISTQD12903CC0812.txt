Goin' out and get me some sun
I'm gonna collect it baby
Then we can have a whole lot of fun
Gonna reflect it baby

That fossil fuel's got no renewal
You know it couldn't hold a candle
There ain't no spark in the dark
Gonna touch my solar, solar sex panel

I got a fire up on top of my head
I'm a love regenerator
Why don't you get up off your tanning bed
I'm an ultra-violet penetrator

Don't sweat and toil with no heating oil
'Cause momma I'm hot to handle
Gonna turn you up, gonna burn you up
With my solar, solar sex panel
Solar, solar sex panel

Got a headache burnin' bad gasoline
Well, I'm gonna relieve it baby
My solar powered lovin' burns clean
You're gonna receive it baby

And it's rude, if it's crude
Better try my solar, solar sex panel
Better try my
Solar
Come and get my
Sex panel

I'm gonna turn you up, I'm gonna burn you up
Better bet your ass I won't run outta gas
Solar, solar sex panel

Better try my
Solar
Come and get my
Sex panel

...Incomprehensible...
Solar, solar sex panel
Solar, solar sex panel
Solar, solar sex panel
