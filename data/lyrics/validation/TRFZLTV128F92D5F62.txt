Intro:
He needs no introduction, he needs no publicity , he needs no promotion he only needs you to give him a big round of applause! I wanna hear you say it one time loud and clear on the count of three 1, 2 , 3 ,4

Verse 1:
They said that the fire is gone , but it never left
Hotter than the brimstone found deep in the devils chest
No religion I hold the vision farther than heavens steps
Hope you listen, ain't no forgiven driven by every breath
My pops could of stuck around but instead he left
So he met his death, fuck grieving im already stressed
Bring it to the calistenics nice steady reps
Im doing heavy sets drinking on every rest
They say im very blessed, I think a different way
I sell a clip of yay and Nia got kicks today
I ain't got shit to say this is just a sick display
Street religion I give em, grab a clip and pray
Im legendary and sharper then ten machetes
My vocals invoke spirits and wake up the cemetaries
Where acres of men are buried
My hands on the eagles and the only safeties I know, they playing the secondary
You haters are never ready, my words dope, take em in vain
They'll have you shakin like patients from epilepsy
Im saying you best respect me, the last one of his kind
A street prophet you better pray that this vest protect me
Don't wait til the feds arrest me, my life should be celebrated
Visions of middle-aged niggas saying they never made it
The worlds segregated; the have and have-nots
Blast shots what you expect? we ain't been educated
Im mentally elevated Im meant to be levitated
Those who oppose me is eventually devastated
Im hated by many respected by all
Loved by the ones who told me I was destined to fall
Aggresive and raw I dont use discretion at all
Artistic violence, all of my weapons can draw
From here to eternity my words will be surgery
Mercifully the devil'll curse whoever gave birth to me
The booth is my solitude this is church for me
You shouldn't even exist on the same earth as me
Send em straight to mercury for trying to spit a verse at me
Im perfectly chiseled from cast iron, my verses are scriptures from past zion
I worship the pistol and blast iron, submerged in the issues of scag buying
My vivid tales of street horror will leave scars in the worst part of ya
Brain and destroy it like pearl harbor this boy is the worlds author
Autobiographical scriptures the first father jus listen and work harder
