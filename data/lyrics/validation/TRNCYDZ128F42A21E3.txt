Well this is murder
Yea, On the dog train
When all the brakes have failed
And I'm going down hill
And if you see me wave
Yea, I'm only saying bye bye
There's not a single tear
Here in my eyes
La, La, La ..........
And if you've heard this before
Yea, I'm gonna say it again
But life was easier when
I didn't have a clue
Because this is murder
I'm getting dog tired
Let's make the world brand new
How about you
La, La, La ..........
(I love this, I love life)......
