Jesus, Jesus, hear us as we call on You
As we call Your name
Be pleased, Lord with all that You hear
As we worship You, oh Lord, please draw near
For we are longing just to glimpse Your beauty Lord

So we lift You up, Lord, we lift You up
We have come to see Your face
Yes, we lift You up, God, we lift You up
Jesus, come and take Your place

Holy, pure and true You are
How we need You Lord to cleanse us with Your love
So come, Lord won't You come, Lord?
And as we lift Your name, draw all men to You
We're longing to be less ourselves and more like You

We lift You up, Lord, we lift You up
We have come to see Your face
Yes, we lift You up, God, we lift You up
Jesus, come and take Your place

We lift You up, we lift You up
We lift You up, God, we lift You up
We're longing to be less ourselves and more like You

We lift You up, we lift You up
We have come to see Your face
Yes, we lift You up, God, we lift You up
Jesus, come and take Your place

Won't You come Lord?
Won't You come Lord?
We have come to see Your face
