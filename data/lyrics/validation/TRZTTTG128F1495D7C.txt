I'll write you a letter tomorrow
Tonight, I can't hold a pen
Someone's got a stamp that I can borrow
I promise not to blow the address again

Lights that flash in the evening
Through a crack in the drapes

Jesus rides beside me
He never buys any smokes
Hurry up, hurry up, ain't you had enough of this stuff
Ashtray floors, dirty clothes and filthy jokes

See you're high and lonesome
Try and try and try

Lights that flash in the evening
Through a hole in the drapes
I'll be home when I'm sleeping
I can't hardly wait

I can't wait
Hardly wait
I can't wait
Hardly wait
I can't wait
Hardly wait
I can't wait
Hardly wait
I can't wait
Hardly wait
