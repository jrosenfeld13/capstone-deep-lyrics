Slide on in between
Liquid bass babe, you're just a drop in the ocean
I look up
Look up and lose my step
Watch you take your place in the sun

Don't be shy
We all the same on the inside
Liquid bass babe I'm on your mind
Slide on in
Slide on in between
Liquid bass babe I'm on your mind

Drive to drive man they come from nowhere
Big black suits no number on their jackets
Holy cow no I don't tell them nothing
I'm on your side
Don't go out you'd think I'd learn my lesson
Day to day we fight a losing battle
Shine out shine it's on the surface baby
On the other side

Yes I see you
Day by day
Don't go out
Feel so strange
My own time yeah
Run to run
Drink so deep yeah
I'm deaf and dumb

Watch you take your place in the sun
