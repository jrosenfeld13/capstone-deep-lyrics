She prayed to the man with the twin in the mask
But the world is numb and cold
And the boy all alone casually wandering home
Unaware of sobering reality

Faster, save me, harder, I can't

Breathe in, breathe out
Let them all fold, let them all fold
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them all fold, let them all fold

Hearts finish here, love decays while call girls perform
He waits alone, playing roles to suit lovers flue
The lust and the size, the church and the dime
The cryptic clientele all careening inside
The puzzling facade steers pure from the divine

Breathe in, breathe out
Let them all fold, let them all fold
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them all fold, let them all fold
Yeah

Many wishes of hunger were wronged
By the pimp and priest's thirst for a fault
All the anger from a lover's lament
Force fed in the stomach of sin
Welcome to the world
