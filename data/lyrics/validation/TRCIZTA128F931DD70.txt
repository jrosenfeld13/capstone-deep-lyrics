I've always been a two-fisted drinker
And a lover of sad country songs
And I thought I was a cool-headed thinker
But that woman keeps proving me wrong

Just look at these blisters on my fingers
I'm workin' myself to the bone
She had me from the first time I kissed her
But she's really got me now that she's gone

Now I'm payin' for my wife's little pleasures
Her new house and car that she drives
I'm workin' for her life of leisure
And her new life with some other guy

She took everything when she left me
'Cept my guitar and my ole Harley Hog
And it hurts me to think her new lover
Is drinkin' my liquor and pettin' my dog

While I'm payin' for my wife's little pleasures
Her new house and car that she drives
I'm workin' for her life of leisure
And her new life with some other guy

I'm workin' for her life of leisure
And her new life with some other guy
