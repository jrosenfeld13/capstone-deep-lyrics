Behind these walls
You can be so self-absorbed
Behind those eyes, no disguise
Disguise, no you can't disguise
Behind this fortress of an address
Stuck in the passion void
With a little style full and for a while
But you can't turn back time

Dear Miami
You're the first to go
Disappearing
Under melting snow
Each and everyone
Turn your critical eye
On the burning sun
And try not to cry

Strictly rolling V.I.P
Strictly rolling V.I.P

We got it all
The empire ever falls
We got all control, untold power to
Do what we wanna do
We got the moves
But there's nothing left to prove
There's only stardust memories
We can make come true

Dear Miami
You're the first to go
Disappearing
Under melting snow
Each and everyone
Turn your critical eye
On the burning sun
And try not to cry

Dear Miami
You're the first to go
Disappearing
Under melting snow
Each and everyone
Turn your critical eye
On the burning sun
And try not to cry

Merry-go-round again
(Merry-go-round again)
A carousel, a passion parade
An escapade
(Adventure's eve)

Strictly rolling V.I.P
Strictly rolling V.I.P
Strictly rolling V.I.P
Strictly rolling V.I.P
