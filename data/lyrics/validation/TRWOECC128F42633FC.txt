Anne walks alone
Past the Domino sugar factory
She's as easy to know
As a broken mystery, oh
Conversations are slow
With herself in dead parking lots, and
Hands not being held
End up tying other things in knots
And she's lonely
Oh so lonely

You make your way up third
Where all the Brooklyn-hearted (?) girls go
And maybe you'll see her
A quiet face in a crowd (?)
You know that you don't deserve
The Holy Father of the day-to-day
To keep watch over her
Tell me, why is she wasting away
Being lonely?
Oh, so lonely

Water under the bridge is never comin' back
Water under the bridge is never comin' back
