'm in too deep
I can't get to sleep
But when I do
I only dream of you
I need to see your face, and feel your warm embrace
It's your memory, that keeps me alive
Will you remember me...
Like I remember you...
Will you remember me...
Like I remember you...
Will you remember me
Never felt this way. There's nothing I could say
You've only left me wanting so much more
'Emotions every day'? and all the love we shared
There's too much room for us to grow
And I just can't let you go...
Will you remember me...
Like I remember you...
Will you remember me...
Like I remember you...
And I just can't let you go...

Will you remember me...
Like I remember you...
Will you remember me...
Like I remember you...
Will you remember me...
