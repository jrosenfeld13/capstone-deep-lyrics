[Verse 1]
Thought I ran into you down on the street
Then it turned out to only be a dream

[Chorus]
I made a point to burn all of the photographs
She went away and then I took a different path
I remember the face but I can't recall the name
Now I wonder how Whatsername has been

[Verse 2]
Seems that she disappeared without a trace
Did she ever marry old Whatshisface?

[Chorus]
I made a point to burn all of the photographs
She went away and then I took a different path
I remember the face but I can't recall the name
Now I wonder how Whatsername has been

[Bridge]
Remember, whatever
It seems like forever ago
Remember, whatever
It seems like forever ago
The regrets are useless in my mind
She's in my head, I must confess
The regrets are useless in my mind
She's in my head from so long ago
(Go, Go, Go, Go..)

[Outro]
And in the darkest night
If my memory serves me right
I'll never turn back time
Forgetting you, but not the time
