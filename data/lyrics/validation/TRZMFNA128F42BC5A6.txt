[Verse 1]
There's no work in walking in to fuel the talk
I would grab my shoes, and then away I'd walk
Through all the stubborn beauty, I start at the dawn
Until the sun had fully stopped
Never walking away from
Just a way to pull apart
Dehydrate back into minerals
A lifelong walk to the
Same exact spot

[Chorus]
Carbon's anniversary
The parting of the sensory
Old, old mystery
The parting of the sensory

[Verse 2]
Who the hell made you the boss?
We placed our chips in all the right spots
But still lost
Any shithead who had ever walked
Could take the ship and do a much finer job
These fit like clothes made out of wasps
Aw, fuck it, I guess I lost

[Chorus]
The parting of the sensory
Carbon's anniversary
Just part it again if you please
Carbon's anniversary

[Verse 3]
Who the hell made you the boss?
If you say what to do, I know when not to stop
If you were the ship, who would ever get on?
The weather changed it for the worse
And came down on us like it had been rehearsed
Unlikely hope, but change will surely come
It'd be awful for most, but really good for some
I took a trip to the exact same spot
We pulled the trigger, but we forgot to cock
And every single shot...
Aw, fuck it, I guess we lost

[Bridge]
Someday you will die and somehow
Something's gonna steal your carbon, hey
Someday you will die and somehow
Something's gonna steal your carbon, hey-hey-hey
Well, someday you will die somehow
And something's gonna steal your carbon
(Someday you will die somehow
And something's gonna steal your)
Someday you will die and someone's
Or something will steal your carbon
(Someday you will die somehow
And something's gonna steal your)
Someday something will die
And somehow you'll figure out how often
You will die somehow
And something's gonna steal your carbon
Something will die
And you will probably just steal its carbon
Someday you will die somehow
And something's gonna steal your carbon, hey-hey-hey
Someday, somehow, or something will die
And you will steal its carbon
Somehow you will die and you will figure out how often
You will die somehow
And something's gonna steal your carbon
Someday you will die somehow
And someone's gonna steal your carbon, hey
Someday you will die, and somehow
You will figure out how often

[Outro]
Someday you will die somehow
And something's gonna steal your carbon
You will die and somehow
It's gonna steal your
Always have to figure out and find out
We were bathed in carbon
You will figure out that somehow you will
Well, someday you will die somehow
And someone's gonna steal your carbon
