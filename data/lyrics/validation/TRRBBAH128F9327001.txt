[Verse 1: Johnny 3 Tears & Charlie Scene]
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow
The hammer of the gods will drive our ships to new lands
To fight the horde, singing and crying "Valhalla, I am coming!"

[Chorus: J-Dog]
On we sweep with, with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

[Verse 2: J-Dog & Charlie Scene]
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow
How soft, your fields so green can whisper tales of gore
Of how we calmed the tides of war, we are young overlords

[Chorus: Johnny 3 Tears]
On we sweep with, with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

[Outro: J-Dog]
So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins
For peace and trust can win the day despite all your losing
