I have seen Mr. Apollo
Uproot trees with his bare hands
I have seen Mr. Apollo's
Body-building plan

He's the strongest man
The world has ever seen
And if you take his courses
He'll make you big and rough
And...and you can beat up bullies
Till they cry "Oh, lor', oh crikey
Let go, you rotter! Don't punish me!"

When you're tough (You're very fit)
Your voice is gruff (It sounds like grit)
You are so strong (And proud of it)
Thanks to Mr. Apollo

Follow Mr. Apollo
Everybody knows he's the greatest benefactor of mankind

Everybody knows that a healthy body makes a healthy mind

You know! You know!
He's the strongest man
The world has ever seen
And if you take his courses
He'll make you big and rough
And...And you can kick the sand
Right back in their faces!
Kick! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

When you're tough (You're very fit)
Your voice is gruff (It sounds like grit)
You are so strong (And proud of it)

Yes, just give me ten years of your life
And I'll trade in that puny flab for living muscle
A physique you deserve!
Strong!
Chest and shoulders to hold your shirt up!

(He can do it for you!)

Five years ago I was a four-stone apology...
Today I am two separate gorillas!

No tiresome exercises!
No tricks!
No unpleasant bending!
Wrestle poodles and win!
Play beach ball!
Shave your legs! (He can do it for you!)
Lope over walls!
Tease people!
Brush them aside as though they were matchsticks!
Impress your friends!
