Heart-stopping liar
Are you ready for the next joke?
They're still not watching you enough
Can't stop this fire
I'm protected from all angles
But I can see you're paranoid

Hide to keep silent
Run to get out
I think you got the wrong idea

Melts in your mouth
Lies you've quoted like the movies
As if you were so gentle
Your deceitful face
It's like you're ripping off your Judas

Run, try to escape
