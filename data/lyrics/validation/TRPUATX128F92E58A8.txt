[Chorus]
I'd have kept him up all night
I wouldn't let him close his eyes
Made him sing I saw the light
'til he sobered up again
I'd have kept his coffee strong
Oh I could have kept him hangin' on
If I'd have been in the back
Of Hank's Cadillac

[Verse 1]
Got a bid no higher by the marnat
Hank you got to get up on that stage
You can't let all those good people down
It just ain't right, To book a show
And not show up to play

[Chorus]
I'd have kept him up all night
I wouldn't let him close his eyes
Made him sing I saw the light
'til he sobered up again
I'd have kept his coffee strong
Oh I could have kept him hangin' on
If I'd have been in the back
Of Hank's Cadillac

[Verse 2]
When his hands started tremblin' and his body turnin' cold and death started tuggin' at his soul
I'd start felt one of his songs playin' on that AM radio
Held him tight and begged him not to go
I'd have held him tight and begged him not to go

He'd have lived to play more songs
I could have kept him hangin' on
If I'd have been in the back of Hank/s Cadillac
