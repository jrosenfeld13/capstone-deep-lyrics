And free to love again
Then part of me lets go of you
But my heart keeps givin' in

Keeps givin' into memories
And dreams that won't come true
Sometimes I think I'll never be
Really over you

Dreams die hard
When they don't come true
Dreams die hard
And there's nothing you can do

Dreams die hard
When they take your pride
It's hard to find a new dream
With an old one in your eyes

Sometimes I go a day or two
You don't even cross my mind
I think maybe it's finally true
Gonna leave the past behind

Then I see someone who looks like you
From a window on the street
I know it's not really you
But my heart still skips a beat

Dreams die hard
When they don't come true
Dreams die hard
And there's nothing you can do

Dreams die hard
When they take your pride
It's hard to find a new dream
With an old one in your eyes
It's hard to find a new dream
With an old one in your eyes

And free to love again
Then part of me lets go of you
