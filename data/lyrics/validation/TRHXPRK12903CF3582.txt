Jennifer, the party's over
I didn't think you'd make it though the night
Everybody's gone but you're alright
Sweetie now obviously
You know it's not obvious to me
But it's not plain enough to see

You're falling baby
I've been waiting
You took the long way home
In that dress, it makes me crazy
I'm not the only one
It's cold outside
Keep your heart open wide
Save it for somebody who cares
Somebody who cares

Jennifer, the weekend's over
But at least you made it though with style
It all comes together after a while
Tell me baby is it hard to admit
Do you remember what you did?
Where we've been?

You're falling baby
I've been waiting
You took the long way home
In that dress, it makes me crazy
I'm not the only one
It's cold outside
Keep your heart open wide
Save it for somebody who cares

You don't have to walk alone tonight
I don't have to be a gentleman
You don't have to say a single word
Or make believe that we could be just friends

You're falling baby
I've been waiting
You took the long way home
In that dress, it makes me crazy
I'm not the only one
It's cold outside
Keep your heart open wide
Save it for somebody who cares
Somebody who cares
Somebody who cares
