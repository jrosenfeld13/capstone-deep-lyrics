(Chorus)
Sometimes I feel like I wanna runaway
Pack my things and make a quick getaway
From the drama surrounding, and the world around me
Sometimes I feel like I wanna runaway
Pack my things and make a quick getaway
But my heart keeps punding
And it won't allow me

(Verse)
I need some time to get away from the problems in my life
To relieve my mind and put aside all of this shit attackin me inside
All of this drama surrounding me, drives me crazy constantly
I just need some time to breathe and take my mind off of everything

(Chorus)
Sometimes I feel like I wanna runaway
Pack my things and make a quick getaway
From the drama surrounding, and the world around me
Sometimes I feel like I wanna runaway
Pack my things and make a quick getaway
But my heart keeps punding
And it won't allow me

(verse)
Try to keep it behind me, but I'm always reminded
Of everything that bothers me, like you can't take breaks from reality
Just keep on moving and keep on doing what will keep my life running smoothly
Just a moment to relax, sit back alone, no one to bother me, I'll finally be free

(Chorus)
Sometimes I feel like I wanna runaway
Pack my things and make a quick getaway
From the drama surrounding, and the world around me
Sometimes I feel like I wanna runaway
Pack my things and make a quick getaway
But my heart keeps punding
And it won't allow me

(Bridge x3)
I gotta runaway
Gotta do it now
Gotta find some time alone somehow
I gotta runaway
Gotta do it now
Gonna make it all work out

(Chorus x3)
Sometimes I feel like I wanna runaway
Pack my things and make a quick getaway
From the drama surrounding, and the world around me
Sometimes I feel like I wanna runaway
Pack my things and make a quick getaway
But my heart keeps punding
And it won't allow me

Sometimes I feel like I wanna runaway (runaway, runaway)...
