Was never touched like this before
Was object of a revelation
Raging that I have to go
First of a generation
Something inside somewhere
Where the thoughts begin to run
Oh gracious heaven I declare
Hate begins to freeze my heart
It's evil
It's so evil

Bringing blood to my youth
Killing daughters of the skies
Slaughter of the innocents
Laughing while the heaven cries
I'm the first he will kiss
While my insides decompose
Who drives the stake though my heart
Casting out my ardent soul
It's evil
It's so evil
