So quiet and peaceful
It's like a symphony
Silent and blissful
The world inside of me
Beautiful places
I close my eyes and see
Unbounded spaces
Where my soul runs free

It's a cold world outside
I need a safe place to hide
Learning from learning
As the big wheel keeps on turning

And now
The morning sun's grace
Its tender embrace
And everything's clear in my heart
My sweet surrender
To this splendor
A gentle rain beats on my face

A restful silence
I feel the singing breeze

No pain, no violence
Only the scent of the trees
Oh, it's a sunny day
At the heart of me
All clouds are rolled away
All is tranquillity

I want to taste the here and now
Before I take my final bow
Memories chasing memories
Like fantasies feeding realities

And I
Walk through the tall grass
Smile to my past
A sense of content fills my heart
My Lord console me
Say you love me
And let the beauty shine for me
Eternally
