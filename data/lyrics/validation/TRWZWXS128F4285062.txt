You were headed in another direction
And then you saw me
I knew that
You were ready for the connection
And I could feel your desire

Slow down
I think youre scaring me
Youre really getting me and
Everything is moving too fast

Hold on
Dont leave me now
I cant let you leave
Because I want you so bad

Youre just an operator
Oh, you could make a
Girl do things shed never done
Operator, motivator
Youre one of a kind

I got a notion
You know just how to move me all over
Im caught in a motion
Like Ive never been here before

Slow down
I think youre scaring me
Youre getting me and
Everything is moving too fast

Hold on
Dont leave me now
Cant let you leave
Because I want you so bad

Youre just an operator
Oh, you could make a
Girl do things shed never done
Operator, motivator
Youre one of a kind

I couldnt think of anything better
I couldnt leave it alone
Dont know how Ill ever resist you
I really want to go on

Slow down
I think youre scaring me
Youre really getting me and
Everything is moving too fast

Hold on dont leave me now
Cant let you leave
Because I want you so bad

Youre just an operator
Oh, you could make a
Girl do things shed never done
Operator, motivator
Youre one of a kind
