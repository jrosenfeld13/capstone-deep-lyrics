[Verse 1]
Hey, Mr. Churchill comes over here
To say we're doing splendidly
But it's very cold out here in the snow
Marching to win from the enemy
Oh I say it's tough, I have had enough
Can you stop the cavalry?

[Verse 2]
I have had to fight, almost every night
Down throughout these centuries
That is when I say, oh yes yet again
Can you stop the cavalry?

[Chorus]
Mary Bradley waits at home
In the nuclear fall-out zone
Wish I could be dancing now
In the arms of the girl I love

[Intermission]
Dub a dub a dumb dumb
Dub a dub a dumb
Dub a dumb dumb dub a dub
Dub a dub a dumb
Dub a dub a dumb dumb
Dub a dub a dumb
Dub a dumb dumb dub a dub
Dub a dub a dumb
Wish I was at home for Christmas

[Verse 3]
Bang! That's another bomb on another town
While the Tsar and Jim have tea
If I get home, live to tell the tale
I'll run for all presidencies
If I get elected I'll stop - I will stop the cavalry

[Intermission]
Dub a dub a dumb dumb
Dub a dub a dumb
Dub a dumb dumb dub a dub
Dub a dub a dumb
Dub a dub a dumb dumb
Dub a dub a dumb
Dub a dumb dumb dub a dub
Dub a dub a dumb
Wish I was at home for Christmas

[Chorus]
Wish I could be dancing now
In the arms of the girl I love
Mary Bradley waits at home
She's been waiting two years long
Wish I was at home for Christmas
