[Verse]
Well it's 1969 OK all across the USA
It's another year for me and you
Another year with nothing to do

[Bridge]
Last year I was 21 I didn't have a lot of fun
And now I'm gonna be 22 I say oh my and a boo-hoo

[Chorus]
It's 1969 OK all across the USA
It's another year for me and you
Another year with nothing to do
Another year with nothing to do

[Outro]
It's 1969
1969 1969 1969 1969 baby
And it's 1969 bayyyyyyybee
Baby, baby, baby
