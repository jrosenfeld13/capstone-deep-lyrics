Mary did you know that your Baby Boy
Would one day walk on water?
Mary did you know that your Baby Boy
Would save our sons and daughters?
Did you know that your Baby Boy
Has come to make you new
And the Child that you delivered
Would soon deliver you?
Mary did you know that your Baby Boy
Would give sight to a blind man?
Mary did you know that your Baby Boy
Would calm a storm with his hand?
Did you know that your Baby Boy
Walked where angels trod
And when you kiss your little Baby
You've kissed the face of God?
Oh Mary did you know
Mary did you know, okay
Did you know, did they tell you
That the blind will see, the deaf will hear
And the dead will live again
The lame will leap, the dumb will speak
The praises of the Lamb?
Oh Mary did you know that your Baby Boy
Is a Lord of all creation?
Mary did you know your Baby Boy
Would one day rule the nation?
Did you know that your Baby Boy
Is heaven's perfect Lamb
And the sleeping Child you're holding
Is the Great I Am?
Did you know that He would die for you and me?
Did you know that He would heal the sick and the [Incomprehensible]?
Did you know that He would give sight to the blind?
Did you know that He would give you peace, love, hope and joy?
Did you know that He would die for you and me?
Did you know that He would heal the sick and the [Incomprehensible]?
Did you know that He would give sight to the blind?
Did you know that He would give you peace, love, hope and joy?
