I can't get enough, sometimes its way to much [2x]

Got a job, I got doe, what I need with a hoe, I wanna girlfriend, a real women who knows how to please me she makes it so
Easy, at the end of the day we all wanna get a lil' freaky, I got dinner on the table we won't have to go on out, cause when
You get here, Imma give you all the love that I have in me, baby, all I need is your attention

[hook]
Feel a rush, when you sleep, cause I can't get enough, of your trust, in me, sometimes its way to much
Your body so right but I know I'd be wrong If I didn't wanna do you like all night long, Just a touch, and a kiss, something
I dont wanna miss, its your skin, its your lips, it feels like such a gift, talk to me baby it'll all night through in the
Morning

[Chorus]
In the morning, when we wake up, you be looking at me so peacefully this where I need to be, In the morning, when we wake
Up, will be together and whenever, no there's nothing better, In the morning when we wake up, you be looking at me so
Peacefully, got your day starting so crazy, baby, do you know, there ain't nothing like just being with you baby In the
Morning

And I love how you look, even when you get up, look so lovely, them rollers and no make up, and I can't believe, at the end
Of the day I still gotta say your my speical lady, now the mornings kinda tough, got coffee in my cup, I pray that you be
Loving me its hard to just get up, I can't start my day alone, there is nothing like just being with you In the morning

[Hook]
Feel a rush, you when you sleep, cause I can't get enough, of your trust, in me, sometimes it's way to much, I know I'd be
Wrong if I didn't take care of you, and I know I'd be wrong if I didn't wanna marry, you it just touch, and kiss something I
Dont wanna miss, it's your skin, its your lips, it feels like such a gift, day or night baby I'll be yours, girl In the
Morning

[Repeat Chorus]

[hook 2]
I can't make a day at my job alone without trying to run on home, fun'll get me all the way through the day but it just get
Me half way, I can't worry bout where my boys be going imma be right home, and I wouldn't miss it for nothing, just for that
Morning time, morning time
