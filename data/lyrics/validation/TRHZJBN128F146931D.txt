Angel eyes - am I deceived or did you sigh?
For all I know you let you love light
Shine on me
Angel eyes - you never close, who's got the time?
I can wait until your love light
Shine on me
Angel eyes - seems to me you fill the skies
I'm far below so let your love light
Shine on me
Angel eyes - on the wing and open wide
No matter how high the moon
Shine down on me
