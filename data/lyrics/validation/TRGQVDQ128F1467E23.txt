[Verse 1]
Over the sea and far away
She's waiting like an iceberg
Waiting to change
But she's cold inside
She wants to be like the water

[Pre-Chorus]
All the muscles tighten in her face
Buries her soul in one embrace
They're one and the same
Just like water

[Chorus]
Then the fire fades away
And most of everyday
Is full of tired excuses
But it's too hard to say
I wish it were simple
But we give up easily
You're close enough to see that
You're the other side of the world to me

[Verse 2]
On comes the panic light
Holding on with fingers
And feelings alike
But the time has come
To move along

[Chorus]
Then the fire fades away
And most of everyday
Is full of tired excuses
But it's too hard to say
I wish it were simple
But we give up easily
You're close enough to see that
You're the other side of the world

[Bridge]
Can you help me?
Can you let me go?
And can you still love me
When you can't see me anymore?

[Chorus]
Then the fire fades away
And most of everyday
Is full of tired excuses
But it's too hard to say
I wish it were simple
But we give up easily
You're close enough to see that
You're the other side of the world
You're the other side of the world
You're the other side of the world to me
