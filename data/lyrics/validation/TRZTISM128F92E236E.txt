Your love keeps coming
Stronger and stronger, every day
Like a river that's running turning into a tidal wave

Your love's so strong I can't fight it
Can't resist your siren's wail
I won't run I won't fight it-I could lick you any day

Now more than ever
Now more than ever

Your love keeps coming like tomorrow like judgement day
Fighting demons
Turning evil out
It keeps on driving my blues away
Read the signs
Heed the warnings
Learn the rules
Play the game
Your love keeps coming-nothing standing in its way
Now more than ever
Now more than ever

You ain't fakin-You can prove it
You keep meeting me halfway
Your love keeps coming stronger and stronger every day

Your love keeps riding like a storm conqueror
Do I need you-do I love you-do I want you like before?

Now more than ever
