I start each day out the same. Stretching out my panda arms reaching for a guitar to play
But now my best friend's at my feet. I can tell by her tiny cries. Its time for us to eat
We shuffle to that old wood stove. I put on a pot of tea and fill up both her bowls
Since we have no place to go we bow our sleepy heads and clap along to the radio

It goes tra la la la la la la

My brother lives on 14th and church
His hands hold so much joy his heart is filled with so much hurt
He fell in love with a girl from the sea
She calmed his racing mind and held him until he fell asleep
Through the years we've both seen our fair share of change
We've had some victories but mostly we just made mistakes
He's got this piano tune he made even though he wrote it as a child
It's still a hit today

It goes tra la la la la la la

Ive got this little house up north its not the biggest home but I paid what its worth
Right now its just a place to keep my books and since I hardly read
I guess its just there for looks one day three schedules will align
And finally the boys and girls will be in the same damn place at the same damn time
With our voices hearts and strings we'll fill those tiny rooms with so much love
We'll just have to sing

Tra la la la la la la

Good morning to you!
