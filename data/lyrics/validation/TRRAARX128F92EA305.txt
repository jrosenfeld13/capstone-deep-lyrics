God and life
They don't come free
Crown of thorns
Strung through their teeth

It's coming down
It's coming down
It's coming down
It's coming down

Sin and sweat
They taste so sweet
Comes the rush
An angel screams

It's coming down
(I'm on fire and I need a hole)
It's coming down
(I'm on fire and I need a hole)
It's coming down
(I'm on fire and I need a hole)
It's coming down
(I'm on fire and I need a hole)
Yeah

Love and death
They don't come free
Crown of thorns
To make you bleed

It's coming down
(I'm on fire and I need a hole)
It's coming down
(I'm on fire and I need a hole)
It's coming down
(I'm on fire and I need a hole)
It's coming down
(I'm on fire and I need a hole)
It's coming
