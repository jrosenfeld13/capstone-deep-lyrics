Ooh, how do you like my love
Ooh, how do you like my love

But if you want to know
How I really feel
Just get the cameras rolling
Get the action going
Baby you know my love for you is real
Take me where you want to
Then my heart you'll steal

More, more, more
How do you like it, how do you like it
More, more, more
How do you like it, how do you like it
More, more, more
How do you like it, how do you like it

But if you want to know
How I really feel
Just get the cameras rolling
Get the action going
Baby you know my love for you is real
Take me where you want to
Then my heart you'll steal

Ooh, how do you like my love
Ooh, how do you like my love

More, more, more
How do you like it, how do you like it
More, more, more
How do you like it, how do you like it
More, more, more
How do you like it, how do you like my love

Baby you know my love for you is real
Take me where you want to
Then my heart you steal

More, more, more
How do you like it, how do you like it
More, more, more
How do you like it, how do you like it
More, more, more
How do you like it, how do you like my love
