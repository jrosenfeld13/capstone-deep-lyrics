I wanted you to be at home
I wanted you to be at home
Could you foresee a day?
You might not play?

I wanted you to be at home
I wanted you to be at home
Could you foresee a day?
You might not play?
I wanted you to be at home

Silas and Bo, they got tired
And theyll call you once a week
Cause its strange here
No dark career
They all say they long
To reach their sorrow now
Thats gone

I wanted you to be at home
I wanted you to be at home
Could you foresee a day?
You might not play?

I wanted you to be at home
I wanted you to be at home
Could you foresee a day?
You might not play?

They took us in to see their new apartment
Thinking were slow and that our love is mean
Well leave the green green
Cause maybe well get out somehow
No-one thought of it
We didnt know wed seen their last show

Silas and Bo, they got tired
And theyll call you once a week
Cause its strange here
No dark career
They all say they long
To reach their sorrow now
Thats gone
And you  no dark career
They all say they long
To reach their sorrow now
Thats gone

And you  no dark career
They all say they long
To reach their sorrow now
Thats gone

And you  no dark career
They all say they long
To reach their sorrow now
Thats gone
