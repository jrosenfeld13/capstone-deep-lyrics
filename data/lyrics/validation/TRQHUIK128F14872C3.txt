A girl so precious to me
Hot lips and fit, it's so tempting
That I've lost what I need
To forgive and live alone in peace

Why must I carry on?
It makes no sense to be
Alone at the top of the world
Please save me!

All in, you stole my heart
All in, I'd bet the farm
All in, and felt the sting
I called your bluff baby
But I still lost everything

A world once well known to me
Was ripped and lit, it's now melting
Down to obscurity
A footnote I quote when I'm losing

Why must I carry on?
It makes no sense to be
A queen-less king of the world
Please save me!

All in, you stole my heart
All in, I'd bet the farm
All in, and felt the sting
I called your bluff baby
But i still lost everything

All in, you stole my heart
All in, I'd bet the farm
All in, and felt the sting
I called your bluff baby
But i still lost everything

All in, you stole my heart
All in, I'd bet the farm
All in, and felt the sting
I called your bluff baby
But i still lost everything

All in
All in
All in
I called your bluff baby
But i still lost everything
