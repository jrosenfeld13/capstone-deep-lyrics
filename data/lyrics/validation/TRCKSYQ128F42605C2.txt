Is it worth it to wait forever
When you find out there's really not much that you
Can say
Would it be worth it to wait forever
And everyone is saying you will come around

Is it worth it to search forever
When you find out there really isn't any other way
Would it be worth it to wait
Does it make it any easier

To save your time and give yourself
To open faces, open mouths
To any other one who reaches out
Does it make it any easier
