I didn't know
Somebody surprised me
Alarmed, alarmed
Somebody's made it this far, this far

I don't wanna let you go
I don't wanna let you go
You know it's so, it's so hard
I don't wanna let you go
I don't wanna let you go
It's gone too far... too far

And if somebody tells you you're not enough...
If somebody tells you you're not good enough...
If somebody tells you this isn't just
Just I'm burning out and I'm calling all the bluffs...

I don't wanna let you go
But the weather changes like your mind
And I don't wanna give you up
But I just might this time
I hope the new grass you seek is greener than the greenest green
And when it's not, or if it is, I just hope you'll be at peace

So go ahead
Compare the petty issues to all the awesome days
Somebody has waiting too long to still wait

I don't wanna let you go
I don't wanna let you go
You know it's so, it's so hard
I don't wanna let you go
I don't wanna let you go
It's gone too far... too far

And if somebody tells you you're not enough...
If somebody tells you you're not good enough...
If somebody tells you this isn't just
Just I'm burning out and I'm calling all the bluffs...

I don't wanna let you go
But the weather changes like your mind
And I don't wanna give you up
But I just might this time
I hope the new grass you seek is greener than the greenest green
And when it's not, or if it is, I just hope you'll be...

There is a beautiful ending but you're never gonna read the book
No you won't, no you won't
There's a magical ending but you're never gonna read the book
No you won't, no you won't...

I don't wanna let you go
But the weather changes like your mind
And I don't wanna give you up
But I just might this time
I hope the new grass you seek is greener than the greenest green
And when it's not, or if it is, I just hope you'll be at peace

So walk away, I know it hurts
Just walk away and know your worth
Walk away, I know it hurts...
