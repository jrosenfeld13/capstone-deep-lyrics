At a bar on 43rd at quarter to two
Met my friend the Chinese Elvis and hoisted a few
He talks like Mickey Mouse
And sees with x-ray eyes
Lives in a cardboard house
I almost gave him the prize
Until you came along
Thanks for opening my eyes
Things you do, right or wrong
It should come as no surprise
When you live in a town
Where there's always somebody
Stranger than you
Stranger than you
At 83rd and Amsterdam there's an Indian Jew
Who pierced all his private parts with a permanent screw
He sleeps on a bed of nails
Which came from outer space
And in my taller tales
I gave him pride of place
Until you came along
Thanks for opening my eyes
Things you do, right or wrong
It should come as no surprise
When you live in a town
Where there's always somebody
Stranger than you
Stranger than you
I'm not complaining even though I'm not sure what you are
I've got the strangest feeling, good about this love bizarre
I could have stayed in bed
Hiding from this freaky show
I'm happy that instead
I knew just where to go
When you came along
Thanks for opening my eyes
Things you do, right or wrong
It should come as no surprise
When you live in a town
Where there's always somebody
Stranger than you
Stranger than you
Stranger than you
Stranger than you
Are you a boy, are you a girl
Are you an oyster, are you a pearl
Are you a fish, are you a fowl?
Are you an angel, are you from hell
Stranger than you
Stranger than you
Stranger than you
