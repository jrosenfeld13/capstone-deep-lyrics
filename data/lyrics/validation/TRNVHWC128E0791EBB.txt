This is memory lane, Hello
November 11, 1998
Hello, and I met this guy
Man what's up, I'm cool
This spirit this soul
He had this voice and his complexion and God those eyebrows
I felt them before I ever touched him
It was so

[Verse 1]
Your beautiful
Got me singing shades of amazing rain
Plain and simply
You got me loving everything about you, thing about you
First sight and I'm dazed
I'm going crazy constantly thinking
If I should take a chance
Should I take a chance and call you

[Hook]
Just to say hello
How are you what are you up to
Nothing, I'm cool
Shes fine, alright, that's true
Who me, not you
She said "What you do"
You crazy, for eal though
Can I let you know

Hello
How are you what are you up to
Nothing, I'm cool
Shes fine, alright, that's true
Who me, not you
She said "What you do"
You crazy, for eal though
Can I let you know

[Verse 2]
I'm mesmerized
You got me doing things I wouldn't usually do
To get next to somebody i was into
And I'm into you baby, into you baby
Last night we met I feel I've known you forever
And I would like to know that we can get it together
So i will call you yeah

[Interlude]
Can I let you know, can I let you know
Can I let you know, can I let you know
Can I let you know, can I let you know
Can I let you know, can I let you know

[Verse 3 breakdown]
You know your existence
Has kinda been recognized by the resistance to dream
Eventually becoming a way of life to me
Enough to keep contentment
Through waking hours to courting shades
In those early days
Math was exchanged
I kinda had to build up the courage to just say
Hey,hello,remember me
I just felt, just to say

[Outro]

How are you, how are you babe hello
How are you, how are you babe hello
How are you, how are you babe hello
How are you, how are you babe hello
