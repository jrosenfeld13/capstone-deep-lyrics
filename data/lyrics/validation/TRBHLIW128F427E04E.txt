Sweet and tender things
Are so much nicer than silly games
Softness
Makes it easier to smile

It's better to remember things
That make the sun shine in your memory
There's clouds enough for you to see
Smile for me and take a look around

And you know that you're in love when things
Are better than you thought they'd ever be
Won't you smile for me
I like what's going down

(hum interlude)

And you know that you're in love when things
Are better than you thought they'd ever be
Make a pretty smile for me
I like what's going down (since you've been around)

Sweet and tender things
Makes you feel better than playing games
Softness
Makes it easier to smile

You're in love when things
Are better than you thought they'd ever be
Smile for me
I sure do like what's going down (since you've been around)
