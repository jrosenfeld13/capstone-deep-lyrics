Here it comes the winter I feel warm inside
Contented countless shiver up and down my spine
Frozen be the windows open to the breeze
Counting restless clatter feet running through the trees

I am centred sideways
I want to spin, I want to scream
I want to create and make reality sing
I want to spin, I want to scream
I want to create and make reality sing
Sideways

So here it comes in waves now but I know where I am
Right I feel this moment passing through this time
No acting out emotions for pleasing others smile
Just me close to the centre of moving turning time

I am centred sideways
I want to spin, I want to scream
I want to create and make reality sing
I want to spin, I want to scream
I want to create and make reality sing
Sideways

So here it comes I feel it slowing down this time
Slowing down our heartbeats just not to miss a mile
Closer still by seconds catching up the mists
Don't know where I'm going this breath is a precious gift

I am centred sideways
I want to spin, I want to scream
I want to create and make reality sing
I want to spin, I want to scream
I want to create and make reality sing
I want to spin, I want to scream
I want to create and make reality sing
I want to spin, I want to scream
I want to create and make reality sing
Sideways
