Lonely road, we gotta walk it just a little bit farther
Heavens knows it can't get any harder than it is today
Lonely road, it's not ahead but is it getting farther
Heaven knows it can't get any darker than it is today

Who do you miss in times like this
When your thoughts are filled with sadness and regrets?
To who do you pray when you've lost your way
And you've such a heavy load?
Let me walk with you upon this lonely road

Lonely road, empty kitchen and a brand new feeling
Nothing's moving but my heart is reeling since you went away
Lonely road, gotta walk it till I start forgiving
Find another way to go on living without you today

Who do you miss in times like this
When your thoughts are filled with sadness and regrets?
To who do you pray when you've lost your way
And you've such a heavy load?
Let me walk with you upon this lonely road

Lonely road, you gotta walk it till the thought astounds you
And you look and find that all around you, people walk with you
Lovely road, you gotta walk it till you won't forget it
That the point is never where you're headed
It's what you're going through

Who do you miss in times like this
When your thoughts are filled with sadness and regrets?
To who do you pray when you've lost your way
And you've such a heavy load?
Let me walk with you upon this lonely road, road
