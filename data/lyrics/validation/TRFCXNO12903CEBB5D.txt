Come to me - oh, mighty force of my inner will...
Raise the power of knowledge and give me the spirit to...kill!
Prepare my being to conquer what's to be mine...
- For eternity
The aftermath of a battle to come
A vivid vision before my eyes
The storm has calmed and peace has landed
No more are we under the influence of lies
The false ones have been put to their death
By the purest form of pure impurity
The sky turns jetblack - We breed in the dark
- Reborn to a new reality

Wind sweeps the fields where they all died...
The fields where their blood was spilt...
The hordes of celestial light saw the fields of blood...once
Wind sweeps the fields where they all died...
The fields where weak blood was spilt...
The hordes of celestial lies saw the fields of blood

I summon my inner self to strenghten my final will
My will destroy the promised land of thousand fakes
I summon my mental force for it is mightier than your sword
Reveal the powers of Wrath - tomorrow I am your GOD!!!

...This is the dawn of the final war
...I shall bring you all down
Kill 'em all!!!

The victory is written in my very flesh
- Enscribed in my very mind
Before daylight strikes the earth will be purified
And no pretender shall walk on this ground
The shadows retiring with the darkness of night
And hatred is growing within
The first sunbeams of this day of glory
Reflect hatred in my eyes - the triumph of Death
