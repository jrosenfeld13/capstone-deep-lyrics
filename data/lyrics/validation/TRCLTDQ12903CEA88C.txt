Why must I leave this day behind?
I never knew that someone could be so kind
And you were, yes, you were

Last night when we walked underneath the stars
You had me believe that one of them was ours
And it was, yes, it was

So now I come right out and say
That I can hardly wait for Friday
Just like that my week has changed
Waiting for you
