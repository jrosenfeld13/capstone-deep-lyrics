I see faces in the sky
Of sad forgotten souls
Low-down, decaying joy
No hope to keep me whole

No breeze to comfort me
No love to save my mood
Sunlight present to me
Unbranded solitude

How many times can I ignore
The Devil standing at my door
How many times can I forgive
I want to die, but still I live

Too many thoughts demanding
What's a man to do
Too many pains of old
Call out the pains of new

I squeeze my head so hard
To force the demons out
Dark angels laugh at me
And all that I'm about

How many times can I ignore
The Devil standing at my door
How many times can I forgive
I want to die, but still I live

I can't go on
I hate myself
I can't let go
Of what I am

A poison mind corrupts
The fabric of my soul
I rip apart the script
But still I play the role

How many times can I ignore
The Devil standing at my door
How many times can I forgive
I want to die but still I live

How many times can I ignore
The Devil standing at my door
How many times can I forgive
I want to die but still I live

I can't go on
I hate myself
I can't let go
Of what I am

I can't go on
I hate myself
I can't let go
Of what I am
