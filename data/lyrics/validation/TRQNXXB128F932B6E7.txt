Wanna be good, yes, I want to
Make you feel good because I need to
When you're not here, I wanna see you
And make you feel good, yes, I need to

Say thank you
I wanna thank you (Pretty lady)
Thank you
You know I gotta thank you (Pretty lady)

Cant help but smile thinkin' 'bout you
Wouldnt wanna have to live without you
Wandering lost until I met you
You showed me the way I cant forget to

Run away to your heart
Gonna find a way
Wanna run away to your heart
Gonna find a way

I gotta thank you
Thank you (Pretty lady)
I really wanna thank you
I gotta thank you (Pretty lady)

Gonna run away to your heart
Wanna find a way
Wanna run away to your heart
Gonna find a way
