Spirit of the sands
On vast and empty land
Where no one belongs

When the blue gets dark
At the failing light
Between moon and sun

In the desert fields
(A) Fever's so high
Makes me want to shout

Sahara night

(tut tut tut...)

Listen to the wind
Bringing into your ears
Music from afar

You may hear the sounds
Of a tribal dance
Coming from the heights

In the desert fields
Fever's so high
Makes me wanna shout

Sahara... Sahara night
Sahara night!

(Owoo owoo...)

And stars screen
The awful mystery of space
With its weight of fear

I now realize
The hold it has on me

(Owoo owoo...)

I love to watch the sky
Smiling at the stars
Laying on the ground

Gentle is the breeze
Hope it never cease
Soothing my mind

In the desert fields
Fever so high
Makes me wanna shout

Sahara... Sahara night
Sahara night!

(Owoo owoo...)

Oh, Sahara night
Uh, Makes me feel, makes me feel
So right

Sahara night
Makes me feel, makes me feel
So right
