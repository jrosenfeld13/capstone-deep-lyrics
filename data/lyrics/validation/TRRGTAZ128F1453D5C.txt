[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
Oh no, it happened again
She's cool, she's hot, she's my friend
I'd drive for hours it's so
You leave me nowhere to go

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
She's unstoppable, unpredictable
I'm so jaded, calculated wrong
Please take me home
Too late, it's gone
I bet you're sad
This is the best time we ever had

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Buy hope, hope that it lasts
Give in, forget the past
Be strong when things fall apart
Honest, this breaks my heart

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
She's unstoppable, unpredictable
I'm so jaded, calculated wrong
Please take me home
Too late, it's gone
I bet you're sad
This is the best time we ever had

[Verse 3 - Tom DeLonge]
Why did we have to go date?
It's too easy to complicate
Be strong when things fall apart
(be strong when things fall apart)
Honest, this breaks my heart
(it's so hard)
Let's go!

[Outro - Tom DeLonge]
Please take me home
Too late, it's gone
I bet you're sad
This is the best time we ever had

Please take me home
Too late, it's gone
I bet you're sad
This is the best time we ever had
