I count to three and grin, you smile and let me in
We sit and watch the wall you painted purple
Speech will spill on space, our little cups of grace
But pauses rattle on about the way

That you cut the snow-fence, braved the blood, the metal of those hearts
That you always end up pressing your tongue to
How your body still remembers things you told it to forget
How those furious affections followed you

I've got this store-bought way of saying I'm okay
And you learned how to cry in total silence
We're talented and bright, we're lonely and uptight
We've found some lovely ways to disappoint

But the airport's always almost empty this time of the year
So let's go play on a baggage carousel
And set our watches forward like we're just arriving here
From a past we left in a place we knew too well

Knew too well
Knew too well

Hold on to the corners of today
And we'll fold it up to save until it's needed
Stand still, let me scrub that brackish line
That you got when something rose and then receded

Hold on
