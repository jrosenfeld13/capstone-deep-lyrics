[Verse 1]
Making stars out of ordinary people
Doesn't make any sense
And if you're that fascinated with the boy next door
Then why don't you climb over the fence?
Big Brother, X Factor
I used to be a celebrity
I am fully prepared to eat a spider
If you put me on the TV

[Chorus]
We should be ashamed of ourselves
It's only 'cause we watch this shit
That they keep on making more of it
We should be ashamed of ourselves
It's only 'cause we watch this shit
That they keep on making more and more of it
(It's only 'cause we watch)

[Verse 2]
Why in God's name do we celebrate mediocrity?
Who in their right minds would aspire to being ordinary?
Fame Academy, Pop Idol
It's making me suicidal
Love Island, Hell's Kitchen
Every contestant is a waste of skin

[Chorus]
We should be ashamed of ourselves
It's only' cause we watch this shit
That they keep on making more of it
We should be ashamed of ourselves
It's only 'cause we watch this shit
That they keep on making more and more and more and more of it

[Solo]
It's fucking shit, yeah

[Chorus]
We should be ashamed of ourselves
It's only 'cause we watch this shit
That they keep on making more of it
We should be ashamed of ourselves
(It's only 'cause we watch this shit) Oh yeah
We should be ashamed, so ashamed
It's only 'cause we watch this shit
That they keep on making more and more and more and more
And more and more and more and more
And more and more and more, yeah
