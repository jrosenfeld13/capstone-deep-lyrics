My days are numbered down on my life
I know I can't quite make it
You've got your crown, so quit your fucking around
I've broken you, you've broken me

Now, I'm alone
I've broken you, you've broken me
Now, I'm alone
I've broken you, you've broken me

You let the killer kill me tonight
Wounded, I'm down on my knees
You hang 'round me like a fucking disease
I've broken you, you've broken me

Now, I'm alone
I've broken you, you've broken me
Now, I'm alone
I've broken you, you've broken me

Yeah, I know this world has got me down, it's on my shoulders
Black and bruised, I go insane (I go insane)
And now this world has got me down, it's all but over
Black and bruised, I go insane (I go insane)

Yeah my mind is gone, it's so fucking lost
So please get out of my head
You've leeched on me like a fucking disease
I've broken you, you've broken me

Now, I'm alone
I've broken you, you've broken me
Now, I'm alone
I've broken you, you've broken me

Yeah, I know this world has got me down, it's on my shoulders
Black and bruised, I go insane (I go insane)
And now this world has got me down, it's all but over
Black and bruised, I go insane (I go insane)

I go insane
I go insane
I go insane
I go insane

I go insane

I've broken you
I've broken you
I've broken you
I've broken you, you've broken me
