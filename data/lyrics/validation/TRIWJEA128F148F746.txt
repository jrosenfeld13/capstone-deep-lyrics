Will you still love me in December?
I could sleep many days, and it
Wouldn't make a difference
Without you
Without you

Seems I have forgotten it all
What was to forget
So you finally said I could leave, but I
Didn't want to leave then
Without you
Without you

Will you still love me in December?
I could sleep many days, and it
Wouldn't make a difference
Without you
Without you
