How many days have I felt like this?
How strong am I?

It feels so good to be free
I want you to know
How I feel

You take me from the madness, the awe-inspiring sadness
Take me to the places where the air is clean
Fill my heart with wonder, awake me from my slumber
Toss me to the ocean like a sinking stone

Could be a city thing
Could be a blues thing
Could be a country thing
Could be the real thing

Took a walk over the rocks on the beach
And I was thinking of all the things I have and can never be
And I was dreaming lazily on your head as I
Watched the sunset

You take me from the madness, the awe-inspiring sadness
Show me places that I need to know
Roll me to the ocean, like a stone I will just fall in (I've been drowning)
Heaven knows where this love will go

Could be a city thing
Could be a blues thing
Could be a country thing
Could be the real thing

Could be a city thing
Could be a blues thing
Could be a country thing
Could be the me thing

Think
Could be a blues thing

Think
Could be the real thing

You take me from the madness, the awe-inspiring sadness
Take me to the places where the air is clean (and I've been drowning)
Fill my heart with wonder, wake me from my slumber (I've been sleeping)
Toss me to the ocean like a sinking stone (and I've been drowning)

Lift me out this logic
Leaves my heart grounded (I've been sleeping)
Take me to the places where the air is clean (and I've been drowning)
Meet me at the fountain, the one set in the garden (will you come bless me?)
I'll wash your hands as you just stand
Stand by me

Stand by me

My, my, my, my, my, my, my, mahma
You're real fine

Step back
Said you're really fine
Said you're really fine
Stand back
Said you're really fine
Said you're really fine

Yeah, yeah, yeah (said you're really fine)

Devotion
Kick the switch, babe
We're gone

City thing (devotion)
Could be a blues thing (said you're really fine)
Could be a country thing
A blues thing
A country thing
A city thing
Could be a blues thing
Country thing (step back)
A blues thing (you're really fine)

Ground control (devotion)
I've got a love you can hold

Devotion
