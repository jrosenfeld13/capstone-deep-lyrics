It's a monument valley of concrete
On the plain where the styrofoam roams
She hits the trail by the charity store
For the cavern of the mobile phones
She wades ankle deep across whino creek
To the rail where the stagecoach waits
And there should be one in a day or so
If it isn't running late
'Cause she lives on a reservation
With a baby called 'shut up and wait'
And the missionary school by the alehouse
Is teaching him how to hate
In Loserville...Loserville
It's 15 miles outside of luck
They live on beer and pills
Now she takes him over to grandma's
Because her cousin gets back tonight
All day he's been out hunting
And they're gonna do the thing with the pipe
'Cause her man is a long time missing
He got lost in the firewater fight
Sometimes she hears him when the moon is out

Screaming at the door in the night
In Loserville...Loserville
It's 15 miles outside of luck
They live on beer and pills
Loserville...Loserville
A couple of lifetimes out of hope
Out there over the hill
It's the fastest growing false economy
The capitol of welfare state
They built a wall around Loserville
But they didn't build a gate
I spent half my life getting out of this place
It's everybody's well-laid plan
You can take the boy out of Loserville
But you can't take the place from the man
Loserville...Loserville
It's 15 miles outside of luck
You live on beer and pills
Loserville...Loserville
A couple of lifetimes out of hope
Out there over the hill
