You thought, you knew me, I proved you wrong
Never saw, it coming, now feel my scorn
My grasp will tighten around the ones I seek
Deceiver of many, I shall ensnare the weak

So contemptuous, and so malign
So righteous, and so divine
Releasing my force, I hear the cries
Devastate the angelic, watch the shadows rise

Breathing wrath with tongues of fire
Breaking the frail with ferocious desire
Lashing out havoc with hands of iron
Unveiling death with this poison soul

The Devil's in me, we are one
Guiding our hearts, leading us all
Tempt the masses, my demons rage
I am the chosen whose victims will fall

Laying waste to all
With my wicked fever
The demons are in me
We are one
