Ohh, I'm standing on a bank
Of the bayou, too much to drink
Yes, I'm standing on a bank
Of the bayou, too much to drink, yeah
I've been waiting all the night
And through out the day, babe
No one in sight

I spent the whole night drinking some wine
I was thinking about you all of the time
There's some thoughts are coming through my mind
I know it's only a matter of time
'Til you come walking down the bank
Of the bayou, too much to drink

I spent the whole night drinking some wine
I was thinking about you, baby, all of the time
There's some thoughts are running through my mind
Yes, I know it's only a matter of time
'Til you come walking down the bank
Of the bayou, babe, too much to drink

Ohh, I'm searching all up and down
For my baby, no where to be found
