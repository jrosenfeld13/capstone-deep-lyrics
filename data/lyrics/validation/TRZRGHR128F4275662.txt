Experimenting on the innocent, destroying their lives to cover up your worthless hide
I can feel the pain, my anger, still remains, I'll never let you... Live it down
Rage of the souls that you have devoured, seers through my heart To fuel my power
Hate for humankind, how can you sleep at night knowing what you have done in the passing of a day?
How many innocent creatures must pay For the luxury of your life?
I cannot see, refuse to believe, I won't stand for it anymore
In the name of humanity, I beg you, to open your eyes and see the evil, the murder, you commit day after day
You may be able to live with yourself... But can you deal with me?
