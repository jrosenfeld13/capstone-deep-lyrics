I just want to get some satisfaction
I just can't stand this kind of situation, yeah
I just want to get some good satisfaction
Yeah oh yeah

Whoa my people can't you see
We were brought down here down here
Down there in captivity

So much sorrow and whoa so much pain
This I know every day things won't be the
Same
So I just want to get some good satisfaction
1 just can't stand this war-like situation yeah
I just want to get some good satisfaction
Yeah oh yeah

Sometimes I wish that my tongue could speak out clearly
Thoughts that arrive in me
Sometime when I can't- find the peace of mind
I just want to get some satisfaction
I tell you long time, yeah
I just can't stand this war-like situation
I just want to get some good satisfaction
Yeah oh

Now is the time of decision
I tell you long time
And they can't stop us from fight this fight of freedom
My word as my weapon
So tell it along: I 'm a soldier in Jah army
I just want to get some good satisfaction
I just can't stand this warlike situation
I just want to get some good
Satisfaction...
