Born in the year of the cat
Taught to fight for what you want
Razed in fire and ash
Tonight there's no turning back

The city screams your destiny
There's no gravity
High in your flying machine
Watch over me
Where are you now?
Are you feeling well or are you breaking down

I know how alone you feel so far away
While they pretend to remember you
Laika, I'll make you proud
Is Laika coming home? Laika
Please come home
