Draw your blade and strike - for in this war all are forced to choose a side
None will the truth discerned; our heroes fall yet we only keep marching
Seek out your foe and leave them dead in their sleep
Show them no mercy; they have not the right of transformation
And if you stray too far from the path you'll be counted among the dead
Ashes
For we consider them dead who can't already see the truth - after all this is war
Their value was lost once their minds willed to stand
Burning ashes
Awake Vesuvius - leave us forever changed or leave us forever in ashes
This pain we bear - must we still forge our weapons?
This pain we bear - when will we lay down our weapons?
Curse the priests then preach of revolution; dressed in apocalyptic robes
Smile acceptance and extend your hand; while the other grabs for stones
Self-righteousness can take on many forms but the only end is to condemn
Reification is devolution - enlightenment is dominance
Denial of transformation
Rejected, despised - you are the pearl of creation
Rejected, despised - I am the pearl of creation
Rejected, despised - we are the pearl of creation
We're not just faces and names - we're flesh covered in flames
