[Chorus 1]
You are my only one, you are my only one
Well I'm telling you now, you're my only one

[Verse 1]
I've got two long legs like to carry me
Two sharp eyes to look for the fight
Two strong arms to hold on tight
Two good friends on my left and right, but only one only one

[Chorus 2]
And You are my only one, you are my only one
Don't be leaving me now, you're my only one

[Verse 2]
There's only one road before me
Too many turns in the way, thousands of things to do today
Millions of moments, I must admit, but only one, only one

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
Taken for granted and pushed aside
All that it wanted was a place to run and hide
Missing message in a hollow tree, hidden deep inside a memory
And the memory seems like dreams
Hundreds of hopes in the past, nevertheless it was never the last
Hold on strong or you fade out fast and only one only one

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
