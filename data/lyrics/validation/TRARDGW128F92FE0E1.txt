Walking through this wasteland
Carrying wicked thoughts within my mind
Wondering what will be
Is there any future for mankind?
War is raging somewhere
Every second someone will die
Evil spirits in towers
Magnifying holes in the sky

I can hear them crying
Starving people who have no face
There's no time to help them
For I'm coming to the end of my days

I am falling
But it feels good, yeah!
All right!

There's no time to cry when it's all over!
Respect the clear vision of mighty Doomsower!

People full of hatred
Leading everyone's life to Hell
How long has it been so?
From the dawn of man I can tell!
Angels and demons
Are fighting for our souls, can't you see?
The answer is in your hand
Just choose the way you wanna be

And live free
By the side of your god
