-Intro-

Oh whoa......oh whoa......
Oh whoa......oh whoa......
Oh whoa......oh whoa......

Everybody was kung-fu fighting
Those kicks were fast as lighting
In fact it was a little bit frightening
But they fought with expert timing

They were funky china man, from funky china town
They were chopping men up, they were chopping men down

It's an ancient chinese art and everybody knew their part

From a fainting to a slip and a kicking from the hip

Everybody was kung-fu fighting huh!
Those kicks were fast as lighting
In fact it was a little bit frightening yeah, yeah
But they fought with expert timing

There was funky Billy Chen and little Sammy Chong
He said, here comes the big boss! (Where?) lets get it on
We took them all and made a stand, started swaying with the hands
Sudden motion made me skip, now were into a brand new trick

Everybody was kung-fu fighting huh!
Those kicks were fast as lighting hah!
In fact it was a little bit frightening huh!
But they fought with expert timing hah!

Oh whoa......huh!
Oh whoa......hah!
Oh whoa......huh!
Oh whoa......hah!

Kung-fu fighting, It's as fast as lighting
