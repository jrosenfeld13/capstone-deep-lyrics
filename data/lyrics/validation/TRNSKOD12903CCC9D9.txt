Now he's got those stars in his eyes
Pulled down from the midnight sky
And it ain't gonna be like you thought it was
But it, could be like you make it now
Shoulda please
Take a step back for me
What the hell did you come all the way down to be?
I know you don't see it
But I do
So keep on moving and I'll walk with you
And we can zipcord across the sky
You and I
Now how hard do I have to try
To find somebody like me
Little more like me
Cause I feel like giving up
We can zipcord across the sky
You and I
Now how hard do I have to try
To find somebody like me
Little more like me
Cause I feel like giving up

I wanna turn us all around
Now
Take a step down
How can we all get along
When we're so violent and young?

I wanna turn us all around
Now
Take a step down
How can we all get along
When we're so violent and young?

Hold me back
I think I'm bout to blow
Hit me here, then you know
It's not a question about getting the message
It's been a while since you been so progressive
Let's keep it in the crowd, amongst ourselves
We the only mofuckas getting it and no one else
So lets take the train
Drive really far away
We ain't never gunna stop
We ain't never gunna stay
We can zipcord across the sky
You and I
Now how hard do I have to try
To find somebody like me
Little more like me
Cause I feel like giving up
We can zipcord across the sky
You and I
Now how hard do I have to try
To find somebody like me
Little more like me
Cause I feel like giving up

I wanna turn us all around
Now
Take a step down
How can we all get along
When we're so violent and young?

I wanna turn us all around
Now
Take a step down
How can we all get along
When we're so violent and young?

I waved goodbye to a place where everybody knew my name
Left my blue-eyed girl
Starring out the window
In the rain
Told her when I met her
That I had to hit the road
Now I wish I never met her
Cause I cannot let her go
Hearts break
But that's alright with me
Cause I only left room so I could ride with three
And we're taking a trip
We ain't turning around
So please don't try to bring me down

We got bottles to hold
Our motto is gold
Never back down
This ain't easy so
Get a nice grip
And hold on for the ride
If you can't take it
Better jump for your life
And watch out and be ready to hurdle
We got sharks around
And they're starting to circle
All around my feet
They're biting on my shoes
It's a little knick-knack
And it all comes back

I wanna turn us all around
Now
Take a step down
How can we all get along
When we're so violent and young?

I wanna turn us all around
Now
Take a step down
How can we all get along
When we're so violent and young?

I wanna turn us all around
Now
Take a step down
How can we all get along
When we're so violent and young?

I wanna turn us all around
Now
Take a step down
How can we all get along
When we're so violent and young?

I wanna turn us all around
Now
Take a step down
How can we all get along
When we're so violent and young?

I wanna turn us all around
Now
Take a step down
How can we all get along
When we're so violent and young?

I wanna turn us all around
Now
Take a step down
How can we all get along
When we're so violent and young?

I wanna turn us all around
Now
Take a step down
How can we all get along
When we're so violent and young?

We can zipcord across the sky
You and I
Now how hard do I have to try
To find somebody like me
Little more like me
Cause I feel like giving up
Get a nice grip
And hold on for the ride
If you can't take it
Better jump for your life
To find somebody like me
Little more like me
Cause I feel like giving up
