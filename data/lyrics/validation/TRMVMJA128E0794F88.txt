[Verse 1: Helen Marnie]
Destroy everything you touch today
Destroy me this way
Anything that may desert you
So it cannot hurt you

[Chorus: Helen Marnie]
You only have to look behind you
At who's underlined you
Destroy everything you touch today
Destroy me this way

[Refrain: Helen Marnie]
Everything you touch you don't feel
Do not know what you steal
Shakes your hand
Takes your gun
Walks you out of the sun

[Chorus 2: Helen Marnie]
What you touch you don't feel
Do not know what you steal
Destroy everything you touch today
Please destroy me this way

[Verse 2: Helen Marnie]
Destroy everything you touch today
Destroy me this way
Anything that may delay you
Might just save you

[Chorus: Helen Marnie]
You only have to look behind you
At who's underlined you
Destroy everything you touch today
Destroy me this way

[Refrain: Helen Marnie]
Everything you touch you don't feel
Do not know what you steal
Shakes your hand
Takes your gun
Walks you out of the sun

[Chorus 2: Helen Marnie]
What you touch you don't feel
Do not know what you steal
Destroy everything you touch today
Please destroy me this way

[Refrain: Helen Marnie]
Everything you touch you don't feel
Do not know what you steal
Shakes your hand
Takes your gun
Walks you out of the sun

[Chorus 2: Helen Marnie]
What you touch you don't feel
Do not know what you steal
Destroy everything you touch today
Please destroy me this way

[Refrain: Helen Marnie]
Everything you touch you don't feel
Do not know what you steal
Shakes your hand
Takes your gun
Walks you out of the sun

[Chorus 2: Helen Marnie]
What you touch you don't feel
Do not know what you steal
Destroy everything you touch today
Please destroy me this way
