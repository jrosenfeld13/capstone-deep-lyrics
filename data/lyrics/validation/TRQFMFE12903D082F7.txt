I was a young man in a hurry
I didn't stop to think
The next thing I knew I was in trouble - deep trouble
Then I remember what aunt Linda used to tell me back in the day
The words that she said are still in my head, she said

The choices you make might be mistakes
But it's never too late to turn around, turn around
The road that you take might lead you astray
But don't be afraid to turn around, turn around

I knew a young man named Charlie
He went and lost his way
Now he's in prison, cold prison
No chance to escape
They gave him new clothes and a Bible, and the Word he did read
Now the four walls can't keep him 'cause Charlie is free

The choices you make might be mistakes
But it's never too late to turn around, turn around
The road that you take might lead you astray
But don't be afraid to turn around, turn around

You might be in trouble
You might be running
But it's never too late to turn around
'cause as long as you're still breathing
There'll always be enough time
To make the right decision before you die, because

The choices you make might be mistakes
But it's never too late to turn around, turn around
The road that you take might lead you astray
But don't be afraid to turn around, turn around
