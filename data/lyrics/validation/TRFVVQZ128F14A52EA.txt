We left for Frisco in your Rambler
The radiator running dry
I've never been much of a gambler
And had a preference to fly

You said, forget about the airline
Let's take the car and save the fare
We blew a gasket on the Grapevine
And eighty dollars on repairs

All aboard (Sausalito summernight)
All aboard

Hot summer night in Sausalito
Can't stand the heat another mile
Let's drop a quarter in the meter
And hit the sidewalk for a while

I'll have a burger and a root beer
You feed the heap some multi-grade
A shot of premium to boot, dear
We'll get across the Golden Gate

All aboard (Sausalito summernight)
All aboard (Sausalito summernight)
All aboard (Sausalito summernight)
All aboard

Another mile or two to Frisco
Two hundred gallons from L.A
The engine's thumpin' like a disco
We ought to dump her in the bay

All aboard (Sausalito summernight)
All aboard

Cashin' all my checks, scrapin' out my bank
Spend it on a Rambler with a whirlpool in the tank
Look out over here, watch out over there
Can't afford a blowout 'cause we haven't got a spare

All aboard (Sausalito summernight)
All aboard (Sausalito summernight)
All aboard (Sausalito summernight)
All aboard

Hot summer night in Sausalito (Sausalito summernight)
Hot summer night in Sausalito (Sausalito summernight)
Hot summer night in Sausalito (Sausalito summernight)
Hot summer night in Sausalito (Sausalito summernight)
Hot summer night in Sausalito (Sausalito summernight)
Hot summer night in Sausalito (Sausalito summernight)
