There's an infinity of ways
And just as many people striving for them, oh
Who's to say what is wrong or right
Only we can judge what lies within us
It's our code of life

So much is counting on what we say
So many virtues that we must weigh
Where's the light we long for
Love must find a way
And all things in their time will follow, oh....

It's like a wave of honor in motion
Floating away
It's like an overwhelming emotion
One and the same
If we take the time to find it
We can help define a way
Uncharted

Code of ethics, feel it
Stand, be counted
Life is only what we make it
So don't fake it
Just make it right

Like a visionary's dream
There's a cry for truth we need to know
Is it life or a novel's theme
Underlying codes we'd live or die for
It's a mystery

Violence is growing, it's in the air
People are starving while others stare
Where's the light we long for?

Love must find a way
And all things in their time will follow - oh
If we take the time to find it
We can help define a way
Uncharted

Code of ethics, feel it
Stand, be counted
Life is only what we make it
So don't fake it
Just make it right

Code of ethics, live it
Stand, be counted
Life is only what we make it
So don't fake it
Just make it right
