Since I still tell you my every day
My darling, I think you always hear me
From the sweet away, the sweet away
Did you see us picnicking at lakeside
In the state park today?
All these things I want you to be part of
Darling, you'll be

One song singing through this neighborhood
Is loneliness
Since I still tell you my everyday
I think you hear
With a perfect vision now
Oh with a perfect ear
To me
All my life I don't find anyone like you

I wish you'd be at Bethany
I wish you'd come to violin with me
Since I still tell you my every day
All these things I want you to be part of
Darling, you'll be
