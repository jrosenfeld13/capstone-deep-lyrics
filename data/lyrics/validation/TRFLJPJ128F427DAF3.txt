[Verse 1]
Baby listen, everytime you asked me
I gave you my invitation for one night
But you never thought of me more then twice

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause there ain't nothing that I could speak
You give and you take then your done with me

[Chorus]
I sit in the blues, waiting for you, who I'll never see
There's never good news no not bout you
Cause something don't feel right
There's nothing to choose I can't refuse my turn to try
I guess I lose boy ain't that right

[Verse 2]
I'd hate to lie, my friend don't deny
Cause what you see real even though you can't feel
Count back from 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 times
You'd say you'd drop by, but I'm a fool everytime

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
The way I feel
And what I know
Cause I can't explain
What's going down
The way I feel
And what I know
Cause I can't explain
Why I can't let go
