Of all the things that you do best
Disaster makes you happiest
So burn the clothes that you are in
They stink of smoke and sweat and skin

And you cry 'cos I'm so calm inside
You scream, you sob, "I'll run, I'll hide"
And still we have no answer to
The question: What do we do?

Oh, let's stop hanging out
Let's stop hanging fun
Stand in the corner
And think about what you've done

Oh it's easy to over simplify
When you are not involved
And I get so angry when someone can say
"The answer's there - as clear as day!"

And there is a possibility
That you could still cling on to me
'Cos you're filled with such regret
But oh you must have had your reasons

Oh, let's stop hanging out
Let's stop having fun
Stand in the corner
And think about what you've done
Oh, let't stop hanging out
Let's stop having fun
You deserve to be with no one!
No one!
No one!
No one!

Let's stop hanging out
Let's stop having fun
Let's stop hanging out
Let's stop having fun
Let's stop hanging out
Let's stop having fun
Let's stop hanging out
Let's stop having fun
Let's stop hanging out
Let's stop having fun
Let's stop hanging out
Let's stop having fun
Let's stop hanging out
Let's stop having fun
Let's stop hanging out
Let's stop having fun

Yeah right!
Yeah!

Of all the things that you do best
Of all the things that you do best
Of all the things that you do best
Of all the things that you do best

Let's stop hanging out!
Yeah, yeah, yeah let's stop hanging out!
Let's stop hanging out!
Let's stop, let's stop hanging out!
