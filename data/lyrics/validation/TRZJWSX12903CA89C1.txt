[Verse 1]
Looking out the door I see the rain fall upon the funeral mourners
Parading in a wake of sad relations
As their shoes fill up with water
Maybe I'm too young
To keep good love from going wrong
But tonight you're on my mind so you never know

[Verse 2]
I'm broken down and hungry for your love with no way to feed it
Where are you tonight?
You know how much I need it
Too young to hold on
And too old to break free and run

[Pre-Chorus/Hook]
Sometimes a man he gets carried away
When he feels like he should be having his fun
And he's much too blind to see the damage he's done
Cause sometimes a man must awake
To find that really he has no one

[Chorus]
So I'll wait for you and I'll burn
Will I ever see your sweet return
Oh will I ever learn
Oh lover, you should've come over
Cause it's not too late

[Verse 3]
Lonely is the room, the bed is made
The open window lets the rain in
Burning in the corner is the only one
Who dreams he had you with him
My body turns and yearns for a sleep that won't ever come

[Pre-Chorus/Hook]
Sometimes a man he gets carried away
When he feels like he should be having his fun
And he's much too blind to see the damage he's done
Cause sometimes a man must awake
To find that really he has no one

[Chorus/Outro]
So I'll wait for you and I'll burn
Oh will I ever see your sweet return
Oh will I ever learn
Oh lover, you should've come over
Cause it's not too late
Cause it's not too late
