Eighties, I'm living in the eighties
Eighties, I have to push, I have to struggle
Eighties, get out of my way, I'm not for sale no more
Eighties, let's kamikaze till we get there

And we sang
You do it this way

Eighties, by day we run by night we dance, we do
Eighties, I'm in love with the coming race
Eighties, I've got the best, I'll take all I can get
Eighties, I'm living for the eighties

Eighties, I'm living in the eighties, I push
Eighties, I'm living
Eighties, I'm living in the eighties, I struggle
Eighties, I'm living

Eighties, I'm living
Eighties, I'm living in the eighties
Eighties, I'm living in the eighties, I push
Eighties, push, push, struggle

Eighties, I'm living
Eighties, eighties, I'm living
Eighties, I'm living in the eighties, I push
Eighties, push, push, struggle
