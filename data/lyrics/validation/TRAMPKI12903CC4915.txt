My daddy always was a gentleman
Never the kind who ever forced his hand
He would always be the last one to raise his voice
If anybody ever put us down
Well, you can bet that he would stand his ground
And he would tell me "Son, sometimes you got no choice."

You got to kick a little
Cause a stir
Sometimes you've gotta make some noise to be heard
If anybody ever tries to hold you back
You got to kick a little
Be tough
You got to let 'em know you've had enough
Remember that unless you wanna finish last
You got to kick a little

Some people judge you by the way you look
They see you once and say you ain't no good
Feels like they're never gonna take you for who you are
That's when you have to stand up and be strong
And go the extra mile to prove 'em all wrong
Just remember when they push you way too far

You got to kick a little
Cause a stir
Sometimes you've gotta make some noise to be heard
If anybody ever tries to hold you back
You got to kick a little
Be tough
You got to let 'em know you've had enough
Remember that unless you wanna finish last
You got to kick a little

You got to kick a little
Cause a stir
Sometimes you've gotta make some noise to be heard
If anybody ever tries to hold you back
You got to kick a little
Be tough
You got to let 'em know you've had enough
Remember that unless you wanna finish last
You got to kick a little
