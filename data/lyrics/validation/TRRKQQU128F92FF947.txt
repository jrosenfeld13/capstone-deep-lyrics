Infinite open eternity eternally
Just let it happen one hundred percent moment
Say fear is good 'cause
That's how you know where you've got to break through
Yourself, misunderstood
Why should you even care?
You're scared of you

Before you know it, you're like "don't, don't, don't stop
Don't, don't, don't stop"
Bend over Beethoven
Tell mother the news

It don't matter what it means
Everybody knows that life's a dream
