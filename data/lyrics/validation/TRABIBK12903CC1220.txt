Alright Dave
So where is this place anyway?
Well it's in a secret location
You just gotta ring this number
Right. So who's gonna be there?
Well I dunno
So what's it all about then?

It's a rave dave (x4)
Just lots of people in a room
Spreadin love and listenin to choons
It's a rave dave!
So what do I have to do then?
Just have a laugh and stand around
Bob your head round up and down
Stomp your feet upon the ground
To the kit drum as it sounds
Throw your hands up in the air
And maybe give a little cheer
Go to the bar and get a beer
Go speak to that dude over there

And then my friend will sort you out
Cos that's what raves are all about!
