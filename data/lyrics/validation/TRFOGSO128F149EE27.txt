Heyy Ohh Ohhhh
Don't worry babygirl
You don't have to say a word
You know I'll be there

And if you should ever need
A shoulder you can cry on
I'm the one you can rely on

I don't mess around or play the game
I give it to you straight
You're the only one for me

Listen to me good now what I say
You can trust in me forever
I don't wanna be anything but your everything
Just have faith in me forever
I will be the one you need

When everything's going your way
And everything locks in place
It's easy to say
That I need to prove to you
When the dark cloud keeps rolling through
Ain't nothing in the world gonna change my love for you

I don't mess around or play the game
I give it to you straight
You're the only one for me

Listen to me good now what I say
You can trust in me forever
I don't wanna be anything but your everything
Just have faith in me forever
I will be the one you need

I will be the one you need
I will be the one you need
Oh I will be the on you need
Oh I will be the on you need

I will be the one you need
Cause I will give you all of me
Anytime you call me girl I'll be around

I will be the one you need
Oh I will be the one you need
Ooooh be the one you need
Be the one you need
Oh I will be the one you know I can be the one you need

Cause I can be
Cause I can be the one you need
