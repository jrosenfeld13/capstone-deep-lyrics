For 20 years i acted so selfish
Pushed u away and took u for granted
You taught me so much about loyaltyand love
Ill never forget how much u put me above yourself

Im really sorry mom ive been a rotten son
Im really feeling bad youve been my mom and dad
Im really sorry mom ive been a rotten son

You sold your soul so i could eat
You blocked the dark so i could read
You worked your fingers to the bone

You stood by me through all the tears
You bailed me out when no one did

Its matters regardless of what u say or do
It matter it matters to me
