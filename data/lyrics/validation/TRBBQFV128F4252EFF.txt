[Verse 1]
Your voice is adrift
I can't expect it to sing to me
As if I was the only one

[Chorus]
I'll follow you
The leaf that's following the sun
When will my weight be too much for you?
When will these ideas really be my own?
Because this moment keeps on moving
We were never meant to hold on

[Verse 2]
This was a scene worth waking up for
When I woke up
You planted me in my own pot
Don't know why
But somehow it just feels so wrong

When you're sad, I will be lonely
But when you rise again I'll have become the sun
I will shine down upon you
As if you were the only one

Your voice is your own, I can't protect it
You'll have to sing
A verse no one has ever known

[Chorus]
