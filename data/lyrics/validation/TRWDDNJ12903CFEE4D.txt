A simple path
The road less traveled
Pick up your map
Lay down your gavel

When all is said and done
Only love is on

Doubt drives this thirst and pain drives this hunger
But don't let the strife that drives your life tare you asunder

When all is said and done
Only love is on

And it's the only gift
That could ever cost so much and still be free
And my only wish
Is that it finds its home in the heart of you and me

Only love is on the page
When your days are over
Only love is

Everybody strung out and everybody friends
But there is no music without tension on the neck
For love is not unconditional unless conditions call upon it
It's not emotional to say you can't go on without it

When all is said and done
Only love is

It's the only gift
That could ever cost so much and still be free
And my only wish
Is that it finds its home in the heart of you and me

Only love is on the page
When your days are over
Only love is

Only love is on the page
When your days are over
When you're six feet under

Only love is on the page
When you close the curtain
Only love is

I know that you're scared, I know you've gone without
But the trial is what life has always been about
So I hope you find peace within the pain
When you see your life was not lived out in vain

When all is said and done
Only love is, only love is on
