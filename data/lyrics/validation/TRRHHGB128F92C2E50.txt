Well, I'm standing next to a mountain, chop it down with the edge of my hand
Pick up all the pieces, make an island, might even raise a little sand

'Cause I'm a voodoo chile, Lord knows I'm a voodoo chile

I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time
Give it right back to you one of these days
I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time
Give it right back to you the rest of my days

I won't see you again in this world, see you in the next one
Don't be late, don't be late

'Cause I'm a voodoo chile yeah, Lord knows I'm a voodoo chile
