Out in the yard there's a man stealing flowers from the garden
Claiming they're all his to take with a smile and a wink
And he's off until tomorrow, laughing all the way singing

Oh my, I've been on the wrong side
I thought you were out to get me
You never have me round for tea
I've never been the wrong type
But you know that sometimes people get the wrong idea about me

Sound the alarm, there's a man stealing flowers from the garden
And he's eyeing up the ones next door with a smile and a wink
And he's off until tomorrow, laughing all the way singing

Oh my, I've been on the wrong side
I thought you were out to get me
You never have me round for tea
I've never been the wrong type
But you know that sometimes people, they get the wrong idea about me

And then he pipes up, 'Knock me down'
With a feather from your cap and a leaf from your book
That I've never even looked at
I've been left, right, on the outside, inside, upside down to me
(Sound the alarm, there's a man stealing flowers from the garden
Laughing all the way singing,)

Oh my, I've been on the wrong side
I thought you were out to get me
You never have me round for tea
I've never been the wrong type
But you know that sometimes people, they get the wrong idea about me

Oh my, I've been on the wrong side
I thought you were out to get me
I should have had you round for tea
I've never been the wrong type
But you know that sometimes people get the wrong idea about me

I've never been the wrong type
But you know that sometimes people get the wrong idea about me
I've never been the wrong type
But you know that sometimes you might get the wrong idea about me

Get the wrong idea about me
Might get the wrong idea about me
Might get the wrong idea about me
Might get the wrong idea about me
