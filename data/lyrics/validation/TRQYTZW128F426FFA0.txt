The clock was ticking
Had no time to
Care about it
I had no options
Kept my mouth shut
I spend my days
Solving problems
I got ten thousand
Problems a day

The time is never right
Never have had the time
To bright up my life
Now i'm losing you
But maybe i just
Blame it on the time
That i can't give you
I remember times when
I was hooked on you too

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
I'm losing you
I'm losing you
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Bit by bit and it feels so good

I was thinking
'bout it when i
Hit the side walk
I've been picking on you
'cause i dislike you
I know you're gorgeous
But i'm tired of
Your sweet talk
You have always
Told me that
Your heart is made of gold

I'm losing you
I'm losing you
Bit by bit
And it feels so good
You smell nor taste
As good as before
Don't come back baby
Don't you come back

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
I'm losing you
I'm losing you
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Bit by bit and it feels so good
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
I'm losing you, i'm losing you
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Bit by bit and it feels so
