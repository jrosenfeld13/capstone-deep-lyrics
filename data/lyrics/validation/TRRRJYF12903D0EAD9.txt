Last night I had a dream: I saw you die
No one left a tear to cry
The wind was turning, your flag was burning
And we danced, we danced around the fire

It was a dream of hope, it was a dance of joy
The flames were burning high
Hand in hand we burned this land
And we danced, we danced around the fire

Your guilt came through, I saw the fool in me
Rechoice these times are by
Your time was gone, you tried to run
And we danced, we danced around the fire

Farewell to your lame excuses
I want an eye for an eye
Your feet were swaying in the wind
And we danced, we danced around the fire
