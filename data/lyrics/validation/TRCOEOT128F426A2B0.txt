There was a time
Eating your mind
Eating your heart and your soul
Down to the bone
Always alone
Nobody waiting at home

Now allow that we unite our fires
Shout it out
Give yourself to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Hell was made in heaven
I was made for you
Hell was made in heaven
Made for loving you in sin

Ten years ago
You made the vow
Promised your life and your love
Of all that you're paid
Nothing returned
What is enough is enough

Now allow that we unite our fires
Shout it out
Give yourself to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Hell was made in heaven
I was made for you
Hell was made in heaven
Made for loving you in sin
