You've got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we can make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I've got nothing to prove

You've got a fast car
I've got a plan to get us out of here
Been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I could both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living

See my old man he's got a problem
Lives with the bottle that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
Body's too young for looking like his
Mama went off and left him
Wanted more from life than he could give
She said somebody's got to take care of him
I quit school and that's what I did

You've got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We've got to make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
Had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You've got a fast car
We go cruising entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
Now I work in the market in the checkout line
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
Had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You've got a fast car
I've got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me'd find it
I got no plans and I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
Had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You've got a fast car
Is it fast enough so you can fly away?
You've got to make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way?

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
Had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
