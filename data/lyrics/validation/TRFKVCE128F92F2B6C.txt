Trouble in the streets means trouble in the home
Trouble in the home means nowhere to go
There's nothing to show for all the work
That has been done

Catch 22
You've been caught
What do you do

You mess up when it's going fine
So what's there to do in your spare time
It's up to you if you do the crime
But if you're caught you pay the fine
Then you're inside
