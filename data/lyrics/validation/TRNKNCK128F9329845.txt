Well the man upstairs always lends an ear
To the man downstairs, even though he doesn't care
The man up the spiral staircase would love to sympathise
With the man downstairs and the same old phrase

Big Muff, can't you see I've had enough?
God knows you're trying to kill me
Big Muff, get away with your powder puff
Lord knows you're killing me

It's like an allergy with no apology
It saps my energy and denies my integrity
Big Muff, get away with your powder puff
Lord knows you're killing me

Good Lord knows you're stifling me
Good Lord knows you're trying to kill me

Well the man upstairs has learned it from the wife
But the man downstairs has got trouble in his life
The man upstairs don't notice what is wrong
Every time he sees his neighbour singing that same old song

Big Muff, get away with your powder puff
Lord knows you're trying to kill me
Big Muff, get away with your terrible stuff
God knows you're killing me

This thing is dangerous
I tell you it's serious
No need to be envious
It's bigger than both of us

Big Muff, can't you see I had enough
Lord knows you're trying to kill me

Well, the man downstairs has moved away for good
Like the man upstairs always knew he would
The man downstairs has moved and gone away
And a girl upstairs every night can hear him say

Big Muff, get away with your powder puff
Lord knows you're killing me
Big Muff, can't you see I had enough
God knows you're stifling me

It's like an allergy
With no apology
It saps my energy
Most contemporaneously

Big Muff, can't you see that I've had enough
God knows you're stifling me
God knows you're stifling me
Oh Lord knows you're trying to kill me
