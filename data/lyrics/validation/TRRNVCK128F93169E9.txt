Be careful what you pray for... you might just get it
Don't try to be a hero
Or you'll regret it
Every little thing looks bad if you remember it
Wake up and smell the mildew
...Then just forget it

The wings of liberty have lost their feathers
The tide turns way too often
It's stormy weather
We waited long and hard
Hell bent for heather
How can one so empty
Remain together ever?

There are no pro's in prostitution
There is no rest in restituition
But there's always in's to the institution
I keep mute in my mutilation
Put up no fuss in my frustration

Don't try to be a hero
Or you'll regret it
Be careful what you pray for
You might just get it
We waited long and hard
Birds of a feather
How can two so empty
Remain together ever?

There are no pro's in prostitution
There is no rest in restituition
But there's always in's to the institution
I keep mute in my mutilation
Put up no fuss in my frustration

Shun... shun... shun

There are no pro's in prostitution
There is no rest in restituition
But there's always in's to the institution
I keep mute in my mutilation
Put up no fuss in my frustration
