[Intro]

[Verse 1 : Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
I got one life to live
You see, I'm stayin' up off the streets
Weed, Heineken drinkin', that Louie 13
It keeps a major league
Playa on that hustle type
Big baller with so much clap
Keys in my lap, police in the rearview
Put 'em on a high speed, then bail out
I'm not afraid cause I got heart
Runnin' through the woods to the graveyard
Helicopters on my trail, I slipped and fell
Plus it's gettin' dark
Now what do ya know ?
I heard two barrels cocking on my shoulder
They found the dope I was laying on
When they turned me over
I'm mad as fuck cause the cuffs tight on my hands
I'm takin' an ass whoopin', dreamin' for the ambulance
I'm in the squad car, depressed cause I'm caught with dirt
They finna hide my ass, I wonder is it worth it
I called on God, but his phone must be off the hook
I feel a evil spirit tellin' me to go out like a crook
And kick the window out, the paperboy he gone shoot to kill
I'm out of patience, I got one life to live

[Verse 2 : DJ Paul]
Stayin' on my fuckin' shoes
Livin' by them Three Six rules
Keepin' all Atlanta down
Bustas what you tryin' to prove ?
Smokin' green by the P's
Fuck what you sayin' punk
Prophet Posse get my back
Cristale is gettin' me drunk
Thangs still the same
Ain't gon' change
Like you Foster's beez
Niggas down one day and not the next
Nothin' but hoes to me
Playa brought you in this game
A playa take you out this thang
Stayin' real wit' you homies mane
It'll always bring a thang

[Verse 3 : Juicy J]
I only got one life to live but now I gotta get it straight
Tryna make a living in my city so don't playa hate
If you got a question how a Memphis nigga money flow
Shootin' craps, selling dope, kicking in niggas door
Ballin' down the strip with a trunk full of hot shit
Talkin' on the burner phone, bumpin' hutch, sweatin' the bitch
That's how we do it in the M-town
Niggas frowning all about my hustle
If you got no cheese don't come around

[Verse 4 : Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
Yeah, and like that 2Pac I feel death around the corner sometimes
I'm placed [?] fuck the fame, packing my nine
I'm in the street with my niggas I just laying bonbs
When I was locked up I got hooked up on a lumpsun
Of gang, from a [?] how they get my ass in ?
Help me feed my children that drought got me selling that dope again
I'm ballin' I'm tryna think of some legit to wash my money off
I'm gonna lose these streets, my back against the wall
Damn it feels good to be a Kingpin
I got a hook up from my cuz, nigga what, blow it up
No cut
A playa hata trippin' wit' that bull shit
The bird on my triple beam always weight 36
My word is bond, man to man, face to face
I'm on my way to incarceration with Fed times
Just watch my case
In front of my homies hoggin' that deck to see that I was real
Years, it's some motherfuckers with one life to live
