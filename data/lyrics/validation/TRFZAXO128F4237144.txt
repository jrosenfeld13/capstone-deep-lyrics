It's too late to say goodbye
Maybe things could work out right. no need to cry
And I won't let go
And you said you know
I remember times I had
Some were happy some were absolutely sad
But I believed in you
Sometimes feelin' blue... 'cause saturday rocks oh no...

No need for me to stay and lose
Ignoring me burned out and used
What can I say it's just too late
Ignoring me a real big pake
Cause saturday rocks, saturday rocks oh no...

I never wanted you to go
You went away I didn't mean to hurt you so
And we disagree
The best for you and me
Cause saturday rocks... oh no...

No need for me to stay and lose
Ignoring me burned out and used
What can I say it's just too late
Ignoring me a real big pake
- cause saturday rocks, saturday rocks oh no...

We disagree on everything everyone should be blamed
No need for me to stay and lose
Ignoring me burned out and used
Saturday rocks... oh no
