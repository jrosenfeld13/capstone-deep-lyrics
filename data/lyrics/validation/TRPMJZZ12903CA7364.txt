Can't trust the way, we messed up some things and
Cannot believe she's in disarray
It's all too easy to be cynical
I never wanted to be this fragile

You never talk about any substance
You only have a vague sense of shape
And on your way before consent
A song to sing with words, careless ignorance
Never content
(Never content)
