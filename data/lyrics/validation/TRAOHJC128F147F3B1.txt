[Verse 1]
Honey, it's getting close to midnight
And all the myths are still in town
True love and lipstick on your linen
Bite the pillow, make no sound
If there's some living to be done
Before your life becomes your tomb
You'd better know that I'm the one
So unchain your back door
Invite me around

[Chorus 1]
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
To the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go

[Chorus 1]
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
To the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go

Let her go!

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Honey, it's getting close to daybreak
The sun is creeping in the sky
No patent remedies for heartache
Just empty words and humble pie
So get down on your knees, honey
Assume an attitude
You just pray I'll be waiting
Cause you know, you know I'm coming soon

[Chorus 1]
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
To the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go

[Chorus 1]
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
To the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go

[Bridge]
So pick up your foolish pride
No going back
Nowhere, no way, no place to hide

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus 3]
Bring your daughter...
Bring your daughter...
Bring your daughter...
Bring your daughter...
Bring your daughter...
Bring your daughter...
Bring your daughter...
To the slaughter!

[Chorus 2]
Bring your daughter...
Fetch your daughter...
Bring your daughter...
Fetch your daughter...
Bring your daughter...
Fetch your daughter...
To the slaughter

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus 1]
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
To the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go

[Chorus 1]
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
To the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go

[Chorus 1]
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
To the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go

Gonna getcha!
