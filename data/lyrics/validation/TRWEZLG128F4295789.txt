It's not what you do, it's just the way that you do it
Makes me feel this way
It's not what I see, it's what I read in to looks been giving me
Now make no mistakes, (make no mistakes) I'm not sure
I can take anymore of this waiting game
If I had my way
(If I had my way) I'd like to hear you say
You kinda feel the same way to
So
When will you be mine, do I have to wait forever
When will you be mine do I have to wait forever,ever, ever
When will you be mine, when will you be mine, when will you be mine
It's not what you think , but when you take a drink
I feel this invitation
There's no need to worry, 'cause I'm in no hurry
I just want "that sensation"
I don't look for trouble, (don't look for trouble)
Sometimes that trouble, come looking for me, yeah

There's one thing that I want to do
Is take you out of here with me
So
When will you be mine, do I have to wait forever
When will you be mine, do I have to wait forever
When will you be mine
When will you be mine
When will you be mine, do I have to wait forever
When will you be mine, do I have to wait forever
When will you be mine, what's the problem I've got to know
When will you be mine, please don't keep me in suspense this way
When will you be mine, this waiting is killing me
When will you be mine, I can't stand your drinking all night
