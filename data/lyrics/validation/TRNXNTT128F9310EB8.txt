Get your back against the wall
Put your hands up Mr. small
I am here to set you straight
I dont have time to argue your way
I'll give you one more chance to get yourself off
I'll give you one more chance to tell me why you can't
You're trouble
Just trouble

So now your beating to my drum
Whats wrong sweet pea cats got your tongue
The more I begin to understand
The more I find you're such a bad man
I'll give you one more chance to come clean
To me
Ohhh give me one more chance to orchestrate a plan

You're trouble
Just trouble

Ohhh you have too much fun breaking all the rules
Ohhh maybe so much fun I just might break them too
You're trouble
Oooh just trouble
Oooh you're trouble
Mmm just trouble
