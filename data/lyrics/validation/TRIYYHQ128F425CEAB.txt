Oh come, oh come Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the son of God appear

Rejoice, rejoice Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, oh Israel

God rest ye merry gentlemen let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our Savior was born on Christmas Day
To save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy

God rest ye merry gentlemen let nothing you dismay
What child is this, who, laid to rest on Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping?

This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him laud
The babe, the son of Mary

So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh
Come peasant, king to own Him
The King of Kings, salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him

Raise, raise the song on high
The virgin sings her lullaby
Joy, joy for Christ is born
The babe, the son of Mary
