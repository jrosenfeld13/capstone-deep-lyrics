I don't have another reason
Why all these thoughts are floating through my head
It seems I took myself through seasons
I take it all myself, my pain instead
Break me off a little something
Why do I always have to compromise

Let me be myself just one time
Don't want to search for what I cannot find
My patience running thin with this state
There's only so much one can really take

I've tried and I've tried just to see it your way
Nothing is better than staying the same
So you can change the world
It's your world, change the world

You're stepping up to me once again
I'm wired, tired, sick of all your lies
You better sit your ass down my friend
I'll decide who angers me inside

I've tried and I've tried just to see it your way
Nothing is better than staying the same
So you can change the world
It's your world, change the world

I've tried and I've tried just to see it your way
Nothing is better than staying the same
So you can change the world
It's your world, change the world

I've tried and I've tried just to see it your way
Nothing is better than staying the same
So you can change the world
It's your world, change the world

I've tried and I've tried just to see it your way
Nothing is better than staying the same
So you can change the world
It's your world, change the world

I've tried and I've tried just to see it your way
Nothing is better than staying the same
So you can change the world
It's your world, change the world
