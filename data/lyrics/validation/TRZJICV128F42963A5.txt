Remember my face, dirty man?
Smack me with a frying pan
Maybe this will all come back to you

You gave me a fever a long time ago
I never got better, remember me yet?

This is
This is

This is where I celebrate my recovery
This is where I celebrate my recovery

I'll find creative ways to strip your body parts and use them as
And use them as weapons of torture, my mother will be proud

Maybe you can appreciate this saw created with your nails
Use it to cut off your lips and stuff them in your nostrils
Empty my bladder into your dirty mouth

Gargle my fluid
Gargle my fluid
Gargle my fluid
Gargle my fluid

Hum you and old tune
Hum you and old tune
Dismember your legs
Dismember your legs
Hum you and old tune
Hum you and old tune

Hung upside down by your waist
I blindfold myself
With the skin of your thigh
Spin 5 times
And use your leg
To swing at you
Like a piata

You explode
The remedy
All over me
All over me

My fever is gone and so are you
My fever is gone and so are you
My fever is gone and so are you
