Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

It's a cold man to hurt his woman
And watch her walk away crying
When all along, he knows he's wrong
To be so hard on a woman that's trying

I was so unkind to hurt you so
Going out of my mind
I just gotta let you know that

Baby, I can't let you go
I realize I hurt you so
Our love, surely can we mend it
It's just a little misunderstanding

I remember you said
You would always care
Until death should we do part
Then it surely must be our destiny
To die the death of a broken heart

So before I go, a wandering rover
Let's get together
Talk this thing over now

Baby, I can't let you go
I realize I hurt you so
Our love, surely can we mend it
It's just a little misunderstanding
That's all it is

We've been loving so long
It just seems wrong
That our love could never be
You could be anywhere
Baby, I wouldn't care
If I thought that you're needed me

All the chains in the world
(Couldn't hold me, couldn't hold me)
Like a robot your love
(Controls me, controls me)

Baby, I can't let you go
I realize I hurt you so
Our love, surely can we mend it
It's just a little misunderstanding
That's all it is

Baby, I can't let you go (oh, yeah)
I realize I hurt you so (ooh, yeah)
Our love, surely can we mend it
(Surely we can we mend it)
It's just a little misunderstanding

Baby (baby)
I just can't let you go....
