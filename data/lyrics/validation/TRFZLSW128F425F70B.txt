[Verse 1]
We met when she was younger
Then I had no eyes for her
A few years went by and I saw her
Now I'm gonna try for her
Look out babe

[Chorus]
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew

[Verse 2]
How could I ever have known that
She'd be what she is today
And look at how her boyfriend holds her
I'll be moving in one day
Split man

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
La doo day pow pow pow
La doo day pow pow pow
La doo day pow pow pow

[Chorus]
[repeat until fade]
