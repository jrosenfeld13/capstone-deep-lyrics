[Verse 1]
When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom: let it be
And in my hour of darkness, she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom: let it be

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Speaking words of wisdom: let it be

[Verse 2]
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
Shine on me tomorrow: let it be

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Speaking words of wisdom: let it be, let it be
