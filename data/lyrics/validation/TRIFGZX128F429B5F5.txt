South of the Border, down Mexico way
That's where I fell in love
When stars above came out to play
And now as I wander
My thoughts ever stray
South of the border, down Mexico way

She was a picture in old Spanish lace
Just for a tender while
I kissed the smile upon her face
For it was "Fiesta" and we were so gay
South of the border, down Mexico way

Then she sighed as she whispered "Maana"
Never dreaming that we were parting
And I lied as I whispered "Maana"
For that tomorrow never came

South of the border, I rode back one day
There in a veil of white
By candlelight she knelt to pray
The bells told me that I mustn't stay
South of the border, down Mexico way
Ay-ay-ay-ay, (Ay-ay-ay-ay,) etc
