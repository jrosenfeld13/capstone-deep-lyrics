I wont play your games no more
No, I wont play your games no more
If you wont believe my motives all
If you want to leave this lonely hole
Well I wont play your game no more

When the colors fade Im locked out of this
When the colors fade, Ill go

And when the votes are made I might make a mark
When the votes are made Ill know

We were formed from a
Small set of emotions
Were over ground

Nothing here but a
Well set it in motion
To let it stop

I wont play your games no more
No, I wont play your games no more
If you wont believe my motives all
If you want to leave this lonely hole
Well I wont play your game no more
I wont

With the covers on Ill breathe in the days
With the covers Ill give

We were formed from a
Small set of emotions
With a undertow

Live in half-lies
Going through the motions
We wont let this grow

I wont play your games no more
No, I wont play your games no more
If you wont believe my motives all
If you want to leave this lonely hole

We were formed from a
Small set of emotions
The undertow

Live in half-lies
Going through the motions
They wont let us go
