Get your top down money up
Pinkie rings be trillion cut
Down to make some bucks but
I'll shut up you silly sluts
Now you all know how we get down
Don't wanna make you look like a clown
Every city and every town
Tootsie roll now doo doo brown
Now boo yaa kaa b'woy lick a shot
At my grill boy gimme a lot
Beats that'll make your party hot
People be sweating up in the spot
Buggin' out to the words that I spitted
Cute throwback on with the fitted
Benz outside all custom kitted
You ask whodunnit well bitch I did it

Everybody get it twisted
Everybody gotta get it twisted

Your grind is on and your freak is too
Just grab the boy that's next to you
Pull him real close and call him boo
That's the way that players do
Everybody's drinking
I know whatcha thinking
You got my lights all blinking
Sweat til your t-shirt's wet and stinking
Big rims big ride
Big ass trucks is parked outside
Sky is clear my rear is wide
Boys and girls all coincide
Gettin stuck gettin truck
If you came too late then you shit outta luck
Chickenheads lemme hear you cluck
Back to the hotel so we can HEY!!!

Everybody get it twisted
Everybody gotta get it twisted

Twist off twist on
Word up Cameo yo word is bond
Concorde when I cross the pond
Get Benjamins like Goldie Hawn
Casio not rollie wristed
This is where we get explicit
Navigator or Bravada
Let's all go back to the Ramada
G5 or the Escalade
Hotel on wheels when I wanna get laid
Backseat leather just gettin sprayed
Quarter in the slot in my arcade
Only hits be gettin played
Don't have a clue but I get Kay Slayed
Brooklyn to Miami Dade
Holla if you gettin paid

Everybody get it twisted
Everybody gotta get it twisted
