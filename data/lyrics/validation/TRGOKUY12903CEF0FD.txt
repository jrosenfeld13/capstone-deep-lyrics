When I first saw her, gee, I liked that girl
Even before her first pubic hair would curl
Then old Hubey said, "Hey, dude, check this out
Man, that 13-year-old punk rocker's chest started to sprout."

And we all love her - Ursula
We all love her - Ursula
We all love her - Ursula
Our attention's undivided
Dammit we're excited!

'Cause Ursula finally has tit - all right
Ursula finally has tits - outta sight
Ursula finally has tits - now she's cool
Ursula finally has tits - check it out, dude
Ursula finally has tits

She went to the drug store, and I saw what she bought:
Maxi-pads, tampons, and a training bra
Eyeshadow, lipstick, smoking cigarettes
I think there's something that she needs to get off her chest
