Life is as short as shortbread
And cold water so stale
Can't you sprinkle more leaves
In our empty hands
Oh dear Katy !

Mum is so sad since you're gone
And the garden's so quiet
Won't you pour some more laughs in our empty hearts
Oh dear Katie

Oh Lord my tea !
Oh Lord all mighty !
Oh mon th ! mon th ! mont au cieux !
