[Vocalising]

I wander hopelessly
Tryna to think about me
But I'm trying to forget
The things that dwell on me

Signal a hush to the wind
And sit in the comfortable tree
Mesmerised by the beautiful sky
Sit thinking where I wanna be

I'm gonna sleep with the peaceful moon again
Until the sun bleeds through my eyes
I'm gonna wait until the morning comes
To wipe the sleep out from my eyes, yeah

[Vocalising]

Not a soul to be heard
A sound so sweet
Hear the pin hit the ground
Feel the air whistle through my feet

Catch a falling leaf
From its journey to the ground
I think I found my saving grace
A deaf silence all around

I'm gonna sleep with the peaceful moon again
Until the sun bleeds through my eyes
I'm gonna wait until the morning comes
To wipe the sleep out from my eyes

[Vocalising]

I sit and dream I lie and wait
I see how long it takes to deliver my fate
Grab all that you can hold
And just follow the trail
A scent that I'm picking up fast
A dream will prevail

I'm gonna sleep with the peaceful moon again
Until the sun bleeds through my eyes
I'm gonna wait until the morning comes
To wipe the sleep out from my eyes

[Vocalising to end]
