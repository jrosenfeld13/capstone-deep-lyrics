Tightly tied to a wooden bed
Twisted thoughts run through my head
A sharpened blade, I push it in
Red blood quickly covers my skin

I feel the orgasm's climax mount
Blood and cum mix on the ground
Aborted butcherer, I torture myself
Looking at partners on the shelf

Carved innards are starting to smell
My wasted body is usless now
Picking up the butcher knife
Pushing it forth with all my might

Blood drips down, it's harder to see
Staining red my colourless skin
Feeling faint, I start to fall
Shoot my load until it's gone

Stab in the chest
Cut with a knife
Fluids gush out
Ending my life
