I was so proud
Young and in love
Head in the clouds
A gift from above

Now, I held your hand
All through the storm
Nowhere to rest, nowhere to run

You got to hold me, hold me, hold me
Baby, try to understand
You got to pull me, pull me, suit me
Like nobody else, like nobody else

Teardrops must fall
Teardrops must fall
Teardrops must fall

You know in love, sometimes
You take the good with the bad
Cause all love is real
Baby, when you start to feel sad

You got to hold me, hold me, hold me
Baby, try to understand
You got to pull me, pull me, suit me
Like nobody else, like nobody else

Teardrops must fall
Teardrops must fall
Teardrops must fall

Now that it's past
And the jury's in
Our love will last forever to be
And always has been

You got to hold me, hold me, hold me
Baby, try to understand
You got to pull me, pull me, suit me
Like nobody else, like nobody else

Teardrops must fall
Teardrops must fall
Teardrops must fall
