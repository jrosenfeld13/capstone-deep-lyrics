I just wanna thank you for everything you see
For every clever word I say, for my golden opportunity
For stoking the fire, for my creativity
For burning up the wires just when I needed someone to talk to me

For bringing out the courage and stirring up the rage
For showing me that loyalty is a phantom on a page

And I'd like you to know that I never really gave
I never really gave, I never really gave a fuck about you
A fuck about you, a fuck about you, a fuck about you

I just wanna tell you though I've never seen your face
I know it's true from the things you do that you're a cowardly disgrace
You say to me that you're sorry, you tell me that you're sad
You tell me that you're worried about our friendship going bad

There's no need to worry, with us everything is fine
'Cause it's easy to be happy when there's nothing on the line

And Id like you to know I never really gave
I never really gave, I never really gave a fuck about you
A fuck about you, a fuck about you, a fuck about you

I know at times I've acted less than kind
Be callas self absorbed and blinded by my point of view
Now that you've shown be just how ugly you can be
Here's to you and me, salute and c'est la vie

I just wanna thank you for all the plans you made
For reaching out to all my friends and making sure that you got paid
No worries, it's a win win case, this brand new world is a massive place
With any luck you'll just disappear, disappear without a trace

Cheerio, cheerio, cheerio, cheerio
Cheerio, cheerio, cheerio, cheerio
Cheerio, cheerio, cheerio, cheerio
