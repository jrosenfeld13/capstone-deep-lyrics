When the time and the place is not my own
I'm okay just as long as you are around

It's just like Eden's door is ajar and desolation's peeking out
Coiled like a snake lies the shadow of a doubt that gnaws at the roots of my heart and dismembers my peace

When I'm caving in
When I loose myself too far from home you'll kill the distance
But I'll close my eyes, close my ears, close my mind and put my head down and run

Is it a coward's heart that trembles in your hand?
There's a fear in me you will never understand, but beneath that fear there's a will of steel and I think you know

Then there's just the little matter of where and when you need to make a stand
Make yourself clear, I'm damn sure that you can
A token of will and resolve is long overdue
I need to know I can depend on your sight, that you know the difference between what's not wrong and what is right and I'll sing and I'll scream 'till you hear me

But it's all right - I don't mind
Build your own words, make your own time
You've got nothing to prove
I know you hold
I know you hold
