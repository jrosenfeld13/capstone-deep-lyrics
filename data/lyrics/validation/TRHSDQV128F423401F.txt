It feeds on every dream you've had
And lures you in only to feel bad
That dull thud you've gotten used to
Is just her way of welcoming you
It never meant to kill you
But of course it's deliberate, too
Those promises meant nothing
She just laughs at your chest pounding

Beverly kills
(Don't let it get to you)
Beverly kills
(Don't let it get to you)
Beverly kills
(Don't let it get to you)
Don't let Beverly kill you too

Anxiety, you've come to know
Just relax and try to breath slow
There's nothing much you can do
Just don't let her see what scares you

Beverly kills
(Don't let it get to you)
Beverly kills
(Don't let it get to you)
Beverly kills
(Don't let it get to you)
Don't let Beverly kill you too

And if you get out of there alive
Try to find a place to go run and hide
Where your heart won't turn black
Just bring your soul back...ahh-ahh-ahh...

Beverly kills
Beverly kills
Beverly kills
( Don't let it get to you)
Beverly kills
( Don't let it get to you)
Beverly kills
( Don't let it get to you)
Don't let Beverly kill you too
