[Introduction]
Where did you go?

[Verse 1]
I was searchin' (searchin') on a one-way street
I was hopin' (hopin') for a chance to meet
I was waitin' for the operator on the line

[Pre-Chorus]
(She's gone so long) What can I do?
(Where could she be?) No, no, no
Don't know what I'm gonna do
I gotta get back to you

[Chorus]
You gotta slow down (slow down)
Sweet talkin' woman (slow down)
You got me runnin' (run run) you got me searchin'
Hold on (hold on) sweet talkin' lover (hold on)
It's so sad if that's the way it's over

(Sweet talking woman)

[Verse 2]
I was (workin') many days go by
I was thinkin' (thinkin') 'bout the lonely nights
Communication breakdown all around

[Pre-Chorus]
(She's gone so long) What can I do?
(Where could she be?) No no no
Don't know what I'm gonna do
I gotta get back to you

[Chorus]
You gotta slow down (slow down)
Sweet talkin' woman (slow down)
You got me runnin' (run run) you got me searchin'
Hold on (hold on) sweet talkin' lover (hold on)
It's so sad if that's the way it's over

[Verse 3]
I've been livin' (livin') on a dead end street
I've been askin' (askin' kindly) everybody I meet
Insufficient data coming through

[Pre-Chorus]
(She's gone so long) What can I do?
(Where could she be?) No, no, no
Don't know what I'm gonna do
I gotta get back to you

[Chorus]
Oh, slow down (slow down)
Sweet talkin' woman (slow down)
You got me runnin' (run run) you got me searchin'
Hold on (hold on) sweet talkin' lover (hold on)
It's so sad if that's the way it's over

[Chorus] x2
Slow down (slow down)
Sweet talkin' woman (slow down)
You got me runnin', you got me searchin'
Hold on (hold on) sweet talkin' lover (hold on)
It's so sad if that's the way it's over
