Now if you wanna hear some boogie like I'm gonna play
It's just an old piano and a knockout bass
The drummer man's a cat they call Kickin' McCoy
And I know you will remember that rubber-legged boy
Mama's cookin' chicken fried and bacon in grease
Come on along boys it's just down the road a piece

Now, there's a place you really get your kicks
It's open every night about twelve to six
And if you want to hear some boogie you can get your fill
And shoot that thing do you like an old steam drill
Come on along you can lose your lead
Down the road, down the road, down the road a piece

I said it, there's a place you really get your kicks
It's open every night about twelve to six
And if you want to hear some boogie you can get your fill
And shoot that thing do you like an old steam drill
Come on along you can lose your lead
Down the road, down the road, down the road a piece
It's down the road, down the road, down the road a piece
