What I'd give to
Be the one
To have my name linger
On your tongue

Warm-hearted you
Became so numb
I'm not on your tongue

Will aspirins and alcohol
Someway decrease the ache
From knowing that you'll do to him
The same you did to me
That's nice, that's nice

Thought they were mutual
Those loving words
Thought it was more than
Just making love

Warm-hearted you
Became so numb
I'm not on your tongue

Will aspirins and alcohol
Someway decrease the ache
From knowing that you'll do to him
The same you did to me
That's nice, that's nice
That's nice, that's nice
