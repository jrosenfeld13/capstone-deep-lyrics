[Verse 1]
Flying high in the friendly sky
Without leaving the ground
The rest of the folks are tired and weary
And have laid their bodies down
I go to the place where danger waits
And it's bound to forsake me

[Chorus]
So stupid minded
But I go crazy, when I can't find it

In the morning I'll be alright my friends
Soon the night will bring the pains again

[Verse 2]
Flying high in the friendly sky
Without ever leaving the ground
That does seen nothing but trouble baby
Paraphernalia is my name
There's a place where the feeling awaits me
Self destruction's in my hands

[Chorus]

I know I'm hooked my friends
To the boy who makes slaves out of men

[Bridge] [Marvin Gaye w/ The Originals]
Ahh yeah - (I did the best I could)
Ahh yeah - (Nobody understood)
Nobody, nobody - (I did the best I could)
Goodnight, darling - (Nobody understood)
Take me away, take me away tonight - (I did the best I could)
I'm so... - (Nobody understood)
Nobody - (I did the best I could)
