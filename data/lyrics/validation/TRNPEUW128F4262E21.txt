I don't care how long it takes
I don't care that the levee breaks
The wind may blow and the cloud may rain
But I'll be in your arms again

I can't wait for the sun to rise
I don't care if I've covered mile
First thing smokin', I ain't jokin'
I'll be in your arms again

I got somethin' that just won't wait
I'm not about to hesitate
Or this feelings I've got now won't explain
When I'm in your arms again

This old road takes its toll
I'm as tired as the day is old
My love [Incomprehensible]
When I'm in your arms again
