Two step, two step, two step
Two step, two step, two step

Bright lights, keep it straight
Feels like looking at a magazine
You and her on the floor
Feels like dancing is the way to go

[Chorus]
But if you let her see that fancy footwork
Show her that you're not that shy
Let her see that fancy footwork
Show her you're that type of guy

Two step, two step, two step
Two step, two step, two step

Young boy, don't be late
This girl ain't really got time to wait
This girl ain't really got time to wait
You think it's all for show
But this is just the only way I know

[Chorus]

Two step, two step, two step
Two step, two step, two step

Hey, if you ever need a guy
A partner for the week
You point in my direction
Then just come and follow me
We'll meet up on the floor
And maybe do the twerk
So show me what you got in terms of

Fancy footwork
Fancy footwork
Fancy footwork
Fancy footwork

Two step, two step, two step
Two step, two step, two step
