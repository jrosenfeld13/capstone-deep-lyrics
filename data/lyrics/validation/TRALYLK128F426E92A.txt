Aim for the body rare, you'll see it on TV
The worst thing in 1954 was the bikini
See the girl on the TV, dressed in the bikini
She doesn't think so but she's dressed for the H-bomb

And I found that essence rare, it's what I looked for
I knew I'd get what I asked for

Aim for the country fair, you read it in the papers
The worst happens any week, a scandal on the front page
See the happy pair smiling close like they're monkeys
They wouldn't think so but they're holding themselves down

And I found that essence rare, it's what I looked for
I knew I'd get what I asked for

Aim for politicians fair, who'll treat your vote, hope well
The last thing they'll ever do, act in your interest
Look at the world through your polarized glasses
Things'll look a whole lot better for the working classes
