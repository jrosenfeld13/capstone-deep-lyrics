You want to dance with the angels
Well then embroider me with gold
And I will fly with the angels
And you can dance with me
Sing with the angels
Well then show me a song
And I will strum with the angels
And you can sing with me

But you want to fall fashionably in love with a woman
In love with a life you'll adore
In love with a woman you'll adore

Under my wings
You'll start to ask yourself
And under my wings
You'll learn to fly
Under my wings
You'll come to understand
How to hold on if you want to

Oh you can dream of the frog legs
Sittin in the church
In the glass in the sand where my footsteps
You can dream of the angel
In the air don't you see me
I float in skies in your eyes
In your eyes

You want to dance with the angels
Well then embroider me with gold
And I will fly with the angels
And you can dance with me

Under my wings
You'll start to look for me
Under my wings
You'll want to cry sometimes
Under my wings
You'll find someone to hold onto
If you want to

You want to dance with the angels
Well then emboider me with gold
And I will fly with the angels
And you can dance with me

(You can dance with me...)
