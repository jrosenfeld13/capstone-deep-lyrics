Now I really cannot see
If you were good for me at all
I wanna say, that everything's fine
But it's not but it's not
All the times you made me stay
I see it all so clear today
And I wish I could
Turn back time turn back time

If I had a choice
I'd leave all behind
If I had a choice
I'd make you leave my mind
Leave my mind

The things you had me do
Everytime you knew I would
I wanna say, that I was aware
But I can't but I can't
All you tried to take away
I see it all so clear today
And I feel like a fool
I let myself down let myself down

If I had a choice
I'd leave all behind
If I had a choice
I'd make you leave my mind
Leave my mind

And you begged me to trust you
I wish I never did
And you begged me to trust you
I wish I never did

If I had a choice
I'd leave all behind
If I had a choice
I'd make you leave my mind
