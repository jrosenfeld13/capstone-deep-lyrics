When all is dead and gone
Where will I be going
When all the lights are out
And no one's here to listen

I can't seize your time
And I fear your presence

Will you be there at the end of the road
When nothing's left to be found
Will you be there at the end of the road
When all my days are gone

For the way I live this life
I'll drown in a sea of sorrow
When I take my last breath
Will you breath life in me

I can't seize my time
Let me feel your presence

Will you be there at the end of the road
When nothing's left to be found
Will you be there at the end of the road
When all my days are gone

Will you be there at the end of the road
When nothing's left to be found
Will you be there at the end of the road
When all my days are gone

Will you be there at the end of the road
When nothing's left to be found
Will you be there at the end of the road
When all my days are gone
