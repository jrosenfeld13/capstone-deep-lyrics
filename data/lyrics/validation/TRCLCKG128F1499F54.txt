Spending another night alone
Wondering when will i ever see you again
Thinking what i would give
To get you back baby
I should have told you how i felt then
Instead i kept it to myself
I let my love go unexpressed
'till it was too late
You walked away

Chorus:
Was it something i didn't say
When i didn't say i love you
Was it words that you never heard
All those words i should have told you
All those times
All those nights
When i had the chance to
Was it something i didn't say
Was it something i didn't say

Always assumed that you'd be there
Couldn't foresee the day you'd ever be leaving me
How could i let my world
Slip through my hands baby
I took for granted that you knew
Oh love, the love i had for you
I guess, you never had a clue
'till it was too late
You walked away

Chorus

All the words were in my heart
Well, they went unspoken
But baby now my silent heart
It is a heart that's broken
I should've said so many things
I should've let you know
You're the one i needed near me
But i never let you hear me

Chorus
