I was the first boy in this town to love you little girl
Come back baby I know it's over
I was the first boy in this town to love you little girl
Come back baby I know it's over
I could be new - for you - again
I was the first boy in this town to love you little girl
The one cute cookie who beat the boredom
Stay for a day - or - two - again
I was the first boy in this town to love you little girl
And you know 'bout it (know 'bout it)
Only negation's gonna last forever and the good girls get to know 'bout it

Lovesick - and I've taken too much
And I'm lovesick - never taken enough now baby
Lovesick - and baby I don't wanna be
Lovesick - anymore, let me tell you 'bout it
I got your number you know I got your number
I got your number you know I got it

Come back baby I know it's over
I'd love you to look - me up - someday
I was the first boy in this town to love you little girl
Hot shot sugar returns to toy town
You got to do - the world - your way
I was the first boy in this town to love you little girl
And you know 'bout it (know 'bout it)
This repetition's - gonna last forever and the good girls get to know 'bout it
