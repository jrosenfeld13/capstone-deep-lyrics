I took my darling down
I took my darling down
To that big grey house down the lane
And then the doctor said
He said it's in her head
She's never going to be right again
I kissed my love goodbye
She didn't blink an eye
They took her down the hall
She never looked back at all
CHORUS
Behind grey walls
Somewhere there's a soul
Behind grey walls
She's out of control
Crying out for help
No one can hear
O Lord have pity on her
O Lord have pity on her
My darling walks the floor
My darling walks the floor
She walks every minute that she can
I heard my darling say
I heard my darling say
She don't know who I am
Cigarette burns down her arm
Said she tried to do herself harm
Tied her arms in the back
Trussed her up like a sack
CHORUS
I saw my darling's face
I saw my darling's face
It looked so pale in the distance
She stared out from her room
Into the dying gloom
And I saw her poor tears glisten
Pills to keep her calm
More punctures than a junkie in her arm
Tied her down on the bed
Seventy volts through her head
CHORUS
