Endless...
Apocalypse...
Endless...Endless...
Apocalypse

[Verse 1]
There wasn't any reason
To change the melody
Are you a real person
Or do you just play one on TV?

People say
Why don't you die?
I keep waking up
And when I do, I'm alive

Slipping on a lampshade
Wishing you were me
You're just wishing for poop
But happy with pee
We're just part of one big filthy family, yeah

It's hard to be a soldier
And I'm getting over

[Chorus]
Endless apocalypse (Endless apocalypse)
In the beginning
Endless apocalypse (Endless apocalypse)
Endless apocalypse

Endless, endless...
Endless apocalypse...

[Verse 2]
You think that it's over
It's really just begun
Watching your hair grow
Is really quite fun
Thought I was thinking
Of another time
I'll pursue a career as a mime

Why won't you die?
I keep waking up
And when I am, I'm alive

[Chorus]
Endless apocalypse (Endless apocalypse)
To end the beginning (To end the beginning)
Endless apocalypse (Endless apocalypse)
Endless apocalypse today
It's a very long day...

Endless apocalypse
Endless, endless
Endless apocalypse
Endless, endless

[Chorus]
Endless apocalypse (Endless apocalypse)
To end the beginning
Endless apocalypse (Endless apocalypse)
Endless apocalypse today
It's a beautiful day...
