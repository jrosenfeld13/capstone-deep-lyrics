She's like a tarantula
Bearing down on me with eyes of fire
Slowly moving in for the kill
Yeah y yeah

Just watch it now
As she spins a web on the wall
I can't take it anymore

Now that you've got me
Where you want me girl
All I'm asking, please baby
Is show a little mercy on my heart

She's cool
A fount of fire
She can melt you in your own desire
You try to run but your heart is a ball and chain
Yeah y yeah

I used to be
Such a strong man
No woman could penetrate me
Now I don't know anymore

Now that you've got me
Where you want me girl
All I'm asking, please baby
Is show a little mercy on my heart

Guitar solo

Now that you've got me
Now that you've got me
Now that you've got me
Now that you've got me

Now that you've got me
Where you want me girl
All I'm asking, please baby
Is show a little mercy on my heart

Now that you've got me
Where you want me girl
All I'm asking, please baby
Is show a little mercy on my heart
