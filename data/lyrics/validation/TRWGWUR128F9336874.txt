From the Album: Space
Hold till we make it
Living on our own is the safe bet
Broken every rule on the way kid
We threw them away
Afraid of the starlight
Walking on the edge of the outline
Push until the day that we flat line
Its easy to say
We want it all and we want it now
We want it all and we want it now
So today we escape
And we run, till we faint
Its a total disaster
Wishing that the end would come faster
Told me I was wrong so I passed her
I put her in place again
We want it all and we want it now
We want it all and we want it now
So today we escape
And we run, till we faint
Were not ready to fade
Were not ready to fade
Were not ready to fade (Were not ready to fade)
Were not ready to fade Were not ready to fade)
Were not ready to fade (so we won't go)
Were not ready to fade (so we won't go)
Were not ready to fade (so we won't go)
We just need to escape
La da da da da da
La da da da da da
La da da da da da
La da da da da da
