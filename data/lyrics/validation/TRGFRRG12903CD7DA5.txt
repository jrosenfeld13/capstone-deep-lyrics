Incarcerated by my fear, paranoia
I'm condemned to live a wretched life
Confinement in a sterile world isolation
Disconjunction with society
Boiling my food to exhume the parasites
Diet infectious
Water flowing through, filters for distilling
Organisms infesting
Oxygen tanks, a breathing apparatus
Perpetuates vitality
Beleaguered by repulsion of defilement
Functional disorder of the mind
Obsessive aberration of absolute purity
Neurotic compulsion
Accursed affliction
Gnawing lamentation
Deteriorating intellect
Distortion of perception
Self proclaimed diagnosis
Drastic resolution
Self prescribe a red hot slug
White knuckle pistol grip
Load the chamber, hammer cocked
Jam the barrel in my mouth
Need a reprieve from my misery
Unrelenting anxiety
All I ask is one final plea
.44 caliber brain surgery... surgery
[Leads Sykes, Reilly]
Purgatorial euphorium
Banish my affliction
Lead forged entry wound, exempting me from
Melancholic psychosis
Cybernetic annihilation
Finally set me free
Released from my coma, denied death's crushing jaws
Prolonged tortured existence
Informed by physicians, an amateur lobotomy
Deprived of an autopsy
Psychotic abortion
Grey matter negated
Premeditated remedy
Procedure of extremity
Thought I had a master plan
.44 in my hand
Assassination was my goal
Polluted filthy world a loathe
Suicide with no success
Abolished my obsessiveness
Propelled the cure emphatically
Change convictions radically
Practising without a degree
.44 caliber brain surgery
