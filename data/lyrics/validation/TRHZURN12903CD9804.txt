I crashed into the jungle while trying to keep a date
With my little girl, who was-a back in the States
I was stranded in the jungle, afraid, alone
Trying to figure a way to get a message back home
But how was I to know that the wreckage of my plane
Had been picked up and spotted, and my girl in lover's lane?

And meanwhile, back in the States

Baby, baby, let's make romance
You know, your old-time lover hasn't got a chance
He's stranded in the jungle, as mad as he can be
So, come on, pretty baby, just you and me

An' meanwhile, back in the jungle

The boys in the jungle had me on the run
When somethin' heavy hit me, like an atomic bomb
When I woke up and my head started to clear
I had a strange feeling I was with cooking gear
I smelled something cooking and I looked to see
That's when I found out they was a-cooking me

Great goo-ga-moo-ga
Lemme outta here

An' meanwhile, back in the States

Baby, baby, let's make romance
You know your old-time lover hasn't got a chance
He's stranded in the jungle, as mad as he can be
So come on pretty, baby, just you and me

An' meanwhile, back in the jungle

I jumped out the pot, and I finally got away
Frantic and worried about what my baby would say
So I jumped in the ocean and started to swim
But my chance of survival was getting mighty slim
So I thumbed down a whale who was headin' my way
And I reached the States in about half a day
And when I got to lover's lane, I was almost dead
But my soul was gone, and here's what I said

Baby, baby, the man is no good
Oh, baby baby, you should have understood
You can trust me as long as you please
So, come back, pretty baby, where you used to be
'Cause I love you
'Cause I love you
'Cause I love you
