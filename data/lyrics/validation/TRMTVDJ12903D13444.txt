I love you, yes, I do
'Cause I know that you love me too
I love you, yes, I do
Gonna spend all my money on you

Everyday when I say that
I'm not gonna take anymore
It's okay, don't go away, I feel bad
When you're closing the door

I love you

Need some more to restore
All the feeling that I get from you
I want more, give me more
All I want is a barrel of you

I love you, yes, I do
'Cause I know that you love me too
I love you, yes, I do
Gonna spend all my money on you
Woh, woh, woh, woh

I don't care when they stare
At the way that I'm always with you
We're a pair, it's not fair
When they say we're a special brew
Woh, woh, woh, woh

I love you

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Everyday when I say that
I'm not gonna take anymore
It's okay, don't go away, I feel bad
When you're closing the door

Need some more to restore
All the feeling that I get from you
I want more, give me more
All I want is a barrel of you
Woh, woh, woh, woh, woh, woh, woh

I love you, yes, I do
'Cause I know that you love me too!
