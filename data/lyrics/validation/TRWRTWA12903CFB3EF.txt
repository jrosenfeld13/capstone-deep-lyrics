Everybody seems to have it better?
They just show the bits they only want you to see
Then I think to have it, have it better
It's fine for all to show the bits they only want you to see, to see

When things once where free and easy
Abstract space time ancient readings
Are all the books read and written unfolding the universe?
Let's go and see, let's go and see, go and look at it in a book
Go and see for yourself

Everybody wants to be as free as the wind
As our thirst for knowledge it doth wind and bend
Imagination captures then invites you in to play
Then it shows the bits it only wants you to see, to see

When things once where free and easy
Abstract space time ancient readings
Are all the books read and written unfolding the universe?
Let's go and see, let's go and see, go and look at it in a book
Go and see for yourselves

When things once where free and easy
Abstract space time, ancient readings
Are all the books read and written unfolding the universe?
Come, let's go and see
