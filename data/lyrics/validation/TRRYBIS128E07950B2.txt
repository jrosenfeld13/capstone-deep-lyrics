(Yeahh) I'm goin' left
'Til you lead me to the right
Lead me to what is right
I'm goin' left
'Til you lead me to the right
Lead me to what is right

There's a train people say
I could ride to get my whole life straight
But the bridge on the way
Has a toll too much for me to pay
Yes I know this must be
What I choose could be my destiny
Lights are green all is go
But my heart keeps telling my mind "no"

I'm goin' left
'Til you lead me to the right
Lead me to what is right
I'm goin' left
'Til you lead me to the right
Lead me to what is right

There's a land over there
Where all are given equal share
What you get is so small
It's like never having nothing at all
Take my hand as a friend
I will stick with you until the end
I'm in doubt I must decline
Even friends can change their minds

I'm goin' left
'Til you lead me to the right
Lead me to what is right
I'm goin' left
'Til you lead me to the right
Lead me to what is right

(Repeat to end)
