[Verse 1]
Nerve, here I've born
Feeding on his lung
Verve is his curse
Because he wanted to meet Christ alone
Here, you're no good
We could be so flown
Misunderstood
We could be your god
There in my bones
We could be so flown
Misunderstood
Because he wanted to meet Christ alone
But you will

[Chorus]
But you will never find me, breach unborn
Never come here, watch me burn
Never, it's because your scars show
Never will I burn

[Verse 2]
Under
Beneath the floor, before
His face, 'cause you're no good
We could have been like one
Bitch, you feel sore
We could be so flown
Misunderstood
Because he wanted to meet Christ alone
But you will

[Chorus]
But you will never find me, breach unborn
Never, sit and watch me burn
Never, it's because your scars show
Never will I burn
Will I burn
Will I burn
Will I burn

[Outro]
Beg, don't try and you will never
Beg, don't try and you will never
Beg, don't try and you will never
Beg, don't even waste your breath
