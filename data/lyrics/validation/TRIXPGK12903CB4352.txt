Walking sadly through the park
I hear crying in the darkness
And though I act like I cannot hear
Their situation is very clear
A girl who's trying to tell her guy
The time has come that they say goodbye
And his answer tears my heart apart

[Chorus:]
Give me tonight
Then if you don't wanna stay
Girl, I'll just forget you
You'll see I'm right
You won't get to go away
Love ain't gonna let you

[Verse 2:]
Walking with you through the park
Now it's my voice in the darkness
Just like the girl trying to tell her guy
I'm telling you we must say goodbye
I can't believe when I hear once more
The very words that were said before
Come from deep within your broken heart

Your voice echoes in the dark
Your voice echoes in the dark

[Chorus]

I'll give you one more night!

[Chorus]

I'll give you one more night!

[Bridge:]
His voice echoes in the darkness

[Chorus]

Yes, I'll give you one more night!
Love! Love ain't gonna let you go!
I'll give you one more night
