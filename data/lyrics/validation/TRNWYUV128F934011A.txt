O Lord, it's embarrassing
I have been a cause for concern
"Hallelujah" all the angels sing
When castaways choose to return

And so before this sun sets
I will rest with no regrets
I'm ending with a phrase

Thank You, goodnight
At the end of the day
You've taken me somewhere
Thank you, goodnight
All the love that You gave
Has taken me somewhere good

Gone is my eloquence
Apologies come easy for some
With a Saviour, this is making sense
I'm sorry for the things I've become
And so before I lay down
I'm making my rebound
By ending with a phrase

Tonight I'm crawling
Back from the fallen
Like a desperate stray
To where I was before I fell away
