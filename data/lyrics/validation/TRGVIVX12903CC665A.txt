Just one more dance just one more chance so I can talk to you
Don't live too fast forget the past and I will try to prove
I would do anything you want me to
Don't run around don't turn me down let me talk to you
Don't go too far with that crowd at the bar
That's not the way to win please fall in love again
Give me your heart so I can start to build our life anew
I know you've paid so if you're afraid let me talk to you
[ steel - fiddle ]
Don't go too far with that crowd...
