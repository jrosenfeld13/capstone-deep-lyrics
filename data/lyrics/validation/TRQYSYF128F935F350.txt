Love, oh love, oh careless love
You fly though my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a, many a poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine
Love, oh love, oh careless love
In your clutches of desire
You made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire
Love, oh love, oh careless love
All my happiness has left
You filled my heart with them weary old blues
Now I'm walkin' talkin' to myself
Love, oh love, oh careless love
Trusted you, now it's too late
You've made me throw my only friend down
That's why I sing this song of hate
Love, oh love, oh careless love
Night and day I weep and moan
You brought the wrong man into my life
For my sins, till judgment I'll atone
