There's so many good reasons for you to keep your mouth shut
Like actions speak louder than words
And if you don't have anything nice to say then don't say anything at all
But i can see you've got a lot on your mind
So let it drop to your throat and try not to choke
Disregard the pity if you wanna get to the nitty gritty
Can't survive in the city and still remain witty
No tough little alley cat is gonna come run to no kitty kitty
No tough little alley cat is gonna come run to no kitty kitty
So disregard the pity
Get to the nitty gritty
Remain witty
Remain witty

A little lick
Cut to the quick

Searching for a lead you're tryin' to find me i forget
Want so bad to get away from everything that i knew

Right outta the pink you came you came and you tickled me blue
Right outta the pink you came you came and you tickled me blue

A little lick
Cut to the quick

Here...
Here....

How you doin'?
And how you been?
And how you feelin' about the attention you been gettin' that you don't deserve?
Well here...

Kitty, kitty,kitty,kitty,kitty,kitty,kitty,kitty,kitty,kitty,kitty,kitty

So disregard the pity
Get to the nitty gritty
Remain witty
Remain witty

A little lick
Cut to the quick
A little lick
And you could beat it with a stick

Cat got your tounge?
You better watch your tounge
