Theres a girl smoking cigarettes
She looks like you, looks like you
Theres a feeling I cant forget
Coming through
Baby blue

Well they tore another building down
Its nothing new
This town is through

Theres a feeling I get when I talk to you mama
So were going out west where the winds wont harm us now
And the car is in the lane
Well never be the same

The stores are setting up for Halloween
Back at school the kids are cool
Painted ponies in this one horse town
Are getting old
Ive been bought and sold

Theres a feeling I get when I talk to you mama
So were going out west where the winter winds wont harm us now
Theres a feeling I get when I walk with you baby
So I hang around till the fall and Ill be there
When you call
