I dream of you more than you dream I do
How can I prove to you this love is real?
You're mean to me more than you mean to be
You just can't seem to see the way I feel

When I am close to you, the world is far away
The words that fill my heart my lips can't seem to say
I want you so, more than you'll ever know
More than you dream I do, I dream of you
