I swear when we touched I saw heaven in your eyes
Jewel studded clouds floating in your skies
Seas of blue and fields of green
Looking like you fell out of someone's dreams

Why do my troubles turn true
Whenever I rest my eyes on you
Why must my heartache be found
Wherever your feet are touching the ground

You could sing an army of angels to sleep
Songs that could cause the devil to weep
You hold me so sweet when the day is done
Enough to make you wonder where we all came from

Why do my troubles turn true
Whenever I rest my eyes on you
Why must my heartache be found
Wherever your feet are touching the ground
My heartache can be found
Wherever your feet are touching the ground

And out of those eyes I'm feeling rain
Bringing me misery and giving me pain
Curse these shackles that you put on me
Blessed be the day when you set me free

Why do my troubles turn true
Whenever I rest my eyes on you
Why must my heartache be found
Wherever your feet are touching the ground
My heartache can be found
Wherever your feet are touching the ground
My heartache can be found
Wherever your feet are touching the ground
