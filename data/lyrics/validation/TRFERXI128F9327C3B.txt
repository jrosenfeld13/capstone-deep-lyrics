When I look at you
Baby I'm amazed after all we've been through
All that I can say is there's no perfect plan and no finish line
We just learn to fall and get back up in time
Didn't think we'd make it so glad
We didn't break up now we're good together and stronger than before

It's not complicated
And I wanna celebrate it
Cause it feels like the first time
When you walked into the room and
I can't believe we made it
When all around this love is fading
When you look into my eyes
It feels like the first time again

We stood out on the bridge
And everywhere in between
Pushed it to the edge
Ain't never lost your faith
You proved that we were strong
And I'm glad you did
This is something that I can't believe I could of miss
We don't have to try hard now that we've come this far we're just living
We're on the other side of this

It's not complicated
And I wanna celebrate it
Cause it feels like the first time
When you walked into the room and
I can't believe we made it
When all around this love is fading
When you look into my eyes
It feels like the first time again

You oughtta know by now
I'd do it all again
If you would lead me too
All that I have with you
Oh
Do....

Didn't think we'd make it so glad
We didn't break up cuz we're good together and stronger than before

It's not complicated
And I wanna celebrate it
Cause it feels like the first time
When you walked into the room and
I can't believe we made it
When all around this love is fading
When you look into my eyes
It feels like the first time again
