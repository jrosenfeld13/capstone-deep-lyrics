[Verse 1]
How can it be? I can taste you now
How can I see when you're everything?

[Pre-Chorus]
All the world in one grain of sand
And I've blown it
All my world in one grain of sand
And you own it

[Chorus]
Black cherry, black cherry
Stone
Black cherry, black cherry

[Verse 2]
Hearing you say it, I could die
Trembling star just reminds me

[Pre-Chorus]
All the world in one grain of sand
And I've blown it
All my world in one grain of sand
And you own it

[Chorus]
Black cherry, black cherry
Stone
Black cherry, black cherry

[Post-Chorus]
Excite me, ignite me
Oh and you know
I miss you, I kiss you
Oh and you know

[Chorus]
Black cherry, black cherry
Stone
Black cherry, black cherry

[Post-Chorus]
Excite me, ignite me
Oh and you know
I miss you, I kiss you
Oh and you know
