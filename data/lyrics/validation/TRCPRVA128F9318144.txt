Just like a rerun movie
I see that scene again
That feeling shoots right through me
'Cause this time I know the end

And I've seen it played so many times
And I've watched it frame by frame
And I don't have to guess who loses
And I know who'll feel the pain

You're gonna leave me again
Just like you did the time before
This is the start of the end
The end of me when you walk out that door

Think I'll go down to the picture show
See if they're playin' somethin' new
Maybe one with a happy ending
And I'll pretend It's me and you

But I know that it's just make believe
So I won't even try
To tell myself that you're not gonna leave
That you'll never say goodbye

You're gonna leave me again
Just like you did the time before
This is the start of the end
The end of me when you walk out that door...
