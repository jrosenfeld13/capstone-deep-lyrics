[Verse 1]
Love rising from the mists
Promise me this and only this
Holy breath touching me, like a wind song
Sweet communion of a kiss

[Verse 2]
Sun sifting through the grey
Enter in, reach me with a ray
Silently swooping down, just to show me
How to give my heart away

[Bridge 1]
Once a crystal choir
Appeared while I was sleeping
And called my name
And when they came down nearer
Saying, "Dying is done,"
Then a new song was sung
Until somewhere we breathed as one
And still I hear their whisper

[Verse 3]
Stars bursting in the sky
Hear the sad nova's dying cry
Shimmering memory, come and hold me
While you show me how to fly

[Verse 4]
Sun sifting through the grey
Enter in, reach me with a ray
Silently swooping down, just to show me
How to give my heart away

[Bridge 2]
Lately sparkling hosts
Come fill my dreams, descending
On fiery beams
I've seen 'em come clear down
Where our poor bodies lay
Soothe us gently and say
"Gonna wipe all your tears away"
And still I hear their whisper

[Verse 1]
Love, rising from the mists
Promise me this and only this
Holy breath touching me, like a wind song
Sweet communion of a kiss
