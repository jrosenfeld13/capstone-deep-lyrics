I'm lookin through my bedroom window
I was a boy had no problems at all
Or even my food
Or even my dress
My only concern was where my money went

I was gonna be here where your papa went
And the big fat woman gets a whole lotta laughs
No one's gonna tell me what to do
This is every mother's land
We got it all
We got everything
Plenty of toys
I love bein a boy

I'm lookin through
My broken window
It's like an old place
To call my home
Ain't got a dog
No money at all
Spend my nights in an empty stall

I wanna be such a powerful man
And when i say help, get a whole lotta laughs
No one's gonna tell me what to do
Mom's gonna drink a sicillian poo
Ain't got a job
Not a criminal vent
We're alright anyway
We're alive
All my things are spent
