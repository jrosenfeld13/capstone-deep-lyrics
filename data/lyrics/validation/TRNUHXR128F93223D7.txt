When our eyes met
I just can't believe
You're with someone else
With one kiss you'll have me
I wanna look into your eyes
To feel that special place
*rambling about ecstasy*
I'll be here for you, if you ever need me x 4
I've been waiting for so long
It's starting to kill me
What do I have to do?
It's like she's cast a spell
I wish I knew how to break it
So you take a little notice of me
*rambling about truth and ecstasy*
I wanna take you away
And forget about life for a while
Drifting to a world of ecstasy
Where I can hold you
You look so happy with her
I wouldn't want to tear you apart
But whatever happens
I just want you to know...
I ve been waiting for so long
It started to kill me
What do I have to do?
It's like she's cast a spell
I wish I knew how to break
So you take a little notice of me
*more rambling*
I'll be here for you, If you'll ever need me x 4
Yeah yeah
