To every heart thats growing darker, colder and colder
The heart on the sleave is getting older and older
Harder and harder to beat
To every soul thats burning brighter and brighter
Riding the fire higher and higher
The heart on the sleave is growing darker and darker
Harder and harder to bleed

And it won't be long now
And in time you'll find out
This heart is yours, let it bleed
And it won't be long now
And in time you'll find out
This heart is yours, let it bleed

To every time i keep you waiting, hoping and praying
The heart on that sleave is always building and breaking
Making it harder to see
To everything that doesn't matter, pulling you under, taking you over
The heart on the sleave is getting closer and closer
Just cut it open and bleed

And it won't be long now
And in time you'll find out
This heart is yours, let it bleed
And it won't be long now
And in time you'll find out
This heart is yours, let it bleed

Time...
Time takes away
Time gives you chances to come back again

And it won't be long now
And in time you'll find out
This heart is yours, let it bleed
And it won't be long now
And in time you'll find out
This heart is yours, let it bleed
