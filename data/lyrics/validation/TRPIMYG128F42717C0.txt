[Verse 1]
When A man's been mistreated
When he been kicked around
He been laughed at and lied to
Well it keeps going down

[Chorus]
When A man hits bottom
Woman I know Yes I know
Ain't no place left to go
Ain't no place left to go

[Verse 2]
I been locked out by A woman
Locked out in the street
I been locked up in the jail-house
I been locked for two months and three

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Well blue is my colour
It is on my wall yes
13 is my number
Oh locked on my little name

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Ain't no place left to go
No place left to go
There ain't no place left to go
Woh yeah woh yeah woh yeah
Well no no no no no no no no
Woohhhoooowooooooohhhh
