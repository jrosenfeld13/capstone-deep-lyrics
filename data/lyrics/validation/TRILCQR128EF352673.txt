When I was a child, I was well fed
I was smothered with affection
When I was a child, I was so content
So well adjusted
Then I stuck my head out and
I immediately knew: this was not for me!
Such a mess
Such a mess
Your flesh and contempt and stress starts to grow
As you clutch on the rest, you're alone
Something has come between us egg
