Unsheathe the sword
Call the death squad
Let loose the dogs
Make me your God
Curse the Earth
Stretch forth thy rod
Get on your knees
Make me your God

Unleash the nuns, descend to Earth
Enslave the man, make me your God
Suffer the plague, surf the sky
Declare unclean, my God machine
Number the beast, sound the horn
Suffer the wrath, bring me your first born
Cardinal Syn has come to free us

I am Cardinal Syn!
Worship me or know
Damnation!
