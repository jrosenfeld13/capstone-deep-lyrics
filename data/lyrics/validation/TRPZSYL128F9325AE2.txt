Springtime walks down the land
And hearts begin to understand
You are my love - you say we're gonna win
You know there's nothing to say -
Your love has gone with the wind

Don't tell the wind - when you find
That you are losing your love
Don't tell the wind - when you feel
That your love is in vain
Don't tell the wind - when you know
I'm gonna love you forever
Don't tell the wind - don't make it smile...

Voices appear whispering low
Don't wanna be here - I don't wanna go
You were my love - we're never gonna win
There's nothing left to say -
We're drifting in the wind

(Drifting in the wind - longing for some rest)
