Just one excuse
Is all I need
To drop this case again
To hide from you again
Violence will do it for you, will do it for you

You make me so scared of myself
This time I feel that I could kill someone
Kill someone (you)

Just one excuse
To escape from you
To drop this case again
To loose from you again
Violence will do it for you, will do it for you

You make me so scared of myself
This time i feel that I could kill someone
Kill someone
You make me so scared of myself
This time I feel that I could crash into your, crash
Into your mind

Then you
You dont feel anything
You dont feel anything
You dont feel anything
You dont feel anything

You make me so scared of myself
This time I feel that I could kill someone
Kill someone
You make me so scared of myself
This time I feel that I could crash into your, crash
Into your mind
