If you live your time will come
Say, if you live your time will come
So child don't mess with that cotton sack
It'll scratch you knees and bend your back
And if you live your time will come

If you live your day will come
If you live your day will come
Child don't play with those pots and pans
They'll soon enough ruin your pretty hands
And if you live your time will come

If you live a day will come
If you live a day will come
When the sun will shine and the crops will grow
And you think you're not gonna worry no more
But if you live your time will come

If you live your time will come
Say, if you live your time will come
So child don't mess with that cotton sack
It'll scratch you knees and bend your back
And if you live your time will come
