People say I'm always using my fame
So you point and smile
But I don't care if it's true, it's always the same

Well I, I keep them wondering why
There's a fire deep inside
You can eat your heart out
I ain't gonna, I ain't gonna, I ain't gonna die

People tell me what's right and wrong
And I don't give a damn if you like this song
And don't turn your back and look at me that way

Yes I, I keep them wondering why
There's a fire deep inside
You can eat your heart out
I ain't gonna, I ain't gonna, I ain't gonna die

No, no, I'm never gonna die
Eat your heart out, baby

Yes I, I keep them wondering why
There's a fire deep inside
You can eat your heart out
I ain't gonna, I ain't gonna, I ain't gonna die

I'm never gonna die
There's a fire deep inside
No, I'm never gonna die, never gonna die

No, no
