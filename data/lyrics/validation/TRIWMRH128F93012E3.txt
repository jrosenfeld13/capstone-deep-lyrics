Illuminate the heart of my intention

There is no clandestine motive on my side

I'll shadow my affection till this tension

Cuts a swath across this city a mile wide

Everywhere there's people holding hands here

I can barely hold myself together

Heart is bona fide

Still won't set the ache aside

Blown to smithereens inside

And concealed in me

Where a patience used to be

Now just void and vacancy

I've scribbled every ridicule on creased notes

Eyes are closed and I am counting down from ten

I'm carrying a rifle in my trenchcoat

To make sure they will not question you again

Swallowed by a crowd it always strikes me

I am never this alone on my own

Heart is bona fide

Still won't set the ache aside

Blown to smithereens inside

And concealed in me

Where a patience used to be

Now just void and vacancy

If I wrote a song like Daniel Treacy

Would you then consider wasting time on me?
