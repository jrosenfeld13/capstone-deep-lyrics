[Intro]
*crack pipe hit*
That shit good

[Chorus]
Crack Rock Steady
Are ya ready to stop
The rotten blue menace?
Let's go kill us a cop
Crack Rock Steady
Are you ready?
Living above the law!

[Verse]
Po' little lice, the po' little screws
The whitest gang crew, the hated boys in blue
Like scabies on the street, they infest the beat
Fucking my life but I won't admit defeat to them!
Above the law, above the law come now
No copper will be safe till they are dead and done now
Let's lay em down low, let's hang em up high
Let's take all of these piggies, and have them crucified!

[Chorus]
Crack Rock Steady
Are ya ready to stop
The rotten blue menace?
Let's go kill us a cop
Crack Rock Steady
Are you ready?
Living above the law!

[Verse]
Hardcore, rugged and raw
On the streets of New York, we live above the fucking law
It don't matter the color of your skin
As long as you not scandalous, commit no sin
To me or my tribe
It would not be wise
Time to smell the ganja, open up your fucking eyes
Step back, keep your attitude in check
And give the crack rock steady most respect

[Chorus]
Crack Rock Steady
Are ya ready to stop
The rotten blue menace?
Let's go kill us a cop
Crack Rock Steady
Are you ready?
Living above the law!

[Verse]
Don't ya know that satan is the man?
So listen very close because we got a little plan:
We're gonna have to execute some rich important people
Gonna burn down all the churches and topple all the steeples
See a frown? turn that cross upside down
Grab a gun or baseball bat, let's go to fuckin town!
Let's kill the police, I'll be saying little more
But when the cops come to your door
Don't forget the choice is yours!

[Chorus]
Crack Rock Steady
Are ya ready to stop
The rotten blue menace?
Let's go kill us a cop
Crack Rock Steady
Are you ready?
Living above the law!

[Verse - Popeye]
Riot sounds, police comes around
With the bass and drums we'll knock 'em down
Chop em up with the riffs and in the stew
Drinking pot liquor made of boys in blue (Pick it up!)
Someone way up livin' in those high-rise castles
Wishing with the hope that I lick they assholes
With the beat we burn down those big brass doors
Hear me now, rock steady

[Chorus]
Crack Rock Steady
Are ya ready to stop
The rotten blue menace?
Let's go kill us a cop
Crack Rock Steady
Are you ready?
Living above the law!

Crack Rock Steady
Are ya ready to stop
The rotten blue menace?
Let's go kill us a cop
Crack Rock Steady
Are you ready?
Living above the law!
