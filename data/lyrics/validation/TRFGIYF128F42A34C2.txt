Yesterday I walked for miles
From a town named Blue
I left you smoking cigarettes
And dancing in saloons
When morning breaks you'll read this letter
But I'll be on the moon
I'm traveling on
But oh, I'll miss you

Yesterday I watched the TV, gave me an idea
If words and thoughts and pictures can be focused through the air
Well maybe we're just memories in the great atmosphere...
I'll let you know when I get there

You keep breaking my heart;
Keep breaking my heart
(3x)
Keep breaking my.....
(2x)
Lady, that was hard

Today I settled with my past
And now there is no going back
To broken homes and memories
And all the things that make me me
You were my love from the town Blue
And I'll always remember you...

Sometimes things change
Sometimes things change...
And I did, too
