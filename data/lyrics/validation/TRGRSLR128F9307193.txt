It's taken you so long
Where can you be?
I woulda laid my life down for you
Nothing seems real, nothing seems real
Now that you're gone

Have you seen the sister's blue-eyed curls of gold
Hell and no one there to be seen
The sunlight looks down
Stripped bare to the ground
Held by the leaves

Chorus:
Been crowded in the wings
Mostly I don't mind
Been crowded in the wings
Then it's you I find
Then it's you I find
Then it's you I find

Two hundred yards in front of the man
He could never see his way to another day
This time meant the same, cold, cold, cold
Cold once again

(Chorus)
You brought me to the mother of mountains
You brought me to
And no one reads to you at night
And all your lies came to pass
Just something I said
Made you turn your life in

(Chorus)

(Chorus)
Been crowded in the wings
Been crowded in the wings
Been crowded in the wings
Been crowded in the wings
