Can't talk
Won't need
Tight eyes
Can't see
No rest
Can't sleep
My heart feels weak
I have the tendency to totally depend on you, they're right
I know I need to give it up
I have the tendency to totally depend on you, they're right
I know I need to give it up
Push up all my love
Push up all my love
I can't get enough
Push up all my love
Flows through my blood
What you give
Baby, I can't get enough
I'm hooked
All tied up
Aching and waiting for your tender touch
I have the tendency to totally depend on you, they're right
I know I need to give it up
I have the tendency to totally depend on you, they're right
I know I need to give it up
Push up all my love
Push up all my love
I can't get enough
Push up all my love
Push up all my love
Hungry for that drug
I can't get enough
Push up all my love
Push up, push up, push up all my love
Push up, push up, push up all my love
Push up, push up, push up all my love
Push up, push up, push up all my love
Push up all my love
Push up all my love
I can't get enough
Push up all my love
Push up all my love
Hungry for that drug
I can't get enough
Push up all my love
Just keep on pushing that love
