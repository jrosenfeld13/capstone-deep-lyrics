[Verse 1]
Mirror, mirror
Do you like what you see?
I'll dance for you
And you'll dance for me
Who says a woman cannot serve?
It would be my pleasure
Who says it is not my destiny
To let you control me

[Chorus]
Underneath the disco light
Everybody's feeling alright
Get on your hands and knees
And praise the new deity
Serve the ego, serve the ego

[Verse 2]
Two ships sailing on a neon sea
Eat the flesh, spit out the seeds
Feathered hair and lam?(pronounced la-may)heels
What turns me on is so surreal

[Chorus]
Underneath the disco light
Everybody's feeling alright
Get on your hands and knees
And praise the new deity
Serve the ego, serve the ego

[Bridge]
Tutt tutt
To discover
Oh no
Yesterday's lover

[Chorus]
Underneath the disco light
Everybody's feeling alright
Get on your hands and knees
And praise the new deity
Serve the ego, serve the ego
