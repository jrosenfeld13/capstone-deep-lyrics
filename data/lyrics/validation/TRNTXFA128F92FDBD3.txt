Lovers In Japan
[Verse 1]
Lovers keep on the road you're on
Runners until the race is run
Soldiers, you've got to soldier on
Sometimes even the right is wrong

[Hook]
They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day we're gonna get out

[Verse 2]
Tonight maybe we're gonna run
Dreaming of the Osaka sun
Ohhhh ohh, ohh...
Dreaming of when the morning comes

[Hook]
They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day the sun will come out

Reign of Love
[Verse 1]
Reign of love
I can't let go
To the sea I offer this heavy load
Locust wind
Lift me up
I'm just a prisoner in a reign of love

[Verse 2]
Locust wind
Here I stop
How I wish I'd spoken up
To a reign of love

[Verse 3]
Reign of love by the church we're waiting
Reign of love on my knees go praying
How I wish I'd spoken up
Away get carried on a reign of love
