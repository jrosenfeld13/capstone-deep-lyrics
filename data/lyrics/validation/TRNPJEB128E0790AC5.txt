I've got a feeling
How about that?
It's got me reeling
How about that?
This throbbing in my brain
So strange I can't explain
But I like it (I like it)
Umm (like it)
How about that?

My heart stops beating
How about that?
With every meeting
How about that?
Whenever you are near
My mind is never clear
An I like it (I like it)
I like it
How about that?

I can't control myself
Whenever you're around
When you press your lips to mine
The world turns upside down

A-baby, baby, baby, can't you see
A-what you're doing to me?
I'm all mixed up, dizzy as can be
Umm, umm, umm

Yes, I love you
How about that?

Can't do without you
How about that?

Baby won't you understand
And take me by my hand
'Cause I like it (I like it)
Umm, like it
How about that?

Baby, baby, baby, baby, can't you see
What you're doing to me?
I'm all mixed up, dizzy as can be
Umm, umm, umm-mmm

Yes, I love you
How about that?
Can't do without you
How about that?

Please won't you understand
And take me by the hand
'Cause I like it (I like it)
Umm, like it
How about that?

FADES-

How about that?

How about that?
