[Verse 1]
A devil in a midnight mass
He preyed behind stained glass
A memory of Sunday class
Resurrected from the past

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold your breath and count to four
Pinky swears dont work no more
Footsteps down the hallway floor
Getting closer to my door
I was alive, but now Im singing

[Chorus]
Silent night for the rest of my life
Silent night for the rest of my life
Violent knight at the edge of your knife
Forgive me, Father wont make it right
Silent night for the rest of my life
Silent night at the edge of your knife
Youre guilty!

[Verse 2]
A devil in a midnight mass
Killed the boy inside the man
The holy water in his hands
Can never wash away his sins

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold your breath and count to four
Pinky swears dont work no more
Put my trust in God that day
Not the man that taught his way
I was alive, but now Im singing

[Chorus]
Silent night for the rest of my life
Silent night for the rest of my life
Violent knight at the edge of your knife
Forgive me, Father wont make it right
Silent night for the rest of my life
Silent night at the edge of your knife
Youre guilty!

[Bridge/Outro]
Whisper, whisper, dont make a sound
Your bed is made, its in the ground
Whisper, whisper, dont make a sound
Your bed is made, its in the ground
Whisper, whisper, dont make a sound
Your bed is made, its in the ground
Whisper, whisper, dont make a sound
Your bed is made, its in the ground
Whisper, whisper, dont make a sound
Your bed is made, its in the ground
Whisper, whisper, dont make a sound
Your bed is made and its in the ground!
