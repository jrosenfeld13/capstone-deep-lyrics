Every night the stars come out to light another town
Just because I'm lonely doesn't mean that gets me down
I cruise the local drive-in watchin' lovers holdin' hands
Like movie stills of Coupe de Villes and Japanese sedans

Chorus:
Where's the party?
Where's the party?
Everybody I know say they expect me to go to the party

Sometimes I wish the radio would learn another song
I'd stay at home and watch TV if there was somethin' on
Ooh but why should I get all dressed up when there's no place to go
Still everybody looks at me as if they think I know

Chorus:
Where's the party?
Where's the party?
Everybody I see say they expect to see me at the party

I could stay here all night long
Wait for her to call
Or I could put my Walkman on
And never care at all

Still every night the stars come out to light another town
And just because I'm lonely doesn't mean that gets me down

Chorus:
Where's the party?
Where's the party?
Everybody I know say they'd expect her to show at the party
