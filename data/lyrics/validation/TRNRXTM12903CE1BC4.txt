And I said hello
I ran into you the other day
And you looked away

Another halo
The only thing you're gonna need
If you wanna be

Another face and you're inviting
But you're frightening
And it's only make believe
When you're upside down

Another playboy
You wanted to think you're really something
But you're really nothing

Ever dayglo
You're probably all in disarray
Nothing much to say

A candy face and paint by numbers
Even dumber
And it's only make believe
When you're upside down

Candy's wanting you and now I can't take it
Candy's wanting to now please don't fake it

A candy face . .
