[Verse 1]
There are people that say what you wanna hear
Even on a raining day they'll tell you the sky is clear
When you really really love someone
Am I right when I say that you want them near?
And if you can't even tell them things that they wanna hear

[Chorus]
Always, forever
All things she said
Never say never
Those simple lies that she fed
I will never leave you
All the love I thought she had
But can you blame me, no
Because that's what she said
That's what she said
She told me we'd see forever
That's what she said, she said, yeah

[Verse 2]
And there are people that say what they really mean
She said she'd always be there
She said she'd always care
But just when you think that you can
Trust that someone you love
Tell me why, or do you know
How stars can fall from above?

[Chorus]
Always, forever
All things she said
Never say never
Those simple lies that she fed
I will never leave you
All the love I thought she had
But can you blame me, no
Because that's what she said
That's what she said
She told me we'd see forever
That's what she said, she said, yeah

[Verse 3]
Because you made promises
That you couldn't keep
But you're not hurting yourself
You're only hurting me (you're only hurting me)
Why would you say things that you really didn't mean? (you really mean)
Oh how can I make you see
Just what you did to me?
Oh, you said how much you really cared
Just when I thought I was in love
Girl, how could you dare?
If I were you I could not lie even once
To the face of the one
That I love so much

[Chorus]
Always, forever
All things she said
Never say never
Those simple lies that she fed
I will never leave you
All the love I thought she had
But can you blame me, no
Because that's what she said
That's what she said
She told me we'd see forever
That's what she said, she said, yeah
