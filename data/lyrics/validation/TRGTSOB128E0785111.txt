[Verse 1]
I sit at my table and wage war on myself
It seems like it's all, it's all for nothing
I know the barricades and I know the mortar in the wall breaks
I recognize the weapons, I've used them well

[Chorus]
This is my mistake, let me make it good
I raised the wall and I will be the one to knock it down

[Verse 2]
I've a rich understanding of my finest defenses
I proclaim that claims are left unstated, I demand a rematch
I decree a stalemate, I divine my deeper motives
I recognize the weapons, I've practiced them well
I fitted them myself

[Chorus]
It's amazing what devices you can sympathize (Empathize)
This is my mistake, let me make it good
I raised the wall and I will be the one to knock it down

[Bridge]
Reach out for me and hold me tight
Hold that memory, let my machine talk to me
Let my machine talk to me

[Verse 3]
This is my world and I am the World Leader Pretend
This is my life and this is my time
I have been given the freedom to do as I see fit
It's high time I raised the walls that I've constructed

[Chorus]
It's amazing what devices you can sympathize (Empathize)
This is my mistake, let me make it good
I raised the wall and I will be the one to knock it down

[Outro]
You fill in the mortar, you fill in the harmony
You fill in the mortar, I raised the wall
And I'm the only one, I will be the one to knock it down
