We lived our little drama
We kissed and a feel a while
And stars fell on Alabama that night

I can't forget the glamour
Your eyes held onto the light
And stars fell on Alabama last night

I never planned in my imagination
A situation so heavenly
Our very land that no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me

Hear my heart beat like a hammer
My arms wrapped around you tight
And stars fell on Alabama last night

I never planned in my imagination
A situation so heavenly
Our very land that no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me

Hear my heart beat like a hammer
My arms wound around you tight
A star fell on Alabama last night

((One more time boys))

Yes we lived our little drama
We kissed on the dune so what
And stars fell on Alabama last night
