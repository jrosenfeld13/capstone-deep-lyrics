Dont dont close your heart to how you feel
Dream and dont be afraid the dreams not real
Close your eyes pretend its just the two of us again
Make believe this moments here to stay

Touch touch me the way you used to do
I know tonight could be all Ill have with you
From now on youll be with someone else instead of me
So tonight lets build this memory for the last time

Hold me now dont cry dont say a word just
Hold me now and I will know though were apart
Well always be together forever in love
What do you say when words are not enough

Time time will be kind once were apart and
Your tears tears will have no place in your heart I wish
I I could say how much Ill miss you, when youre gone
All my love for you will go on and on and

Hold me now dont cry dont say a word just
Hold me now and try to understand
That I hope at last youve found what youve been searching for
And though I wont be there anymore I will always love you
(Hold me now dont cry)

Dont say a word just hold me now and I will know though
Were apart well always be together forever in love
What do you say when words are not enough
What can I say now my words are not enough
