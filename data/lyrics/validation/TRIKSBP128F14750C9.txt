She Was A Friend Of Mine
Ooh yeah

Oh-oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-eh
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-eh

I trusted her with him
That's where the story begins
We talked of boys and men
They all came second then

I made a sacrifice
And trusted all her advice
There was no need to fight
Things were so simple then

One by one she broke her promises
I guess she thought that she could take my man
I just gotta let her know
His love is for me, and that's the way the story goes

She was a friend of mine
Or so I thought at the time
How could I be so blind to trust her with my man
She fooled me with her eyes
And hid behind a disguise
I've read between the lines and now I understand

Oh-oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-eh
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-eh

She said she'd make it right
And talk to him late at night
Told me to take it slow
But little did I know

She had a master plan
I had my head in the sand
But now it's plain to see
She chose him over me

Every day she's smiling in my face
But every night she's trying to take my place
She said she'd always be right there for me
But now I can see the kind of help I just don't need

She was a friend of mine
Or so I thought at the time
How could I be so blind to trust her with my man (to trust her with my man)
She fooled me with her eyes
And hid behind a disguise
I've read between the lines and now I understand (and now I understand)

Oh-oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-eh
(And now I understand)
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-eh
(And now I understand)
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-eh
(She was a friend of mine)
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-eh
(How could I be so blind)

Never thought friends could be so cruel
I never thought you could break all the rules
Now it's you who looks like a fool
Cos what goes around, comes around

Ooh-yeah

She was a friend of mine (she was a friend of mine)
Or so I thought at the time
How could I be so blind to trust her with my man (to trust her with my man)
She fooled me with her eyes
And hid behind a disguise
I've read between the lines and now I understand (and now I understand)

Oh-oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-eh
(Yeah-yeah-eh)
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-eh

She was a friend of mine (she was a friend of mine)
Or so I thought at the time
How could I be so blind to trust her with my man
She fooled me with her eyes (fooled me with her eyes)
And hid behind a disguise
I've read between the lines and now I understand (now I understand)

And now I understand
Now I understand
And now I understand
