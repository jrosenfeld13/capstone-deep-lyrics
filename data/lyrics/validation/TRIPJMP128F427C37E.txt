You and me sitting on a bench
Watching the day go by
No one paying us any attention
Not even to ask us why

Sunshine in our eyes
We're watching it set as we watched it rise
You and me sitting on a bench
Watching the day go by

You and me sitting on a bus
On the front seat at the top
Watching the people who don't look like us
And going way past our stop

Travelling everywhere
We got no money but what do we care?
You and me sitting on a bus
On the front seat at the top

Ah, looks like we're sticking together
Ah, looks like lasting forever

You and me by the side of the road
In the morning feeling bright
Watching cars coming and watching them go
Still thinking we'll be home tonight

As the day goes on and the lifts are few
We think it might take us a day or two
You and me by the side of the road
In the morning feeling bright

Oh, looks like we're sticking together
Ah, looks like lasting forever
