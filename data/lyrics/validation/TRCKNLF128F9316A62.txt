I see them argue
The way that we used to
He's got his head in his heads
She's staring at her shoes

Her spirits talking but her body's standing in the way
Her spirits talking....

We were thieves under that blanket
Like magnet poles
Pulling out the poison
From deep within our soles

I was a blind man
Reading your body like Braille
I was a blind man
I thought I heard you say
Something beautiful in your own way
You were softening
Floating on the breeze
Of my memories

We live with our eyes half open
The sun spinning 'round the room

In the wisdom of words unspoken
You said
Something beautiful in your own way
Something truthful
You were softening
Floating on the breeze
Of my memories

Something beautiful
Something truthful
I hear a softening
Floating on the breeze
Of my memories
