There's a man who needs my tending a mind so twisted I must bring on ending
He's on the run from those who watched him become a manic behind realism
Now he's wearing a face to deceive a mask of intense baroque imagery
Can I reveal his terror in disguise?

His sedition is known worldwide but yet he seems to slip inside
Now he's wearing a face to deceive a mask of intense baroque imagery

(Chorus:)
The manic's mask (3x)

Got me in his grip
Once again he's struck a victim but once again he's left me ridden

(Chorus)
Behold the end of the merciless man who himself perished without mercy
I will find you watch and see your covered world will end with me

(Chorus)
It's off and I'm free!!
