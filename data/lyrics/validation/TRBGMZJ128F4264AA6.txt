There was a time when I didn't know
If I would ever see a sign of real love
Until I met You I didn't know
About true happiness, about true devotion

I could have a faith, a faith to move a mountain
Without love I'd be worth nothing
I could give all my money away
But without love I would gain nothing

I know that You're the main connection
That can put me on the track
Headed in the right direction

This is the way of love, oh yeah
This is the way of love
There'll be no doubt about it
I know it's true

This is the way, this is the way of love
This is the way of love
(This is the way of love)
This is the way of love

Love is patient, love is kind
That's the kind of love that You give me all the time
I like a love that keeps no record of wrongs
Loves me when I'm good, loves me when I'm not
I know whether night or day
I'll be waiting for the moment just to hear You say

This is the way of love
Oh yeah, this is the way of love
There'll be no doubt about it
I know it's true

This is the way, this is the way of love
This is the way of love, oh yeah, this is the way of love
There'll be no doubt about it, I know it's true
This is the way, this is the way of love

This is the way of love
(This is the way of love)
This is the way of love
(I know, I know, I know, I know)
This is the way of love
(This is the way of love)

Love is patient, love is kind
That's the kind of love that You give me all the time
I like a love that keeps no record of wrongs
Loves me when I'm good, loves me when I'm not
I know whether night or day
I'll be waiting for the moment just to hear You say

This is the way of love
Oh yeah, this is the way of love
There'll be no doubt about it
I know it's true

This is the way, this is the way of love
This is the way of love, oh yeah, this is the way of love
There'll be no doubt about it, I know it's true
(No doubt about it)
This is the way, this is the way of love
