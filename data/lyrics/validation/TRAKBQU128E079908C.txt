When the dreams are lost and gone away
And you need some one to make your day
I'll be your inspiration
I'll be your inspiration

When there comes a time your hope is gone
And you need some help to carry on
I'll be your inspiration
I'll be your inspiration

I'll be your inspiration
I'll be your inspiration

Cos when you look into my eyes
You can see there's no disguise
Don't be afraid to need some one
You don't have to be alone
Don't be afraid to need some one
You don't have to be alone

I'll be your inspiration
I'll be your inspiration

Cos when you look into my eyes
You can see there's no disguise
Don't be afraid to need some one
You don't have to be alone
Don't be afraid to need some one
You don't have to be alone

I'll be your inspiration
I'll be your inspiration

I'll be your inspiration
I'll be your inspiration
