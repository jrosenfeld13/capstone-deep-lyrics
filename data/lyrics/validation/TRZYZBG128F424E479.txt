Straight edge - the discipline
The key to selfliberation is abstinence from the destructive escapism of
Intoxication. I separate from the poison - a mindlessness
I've always abhored. Usage will only increase the pain, a truth I
Constantly see ignored. The pollutants that kill the body breed
Apathy within the mind. The substances that once brought
Release in the end will always confine
From drug-clouded lungs and veins motviation dissipates
Imprisoned within addiction
Abuse increases until death overtakes
Enslaved by concupiscence, promiscuity leads to despair
Victims used and abandoned by
Liars who professed to care. Self-exiled from their insanity
Striving to attain higher levels of purity. The beauty in life
Is mine to know. Amidst the ruin I survive. I've got to stay free
Damage everywhere - infections at every turn. Through my
Refusal to partake I saved myself. Abstinence was the beginning
What's important is what's done with the freedom step by
Step I overcome. Alone I climb the staircase to edification
