Well sure has been a while
Well I was just here killing some time
Watching people go by

Left my sins down by the sea
Don't you know that no-one likes to be upstaged

Well I don't buy that
I don't believe you'd leave without me

Well I don't buy that
I don't believe you'd leave without me

So please don't go away
Oh please don't go away
I can't take the fall

Pure intentions and a clear conscience
Sometimes friends get in the way
Don't you know that no-one likes to be upstaged

Well I don't buy that
I don't believe you'd leave without me

Well I don't buy that
I don't believe you'd leave without me
