Happiness is an illusion
Hold me close to see me a little more
Until my body feels your magic touch and seals my skin before it rots
My castle is a great illusion

Now I'm everyone, now I'm everyone, now I'm everyone
Now I'm everyone, now I'm everyone, it's less than I've ever been

Hairy eyes are an obstruction
Help me die don't wanna rush ya
And all I need is a philosophy of noise to help me laugh and breathe
My castle is a great illusion

Now I'm everyone, now I'm everyone, now I'm everyone
Now I'm everyone, now I'm everyone, it's less than I've ever been
Now I'm everyone, now I'm everyone, now I'm everyone
Now I'm everyone, now I'm everyone, it's less than I've ever been

This is the one
This is the one
This is the one
This is the one

This is the one
This is the one
This is the one
This is the one

This is the one
This is the one
This is the one
This is the one
