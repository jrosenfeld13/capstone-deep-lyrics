When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
Those pretty, pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd
Someone picked you from the bunch
One glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me to take a second look

Oh baby, give me one more chance
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in his arms
Mm, hmm
Yes I do
I want you back

Tryin' to live without your love
Is one long sleepless night
Let me show you girl
That I know wrong from right
Every street you walk on
I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the girl
I didn't even want around

Oh baby, all I need is one more chance
Won't you please let me
Back to your heart
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go
Oh now since I see you in his arms

Oh baby, I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in his arms
Oh baby, give me one more chance
Won't you please let me
Back to your heart

Oh baby I need one more chance ha
I tell ya that I love you
