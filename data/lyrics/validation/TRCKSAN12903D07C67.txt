You lost your tan from a few months ago
Now that red dress looks like blood lying on snow
I feel my pulse start to increase the flow
On this cold, winter's night, with such beauty on show

You don't like winter, you're a summer girl
Sun burnt and barefoot, your body unfurled
But I can see you're a Celtic princess
And in pale, northern lights, you're at your very best

My goodness!
Well, how do you do?
It's taken generations
Of lucky breeding
To make you
To make you

In my life's challenges, you must be first prize
I can see gold in the light of your eyes
My honest soul, it just yearns to be free
And I'm sure it would happen, if you lie with me

My goodness!
Well, how do you do?
It's taken generations
Of lucky breeding
To make you
They made you

You lost your tan from a few months ago
Now that red dress looks like blood lying on snow
I feel my pulse start to increase the flow
On this cold, winter's night, with such beauty on show
On this cold, winter's night, with such beauty on show
On this cold, winter's night, with such beauty on show
