You can talk about the glory of the coming of the Lord
You can talk about that city where we'll live in one accord
But there's more to His redemption than ascending up on high
And looking to the future for a mansion in the sky

You've got to walk in the light of the sacred living word
You must live to be blameless, obedient and pure
And as you become a temple of His ever present love
Oh, the Savior lives within you like He lives somewhere above

Somewhere above's a city where the streets are made of gold
Somewhere below a burning lake awaits the sinner's soul
There are those who live in hell most every single day
While others taste of heaven as they lift their hands and pray

You've got to walk in the light of the sacred living word
You must live to be blameless, obedient and pure
And as you become a temple of His ever present love
Oh, the Savior lives within you like He lives somewhere above

Somewhere above our Savior sits alive as He can be
At the right hand of the father clothed in victory
He sent the holy spirit as a gift so we could see
His kingdom's come, His will is done through folks like you and me

You've got to walk in the light of the sacred living word
You must live to be blameless, obedient and pure
And as you become a temple of His ever present love
Oh, the Savior lives within you like He lives somewhere above
