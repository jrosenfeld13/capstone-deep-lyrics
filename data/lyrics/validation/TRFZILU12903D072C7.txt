Up tight you better realize
I never hide and I'll never get mine alone
'cause of the simple fact
Fulfill you like to get a lot
I call greed but I'll never get high alone
It don't mean the same thing
There won't be nothing that will tear us apart
Can't take you away from me
You're so blind open your eyes
I know you'll see that I'll never get mine alone
'cause I don't care about it
Diseased you better realize
I'm on my knees and I'll never get mine alone
It just don't mean the same thing...
