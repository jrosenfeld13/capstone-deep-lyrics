You ask me why I don't smile
Is there something troublin' me
Just open your eyes and look around
And tell me what do you see

Can you understand the things people do
And the way they treat each other
And tell me how far has man really come
When today he's still killing his brother

It makes no difference where you do it
Or what name you use
I know if things keep going this way
Everyone's gonna lose
Everybody's gonna lose

We're doing alright with material things
You can tell by the way we live
But with all these things man has learned how to do
Still hasn't learned how to give

If you don't have the answers right now
I'll see you after a while
But if next time I still look this way
You'll know why I don't smile...
