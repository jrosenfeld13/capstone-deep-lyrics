Well, I gotta get drunk and I sure do dread it
'Cause I know just what I'm gonna do
I'll start to spend my money
Call everybody honey and wind up singing the blues
I'll spend my whole paycheck on
Some old wreck and brother I can name you a few
But I gotta get drunk and I sure do dread it 'cause
I know just what I'm gonna do
I gotta get drunk I just can't stay sober there's
A lot of good people in town
Who'd like to hear me holler see me spend my dollars
And I wouldn't think of lettin' 'em down
There's a lot of doctors that tell me
That I'd better start slowin' it down
But there's more old drunkers
Than there are old doctors
So I guess we'd better have another round
