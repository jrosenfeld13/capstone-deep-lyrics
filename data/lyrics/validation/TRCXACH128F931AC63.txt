Trace the veins on your arm
Count the polka dots of rain
If it prevents you from harm
If it distracts you from pain

Celebrate the mundane in the place of the divine
Casting a line to the other side

Alone in a room she's renaming the colors underneath the sun
In a lucid dream I tried to bring back things
I found for you in the ground
In made-up towns with fabricated skies of blue
But I couldn't bring them back from the dimension of black and white

They were trapped above the sun
Wait for me underneath the sun in the black and white
