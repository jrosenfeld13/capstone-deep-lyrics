I'm a, I'm a
I'm a dreamer

Love life and laughter is all I believe
My savior is pure now because my lonely heart would bleed
I never learned how to hold love and stay strong to love
Now I close my eyes now and I'm dreaming right where I belong

Here we lie all alone am I dreaming?
Your heart's smooth my soul is unbelieving
Now you see the me and I'm feeling, I'm feeling
I feel your hands, your lips, the heat of your body
Whisper your love to me say that you love me
Please just love me down and never leave me
I'm a dreamer

Here we lie all alone am I dreaming?
Your heart's smooth my soul is unbelieving
Now you see the me and I'm feeling, I'm feeling
I feel your hands, your lips, the heat of your body
Whisper your love to me say that you love me
Please just love me down and never leave me
I'm a dreamer

Am I a dreamer?
