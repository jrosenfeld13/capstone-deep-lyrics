Well, I'll give you love that's above and beyond the call of love
And I'll never ever make you cry

Well a poor boys chances for a pretty girls glances
Are somnetimes very few

Here's what I'll offer you

That I'd found my destiny
Now I want to carry you off and marry you if you will agree

And, I'll give you love that's above and beyond the call of love
And I'll never, ever make you cry

Yes, I'll give you love that's above and beyond the call of love
And love's somnething that money can't buy
