Growing up
Around these streets
Never really felt quite like
Like anything

It's where nothing
Has a chance
To really go somewhere
That you can't

My love is exploitation
And the passing celebration
And I don't want to feel
Like a part of history

Going through this town
Upside down
Weekends are railway rides
Just a few
Promises broken
At quarter past five
Burning fires
On the railway hillsides

My love is exploitation
And the passing celebration
And I don't want to feel
Like a part of history

And the grass is greener
On the other side
It's where I wanna be
Somewhere that she can really see

We all go out like we come in
Kicking and screaming

We all go out like we come in
Kicking and screaminggg

We all go out like we come innn
Kicking and screaminggg!

My love is exploitation
And the passing celebration
And I don't want to feel
Like a part of history

And the grass is greener
On the other side
It's where I wanna be
Somewhere that she can really see
