We were speaking softly behaving badly
Our painted bodies in the secret morning
You are not quiet across the wooden floor
And the kitchen is flood by the bathroom lights
And I can't hear a thing underneath the door
All the boys with directionless hair are rough
Languorous girls in undertaker make up
We the vehicles on our collision course
Screaming like we've been blessed by a higher force
And I can't hear a thing underneath the door
No I can't hear anything
Because everybody here will always disappear
And we are helpless on our hands and buckled knees
We the vehicles please
And I can't hear a thing
Because everybody here will always disappear
This is no escape art
Yeah everybody here will always disappear
And we are helpless on our hands and buckled knees
We the vehicles please
We the vehicles please
