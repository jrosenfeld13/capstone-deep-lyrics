[Verse 1: Marvin Gaye]
You're alone all the time
Does it ever puzzle you? Have you asked why?
You seem to fall in love and out again
Do you really ever love or just pretend, oh, baby?
Why fool yourself?
Don't be afraid to help yourself
It's never too late, too late to

[Chorus: Marvin Gaye]
Stop, look, yes, listen to your heart
Hear what it's saying
Stop, look, listen to your heart
Hear what it's saying
Love, oh, love, love

[Verse 2: Diana Ross]
Though you try, you can't hide
All the things you really feel, this time decide
That you will open up, let it in
There's no shame in sharing love you feel within
So jump right in
Head over heels and fall right in
It's never too late, too late to

[Chorus] [Diana Ross]

[Chorus] [both]
