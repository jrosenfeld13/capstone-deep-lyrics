Empire of blood arise
Vengeance or our holy blood
Our Holy Grail, kill all the frail
Be our holy blood, our Holy Grail
Vengeance is mine
Says the lord
And I believe him
I believe him
Not a single straw shall nourish the enemy
No man shall give them enlightenment
No hand bid them aid
Every path will he find destroyed
Every road barred
Nothing but death, annihilation
And hatred shall greet him
Hatred shall greet him
Vengeance is mine
Says the lord
Yes, believe him!
