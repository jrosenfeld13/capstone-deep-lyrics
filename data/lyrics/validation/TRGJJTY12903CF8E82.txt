These lines on my face give up the time
This blood withering through my veins is life like wine
Drink to our last kiss and write a book about the mess
A life in vulgar poetry, a testament in rhyme
Incincerate while we can
So now I sit alone in the dark in the house we used to play the part
Empty rooms and photographs shout back in silence
Dead spaces echo an attack for the love of what we used to both call home
Wave a white flag and count me out
Recognize how sanity would feel
The space between these lines that I could never quite reveal
In the blink of an eye that's just too short to suffocate and kill
So now I sit alone in the dark in the house we used to play the part
Empty rooms and photographs shout back in silence
Dead spaces echo an attack for the love of what we used to both call home
It's been two weeks without a sign of anyone
I left the world behind cuz I don't wanna believe in love
Anxiety of a future we cannot command
Too broken for the test, too toxic for a stand
So I laid down and lost myself to the things I could not live down
We are the wings of doves too broke to fly, to carry on
So I laid down and lost myself to the things I could not live down
We are the wings of doves too broke to fly, to carry on
TO CARRY ON!
So now I sit alone in the dark in the house we used to play
Empty rooms and photographs in silence
As the memories come rushing back dead spaces echo an attack
All for the love we left in silence
