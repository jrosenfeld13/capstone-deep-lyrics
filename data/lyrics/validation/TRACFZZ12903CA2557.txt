The hour of parting is at hand
Sorrow ever awaits on joy
And has rendered me to (pieces)
Drink me deep
O death devour
Cover me with darkness
Paint me like death
I drown in remembrance
Sorrow ever awaits joy
And has rendered me to (pieces)
Requiem, Kyrie, Requiem
I drown in remembrance
Sorrow ever awaits on joy
And has rendered me to (pieces)
Requiem, Kyrie, Requiem
