You like to trail away from your excuses
And my heart breaks
Each and every time of the uses
A boy headed in a straight line down
A voice in a frown
Does it seem tame?
Or does it seem insane
Does it seem impressive?
And I won't say anything
If you get the message
And if there's time
I'll keep you guessing
Everything is not all right
You're afraid of losing
I hope it burns your eyes
I like to sit and complain with my mouth shut
Can you help me with a little something to cheer me up?
The road to happiness is a long, windy one
And I'm tired of being dumb
Does it seem tame? Or does it seem insane?
