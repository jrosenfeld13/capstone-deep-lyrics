Look at me, I'm a speck of sand
And I'm building dreams in a strangers land
Tell me, why do I care?
Tell me, why do I care?
Ev'ry time that I'm feelin' down
Well they pick me up and they spin me round
Tell me, where do we go
Tell me, where do we go from here?

What are we gonna find out
What are we gonna find out
In the wilderness
That this loneliness brings?

Just as long as there's two of us
Just as long as there's two of us
I'll carry on
Won't you hold me?

When is man gonna find out
When are we gonna find out
What the universe
Is just waiting to hear?

Just as long as there's two of us
Just as long as there's two of us
Just as long as there's two of us
We'll carry on
