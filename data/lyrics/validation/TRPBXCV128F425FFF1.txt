How far you go and what you say
Will never keep the tides away
The sea or the wind or the fog
Cut a window
Through a wall
Hello
Hello
Hello hello?
Hello? (hello hello hello)

If madness comes so much the better touche
If madness comes so much the better touche

A wicked week
And logic creed
I need water and a seat
The sea or the wind or the fog
And savor the way/weight that we fought?
A cup of snow
A snowflake kid
He is coming off the grid

Madness comes so much the better to sha--
If madness comes so much the better to sha--

Explosive path
I cannot dodge your draft
Because the air is like
Perfume from vikings

Hanging with
The brown rice clique
Tennyson and politics


[voice in the studio PA system]: Right here, this where its all gonna its
Gonna

Happen right here, right?)
(random screaming and whooooa-ing)

Madness comes so much the better to sha--
If madness comes so much the better to sha--

Grass grows warped
Shade of the county court
I know you want that spawn just to your liking
