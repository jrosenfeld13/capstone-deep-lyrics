You are part of the sky, fly away, away, awa
Don't you need to feel the ground you canno see?
Everywhere in everything is something new to know, to feel
Every part of the sky, beneath, there's angels at your feet

Aaaah-aaaah... and my eyes can't fail my mind...
Flying away...

You are waves on the sea, crashing down and down on me
Don't you need to reach the sky you cannot feel?
Sometimes when, you never smile, you always notice what you feel
Every wave on the sea, I couldn't drown you should I please

(repeat chorus)
