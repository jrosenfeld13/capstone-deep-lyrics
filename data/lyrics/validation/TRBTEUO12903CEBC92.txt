Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see

'Twas grace that taught my heart to feel
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers toils and snares
We have already come
'Twas grace that brought us save that far
And grace will lead us home

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see
