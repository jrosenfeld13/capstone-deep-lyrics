Johnny I said we were through
Just to see what you would do
You stood there, and hung your head
Made me wish that I were dead

Oh, Johnny get angry
Johnny get mad
Give me the biggest lecture that I ever had
I want a brave man, I want a cave man
Johnny show me that you care, really care for me

Every time you dance with me
You let Freddy cut in constantly
When he does, you never speak
Must you always be so meek?

Oh Johnny get angry, Johnny get mad
Give me the biggest lecture that I ever had
I want a brave man, I want a cave man
Johnny show me that you care, really care for me

Every girl wants someone who
She can always look up to
You know I love you, ofcourse
Let me know that youre the boss

Oh Johnny get angry, Johnny get mad
Give me the biggest lecture that I ever had
I want a brave man, I want a cave man
Johnny show me that you care, really care for me

Johnny, care for me
Johnny Johnny Johnny Johnny...
