Oh yeah, all right

Are you first teaching that to me
Then I hope that you can see
Time is not a shadow

If you could stand the test of time
Then I hope that you can find
The truth that you've been searching for

Make everything just right
Make everything just right
Make everything just right
Make everything just right

There will always be a fountain
As big as a mountain
Where the flow of love will glow

Just to catch you on this pleasure
As much as you can measure
Will take some time to know

Make everything just right
Make everything alright
Make everything just right

Make everything just right
Make everything alright
Make everything just right

Make everything just right
Make everything alright
Make everything just right

Make everything just right
Make everything alright
Make everything just right

Well, the viable life in which we thrive
And got to fish, is our favorite dish
Which we rely on to be strong just to carry on
Doing what we do best all day long

Well, best I guess just to keep rinking check
And make sure that you watch every step that you take
Well, to make everything alright
Well, like a peaceful world in the sunlight
We're gonna make it thrive

Make everything just right
Make everything alright
Yeah, make everything just right
Make everything alright

Just make everything just right
Make everything alright
Yeah, make everything just right
Make everything just right
