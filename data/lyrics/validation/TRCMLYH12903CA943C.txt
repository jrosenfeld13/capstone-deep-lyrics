[Verse 1]
If I were him
I'd know your birthday
Just what to get
The colours you wear
We'd borrow bikes
We'd ride on Sundays
And you'd review
The books I sent

[Chorus]
And I know
It takes twenty-two steps
From the walk to your door
Takes twenty-two steps
'Cause I've tried it before
And one day I'll knock
But just not
Yet

[Verse 2]
If I were him
I'd buy the raincoat
The orange one
That he forbade
We'd wait for rain
We'd walk by his house
In the front
Not by the lane

[Chorus]
And I know
It takes twenty-two steps
From the walk to your door
Takes twenty-two steps
'Cause I've tried it before
And one day I'll knock
But just not
Yet

[Bridge]
And I'm not so sure
That you would not say
Get out, don't step in
I would never try again
I'm not so sure
That you would not say
Get out, don't step in
I would never try again
I would never try again

[Chorus (Extended)]
Takes twenty-two steps
From the walk to your door
Takes twenty-two steps
'Cause I've tried it before
And one day I'll knock
Yeah, one day I'll knock
Takes twenty-two steps
From the walk to your door
Takes twenty-two steps
'Cause I've tried it before
And one day I'll knock
But just not
Yet

[Outro]
If I were him
I'd know your birthday
Wish
