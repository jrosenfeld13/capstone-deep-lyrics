There is a river, runs so deep and so wide
[?] by its side
Angels come down, wash themselves clean
By the waters of Jordan, from sin I am free

River runs clear and runs also slow
Springs out from paradise, where it does flow
Angels come down, wash themselves clean
By the waters of Jordan, from sin I am free

Goodbye [?] it's true
Sins are forgiven [?]
Angels come down, wash themselves clean
By the waters of Jordan, from sin I am free

[?]
[?] will wash them away
Angels come down, wash themselves clean
By the waters of Jordan, from sin I am free
