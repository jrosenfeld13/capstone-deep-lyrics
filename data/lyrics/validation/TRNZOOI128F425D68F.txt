[Verse 1]
All along the Western front
People line up to receive
She got the power in her hand
To shock you like you won't believe
Saw her in the Amazon
With the voltage running through her skin
Standing there with nothing on
She gonna teach me how to swim

[Chorus]
I said, "Ooh, girl!
Shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl
Turn me on with your electric feel"
I said, "Ooh, girl!
Shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl
Turn me on with your electric feel"

[Verse 2]
All along the Eastern shore
Put your circuits in the sea
This is what the world is for
Making electricity
You can feel it in your mind
Oh, you can do it all the time
Plug it in, change the world
You are my electric girl

[Chorus]
I said, "Ooh, girl!
Shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl
Turn me on with your electric feel"
I said, "Ooh, girl!
Shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl
Turn me on with your electric feel"

[Outro]
Do what you feel now!
Electric feel now
Do what you feel now!
Electric feel now
Do what you feel now!
Electric feel now
Do what you feel now!
Electric feel now
Do what you feel now!
