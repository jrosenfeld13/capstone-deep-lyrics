Everywhere I turn, I hurt someone
But there's nothing I can say to change the things I've done
I'd do anything within my power
I'd give everything I've got
But the path I seek is hidden from me now

Brother bear
I let you down
You trusted me
Believed in me
And I let you down
Of all the things I hid from you
I cannot hide the shame
And I pray someone
Something will come
To take away the pain

[Chorus]
There's no way out of this dark place
No hope, no future
I know I can't be free
But I can't see another way
And I can't face another day
