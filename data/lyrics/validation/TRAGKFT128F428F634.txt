Well I've always been a rounder
With a passion for the road
Respect for all the ladies
But easy come and easy go
Love was only in the movies
Not the answer to my dreams
But you're pushin' different buttons
And pullin' different strings

You've got my heart a-coverin'
Some unfamiliar ground
I've never felt like this before
Until you came around
If I ain't already fallin'
I guess it could be said
I'm walkin' mighty close to the edge

It's not too late to turn around
But I'm feeling quite concerned
One more kiss might take me
Past the point of no return
Oh, you've got me sendin' flowers
And all sorts of crazy things
I even caught myself a-gazin' at
A fourteen-carat ring

You've got my heart a-coverin'
Some unfamiliar ground
I've never felt like this before
Until you came around
If I ain't already fallin'
I guess it could be said
I'm walkin' mighty close to the edge
