Do you want me baby, yee
Do you want me baby, yeeeeeyeee
Do you need me baby, eeh, eeeh, yeeeeaaah

Dirty rumours have been running around about me
And what I, I say is
Can't tell a rumour if you wanted to, cos if you do
You'll have to get away
Don't you know what goes around comes around, about me
You'll have to get away
Do you wanna be mine, make up your mind, about me

Do you want me baby, eeeh
Do you want me baby, yeeeeeyeee
Do you need me baby, eeh, eeeh, yeeeeaaah

You don't want my heart
You don't want my mind
Baby see
You were just wasting my time
If you think it over baby, I will think it over till you know
What's on my mind

Do you want me baby, eeeh
Do you want me baby, yeeeeeyeee
Do you need me baby, eeh, eeeh, yeeeeaaah

Uh, sir
Uh, sir
Uh, sir
