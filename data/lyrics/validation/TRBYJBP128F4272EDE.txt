Lady Love, are you sad today?
Come and sway with me over here
Sorry sunlight jaded forever, I don't like it cold in the summer
No need for the wasteland of the pain anymore
My hands embrace the air every time I look at you
One last chance and we can burn the morrow
One last chance before tomorrow

I don't care where we go
I don't care what we do
Doesn't matter who we are
'Cause all we have is the broken calm of the sea
It's time to let things go
It's time to just be free

Junkie, come on now junkie
I'd like to find a way to kill the pain for you
Junkie, you are the cry of pain
I know that someday love and death will make you new

Lady Love, arose horizon, while we've been gone She holds my hand
I just want to mourn this forever, wanna sleep in love wherever
No need for the wasteland of the wounded sea
One last chance and we will burn the sorrow
One last chance before tomorrow

Junkie, come on now junkie
I'd like to find a way to kill the pain for you
Junkie, you are the cry of pain
I know that someday love and death will make you new

Junkie, come on now junkie
I'd like to find a way to kill the pain for you
Junkie, you are the cry of pain
I know that someday love and death will make you new
