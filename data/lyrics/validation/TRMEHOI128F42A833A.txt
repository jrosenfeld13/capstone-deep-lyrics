Well, I'm drifting and I'm drifting
Like a ship out on the sea
Drifting and I'm drifting
Like a ship out on the sea

Well, I ain't got nobody
In this world to care for me

If my baby
Would only take me back again
If my baby
Only take me back again

'Cause, darling, good for nothing
I haven't got no friend

I give you all my money
Tell me what more can I do
I give you all my money
Tell me what more can I do, can I do

You just a good little girl
You just won't be true

Bye bye, baby
Baby, bye bye, bye
Bye bye, baby
Baby, bye bye, bye

It's gonna be too late, baby
I'll be so far away
