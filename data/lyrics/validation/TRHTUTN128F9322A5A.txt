Well, it is such a useless waste
Filing all those folks away
But it's business as usual, today

See, they were tryin to get over
On a market that s been cornered
(carved by ol joe kennedy, and his like)

It doesn t have to be this way
The stigma s built to tilt the play
It doesn t have to be that way

Between lorrilard and escobar
The difference is who writes the laws

When genocide s a racket in itself

There is no debt to be fulfilled
By making people criminals
And turning loose the damned instead

The competition
Is made the villain
This market s covered
By bad muthas

It doesn t have to be this way
I hope I m free to see the day
When business ain t so usual - one day
