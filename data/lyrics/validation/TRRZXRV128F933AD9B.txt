Mammy sings wonderfully
Lamenting melodies
Then daddy comes home from work
He falls in and goes berserk
The priest calls around for tea
He always seems so terribly lonely
Talks of industrial school
As he looks at me so cruel
On Paddy's Day
Well, they marched in Amerikay
On Paddy's Day
Well they danced down Cricklewood way
On Paddy's Day
Well they sang around Botany Bay
On Paddy's Day
For my sanity I'll pray
Da fought the Black and Tans
So did our uncle Dan
Then there was civil war
And we ne'er saw Dan anymore
We all have to walk to Cobh
A family of 13, both young and old
Transport our poverty
To a room and a ditch cross the sea
On Paddy's Day
Well, they marched in Amerikay
On Paddy's Day
Well they danced down Cricklewood way
On Paddy's Day
Well they sang around Botany Bay
On Paddy's Day
For my sanity I'll pray
St. Patrick's Day
St. Patrick's Day
On Patrick's Day
On Patrick's Day
