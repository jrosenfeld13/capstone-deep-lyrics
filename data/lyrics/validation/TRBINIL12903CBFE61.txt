What I keep in my night table drawer
You wouldn't like to know
And you wouldn't wanna see
Where I go in my dreams
If I sleep at all

You, you never try to get me
You just wanted to have me
You have me
And you, you don't even taste me
You just eat and digest me

So I compose my cold, beaten bones
Into a lovely fake
Something nice to be around
Something easy to hold
A simple choice to make

You, you never try to get me
You just needed to have me
You have me
And you, you don't even taste me
You just eat and digest me

I hope you don't mind I leave traces behind
A girl in the snow
Maybe I'm scared
I won't find my way back
When you finally decide I should go
Why, why would you try to get me
When all you need is just a lovely fake
For your wall
I'm liquid running
There's a sea secret in me
It's plain to see it is rising
But I must be flowing liquid diamonds
