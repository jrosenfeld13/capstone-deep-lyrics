[Verse 1]
When I meet a special girl
She always lives somewhere else in the world
Don't want to call her on the phone
Wanna talk to her when I'm at home

[Chorus]
Move to Bremerton - we'll hang out
Move to Bremerton - we'll go all out
Move to Bremerton - will you be mine?

[Verse 2]
I'll change the street signs you drive down
So you end up in my town
I'll re-draw the maps all one by one
So they all lead to Bremerton

[Pre-Chorus]
Drop out of school and run away
Quit your job, you got a place to stay
Pack your bags and hitch a ride
Bremerton's a good place to reside

[Chorus]
Move to Bremerton - we'll hang out
Move to Bremerton - we'll go all out
Move to Bremerton - will you be mine?
Move to Bremerton - we'll hang out
Move to Bremerton - we'll go all out
Move to Bremerton - 'till the end of time

[Verse 3]
If you own a brain and use it too
You gotta know I have a crush on you
I'm a sucker for a level headed girl with a pretty smile
She gots to have ideas, yeah, and she gots to have style

[Pre-Chorus]
Drop out of school and run away
Quit your job, you got a place to stay
Pack your bags and hitch a ride
Bremerton's a good place to reside

[Chorus]
Move to Bremerton - we'll hang out
Move to Bremerton - we'll go all out
Move to Bremerton - will you be mine?
Move to Bremerton - we'll hang out
Move to Bremerton - we'll go all out
Move to Bremerton - 'till the end of time

[Chorus]
Move to Bremerton - we'll hang out (move to Bremer-)
Move to Bremerton - we'll go all out (tonnnnn - Will you be mine?)
Move to Bremerton - will you be mine? (yeah yeah mine)
Move to Bremerton - we'll hang out (move to Bremer-)
Move to Bremerton - we'll go all out (tonnnn - 'Til the end of time)
Move to Bremerton - 'till the end of time (will you be mine?)

[Chorus]
Move to Bremerton - we'll hang out (move to Bremer-)
Move to Bremerton - we'll go all out (tonnnnn - Will you be mine?)
Move to Bremerton - will you be mine? (yeah yeah mine)
Move to Bremerton - we'll hang out (move to Bremer-)
Move to Bremerton - we'll go all out (tonnnn - 'Til the end of time)
Move to Bremerton - 'till the end of time (will you be mine?)
