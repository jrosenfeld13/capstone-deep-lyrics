I've played me tunes around the world and now I'm home again
I danced with hedon maidens and got drunk with hairy men;
In far and distant countries I have rosined up me bow
And the door was always open while old Paddy let her go

Well, come and dance Paddy's reels, share a bottle with a friend
And it won't be long till we're too old for whiskey in the glen;
So, while the fiddle strings are new and the piper's reed in tune
Put the dresser out into the yard and dance around the room

Well, somewehere in the deepest heart of every mother's son
A touch of what was Ireland through the soul begins to run;
When the jigs and reels begin to flow they seem to weave a spell
They're as old as time and laughter and what stories they can tall

So, come and dance Paddy's reels, share a bottle with a friend
And it won't be long till we're too old for whiskey in the glen;
So, while the fiddle strings are new and the piper's reed in tune
Put the dresser out into the yard and dance around the room

Come out and dance at Paddy's reels for we might not meet again
But while you're so up beneath the roof we'll dance from now till then;
And heaven just might take us fore Saint Pete gets time to feel
That an angel choir could use a night of Paddy's jigs and reels

Come and dance Paddy's reels, share a bottle with a friend
And it won't be long till we're too old for whiskey in the glen;
So, while the fiddle strings are new and the piper's reed in tune
Put the dresser out into the yard and dance around the room

Come and dance Paddy's reels, share a bottle with a friend
And it won't be long till we're too old for whiskey in the glen;
So, while the fiddle strings are new and the piper's reed in tune
Put the dresser out into the yard and dance around the room

Come and dance Paddy's reels, share a bottle with a friend
And it won't be long till we're too old for whiskey in the glen;
So, while the fiddle strings are new and the piper's reed in tune
Put the dresser out into the yard and dance around the room
