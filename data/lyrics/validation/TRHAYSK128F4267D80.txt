You spend your days and nights alone
You think it easier that way
But that cold feeling in your bones
I said I could take away
I said, please be the one
Please be the one
Please be the one

Well, if your worlds a lonely place
It's something you never show
And love could stare you in the face
And baby, you'd never know
I said, please be the one
Please be the one
Please be the one

All the years, they took their toll on you
Your innocence has all disappeared
Tell me why you had to learn your love was
Something to fear

Well, someday the tables here will turn
And I won't want to play
And for my sweet kiss you will yearn
When it's too late to say
Please be the one
Please be the one

REPEAT CHORUS
