I've spent my life looking for you
Finding my way wasn't easy to do
But I knew there was you all the while
And it's been worth every mile

Lay down beside me and love me and hide me
Kiss all the hurting of this world away
Hold me so close that I'll feel your heartbeat
And don't ever wander away

Mornings and evenings all were the same
And there was no music 'til I heard your name
But I knew when I saw you smile
Now I can rest for a while
