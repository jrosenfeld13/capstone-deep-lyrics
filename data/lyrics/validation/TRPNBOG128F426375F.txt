Once I was an embryo
'til I got the old heave ho
Got let go

When I was a little runt
I pulled some cunning stunts
Stunning ones

They'd hit me
But I wouldn't cry
I'd just wink with my third eye
[? Murder minds ]

Now I'm a different kind of ape
The kind you assholes hate
[? Have some faith ]

I heard ol' Neil put 'er down
But we don't need him 'round anyhow
