Lonely boy, where do we go
I'm stuck believing in the other side
Stuck on my own
Run fast, you're dreaming

No place to hide
Safety in things I'm dumb for thinking
'Cuz a piece of plastic
Is nothing more than a piece of plastic

Empty streets under my feet
How did we get so far?
From the general beat
Across that great
Held fast together in the dying day
Oh you are swimming inside the magic hour
Oh and when you wet your skin
You can suck up all you need to know
You can suck up all you need to know, oh oh

Picture me, how will you picture me when I am dead?
All fast and free, building a fantasy with blocks in my head
A legacy, do these things dissipate in the years unread?
I've got a pain just like a knife, and the time has left me

Oh I'm just trying to do my best
I'm not afraid of life, I'm afraid of death
Build my love in the things I say
You've gotta lift your face to the breaking day

Oh I'm just trying to do my best
I'm not afraid of life, I'm afraid of death
Build my love in the things I say
You've gotta lift your face to the breaking day

So I ran and I jumped and I flew 'til I came to the center of the Earth so cold
And the wind picked me up and took me straight into the belly of the fears I hold
And I ran and I ran and I ran and I ran

And then I came right back
Threw my arms around you
You were dressed in black
I'm so glad I found you
For you burned my stuff
Objects all around me
Do we outlast things
Memories astound me
Do we fade like this
Keep your body down to the ground
The flesh and the soil that we love so much
I always wanted to return
Return to the body where I was born
I always wanted to return

And I ran and I ran and I ran

So far I'm just trying to do my best
I'm not afraid of life, I'm afraid of death
Build my love in the things I say
You've gotta lift your face to the breaking day

And I'm just trying to do my best
I'm not afraid of life, I'm afraid of death
Build my love in the things i say
You've gotta lift your face to the breaking day
Because in time it leaves you
It leaves you like blood, red blood
It leaves you like blood, red blood
It leaves you like blood, red blood
It leaves you like blood, red blood
