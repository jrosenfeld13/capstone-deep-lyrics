Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty
Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee
Holy, Holy, Holy, merciful and mighty
God in three persons, blessed Trinity
Holy, Holy, Holy, all the saints adore Thee
Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea
Cherubim and seraphim falling down before Thee
Which were and art and evermore shall be
Holy, Holy, Holy, though the darkness hide Thee
Though the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see
Only Thou art Holy, there is none beside Thee
Perfect in power, in love and purity
Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty
All Thy works shall praise Thy name in earth and sky and sea
Holy, Holy, Holy, merciful and mighty
God in three persons, blessed Trinity
