Sam's leaving on a midnight train
Holes in his shoes
Holes in his brain
Holes in his pocket where the money goes through
What an excuse to leave a one way ticket too

Sam's leaving town, Sam's leaving town
Sam's leaving town, Sam's leaving town
He lost control

He tried to live his own rock and roll
But after many years he lost his self control
Every band rehearsed a tune out into a big fight
Now be smart Sam, turn on your light

Sam's leaving town, Sam's leaving town
Sam's leaving town, Sam's leaving town
He lost control

He's got friends, can you call them friends?
He's got a home, can you call it a home?
No real love only one night stands
Is that what you call rock and roll?
Oh rock and roll!

Oh no

So now Sam's leaving on a midnight train
Druggy coke do they bring him again (! )
Boards the train to nowhere land
A final stop and stop at the end

Sam's leaving town, Sam's leaving town
Sam's leaving town, Sam's leaving town
Sam's leaving town, Sam's leaving town
Sam's leaving town, Sam's leaving town*
