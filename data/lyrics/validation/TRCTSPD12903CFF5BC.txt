I look into a sea of blue in your eyes
And see a full and swollen moon
Resplendent in a stormy sky
I look through your gaze, its source is pure and uncorrupted
And see a wilderness of dunes, untouched,uninterrupted
Pessimis protects me
Limp hope won't let me down
Still i lust for the pure
It unties the knots and turns me around
I swear,I won't unravel this time...
I banish "too good to be true" from my mind
I'm steeled in my resolve by this gem I never thought I'd find
The echoes of your laughter fall upon me,like the calming rain
They intimate a surreal world,smooth-surfaced and free of stain
Pessimis protects me
Limp hope won't let me down
Still i lust for the pure
It unties the knots and turns me around
I swear,I won't unravel this time...
Your gaze's source is uncorrupted...Pure
Dunes untouched,uninterrupted...Pure
I'm steeled in my resolve by this gem I never thought I'd find
Echoes of your laughter falling down on me
Like the calming rain...
Pessimis protects me
Limp hope won't let me down
Still i lust for the pure
It unties the knots and turns me around
I swear,I won't unravel this time...
