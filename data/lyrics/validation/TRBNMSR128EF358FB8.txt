Forever... is not long enough...
For everything... you have for... me...

Now this took me by surprise...
I can grasp the best part of my life
So I waited for the right way to state the stated
Just the other day... We would say forever

I lost myself... when i saw you...
I took your hand and placed it in mine...
To be with you... forever... here on after...

It wasn't hard for me to figure out...
Security without any doubts
So I waited for the right way to state the stated
Just the other day... we would say...

Forever... is not long enough...
For everything... you have for... me

Forever... is not long enough...
For everything... you have for... me
(Say forever)

I cannot take this in
I've been dead for far too long as it is
Take no regrets, instead embrace this
And we will take our, harmony

I lost myself... when i saw you...
I took your hand and placed it in mine...
To be with you... forever... here on after...
