[L. Hoffsten]
Demanding wishes in your eyes
But you don't own all that money buys
To pay for love is a poor mans comfort
Don't buy forbidden fruit
Don't buy forbidden fruit
Captured by a grinning wave
Wanting more than you ever gave
To degrade os your own degradation
And blush is the devils suit
Don't buy forbidden fruit
Beauty will blind you
Desire will damn
You're selling your soul
Under evils command
In the garden, there is no shame
As long as true love is the aim
To pay for love is a poor mans comfort
Don't buy forbidden fruit
Don't buy forbidden fruit
