What did I do?
To make you hurt me this way
To go along with your business
Day by fucking day
Every time that I see you
It turns the knife just a little bit more
The feeling I get is of such fucking regret

You fooled me once
It won't happen again
You drew the last straw
Our friendship's reached its end
Now it's clear to me
Finally I can see
You drew the last straw
You lied to me

Always thinking about yourself
You never gave me a chance
All your talk led me to believe
That you were my friend
But now I can see
You lied to me
Now I can see
