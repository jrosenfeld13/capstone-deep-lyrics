[Verse 1]
I knew it would be so simple
To never count the things you had
You traded all your memories to
Appreciate it all without your mind just feeling trapped
I hope it's not the last

[Chorus 1]
Don't take your chances
With circumstances
I know you're better than that

[Verse 2]
The thought of being so alone
Takes away from what you swore you could've known
I can't hear you speaking
I'm still not competing with you
Oh, how I hope you don't

[Chorus 2]
Take your chances
With circumstances
I know you're better than that
I thought you would take advantage
I know you're much better than that

So keep your mind from feeling trapped

I hope it's not the last
