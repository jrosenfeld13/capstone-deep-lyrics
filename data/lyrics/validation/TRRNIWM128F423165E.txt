Take your parachute and jump, you can't stay here forever
When everyone else is gone, being all alone won't seem that clever
Take your parachute and go, there's gonna have to be some danger
Take your parachute and jump, you're gonna have to take flight

If the winds don't catch you, I will, I will
If the wind's not there, I'm here

Don't look out before you, you know it's a long way down
I'll make it safer for you, your parachute won't let you down
Take your parachute and go, and maybe come back tomorrow
Take your parachute, I am, stop you ever getting sorrow

If the winds don't catch you, I will, I will
If the wind's not there, I'm here

Cause the winds might change, and the winds might blow over you
And the winds might cut you in two, unless perhaps you get a raincoat

Take your parachute and go, and wave to me as you are falling
Take your parachute and jump, you'll hear a sound, it's just me calling
It's a beautiful day for jumping, and nothing's here to keep you back
I'll make it safer for you, your parachute is on your back

If the winds don't catch you, I will, I will
If the wind's not there, I'm here

Cause the winds might change, and the winds might change

Take a parachute, I am

And jump (the wind should come and catch you)
And jump (before you hit the ground)
And jump (the wind should come and catch you)
And jump (before you hit the ground)
Jump
Jump
Take your parachute
Take your parachute
Take your parachute
Take your parachute
