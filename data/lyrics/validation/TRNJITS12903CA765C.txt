The warship had landed and night come ashore
The fighting was over for me ever more
For I had been wounded they left me forget
A stone for my pillow and snow for my bed
The enemy found me and took me away and made me a prisoner of war so they say
But God in his mercy was with me one day the gate was left open and I ran away
I returned to the old home my sweet wife to see
The home I had built for my darling and me
The door I then opened and there on the stand I saw a picture of her and the man
The clothes she was wearing told me the sad tale
My darling was wearing a new bridal veil
Then I found a letter and these words I read missing in action she thought I was dead

So I kissed her picture and whispered goodbye
My poor heart was breaking but my eyes were dry
I knew it was too late for her now to learn
I knew she must never know I had returned
A vagabond dreamer forever I'll roam
Because there was no one to welcome me home
The face of my darling no more I shall see for missing in action forever I'll be
