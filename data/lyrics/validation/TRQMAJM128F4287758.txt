Hallelujah, stop and stare
When will Jesus find us here?
Could we survive?

How can you pretend to know
Who you are or where you'll go
When you just get by?

Hmm, dream, dream all the time away
Hmm, dream, dream all your time away
Ooh

My father's mother sings this song
My mother's father's gone beyond
The clouds, the rain

Let him protect me from above
I can feel that tender love
When I'm in pain

Hmm, dream, dream all the time away
Hmm, dream, dream all your time away
Ooh
