He sits around and watches while you work
And laughs at your business and gives you a smirk
He thinks he's got it all figured out
He'll even give you pointers on what lifes about
Round and round he goes he'll be back
And nobody knows just who he'll attack
His evil intentions will prevail
He'll call you up at 6 a.m. - it's time to post his bail

He's last on the production line
Getting' high - feelin' fine
Outta sight - outta mind
Runnin' for the border line
Can't get to work on time
Loved ones are left behind

Show me some assuring signs
Every good boy does fine

He'll take you for everything you're worth
And send it to his family of never ending birth
You took him in just to save a buck
He'll screw your wife and kill your kids
Then what - you're fucked
America's a slammer - slam it shut
Safe haven for your convicts - psychos and sluts
As leniency starts to take its toll
10,000 more pass the border patrol
