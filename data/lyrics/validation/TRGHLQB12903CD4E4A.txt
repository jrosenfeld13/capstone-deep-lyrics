I give my love to him, but I don't wanna let you go..
[Just take a little time, you're always gonna be mine, baby girl]
Promised him my heart, so why I love you so?
[Just take a little time, you're always gonna be mine, baby girl]
Da empress she so divine

As long as you'll be mine
Just give me a little sign
