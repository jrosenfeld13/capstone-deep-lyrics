I hear what you're telling me
But that don't make it so
Two timing, talking sweet
From the time your feet hit the floor
My heart is telling me it's time to let you go
Oh baby, let go

I've loved enough to know
A heartache when I see one coming
Been down this road before
I've loved enough to know

Every night out with the boys
You think I'm so naive
Well, I know exactly where you're going
Every time you leave
I see every little something up your sleeve
Oh baby, I can see

I've loved enough to know
A heartache when I see one coming
Been down this road before
I've loved enough to know

I've loved enough to know
A heartache when I see one coming
Been down this road before
I've loved enough to know

I've loved enough to know
A heartache when I see one coming
Been down this road before
I've loved enough to know
A heartache when I see one
And I see one coming
A heartache when I see one
And I see one coming

I see one, I see one coming
I see one, I see one coming
I see one, I see one coming
