Baby, we was makin' straight A's
But we were stuck in a dumb daze
Don't take much to memorize your lies
I feel like I've been hypnotized

And then, that magic man, he come to town
Woo-Wee! He come n spun my head around
He said "Recess is in session
Two and two make five."
And now, baby, oh, I'm alive
Ah Yea! I am alive

And if you wanna be the teacher's pet
Well, baby, you just better forget it
Rock got no reason, rock got no rhyme
You better get me to school on time

Oh, you know I was on the Honor Roll
Got good grades, and got no soul
Raise my hand before I can speak my mind
I've been biting my tongue too many times

And then that magic man took to obey (uh huh)
Do what magic man do, not what magic man say
Now, can I please have the attention of the class
Today's ass-ignment... (hem hem)
KICK SOME ASS!

And if you wanna be the teacher's pet
Well, baby, you just better forget it
Rock got no reason, rock got no rhyme
You better get me to school on time

And if you wanna be the teacher's pet
Well, baby, you just better forget it
Rock got no reason, rock got no rhyme
You better get me to school on time

This is my final exam
Now ya'll know who I am
I might not be that perfect son
But ya'll be rockin' when I'm done
