[Verse 1]
The train that I got onto up and left that town
Threw it up as it went down
Strange enough, it left me rude and turned around
Watched as they all took their vows

[Chorus]
Fools were drawing, trying to save that day
I don't doubt that anyway

[Verse 2]
Phase it out until the older ones return
Have a seat and watch it burn
Trace around the corner, this is what I've learned
Always waited for my turn

[Chorus]
Fools were drawing, trying to save that day
I don't doubt that anyway

Fools were drawing, trying to save that day
I don't doubt that anyway
