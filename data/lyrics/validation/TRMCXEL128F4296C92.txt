Big city lights don't
Shine for me no more
You know somebody took my angel
And now shes gone for sure

Theres a street sign on
A lamppost where we used to hang
Its on the corner of love and trust
Down by the river bank
Somehow we lost our way on
The dark end of the street
Now we sit here every night
And listen to the band and
Can you hear them say?

Big city lights don't
Shine for me no more
You know somebody took my angel
And now shes gone for sure
She saved somebody that
Couldn't save them self
Big city lights don't shine
For me no more

If you ever come to our town
Don't go where angel plays
You know she'll take
You under her wing
Then she'll just fly away
Just like she broke the heart of
Every boy from love and trust
Now we sit here every night
Listen to the band
And can you here us say?
Listen to us say!

Big city lights don't
Shine for me no more
You know somebody took my angel
And now shes gone for sure
She saved somebody that
Couldn't save them self
Big City lights don't
Shine for me no more
No, No!

-Solo-

Big city lights don't
Shine for me no more
You know somebody took my angel
And now shes gone for sure
Yeah, she saved somebody that
Couldn't save them self
Big City lights don't
Shine for me no more

Big city lights...
Big city lights...
