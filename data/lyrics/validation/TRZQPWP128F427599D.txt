You been gone, you been gone
Clouds make rain and days make years
You been gone, gone, gone

The fair-haired boy is bald as a peach
And the reprobate's got a sermon to preach
Yeah
Your Sweet Lorraine is on SSI
Her mind walked of before she said goodbye
Yeah

You been gone, you been gone
Clouds make rain and days make years
You been gone, you been gone
I think you'll find some changes here
You been gone, you been gone
Clouds make rain and days make years
You been gone, gone, gone

The village square is a ten acre mall
And the hometeam plays out of San Cristobal
Yeah
The tender mercies have all been spent
Every last straight arrow is bent
Yeah

You been gone, you been gone
Clouds make rain and days make years
You been gone, you been gone
I think you'll find some changes here
You been gone, you been gone
Clouds make rain and days make years
You been gone, gone, gone

The Dairy Queen where it all went down
Is a halfway house called Homeward Bound
Yeah
Every little breeze fans a flame
And a long-lost voice calls out your name
Yeah

You been gone, you been gone
Clouds make rain and days make years
You been gone, you been gone
I think you'll find some changes here
You been gone, you been gone
Clouds make rain and days make years
You been gone, gone, gone
