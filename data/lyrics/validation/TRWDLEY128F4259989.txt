We were meant to be together
Forever and a day
The feelings we had
The moments we shared
Will never fade away
Don't you know I'm living with memories
And I know I won't forget
All the tears you seen me crying
I know I won't regret

Chorus:
Now and forever baby
I give my heart and my soul
Just to be with you
Now and forever darling
I give you all and I know
When I give you my heart and my soul
I just won't let you go
Now and forever

I could see when you were blinded
And how you lost your way
The magic is here
I won't she'd a tear
Cause now you're here to stay
Just for you I'm singing this melody
And the words will never change
If you see I'm never turning
The sunshine into rain

Chorus

I never wanted to be without you
You say you'll stay with me
But your sweet love that won't end you know
I need you

Chorus
