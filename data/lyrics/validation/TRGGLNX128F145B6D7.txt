Take or leave us
Only please believe us
We ain't ever gonna be respectable

It's our occupation, we're a dancing nation
We keep the pressure on every night
Explanations are complications
We don't need to know the where or why

Taking chances, bold advances
Don't care if you think we're out of line
Conversation is interrogation
Get out of here, we just don't have the time

Take or leave us
Only please believe us
We ain't ever gonna be respectable

Like us
Hate us
But you'll never change us
We ain't ever gonna be respectable

Hesitation is just frustration
Give us the music and we're all right
On each occasion, for your information
We can look after ourselves all right

Take or leave us
Only please believe us
We ain't ever gonna be respectable

Like us
Hate us
But you'll never change us
We ain't ever gonna be respectable

Fascination is our sensation
We like to put ourselves on the line
Recreation is our destination
So don't wait up for us tonight

Take or leave us
Only please believe us

Take or leave us
Only please believe us
