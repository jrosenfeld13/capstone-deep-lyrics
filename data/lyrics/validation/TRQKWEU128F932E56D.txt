One year later I saw her
Wearing a face in a strange disguise
Carried a smile they taught her
Gives it away at the edge of her eyes

Didn't I see the sunshine through the rainfall
She's crying and she knows it
She's crying and she shows it on the outside now
Whatever happened to the girl that was
Did she go inside because it's cold out here

Sooner or later she told me
I am in love again, truly this time
Nothing at home left to hold me
The city's just great and the world treats me fine

Didn't she think I heard that old refrain before
She's lying and she knows it
She's lying and she shows it on the outside now
Whatever happened to the girl that was
Did she go inside because it's cold out here

Didn't she think I'd seen someone in pain before
She's crying and she knows it
She's crying and she shows it on the outside now
Whatever happened to the girl that was
Did she go inside because it's cold out here
