Live it and breathe it
You know that I do
When you're all alone I think of you
Love it and leave it
And know when you're done
Watch out for this girl
She's got a gun for a tongue

Turn, turn, turn away
I don't hear what you say
You always love me just because
What do you want? What do you want?
Everything... everything

By keeping a secret to hold on to trust
It's gonna bruise, it's gonna crush
Believe it, it's over
In the blink of a lie
You found another
It's time to put your arrows aside

Watch out for this girl
She's got a gun for a tongue

Turn, turn, turn away
I don't want to hear what you say
You always loved me, just because
What do you want? What do you want?
Everything
Everything

It's gonna take time to know her
It's gonna take time to know her
You're gonna need eyes to keep it
You're gonna need fire to find it
When she moves to another town
Who's gonna be there to take the time?

Watch out for this girl...

Love it and leave it
And know when you're done
Watch out for this girl
She's got a gun for a tongue

Watch out for this girl
She's got a gun for a tongue
