I don't want the world to change
It has to always be this way
I don't know where love has gone
I must have always been alone
Here's to the life
Here's to our former life
Twist of the knife
Here's to our former life
Let go
Be with the living now
Every time our thoughts were revealed
Our bodies barely held us in
I don't want the world to change
It has to always be this way
Here's to the life
Here's to our former life
Twist of the knife
Here's to our former life
And I doubt
And I keep holding on
And you said
You said I must be strong
Let go
Be with the living now
All that I cannot explain
Has to be shut away
I don't want the world to change
It has to always be this way
