Coming out of nowhere
Heading for today
Try to change my destiny
For whatever comes my way

Strive for new horizons
Never settle down
State of satisfaction
Nowhere to be found

Bringer of light
Guidance from the sun
Out of the night
Got me on the run
Bringer of light
I am gone

Visions of tomorrows
I never will enjoy
The time is now to rebuild
What others have destroyed

The future lies behind me
Nothing came out right
Fractions of remembrance
Drawn in Frosty White

Bringer of light...

So you know just what to do
Still you feel youre gonna lose
Makes your blood run cold
