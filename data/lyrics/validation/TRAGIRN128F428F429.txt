Bite marks
All over your back
And when you walk home
You feel them throbbing
Oh bite marks
Will they stay?
Bite marks
On christmas morning
White marks
Where cigarettes burned me
I walk until my feet hurt
I walk till I walk no more
Bite marks
Trying to fill a hole in
My head my body
White marks
Holding fire to my fingers
So it burns
