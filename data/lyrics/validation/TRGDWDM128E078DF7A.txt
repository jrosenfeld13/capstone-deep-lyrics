I wish I knew, I wish I knew
What makes me, me, and what makes you, you
It's just another point of view, ooo
A state of mind I'm going through, yes
So what I see is never true, ahhh

I wish I could tell, I wish I could tell
What makes a heaven what makes a hell
And do I get to ring my bell, ooo
Or land up in some dusty cell, no
While others reach the big hotel, yeah

I wish I had, I wish I had
The secret of good, and the secret of bad
Why does this question drive me mad? ahhh
'Cause I was taught when but a lad, yes
That bad was good and good was bad, ahhh

I wish I knew the mystery of
That thing called hate, and that thing called love
What makes the in-between so rough? ahhh
Why is it always push and shove? ahhh
I guess I just don't know enough, yes
