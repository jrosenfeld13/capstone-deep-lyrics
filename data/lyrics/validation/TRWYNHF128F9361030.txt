You've gotta leave this town*
Lonely is only got you down
Leave this town!
You know that it`s only got you down
Take a look around
You` re dying in this town
When you` re out on the street
You cross your dreams beneath your feet
Walking on the street!
Now you cross your dreams beneath your feet
Murder all about, there must be must be some way out
Lord there must be so way out
[Guitar Solo:]
On a dirty street
You ask the people that you meet
On a dirty street
You ask everybody that you meet
(You've ) got to understand you`re dying in this town
This dirty town
