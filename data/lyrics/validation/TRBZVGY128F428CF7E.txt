[Intro]
We'll be together in the spring time

[Verse 1]
She goes away today
He gives her a photo to help her remember
History of Art BA
It's alright cos she's back in late November

But he knows not of who she is mixing
By Christmas, she's lying
No calling, she tricks him

So he goes up to stay
He don't like her friends and he hasn't heard of Nietzsche
She seems so far away
And the distance is further each time he meets her

Who's the bloke on the wall
Next to Ringo and Paul?
"It's Che", she says, "have you seen him before?"

[Chorus]
Open your window
Won't you let her out?
Wave goodbye to the butterfly
The one you can't be without

Open your window
Won't you set her free?
Where you are isn't where she's at
Or the place she's meant to be

[Verse 2]
He thinks they've grown apart
Now she uses big words like 'surreal' and 'genre'
I know it breaks his heart
There's thousands of fellas that like it before you

Does the bloke on the wall
Next to Ringo and Paul
Mean she's some kind of expert on guerrilla war?

[Chorus]

[Outro]
We'll be together in the spring time
You and I
And the sun will shine
