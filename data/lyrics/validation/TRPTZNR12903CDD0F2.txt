GET TO THE POINT OF NO RETURN
SPENT ALL THE MONEY THAT YOU NEVER EARNED
YOU'RE GOING TO BURN
YOU'RE GOING TO BURN OUT

TAKE A SHOT WHEN ITS NOT YOUR TURN
YOU MAKE MISTAKES BUT YOU NEVER LEARN
YOU'RE GOING TO BURN
YOU'RE GOING TO BURN OUT

WHEN I FIRST WROTE THE LYRICS TO THIS SONG
WELL I WAS ANGRY BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU DID ME WRONG
BUT NOW I REALISE IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT
YOUR COMMON SENSE CAME TO A HALT
IT'S IN YOUR FACE, THAT BLANK EXPRESSION
YOU'VE GOT A BAD CASE OF MANIC DEPRESSION
BUT PRETTY SOON YOU'L BE ALRIGHT
THAT TORCH OF YOURS WILL BURN BRIGHT

YOUR MOTHER'S CRYING
YOU'VE LOST YOUR MIND

THERE IS NO DENYING
THAT YOU'LL BE FINE
YOUR MOTHER'S CRYING
