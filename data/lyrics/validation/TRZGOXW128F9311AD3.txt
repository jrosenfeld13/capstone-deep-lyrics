See it in your eyes
Feel it in my head
Feeding me your pain
Falling out again

Small strong blow
Small strong blow

See it in your eyes
Feel it in my head
Feeding me your pain
Falling out again

Small strong blow
Small strong blow

Down the same old road before
Leading us to angry shores
Insecurities await
Confused hurting us again

Let's fight and talk
That's it... fight and talk
Let's fight and talk
That's it... fight and talk

You start to shout
You give it, bring it out
We scream and pout
Reacting, feeling doubt
We're testing vain
What's it all about?
It takes the blame
While we shout it out
Let's start again
And try to talk it out
Let's fight and talk
Let's start something else

Meeting on the way
Excuse this reach in time
Got sunshine on my mind
Can finally hear your face in my mind
Seen it there before
If you only knew my mind
Excuse me perfectly
My world will reach in time
