Oh, look at you now
Now that you've found out
The child you're raising is not your own
Tell me, tell me how does it feel
Now that she's revealed
Oh, your pride and joy is not your little boy

Tell me are you man enough?
Are you strong enough?
Can you take the strain?
Can you bear the pain?
I wanna know, are you man enough?
Are you strong enough?
Can you take the strain?
Can you bear the pain?

(Didn't I)
Now didn't I tell you that love can cause regret
(Didn't I)
And didn't I tell you that your match can be met
They hurt your pride, yeah, and you ache inside
Turned out that you have been taken for a ride

Look at you now (look at you)
Now that she has gone (ooh, ooh)
You got to raise him all alone (look at you)
Although he's not your own
You must give him (ooh, ooh)
All your love and a happy home

Tell me are you man enough?
Are you strong enough?
Can you take the strain? Can you bear the pain?
All I wanna know is are you man enough?
Are you strong enough?
Can you take the strain? Can you bear the pain?

You're trapped between a shattered ego
And the child that loves you so
Ohh, you're caught in a bad situation
Causing complications

(Didn't I)
Now didn't I tell you love can cause regret
(Didn't I)
And didn't I tell you your match can be met
Although you're grieving, don't think of leaving
You got to try to make the most of it

Look at you now (look at you)
Now that you've found out (ooh, ooh)
The child you're raising is not your own (look at you)
Tell me, tell me how does it feel
Now that she's revealed (ooh, ooh)
Oh, your pride and joy is not your little boy

[Repeat x2]
Are you man enough? Are you strong enough?
Can you stay composed? Can you keep control?
Are you man enough? Are you strong enough?
Can you take the strain? Can you bear the pain?
