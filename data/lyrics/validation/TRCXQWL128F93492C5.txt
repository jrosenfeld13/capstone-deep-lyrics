So many Gods but no love for the people
My mama told me that we're all made equal
What we fighting for?
Why are we still at war? ah
Where's the love? Where's the love? yeah
So many prayers yeah but where's the prayer for peace?
My papa told me that we all must serve and feed
What we fighting for?
Why are we still at war? ah
Where's the love? Where's the love?
Yeah
I got a confession, yeah
My heart is stressing for a blessing
Yeah, a blessing
And so the scene is set
Dropping bombs on each other because it's what God said
How did we let it get to this?
All this fighting makes me sick
The candle has burnt out the wick
And I quit, yeah
So many gods but no love for the people
My mama told me that we're all made equal
What we fighting for?
Why are we still at war? ah
Where's the love? Where's the love? yeah

What we fighting for?
Why are we still at war? ah
Where's the love? Where's the love?
Yeah, all the Jackals howl the same
Truth is one but goes by many names
Well the wind is writing their own history, yeah
But turn their backs on, but turn their backs on
But turn their backs on reality, eh
So many gods but no love for the people
My mama told me that we're all made equal
What we fighting for?
Why are we still at war?
Where's the love? Where's the love?
So many prayers yeah but where's the prayer for peace?
My papa told me that we all must serve feed
What we fighting for?
Why are we still at war?
Where's the love? Where's the love?
Well oh darling, dry your eyes
The whole world hears your cries
Pay no attention to what they may say
Tell all the demons to just go away
How can we wage war?
How can we wage it when we're under the same sky?
We're under the same sky
So many gods but no love for the people
