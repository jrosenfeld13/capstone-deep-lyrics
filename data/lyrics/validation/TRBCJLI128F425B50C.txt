And I love her so
I wouldn't trade her for gold
I'm walking on moonbeams
I was born with a silver spoon

Hell I'm gonna be me
I'm gonna be free
I'm walking on moonbeams
And staring out to sea

And if a door be closed
Then a row of homes start building
And tear your curtains down
For sunlight is like gold

Hey you better be you
And do what you can do
When you're walking on moonbeams
And staring out to sea

'Cause if your skin was soil
How long do you think before they'd start digging?
And if your life was gold
How long do you think you'd stay living?

And I love her so
I wouldn't trade her for gold
