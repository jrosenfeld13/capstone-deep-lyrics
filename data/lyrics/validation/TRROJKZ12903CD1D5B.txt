Answer me, Lord above:
Just what sin have I been guilty of?
Tell me how I came to lose my love
Please answer me, oh, Lord

She was mine yesterday
An' I believed that love was here to stay
Won't you tell me where Ii've gone astray:
Please answer me, oh, Lord

If she's happier without me
Don't tell her I care
But if she still thinks about me
Please let her hear my prayer

Let her know I've been true
Send her back so we can start anew
In my sorrow, may I turn to you?
Please answer me, oh, Lord

If she's happier without me
Don't tell her I care
But if she still thinks about me
Please let her hear my prayer

Let her know I've been true
Send her back so we can start anew
In my sorrow, may I turn to you?
Please answer me, oh, Lord
