[Chorus:]
Sendin' all my love to you, baby
Sendin' all my love to you
Sendin' all my love to you, baby
Sendin' all my love to you

[Verse 1:]
I see you looking at her, baby
It's not hard to do
And even though she's been your baby
It's me for you

[Hook:]
She captures every eye all the time
I know when I catch yours
You'll be mine
I've got so much to say
Until you look my way

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
I never lose my concentration
The stronger I feel
Come on now
Give me some attention
And a love that's real

[Hook:]
She captures every eye all the time
If I could just catch yours
You'd be mine
I've got so much to say
Uh, would you look my way

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
I'll give a lot of love
It's true, boy
That's what it's about
That in my heart
I've got something special
You'll find out, baby

[Hook:]
She captures every eye all the time
If I could just catch yours
You'd be mine
I've got so much to say
Uh, would you look my way

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

Sendin' all my love
Sendin' all my love
Sendin' all my love
Sendin' all my love
