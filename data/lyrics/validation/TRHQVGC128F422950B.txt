[First Verse]
My mind cant erase the memories of you
The look in your eyes swore to me your words were true
You told me our love was meant to be
Then you walked away - why did you leave me

You made me feel so - warm inside
Never said a word of goodbye
I know that you told me - nothing last forever
I see that youre gone - but I dream were together

[Chorus]
When will you come back to me
Will I be waiting long
You told me that you cared for me
Is your heart that strong
Recurring dreams you promised me
Just cant be - let me hold you in my arms
From here to eternity

[Second Verse]
Tried to face another day without you
Pictures on the wall - I was so happy with you
I thought that you cared - by the words you said
I once believed - that our love would never end
But now I can see - through the days and time
Wishing for you - and you may never be mine
I count the nights - if it could ever be
Will you come back my love - just tell me

[Chorus]
When will you come back to me
Will I be waiting long
You told me that you cared for me
Is your heart that strong
Recurring dreams you promised me
Just cant be - let me hold you in my arms
From here to eternity

When will you come back to me
Will I be waiting long
You told me that you cared for me
Is your heart that strong
Recurring dreams you promised me
Just cant be - let me hold you in my arms
From here to eternity

[Third Verse]
Cant you see that Ill never find
A love like yours I need you to be mine
What could I do - to bring you back to me girl
Cant you see - yea - yea
I need to know - oh - oh - girl

Just tell me

[Chorus]
When will you come back to me
Will I be waiting long
You told me that you cared for me
Is your heart that strong
Recurring dreams you promised me
Just cant be - let me hold you in my arms
From here to eternity
