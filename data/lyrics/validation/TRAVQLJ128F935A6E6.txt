There's no time to check the stars out
I'm already on my way
If you're up to call me psycho
Or if you think I'm out to play
I use The Dagger
I'm a cold heart mother's son
Thinking I'm the only one
I'm a cold heart mother's son
Trying to find my way home
If you'd like to be the hammer
Well that seems to be okay
Now you met a real rambler
Who refuse to be the nail
I use The Dagger
I'm a cold heart mother's son
Trying to find my way home
I'm a cold heart mother's son
And I'm certainly the only one
