(Drummond - Puerta - Pack)

She got a heart of steel
She don't care how I feel
But nothin' warms the chill
When I'm livin' on my own

She keep my mind in worry
She left my vision blurry
Left me in a hurry
Now I'm livin' on my own

Baby, when you left me here
I was so alone and full of fear
Thought that I would be all right
But it's hard to last these lonely nights

Thought that I quit carin'
When we both stopped sharin'
The pain is hard to bear
When I'm livin' on my own

She came into my life
She kept all my dreams alive

Baby, when you left me here
I was so alone and full of fear
Thought that I would be all right
But it's hard to last these lonely nights

She got a heart of steel
She don't care how I feel
But nothin' warms the chill
When I'm livin' on my own

Livin' on my own
Livin' on my own
