These feet dont know this ground
And these knees dont know this weight, this weight
And the sun hits the tarmac making her horizon dance, dance
And it wobbles
And a lack of wind and the heat of noon
And my eyes will be quick
And my feet will be fast
And Ill be paying attention soon

These ears dont know this sound
And this skin doesnt know this light, this light
And the moths have all fallen away away from their moon
And my eyes will be quick
And my feet will be fast
And I'll be paying attention soon

These feet dont know this ground
And these knees dont know this weight, this weight
