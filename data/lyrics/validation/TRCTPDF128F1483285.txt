[Intro]
Oh, shit!  Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
(They ain't ready for this) Oh, shit! (Oh!)
It's me, Fergie
The Pen! Polow
(Fergie, Ferg, what's up baby?)

[Verse 1]
When I come to the club, step aside
Part the seas, don't be having me in the line
VIP, cause you know I gotta shine
I'm Fergie Ferg, and me love you long time
All my girls get down on the floor
Back to back, drop it down real low
I'm such a lady, but I'm dancing like a hoe
Cause you know I don't give a fuck, so here we go

[Chorus]
How come every time you come around
My London, London Bridge wanna go down, like
London, London, London
Wanna go down like
London, London, London
Be going down like
How come every time you come around
My London, London Bridge wanna go down, like
London, London, London
Wanna go down like
London, London, London
Be going down like

[Interlude]
Drinks start pouring and my speech start slurring
Everybody start looking real good

[Verse 2]
That Grey Goose got your girl feeling loose
Now I'm wishing that I didn't wear these shoes
(I hate heels)
It's like every time I get up on the dude
Paparazzi put my business in the news
And I'm like, get up out my face
Before I turn around and spray your ass with mace
My lips make you wanna have a taste
You got that...I got the bass

[Chorus]
How come every time you come around
My London, London Bridge wanna go down, like
London, London, London
Wanna go down like
London, London, London
Be going down like
How come every time you come around
My London, London Bridge wanna go down, like
London, London, London
Wanna go down like
London, London, London
Be going down like

[Bridge]
Aah, da, da, da, da, do, do, do, do
Me like a bullet type, you know they coming right
Fergie love 'em long time, my girls support 'em, right?
Aah, da, da, da, da, do, do, do, do
Me like a bullet type, you know they coming right
Fergie love 'em long time, my girls support 'em, right?

[Interlude 2 - Spoken]
Another A-T-L
Cali callabo
Fergie and Polow

[Verse 1]
When I come to the club, step aside
Part the seas, don't be having me in the line
VIP, cause you know I gotta shine
I'm Fergie Ferg, and me love you long time
All my girls get down on the floor
Back to back, drop it down real low
I'm such a lady, but I'm dancing like a hoe
Cause you know I don't give a fuck, so here we go

[Chorus]
How come every time you come around
My London, London Bridge wanna go down, like
London, London, London
Wanna go down like
London, London, London
Be going down like
How come every time you come around
My London, London Bridge wanna go down, like
London, London, London
Wanna go down like
London, London, London
Be going down like
