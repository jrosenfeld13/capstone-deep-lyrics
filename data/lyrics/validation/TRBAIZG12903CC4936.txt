Fight, fight, fight

Fighting the world every single day
Fighting the world for the right to play
Heavy metal in my brain
I'm fighting for metal cause it's here to stay

Fighting, fighting, fighting the world
I've been fighting the world
Fighting, fighting, fighting the world
I've been fighting
Fight for a living, fighting the world
Fight for a living, fighting the world
Fight for a living, fighting the world
Fight

Now people keep asking if we're going to change
I look them in the eye, tell them
No way
Stripes on a tiger don't wash away
Manowar's made of steel, not clay

Fighting, fighting, fighting the world
I've been fighting the world
Fighting, fighting, fighting the world
I've been fighting
Fight for a living, fighting the world
Fight for a living, fighting the world
Fight for a living, fighting the world
Fight

See my brothers standing by my side
Only got one thing on our mind
Radio playing this nationwide
Turn it up louder till we all get fried

Fighting, fighting, fighting the world
I've been fighting the world
Fighting, fighting, fighting the world
I've been fighting

Fight
Fighting the world
Fight
Fighting the world
Fight
Fighting the world
Fight
Fighting the world

Fight for a living, fighting the world
Fight for a living, fighting the world
Fight for a living, fighting the world
Fight for a living, fighting the world
Fight for a living, fighting the world
Fight for a living, fighting the world
Fight for a living, fighting the world
Fight for a living, fighting the world

Fight for a living, fighting the world
Fight for a living, fighting the world
