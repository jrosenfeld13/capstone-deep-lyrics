Yellow bird, up high in banana tree
Yellow bird, you sit all alone like me

Did your lady friend leave the nest again?
That is very sad, makes me feel so bad
You can fly away, in the sky away
You're more lucky than me

I also had a pretty girl, she's not with me today
They're all the same those pretty girls
Take tenderness, then they fly away
Yellow bird, yellow bird

Did your lady friend leave the nest again?
That is very sad, makes me feel so bad
You can fly away, in the sky away
You're more lucky than me

Wish that I were a yellow bird, I'd fly away with you
But I am not a yellow bird, so here I sit
Nothing I can do
Yellow bird, yellow bird
