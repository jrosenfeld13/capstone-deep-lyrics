Well we can try and hide our emotion
Stand there like a rock in a wall
But love can take a little old notion
And make a living wreck of us all

Everybodys equal in the eyes of love
Darling dont you kid yourself
You can come on tender you can come on tough
Come on and get in line with everbody else
Quit what you're thinking of
Ain't no one above it
Everybody's equal in the eyes of love

Some are 'bout as subtle as thunder
They just try to barrel on by
But love'll leave 'em weak and wonderin'
Ain't it funny how they turn up shy

Everybodys equal in the eyes of love
Darling dont you kid yourself
You can come on tender you can come on tough
Come on and get in line with everbody else
Quit what you're thinking of
Ain't no one above it
Everybody's equal in the eyes of love

Love can make nothing out of everything
Turn something into soemthing else
It'll trat a loser liek a doggone king
And treat a doggone king like everybody else

Everybodys equal in the eyes of love
Darling dont you kid yourself
You can come on tender you can come on tough
Come on and get in line with everbody else
Now don't kid yourself
No you're not above it
Quite what you're thinking of
Ain't no one above it
Everybody's equal in the eyes of love
