Come all of you cowboys all over this land
I'll teach you the law of the Ranger's Command:
To hold a six shooter, and never to run
As long as there's bullets in both of your guns

I met a fair maiden whose name I don't know;
I asked her to the roundup with me would she go;
She said she'd go with me to the cold roundup
And drink that hard liquor from the cold, bitter cup

We started for the canyon in the fall of the year
Expecting to get there with a herd of fat steer;
And the rustlers broke on us in the dead hours of night;
She 'rose from her warm bed, a battle to fight

She 'rose from her warm bed with a gun in each hand
Said: Come all of you cowboys and fight for your land
Come all of you cowboys and don't ever run
As long as there's bullets in both of your guns
