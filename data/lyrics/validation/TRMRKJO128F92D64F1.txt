When you roll like ice turning to water
It reminds me to take off my clothes again
But I don't shake and I don't freeze
And I am not gonna crawl for you

When you scream like a child boiling in water
I seem to remember that sometimes there's no end
Back when I was a poet I wrote about your spleen
I knew you were a glass, still I threw you into the air
But I don't cry and I don't smile
And I am not gonna crawl for you
Now
