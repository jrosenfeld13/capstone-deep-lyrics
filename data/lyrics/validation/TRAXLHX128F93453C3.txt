They used to put my lights out
On nights out but days spent in blazin
Won't help me to navigate
Ways through their mazes
I tried God but he's not
The man I thought he was
He leaves us his Jesus
But we can't be like he was, no
So I phoned friends who pretend
To have ears that they lend
But they tend to offend
With texts they don't send
I read books and got stuck
Concluding that the crooks
Had taken the best stuff
And left all the rest fucked
Where at when I need to chat
Who'll be there when
I'm feeling that?
I'm all lost in the tit for tat
Is it all a trap?
Cos I can't go back
They used to put my lights out
On nights out but waking then baking
Won't help me to navigate
Ways in the mazes
So I left home and I roamed
To places round the globe
But you know where I go
My problem's the same though
Where at when I need to chat
Who'll be there when
I'm feeling that?
I'm all lost in the tit for tat
Is it all a trap?
Cos I can't go back
Which geeze do I need to please?
Should I get down on my bended knees?
Just so I might feel at ease
You gotta help me please
There's no wood just trees
Where at when I need to chat
Who'll be there when
I'm feeling that?
I'm all lost in the tit for tat
Is it all a trap?
Cos I can't go back
Which geeze do I need to please?
Should I get down on my bended knees?
Just so I might feel at ease
You gotta help me please
There's no wood just trees
