Some people like to wait around
They always seem to take
Just what the future brings
Me, I've never been like that
Got myself what I want
But not everything

But what's a boy to do
Without it
What's a boy to do

(Chorus)
I want you
You want me
Let it be
Please be mine
The sun won't shine
If you won't say you're mine
I want you

I've been waiting round so long
Wishin', hopin', prayin' I'd catch your eye
You give lots of special love
But I get disappointed cause they never smile

But what's a boy to do without it
What's a boy to do

(Chorus)
Somebody needs
Somebody loves
Somebody treats me right

Some people like to wait around
Wastin' time and taking what the future brings
Me I know just what I want
I've always had a likin' for life's finer things
But what's a boy
To do about it
What's a boy to do
