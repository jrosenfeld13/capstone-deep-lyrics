Advanced breed performing surgery in my brain
Diminishing the barriers of my mind
I'm granted the eye
Three-dimensional sight expanded
Substance turns out to be illusion
Abstract persceptions

From past, present and future they come
Three time-factors that take place now
Not ahead, not behind, but in different dimensions
Travelling through multiverse, not universe
Observing us
Insects of their complex science

Observing us

Chosen to possess the function of my third-eye
Now I know why we never knew
Our tunnel-visioned eyes
Cannot grasp reality beyond fine senses
Focused on technical advance
No abstract perceptions

Higher developed breed activities my third-eye function
My third-eye function
Released, it makes me see

I am above humanity, beyond its ignorance
My patterns of thought are incomplete
Balance has been forgotten
Man needs guidance
The thrid-eye sets you free

Fragments of the surgery remembered
Excruciating memories
At the same time beholding so many different dimensions
Different aspects of time other ways of travelling
The multiverse
Alien intelligence observe us like insects

Higher developed breed activities my third-eye function
My third-eye function
Released, it makes me see
The third-eye function
