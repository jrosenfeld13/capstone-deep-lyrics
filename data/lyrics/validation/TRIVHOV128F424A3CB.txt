Chains of love have tied my heart to you
Chains of love have made me feel so blue
Well now I'm your prisoner, tell me what you gonna do

Are you gonna leave me, are you gonna make me cry?
Are you gonna love me, are you gonna make me cry?
These chains are blue, gonna haunt me until' the day I die

Well, if you're gonna leave me please won'tcha set me free?
Well, if you're gonna leave me please won'tcha set me free?
I can't stay with these chains, unless you're stay on here with me

Well it's three o'clock in the mornin', baby the moon is shinin' bright
Yeah it's three o'clock in the mornin', the moon is shinin' bright
I'll just sit and wonder, where can you be tonight?
