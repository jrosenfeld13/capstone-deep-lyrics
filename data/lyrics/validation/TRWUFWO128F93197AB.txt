Why?:
Edison, i've fixed my glasses like new!

Dose one:
Wishing coins well, off into the bad sleep well

Why?:
Reaching to quiet the man made of metal and brick

Dose one:
Sleeping in woman's clothes, naked walls filling my eyes

Why?:
Kneading the knotted, cramped muscles; the head of a nut

Dose one:
Holding my place in a necklace collection, whala!

Why?:
Scraping the hardened, dead mortar from under my nails

Dose one:
Weeding out sounding like movies, why i'd rather read

Why?:
Sparring the volunteer flower, the beautiful guest

Dose one:
Greetings, my god given name is adam in love

Why?:
Edison, i've fixed my glasses like new!

Dose one:
Wishing coins well, off into the bad sleep well

Dose one, why?:
De, sha, vu. cats, clipped, whiskers, x

Open empty

(backwards):
Physics of a bicycle, isn't it remarkable?
And turns our friends and family into cold hard cash
It was our idea first to put dead whales on the roadside
I am fresh dirt, grab your hoe and rake and shake the earth
I caught you looking like a barbed-wire fire escape
I've been an ex-president since the day i was born
What do you call a three-legged dog? lucky
Doesn't mean it's all valour and vagina
Just because i've got poet head and write all the time
You bring tears to my ever-dry eyes

Chorus:
The dead dog, on the shoulder of 71
Here's where the flies come in
This is where the flies come in

Why?:
The fat man's drenched hat crumpled in a shivering fist
He's lost the whole house from around him
Every single shingle shattered into atoms
Only he remains, standing circumcised on torn earth
Where his living room once was stripped to his skin
With a wet hate in his right hand

Dose one:
Umbrella inverted and undressed
Stuffed in the top of a trash can
"right as rain" spokes reach
Grabbing coats and poking pocket books
Its dress is torn to one last spoke
It pours a sliding sheet of rain over the side, over the side

Why?:
The cracked earth cow-skull dirt in a no-cloud blue sky capsule
Leaks out the ozone's bald spot along with your brand new closed curtains
A dozen frozen roses and cozmo, the thumbed cat

Dose one, why?:
2 women walk up to a penny
One says, "oh look a penny."
Then the other one says, "oh, it's a lucky one."
Then the one goes, "no it isn't."
And they both walk off
