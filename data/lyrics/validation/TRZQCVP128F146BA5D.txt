[Verse 1]
Candy says
I've come to hate my body
And all that it requires in this world
Candy says
I'd like to know completely
What others so discreetly talk about

[Chorus]
I'm going to watch the blue birds fly
Over my shoulder
I'm going to watch them pass me by
Maybe when I'm older
What do you think I'd see
If I could walk away from me

[Verse 2]
Candy says
I hate the quiet places
That cause the smallest taste of what will be
Candy says
I hate the big decisions
That cause endless revisions in my mind

[Chorus]
I'm going to watch the blue birds fly
Over my shoulder
I'm going to watch them pass me by
Maybe when I'm older
What do you think I'd see
If I could walk away from me
