Here I am once again pleading to the sky
Kneeling to the sands, shedding my regrets
Knowing you'll forget everything
Why didn't I go to such great lengths to
Try to please you instead I tried to please myself
In the end when your heart is broken
Is see the folly of trying to please myself
I have not yet arrived seeing anything
Quiet my desires till they die
Until they die or align with you will
Why didn't I got to such great lengths to
Try to please you instead I tried to please myself
In the end when your heart is broken
I see the folly of trying to please myself
Why didn't I got to such great lengths to
Try to please you instead I tried to please myself
In the end when your heart is broken
I see the folly of trying to please myself
Didn't I got to such great lengths to
Try to please you instead I tried to please myself
In the end when your heart is broken
I see the folly of trying to please myself
