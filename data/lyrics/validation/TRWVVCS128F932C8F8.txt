[Verse 1]
You can put it down to lack of patience
Put it down to lack of sleep
But it's in my head to stay in bed
Tucked under the sheets

[Pre-Chorus 1]
They said if I tried to get on, I'd get on
They said there were chances, but now my chance has gone

[Chorus]
And I know what you think
What you think about me
Thoughts like that sink home;
To you, we're not deep

Ba ba ba-ba ba-ba
Ba ba ba-ba ba-ba
Ba ba ba-ba ba-ba
Ba ba ba-ba ba-ba

[Verse 2]
Now it may be a sad reflection
On the way young people feel
But early Monday morning
Is losing its appeal

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I open my curtains at 7am
Just so you think I'm up with the rest of the men

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You'd do yourself a favour if you gave yourself a break
But that's one risk you'd never take
The evening's yours, the morning's mine
But don't knock me, I'm doing fine

You'd do yourself a favour if you gave yourself a rest
But just for now, you know what's best
Ah, ah!

[Chorus]
