Anyone who's ever tried
Knows the way that I feel tonight
And anyone who's ever been let down
Knows what I'm talking about

Did you think I didn't care
Did you think that I'd not be there
You fall to pieces and you don't get none
I had a reason I'd give you one

Anyone
Had to do what you have done
Understands what I'm saying
Time will tell
Time won't lie so listen well
And try not to forget

Anyone who's never right
Knows where to find me tonight
And anybody already done
Knows better than anyone

Anyone
Had to do what you have done
Understands what I'm saying
Time will tell
Time won't lie so listen well
And try not to forget

Anyone who's ever tried
Knows the way that I feel tonight
And anybody already done
Knows better than anyone
