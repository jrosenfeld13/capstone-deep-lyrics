He's warm in purple and soft anointed oils
He drifts in silence to some dark and secret place
Where he will forget your face
You pull him back again
And his beauty makes you cry
No back-street kissing booths
Or dragon brews
Have lifted him this high

And you got a smooth body and a greedy mouth
And you travel hopeful despite your doubts
That you are only and ugly
Lying naked on the floor
Love is not supposed to be so sore

I'm going to give you a trumpet you can blow
You'd better blow it loud and sweet that I might hear
I will not excuse your fear
And here's a stage that you can be yourself upon
No bitter critics, no dead roses, no steeping down alone

And it's my belief that one more kick in the teeth
Is not what you need right now
And I am not an ogre and I am not like your father
I will always be around you when you need me

You're far too grateful for any love that you get shown
When will you stand up on your own?
