Deeper and deeper and deeper
I keep falling to your ocean's floor
To rescue all the reasons
Though they drift away
Whenever I call

Guess this makes me feel
Like I've been so wrong
How could I believe
That I'd be singing this song

I know that things are what they tend to be
As time brings out that all seeing eye
Now I've lived and I've learned
To hate what you loved
You had me touch the sky

I've touched the sky because of you

Though the sun melts my wings
I've touched the sky because of you
It's changed my view of things
I've touched the sky because of you

Though the sun melts my wings
I've touched the sky because of you
It's changed my view of things
I've touched the sky because of you

Though the sun melts my wings
I've touched the sky because of you
It's changed my view of things
I've touched the sky because of you

Though the sun melts my wings
I've touched the sky because of you
It's changed my view of things

I've touched the sky - sky - sky - sky
I've touched the sky
I've touched the sky - sky - sky - sky
I've touched the sky

I fell deeper and deeper
Through that open well that is your name
Losing count of all the drownings
Do you even understand the pain

You know this makes me feel
Like I've been so wrong
How could I believe
That I'd be singing this song

I know that things are what they tend to be
As time brings out that all seeing eye
Now I've lived and I've learned
To hate what you loved
You had me touch the sky

I've touched the sky because of you

Though the sun melts my wings
I've touched the sky because of you
It's changed my view of things
I've touched the sky because of you

Though the sun melts my wings
I've touched the sky because of you
It's changed my view of things
I've touched the sky because of you

Though the sun melts my wings
I've touched the sky because of you
It's changed my view of things
I've touched the sky because of you

Though the sun melts my wings
I've touched the sky because of you
It's changed my view of things
