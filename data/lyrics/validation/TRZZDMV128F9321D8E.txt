Don't think about it just do it
I'm your daddy, son

Get the patriot founded for a father
Initiator the full bearer your predecessor
The architect and now Arthur I sponge you son
And fold your hand daddy ought to clear your mind
Used to stick your chest out son cause I was your father
Gave you pride about your south side cause I was your father
Use to listen to the tape pop and roll your quarter
Let me slow down and state some fact
I put coal in my mouth they used to call me jars
I'm in the 84 legs with the jaws
Dodging family (?) 100 Gs
Who you thinking big brothers baby wanna be

But I've been inspired in it
Set the standards for griming intellectual niggas
Sothern realist they flow so deliberate
Boy killing me and out the new under the sun
Sit back listen I tell you how the south was won
With big guns, deep pockets and hard heads
Every go prison threads
Never scared raised the bar why you so detailed
Goodie Mob, Illuminati?
What the hell?
If anything why you pout your ass up on k
Get the food for your soul and nourished your brain
I remember no one is falling on December as I (?)
As I notice a simple apparel
Of different characters in the matrix they were learning
I'm your papi I'm the reason you were rapping
I got no time for napping you still have (?)
You asking me what happened
The music ain't the same
Open up your brains and we go back to the pains
The facts still remain be careful with the chain
Then we got you through the pain and
And we made it out the rain
We're artist, we're teachers
We're leaders, we're soldiers
Country faded, completely killing my son
I f I can catch the wrath they're stealing my son
To me got my own life I am willing my son
Yeah I remember stalling the I saw them stealing my gun
Before I started building my son I was stealing for crime
Can't tell the difference on how I was feeling
The four walls, the floor and the ceiling
And right outside the front door the kids were killing for fun
And he had a room with a view
And a couple of times he saw his daddy go outside and have some fun too
But let's be clear I'm not your peer in this gear
I am hard, I'm smart, I'm spotted
I am your father
