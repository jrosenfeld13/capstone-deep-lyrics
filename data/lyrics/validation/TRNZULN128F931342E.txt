And its a long way from Florida to the radio
All dressed up with no place to go
'Til somebody calls your name
Another Monday dragging trash behind a restaurant
Punishment for knowing what you want
And not wanting any more
Sundown sundown
Send something out to the kids in radioland
Dead men dont mind when smoke gets in their eyes
He thought he saw everything
Laid out like tomorrows clothes
From Florida to the radio
