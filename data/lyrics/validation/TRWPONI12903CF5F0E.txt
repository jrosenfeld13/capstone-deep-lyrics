Soulless and resurrected
Hiding where hate resides
I've died in as many ways
As you can say die

Infertile Tries
Still I compromise to meet your master's will
Tarnished veins, eternal pain
Now innocence is fading, is fading...

Into my infernal dreams of passion
That I appease with deeds of sin
You got your wings from the angels divine
I stole mine from flies that died

Needle lies
Holds our demise
Seems every day has lost its thrill
I damn the voices inside my head
Now sanity is fading

Death lurks where life is cheap
I won't betray what rules my mind
Shithead!
I'm convinced my life returns in time
Shithead!

My roots beneath your skin
In your guilt I nest
Face the truth that lies ahead
Alive or dead

Infertile cries
Still I compromise to meet your master's will
A feedle life is a life undone
All that's life is finally dying

Death lurks where life expire
I can't betray what rules my mind
Shithead!
Still convinced my life returns in time
Shithead!

Life's but a dress rehearsal for hell

I'm convinced my life returns in time
Shithead!

Infertile cries
Still I compromise
To meet your master's will
Tarnished veins, eternal pain
Now innocence is fading, is fading

Death lurks where life is cheap
I must betray what rules my mind
Shithead!
Now I know my life will return in time
Shithead!
