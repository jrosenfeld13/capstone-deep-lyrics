Did you see the stylish kids in the riot
Shovelled up like muck
Set the late night on fire
Wombles bleed, truncheons and shields
You know I cherish you my love

But there's a rumour spread nasty diseases around town
Caught round the houses with your trousers down
A headrush, in the bush
You know I cherish you my love
I cherish you my love

Tell me what can you want when you've got it all
The whole scene is obscene
Time will strip it away
A year and a day
And Bill Bones
Bill Bones knows what I mean

He knows it's eating, it's chewing me up
It's not right for young lungs to be coughing up blood
And it's all
It's all in my hands
And its all up the walls

Now the stale chips are up and the hopes stakes are down
Its the ignorant faces that bring this town down
How I sighed and sunken with pride
Yeah I passed myself down on my knees
Yeah I passed myself down on my knees

Tell me what can you want when you've got it all
The whole scene is obscene
Time will strip it away
A year and a day
And Bill Bones
Bill Bones knows what I mean

He knows there's fewer more distressing sights than that
Of an Englishman in a baseball cap
Yeah we'll die in the class we were born
That's a class of all our own
A class of all our own

Aah..

Did you see the stylish kids in the riot
Shovelled up like muck
They set the night on fire
Wombles bleed truncheons and shields
You know I cherish you my love
I cherish you my love
