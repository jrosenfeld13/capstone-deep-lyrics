All these feeble signs of joy as you portray them
Is a sad and lonely sight
I don't think your coctail-lives are that joyous
Look me in the eye and say that you'll last the night

Get the car-keys
Get the children
Get the gun
Get the car-keys
Get the children
Get the gun

Now, did Junior seem a bit weird at dinner?
Don't you find you just can't tell?
Id like to ask which one do you know the better?
The kids you put to life or the stupid digits that you sell?

Get the car-keys
Get the children
Get the gun
Get the car-keys
Get the children
Get the gun

Get the car-keys
Get the children
Get the gun
Get the car-keys
Get the children
Get the gun

Mind your parents
Mind your teacher
Mind your boss
And mind your job
Mind your parents
Mind your teacher
Mind your boss
And mind your job
