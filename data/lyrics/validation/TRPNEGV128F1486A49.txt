Well, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa men have named you
You're so like a lady with a mystic smile
Is it only 'cause you're lonely they have named you
For that Mona Lisa strain that's in your smile

Well, is your smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art

Well, in a villa, in the little old Italian town
Lives a girl who's beauty changed the rogue
And he yearned to love her but their hopes all tumbled down
What does she want, I guess nobody knows

Well, is your smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart
Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art

Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art...
