You gotta live where it feels right
Right in the full sense it's all about sight
Well, sight of your city, sight of your friends
Friends complement the city to a nice blend
Yeah!

You gotta live where it feels right
Right in the full sense it's all about sight
Sight of your city, sight of your friends
Friends complement the city to a nice blend
Yeah!

Down around here we go and keep things nice
We sweep out those who take interest in a fight
Down around here the music plays an uppity beat
Then a trumpet plays, a saxophone plays, it's nice
Basement windows boom out the sounds
Of beats where our women love to be spun around
Round here people got their art on check
Well have you be a poet, painter or just give respect
Keep listening

Down around here we read what bukowski wrote
Down around here we think ska music's dope
We crowd the stereo, we pass the smoke slow
We pull our women closer for our love for them to show

Society we've analyzed
Humanity we've theorized
Philosophy we've memorized

There's no way no way
I'm doing anything the way the city feels today
There's no way no way
I'm doing anything the way the city feels today

It's getting hot its getting hot outside
Bust out the fan baby everything feels nice
It's getting hot its getting hot outside
Bust out the fan baby everything feels nice

You gotta live where it feels right
Right in the full sense it's all about sight
Well, sight of your city, sight of your friends
Friends complement the city to a nice blend
Yeah!

Down around here positive minds meet
Plotting dreams into plans that manifest into beats
Well here you got a problem speak it coolly and calmly
Cause we're supporting those with evolved mentalities
Boston here fluent in stroll
The people's confidence is full in control

You'll find me at 42 longitude 71 latitude
Only European-style city in the U.S. man
It's arguable

Jamaica plain, mission hill, my worn out sneaks
Just hanging out on rooftops un-caged and free

Down round here one mic is a studio
Visions and talents glow, minds and music grow

Labeling we've downsized, music we re-stylize
Self expression's never compromised

There's no way no way
I'm doing anything the way the city feels today
There's no way no way
I'm doing anything the way the city feels today

It's getting hot its getting hot outside
Bust out the fan baby everything feels nice
It's getting hot its getting hot outside
Bust out the fan baby everything feels nice

Yeah, everything feels nice
Yes, everything feels nice

It's getting hot its getting hot outside
Bust out the fan baby everything feels nice
It's getting hot its getting hot outside
Bust out the fan baby everything feels nice
It's getting hot its getting hot outside
Bust out the fan baby everything feels nice
It's getting hot its getting hot outside
Bust out the fan baby everything feels nice
