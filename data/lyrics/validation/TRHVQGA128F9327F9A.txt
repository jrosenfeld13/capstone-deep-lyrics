Don't let it fool you. You are in enemy country. Be alert. Suspicious of everyone. Take no chances. They have had no free speech. Had no free press. They were brought up on straight propaganda. They have been trained to hate and destroy. Don't argue with them

(No, don't you argue with me...)

It's not safe to go out, it's not right to stay home
He said my advice is to carry a gun
No, no, no, better watch - better watch your step, boy
It's not right to leave everyone wondering how
He said if you're gonna drop it, then drop it now
No, no, no, better watch - better watch your step, boy

CHORUS:
Who cares what goes?
Who cares what you know?
Who cares what you do without?
Who cares what's so?
(2x)

What goes
What you know
What you do without
What's so

SAMPLES:
Don't argue with them
Don't try to change their point of view. (3x)
You will not be friendly. (2x)
You will be aloof. (3x)
Watchful. Suspicious. Watchful... and suspicious

(CHORUS)
But you're trying to drive with no hands on the wheel...
No, no, no, better watch - better watch your step, boy
(2x)
If you're gonna drop it, then drop it now

Will something please click into place
And make something of all this waste
'Cause you're trying to drive with no hands on the wheel
(To) Find your own way, and how it feels
It's not safe to go out, it's not right to stay home
Listen, my advice is to carry a gun
No, no, no, better watch - better watch your step, boy
No, no, no, better watch - better watch your step, boy

(CHORUS)
SAMPLES:
Don't clasp that hand (3x.)
It's not the kind of a hand you can clasp in friendship

(CHORUS)
