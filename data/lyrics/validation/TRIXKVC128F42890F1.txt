She's got a rat-tail hanging down
Her bangs clipped off at the ceiling
She told me i'm a rebel now
Like a freewheelin' Bob Dylan

Everything's so physical
And i'm just looking to smash
The she yanks her stockings down
And i know i'm never coming back

Because you don't know
You don't know for sure
You know it's easy
To kick down the door
Ya you don't know
Don't know for sure
I said it easy to kick down the door
We'll put it all together
This baby's a burn

Oh, she's on fire now

I'm too deep in heaven now
Me feet are posed for the feeling (it's too late for regret)
I heard the news; the story's out (yeah)
Well, i just came for the healing

Everything's so physical
I got a surface to scratch
She looks at me then she looks around (yeah, what'd she tell you next?)
She said it's fun but she only comes in cash

Because you don't know
You don't know for sure
Yeah, it's easy
To kick down the door
Oh you don't know
Don't know for sure
Oh it's easy to kick down the door
We'll put it all together
This baby's a burn

We'll put it all together
We'll start a fire tonight
