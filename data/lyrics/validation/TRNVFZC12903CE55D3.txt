If you are wond'rin' what I'm gonna do
While you are sleepin', am I sleepin' too?
Well, I'm just sittin' here lovin' you
Close my eyes and lovin' you
I'm just sittin' back, sittin' here lovin' you

I have been wond'rin' just what I would do
If I'd weren't sleepin', had I not found you
I'd be outside findin' you
Walkin' on the avenues findin' you
But I'm just sittin' back, sittin' here lovin' you

Now the reasons never see me runnin' 'round
Fingers on my forehead to calm me down
She can even get me up and on my feet

And when I die to take care of some business on the street

I have been walkin' all my streets along
I would keep walkin' to keep from goin' home
I couldn't quite till I could see you
Now I can't see me ever leavin' you
'Cause I'm just sittin' back lovin' you
Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you

If you are wond'rin' what I'm gonna do
While you are sleepin', am I sleepin' too?
Well, I'm just sittin' here lovin' you
Close my eyes and lovin' you
'Cause I'm just sittin' here lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you
