[Verse 1]
It's true, yes it's true
I'm as guilty of this sin as you
I lived through it too
As you can see
It didn't hurt me
You must admit you helped a bit

[Pre-Chorus]
(It takes two to tango) No I wasn't alone
(It takes two to tango) I remember it still
(It takes to tango) Drink a toast if you will

[Chorus 1]
This is for the girls who just couldn't see
That my only sin was being me
And this ones for the girls and they know who they are
Its so long ago and I dont know

[Verse 2]
Now I dont recall
All the details of the scene at all
But I had a ball
And learned all the games
Forgot all the names
You must admit you learned a bit

[Pre-Chorus]
(It takes two to tango) No I wasn't alone
(It takes two to tango) I remember it still
(It takes to tango) Drink a toast if you will

[Chorus 2]
This is for the girls who couldnt understand
What its like to try to be a man
And this ones for the girls and they know who they are
Its so long ago and I dont know

[Bridge]
I dont know, I don't even know at all
Who was right and who was wrong
I just dont remember all
All the things that were said
What went on in my head
But its easy to see that I used you and you used me

[Outro]
This is for the girls who think Ive done wrong
Could you really hold a grudge that long?
And this ones for the girls and they know who they are
Its so long ago and I dont know who you are
