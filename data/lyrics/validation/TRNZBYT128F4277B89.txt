Seasons change, they rearrange
So why can't you and I--say why
Thoughts we find, are so unkind
We often have to cry--but why

Chorus:
Celebrate, change your thoughts to love
Celebrate, what you're thinking of
Time ain't long, soon we'll be moving on
Moving on...

Nature's way for her to say in perfect harmony
Find your place, your past erased
For life's new destiny

Chorus:
Celebrate, change your thoughts to love
Celebrate, what you're thinking of
Time ain't long, soon we'll be moving on
Moving on...
