Verse (M1):
Im hot a temperature a 100 degrees
I sweat when I sneeze but am 'bout to freeze
I can't even breathe am shaking and shivering
A deadly disease attacking my liver my kidneys my spleen my lungs and my heart
I can't even take it I'm falling apart
The doctors can't even tell me what I got
But where does it hurt and when did it start?

It started with Carmen we're from the same hood Carmen Santina Angelica Woods
Her papa's a baker her mom is a teacher
We met skipping school met in a double feature
Eating popcorn at the back of the theater
And shared our first kiss in my little 2 seater
We talked about life about love about war if it ain't about love what are we living for
Carmen Santina Angelica Woods id give you the sun and the moon if I could

Ch:
Love you love you baby u give me fever
Love you love you darling cause you give me fever
I don't need no need no doctor
I don't need need no money

Yoruba:
Aleyo.........................part missing

Cause give me give me fever
Give me give me fever
You give me give me fever
You give me give me fever

M1 verse2:
Carmen Santina Angelica Woods searched high and low for her all the through the hood
Talked to her family her mom and her pop
She ain't no good for your heart ugh ugh rip it apart
My hommies tell me be tough but I could not get enough
We made a connection you see not sexually but deeper than oceans and seas
See you can't be afraid to be cause she makes me feel like I am free
If she could be right beside me I'm good she is my medicine she is my cure
See you can't be afraid to be cause she makes me feel like I am free
Wish we could take it right back to the hood
