You wanted love, you wanted love
But it's not she was thinking of
You step to the left, you step to the left
On your dancing feet now
Dancing feet, I can't compete
Now with your dancing feet now
Somebody gonna try and get to know now
Somebody gonna try to say it's all right now
Say it's all right now
Dancing feet, I can't compete
Now with your dancing feet now
Some people stare, they can't compare
When you're not over here, you're there
You see Coco, she say, "oh no"
Another boy would like to know
Somebody gonna try and get to know now
Somebody gonna try to say it's alright now
That it's alright now
She's got the white feather
To get you through the night
She got the white feather
To make it feel alright
Dancing feet
Somebody gonna try and get to know now
Somebody gonna try to say it's alright now
That it's alright now
