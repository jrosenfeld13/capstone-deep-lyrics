At the breakin' of the dawn, day is born again
Just another missing link in an endless chain
Filling up the empty space left by one's who gone
Freedom's child is born today singing freedom's song

With his colors flying high and his gun in hand
Volunteered to fight and die in a foreign land
Just another minor chord in a worn out song
Freedom's child is marching there singing freedom's song

Drifting through a crowded park past an empty swing
Hidden in a sparrow's eye when it's on the wing
Planted on a lonely hill with his name unknown
Freedom's child was laid to rest singing freedom's song

At the breakin' of the dawn, day is born again
Just another missing link in an endless chain
Filling up the empty space left by one's who gone
Freedom's child is born today singing freedom's song
Freedom's child was laid to rest, singing freedom's song
