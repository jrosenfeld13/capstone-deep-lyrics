What's wrong? I feel like I don't know you
I don't even recognize the perfume that I bought you
What's wrong? I swear I didn't buy that
Suddenly my memory is failing to provide one more excuse
That I've frequently used to defend your every act of mishap

And there's a huge neon question mark flashing quite absurdly
It's been blocking all my view to the door with a sign that reads:

My mind is made up
There ain't no going back
Now my life is straight up
I will get my money back
Now my mind is made up
There ain't no going back
And my life is straight up
I will get my money back

Calm down
Don't tell me we're surrounded
No there's no police outside to keep me reprimanded
Hands up
You may as well surrender
I can't pretend I never knew of all your lush weekenders

That you thought I had ignored
Like that knocking at our door in the middle of one summer night

When a huge neon question mark was flashing quite absurdly
It was blocking all my view to the door with a sign that read:

My mind is made up
There ain't no going back
Now my life is straight up
I will get my money back
Now my mind is made up
There ain't no going back
And my life is straight up
I will get my money back

This is awry - this is a cover up
This is denial - another major fuck up, fuck up
This is awry - this is a cover up
This is denial - another major fuck up, fuck up
This is awry - this is a cover up
This is denial - another major fuck up, fuck up
This is awry - this is a cover up
This is denial - another major fuck up, fuck up

There's a huge, there's a huge, there's a huge, there's a huge neon question mark
There's a huge, there's a huge, there's a huge, there's a huge neon question mark

My mind is made up
There ain't no going back
Now my life is straight up
I will get my money back
Now my mind is made up
There ain't no going back
And my life is straight up
I will get my money back

My mind is made up
There ain't no going back
Now my life is straight up
I will get my money back
Now my mind is made up
There ain't no going back
And my life is straight up
I will get my money back

I will get my money back, oh
