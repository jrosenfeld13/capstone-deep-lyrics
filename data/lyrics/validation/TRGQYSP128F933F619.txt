Vers 1:

Oh I've prayed for so long, now
To keep these tears
Inside of me
Isn't there really another way out ?

Bridge:
If we could turn back time
It wouldn't be the same for sure
No chance to touch the ground, once again
We once knew how

Chorus:
Let her rest in the deepest silence of the night
Forever sleeping, feel her pain inside
Silence of the night

Vers 2:

Lord we're dying, but we don't know why
Reality - so cold -Abolishing Mother Earth so old
Explain to the curious eyes of a child
Why

Bridge 2:
If we could turn back time
It wouldn't be the same for sure
No chance to touch the ground, once again
We once knew how
Once again

Chorus:
Let her rest in the deepest silence of the night
Forever sleeping, feel her pain inside
Silence of the night

(Solo)

Chorus:
Let her rest in the deepest silence of the night
Forever sleeping, feel her pain inside
Once again
Let her rest in the deepest silence of the night
Forever sleeping, feel her pain inside
So let her rest in silence
Ohoooooo
So let her rest in silence
Forever
So let her rest in silence
Pain inside
So let her rest
Silence of the night
