[Verse 1]
Once again I'm falling to my knees
(I try to escape because i just can't take it)
Now this feeling is spreading like a disease
(I fake another day and the wheel keeps turning)
This place is so pathetic
Doesn't anybody get it
Is there anybody home?
Is there anybody home?
There's nothing left
We're just a shadow of what we used to be

[Chorus 1]
In the night there's a fire in my eyes
And this paradise has become a place we've come to cry
When i open your letter the words makes it better it takes it all away whoaoh it keeps me holding
On whoa it keeps me holding on

[Verse 2]
Here we are preteding we're ok
(you can say what you want but you still can't fool me)
The life we're living
It's all masquerade
(i try to smile but i can't remember how)
So how did we get so jaded
Is it so complicated
To not give up to me?

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Whenever I need you
Whenever I run to
I know where to find you
It keeps me holding on
Whenever I need you
Whenever I run to
I know where to find you
On
You keep me holding on
You keep me holding on whoaoh

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
