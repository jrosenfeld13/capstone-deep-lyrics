Think about the youth
Never knowing what's instore never knowing what they're gonna see
Alway's needing proof
Innocence is hard to keep, trust is just a faded memory

What do you need to see?
Think about you all the time wondering if you're doing fine
I hope that I can keep ahold of you just one more day
I don't know what I would do without....

What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
Everytime you go I can't help but hate you so

I don't know what you expected from me all those nights
I just wanted us to be happy
I guess it's my fault to
The hatred has grown way to much love is just a faded memory

Why do you got to be angry at me all the time?
Everything was going fine
One day you will see, you'll regret the things you said
I know I regret the day we met

What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
Everytime you go I can't help but hate you so

Take just what you want from me

What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
Everytime you go I can't help but hate you so
