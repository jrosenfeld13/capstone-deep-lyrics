[Verse 1]
Look at me
You may think you see
Who I really am
But you'll never know me
Every day
It's as if I play a part
Now I see
If I wear a mask
I can fool the world
But I cannot fool my heart

[Chorus]
Who is that girl I see
Staring straight back at me?
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?

[Verse 2]
I am now
In a world where I
Have to hide my heart
And what I believe in
But somehow
I will show the world
What's inside my heart
And be loved for who I am

[Chorus]
Who is that girl I see
Staring straight back at me?
Why is my reflection someone I don't know?
Must I pretend that I'm someone else
For all time
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?

[Bridge]
There's a heart that must be free to fly
That burns with a need to know the reason why

[Outro]
Why must we all conceal
What we think, how we feel?
Must there be a secret me
I'm forced to hide?
I won't pretend that I'm
Someone else for all time
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?

[Outro]
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?
