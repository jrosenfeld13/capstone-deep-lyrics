Waking up next to you is like a dream come true
I watch you while you dress
The way you look at me
My chest is totally pounding in distress
Waking up next to me I hope you'll always be
I hate when I'm away
All the other girls that talk to me just sound so lame
In the back of my car we let it go for a little far
And the look on your face made me feel so out of place
When you said you're ok and then you tried to drive away
Let me know you and I are going to live
Like we might die tomorrow
Waking up next to me I hope you'll always be
I have when I'm away
All the other girls that talk to me just sound so lame
In the back of my car we let it go a little far
And that look on your face made me feel so out of place
When you said you're ok and then you tried to drive away
Let me know you and I are going to live
Like we might die tomorrow
