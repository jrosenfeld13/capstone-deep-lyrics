[Verse 1]
You and me, we have an opportunity
And we could make it something really cool
But you, you think I'm not that kind of girl
I'm here to tell ya' baby, I know how to rock your world

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't think that I'm not strong
I'm the one to take you on
Don't underestimate me boy
I'll make you sorry you were born
You don't know me
The way you really should
You're sure misunderstood

[Chorus]
Don't call me baby
You've got some nerve and baby, that'll never do
You know I don't belong to you
It's time you knew I'm not your baby
I belong to me, so don't call me baby

[Verse 2]
Behind my smile is my IQ
I must admit this does not sit with the likes of you
You're really sweet
Mmmm.. you're really nice
But didn't mama ever tell ya' not to play with fire

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't think that I'm not strong
I'm the one to take you on
Don't underestimate me boy
I'll make you sorry you were born
You don't know me
The way you really should
You're sure misunderstood

[Chorus]
Don't call me baby
You've got some nerve and baby, that'll never do
You know I don't belong to you
It's time you knew I'm not your baby
I belong to me, so don't call me baby

[Bridge]
You and me, we have an opportunity
And we could make it something really cool
But you, you think I'm not that kind of girl
I'm here to tell ya' baby, I know how to rock your world

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't think that I'm not strong
I'm the one to take you on
Don't underestimate me boy
I'll make you sorry you were born
You don't know me
The way you really should
You're sure misunderstood

[Chorus]
Don't call me baby
You've got some nerve and baby, that'll never do
You know I don't belong to you
It's time you knew I'm not your baby
I belong to me, so don't call me baby
You've got some nerve and baby, that'll never do
You know I don't belong to you
It's time you knew I'm not your baby
I belong to me, so don't call me baby
