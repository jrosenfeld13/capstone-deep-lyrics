Have you ever felt too hot to go to bed
Touched yourself instead and watch your body talk
Just let your body talk
Have you ever felt just too hungry for love
The more you get you find that it's just not enough
But you really can't give it up

All you people out there put your hands up in the air
Are you feeling you know what, or do you really care

If it feels like love
Then give it, baby that's a rush
If it feels like pain, pain, pain, pain
It's really just the same
If the mood is rude
Then you got the right attitude
And you better get down, you don't have to get undressed
Just because it feels like sex

Have you ever had a mind too dirty to read
Kinky freaks why don't you get down on your knees
I'm getting hard to please
Have you ever whipped love and left it to cry
Ask yourself the question
Does the cherry pie leave you satisfied

All you people out there put your hands up in the air
Have we got the right to funk, or do we really care

If it feels like love
Then give it, baby that's a rush
If it feels like pain, pain, pain, pain
It's really just the same
If the mood is rude
Then you got the right attitude
And you better get down, you don't have to get undressed
Just because it feels like sex

Turn out the light
So I can feel what you're thinking
Do you think we'd get it passed the watershed
Let's take it slow
Cos you know
I know you know
Sex is in your head

Baby I want you to know you're not the only one
I'm on my way to sexual healing, do you wanna come

If it feels like love
(Feels like love)
Then give it, baby that's a rush
(That's a rush)
If it feels like pain, pain, pain, pain
(Mmm)
It's really just the same
(It's really just the same)
If the mood is rude
(If the mood is)
Then you got the right attitude
(If the mood is rude)
And you better get down, you don't have to get undressed
Just because it feels like sex
(Just because it feels like sex)

If it feels like love
(Gottta feel like love)
Then give it, baby that's a rush
If it feels like pain, pain, pain, pain
(Gottta feel like love)
It's really just the same
If the mood is rude
Then you got the right attitude
And you better get down, you don't have to get undressed
Just because it feels like sex
