When i'm up in the middle of the night
Trying to figure out who's wrong and who's right
Shake my brain against my heart to find
This is not at all what i had in mind

Yeah yeah yeah cause i am not alone
And i must remember that i am not alone

So when the sun circles round to catch my eye
And i am hiding here behind these last minute lies
You can see all the truth the night has brought
Well you can see that this is
Not at all what i wanted it to be yeah
Yeah yeah
Well i am not alone
And i, i must remember, that i am not alone

Twenty eight teeth to bite through this fear
This fear of ever seeing anything clear
(something i'm not sure) cuz i am not alone
Yeah, cuz i am not alone

So you want to destroy this part of me?
This part that tricks you into thinking that i am free
Well you do not know the first thing about me
You do not know, how to reach me

Yeah yeah yeah cuz i am not alone
Oh you know that i must remember
That i am not alone
Yeah i am not alone
Yeah
