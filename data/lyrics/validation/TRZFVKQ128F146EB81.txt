I pin myself against the walls
Stationed like a horse in stall
Just wishing
They might call me art
There I hung in the hall
Collecting dust, that's all
It's all I needed to do

While in the corner, quite a size
He sits talking, whiskey-wise
Hopin' to throw me off
But no matter how he tries
I'll just look him in the eyes
It's all I need to do

*That's all it took to see
I was wastin' time
It's all it took to see
I was walkin' the line
I'm going to ride high as can be
I look behind
And see them followin' me

So my friends don't delay
Unless of course
You'd rather stay
Lemming heads for the cliff
Found them up
They're going astray
Take the lead take the way
That's all that we need to do

*Repeat
I'm going to ride high as can be
I look behind
And see them followin' me
