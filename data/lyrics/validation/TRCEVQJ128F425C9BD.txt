The world is mine but for a time
Please hear the love I bring for you to follow
Come with me, with diamonds in the sea
And stare the hearts of men whose fight in sorrow
It's foolish to suppose you know me well, I know
Everything that I touch won't turn to gold
Money's not my way although your own lost soul's
Waiting for the day to break that hole

And I love you
I've never loved someone like I do
I love you
The world is yours if you want me to
I love you
I've never loved someone like I do

Whisper please some scandal to the trees
I'm sure they would enjoy themselves enormously
Will you and I sit up in the sky
And chase our minds through space and time relentlessly?
Circumstances indicate for you and I
If the time is right, we bid a fond farewell
Some friends of mine, the world they take on for a while
Then seldom find the time they know so well

And I love you
I've never loved someone like I do
I love you
The world is yours if you love me too
I love you
I've never loved someone like I do
