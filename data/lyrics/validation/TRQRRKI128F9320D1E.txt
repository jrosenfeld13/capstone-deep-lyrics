We should be happy just the way we are
We got a brand new house
With a circle drive and a fancy car
But furs and diamonds and a Cadillac
Don't mean a thing when you're sleeping back to back

You look at your wall
I stare at mine
But we never really seem to say
What's on our mind

We don't talk things over
We ignore the facts
That our love can't live
When it's sleeping back to back

When I fell in love with you
You didn't have a dime
But we spent our nights making love not marking time
And I'd trade this mansion for a run down shack
And a man who don't believe in sleeping back to back

You look at your wall
I stare at mine
But we never really seem to say
What's on our mind

We don't talk things over
We ignore the facts
That our love can't live
When it's sleeping back to back
