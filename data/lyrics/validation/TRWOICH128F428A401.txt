My old lover calls early in the morning
Looking for another place to hide
Her new friends are already boring
She is sitting on the pavement outside
She only comes to see me when she's has too much to drink
Only says she loves me when she's too drunk to think

Ain't it poetic, and ain't we grand?
I open the door with a drink in my hand
Good to see you again
Why can't we be friends?

I know she has some trouble being truthful
We keep the conversation light and easy
She smiles when I tell she looks beautiful
She smiles but I can tell she doesn't believe me
She is some kind of genius, everybody agrees
She looks towards the bed room and then looks back to me

Ain't it poetic, and ain't we grand?
I open the door with a drink in my hand
Tell me a story, go on sing me a song
Give me something to dream to, after you've gone
Baby, can't you see?
You are no good for me

Who knows what we'll be
When we wake from our dreams
When we wake from our dreams
We'll see
