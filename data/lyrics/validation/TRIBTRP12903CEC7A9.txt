There's a story that they tell of long ago
'Bout a Texan and a girl from Mexico
How they met and fell in love
So hopelessly
Though they knew their secret love could never be

Every night
He'd ride across the Rio Grande
Every night
He'd risk his life to hold her hand
For he knew her father swore to take the life
Of the cowboy who would make Marie his wife

It was never meant to be
Still they kissed so tenderly
And they vowed their love
Would never, ever die

As her held her, oh, so tight
The sound of gunfire filled the night
The lovers sighed and then
They kissed their last goodbye

If you ever ride across the Rio Grande
You will find two tombstones on the desert sand
And they tell the story of so long ago
'Bout a Texan and a girl from Mexico
