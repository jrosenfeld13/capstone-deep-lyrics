All right tonight's the night
Tonight I've made my mind up
It's time to get it right
Just like we did before
Tonight's the night all right
And though I know you ain't quite sure
You're getting all excited 'cause you don't know what's in store

So what you've got to do
Is keep our little secret
Do what I tell you to
And leave the rest to me
I'm guaranteeing you
When I get in this kind of mood
I've got a little something I can introduce to you

(A little boogie woogie) ah ha
(A little boogie woogie)
(A little boogie woogie) all right
'Cause when I'm inclined I usually find
A little boogie woogie in the back of my mind
'Cause when I'm inclined I know I can find
A little boogie woogie in the back of my mind

Hey today's the day I lay it on the line
The way to make you stay and keep me company
It's time to get my way 'cause night time is the right time
And when I'm feeling fine I like my action guaranteed

All right tonight's the night
I can't wait any longer
I'm turning out the light and locking up that door
You might put up a fight
But you'll be crying out for more
When you'll be getting what you really came here looking for

(A little boogie woogie) ah ha
(A little boogie woogie)
(A little boogie woogie) all right
'Cause when I'm inclined I usually find
A little boogie woogie in the back of my mind
'Cause when I'm inclined I know I can find
A little boogie woogie in the back of my mind

All right tonight's the night
I can't wait any longer
I'm turning out the light and locking up that door
You might put up a fight
But you'll be crying out for more
When you'll be getting what you really came here looking for

(A little boogie woogie) ah ha
(A little boogie woogie)
(A little boogie woogie) all right
'Cause when I'm inclined I usually find
A little boogie woogie in the back of my mind
'Cause when I'm inclined I know I can find
A little boogie woogie in the back of my mind

'Cause when I'm inclined I usually find
A little boogie woogie in the back of my mind
'Cause when I'm inclined I know I can find
A little boogie woogie in the back of my mind
A little boogie woogie, woogie boogie woogie
