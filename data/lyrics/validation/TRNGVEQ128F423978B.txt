Precognition, imminent catastrophe
There's no way we'll ever learn
Asepticize, stand apart or be set aside
Evolution takes a stranger turn

Burning through thick layers of scale
Infiltrating the intimite beings
Second to none, submit and enroll
Transparent the unseen chords of control

Fireproven - will I stand the test of pain?

Omniscient belief in the answer
Understanding, the key to all power
The last inch of virgin magic was raped
By our inertial reference frame
