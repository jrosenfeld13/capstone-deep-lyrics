When the sun comes up
I can see that you're not here
And the whole world stops
But the wind-up bird keeps winding up its string
And the days go by and you don't come back
But I know you will because there's something pulling both of us

Back and forth, up and down
All around, in and out of love
And I've been holding on
Holding on for so long that I can't let you go

Even when we're apart I can feel you next to me
There's a hidden love connecting us like voices on a string

At the bottom of the well, in the middle of the day
You're the passing sunlight
Stay with me, don't go away
I can hear your voice cutting through the wire
It's the silver spark connecting us and pulling me

Back and forth, up and down
All around, in and out of love
And I've been holding on
Holding on for so long that I can't let you go

Even when we're apart I can feel you next to me
There's a hidden love connecting us like voices on a string
Even when I'm alone I can tell you're with me
There's a hidden love connecting us
And I'm holding on by a string

Back and forth, up and down
In and out, all around
Back and forth, up and down
In and out, all around this love

Even when we're apart I can feel you next to me
There's a hidden love connecting us
I'm holding on, holding on by a string
