Feels good, everybody
Tender lover, tender love
Eleanor Rigby
Spends half her life all alone
No fault of her own
Made a decision
Love has no place in her home
Love it has a right to go
Love has no limit
If you believe in love it'll open up, so
Don't even give in
'Cause if it starts to give, just hold on
We didn't make it
But love'll get you by if you only try
Just don't give up on love
'Cause it didn't work out this time
Tender lover, girl, I'm so sorry
Well I never meant to hurt your
I never meant to break your heart
Tender love, so broken hearted
Well I never meant to break your
Break your tender heart
I don't ever give up
Inspite of our love
Love is much too precious
It's greater than both of us
And there's more than enough
I keep lookin' for love
Just be a believer
It'll give you what you want
Sky is the limit
If you believe in love it'll open up, so
Don't ever give in
'Cause if it starts to give, just hold on
We didn't make it
But love'll get you by if you only try
Just don't give up on love
'Cause it didn't work out this time
Tender lover, girl, I'm so sorry
Well I never meant to hurt your
I never meant to break your heart
Tender love, so broken hearted
Well I never meant to break your
Break your little tender heart
My tender lover
Tender lover, tender love
Tender lover, tender love
Love has no limit
If you believe in love it'll open up, so
Don't even give in
'Cause if it starts to give, just hold on
We didn't make it
But love'll get you by if you only try
Just don't give up on love
'Cause it didn't work out this time
Tender lover, girl, I'm so sorry
Well I never meant to hurt your
I never meant to break your heart
Tender love, so broken hearted
Well I never meant to break your
Break your little tender heart
Tender lover, tender love
Tender lover, tender love
