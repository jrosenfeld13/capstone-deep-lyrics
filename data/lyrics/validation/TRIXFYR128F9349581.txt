Oh, don't you remember
Sweet Betsy from Pike?
She crossed the wide mountains
With her lover Ike
And one yoke of oxen
And big yeller dog
A tall Shanghai rooster
And one spotted hog
Doodle-ang-fall, di-id-all
Do-lang-fall, did-ay
Doodle-ang-fall, di-id-all
Do-lang-fall, did-ay

Out on the prairie
One bright starry night
They broke out the whiskey
And Betsy got tight
She sang and she shouted
And danced o're the plain
Made a great show for
The whole wagon train
Doodle-ang-fall, di-id-all
Do-lang-fall, did-ay
Doodle-ang-fall, di-id-all
Do-lang-fall, did-ay

They soon reached the desert
Where Betsy give out
And down in the sand
She lay rolling about
Ike in great terror
Looked on in surprise
Saying, "Betsy get up
You'll get sand in your eyes"
Doodle-ang-fall, di-id-all
Do-lang-fall, did-ay
Doodle-ang-fall, di-id-all
Do-lang-fall, did-ay

The wagon tipped over
With a terrible crash
And out on the prairie
Rolled all sorts of trash
A few little baby clothes
Done up with care
They looked rather suspicious
Though it was all on the square
Doodle-ang-fall, di-id-all
Do-lang-fall, did-ay
Doodle-ang-fall, di-id-all
Do-lang-fall, did-ay

The Shanghai ran off
And the cattle all died
The last piece of bacon
That morning was fried
Poor Ike got discouraged
And Betsy got mad
The dog wagged his tail
And looked wonderfully sad
Doodle-ang-fall, di-id-all
Do-lang-fall, did-ay
Doodle-ang-fall, di-id-all
Do-lang-fall, did-ay

One morning they climbed
Up a very high hill
And with great wonder
Looked into old Placerville
Ike shouted and said
As he cast his eyes down
"Sweet Betsy, my love
Will you come to Hangtown?"
Doodle-ang-fall, di-id-all
Do-lang-fall, did-ay
Doodle-ang-fall, di-id-all
Do-lang-fall, did-ay

Long Ike and sweet Betsy
Attended a dance
Ike wore a pair of his
Pike County pants
Sweet Betsy was covered
With ribbons and rings
Said, "Ike, you're an angel
But where are your wings?"
Doodle-ang-fall, di-id-all
Do-lang-fall, did-ay
Doodle-ang-fall, di-id-all
Do-lang-fall, did-ay

Long Ike and sweet Betsy
Got married of course
But Ike, getting jealous
Obtained a divorce
And Betsy, well satisfied
Said, with a shout
"Goodbye, you big lummox
I'm glad you backed out"
Doodle-ang-fall, di-id-all
Do-lang-fall, did-ay
Doodle-ang-fall, di-id-all
Do-lang-fall, did-ay
