Father, father
Can you tell me
Where the hours go?
Where time flows?
Is it written in the stars
Upon the milky way
That we must burn bright
Before we fade away?

Mother, mother
Can you tell me
Where the fire goes
When the flames cease?
"From the ashes
To the astral plain
Where the setting sun
Meets the sea, Brendan"

I live by the river
Where the old gods still dream
Of inner communion
With the open sea
Through the eye of a hunter
In search of a prey
Neither beast nor human
In my philosophy

If you don't recognise me
Well, it's simply because
I've outgrown these old clothes
Time to move on
For you and I will outlive
The masks life gave us
When this shadowplay comes
To a close
