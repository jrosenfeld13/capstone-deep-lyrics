Out on the streets what ya lookin' for
That thing in your bed's just another whore
That tear in your eyes not a tear at all
For that girl that you touch you could never fall
That stream in your mind it's a tearin' sty

Let's pretend you're vicious
Let's pretend you're cool
Let's pretend suspicious
Let's pretend you're fools

Your leather is tight but you wear it full
'Gether is right but you gotta be cool
You cut your wrists but you don't feel the pain
You change your mind but you still feel the same
To dream ain't your kind just another lie...

Let's pretend you're vicious
Let's pretend you're cool
Let's pretend suspicious
Let's pretend you're fools

Sell us a story that we can believe
Spend your dollars on pills for relief
Love is a future that you still can't see
Standing answers to questions are free
Scream in your boredom life's just to die

Let's pretend you're vicious
Let's pretend you're cool
Let's pretend suspicious
Let's pretend you're fools

Dive in problems just like stealin' a fix
Is your life to live or is it for kicks
Kick dirt in the faces of angry dream men
Stand on your chairs and spell don't let me in
Don't stand in the light cuz you know you can't cry

Let's pretend you're vicious
Let's pretend you're cool
Let's pretend suspicious
Let's pretend you're fools
