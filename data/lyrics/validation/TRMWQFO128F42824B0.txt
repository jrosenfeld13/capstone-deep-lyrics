Somewhere in Texas by the yellow sand
Somewhere in Texas by the yellow sand
Somewhere in Texas I lost my man
Somewhere in Texas by the yellow sand

And how many times do I have to lose you
And how many times do I have to lose you
Before I realize
It's too late

A tornado I truly coming my way
A tornado is truly coming my way
It'll sweep the land
I think I'll stay
It'll sweep the land
I think I'll stay
Somewhere I lost my man
Somewhere in Texas by the yellow sand
