Who will be the first to lead the way
I will be the one
Who will stand in the gap
Who will watch and pray
I will be the one
Who will walk with his brother in unity
Who will live by faith and integrity
Who will say to the Lord, "Here am I send me"
I will be the one

Chorus:
I will be the one that God is looking for
I will never be ashamed
In the name of the Lord
I'll stand and proclaim
Yes, I will be the one
Yes, I will be the one
Like a city on a hill, who will shine the light
I will be the one
In a world of darkness who will hold it high
I will be the one
Who will pray for revival all over the land
Who will seek God's forgiveness for all our sin
Who will ask the Lord to touch with His mighty hand
I will be the one
Who will call our nation to holiness
I will be the one
Who will raise up a standard of righteousness
I will be the one
Who will trust in the Lord for the rest of their days
Who will honor the Lord in each and every way
Who will give God the glory and all the praise
I will be the one
