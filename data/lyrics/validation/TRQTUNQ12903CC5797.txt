Bang and here we go
Watch the road, and don't drive so slow
Takes so long and it's so hard
There's a million bums in my back yard
I get excited, I get so impatient
Takes so long to get back home
To do it up
To do or die

And we've only just begun
And I feel like having fun
But I swear I'll be all right
Until the next time

So that's how it starts and I left out the best
Parts
I sweat and talk too much
Don't shut up, don't shut down
Tell me a story, man I'll tell you twenty
Costs so much and goes so fast
Screws you up and drags you down

And we've only just begun
And I feel like having fun
And I swear I'll be all right
Until the next one
And I start off feeling swell
Pretty soon I'm done too well
But I swear I'll be all right
Until the next time

Costs too much and I talk too much
Takes so long, and it goes so fast
I can't think too straight, aauugh....

And we've only just begun
And I feel like having fun
And I swear I'll be all right
Until the next one
And I start off doing fine
Pretty soon I'm keeping time
But I swear I'll be all right
Until the next time
Until the next time
Until the next time
Until the next time
Until the next time
Until the next time
Until the next time
Until the next time
Until the next time
