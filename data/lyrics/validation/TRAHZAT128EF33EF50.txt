Say what you want
What you see is what you get
Shed your tears
But never do forget
When the chips are down
And the world is on your back
We'll stick through thick and thin
In spite of our sins

Here and now all is clear
You must face this mounting fear
All our dreams of the past
The sound and scent will always last
For we will always be those special friends
No one will ever, ever understand

No doubt this way is best
Have the cake and eat the rest
We grieve for the plain
We see too deep, too much pain
Poison creeps in every head
Crave for what they cannot have

Here and now all is clear
You must face this mounting fear
All our dreams of the past
The sound and scent will always last
For we will always be those special friends
No one will ever, ever understand

With hair so high, clothes so black
We are one, get off our back
We're killing time, storm and stress
Side by side, just like that

For we are those special friends
For we are those special friends
