I've been looking
For a girl like you
And I wish
You were looking for me too

But you don't want me around
No, you don't want me around
No, you don't want me around

We all long for
A love so true
And I would die for
One night with you

But you don't want me around
No, you don't want me around
No, you don't want me around
Don't want me around

But you don't want me around
No, you don't want me around
You don't want me around
I know that you don't want me around
I know that you don't want me around

No you don't want me around
You don't want me around
