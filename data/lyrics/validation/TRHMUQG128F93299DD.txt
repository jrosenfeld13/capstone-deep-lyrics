You've got me dancing and cryin
Rollin and flying
Love don't let me go
You've got me drowning in a river
Cold but in fever
Love don't let me go
(Don't let me go)

Don't let me go
(Love don't let me go)
Don't let me go
(Don't let me go)
Don't let me go
(You've got me drowning in a river
Cold but in fever)
Eh, eh
Eh, eh

You've got me dancing and cryin
Rollin and flying
Love don't let me go
You've got me drowning in a river
Cold but in fever
Love don't let me go

You've got me dancing and cryin
Rollin and flying
Love don't let me go
You've got me drowning in a river
Cold but in fever
Love don't let me go
(Don't let me go)

Don't let me go
(Love don't let me go)
Don't let me go
(Don't let me go)
Don't let me go
(You've got me drowning in a river
Cold but in fever)
Eh eh
Eh eh
Don't let me go

You've got me dancing and cryin
Rollin and flying
Love don't let me go
You've got me drowning in a river
Cold but in fever
Love don't let me go
(Don't let me go)

Don't let me go

Dancing and cryin(x3)

Dancing and cryin(x3)
