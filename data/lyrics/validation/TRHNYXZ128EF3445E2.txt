When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me
And if I know she is worried
Then I would feel that same misery

Baby we have so much together
We stand as one
And that's what makes it better
When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me

Now listen, just what, uh-huh, she means to me now
Oh you just wouldn't, you just wouldn't understand
People can say she's no good
But oh, she's my woman
And I know I'm her man
And if she's got a problem
Ooo-ooh I know, I know, I got to help her solve it

When something is wrong with my bab-ay (sho' nuff)
Something is wrong with me
Now, say it again
When something is wrong with my baby
Something is wrong with me
Oh hey, yeah
