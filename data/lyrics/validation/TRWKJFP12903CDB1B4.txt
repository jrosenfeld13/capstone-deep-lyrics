Raise me up
Don't let me fall
Cause I don't get myself
I feel like I felt before
But can't find my way

All those feelings went away
I may not be what you think I am
Think we ought to find ourselves
Think we ought to find ourselves
Again...

Raise me up
Don't let me fall
Cause it's getting so hard
I feel like I felt before
Maybe I only try?

All those feelings went away
I may not be what you think I am
Think we ought to find ourselves
Think we ought to find ourselves again
All those questions never asked
All those days are coming back to me now
Dreams that can't be realised
All those nights are coming back to me now
And I know there're coming back to you

Raise me up
Raise me up, don't let me fall
