Heart of stone -- I tried to reach you
Of the altar stone -- I tried to warn you
But you were not alone -- you wouldn't take the call
You wear brimstone -- I tried to warm you

Always the same desire
After the tone -- they try to storm you
You are a voice alone and who dares to question
Forgotten at home - how do you live with
Do you wear brimstone -- give me the call

Always the sign is fire
I'm being drawn by the heat
Always the same desire. Hot

Through the telephone -- I tried to reach you
But if you're not alone -- I know your life is torn
I see your lover's tomb -- why don't you mention
To me whenever I call -- I'll try to warm you

Always the sign is fire
I'm being drawn by the heat
Always the same desire

You're not alone
Always the sign is fire
Heart of stone
Always the sign is fire . . . (repeat)
