There is a stranger in town
He's given sight to the blind
He is a great emancipator
He turns water to wine
He even healed the ten
Who were bound by disease
What manner of man is this whose voice can control the seas
Some say He is great I Am that prophets spoke of
Some even say He's Emanuel, the Son of God
This stanger...strander...stranger from Galilee (Hey!)
The man from Galilee
(Do you know the man, do you know the man do ya, do you know the man, do you know the man do ya, do you know the man, do you know the man do ya...do you know the man...
Do you know Him
Do you know the man
Do you...do you know the man...
Do you know him
Do you know, do you know, do you know the man?
What a man
Who's the man
He's the man
Jesus the man
Do you know, do you know
Do you know the man?
