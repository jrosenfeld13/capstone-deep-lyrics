Oh, send me off to war
With a gun in my hand
But I won't pull the trigger
Our destiny is here
'Neath the red, white and blue
So lead me to the slaughter

Now don't be afraid
Come and join the parade
For the ultimate in sacrifice
It's an old-fashioned story
Of hope and of glory
A ticket for taking a life

(Chorus)
I, I don't want to be a hero
I don't want to die for you
I don't want to be a hero

Oh send me off to war
In a far away land
I never knew existed
Subject me to the truth
To the horror and pain
Until my mind is twisted

And what if I fail
Will you put me in jail
For a murder I will not commit?
'Cos you don't understand
Till there's blood on your hands
That it's time to forget and forgive

(Chorus)
And those who return
Come back only to learn
That they're hated by those who they love
'Cos you're not satisfied
Till a thousand have died
And your anger is paid for in blood

(Chorus)
