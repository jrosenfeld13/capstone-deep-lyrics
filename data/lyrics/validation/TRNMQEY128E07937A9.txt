[Verse 1]
Don't you don't you want to thrill me
Don't you be afraid to tell me
Tell me if you think it's ugly
But now don't you want to touch it anyway
I've been looking for a reject
And you ain't had nothing like me yet
Don't you think it's time for motion
I can take what you've been pushing

[Chorus]
Hey I know what to do
I'm going to fuck fuck fuck fuck you!
Fuck You!
Yea I know what to do
I'm going to fuck fuck fuck fuck you!
Fuck You!
I'm going to

[Verse 2]
I'm the beast and you're the master
You're the meat of the matter
I'm no fool for discretion
When it's on the tip of my tongue
Don't you don't you want to thrill me
Don't you be afraid to tell me
Tell me if you think it's ugly
But now don't you want to touch it anyway

[Chorus]
Hey I know what to do
I'm going to fuck fuck fuck fuck you!
Fuck You!
Yea I know what to do
I'm going to fuck fuck fuck fuck you!
Fuck you!
I'm gonna
Gonna
F-f-f-f-fuck you!
(yeah!)

[Outro]
Yea I know what to do
(know what to do!)
Yea I know what to do
I'm going to fuck fuck fuck fuck you!
Yea I know what to do
I'm going to fuck fuck fuck fuck you!
Gonna
Gonna
Gonna!
Fuck you!
