There's nothing to complain about
You are so useless when you're high
There's a big gap in your front teeth
You only look good when you're high

Whatever those girls at school did say
Don't believe them
They're just jealous of your awkward ways
Brush right past them in the hall

Already settled it and this time I'll handle it AND
Bring them out back to me and I'll use the whipping tree

Is that the new style at school
I like to see you keeping up
I swear it gets better now
They'll never see you getting by

Whatever those girls at school did say
Don't believe them
They're just jealous of your awkward ways
Stab them right between the heart
You look so much better now

Already settled it and this time I'll handle it AND
Bring them out back to me and I'll use the whipping tree
