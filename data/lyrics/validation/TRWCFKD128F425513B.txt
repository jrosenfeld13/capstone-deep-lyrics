I'm on a Mexican holiday
Down Ensenada Way
South of the Rio Grande
With Feliz Navidad throughout the land
I found that shaker of salt
And I know it was my own damn fault
'Cos I partied all day long
How was I to know it would go all wrong?
Ay carumba - I had one too many Cervezas
Hey gringo - Federales are coming, so I better go
Forget the Alamo - John Wayne's dead and I'm out of pesos
Ay carumba - I better go find my amigos
And bring mucho dinero
So away I tried to run
"Alto gringo, you drunken bum"
But you know I run too slow
They caught me in Tijuana, Mexico
Said, what have I done wrong?
"Hey senor, yea, the list is long
You done this and what have ya
We don't need no stinking badges"
Ay carumba - I had one too many Cervezas
Hey gringo - Federales are coming, so I better go
Forget the Alamo - John Wayne's dead and I'm out of pesos
Ay carumba - I better go find my amigos
And bring mucho dinero
So there I was, just sitting minding my own business
Enjoying a cool drink, trying to lay low
All of a sudden these cops come up and grab me
Hey, what ya doing? Get your stinking hands off me
Whaddaya doing?
Ay carumba - I had one too many Cervezas
Hey gringo - Federales are coming, so I better go
Forget the Alamo - John Wayne's dead and I'm out of pesos
Ay carumba - I better go find my amigos
Ay carumba - I had one too many Cervezas
Hey gringo - Federales are coming, so I better go
Forget the Alamo - John Wayne's dead and I'm out of pesos
Ay carumba
