[Verse 1]
Don't wanna take it slow
I wanna take you home
And watch the world explode
From underneath your glow

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna watch the way
You creep across my skull

[Chorus]
You slowly enter
Because you know my room
And then crawl your knees off
Before you shake my tomb

[Verse 2]
I wanna watch you close
I need to see for sure
And then the tape is on
Who do you think we can show?

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna watch the way
You creep across my skull

[Chorus]
You slowly enter
'Cause you know my room
And then you crawl your knees off
And then you shake my tomb

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna watch the way
You creep across my skull

[Chorus]
You slowly enter
'Cause you know my room
And then you crawl your knees off
Before you shake my tomb

[Chorus]
You enter slowly
You know my room
You crawl your knees off
And then you shake my tomb
