Cold empty bed, springs hard as lead
Feel like Old Ned, wish I was dead
All my life through, Ive been so black and blue

Even the mouse ran from my house
They laugh at you, and scorn you too
What did I do to be so black and blue?

I'm white - inside - but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is in my face

How would it end? Ain't got a friend
My only sin is in my skin
What did I do to be so black and blue?
