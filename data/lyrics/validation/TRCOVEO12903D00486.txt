The killing is a mean rots in the pain
Fight for the fear of rights
The time is set scream for the help (horror)
Fly through the darkest nights
The peeling is the skin rotting the soul
Hailing for the chosen son
Mortality the pain fear for the living
Ravage the chosen one
The darkness falls beyond the grave
Blessed ground in which they save
Even though the time has passed
(Your soul is fucked in utter...)
Rotting souls in fear of desperately
Serpent souls in bowels on which to feed
...is out for blood and parts
...craves the blood we're feasting on
Help Me I'm in pain
