Well good evening to all my friends
I think it goes to show that the more you get, the more you got
The more you want some more
Cause it's supersexy, supercool, the way they walk the avenue
But it's a sadder day than yesterday so it kinda makes 'em superblue
Spastic Sam and Eric Drew make supermarkets superflue
But they're just on time for the rendez-vous
I know it goes to show that the more you get, the more you got
The more you want some more
Some people go out and buy stuff they see in windows
I don't need no ring, no car, no watch
Baby I got all I need
I know it goes to show that the more you get, the more you got
The more you want some more
Some people go out and buy stuff they've seen in books
I don't need no leather jacket baby, I'm warm when I'm with you
