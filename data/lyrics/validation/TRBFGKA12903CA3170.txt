[Verse 1]
Hey now now, they'll find you when you're sleeping now now
They'll reach in and grab what you're dreamin' now now
Cut it up and slip it back in
And I know, and I know, and I know it

[Verse 2]
Hey now now, the smallest things are crushing me now
The crush crush crush is so comforting now
Did the earth just slam in the sun?
And I know, and I know, and I know it

[Pre-Chorus]
Won't undo their past by walking and talking backwards

[Chorus x2]
Hey now now, we're goin' down down
And we ride the bus there, pay the bus fare
Or we find a new reason, a new way of living
And we breathe it in and try to dream again

[Verse 1]

[Verse 2]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus x3]
