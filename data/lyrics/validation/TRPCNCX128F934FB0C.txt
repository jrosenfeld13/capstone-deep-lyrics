So you want to walk my way

So you want to feel the same

Duties all along with rights

Sharing all my days and nights

So you want to walk my way?

Is that still the same?

You can't get out or rid of this

Cause when the frame gets hurt it crashes down

And your mother won't pick up your bones through town

Life's what you get out boy

Dirt and noise

And some wet ink paper by the telephone

No little mistake I've been exact

When counting all of the friends I've had

And how they dropped off, boy

From the Tanger beacon to Vienna

So you want to walk my way

So you want to feel the same

Duties all along with rights

Sharing all my fears inside

So you want to walk my way?

Is that still the same?

You can't get out or rid of this

Cause when the frame gets hurt it crashes down

And no house will keep you safe and sound

Until you quit them boy

They'll miss your voice

And clean the blackboard often til you name is gone

No little mistake I've been exact

When counting all of the friends I've had

And how they dropped off, boy

From the Tanger beacon to Vienna
