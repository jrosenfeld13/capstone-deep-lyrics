If you wanna get x4

If you wanna get x4

If you wanna get to know me x4

If you wanna get to know me x4

If you wanna get to know me
Then you gotta show me
Can you be there for me?
Are you strong enough?
Can you be my friend
Till the very end?
When I give you love
Will you give me love in return?

When you're close to me
I can't help it
I'm staring right through you
Wondering why you don't notice
I'd do anything
My friend's say you know my name
But it's just not the same

If you wanna get to know me
Then you gotta show me
Can you be there for me?
Are you strong enough?
Can you be my friend
Till the very end?
When I give you love
Will you give me love in return?

Will you give me love in return?

You keep playing the shy guy around me
Pretending you're too cool
Tell me your free
There's nobody you want more than me
My friend's say you know my name
It's just not the same

If you wanna get to know me
Then you gotta show me
Can you be there for me?
Are you strong enough?
Can you be my friend
Till the very end?
When I give you love
Will you give me love in return?

If you wanna get to know me x3
Will you give me love in return?

If you wanna get to know me x3
Will you give me love in return? (Echoes x8 fades)

If you wanna get x4

If you wanna get x4

If you wanna get to know me
Then you gotta show me
Can you be there for me?
Are you strong enough?
Can you be my friend
Till the very end?
When I give you love
Will you give me love in return?
