Cutting Edge album version:
Find me in the river
Find me on my knees
I've walked against the water
Now I'm waiting if You please

We've longed to see the roses
But never felt the thorns
And brought our pretty crows
But never paid the price

Find me in the river
Find me there
Find me on my knees with my soul laid bare
Even though You're gone and I'm cracked and dry
Find me in the river, I'm waiting here

Find me in the river
Find me on my knees
I've walked against the water
Now I'm waiting if You please

We didn't count on suffering
We didn't count on pain
But if the blessing's in the valley
Then in the river I will wait

Find me in the river
Find me there
Find me on my knees with my soul laid bare
Even though You're gone and I'm cracked and dry
Find me in the river, I'm waiting here

Find me in the river
Find me there
Find me on my knees with my soul laid bare
Even though You're gone and I'm cracked and dry
Find me in the river, I'm waiting here for you

Come find me

Find me in the river
Find me here
Oh, wash over me
Find me here
