[Verse 1]
Fell from grace, I lost my faith
My heart feels like a stone
I'm paying the price of of a drunken night
I'm wasting in the twilight zone
Broke the spell, I hate myself
The light of love don't shine
A women's touch can cost so much
I've lost my pearl, messing with swine

[Chorus 1]
Fly me home on a big jet plane
Fly me home through the thunder and rain
Fly me home to the healing hands
Fly me home to the promised land

[Verse 2]
Pain won't quit, my head's in bits
Desire as sin is a jail
I'll make a vow and break a vow
Oh, nothing beats a try but a fail

[Chorus 1]
Fly me home on a big jet plane
Fly me home through the thunder and rain
Fly me home to the healing hands
Fly me home to the promised land

[Chorus 1]
Fly me home on a big jet plane
Fly me home through the thunder and rain
Fly me home to the healing hands
Fly me home to the promised land

[Chorus 2]
Take me home on a big jet plane
Take me home through the thunder and rain
Take me home to the healing hands
Take me home to the promised land

[Chorus 2]
Take me home on a big jet plane
Take me home through the thunder and rain
Take me home to the healing hands
Take me home to the promised land
