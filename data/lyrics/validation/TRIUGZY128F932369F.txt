I came home this morning
Oh what a shock
When I found out my key
No longer fit my lock
Oh baby
You just go right back out there where you've been
'Cause while you were slippin' out
Oh someone else was slippin' in

I thought I was your fool
That you could count on
One was right there
When no one else is at home
But oh baby
I think I found myself a new friend
But while you were slippin' out
Oh Lord, someone else was slippin' in

Now cry your heart out
Oh you don't mean a thing to me
I'm a brand new man
And you can plainly see
A new way to walk people and of wearin' my hair
This big smile you see on my face
You didn't put it there
I got a new way of wearin' my hair
This big smile on my face babe
You didn't put it there
Oh baby
You just take me back out there where you've been
'Caue while you were slippin' out
Someone else was slippin' in
Oh Lord

Now cry your heart out
Oh you don't mean a thing to me
I'm a brand new man
Even Stevie Wonder can see
A new way to walk people and of wearin' my hair
This big smile on my face baby
You didn't put it there

I got a new way of wearin' my hair
This big smile on my face
You didn't put it there
Oh baby
You just go right back out there where you've been
'Cause while you were slippin' out
Someone else was slippin' in
I said while you were slippin' out
Someone else was slippin' in
I said while you were slippin' out
Oh someone else was slippin' in
I said while you were slippin' out
Someone else was slippin' in
