Gene Simmons: In Detroit, the body of a Michigan youth was reported dead at the scene of a head on collision on Grand Avenue this morning. He was reportedly driving on the wrong side of the boulevard when he struck a delivery truck and was catapulted through the windshield of his car. The driver of the truck is reported to be uninjured. The identities of both men are being withheld by local police

[Over car radio, sung quietly: "I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day" ]

[Verse 1]
I feel uptight on a Saturday night
Nine o'clock, the radio's the only light
I hear my song, and it pulls me through
Comes on strong, tells me what I got to do
I got to

[Chorus]
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
You gotta lose your mind in Detroit Rock City

[Chorus]
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat

[Verse 2]
Getting late
I just can't wait
Ten o'clock, and I know I gotta hit the road
First I drink, then I smoke
Start the car, and I try to make the midnight show

[Chorus]
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat

[Verse 3]
Moving fast, down 95
Hit top speed, but I'm still moving much too slow
I feel so good, I'm so alive
Hear my song playing on the radio
It goes

[Chorus]
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat

[Verse 4]
Twelve o'clock, I gotta rock
There's a truck ahead, lights staring at my eyes
Oh my God, no time to turn
I got to laugh 'cause I know I'm gonna die
Why

[Chorus]
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get up!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
