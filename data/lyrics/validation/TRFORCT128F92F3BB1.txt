You think you're on a roll
Your garbage turns to gold
Tell everyone
You're going it alone

You whine and bitch and moan
For another cushion on the throne
Tell everyone
You're going it alone

You've broken every bone you're made of
You know what you're afraid of
But you're made of stone

You're climbing out your hole
And now you're in control
Tell everyone
You're going it alone

You've broken every bone you're made of
You know what you're afraid of
But you're made of stone (x2)
