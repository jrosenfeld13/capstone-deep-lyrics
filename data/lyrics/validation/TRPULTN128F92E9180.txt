This scene is divine
Enemies, they start surrounding me
Mostly in my head cause I swear
I've never been so depressed

I can't stand anyone here
I'm thinking, "let's just disappear,"
And we'll roll the dice on a beach-front tropical paradise

I'm ready to go where palm trees always blow
I'm sick of this crowd
We are getting out!

I wanna go where there's no one we know
Where stars glitter like a 70's disco
Come on, come on, I say "Let's get outta here!"
We gotta go where we have no worries
Wet beaches and dry martinis
Come on, come on, let's get outta here
Let's get outta here

Maybe I'm going crazy
The mainstream never made any sense to me
Always on the outside looking in
But I swear that we're fitting in

They say we'll never make it
Truth is I couldn't care any less
I think the visions of grandure are the only gifts I'll ever have

We are getting out!

I wanna go where there's no one we know
Where stars glitter like a 70's disco
Come on, come on, I say "Let's get outta here!"
We gotta go where we have no worries
Wet beaches and dry martinis
Come on, come on, let's get outta here

I'm ready to go where palm trees always blow
I'm sick of this crowd, we are getting out

I wanna go where there's no one we know
Where stars glitter like a 70's disco
Come on, come on, I say "Let's get outta here!"
We gotta go where we have no worries
Wet beaches and dry martinis
Come on, come on, I say "Let's get outta here!"
We gotta go where we live out loud
You know we're sick of this crowd
Come on, come on, let's get outta here
Let's get outta here
Let's get outta here
