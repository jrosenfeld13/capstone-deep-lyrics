Keep the wheels turning
On this lonely road
A slave of mother nature
I've got to get back home
Such a grey coloured nightmare
Of what used to be so good
Dreams and desires
It's the way - the way of the world

See a light in the distance
Going to show me the way
Another road to be taken
Another stage to be on
Carry me, carry me
A little closer home
Dreams and desires
It's the way - the way of the world

Stormy weather, take me to
Back where I belong
At the airport, on the plane
Now I'm going home
Takes so long, flying high
I just love the way of the world
