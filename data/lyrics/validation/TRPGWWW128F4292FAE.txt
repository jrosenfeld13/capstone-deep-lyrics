The show is over - close the storybook
There will be no encore
And all the random hands that i have shook
Well, they're reaching for the door
I watch the backs as they leave single-file
You stood stubborn, cheering all the while

I know i can be colorful
I know i can be grey
I know this loser's living fortunate
Cause i know you will love me either way

Most were being good for goodness sake
But you wouldn't pantomine
You are more beautiful when you awake
Than most are in a lifetime
Through the haze that is my memory
You stayed for drama though you paid for a comedy

I know i can be colorful
I know i can be grey
I know this loser's living fortunate
Cause i know you will love me either way

Look ahead as far as you can see
We live in drama but we'll die in a comedy

I know i can be colorful (when you live in black and white)
I know i can be grey (my colors fade away)
I know this loser's living fortunate
Cause i know you will love me either way

I know i can be colorful (when you live in black and white)
I know i can be grey (my colors fade away)
I know this loser's living fortunate
And i know you will love me
Yes i know you will love me
I know you will love me either way
