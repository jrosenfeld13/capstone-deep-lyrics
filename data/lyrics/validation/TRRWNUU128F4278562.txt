[Verse 1]
Burning for the exposure
Slipping out of phase again
Monochromatic motion
Make me laugh at the notion
Violate your terms of service
Shoplift, you don't deserve this now
Scratch the earth, caress the surface
Controlled by your own drone after all

[Verse 2]
Cold call from Myanmar
Maybe I'll make a friend
Burning trash in the next life
It's just some phase you're in
On a scale of one to ten, can you
Rate your experience?
Top shelf, learn to help yourself
Now it's getting serious

[Chorus]
XYZ, we'll see, we'll see
XYZ, we'll see, we'll see
What I'm after
XYZ, we'll see, we'll see
What I'm after
XYZ, we'll see, we'll see
What I'm after
