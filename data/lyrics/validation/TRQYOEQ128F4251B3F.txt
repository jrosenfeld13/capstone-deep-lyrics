La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lie, lie, lie
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lie, lie, lie
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lie, lie, lie
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lie, lie, lie
My baby, my baby, let me know
Because you love me, you love me, let me go
And you're my lover, you pay me
Twice my size and on your knees you lay in my thighs
Take my hand and let's end it all
She broke her little bones on the boulders below
Take my hand and let's end it all
My baby, my baby, let me go
And if you love me, you love me, let me go
'Cause I'm your brother, your brother, have some pride
And now you love me, you love me then die tonight
Take my hand and let's end it all
She broke her little bones on the boulders below
Take my hand and let's end it all
Broke her little bones on the boulders below
And while she fell I delightfully said
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lie, lie, lie
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lie, lie, lie
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lie, lie, lie
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lie, lie, lie
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lie, lie, lie
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lie, lie, lie
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lie, lie, lie
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lie, lie, lie
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lie, lie, lie
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lie, lie, lie
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lie, lie, lie
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lie, lie, lie
She took my hand and I let her go
She broke her little bones on the boulders below
Took my hand and she ended it all
Broke her little bones on the boulders below
And while she fell I smiled
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lie, lie, lie
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lie, lie, lie
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lie, lie, lie
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lie, lie, lie
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lie, lie, lie
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lie, lie, lie
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lie, lie, lie
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lie, lie, lie
