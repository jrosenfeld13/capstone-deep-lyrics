Cinnamon Hearts

We filled up on whiskey
We filled up on wine
We filled up on cinnamon hearts
And when we were done
Took our tingly tongues
And licked all our favorite parts

We drank ourselves dry
We stoned ourselves high
And wound up in somebody's hedge
We dosed ourselves close to the edge
And over I don't wanna go
Said, over I don't wanna go

(whistling)

You smoke too much
And I'm such a lush
Together we're quite the disgrace, so
You've got that innocent motherly touch
And I've got that rosy-cheeked face

We filled up on whiskey
We filled up on wine
We filled up on cinnamon hearts
And when we were done
Took our tingly tongues
And licked all our favorite parts

We drank ourselves dry
We stoned ourselves high
And wound up in somebody's hedge
We dosed ourselves close to the edge
And over I don't wanna go
Over I don't wanna go
