I cannot explain
When I thought that I heard
The creatures were calling your name
Caling your name
But the sounds are all the same
It's the ghost in your bed
Figure out what he is saying

Oh, yes I do
Oh, yes I do
I can't believe, I can't believe that it's true
Oh, yes I do

It feels wrong and it feels right
It's the sound in my head
That's pounding away in the night
Away in the night
When we're dancing in the light
And you ask if i thought what we were doing was right

Oh, yes i do
Oh, yes i do
I can't believe
I can't believe that it's true
Oh, yes i do

You don't want the simple life
You don't want the simple life
You don't want the simple life
You don't want the simple life

Oh, yes i do
Oh, yes you do
