Here and now, I wanna be the one for you
In everything you want me to
'Cos I couldn't live if we're apart
(Here and now)

Time, is running out for you and me
'Cos nothing's what it's used to be
I guess I'm the only one to blame
But I promise you to make it right
Forget all the sorrows you bare within tonight
Believe in me when I say...

Here and now, I wanna be the one for you
And everything you want me to
'Cos I couldn't live if we're apart
(Here and now)

Say, there's something I can do
If I can make it up to you
For everytime I let you down
And I promise you to make it right
Forget all the sorrows you bear within tonight
Believe in me when I say...

Here and now, I wanna be the one for you
And everything you want me to
'Cos I couldn't live if we're apart

Here and now, let's tear down the walls together
It's better late then never
I know that we will find away, here and now
I'll be there for you, there for you, there for you
Here and nowwwwwwwwwww

Here and now, I wanna be the one for you (wanna be the one)
And everything you want me to
'Cos I couldn't live if we're apart
Here and now, I wanna fall in love again
And try to be the best I can
So give me a chance to win your heart

Here and now, I wanna be the one for you
