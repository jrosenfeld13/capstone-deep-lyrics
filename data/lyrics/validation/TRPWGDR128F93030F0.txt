Razor dragging junkies line
The bottom of the pool as I
Swim towards the sun
Every day ain't Mother's Day
And every woman ain't your mum
Sometimes funky isn't fun
And it would be easy
To become somebody else
But at this particular point in time
I'll hang on to myself

I... I... I...
I'm swimming towards the sun
And I... I... I...
I'm not the only one

People throw Forget-Me-Nots
The bullets through the flesh they're shot
A tattoo with a name
It's harder to forget the hate
When it's the only thing you generate
And it's you I'd like to blame

It would be easy
To blame somebody else
But at this particular point in time
I'd like to take the blame myself

I... I... I...
I'm swimming towards the sun
And I... I... I...
I'm not the only one
And I... I... I...
I'm getting the feeling
For everyone

For everyone
For everyone
For everyone

I... I... I...
I'm swimming towards the sun
And I... I... I...
I'm not the only one
And I... I... I...
I'm getting the feeling
For everyone

For everyone
For everyone
For everyone
