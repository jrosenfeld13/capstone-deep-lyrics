[Verse 1]
I've been disheveled by this drink
By the pint's sight and stink
Never enough times to stop and make me think
I've wrapped around some fingers
Riddled rich in ringworm
I'm swollen still
Poisoned by the sting

[Chorus]
The black pint is my drink
And you see my link
And I steal and you sink
And you spill and I drink

[Verse 2]
She's broken saintly vows
She's viable and loud
Auspiciously, she kicks me when I'm down
I'll never leave her side
Because of my pissiness or pride
Oh, how I'm shady, in the shadow of my bride

[Chorus]
The black pint is my dream
From orange, white, and green
With nightmares of poteen
Spittin' up in the sink

[Bridge]
Shove it up your ass
In your ear my dear
It's the best thing that's happened to me
In twenty-eight fucking years

[Verse 3]
So I'll thank my lucky stars
That there's a bad moon to rise
And it's the best God has to offer
To hang in our skies
And when your snubbed then loved
It's like your fondling the dove
You better suck on something sacred
Because you'll never see above

[Chorus]
The black pint is my drink
And you see my link
And I steal and you sink
And you spill and I drink
And you spill and I drink
