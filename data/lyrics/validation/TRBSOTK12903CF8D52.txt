I'm only real -
At Places I cannot be

My right Hand rebels
And chops off the Left
(The) hairy Ape walks into Stage
He tries to stay erect

The One who never slept
In Order to be perfected
The Arrogance of their Hands
The joy of the Regret

Soulsick
Good at things I never did

Soulsick - but skin deep
Tense, frantic - but relieved

Soulsick - but skin deep
Tense, frantic - but believed

I'm only real - at Places I cannot be

Dead liquid vigilant
Implanted into my Sleep

The One who never slept
The One, who stays erect
The One who is profound
The One - I do reject

Soulsick, but Skin deep
Tense, frantic - but relieved
Soulsick, but skin deep
Tense, frantic - but believed

Soulsick
Good at things I never did

I'm only real at Places I cannot be

Soulsick - but skin deep
I'm not real, just believed in

Soulsick, but Skin deep
Not real - just believe it
