Workin' out really helped, take a look at me now
I'm in the middle of a project on the brink of a breakthrough
It's on the tip of my tongue people
Always make things harder than they are
Sittin' on your ass won't get you very far
Fallin' off the wagon, help me get on up, I'm backslidin' on ya
Cant remember that big idea that's floatin' in the back of my mind
Don't try to feed me any of your lies
Your problems might be big but it's not about the size
The problem is solved, you can't believe
I'll untangle any web they try to weave
You know what I mean, hook my brain to a laptop screen
The problem is solved, your worries are gone
What to do with the body once the mind is blown
You hear what I said, big idea in the back of my head
You got willpower but you dont got no guts
You think you made a difference but it wasn't quite enough
Psychic wars are ragin' behind closed doors
They want us outta here paranoid addiction
You heed its call, you know it's only fear
Cut their lies in half with a dose of truth
Goosebumps when you come near right on the brink of a fit
'Cause in your mind you think you wanna kill
Brainwashed away to an earthly grave
By nicotine and designer pills
People always make things harder than they are
Sittin' on your ass won't get you very far
The problem is solved, you can't believe
I'll untangle any web they try to weave
The problem is solved, your worries are gone
What to do with the body once the mind is blown
Workin' out really helped, take a look at me now
I'm in the middle of a project on the brink of a breakthrough
It's on the tip of my tongue
