Alll those failed attempts
Against reality's glare
Patience only gets one so far
We'll fail by design
With no lack of motive
Rising in vain
Against the same blank wall
Go release yourself
From the clutches of hope
And get locked up in the same old circle

Disintegrate
Disappear
Dissipate
You were just a shadow of your past

Incinerate
Emulate
Elevate
You're starting to care less with every chance

I'm ready now to accept my fate
And bleed the tears I'll never understand
I'm ready now to accept my fate
And bleed the tears I'll never understand
I'm ready now to accept my fate
And bleed the tears I'll never understand

Arm your words
With shards of nails
Arm your words
With shards of nails

Disintegrate
Disappear
Dissipate
You were just a shadow of your past

Incinerate
Emulate
Elevate
You're starting to care less with every chance

Disintegrate
Disappear
Dissipate
You were just a shadow of your past

Incinerate
Emulate
Elevate
You're starting to care less with every chance

The universe is yours
Even if it's an empty one
Your words are yours
Even if they're blank
The truth is yours
Even if it lies
And your time is up
So watch me smile
