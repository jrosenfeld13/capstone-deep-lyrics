[Verse 1]
I'm crawling through landmines just to know where you are
There's smoke in my eyes 'cause you're burning the ground
I'm crawling through landmines just to feel where you are
Under cover of night, I put a pearl in the ground

[Chorus]
Where'd you go?
(Not so far)
Please don't go
(Not too far)
Where'd you go?
(Not so far)
Please don't go
(Not too far)

I found your ring with the feather on
One arm in and one arm gone
Save this ring, let's bring Paris right here

Oh, my dear
My love
Do you know, my love?
Do you know?

[Verse 2]
I'm crawling through landmines just to feel where you've been
There's gauze over my eyes but you're leaving this trail
I'm crawling through landmines
I know 'cause I planted them
Under cover of night, I put my heart in the ground

[Chorus]
Oh, where'd you go?
(Not so far)
Please don't go
(Not too far)
Where'd you go?
(Not so far)
Please don't go
(Not too far)

I found your glove with the leather torn
Five fingers that I'm counting on
Smoke signals to call you right here

Oh, my love
My dear
My love
My dear
