Free my mind, taught to run
I didn't get to your mind
You'll see another part of me
Go ahead, I'll work around
You didn't, didn't get what you need
It's over now
Stop trying to apologize, no one else to blame
I've been down, right down on my knees too many times
Everything has to end
A distant memory
Everything has to change
But you take a part of me
I see anew, mistakes I've made
I'll hold on to life and start again
Everything has to end
A distant memory
Everything has to change
But you take a part of me
