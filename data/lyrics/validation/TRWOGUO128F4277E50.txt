In The Jungle
Troddding up inna the Jungle one day
Let me tell you what I encountered yeah (x2)
First I buck up on a elephant him always remind me of things
Like every morning back when we were kings
Until they stole us away from west African shores
Then I reason with the monkeys crew
Don't know what to say that the monkey won't do now
To steal my tunes them still a meditate
And from my locks to my socks you know them bound to imitate me
Troddding up inna the Jungle one day
Let me tell you what I encountered yeah (x2)
Then I buck up on a crocodile swamp
Everybody know that them guy deh nu romp
Gee singer; say you looking kinda thinner
Come to my house and we'll discuss it over dinner
Well Mr. Snake say him a mask when him a pass
Try to interrupt the Lion cause
Him slithering the bring the pain
I crush his head and I slightly bruise my heal again Da-Da
Troddding up inna the Jungle one day
Let me tell you what I encountered yeah (x2)
Bridge
Truth and facts well Babylon them re-assemble when the Lion roar, the whole Jungle tremble
Truth and facts well Vatican them a conceal it When the lion roars, the whole Jungle feel it!
Well Mr. Tiger said him not going change
Don't care how that Jungle look strange
Him not going switch him stripes to mix up in a medley
Don't care how that Jungle looks deadly
INI man is a Lion too, no where in the Jungle the Lion don't gwaan rude
INI man is a Lion too, no where in the Jungle the Lion don't play tunes
Troddding up inna the Jungle one day
Let me tell you what I encountered yeah (x2)
Well Mr. Tiger said him not going change
Don't care how that Jungle look strange
Him not going switch him stripes to mix up in a medley
Don't care how that Jungle looks deadly
INI man is a Lion too, no where in the Jungle the Lion don't gwaan rude
INI man is a Lion too, no where in the Jungle the Lion don't play tunes
Bridge
Truth and facts well Babylon them re-assemble when the Lion roar, the whole Jungle tremble
Truth and facts well Vatican them a conceal it When the lion roars, the whole Jungle feel it!
