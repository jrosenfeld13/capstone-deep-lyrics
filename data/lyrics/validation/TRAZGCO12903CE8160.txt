Turn up that radio
Our kind of rock and roll
My place has louzy reception
But this is how I want to go
And I hope you know
I'm glad we made this connection

Maybe I'll let you know
Before I grow old
But I don't know
Feels like the end of the world

But I ain't seen Manhattan yet
Except on my TV set
But I've got a good Imagination
And I could be contented here
It's as good a place as any other
You're my only desired destination

Maybe I'll see it all
Before I grow old
But I don't know
Might be the end of the world

Baby I'll just lock us in here
And we can slow dance forever
We'll pass on in sweet isolation
That way nothing will change in us
Except the lines on our faces
No, we won't even change the station

Maybe we'll grow up
Before we grow old
I don't know
Feels like the end of the world
