Zulu man is feelin' blue
Gear his heart beat a little tattoo
Diga diga doo diga doo doo
Diga diga doo diga doo

You love me and I love you
And when you love it is natural to
Diga diga doo diga doo doo
Diga diga doo diga doo

I'm so very diga diga doo by nature
If you don't say diga diga to your mate
You're gonna lose a papa

So let those funny people smile
How can there be a Virgin isle
With diga diga doo diga doo doo
Diga diga doo diga doo

No one heeds the marriage laws
Yours is mine and mine is yours
With diga diga doo diga doo doo
Diga diga doo diga doo
