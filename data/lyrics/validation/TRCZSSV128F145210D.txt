You know the place where faces fit
I've heard they've got a name for it
Let's go back to the sandy shores
The velvet skies are ours once more

We're fake, for real
Our minds are steel
Our eyes are green
We're sold as seen

I heard you joined the main parade
A hero dressed in ticker-tape
And go if all your world's a trick
I'll take the sky and measure it
So leave your faded photographs
The only thing you had that lasts
And go back to the sandy shores
The velvet skies are ours once more

They're all for real
There is no deal
No in-between
They're sold as seen

You know the place where faces fit
I've heard they've got a name for it
Lets go back to the sandy shores
The velvet skies are yours once more

You're fake, for real
Your mind is steel
Your eyes are green
You're sold as seen
Sold as seen

We're fake, for real
Our minds are steel
Our eyes are green
We're sold as seen
Sold as seen
