I didn't call you today
Didn't think I could trust my voice in all that noise
Fighting for the space, staring down at these words
Tearing up all the reasons why I should try
But God knows why it hurts to be watching, waiting and pleading when everyone here can see

That I cant heal this rift, feel plates shift
Tell me, me don't tell me everything is fine
One move and I'll slip, one breath I drift
Tell me, don't tell me everything is fine
Stuck here on this faultline

Im walking down to the park
Trying too hard to forget, the wet cement where you left your heart
Tangled more than torn, dangled so long it must it's true, I still do
But God knows why it hurts to be watching, waiting and pleading, when everyone here can see

That I cant heal this rift, feel plates shift
Tell me, me don't tell me everything is fine
One move and I'll slip, one breath I drift
Tell me, don't tell me everything is fine
Stuck here on this faultline

I never wanted more, no never needed more
I hope you know, I never meant you harm
Should have drawn you closer, should have kept my distance
Wish I could but this is the length of my arm

Cant heal this rift, feel plates shift
Tell me, don't tell me everything is fine
Cant heal this rift, feel plates shift
Tell me, don't tell me everything is fine
One move and I'll slip, one breath I drift
Tell me, don't tell me everything is fine
Stuck here on this faultline
