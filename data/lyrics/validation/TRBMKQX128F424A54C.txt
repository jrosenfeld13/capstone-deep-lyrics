Dance with me pretty boy tonight
Dance with me and we'll be all right
There's a whole floor before us
Just for you and me
So follow my lead and we'll 1, 2, 3
Pull shapes!

I like to disco
I like to rock 'n' roll
Well, I like to hip hop
We can do it all, just don't let the music stop
Pull shapes!

I lead with my left hand
I stomp with my right foot
Well, I just wanna freak out
I just wanna move, I don't care what the song's about

Dance with me pretty boy tonight
Dance with me and we'll be all right
There's a whole floor before us
Just for you and me
So follow my lead and we'll 1, 2, 3
Pull shapes!

Is there a drum beat? (pull shapes)
And is the bass sweet? (pull shapes)
Well, then the rhythm is complete
So get up on the floor it's time for you to move your feet

Dance with me pretty boy tonight
Dance with me and we'll be all right
There's a whole floor before us
Just for you and me
So follow my lead and we'll 1, 2, 3

What do you do when the music stops?
What do you do when the music stops?
What do you do when the music stops?
What do you do when the music stops?
