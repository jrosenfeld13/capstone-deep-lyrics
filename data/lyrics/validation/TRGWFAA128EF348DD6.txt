[Chorus]
There goes my heart
Breaking in two
There go my eyes
Crying over you
My arms don't want
For us to part
So when you go
Here come the blues
There goes my heart

[Verse 1]
You told me once
We'd never part
That you loved me
With all your heart
But now these words of love
You're going to erase
You've found somebody new
Who wants to take my place

[Chorus]
There goes my heart
Breaking in two
There go my eyes
Crying over you
My arms don't want
For us to part
So when you go
Here come the blues
There goes my heart

[Verse 2]
I'm standing on
A bridge that's burned
It's just a lonely
Lesson learned
To see you walk away
With him hurts me so
This fool who loves you
Doesn't want to let you go

[Chorus]
There goes my heart
Breaking in two
There go my eyes
Crying over you
My arms don't want
For us to part
So when you go
Here come the blues
There goes my heart

[Tag]
So when you go
Here come the blues
There goes my heart
So when you go
Here come the blues
There goes my heart
