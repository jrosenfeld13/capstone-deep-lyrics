[Intro]
Hey hey hey hey hey
I believe that I'm back
I believe I'm on the right track
Hey hey hey hey hey

[Verse 1]
I know the feelin' of bein' without
When deep within you're deep without
Only way to clear the doubt
Is turnin' all your insides out

[Chorus]
Time in for gettin' back
I believe, I believe
I'm on the right track
Time in for gettin' back
I believe, I believe
That I'm on the right track

Hey, hey, hey, hey hey
Hey hey hey hey hey
I believe (I believe) that I'm back (that I'm back)
I believe (got a good feeling) I'm on the right track
Hey hey hey hey hey

[Verse 2]
Sometimes that that has caused so much
Is really not at all to touch
If what I see is right in front of me
There's no reason to need a crutch

[Chorus]
Time in for gettin' back
I believe, I believe
I'm on the right track
Time in for gettin' back
I believe, I believe
I'm on the right track

I said time in for gettin' back
I believe, I believe
That I'm on the right track
Time in for gettin' back
I believe, I believe, I believe
I'm on the right track

Hey (hey), hey (hey), hey hey hey hey
I believe (I believe) that I'm back (that I'm back)
I believe (got a good feeling) I'm on the right track (on the right track)
Hey hey hey hey hey

[Verse 3]
Ain't it sweet when finding out
That deep within you're not without
When nothingness had the police wheel route
I'm just turnin' my insides out

[Chorus]
Time in, no turnin' back, uh-huh
I believe, I believe
I'm on the right track
Time in for gettin' back
I believe, I believe
I'm on the right track
Time in for gettin' back
Time in for gettin' back...
