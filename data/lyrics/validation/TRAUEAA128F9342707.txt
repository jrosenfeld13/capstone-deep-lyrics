So sorry son, you're worrying your mother
No explanation's gonna make it seem alright
Young boy, listen to your father
It's more than just your life, it's more than suicide
How does it feel?
When you're looking down the barrel of a loaded gun...
Tell me how it feels
Did you see your life
Flash right before your eyes?
Stop playing games and get yourself up off the floor
Young boy we're going to send you to the lions
The men all dressed in white
When you became undone
How does it feel
When i might have brought you up but you are not my son
Tell me how it feels

So many times i tried to bring you up you brought me down
I won't consider you again
Stop looking at me like you care
I worked my fingers to the bone
I'm not your father or your friend
You might have lived here once but this is not your home
Tell me how it feels
You don't mean much to me
I didn't plant the seed
I'm not your father cause you didn't turn out right
Young boy, send you to the fire
The men all dressed in white, it's more than suicide
How does it feel?(x3)
When you're looking down the barrel of the loaded gun...
Tell me how it feels
