What the world needs now is love, sweet love
It's the only thing, that there's just too little of
What the world needs now is love, sweet love
No, not just for some, but for everyone

What the world needs now is love, sweet love
It's the only thing, that there's just too little of
What the world needs now is love, sweet love
No, not just for some, but for everyone

Lord, we don't need another mountain
There are mountains and hillsides enough to climb
There are oceans and rivers enough to cross
Enough to last 'til the end of time

What the world needs now is love, sweet love
No, not just for some, but for everyone

What the world needs now is love, sweet love
It's the only thing, that there's just too little of
What the world needs now is love, sweet love
No, not just for some, oh, but just for every-, every-, everyone
