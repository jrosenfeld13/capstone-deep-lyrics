There's a farm called Misery, but of that we'll have none
Because we know of one
That's always lots of fun (Ha ha!)
And this one's name is Jollity; believe me, folks, it's great
For everything sings out to us as we go through the gate

All the little pigs, they grunt and howl
The cats mee-yow
The dogs bow-wow
Everybody makes a row
Down on Jollity Farm

All the little pigs, they grunt and howl
(Grunt, howl, grunt, howl)
The cats mee-yow
(Mee-yow, mee-yow)
The dogs bow-wow
(Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff)
Everybody makes a row
Down on Jollity Farm

All the little birds go tweet, tweet, tweet
(birdsong, piano noodle)
The lambs all bleat
(baaaaa!)
And shake their feet
(rattle)
Everything's a perfect treat
Down on Jollity Farm

Regular as habit
The cocks begin to crow
Can the old buck rabbit
Sing "Stuff it up your jumper"
Vo-do-de-oh

All the little ducks go quack quack quack
(quack quack quack)
The cows go Moo
(honk)
The bull does, too
(whonk!)
Everyone says how do you do
Down on Jollity Farm
