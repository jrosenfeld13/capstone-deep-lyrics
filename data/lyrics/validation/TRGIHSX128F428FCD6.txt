Talk talkin' 'bout my kinda woman
Talk talkin' 'bout my kinda woman
Talk talkin' 'bout my kinda woman
Talk talkin' 'bout my kinda woman

Ahh, she's somethin' to see
When it comes to lovin', she's wild and free
If I had to replace her, it would take two or three
'Cause she's the woman that was born for me
If she left me, I'd hang from the nearest oak tree

Talk talkin' 'bout my kinda woman
Talk talkin' 'bout my kinda woman
Talk talkin' 'bout my kinda woman
Talk talkin' 'bout my kinda woman

I'm talkin' bout my kinda woman
She's somethin' to see
She never sets foot in the kitchen
But she sure cooks for me, yeah

Talk talkin' 'bout my kinda woman
Talk talkin' 'bout my kinda woman
Talk talkin' 'bout my kinda woman
Talk talkin' 'bout my kinda woman

I'm talkin' bout my kinda woman
She's somethin' to see
Woe to the person who crosses her path
She sees right through them, they see their last

Yeah
This is for you, baby

'Cause she's the one who holds my hand
And she don't have to break no bread
She's the one who always knows
She's got my heart and I love her so

Talk talkin' 'bout my kinda woman
Talk talkin' 'bout my kinda woman
Talk talkin' 'bout my kinda woman
Talk talkin' 'bout my kinda woman

Oh, be still my beating heart
