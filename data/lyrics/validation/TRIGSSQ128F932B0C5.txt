Lagos City
Versus new york o!
Got to look busy
Make some money flow
Between the buildings
We don't look
Drive by, armed robbery
Or a stick up
Ain't no pity everybody knows

Cuz its our city
And we love it so
Cuz its our city
And we love it so

New york's busy
But lagos is all for show
Orisha junctions
In manhattan crossroads
"go-slow" is what you call
A gridlock
Our sacrifices you dig up
On okada
To taxi yellow

Cuz its our city
And we love it so
Cuz its our city
And we love it so

New york city
Just like home
Yet so rugged
Lagos city
Yeah you know
We get so rugged

Lagos city
New york of the third world?
Our one mosquito
Killed a million microbes
Well there's no sanitation n our
Prison
You can't say "i'm on vacation"
They won't listen
You got to "dash" the policeman
Cuz he ain't gonna let you go
