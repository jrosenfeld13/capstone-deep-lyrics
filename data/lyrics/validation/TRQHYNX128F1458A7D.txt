Let's dance, put on your red shoes and dance the blues Let's dance, to the song they're playin' on the radio Let's sway, while color lights up your face
Let's sway, sway through the crowd to an empty space
If you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall into my arms
And tremble like a flower
Let's dance Ld's dance, for fear your grace should fall Let's dance, for fear tonight is all
Let's sway, you could look into my eyes
Let's sway, under the moonlight, this serious moonlight
And if you say run, I'll run with you
And if you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall into my arms
And tremble like a flower
Let's dance, put on your red shoes and dance the blues Let's sway, under the moonlight, this serious moonlight Let's dance Ld's dance
Let's dance, dance, dance
Let's dance - Gregory Isaacs
I want to dance with you all night long
My arms want to hold you all night long
As we embrace and you heart came close to mine
I get so excited I could cry
I want to feel your lips resting by mine*
As we swing and sway down the line
I can see the love light shining in your eyes
I get so excited I could cry
I want to dance with you all night long
Caress me darling with all your charms
As we embrace and your heart came close to mine
I get so excited I could cry
Let me hold your hand all night long
Put your arms around me, hold me strong
I want to dance with you all night long
Dance with you all night long
As we embrace and you heart came close to mine
I get so happy I could cry
I wanna dance with you !
