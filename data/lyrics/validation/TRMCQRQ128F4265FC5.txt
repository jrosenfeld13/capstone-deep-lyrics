We're on the slow boat rokin'
Bound for Trinidad 
There's a warm wind blowin'
Bound for Trinidad 
A shell of bad weed burnin'
Bound for Trinidad 
With a cool juice flowin'
Bound for Trinidad 
Now ders a party swingin'
In the tropical heat
I can see young girls dancin'
To the calypso beat
Dem-a-windin' and skankin'
Shakin' the coco trees
Der bare feet hoppin' anna jumpin'
In the evenin' breeze
