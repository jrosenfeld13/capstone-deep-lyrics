Fools come and go, Princess of mine
Is that what you're thinking, as your eyes pass me by?

Oh send me flowers, I stay for hours
Penniless is how you really feel
You shouldn't let me stay so long
You cut me up with images this real

Look this way, forget today
This is just the way you think you feel
I count to ten and ask again
Give you one last chance to make it real

Ten steps away, for making me stay
Ten steps away, for making me stay
