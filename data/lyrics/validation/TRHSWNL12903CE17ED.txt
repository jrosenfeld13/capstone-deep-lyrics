History Of A Time To Come
The Church Bizzare
The stage is set my friends for the play
That never ends -
This comedy we call the Church Bizzare
Once you enetr you are bound to find
Salvation by the pound
Assured the more you pay the nearer God
You are

Your mouth so paralysed with fear you
Dare not speak
Your eyes so blind and hypnotised you
Cannot weep
So blinkered to reality that you no
Longer care
That profit is the prophet of corruption
And despair

Bring on the dancers -
Bring on the clowns
Who invite you to ride on their
Merry-go-rounds
They make the money and they make the rules
You 'Born-Again-Christians' are born again fools

THE EVANGELIST PRAYER:
God of wealth and God of might guide me
To your paradise
I may walk your streets of gold
Though my heart is cold and still I rest
In peace my pockets filled
And bear the smile of one who knows
Through God's Love my cup overflows

A 'salvation salesman's dream -
Guillible to the extreme
Easy pickings for the charm and 'savoir faire'
Of these charlatans and theives whose
Delight is to decieve - all the fools who
Still believe they really care

And if all the Devil's minions were let
Loose to do their will
I think they'd be hard pressed to match
In diabolic skill
The wickedness and treachery of this evangelic horde
Who sheler their corruption with the banner of their Lord

(Repeat 3 & 4)

The curtain never falls on the show that has it all
Taken in you can't begin to see their lies
For the people who are clapping are the ones who will be laughing
At your fate
They just can't wait to bleed you dry
