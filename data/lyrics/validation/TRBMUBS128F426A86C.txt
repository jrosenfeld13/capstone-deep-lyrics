Mankind is not feeling the truth
And you are gonna pay the price
Just pollutin' the environment
...is growing step by step
Green and uncertainty
Eats our soul
I don't wanna pay this
Goddamn f*cking toll
Ease, case my pain
Your sickness drives me insane
Ease my pain
Feels like we're rotting with no brain
We've got unreal impressions
Of a world that can't survive
We call it progression
For real it's decay
Criminals come to office
In countries we used to trust
So can't you see your world in agony
Into your... rights
Prison camps and bodies mount
In a world that is condemned
Ease my pain
Your sickness drives me insane
Ease my pain
Feels like we're rotting with no brain
