Voice that leads me on
As distant as the days before are gone
Something I have lost
Has left a space that keeps me stumbling on

Search through the rain and the sun
Or the night for the day I will find
Watch all the moments are tumbling through
Like the clouds I will leave them behind

They fade
I want to fade

Is there a place for me?
Somewhere?
Is there a place for me?
From stone against stone against stone
In my way
In my way

Cry that holds me down
Is closer than the fear of what's to come
Somehow I must change
Uncertainty has left me here undone

Search through the stars and the shapes in the sky
For the day I will find
Look for a sign with my eyes I could see
As it quiets my mind

They fade
I want to fade

Oh, is there a place for me?
Somewhere?
Is there a place for me?
From stone against stone against stone
In my way
In my way

Out
Out of my hands
Oh, these prisoner's hands that carved me through
With stone

And that's the stone of my heart
A prisoner's heart that can't feel love
I'm told
Told of another time
Another place
Another

Oh, is there a place for me?
Is there a place for me?
Somewhere?

Oh, is there a place for me?
Is there a place for me?
Somewhere?

Is there a place for me?
Is there a place for me?
Somewhere?

Somewhere?
Somewhere?

I've got to find somewhere
I've got to find somewhere
I've got to find somewhere
I've got to find somewhere

Oh, is there a place for me?
Is there a place for me?
Somewhere?

Is there a place for me?
Is there a place for me?
Somewhere?

Is there a place for me?
Is there a place for me?
Somewhere?

Somewhere?
Somewhere?

I've got to find somewhere
I've got to find somewhere
I've got to find somewhere
I've got to find somewhere
Somewhere
