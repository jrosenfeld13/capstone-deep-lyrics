I hear the cottonwoods whisperin' above
"Tammy, Tammy, Tammy's in love"
The ole hooty-owl hooty-hoos to the dove
"Tammy, Tammy, Tammy's in love"

Does my lover feel what I feel
When he comes near?
My heart beats so joyfully
You'd think that he could hear

Wish I knew if he knew what I'm dreamin' of
"Tammy, Tammy, Tammy's in love"

Whippoorwill, whippoorwill, you and I know
Tammy, Tammy can't let him go
The breeze from the bayou keeps murmuring low
"Tammy, Tammy, you love him so"

When the night is warm, soft and warm
I long for his charms
I'd sing like a violin
If I were in his arms

Wish I knew if he knew what I'm dreaming of
"Tammy, Tammy, Tammy's in love"
