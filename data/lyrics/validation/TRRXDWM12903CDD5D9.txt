Monoliths of profound power
Legends of tradition and myths
Rise from the depths of the abyss

O monarchs of divine power
Living face of the ancestor
Rise from the depths of the abyss
Principals of sacred design
Immense leviathan of strength
Rise and grant us your purity

Statues of tradition and ancestry
Bless us with your spirit
Statues of tradition and ancestry
Guide us in your darkest hour

In spirit
We long for the heavens
As we aspire to be of the pure
In spirit
We search our souls
As we obtain the powers of mana
