You're six-foot two, a pure angel
The skulking butler for porno
This cherub wants you blindfold, prostrate
Latex wonder-bra

He's got a burning ambition
He'll give you the ammunition
Under some paper-thin guise
Flattered into living sunlight

Head in the clouds
Feels like a star
Swimming with pin-ups
Want to be where you are (x2)

The guys just want to get loaded
Between the pages of "Loaded"
The guys just want to get by
The guys just want to get by

The guys just want to get loaded
Pretend their not homophobic
Pretend there isn't a style
Make out the scene for miles

Head in the clouds
Feels like a star
Swimming with pin-ups
Want to be where you are (x2)

And he sighs, "Won't wanna know your name."
Hands and lips on loan
And he sighs, "Won't want to know your name."
Wear his skin and glow (glove)

Chorus (x4)
