I'm not afraid of being insane
Been here too long, and I've seen too much

I got messed up. Ooh, I got messed up
I got messed up. Ooh, I got messed up

My mamma is gone, and my daddy, too
Whatever I got, I got it myself

I got messed up. Ooh, I got messed up
I got messed up. Ooh, I got messed up

I've been so strong; tried for so long
Now everything is gone

I got messed up

Music

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

I got messed up. Ooh, I got messed up
I got messed up. Ooh, I got messed up
I got messed up. Ooh, I got messed up
I got messed up. Ooh, I got messed up
