Tornadoes spin me around
The rain beats on my face
Hurricanes ain't nothing, baby
A tidal wave can't quench my thirst
Don't you think that we all know
Your good looks pulled you through?
I'm just sittin' here, waitin' for Desiree
Drink of wine from a lovin' cup
Your face looks all messed up
I don't want to see you clear
I like your picture hard to read
I know I should get out
But my mind's already made up
I'm just sittin' here, waitin' for Desiree
I'm waitin' for Desiree
The news is bad enough
But it's the only station I can get
I turned the TV off
But you ain't come on yet
You lead a sheltered life
At least that's what I think
Anytime that I get up
Fix myself a drink
Your voice, come on, right now
And damn I missed you again
I'm just sittin' here, waitin' for Desiree
I'm just sittin' 'round, waitin' for Desiree
I'm just sittin' here, waitin' for Desiree
I'm waitin' for Desiree
