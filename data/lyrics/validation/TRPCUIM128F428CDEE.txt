Lurid maelstrom, ignite knowledge
Beyond al time
I have to come- to now collect all your souls
Come to me
I've come to give sight
Unspoken might
Severed, split - shearing until it divides
To revive
I have come to show you the light
Untangled coil
Life's spiral - plunging deep into the past
Abrogate
You seek endless life
To since - only to suffer in vain
Paralyze
Now entombed the rest of your life
On the cot, inject - new life into you
All that's sought, one chance
To take back the time that you lost
Wasting days, careless - then everything changed
No known ways, to cure
What's been laid out on the table
No more ways
So much pain
Endless days - slowly dying, always
Sleepless plight
Ends in sight
Cannot fight - stem cell harvest, last hope
In the labs - they're cloning new life
Barbed helix - that's rendered divine
Requisite - the cells will divide
Slowly bringing - new life
On the slab - infusing new blood
Life signs dead - replace the old parts
You now rise - rebuilt new again
Reborn in your - last day
Cells stored for - rebuilding
Flesh and bone
Organs for harvesting
Brand new souls
Still time will expire
Your new mould
Infinite
Exquisite
Sheering time
Cannot die
Life owed to - a science
Thankful - to all the efforts that conquered your very death
Now life seems - infinite
You can - rebuild yourself anytime now that you see fit
Life owed to - life's science
Now forced - to be prepared to re-conquer your every death
Though life seems - infinite
You must rebuild yourself for all time
