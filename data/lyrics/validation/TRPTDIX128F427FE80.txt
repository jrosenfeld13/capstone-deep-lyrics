I can hear the colours
Hear what they say
I can taste the sounds
Voice of the soul sings inside

Dreaming
All the time
Deep in slumber
The expression of the soul
In the dreaming zone
I shall find
Illusive minds never wake

I'm lost inside a dreaming lie
Never awake (awake)
I'm seeing through another's eyes as time goes on
(As Time goes on)
I've always known that when my daydream fades away
I never leave the cold that is the dreaming tide

I can taste while dreaming
Wish I could stay
Inside my head I just know
I've been lead astray

Dreaming
All the time
Deep in slumber
The expression of the soul
In the dreaming zone
I shall find
Illusive minds never wake

I'm lost inside a dreaming lie
Never awake (awake)
I'm seeing through another's eyes as time goes on
(As time goes on)
I've always known that when my daydream fades away
I never leave the cold that is the dreaming tide

Now I move on
To the subconscious states unknown
Dream world now gone, I am shown
Why I dream at night and on and on
Waking through my intuition, this path I must know

Dreaming
All the time
Deep in slumber
The expression of the soul
In the dreaming zone
I shall find
Illusive minds never wake

I'm lost inside a dreaming me
Never' awake (awake)
I'm seeing through another's eyes as time goes on
(As time goes on)
I've always known that when my daydream fades away
I never leave the cold that is the dreaming tide

Dreaming tide!
