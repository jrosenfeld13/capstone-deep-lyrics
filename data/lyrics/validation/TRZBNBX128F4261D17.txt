How long, how long has my Crow Jane treat me wrong?
So long, baby so long, baby, so long

I got to the station, she left town
I'm blue and disgusted and nobody been down
But hey, so long, baby, so long, baby, so long

How long, how long has my Crow Jane been so wrong?
So long, so long, baby, so long

I could holler like a jack2
I'd go to the mountain, call her back
How long, baby, how long, baby, how...?

How long, been so long, am I to be treated wrong?
How long, how long, baby, how long?

I got to the station, she left town
I couldn't hardly change her mind
How long, how long, baby, how long?

Aw, someday you'll be sorry you treated me wrong
It'll be too late, baby, and I'll be gone
So long, so long, baby, so long

So long, baby, so long, has my Crow Jane been gone?
How long, how long, baby, so long

How long, baby, how long has my Crow Jane been...
So long, so long, baby, so long

I was waitin' for the mail
Hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey
How long, so long, so long

How long, how long am I to call you girl-of-my-own?
How long, how long, how long?

How long, am I to be treated wrong?
So long, so long, so long

How long, baby, how long am I to be treated wrong?
How long, how long, baby, how long?
