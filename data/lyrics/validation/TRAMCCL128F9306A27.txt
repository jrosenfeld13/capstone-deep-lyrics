If your gonna save the day
And your hearing what i say
I feel your touch , your kiss
Is not enough
And if you believe in me
Dont think my loves for free
I won't take nothing less
Than a deeper love

(chorus)
Let me tell you , you
You know
IIIIIIIII, i need a miracle
I need a miracle
Its more than physical
What i need to feel from you

Tell me that you understand
And you take me as i am
Youll always be the one to give me everything
Just as i thought no-one cares
Your the answer to my prayers
You lift my spirits high
Come on and rescue me

Let me tell you , you
You know
IIIIIIII, i need a miracle
I need a miracle
Its more than physical
What i need to feel from you

Let me tell you , you
You know
IIIIIIII, i need a miracle
I need a miracle
Its more than physical
What i need to get me through

Heyyyyyy 
I need a miracle , i need a miracle
Ohhhhhh ohhhhhhh
I need a miracle , i need a miracle

Let me tell you , you
You know
IIIIIIII, i need a miracle
I need a miracle
Its more than physical
What i need to get me through

Let me tell you , you
You know
IIIIIIIII, i need a miracle
I need a miracle
Its more than physical
What i need to feel from you
