[Intro]
Hey!
Hey!

[Verse 1]
Hey, yeah, we had everything vinyl in mono
And we looked the other way man, we were so dumb
Is this the part in the book that you wrote
Where I gotta come and save the day
Did you miss me? Did you miss me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Well they say that rock is dead
And they're probably right
99 girls in the pit
Did it have to come to this?

[Chorus]
No, god you owe me one more song
So I can prove to you that
I'm so much better than him
No, god please, listen fast
Here comes the crash
We're gonna rise above
We're gotta smash it up
You won't abandon us again
Hey!

[Verse 2]
Give us brilliant boys that we wanna fuck, man
Full of ecstasy, hard drugs and bad luck
Yeah yeah yeah
Turn the lights back on
You burn so hard but you won't burn long

[Pre-Chorus]
Three chords in your pocket tonight
Are you, you the one
With the spark to bring my punk rock back
And I don't think so

[Chorus]
No, god, I wanna hear you say
I wanna hear you say that you're sorry again
Oh, god, you owe me one more song
So I could prove to you
That I'm so much better than them
No, god, I'd give you anything
To hear you say that I was right
And you were wrong
No, god, before I leave this life
Now an 8-ball isn't love
A hooker's never gonna cum
Just give it back to me
Blow out all of the lights tonight

[Bridge]
Two million miles down the PCH
(and now he's gone)
I slashed his tires, I bled his brakes
(it had to be done)
Their hand job lives were just too cruel
(You merciless villain)
We drowned them all in their swimming pools
Run away run away run away yeah

[Chorus]
Oh god I wanna hear you say
I wanna hear you say that you were wrong again
Oh god I wanna hear you say I wanna hear you say
That I am so much better than him
Oh god you owe us one more song
Get out my life, see this world as it really is
Is it just a sad side show
Can make a hooker cum
And an 8-ball isn't love
I need one thing that's divine
Let me hear it tonight
Let me hear it tonight
I've got to hear it tonight
You're gonna let me hear the lost chord tonight, yeah
