[Verse 1]
I lie awake hoping that I will hear
Your voice inside my ear
Telling me you're near
But I know I'll find my precious peace of mind
When you speak to me just in time
Let me know you still care

[Chorus]
There's power in His blood
Forgiveness in His hands
A peace in His love that we can't understand
There's joy in His spirit
There's power in His blood
Forgiveness in His hands
A peace in His love that we can't understand
There's joy in His spirit
Sufficient and full there's power in His blood
His love is all we need
There's joy in the spirit of the Lord

[Verse 2]
You are the One who has made me complete
Now I'm kneeling at Your feet
Knowing only You can lead me home
I'll stand through it all
Waiting on Your call
Knowing that You hear my every prayer

[Chorus]
There's power in His blood
Forgiveness in His hands
A peace in His love that we can't understand
There's joy in His spirit
There's power in His blood
Forgiveness in His hands
A peace in His love that we can't understand
There's joy in His spirit
Sufficient and full there's power in His blood
His love is all we need
There's joy in the spirit of the Lord

[Bridge]
I know there's strength
In His everlasting word
And I know I'll find all the love I need
In His arms

[Chorus]
There's power in His blood
Forgiveness in His hands
A peace in His love that we can't understand
There's joy in His spirit
There's power in His blood
Forgiveness in His hands
A peace in His love that we can't understand
There's joy in His spirit
Sufficient and full there's power in His blood
His love is all we need
There's joy in the spirit of the Lord
In the spirit of the Lord
