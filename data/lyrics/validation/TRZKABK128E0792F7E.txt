Seems like now days
Ain't nothin' meant to last
Well, one day you've got it all
And then it disappears so fast
And now our love
Is on and off again
Well, I know you wanna quit me, baby
Ah, but a quitter never wins
You've walked out on our lovin'
But I've stayed through thick and thin
After all that we've been through baby
You're gonna tell me it's the end
And now our love
Is on and off again
Well, I know you wanna quit me, baby
Ah, but a quitter never wins
Seems like now-a-days
Love is a word that no one means
Ah, ya said you'd never leave me
And then ya, upped and walked out on me
Oh, and now our love
Is on and off again
Well, I know you wanna quit me, baby
Yeah, but a quitter never wins
Well, I know you wanna quit me baby
But a quitter never wins
A quitter never wins
