We come Fe make the people dem just rock up
Now we come Fe mash it inna different style
Yer you know we come kill the tune just like a ninja
Busting up the place and turn the people dem wild
This is the sound of the band call Skindred
Calling every nation Fe jump as one
Come together in the pit and turn crazy
Then we grab the dollars from promoters and we run
Co Lord have mercy me say

Now we come in ah de place and we tear things up
We rock out the stage and the hwole place chock
Promoter and his idrin dem ah tan up and ah look
Every ting in addy place get mash up and broke
This is what the people dem ah want and we ah cook
The DJ starts to rock and the tune get stuck
The music his the crowd like a ten-ton truck
Everybody in the place they lift their hands and shout

This is what we want
We want the vibes just sweet and we don't want no negative

This is what we want
Crowd of people in the place lick a shot be co you know!

Rocking in the yard we nor go drop
Ghetto youth are running it hot
Slamming in the pit we nor go stop
Every youth man lick 4 shot
Unity is what we need a lot
Its like the worlds in a melting pot
To the youth we are give nuff props
From the bottom we are reaching to the top

Condensation it ah run from the walls and the ceiling
To the Punk and the Dread this sound is appealing
Anytime we come you know we bring a good feeling
Lyrics wha we write they got to have meaning
No check fee Babylon but hatred we no deal in
The way we mash the show we left the youth dem reeling
Spot light pon the Dred because the show that we stealing
From Brixton town down to New York dem feeling!
