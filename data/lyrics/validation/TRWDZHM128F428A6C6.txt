I remember only yesterday
Seems like not so long ago
Moving sideways on a shifting stage
Don't know where time seems to go

I watch myself turn away
All in a memory
Rewinding just a single page
Now it's all coming back to me...

There's a young man in an endless dream
Projecting through a world of sound
Fingers fly and then a silent scream
Always high above the ground

I'm living - this moment
Through all the years
Illusion - in my mind
Washing out the fears

One day I'll be far from here
A star beyond tomorrow
And distance beyond this sphere
Will lead me on!
