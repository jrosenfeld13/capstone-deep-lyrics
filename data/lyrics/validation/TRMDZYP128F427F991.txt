[Intro]
Let's break all the rules
Come on baby me and you
Baila, come on baby baila
Baila, come on baby baila
Baila, come on baby baila
Let's break all the rules
Come on baby me and you

[Verse 1]
You took my love to another level and
Boy, I'm so happy I don't have to settle
Nobody else but you because everything you do
Breaks all the rules

[Chorus]
Baila, come on baby baila
Let's break all the rules
Come on baby me and you
Baila, come on baby baila
I don't care what they say
Come on baby dance with me

[Verse 2]
Boy, you're my destiny
My final ecstasy
There's no higher place
That I could ever feel
A love so strong, so real
The way I feel with you
Breaks all the rules

[Chorus]
Baila, come on baby baila
Let's break all the rules
Come on baby me and you
Baila, come on baby baila
I don't care what they say
Come on baby dance with me
