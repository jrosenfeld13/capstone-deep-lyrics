They call, no date
I promised you I'd wait
I want them all to know
I'm strictly single old

I'll walk alone
Because, to tell you the truth, I'll be lonely
I don't mind being lonely
When my heart tells me you are lonely, too

I'll walk alone
They'll ask me why and I'll tell them I'd rather
There are dreams I must gather
Dreams we fashioned the night you held me tight

I'll always be near you wherever you are
Each night in every prayer
Just whisper, I'll hear you no matter where you are
So close your eyes and I'll be there

Please walk alone
But send your love and your kisses to guide me
Till you're walking beside me
I'll walk alone

Darling
All by myself
I'll walk alone
(Alone)
