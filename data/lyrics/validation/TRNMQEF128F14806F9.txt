[Chorus 1:]
Lord, we rejoice in the power of Your name
Lord, we rejoice in the power of Your name

We make a choice to voice our opinion
Your name is great
We proclaim Your dominion
Yesterday, today, and forever the same
We rejoice in the power of Your name

[Verse:]
Mountains tremble at the sound of that name
We assemble just to proclaim Jesus reigns

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2:]
Every knee must bow at the sound of that name
We lift a mighty shout just to proclaim
Jesus reigns, Jesus reigns

[Chorus 2:]
Lord, we rejoice in the power of Your name
Lord, we rejoice in the power of Your name

We make a choice to voice our opinion
Your name is great
We proclaim Your dominion...

[Vamp 1:]
Yesterday, today
And forever, forever

[Vamp 2:]
Forever the same
Lord, You never change

Forever the same
You never change

[Vamp 3:]
We rejoice in Your name
We rejoice the name of Jesus

[Vamp 4:]
The name of Jesus
The name of Jesus
The name of Jesus
The name of Jesus

[Ending:]
Yesterday, today, and forever the same
We rejoice in the power of Your name
