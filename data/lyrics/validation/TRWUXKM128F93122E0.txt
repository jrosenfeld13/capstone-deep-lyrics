Your love, it's got the Holy Ghost
A-shakin' in my bones
I never felt such a feelin'
In all the days I been round, yeah

Whenever I feel the pressure
Jah! I can't seem to hypnotize my mind
Well! Your love, it's got the Holy Ghost
And I feel like I've been born a second time

Hey! Hey!

Your love, it's got the Holy Ghost
The antidote that saved my soul
And no psycho could ever describe
This feeling that sucks my soul over

You put; a run in my walk
And you put; a tremble in my talk
And this feeling that I have within
Love, it makes me feel like I've been born again

Hey! Hey!

Well, I, yeah
Well, well, well
Well, I, yeah
Well, well, well

(Hold it!)
(Hold it!)
(Hold it!)

(Hold it!)
Yeah you put, a run in my walk
(Hold it!)
Girl you put, a tremble in my talk
(Hold it!)
Girl I'm feeling like I; never felt
(Hold it!)
Girl you ought to be ashamed of yourself

(Hold it!)
Yeah you got me, a-shakin' in my bones
(Hold it!)
I just can't leave your love alone
(Hold it!)
Girl you spin me
(Hold it!)
Well, well, well

(Hold it!)
(Hold it!)
(Hold it!)
