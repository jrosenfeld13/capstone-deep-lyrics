Without a question, I'll sell you no lies*
Our lives are suspended within all your bile
Your lies and deception regresses the mind
Clandestine decisions based on your ego
March on your ignorance, diminish our veto
Thirsting annihilation, hard cock libidos
Politically suppressed, historically denied
Building the enemy to sell us your lies
Selling the fucking lies, selling the lies to make you a hero
