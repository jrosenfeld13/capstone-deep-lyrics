On the wind, I feel the warmth, like the town where I was born
Blowin' down a two lane road, it rides just like the one back home
I close my eyes and then go back again
I hear a song on the radio, reminds me of someone I use to know
We'd stay up until the dawn, now that someone is gone
I close my eyes and then go back again
CH:
Time is a river, rollin' out to sea
I close my eyes and then go back again
Last night, I had a dream, about a place I'd never been
Shinin' sun on fields of gold, could be heaven for all I know
I close my eyes and then go back again
CH:
Time is a river, rollin' out to sea
I close my eyes and then go back again
I close my eyes and then go back again, and again
