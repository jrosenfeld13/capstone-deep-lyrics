[Verse 1]
You say you don't like the way we look
Well fuck off
I ain't some dying dog that you can kick
So fuck off
It's so easy to fall into that hole
And you're the one who cast me in that role

[Bridge]
If you loved me would you call me a social parasite
And who's the one to tell me whether it's wrong or right

[Verse 2 x3]
You say you don't like the place I live
Well get out
There ain't no vacancy in my bed
So get out
It's so easy to fall into that hole
And you're the one who cast me in that role

(1, 2, 3, go...)

[Verse 1]
You say you don't like the way we look
Well fuck off
I ain't some dying dog that you can kick
So fuck off
It's so easy to fall into that hole
And you're the one who cast me in that role

[Verse 2 x2]
You say you don't like the place I live
Well get out
There ain't no vacancy in my bed
So get out
It's so easy to fall into that hole
And you're the one who cast me in that role
