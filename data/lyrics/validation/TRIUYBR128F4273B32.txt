We're not always lucky enough
To find what we want in the dirt and the dust
You might find diamonds when I might find glass
In the dirt and the dust

And we're not always virtuous enough
To brush ourselves clean of the dirt and the dust
Once I found silver but then watched it rust
In the dirt and the dust

There's only one step between
Something just thought of and something that's already been
You can't position yourself like a dog on a shelf
Hoping someone might pick you up
And show you what you really need

So we trust in what we find in the dirt and the dust
If you want to make it then make you must from the dirt and the dust

Rarely are we smart enough to divide the water from beneath the hard crust
We keep on lowering buckets and we keep on drawing them out

There's only one step between
Something just thought of and something that's already been
You can't position yourself like a dog on a shelf
Hoping someone might pick you up
And show you what you really need

So we trust in what we find in the dirt and the dust
If you want to make it then make you must from the dirt and the dust

Now we trust in what we find in the dirt and the dust
If you want to make it then make you must from the dirt and the dust

Beneath the sky is just just a blanket
Thrown over us like a net
And every star is just a drop in the stitch
Proving we're not ready yet

Just a drop in the stitch proving we're not ready yet

Now we trust in what we find in the dirt and the dust
If you want to make it then make you must from the dirt and the dust
