She's lump, she's lump, she ain't got it
She's talking about regrets and I can't see them
Can't seem to follow through, what I had promised
I stumble upon regrets, me too, so instead....

I party with my pain
You don't seem to come around
With fluids in my brain
We seem to get along just fine
I party with my pain

She's drunk, comes home in the morning
I wonder where she's been
And I can feel it's burning in my chest
(No kiss), no smile no nothing
I'm longing for the time when I turn off and....

Party with my pain
I got fluids in my brain
You don't seem to come around
Fuckin up with strangers in strange towns

But you should know I never wanted to be in this ocean
Of not knowing what you will do
Hold it down, this foggy notion
Or take away all my skills

I crumble in my pain
When you don't seem to come around
No you don't seem to come around

A stamp, a letter, a mailbox, a hello and goodbye
Don't try to turn this into something good
There ain't no good about it
Do you dance under the stars? While I go out and....

Party with my pain
I got fluids in my brain
Cause you don't seem to come around
Fucking up with strangers in strange towns

You should know I never wanted to be in this ocean
Of not knowing what you will do
Hold it down, this foggy notion
Or take away all my skills

I party with my pain
You don't seem to come around
You don't seem to come around
