Do you think of me 'cause I
Always think of you, don't lie
Tell me what you see, so shy
Am I getting through to you?

I know you've been hurt before
You don't want the pain no more
That ain't what I came here for
Time to open up your door

If I could hold you in my arms you'd feel my love
If I could hold you in my arms tonight would be enough
If I could hold you in my arms you'd feel my love
If I could hold you in my arms tonight would be enough

Do you wanna leave or stay?

Am I standing in your way?
This is not a game I play
Listen to the words I say

I am here to fight for us
Help you through the night with love
Stars are shining bright above
I'll be here when times get rough

If I could hold you in my arms you'd feel my love
If I could hold you in my arms tonight would be enough
If I could hold you in my arms you'd feel my love
If I could hold you in my arms tonight would be enough
