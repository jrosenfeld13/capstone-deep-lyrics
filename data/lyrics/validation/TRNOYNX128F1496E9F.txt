Don't persecute a bee, let her work
On her masterpiece so unselfishly
Enjoy your life Enjoy the art
Cause drop of art is a sea of energy
We are flowers of various scents and colors
From depths of the same old earth
Thanks to water and air, we ascend...
Hey boy don't fly so high
Cause as high you are so small you are
For the other ones standing on the ground
Live your life not to be ashamed of
What you achieved or who you are
Find the magic in perfectly ordinary things
We are flowers of various scents and colors
From depths of the same old earth
Thanks to water and air we ascend...
Into this beautiful world
Where stars never fade
Into this beautiful world
Where sun never falls asleep
Time is for fun so run like hell
Straight ahead to the sun
