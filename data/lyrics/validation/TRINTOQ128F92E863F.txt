[Intro]

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you ever pretend
That we are more than friends?
Despite the metal and wires
I still have human desires

[Verse 1]
I'll wait here til the end
For my dividend
And when I turn off the lights
I'll wait here til the end

[Chorus]
Over and over she burns my circuits
I feel fire rushing through my wires
I can feel all the things that we can't share

[Verse 2]
When I hear your voice
It fills me with noise
Was this meant to be?
Are you corrupting me?

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't you just pretend
That we are more than friends?
Despite the metal and wires
I still have human desires

[Chorus]
Over and over she burns my circuits
I feel fire rushing through my wires
I can feel all the things that we can't share
Over and over she burns my circuits
I feel fire rushing through my wires
I can feel all the things that we can't share

[Verse 3]
The satellites connecting us, protecting us
Our makers have neglected us
It's not their fault
It's just the way

[Chorus]
Over and over she burns my circuits
I feel fire rushing through my wires
I can feel all the things that we can't share

[Outro]
La la la...
I can feel all the things that we can't share
