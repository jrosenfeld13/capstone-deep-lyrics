In the real dark night of the soul
It's always 3 a.m
It's always darkest before the dawn comes
It never dawned on me
At my weakest I'm pretending to be strong
Sometimes the demons are too hard to control

(Chorus)
In my darkest moment
Something takes me over makes me turn a cold shoulder
In my darkest moment
I need a revalation, divine illumination to come my way

Just when I thought I was me
It just wasn't me t-talkin'
And the last one that I'd ever wanna hurt
Stood right in my way
Hating is easy and loving takes real character
Love ain't in fashion in this hard stone cold hearted world

Chorus

(The pain, the grief, the agony...)

Chorus

Let some light come my way...
