The time of innocence, do you remember?
To push the limits of your consciousness
You closed your eyes and your mind too
Opened up the door to the other side
It occupies your time, fills the void within you
But happiness is just an illusion

The ghost of you, walking on a tightrope
The ghost of you, a war without an enemy
The ghost of you
Your fantasy is turning into insanity

With curtains closed you hide from the outside world
But you cannot hide from what's inside of you
It swallowed you whole and spat out the pieces
Now you're just waiting for salvation
It occupies your time, fills the void within you
But happiness is just an illusion

The ghost of you, walking on a tightrope
The ghost of you, a war without an enemy
The ghost of you
Your fantasy is turning into insanity

A cold wind blows inside your bones
A fall into oblivion with your angels and demons
You claim to be so far apart
Still it has claws around your heart
You got nothing else to fill the void with
Nothing else will replace the fantasy
When will we see the final nail in the coffin?
