Yeah yea

[Hook]

When i grab the microphone i get down like light speed
It was the single D double double D crew who
When i grab the microphone i tend to make kids bleed
It was the single D double double D crew who
When i grab the microphone i get biz for all my peeps
It was the single D double double D crew who
When i grab the microphone we win battles like steak sweeps
It was the Five D Mc's who rock the place with ease

[Verse 1 - Fat Jon]

New levels of life, lovely light you find on minds empty
Time to find drums and lace [?]
Relay simply the facts of love and hate
Raheem drops beams in 88
In 89, i rhymed on lines on school desks
Lab became the routine
Ahead of my time like ill stocks
How could the real ever stop
These MC's they say
Self preservations prioritized
Over time wasting
I rise like heat from the sun at 6 o clock
Surprise young minds, like pistol wip'ers from Glocks
My treatments be the shock
Electrocution you're losing your whole life force
In situations you be caught
Ass out, thats to see what your life's all about
Now the strong will survive
And the weak take dives
The slaves take lives
I'm taking files from FBI, makin'
Photocopies to give sight to the blind
For the deaf, i make beats to stretch like my breath
For the dumb, mic checks one time for ya mind
Do with it, what you will even if its, just recline
Tests for the soul with high stakes for the balance
Why waste talent, if its already written to be liven
This life of astrological travel and intuition
In addition, I'm wishin' more than heads would listen
Probably over-D'n on pills when i rock my shit

[Hook]

When i grab the microphone the crowd gets buckwild
It was the single D double double D crew who
When i grab the microphone i catch you sleeping like child
It was the single D double double D crew who
And when i grab the microphone i get biz like markie
It was the single D double double D crew who
When i grab the microphone i rock for props not for free
Be the Five D Mc's who make cuts like surgery

[Verse 2 - Pase Rock]

Lets put it together
Over the rain and the stormy weather
Rock forever cause they never hear of them
They tried to murder them
Outta nowhere, see the smoke and the sparks
Flames in the dark, beats in the park
Cars bangin' , the rhymes hangin' sucka MC's
With styles lyrics and degrees from college
Five Deez bring the knowledge of life
From wisdom understands and the rhythm to give em the truth and rock
Over the top, hip-hop, fucking the cops in the anus
Cause they hate us, they can cut with the faders
Eating on a 12 hundred turntables
Wasn't able to survive in my dimension
Didn't listen so they die
A death blow and pain taking ya breath slow
Let go of ya previous out-look
Cause we about to flip the script and rip
Like ya neva' knew, take ya revenue
From the heavens a crew with 7's all up in the mix so bust this
Loving the lust wishing the trust could be [?]
Before ya eyes close, and when no longer comes out ya nose
Cause blood flows thats how it goes when ya fucking with pro's
Its like that y'all, Five Deez worldwide
And when i rock the microphone these kids step to the side

[Hook]

When i grab the microphone i refresh like iced tea
It was the single D double double D crew who
And when i grab the microphone nobody rhyme like me
It was the single D double double D crew who
When i grab the microphone i combat like tai chi
It was the single D double double D crew who
And when i grab the microphone i give kids lobotomies
It was the Five D Mc's 3 mikes like trinity

[Verse 3 - Kyle]

I stay precise on swiss army
My time is [?] nice
We must plan concise
Progressive moves
Till all digest these grooves
If most niggas could sit for a half a sec'
I guarantee they ears get wet
Wetter than vets left standing at charlies checkpoint
Check charlie with this next joint
Kick yo ass like [?]
Like minds trained for games, for losers
Sock you in face with word placement of choice
Opinions get voiced, [facts?] get amplified
The type on pad and L leaves paper moist
You catch [peef?] like [twist me?]
Descend with subterranean men
And reappear like stress next year
What you hear is what we know
Never been backbone
Pro's status, on back burners
Rhymes [media?] types like [turner?]
No vandals who pick up on other channels
Pack burners with solid (?) and flannels
Got niggas blew out like candles
