It's such a beautiful night
It's cold as hell the wind smells like disaster
The moon is full of gravity pulls the plaster off my
Face
Finally, I go up to an aster
Faster than even the wind
I fly
On such a beautiful night
The sky is empty with everything inside it
Outside it's such a beautiful night inside
It's such a beautiful night outside
It's such a beautiful night
Inside of the bellies of a heifer
It's such a beautiful night
It's cold as hell the wind smells like disaster
The moon is full of gravity pulls the plaster off my
Face
It feels good, the wind on my face
Disaster's a welcome change
