Channels, missing, fathoms below zero
Don't attempt to be a hero
But you boldly go into effects of the channel missing
Your life is missing what I impale [?]
Over seas never sought my man
Don't attempt to trail my trail yet, you can't understand
Twenty thousand words all abound, oh
You still want to venture on, then venture into this song
Come come come, into the typhoon
Use the force, Luke!
No, I'll use the source
To eliminate and obliterate at a rate of acceleration
Generation a nation cell
Oh well, they got us living in his hell
Fighting for freedom, oh what a deja vu?
Hell and back, go on a trip
Scratch the record until it skips to my King Lu
Learn the words that salvation will bring you
I am the sun, I am music to the fifteenth parallel
With main the come a joy, the room might consume, annoy me
When you drilling, scratching through the enamel
In fascination and and a desperation for the missing channel

Tune from the missing channel
This is a tune from the missing channel
Tune from the missing channel
This is a tune from the missing channel
Tune from the missing channel
This is a tune from the missing channel
Tune from the missing channel
This is a tune from the missing channel

Whispered secrets of a shattered age
I summon you, to renew this sage and age
Before a riot starts
Before the record charts
Rearrange the dumb from the humdrum
Dance to the drum
Come and get some!
Or bob your head, dread, as I numb the brain, son
By what use, by what crawls
By what does not. [?]
Then all [?] recede and rot
I'm gonna ask you a question
To see if you know the time, rhyme
No competition now
Who comes from the missing channel, and
Who attacks the wack, subliminal?
And if you said Dream Warriors, you get a cigar
And if you said someone else, Imma light your fart
And now we caught a squirrel, looking through a barrel
In search for a nut, but what he found was a

Tune from the missing channel
This is a tune from the missing channel
Tune from the missing channel
This is a tune from the missing channel
Tune from the missing channel
This is a tune from the missing channel
Tune from the missing channel
This is a tune from the missing channel

Oh, [?] start deck dumb fail
Touch on before with that frost-fingered fear
But this is just like the missing link
The more you think, the more you might shrink
Men with knowledge made megahertz
But still can't catch this tune on Earth
You might think it's magic, or sleight of hand
Even when your brain is so hard to understand
Picture my face with an open mind
Not a soul would know, or can find you
King's so far from reality
I don't even know how you made it through
But behold, and hold on to your sanity
You don't even know what you're into, do you?
This is life on the other side
You try to run, but you cannot hide
Too far gone, I can't hold on to you
Curiosity's got the best of you
Watch your step, the lights are flashing red
The level's peaked and he's brain-dead
Skin deep, to the phone is the tune
You're left all alone in the room, with the sync tone
Coma, the dream as they bring you to the limit
Drama, watch your step, for I am it
Prophets of breaks, the silence, we dismantle
There's room in the tomb of doom
For the missing channel
Boom
