[Baby Bash]
Hoes get chopped
Hoes get laced
Ho get a donkey dick in yo face
With no disgrace
I keep my boots on lace
And make a bitch clean up the whole damn place
Start in the kitchen
Do them dishes
Taste these nuts hoe
They so delicious
In the bathroom scrubbin tubs
And dont even think about hittin the club
Let yo girlfriends go
With all that drama
Bitch im your daddy and yo mamma
Baby beesh
Baby bash
I gotta beezy in Lake Camanche
Goin hard on a bitch is all i know
Ask that boy Dre and tony franko
Wako say ho
Crank that thang ho
I wish a bitch would ask me to be faithful
(haha) it ain't no chance
And ima keep doin the dummest dance
(haha) it ain't no chance
And ima keep the stupidest dance
(the miami hoe)

Chop that hoe man
Break that beezy
Chop that hoe man
Break that beezy
Chop that hoe man
Break that beezy
Chop that hoe man
Break that beezy

I wish I would make that bed
I ain't doin shit till you give me some head
Or jack me off
Till my dick gets harder
As soon as i nut
Go and warm my water
Let a playa soak while you go get greasy
I want ham and eggs over easy (sunnyside up)
Bombay and some welch's grapes
Dont try to run hoe theres no escape
Last night you was real excited
But now im kinda feelin uninvited
You dont like it that i called you a hoe
I put yo air conditioner on sixty four
Whats fucked up is that its gonna get worse
So bitch give me everything in yo purse
I want check books, credit cards, and skrilla scratch
If she ain't got no bread ima kill tha batch

Chop that hoe man
Break that beezey
Chop that hoe man
Break that beezey
Chop that hoe man
Break that beezey
Chop that hoe man
Break that beezey

[Mac Dre]
Once upon a starry night
He went to the lot and bought a car he liked
It was A-O-B all on baby
20's all around how you call on thay
I dont know no algebra
But I know how to get dough outa her
Mathamatics, man calculate
Lets count all the tricks she about to date
Vellagios, venicians, chinese, white, and valesians
Carpet waters
Pocket starters
Fully hand guns
And rocket launchers
Cuz pimpin' ain't nothin but a side job
If I ain't doin that nigga I mob
You can ipod
Or mp3
Rub the lamp you might see the genie


Chop that hoe man
Break that beezey
Chop that hoe man
Break that beezey
Chop that hoe man
Break that beezey
Chop that hoe man
Break that beezey
