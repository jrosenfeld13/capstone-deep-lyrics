I never thought you would lose yourself
The hardest part was falling down again
(Have you had enough yet?)
I'm a fool to watch you walk away
Are you bothered by the choice you made?

When we fall to the ground
Slowly we're safe and sound

It's so simple to be afraid
It's so simple when you know who you are
It's so simple to be afraid
It's so simple when you know who you are

I caught you lying to yourself
Now everything is speeding 'round and around
(They take us to the ground)
Well I'm a fool to watch but never say
Are you bothered by the choice you made?

When we fall to the ground
Slowly we're safe and sound

It's so simple to be afraid
It's so simple when you know who you are
It's so simple to be afraid
It's so simple when you know who you are

But maybe we were wrong..
When will you know
That you can feel belonged
I think you fell in deeper than you imagined

It's so simple to be afraid
(It's so simple)
It's so simple when you know who you are

It's so simple to be afraid
(It's so simple)
It's so simple when you know who you are
