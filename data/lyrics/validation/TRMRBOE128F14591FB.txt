A Chinese Whisper's going around town
Everybody knows
That you took my love and rubbed it in the intimacy
Shared by you both, well
A cold relevation's raising the rool
Naturally i was kept from the truth
Oh but now I'm sure

Of my hearts disgrace
And the loss of face
You threw it all away
Now I just want to say

What do you want oh
To hurt me for
With your soul destruction
And when you're given a love
And you break it up
That is soul destruction
You make a ghetto for my soul

So there you are with your head in your hands boy
What do you want to say
That it's me you really want
Those other girls don't mean a lot
It just sort of happened that way...well
I got some news are you listening now boy
My life is not a game
Love is not a toy

What do you want oh
To hurt me for
With your soul destruction
And if you're given a love
And you break it up
That is soul destruction
You make a ghetto for my soul

You have no idea
What I'm going through
You see all my belief, it's been blown away
'Cause you see, I thought I knew you

Na na na na hey yeah
Na na na na hey yeah
Na na na na hey yeah
Na na na na hey yeah
Na na na na hey yeah
Na na na na hey yeah

What do you want oh
To hurt me for
With your soul destruction
And when you're given a love
And you break it up
That is soul destruction
Don't make a soul ghetto

What do you want oh
To hurt me for
With your soul destruction
And when you're given a love
Oh you break it up
That is soul destruction
Na na na na hey yeah

What do you want oh
What do you want oh
Hurt me for
Soul destruction
And when you're given a love
You break it up
That is soul destruction
Na na na na hey yeah
