Action screams like screaming blue murder
Action screams when there's something to say
Action screams when there's no words to tell it
Action screams when you're fading away
When you're fading away

Come on let me show you just what we're gonna do
We're all screaming blue murder, screaming blue murder

All those times you thought it would happen
All those lies spinning round in your head
All those times you thought it would kill you
All their lies will tear them to shreds
We'll tear them to shreds

If you were me you'd be
Screaming blue murder, screaming blue murder

Action screams but nobody listened
Action screams, when I wanted it all
Action screams, now I'm screaming blue murder
Action screams, and they don't count at all
And they don't count at all

Come on let me show you just what we're gonna do
We're all screaming blue murder, screaming blue murder
We're all screaming blue murder, screaming blue murder
