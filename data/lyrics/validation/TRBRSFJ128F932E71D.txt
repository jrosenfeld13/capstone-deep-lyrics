Here and now, we are alone
Time she will hold her breath
Only the worms and angels
Know our names
But they have not found us
Although they surround us
I see the distance closing
Come along
For you and I know
We've lived through the centuries
We've ridden the darkest horses
All our lives we've hunted our enemies
We've fought with the fallacy
It's time we were all gods children
Far away the galaxies soar
The stars are exploding
Still I wish we could fly away, fly away
Here and now
For you and I know
That true love is deathless
These crumbling days are ending
By my side
We'll walk in the garden
We'll sleep in the ivy
We be with the worms and angels
