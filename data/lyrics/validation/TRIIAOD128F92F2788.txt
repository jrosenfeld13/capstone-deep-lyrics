We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?

We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams on suspicious minds

So, if an old friend I know
Drops by to say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?
Here we go again
Asking where I've been
You can't see these tears are real I'm crying

We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams on suspicious minds

Oh let our love survive
Or dry the tears from your eyes
Just don't let a good thing die
And honey you know you know
I've never lied to you
Mmmmm

We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe the word I say

We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams on suspicious minds

We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because i love you too much baby
Because i love you too much baby
Because i love you too much baby
