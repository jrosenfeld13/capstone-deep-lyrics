Oh Shenandoah I long to see you away you rolling river
Oh Shenandoah I long to see you
Away I'm bound the way cross the wide Missouri
Oh Shenandoah I love your daughter away you rolling river
Oh Shenandoah I love your daughter
Away I'm bound the way cross the wide Missouri
( guitar )
For seven long years I've been a wandering away you rolling river
Seven long years I've been a wandering
Away I'm bound the way cross the wide Missouri
Away I'm bound the way cross the wide Missouri
