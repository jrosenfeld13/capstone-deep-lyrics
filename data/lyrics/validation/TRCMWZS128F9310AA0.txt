I steal the night away
Driving my life away, dancing
I was a Romeo
I knew the art of romancing
I was just an average guy, in a world of empty dreams
I needed someone to show me how to love

Juliet
Oh, Juliet
The night was magic when we first met
Juliet
Oh, Juliet
You know you taught me to fly
You take me clear to the sky
And all the people around the world can stand aside
For me and my baby
J-J-J-Juliet

Fighting with destiny
Fortune and fame, but kept losing
Playing a joker's game
Only myself I was fooling
I was an average guy in a world of empty dreams
You've broken down all the walls with your love

J-J-J-Juliet
Oh, Juliet
This kind of loving you don't forget
Juliet
Oh, Juliet
You know you taught me to fly
You take me clear to the sky
And all the people around the world can stand aside

Close your eyes, Juliet
Don't let go
On and on, our love is like the sun
It keeps on going strong throughout eternity

I wanna love you in my life
Sweet Juliet
Living without love in my life
My girl Juliet

J-J-J-Juliet
Oh, Juliet
This kind of loving you don't forget
Juliet
Oh, Juliet
You know you taught me to fly
You take me clear to the sky
And all the people around the world can stand aside

Juliet
Oh, Juliet
This kind of loving you don't forget
Juliet
Oh, Juliet
Ooh

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Juliet
Oh, Juliet
This kind of loving you don't forget
Juliet
