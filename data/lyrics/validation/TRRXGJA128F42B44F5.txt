[Verse 1]
Nothing more
Nothing less
An icon on the wall
Decoration and duress
That which many
Strive to be
It's the marble statue
Staring over me
And nobody has the will to tear it down
It determines wrong and right
But to me it's just a stereotype
And it makes us lose our sight

[Chorus]
The Portrait of Authority
Portrait of Authority
You tell me that's what I'm supposed to be
Portrait of Authority
You tell me that's what I'm supposed to be!

[Verse 2]
Another time
Another man
An oppressive intrusion
And a plague across his land
And it haunts
Him every day
It tells him he has no chance
His hopes just fade away
And he lives his life prepared to tear it down
But he can't muster the support
And to him it's just a stereotype
Of his life-long fight

[Chorus]
The Portrait of Authority
Portrait of Authority
It embodies what he cannot be
Portrait of Authority
It's what he cannot be!
The Portrait of Authority!
Portrait of Authority
