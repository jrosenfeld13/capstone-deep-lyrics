[Verse]
Hello darling
Surprised?
Yes, it's me again
I have just returned from the island of chandelier
What am i doing in town?
Well, i'm glad you asked
I'm just passing through in search of the ever elusive thunderbird
I got a job as a public relations man
Passing out handbills on austin street
Merely an effort to improve my financial situation
And ward off a case of the d.T.'s
So farewell, my darling
Perhaps we'll meet again
On some sin-infested street corner in houston texas
