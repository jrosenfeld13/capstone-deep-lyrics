No one to talk with, all by myself
No one to walk with but I'm happy on the shelf
Ain't misbehavin', savin' my love for you

I know for certain the one I love
I'm through with flirtin', it's you that I'm dreamin' of
Ain't misbehavin', savin' my love for you

Like Jack Horner in the corner
Don't go nowhere, what do I care?
Your kisses are worth waitin' for, believe me

Don't stay out late, no place to go
I'm home about eight, just me and my radio
Ain't misbehavin', savin' my love for you

(instrumental break)

Like Jack Horner in the corner
Don't go nowhere, what do I care?
Your kisses are worth waitin' for, believe me

Don't stay out late, no place to go
I'm home about eight, just me and my radio
Ain't misbehavin', savin' my love for you
All my love
