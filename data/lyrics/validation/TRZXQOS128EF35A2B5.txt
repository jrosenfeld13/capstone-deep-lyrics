Curtis

I'm just sitting here reminiscing
Wondering who you've been kissing, baby, oh oh, baby
I've been wandering all around
There must be a new guy in town, you don't love me anymore
I'll get over you, baby, although my heart's still sore
You know my heart's still sore

Well, I think of all the lies you told
You're a junkman, my heart you sold, you're a cheater and a mean mistreater
When I think of all the fun we had
Kind of makes me feel so sad and I'm lonely for your love
And as long as I live, oh, it's only you I'll be thinking of
It's you I'm thinking of
It's you I'm thinking of
