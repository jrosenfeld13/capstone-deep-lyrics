Skies who dwell into the aethyrs
Are all powerful into the earth
They execute the crisis of him
They serve the will they follow the will of them

Here / is / the face / of your god
Rule of the blessing / lord of the skies
Reign / the earth / with power / of / respect
Reign / the earth / agreed / with his wish

Let the earth be reigned from its parts
Let the vision rise its glory up
In its route in route with the skies
And as servant let them serve without lies

Ohh / you / skies / raise upon
Inferior skies / lower skies
Command the ruling / command the forceful
Destroy / those who fall / those who go down

Creatures of earth or man let outrage
The one another with darkness
Opus of mankind let extinct
Its creation cares for beasts

The call of the thirty aethyrs
Born with those that compound
The call of the thirty aethyrs
Destroy all those branded around
The call of the thirty aethyrs
Let no land remain the same as was found
The call of the thirty aethyrs
Add and withdraw till only stones you count

Born with those that compound
Destroy all those branded around
Let no land remain the same as was found
Add and withdraw till only stones you count
Move and appear in front of his words
For that swore with us to his justice
(Make us) mystics to the knowledge of procreation
Crowned in a land of abomination

(CHORUS)
Let the earth be familiar be strange
Let the earth be the locus of pain
Let the earth be the cradle of the whore
Let the earth be the place of those who fall
