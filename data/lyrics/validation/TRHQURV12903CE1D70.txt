I would walk across burning desert
Bearing water to quench your thirst
Just call my name
In the time it takes to think of me
I will be there by your side
I'll be there
Call my name

Give me your hand
And I'll take you somewhere so beautiful
Give me your dreams
Together we'll make them come true
Give me the pieces
Of your heart when it's broken
I'll mend it
For you

I will carry you when you're weary
When your faith is running low
Just rest in me
I'll be there for you just believe it
Any hour any day
I'll be there
Rest in me

Give me your hand
And I'll take you somewhere so beautiful
Give me your dreams
Together we'll make them come true
Give me the pieces
Of your heart when it's broken
I'll mend it
I'll mend it
Oh I'll mend it
For you
