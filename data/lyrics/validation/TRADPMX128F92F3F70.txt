My my my
Look at all the faces
There ain't nobody
Feelin' outta place here
'Cause they're movin'
And they're groovin'
And it sure looks good to me
Excusez moi mon cherie
Make way for my baby and me

Well everybody
Havin' such a good time
Well my my baby
I just spent my last dime
Well that's okay
'cause I'm havin' fun
I'm gonna stay till the night is done
Excusez moi mon cherie
Make way for my baby and me

Well don't you fight it just feel it
When your baby takes you out on the floor
Everybody is out a reelin'
Steamin' and out to roll

Well you don't have to worry
About the latest dance craze
Just get up on the floor
Shake your hips and move your legs
'cause when the band starts with that groove
You know you just can't help but move
Excusez moi mon cherie
Make way for my baby and me

And when the band starts with that groove
You know you just can't help but move
Excusez moi mon cherie
Make way for my baby and me
