From the album YEAR OF SUNDAY (1972)

On a crisp as bacon morning with the sunshine on my head
From the twilight of the dawning raised myself up from my bed
Fixed mine eyes upon a favor like no mortal eye behold
Then I chose to taste the flavor of the ancient of the old

On a chill as winter evening in a doubtful circumstance
He stopped the evil breathing of a one time's serpent's chance
Old black sea with silver lining how I long with all my soul
To quaff the mystic fragrance of the ancient of the old

From a red as amber burning with a chalice in my hand
I know there is no turning I must now obey command
At last decree has destined now the mystery untold
Will shine in all its glory from the ancient of the old
