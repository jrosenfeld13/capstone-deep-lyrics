Dip my quill in blood ink
Write it down in red
Scribe the words "Happy Meal"
Right across your head

Tired of getting walked on
Treated like a sheep
Don't blame me for all the years
That you were asleep

Relax
God is in control
Watch the dot
Take your meds
Obey my demands
Trust my dog
Time for surgery

Relax
God is in control
Watch the dot
Take your meds
Obey my demands
Trust my dog
Shut your eyes you're dead

Televised mass poison
Spitting at the screen
Keep the masses deluded
With fabricated dreams

Powdered God in a bag
From the Vatican
I want you to fuck off
As hard as you can

Relax
God is in control
Watch the dot
Take your meds
Obey my demands
Trust my dog
Time for surgery

Relax
God is in control
Watch the dot
Take your meds
Obey my demands
Trust my dog
Shut your eyes you're dead

Heaven has burst open
Now it's raining bones
The chaos will erode you
Breeding little clones

Born of a fallen rib
From the monkey's womb
Overcooked by cathode rays
Evolved to consume

100% (fucked)

Eating from the butcher's slab
Becoming what they meet
Restrained and roasted while they gorge
Strapped into the seat

Bathing in your arrogance
Dining will ensue
God made me a cannibal
To fix problems like you

Relax
God is in control
Watch the dot
Take your meds
Obey my demands
Trust my dog
Time for surgery

Relax
God is in control
Watch the dot
Take your meds
Obey my demands
Trust my dog
Shut your eyes you're dead

Last time was the last time
This time, you're 100% (fucked)
