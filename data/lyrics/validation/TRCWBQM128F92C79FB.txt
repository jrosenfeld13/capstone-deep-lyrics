Hard to tell
Or recognize a sign
To see me through
A warning sign

First the thunder
Then the storm
Torn asunder
In the storm

Satisfied
If the past, it will not lie
The future, you and I
Get blown away

In a lifetime
In a lifetime

And as the rain, it falls
Heavy in my heart
Believe the light
In you

Begin again
As the storm breaks through
So the light shines
In you
Without color, faded and worn

Torn asunder in the storm

Unless the sound
Save your body's soul
Unless it disappears

First the thunder
Then the storm
Torn asunder
In the storm

Selfish storm
Cold on the inside
One life
In the storm

In a lifetime...
