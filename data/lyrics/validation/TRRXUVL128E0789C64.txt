Little swallow in the sky
I want to entice you with a robin
I will give you all my sweets
A comic book, a clock that sings
If you will let me have your lovely wings

Little airplane above the clouds
I will shoot you down with gun and bow and arrow
So come down to my front lawn
Right away with all your things
And let me take away your mighty wings

Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
He wants to be in love
He wants to be a butterfly
And he is flying high like the birds into the sky
He wants to be in love
He wants to fly
He wants to be in love
He wants to fly

Little angel in the sky
I saw you in my dreams today
You're rejoicing admidst the harps
And all the bells and all the singing
If I am good tomorrow will you let me have your wings

Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
He wants to be in love
He wants to be a butterfly
And he is flying high like the birds into the sky

He wants to be in love, he wants to fly
He wants to be in love, he wants to fly
He wants to be in love, he wants to fly
He wants to be in love, he wants to fly
He wants to be in love, he wants to fly
He wants to be in love, he wants to fly
