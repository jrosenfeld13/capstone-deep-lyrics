When all the lights in my mind start to realise your name
I can see the world map on like a beautiful dream
But I've never been in the task, my memory's so far away
Though I hope someday, you'll come and you'll hear what I say

It's not a big thing to ask if you'll come to me tonight
You should be the lonely one, and maybe then you'd see
Well every time I hear your name I can't expect to keep control
You made me feel so bad, oh I wanna go free

The pleasure is mine and always will be
Never before have I felt this way
The pleasure is mine and always will be
I need your loving every day

When all the lights in my mind start to realise your name
I can see the world map on like a beautiful dream
But I've never been in the task, my memory's so far away
You made me feel so bad, oh I wanna go free
