Drift within
This is your body
Can you control
The fire blood
Through each tissued corridor drown
Into the pulse of life
[can't drown into the pulse of life]
Let your heart pump you
Out old red tongue
[can you drink the blood?
Can you drink the blood?
Tell us what's the red tongue]
A stream
Into it's own chamber
[can you let your heart become central]
Help help
I'm drowning
Into the lake help help I'm drowning
Get me out of here
Drift to the center
Drift to the center
I'm drowning
I need some help
The center of this heart fire will go up
Let your heart beat your whole life
[alleviate] [screw] [penatrate] [you ll go deeper]
Burst
[burst]
Greet on
[greet on]
Complete death
[communicate]
My blood life
Blood
Startling
Oh you just wish I could feel that way too
I'll bet you will someday
Help help
I'm drowning
Get me out of here
