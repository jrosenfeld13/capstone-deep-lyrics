This is Discotronic

I got a secret I can't keep
That builds inside when I'm in my sleep
I try to hide from the memory
But you come back and it's haunting me

What will I find in this fantasy?
If I go with you now, will you set me free?

Whoa
And I surrender
To the spirit of the night
I surrender (I surrender)

The darkness is my lover
And life's a pleasure (whoa)
So, I surrender to the spirit of the night
I surrender to the spirit of the night
I surrender (I surrender)

The darkness is my lover
And life's a pleasure (whoa)
So, I surrender to the spirit of the night

Entering new level [4x]
Ent- [?x]
This is Discotronic

I take cover from the light of day
That you people live in all day
I don't remember where I have been
But you come back to me in my dreams

What will I find in this fantasy?
If I go with you now, will you set me free?

Whoa
And I surrender
To the spirit of the night
I surrender (I surrender)

The darkness is my lover
And life's a pleasure (whoa)
So, I surrender to the spirit of the night

Surrender
Ohhhhhh!

I'm going crazy when the sun goes down
And it takes control as I hit the town
I give my body to the heat of the night
And acknowledge as you get strong all night

And I surrender
To the spirit of the night
I surrender (I surrender)

The darkness is my lover
And life's a pleasure (whoa)
So, I surrender to the spirit of the night
I surrender to the spirit of the night
I surrender (I surrender)

The darkness is my lover
And life's a pleasure (whoa)
So, I surrender to the spirit of the night
