Verse 1:
He brought me through hard trials
He brought me through tribulations
Never let a day go by and not realize
Had not been for the Lord who was on my side
Back was against the wall
He looked out for me
He heard my cry and rescued me
Never let a day go by and not realize we are blessed

Chorus:
Don't take it for granted that we are here today
Just know that we're blessed and highly favored
Just know that we're blessed and highly favored

Chorus

Bridge:
As I look back through the years
It's amazing how He kept me
What the devil mean't for evil
God turned it around
Turned it around just for my good
I know that I am blessed and highly favored
Just know that we're blessed and highly favored
Vamp 1:
It coulda' been me
It shoulda' been me
It woulda' been me if it wasn't for the blood
Vamp 2:
Grace, mercy
Grace, mercy
Ending:
Just know that we're blessed and highly favored
Just know that we're blessed and highly favored
