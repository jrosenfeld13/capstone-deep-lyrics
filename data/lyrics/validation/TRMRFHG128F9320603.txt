I'll keep on dreaming until my dreams come true
Until these arms of mine surround you all the time
I'll keep on dreaming until my dreams come true
Until your heart can see what burns inside of me
I'll keep on dreaming until my dreams come true
Every day I cry a lonely tear a tear of love especially just for you
Until my fantasy becomes reality I'll keep on dreaming until my dreams come true
[ ac.guitar ]
Every day I cry a lonely tear...
