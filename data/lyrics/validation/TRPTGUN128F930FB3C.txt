Selfish and stoned
I go through life with hazy eyes
And I gotta crazy idea for a new art project
That I will never do
I'm hung up on what's new

So let the dim light shine
Over my eyes
Let me eminate the dim light
Of an overcast day
In the bleakest of springtime

That I will never change
That I am not changin'
So let the day pass by
Over my eyes

When suddenly I wake up in the present time
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
So what am I gonna do?
I'm hung up on leavin' you
