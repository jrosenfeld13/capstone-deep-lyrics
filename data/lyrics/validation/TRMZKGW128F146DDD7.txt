You sink your teeth in bite the blood
That drains the life inside of me and
Fills your soul with love and hate and
All those things you need to breathe
My body dies but still my soul remains eternally
In search of Caspian waves and shallow graves explain why me?

This nightmare won't last long
Are you Scared?
So sing this song
I'm right there by your side
Tonight we've got a chance

I watched the sky bleed grey
With see through shades of violent bloody stains
And felt the evil prime and wicked
Start a course straight through my veins
I'm so alive, my skin so cold and fake
I close my eyes I know that now's the time
To take my chance with death and realize

Sunrise, sunset will you wash away the rain
Sunrise, sunset can you wash away the pain

This nightmare won't last long
Are you Scared?
So sing this song
I'm right there by your side
Tonight we've got a chance

This nightmare won't last long
Are you Scared?
So sing this song
I'm right there by your side
Tonight we've got a chance

So mute and beautiful to me
A promise kept on high
An angelic look at life
Through open eyes
Don't be scared we'll make it work
We're right on time don't make things worse
Now I'm right there by your side

(Sunrise) I will avenge
(Sunset) I can't pretend
(Sunrise) I won't forget this vein
(Sunset) attempt and promise kept
Just one more night to make up for the loss
Of love and time here comes the sun to
Rid this world of see through blood and swollen light

Sunrise, sunset will you wash away the rain
Sunrise, sunset can you wash away the pain

This nightmare won't last long
Are you Scared?
So sing this song
I'm right there by your side
Tonight we've got a chance

This nightmare won't last long
Are you Scared?
So sing this song
I'm right there by your side
Tonight we've got a chance
The sunrise..
The Last Sunrise
The sunrise..
The Last Sunrise
