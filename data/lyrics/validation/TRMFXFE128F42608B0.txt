Tiger, tiger
There are some things
I dream about
In the bushes
Hidden kisses
You turn around
And I see you
Wearing something
Striped in black

Well live
Just like a tiger
And do what we want when we do
Well love
And then our dreams of the kill will come true

Winds of passion
This is something
I've dreamed about
And tonight I'm
Gonna tell you
What I've cried about
Deep inside me
There is something burning bright for you
Tiger, tiger
In the bushes
Gonna wait for you

And then well love
Just like a tiger!
Our friends they will call on the phone
And well long
For what the jungle has taken away

Well love
Just like a tiger
And do what we want when we do
Well fight
And then our dreams of the kill will come true
