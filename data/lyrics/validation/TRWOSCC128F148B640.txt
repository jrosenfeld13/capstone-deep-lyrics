Nothing you can say
Can tear me away from my guy
Nothing you can do cause
I'm stuck like a glue to my guy

I'm sticking to my guy
Like a stamp to a letter
Like birds of a feather
We stick together
I'm telling you from the start
I won't be torn apart from my guy

Nothing you can do
Could make me untrue to my guy
Nothing you can buy
Can make me tell a lie to my guy

I gave my guy my word of honor
To be faithful
And I'm gonna
You best be believing
I won't be deceiving my guy

As a matter of opinion
I think hes tops
My opinion is
He's the cream of the crop

As a matter of taste
To be exact
He's ideal as a matter of fact

No muscle-bound man could ever
Take my hand from my guy
No handsome face could ever
Take the place of my guy

He may not be a movie star
But when it comes to being happy we are
There's not a man today
Who could take me away from my guy
