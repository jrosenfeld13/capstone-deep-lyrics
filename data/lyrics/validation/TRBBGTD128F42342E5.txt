Pray on my child
(Pray on my child)
I got a home on high
(Yes, I got a home on high)

You know I've talked about
(You as you born)
I need Jesus
(Jesus to carry me on)

Oh, if I never
(Never did)
Wander where, where you meet
(Meet me on the other shore)

Pray on
(Pray on my child)
Oh yeah
(Pray on my child)
I got a home on high
(Yes, I got a home on high)

Pray on my child
(Pray on my child)
I got a home on high
(Yes, I got a home on high)

You know I've talked about
(You as you born)
And I need Jesus
(Jesus to carry me on)

Oh, if I never
(Never see your smiling face)
I wanna be saved
(Saved by my own grave)

Pray on
(Pray on my child)
Oh yeah
(Pray on my child)
I got a home on high
(yes, I got a home on high)

I remember the day, remember it well
(Pray on, just pray on)
When you saved my soul from burning hell
(Pray on, you just pray on)

You can talk about me as much as you believe
(Pray on, and just pray on)
But the more you talk the more I'm gonna bend my knee
(Pray on, and just pray on)

Pray on my child
(Pray on my child)
I got a home on high
(Yes, I got a home on high)

You know I've talked about
(You as you born)
I need Jesus
(Jesus to carry me on)

Oh, if I never
(Never did)
Wander where where you meet
(Meet me on the other shore)

Pray on

Pray on
(Pray on my child)
