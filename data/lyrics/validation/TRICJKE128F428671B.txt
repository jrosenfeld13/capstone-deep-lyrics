You've got it all wrong
You can't get it right
Why don't you come down
From off my back
And won't you get yourself a job somewhere away from me?

Cause I don't want you to see your face anymore
Cause I don't want you on my case in the morning
I'm just being honest
It's the least I could do
You say I'll never be honest with you
Cause you don't deserve it anyway

No I do not think that you could love me anyway
Because you are inferior to me
And no I do not think that you could love me anyway
Because you are superior in all aspects to me

(repeat)

No I do not think that you could love me anyway
Because you are superior in all aspects to me
