Everybody's sayin' something
They tell us how to live our lives
It's all lies

I go from burnin' up the streetlights
To wakin' up all alone
Next to your pillow

And I know
It's easier to go
Just to go with the flow
I'm here to let you know

To just let go
Step out of the straight line
Don't you know?
We're here to have a good time

Here we are, we're all the same
And we all play this game
And you, you take, you take me away
The world's such a heavy place

The door's been opened
We've been waiting all this time
Here we are, we're all the same
And we all play this game

She went to college, now a housewife
She wears a smile and she cries inside
She thought she did everything right

He starts to wonder where the time went
As he's sittin' at his 9 to 5
As he stares out the window

And I know it's easier to go
Just to go with the flow
I'm here to let you know

To just let go
Step out of the straight line
Don't you know?
We're here to have a good time

Here we are, we're all the same
And we all play this game
And you, you take, you take me away
The world's such a heavy place

The door's been opened
We've been waiting all this time
Here we are, we're all the same
And we all play this game

We're born on a rock
Spinning through space
We can't understand
What we cannot explain

Here we are, we're all the same
You, you take, you take me away
The world's such a heavy place

The door's been opened
We've been waiting all this time
Here we are, we're all the same
And we all play this game
And you, you take, you take me away
The world's such a heavy place

The door's been opened
We've been waiting all this time
Here we are, we're all the same
