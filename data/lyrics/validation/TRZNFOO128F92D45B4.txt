[Verse 1]
Every day I'm a star in the city
Walk the streets like a wanted man
All the time got my shine lookin pretty
Motherfuckers all know who I am
Every day feel the heat in the city
Like the barrel of a smoking gun
Read the signs see the lights their so pretty
You're the one now turn me on

[Chorus]
(Hey) give it all up for me
(Hey) give it all up for me
(Hey) give it all up for me
City boy life

[Verse 2]
Every day I'm alive in the city
She's a fire that lives by the sun
On the street lookin fine lookin pretty
She sucks the heat off my -- gun
They'll eat you alive in the city
While they pull up in fancy cars
Drinking wine, wasting time you are pretty
Politicians, movie stars

[Chorus]
(Hey) give it all up for me
(Hey) give it all up for me
(Hey) give it all up for me
City boy life

[Chorus]
(Hey) give it all up for me
(Hey) give it all up for me
(Hey) give it all up for me
City boy life

[Verse 3]
Every day I'm a star in the city
Walk the streets like a loaded gun
All the time got my shine lookin pretty
Everybody now turn me on

[Chorus]
(Hey) give it all up for me
(Hey) give it all up for me
(Hey) give it all up for me

[Chorus]
(Hey) give it all up for me
(Hey) give it all up for me
(Hey) give it all up for me
