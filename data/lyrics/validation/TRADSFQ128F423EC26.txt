Brains on your head
Shoes on your feet
Life still living [why still live?] from week to week
And cheek to cheek
Waitin' for the phone to blink
Waitin' for the phone to blink
Waitin' for the blow to snow
Skating around
The only place you know
Prayin' for your hair to grow
Now your mama say
Back before the war
Everything was sugar free
Everything was sugar free
A girl's heart
Was filled with stars
And the boys peeled out
In muscle cars
Back before the war
The boys peeled out
In muscle cars
Before the war
Everything was sugar free
Everything was sugar free
A girl's heart
Was filled with stars
And your mom say
Back before the war
Everything was sugar free
Everything was sugar free
A girl's heart
Was filled with stars
And the boys peeled out
In muscle cars
Ya got brains on your head
And shoes on your feet
Life still living from week to week
And cheek to cheek
Waitin' around
Waitin' around for the phone to blink
Waitin' around
Brains on your head
Shoes on your feet
Brains on your head
Shoes on your feet
Brains on your head
Shoes on your feet
Life still living from week to week
