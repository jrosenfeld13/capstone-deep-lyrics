{Intro}

Together we stand, divided we fall
Come on now people, let's get on the ball and work together
Come on, come on, let's work together, now now people
Because together we will stand every boy, every girl and a man...

Before when things go wrong, as they sometimes will
And the road that you travel, it stays all up hill
Let's work together, come on, come on, let's work together
Now now people, you know together we will stand
Every boy, girl, woman and a man ...

Oh well now, two or three minutes, two or three hours
What does it matter now, if this goes round
Let's work together, come on, come on
Let's work together, now now people
Because together we will stand
Every boy, every woman and a man ...

{Bridge}
Oh, common now..

Oh well, make someone happy, make someone smile
Let's all work together and make life worthwhile
Let's work together, come on , come on
Let's work together, now now people
Because together we will we stand
Every boy, girl, woman and a man...

Oh well now, come on you people, walk hand in hand
Let's make this world of ours, a good place to stand
And work together, come on, come on
Let's work together, now, now people
Because together we will stand
Every boy, girl, woman and man
Ah, yeah

{Bridge}

Well now, together we will stand
Every boy, girl, woman and man
Ah, yeah
