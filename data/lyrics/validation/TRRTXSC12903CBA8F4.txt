A long time forgotten
Are dreams that just felt by the way
And the good life he promised
Ain't what she's living today
But she never complains of
The bad times or bad things he's done, Lord
She's just talks about the good times
They've had and all the good times to come
She's a good hearted woman
In love with a good timin' man
She loves him in spite of his ways
That she don't understand
Through teardrops and laughter
They'll pass though his world hand in hand
A good hearted woman
Lovin' her good timin' man
He likes the night life
The brightlights and good timin' friends
When the party's all over
She welcome him back home again
Lord knows she don't understand him
But she does the best that she can
'Cause she's a good hearted woman
She loves her good timin' man
She's a good hearted woman
In love with a good timin' man
And she loves him in spite of his wicked ways
That she don't understand
Through teardrops and laughter
They'll pass though his world hand in hand
A good hearted woman
Lovin' her good timin' man
She's a good hearted woman
In love with a good timin' man
She loves me in spite of my wicked ways
That she don't understand
Through teardrops and laughter
They'll pass though we'll world hand in hand Lord
A good hearted woman
Lovin' her good timin' man
