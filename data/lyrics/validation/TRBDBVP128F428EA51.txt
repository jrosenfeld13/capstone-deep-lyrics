I've been deceived for the very last time
My eyes are open and I've made up mind
That I'll have patience in whatever I go through
I am encouraged in You
So many times my tears were ignored
Before my real relationship with the Lord
Now I hold my head up for I've been set free
Nothing can discourage me
They that wait on Him shall regain strength
I encourage you in the Lord
Be encouraged, hold your head up
Be encouraged, don't you give up
Be encouraged, hold your head up high
If you stand and never faint
Please take heed to what I say
Get it up, get it up, get it up
Get it up, get it up, get it up
Hold your head up, it's not over for you;
Everything He promised, I know He'll do
Hold your head up
