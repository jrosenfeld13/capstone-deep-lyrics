You look like you rented a smile from someone
But you rented the wrong size
Take it back, take it back
You should take it back

Bury it
That's not what you want
That's not what you want

'Cause that would grow more
That's not what you want
That's not what you want

We still have the element of surprise
Defence shields down

Return to energiser
Return to energiser
Return to energiser
Return to energiser

Wave your bloody white flags
Surrender
Give in

That's not what you want
That's not what you want
That's not what you want
That's not what you want

That's not what you want
That's not what you want
That's not what you want
That's not what you want

That's not what you want

We still have the element of surprise
Defence shields down

Return to energiser
Return to energiser
Return to energiser
Return to energiser

Return to energiser
Return to energiser
Return to energiser
Return to energiser

And all hell breaks loose, when you're here
And all hell breaks loose, when you're here
And all hell breaks loose, when you're here
And all hell breaks loose, when you're here
When you're here
When you're here
