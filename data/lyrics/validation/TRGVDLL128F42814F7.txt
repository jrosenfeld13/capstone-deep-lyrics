Say goodbye to the resurrection
Here comes the apocalypse
Why must we, why must we
Constantly live in fear?

Breathe in the greed and filth
Of our everyday society
Breathe out religions and politics
These laws no longer apply to us

Was it supposed to be so simple?
Shining light to see the darkness
Filled with blood and greed, so hollow
Fighting desperately against my shadow

They tell us we can be whatever we want to be
It's called "The pursuit of happiness"
Do we really ever find it?
Sure we might have our moments of bliss

It's just a shame that it doesn't last forever
Brings us back to the old saying
"Easy come and easy go"

Was it supposed to be so simple?
Shining light to see the darkness
Filled with blood and greed, so hollow
Fighting desperately against my shadow

Right now, I stand for the truth
Right now, I see the world for what it is
Are we afraid, afraid to die?
Are we afraid, afraid to live?

Right now, I stand for the truth
Right now, I see the world for what it is

Was it supposed to be so simple?
Shining light to see the darkness
Filled with blood and greed, so hollow
Fighting desperately against my shadow
