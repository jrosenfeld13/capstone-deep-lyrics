[Verse 1]
Four A.M., two hours to go
I'm wearing out a lonely glow
I miss you more than I can know
Here I am, here I am, won't you keep me?

[Chorus]
I've got my hands at redemption's side
Whose scars are bigger than these doubts of mine
I'll fit all of these monstrosities inside
It'll come alive, come alive

[Verse 2]
With my fist down at your feet
I was running out of mysteries
Insecure and incomplete
Here I am, here I am
Won't you get me?

[Chorus]
I've got my hands at redemption's side
Whose scars are bigger than these doubts of mine
I'll fit all of these monstrosities inside and I'll come alive
Come alive, alive, come alive

[Bridge]
My fears have worn me out
My fears have worn me out
And my fears have worn me out
My fears have worn me, worn me out

[Chorus]
I've got my hands at redemption's side
Whose scars are bigger than these doubts of mine
I'll fit all of these monstrosities inside
I'll come alive

[Outro]
At redemption's side
Bigger than these doubts of mine
I'll fit all of these monstrosities inside
I'll come alive, come alive
