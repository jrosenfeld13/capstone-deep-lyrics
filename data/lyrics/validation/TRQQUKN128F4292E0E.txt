Over and over
I tried to prove my love to you
Over and over
What more can I do

Over and over
My friend says I'm a fool
But over and over
I'll be a fool for you

Cause you got personality
Walk (with personality)
Talk (with personality)
Smile (with personality)
Charm (with personality)
Love (with personality)
And plus you've got
A great big heart

So over and over
Oh, I'll be a fool for you
Now over and over
What more can I do

Cause you got personality
Walk (with personality)
Talk (with personality)
Smile (with personality)
Charm (with personality)
Love (with personality)
And plus you've got
A great big heart

So over and over
Whoa, I'll be a fool for you
Now over and over
What more can I do

Over and over
I said that I love you
Over and over, honey
Now it's the truth

Over and over
They still say I'm a fool
But over and over
I'll be a fool for you

Cause you got personality
Walk (with personality)
Talk (with personality)
Smile (with personality)
Charm (with personality)
Love (with personality)
And plus you've got
A great big heart

So over and over
Whoa, I'll be a fool for you
Now over and over
What more can I do
