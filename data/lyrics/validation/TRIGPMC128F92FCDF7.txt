How do we cope
With the days after a death?
Empty days. Nothing left
Not even a funeral

I see shapes falling inside paintings
Animals and humans, row upon row
Walking toward something
Waiting for something

I'm looking for an answer
Me and a million others
Disbelievers
Deserted lovers
Dear God, you'd better not let me down this time

Cracks in the canvas
Look like roads
That never end
