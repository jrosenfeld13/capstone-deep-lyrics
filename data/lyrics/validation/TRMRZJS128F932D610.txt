So I take another step, and one more breath
Closer to death. there's things going on in this
World that got me stressed. lately I find myself
Searching my soul. looking for signs of life
A warmth in the cold. i'm young and restless
And they want me to fold. i'm hard headed, I
Ain't never did shit I was told. I get too mad too
Fast over too much shit, but I put too much heart
Into the words I spit. maybe i'm too proud
Maybe I scream too loud...but what goes in
Must come out. and i'm hurting inside. I can't
Show it. obstructed by pride. I ain't being hard I
Just don't know why. fuck tomorrow if I live or
I die. who comes first? you not before i. i'm still
A ways off from my lofty goals, so fuck those
Who oppose and those who's acting like ho's. I
Ain't got time for ya'll. focus my goals. I chose
C'mon now, you just write ryhmes...i recite lifelines
You're in it for the long haul...i'm in it for a lifetime
Let a brother try to come between me and mine
I'll lie cheat and steal to keep feeding mine. that's
The deal and that's for real, by any means. am I
Wrong because I want the finer things in life?
Hell no. take this world by storm
All I ever wanted was a taste of. all I ever wanted
Was a piece of what I could not have
