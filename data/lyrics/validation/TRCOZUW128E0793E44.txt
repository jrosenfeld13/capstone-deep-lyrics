Now, I don't wanna waste your time
I only want to satisfy
So wind me up and watch me go
I'm gettin' crazy as the night unfolds

Gimme, gimme what I want
Keep it up now, don't stop
And I will do the same for you
I'm gonna take it over the top

What you see ain't what you get
There's more than meets the eye
'Cause you ain't seen nothin' yet
It's up to us, me and you
Together we can fly high, high

I got you, now you got me
Feels so good to be
Makin' magic, makin' magic
It ain't no mystery, come on

Get down, way down low
C'mon, let's get on with the show
And let the music set you free
And like a leaf in the wind, let it be

Gimme what I need to satisfy
This dirty one-track mind
You know, I ain't got nothin' but time
To burn with you tonight

Now everything you see is everything you get
At your desire
I know it's makin' you hot and know it's soakin' me wet
Higher and higher, feedin' the fire
Let it burn

He's got her and she's hot and you got me
Don't it taste so sweet
Makin' magic, makin' magic
It ain't no mystery

Now, when I get into you, get into me
The rest is history
Makin' magic, makin' magic
Let's make it together, come on

Ready, get set
Just like one two and three
Now it's taking me away to that magical land
Many will search and never find what's yours and mine

You got me burnin' hot, now you're soakin' me wet
Even better than a lick and a kiss
Makin' magic, makin' magic
It ain't no mystery

Now, you think you've seen it all, you ain't seen nothin' yet
It sure beats the rest
Makin' magic, makin' magic
It ain't no mystery

He's got her and she's hot and you got me
And it's all we need
Makin' magic, makin' magic
Makin' magic, makin' magic
