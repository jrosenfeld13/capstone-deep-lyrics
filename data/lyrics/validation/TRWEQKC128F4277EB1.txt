Suck this
It's not you
It ain't you

He's the one who can take out my trash
He's the one who can scratch on my back
He's the one who don't give you flack
About what I do, and it's not you baby
It's not you
It ain't you

He's the one who can love me tender
He's the one who can fix up my blender
He's the one don't give a hoot
About what I do, and it's not you baby

He's the one who can(sizzle)
He's the one who can(pant)
He's the one who don't give a hoot
'bout what I do, and it's not you
NO!
