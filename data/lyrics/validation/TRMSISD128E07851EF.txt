Closure

Hoo...ooh...babe
Baby
Hoo...hoo...ooh...
Oh, babe
Oh, babe
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby

When did you stop lovin' me
What did I do so wrong
That you had to leave
When did you stop wantin' me
No letters, no call
Girl, you know I'm needy

Baby, this thing has took its toll
On my mind, my body, and soul, baby

Can't get you out of system
Out of my head
Out of my future
Out of my bed

I hear your name
I see your face
I lose all composure
I need to see you one more time
I need closure

Hoo...ooh... (Hoo, baby, baby)

Can we go somewhere, baby
And talk about
All the things I did to stress you out (Hoo...hoo...)
I won't be satisfied (No way)
Till I understand why
Why you ain't here in my life

Can you just give me that much (Yeah)
Don't leave me hanging without a crutch

Can't get you out of system (Can't get you out)
Out of my head (Out of my head)
Out of my future (My future)
Out of my bed (My bed)

I hear your name (Hear your name)
I see your face (See your face, babe)
I lose all composure (Hoo, baby)
I need to see you one more time
I need closure (Ooh...closure)

Hoo...ooh...ooh...closure (Closure)
Hoo...ooh...

Why, that is the question
Every day I ask myself
Since you went away, baby (Hoo, baby)
I wasn't perfect (No way)
Tell me were you (Were you, babe)
You said everyday I love you (You said, you said)

Can't get you out of system (Ooh...hoo...)
Out of my head
Out of my future (No way)
Out of my bed (No way, baby)

I hear your name (I hear your name)
I see your face (I see your face, babe)
I lose all composure (I get all chocked up inside)
I need to see you one more time
I need closure (Closure)

Hoo...ooh...ooh...closure (I need to know why did you
Leave me, baby)
Hoo...ooh...ooh...closure (Why did you go away, baby)
Hoo...ooh...ooh...closure (Why did you pick up and
Leave me)
I need to see you one more time (Na-na-na-na-na-na)
I need closure
