Back in the day before i met you.It was like the same old song spinning round with no direction..Lost a dream along the way somwhere,just makin do with second best.Secret yearning unfulfilled.But it all came alive again,the day you touched my soul.High as eagle.I can see clearly now my life has begun with you,I'M leaving all my cares behind.Now I know that your mine,my one and only angel.Lost in your beauty,where my dreams came true.Baby my life has begun with you.It could easy take a lifetime,to find the one you're lookin for,oh yeah.I'm gonna cherish every moment now love has come around.Fire burning on and on.Cos in my Eyes you more than beautiful,and it's to your flame i'm drawn.You make me higher.I see tomorrow now my life has begun with you.I'm leaving all my cares behind.Now I know that you're mine,my one and only angel.Lost in your beauty,where my dreams came true.Now I know.Where my heart belongs,i'm never lookin back,no no no.Nothin compares to the joy that you bring.I see your beauty outside and the angel within.Oh oh
