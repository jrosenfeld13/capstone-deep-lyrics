When I was seven, they said I was strange
I noticed that my eyes and hair weren't the same
I asked my parents if I was okay
They said you're more beautiful and that's the way
They show that they wish that they had your smile
So my confidence was up for a while
I got real comfortable with my own style
I knew that they were only jealous cause

[All]
People are all the same
And we only get judged by what we do
Personality reflects name
And if I'm ugly then so are you
So are you

There was a time when I felt like I cared
That I was shorter than everyone there
People made me feel like life was unfair
And I did things that made me ashamed
Cause I didn't know my body would change
I grew taller than them in more ways
But there will always be the one who will say
Something bad to make them feel great

[All]
People are all the same
And we only get judged by what we do
Personality reflects name
And if I'm ugly then so are you
So are you

People are all the same
And we only get judged by what we do
Personality reflects name
And if I'm ugly then so are you
So are you

Everybody talks bad about somebody
And never realise how it affects somebody
And you bet it won't be forgotten
Envy is the only thing it could be

[All]
Cause people are all the same
And we only get judged by what we do
Personality reflects name
And if I'm ugly then so are you
So are you

People are all the same
And we only get judged by what we do
Personality reflects name
And if I'm ugly then so are you
So are you

So are you
People are all the same
And we only get judged by what we do
