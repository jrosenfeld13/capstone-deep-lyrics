Bird look to the sea
Into my eyes
He is hopeless and heartless and soul-less
Oh I hope not, I hope not
And bird look to the sea
Tell me what d'you see?
He is heartless and loveless and soul-less
Oh I hope not, I hope not
Ooooo
And I believe in plates, that they'll collide and gravitate
And I'll face him and we'll love then
Oh I hope so, I hope so
Oooooo
