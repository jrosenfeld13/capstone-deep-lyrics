I'm not scared of places I don't know
Take my hand leave me where you go
Honestly it happened all so fast
We fell in love it's ours, mentalized
And suddenly my fears would fade
And all my doubts were gone

You make me believe it
You will never let me fall, it's like were holding a secret
You and I can have it all
You make me believe it

Oh, yeah
You make me believe it

Honestly the feelings I can take
Cause in your arms I know I'm always safe

It's crazy how it happens all so soon
We found our love it's ours, the side of the moon
Suddenly my fears would fade
And all my doubts were gone

You make me believe it
You will never let me fall, it's like were holding a secret
You and I can have it all
You make me believe it

You make me believe it
Yeah

You make me believe
Oh, oh
You make me believe it

Oh, yeah
You make me believe
Oh, oh
Yeah, you make me believe
