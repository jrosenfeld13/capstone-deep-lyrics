[Verse 1]
I'll pick you up at 7, we can drive around and see a movie
Every scene will have a meaning, but you'll be the one that moves me
I've been hurt before so baby promise that you're gonna be true
I'm gonna be be good so tell me that you're gonna be good too

[Chorus]
You gotta be be good to me
I'm gonna be be good to you
We'll be happy as can be
Just gotta be be good to me
Baby

[Verse 2]
Gonna treat you right, we're never gonna fight
Now baby you can trust me
When I hold you tight, I feel alright
I guess that I'm just lucky
I've been hurt before so baby promise that you're gonna be true
I'm gonna be be good so tell me that you're gonna be good too

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Listen girl, you gotta be good
I don't wanna hurt you
I wanna kiss you!

[Chorus x2]

[Outro]
Listen girl, you're outta control
I think that you and me would be a great couple
Yeah
