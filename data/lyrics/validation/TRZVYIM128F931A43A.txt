The whale song, but where's it coming from?
Hahahahah
OOHH well my lad you've come aboard then!
You look as if you wanted a breath of sea air!
I want a fish
Well you've got a lovely day for it!
Hahahaha!
Hold back, 300 metres port bow captain!
I can just see the whale coming out of the mist
They heard a gurgling sound
And the head of the
Whale
Rose above the surface of the water

There's a whale, there's a whale
There's a whale fish he cried
And the whale was in full view
There's a whale, There's a whale
There's a whale fish's bow
And the whale was in full view
Whale fish, whale fish, whale fish
And the whale was in full view
There's a whale, there's a whale, There's a whale fish
And the whale was in full view

The huge fish emerged from the water
It looked dreadful
It was covered in mud and green weed
You call that a whale?
Ahh! What sorta fish are you?!
I'm not a real fish at all you stupid man
What are you if you're not a fish?
You certainly look like a fish..
Well I certainly don't feel like a fish

There's a whale, there's a whale
There's a whale fish he cried
And the whale was in full view
There's a whale, There's a whale
There's a whale fish's bow
And the whale was in full view
Whale fish, whale fish, whale fish
And the whale was in full view
There's a whale, there's a whale, There's a whale fish
And the whale was in full view

Just then he fell into the sea
Whoops
Man overboard!
Do something fast!
Swim for it!
I.. I can't swim!
Can't swim! Well well, fancy that!
The lifeboat came to the rescue
I've been shipwrecked
Well after being shipwrecked no doubt you'll be ready
For lunch!
When the fisherman got his breath back
They had a lovely picnic supper Of fish and chips
It was the best fish supper they'd ever tasted
It was
Delicious

There's a whale, there's a whale
There's a whale fish he cried
And the whale was in full view
There's a whale, There's a whale
There's a whale fish's bow
And the whale was in full view
Whale fish, whale fish, whale fish
And the whale was in full view
There's a whale, there's a whale, There's a whale fish
And the whale was in full view

Whales! Great creatures of the sea!
Please listen to me!
Whales, whales, whales, whales..
Whales, I am your friend
On the bed of the ocean
No doubt!
Thank you great fish
