Hello ones
Hello ones
This is your captain speaking
I got a chip on my shoulder the size of a boulder and I'm gonna have to get it off
D'you know what I'm gonna tell you?
That bigger is better and smaller is impossible to find
I'm gonna tell you that a tired old voice is better than a screaming one
What a hoax

Listen
Listen, listen, listen
This just in
Take good care of your pearly whites and I'll let you in on a little secret
I had to walk up a bunch of stiffs just to get here but it merely meant I had to walk a mile in style to walk an eternity like a king
Don't let them lead you astray
Never let them put you away
Laugh at everything when people say they'll resist you
And we don't regret a single thing
