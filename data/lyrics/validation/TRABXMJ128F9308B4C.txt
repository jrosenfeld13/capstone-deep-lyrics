[Verse 1]
It's not the lights or the music, it's something that you're doing to me, girl
It's not the dance that we're dancing that's making my heartbeat explode
Because you're turning me on and there's no turning off my desire
Before I go any further there's something that I've got to know

[Chorus]
Is it in, is it love inside your heart now?
Is it in, do you feel it like I do?
Is it in, baby has the fire started?
Is it in, let me bring it out of you?

[Verse 2]
The whole room is shaking, our shadows embracing on the dance floor
There's a message in the movement that's saying you've been grooving on me
But the night's getting late and I've got to get it straight from your lips
And when the last dance is over you'll be coming home, girl, with me, yeah

[Chorus]
Is it in, is it love inside your heart now?
Is it in, do you feel it like I do?
Is it in, baby has the fire started?
Is it in, let me bring it out of you?

[Bridge]
Is it in
Is it in

Is it, is it in

[Verse 1]
It's not the lights or the music, it's something that you're doing to me, girl
It's not the dance that we're dancing that's making my heartbeat explode
Because you're turning me on and there's no turning off my desire
Before I go any further there's something that I've got to know

[Chorus]
Is it in, is it love inside your heart now?
Is it in, do you feel it like I do?
Is it in, baby has the fire started?
Is it in, let me bring it out of you?

Is it in
Is it in
Is it in, is it love inside your heart now
Is it in, let me bring it out of you
Is it in

[Outro]
Is it in, do you feel a fire burning
Is it in, let me bring it out of you
Is it, is it, is it in
Is it, is it, is it in
Is it, is it, is it in
Is it, is it, is it in
Is it, is it, is it in
Is it, is it, is it in
Is it, is it, is it in
Is it, is it, is it in
