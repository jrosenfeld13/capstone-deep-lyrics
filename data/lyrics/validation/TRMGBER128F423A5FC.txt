She said, "We're, we're caving in
You're living to die
And I'm dying to live."
What will it take for you to understand
This is something the doctors just can't fix?

It's always been my style to live a lie
I'm out of breath and we're out of time
She said, "It kills me to know you get
Your best sleep under hospital lights."

I'd die for the black sunshine in her smile
I'm saving dreams for the comas in her eyes
I exist in the romance of regret
And the sounds of breaking hearts
I twist and laugh, lost in her arms
Like the crashing of cars

I wandered into your kiss
With a heart too heavy to hold
Into a million pieces
I wait to explode

I only wanted to love you the way I should
Tear the world apart, but I never could
I just wanted to say something beautiful
(Something beautiful)
Damn this voice, this coward's shout
I'm breaking up and fading out
Just put your hands on my face
And kiss me on the mouth

I wander into your kiss and wait to explode
Into a million pieces through sweet miracles
I followed you in the dark
With a heart too heavy to hold
I wandered into your kiss
I wait to explode

I'd die for the black sunshine in her smile
I'm saving dreams for the comas in her eyes
I exist in the romance of regret
And the sounds of breaking hearts
I twist and laugh, lost in her arms
Like the crashing of cars

I wander into your kiss and wait to explode
Into a million pieces through sweet miracles
I followed you in the dark
With a heart too heavy to hold
I wandered into your kiss
I wait to explode
