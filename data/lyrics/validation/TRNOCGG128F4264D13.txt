Here comes the boom

I got game like Kobe
Act like you know me
If you rhyme better, well then kid you best show me
Fly by wrecking, never come in second
Fists in my pocket and use my words as my weapon

Ghetto blaster thumping, girlies are bumping
Gotta get the dough like my man Donald Trump and
Set this in motion, jaws in the ocean
If you need a rhyme, well then, kid I got the potion

Damn
Building this up like a high rise
Better yet phatter than Nell Carter's right thigh
Coming in slanging, never leave you hanging
If you talk shit, then on your door, I'm banging
Twisting up hip hop, running with my flip flops
Past all the cops just chilling in the donut shops
For no other reason, no it ain't treason
Just coming up cause this is the Zebrahead season

Get back, get back, get back (I didn't want it, didn't need it)
Get back, get back, get back (I didn't want it, didn't need it)
My time's the only thing that you have taken
So above the world, don't be mistaken, so
Get back, get back, get back (I didn't want it, didn't need it)
Get back, get back, get back (I didn't want it, didn't need it)
You've lost the only thing that you were given
Afraid to stand alone, so now you're tripping, so

Living life disco, here to San Francisco
Do my own stunts cause I like to take the risk, yo
Punk rock rhyming, rap is always climbing
Like your first time cause I'll pop out your hymen

With the bass drum booming
Jump up in the room and
Watch the walls sway cause the groove is grooving
Got your hands shaking, suckers that I'm baking
Made you look dumb cause it's your girl that I'm taking, what

Get back, get back, get back (I didn't want it, didn't need it), so
Get back, get back, get back (I didn't want it, didn't need it)
My time's the only thing that you have taken
So above the world, don't be mistaken, so
Get back, get back, get back (I didn't want it, didn't need it)
Get back, get back, get back (I didn't want it, didn't need it)
You've lost the only thing that you were given
Afraid to stand alone, so now you're tripping, so

Let me set this off like a bomb
Have your ass stepping like Jerry and Tom in a bomb
With the freestyle form that I'm kicking
Have your ass tripping with the rhymes that I'm flipping
And this ain't no west coast thing
It's a world wide ring with the style we bring, right?
So watch the dime drop as I harvest my crop
Cause I'm going to ride this to the top, ha-ha-ha

Get back, get back, get back (I didn't want it, didn't need it), so
Get back, get back, get back (I didn't want it, didn't need it)
My time's the only thing that you have taken
So above the world, don't be mistaken, so
Get back, get back, get back (I didn't want it, didn't need it)
Get back, get back, get back (I didn't want it, didn't need it)
You've lost the only thing that you were given
Afraid to stand alone, so now you're tripping, so
Get back, get back, get back
