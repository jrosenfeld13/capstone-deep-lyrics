Thousands of people gathered on a beach
Some came to listen while others came to preach
They had to plan this meeting and keep it quite discrete
For the poles to survive they must pretend defeat
To help you rid those scums
Kidology, perfect it to an art
Kidology, keep them in the dark
Grow you must in silence
Your strenght will overcome
There's others on the outside
To help you rid those scums
Kidology, perfect it to an art
Kidology, keep them in the dark
