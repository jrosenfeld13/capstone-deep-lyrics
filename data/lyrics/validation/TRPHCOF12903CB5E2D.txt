Well, the big bell is tollin'
Trouble is heading north

Well, the big bell, it's tollin'
Trouble is heading north

Well, it's so my baby
And it let me here all alone

Well, my head is so heavy
When the sun starts sinkin' low

Well, my head ain't so heavy
When the sun starts sinkin' low

It put my soul on a wonder
Hoo, which way did my baby go?

Well, I heard a loud singing
Saw some slow marching
I heard a deep moaning
And, oh, that was my whole life
And these tears from my eyes
Keep on streamin' down

I keep crying for my baby
And I know she can't be found
