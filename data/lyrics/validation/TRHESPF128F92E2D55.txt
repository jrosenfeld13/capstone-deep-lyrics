Shelter from the hard rain in the night
Shelter from the hard rain by your side
Very nearly perfect by your side
I take you in my arms now, hold you tight

Where in the world would we be
Without the love you give
How can we live without
Without the love you give

Shelter in the hard times of no work
Shelter in the hard times and you're there
Somebody tie a red rose in your hair
Take you in my arms now, take you there
