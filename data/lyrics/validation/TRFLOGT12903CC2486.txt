You think you fucking know me
But you don't know a fucking thing
So much bullshit, it surrounds me
It won't affect the way I live
Trouble has always been there, always been by my side
I'll do the best with what I got
It's not a lot, but I know I'll survive
There's another face, that won't be around for a long time
And another day, best believe I'm pushing on
Everyone, everywhere has changed so much
Time and time again, I've fucked things up
All my hopes and dreams, have been gone so long
Now I know, my future is fucking dead
Nothing was ever handed to me
But fuck that now I can't complain
No one ever showed me the way
So I fought through life to find the next day
A lot of ugly that I've found
Slapped me right in the face
Overcome truth before trust, in myself I must believe
