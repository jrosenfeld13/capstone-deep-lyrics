You can charge a limo on a big account
Hey, hey, hey
You can spend your cash in large amounts
It won't run out now baby
No matter what you buy

You're jazzin' with the big boyz, mama
Jazzin' with the big boyz now
You're jazzin' with the big boyz, mama
You're jazzin' with the big boyz now

You can drape yourself in Cartier
Ooh, yea
Your account gets fatter day by day
So the tabloids say

You're jazzin' with the big boyz, mama
You're jazzin' with the big boyz now
You're jazzin' with the big boyz, mama
You're rollin' with the fat cats now

Ain't no good in telling me

You made your bed now won't you lie in it
Don't come crying to me I don't give a sh...

Jazzin' with the big boyz now
You know, she's rollin' with the fat cats now
She's jazzin' with the big boyz, mama, mama, mama
She's jazzin' with the big boyz now

Darlin', darlin' I know it can't be easy
Havin' it all, havin' a ball
Darlin', darlin' I know it can't be easy
Havin' it all, havin' a ball
Baby, baby, baby, yeah
Your tears can't hide the pain
Of a little too much wine
And a little too much cocaine

She's jazzin' with the big boyz now
She's jazzin' with the big boyz, mama
She's rollin' with the fat cats now
She's jazzin' with the big boyz, baby
She's rollin' with the fat cats
She's jazzin' with the big boyz, mama
She's jazzin' with the big cats now
She's jazzin' with the big boyz, mama what I say
She's rollin' with the fat cats now
She's jazzin' with the big boyz
Jazzin' with the big boyz
Jazzin' with the big boyz
Jazzin' with the big boyz now
