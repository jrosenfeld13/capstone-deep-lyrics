Get in to crawl with all your grace... can't stand the wrong within Blame the disarmed and give in...
To face the game of passion To set things clear your departure is near Straight in the backyard of decay
Far away, far away from here... I met a man who wasn't there
He wasn't there again I wish he'd stay away Just lie and try to remain Pleasures in a fool's black garden
Far away, far away from here... I met a man who wasn't there
Anyhow you can, anyhow you will How does it feel to recall all that's real in the end... to relent
