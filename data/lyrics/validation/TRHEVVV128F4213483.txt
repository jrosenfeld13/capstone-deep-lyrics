Busted flat in baton rouge, headin' for the trains
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
Took us all the way to new orleans
Took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
And was blowin' sad while bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time and
Bobby clappin' hands we finally sang up every song
That driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
And nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feelin' good was easy, lord, when bobby sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my bobby mcgee
From the coalmines of kentucky to the california sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standin' right beside me through everythin I done
And every night she kept me from the cold
The somewhere near salinas, lord, I let her slip away
She was lookin' for the love I hope she'll find
Well I'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holdin' bobby's body close to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
And nothin' left was all she left to me
Feelin' good was easy, lord, when bobby sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and bobby mcgee
