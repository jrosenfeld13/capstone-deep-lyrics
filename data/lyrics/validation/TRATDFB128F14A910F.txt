Nights like this were made for us
You fill me with desire
I want you, I do
Come give me the best of you

Come a little closer now
Don't be shy
Ooh the things we can do, you and I
Get into my groove

Nights like this - you fill me with desire
Nights like this - your love it takes me higher
Nights like this - you're such a thrill
Come fill me up with your love Baby

Let me take my time with you
You know I should
Ooh the way you touch me boy, feels so good

I like the way you love me boy
I like the way you groove
Baby just take your time
I like the way you love

Nights like this - you fill me with desire
Nights like this - your love it takes me higher
Nights like this - you're such a thrill
Come fill me up with your love Baby

Now I'm very shy
But there's something I just have to tell you
I like the way you do that
