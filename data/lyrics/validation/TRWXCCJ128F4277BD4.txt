If only my heart spoke, the things it would tell me
To hold onto meaning, keep on dreaming
If only my heart spoke, the things it would tell me
To hold onto meaning, keep on dreaming

Everything tumbles oh so quickly to the ground
As I sit here wishing, waiting and anticipating
I don't know what calculations I have made
But I know I, know I, must have something right

If only my heart spoke, the things it would tell me
To hold onto meaning, keep on dreaming
If only my heart spoke, the things it would tell me
To hold onto meaning, keep on dreaming

Thinking myself even deeper every day
Contemplating, formulating and even dedicating
Meanings to feelings that I can't play advocate
Still I know I, know I, must have something right
Butterflies deep between my heart and stomach
Tell me I'm alive
Those butterflies deep between my heart and stomach tell me I'm alive
