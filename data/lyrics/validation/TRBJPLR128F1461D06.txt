[Verse 1]
We started well - I looked at you you looked at me
We fell into that dream it wasn't hard for me to do, you were lovely
And I hardly even knew I was laughing all over my face
'Cause you were laughing and you brightened the place
Now here we are, we've come this far

[Chorus]
Another year has gone
And here's another one
What are we going to do
Will it be something new?
Will it be good?
Will it be good for me and you?

[Verse 2]
This is just what love should be and I know that always
Im never sorry, I cant imagine how I lived without you
I think I shared the life that lonely people do
And now we share each other

[Chorus]
Another year has gone
And heres another one
What are we going to do
Will it be something new?
Will it be good?
Will it be good for me and you?

[Verse 3]
Only time will tell
If we will use it well
Looking at me, what do you see, do you agree?
Looking at you I see everything I could need
