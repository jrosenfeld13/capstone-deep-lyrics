One fine day on a winter november
Life came true through a point of view
And death came quick with a killer influence
Running through the streets with a clueless tool
Mark three birds just to make me feel cozy
Everything's fine when the group is flying
High on fire is a healthy companion
Fueling my run with a sound so true and warm
I see it coming and I want to look away
But I can't divert my eyes
I hear it calling and it's from beyond the grave
But I'm still alive
