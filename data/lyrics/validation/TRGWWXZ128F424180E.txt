There's something every day that keeps on pulling at me
Mental pictures of a firing line
You put me in that place with no one there to get me out
Missing chances just to speak my mind

My oh my, its so hard to pass by

This time
I'm all right but something is broken
But, will it heal in time?
It's all right. Some words that were spoken leave a mark and change your mind

It's not too hard to see you left this inside me
This new emotion that I didn't know I needed
Thank you for teaching me that I could never trust you
The day will come when I can ask you why

(Prechorus)

(Chorus)
