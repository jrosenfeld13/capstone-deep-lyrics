Damn!
I'm on the go
So we'll make the whole club crazy
'Cause we rock the show
And yes you know
That I will roll
With the big bass bomb
(x3)

Damn!
I'm on the go
So we'll make the whole club crazy
'Cause we rock the show
And yes you know
That I will roll
With the big bass bomb-bomb-bomb-bomb-bomb

Damn-damn (x?)

Check out the bass the beat boomin' (x8)

Check out the bass (x6)

Check out the bass the beat boomin'

Damn-damn (x?)

Damn!
I'm on the go
So we'll make the whole club crazy
'Cause we rock the show
And yes you know
That I will roll
With the big bass bomb
(6x)

DAMN!
