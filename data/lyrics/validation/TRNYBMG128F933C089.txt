It seems to me your body's yearnin' seems to me your lips're turnin' cold
And after all the love I've given someone else's love is taking hold
And I can see your mind is workin' and an awful thought is turnin' round
I don't know when my time is comin' when it does my world is comin' down
Comin' down fallin' down
I don't know when my time is comin' when it does my world is comin' down

I can see your eyes are wanting but I know they're wanting something new
And I know that it's all over what's he gonna do what I can't do
And I been knowin' that you're restless like the leaves that tumble to the ground
I don't know when my time is comin' when it does my world is comin' down
Comin' down fallin' down...
No I don't know when my time is comin' when it does my world is comin' down
Oh no I don't know when my time is comin' when it does my world is comin' down
