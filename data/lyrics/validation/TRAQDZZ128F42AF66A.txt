[Chorus]
Let's plan a robbery, (a robbery) (lets go...)
Let's plan a robbery (a robbery)
Let's plan a robbery, (a robbery) (lets go...)

[Verse 1:Crunchy Black]
See I was on the North, North side in the projects Cutterfield
And dats where the the dope dealer nigga really live
See they sold crack, and they sold weed too
They specialize in cookin up the dope fool
To get it out, so the junkies can smoke too
But me my nigga, I been smokin out chu
And you ain't you cause yall been cuttin up du
I think I'mma have to touch ur ass with a tool
Its easy come easy go yall know the rule
HCP motherfucker you know I'll cut loose
And if you got it, I'mma have to touch you
Like knockin on your door and holla trick-or-treat fool
Its halloween motherfucker, don't let this motherfucker sight you
A robbery to a muderery that's cool
So any way that you want it, I got chu
Its one way hallway nigga, so fuck you

[Chorus]
Let's plan a robbery, (a robbery) (lets go...)
Let's plan a robbery (a robbery)
Let's plan a robbery, (a robbery) (lets go...)
Let's plan a robbery (a robbery)

[Chorus continues]
You see good with this yay, but I'm better with these guns
I'm at ya doe to collect these funds

You see good with this yay, but I'm better with these guns
I'm at ya doe to collect these funds
[Chorus ends]

[Verse 2:DJ Paul]
I ran up in his spot, with the Glock, his jaw dropped
He knew I came for money and the weight I heard he got
I cracked him in the middle of his face with the tone
Tied his ass up and ransacked his home
I had to rape his bitch cause the ho was stacked
I fucked her from the back, with my gun to her back
I left up out his crib, with dolla and purple hat
But eventually got caught because of a dick hair

[Verse 3:Juicy J]
Dont let me find out that you got that dope
Dont let me find out that you snitchin on folks
Dont let me find out that you tryna get rich
Riddin round' the fuckin' hood n makin fun of niggas shit
Dont let me find out, feds tap a nigga phone
Dont let me find out, cause if I find out its on
Dont let me find out that niggas sellin purple drank
Cuz I'mma rob all dem fools, like I robbed 20 banks

[Chorus]
Let's plan a robbery, (a robbery) (lets go...)
Let's plan a robbery (a robbery)
Let's plan a robbery, (a robbery) (lets go...)
Let's plan a robbery (a robbery)

[Chorus continues]
You see good with this yay, but I'm better with these guns
I'm at ya doe to collect these funds

You see good with this yay, but I'm better with these guns
I'm at ya doe to collect these funds
[Chorus ends]
