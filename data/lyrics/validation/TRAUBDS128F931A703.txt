This life starts
With a heartbeat
Is it beat, beat, beat, beat, beating, me down
Like the loser I am?

I can't help
But to see
That success scares
The living shit out of me
Like the loser I am

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time I walk away
Every word I never say

[Chorus]
Restless, chasing shadows
Choices, facing Gallows
Are you hanging by a thread
Or swinging from the rope?
Don't think we don't see your scars
Are you afraid of who you are?

Are you afraid of who you are!?

Denial what subtle burn
Is it burn, burn, burn, burn, burning me out
Or feeding the flames?

Spread out the ash
Pretend to see
That you can
Still find some value in me;
Or is it feeding the flames?

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time I walk away
Every word I never say

[Chorus]
Restless, chasing shadows
Choices, facing Gallows
Are you hanging by a thread
Or swinging from the rope?
Don't think we don't see your scars
Are you afraid of who you are?

Oh my god
What am I afraid of
Success or not having what it takes?

Oh my god
I afraid of me
And everything that brings

[Chorus]
Restless, chasing shadows
Choices, facing Gallows
Are you hanging by a thread
Or swinging from the rope?
Don't think we don't see your scars
Are you afraid of who you are?

Afraid of who you are?
Are you afraid of who you are?
