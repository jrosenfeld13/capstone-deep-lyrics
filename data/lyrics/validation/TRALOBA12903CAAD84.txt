When first we met on a night sometime ago
I told my heart there's a girl I'd like to know
But now I find just a little to late that I'm caught in the middle
And my fate is to be, is a lonely, lonely man&46

You tried so hard to change and feel the way I do
But now your flirty ways they won't last for you
And now I find just a little to late that I'm caught in the middle
And my fate is to be, is a lonely, lonely man

I wish I knew what would become of you and me
If only into the future I could see
But now I find just a little to late that I'm caught in the middle
And my fate is to be, is a lonely, lonely man

And my fate is to be, is a lonely, lonely man
And my fate is to be, is a lonely, lonely man...
