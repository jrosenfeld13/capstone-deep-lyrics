You have a choice
You think it up to you
They're in your mind making choices for you
They tell you what you want to hear
Before there's time to see the truth
The truth behind their eyes
They'll say you're right
They'll say you're nothing
They're taking all your chances
They'll say you're right
It's like they know you, but it was planted in your mind
By you, by them, by dreams + ideals
You'll never live to see; 'cause they're not real

They're taking all
They're taking all your
They're taking all your chances
