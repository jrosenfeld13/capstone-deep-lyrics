Well all right
We got jonney running the blockade
Three packs of cigerettes and the lunch his mother made
Left on monansis straight across the palisades
Might be for nothing
But hes on his way

Slip 78
Slip 78
I didn't mean to bring you down

Well it's all night on the pedal
And the pedal brings him more
City turns to country turns to thoughts of tats and war
Its more then just a notion of a trip that cannot be
Might be for nothing
But he's on his way

Slip 78
Slip 78
I didn't mean to bring you down
Slip 78
Slip 78
I didn't mean to bring you down

On the way
Make it up to you
Coming real soon
Ready

Slip 78
Slip 78
I didn't mean to bring you down
Slip 78
Slip 78
I didn't mean to bring you down
