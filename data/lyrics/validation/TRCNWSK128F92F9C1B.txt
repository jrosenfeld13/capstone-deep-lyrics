In the middle of the daytime, in the middle of the night
Comes a new kind of engine from way out of sight
She's good looking and her lines are mighty clean
The name of that engine is the Love Machine

Put some fuel in her tender and turn up the steam
You can hear, you can hear that whistle scream
You can see her coming on down the track
She'll send little shivers up and down your back

I know you've heard of old ninety-nine
Perhaps the red caboose
But they will all be left behind
When the Love Machine gets loose

In the middle of the daytime, in the middle of the night
Comes a new kind of engine from way out of sight
Now she's good-looking and her lines are mighty clean
And the name of that engine is the Love Machine
And the name of that engine is the Love Machine

I know you've heard of old ninety-nine
Perhaps the red caboose
But they will all be left behind
When the Love Machine gets loose
When the Love Machine gets loose

Now people I'm talking about love
And I'm talking about a machine yeah, huh!
It's a clean machine and a fine machine
When that Love Machine gets loose
When that Love Machine gets loose
I'm gonna get loose too, yeah
