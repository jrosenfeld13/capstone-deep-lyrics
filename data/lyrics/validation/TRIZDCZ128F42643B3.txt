Seven days of heaven, nine is the cloud
Yes, it's great to be one of the home team crowd

When the Lakers beat the Knicks in basketball
I beat my head up against the wall

When the Bruins beat the Rangers for that Stanley Cup
I got so drunk I could not stand up

When the Mets don't win, I get upset
I got a bullet hole in my TV set

Seven days of heaven, you know that nine is the cloud
You know it's great to be one of the home team crowd
