I need to have you near me
In a time when nothing's lasting long
And I need to feel you close to me
As my lover, I need to keep you warm
'Cause my life is so unreal without you.You're an angel, I see you passing by
And the voice that calls me under, baby
As a mother crying for her child

When the sun lights a rainbow
Of the tears of joy, I cry for you
And the dreamers, dream forever
Then I know, I'll be here with you

Like a riverboat at open sea
On a tide, free of rock and land
It leads me to surrender, baby
As a wave, draining in the sand

When the sun lights a rainbow
Of the tears of joy, I cry for you
And the dreamers, dream forever
Then I know, I'll be here with you
