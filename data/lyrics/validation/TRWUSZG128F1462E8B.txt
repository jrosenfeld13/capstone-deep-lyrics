Where's all of our friends
So you said things you never meant

And you just leave a part of myself
These are the best days of our lives
These are the best days of our lives
Crazy as it seems

Where's all of our friends
Things were better
We never met

And you just leave a part of myself
These are the best days of our lives
These are the best days of our lives
Crazy as it seems
Crazy as it seems
These are the best days of our lives
Crazy as it seems
These are the best days of our lives
Crazy as it seems
These are the best days of our lives
Crazy as it seems
