What can i give you

Words and Music by Margo Guryan

What can I give you
What would make you happy
What can I do
What can I say
To make the bad times go away

It's been a long, long time
Since I've seen you smile
And I've been wanting
To do something about it
For a long, real long while

What can I give you
To drive away the sadness
What can I buy
What can I try
Tell me what I can do

It's been a long, long time
And you know I knew you
When you used to be happy
What can I give you
To make you happy again
