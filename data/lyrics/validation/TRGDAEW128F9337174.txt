{crowd noise}
Ahh yeah
Oww!
Hit me band!
Oww! (Hey, hey)
Hit me band! (Yep)
From out of nowhere so they came
Smellin' like a dozen cans of wet Magic Shave (What's that funky smell?)
Some fool in a red mask totin' a one-eyed bass
Pulled it out, stuck it up the police officer's face and said...

CHORUS:
Bow down muthafucka, surrender your rod (Watch it nigga!)
Nothin' can save U unless His name is God
U better get your house in order, it's gettin' late (Move nigga!)
The return of the bump squad is comin' your way (Hey, hey)

Get off me jigger before I get perturbed
Find a job, lose the herb (Stop smokin', oh no!)
24 half eaten chicken legs (Can't do that!)
Make U wanna holler, make U beg (Yep)

U don't understand where I'm comin' from
I don't want your woman if she's acting dumb
She ain't got no money, so how she gonna pay?
If the girl can't have it when they grab a hold of me and say...

Bow down muthafucka, surrender your rod (Watch it nigga!)
Nothin' can save U unless His name is God
U better get your house in order, I said it's gettin' late (Move nigga!)
The return of the bump squad is comin' your way (Hey, hey)

Hey, come on
Hey
Mmm, come on

Another house party is running late (Damn!)
Nona's in the backyard, but she got 2 wait (Really though?) (Move nigga!)
She's got 2 get free y'all so she can sell her tape
Add an E 2 rap (What?), and it spells rape
Mmm hmm

Come on baby, wake up
I'm sleepy (Nothin' can save ya!)
Come on, let me lick your nipple
I... I got a headache (Nothin' can save ya!)
Oww!

Bow down muthafucka
The return of the bump squad
Bow down, bow down, mmm
It's coming your way

Calmate, mi hijo {Take it easy, man}
No vayas tan duro {Don't do it so hard}
Estas caderas estan hechas para el amor
{These hips are made 4 love}
Oye, espera un segundo! {Hey listen, wait a minute!}
Tu eres como un cono! {U are like a pussy!}

{repeat "Nona" in the BG}
Bow down muthafucka, surrender your rod
Nothin' can save U unless His name is God
U better get your house in order, it's gettin' late
The return of the bump squad is comin' your way

(Hey girls, come on up here)
Add that E 2 rap, what's it spell?
Bow down muthafucka (Awww shit!)
U heard them niggas said bow down

Bow down muthafucka, surrender your rod
(Nona, U wanna sell that tape?)
Nothin' can save U unless His name is God
(Ha ha, U know she do)
U better get your house in order, it's gettin' late
The return of the bump squad is comin' your way

Y'all hold that groove 4 a while while I pull out the good book
(Chill out nigga, we don't need that shit!)
As they journey from the Mt. Horeb by the way of the Red sea
(Broke ass muthafucka, ha ha ha)
2 compass the Land of Edom
And the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way
(Wanna holler)
And the people spake against God and against Moses
(Wanna holler)
Wherefore have ye brought us up 2 Egypt 2 die in the wilderness
(Wanna holler)

So we sayin' y'all U can bump, but U best get your house in order
And get back in the music books U no changin' juvenile delinquent ass jiggers
And turn that loop off, damn!

(Yep)
Hey Sonny? (What man?)
Ain't y'all got a record player? (Yep)
Well, why the hell don't U use them?
I'm tired of hearin' the same damn records all the fuckin' time! (Yep)

Return of the bump squad {repeat}
(Bow down muthafucka!)
(Bow down!) (Yep)
(Bow down muthafucka!)
(Bow down!)

(CHORUS)
