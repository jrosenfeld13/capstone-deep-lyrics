Here we are in the here and now
All I can see is what's in front of me
All I know is what you tell me now
All I know is what you tell me now
So tell me now

I'll continue on I know somehow
I can't remember how it felt just then
I can't seem to remember when
I can't seem to remember when
Even then

Did it feel the way it should?
Did it feel really good?
I want to be back there now
Wish I could then you would

Wonder if you held me tight
And did you shield me from my fright?
Where are you now?
Where are you now...
Are you now?

All I can see is what's in front of me
All I know is what you tell me now
It doesn't seem the same somehow

All I can see is what's in front of me
All I know is what you tell me now
It doesn't seem the same somehow

In the here and now

Now and then
In the here and now
Now and then

Did it feel the way it should?
Did it feel really good?
I want to be back there now
Wish I could then you would

Wonder if you held me tight
And did you shield me from my fright?
Where are you now?
Where are you now...
Are you now?

All I can see is what's in front of me
All I know is what you tell me now
It doesn't seem the same somehow

All I can see is what's in front of me
All I know is what you tell me now
It doesn't seem the same somehow

In the here and now
Now and then
In the here and now
Now and then
In the here and now - here and now
Now and then - now and then
In the here and now - here and now
Now and then - now and then.... now
