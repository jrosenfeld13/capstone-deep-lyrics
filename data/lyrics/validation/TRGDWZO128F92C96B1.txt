Have I been left here alone to die?
I know I?m breathing but am I alive?
Check my vital signs before they disappear
Oh God are You near?

I am in distress, come and save my life
This is my S.O.S. screaming up to the sky
Holy Father make us whole
?Cause You alone can save our souls

Precious time is tickin' away
And all that I can do is pray
?Cause this is sink or swim and I am lost at sea
Oh God rescue me

I am in distress, come and save my life
This is my S.O.S. screaming up to the sky
Holy Father make us whole
?Cause You alone can save our souls

My cry for redemption
I'm a dying breed
Give me salvation
You?re the one I need

I am in distress, come and save my life
This is my S.O.S. screaming up to the sky
Holy Father make us whole
?Cause You alone can save our souls
Can save our souls
