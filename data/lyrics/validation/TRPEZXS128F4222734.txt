Well I love the sound when I smash the glass
If I get caught they're gonna kick my ass
My mommy's worried about the way I drink
My daddy can't figure out the way I think
They wake me up, tell me, to get to work
I slam the door, say, shut up you jerk
I can't wait 'til the show tonight
When I'm with my friends every things alright

They're telling me, but I'm telling them
I'll do it my way, I'll always win
When the sun goes down I'm ready to play
It doesn't matter what anybody says

Well I love the sound when I smash the glass
If I get caught they're gonna kick my ass
My girls stands very close to me
That's just where I want her to be
They say it costs $6 to get in this shack
I'll go around sneak in the back
I hope the police don't show up here
Then we'll have to hide out of fear
