Watching you sleep for so long
Knowing that I can't turn the rain into sun any more
I've given you all that I have
Now I stand here, too scared to hold your hand

Afraid you might wake to see
The monster that had to leave

'Cause you see the shelter as the storm
Holding wind to keep you on
You are everything to me, this is why I have to leave
So sleep well my angel

Under the ash and the lies
Something beautiful once here now dies
And the tears burn my eyes
As you sit there, all alone
I just want to come home

But you see the shelter as the storm
Holding wind to keep you on
You are everything to me, this is why I have to leave

So sleep well my angel
Sleep well, my angel

I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry

You see the shelter as the storm
Holding wind to keep you on
You are everything to me, this is why

You see the shelter as the storm
Holding wind to keep you on
You are everything to me, this is why I have to leave
So sleep well, my angel

Sleep well, my angel
