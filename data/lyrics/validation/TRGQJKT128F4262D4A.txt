Now I thought it over how it's come to this
I must have lost all my common sense
I been chasin' a dream runnin' through my mind
So I called her up to say how I felt
Just before I could get it out she was gone, the silence was on
She didn't hear a word, she just hung up the phone

Chorus:
Operator, operator, could you be so kind
As to reconnect this number, I just spent my last dime
She's got my love on hold and my heart is on the line

Well I was always just one step ahead
Just close to keep my fingers wet
I been actin a fool and foolin no one but myself
But now I'm ready to talk if you're willing to hear
The choice of words is my biggest fear, I'd say anything, yes I would, just to change your mind
You've got my love on hold and my heart is on the line

Chorus

Chorus
