I can't find you, still I call you
Maybe it's simply too late
My intuition slowly strangles...
I can always see your face as
You described the dream that
I once whispered to you
While you were away in dreamland...

He's not amongst us now, they say
He's gone, his soul is faraway
Tell me just where were you
When I really needed you?
I can't hear the noises that surround
Or see all the light that so astounds
I'm slowly sinking down
And soon I'll surely drown

A bleeding moon in my soul
Shines on streams of tears
Sorrow lingers on both shores
Staring right at me
