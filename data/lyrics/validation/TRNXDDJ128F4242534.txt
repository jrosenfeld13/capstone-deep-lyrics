You were like a flower
Bloomed for all year
You were like a spring rain
Like unfinished ray of sunlight on my face

You disappeared over the curtain of evil
You were closed like a turtle in rain
You escaped beneath your mind drown in fever
Let me improve my love to you!

With the rain you fall
Just into my arms

How many wars you had to survive?
How many rivers you had to cross?
Don't walk away
Let's stay together
From now to forever!

The more you love
The more you suffer
In my eyes full of your smiles
Only one picture shining all night
Me on the floor and this crying - child!
