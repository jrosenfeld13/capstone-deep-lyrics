[Verse 1]
Cyrus Jones 1810 to 1913
Made his great grandchildren believe
He could live to a 103
A hundred and three is forever when you're just a little kid
So, Cyrus Jones lived forever

[Chorus]
Gravedigger
When you dig my grave
Could you make it shallow
So that I can feel the rain
Gravedigger

[Verse 2]
Muriel Stonewall 1903 to 1954
She lost both of her babies in the second great war
Now, you should never have to watch your only children lowered in the ground
That means you should never have to bury your own babies

[Chorus]
Gravedigger
When you dig my grave
Could you make it shallow
So that I can feel the rain
Gravedigger

[Bridge]
Ring around the rosey
Pocket full o'posey
Ashes to ashes
We all fall down

[Chorus]

[Verse  3]
Little Mikey Carson '67 to '75
He rode his bike like the devil until the day he died
When he grows up he wants to be Mr. Vertigo on the flying trapeze
Oh, 1940 to 1992

[Chorus][3x]
Gravedigger
When you dig my grave
Could you make it shallow
So that I can feel the rain
Gravedigger
