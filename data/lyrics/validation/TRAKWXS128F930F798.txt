Though I heard you say you love me
It pains me to say this
But I have a Question
Would You love me, if you could see me?
Would you love me, if you could hear me?
Would you love me, if I wasn't there?
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
Why do you..?
Why do?
WHY!?
Why do you love me....................?
