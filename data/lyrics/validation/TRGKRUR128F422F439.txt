Why don't we just subtract
All that's in the abstract
Let's erase our memories
Always heard the advice
Never look into the sunlight
But I just couldn't breathe

I went blind
I'm so afraid, I'm so worried
I went blind
Why was it such a hurry
Well the finer lines ....
Did see they'd gotten blurry
I went blind
I'm still afraid, I'm still worried

Still everyone is so uptight
Concerned about the afterlife
Will it be what you want it to be
Maybe God's just a night light

Who's there to help us sleep so tight
But that light's been turned off on me

I went blind
I'm so afraid, I'm so worried
I went blind
Why was it such a hurry
What have we got to lose
What are we running from
Suddenly, we're all confused
I never thought that I would have to choose
(I would have to choose)
Between rethinking and loving you

Cause I went blind
I'm so afraid, I'm so worried
I went blind
Why was it such a hurry
I went blind
I went blind
