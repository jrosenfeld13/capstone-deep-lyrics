[Verse One]
Have I told you lately that I love you?
Well, if I didn't, darlin', I'm sorry!
Did I reach out and hold you in my loving arms
Oh, when you needed me?

Now I realize that you need love, too
And I'll spend my life making love to you
Oh, I forgot to be your lover
And I'm sorry, I'm so sorry

[Verse Two]
Have I taken the time to share with you
All the burden that love will fare?
And have I done the little simple things to show you
Just how much I care?

Oh, I've been workin' for you doin' all I can
To work all the time didn't make me a man
Oh, I forgot to be your lover
And I'm sorry, I'll make it up to you somehow, baby

[Outro]
I forgot to be your lover
Gonna make it up to you somehow
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, baby
I forgot to be your lover

If you forgive me, I'll make it up to you
I'm only a man and I forgot
Oh, I forgot...
