I've met that point in my life
Want came to need
Burn these fields of corn, that surround
My harvest gone at the price of maturity
But these remains I've left to rot will be resurrected again and again
By the next generation of children who want to change minds with the stain on hand
But, it's deeper than this, I'm not the only one who sees
It lies in diversity; acceptance to a degree, only to a degree
The fire that once occupied my eyes has spread to destroy this world I have grown
You have nothing new to scream beyond your fields
And not a second of patience to learn from me the same
This time I harvest the crops of my past
As far as the demigods are concerned
I've sold myself out just the same
I've burned bridges to feign brothers
Brothers of nothing more than a simple label
So now, I'm in control after all, for myself I prove I still am
But within these fields, they'll say I never was
