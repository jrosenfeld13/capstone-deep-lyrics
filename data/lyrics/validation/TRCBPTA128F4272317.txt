He just caught the Jamestown Ferry
It's not a hot day in January
Like he said it'd be
If he ever left me
A case of gone was all he carried
As he got on the Jamestown Ferry
He said that gone was all he'd ever be

I didn't think that he'd leave me
After saying how much he needs me
But the fact still remains
I'm sittin' here all alone
Missin' the lovin' of my baby
Lord it's about to drive me crazy
He was the sweetest piece of heaven I've ever known

He just caught the Jamestown Ferry
It's not a hot day in January
Like he said it'd be
If he ever left me
A case of gone was all he carried
As he got on the Jamestown Ferry
He said that gone was all he'd ever be

As I walk through his kingdom
Of honkey-tonks and bars
I remember how he'd hold me
And comfort me with talk
He didn't cuss with every breath
He had a soothing southern drawl
Made me feel like a lady through it all

He just caught the Jamestown Ferry
It's not a hot day in January
Like he said it'd be
If he ever left me
A case of gone was all he carried
As he got on the Jamestown Ferry
He said that gone was all he'd ever be
He just caught the Jamestown Ferry

It's not a hot day in January
Like he said it'd be
If he ever left me
