The journey takes now many days and nights
Near the mountains, which stand majestic before them
They realise the wolvescry
"Listen my son, the first trial is near." [Narog]

An old majestic oak protects them for the crawling dusk
The cries come nearer and nearer
Pulsating blood is what the wolves are scenting
Raging desire drives them forward

[Ref.1]
A black wolf jumps out of the thicket
As fast as he can, Narog shots an arrow

Which smashes the wolves heart
Encouraged Tyrael takes a dagger

Side by side they fight against the beasts
Side by side a fight over life and death

Screams run through the dark, cold night
Blood splashed - swords splatter the bodies of the beasts

[Ref.2]
The moon let their claws glitter like steel
Their desire for fresh flesh was finished by a bloody fight

Side by side they defeat the beasts
Side by side they sow the ground with death

"Once my son will become a great warrior."
"Protect me from the beast
Give me power to defeat
This night and all nights which will come
Oh, my Master in Asgard, give me power for this run."
