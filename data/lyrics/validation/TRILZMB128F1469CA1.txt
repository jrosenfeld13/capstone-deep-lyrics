Don't tell me to stop crying
Please just hold me while I do
Soothe me with your silence
And just cradle me to you
Don't push me for my reasons
Or expect me to explain
How can I in five minutes
Shift a lifetime's hidden pain

CHORUS
Don't tell your girlfriend about me
Cause your girlfriend won't like girls like me
Don't tell your girlfriend about me
If you just hold me
Hold me
Hold me

I went to see a psychic
And I paid for good advice
She said forget a romance
Til you've sorted out your life
Be your own father and your mother
And your sister and brother
And even try to crack the art
Of being your own lover

CHORUS

In my darkest hour you'll be mine
Least while these dreams are no crime
Or are they
(girlfriend)
I'm in my proper place I believe
An overabundance
You see, you told me
(girlfriend)

Don't tell me to stop crying
Please just hold me while I do
Soothe me with your silence
And just cradle me to you
Don't push me for my reasons
Or expect me to explain
How come I stay unhappy
Til the ending of my pain

CHORUS
