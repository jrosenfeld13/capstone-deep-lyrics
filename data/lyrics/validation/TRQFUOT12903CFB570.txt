You've reached it
The final frontier
The grid is behind you
Yet the mind is blank

Encoded sunsets blind you
The centuries fade to seconds
Deleted time refusing shelter

Memories of skylines rising, falling
Descent towards a final core

A human hope poisoned from the skyline
Withheld to ease the backward march
Faith eclipsed by ignorance
Deleted time refusing shelter
Dismantled
