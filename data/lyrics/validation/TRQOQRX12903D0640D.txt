Power, it's in the air
I can feel it coming on strong
I am... stalking the street
You feel my hot breath on your back, yeah
Hungry, I'm hungry for love
My nature of the beast is wild
Beware, it's hot in the shade
You can run, but you can't hide
I'll be your wildest dream - I'm forever! (forever)
Riding the wings of storm
Are you ready? Aim, fire!

I am rock, harder than rock
My heart beats through the steel
Thunder and night, both back in the light
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

C'mon, I do you no harm
What you see is what you get
And I know, you can't stop thinking of me
I see what your dreams are made of
I'll put the spell on you forever (forever)
King of the mountain
Will you be my queen?

I am rock, harder than rock
My heart beats through the steel
Thunder and night, both back in the light
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

I am rock, harder than rock
My heart beats through the steel
Thunder and night, both back in the light
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

I am, I am rock [2x]
You know that
I am, I am rock
I am, I am, I am

I am rock, harder than rock
My heart beats through the steel
Thunder and night, both back in the light
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

I am rock!
