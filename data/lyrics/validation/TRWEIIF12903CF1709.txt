I wanna get drunk and pass out on the floor
Work myself into convulsions, beat my head against the door
I wanna cut my skin, cut it until I bleed
I wanna feel pain, it's the life that I lead

Abuse myself, I, I, I, I wanna abuse my body
Cut it deep, make it bleed
Throw my guts out on the floor
Cut my face until I, when I get knocked

I wanna die before I get old
Get fucked up, then die

I wanna die, die, die I wanna die
Kill me, motherfucker
I never died before
Bury me under the floor

Stick me in the heart, I ain't got one anyway
Stick me in the ass, that's the best part of me
Because I don't care if I live or die
It just don't matter, kill me anyway

I wanna abuse myself, yea
Shoot me, stab me, cut my throat
Hit me with a fucking axe, I just won't croak

Look me in the eyes and what do you see
Stab me in the eyes, you can piss on me
Kick me in the balls, I just don't care
Rip out my brains, pull my fucking hair

Abuse me, kick me, cut me 'till I bleed
Fuck me, kick me, shit on me
I just don't care you see

Destroy me, I wanna destroy you

I wanna die, I don't wanna get old
I don't wanna die old, I wanna die young
I wanna be a scumfuc and I wanna die young
Don't wanna play in no fucking 60's band

Kill me, rape me, do with me what you will
I'm gonna fuck a girl who doesn't take the pill
Maybe she'll have a little boy, or maybe a little girl
I really don't give a fuck, cause I'll be dead it's just another world

That's right, abuse me, kick me, cut me, stab me, axe me
Knife me, fork me, fuck me, suck me, beat me, fuck me
Blow me, eat me, stab me, abuse my body, abuse my body
