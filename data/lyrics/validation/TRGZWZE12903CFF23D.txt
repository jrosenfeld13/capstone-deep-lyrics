One step
Unwanted
One that
Would remain as not chosen
If not
It was because it was beyond control
I need to revive
The things that i killed
Blanks in my soul
Needs to be filled
Tragedy is on my side
Back in business
Back inside
Here i go
Deep and down again
Take me
There, way up high
Make me
Into the fire
Were ill burn into
Something new
One step
Much needed
That makes
You afraid and reluctant
You look
For every other possibility
But
Where you must go
Experience show
Things that you know
Are making you grow
