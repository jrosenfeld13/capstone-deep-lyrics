I'm broken hearted with all that this entails
It takes some concentrated drinking to keep me on the rails

I have to hide my face, I have to hide my shame
I don't wait til I'm sober til I get drunk again

I drink at home, I drink out
I drink in cocktail bars
Falling down, seeing stars

It suits me, it suits me
Falling apart in Mars
I like to suffer for my art
Just one more before we part

My oh my, we can't compete
It's only heavy drinking
That keeps us on our feet
And my oh my, we can't complain
If it weren't for heavy drinking
We'd never play Sweet Jane

And my my my my, the days go by
I'll never quite forget her
But goodness how I try

Believe me
Believe me
Going astray
When all the bars from here to Mandelay
They never close, we never pay

Don't like to think about how much I drink
It's a habit that's out of control
Oh yeah, hope I never get dry before I get old

Well my oh my, we can't compete
It's only heavy drinking
That keeps us on our feet
And my oh my, we can't complain
If it weren't for heavy drinking
We'd never play Sweet Jane

My my my my, the days go by
I'll never quite forget her
But goodness how I try

Believe me, believe me
Falling apart in Mars
I like to suffer for my art
Just one more before we part

Don't like to think about how much I drink
It's a habit that's out of control
Oh yeah, hope I never get dry
Hope I never get dry now
Hope I never get dry before I get old
