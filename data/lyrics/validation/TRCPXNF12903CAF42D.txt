Maybe its too easily fit
No problems are as hard as before
Look for me under the pillows
Hiding from self-created danger
Sucking the dust

For what's left
Well go on
I'm the last to know
But don't ask me if it hurts
For I don't know
I've lost sense of pain
Or I just don't give a damn

What do you care anyway
You always second-hand me

I'm like a spare tire
Who is used
When the first one breaks
Sorry if I'm out of style
I never meant to be in your way
Tell me when I'm gone too far
I slipped and I grabbed the first thing
I could find you
I would have done the same
I looked out of the window
But I've been away for too long this time

Probably I'm too blame
For almost everything

I know sometimes I behave like a monster
But please don't walk away
You can keep me in your basement
As long as I can be with you

I'm pleased with that
