It's nice to hear you're having a good time
But it still hurts cause you used to be mine
This doesn't mean that I possessed you
You're haunting me because I let you

Shape up your body, let's be a tree
Visual dynamics for you to see
Nature intended the abstract for you and me

No rain outside but tears in my eyes
Out on the rooftop for a surprise
Call you at teatime
In off the street
Sit down at table, Mummy is neat
