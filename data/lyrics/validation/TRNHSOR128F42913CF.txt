So I sit and wait
For time to pass
For you to brake these chords
Bless me with distortion

I stay up
Wait for things to change
Hoping for that single call
To tell me I'm ok

Will you slay me?
Will you let go (already)
I can't cope this
I am fading

I walk in circles, forever
Charging up
Everything pass me by
I am the liar, in this deception
As well as the deceived
Open up
Shut me in
I need you, now get out

Won't you kill me?
Will you let go (already)
I can't cope this
I am hollow
