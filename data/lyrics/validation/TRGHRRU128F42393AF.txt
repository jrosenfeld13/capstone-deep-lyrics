[Verse 1]
The words are coming, I feel terrible
Is it typical for us to end like this?
Am I just another scene from a movie that you've seen
One hundred times?
Cause baby you weren't the first or the last or the worst
And I've got to fill the blanks in the past with a verse
And we could sit around and cry but frankly
You're not worth it anymore

[Chorus]
So say hello to all the boys at the top
Of this table that you're under
Lipstick lullabies
This is sorry for the last time
And baby I understand that you're making new friends
This is how you get by
The moral this time is:
Girls make boys cry, and I...

On any other day I'd shoot the boy
But your simple toy had caused a scene like this
Leave him hanging on the walls, just a picture in the hall
Like a hundred more (like a hundred more)
Consider this as a gift as you taste him on your lips
And he's making you scream with his hands on your hips
I hope he's leaving you empty baby this is just a fix
Such a simple little whore

[Chorus]
So say hello to all the boys at the top
Of this table that you're under
Lipstick lullabies
This is sorry for the last time
And baby I understand that you're making new friends
This is how you get by
The moral this time is:
Girls make boys cry, and I

[Bridge]
And your name remains the same
All that has changed is this pretty face

So pull the trigger, it never gets closer
You want to start over, never start over
Pull the trigger, it never gets closer
You want to start over, but never start over

[Chorus]
So say hello to all the boys at the top
Of this table that you're under
Lipstick lullabies
This is sorry for the last time
And baby I understand that you're making new friends
This is how you get by
The moral this time is:
Girls make boys cry, and I

Say hello, say hello
Lipstick lullabies
This is sorry for the last time
And baby I understand how you're making new friends
This is how you get by
The moral this time is:
Girls make boys cry and...
