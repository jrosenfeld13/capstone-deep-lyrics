I can't believe I made it here
Today I'm afraid of yesterday
I wrote this letter to you my dear
Incase, afraid, this fades away

I say baby, babe I've loved you a long time
I try harder just to know you're all mine
I say baby, babe I've loved you a long time
I go happy knowing that you're alright

I called today but missed you again
Todays the day I go up in flames
I sent the money to you my dear
Todays the day I burn away

I say baby, babe I've loved you a long time
I try harder just to know you're all mine
I say baby, babe I've loved you a long time
I go happy knowing that you're alright

I say baby, babe I've loved you a long time
I try harder just to know you're all mine
I say baby, babe I've loved you a long time
I go happy knowing that you're alright
