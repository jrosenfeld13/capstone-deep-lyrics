(Rudy Clark)

If you got to make a fool of somebody
If you got to make a fool of someone
Do you really gotta hurt me?
I'm the one that'll worry

If you got to make a fool of somebody
If you got to make a fool of someone
Do you really gotta hurt me?
'Cause I'm the one that'll worry

Daytime, nighttime, anytime at all
I'll be there waiting, anytime you call
Just to be near you
You know that anywhere I'll go
How could you hurt me so?

If you got to make a fool of somebody
If you got to make a fool of someone
Do you really gotta hurt me?
'Cause I'm the one that'll worry

I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one, I'm the one
