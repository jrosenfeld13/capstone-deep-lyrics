Why do you give up, give up on everything?
My waiting arms used to be so fulfilling
The search to find a balance within ourselves
Can you hear this heart beat sincerity?

This is how I invite myself in
Never seen this side of you

There's no more surprises
I can't even catch my breath
Separate my jaw
I'm not coming back

Words can't explain what you did in exchange for the love that you stole from me
Theres a letter in the mail and if the postman fails then i fear that ill be alone

The sense of urgency
I've got to get rid of her ghost
Don't let me get carried away
A new rush that's waiting for me
The sense of urgency
I've got to get rid of her ghost
Don't let me get carried away
A new rush for me and it's waiting

We touched heaven in that doorway remember
Now all I do is fail to meet your expectations

Now I'm reading all my bible verses to be a better man with the world in my hands
But better men are gifted with a touch of softer hands
And I'm still breathing
There's no going back

I bet you already wrote me off as useless
What perfect timing, what perfect timing
You made your choice stop playing the role of redemption
This distance cries for a resolution
Take, keep taking, what will be enough for you?

The sense of urgency
I've got to get rid of her ghost
Don't let me get carried away
A new rush that's waiting for me
The sense of urgency
I've got to get rid of her ghost
Don't let me get carried away
A new rush for me and it's waiting

We'll wait for your return
