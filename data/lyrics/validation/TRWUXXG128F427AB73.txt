Youre looking for the right strings
Want to make a sound that sticks

My voice is looking for words and tones
That might wander around for a while

I leave a little of me for later on
A little of me for when Im gone
A little of me
I think its hard to leave

A little of me for when Im gone
A little of me for later on
Oh I think its hard to leave
