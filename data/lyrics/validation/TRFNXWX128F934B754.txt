Take my hand walk with me I wanna show you everything you missed I wanna show you how it came to this
I felt you slip away I never wanted it to end this way what could I say what could I fucking do
Wait for the day it all comes back to you
You'll never know what you have done I place my faith in no one
I'll never trust again
Fuck you
I've never felt this hopeless betrayed fucking alone
On my way straight down with no chance
No voice
Victim of pain
I brought this on my fucking self
So far from those I once held so close pushed aside from what I once called my own how could I reach this fucking low
I gave all I had with nothing to show the fact I couldn't see it coming I have no one to blame but myself
On my knees again on my knees again I felt you slip away
I never wanted it to end this way
