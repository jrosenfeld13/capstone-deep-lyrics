Far and wide I'll search for my baby
I won't let pride stand in my way
This heart inside will always love him

And somewhere some night
Among the neon lights
I'll find my baby

My only plan is to search again
Each night when lights are blue
I'd let him go but my heart knows
It's one thing I can't do

And somewhere some night
Among the neon lights
I'll find my baby

Alone tonight I see from my window
Those city lights you left me for

Are they still bright?
Or have they faded?

Well, give up the lights
And come back tonight
I need you, baby

My only plan is to search again
Each night when lights are blue
I'd let him go but my heart knows
It's one thing I can't do

And somewhere some night
Among the neon lights
I'll find my baby
