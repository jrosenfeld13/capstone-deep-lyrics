[Verse 1]
Driving through the night
Tears rollin' down my face
I start to realize all the things that I once said
I promised you the world, that's nothing more than you deserve
It's killing me inside, to know I put you through this hell

[Pre-Chorus]
Take away my heart, it doesn't wanna work no more
I never meant to make you cry

[Chorus]
California callin' 20 miles to go
And I don't, I don't know
Should I turn around or should I leave you alone?
No I don't, I don't know
I don't know
No I don't know
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Verse 2]
No one on the road and it feels so cold outside
It's driving me insane to know how much you hurt tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Take away my heart it doesn't wanna work no more
I never meant to make you cry

[Chorus]
California callin' 20 miles to go
And I don't, I don't know
Should I turn around or should I leave you alone?
No I don't, I don't know
California callin' 20 miles to go
And I don't, I don't know
I don't know, no I don't know

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
California callin' 20 miles to go
And I don't, I don't know
Should I turn around or should I leave you alone?
No I don't, I don't know
(California callin' 20 miles to go)
I don't know
No I don't know
(Should I turn around or should I leave you alone?)
I don't know (woo!)

[Outro]
Gotta keep on moving on
Gotta keep on moving on
Gotta keep on moving on
California callin' (California callin')
Gotta keep on moving on
Gotta keep on moving on
Gotta keep on moving on
California callin' (California callin')
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
