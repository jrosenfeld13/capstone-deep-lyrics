I burned easily since I was a boy
I opened my self to the darkest of joys
I'm asking for help cause I can't help myself
And now I'm diggin', diggin' an early grave

I've forgotten how to be myself
Keep my courage boxed up on a shelf
Why is everything I want always something I can't have?
So I'm diggin', diggin' an early grave

Diggin', diggin', diggin' an early grave
Diggin', diggin', diggin' an early grave
Diggin', diggin', diggin' an early grave

Down I fell through a hole in the stairs
Crashing through hallways and old armchairs
It's hard to hold on to things when you keep on falling
And now I'm diggin', diggin', an early grave

Diggin', diggin', diggin' an early grave
Diggin', diggin', diggin' an early grave
Diggin', diggin', diggin' an early grave

I'm diggin'...

If you see me I'll be
Diggin', diggin', diggin' an early grave
Diggin', diggin', diggin' an early grave
Diggin', diggin', diggin' an early grave

Diggin', diggin', diggin' an early grave
Diggin', diggin', diggin' an early grave
Diggin', diggin', diggin' an early grave

Diggin', diggin', diggin' an early grave
Diggin', diggin', diggin' an early grave
Diggin', diggin', diggin' an early grave

Keep diggin'... down... down... down...
