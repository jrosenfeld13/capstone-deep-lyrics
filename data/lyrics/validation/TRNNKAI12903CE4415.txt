I checked the pilot lights and double-checked all the locks
But the captain's asleep at the wheel
We're heading straight for the rocks
I've got the anxiety blocked
Nose to the grindstone, both eyes on the clock
It's a matter of trust
They want to re-write the history books
They want to turn back the clocks
Just leave your hope at the ballot box
And leave the wolf in charge of tending the flock
Make no mistake, they watch every move that we make
