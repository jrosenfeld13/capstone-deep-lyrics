In goodness wake I'll always say I do
That it's all for you
And tricks I'd turn would always shine right through
But it's all for you

Like a stream overflowing
Unpredictable
A new confidence like a new king
Like a breeze levitating
To raise a sunken soul
And to the surface shines like a new pin

What junkie says is not what junkie do
But it's all for you
And the tricks he turns will always shine right through
But it's all for you

Like a dream synchronising
With the one I missed the most
A concentrated love from a new queen
Like a wave stabilising
I walk a tighter rope
And my new victim shines like a new pin
I can feel lies within the
Gospels that I'm sold
The tactless sentiments are a new pain

But it's all for you
