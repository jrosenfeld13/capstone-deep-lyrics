Yeah

[Rashad Houghton]
You and me got to be
Living life, dignity, integrity, sincerity
Cause honestly thats how its got to be
And when you come to that fork in the road
Which way will you go

[nfamous]
Got get your destiny
Yeah thats what my god advised
Dont be resistently
Seek someone to help us grow wise
Cause mentally, spirtual excellence
Is far beyond any Physical (?)
Acceptance is great, yeah
But it will be a brittle case
Trying to please all
And find a middle space
Where you belong
As a little kid I dreamt intense dreams
Now as a grown man, these same intense dreams
Are what I'm chasing
Feel a man amazing, right
But I can't see how my life
May have fallen by the waist side

Scenario one
Hanging with mates who like to stay high
Fucking up, going out, acting up, getting drunk
Chucking up, acting tough, far too much got me copping upper cuts
While though they keep me snacked up
Killing my soul while I'm high
Head to toe
But I'm only talking about a possible scenario

[Rashad Houghton]
You and me got to be
Living life, dignity, integrity, sencerity
Cause honestly thats how its got to be
And when you come to that fork in the road
Which way will you go

[nfamous]
Scenario two
What would I do
Not amused
Sitution I'm facing
Got me confused
Back to me and my girl in high school
Both 16 years of age
Doing what lovers do
Confusing independance with ignorance
Having unprotected sex
Now she falling pregnant
Now we stressing bout how our parents going to act
Will they kick us out of the house
Or will they have our backs
To bring a child into this messy world
Could be no more going out
No money for me or my gal

Scenario Three
We get rid of the child
Before we get to hear it laugh
Or see a smile
Live with the grief and keep the pain underneath
Like six feet deep may it rest in peace
Whats to become of us
God only knows
But you know
I'm only talking bout a possible scenario

[Rashad Houghton]
You and me got to be
Living life, dignity, integrity, sencerity
Cause honestly thats how its got to be
And when you come to that fork in the road
Which way will you go

Life moves on. life flys by
Life talking flash back
At the blink of an eye
You and I had best be aware
You and I had best be prepared

[nfamous]
The future said
That only a believedant man
Can live a full life and
Draw accurate plans
To understand
Why I choose scenario four
That be the life I'm living now
The life I'd die for
Maybe I might score the top of the list
Maybe I might fall but I'm ready for this
Like being offered bullshit
This steams the cream
A million dollars for my soul
Or a priceless dream

[Rashad Houghton]
Faith is a Red Rose, is a red rose
Almost a thought
But it will grow

[Rashad Houghton]
You and me got to be
Living life, dignity, integrity, sincerity
Cause honestly thats how its got to be
And when you come to that fork in the road
Which way will you go
