A million guys they want freestyle
There will be ... freestyle
This style is not free
The style is expensive alright
Hold tight truth

Love of self I possess
Thru life 2 death
Yiggy yar yesome
It's da upfront fresh
My level is seldom seen
Few and far between
Them fools they couldn't
Douse my keen
Lean 2 da mean
Thoroughbread
Pickyhead
Slapped in the face trap down I get
Sunset to sunset
We don't sweat yet
Cool we don't fret
While the dubs dem hold me
I'm picky with precision
I made my decision that
Death it's self
Can't hold this down
Coz the seeds of progress
Them done get sow
My tuff back
Broke the cane in four
Face flat to the floor
But I found the strength
To commence with a brand new
Sense of self
Euro-Zulu
Coming through
Tokyo dream-style
Hipper 2 da crew

Down like dirt man we
Dusted (Get up)
Down like dirt, man, we
Dusted (Get up)

Tougher then my cuts in my
Rebel-like flex
But I won't waste my breath
I let action speak
Though this feat stands
Taller than the peak of Everest
I visualise embrace
The progress
Chin high puff chest
I step right to it
The choice is there is no choice
But to pursue it
Soul on the mind
Mind on the soul
My struggle remains
But my insight grows

Down like dirt man we
Dusted (Get up)
Down like dirt man we
Dusted (Get up)
Down like dirt man we
Dusted (Get up)
Down like dirt man we dusted
(Against the grain, we shall remain)

Yeah
Steamin' on
Super-con-duper
Sub-low to Sunday

Gaining nuff girth
Gaining nuff ground
Movement tight
Planet-wide flight
Inner sight set 2 step to the height
Left of the field now
Looking good
Wed to this wayward bounce
Proud pronounce
I'm steadfast
Stuck in my way
I heed not no hearsay
I put my trust in my own
Perceptions of knowledge of self

Down like dirt man we
Dusted (Get up)
Down like dirt man we
Dusted (Get up)
Down like dirt man we
Dusted( Get up)
Down like dirt man we
Dusted
(Get yourself into harder)

The power of the inner eye, huh
That's the strength for we

Groove, word, birth to the next realm

Motions splendid, it bring quality
Now my foresight sees with nuff clarity
Motions splendid, it bring quality
Now my foresight sees with nuff clarity

Hold tight
