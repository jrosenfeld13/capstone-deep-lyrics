My future seems so full of life
And brighter now than it has ever been
But somehow I just can't allow
My shell to crack
And let the sun shine in...

Today I feel so sick
Today I feel comfortable with this
If I should die before you
I'll always be around to guide you
In your center you'll find me
And in the sky as a star still shining

But if I can't pick myself back up
Just enough to see above the haze
My family buries the middle son
The church bells ring
They don't know what to say...
They don't say anything at all...

Today I feel so sick
If I should die before you
I'll always be around to guide you
In your center you'll find me
And in the sky as a star still shining

The silence takes control of me
There's violence in my circuitry
And one day I won't feel so sick
But first comes the fall...

If I should die before you
I'll always be around to guide you
In your center you'll find me
And in the sky as a star still shining

In the sky as a star...
In the sky as a star...
In the sky as a star...
In the sky as star still shining
