I've been waiting to be loved so long
Didn't think that I could carry on
Alone, all by myself
I really thought that love was so unkind
But now you're here you've opened up my mind
And baby, now I believe
That I, can fly, so high
Now that you're here with me

Chorus:
I believe in loving baby
Take your time
Don't you know you drive me crazy
Free your mind
And let it flow
Let love reveal the truth girl
I need your loving now so maybe
Now's the time
If you're strong enough baby
For you to read the signs
And let it show
We're learning the language of love
I couldn't live a life of loneliness
Now you've changed my life I must confess to you
I feel so good
You're the one that makes my world go round
I'm addicted to the love I found in you girl
Now I believe
That I, can fly, so high
Now that you're here with me
Chorus
Life can be so unkind
Play tricks on your mind
The language of love is what makes you shine
You'll be just fine
Now that you're here with me
I believe in loving baby
Take your time
Don't you know you drive me crazy
Free your mind
And let it flow
You gotta roll with it, you gotta go with it
Let love reveal the truth girl
I need your loving now so maybe
Now's the time
For you to read the signs
And let it show
You gotta roll with it, you gotta go with it
We're learning the language of love
