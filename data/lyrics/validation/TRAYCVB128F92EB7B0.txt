[INTRO:]
Check it out, ya'll
(There've been times in my life)
I'm tired and I wanna give up
(I've been wondering why)
Why is the world gettin' so crazy?
(Still, somehow I believe)
I've come too far to die now
(I always survive)
If you're a survivor, get up!
Let's get it!

[VERSE 1:]
Gonna cry now, go ahead and get it out of my system
I know I hurt now, but soon I gotta get back to livin'
Can't be here next year, givin' you these same tears
I hope you enjoyed it, cause it's the last time you will take a piece of me

I start right now, I don't know how I'm gonna get thru it
I know right now, I pray somehow cause I can't do it
I can't keep livin' like this, there's gotta be more than this
Jesus, I'm ready, I'm ready for what you have for me

[Chorus:]
(Are you gonna wait for a sign?)
Are you ready for youe miracle
God's people it's time to (Stand up and fight)
Let's get it, let's get it (This is it!!)
You can't mess with my mind anymore (This is it!!)
I'm smarter, see I've been here before (This is it!!)
It's time today, I'm not afraid anymore(This is it!!)
Yes, I believe, if you believe, help me say (This is it!!)
I'm a child of the King baby, look at somebody and tell 'em (This is it!!)

[VERSE 2:]
I look back now, I look at how you tried to break me
To take my life, my peace of mind and drive me crazy
My self esteem, my dreams, my destiny
So, God allowed it, because He knew He had big plans for me (Hallelujah!)
It's your grace, I know today it's how I made it (Thank You, Jesus)
When I thought that it was over' (Lord, have mercy)

[Chorus:]
(Are you gonna wait for a sign?)
Are you ready for youe miracle
God's people it's time to (Stand up and fight)
Let's get it, let's get it (This is it!!)
You can't mess with my mind anymore (This is it!!)
I'm smarter, see I've been here before (This is it!!)
It's time today, I'm not afraid anymore(This is it!!)
Yes, I believe, if you believe, help me say (This is it!!)
I'm a child of the King baby, look at somebody and tell 'em (This is it!!)

Everybody that's been holdin' you down, look at 'em and tell 'em (This is it!)
I feel my help coming on right now, y'all

You think that maybe it's over (Your life ain't over)
Not unless you want it to be

(Are you gonna wait for a sign?)
You're a miracle (stand up and fight)

This is it ya'll, this is it ya'all
You've been waitin' and debating , here it is, ya'll
All your stuff from your past, shake it off ya'll
Though they said you wouldn't last, but who is ya'll?
Want your dreams back? Let's get it!
Your peace of mind back? Let's get it!
Want your family back? Let's get it!
Are you ready? Let's get it! (This is it!)
