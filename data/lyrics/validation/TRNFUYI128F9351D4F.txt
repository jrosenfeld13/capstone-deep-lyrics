You hold your head up to the sky
You say what kind of blue
Are you? Are you?
Then you ride your pony round and round
Its diggin a hole, right through, right through

You stumble down a yellow brick road
Spinning your shoes in the air, the air

Then you, hold your breath, and count to nine
Hoping that soon somebody will find you, find you

Go on, go on, go on, the stars are watching
Just say, just say, just say, what youre feeling
You know, you know, you know, you gotta take a bow and do it your way
Its okay, ladadadadadadadada, its okay, ladadadadadadadada

Youre 15 miles over the speed
Youre going fast as you can after your daydream
Ohh

I might get sad, carried away
Or have a serious talk with your, champaign

Go on, go on, go on, the stars are watching
Just say, just say, just say, what youre feeling
You know, you know, you know, you gotta take a bow and do it your way
Its okay, ladadadadadadadada, its okay, ladadadadadadadada

Its time for you to prove
Within your ruby shoes
You deserve a smile with no regret
Look at you
Kicking off your shoes
Dancing for the world to see
You got the power to believe
Open up and see
And Ill be free and fly away

Go on, go on, go on, the stars are watching
Just say, just say, just say, what youre feeling
You know, you know, you know, you gotta take a bow and do it your way
Its okay, ladadadadadadadada, its okay, ladadadadadadadada
Its okay, ladada ladada, its okay, ladadadadadadadada
