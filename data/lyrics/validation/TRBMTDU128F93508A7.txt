My space is...
Ready to be taken

By the sweat up high
With the fucked up eyes
With the ugly face
The ugly face, the ugly face, the ugly face
The ugly THIGHS!
We all thought you'd lose
To the recorder grot and kick it!

Behind my back before you cross
Behind my back before you crash
Behind my back before you crack
Behind my back before you crack
Behind my back before you cross

Behind my back recorder grot
Behind my back recorder grot
Recorder grot, recorder grot
Grot!
