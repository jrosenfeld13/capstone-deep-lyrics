Dancing figures
Movement on the wall
It sears my eyes
Your shadows revolve

Don't cover your ears
From the screams
Don't grind my nails
Under your feet

Wait and see how I'll bleed
Follow me
My room is shadow and light

Rewrite my name
With your purity
Don't keep me restrained
Please don't dissolve me

Don't cover your ears
From the screams
Don't grind my nails
Under your feet

Wait and see how I'll bleed
Follow me
My room is shadow and light
