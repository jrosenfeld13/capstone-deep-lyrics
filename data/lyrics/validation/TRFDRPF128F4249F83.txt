No way, no way, no way

When I leave your door, when we say goodnight
It hurts me more and more
'Cause, girl, it just ain't right
To end the day like this

With no more than a kiss
And spend the night
Just dreaming of the things
We're gonna miss

If I have my way
Girl, we'd be together more
And more each day
We'd go on forever

Lovers, hand in hand
Can't you understand
Girl, you've got to be my woman
I've got to be your man

'Cause I can't get by without you
I need you more each day
The way I feel about you
Leaves nothing more to say

'Cause I love you
Girl, I need you
And I can't get by
Without you, no way

It's a sad affair
Wasting precious time
That you and I could share
Girl, it's such a crime

To hear you call my name
It's a crying shame
When we're not together
Then there's only time to blame

There will come a day
Girl, I do believe
It's not too far away
When I can say goodnight

And still be by your side
To dry the tears you cried
And I'll have all the love I need
To keep me satisfied

'Cause I can't get by without you
I need you more each day

I can't get by without you
I need you more each day

Can't get by without you
Can't get by without you
Can't get by without you

I can't get by without you
I need you more each day

I can't get by without you
I need you more each day
