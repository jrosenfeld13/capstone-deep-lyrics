Tabloid magazines are made in hell
The falling stars are getting sucked down
We get seduced, easy
We get
We get seduced!

Sell us magazines about the stars
And watch us stare into the void
What not to wear to the awards
Who's tit escaped on camera
Now these creeps are climbing up the trees
The neighbors calling the police
And snapping pictures by the pool
We get seduced so easy

Check out clerks all thumbing toward the page
"An A-list starlet shaved her brains"
While starving millionaires complain
TV makes your ass fat

Tell us!
How rad is it living in a microscope?
Broadcast into every single living room
Hot lights on your love life
Let me buy
Close up tabloid shots of your cellulite

Hypnotizing pages of advice
From their demented fashion do's or dies

Who put this hook inside my mouth...you
Your getting so obssesed its all we talk about
Were gossip hounds on the couch

How rad is it living in a microscope?
Broadcast into every single living room
Hot lights on your love life
It's not love thats sex on the first night

How rad is it living in a microscope?
Broadcast into every single living room
Hot lights on your love life
Let me buy
Close up tabloid shots of your cellulite
