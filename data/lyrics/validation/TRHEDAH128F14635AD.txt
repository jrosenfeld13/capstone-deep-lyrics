Like a fool I went and stayed too long
Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong

Ooo baby, here I am
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
Yeah

Then that time I went and said goodbye
Now I'm back and not ashamed to cry

Ooo baby, here I am
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
(I'll be yours)

Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours

Here I am baby, I am
(Signed, sealed, delivered)
I'm yours, baby

Done a lot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean, yeah

Ooo-wee babe you set my soul on fire
That's why I know you're my one desire

Ooo baby, here I am
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
(I'm yours)
Yeah

Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours

Done a lot of foolish things
(Done a lot)
That I really didn't mean
(Got a feeling)
I could be a broken man
(Here I am, here I am)

Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours, baby

Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours

I'm yours
I'm yours
(Everybody)
I'm yours
I'm yours
I'm yours

I'm yours
(I'm yours)
I'm yours
I'm yours
(Ooh, I'm yours)
I'm yours
(Remember I am yours)

Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
Here I am baby
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
Here I am baby
