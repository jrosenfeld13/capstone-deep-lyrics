Standing in isolation
Roadless wilderness
Faded and discarded
The last leaves' gone
Gone...
And let me tell you

Nothing ever changes
Nothing ever changes

Farewell to my first love
Farewell for all time
Pleasure for the loving
There they lie
Eye to eye..
And baby, baby

Nothing ever changes
Nothing ever changes

Lay down
Let it break down
The hidden tortures
To an end...

Nothing ever changes
Nothing ever changes
