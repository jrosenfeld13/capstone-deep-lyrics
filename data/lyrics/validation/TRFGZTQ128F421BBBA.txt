I have walked this road before
So hard to find unopened doors
Lost my way but I have to stay for a while
I'll be searching for more

And my wounds are real
I must rise from the sorrow
And find my way out of the dark
I've cried my tears from pain
There's a new day tomorrow
I'll turn the hourglass again

Feel and trust your inner voice
Chase your dream with desire
Show the scars you've been hiding deep inside
And reveal who you are

And your wounds are real
You must rise from the sorrow
And find your way out of the dark
Cry your tears from pain
Face a new day tomorrow
And turn the hourglass again

And my wounds are real
I must rise from the sorrow
And find my way out of the dark
I've cried my tears from pain
There's a new day tomorrow
I'll turn the hourglass again

Cry your tears from pain
Face a new day tomorrow
We'll turn the hourglass again
