Was he with you at the railway
Did he cradle all your pain
Did he show to you the best way
To make it all right again
Now there was reason in your madness
You weighed your loss against my gain
If he was with you at the railway
Would you do it all again

Mea culpa
I can't stay here no longer
Mea, mea culpa
My time here is up
So goodbye, goodbye and good luck

Was he with you on that journey
When you could have still turned back
Did he reason with you sternly
Did he try to make your resolve crack
Did he hold the only candle
When your whole bright sky turned black
Was he with you at the railway
As you climbed onto the track

Mea culpa
I can't stay here no longer
Mea, mea culpa
My time here is up
So goodbye, goodbye and good luck

Did he guide you across the threshold?
Did he cup you in his hands?
Did he drink you down like water?
Or blow you into air like sand?
Is he standing right beside you?
Did it work out how you planned?
Is the sunlight shining on you?
Are we saved or are we damned?

Mea culpa
I can't stay here no longer
Mea, mea culpa
My time here is up
So goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye and good luck
