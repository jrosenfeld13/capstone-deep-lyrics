Talkin' bout your vision
Of the so-called one and only girl
You never had long-term relations
You lived within a passion's whirl
You never knew

Was it love or just temptation
That's what should dawn on you
Love or just temptation

Now you're crazy 'bout a woman
You've got to know in these street cafes
And you speak of love at first sight
But the doubt is already written in your face
For your're not sure

Was it love or just temptation
That's what should dawn on you
Love or just temptation

If you alway go by sheer appearance
Appearance
You will not see you self-deceptions
Deceptions

Love or just temptation
I hope it will dawn on you
Love or just temptation

Say: love or just temptation
That's what should dawn on you
Love or just temptation
