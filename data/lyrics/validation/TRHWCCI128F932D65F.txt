Nothing else in common
Nothing else is coming at all
You don't talk about it
But you want having it all
I'm not just pretending
I just need a ch-ch-ch-chance
Maybe see you later
Maybe at the company dance

I can't play guitar
I can't play guitartonight

Doesn't get better
It doesn't get better than this
No, nothing gets better
Nothing gets better than this
And I know you got it
You guh-guh-got it, come on
Oh, maybe you got it
Maybe you got it all wrong

And I can't play guitar
Maybe I can't play guitartonight

Nothing is sacred
Nothing gets you high, anymore
Nothing is sacred
Nothing gets you high, anymore
Nothing is sacred
Nothing is sacred
Nothing is sacred
And nothing is sacred
Nothing is sacred
And nothing gets you high, anymore

I can't play guitar
Or harmonicafor shit
I love ityeah
