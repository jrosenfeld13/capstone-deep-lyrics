Everytime youre in my dream
I close my eyes
And youre there
Standing in a circle of stones
Storm clouds building up in the sky
Ripe fruit splits in the sun
Thunder rolls rainstorm comes
Can hardly bear this ecstasy
This strange hold you have on me

Chorus:
Everytime I see the red sun
Fall in an African sky
Youre always on my mind/everytime
Spinning me round in time/everytime
Every time I try to picture you
Beneath those cold northern skies
I see you walking by the River Lekwa
Your beauty burns the dusk like fire
Sacred rites from our sun-drunk days
Feel the power coming through
Hear flowing down my shivering limbs
Pulling my mind across the world
Across to you

(chorus)
Last light fades away
Darkness brings no comfort for my memories in dreams
I call you name
In dreams I read out and touch you
Oh, you already know
So dont turn away
Or make me explain
How the wind turns to steel
Cold hard and blue
When Im away from you
Youre always on my mind/everytime
Spinning me round in time/everytime
Everytime
Youre always on my mind/everytime
Spinning me round in time/everytime
Everytime (x4)
Heat flowing down my shivering limbs
Pulling my mind across the sky to you
