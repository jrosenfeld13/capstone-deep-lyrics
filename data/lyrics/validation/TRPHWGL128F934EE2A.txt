For each forgotten kiss, for all the memories
For all the times a look, said all we had to say
You played your part so well, a modern Romeo
You came on cupids wings, and then you flew away

When you touch my face, when you call my name
Im burned with desire, when you touch my face
When you call my name, Im burned with desire
But you left me in the rain...

For every sleepless night, forever in your arms
For every hour spent, lost in the revery
You broke your promises, no shame and no regrets
You burned the bridges too, an endless mystery

When you touch my face, when you call my name
Im burned with desire, when you touch my face
When you call my name, Im burned with desire
But you left me in the rain...
