[Verse 1]
Every little beat of your heart
Is only ever beating for the understudy's part
Leave all the flesh on your Parisian bones
Encourage your friends to stay home

[Verse 2]
Run with the wind at your back
Waiting only for your missing love to attack
You dig your own holes, you're left with nowhere to go
Ashamed to be afraid to go home

[Pre-Chorus]
But if it only makes you feel alright
The hardest thing you have to say
Is one by one, kiss them all goodbye

[Chorus]
I never thought you'd ever be the kind of man
To volunteer for a weekend of mystery
You never had any anyway
I never thought you'd ever done quite enough
To qualify as a victim of history
You just don't team your style
You never had any anyway
Never had any anyway

[Verse 3]
No one likes a porch light the mend
Mourning for a promise, never beckoned, never sent
"I'm sorry, I guess" is all that I really know
It's a shame you're gonna end up alone

[Pre-Chorus]
But if it only makes you feel alright
The hardest thing you have to say
Is one by one, kiss them all goodbye

[Chorus]
I never thought you'd ever be the kind of man
To volunteer for a weekend of mystery
You never had any anyway
I never thought you'd ever done quite enough
To qualify as a victim of history
You just don't team your style
You never had any anyway
Never had any anyway
Never had any anyway
Never had any anyway
