[Verse 1]
Its a good thing youve got that artificial heart
Turn it on or turn it off
And expect your friends to repeat the same alcoholic lines
Youre running on alkaline
A hollow chest no better than mine

[Verse 2]
Ive finally found the time
To put two-and-two and you together
Writing one more song thats bitter
Youre a quitter
So, dont even bother

[Verse 3]
How do you sleep at night?
How do you look yourself in the eyes?
How do you sleep at night?
(I wake up[tight])
I wait for the batteries to die
