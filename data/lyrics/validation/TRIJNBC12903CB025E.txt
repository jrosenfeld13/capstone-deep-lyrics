And you said we were thru but I already knew
It was over

Now it's all I can do, just to keep my promise to you
So Lover come back

Back to the arms of the one who let you down
Needs to hold you

I know I'm not an easy man but I'll do anything I can
Just to hold you

Lover come back
Lover come back
Come on home

First you say that we'll try
Then you say it's goodbye
If I thought that you might
I would wait here all night

I feel a shadow cross my heart
I hear an echo of your voice in my mind
Now it's tearing me apart
'cause I've loved you for such a long time

Lover come back
Come back
Come on home

Lover come back
Lover come back
Come on home
Lover come back
Lover come back
Lover come back
Ohhh, Lover come back
Lover come home
Lover come back
Lover come back
Come on home
Lover come back
Come back
Come on home
Come on home
Come on home
Lover come home
Come on home
Come on home
Come on home
Come on home
Lover come back
Lover come back
