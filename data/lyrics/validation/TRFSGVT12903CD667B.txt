Oh she is watching me
And her eyes they flow
With fond and tender pain, I know
Fate laid out a road
We have walked alone (And) yet meet again

Now I know finally I've never been alone
Ijust couldn't see, That like
The swirling of the sea, Lies a mistery
That brings me back to you

Oh, We put round our world
Chains that we denied
Yes we dreamed that we, Were free
And this was our downfall, With no place to go
We drift eternally

Now, I know finally, I've never been alone
I just couldn't see, That like
The swirling of the sea
Lies a mistery, That brings me back to you
