Won't you let up baby, but I couldn't say it all
Was it I wrote too little, or was it I said too much, too much
And they say that a real man, can open up his heart
All I know is it's true love, makes me cry when we're apart

Oh, it's hurting me, it's killing me, it's breaking me in two
I've gotta find a connection, gotta pull something through
I'm begging you, I'm pleading you, down on my knees
Oh yeah, come on home baby, bring your love to me

Dialed your number, but I couldn't make the call
But, would you answer, you wouldn't speak to me at all
No, no, no, no, no
And they say that a real man, faces troubles head-on
All I know is in my eyes, you can do no wrong

It's hurting me, it's killing me, it's breaking me in two
I've gotta find a connection, gotta pull something through
I'm begging you, I'm pleading you, down on my knees
Yeah, come on home baby, bring your love to me

And they say that a real man, who can make it on his own
And all I know is that this man, doesn't want to be alone

Oh, it's hurting me, it's killing me, it's breaking me in two
I've gotta find a connection, gotta pull something through
I'm begging you, I'm pleading you, down on my knees
Yeah, come on home baby, bring your love

Oh, it's hurting me
Oh, it's killing me
Down on my knees...
Oh yeah!
