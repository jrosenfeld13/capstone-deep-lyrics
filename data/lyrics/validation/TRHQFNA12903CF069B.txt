This ain't Passover or nothing but I can feel that my time is here
My failings are adding up again, my fever's burning up again
It pulls you under ground. Remember what it used to be like?
When we all led lonely lives. It's terror that keeps us all in line
Still we're running towards nothing; don't you know it never works out right?
The soul slowly fades away and nothing seems the same anymore since you left through that door
Feel so unperfect even though you're perfect. Don't you know that I'd give it all up for you?
Still you're waiting for nothing
She: Please do that thing you wanted me to do
He: Where's that person I met when I met you?
