[Verse 1]
Though the water boils
Don't turn off the heat

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't find the spoon that we once had
The sugar cubes will melt no more

[Chorus]
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together

[Verse 2]
How can you take my soul
Stop, I need a new beat

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't find the spoon that we once had
The sugar cubes will melt no more

[Chorus]
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't find the spoon that we once had
The sugar cubes will melt no more

[Chorus]
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
We belong as two, two together
