You see me
It's not me
It's something underneath my skin
I wanna tear it all away
And show the beauty that's within
Begin to
Come unglued
And throw away the older me
Just give it time and then
You'll see

CHORUS:
I wanna be a butterfly
Flying in the sky
With you, today
I wanna lose this old caccoon
I wanna do it soon
And fly away, away

So tired of always crawlin up the tree
To fall back down again
This lonely place where i began
It's not the place I'm gonna end --
Up so before you sum up all
The missing pieces of my head
There's so much further I can get

(Repeat CHORUS)
Your wind is underneath my wing
It carries me away
It's you --
--My God --
That makes me sing
When I'm on my way
Change a little every day

(Repeat CHORUS)
You take what's old and make it new
So I can be with you
And fly away, away....
