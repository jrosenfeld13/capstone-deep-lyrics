Humpty dumpty set on the wall humpty dumpty had a big fall
All the king's horses all the king's men could never put humpty together again

I've got a humpty dumpty heart you dropped it and broke it apart
All the king's horses all the king's men could never put humpty together again
Cause when I gave to you my heart you said that we must part
That was my doom my heart went boom I got a humpty dumpty heart
[ fiddle ]
My heart is a fragile thing when dropped it won't bounce or ring
It ain't no joke cause when it's broke no love song will it sing
I've got a humpty dumpty heart...

I didn't think you were that sort when I handed you my heart
You got it on a platter but you let it shatter my humpty dumpty heart
I've got a humpty dumpty heart...
