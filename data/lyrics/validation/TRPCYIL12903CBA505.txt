Now sittin' in the bathtub, listening to the Isley
Brothers and others outside my door want to despise me
Reminds me that everyone ain't cool, the world is jealous
Never could understand when my momma use to tell us
"Don't take your food outside around your friends
Unless you got enough to feed the neighborhood"
The play has just began, follow me now
Act 1, scene 2, the date 1/1/96, the time I don't know
Mood disturbed, Ray goes on to say they trying to get over
Like them niggas with the blinker on, I got my thinker on
So I'm like word, how every you want to act is fine
That is real, as fishing raw I might be kissing God
But I'm still in the bathtub, so if you got cattle you best be fasting
For 7 days and 7 nights we everlasting
[Unverified] on a quest to get my class ring
Just from them white folks
I will if it's the last thing I do
Everlasting
Yeah, slick know what I'm sayin'? I'm gonna tell you like this
Just cause I live the apartment don't mean
You can keep puttin' notes under my windshield
I tell you, shortie, gonna bust your ass about that shit
Hey y'all, hey y'all, hey y'all, hoes
Back up in this bitch rippin' tracks like I'm suppose
Tommy and Ralph Lauren don't like niggas to wear they clothes
Where your proof at? Who's that?
Talking shit like those keepin' the rumors up
I wish I lived in a fuckin' cage
I ride the streets in Lexus, all these hoes wanna be saved
Go to college, get a job because all you want to do is shake
I use to hit club, niggas, but I gave that shit a break
Just like Maaco, Waco, burn it to the ground
I bet you eatin' pork when your partners ain't around
Backdraft things are Shaft slapping these hoes
Just like he's suppose to, quote you
"Big Boi is the pimp ass nigga that formed you"
Like pottery, sloppily playin' hoes the lotteries
OutKast did the dirt and now you swear your shit is poppin' see
You bit beats, we makin' hits, so give me your flag back
I'm living in the swats, so you may call me Daddy Fatsack
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'? Like this everlasting
Everlasting
One in a million men passing the J off in the culture
Don't y'all smoke a couple of pounds and get tore up y'all
And tear the devil headquarter down to the grizzound
Is how we hit house and puff a couple of good pounds of good weed
PeeWee, my nigga Little Beewee
We need a 50 box of Phillies and some bouncin' titties
From the magic the flame niggas too is sharin' sequels
Never payin' for no pussy
You can shake it, you can keep it to your self hoe
You left your morals at the door, when you steeped in, crept in
Nigga, this baby is at the beach, so now you wondering
Why your nigga done bust you in the fore, head
Ain't no respect there, so you just assed out like breech
Delivery slivery got you swung on these types of things
Go on from here to Bornhome to London
England, Wall Street to y'all street
Sometime I get bewildered and it throws a nigga like me off beat
But I'm back on it
Because we last forever, sound good, don't it?
Rattling in your trunks like Fambu and the component
Said, "That's it, man, fuck that shit on and on and on and I'm out"
Everlasting
