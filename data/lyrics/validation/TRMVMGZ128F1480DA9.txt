I'd give anything
Go anywhere when it comes to your love
But the
Question that's burning in my heart is whether it's strong enough
If you want me to stay, there's something we gotta do
Honesty is a must
I've got to trust
If I'm not with you
Hey

[Hook]
Ain't nowhere I belong
If I'm not with you
Ain't no place I call
Home
If I'm not with you
Constantly on the phone
If I'm not with
You
If I'm not with you
If I'm not with you
Don't know if I can
Trust
If I'm not with with you
All of these questions cause
If I'm not
With you
I hope your expecting this
If I'm not with you
If I'm not with
You baby

And I love it when its just the 2 of laying around
And I can't help
I want u to myself,
The feelings getting stronger now
So I hope you feel the way I feel
Honesty is a must
I've got to trust
If I'm not with you

[Hook]

I hope your not disrespecting me
I'm hoping I'm everything u need
And that all u wish for
You'll find in
Me
It's the way that you show
Show you care
Show that you love
When your not with me
Ain't nowhere that I belong

[Hook x2]
