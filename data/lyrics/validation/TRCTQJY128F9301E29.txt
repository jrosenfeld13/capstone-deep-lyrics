Turn the lights out
Lock the door
Fan the flames you know I'm ready for more
Keep in motion
You got me down
In the darkness
Between the sheets
Alone with you when the angel lies sleeping
Not aware of any danger
Alone with you when the angel lies sleeping
Just like the rhythm of love
Hallucinations
Don't hesitate
You're keeping secrets
Melting in the heat
It's screaming through your veins
It burns your soul
And as the image fades
You have to know
