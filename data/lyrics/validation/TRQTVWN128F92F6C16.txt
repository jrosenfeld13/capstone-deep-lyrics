[Intro]
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh

[Verse 1]
Save up all the days
A routine malaise
Just like yesterday
I told you I would stay
Oh Oh Oh Oh

[Chorus]
Would you always?
Maybe sometimes?
Make it easy?
Take your time

[Verse 2]
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Think of all the ways
Momentary phase
Just like yesterday
I told you I would stay
Every time you try
Quarter half a mile
Just like yesterday
I told you I would stay
Oh Oh Oh Oh

[Chorus]
Would you always?
Maybe sometimes?
Make it easy?
Take your time

[Chorus]
Would you always?
Maybe sometimes?
Make it easy?
Take your time

[Post-Chorus]
Always
Sometimes
Easy
Time

[Outro]
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh
