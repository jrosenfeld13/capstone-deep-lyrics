Would you expect any less from the people at the top?
Taking lives in their hands, stringing all the losers up
For the beats, beats that go with losing any war
While the winners write the history books defeated die poor
Cold and alone, dead and disintegrating
More bereft of life than an old jackson pollack painting
I can get with this and i can see it all now
Before the hail of bullets there is silence, the pow
It's not funny cuz when you think you're on the a-tip you slip
It must be this fucking dark winter weather, i torture myself too much anyway
It's like when i'm feeling happy then i'm jealous of me
Well, people say i hold out like a holden caulfield
You said you didn't like my voice so i kept my jaw steeled
It's too much i shook my head spa-spa-spazmatically
Fat mama cass it was hip automatically

I erase the lines that you mend, "i've done it before", i said, "i'll do it again"
I erase the lines that you mend, "i've done it before", i said, "i'll do it again, do it again"

Don't point that thing at me unless you want to use it
Bark out abuses to the weakest at the back of the line
It's open season on the meek and the useless
Squint, think and squeeze when you can see me and the whites of my eyes

But now you're staring out the t.v. with a smile on your face
Predicting armageddon all over the place
And we're really sorry for all the mistakes we made
It's easy to control us if you keep us all afraid
But now even if you could eat your own words you'd start a hunger strike
Kick sand up in my face like i'm a wheel guard on your dirt bike
The sicker the quicker, thicker, the fatter watch 'em all scatter
But here's the kicker, it doesn't matter
Heaven is a joke and hell is a lie, pay attention son cuz these are words to live by
I've got my tongue in my cheek so far it makes me mute
Now watch me kick in the teeth of the track like my mind was a steel toe boot

I erase the lines that you mend, "i've done it before", i said, "i'll do it again"
I erase the lines that you mend, "i've done it before", i said, "i'll do it again, do it again"

Don't point that thing at me unless you want to use it
Bark out abuses to the weakest at the back of the line
It's open season on the meek and the useless
Squint, think and squeeze when you can see me and the whites of my eyes

The indescribable is up for discussion
The undeniable is all about consumption
And anyone around and all the people in the street
They're pointing fingers and they're whispering discreetly
"who is that man? what's he done for his homeland?"
He knows their hopes will fade without the strength of his hand
They all can see him, they know where he's going
He feels so damn obvious that he must be glowing
He is ready for his sneak attack, he's gonna go do this shit and not look back
"i have the answers for the questions y'all been asking me
I will relieve you of the burden of your six figure apathy
I am the dynamite, i am the glue
I never underestimate the enemy that's what you do
I never underestimate the enemy that's what you do
I never underestimate the enemy that's what you do

Don't point that thing at me unless you want to use it
It's open season cuz it's good, good, good

Don't point that thing at me unless you want to use it
Bark out abuses to the weakest at the back of the line
It's open season on the meek and the useless
Squint, think and squeeze when you can see me and the whites of my eyes

Don't point that thing at me unless you want to use it
Bark out abuses to the weakest at the back of the line
It's open season on the meek and the useless
Squint, think and squeeze when you can see me and the whites of my eyes
