Youre covered in dust
The rest of your life you said
You wanna let go
But you can't even manage
Hush, appreciate time
Youre locked to the ground just
You like to run
Certainty follows
You
Uh uh uh

Chorus
In a daze in the pouring rain i'll wait
One day you come and save me
I can appreciate the rush that you gave me. (repeat x 2)

Uh uh uh

Where do you draw the line
Today i can't let go
I keep my head up
I just keep on hanging on
One day is not so much
Next day you fall in love
My hands are tied you just keep on hanging on

Uh uh uh
