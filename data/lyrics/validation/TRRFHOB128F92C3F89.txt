Sad girl
Such an unusual attraction
Sad girl
How come you look so hurt?

Always locked up in my room
Disguising my faces in the gloom
Hiding like a millionaire
Safely out of site when I'm in there

You're welcome
You're welcome

Cause all sorts of problems when I'm out
No one has the brains to keep me out
Sane as anybody in this place
Counting all the cracks that's in my face

You're welcome
You're welcome
