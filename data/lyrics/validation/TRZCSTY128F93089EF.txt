Just another night in a bar somewhere
Just another blonde girl
Ooh yeah, such a pretty blonde girl

I saw a light behind those cold dark eyes
You showed to a cold dark world
Yeah, then something came over me

When I touched your face
It took me to a place that I'd been afraid to go

Every time we talk I find another piece
To the puzzle in me
That I never really got to know

Sometimes it is so easy to believe
That a broken thing
Can never be whole

Just another night in a hotel room
Just another bad dream
Can you believe I had another bad dream?

We were high and on a hill above a big black could
That turned into a swarm of bees
Whoa, then something cam over me

Then you held my hand
And we faded in the summertime
When you smiled at me

Every time we talk I find another piece
To the puzzle in me
Yeah, that I never really got to know

Sometimes it is so easy to believe
That a broken thing
Can never be whole

You give your heart to me
I'll give my heart to you
If you believe in me
I'll do anything you want me to do
We can stay in bed
Until the sun turns into the moon
I will hold you and smile
Safe in your Arizona room

Inside your Arizona room
There is nothing I'd rather do
Than be alone with
Inside your Arizona room
There is nothing I'd rather do
Than waste away the day
Inside your Arizona room

Nothing I'd rather do
No, there's nothing I'd rather do
Than spend the day lone with you

You give your heart to me
I'll give my heart to you
If you believe in me
I'll do anything you want me to do
We can stay in bed
Until the sun turns into the moon
I will hold you and smile
Safe in your Arizona room

Inside your Arizona room
There is nothing I'd rather do
There's nothing I'd rather do
We can waste away the day
We can waste away the day
Inside your Arizona Room

There is nothing I'd rather do
There's nothing I'd rather do
Than spend the day lone with you
