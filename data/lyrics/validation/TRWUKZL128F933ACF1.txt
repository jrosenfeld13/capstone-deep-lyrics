The time is now to tell
All your secrets of the sea
The glorious
We greeted all the things that caught our eyes

It takes you back to a place
Where we were drunken and disgraced
Where we were young
Abusing all the things that we had won

You take another and I'll be watching

You never change
You never change
You're all the same
I can't keep you down
I can't keep you down

Somewhere out along the way
Something seems to change in your eyes
What's new to me is old to you
And now it's our time to rise

The time is now to tell
All your secrets of the sea
The glorious
We greeted all the things that caught our eyes

It takes you back to a place
Where we were drunken and disgraced
Where we were young
Abusing all the things that we had won

You take another and I'll be watching

You never change
You never change
You're all the same
I can't keep you down
I can't keep you down

Somewhere out along the way
Something seems to change in your eyes
What's new to me is old to you
And now it's our time to rise

There'll always be another way
There'll always be another way

You never change
You never change
You're all the same
I can't keep you down
I can't keep you down

You never change
You never change
You're all the same
I can't keep you down
I can't keep you down
