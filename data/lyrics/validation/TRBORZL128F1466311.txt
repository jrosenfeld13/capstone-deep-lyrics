No sooner than I turn my back and then
It's so hard to find
I'm on the decline with you
Were I to know your feelings...
Is there something between me and you?
Can't pretend you surprise me
And baby it's hurting me too

Hang on girl, meet my heart
It knows the best time for new love to start
Hang on now, meet my heart
It knows the best time for us to start
Hang on girl (hang on girl)
Won't you remain?

Those special moments together
I don't understand
But can't we go ahead as we had planned?
I've questioned all your reasons
Underneath I can see
Somewhere my stolen lover
Who really should still be with me

Hang on girl, meet my heart
It knows the best time for new love to start
Hang on now, meet my heart
It knows the best time for us to start
Hang on girl, meet my heart
It knows the best time for new love to start

Should I hang on - should I stay?
What's the ransom - I will pay?

Hang on girl, meet my heart
It knows the best time for new love to start
Hang on now, meet my heart
It knows the best time for us to start

(REPEAT CHORUS TO FADE)
