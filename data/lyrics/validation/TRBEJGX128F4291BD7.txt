The scourge of Amalek is upon you
The seed of Amu hath oppressed you
They hath urinated upon you and made you eat feces
They know not Ra
They are the enemies of Asar,they hath defiled your tombs
Violated your women and made victims of your little ones
They hath befouled the writings of Thoth
They hath burned sacred papyri,they hath cracked open your heads
Smashed your teeth and gouged out your eyes
They hacked off your limbs and thrown your mutilated bodies
Towards the heavens mocking Ra
Let not their seeds multiply among you
Honour not their wretched little Gods
Crawl not on your bellies before them,war shall you make upon them
Plague and pestilence shall you call down upon them
You must destroy their seed utterly,you shall gash them with flints
You shall gore them with sticks,hack off their testicles
And cut their phalluses to pieces,suffer none of them to live
Dismemberment and slaughter shall you perform on them
The mighty Sekhmet will devour them
The chain of Sut is around their neck,Horus hammereth them
Nepthys hacketh them to bits,the eye of Ra eateth into their faces
Their carcasses will be consumed in the desert
The seed of Amu with perish utterly
Their filth shall never breed among you again
We shall blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under the sky

Black seeds of vengeance
