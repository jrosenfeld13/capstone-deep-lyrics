Halos roam
In the stars tonight
Angels guide you home
With the silver light

A distant silhouette
The haze begins to clear
I feel you throwing me
To the beat of my heart

And I hear your voice through the distance
Calling my name
And do you hear the answer from the still of my soul
Wasted until this day of reunion

Seven years ago
I watched you leave
How could you know the vamp
The time won't veer

We walk down separate ways
Toward those steps we missed
We were always meant for these
Moments from now

And I hear a voice through the distance
Calling my name
And do you hear the answer from the still of my soul
Wasted until this day of reunion

And I hear a voice through the distance

And I hear your voice through the distance
Calling my name
And do you hear the answer from the still of my soul
Wasted until this day of reunion

We come and go
To the beat of a heart
To the beat of my soul

We come and go
We come and go
To the beat of my heart

We come and go
(We come and go)
To the beat of my soul

(We come and go)
(We come and go)
I hear your voice in the distance
Calling me, calling

(We come and go)
(We come and go)
I hear your voice in the distance
Calling me, calling me

(We come and go)
(We come and go)
I hear your voice calling out my name
Calling out my name

We come and go
We come and go
We come and go
