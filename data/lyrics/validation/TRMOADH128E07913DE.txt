She gets everything she wants but nothing that she needs
No respect for what things cost or who she wants to be
Just neglect for what's been lost 'cause nothing is for free

How can we let her get away with being this way
We've been shattered by her can't you see she has to pay

In her shadow I reside
I scream but no one's listening
Would anyone know if I died
I'm sick of no one seeing I'm alive

She has everything I want but nothing that I need
Nothing earned like what I've got gets anything she sees
Lives the life that I cannot 'cause nothing is for free

How can we let her get away she has to pay

In her shadow I reside
I scream but no one's listening
Would anyone know if I died
I'm sick of no one seeing I'm alive
In her shadow I decide I won't stay longer
In a place with silent hate inside
The choice is violence towards her in disguise

How can we let her get away with being this way
We've been shattered by her can't you see she has to pay

In her shadow I reside
I scream but no one's listening
Would anyone know if I died
I'm sick of no one seeing I'm alive
In her shadow I decide I won't stay longer
In a place with silent hate inside
The choice is violence towards her in disguise
