She's running on clean power
She's wound up at the hip
"Wearing Only Flowers" came in 27 to 1
I'd love a drink of water
Take a little kiss
Find a lovely lady - step inside, take a sip

Atlanta turn around and love
Will come back to you

His elements are shaking
She's wounded at the wrist
Person of the hour, the only way she knows how to make it
I know I'll get over
Two months maybe less
I left undiscovered - saw her undress

Atlanta don't look so surprised
We belong to life

After ten years taken
Accidentally meetin'
Realize we were mistaken
Oh yes, we arrive late again
Fix a little breakfast
Time for gettin' married
"Wearing Only Flowers" came in 27 to 1

Atlanta don't look so surprised
Sometimes love will make you wise up
Atlanta close your eyes and I will belong to you
