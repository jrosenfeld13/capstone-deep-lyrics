Mm mm mm mmm mm mm mm

Need to belong to someone
It hurts to known as no-one
Will ever some sweet girl
Bring love into my world
'Cause, I need to belong to someone

Mm mm mm mmm mm mm mm

I wanna be kissed and held tight
Long to missed on a long cold lonely night
Somebody hear my plea
And call out to me 'cause
I need to belong to someone

Sometimes I feel, like a motherless child
No-one cares for me, I've never known sympathy
I hide my needs, from the world with a smile
But understand, I'm only a man

And a man needs to belong, yes he does, to someone
A man hates to known as no-one
Will ever some sweet girl
Bring love into my world
'Cause, I need to belong to someone

I hide my needs, from the world with a smile
But understand I'm only a man
And a man needs to belong, (to someone) to someone
A man hates to known as no-one
Will ever some sweet girl
Bring love into my world
'Cause, I need to belong to someone
Mm mm mm mmm mm mm mm

Need to belong, to someone, ah ah ah
Need to belong, to someone
Need to belong, to someone, ah ah ah
Need to belong, to someone
