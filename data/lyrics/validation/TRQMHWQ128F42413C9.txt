The record goes from blue to gold
So thank you for all your help
I know you want to jump around
But try to contain yourself
You always struck me as the type to take it lightly
But now youre gonna have to shut your mouth or fight me

Backstabber, backstabber

Youre all alone youre all over
The popular magazines will never care what do you care
Youre down with the japanese
But youve got no right to sit there saying I abuse it
When you only sleep with girls who say they like your music

Backstabber backstabber backstabber backstabber backstabber backstabber backstabber backstabber

Backstabber! Hope grabber!
Greedy little fit haver!
God, I feel for you, fool..
You shit lover! Off brusher!
Jaded bitter joy crusher!
Failure has made you so cruel

Rotten to the core
Rotten to the core

Rotten like a crackwhore
Backing out the backdoor
Show us what youre good for
Post it to the noise board
Come on join the bloodsport
Show us some support, still
Working at the drugstore
Is it because youre A FUCKING

Backstabber! Hope grabber!
Greedy little fit haver!
God, I feel for you, fool..
You shit lover! Off brusher!
Jaded bitter joy crusher!
Failure has made you so cruel

So dont tell me what to write
And dont tell me that Im wrong
And dont tell me not to reference my songs within my songs
