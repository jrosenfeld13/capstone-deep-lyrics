The barrel-house told me
My baby caught that train and gone
The barrel-house told me
My baby caught that train and gone
It's all my fault
I must have done somebody wrong, oh yeah
Everything that happens
You know I am to blame
Everything this happens
You know I am to blame
I'm gonna find me a doctor
Maybe my luck will change, oh yeah
My mama told me
These days will surely come
But I wouldn't listen to her
Said I've got to have some fun
I must to did somebody wrong
It was all my fault
I must to did somebody wrong
