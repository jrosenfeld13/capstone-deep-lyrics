[Verse 1: Stephan Jenkins]
The chromosome divides, multiply and thrive
And the strong survive, and the strong survive
And a spaceman fucked an ape
Then cut out on the date
And now it's much too late
The space ship has escaped
Let it go

[Chorus: Stephan Jenkins]
We're lacking something
Good, something good
Is this all for nothing, oh?
Good, something good yeah
(Boom tick tick, and who skipped the long play?
Boom tick tick)

[Verse 2: Stephan Jenkins]
The chromosome divides, multiply and thrive
And the strong survive, yeah the strong survive
And the grandson of an alien wears his snakeskin boots
And shows his reptile roots
He shows his reptile roots

[Chorus: Stephan Jenkins]
We're lacking something
Something good, something good yeah
Is this all for nothing, yeah?
Show me the goods, something good yeah

[Bridge: Stephan Jenkins]
(Boom tick tick and who skipped the long play?
Who skipped the record and who amped what you say?)
I want to sing a song that's my own
I want to be the DJ

[Chorus: Stephan Jenkins]
We're lacking something
Something good, something good yeah
Is this all for nothing, yeah?
Show me the goods, something good yeah

[Verse 3: Stephan Jenkins]
The chromosome divides, multiply and thrive
And the strong survive, yeah the strong survive
The chromosome divides, multiply and thrive
And the strong survive, and the strong survive

[Outro: Stephan Jenkins]
And it's all right, it's all right, yeah
It's a long night, it's a long night
A long night, it's a long night
It's a long night, long night
A long night
A long night
It's a long night
(Alright, alright
When the plane takes off you'll know it
When the plane takes off you'll know it)
