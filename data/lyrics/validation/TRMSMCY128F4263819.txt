If i told you now
If i told you now
If i told you now
How i really felt
I leave my children here
I'm just passin through
This world is not my home
I'm just passing through
I can't live at home in this world anymore
I can't live at home in this world anymore
This world where my children
This world where my children
This world where my children
Have gone before
(when this world is over and done)
(i'll sleep all day when i get home)
