[Verse 1]
My heart, it melts like plastic
I fell through the hole yesterday
Your smile pulled me in like elastic
I felt my mind detonate

[Chorus (Part)]
Oh, I've made mistakes
And you just say it's growing pains
When I feel ashamed
You tell me it's just growing pains

[Verse 2]
We broke in two like a matchstick
It burns in my soul every day, every day
Your world, it was to me so fantastic
And hell seemed so far away, far away

[Chorus]
Oh, I've made mistakes
And you just say it's growing pains
When I feel ashamed
You tell me it's just growing pains
When I'm crying out for change
You tell me it's just growing pains
And oh, I've made mistakes
And yes, I know it's growing pains

[Verse 3]
The truth, it feels like concrete
I drove into its walls yesterday
I wish I could be realistic
But like children, my dreams run away

[Bridge]
I know I've made mistakes
You say it's growing pains
Then when I feel ashamed
You say it's growing pains
When I'm crying out for change
You say it's growing pains
I know I've made mistakes
I know it's growing pains

[Chorus (Variation)]
Oh, I've made mistakes
And you just say it's growing pains
When I feel ashamed
You tell me it's just growing pains
When I'm crying out for change
And oh, I've made mistakes
And yes, I know it's growing pains
