My baby don't love me
My baby don't love me no more
My baby, my baby
My baby don't love me no more

I know the reason why
She in love [Incomprehensible]

I'm telling you, baby
Baby, I got to let you go
Oh, baby
Baby, I got to let you go

You ain't no good, baby
Found that out, baby, from myself
All over, baby, all over your neighborhood

You're going around town talking, baby
Telling everybody I, I ain't no good
But I'm telling you, little girl
In that warm, bitter place no more
