I can't say what brought me down this far
It's complicated
Face down and bleeding from this war
Could you forget about figuring me out
And be glad I made it
From face down and bleeding from this war
From this war, from this war

And it feels like winter
On a perfect summer day
If I convinced my heart to believe my mind
It might just go away

I can't say the last time I really smiled
It takes a lot now
When you're face down and bleeding from a war
Well I know exactly where I've been
And I can't go there again
I need a lot more, I need a lot more than thoughts
I need Your touch in my war

And it feels like winter
On a perfect summer day
If i'd convince my heart to know You really loved me
It might just go away, it might just go away

When it feels like winter
Would You come and save the day
When You touch this heart
I know You really love me
And You'll never go away

And it feels like winter
On this perfect summer day
Could You convince my heart to know You really love me?
It might just go away
Might just go away
