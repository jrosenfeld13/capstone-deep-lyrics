[Chorus 1]
Jenny Jenny Jenny, won't you come along with me
Jenny Jenny, ooh, Jenny Jenny
Jenny Jenny Jenny, won't you come along with me
Jenny Jenny, ooh, Jenny Jenny
You know that I love, we could live so happily
Jenny Jenny, ooh, Jenny Jenny

[Chorus 2]
Spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning like a spinning top
Spinning, spinning, ooh, spinning, spinning
Spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning like a spinning top
Spinning, spinning, ooh, spinning, spinning
Crazy little partner, you ought to see us reel and rock
Jenny Jenny, ooh, Jenny Jenny

[Chorus 3]
Jenny Jenny Jenny, you know that you're my girl
Jenny Jenny, ooh, Jenny Jenny
Jenny Jenny Jenny, you know that you're my girl
Jenny Jenny, ooh, Jenny Jenny
You know that I'll need, I'll buy you diamond rings and pearl
Jenny Jenny, ooh, Jenny Jenny
