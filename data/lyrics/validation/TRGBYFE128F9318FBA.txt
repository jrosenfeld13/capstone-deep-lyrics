Ain't no need of crying
When it's raining
'Cause crying only adds to the rain
Ain't no need a worrying about your problem
'Cause worrying only adds to the pain
If when you feel like you've been caught in a hurricane
(caught in a hurricane)
You just wait on the sunshine after the rain

Ah, let me tell you why
(oh-oh-oh-oh life)
Life's got ups, just like it's got downs
(oh-oh-oh-oh life)
And life's got smiles, just like it's got frowns

Ain't no need of crying
When it's raining
Your crying may only make a flood
Have a little faith in yourself
That's all you need to do you some good

If they cut off the lights in your house
(in your little house)
Don't you let them turn out the sunshine in your heart

Ah, let me tell you why
(oh-oh-oh-oh life)
Life's got ups, just like it's got downs
(oh-oh-oh-oh life)
And life's got smiles, just like it's got frowns (well)

(he he now)
Look real hard
Can't you see the sunshine? (can't you see the sunshine?)
We wasn't born
In a life of just good times
Thank the Lord above
For the strength to see
It's going to be all right (all right)
All right (all right)
For you (for you)
And me (ee-he-he-ee-ee-ee-oo-oo-oo)

Ain't no need of crying
(it's gonna be)
When it's raining
(all right)
(all right)
Ain't no need of crying
When it's raining
(Everything is gonna be all right)
Ain't no need of crying
When it's raining
Ain't no need of crying
When it's raining
