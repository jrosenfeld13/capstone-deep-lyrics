She was such a pretty suicide
Oh, what a beautiful mess
She was such a pretty suicide
Right now she looks her best
Over 50 story fall to stardom
She found her fame top of a car
50 stories she could have told
How life pushed her a little too far

And she was such a pretty suicide
Oh, what beautiful mess
She was such a pretty suicide
Snap a photo so you don't forget it

Now I often stop and wonder
How on earth she could have done it
Twisted up yet all fixed up
And how I wish I could have held her

And life can be so cruel
To such a pretty girl
She's made it all so clear
Out the window with all her fear

Ya know, she was such a pretty suicide
Oh, what a beautiful mess now
She was such a pretty suicide
Oh, what a beautiful mess now

She was such a pretty suicide
Oh, what a pretty suicide
She was such a pretty suicide
Oh, what a pretty suicide
Oh, what a pretty suicide
Oh, what a pretty suicide
