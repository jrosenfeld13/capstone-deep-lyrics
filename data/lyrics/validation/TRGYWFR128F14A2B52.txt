I can't hide the way I feel about you anymore
I can't hold the hurt inside, keep the pain out of my eyes anymore
My tears no longer waiting, my resistance ain't that strong
My mind keeps recreating a life with you alone
And I'm tired of pretending I don't love you anymore

Let me make one last appeal to show you how I feel about you
'Cause there's no one else I swear that holds a candle anywhere next to you
My heart can't take the beating, not having you to hold
A small voice keeps repeating deep inside my soul
It says I can't keep pretending I don't love you anymore

I've got to take the chance or let it pass by
If I expect to get on with my life

My tears no longer waiting, oohh my resistance ain't that strong
But my mind keeps recreating a life with you alone
And I'm tired of pretending I don't love you anymore

Anymore
