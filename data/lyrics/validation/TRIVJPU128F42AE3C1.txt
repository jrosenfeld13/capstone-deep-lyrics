When I like you, it's total revenge
I want to, but I can pretend
That I don't need to be your side again

Wrap me up in a plastic case
Pat me down with your warm embrace
I wanna know where you've laid your face
At night for all these years

You're a problem that I can't abide
I could sleep well, if only I tried
But I stay up and dream of a bride to be
Oh me! Oh my!

Give it up! I can't wait no more
I am stuck on your bedroom floor
With the thought that I may not be
As great as those who came before

There's a man assigned to me
And he checks on my stability
We discuss you every week
Then I rinse and rinse, repeat

But maybe, I can show you, baby!
Maybe, I can relax for good, whoa, baby!
I can show you, maybe, baby

There's a man assigned to me
And he checks on my stability
We discuss you every week
Then I rinse and rinse, repeat

And he charges by the tear
'Til I weep no more, strictly out of fear
That I can't afford your love
And the moon just burns above

Okay
