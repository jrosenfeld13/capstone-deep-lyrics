Anything
And everything is meaningless
When forever's waiting
We're captive to this place... for now
Wo we take our hopes
And hold them away
Chain them to the throes of yesterday
But the chains are getting tight...

Tonight
Our dreams are in our sights
As we're lifted out of nowhere
With sunspots in our eyes
We see the glory of our lives
Our hearts are burning bright
As we're lifted out of nowhere
Our songs all stay behind
To sing the story of our lives

In this place
Where loneliness is never ending
Condescending
And leaves a bitter taste... for now
And our hearts weighed down
With nothing to say
As darkness steals our innocence away
But now we're seeing light...

Tonight
Our dreams are in our sights
As we're lifted out of nowhere
With sunspots in our eyes
We see the glory of our lives
Our hearts are burning bright
As we're lifted out of nowhere
Our songs all stay behind
To sing the story of our lives

Behold the glory of our lives
