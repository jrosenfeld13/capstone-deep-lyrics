Does it really matter what i feel
When i shove it down inside?
Does it really matter if i care
When no life's behind these eyes?
Of mine
Of mine
It never mattered what I felt
I kept it hidden all along
It never mattered if I cared
No life will ever shine again
I never mattered much to you
I always thought that you cared
Does it matter anymore?
I could have been happy
I could have been so happy
I never mattered, you never cared
This is worthless
This is hopeless
You never cared
You never will
Cease to love
And seas of hate
I bear the cross of
Years of pain
I bear the cross
