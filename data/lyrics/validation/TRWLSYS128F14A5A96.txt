Uh-ohh
Tell you that the world is never gonna end
Don't open your eyes to them I can
[x2]

So we all strive to do the best we can
Clouding their eyes with ivory lies
Build a safe haven from their whats and whys
We shelter their minds with ivory lies
At some point, they figure out...

Oh, with so much going on lyings my disguise
So innocent and sweet, that's what I adore
So much going on, I don't think your ready for
Oh oh oh oh ohh, lyings my disguise
What you don't know, what you don't know
Can't hurt you

You can't regret the choices you've made
The choices you've made
Life is in you today
When you make your tomorrow
Why? Why the White Lies?

Oh, so much going on lyings my disguise
So innocent and sweet, that's what I adore
So much going on, I don't think your ready for
Oh oh oh oh ohh, lyings my disguise
What you don't know, what you don't know
Can't hurt you

You cry white lies

Oh, so much going on lyings my disguise
So innocent and sweet, that's what I adore
So much going on, I don't think your ready for
Oh oh oh oh ohh, lyings my disguise
What you don't know, what you don't know
Can't hurt you

So we all strive to do the best we can
Clouding their eyes with ivory lies
Build a safe haven from their whats and whys
We shelter their minds with ivory lies
At some point
They figure out...
