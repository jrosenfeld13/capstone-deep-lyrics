Do you wind up sleeping in an empty room
A bottle of wine, the smell of cheap perfume
Just makes me think of our yesterdays
It's hard enough seeing you with another man
But I've done all the crying that a grown man can
And outside they say that it's rain again

I'm no one's fool and I've got my pride

I ain't gonna cry baby
Not even gonna think it over
Dont think I'm gonna crawl, its just a waste of my time
I ain't gonna cry baby
I'm just another victim of you and your hurting kind

Do you share your bed with him like you shared with me
It sure is a shame, but its no tragedy
I'm not the first, he won't be the last
So I'm packing up my heart in my suitcase
Gonna hitch me a ride to some new warm place
And start again a much wiser man

I'm no one's fool and I've got my pride

I ain't gonna cry baby
Not even gonna think it over
Dont think I'm gonna crawl, its just a waste of my time
I ain't gonna cry baby
I'm just another victim of you and your hurting kind
Another victim of you and your hurting kind

I'm no one's fool and I've got my pride, my pride, my pride

I ain't gonna cry baby
Not even gonna think it over
Dont think I'm gonna crawl, its just a waste of my time
I ain't gonna cry baby
I'm just another victim of you

I ain't gonna cry baby
Not even gonna think it over, Oh
I'm just another victim of you and your hurting kind
Another victim of you and your hurting kind
Another victim of you
