I remember the old country
They call the emerald land
And I remember my home town
Before the war began

Now we're riding on a sea of rage
The victims you have seen
You'll never hear them sing again
The forty shades of green

We're going back to the wild frontier
Back to the wild frontier, it's calling
Back to the wild frontier
We're going back, back to the wild frontier

I remember my city streets
Before the soldiers came
Now armoured cars and barricades
Remind us of our shame

We are riding in a sea of blood
The victims you have seen
Nevermore to sing again
The forty shades of green

We're going back to the wild frontier
Back to the wild frontier, it's calling
Back to the wild frontier
Back to the wild frontier, it's calling

Those are the days I will remember
Those are the days I most recall
We count the cost of those we've lost
And pray it's not in vain
The bitter tears of all those years
I hope we live to see those days again

Now we're riding on a sea of rage
The victims you have seen
You'll never hear us sing again
The forty shades of green

And I remember a friend of mine
So sad now that he's gone
They tell me I'll forget as time goes on

We're going back to the wild frontier
Back to the wild frontier, it's calling
Back to the wild frontier
We're going back, back to the wild frontier
