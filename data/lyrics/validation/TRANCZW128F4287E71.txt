[Verse 1]
Yeah I've been hurt and I've been blue
And I've been thinking about the changes love has put me through
I've told myself it's got to end
I've had enough and I ain't going back again
I've watched them come
I've watched them go
Six, seven, eight and I can still say no
And then tonight you came along
Only a fool would wanna be that strong

[Chorus]
Temptation #9
Make a man wanna cross that line
Face to face with a chance like this
There's only so much that a man can resist

[Verse 2]
I walked alone, I played it safe
Trying not to count the times I walked away
Because when you love and love goes wrong
A broken heart just seems too much to gamble on
I first saw you, I had to think
Oh another pretty woman just what I don't need
But when I look into your eyes
Hey I see something makes me wanna roll the dice

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Ooh you got it shaking
Ooh there's no mistaking
You're the next trip that I'll be taking

[Chorus]
