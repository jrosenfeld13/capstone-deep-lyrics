[Verse 1]
I know the night has reached that stage again
Where I never want to see my home
I know that you'll provide the brains
But who'll provide the brawn?

[Pre-Chorus]
And if it comes down to me and him
You know I'd kiss you better
I kept the message that you sent me

[Chorus]
Bear with me
If you're scared
My beliefs
Made me bound

[Verse 2]
I think it's time we compiled a list
Of places where we shouldn't go
Now is not the time to lose your voice
Everyone should have a choice

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you should ever fall
You know I'd kiss you better
I kept the letters that you sent me

[Chorus]
Close your eyes
If you're scared
My beliefs
Will make you drown

[Ending]
You, are you so scared that you're just gonna let it happen?
You, are you so scared that you're just gonna let it happen?
You, are you so scared that you're just gonna let it happen?
You, are you so scared that you're just gonna let it happen?
