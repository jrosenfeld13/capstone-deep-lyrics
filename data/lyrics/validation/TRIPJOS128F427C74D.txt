I'm sorry, I can't speak English well
But I wanna sing this song for you guys
You may think my words are silly things
But I think that over

I can tell you a lie easily
I can make excuses easily too
So, I think hard. All right?
I wanna be myself

I don't wanna escape
I just want a little boost
So give me a beer just tonight
And let's rock till tomorrow

*S.O.S Can you hear that?
YES NO YES I don't know
S.O.S Can you hear that?
YES NO YES I don't know

I always have something on my mind
But I gotta move every time
I think things will get better
If I really try and I really try

Sure, I know
I want a little boost
So give me a beer just tonight
And let's rock till tomorrow

I send my S.O.S
Can you hear my S.O.S?
