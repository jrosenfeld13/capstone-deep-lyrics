Eureka
Eureka! Eureka
When you find-a what you seek-a
Eureka, Eureka
Everybody shout
Eureka, eureka, eureka, eureka!
Eureka! Eureka
It's a word from ancient Greek-a
Eureka, eureka
Everybody shout
Eureka!
It's the best dang word
Eureka Eureka
That we have ever heard
Eureka Eureka
When you're just about to freak-a
Shout it out, Eureka!
Eureka!
It's a scientist's delight
And we do pronounce it right
When you take-a that first peek-a
Shout it out, Eureka!
Eureka! Eureka
We'll sing this song a week-a
Eureka, eureka
Everybody shout
Eureka!
Eureka! Eureka
From the top of the highest peak-a
Eureka, eureka
Everybody shout
Eureka!
It's the perfect thing to shout
When you're diggin' treasure out
When you find-a what you seek-a
Shout it out eureka
It's the word you'll hear us shriek
When we find the the bones we seek
When you take-a that first peek-a
It is time to shout
Eureka!
It is time to shout
Eureka!
It is time to shout
Eureka!
