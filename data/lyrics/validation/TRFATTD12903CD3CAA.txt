Many souls around the world
Live the ideals of compassion
It's gentleness and non-injuring
A life of fate and passion
On sacred ground, their souls revealed
Protected by a father, taught by a philosophy
Of non difference of self and other
What they have done to others will be done to them
It's their great desire not to suffer again
Ahimsa, for good and evil, friends not enemies
Ahimsa, one god one devil, my belief is a sacrilege
Ahimsa, I wonder why and how to realize
Ahimsa, share the dream, souls will survive
They bring the freedom to their homes
They rule their own domain
They try to live a harmless life
So we are still the same
Released and lost in a previous life
Resolved just in their minds
On a trip through time and space
They try to change our lives
What we should learn and what we're supposed to do
Is to free our minds to let the dream come true
Belief in karma and reincarnate your soul
And teach the world there's peace at all
