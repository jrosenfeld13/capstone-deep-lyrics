Can't you see she's everybody's baby
Maybe for the summer or fall
But don't fall too hard for everybody's baby
'Cause everybody's baby
Ain't nobody's gal

Take a stroll with everybody's baby
Lose yourself in the beauty of her soul
Don't loose your heart to everybody's baby
'Cause everybody's baby
Ain't nobody's gal for long

Everybody's baby is everybody's business
Is everybody's private hiding place
Everybody touch her, everybody clutch her
She's everbody's turn the lights down face

Don't fall in love with everybody's baby
You think she's all for you and she's your pal
Watch yourself with everybody's baby
'Cause everybody's baby
Ain't nobody's gal

Everybody's baby is everybody's business
Is everybody's private hiding place
Everybody touch her, everybody clutch her
She's everybody's turn the lights down face

Don't you know she's everybody's baby
Maybe for the summer or the fall
But don't fall too hard for everybody's baby
'Cause everybody's baby
Ain't nobody's gal, ain't nobody's gal
