Alakazam, shish boom bam
The fish jumped out of the frying pan
It said listen here you're no good man
I can't be part of your dinner plan
I was swimming in the big old sea
My daddy's old ventures didn't care for me
And a country fried filet with greens
Just ain't what I was meant to be
The fisherman watched in shock and doubt
As the fish got up and walked on out
Before he left he turned around
It said you just can't steal the sound, the sound of swing

Uh na na, it makes me wanna dance
Uh na na, it puts me in a trance
Uh na na, it makes me clap my hands
Uh na na, playing the sound of swing

Let me ride, let me fly, let my wings touch the sky
I belong with the song, hear me sing it far and wide
When I make my way back down, plant my feet firm on the ground
Everybody gather round and watch me make the sound, the beautiful sound of swing

Uh na na, it makes me wanna dance
Uh na na, it puts me here to trance
Uh na na, it makes me clap my hands
Uh na na, wo ho oh ho

Uh na na, it makes me wanna dance
Uh na na, it puts me in a trance
All the children they say
Uh na na, it makes me clap my hands
Uh na na, hear my sound of swing

For Louis Armstrong
Uh na na, na na na na na na na na na na
For Fletcher Henderson
Uh na na, na na na na na na na na na na
For ... ...,
Jimmy Reese
For Joe "King" Oliver
I got to hand it to you
For bringing out the sound of swing
