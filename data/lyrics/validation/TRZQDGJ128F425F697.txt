No one here is innocent as far as I can see
It happens each and everyday condoned by you and me
Is if right to take the very best only for yourself
Thinking of no other one only of yourself

I was lost then I was found
But my selfishness still brings me down
Was blind but now I see
This selfishness in front of me

Now I'm thinking about doing the right thing everday
It's really hard to do but it's easy to say
By myself I fall but in him I stand
Everytime I doubt he shows me again
