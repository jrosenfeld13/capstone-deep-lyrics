This is how high we can fly
Before the sun melts the wax in our wings
Lets see how fast we can go
Before our eyes can't follow the road

I'm on fire
Theres no water for the flames
And I'm alive
With no one but myself to blame
And I'm proud
That I've never fallen down
And I have learned
All the truth is tradgedy now

Lets see how fast we can live
Until our times start slowing us down
Just how much further we go
Before we get our place in the ground

I'm on fire
Theres no water for the flames
And I'm alive
With no one but myself to blame
And I'm free
To do what I want to do
And I burn
All the faith has had me denied

Come on my love
Come on my child
Let heaven flow
Into your soul
Let it come on down
Ease away pain
You won't feel
That way again

Come on my love
Come on my child
Let heaven flow
Into your soul
Let it come on down
Let it come on down
Let it come on down
Let it come on down
Into your soul
Into your soul
Into your soul
Into your soul (repeated until fade out)
