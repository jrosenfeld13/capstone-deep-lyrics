A crown of thorns
Thirteen lashes on the back
Tears of blood
But i'll withstand the attack

I bear on my body
The five holy wounds
Like a six-winged angel
I'm affixed to the cross

Father, forgive us
Have you seen ? we have sinned !
Forgive us our doubts
Forgive us our sins

Stigmata of Jesus
The wounds of christ
Blessed servant of god
Bathed in light
The image of nails
On my hands and feet
On my mission from god
I suffer - i bleed
