[Verse 1]
Am I alone in this?
Never a night where I could sleep myself 'til day
We must try to figure it out, figure it out
It won't be that easy, we lost it somehow

[Chorus]
You come over unannounced
Silence broken by your voice in the dark
I need you here tonight just like the ocean needs the waves

[Verse 2]
Oh, the night becomes the space that's somewhere in between
What I feel and what I'm told
Sitting on the shoreline, trying to figure it out, figure it out
To find out the meaning and reach it somehow

[Chorus]
You come over unannounced
Silence broken by your voice in the dark
I need you here tonight just like the ocean needs the waves
Fall around me now
Like stars that shine and brighten the way
I need you here tonight just like this night it needs the rain

[Bridge]
The season has changed
The wind it blows colder now, colder now
The clouds are raised
The rain it falls harder now, all around

[Chorus]
You come over unannounced
Will you come over now?
Silence broken by your voice in the dark
I need you here tonight just like the ocean needs the waves
I need you here tonight just like the waves
Fall around me now
So fall around me now
Like stars that shine and brighten the way
I need you here tonight just like this night it needs the rain
I need you here tonight just like the rain
Over unannounced
Will you come over now?
Silence broken by your voice in the dark
I need you here tonight just like the ocean needs the waves
I need you here tonight just like the waves
Just like the stars that fall around me now
