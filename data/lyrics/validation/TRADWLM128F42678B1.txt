[Verse]
Baby, baby, baby, don't leave me
Please, don't leave me all by myself
I've got this burning, yearning feeling inside me
Deep inside me and it hurts so bad
You came into my heart (baby, baby)
So tenderly (where did our love go?)
With a burning love (baby, baby)
That stings like a bee. (baby, baby, oo, baby, baby)
And now that i surrender, (baby, baby)
So helplessly, (where did our love go?)
You now wanna leave, (baby, baby)
You wanna leave me behind. (baby, baby, oo, baby, baby)
Baby, baby, where did our love go? (where did our love go?)
Don't you want me, (baby, baby)
Don't you want me no more? (baby, baby, oo, baby, baby)
Baby, baby, where did our love go?
And all of your promises (baby, baby)
Of a love forever more. (baby, baby, oo, baby, baby)
Baby, baby, baby, don't leave me
(Where did our love go?)
Please, don't leave me (baby, baby)
All by myself. (baby, baby, oo, baby, baby)
I've got this burning, burnin', yearning
(Baby, baby)
Feeling inside me, (where did our love go?)
Ooh, deep inside me (baby, baby)
And it hurts so bad. (baby, baby, oo, baby, baby)
Baby, baby, where did our love go?
Oh, don't you want me, (baby, baby)
Don't you want me no more? (baby, baby, oo, baby, baby)
Oh, baby, baby, where did our love go?
And all your promises
