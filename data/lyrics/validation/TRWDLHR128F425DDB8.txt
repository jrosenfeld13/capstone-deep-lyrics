[Verse 1]
I've been trying to tell you something
But you never understand
I feel like we've been going around in circles
You look at me like I've become
A stranger on the streets
A skeleton that's been hiding in your closet

[Chorus 1]
I see you next to me but still you feel so far away
Where did we go wrong?
(Where did we go wrong?)
I guess this is the part where you look at me
And say goodbye

[Chorus 2]
Don't, don't let me go
It's not the end, whoa
Girl you know it's not so bad
It's not the end, whoa
No it's not the end

[Verse 2]
I've been around the world
And I've seen so many things
I can't even tell you where I'm going
But no matter where I'm heading
And no matter what I do
Something keeps me coming back to you

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2][x2]

[Verse 3]
What can I do when you're gone
When it feels so wrong
What can I say
To make you want to stay
So what can I do
Don't leave me this way
Because it feels so wrong
Let's stop all these games
Because I just can't say goodbye

[Chorus 2][x2]
