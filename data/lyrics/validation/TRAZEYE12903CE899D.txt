There were days I couldn't weep
Nights I couldn't sleep
And ev'ry thing I did just turned out wrong
Till there was you to dry my tears

Whisper love-words in my ears and this is why
I'm glad you came along

Now there's a smile to cheer me up when I'm lonely
That I can call whenever I'm feeling down
Smile and you know that I'm only
Longing for the minute you'll be around
Help me 'cause I'm trying to get over

The way I thought of love many times before
If ever you should go away and nobody else would be near
There's always a smile to remember that you were here
If I could fly I flew away to a bright blue summer-day

Tryin' to share my love with you for evermore
Darling you made my life complete

You're ev'ry thing I need
I'll never be
The same I was before

Now there's a smile to cheer me up when I'm lonely...
