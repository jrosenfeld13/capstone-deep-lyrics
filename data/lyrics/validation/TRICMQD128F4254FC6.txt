Verse 1

Check, now
I blaze the illist, so much skillis
Impossible for u not to feel us
The Realist MC that chu ever met in ur life
I'm tryin to see u work, with a lil sweat in ur life
I got an idea, and it might sound silly
But I wanna roll ur body in a tight brown philly
Crack it, lick it up, seal it n tight, get a light
Cuz u know we gonna burn it all night
And I just might, double the ice on dent
So when u double the price, the advice ride in, c'mon

Chorus

Rock ya body, mic check 1,2 cuz it ain't a party until my crew run through
Shake somebody, show me watcha can do, like oooh oooh
Rock ya body mic check 1,2 DJ spin the music back into the groove
Pump it louder so the crowd wan' move, like oooh oooh

Verse 2

Like boom, I'll be at the hotel soon
We gon' put the lens on zoom, benz on room
As long as u got the right perfume
Ain't no body checking out the telly till noon
U should get a sack tack, on the backbone
Stand back, I'm ill enough with tight sad songs
Honey stop breathing when I step in the room
And ain't no body leaving when I set in the boom

Chorus

Rock ya body, mic check 1,2 cuz it ain't a party until my crew run through

And if u wanna party baby we can get together boom boom
Cuz u know u make me so horny
And baby u a hottie when u get up on the floor and boom boom
Never wanted someone so badly
We can leave the club and get a telly get a room boom boom

Hands rubbin up and down the my thighs
Staring at chu with my bedroom eyes

Verse 3

Yea, now, this rhyme is for the masters
Excused to use 2pac homes to teach classes yo
Try to follow when the turn tables spinnin
The sound is even loud in the crowd gettin up in it
U see me postin, the scene get frozen
We sound dope when the words r composed and
Dis boys break down so wit the slow jam
I be so damn ill till I'm an old man
Stop, ya makin it hot when ya move
Stag, I reach the top cuz I choose
Grooves, cracks like a cat like u's
In fact the mics with the rap can't lose
