There's no fool like an old fool
I'm livin' proof of that
For years it seems my head has been
Just a place to hang my hat

Shoulda known when I met you
You could never be true
There's no fool like an old fool
'Cause I'm still in love with you

You came to me so sweetly
And you took me by my hand
You said you had to leave me
But you'd still be my best friend

And if I live to be a hundred
I will never understand
If you had to leave me why'd you leave me
For an older man

I've known love from a distance
And I've felt love up close
You'll be comin' back someday
That's what hurts me the most

By then I'll be so sick and tired
I won't have time for you
Then you'll know how it feels
To be an old fool too

There's no fool like an old fool
I'm livin' proof of that
For years it seems my head has been
Just a place to hang my hat

Shoulda known when I met you
You could never be true
There's no fool like an old fool
'Cause I'm stil in love with you
