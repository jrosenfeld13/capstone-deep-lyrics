Are you running away from the truth in the work we never do?
As I twist myself out of sleep to face you
Will you please pick someone else?

I am awkward, I am not myself
It's called worldly remiss
So that is why I choose to stay awake

When I'm dreaming and I hardly know your name
But the games we used to play were not games

Always, through all those years
That you can't take back
When you didn't choose to be here

Are you burning by the truth in the work you never do?
As I rearrange the way I look to suit you
And you ripped your evening dress
And forgot your evening sentences
Like you're beautiful but not one bit useful

How you wonder why I don't feel like dreaming
'cause I hardly know your name
And the games we used to play were not games

Always, through all those years
That you can't take back
When you didn't choose to be here
