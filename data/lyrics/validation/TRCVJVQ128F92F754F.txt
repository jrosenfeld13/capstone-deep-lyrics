(Midnight cowboy, midnight cowboy
See the lonesome  midnight cowboy)
Once his hopes were high as the sky
Once a dream was easy to buy
Too soon, his eager fingers were burned
Soon life's lonely lessons are learned
Hearts are made for caring
Life is made for sharing
Love is all that's left in the end

(Midnight cowboy, midnight cowboy

Once his hopes were high as the sky
Once a dream was easy to buy
Too soon, his eager fingers were burned
Soon life's lonely lessons are learned
Hearts are made for caring
Life is made for sharing
Love is all that's left in the end
Love can turn the tide for a friend
Love can hold a dream together
Love is all that lasts forever
Love is all that's left in the end
Love can turn the tide for a friend
Love can hold a dream together
Love is all that lasts forever
Love can hold a dream together
Love is all that lasts forever
