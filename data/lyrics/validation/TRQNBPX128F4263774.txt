[Verse 1]
It's that feeling
That someone
Is standing behind me
And I turn around and there's no one there

[Verse 2]
And it's the sensation
That someone
Just whispered
I still hear your voice but you're not really here

[Pre-Chorus]
Your memory is like a ghost
And my heart is its host

[Chorus]
I can still feel you just as close as skin every now and then
I'll find myself in a crowded room on my empty bed
There's a place you've touched with your love
No one gets close to
I can still feel you
I can still feel you
I can still feel you
I can still feel you!

[Verse 3]
You said you'd love me
Forever
Then you said
It's over
And left me without the missing link

[Verse 4]
I thought I'd
Forget you
But I guess I
Forgot to
And lately I've been too confused to think

[Pre-Chorus]
When I reach for someone new
It's like I'm touching you!

[Chorus]
I can still feel you just as close as skin every now and then
I'll find myself in a crowded room on my empty bed
There's a place you've touched with your love
No one gets close to
I can still feel you
I can still feel you
I can still feel you
I can still feel you!

[Pre-Chorus]
In everything that moves
And everything I do!

[Chorus]
I can still feel you just as close as skin every now and then
I'll find myself in a crowded room on my empty bed
There's a place you've touched with your love
No one gets close to
I can still feel you
I can still feel you
I can still feel you
I can still feel you!

[Outro]
Ohhhhhh, I can still feel you! (still feel you)
Yeah!
