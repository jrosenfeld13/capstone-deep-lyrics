Oh my God
There's millions of them

I've seen a fire start in Frisco
The day that the earth quaked
I've seen buildings a`blazing
Throwing up in flames
I heard men, women and children
Crying out to their God for mercy
But their God didn't listen
So they were burnt alive

They went down, down
Deep underground
In the great disaster

I was hanging out in Berlin
In the year one thousand nine hundred and thirty-nine
I've seen Hitler's storm troopers
March right across the Maginot line

I've seen two world wars
I've seen men send rockets out into space
I foresee a holocaust
An Angel of death descending to destroy the human race

Down, down
Deep underground
A great disaster

In the sixteenth century
There was a French philosopher
By the name of Nostradamus
Who prophesised that in the late twentieth century
An Angel of death shall waste this land
A holocaust of the likes of which this planet had never seen
Now, I ask you, do you believe this to be true?

I was standing by the bedside
The night that my father died
He was crying out in pain
To his God he said, "Have mercy, mercy"
His body was riddled with a disease
Unknown to man, so he expected no cure
But before he died that night
He was lost, insane

He went down, down
Deep underground
A great disaster
We'll go down, down
Deep underground
A great disaster

You'll go down, down
Deep underground
