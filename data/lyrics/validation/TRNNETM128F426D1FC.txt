[Instrumental Intro]

School girl won't you talk to me
Show a little hospitality
I'm a lonesome stranger in your college town, baby
School girl won't you walk me round
Yeah

School girl, with your foxy looks
Hey baby, let me tote your books
Won't you try a little love
You can't go wrong, darlin'
School girl let me walk you home
Yes

Its a hey (hey), hey (hey), heeeeey yes
And the sun is sinking down
It's a-going away
Its a hey (hey), hey (hey), alright
The nighttime is the right time to say OK
Hey

School girl, come here; let me help you please
Help you studied 'bout the birds and bees?
You can write a little paper on the rites of spring, baby
School girl sha la la ling
Yes

Its a hey (hey), hey (hey), heeeeey now
And the sun is sinking down
It's a-going away
Its a hey (hey), hey (hey), whew
The nighttime is the right time to say OK
[Shouted: Robbie]
Whew

[Instrumental Bridge]
School girl tell me what youd say
Hey now baby don't you turn away
Stop and think it over, honey
Don't you want a romance, darlin?
School girl give me half a chance

One more time about-a
Its a hey (hey), hey (hey), heeeeey now
And the sun is sinking down
It's a going away
Its a hey (hey), hey (hey), alright
The nighttime is the right time to say OK, hey

School girl give me half a (half a), half a chance
Baby
