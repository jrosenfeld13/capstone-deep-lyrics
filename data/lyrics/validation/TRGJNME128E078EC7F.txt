[Intro]
I just want to take you away from everyone
And keep you stashed under my pillow
And then I'd take you out simply for my own pleasure
And wear you when the occasions special
Then I'd put you on like a diamond
So I can sparkle and be the envy of my friends
I'd proudly hold the leash that I'd have you on
So you can't stray and follow me around all day

[Chorus]
It's too late now
I don't think it can fade
It's too real now
Fulfillment just adds fuel to the blaze

Compulsion has stained me
I'm nervously cradling our young love
Without known limits love
Like a butterfly cupped in my hands
I peek in to see beauty trapped
Confined it flutters
Then it leaves behind colorful dust
To remind me of the special times we've spent
But of course it has to leave my clutch
But enough's never enough to make a dent

[Chorus]
It's too late now
I don't think it can fade
It's too real now
Fulfillment just adds fuel to the blaze

[Post Chorus]
And in time it will end
And there really isn't hope for the two of us
But right now I give in

[Outro]
It's too late now
I don't think it can fade
It's too real now
Fulfillment just adds fuel to the blaze
Fulfillment just adds fuel to the
Fulfillment just adds fuel to the blaze
