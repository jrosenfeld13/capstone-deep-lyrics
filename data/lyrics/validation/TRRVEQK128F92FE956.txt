We've shared so much together
For so long now
I could never turn my back on you
And just walk out

How could I leave you
When you've been so forgiving?
But living without her love
Don't feel like much like living

Caught between two fires
One is safe and warm
One is pure desire
As the flames raise higher

Either way I turn
I'm gonna get burned
Caught between two fires

Lyin' close beside you
After the love we've made
Another face flickers in my mind
And takes me miles away

I've tried so hard to fight it
But I can't fight anymore
My heart is so divided girl
In this tug of war

Caught between two fires
One is safe and warm
One is pure desire
As the flames raise higher

Either way I turn
I'm gonna get burned
Caught between two fires

Either way I turn
I'm gonna get burned
Caught between two fires
