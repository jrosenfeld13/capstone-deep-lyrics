Close to the edge that's where I'd stand*
Dancing with fire with a match in each hand
Had a mind filled with fear and a heart full of rage
One step from insanity and one step from the grave

But I'm back from the dead
I'm starting all over now
With something to believe in
And something to live for

Gave up the ghost a long time ago
But my heart's still beating how I don't know
Fell down on my knees and covered my face
I begged for mercy but instead I got grace

And now I'm back from the dead
And I'm starting all over now
There's something to believe in
And something to live for
I'm back from the dead
And I feel so much better now
Life is worth living again
Now that there's something to live for
There's something to live for

I found something to live for, something to die for
Something to hold on to
Someone who loves me but even more importantly
I finally learned to love myself

I was so lost nowhere to be found
If not for heaven where would I be now?

But I'm back from the dead
Back from that living hell
I know where I'm going now
That there's something to live for

I'm back from the dead
I'm starting all over now
Life is worth living again
Cause there's something to live for
There's something to live for
