You used to be a sweet thing
That much I can confess
Now you're a naggin', saggin', haggard old bag
With perpetual PMS
You wanna be on top of everything and everyone

You think you got something
That can make a woman beg
But you do all your thinking
With that little thing swinging between your legs

If beauty is only skin deep
You're ugly to the bone
Why don't you do us both a favor
And leave me alone

I hate you. I hate everything about you. I hate everything you do

I can't take another day
If it means living with someone like you
Honey, I know how you feel
I feel the same way too

I guess we can sum the whole thing up
With just three little words

I hate you. I hate everything about you. I hate everything you do

I wake up to a beautiful day thinking nothing can go wrong
But the nightmare still goes on

I hate you. I hate everything about you. I hate everything you do
