It's the most wonderful
Time of the year
With the kids
Jingle-belling
And everyone telling you
Be of good cheer
It's the most wonderful
Time of the year

It's the hap-happiest
Season of all
With those holiday greetings
And great happy meetings
When friends come to call
It's the hap-happiest
Season of all

There'll be parties

For hosting
Marshmallows for roasting
And caroling out in the snow
There'll be scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories
Of Christmases long, long ago

It's the most wonderful
Time of the year
There'll be much
Mistletoe-ing
And hearts will be glowing
When loved ones are near
It's the most wonderful
Time of the year
