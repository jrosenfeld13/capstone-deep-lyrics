[Verse 1]
I try to believe what I feel these days
It makes life much easier for me
It's hard to decide what is real these days
When things look so dizzy to me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I already know my children's children's faces
Voices that I've heard before
There's always more
There's always more

[Chorus 1]
Wondering, leaving the sea behind
To my home which everybody owns
Wondering, wandering
Where we can do what we please, wondering

[Verse 2]
I feel like a thousand years have passed
I'm younger than I used to be
I feel like the world is my home at last
I know everyone that I meet

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Somewhere in the music I can hear the bells
I heard a thousand years before
There's always more
There's always more

[Chorus 2]
Wondering is this there all there is
Since I was since I began to be?
Wondering, wandering
Where we can do what we please, wondering
