You make me feel so young
You make me feel as though spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy in-div-dual

The moment that you speak
I wanna go play hide and seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy ballon

You and I are just like a couple of tots
Runnin' across the meadow
Pickin' up lots of forget me nots

You make me feel so young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung Bells to be rung
And a wonderful spring to be sprung
And even when I'm old and grey
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
'Cos you make me feel so young
