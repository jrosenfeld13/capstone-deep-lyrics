Baby crossed an ocean just to see what she could see
Half the world beneath her feet, a rose between her teeth
Spent her lifetime loving, spent her lifetime living fine
But since you broke her heart, yeah, she needs a little time
A little time, a little time

Before we were old mem'ries and I guessed that we'd be fine
Shooting stars still break her heart and sunsets make her cry
Watch the birds fly over head, you can catch them if you try
Watch the planes fly over head, you can catch them if you try
If you try, if you try

Two stones in my pocket girl, I keep them for my dreams
I give 'em both to you now cause you need them more than me
Your mother's arms will keep ya safe wherever you may be
Your mother's arms will keep ya safe however you may be
You may be, you may be
