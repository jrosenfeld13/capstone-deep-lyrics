[Chorus:]
Ive been waiting for the day (waiting for the day)
That id be going home again (going home)
Ive been away from family way too long
But I know Ill soon be home again

[Verse 1:]
Ugh, life ain't promised tomorrow thats what they say
Look what i say life ain't promised today
A lot of folks outta work right now, latin, white and black
So we count on obama care and americas job welfare
Where im from is ugly not pretty its all bad it ain't good
The pizza man dont even wanna come to my hood
Robberies crime scenes being seeing it often
And the most lucrative business is selling coffins
Society is two faced to a lot of folks that was well off then fell on hard times
The sign of the times family fallin out with family a whole lot of mess
I wish we had more positive speakers like dr. Cornell west
My niece wanna be a cosmetologist, my nephew a chef
But without a scholarship, a student loan will put them both in debt
Now thats a catch 23 man thats not a catch 22 caz Id be damned if I dont and damn if I do
My relative just got out the state but now he headed to the feds
On some trumped up charges that he didnt did
But as soon as he come home we goin make a prison spread
Got some ramen noodles, some mayonnaise and tuna, some cheese and potato chips

[Chorus ]

[Verse 2:]
Everytime I  leave the house i pray that i make it back
Its easier to kill a man but its harder to live with that
Its bad outta here in this trap  tryna make it in rap
Swimming in this concrete lake where the 2 legged snakes is at
We quick to kill our own killin, all wanna scrap and fight
The slave masters did want us to learn how to read and write
My minority is not the authority, priority
In the correctional institutions we make up the majority
Hot ones echo through the ghetto bullets ricocheted
The batteram and the canines and the task raids
Its been 3 weeks and a half and she still ain't bathed
Turning tricks for rocks dippin top in alleyways
Used to be finer than wood face, body and butt
The baddest broad at the school now she sucked out
A good girl gone bad used to be squared as a town
Yall had everything spoiled rotten we nothin in our christmas stockings
I keep my enemies close so i can see what they plotting
Some of my family gone but they not forgotten

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
The devil working over time but he cant defeat me
Every night i say my prayer for some reason i get sleepy
Is there a heaven for a hussler, a d boy, a pusher
Tryna provide for his family, brothers and sistas
All i got is my word and my name
A good reputation is better than fame
What if things dont shape up that what i say to the preacher
He said you gotta have faith you gotta be a believer
Dont wanna be a employee i wanna be a employer
Everytime i get some money it go to my lawyer
Im on the phone with my aunty she my prayer waiver
Giving me scriptures to read to protect me from the destroyer
This is my letter to god i hope that he reads this
Please cover me with the blood of your son jesus
The clouds is dark, rain, lightening and thunder
When the saints come marching in i wanna be in that number

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Oooh its been so long
Been so long
And im on my way home
On my way home
Back to my family
To my family
Its been too long
Its been a long time
Its been so long
So much pain
But im on my way home
Hardship, struggle, the struggle man growing up in the inner city
Its been so long
Life is heavy, life is heavy yall
But im on my way home
Gotta stay prayed up
Back to my family
Keepin praying man
Its been so long
God is good
Been so long
Keep the faith man
But Im on my way home
The ups and downs man
The torment and turmoil my nigga
The torment stay strong my nigga stay strong
Stay strong my brothas, stay strong
