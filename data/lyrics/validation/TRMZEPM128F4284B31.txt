Gather up your pots and your old tin can
Mash and the corn the barley and the bran
Run like the devil from the Garda van
In the hills of Connemara

Keep your eyes well peeled today
The excise men are on their way
Searching for the mountain tay
Keep the smoke from rising Rabbi
Swinging to the left, swinging to the right
The excise men will dance all night
Search for tay in the broad daylight
Keep the smoke from rising Rabbi

A jug for ???, a squirt for Tom
A bottle or two for ??
To help them both move along
In the hills of Connemara

Mind your ground, for it's too late
The excise men are at the gate
Jesus Christ they're drinking it straight
In the hills of Connemara
