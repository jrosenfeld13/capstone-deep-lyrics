Riots and violence!
Thanks for the rainbow
But I'll make my own
Dance the night away
Thanks for the rainbow
But I'll make my own
Come on, come on, there's something
That we've, that we've been missing
Long lost love, I've yet to find you
If that's you, if that's you we will know
If that's you, if that's you we will go
Enjoy the show
You've got it figured out
We'll find our way back too
We'll find our way to you
And our hearts will shine like you
Riots and violence!
Thanks for the rainbow
But I'll make my own
Slow down my robot
Let's end this, let's end this
This is more than a broken heart
Long lost love, I've yet to find you
This is more than a broken heart
