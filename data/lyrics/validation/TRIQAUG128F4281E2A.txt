Ten years have passed
Ten years have passed
Ten years have passed
Since the guns of September
Ten years have passed

Don't cry, don't cry
Don't cry, it's thunder
Don't cry, don't cry
Don't cry, it's thunder
Outside, outside
This world of wonder
Don't cry, don't cry

Ten years have passed
Since the guns of September
Tanks in the street
Do you remember?
Fire in the night
Smoke in the sky
We had to hide

Guns, guns
Guns, guns
Guns of September
Guns, guns
Guns, guns
Guns of September
Guns, guns
Guns, guns
Guns of September
Guns, guns
Guns, guns

Outside my window
Is total disaster
It's who we are
Not how things should be
I look into your eyes
And I see a reflection
Who we are
And how things should be

So, don't cry, don't cry
Guns of September
Don't cry, don't cry
Guns of September
Don't cry, don't cry
Guns of September
Don't cry, don't cry
