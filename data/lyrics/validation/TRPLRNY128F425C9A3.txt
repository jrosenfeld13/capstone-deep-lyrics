I belong to you
For as long as you want me to
I belong to you
For as long as you want me to

In love with you I'll always be
Forever true till you set me free
Please don't you worry
About all the guys around
They can't sweet talk me
They can't put you down

Ain't nothin' they can say
My darlin' ain't no way
All that I want I've got
All I can think of is only you now

I belong to you
For as long as you want me to
I belong to you baby
For as long as you want me to

There's no love
Like what we've known
Everything is right
We can't go wrong

Girls don't bother me
No matter what they do
Any fool can see
Baby I've got you

I may not be the best but
I ain't seen no one yet
Love you the way I do
All I can think of is only you love

I belong to you
For as long as you want me to
I belong to you

Ain't nothin' they can say
My darlin' ain't no way
All that I want I've got
All I can think of is only you now
And only you now that's all I can think of

I belong to you
For as long as you want me to
I belong to you
For as long as you want me to

I belong to you
For as long as you want me to
I belong to you
