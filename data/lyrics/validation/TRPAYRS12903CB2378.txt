This Love of Mine
Tommy Dorsey
Words by Frank Sinatra and music by Sol Parker and Henry Sanicola

Introduced by Tommy Dorsey and his Orchestra, vocal by Frank Sinatra

This love of mine goes on and on
Tho' life is empty since you have gone
You're always on my mind, tho' out of sight
It's lonesome thru the day
But oh! The night
I cry my heart out, it's bound to break
Since nothing matters, let it break
I ask the sun and the moon
The stars that shine
What's to become of it
This love of mine
