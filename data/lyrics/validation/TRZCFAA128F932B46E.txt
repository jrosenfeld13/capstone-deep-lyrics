Them's the breaks, flubbed some takes, made some mistakes
Call it an evening, just not well spent
The Vicodin is kicking in
Serotonin may be lacking tomorrow
I'll deal with it then

Did you see me try?
Like a little kid with a sheet on trying to fly
Black clouds in the sky always come when I'm the lowest
Please tell me why...my oh why

Sang some tunes, I got a bruise So I lick my wounds
Does that sound familiar? I did it last night
I know I'll probably never sleep inside this van which has no heat
Nobody had any pills for me or they're holding out

Did you see me try?
Like a little kid with a sheet on trying to fly
Black clouds in the sky always come when I'm the lowest
Please tell me why...my oh why

Please believe that these broken knees will still carry me
They won't keep me from drinking tonight
No laceration on this occasion is deep enough not to
Keep me from drinking tonight
The slim hope of chance gives us reason to dance and tomorrow's no reason to
Keep me from drinking tonight
The beautiful lie, I'm not wasting my life keeps me standing
