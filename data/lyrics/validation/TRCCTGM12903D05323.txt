My name is Jacob Fleet
I feel the solid world
Revolve beneath my feet
I stride over plains
Through the copse
And through the glade...
I pace through the day

And a voice tells me
'Never stop, never stay
Don't let your shadow fade'

I scale the steeple streets
All empty but for song
Wood-smoke and Sabbathe meat
I pace down the lanes
If I stop my shadow fades...
I walk and I pray

And the wind tells me
'Oh come back home again'
And the hedges began to hum
'Never stop, never stay
Don't let your shadow fade.'

My name is Jacob Fleet
I walk the golden mist
Of Alabaster Street
My scant figure strays
Through the lost
Withe lilac lanes
Where heavens angels prey...
But I will not stop or stay
I rage into the day

And the wind tells me
'Oh come back home again'
And the hedges began to hum
'Never stop, never stay
Don't let your shadow fade.'

I saw a girl standing by a pail
I heard the tell-tale wind
In the windmill sail
