There's a wind from the west
Coming on strong
It won't be long
The thing starts kicking in

Wild cats fall
Ready or not
Here's our shot
It won't get away again

'Cause this time
We're not gonna quit
And this time
Just for the fun of it

We're gonna hit the ground running
We're gonna hit the ground running
They won't see us coming
We're gonna hit the ground, hit the ground

There's no regrets
This time 'round
Were gonna get on down
No matter what it takes

Well, we heard it said
In the past
That it'd never last
But I know we gonna be here to stay

'Cause this time
We're not gonna quit
And this time
Just for the fun of it

We're gonna hit the ground running
We're gonna hit the ground running
They won't see us coming
We're gonna hit the ground, hit the ground

'Cause this time
We're not gonna quit
And this time
Just for the fun of it

We're gonna hit the ground running
We're gonna hit the ground running

We're gonna hit the ground running
We're gonna hit the ground running
They won't see us coming
We're gonna hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the
