Call me anytime you want
Call me don't you ever stop
A silver sun, an empty gun, whatever
And everyone is having fun, whoa-whoa-whoa

I like that, when it comes easily
To me, and everything I couldn't see
I like you, even though I shouldn't do
I like that, I wonder if you like it to

And I like it, and I like it, and I like it, there's nothing like this

Velvet sky the night-time falls
Losing sight I start to crawl
And if you claim, a spinning train, whatever
And everyday, I'm gonna play, yeah-yeah-yeah

I like that, when it comes easily
To me, and everything I couldn't see
I like you, even though I shouldn't do
I like that, I wonder if you like it to

I like that, when it comes easily
To me, and everything I couldn't see
I like you, even though I shouldn't do

And I like it, and I like it, and I like it, there's nothing like this

And I like it, and I like it

I like that, when it comes easily
To me, and everything I couldn't see
I like you, even though I shouldn't do
I like that, I wonder if you like it to

I like that, when it comes easily
To me, and everything I couldn't see
I like you, even though I shouldn't do

And I like it, and I like it, and I like it, there's nothing like this
