Well, it's been
Three weeks since we said goodbye
And now how am I hard, as I try
Supposed to last a whole lifetime

The days are fine
I keep my mind
Occupied and satisfied
I keep my eyes on the consolation prize

But in the night
I lose the fight
I toss and turn
While my fears unite

My teeth grind every time
The visions come, I wish I was blind
They're teasing me, endlessly
With a dream that was, but can never be

I was never meant to be without you
I was never meant to be without you
I supposed in time, I will get by
But I was never meant to be without you

Well, now it's been
Three weeks since I wrote this song
Now the future's wrong seems way too long
I thank the stars you taught me to be strong

And now I walk the line
Your hand in mine
Your still my guide, side by side
I tell myself it's just a matter of time

And now my life keeps moving by
And now I hear your voice in mine
I still smile most of the time
At memories, our lives intertwined

You're keeping me company
With a love that was, and will always be

I was never meant to be without you
I was never meant to be without you
I supposed in time, I will get by
But I was never meant to be without you

I was never meant to be without you
I was never meant to be without you
I supposed in time, I will get by
But I was never meant to be without you

I was never meant to be without you
I was never meant to be without you
I supposed in time, I will get by
But I was never meant to be without you
