[Verse 1]
The sky was blonde like her
It was a day to take the child out back and shoot it
I could have buried all my dead
Up in her cemetery head

She had dirty word witchcraft
I was in the deep end of her skin
Then it seemed like a one car wreck
But I knew it was a horrid tragedy

[Pre-Chorus]
Ways to make the tiny satisfaction disappear

[Chorus]
Blow out the candles on all my Frankensteins
At least my death wish will come true
You taste like Valentine's and we cry, you're like a birthday
I should have picked the photograph
It lasted longer than you

[Verse 2]
Putting holes in happiness
We'll paint the future black if it needs a color
My death sentence is now a story
Who will be digging when you finally let me die?

The romance of our assassination
If you're Bonnie, I'll be your Clyde
But the grass is greener here
And I can see all of your snakes

[Pre-Chorus]
You wear your ruins well
Please run away with me to hell

[Chorus]
Blow out the candles on all my Frankensteins
At least my death wish will come true
You taste like Valentine's and we cry, you're like a birthday
I should have picked the photograph
It lasted longer than you

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Blow out the candles on all my Frankensteins
At least my death wish will come true
You taste like Valentine's and we cry, you're like a birthday
I should have picked the photograph
It lasted longer than you

[Chorus]
Blow out the candles on all my Frankensteins
At least my death wish will come true
You taste like Valentine's and we cry, you're like a birthday
I should have picked the photograph
It lasted longer than you
