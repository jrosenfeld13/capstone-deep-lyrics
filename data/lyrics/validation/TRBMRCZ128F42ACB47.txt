Sister, you've been on my mind
Sister, we're two of a kind
So sister, I'm keepin' my eyes on you
I betcha think I don't know nothin'
But singin' the blues
Oh sister, have I got news for you
I'm somethin'
I hope you think that you're somethin' too
Scufflin', I been up that lomesone road
And I seen a lot of suns goin' down
Oh, but trust me
Now low life's gonna run me around
So let me tell you somethin' sister
Remember your name
No twister, gonna steal your stuff away
My sister
Sho' ain't got a whole lot of time
So shake you shimmy
Sister
'Cause honey I sure is feelin' time
