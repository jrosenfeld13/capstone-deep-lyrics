Hey ho hey ho there's something i don't know
Like who i am or where i go
We're on this climb we'll be there for some time
There is no reason i can find

Wagon train what's my name
Can you guess my crime
Wagon train ease the pain
And leave the world behind
Wagon train head 'em up ehoh

A brave new world for all those boys and girls
A universe for us to roam
They cast us out and left us with no doubt
They're never gonna bring us home
