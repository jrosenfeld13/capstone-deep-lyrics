Try as you will
You can't escape your past
Given everything you ever wanted
I never will understand your life
Well not this time
Have you ever had to fight for anything
Mother pays your rent
And daddy bought your car
With the money that they've spent
It's sure did get you far
What's your life when everything is so fake
What's your life you're an expert on everything
You're so fake everything is just a game
Try as you will
You can't escape your past
Given everything you ever wanted
Not this time, not this time
Have you ever had to fight for anything
