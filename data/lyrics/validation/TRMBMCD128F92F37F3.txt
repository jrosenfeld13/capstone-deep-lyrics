Cold turkey, you can't expect me to quit, do you baby?
Cold turkey, feelings don't go away so easy
Just a little more time and I swear I'll leave you alone
But tonight I got this jones coming down

It's 3 o'clock and I woke up with the shakes
So I called you up for the remedy
I know I woke ya, get on up I'm coming over
And don't be acting like you don't remember me

I want some of that good, good loving
Like the kind that we used to making
How I used to make you shake for hours after, yeah
Now I don't know what you did to me
You must've put something in my food
'Cause baby you got me all caught up in the rapture, yeah
I can't go

Cold turkey, you can't expect me to quit, do you baby?
Cold turkey, feelings don't go away so easy
Just a little more time and I swear I'll leave you alone
But tonight I got this jones coming down

I'm finding out real quick, I just can't have anybody in my bedroom
'Cause when I want it, it's got to be you right
And though I threw away your number and I tried not to remember
Got it locked inside my brain memorized, showing off

Don't tell me that you don't recall all the fun that we used to have
And how I used to make you laugh and cry sometimes sugar
Now, I don't believe you when you say
That you ain't really thinking about me
?Cause baby girl you?re steadily running through my mind
And I can?t, I can't go

Cold turkey, you can't expect me to quit now baby
Cold turkey, feelings don't go away so easy
Just a little more time and I swear I'll leave you alone
But tonight I got this jones coming down

It keeps calling me right back, I keep thinking about the past
I don't wanna be with nobody but you, no man
I miss your rhythm and groove miss, don't know how you do it
All I know is I'm addicted to your love
And I can't go

Cold turkey, you can't expect me to quit, do you baby?
Cold turkey, feelings don't go away so easy
Just a little more time and I swear I'll leave you alone
But tonight I got this jones coming down
Understand what I?m saying

Cold turkey, you can't expect me to quit now baby
Cold turkey, feelings don't go away so easy
Just a little more time and I swear I'll leave you alone
But tonight I got this jones coming down, coming down
Coming down, coming down, coming down, coming down
