The searchlights have stopped
That means the helicopters
Have stopped searching for me

I finally got to see the sky (got to see the sky)
I finally got to see the sky (got to see the sky)
I finally got to see the sky (got to see the sky)
And I finally got to see the sky

Bright red with brilliance
Just like the blood that came
Shooting out of your eyes

Bright red like brilliance
Bright red like brilliance
Bright red

I finally got to see the sky
I finally got to see the sky
I finally got to see the sky
And i finally got to see the sky

If you won't look at me you won't look at anyone
If you won't look at me you won't look at anyone

The comparison is astounding
As the grass turned the color of the sky you told me you were sorry
Turned the color of the sky, you told me you were sorry
Turned the color of the sky, you told me you were sorry
Turned the color of the sky you told me you were wrong

But that's what they all say
That's what they all say (that's what they all say)
On your knees and tell me you can live without me

Your empty sockets will serve as my love
Your empty sockets will serve as my love
