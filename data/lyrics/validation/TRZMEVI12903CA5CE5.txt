(J-J-J-J-J.R.)

[Verse 1]
Like a shock to my heart
When I saw you tonight
Like a dream come alive
For the very first time
When we touch in the dark
Baby, you're blowing my mind
Wish I could freeze you and me
In this moment in time (hey)

[Pre-Chorus]
You got it, what I want
Give it up, shorty
Step it up for me
And I'll give you everything
All my life, all my love
I'll give you my fortune and fame
I'd even give you my name

[Chorus]
Girl, you take me higher
Than I've ever been before, my feet don't touch the floor
We'll fly, the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
Girl, you take me up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up
Girl, you take me up
You take me higher, the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit

[Verse 2]
When we dance when we kiss
Doesn't get any better than this
How you shine, trapped in the spotlight
Finally mine, yeah
Baby, let's go (go), let's get out of here
Baby, let go (go), got nothing to fear
And now that we're here, let's disappear
Into the night (hey)

[Pre-Chorus]
You got it, what I want (what I want)
Give it up, shorty (shorty)
Step it up for me
And I'll give you everything
All my life, all my love
I'll give you my fortune and fame
I'd even give you my name

[Chorus]
Girl, you take me higher
Than I've ever been before, my feet don't touch the floor
We'll fly, the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
Girl, you take me up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up
Girl, you take me up
You take me higher, the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit

[Bridge]
My feet are on the ceiling, haha (the ceiling)
And they don't wanna touch the ground anymore
Oh, what I feel (what I feel), I can feel it (I can feel it)
Can you feel it? Feel It, feel it (yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Girl, you take me higher (oh, yeah)
Than I've ever been before (before), my feet don't touch the floor
We'll fly, the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
Girl, you take me up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up (you take me up, baby)
Girl, you take me up (oh whoa, oh)
You take me higher, the sky is the limit (higher)
The sky is the limit, oh, whoa
