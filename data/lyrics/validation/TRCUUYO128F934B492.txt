You are someone
You would not like to be
Wandering the way to ilumination
Sinking in bizzare rituals
Whole life studying lines and signs
You take pains to chase
Shadows of yourself...
Shadows of yourself
Things, you are thinking are right
Just must have imagined as that
Myths of all systems
And never written book
Or book written thousands of times
No matter where and how
Your move is your start...
(Lead: Mauser / Peter)
Like freely river of perceptions
Consciousness, private library
Of everything anti and pro
Life, choice, death
Despite of circumstancess
There is always your way
