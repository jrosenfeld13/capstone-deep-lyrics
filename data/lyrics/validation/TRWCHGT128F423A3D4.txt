See the stars from a million places
Porcelain skin puts our faces entwined in time
Never lost my way for you
Felt it all around me
Never gonna stop
Never stop anything at all
Repeat all that we do
Never gonna stop
Never stop anything at all
Let's start from the beginning

The times we've lost can be repaired
So be prepared
The moments we burned into our minds
Yeah we'll be fine

We say our goodbyes
We say our goodbyes
Let's bring it tonight
Let's bring it tonight

The story's building as we live on through this night
Representation to approve the words we bind
The city never pulls through once we all are doomed
Never gonna stop
Never stop anything at all
Remember what we do
Never gonna stop
Never stop anything at all
Re-live the lives we put in the sky

The times we've lost can be repaired
So be prepared
The moments we burned into our minds
Yeah we'll be fine

The times we've lost can be repaired
So be prepared
The moments we burned into our minds
Yeah we'll be fine
