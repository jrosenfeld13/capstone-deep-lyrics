As you walk inside the underground
Holding on the strap of your backpack
You watch the man next to
Calmly reading his morning book
In your suit hiding your difference
Looking calm with eyes from another
You hide your real aim
As you travel on your work today
And you shout out
And you jump out
And you jump out of the train
From your neck dripping
Pearls of sweet
Lodging between your shirt
And your neck and
You know you're not the same
Hiding as a mouse on the train
Under your shirt another
Skin than
The neighbour standing next to
Muting and commuting
On your way to heaven today
And you shout out
And you jump out
And you jump out of the train
People are looking at you
They think you're a terrorist
They're scared
The fire, the fire
The fire, the fire
Is burning, is burning Is burning, is burning
The fire The fire The fire
Is burning within
The fire, the fire The fire, the fire
Is burning, is burning Is burning, is burning
The fire, the fire
Is burning within
