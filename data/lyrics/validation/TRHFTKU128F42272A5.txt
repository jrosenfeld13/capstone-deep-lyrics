The ocean is rising
And I feel the water storming in
The ocean's awaiting
It's waiting for me to dive rignt in

It's waiting for me to dive to dive
It's waiting for me to dive to dive

This water's got colour
It changes through every shade of blue
This water's got power
It brings with it life for me and you

It's waiting for me to dive to dive
It's waiting for me to dive to dive

(spoken)
I can hear the water sound
From the old man's shell
It's where the sound begins
The deep sea the islands shores have a song
The power of the thunder
The call of the ocean
It's here my hear belongs

Lay down on the coral stones
Face up to the sky
And I can hear the oceans mighty
Thunder sounds
Under the milky way

The reef is a fire dance
The waves crush the salt against my skin
Hold on to your breath now
It's waiting for us to dive right in

It's waiting for me to dive to dive
It's waiting for me to dive to dive

It's waiting for me to dive to dive
It's waiting for me to dive to dive
