Where are you, now
I can only see your face
That's not good
If only I could forget
I know your hips
I know your zips
I kissed your lips
And everything's so great
What I need baby
Is a little bit of your soul
But you're too cold, baby
And your blood don't flow

Well you taught me
A few tricks in a bed
And that a lover
Can't be your friend
So may be flying
Can be lot of fun
But getting shot
Might be somewhere in the plot
What I need baby
Is a little bit of your soul
But you're too cold, baby
And your blood don't flow
