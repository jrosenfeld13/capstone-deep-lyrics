Sails up! We're leaving today
Distant lands are calling
Cowards stay at home; this is a quest of true men
Farewell, should we never see again

Weeping women waving at the pier
When the sky starts to cry
But neither rain, nor wind can make us turn around
What's decided, has to be done

See how the forefathers greet, us with northern lights
Bravely towards unknown shores, through raging storms we fight
Faith in the gods, their strength in our hearts, when lightning strikes
If we die, we'll meet again in Valhalla...

In a dream I saw two ravens in the sky
And a verdant land behind
When we set out feet there, we'll burn our fleet
'Cause the land is promised to us by gods

May Njord protect us on our way
May the moon light our path
Let our spirits be purified by the ocean's breeze
Let the wind, tell our legend which ever lasts

When we reach the open sea, leaving our home behind
The Dragonheads are rising, let the stars be our guides

See how the forefathers greet, us with northern lights
Bravely towards unknown shores, through raging storms we fight
Faith in the gods, their strength in our hearts, when lightning strikes
If we die the sun will shine again beyond mortal time
We'll meet again in Valhalla!
