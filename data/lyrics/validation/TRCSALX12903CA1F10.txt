Do you think it really matters all that much
If we drive in style or we walk the last mile to the gallows

Though you tried it makes no difference to be told
That you're just too late
But the hangman couldn't wait till the morning

So you walk away confused and feeling ill
But you need the rest
And your head is in a mess, you've been beaten

Give it all away
Give it all away
Give it all away

I feel guilty being free and rich and idle
I'm as much to blame as anyone who allows this man to die
Cause in my eyes
They just hung the wrong man

Do you think it really matters cause you're rich
That you broke the law
While a poor man stayed poor to feed his children

And he finds it so degrading to be told
That he's grown too old
As he walks home in the cold, what can he tell them

As you watch his old grey eyes fill up with tears
As he holds his wife
And says he feels his life is nearly over

Give it all away
Give it all away
Give it all away

I feel guilty being free and rich and idle
I'm as much to blame as anyone who stood back and held his peace
Cause in my eyes they just wronged a true man

Do you think it really matters in the war
If you kill for God
Or you're paid in gold to buy your conscience

I feel guilty being free and rich and idle
I'm as much to blame as any one who shuts his eyes at what he sees
Cause in my eyes the world's wrong and God is dead

Give it all away
Give it all away
Give it all away

I feel guilty being free and rich and idle
I'm as much to blame as anyone who stood back and held his peace
Cause in my eyes they just wronged a true man

Do you think it really matters in the war
If you kill for God
Or you're paid in gold to buy your conscience

I feel guilty being free and rich and idle
I'm as much to blame as any one who shuts his eyes at what he sees
Cause in my eyes the world's wrong and God is dead

Yes, in my eyes the world's wrong and God is dead
