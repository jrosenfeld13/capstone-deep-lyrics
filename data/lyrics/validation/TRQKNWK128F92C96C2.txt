Shattered dreams are misunderstood
They left me stranded like I knew they would
All this pain's changing into good
'Cause you got me
You got me
Now you're the only one that I adore
'Cause everybody else has fallen short
I know you'd never leave me wanting more
Some come on
Come on

Don't stop telling me
You'll never know
The way it feels to be let go
The tragedy of being so alone
A distant memory
My heart is telling me
That's just something
You'll never know
Ooooooo

I get the feeling now that You are here
You love is something that won't disappear
Whisper to me while You hold me near
You got me
You got me

Don't stop telling me
You'll never know
The way it feels to be let go
The tragedy of being so alone
A distant memory
My heart is telling me
That's just something
You'll never know
Ooooooo
You'll never know
Ooooooo

Over and over and over again
Tell me
Over and over again

Don't stop telling me
You'll never know
The way it feels to be let go
The tragedy of being so alone
A distant memory
My heart is telling me
That's just something
You'll never know
Ooooooo
You'll never know
Ooooooo
You'll never know
Ooooooo
You'll never know
Ooooooo
