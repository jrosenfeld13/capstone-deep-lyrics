The sea is like a neverending tune
And it comforts with its wave so pure
Comes in every corner of my body
And smiles and warmes
And it peels me with the sand
I wish i could convert to waves
And become the sea
Then i could clean you, clean you

Moments are scratching on my knee
I fight with the thoughts of fear
Fear for the loneliness i know
I'm alone as the sea
'Cause the pain you do in me
I wish i could convert to you
And you to the sea
"Clean me, clean me!"
