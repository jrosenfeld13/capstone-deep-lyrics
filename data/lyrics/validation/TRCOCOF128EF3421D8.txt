La, la la la
La la la la, la la la
La la la la, come on
Come on, come on

Make yourself free
Make yourself grow
Come on up into the attic
Come and see the glow
A pretty idiot is kissing
Everyone she doesn't know
And the pigs are eating popcorn
Selling tickets to the show

Give yourself away
Feel the wind blow
We're watching movies on the ceiling
All the artiest we know
If there's someone you don't like
You don't have say hello
There's no reason you should leave
There's no reason you should go

La, la la la
La la la la, la la la
La la la la, come on
Come on, come on

Take yourself out
Hit the tambourine
We have loaded up your eyes
And fed you tangerines
If you open up your box
You will find a type machine
If you try to find a scratch
There'll be no signs where you have been

Give yourself up
Make yourself sing
Don't tell us that you can't
You need assembling
Da da da, da da da da da
Da da da, da da da da da

La, la la la
La la la la, la la la
La la la la, come on
Come on, come on

Da da da, da da da da da
Da da da, da da da da da

La, la la la
La la la la, la la la
La la la la, come on
Come on, come on

La, la la la
La la la la, la la la
La la la la, come on
Come on, come on
