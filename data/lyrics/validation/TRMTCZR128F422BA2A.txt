Pick up the paper and what do I see
A mad dog killer - gonna set him free
Some other kid with a minor crime
Judge gave him twenty to ninety nine
Too late to change the slate
It's a stone cold deal and it's goin' down every day

I heard about the cops down in Mexico
Tried to make a drug bust and wouldn't you know
They were all executed when they got too near
Makes you realize we got a lot to fear
Too bad - it's kinda sad
A stone cold deal and it's makin' everybody mad

It's a cryn' shame
All in vain
Who to blame
It's always gonna be the same
People rob and steal
They can't afford a meal
It's a dirty deal
And that's the way I feel
It's a stone cold deal but we all got to try to change

All the politicians on the tv news
Make you any promises they damn well choose
Multi million dollars in the campaign float
Is it any wonder they can get your vote
Too fake for me to take
A stone cold deal when there's so many things at stake

It's a cryin' shame
All in vain
Who to blame when we all got to try and change
People rob and steal
They can't afford a meal
We got a dirty deal
And that's the way I feel
A stone cold deal but we all got to try and change
