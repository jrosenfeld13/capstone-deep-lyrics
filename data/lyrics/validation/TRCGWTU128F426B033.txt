One man in his darkness, lying in his tomb
Waiting for the silence to greet his final moon
Shadows start to gather, embracing his release
A journey to the darkside, a forever rest in peace

There will be light if you believe
Just let your memories flow free

Show me light where only shadows breed
Embrace my soul and set me free

Honoured in remembrance, locked in precious mind
Mourned among the living - a hurt that never dies
Kept alive through heartbeats, and within bloodline
Failed to be forgiven, erased by human kind
