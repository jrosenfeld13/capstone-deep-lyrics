There was a time I thougt I knew it all in matters of the heart
Now looking back in time I realize I'd only made a start
You gotta hold of me
You showed me what it's all about

Now I feel warm wind rushin' in making my emotions start to spin
No
I can't explain this state I'm in
Guess I must be lerning
The facts of love
Sweet loving
The facts of love
The facts of love
Sweet loving

Sometimes I wonder how I ever lived before you came my way
Now I'm addicted to your kiss
It feels like thunder's runnin' through my veins

Like some kind of miracle's happening
Taking me up higher than I've evr been
You start a fire burning deep within physically revealing
The facts of love
Sweet loving

Now I feel warm wind rushin' in making my emotions start to spin
No
I can't explain this state I'm in
Guess I must be lerning

Like some kind of miracle's happening
