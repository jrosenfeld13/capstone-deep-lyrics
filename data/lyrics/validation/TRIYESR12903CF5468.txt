[Verse 1]
I think you're livin' in denial
Oh, can't you see she's pretty wild?
And every night I pray that you don't knock her up
'Cause I still want to be the mother of your child
They say "L'amour est n  Paris"
So she's planned a little trip to France
While she's in anxious anticipation
I really hope you have a horrible vacation
And so you think of me when you arrive
Hope the French fleas eat you both alive
And your room smells
And the toilet doesn't flush
And the locals treat you mean
And the service takes too long

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm fragile
And you broke my heart in two
But you just smile
Like it's all the same to you, to you

[Chorus]
When you learn your lesson
Come back like a prodigal son
And read the big sign at the airport
Bienvenue from hell, mon amour
When you learn your lesson
Come back like a prodigal son
And read the big sign at the airport
Bienvenue from hell, mon amour

[Verse 2]
Where did you get the ability
To make fakes promises to me?
You are exactly like a politician
Need everyone's approval just to see if you're doing right
And I hope you freeze under the Eiffel Tower
So you end up throwing in the towel
Hope you'll miss me
And someday you're gonna see
That I put my trust in you
But you turned your back to me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm fragile
And you broke my heart in two
But you just smile
Like it's all the same to you, to you

[Chorus]
When you learn your lesson
Come back like a prodigal son
And read the big sign at the airport
Bienvenue from hell, mon amour
When you learn your lesson
Come back like a prodigal son
And read the big sign at the airport
Bienvenue from hell, mon amour

[Hook]
What's your destination?
What's your destination?

[Chorus]
When you learn your lesson
Come back like a prodigal son
And read the big sign at the airport
Bienvenue from hell, mon amour
When you learn your lesson
Come back like a prodigal son
And read the big sign at the airport
Bienvenue from hell, mon amour
Mon amour, mon amour

[Outro]

Passengers with destination
Passengers with destination to hell
