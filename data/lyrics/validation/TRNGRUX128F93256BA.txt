We are the ones who will never be broken
We are the ones who survive
This is the sound that brings us together
You are the one by our side

And through it all, and through it all, the spirit's alive
And through it all, your spirit's alive

You are the memory that lives on forever
The shadow that stands by our side
This is the sound that keeps us together
We are the ones who survive

And through it all, and through it all, the spirit's alive
And through it all, your spirit's alive

Farewell my brother, you're off to the big rink in the sky
The good lord's between the pipes
And you've got Bavis and Ace on the wing

We are the ones who will never be broken
We are the ones who survive

And through it all, and through it all, the spirit's alive
And through it all, your spirit's alive

This is the sound that brings us together
You are the one by our side
