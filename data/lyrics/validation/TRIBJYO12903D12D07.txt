I'm not a doctor
I'm not a lawyer
I'm not an actor
And I'm not a priest
I'm not a hostess
Waiting to fuck you
I'm not a waiter
I wanna be served
So give me the menu
I don't want the meal
'cause I'm not a buyer
Of anything cheap
All that I live for
All that I ask for
All that I have here
Belongs to you
I'm not a preacher
I'm not in uniform
How can I miss you
If you won't go away?
You should have been there
Basking in sunshine
Now i wanna spoil your day
The closer I get
The closer I get
