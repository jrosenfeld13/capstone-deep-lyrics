Beautiful people come down on, right

Me see the sunrise, I wanna get down down down
The tide is rising high, all the way
No raindrop in the sky, no reason to run run run
Watch all these spirits fly, sees the day

Be one generation, join the love foundation
We'll make it all the way
To a brighter day now
Feel the desperation
Every human nation
All around the world go feel it

After the love shined down on me
I see the beautiful sunlight rising above the world
What me say now

After the love shined down on me
All ya beautiful people love and you rise, me say

Me see the sunrise, I wanna get down down down
The tide is rising high, all the way
There's a night we'll learning, feel the fire burning
It will shine a light to the darkest night yo
No more compromising, feel the hope is rising high, right

It was deeper sink
And me fall down
Into new river blow
One world, one heart
And one understanding yo
No corruption
There's love a spread you know
As them duelling deep inside you
'Cause after the love
Come peace and harmony

After the love shined down on me
I see the beautiful sunlight rise in a party way
What me say now

After the love shined down on me
I see beautiful people love and you rise, me say
Beautiful people come down on, right

After the love shined down on me
