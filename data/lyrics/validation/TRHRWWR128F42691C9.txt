Once upon a time, there was a harlot
Who had taken all she could
Just one wrong look from a stranger
Finally pushed her straight over the edge

Beware the angel of death
Don't let her fool you
She is evil
Hear my warning
The bitch is back to show you
What she's made of

She's known as the Mistress of Mischief
The Queen of the Damned
Rage flows through her veins
And pumps the blood of hate inside her

You will be the first of many victims
That she plans to terminate
She has chosen execution style
As the path to meet your fate

Just the beginning of terror in the heartland
She is dangerous
Hearing voices
Sadistic messages from
Satan's minions

She's known as the Mistress of Mischief
The Queen of the Damned
Rage flows through her veins
And pumps the blood of hate inside her

Eyes of violet, so hypnotic
Just one look is blinding
Her lips have been laced with venom
Just one taste is deadly

To her, you are a waste of human life
And should not be allowed to live
Murder is the drug she feeds upon
To satisfy her tainted needs

She's known as the Mistress of Mischief
The Queen of the Damned
Rage flows through her veins
And pumps the blood of hate inside her

Eyes of violet, so hypnotic
Just one look is blinding
Her lips have been laced with venom
Just one taste is deadly
