Don't leave
I want you to stay home

Why can't you save her?
Why won't you show her the book?
Choose time for you, but never for her
You want her to live but she was gone

The day that she had her

Why won't you turn back the sky page?
Why won't you show her the book?
You choose time for you but never for her
You weren't even there when she was born

I want to feel what your mother felt
I want to see the days gone by
The day that she had her
One can remember
The Fourth of July

Why won't you turn the sky?
Why won't you show her the way?
You choose time for him, never for him

Why won't you turn back the sky page?
Why won't you show her the book?
You took time for you but never for her
You weren't even there when she was born

Can you feel it?
Can you?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

The day that she had her

I want to feel what your mother felt

Why won't you turn back the sky page?
Why won't you show her the book?
I want to feel what your mother felt
The day she had her
Did she leave it all behind?
Did she leave it all behind?
