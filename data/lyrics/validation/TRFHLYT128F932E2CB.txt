I stared at walls and I was almost breakin'
Who knew another love was somewhere wakin'
I had to learn to stop, the ground from shakin'

Well, all I know is very hard to measure
'Cause it keeps changin' with the changin' weather
I only know it's only getting better

And what it is, is life

And when it comes to matters of the heart
Who you belong to, holdn' on to
It's the deepest point of view in anyone
Just when it comes to matters of the heart

Just keep listenin'
To the little voice there in the glistening
It will surely be uplifting

I don't want to worry 'bout tomorrow
Or become a prisoner to the sorrow
I'll be the lender if you need to borrow

And what it is, is life

And when it comes to matters of the heart
Who you belong to, holdn' on to
It's the deepest point of view in anyone
Just when it comes to matters of the heart
