Ooh, ooh yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Well, oh shorty
Baby, listen girl
Ooh (Excuse me)

She was standing on 125th
Waiting on the 6, one hand on her hip
Puffing a splif, post up on the block
Like the baddest chick
So I asked her one question like
Wait a minute, who you wit?
I'm in a flyest whip, rims spinning and s***
I pulled over on the curb, had to represent
Hey girl, it's not safe out here walking alone
Hop your pretty a** in, I'll take you home

Shorty what's your name
I'm in love with your stance
You got me wide open, I?m feeling your game
I know that other cats might tell you the same
I'm not your average guy, girl I?m far from a lame
Let's hit the LQ, cop whatever you drink
And we can get open right in back of the Range
Or hit the hotel, turn out the penthouse suite
It won't be the last time I promise I'ma holla again

She got a** like whoa
Couldn't keep that on the low
The girl was straight blazing from head to toe
(Ja you gotta be careful she might be under age)
Girl lets see some ID, no you won't get me
As a fact on that, I?m about to fall back
I can easily replace you
I'm not trying to get locked up
She said she's riding shot gun, her license says 20+
Bring your pretty a** on girl, let's get it on

Shorty what's your name
I'm in love with your stance
You got me wide open, I'm feeling your game

I know that other cats might tell you the same
I'm not your average guy, girl I'm far from a lame
Let's hit the LQ, cop whatever you drink
And we can get open right in back of the Range
Or hit the hotel, turn out the penthouse suite
It won't be the last time I promise I'ma holla again

Baby come inside, mommy close the door
Take off all your clothes
Tell me what you waiting for
Let me rub your back and your stomach too
Stretch your toes, turn around love I got you
Did I warn you yet, I'm a rough neck
Damn good in bed
I promise I'm gone make you sweat
Would you mind if I want to squeeze you, tease you
I just want to please you

Shorty what's your name
I'm in love with your stance
You got me wide open, I'm feeling your game
I know that other cats might tell you the same
I'm not your average guy, girl I'm far from a lame
Let's hit the LQ, cop whatever you drink
And we can get open right in back of the Range
Or hit the hotel, turn out the penthouse suite
It won't be the last time I promise I'ma holla again

Shorty was standing on, standing on
Standing, I know, I know, I know
Feeling her game, yeah
