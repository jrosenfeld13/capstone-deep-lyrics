Way back home where the cyprass grew
In a clapboard shack on the black bayou
Lived a women and a man that I called mom and dad
And times were hard and times were tough
We barely had nothin but we didn't need much
Except for the love a women and a man
And daddy worked his fingers to the bone
But I know my momma was the reason he was strong

Everybody knows if the cold wind blows
The seeds dont sprout and the crops won't grow
Even though you've done the best you can
And when youre livin in a house that you dont own
And the money in the bank is almost gone
The only thing in life I know that stands
Is the love between a women and a man

Well I grew up workin like my daddy did
Broke the land with my hands and the money rolled in
But it wasn't enough and I did not understand, noo
You see the only thing that matters that money can't buy
And when it gets right down to the bottom line
It's the love you find between a women and a man

Everything daddy said was true
Cause my life was not complete until I found you

Everybody knows if the cold wind blows
The seeds dont sprout and the crops won't grow
Even though you've done the best you can
And when youre livin in a house that you dont own
And the money in the bank is almost gone
The only thing in life I know that stands
Is the love between a women and a man

Everybody knows if the cold wind blows
The seeds dont sprout and the crops won't grow
Even though you've done the best you can
And when youre livin in a house that you dont own
And the money in the bank is almost gone
The only thing in life I know that stands
Is the love between a women and a man

Only thing in life that stands
Is the love between a women and a man
