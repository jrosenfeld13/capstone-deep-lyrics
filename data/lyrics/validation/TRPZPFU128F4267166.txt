Midnight, moonbeam, sepulchre
Graveyard cold as bones
Eliza is in the ground
Thunder is her moan
A hound dog in the distance howls
To a church bell in the rain
Concrete angels pray
For those who've got no names
There's a Bible in the mud
Open to proverbs from the sky
You can't turn the pages
It's to wet to even try
I'm walking trough the graveyard
Looking for Eliza's name
She cuts me with the wind
Stabs me with the rain
(saying) "I forgot to remember
What it is that I know
I'm lying in the graveyard
I've got no place to go"
Uh, uh, in the graveyard
Uh, uh, in the grave...
She was of my blood
My sweat and my bones
But I killed her with love
So I could be alone
And now that I'm alone
All I fell is pain
Like a cold steel knife
As it cuts into her veins
Good bye sweet Eliza
I release to the void
You're to weak to exist
And too strong to be destroyed
But please, show me a sign
Everything is gona be all right
That your chrysalis death
Will soon return to life
'Cause I forgot to remember
What it is that I know
I'm lying in the graveyard
I've got no place to go
Uh, uh, in the graveyard
Uh, uh, in the grave...
