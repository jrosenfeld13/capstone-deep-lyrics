You're not allowing me to breathe
The man said
I've no room to move
And all of this discussion
Is ringing in my head

This is not an issue of love
No not anymore
She said it's a matter of your freedom
Which really means
Me watching you walk through that door

Freedom for you to roam
The earth and the seventh seas
Freedom to leave your child
No don't look at me please

I know I ain't as pretty
As the day we met

Our bed it ain't as warm
But I've got love for you still inside of me yet
Love for you, still inside of me yet
