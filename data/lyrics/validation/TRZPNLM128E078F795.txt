I am a full grown fool and I shoulda known better
But I tried and I tried and I could not forget her
I would go back to her time after time
Man I must have been out of my mind

All of that cryin' for nothing
All of that tryin' for nothing
What has it ever got me
What has it ever taught me
I've got to keep believing
In somethin' baby
'Stead of just tryin' for nothing
Cryin' for nothin' at all

Well we fought for love and we fought for trust
And the whole blessed time it was right there in front of us
We could not reach it and I don't know why
It took so long just to say goodbye

All of that cryin' for nothing
All of that tryin' for nothing
What has it ever got me
What has it ever taught me

I've got to keep believing
In somethin' baby
'Stead of just tryin' for nothing
Cryin' for nothin' at all

Well her friends all told her, mine told me
But we would not listen, could not see
Me and my pride, her and her dreams
We never ever stood a chance it seems

All of that cryin' for nothing
All of that tryin' for nothing
What has it ever got me
What has it ever taught me
I've got to keep believing
In somethin' baby
'Stead of just tryin' for nothing
Cryin' for nothin' at all

'Stead of just tryin' for nothing
Cryin' for nothin' at all
