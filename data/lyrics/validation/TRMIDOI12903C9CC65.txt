Everyday
Sitting by the window
Every night
I wonder where the days go
You're not the only one
Afraid of what you've become

Why does everything
Seem like such a waste of time?

I would try
To put myself together
But every time
I wait for something better
You're not the only one
Who feels like you've come undone

Why does everything
Seem like such a waste of time?
Why does everything
Seem like such a waste of time?

Ohhh
I'd like to know

You're not the only one
Afraid of what you've become

Why does everything
Seem like such a waste of time?
Why does everything
Seem like such a waste of time?
Ohhh
I'd like to know
