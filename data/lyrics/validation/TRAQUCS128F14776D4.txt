Its Time
Express Your Mine
Undress Your Mine (Spoken)

I'm always there, when you walk in
And you never have to speak cos you're body's talkin'
I felt the heat, ooohhhhh I could never tell my momma just what I felt

So ease your mind
And just let your inner feelings show
Lets make the time
And just let your inhibitions flow

You've gotta do what ya wanna
See who ya wanna
Be who you wanna be (express)
Dance when ya wanna
Talk when ya wanna
Be what ya wanna be (express)
Do what ya wanna
With who ya wanna
Whenever ya feel the need (express)
I love the way ya vibing me
So let yourself be free

Express
Undress your mine
Express
Undress your mine

Watching ya stare gets me thinking
That if I dont make my move
Sometime this evening
I'm gonna lose
All the things
That momma told me
I should never do

So ease your mind
And just let your inner feelings show
Lets make the time
And just let your inhibitions flow

You've gotta do what ya wanna
See who ya wanna
Be who you wanna be (express)
Dance when ya wanna
Talk when ya wanna
Be what ya wanna be (express)
Do what ya wanna
With who ya wanna
Whenever ya feel the need (express)
I love the way ya vibing me
So let yourself be free

Express (its time)
Express (its time)

There may be times
When you're drinking
When your mouth doesn't always say what your bodies thinking
But it feels oh so good
Oh like you know it should

So ease your mind
And just let your inner feelings show
Lets make the time
And just let your inhibitions flow

You've gotta do what ya wanna
See who ya wanna
Be who you wanna be
Dance when ya wanna
Talk when ya wanna
Be what ya wanna be
Do what ya wanna
With who ya wanna
Whenever ya feel the need
I love the way ya vibing me
So let yourself be free
