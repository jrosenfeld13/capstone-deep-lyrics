Jesus if you need a break you can stay with him and me
We gots ourselves a radio but we ain't got no t.v
We inherited a black mercedes benz
We could go for long sunday drives
Jesus we ain't much for work we could waste the days together
You could sneak us into the matinee through the locked doors of the theater
Jesus if our women comes around
You'll have to hide cause they think our friends are a bad influence

Glory be everyone is guilty
Glory be everyone is guilty

Jesus once we've rested up we could go out the people
This time try a new approach avoiding church and steeple
Jesus your name still would draw a crowd
It would help our careers if we could warm up your show
Jesus once you hit the stage the crowd won't make a sound
You could tell them how your here to stay say your sorry for not being round
Say you will not stone them for their sloth
Say now you are rested and ready to lead the way

Glory be everyone is guilty
Glory be everyone is guilty

Takin bout Jesus
(Glory Glory)
Talkin bout Jesus
(We are all guilty)

Jesus there'll be people who will wonder where you been
Off on a sabbatical leaving us here with our sin
Fending for ourselves for all these years
Blowing up faith for demanding you

You see sir some people are going to say that I'm mad at you
You know how you're always touching people sir
Well some people just don't wanna be touched
You come down to us and said you'd return you never did return
And that's a lie and a lie is a sin
And every time that slim and I have sinned
We've had to stand up and take account

Maybe it's time to take account
Maybe it's time to take a count
Maybe it's time to take account
Maybe it's time to take a count
Maybe it's time to take account
Maybe it's time to take a count
