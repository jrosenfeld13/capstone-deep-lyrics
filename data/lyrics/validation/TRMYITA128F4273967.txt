[Verse 1]
There was a face on a hoarding that someone had drawn on
And just enough time for the night to pass by without warning
Away in the distance there's a blue flashing light
Someone's in trouble somewhere tonight
As the flickering neon stands ready to fuse
The wind blows away all of yesterday's news

[Verse 2]
Well they've locked up their daughters
And they battened the hatches
They always could find us
But they never could catch us
Through the grease streaked windows
Of an all night cafe

We watched the arrested get taken away
And that cigarette haze has ecology beat
As the whores and the drunks filed in from the street

[Chorus]
Cause the steams in the boiler the coals in the fire
If you ask how I am then I'll just say inspired
If the thorn of a rose is the thorn in your side
Then you're better off dead if you haven't yet died

[Break]
Oh (Oh)
Oh
Oh (La, la, la)
Oh (la, la, la)

Ah!
Ah!
La-la-la-la-la...

[Chorus]
Cause the steams in the boiler the coals in the fire
If you ask how I am then I'll just say inspired
If the thorn of a rose is the thorn in your side
Then you're better off dead if you haven't yet died

[Outro]
Better off dead
Better off dead
Better off dead
Better off dead
Better off dead
Better off dead
Better off dead
Better off dead
