Let's keep it simple, just for fun
Don't speak of this to anyone
I've seen the way you look in my eyes
I know that you're ready to fly
I put my cards out on the table
You know I'm willing, I know you're able
Stars are out, the night is young
Little wild one

I need you like the air that I breathe
I need you like the sky and the trees
I need you like you wouldn't believe
I need you like the sun
Little wild one

I've thrown away all my defenses
No way of knowing what the end is
I'll make it simple, I'll take it slow
It's there if you're ready to go
If you are hurting I wanna heal it
I'll be your heaven, oh can't you feel it
The fire's burning, the time has come
Little wild one

I need you like the air that I breathe
I need you like the sky and the trees
I need you like you wouldn't believe
I need you like the sun
Little wild one

I need you like the heavens above
I need you like the one that I love
For all you are and all you'll become
I love you like the sun
Little wild one
Little wild one
