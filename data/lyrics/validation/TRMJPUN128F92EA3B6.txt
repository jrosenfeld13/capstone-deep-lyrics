I saw you there
Just standing there
And I thought I was only dreaming, yeah

I kissed you then
Then once again
You said you would come and dance with me

Dance with me
Across the sea
And we can feel the motion of a thousand dreams

Doctor! Doctor!
Can't you see I'm burning, burning
Oh Doctor! Doctor!
Is this love I'm feeling?

Ships at night
Give such delight
But we all leave before the morning light

Please don't go
No, please don't go
Cause I don't want to stay here on my own

Oh Doctor! Doctor!
Can't you see I'm burning, burning
Oh Doctor! Doctor!
Is this love I'm feeling?

Doctor! Doctor!
Can't you see I'm burning, burning
Oh Doctor! Doctor!
Is this love I'm feeling?

Fever breathe your love on me
Take away my name
Fever lay your hands on me
Never be the same

Oh Doctor! Doctor!
Can't you see I'm burning, burning
Oh Doctor! Doctor!
Is this love I'm feeling?

Doctor! Doctor!
Can't you see I'm burning, burning
Oh Doctor! Doctor!
Is this love I'm feeling?

Come with me
And make believe
We can travel to eternity
