[Verse]
The scene was a small roadside cafe
The waitress was sweeping the floor
Two truck drivers drinking their coffee
And two Okie kids by the door
"How much are them candies?" they asked her
"How much have you got?" she replied
"We've only a penny between us."
"Them's two for a penny," she lied
And the daylight grew heavy with thunder
With the smell of the rain on the wind
Ain't it just like a human?
Here comes that rainbow again
One truck driver called to the waitress
After the kids went outside
"Them candies ain't two for a penny,"
"So what's it to you?" she replied
In silence they finished their coffee
Got up and nodded goodbye
She called,"Hey, you left too much money."
"So what's it to you?" they replied
And the daylight was heavy with thunder
With the smell of the rain on the wind
Ain't it just like a human?
Here comes that rainbow again
Ain't it just like a human?
Here comes that rainbow again
