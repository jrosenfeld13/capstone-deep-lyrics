Nothing really changes
Everything remains the same
We are what we are till the day that we die
Nothing really changes
Everything remains the same
We are what we are till the day that we die

If we could live in Shakespeare's days
I wonder who we'd be
If people then could live today
I wonder who we'd see
They'd prob'ly stop a corner cop
And ask what the whole world 's coming to
If people then could live today
I wonder what they'd do
Yes I wonder what they'd do

Would Romeo and Juliet watch Nelson Eddy kiss Jeanette
Would Bacchus read police gazette
And window peep at silhouettes
Would Caesar pay to see the mets
Would Icarus join the jet set
Would Satan smoke menthol cigarettes
Would Samson razor with Gilettes

Nothing really changes
Everything remains the same
We are what we are till the day that we die
(unless we love the Lord)
Nothing really changes
Everything remains the same
We are what we are till the day that we die

Would Henry VIII use etiquette
In a busy New York luncheonette
Would Cleopatra die when when bit
Or save herself with a tourniquet
Would Beethoven join a jazz quartet
Would Ben Hur drive a blue corvette
Would Aristotle be an acid head
Would Cain kill Abel with a bayonet

Nothing really changes
Everything remains the same
We are what we are till the day that we die
(unless we love the Lord)
Nothing really changes
Everything remains the same
We are what we are till the day that we die
