(featuring India.Arie)

No butterflies no butterfingers
No "ah me" that lingers
On and on when you are gone
No last dance from the lake swan
No string quartet playing in my head
No sweet Juliet
No thunder bolt from up above
Just good old plain old concrete love
Good old plain old concrete love
No jelly legs no trembling weak knees
No belly knots in me
I can eat and I can sleep
No twisted tongue that can't speak
No lunar walk no floating cloud talk
No ten out of ten to report
No thunderbolt from up above

Chorus
You snuck up on me
You waited patiently
You snuck up on me

Chorus

Won't you come
Won't you come over darling
Won't you come
Cause I want some
Bring it on bring it on
Over
Concrete love
