I was so blind
I couldn't see the truth
I was unable to see how my life was being used
To be something so miniscule
Everything i thought was so definite
I thought was so real was thrown away and will be remembered among unpaling hatred

[Chorus]
Consider my suffering
Through all your pain
Remember my face
I'm digging your grave
Since when was so sacred
Turning into something so wrong
Something so important to me
Cheapened and exploited
I won't be that way, I can't, I can't be that way again
I can't, I won't, I will never let it

[repeat Chorus]
For the rest of your fucking
Life you will mark my words
