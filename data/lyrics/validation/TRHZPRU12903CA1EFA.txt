I was born with an all-needing money bag
I would sleep with my hand on my money bag
I would dream of the things that I never had

You wake up and you find yourself alone
Everything is changing so fast
You can't hold it back
Out on the street you fight to get somewhere
Just so as you can brag
Every hand is pointing at me and my money bag

I was lost in my search for a better time
I was hooked on the end of a broken line
I would dream of a love that was never mine

You wake up and you find yourself alone
Everything is changing so fast
You can't hold it back
Out on the street you fight to get somewhere
Just so as you can brag
Every hand is pointing at me and my money bag
