You never knew
The things your beauty made me want to do
As if you'd care
As if you'd ever let me take you there

I guess you'll never see
What you could have had in me
It never could be true
Thing i only could've felt inside of you

I saw your eyes
I knew that you were gone it's no surprise
I kissed your face
I didn't know it would invade your space

I guess you'll never see
What you could've had in me
It never could be true
Thing i only could've felt inside of you
I guess that's true
