War inside my head
War inside my head
War inside my head
War inside my head

[Verse 1]
War inside my head ain't a pretty sight
But I don't want no sympathy
It's happened a thousand times before
It's just a harsh reality

[Hook]
War inside my head-can you hear it
War inside my head-can you see it
War inside my head-can you sense it
War inside my head
Can you hear my-pain
Can you see my-pain
Can you sense my-pain
Can you feel my-pain
Can you help my-pain
Can you fix my-pain
Can you hear the war inside my head

[Verse 2]
The only thing real is the way I feel
And that's the pain that's deep inside
The battle from within is gonna begin
And there ain't nowhere to hide

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
War inside my head every night and day
I never get no piece of mind
It ought to be a sin, I just can't win
And pure hell is all I find
