I got my own roots to water
I got my own family tree
Got my own set of heroes
That mean something to me

Got my own way of prayin'
My very own way to sing
Still I'm Connected to you
And everyone and everything

Got my own list of questions
Got my own truth to live
Got my own hand-made gifts
That I'm longin to give

Got my own star to follow
My own rivers to cross
In my own time...

I got my own roots to water
I got my own family tree
Got my own set of heroes
That mean something to me

Got my own road to travel
My own stories to tell
In my own time...

Got my own way of talkin'
Got my own way to smile
Got my own way of walkin'
My own lookin' style

Got my own way of prayin'
My very own way to sing
Still I'm Connected to you
And everyone and everything, yeah everything...

Still I'm Connected to you
And everyone and everything, everything, everything...
