A waiter must have real bad luck
Associate's a sitting duck, yeah

I think of all the things I bring
And only want to bring what I want
A brand new Orange instead
A brand new Orange instead
A brand new Orange instead

I'd love to come here here any time I want
I could make anything you want
So I could get some sleep at night, and leave the house to eat alright

A brand new Orange instead
A brand new Orange instead
Yeah, some nights are red

Some nights are red when I want my eyes blue again
A brand new Orange instead, so the shower just leaks a little bit
Sometimes it's loud cause the neighbors just mind a little bit
Where I can be proud, and people can care a little bit

A brand new Orange instead
A brand new Orange instead
A brand new Orange instead

So I can be bored again
A brand new Orange instead
So the days can be slow again
