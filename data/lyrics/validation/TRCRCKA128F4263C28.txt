They say that nothin' lasts forever
And things can fall apart in a day
We've been so happy together, oh
I just want you to know, I'm here to stay, oh

So if your luck ever leaves you
And your friends don't call
If they should ever deceive you
I won't let you fall

'Cause if it all comes tumble tumble down
You know I'm the one who'll always need you so
I'm the one who'll never let you go
If it all comes crashin' to the ground

You know I'm the one who'll find you anywhere
I'm the girl you know who'll always care
If it all comes tumble tumble down

They say that the city's gonna slide in the ocean
And rain's gonna fall for forty days
Nothin' can stop my sweet devotion
Nothin' could make me go away

'Cause if the world goes crazy
And we lose it all
Reach out and catch me
Don't let me fall

'Cause if it all comes tumble tumble down
You know I'm the one who'll always need you so
I'm the one who'll never let you go

If it all comes tumble tumble down
You know I'm the one who'll always understand
I'm the one who'll take you by the hand
If it all comes tumble tumble down
If it all comes tumble tumble down

Mi nah gon' leave you
Mi a gon' show you that mi love is true
Please believe me, hug mi up an' squeeze me
Doubt mi never, mi nah gon' hurt you ever
'Cause mi love is forever, you and I together

'Cause if the world goes crazy
And we lose it all
Reach out and catch me
Don't let me fall

'Cause if it all comes tumble tumble down
You know I'm the one who'll always need you so
I'm the one who'll never let you go

If it all comes crashin' to the ground, oh
You know I'm the one who'll find you anywhere
I'm the girl you know who'll always care
If it all comes tumble tumble down

If it all comes tumble tumble down
If it all comes tumble tumble down
Tumble down, down, down
