Right beside the decoy
The river inhales the sea
God good god good god good god
The atmospheric pressure is somehow controlling me
Hide in glove-compartments
Don't ever believe in me
God good god good god good god
The dream readers are sleepy don't take them too seriously

The mathematician showed no sign of life
The nurses knew the man was just a child
The curse of words that made him hesitate
Went cheer up boy 'cause everythings just great

Sometimes I'm fed up with faces and sometimes I stare
Sometimes I'm faithful and sometimes I don't really care
I don't mind falling behind
And I keep speakers under my pillow to keep it in mind

Now the moon will hit you
And nothing will ever change
God good god good god good god
I freeze up far too often.... enough is enough for me

I made a quick decision to calm down
And left their open mouths without a sound
I found no reason to complete the score
No reason but a door behind the door

Sometimes I'm saving up favours and fake alibis
Sometimes I'm honest and sometimes I'm purposely shy
I don't mind falling behind
And I keep speakers under my pillow to keep it in mind
