Free, free from my past, free from the pain
Free from the guilt that would cause me to be ashamed
Once, once I was blind but now I see clearly
The debt that I owe Jesus paid for me
No more chains are binding me, I'm totally free

Even my human desires, desire to crucify my soul
Could not await the, the fact that You made me whole
Time after time I remind myself that Your mercies each day are new
Help me oh Lord to establish and know that at Calvary I was redeemed

Free, free from my past, free from the pain
Free from the guilt that would cause me to be ashamed
Once, once I was blind but now I see clearly
The debt that I owe Jesus paid for me
No more chains are binding me, I'm totally free

Even though I was a sinner
You commended Your grace and Your love toward me
Saved me from death and destruction
Gave me life eternally

Not after my sins have You dealt with me, Lord
I'm so grateful for all You do
Iniquity doesn't take my reward
You still love me and tell I am Your own

Free, free from my past, free from the pain
Free from the guilt that would cause me to be ashamed
Once, once I was blind but now I see clearly
The debt that I owe Jesus paid for me
No more chains are binding me, I'm totally free

Free, free from my past, free from the pain
Free from the guilt that would cause me to be ashamed
Once, once I was blind but now I see clearly
The debt that I owe Jesus paid for me
No more chains are binding me, I'm totally free
