[Verse 1]
I've been hanging around, feeling up, feeling down
It's like I'm blown in by something I don't understand
Hey, it's been really nice, we went for a drink, we went for a drive
Faced out one million hopeless nights

[Chorus]
I've got the spirit
I've got the spirit
It won't last

[Verse 2]
Behind the esso balloon, I laughed so much I split in two
Now I've got so much fear inside me, nothing's true
Now I've got so much fear inside me, nothing's true
Now I've got so much fear inside me, nothing's true

[Chorus]
I've got the spirit
I've got the spirit
It won't last
