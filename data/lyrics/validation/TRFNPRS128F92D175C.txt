[Verse 1]
Now wait just a minute, what is this I see?
Is that you? Don't your remember me?
You're not the same person that I knew
So where'd you go? What'd you do to yourself?
You were much better when we used to get down
Remember then there was nothing in your sound

[Chorus]
Girl you know
(Girl you know)
You like the taste of the wine
(You like the taste of the wine)
Oh I don't know who you're trying to fool
Girl you know
(Girl you know you like the taste of the wine)

[Verse 2]
You should be ashamed of the way you appear
Guide yourself, don't you give me no tears
You used to be carefree and that was your only way
And now a school teacher you try to read a date
There were times we rocked all night long
So don't pretend that feeling is gone

[Chorus]
Girl you know
(Girl you know)
You like the taste of the wine
(You like the taste of the wine)
You know that I know that you know that girl you know
(Girl you know you like the taste of the wine)

Do it, the way you used to
Do it, the way I remember you

[Verse 3]
You say you don't recognize your pal
Afraid I'd tell you were my good time gal
I see you changed, the image is true
You don't smoke, you don't smoke, what else don't you do?
Cause you were the one who could never get enough
It was good to you then, so don't you pull no stuff

[Chorus]
Girl you know
(Girl you know you like the taste of the wine)
Oh I don't know who you're trying to fool, but I know
Girl you know it
(Girl you know you like the taste of the wine)
Don't try it, can't buy it, don't deny it
Girl you know
(Girl you know you like the taste of the wine)
You like the taste of it, you like the feel of it
You like the touch, very much
Girl you know it
(Girl you know you like the taste of the wine)
You know that I know that you know that I know you know
(Girl you know you like the taste of the wine)
You like the taste of it, you like the taste the wine
(Girl you know you like the taste of the wine)
Oh I remember you from a long time ago, it was so good to me girl
(Girl you know you like the taste of the wine)
Oh don't you try to fool me, oh I know it, come on give it up
(Girl you know you like the taste of the wine)
You know it, I know it, don't try again to deny it baby
(Girl you know you like the taste of the wine)
Do it, do it, the way you used to
(Girl you know you like the taste of the wine)
Do it, do it, the way I remember you
(Girl you know you like the taste of the wine)
