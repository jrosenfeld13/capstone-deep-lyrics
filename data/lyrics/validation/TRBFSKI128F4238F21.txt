When I rise
Early this morning
I see love, I see love in front of me
Yow again

When I rise
Early this morning
I feel Jah, Jah, Jah inside of me
Yow again

It no tek nuttin' ata all
Fi hail the king
Him bless mi in a what mi doing
It no tek nuttin' ata all
Fi hail the king
Selassie I the king of all Kings

What it takes a man to gain the world
And loose his soul?
Prophesy it haffi fulfill
Jah, jah works haffi unfold

To the young and the old, the blind and the dumb
The hype and the meek, the weak and the strong
Give Jah, Jah thanks and carry on

When I rise
Early this morning
I see love, I see love in front of me
Yow again

When I rise
Early this morning
I feel Jah, Jah, Jah inside of me
Yow again

Upful with the king with righteousness

Cause it no tek nuttin' ata all
Fi hail the king
Him bless mi in a what mi doing

Fi hail the king

It no tek nuttin' ata all

Ask the wicked man see a weh him a go do
