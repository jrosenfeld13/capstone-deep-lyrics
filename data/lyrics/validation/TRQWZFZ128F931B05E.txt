I've painted myself into a corner
Bogged down by evidence based conclusions
Reading of entrails
Means nothing to me
Can't help but feel that some form of depression
May in fact be the only sane reaction
To a world
That's heading for an epic fail
How can I
Banish negative thoughts
When everything's so unbearably awful?
Try to inhabit my animal nature
But I trip over my own cynicism
Bark like a dog
Walk like an egyptian
Spent so long staring into the abyss
If the end days come I might not even notice
Flesh eating zombies look like friday night crowds to me
There's not a solution to every problem and there's just too much to know
Confused by the binaries? Just draw your hard line down the middle of the road
Chaos Theory and compassion fatigue become the pillars of our church
But starving children can't eat relativism
Can we not just do what works?
