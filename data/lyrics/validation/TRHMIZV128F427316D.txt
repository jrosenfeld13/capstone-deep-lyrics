Running on magic
I stop for a breath
In this rock 'n roll din
Out in the darkness
I see her hands waving like
Stems in the wind

Sylvie is dancing as high as a kite
Why are her eyes so attracted to light and
Why does she fall for it night after night
Sylvie

We take all our strings
And we take all our drums
And we gun down a golden road
Tattered and crazy
And raging like bums
We've been driven to overload

Sylvie is dancing as high as a kite
Why are her eyes so attracted to light and
Why does she fall for it night after night
Sylvie

Da da da da....
Da da da da....

Sylvie is dancing as high as a kite
Why are her eyes so attracted to light and
Why does she fall for it night after night
Sylvie

Sylvie is dancing as high as a kite
Why are her eyes so attracted to light and
Why does she fall for it night after night
Sylvie, yeah

Sylvie
