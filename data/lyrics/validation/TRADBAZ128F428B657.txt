I know you met someone last night
See it in your eyes
You said "we only talked, alright?"
Now that's a big lie

And I know it's all over now
I guess we lost our love somehow
The moment you left through that door
I know you'll never come back here no more

You came and took your things today
Gave me your ring back
I never thought it'd end this way
Fell in your lovetrap

And I know it's all over now
I guess we lost our love somehow
The moment you left through that door
I know you'll never come back here no more

You said you're never coming back home
You got me choking
Now that's a typical syndrome
When a heart gets broken
Broken, oh yeah

Cos I know it's all over now
I guess we lost our love somehow
The moment you left through that door
I know you'll never come back here no more

It's all over now
We lost our love somehow
And you left through that door
Now you'll never come back here no more

It's all over now
We lost our love somehow
You left through that door and I know
You'll never come back here no more

Cos it's all over now
It's all over now
