We shouldn't be together tonight
But here we are
I shouldn't taste the thrill of your kiss
Here in the dark
'Cause we're not free to be this free
Or go this far

Hearts on fire
Burning for each other
Going down in flames
Somewhere in the night

Stealing love again
When we're together
It's too late now
We can't put it out
Hearts on fire

You shouldn't feel this good in my arms
But you do
I shouldn't whisper these things in your ear
But they're true
So wrong or right
I'll stay tonight with you

Hearts on fire
Burning for each other
Going down in flames
Somewhere in the night

Stealing love again
When we're together
It's too late now
We can't put it out
Hearts on fire
