[Verse 1]
Take me now, baby, here as I am
Hold me close, try, and understand
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on now, try and understand
The way I feel when I'm in your hands
Take my hand, come under cover
They can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now

[Chorus]
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
(Because the night)

[Verse 2]
Have a doubt, baby, when I'm alone
Love is a ring; a telephone
Love is an angel, disguised as lust
Here in our beds 'til the morning comes

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on now, try and understand
The way I feel, under your command
Take my hand, as the sun descends
They can't touch you now, can't touch you now, can't touch you now

[Chorus]
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
(Because the night)
