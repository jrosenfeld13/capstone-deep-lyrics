We're in the building where they make us grow
And I'm frightened by the liquid engineers
Like you

My Mallory heart is sure to fail
I could crawl around the floor just like I'm real
Like you

The sound of metal
I want to be you
I could learn to be a man
Like you

Plug me in
And turn me on
Oh, everything is moving

I need my treatment, it's tomorrow they send me
Singing, "I am an American"
Do you?

Picture this, if I could make the change
I'd love to pull the wires from the wall
Did you?

And who are you?
And how can I try?
Here inside, I like metal
Don't you?

All I know
Is no one dies
I'm still confusing love with need
