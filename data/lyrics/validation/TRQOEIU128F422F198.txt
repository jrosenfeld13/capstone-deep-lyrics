Why do you cry when you know how the story ends?
How can you laugh when you know that it hurts your friends?
We've all been there once but you never left
This is me coming back, back to get you out

To say goodbye to make amends
I'm not leaving this place unless I'm leaving with you
You're the only person with a half decent heart here
And I know you will put it to use

Until it's gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, yeah

Na na na
Na na na
Na na na

And as you close your eyes for the big sleep
I hope you think of me

Na na na
Na na na
Na na na

And if you go, I'll be gone
And you'll be left alone to live your life, as you please
But someday you'll agree
That I was always meant for you

You were always meant for me
And you will see that you're impossible
You're impossible, you're impossible
You're impossible

Me and Mr. Dylan on the ride home
We had a heart to heart about life
But neither him or me could decide for ourselves
If we wanted to outlive that night

Like two children on the playground of the unconfessed souls
Abandoned by our mothers and our lovers and our foes
If only we were brave enough to live the lives we stole
What a wonderful world this could be

Na na na
Na na na
Na na na

And as you close your eyes for the big sleep
I hope you think of me

Na na na
Na na na
Na na na

And if you go, I'll be gone
And you'll be left alone to live your life, as you please
But someday you'll agree
That I was always meant for you

You were always meant for me
And you will see that you're impossible
You're impossible, you're impossible
You're impossible

So how many more examples until we break?
So how many sacrifices must we make?
Because we've all been there once before
And it looks like we've returned once more
Is this the beginning or the end?

The last two soldiers on the battlefield
Survivors of the war
They aim at one another while their mothers beg the Lord
"If you're listening, I'm missing him
So somehow bring him home, how did it come to this?"

So the soldiers lift their rifles, they're aiming at the head
They think of their first love before they take their final breaths
And somewhere in the distance they hear something someone said
"How did it come to this?"

And as you close your eyes for the big sleep
I hope you think of me, yeah

Na na na
Na na na
Na na na

And as you close your eyes for the big sleep
I hope you think of me

Na na na
Na na na
