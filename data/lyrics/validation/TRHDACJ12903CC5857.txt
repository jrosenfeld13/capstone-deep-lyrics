Me and you standing eye to eye
I read your face, I've known you for so long
Torn in two and I don't know why
What was right somehow now is wrong

I say hey my friend
Don't let it end
We've got to try, try while we still can

I say hey my friend
I don't know when
But there's a time our sun will rise again

What we did, what we said
What we missd and what we had
I cry, I cry over you

I say hey my friend
I say no you can't
Walk away, run away like this
