[Verse:]
Has it failed?
A lie so white it's almost see-through
All we made, a fruitless effort to connect with ourselves
And remain Disconnected

[Verse 2:]
Don't hesitate to sweep this failure under the carpet
As we exchange insincerities as we walk out on ourselves
And remain Disconnected

[Chorus:]
So I slide into the deep end
I was up against something bigger than me
Don't have any access, don't have any answers
To what is inside
So I hide

[Verse 3:]
So here is to safety and it's comfort
I won't know how to get around this or myself to begin with
I remain Disconnected

[Chorus:]
So I slide into the deep end
I was up against something bigger than me
Don't have any access, don't have any answers
To what is inside, To what is inside

Don't have any access, don't have any answers
To what is inside
So I hide

And remain... Disconnected...
