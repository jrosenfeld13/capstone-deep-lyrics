Discarded love today
The north will soon become
I lost too much today
So myth will now become

I threw my life away
And for what?
I blew my chances too
I see the bitter truth
I give up

Relinquish all connection
And being yourself for once
Distrusting insurrection
So thank yourself for once

I threw my life away
And for what?
I blew my chances too
I see the bitter truth
I give up

What seems so real today
Soon will make me come
The thing you always craved
Surely I've become

I threw my life away
And for what?
I blew my chances too
I see the bitter truth
I give up

I threw my life away
And for what?
I blew my chances too
I see the bitter truth
I give up
