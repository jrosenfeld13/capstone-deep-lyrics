The ghost who walks she's on the prowl
For the man she loved he cut her down
It was an ordinary night in June
When he drove her to the lake so they could watch the full moon

The ghost who walks she's on the prowl
For the man she loved he laid her down
In the tall grass he kissed her cheek
But with a knife in his hand he plunged it in deep

She looked at him with pleading eyes
He softly spoke my dear love has died
And then he muffled her desperate cries under the moonlight

The ghost who walks she's on the prowl
Wanders in the moonlight, she's crying to herself
Because his eyes never looked cruel
But the moon in the blade it shimmered like a jewel

She looked at him with pleading eyes
He softly spoke my dear the love has died
And then he muffled her deadly cries under the moonlight
Under the moonlight
Under the moonlight
Under the moonlight
