[Verse 1]
I almost got drunk at school at 14
Where I almost made out with the Homecoming Queen
Who almost went on to be Miss Texas
But lost to a slut with much bigger breastes
I almost dropped out to move to L.A
Where I was almost famous for almost a day

[Chorus]
And I almost had you
But I guess that doesn't cut it
Almost loved you
I almost wish you would've loved me too

[Verse 2]
I almost held up a grocery store
Where I almost did 5 years and then 7 more
Cause I almost got popped for a fight with a thug
Cause he almost made off with a bunch of the drugs
That I almost got hooked on cause you ran away
And I wish I would've had the nerve to ask you to stay

[Chorus]
And I almost had you
But I guess that doesn't cut it
Almost had you
And I didn't even know it
You kept me guessin'
And now I'm destined
To spend my time missin' you
I almost wish you would've loved me too

[Verse 3]
Here I go thinking about all the things I could've done
I'm gonna need a forklift cause all the baggage ways a ton
I know we had our problems; I can't remember one

[Bridge]
I almost forgot to say something else
And if I can't fit it in I'll keep it all to myself
I almost wrote a song about you today
But I tore it all up and then I threw it away!

[Chorus]
And I almost had you
But I guess that doesn't cut it
Almost had you
And I didn't even know it
You kept me guessin'
And now I'm destined
To spend my time missin' you
I almost wish you would've loved me too
