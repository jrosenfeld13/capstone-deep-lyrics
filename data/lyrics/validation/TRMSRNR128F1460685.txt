All the leaves are brown
And the sky-why is grey
I've been for a walk
On a winter's day
If I didn't tell him
I could leave today
California dreamin'
On such a winter's day

Stopped into a church (stopped into a church)
I passed along the way (passed along the way)
Oh, I got down on my knees (got down on my knees)
And I'd pretend to pray (I'd pretend to pray)
You know the preacher likes the co-old
He knows I'm gonna stay
California dreamin' (California dreamin')
On such a winter's day... (such a winter's day)

All the leaves are brown
And the sky is grey
I've been for a walk
On a winter's day
I'd be safe and war-arm (I'd be safe and warm)
If I was in L.A. (if I was in L.A.)
California dreamin' (California dreamin')
On such a winter's day (such a winter's day)

Stopped into a church
I passed along the way
Oh, I got down on my knees (got down on my knees)
And I'd pretend to pray (I'd pretend to pray)
You know the preacher likes the co-old
Well, he knows I'm gonna stay (knows I'm gonna stay)
California dreamin' (California dreamin')
On such a winter's day
(California dreamin')
On such a winter's day
(California dreamin')
On such a winter's day
(California dreamin')
On such a winter's day
(California dreamin')
On such a winter's day
(California dreamin')
On such a winter's day
