Tick tock the clock is like an atom bomb
Five minutes the sun is gonna be gone
I hate the fact that I know today is gonna end
Wish I could stop and rewind and start all over again
Last call for drinks has been and gone
I didn't notice the lights had come on
There were so many people but everybody left now
But we gonna dance until they kick us out
CHORUS
Let's just stay awake all night
I don't wanna waste time sleeping now
Let's just carry on talking
I don't wanna go home yet
And be alone when I could stay here with you
Let's just carry on walking
I know it's late, but let's just stay awake
Four o'clock there's nobody here but us
Two hours I gotta be up
I'll sleep when I'm dead, I'm not ready yet
We gotta keep goin till the sun comes back again
Alright, we can find a way to make it last forever if we just stay awake all night
