I'm living where I don't belong
I think I have to move along
Keep walking fast, don't make a sound
No eye contact, look straight down

And if I make it out alive
I'm moving through the other side

Move along, move along
Move along, move along
Move along, move along
Move along, move along

Don't matter what the shape I'm in
Living here, I just can't win
Don't matter if I'm curt or kind
They hate me there, they my kind

And if I make it out alive
I'm moving through the otherside

Move along, move along
Move along, move along
Move along, move along
Move along, move along

And if I make it out alive
I'm moving through the other side

Move along, move along
Move along, move along
Move along, move along
Move along, move along
Move along, move along
Move along, move along
Move along, move along
Move along, move along
