I guess we didn't see
It wasn't meant to be
But we tried to love each other
There was no reason to
It's just what we went through
Now time has torn us apart

Though I told you I love you
And you told me the same
A little distance between us
How I've noticed a lot has changed
Now baby I

Chorus
I ain't missing your love
(Missing your love)
I I ain't missing your love
(Missing your love)

It's just another day
We go our separate ways
Without thinking about each other
Now everything seems new
When I see it without you
I've been told you feel the same as I do

Though I told you I loved you (ooh)
And you told me the same
A little distance between us
How I've noticed a lot has changed

Repeat chorus twice

Is it a crime that I've finally realised
You were missing all along (missing all along)
Still I don't have you
And I'm torn in two
Now it's time to say goodbye
Now baby I

Repeat chorus to fade
