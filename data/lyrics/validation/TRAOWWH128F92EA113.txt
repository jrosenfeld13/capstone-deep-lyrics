[Verse 1]
Just like old Saxophone Joe
When hes got the hogshead up on his toe
Oh me, oh my
Love that country pie

[Verse 2]
Listen to the fiddler play
When hes playin' 'til the break of day
Oh me, oh my
Love that country pie

[Verse 3]
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon and lime
What do I care?
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin and plum
Call me for dinner, honey, Ill be there

[Verse 4]
Saddle me up my big white goose
Tie me on her and turn her loose
Oh me, oh my
Love that country pie

[Verse 5]
I dont need much, that aint no lie
Aint runnin' any race
Give to me my country pie
I wont throw it up in anybodys face

[Verse 6]
Shake me up that old peach tree
A'Little Jack Horner got nothin on me
Oh me, oh my
Love that country pie
