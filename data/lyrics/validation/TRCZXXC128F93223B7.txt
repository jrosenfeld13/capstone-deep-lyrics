Make Heaven Wait

I see you smiling every day
Looking back at me
Like nothing ever changed
I swear I heard you call my name
But in reality
Its just your picture in the frame

Why am I here
Without you
When there was so much left for us to do
How could the angels come too soon

Chorus
If i could make heaven wait
I'd find a way to ask God if he had
Made some mistake
I he'd save your wings
For another day
If only i could make heaven wait

All your clothes are hanging up
Not a things been touched
I left it all the same
I wish that i could press rewind
And go back in time
Just to see your face again
Cos I miss you
I need you
I'm so alone without you here with me
You are the reason that I breathe

Chours

And everynight I search for your star
In the sky
Asking why oh why
Lord knows I would trade in my life for
A chance to say goodbye

Chorus
