Pace the floor, stop and stare
I drink a cup of coffee and start pulling out my hair
I'm drinking forty cups of coffee
Forty cups of coffee
Forty cups of coffee, waiting for you to come home

A quarter to twelve and you're still not in
The way you run around is a doggone sin
I'm drinking forty cups of coffee
Forty cups of coffee
Forty cups of coffee, waiting for you to come home

A quarter to three, I start watching the clock
The phone won't ring, so I'm waiting for your knock
I'm drinking forty cups of coffee
Forty cups of coffee
Forty cups of coffee, waiting for you to come home

Quarter to four, you ain't got home yet
I try to be cool and smoke a cigarette
I'm drinking forty cups of coffee
Forty cups of coffee
Forty cups of coffee, waiting for you to come home

You knock on the door about a quarter to five
I wanna hug you and kiss you, say thank heaven you're alive
I drank forty cups of coffee
Forty cups of coffee
Forty cups of coffee, but I'm glad you finally came home
