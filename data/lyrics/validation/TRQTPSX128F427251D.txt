Don't the lights look empty
When the streets are bare?
Almost as empty
As the look you give me
When I'm the only one

And it's a long one
So it brings you down
So you have nowhere else to go
And nothing to do
So you hang around, hang around

You wait around until
You've received that fatal wound

Columns of sunlight
And glorious cities
Oceans of opportunity
And all your decisions
Seem ancient

You wait around until
You've received that fatal wound
