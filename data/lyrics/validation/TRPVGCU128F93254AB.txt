Goodnight, my love
Pleasant dreams and sleep tight, my love
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me

Before you go
Please remember I need you so
And this love I have for you
Will never grow cold

If you should awake in the still of the night
Please have no fear
Just close your eyes then you'll realize
That my love will watch over you dear always

Goodnight, my love
Pleasant dreams and sleep tight, my love
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me

Goodnight, my love
Pleasant dreams and sleep tight, my love
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me

If you should awake in the still of the night
Please have no fear
Just close your eyes then you'll realize
That my love will watch over you dear always

Goodnight, my love
Pleasant dreams, sleep tight, my love
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me

Goodnight
