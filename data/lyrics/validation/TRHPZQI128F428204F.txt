[PHANTOM]
Wandering child
So lost, so helpless
Yearning for my guidance

[CHRISTINE]
Angel or father?
Friend or phantom?
Who is it there, staring?

[PHANTOM]
Have you forgotten your Angel?

[CHRISTINE]
Angel, oh speak
What endless longings
Echo in this whisper?

[PHANTOM]
Too long you've wandered in winter
Far from my fathering gaze

[CHRISTINE]
Wildly my mind beats against
you
Yet the soul obeys

Angel of Music!
I denied you
Turning from true beauty
Angel of Music!
My protector
Come to me, strange Angel

[PHANTOM]
You resist
Yet your soul obeys

Angel of Music!
You denied me
Turning from true beauty
Angel of Music!
Do not shun me
Come to your strange Angel

[PHANTOM (beckoning her)]
I am your Angel of Music
Come to me: Angel of Music

[RAOUL]
No, Christine, wait! Wait!

[CHRISTINE]
Raoul!

[RAOUL]
Whatever you believe, this manthis thingis not your father!
