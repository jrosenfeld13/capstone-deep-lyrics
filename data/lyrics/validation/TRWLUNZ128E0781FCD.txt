You've gotta say yes
How can you have doubts
The view's too good to jump
Now let me talk you down
Come On
Like butter wouldn't melt in your mouth
Man you've done us proud
No you you're not with us
You please yourself, self, self
Come On

With your foolish lies and your alibis
I can see my works almost done
I won't stand aside as you wash your life down the drain
Before it's begun
Cos you, you know better
Cos you're hooked and you're fucked without me

You've gotta say yes
Trample on your doubts
The view's too good to jump
Now let me talk you down
Come On

With your foolish lies and your alibis
I can see my works almost done
I won't stand aside as you wash your life down the drain
Before it's begun
With your foolish lies and your foolish pride
I can see my works almost done
I won't stand aside as you wash your life down the drain
Before it's begun
Cos you, you know better
Cos you're hooked and your f**ked without me

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
You've gotta say yes
