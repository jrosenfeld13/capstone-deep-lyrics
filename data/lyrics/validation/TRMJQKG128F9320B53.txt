Flagstaff, Arizona
Two weeks on the road with
Sean na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na
One day before we did play
We penned a song by us, for us

We didn't write the verse but we wrote the chorus:
I can't take it no more so
I'm going on a shopping spree
I can't save no money cause I spent it on a shopping spree

After the show
Theres nowhere to go
Everywheres packed with
White baseball hat-ed frat boys

So we end up at this empty place
Got a flaming doc
The Dali Llamas were the band
Scheduled to rock

Benny Na Na looks at me
I think I hear what hes saying
"Atom, do you hear what they're playing?!"
They're going shopping

I can't take it no more
So I'm going on a shopping spree
I can't save no money cause
I spent it on a shopping spree

So Dali Llamas...whatever
Spelled Salvador Dali, and the animal...how clever
You have a five string, fretless bass
You stole our song, now we rock your face!!

I can't take it no more
So I'm going on a shopping spree
I can't save no money cause
I spent it on a shopping spree
