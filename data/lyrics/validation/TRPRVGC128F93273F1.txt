I'm giving up the booze
I'm starting to day
A fortnight on the wagon
And I'm sure I'll be okay
I doubt it will be easy though
I'm sure it won't be fun
And counting down the hours
Until the withdrawal symptoms come

Oh my name is Jay and I'm an alcoholic
There I said it now
To anyone who will listen
And I said it really loud
My kidney's fuckin' killin' me
My memory is in bits
My wallet is always empty
And in the morning I feel like shit

But I'm bored of waking up
And not remembering where I've been
I'm bored of blurry memories
And forgetting people's names
I had a beer for breakfast
And talked about Hairy Dog
And I always start the evening
With a few Sambuca shots

Oh my name is Jay and I'm an alcoholic
There I said it now
To anyone who will listen
And I said it really loud
My kidney's fuckin' killin' me
My memory is in bits
My wallet is always empty
And in the morning I feel like shit

Well I'm giving up the booze
But it won't be forever
I'm just gonna prove that I can do it
And test my will power
I doubt that you'd believe me
If you knew me from Atom
'cause my love affair with alcohol
Has never been a problem
