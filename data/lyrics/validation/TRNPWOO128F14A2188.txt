[Chorus]
Pull you down, now

[Verse 1]
Knees knelt, I got my arms open wide
And the shades turned, so the colors die
No, don't hold too tight to the reel
'Cause it's a big one, boy
Its' gonna pull you down, now

[Chorus]
Pull you down, now

[Verse 2]
No, the cook can't look
No, can't look
No, no 'cause he's keeping his eye on the kettle
Indeed, he will be around
When you, or you, or you feel the need to feel

[Chorus]
Pull you down, now

[Bridge]
Well, I live more than what you'll ever know
But I'll give you more than what I'll ever show
I live more than what you'll ever know
And I'll give you more than what I'll ever show
More than I'll ever show
More than I'll ever show
More than I'll ever show
More than I'll ever show
More than I'll ever show
More than I'll ever show
