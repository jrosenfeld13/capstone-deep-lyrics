Baby
I get so scared inside
And I don't really understand
Is it love that's on my mind or is it fantasy?

Heaven
Is in the palm of my hand
And it's waiting here for you
What am I supposed to do with a childhood tragedy?

If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain the same?

Sometimes
It's hard to hold on
So hard to hold on to my dreams
It isn't always what it seems when you're face to face with me

Like a dagger
You stick me in the heart
And taste the blood from my blade
And when we sleep, would you shelter me in your warm and darkened grave?

If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain the same?

Will you ever take me?
"No, I just can't take the pain"
But would you ever trust me?
"No, I'll never feel the same"

I know I've been so hard on you
I know I've told you lies
If I could have just one more wish
I'd wipe the cobwebs from my eyes

If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever
Will it all remain the same? Oh no

"Close your eyes
Close your eyes
You gotta close your eyes for me"
