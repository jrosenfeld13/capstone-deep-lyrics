Man, whatcha' doin'?

Yeah, once life was simple
You just got up, and ate
You found someone you wanted
It was great

Now, things are complicated
You got bills to pay
You've gotta go to school
You've gotta work everyday

Well, that's hard

Sometimes i wanna check into a hospital, yeah
So they can help me breathe
Yeah, hook my heart up to one of them machines
We don't have to do anything
Just open our eyes
But man, but man, even that's hard sometimes!
(shriek!)

You know why?
I'll tell you why
Yeah this is why
I'm 'gonna tell you

Simple things are hard for me to do
Simple things are hard, without you
Simple things are hard for me to do (baby!)
Simple things are hard for me. (Yoww!!)

I'm struggling' every day!
To make sense of reality
I'm stugglin', I know
I just don't like
I just don't like being alone!

(yeooooww!)

Life's so simple now
You've got computers to do everything
They've got robots to serve you food
And machines that sing
We don't have to do anything
Just open our eyes
But man, but man! 
Even that's hard sometimes! (yeooww!)

I need somebody
To come over to my house
I need somebody
I need somebody to, help me out
'Cus I can't do it alone
Even this easy stuff
Yeah, I can't do it alone,.
Yeah, I've had enough

(Yeoow!)

(House BRIDGE)
Easy things are hard for me to do, yeah
Simple things are hard, without you
Without you!

A hundred times a day I wanna, call you up
'Cus I thought something nice, in a shot

A hundred times a day, I try to call your name
Then I realize that I'm alone, to complain. (unclear)

(Yeoow!)

I like simple things
("work it out" looping)

They're hard to do
("work it out" looping)

I like simple things
("work it out" looping")

They're hard to do
(" work it out" looping)

(Unclear speech)

I know it's over between me and you
But, it's so hard sometimes
Not to dial your number
To see your smile (unclear)

You know how many times
I see something that I know you would love;
I wanna tell you about it

I just wanna share
The experience of my life
With you

Oh yeah
Simple things are hard for me to do!

(Yeoow!)

I like simple things
WORK IT OUT
