I once had a dream sailing through the sky
Floating high above the earth below
I open my eyes to see the truth
Nothing I can do to save them

As is above As is below
Return as once before
All things renewed

I once had a dream or was it real
Nothing I can do to save them

You have been warned now the final day has come
This world shall shake from His voice

As is above
As once before all things renewed
As is below
The mountains crumble at his word

Mountains shall crumble, and fall into the sea
Millions cry "Death take over me"

All men shall fear
As once before all things renewed
All men shall kneel
The mountains crumble at his word

Tears from my eyes rain down below
Burning as flame in every soul
I open my heart unto the world
Nothing I can do to save them

Men shall seek death from torments on this earth
As angels rain fire from the sky
