Do you remember me
I sat upon your knee
I wrote to you
With
Childhood fantasies
Well
I'm all
Grown up now
And still need
Help somehow
I'm not a child
But my heart
Still can dream

So here's
My lifelong wish
My grown up
Christmas list
Not for myself
But for a world
In need

No more lives
Torn apart
That wars
Would never start
And time
Would heal
All hearts
And everyone
Would have a friend
And right
Would always win
And love
Would never end
Ooh
This is my grown up
Christmas list

As children
We believe
The grandest sight
To see
Was something lovely
Wrapped beneath
The tree
But heaven
Only knows
That packages
And bows
Can never heal
A heartached
Human soul

No more lives
Torn apart
That wars
Would never start
And time
Would heal
All hearts
And everyone
Would have
A friend
And right
Would always win
And love
Would never end
No
This is my grown up
Christmas list

What is this illusion
Called
The innocence of you
Maybe only
In our blind belief
Can we ever
Find the truth

No more lives
Torn apart
That wars
Would never start
And time
Would heal
All hearts
Everyone
Would have
A friend
And right
Would always win
And love
Would never end

This is my grown up
Christmas list
This is my only
Lifelong wish
This is my grown up
Christmas list
