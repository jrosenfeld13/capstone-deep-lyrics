Hey, Louis Prima
We gotta get the hell outta town
'Cause I've been datin' a chick with some swively hips
And her boyfriend don't want me around

And wouldn't it be kinda funny
If we got outta town with all the money
Hey, Louis Prima
You sure know how to lay it on down

We were doin' all-nighters
Cruisin' to a gig in Vegas
Don't know what was goin' on
But it surely did become contagious!

When we pulled up to the show
Ten thousand people or more all yelled out
"Man your band is truly outrageous!"

Hey, Louis Prima
Man, you make 'em jump and shout
I got a five-dollar bet on a two-dollar bill
You're gonna show 'em what it's all about
And wouldn't it be kinda funny
If we got outta town with all the money
Hey, Louis Prima
You sure know how to lay it on down

Hey, Louis Prima
There's something that I just gotta know
Have you still got that old black magic
Or are you just a gigolo?

All we need is some Sam Butera
Then we can say "Buona Sera"
Hey, Louis Prima
You sure know how to lay it on down
