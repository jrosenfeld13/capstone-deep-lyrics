Walk backwards
Say goodbye
To what's right
Understanding
What makes this (what makes this)
What makes us (what makes us)
What makes us right (what makes us)

God save this gun slinging generation
"Tell God that I'll return in the morning."

This Christ you preach, I know, but who are you?
Your hands are tied to blind men
Whose hands are tied to blind men

Figure eights

This pistol is my ministry
