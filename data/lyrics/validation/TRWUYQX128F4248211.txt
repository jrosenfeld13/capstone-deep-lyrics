In my life for all you can't remember why
Don't you ever leave those dancing days too far behind
It's all you ever had to lose it's all you ever lose it's all you ever do
Well it's all we say and *we're through*
And in my life *I have swam an encircled life*
In my life and all you say takes too much time
You are everything it's always the same now there's walking away
You are everything know you can stay now that you walk away
You don't like anything I don't like it more you want everything and more
You are everything and more you are everything in my life
In my life.........
You don't want this anymore you don't want this anymore
You don't want this anymore you don't want this anymore anymore
You were someone to talk to my someone to live with for a while
Someone I've never known and I could get some *time* from your smile
Don't like anything don't like it more you want everything and more
You are everything and more you are everything in my life
In my life.........
And all you say as your walking away
In my life.........
In all of my life in all of my fucking life
In my life.........
In all of my fucking life
