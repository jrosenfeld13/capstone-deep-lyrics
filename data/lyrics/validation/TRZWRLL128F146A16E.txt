So I see it
It's right there in front of me
What's the matter?
Oh you cannot see
Feeling like i did when
When you blindfolded me
So I hear it for a brief moment
ThereI thought I knew
All those things they were far, far from true
But I guess you cannot hide
From the truth

CHORUS
So I see right through you
And I know
What you've been up to
So I see right through you
And I know the things you do

So I see it
It's right there in front of me
Oh I'm sorry
You did not wanna see
Acting like I did when you betrayed me
So I hear it they didn't have to
Scream it in my head
They just could have whispered it instead
Cause I am already over it now

CHORUS

So I hear it
They didn't have to scream it in my head
They just Could have whispered it instead
Cause I am already over it now

CHORUS (repeat to fade)
