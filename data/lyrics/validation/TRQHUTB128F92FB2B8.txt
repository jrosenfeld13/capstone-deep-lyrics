Crime - a first degree crime
A ruthless man, to jail to be damned
Life sentence of time
Sin - accused of a sin
Broken commandments erotic forces within

Time lingers it melts away
Eyes closed can't face destiny
Vital sentence and life torn away
Between the bars, awaiting my day

Bars - these endless bars
The twelve foot fence, the silver spiral of death
Light - no sign of light
A concrete wall, a chair of death down the hall

Time lingers it melts away
Eyes closed can't face destiny
Vital sentence and life torn away
Between the bars, awaiting my day
Life inside is so unwhole
Among thousands I stand alone
Soon freedom will come my way
At any cost I will escape

Life inside is so unwhole
Among thousands I stand alone
Soon freedom will come my way
Between the bars, awaiting my day

Diminishing days
Nocturnal darkness to shade my escape
Razor ribbon awaits

Pain - my tormenting pain
Revenge will be mine, but all in good time
Your lives I will claim
Free at last now free
But there on the way, aware my escape

Time lingers it melts away
Eyes closed can't face destiny
Vital sentence and life torn away
Between the bars, awaiting my day
Life inside is so unwhole
Among thousands I stand alone
Soon freedom will come my way
At any cost I will escape

Life inside is so unwhole
Among thousands I stand alone
Soon freedom will come my way
Between the bars, awaiting my day
