Anybody can dance
And anybody can sing
If you looking for love
If you looking for peace yeah

Let your spirit go
Let your spirit go
Let your spirit go
Higher

I been walkin' in circles
I been prayin' to god
Maybe talking to nothing
Oh my soul

Anybody can lie
And anybody can dream
If you're looking for you
If you're looking for me yeah

Let your spirit go
Let your spirit go
Let your spirit go
Higher

I been walkin' in circles
I been prayin' to god
Maybe talking to nothing
Oh my soul
Everybody needs answers
Everybody needs love
Everybody loves someone
Oh my soul

I been walkin' in circles
I been prayin' to god
Maybe talking to nothing
Oh my soul
Everybody needs answers
Everybody needs love
Everybody loves someone
Oh my soul
