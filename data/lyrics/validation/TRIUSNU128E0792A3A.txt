If what you see is what you get
Then we have nothing to regret
From all the things I've seen
The things I've seen
And when there's nothing to regret
Our stupid lives we'll be better yet
At least we'll all come clean
We'll all come clean

It's not this stupid world

'Cause I want just one day
For things to go my way
