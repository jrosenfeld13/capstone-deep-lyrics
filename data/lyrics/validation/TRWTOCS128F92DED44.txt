Paroles de la chanson Sweet, Sweet :
I took the easy way out of it
This time Ill admit
I felt I had the right to do so
This time
The night and the city took me so far away
The traffic, the speed far below me
Just like black, calming water
To swim in,escape in
Just like dozing off to the sweet scents of girls perfumes
Let me stay here for a while
And Ill be sweet, sweet, Ill be sweet
Sweet, Ill be all that you want me to be
Sweet, sweet, Ill be sweet
Sweet, Ill be all that you want in a woman
Outside my window
The rains pouring down
These great afternoons in the fall
I could sit like this for hours
With your music on
This is how secrets are revealed
Just like black, calming water
To swim in,escape in
Just like dozing off to the sweet scents of girls perfumes
Let me stay here for a while
And Ill be sweet, sweet, Ill be sweet
Sweet, Ill be all that you want me to be
Sweet, sweet, Ill be sweet
Sweet, Ill be all that you want in a woman
