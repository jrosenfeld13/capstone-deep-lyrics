Lookin' for action
Yeah, wherever it can be found
I ain't no Johnny-come-lately
I'm Johnny-on-the-spot

Shake and tumble down with me baby
Shake and tumble down
I need a woman that can make me
Shake and tumble down (aw yeah)
Body slammin'
Gotcha on the floor
D-down and dirty
Is what I'm lookin' for
Got that rhythm and it makes me lose control
When we...
