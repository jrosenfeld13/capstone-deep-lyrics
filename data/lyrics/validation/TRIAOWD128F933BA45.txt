It feels like, it feels like
When you're in a dream state
Like when you wanna run but you can't
When you wanna scream but you can't

When you wanna love
But there's nobody in front of you yet
And then you're alone and in a moment of clarity
You know what it is you're missin'

I, I, I, I spin around and let my arms dangle
My feet tangle, I bump my head and hit the ground
I dial your number but my finger's shakin'
My cake's bakin', I'm sick of ricochetin' around

What if I blurt out 'I love you'?
Baby, I got to be cool
I wanna jump in a pool of you
And go splash, splash, splashin' around

I want the world to know
It doesn't matter if you don't
I want the world to know
No, it don't matter if you don't

I, I, I, I try and tell ya but my tongue swells up
My tears well up, I think I'm allergic to ya, babe
Somebody help me, I'm having trouble breathin'
This food I'm eatin' is about to come up the other way

What if I blurt out I love you?
Baby, I got to be cool
I wanna tell you how much you mean to me
Baby, I got to tell you, baby, I got to tell you

I want the world to know
It doesn't matter if you don't
I want the world to know
No, it don't matter if you don't

This feelin', this feelin's
Like a dagger in my stomach
Gotta keep a secret
Can I tell it baby?

Let's get under the covers
Let's get under the covers
Ooh, no, no, no, there ain't no other
No, there ain't no other

I want the world to know
It doesn't matter if you don't
I want the world to know
No, it don't matter if you don't
