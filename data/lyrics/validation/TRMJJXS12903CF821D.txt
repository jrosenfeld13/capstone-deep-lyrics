Don't change the way we are
Still opening up all the scars
Let's not re-hash what once was

We're falling further down the spiral into denial
It makes no sense, nevertheless
You won't get the best of me

Time and time again you've realized
That hope is far from over
It was never over
Pain that you have gone through
Makes you a stronger person
A better person
Pain that you hold close when others know
And all the hate you hold inside;
Just open up

Pain you hold close and the hate you bottle up inside

We're falling further down the spiral into denial
It makes no sense, nevertheless
You won't get the best of me
