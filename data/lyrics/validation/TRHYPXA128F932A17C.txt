I would like to lay you down
I would like to put my hands upon your shoulders
Tell you "Baby I love you
We're all right"
I don't know what you're thinking
And I can't tell what you're missing
And I can't see who you are
I would like to touch your heart
Look you in the eyes, the only place we always start
I would like to be with you
Rain or shine, doesn't matter what's the time
I don't want to be a burden
So let's just kiss til the morning comes down
I would like to see you smile
Fall apart into each other for a while
Another day is just a day without you there
I love you dear
It is so hard
Let's not forget to shed a tear
And we'll go home to forever
And I'll love you, love
