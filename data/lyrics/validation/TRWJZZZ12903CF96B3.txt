I'll soon use my hands
To carve paths through this caged world
Locked up by them
I must hold my courage
Whether their kind will ever give
Whether in life they'll ever live
Flaming eyes burn far above
A candle's glow
Naked to myself
Chained to change
One day see the light
As I grasp for this
My world
My joy
Purged of its life
They will seek their reward
Leading them on...
They'll bleed they own hearts
Steal my world
Asserting that I must sanction worse
Flaming eyes burn far above
A candle's glow
Naked to myself
Chained to change
