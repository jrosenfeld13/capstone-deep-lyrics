[Verse 1]
A worried man with a worried mind
No one in front of me and nothing behind
Theres a woman on my lap and shes drinking champagne
Got white skin, got assassins eyes
Im looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies
Im well dressed, waiting on the last train

Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose
Any minute now Im expecting all hell to break loose

[Chorus]
People are crazy and times are strange
Im locked in tight, Im out of range
I used to care, but things have changed

[Verse 2]
This place aint doing me any good
Im in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag
Aint no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag
Only a fool in here would think hes got anything to prove

Lot of water under the bridge, lot of other stuff too
Dont get up gentlemen, Im only passing through

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Ive been walking forty miles of bad road
If the Bible is right, the world will explode
Ive been trying to get as far away from myself as I can
Some things are too hot to touch
The human mind can only stand so much
You cant win with a losing hand

Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet
Putting her in a wheelbarrow and wheeling her down the street

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I hurt easy, I just dont show it
You can hurt someone and not even know it
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity
Gonna get low down, gonna fly high
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie
Im in love with a woman who dont even appeal to me

Mr. Jinx and Miss Lucy, they jumped in the lake
Im not that eager to make a mistake

[Chorus]
