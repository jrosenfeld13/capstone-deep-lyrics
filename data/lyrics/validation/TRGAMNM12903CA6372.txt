[Verse 1: Shayley Bourget & Austin Carlile]
Friend of mine, I've tried a revolution
Everyone's screaming, it's not fair
It's not fair, it's not fair
Love's not fair

[Bridge: Shayley Bourget]
I'll play the Romeo, you play the Juliet
The sun won't set, until you appear
'Cause I know you're the one, my love, my love

[Verse 2: Austin Carlile]
What light through this window breaks?
So bright, so bright
My love, just for one more day
So bright, you're so bright
Fall (fall) fast (fast)
The course of love never did run smooth
I'll try, I'll try to dream on my own tonight
We will meet in the moonlight
Meet in the moonlight
We will meet in the moonlight
Meet in the moonlight

[Chorus: Shayley Bourget & Austin Carlile]
This is not pretend, don't play the end
I know you're real and not just a book I read
Soon I will show you how a heart can never fail
Never change
I'll never change
I'll show you the sun can never, never change
I'll never, never change

[Outro: Austin Carlile]
If music be the food of love, play on, play on
If music be the food of love, play on, play on
