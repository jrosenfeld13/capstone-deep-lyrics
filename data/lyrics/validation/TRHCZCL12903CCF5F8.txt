[Robert Johnson]

I've got a kind hearted woman
She studies evil all the time
I've got a kind hearted woman
She studies evil all the time
You would do to quit me
Just to have it on your mind
I've got a kind hearted woman
Do anything in this world for me
I've got a kind hearted woman
Do anything in this world for me
But these evil hearted women
Lord, and they will not let me be

Now it ain't but one thing
Makes Mr. Johnson drink
I swear about how you treat me baby
I begin to think
Oh baby, my life don't feel the same
It breaks my heart when you call
Mr. So-and-So's name

She's a kind hearted woman
She studies evil all the time
She's a kind hearted woman
She studies evil all the time
You're best to quit me baby
As just to have it on your mind
