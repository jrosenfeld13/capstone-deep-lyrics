Touch me in the morning
And last thing at night
Keep my body warm, baby
You know it feels right

Take a little higher
I'm thinking it too
Tell me what you're feeling
I'll feel it with you

We can only understand what we are shown
How was I supposed to know our love would grow

Move a little closer
Be sure I'm looking up
Heal me with your loving
I need you, I need you, I need you so much

Touch me in the morning
And last thing at night
Keep my body warm, baby
You know it feels right

Take a little higher
I'm thinking it too
Tell me what you're feeling
I'll feel it with you

We can only understand what we are shown
How was I supposed to know our love would grow

Move a little closer
Be sure I'm looking up
Heal me with your loving
I need you, I need you, I need you so much

You touch my mind in special places
My heart races with you
I'll take your love and I'll take new chances
I'll take them with you
