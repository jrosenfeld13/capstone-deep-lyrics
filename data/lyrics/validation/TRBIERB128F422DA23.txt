Last night I was looking for some romance
So I went to a square dance
Feeling like a circle

But did you see my mom last night?
She was so dang pretty

I ended up in a corn field
Skeeters on my toenails
'Till the cows came back
From their bleeding

Did you see my dad last night?
He was so dang witty

And love scares me like chandeliers
Pretty shards of glass tickling my ears
Hanging from a single wire, waiting plaster to crack
Hanging from a single wire, waiting plaster to crack
Hanging from a single, hanging from a single single

I'm always dumbin' up the smart things
And smartin' up the dumb things
And knottin' up my shoe strings
And messing up the good things

But did you see the stars last night?
Punctuation for a perfect moment

Tearing down your walls
But I'm building up my walls
So no one knows, no, nothing
No one knows, no, nothing

Did you see God last night?
An eighty-year-old on a red tricycle

I built this(?)
I love you
God damn it
I mean, gosh darn

I built this(?)
I love you
God damn
Gosh darn

And you can't take this away
And you can't take this away
And you can't take this away

Love scares me like chandeliers
Pretty shards of glass tickling my ears
Hanging from a single wire, waiting plaster to crack
Hanging from a single wire, waiting plaster to crack
Hanging from a single, hanging from a single single
