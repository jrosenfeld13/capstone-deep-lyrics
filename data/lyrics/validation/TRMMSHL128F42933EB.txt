Holdin' on, safely to fall
Like there's no tomorrow forsaking it all
Bound and determined to share all of our days
Loving and learning our special ways
That I'm holdin' onto and you've been lettin' go
And wherever you've gone to I'm so far below
You're way over me I can't even see how
Someday I'll need you the way you don't need me now

Movin' on, heart in a stall
Like there's no tomorrow, no beating at all
Bound and determined to forget all of our days
Reliving and learning our special ways
I'm still holdin' onto, maybe no lettin' go
And wherever you've gone to I may never know
The way you're over me I can't even see how
Someday I'll need you the way you don't need me now

And you don't need me now
Like you needed me then
And I'm wondering how I'll be feeling when
I'm way over you I can't even see how
Someday I'll need you the way you don't need me now
No way I'll need you the way you don't need me now...
