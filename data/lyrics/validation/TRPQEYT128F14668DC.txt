Out of this world
Out of this mind
Out of this love for you
Out of this world
Out of the blue
Out of this love for you

Sometimes I don't know you
You're like someone else
But that's allright
I'm a stranger here myself

She don't shed a tear
When I walk out that door
She knows, she knows
I'll be coming back for more

Out of this world
Out of this mind
Out of this love for you
Out of this world
Out of the blue
Out of this love for you

It's in the cards
It's written in the stars
It's in the wee-wee hours
In some lonely bar

She don't stay up all night
And walk the floor
She knows damn well
I'll be coming back for more

Out of this world
Out of this mind
Out of this love for you
Out of this world
Out of the blue
Out of this love for you
