Silence tells me no lie
Stick around and the truth you'll find
There's a fire in your heart
Burns so bright
It's sometimes unkind

Keep the fire from burning me
By closing my eyes I was born to pollute
The smoking, the cocaine, the new stain and the old flame

[Chorus]
To read between the lines
That crowd around your eyes
I need some, want some blood in your eyes

Coca-cola your heart
Look around
Should get out of town
Cause I could eat every word
You could kill till I'm fat as hell

You should have changed the world by now
But I'm too busy milking the holy cow
But the campaign and the camp pain, the news chain and the dancing

[Chorus]
To read between the lines
That crowd around your eyes
The flabby burger's mine
The free toy, the day and the night
I want some, need some blood in your eyes

[Bridge]
I said I thought it was
Sadness such a full meal
Joy such a salad
Was Cupid the stupid cunt

The cocaine, the smoking, the new stain and the old flame
The layer of fat and the whole game for you
The campaign and the camp pain, the dancing and the v-sign
The smell of fat chicks wrapped in denim and kicks for you

[Chorus]
To read between the lines
That crowd around your eyes
The flabby burger's mine
The free toy, the day and the night
I want some, need some blood in your eyes
