If the sun should tumble from the skies if the sea should suddenly run dry
If you love me really love me let it happen I won't care
If it seems that everything is lost I will smile and never count the cost
If you love me really love me let it happen darling I won't care
Shall I catch a shooting star shall I bring it where you are if you want me to I will
You can let me any test I'll do anything you ask if you only say you love me still
When at last the life on earth is through I will share each other tear will you
If you love me really love me let it happen I won't care
If you love me really love me let it happen I won't care
