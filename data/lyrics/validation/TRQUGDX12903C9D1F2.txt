His portrait hanging, face betraying
Wicked gleamin eyes of Satan

Cast us in their spell
Cast us in their spell
Raised out of Hell

All the world waits with jaded
Sorrow that never sleeps
Waiting for him to unlock
His door to the sallow...

People...

His evil lives
And my flesh crawls
He's hanging from
My chamber wall
Hypnotized
My soul is waiting
Waiting for his luring call!
Come!
Come!

Portrait hanging, face betraying
Wicked gleaming eyes of Satan

Cast us in their spell
Cast us in their spell
Cast us in their spell!
