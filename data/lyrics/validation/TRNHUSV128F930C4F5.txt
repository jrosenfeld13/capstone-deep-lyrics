Every morning I wake up, I'm dealing with a different person
There's not a day feels the same as the last round here
And living out of my pocket, I never thought you'd grasp the concept
You got it in to your head there was no other way

Push all your windows open wide
You'll never know the world from inside
It could all be over and you'd never have known

HELL! I just want to be happy, but never thought I'd leave that life behind
And at the end of the day, you were only ever a friend
And so when you're on your way out, when all of this is coming to an end
When the curtains have closed: won't you think of me then?

Push all your windows open wide
You'll never know the world from inside
It could all be over and you'd never have known

Life in the backseat hurts, when you're strapped in and you just want to learn
All you can do is sit back and get through
All you can do is sit back and get through
