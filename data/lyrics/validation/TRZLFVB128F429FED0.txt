Dont give me names
Youve got it all, took it all from me
Drove me insane
Whod come down to earth, releasing me
Healing my wounds
So why dont you close the door when youre leaving me
Now you'll run
Running all the way back to me again

Im not to end in shame
To fight an endless lie
Im not to play a game
I won't be on your side

(i) found a way
To reach myself again but all i saw was shame
Drive me away
Theres something deep in me waiting to escape
You think you know me
So why dont you close the door when youre here with me

Im here to end the game
Im living in a lie
Its hard to give the same
I won't be on your side

Im not to end in shame
To fight an endless lie
Im not to play a game
I won't be on your side

I loved you a lot
To need you a lot
I leave you alone
