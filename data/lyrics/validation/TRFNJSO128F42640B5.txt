Every day, every time I see you
I think about all those times
Every night that I have been by myself
Right beside your empty side

I still see you
Laying here beside me
I'm such a fool
It's time to try to forget
It's time to try

All of those vows
All of those promises that you
Wanted me to make to you

All of those lies
Every time you told me
We'll be together for all time

I still see you
Laying here beside me
I'm such a fool

It's time to try to forget
It's time to try

I can't believe
I'd finally get, get, get, get up off my knees

Everyday, every time I see you
Thanking God that I'm alright
No more strife
Watched it walk right out of my life
With a little of my heart

I found someone new
To lay here besides you
I'm not your fool
It's time to try to forget
It's time to try
Try...
