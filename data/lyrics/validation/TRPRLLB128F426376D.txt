Nothing can eclipse
Tender fingertips
Youthful girlish hips
Crimson pouting lips...

But d'you say when nothing's meant?
What d'you do when all is spent?

Faithless, faceless night
Drenched in empty light...
Scarlet starlet's bright;
Vanity's delight...

But d'you say when nothing's meant?
What d'you do when all is spent?
Cream of life you'll find in her;
First to come, she's first to serve...

Turned away - you're out of luck;
Turned away* - no one to fall in love...

Faithless, faceless night
Drenched in empty light...
Scarlet starlet's bright;
Vanity's delight...

But d'you say when nothing's meant?
What d'you do when all is spent?
Cream of life you'll find in her;
First to come, she's first to serve...
