Hurt yourself before it's time to wake up
Don't let the bitches tell you what you've got
Behind your back the tongues can't stop to speak
They keep repeating that your mind's just sick

Seven virgins come and walk here by your side
You've got this feeling that corrodes you from inside
And you beat up compulsively again your head
Trying to stop the noise in your brain

Piss off now! Go!
Go to Hell! Go!
Walk away! Go!
And go to Hell!

Never trust a stranger you were told
So you look out of the window with your gun
The porno film keeps playing in your room's background
Back and forth as you want it to stop

And the mirror breaks in pieces your pervert past
Your frustrations march now as you turn to dust
And you beat up compulsively again your head
Trying to stop the noise in your brain

Piss off now! Go!
Go to Hell! Go!
Walk away! Go!
And go to Hell!

Mad voices ride the air up and down
The voices tell you all you ignore
Knife's and blades arise and dance only for you
Are you sure you want to know the truth?

Piss off now! Go!
Go to Hell! Go!
Walk away! Go!
And go to Hell!
