[Verse 1]
You said you'd like to see me again
And then it all unravelled
I heard that you were seeing someone
Not such an insignificant other
It seems my moves were far too swift
In life some things are worth the effort

[Pre-Chorus]
I touched the place where your hair had been
I buttoned the shirt that you left 'round mine

[Chorus]
Defacing pictures of famous people on the train
Standing by the monument just waiting for the rain

[Verse 2]
In my wallet with your photobooth smile
And I wearing my waterproof jacket
Posterity has hold of us now
Am I just waiting for the last chapter?
We sleep tonight in separate towns
At dusk, we see our disparate futures

[Pre-Chorus]
I tore a sock to bind up your golden hair
We found a hotel bar to sustain our last night in vain

[Chorus]
Defacing pictures of famous people on the train
Standing by the monument just waiting for the rain
I'm just passing my time with you on my mind
I'm just passing my time

[Bridge]
No more late night calls
Where teardrops fall
No more late night calls
Where teardrops fall
Teardrops fall

[Chorus]
Standing by the monument just waiting for the rain
I'm just passing my time with you on my mind
I'm just wasting my precious time

[Outro]
I'm just wasting my time with you on my mind
