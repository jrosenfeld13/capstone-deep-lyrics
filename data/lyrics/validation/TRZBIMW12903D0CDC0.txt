I miss your kiss
What do you think of this?
Oh, its much too much to miss
And it goes like this

[Chorus]
Well this is this
And that is that
Get off my lap
You silly cat
I know my sister is a brat
But this is this
And that is that
And you will write my epitaph
And then you'll take a bubble bath

The water is so still
Take your fill
Oh, you hurt to kill
Oh, you hurt to kill

[Chorus]
But this is this
And that is that
Get off my lap
You silly cat
I know my sister is a brat
But this is this
And that is that
And you will write my epitaph
And then you'll take a bubble bath
