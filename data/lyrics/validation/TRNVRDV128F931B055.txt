Operator, operator
I'm so glad that you rang my phone
Operator, operator
I'm so glad that you found my home
I can hear my long gone lover
I've waited such a long, long time

So please, operator
Put him on the line
I want him on the line
I want him on the line
I wanna talk to that long gone lover of mine

Operator, operator
There is static in my line
Did he say that his love was true?
Did he say that his love was mine?
Did he say he was coming home?
Did he say where he has been?

I can't hear a word he's saying
If you keep butting in
You keep butting in
You keep butting in
I wanna know if he's coming home again
It shouldn't take this much time
To clear my mind
Ease my mind

Oh, operator
Please get straight
It's unfair to make me wait any longer
My curiosity is stronger
Don't you know?
That it's wrong, oh-so wrong

Operator, operator
This is very strange
What is the hold up here?
Doesn't he have the change

Oh, please operator
If he don't have another dime
Reverse the charge to me
Put him on the line

I want him on the line
I want him on the line
I wanna talk to that long gone lover of mine
I wanna talk to that long gone lover of mine
