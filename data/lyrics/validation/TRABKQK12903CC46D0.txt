Oh I ain't joking when I'm telling ya
That while in the Yakima
Digging up them thunderegg stones
Well, we cracked them wide open
The mountain started smoking
And the sky turned the color of a crow

Fires in the northlands
Floods to the south
Put the pedal to the metal
And let it all hang out

Fires in the northlands
Floods to the south
Put the pedal to the metal
And let it all hang out

The ash turned to confetti
HALLELUJAH!
Outside them great tri-cities
HALLELUJAH!
Oh, God showed his great mercy
HALLELUJAH!
Turned ash into confetti
HALLELUJAH!

Handkerchiefs on coughing mouths
Running to the full hotels
Left us with no other place but home
And in the distance
Tail lights came and went
Sometimes as eyes of Vulcan sorcery

Fires in the northlands
Floods to the south
Put the pedal to the metal
And let it all hang out

Fires in the northlands
Floods to the south
Put the pedal to the metal
And let it all hang out

The ash turned to confetti
HALLELUJAH!
Outside them great tri-cities
HALLELUJAH!
Oh, God showed his great mercy
HALLELUJAH!
Turned ash into confetti
HALLELUJAH!

Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe we'll make it to that rise
Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe we'll see another sun rise OH YEAH

The ash turned to confetti
HALLELUJAH!
Outside them great tri-cities
HALLELUJAH!
Oh, God showed his great mercy
HALLELUJAH!
Turned ash into confetti
HALLELUJAH!
Turned ash into confetti
HALLELUJAH!
Outside them great tri-cities
HALLELUJAH!
Oh, God showed his great mercy
HALLELUJAH!
Turned ash into confetti
HALLELUJAH!
HALLELUJAH!
HALLELUJAH!
