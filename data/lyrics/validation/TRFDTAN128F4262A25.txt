Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa la la la la la, la la la la
'Tis the season to by jolly
Fa la la la la la, la la la la

Don we now our gay apparel
Fa la la, la la la, la la la
Troll the ancient Yuletide carol
Fa la la la la la, la la la la

We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas
And a Happy New Year
Good tidings we bring to you and your kin
Good tidings for Christmas
And a Happy New Year

Oh, bring us a figgy pudding
Oh, bring us a figgy pudding
Oh, bring us a figgy pudding
Oh bring some right here

We won't go until we get some
We won't go until we get some
We won't go until we get some
So bring some right here

We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas
And a Happy New Year
