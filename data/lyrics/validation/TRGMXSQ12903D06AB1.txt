This was the centre of the world for me once
Where I saw "I love you" all over the place
And that was where the Stones played once
And these are the bricks that shattered my heart

This is the place where I felt
Like the world's tallest self-supporting tower
At least for a little while anyway

Hiding out in the subway system
Hanging out in the library system
You made me feel like a harbour
And you made me feel like a fortress

This is the place where I felt
Like the world's tallest self-supporting tower
Or maybe number two
At least for a little while anyway

Concrete heart
Concrete heart
Concrete heart
Concrete heart
