If y'all ever plan to motor west
Take my way, the highway, that's the best
Get your kicks on Route 66

It winds from Chicago to LA
More than two-thousand miles all the way
Get your kicks on Route 66

You go through St. Louis, Joplin, Missouri
Oklahoma City looks oh-so pretty
You'll see Amarillo, Gallup, New Mexico
Flagtop, Arizona, don't forget Winona
Kingman, Barstow, San Bernardino
Won't you get hip to this kindly tip?
When you make that California trip
Get your kicks on Route 66
