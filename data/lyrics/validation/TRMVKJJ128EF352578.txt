It's not unusual to be loved by anyone
It's not unusual to have fun with anyone
But when i see you hangin about with anyone
It's not unusual to see me cry

I wanna die
It's not unusual to go out at any time
But when i see you out and about is such a crime
If you should ever wanna be loved by anyone
It's not unusual, happens every day

No matter what you say
You find it happens all the time
Love can never do what you wanna do
Why can't this crazy love be mine

Happens every day
No matter what you say
You'll find it happens all the time
Love can never do what you wanna do
Why can't this crazy be mine?

It's not unusual to be mad with anyone
It's not unusual to be sad with anyone
But if i ever find that you change at anytime
It's not unusual to cry
I'm in love with you
