[Verse 1: Isis]
Hey! Your glass stayed on her forehead
She get it from my old head
Shades down low; little mammy better go ahead
We're posted on the corner
She's the black prima donna
Run her fingers through her ditch
Try to say you don't wanna
Speed gay like a pro-OH
OK you don't know-OH
We certainly in the game
Gotta hustle like her-OH
For surely she would try it
Turn the bass up higher
Get you liver than a wire
Set the place on fire
Hey hey! Hey hey hey!
Hey hey hey hey! You can't stop it
Your bed still rocks
Get your fingers out my pocket
Say, Hey hey hey!
And yeah, I spit with a slur
When I move with the herd
It's absurd how I work it
Say, Hey hey hey!
I know you can't stop it
Your bed still rocks
Get your fingers out my pocket
Say, Hey hey hey!
And yeah, I spit with a slur
And I move with the herd
It's absurd how I work

[Hook: Isis]
She's a Little Booty Girl
Saucy with a twist
If you bossy do like this
If you bossy do like this

[Verse 2: Isis]
Hey hey! One thing 'bout music, when it hits you feel no pain
Especially in the bank where you know you're getting paid
I'm the black Kate Moss
And you heard it from the source
I don't got a license but this dude got a Porsche
So, oh, so, we ride it
Front seat driving
It's hot in the summer but I ain't cooling down
And I like, I like, yeah
I gotta test the waters
Put some work in your hands
African Goddess
Set tight in the waist
Trees by the case
It's the hustle in my muscle
And my finger in your face
And we're posted in the club
A bottle full of bub
Take a fifth to the head
And now we all fall in love
Let your hands fall down
Bossy do like this
If you saucy do like this
If you bossy do like this
Let your hands fall down
Saucy with a twist
If you bossy do like this
If you bossy do like this

[Hook: Isis]
She's a Little Booty Girl
Saucy with a twist
If you bossy do like this
If you bossy do like this
