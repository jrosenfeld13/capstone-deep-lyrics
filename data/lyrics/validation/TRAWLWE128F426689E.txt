Can I cry a little bit
There's nobody to notice it
Can I cry if I want to
No one cares

Why can't I pretend
That you love me again?
All I had has been taken from me
Now I'm cryin'
And tears don't become me

Just one smile
Pain's forgiven
Just one kiss, girl
Now the hurt's all gone
Just one smile to make my
Make my little life worth livin'
A little dream to build my world upon

How I wish
I could say
All the things that I forgot to say
How I wish you
Could see what's here
In My heart
I don't ask for much
A look, a smile, a touch
Try to forget
Well, the Lord knows I'm tryin'
But it's so hard to forget girl
When your whole world is dyin'

Just one smile
Pain's forgiven
Just one kiss, girl
Now the hurt's all gone
Just one smile to make my
Make my little life worth livin'
A little dream to build my world upon

Try to forget
Well, the Lord knows I'm tryin'
But it's so hard to forget girl
When your whole world is dyin'

Just one smile
Pain's forgiven
Just one kiss, girl
Now the hurt's all gone
Just one smile to make my
Make my little life worth livin'
A little dream to build my world upon
