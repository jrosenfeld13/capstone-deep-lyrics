I thought that he was insecure
But I don't think so anymore
Think about what youre living for
Now that you've opened up that door

Be careful what youre wishing
Be careful what youre wishing
Be careful what youre wishing for

You might scream
You might shout
Trying to suss it out
Sinking low

You might scream
You might shout
Trying to suss it out
Sinking low

For, the dictator, be careful what youre living for
Alcohol and cocaine, I think it's driving you insane

Be careful what youre wishing for (x3)
Now that youve opened up that door (x3)

You might scream
You might shout
Trying to suss it out
Sinking low

You might scream
You might shout

You might scream
You might shout
Trying to suss it out
Sinking low
