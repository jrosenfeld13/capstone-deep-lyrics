You're so beautiful, you just lay it on me
Foxy lady, you really are the greatest show in town
You want to play
You wanna eat your cake and have it your way
You got it easy and you don't give a damn
Fooling around, you just keep fooling around with me

Walking down the street, people watching closely
Such a tease, you can turn on any man you want
You masquerade
You're the catch of the season every night and day
You, you, you don't have any time for me
You just keep fooling around with me

Fooling around - everywhere I go you're the only
Only, only sexy lady
Fooling around, all you do is keep me hanging around
You're really so hard to please
You've gotta really watch that, baby!

You just, you just, fooling around with me
You just, you just, fooling around with me
You keep fooling, you keep fooling
Fooling, fooling, fooling, fooling
Fooling...
Want to play, but you always want it all your own way
You got it easy but you don't give a damn
Fooling around, you just keep fooling around with me
You just keep fooling around with me, yeah

I'm a fool, fool, fool, fool for you baby
Keep fooling around
I'm a fool, fool, fool, for you sexy baby
Keep fooling around
I'm a fool, fool, fool, fool for you baby
Keep fooling around
