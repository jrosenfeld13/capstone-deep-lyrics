Once I could see
Now I am found out, I've been set free
Nothing ever seems to bother me
And time is passing by but leaves no thrill
Under the moon

You see how they smile
Hope that you'll never be like them
Kaleidoscope turn in be your friend
This time just wasn't made for you and me
Under, under the moon

Aaaaaa

I'm afraid of losing you
Am I? Am I?
Your a part of something new
Am I? Am I?
Am I really losing you?
Am I? Am I?
Being part of something new
Am I? Am I?
