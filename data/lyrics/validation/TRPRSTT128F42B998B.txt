I can't listen while I'm breathing fire
I don't think straight when I get pissed off
It'd be easier to just calm down
'cause I'm an asshole when I get called out

Forget the words I said -
I was not myself
I never really thought you were psycho
I was just mad and feeling attacked
I never really thought you were psycho

There's talk
But then there's talk
Where we get so convinced of the thoughts we've got
Like lines in black and white
The tail of the snake is in it's teeth tonight

I thought for sure this time I was innocent
And that the girl I love had gone psycho
I was just mad and feeling attacked
I never really thought you were psycho

I know I must've stressed you out
I don't start fights I make explosions
It'd be easier to just calm down
But I'm an asshole when I get called out

Forget the words I said
I was not myself
I never really thought you were psycho
I was just mad and feeling attacked
I never really thought you were psycho
