Hey There, how, how's it going?
Long time no see

I know I haven't been around much lately
But it didn't seem like you wanted me to be
The last time I sent down a message
You nailed it to the cross
So I figured I'd just leave you to it
Let you be your own boss

But I've been keeping an eye on you, I have
And it's amazing how you've grown
With your technological advances
And the problems you've overthrown
And all the beautiful art you've created
With such grace and such finesse
But I admit there are a few things I'm afraid
Have impressed me less

So I'm writing to apologize
For all the horrors committed in my name
Although it was never what I intended
I feel I should take my share of the blame
All the good I tried to do was corrupted
When organized religion got into full swing
What I thought were quite clear messages
Were taken to unusual extremes
My teachings taken out of context
To meet the agendas of others
Interpretations taken to many different ways
And hidden meanings discovered

Religion became a tool
For the weak to control the strong
With all these new morals and ethics
Survival of the fittest was gone
No longer could the biggest man
Simply take whatever he needed
Cause damnation was the price
If certain rules were not heeded

Some of the deeds committed in my name
Made me wonder where I went wrong
Back at the start when I created this
The foundation seemed so strong
See all the elements were already here
Long before I began
I just kind of put it all together
I didn't really think out a long-term plan

I made the sun an appropriate distance
And laid the stars across the sky
So you could navigate the globe
Or simply watch the sun rise
I covered the earth with plants and fruits
Some for sustenance and some for beauty
I made the sun shine and the clouds rain
So their maintenance wasn't your duty

I tried to give each creature its own attributes
Without making them enveloped
I gave you all you all your own space to grow
And in your own way space to develop
I didn't know such development
Would cause rifts and jealousy
Cause you to war against each other
And leave marks on this planet indelibly

You see, I wasn't really the creator
I was more the curator of nature
And I want to set things straight with homosexuals right now:
I don't hate ya
I was a simple being
That happened to be the first to yield such powers
I just laid the ground
It was you that built the towers

It was you that invented bombs
And the fear that comes with them
And it was you that invented money
And the corrupt economic systems
You invented terms like "just war"
And terms like "friendly fire"
And it was you that didn't know when to stop digging deeper
When to stop building higher

It was you that exhausted the resources
I carefully laid out on this earth
And it was you that even saw these problems coming
But accredited them little worth
It was you that used my teachings
For your own personal gain
And it was You that committed such tragedies
Even if they were in my name

So I apologize for any mistakes I made
And when my words misconstrued
But this apology's to Mother Nature
Cause I created you

Everything is broken
Everyone is
Everything
Everyone
