I'll never be hip in the magazines
(That don't matter)
And I don't mix in those social scenes
(Just don't bother)
I'm not in the book on the coffee tables
(I don't care)
And I just don't fit designer labels
We're out there

We've just got each other
One love and one lover

This must be the start of something special
Taken to the heart as something special
When we're apart we're together
Welcome to the start of forever

It's such a release just to be with you
(We're together)
Even when I can't speak my love talks to you
(You're my lover)
You don't tie me down, you just set me free
(Easter, brother)
I don't want more than you to be with me
(Undercover)

I can't express it better
Mere words lack the lustre
