I want I want to go to heaven
I want I want to go to heaven

You're ruling the way that I move
And I breathe your air
You only can rescue me
This is my prayer

If you were mine
If you were mine
I wouldn't want to go to heaven

I cherish the day
I won't go astray
I won't be afraid
You won't catch me running
You won't catch me running
You won't catch me running

You take my air

I want I want to go to heaven
I want I want to go to heaven

You're ruling the way that I move
And I breathe your air
You only can rescue me
This is my prayer

I want I want to go to heaven

I cherish the day
I won't go astray
I won't be afraid
You won't catch me running

You take my air

This is my prayer

I cherish the day
I won't go astray
I won't be afraid
Won't run away
Won't shy

I cherish the day
I won't go astray

I cherish the day
I cherish the day
I cherish the day
I cherish the day
I cherish the day
