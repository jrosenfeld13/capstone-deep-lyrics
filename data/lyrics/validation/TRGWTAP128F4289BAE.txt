[Verse 1]
I don't know what brought us here
Something in the stars said you and me
I don't know where this feeling comes from
Surely it was meant to be
For I have known you even in my dreams
My eyes are open, my heart can see

[Chorus]
As sure as stars light the midnight sky
As sure as children wonder why
As sure as newborn babies cry
I was born to give my love to you
Born to give my love to you

[Verse 2]
Heaven must be holding on
To all the love I'm feeling now
Here we are this is the moment
And I believe it's our turn somehow
Hearts together, hands across the night
One forever, finally in sight

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I was born to give my love to you[repeat until fade]
