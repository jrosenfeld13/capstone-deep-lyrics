I want, I know, I see just how ya feel
But baby, you got a ticket to ride
But if you want me, gots to let me know
Cause it's so hard to let you go
Well I've been around this block ten thousand times
So just patch me, just one more line
And if you want me, gots to let me know
Cause it's so hard to let you go

I've got one life to live in
So won't you stop and listen
Can't keep my head from spinnin all around you

I want, I know, I see just how ya been
And your livin and sinnin starts runnin thin
But if you want me, gots to take it slow
Cause it's so hard to let you go

I've got one life to live in
So won't you stop and listen
Can't keep my head from spinnin all around you
And if ya see me slippin just keep my head from hittin
I'd stop the world from spinnin all around you

But I'm frustrated, so frustrated
Seems like I've been there before
But I'm frustrated, so frustrated
Seems like I've been there before

So as the story goes, you know it well
So listen fuckers, it's the one to tell
But if you want me, gots to let me know
Cause it's so hard to let you go
