Leaving all their thoughts behind
Passing over timeless wastes of ecstasy
Freedom strangled at the source
Takes the only charted course
That leads them home
Their bodies move towards the dawn
The light in which a nation born
Can only hope, and only weep
Their passion may be growing weak

How was alone, recall me if you can
I feel I am lost within you
Many times within the sound of emptiness
A light has shown deep in each others soul
Keeps them apart, a love now makes them whole
Fractured memories tearing at all their dreams
Made life and living a faded scene

To give a name locked in despair
Makes chances of a lifetime course across your eyes
To give and get, and yet return
Emotion smoulders, starts to burn in harmony
They lay within a ruined shell
Searching for the time to tell
That he who followed endlessly
Does not exist, can never be

How was alone, recall me if you can
I feel I have lost within you
A part of what is held inside a deep regret
Taking over all that a hearts request
Answered by cries from a wilderness
Found forgotten lying in deeper sleep
Touching once is so hard to keep

In emptiness, a light has shown deep in each others soul
Keeps them apart, a love now makes them whole
Fractured memories tearing at all their dreams
Made life and living a faded scene
Taking over all that a hearts request
Answered by cries from a wilderness
Found forgotten lying in deeper sleep
Touching once is so hard to keep
