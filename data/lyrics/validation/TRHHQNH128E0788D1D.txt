(You know now) Everybody's worried (hey now) about that atom bomb
(Well) No one seems worried about the day my Lord shall come
(You'd better) Set your house in order (fore he) he may be coming soon
(And then he'll) hit like an atom bomb, when he comes, when he comes

In nineteen hundred and forty-five
The atom bomb became alive
In nineteen hundred and forty-nine
The USA got very wise
They found that a country from across the line
Had an atom bomb of the very same kind
The people got worried all over the land
Just like the people did in Japan
God told Elias to send down fire
To send down fire from the sky
He showed old Noah how the rainow signs
And there wouldn't be water for next time

(You know that) Everybody's worried (hey now) about that atom bomb
(Hey, hey) No one seems worried about the day my Lord shall come
(You'd better) Set your house in order (for he) he may be coming soon
(And he'll) hit like an atom bomb, when he comes, when he comes

Now don't you get worried just bare in mind
Trust in Jesus and ye shall find
Peace and happiness, joy, devine
Will King Jesus on the line
God told Elijah to send down fire
Send down fire from the sky
He said he would, and I believe he will
God'll fight your battles if you just keep still

(You know that) Everybody's worried (hey now) about that atom bomb
(Well) No one seems worried about the day my Lord shall come
(You'd better) Set your house in order (for he) he may be coming soon
(And he'll) hey, hey, hey, hey my Lord (you know he'll)
Hit like an atom bomb, when he comes, when he comes

(You know now) Everybody's worried (hey now) about that atom bomb
(Hey now) No one seems worried about the day my Lord shall come
(You'd better) Set your house in order (for he) he may be coming soon
(And he'll) hey, hey, hey, hey my Lord you know he'll
Hit like an atom bomb, when he comes, when he comes
