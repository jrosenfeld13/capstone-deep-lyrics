The dogs at dawn barking
Of hunger, no sharking
Searching for something
Intention: no running

If you ever feel lonely - sing
And life is gettin phoney - sing
It is your voice only - sing
That cares so boldly - sing

Pressure, not wanting
Soul is in hunting
Life towards shanti
Aliens shouting

If you ever feel lonely - sing
And life is gettin phoney - sing
It is your voice only - sing
That will ring out so loud

Giving it up coz the life is a lie... (one way to hell!)
Wish I could feel you, wish I could save from farewell
Running around coz the the life is a lie... (swords of the spell)
Wish I could heal you... wish I could heal!

Pressure, not wanting
Soul is in hunting
Life towards shanti
Aliens shouting

If you ever feel lonely - sing
And life is gettin phoney - sing
It is your voice only - sing
You'll wake the dead, sounding bright

I don't care if you paint my jesus in a funny way
Cause in fact I think in a same way
Can you apologize? or would it be bad for your buissiness?
Can you apologize? or are you too broud to beg? coz I ain't

If you ever feel lonely - sing
And life is gettin phoney - sing
It is your voice only - sing
That will ring out so loud
