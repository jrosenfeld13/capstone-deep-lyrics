You said 'hello'
Your amorous voice - sounding dew
Floating upstairs with a kiss in mind
You found me distant

I was a ghost - invisible boy

You said 'it is so cold'
And you were right all the time
We slept in a shivering bed
To break at last

I was a ghost - invisible boy

[Chorus:]
There's a crow on my shoulder
And a void in my head
There's a crow on my shoulder
I can't love while I'm dead

[Eldron, 10.9.01]
