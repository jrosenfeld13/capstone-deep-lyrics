[Intro: Bluknight]
Young Bluknight on the beat, yeah

[Hook: Roland]
I already told you once, won't say twice, twice, twice, twice
Looking at me, dealing with me, so excited
If you wanna smoke, then, bro, you're invited
Spinning on the color wheel, yo, what we gon' get?
Yellow bone, redbone, blue blood, cool as Klondike
Brenda, LaTisha, Linda, sugar and spice
Darkword, darkworld, based world, like Squall and Strife
DXD, RF, 84 for fucking life

[Verse 1: Staryu]
Damn, I've asked you twice now so please don't hurt my feelings
You have the cards now but you just keep falling
I like to gamble so I just keep rolling
My mind is made up and I'm not bluffing
This is why I asked you twice, twice, twice, twice
Why do I roll these dice, dice, dice, dice?
Words so nice, and I've never felt so right
My money where my heart is and I paid the price

[Hook: Roland]
I already told you once, won't say twice, twice, twice, twice
Looking at me, dealing with me, so excited
If you wanna smoke, then, bro, you're invited
Spinning on the color wheel, yo, what we gon' get?
Yellow bone, redbone, blue blood, cool as Klondike
Brenda, LaTisha, Linda, sugar and spice
Darkword, darkworld, based world, like Squall and Strife
DXD, RF, 84 for fucking life

[Verse 2: Animepapi]
You only hit my phone when you're home alone, girl
Throw me a bone or get out my zone, girl
We just gon' fight, you gon' hit up your homegirls
Who wrong, who right, please just don't leave me on my own, girl
I already told you once, I'll tell you twice, twice, twice, twice
I be on my grind but need you in my life, life, life
I know I ain't perfect but I'll try, try, try, try
If we stick together, we gone shine, shine, shine, shine

[Hook: Roland]
I already told you once, won't say twice, twice, twice, twice
Looking at me, dealing with me, so excited
If you wanna smoke, then, bro, you're invited
Spinning on the color wheel, yo, what we gon' get?
Yellow bone, redbone, blue blood, cool as Klondike
Brenda, LaTisha, Linda, sugar and spice
Darkword, darkworld, based world, like Squall and Strife
