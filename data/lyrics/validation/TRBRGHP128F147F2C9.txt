Stop!
Does he know the way out of here
Or will she again interfere
It's happening all over again

Lady Ice and Mr. Hex
She'll leave you could he'll make you flex
They disappear without a trace
Accelerate and take your place
The creep's arrived, he's in your home
Like all the dreams you've never known
He's standing by to steal your luck
He's spotted you, you're panic struck

Stop!

Stop!

They're standing either side of you
They guide you but they block your view
Lady Ice with medium cool
Will set you up she's watching you
She'll trip you out and trap you in
Strain every nerve to make you spin
He'll pick you up and make you strong
Thrust up, boost on, the man is gone

Stop!

Does he know the way out of here
Or will she again interfere
It's happening all over again

Look!

They made me a promise today
They know that I can't go away
It's happening all over again
