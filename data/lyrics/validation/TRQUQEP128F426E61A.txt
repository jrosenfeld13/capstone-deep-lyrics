I wanna survive
This is the warning
Principles are dead
Morality can wait
You've got to survive in this jungle
Stick it in your mind

This is the warning
Enemies are watching

Open the window
Jump on the roof
Danger can come
From everywhere
My skin is damp, I'm shivring
Am I scared or am I cold
The tension rises

You've got to survive
Stick it in your mind
It's your Leitmotiv

THIS IS AN EMERGENCY
