He is always there to pick you up and rescue you when you fall, he gives comforting words, when life isn't going so well, He knows you aren't an example of perfection, but wants you to stand up to the race. He is an example of a man who looked his fears in the face. He loves you because you are you, nothing more nothing less. He showed what it was to stand up and be a man, when times were tough it was ok to cry too, he is almighty but had not one single drop of pride, He proved his love to you, when he was crucified. What I'm trying to say is that God has always loved you. What I'm trying to say is that God will always love you
