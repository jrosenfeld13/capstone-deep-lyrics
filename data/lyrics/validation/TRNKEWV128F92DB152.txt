Plenty wahala, plenty dey gpeme
For the sake of our ignoranci oh weg et this pain for bele
See no be because dem no born you
With silver spoon for mouth, say u be ogpe

Make I tell my story oh
Make I tell you my story oh

Africa, Nigeria from Warri to Abuja
Lagos States, Niger Delta
Africa, you are so beautiful, beautiful

Some dey sick, some dey well
Some dey tatafo, some dey aproko
We dey call oghene, we dey call chineke
Wetin go save us from d pain wen we dey go through

Africa no one else go save you but you
It is time to arise
Take away your pride, it is time to arise, yes

Africa, Nigeria from Warri to Abuja
Lagos States, Niger Delta
Africa, you are so beautiful

We are living in a world, self-centered
Making our own hell fire just by ourselves
And then we start with eye service to make one notice us
Can't we see the way we lie to ourselves?

Africa, Africa, Africa, Africa, Africa
Africa, Africa, Africa, Africa, Africa
Africa, Africa, Africa, Africa, Africa
Africa, Africa, Africa, Africa, Africa

Africa, Africa, Africa, Africa, Africa
Africa, Africa, Africa, Africa, Africa
Africa, Africa, Africa, Africa, Africa
Africa, Africa, Africa, Africa, Africa, Africa
