I thought it was understood
I'm going out into the woods
To see what is left of me

And all these wolves
Shoot hungry looks
Like crowded streets of vampire teeth
In the city

The garden grows as if she knows
When air gets thin
To let no one in
She knows that nothing grows

And I foresee some changing
With battered hearts recovering
The woods have never been so full

And I go outside
To see familiar lives
Race through to finish lines then start again
Come on!

And I go outside
To see familiar lives
Race through to finish lines then start again
Come on!
