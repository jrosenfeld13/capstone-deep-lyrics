Is there a vacuum in me
Is there a great big hole
Does my life suck as bad as yours
(Will you swallow my soul?)
Is there a thought in my head
You walk a mile in my bed
Is there life before death
Can you breathe my thick hot breath
Can you kiss it
And make it feel better
Can you kiss me
And make me feel
Can you fill
My aching need
Will you hold me as I bleed
Time will wait for me to fall
It's the original fall
I'm not everything that I need
It's not good to be alone
Cause I'm naked and ugly and scared
And I'm falling everywhere
I can feel my heart turn grey
Cause I love and hate you
I have everything thing
That I lack
As I push my heart to black
By one man sin came in
We all restart that flame
I think it sucks
(I know it does)
But, it's all in the beginning
