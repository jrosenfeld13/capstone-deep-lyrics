I love you 'cause you're sympathetic
You listen once and soon forget what I said
'cause it's all in your head

I love you like a new adiction
You kiss me once and then go missing
So long, you've been gone all along

With your happiness and satisfaction
Distorted by the big attraction
I cut you down and set you free
I pull the darkness over me

I can't help it, I can't help myself
And you know it
'cause there's nobody else
Yer, there's nobody else

Waking up was not so easy, you sobered up quite completely, feel down
There was no one around

But, your sentimental chain reactions
Tied to all the old distractions
I held you temporarily
To rest your bones here next to me

I can't help it, I can't help myself
And you know it
'cause there's nobody else
Yer, there's nobody else

It's just happiness and satisfaction
Safely in the ground reaction, (?)
It'll make you who you wanna be
I pull the darkness over me

I can't help it, I can't help myself
And you know it
'cause there's nobody else
Yer, there's nobody else
Nobody else
