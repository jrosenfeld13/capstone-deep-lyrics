I was down on the east side
On a block with no name
When I walked in a movie
You were blue, I was game
Tell me, did you love it, baby?
Did you think your smile looked right?
Tell me when you came together
Was it in your mind 'cause it sure wasn't out of sight

Didn't know when I entered
Second seat, second row
It was then that I saw you
But your mouth stole the show

Tell me, did you love it, baby?
Did you think your smile looked right?
Tell me when you came together
Was it in your mind 'cause it sure wasn't out of sight

Got your name, got your number
Got your form on the line
I don't know who you're under
But I know it ain't mine

Tell me, did you love it, baby?
Did you think your smile looked right?
Tell me when you came together
Was it in your mind 'cause it sure wasn't out of sight
