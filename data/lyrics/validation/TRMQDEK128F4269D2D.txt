All the times I spent suffering in school y'know
Thinking I was so supercool, and baby
All the teachers gave me so much grief
I wanna blow 'em up just to get some relief
Sister, sister they call me a parasite
Sister, sister they wanna bury me alive
All day, all week, all term long
They'd come for me hoping I'd be gone
Time made me realize
Why should I be victimized?
So I took control and decided to teach
I wanna teach highschool
Highschool yeah
Listen
I tell the little buggers what to wear you know
I show 'em how to set and dye their hair and baby
There'll be no costumes at our swimming pool
There'll be no ugly girls at my highschool
Sister, sister they call me a parasite
Sister, sister they wanna bury me alive
All day, all week, all term long
They'd come for me hoping I'd be gone
Girls who are very bright
Must stay in class all night
And practice their biology
I love to teach highschool...
I love to teach highschool...
1, two, 3, four, 5, six, 7
One, 2, three, 4, five, 6, seven
Time made me realise
That I could brutalise
And get revenge with impunity
If I could teach highshool...
A, B, C, D, E, F, G
How I love anatomy
2+2 and 3+3
Students have a ball with me
