I'd like to be in Charlie's shoes that's what I always said
Cause he had you and everything tied with a golden thread
Then Charlie left and went away and when I got the news
It wasn't long till I was walking round in Charlie's shoes

Now I'm wearing out the shoes that Charlie wore
Walking back and forth across the floor
The troubles that drove him away I've got for company
These nights in Charlie's shoes are killing me

The greener grass that turned my head so swiftly did turn brown
Cause every little dream I build she's always tearing down
I never knew old Charlie's shoes could have so many tacks
Of disappointing sorrows and I wish he had 'em back

Cause I'm wearing out the shoes that Charlie wore
Walking back and forth across the floor
The troubles that drove him away I've got for company
These nights in Charlie's shoes are killing me
