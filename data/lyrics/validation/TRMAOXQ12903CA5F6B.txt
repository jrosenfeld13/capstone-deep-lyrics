What do I become?
The night hidden things
What does the desert dream?
It suffers if it looks back
Whose heart is the ocean's heart?
The one who does ghosts work
Has the will been broken?
Yes, but into an answer

Has the shadow spoken?
Yes, but its a song it whispers
Fourth dawn and silence comes
We see the mountain

Beasts see you cut the limb
And I would not go
They see you bind my hands
And I would not go
They see you bring the flame
And I will not go
They see you raise the blade
Let this be done

Changes teach changes, Lord
Blood teaches blood to blood
Is there always a way home?
Has there ever been one?
Has there ever been one?
Has there ever been one?
Has there ever been one?
