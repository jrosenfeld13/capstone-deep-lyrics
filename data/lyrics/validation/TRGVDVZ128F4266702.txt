[Verse 1:]
Silver screen such a disgrace
I couldn't look her straight in the face
A blue addiction I live in disgust
Degradation I'm being eaten by lust

[Chorus:]
No bone movies [x3]

[Verse 2:]
Inspiration that's blue and uncut
Can't kick the habit obssesion of smut
Voyeur straining in love with his hand
A poison passion pulsating gland

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Flaps

I shouldn't do it the guilt tells me why
I just can't stop it I try and I try
X-rated demon that lives in my head
Hungry for bodge and he wants to be fed

[Chorus]
