Baby lives in a trailer park
Only comes out after dark
Hates her mom, hates the old man
Don't like living in a caravan

Whoa, taxi cab
It ain't nice for girls to grab
She's leaving town on a greyhound bus

Doing time for your baby (Sleazy Come Easy Go)
Time for your man (Sleazy Come Easy Go)
Time for your baby (Sleazy Come Easy Go)
Anyway u can

New York City, Hollywood
She's like she always knew she would, she's
Riding high, playing the game
Moving fast as a hurricane

Whoa, taxi cab
It ain't nice for girls to grab
Don't make a sound, don't make a fuss

Doing time for your baby (Sleazy Come Easy Go)
Time for your man (Sleazy Come Easy Go)
Time for your baby (Sleazy Come Easy Go)
Anyway u can

And she want it, want it, and she want it now
And she want it, want it, and she want it now
And she want it, want it, and she want it now
And she want it, want it

Private plane, crystal queen
Best Peruvian you've ever seen
Lady luck took a dive
She's in stir doing 3 to 5

Whoa, where's that cab
I told you it ain't nice to grab
Don't make a sound, don't make a fuss

Doing time for your baby (Sleazy Come Easy Go)
Time for your man (Sleazy Come Easy Go)
Time for your baby (Sleazy Come Easy Go)
Anyway u can

Doing time for your baby (Sleazy Come Easy Go)
Time for your man (Sleazy Come Easy Go)
Time for your baby (Sleazy Come Easy Go)
Anyway u can

Doing time (Sleazy Come Easy Go)
Doing time (Sleazy Come Easy Go)
I'm doing time (Sleazy Come Easy Go)
Sleazy Come Easy Go
