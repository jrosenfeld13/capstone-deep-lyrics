Late night, it's raining
A total downpour
Meeting at midnight
Below the ground floor
Out of the shadows and into the night
Out of the blue they will swarm to the red light

Tasting the pleasure
Sickened by lust
It's their second nature
And to my disgust

Out of the shadows and into the night
Out of the blue they will swarm to the red light

Late night, it's raining
A total downpour
Meeting at midnight
Below the ground floor
Staring in silence
Make no conversation
Leaving the office
They love the temptation

Out of the shadows and into the night
Out of the blue they will swarm to the red light
Out of the shadows and into the night
Out of the blue they will swarm to the red light
