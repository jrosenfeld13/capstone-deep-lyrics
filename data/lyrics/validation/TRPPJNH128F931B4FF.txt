Entombment
Laid to final rest
Placement in a coffin by request
Makes it an easy task
To find a proper stiff
Indulge in the exhumation quest

In need of a suitable corpse
Proceed with disinterment
The dead are now
To be exhumed

Disturbance and defilement for science
Remains retained
And gathered with patience
Dismembered at site to fit the substandard transport
A pathology feasting
Without reverence

In need of a suitable corpse
Proceed with disinterment
The dead are now
To be exhumed

Mortsafe rupture
Recycle the corpses
Mortsafe rupture
Cadaver carcass snatcher
