[Verse 1]
Look what you've done you hopeless dreamer
Your poor little feet just take you where you've been before
Run like the wind to get your own back
Look what you've done you've made me throw up on your floor

[Chorus]
We've lost our time no time
To tell you what I wanted to say
So sad, too bad, my dreamer

[Verse 2]
Look what we've done the hopeless the dreamers
Shot to the head there's nothing anyone can say
Look in my eyes and beg forgiveness
Look what you've done you've ruined everything we've made

[Chorus]
We've lost our time, more time
To tell you, what I wanted to say
So sad, too bad, my dreamer

[Outro]
We've lost our time, no time
To tell you what I wanted to say
You were, you were
My saviour, for a little while
