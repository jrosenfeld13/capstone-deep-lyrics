A Valentine's Day party
I didn't think you'd show
You don't like making entrances alone
You've got a new friend
You've got a new friend
Likes to go to movies
Likes to drink red wine
Sounds familiar, better hold on tight:
A film school drunk can be so hard to find

You got a new friend
You got a new friend
And the two of you don't ever seem to part

You got a new friend ooh
You got a new friend, now I'm the odd man gone

You got a new friend
You got a new friend, I know

And your mom's got you convinced that he's the one
He's all you need, so forget me  marry him at once
But if you ever change your mind
I could still buy that box of wine
I still have your copy of Harold and Maude

But you got a new friend
Yeah, you got a new friend
