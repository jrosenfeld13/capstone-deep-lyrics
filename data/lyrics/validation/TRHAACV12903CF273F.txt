I've been building scars up
Putting flames out with my fingers
Tell me when my times up
So my hope no longer lingers

Then say no more
Say no more
Say no more

Cause, this is the sound of hurt
Unrehearsed and it's so loud
So, what are you waiting for?
You can't ignore the sound
Of someone breaking down

Somehow, I'm rendered speechless
I get nervous, when you're leaving
So tell me, reassure me
There is something worth believing

Then say no more
Say no more
Say no more

Cause, this is the sound of hurt
Unrehearsed and it's so loud
So, what are you waiting for?
You can't ignore the sound
Of someone breaking down
This is the sound....

Then say no more
Say no more
Say no more

Cause, this is the sound of hurt
Unrehearsed and it's so loud
So, what are you waiting for?
You can't ignore the sound
Of someone breaking down
This is the sound....
