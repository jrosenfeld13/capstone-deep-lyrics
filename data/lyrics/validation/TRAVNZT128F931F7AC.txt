Don't touch it, and all that's a crime
I look to the dictionary just to try to find the word
Really, there's no way to describe this
Never obvious son
Why should I always ask a question
When the answer never comes?
When I see through so many things
And money just doesn't count, not this time

There's a jigsaw world scattered on the ground
I walk on over to look at it
But the pieces are turned down
Jigsaw

In the west each day burns out
Like the embers in my fire
Time to think nobody notices, is it just desire?
In the east I taste a promise, since it made a dip
All the time will make me notice if I let it hit
When I see through so many things
And money just doesn't count, not this time
Not time time

There's a jigsaw world scattered on the ground
I walk on over to look at it
But the pieces are turned down
There's a jigsaw world scattered on the ground
I walk on over to look at it
But the pieces are turned down

This is a theater and now I cannot listen
And I'm moving closer to the closeness
Like a backpack inside my dreams
Is it realy what it seems
It's a jigsaw art with the pieces all turned down
It's a jigsaw art with the pieces all turned down
