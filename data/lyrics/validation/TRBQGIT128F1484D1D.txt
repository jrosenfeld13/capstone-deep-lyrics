My heart is crying
Crying lonely teardrops
My pillow's never dry of lonely teardrops
Come home, come home
Just say you will
Say you will

My heart is crying
Crying lonely teardrops
My pillow's never dry of lonely teardrops
Come home, come home
Just say you will
Say you will
Say you will

Just give me another chance for our romance
Come on and tell me
That one day you'll return
'Cause every day
That you've been gone away
You know my heart does nothing but burn, crying

Lonely teardrops
My pillow's never dry of lonely teardrops
Come home, come home
Just say you will
Say you will
Say you will

Say it right now, baby
Come on, come on
Say it, darling
Say it right now, baby
