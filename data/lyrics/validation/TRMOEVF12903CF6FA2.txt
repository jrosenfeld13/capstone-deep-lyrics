Who's gonna shoe your pretty little feet
Who's gonna glove your hand
Who's gonna kiss your red ruby lips
Who's gonna be your man

Papa's gonna shoe my pretty little feet
Mama's gonna glove my hand
Sister's gonna kiss my red ruby lips
I don't need no man

Fastest train I ever did ride
Was a hundred coaches long
The only woman I ever did love
Was on that train and gone

On that train and gone boys
On that train and gone
Only woman I ever did love
Was on that train and gone

Who's gonna shoe your pretty little feet
Who's gonna glove your hand
Who's gonna kiss your red ruby lips
Who's gonna be your man

Poppa's gonna shoe my pretty little feet
Mama's gonna glove my hand
Sister's gonna kiss my red ruby lips
I don't need no man

I don't need no man
I don't need no man
Sister's gonna kiss my red ruby lips
I don't need no man
