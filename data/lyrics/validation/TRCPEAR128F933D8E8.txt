March the streets
30 or 40 strong
United against
A world that's wrong
The numbers shock you
It's the truth
A mini-army
Of angry youth
Wolfpack! Don't give us any shit
Wolfpack! Or you're gonna get hit
Wolfpack! It's a unity ideal
Wolfpack! Better believe it's real
Fucking proud
To be a part of this
Every kid is my brother here
Shoulder to shoulder
Or back to back
We're united
It's the year of the pack!
Wolfpack! Don't give us any shit
Wolfpack! Or you're gonna get hit
Wolfpack! It's a unity ideal
Wolfpack! Better believe it's real
