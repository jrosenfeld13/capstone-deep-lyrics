We need to talk despite the hour 'cause just like time, this comes too late
You've been tellin' me I need to change or else you'll go away
I've been searching every inch of me to find within myself
A way to give you what you want and not become somebody else

You just want my passion, but you don't want my pain
You don't even really care 'bout what's inside my brain
You think that I don't know what's goin on behind my back
But you seem to underestimate this very simple fact

I won't let you hurt me
I won't beg you to stay
I won't lay down and shut my mouth so you can brag the next day
I won't be a trophy
I won't look the other way
So I guess you got your wish, 'cause babe, I promise
Things are gonna change

The things that brought you to me, now are the very things you hate
It's becoming very clear to me that you're the one whose changed
I used to think that we could make it last; I would love you all my life
But when you tell me I'm not good enough, you know it's just not right

I won't let you hurt me
I won't beg you to stay
I won't lay down and shut my mouth so you can brag the next day
I won't be a trophy
I won't look the other way
So I guess you got your wish, 'cause babe, I promise

*Spanish-speaking*

I won't let you hurt me
I won't beg you to stay
I won't lay down and shut my mouth so you can brag the next day
I won't be a trophy
I won't look the other way
So I guess you got your wish, 'cause babe, I promise

I won't let you hurt me
I won't beg you to stay
I won't lay down and shut my mouth so you can brag the next day
I won't be a trophy
I won't look the other way
I guess you got your wish, 'cause babe, I promise

Things are gonna change
