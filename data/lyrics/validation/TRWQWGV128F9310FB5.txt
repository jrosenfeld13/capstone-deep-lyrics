Non existent in a plane of void before
Merely dust in the winds that form the storm
Now restored as lord of my world
Or disperse into a realm of discord

The extraction of my energy
Evolution or descend into the grave
Dust to dust

So I strive and struggle to find the way
Living life I'm blind unknowing what can be
One chance to grasp to finally see
Another side of my being

The extraction of my energy
Evolution or descend into the grave!

Cursed matter blinds inner being
From astral form
In this world we exist
Only seeing horror!

Non existent in a plane of void before
Merely dust in the winds that form the storm
Now restored as lord of my world
Or disperse into a realm of discord

The extraction of my energy
Evolution or descend into the grave!
