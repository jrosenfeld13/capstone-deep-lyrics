Your heart
Keeps on calling to me
Your eyes
Are dry
But I know tears are falling
Inside
And I just wanna take you home
I just wanna give you love
Baby come and live inside
My heart
And I just wanna set you free
I just wanna make you see
Baby you can live inside
My heart
It's tearing me apart
Your love
I know
How your soul is bleeding
Tonight
And I just wanna take you home
I just wanna give you love
Baby come and live inside
My heart
And I just wanna set you free
I just wanna make you see
Baby you can live inside
My heart
You're tearing me apart
It's tearing me apart
Your eyes
They hold back an ocean
Just cry
Let it go
I will be here to catch you
Tonight
Cause I just wanna give
Yeah I just wanna give
Cause I just wanna give
Yeah I just...
