When we rock the party (what!)

Ladies and Gentlemen, we got BLACKstreet in the house tonight..
And they got a little thing to say to you
C'mon

Ooooo... this is how we roll
In case you didn't know
BLACKstreet is in control
When we rock the party (what!)
Ooooo... this is how we roll
In case you didn't know
BLACKstreet is in control
When we rock the party (break it down)

Friday and the mood is right
For hanging all night
I wanna boo-geh the party till the morning light
Jiggy down from head to toe
Gotta represent you know
Step outside, in my ride, here we go (here we go)

Ooooo... this is how we roll (uh, uh)
In case you didn't know
BLACKstreet is in control (ladies and gentlemen)
When we rock the party (what!)
Ooooo... this is how we roll
In case you didn't know
BLACKstreet is in control
When we rock the party

Ladies everywhere you look
The party's off the hood
And everybody's doing their own thing
And the party's going on (here we go)
Champagne and drinks are on the house
The amp we turn it up
No need to rush cause you know us
We're doing it all night long, hey, hey

Ooooo... this is how we roll (whoh, this is how we roll)
In case you didn't know (ladies and gentlemen)
BLACKstreet is in control
When we rock the party (what!)
Ooooo... this is how we roll (come on)
In case you didn't know (just in case you didn't know)
BLACKstreet is in control
When we rock the party
