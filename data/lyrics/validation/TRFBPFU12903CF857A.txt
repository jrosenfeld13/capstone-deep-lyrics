[Intro]
Do you want it right now

[Verse 1]
Do you know how lucky I feel I am
To find a man who loves me as I am
You never try to change a single part of me
You're easy to love with those qualities

[Pre-Chorus]
And everyday you teach me more and more
Inside me I'm all aglow
And every night you think of only me
Oh, you keep me satisfied
You do all the things I like

[Chrous]
I want you, oh I want you so
Do you want it right now
Oh, I can't let go
I want you so bad, give me all you have
I can show you how, do you want it right now

[Verse 2]
You have a rare sensitivity
I really believe you know how to feel
I trust you with all my heart and soul
You care to much to wanna take control

[Pre-Chorus]
And everyday you teach me more and more
Inside me I'm all aglow
And every night you think of only me
Oh, you keep me satisfied
You do all the things I like

[Chorus]
I want you, oh I want you so
Do you want it right now
Oh, I can't let go
I want you so bad, give me all you have
I can show you how, do you want it right now

(Right now, right now, right now
I got to know, I got to know, I wanna know)

[Bridge]
Do you want it, want it right now baby
Show you how if you want it right now
Do you want it right now
Right here, right now, right now

[Pre-Chorus]
And everyday you teach me more and more
Inside me I'm all aglow
And every night you think of only me
Oh, you keep me satisfied
You do all the things I like

[Chorus]
I want you, oh I want you so
Do you want it right now
Oh, I can't let go
I want you so bad, give me all you have
I can show you how, do you want it right now
