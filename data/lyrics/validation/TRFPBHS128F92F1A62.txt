I said, a-hey, little girl, what do you do?
I've been a-waiting all week for something like you
Because it's Friday night, and everybody's in the streets
I say, come on, come on, come on with me
Hey

It's a party weekend
Gonna be some rock and rollin'
Everybody's gonna get you
It's a party, a party, party weekend

It's a party, it's a party, party
It's a party, a party, party weekend
It's a party, it's a party, party
It's a party, a party, party weekend

I go here, I go there
Wherever it is, I'm gonna get my share
Because I got three days, I got three nights
Ain't nothin' gonna stop my appetite
Hey

It's a party weekend
Gonna be some rock and rollin'
Everybody's gonna get you
It's a party, a party, party weekend

Hey

I said, a-hey, little girl, what do you do?
I've been a-waiting all week for something like you
Because it's Friday night, and everybody's in the streets
I say, come on, come on, come on with me
Hey

It's a party weekend
Gonna be some rock and rollin'
Everybody's gonna get you
It's a party, a party, party weekend

It's a party, it's a party, party
It's a party, a party, party weekend
It's a party, it's a party, party
It's a party, a party, party weekend

It's a party, it's a party, party
It's a party, a party, party weekend
It's a party, it's a party, party
It's a party, a party, party weekend

I said, a-hey, little girl, what do you do?
I've been a-waiting all week for something like you
