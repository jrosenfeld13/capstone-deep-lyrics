I don't want to listen to my radio
I don't want to watch my video

Surviving USA, they say it's okay
You can hide the useless filth, they say it's alright
It's the last days of man on Earth
Last days of man on Earth

I don't want to walk on down the street
Be a moving target for the tax-exempt elite
