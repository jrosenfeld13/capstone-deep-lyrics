[Chorus]
You think you're safe!
But we know what there is to be afraid of
So keep watching your back with a bat in your hands
Because they want you to be dead like them

[Verse 1]
They'll break down your door and walk in your house
They'll take your family hostage
Then they'll hold you down and open your skull
They'll eat your brains for breakfast

[Refrain]
Why are we so blind?
Why can't we see
That they are all the enemy?
Why are we so blind?
Why can't we see
We have to kill them all to be free?

[Verse 2]
And I am arming myself with chainsaws and billy clubs. (To fuck you up)
I'm barricading my house to save all the people and things that I love

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And I will stand alone (we can't make it on our own)
We will fight here today (we'll keep all of them away)
We'll cut off their heads (they'd die if they weren't dead)
And it's not a game, no they can't stay, no they can't, they can't stay

[Bridge]
I never thought of it that way
I guess that they could be coming for me
To think, all this time in school just gave them more to eat
I heard they're rabid. I heard that they're insane
I heard they're Godless killing machines
I heard they're ready. I heard that they're coming
I heard we've got to fight to keep our brains

[Chorus]
