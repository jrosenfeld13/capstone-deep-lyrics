Hope springs to life
Charmed by approaching listlessness
Hands reaching out
To grasp the open emptiness

And, oh, leading me down
Oh, leading me down

And this goodbye
Faced with hope and countenance
Souls slip away
To bask in glowing radiance

And, oh, leading me down
Oh, leading me down

As we run from the sun
And we harbour the lies
And we leave things undone
As we cover our eyes

Does it tear you apart, my love?
Does it tear you apart, my love?
'Cause it tears me apart

Charmed by this light
Sombre guidance in her eyes
Rage would entice
And final moments would arise

And, oh, leading me down
Oh, leading me down
Oh, leading me down

Does it tear you apart, my love?
Does it tear you apart, my love?
Does it tear you apart, my love?
Does it tear you apart, my love?
'Cause it tears me apart
'Cause it tears me apart
'Cause it tears me apart
'Cause it tears me apart
You tear me apart

You tear me apart
