I wanna be loved by you, just you
And nobody else but you
I wanna be loved by you alone
Boop-boop-de-boop!

I wanna be kissed by you, just you
Nobody else but you
I wanna be kissed by you alone

I couldn't aspire
To anything higher
Than to feel the desire
To make you my own
Ba-dum-ba-dum-ba-doodly-dum-boo

I wanna be loved by you, just you
And nobody else but you
I wanna be loved by you alone

I couldn't aspire
To anything higher
Than to feel the desire
To make you my own
Ba-dum-ba-dum-ba-doodly-dum-boo!

I wanna be loved by you, just you
Nobody else but you
I wanna be loved by you
Ba-deedly-deedly-deedly-dum-ba-boop-bee-doop
