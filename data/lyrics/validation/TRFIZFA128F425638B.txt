You turn my generators on
Acceleration is the one
Thing I come from
I'm getting closer to the sun
I lead you til you're
Safe and sound

When the body speaks
Dare to let it flow
When the body speaks
Killing for the first time
When the mind is weak
Dare to let it go
Just to hear you breath
And fall into a whisper
When the body speaks

You feel so precious
To the world
Just fake your vanity
And atumble to the floor
Can't tell my rights
From wrong no more
We cross the borders of
A brand new world
I lead you further from the rules
