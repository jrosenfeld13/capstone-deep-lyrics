I'm putting you, baby
I'm putting you right out of my mind
I'm putting you, baby
I'm putting you right out of my mind
So tired of running after you, girl
And being one and one half steps behind
Go, tell your friends now
Go, tell your friends what Johnny did
Go, tell your friends
Go, tell your friends just what Johnny did
If they don't tell you that you're crazy, baby
Lord, they're as messed up as you is
Let me play my guitar, people
Let me play my guitar, people
I'm putting you
I'm putting you, baby
I'm putting you out of my mind
Mind, mind, mind
I'm putting you, I'm putting you
I'm putting you, I'm putting you
I'm putting you, I'm putting you
I'm putting you, I'm putting you
I'm putting you
I'm putting you, I'm putting you
Right out, right out of my mind
Right out, right out of my mind
Oh, my mind
So tired of running after you, girl
And being one and one half steps
And being one and one half steps
And being one and one half steps behind
