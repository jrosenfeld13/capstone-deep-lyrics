See the look on my face
From staying too long in one place
But every time I try to leave
I find I keep on stalling

Feel like a big old stone
Standing by a strength of my own
But every time the morning breaks
I know
I'm closer to falling

I'm all out of luck
All out of faith
I would give everything
Just for a taste
But everything's here
All out of place
Losing my memory
Saving my face
Saving my face

I'm listening to what you say
Even though I look the other way
You could never understand
The feeling of what I'm needing

I'm all out of luck
All out of faith
I would give everything
Just for a taste
But everything's here
All out of place
Losing my memory
Saving my face
Saving my face

(Ooo-oo, Ooo-oo, Ooo-oo, Oh-yeah)
(Ooo-oo, Ooo-oo, Ooo-oo, Oh-yeah)
(Ooo-oo, Ooo-oo, Oooh-Oh)

Leave it all to me
I will do the right thing
Maybe I'll be everything I need
Leave it all to me
I will do the right thing
Maybe I'll be everything I need
Leave it all to me
I will do the right thing
Do the right thing *(no 3rd one)

I'm all out of luck
All out of faith
I would give everything
Just for a taste
But everything's here
All out of place
Losing my memory
I'm losing the best of me

I'm all out of luck
All out of faith
I would give everything
Just for a taste
But everything's here
All out of place
Losing my memory
And saving my face
Saving my face

Saving my face, Saving my face (Ooo-oo, Ooo-oo, Ooo-oo, Oh-yeah)
Saving my face (Ooo-oo, Ooo-oo, Ooo-oo, Oh-yeah)
All out of faith,I would give everything,Just for a taste (Ooo-oo, Ooo-oo, Ooo-oo, Oh-yeah)
All out of place, Losing my memory, And saving my face (Ooo-oo, Ooo-oo, Ooo-oo, Oh-yeah)
