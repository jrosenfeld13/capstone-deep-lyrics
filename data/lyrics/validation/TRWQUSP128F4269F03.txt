My cowboy boots are worn to the heel
That just about sums up the way I feel
Are you missing me, baby I'm missing you
Friends don't help when I'm feelin' this small
You're the only one who could make me feel tall
Are you missing me, baby I'm missing you

There's no comfort in a bottle of wine
All it's gonna do is mess with my mind
You're, god knows where, while I sit and pine
Won't you come back baby one more time
Come back baby now one more time

The dog won't eat, the cat looks sad
Neither one of them ever felt this bad
Are you missing me, baby, I'm missing you
The sign says stop, but my heart says go
You're the only one who really knows
If you're missing me, baby I'm missing you

There's no comfort in a bottle of wine
All it's gonna do is mess with my mind
You're, god knows where, while I sit and pine
Won't you come back baby one more time
Come back baby now one more time

There's no comfort in a bottle of wine
All it's gonna do is mess with my mind
You're, god knows where, while I sit and pine
Won't you come back baby one more time
Come back baby now one more time

Come back baby, one more time
Come back baby, we'll have a good time

Come back baby, one more time
Come back baby, now one more time
Come back baby, one more time
Come back baby, we'll have a good time
