I'm lying in bed, and right up ahead
Rooms spinning around and I'm thinking about cha
I wish I was dead

You left me today
To find your own way
And when the truth really hits you
Will you be there and innocent?

Don't go away
Don'tcha go away
Don'tcha go away from me
You're everything, you're everything, everything a girl should be

Don't go away
Don'tcha go away
Don'tcha go away from me
You're everything, you're everything, everything a girl should be

I never knew why
You started to cry
Never ever knew that old sadness inside you
Was just a lie

You left me today
To find your own way
And when the truth really hits you
Will you be there, in this lair?
