You lose it
Just to find it
And as you walk right by it
You forget how you got there
And why you never meant to stay

And I won't watch you waste away
And I won't fake another day
And if one truth leads you to five
I still don't believe in your reasons why
I just don't believe in why

You love her
You need her
To feel is to believe her
You know it
You want it
You just can't believe you've got it

And I can't watch you waste away
And I won't beg you still to stay
And if one truth leads you to five
I still don't believe in your reasons why
I just don't believe in why
Just don't believe in why

I couldn't watch you walk away
And not forget it
I couldn't watch you turn to stone
And just regret a single day
Not a single day
Not a single day
Not a single day

If I lose you
Could you find me?
Or would you walk right by me?
The soul and the spirit
Each have got their own limit

And I can't waste another second
Living in hell like it's some kind of heaven
And if one truth leads to another
Then isn't there one I can uncover?
But there isn't one that I will not discover

It's the right time
It's my time
It's the right time
It's my time
It's my turn to discover

And I won't waste a single second
Living in hell as an idea of heaven
And if one truth leads you to five
I still don't believe in your reasons why

And if one truth leads to another
Isn't there one we can uncover?
But there isn't one that we cannot discover
It's the right time
It's our time
It's our turn to discover
