Well I'm craving for a cigarette
Hey give me a light
Feeling kind of thirsty
Give me something that bites
Sure been hanging 'round here
For much too long
All you crazy people waiting for my song
I said

Well here I am
I'm just another one night stand
Anyway I don't know why I'm sad
For my fan club

Waiting for an autograph
Well you must be mad
Standing in the pissing rain
Must be a drag
If that's what you wanna do
I won't say no
If you wanna see more of me
See me after the show
I said

Well here I am
I'm just another one night stand
Anyway I don't know why I'm sad
For my fan club

(Instrumental Break)

Well you send me pretty flowers
While I'm slashing my wrists
Read those little letters
Through my smashed out mists
The dream I shock you
Is my nightmare
I'm the freak that's on display
So stand and stare
I said

Well here I am
I'm just another one night stand
Anyway I don't know why I'm sad
For my fan club
