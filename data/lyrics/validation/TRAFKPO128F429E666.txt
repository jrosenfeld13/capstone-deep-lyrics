[Verse 1: C-Rayz Walz]
I flow, but did you also know
I go to the dojo to practice kicks?
Nonezeo, the hats and the snares throw fits
Catch em and ripmany to sendthis is wildcat music
Kentucky-Ale-drinking got the dame thinking
Howdy do / Howd he do it?  Fluid the session, the essence of
Movement.  Leo in the Pride Lands, repping
Guns and Butter, Balance the weapon.  Check it.  Ima
Protect My Family
Living on the corner.  Got a
Mean Thug Melody blessing the verse
My 86 "Spitamatics" is curved (Word?)
The Lineups without the police
Sting your face, red-light-district your niece
But, on some ludicrous shit, Ill spit til the booth is a blip
Off the Radar.  You aloofto Battle Me is bloopers on clip
Elephant Gunsll lick through the roof of your six
Thats mainstream piss for my We Live kids
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You already know.  You thinking
How?  Wow.  Thats Dead Buffalos
Real is fake.  The Church versus holy smoke
And a Seal Killa told me to votecan you relate?
My Camouflage is Ill like Bill.  Were still clapping
Last seen leaving the building with an Elvis sport jacket
Rapping and laughing at thought splashes.  Bubble your
Brackets.  Ill 3 Card Molly you maggots
Body You bastards, walk a mile in my shoes, burn while
My feet hurt, but my souls in tune
Ravipops is a learning sensation.  They say, Dont do
Anything great if you cant handle congratulations
"Revelations" made Moses disgruntled.  I'm humbled
Your mother should have breast-pumped you three fucks, dude
When insecure, secure what is envy or suffer
The hell of a shell thats empty.  Came
Precise.  Etch A Sketch, your beats is sick.  We the
Men from Risk with the Solar Panelist
Buddha Belly on beatbox, John on bass, Rayz on
Spit, then Gs automatic, usually stick
Lunch at Red Lobsters, Michelle got spliffs
Tell her agency, Lets go!  Kentuckys the shit
