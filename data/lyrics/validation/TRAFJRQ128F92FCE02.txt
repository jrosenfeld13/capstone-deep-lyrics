The signal is subtle we pass just close enough to touch
No questions, no answers we know by now to say enough
With only simple words, with only subtle turns
The things we feel alone for one another

There is a secret that we keep, I won't sleep if you won't sleep
Because tonight may be the last chance we'll be given
We are compelled to do what we must do
We are compelled to do what we have been forbidden
So I won't sleep if you won't sleep tonight

Our act of defiance, we keep this secret in our blood
No paper or letters, we pass just close enough to touch
We love in secret names, we hide within our veins
The things that keep us bound to one another

There is a secret that we keep, I won't sleep if you won't sleep
Because tonight may be the last chance we'll be given
We are compelled to do what we must do
We are compelled to do what we have been forbidden

Until the last resilient hope is frozen deep inside my bones
And this broken fate has claimed me
And my memories for it's own
Your name is pounding through my veins
Can't you hear how it is sung?
And I can taste you in my mouth
Before the words escape my lungs and I'll whisper only once

There is a secret that we keep, I won't sleep if you won't sleep
Because tonight may be the last chance we'll be given
We are compelled to do what we have to
We are compelled to do what we have been forbidden

'Cause you will be somebody's girl and you will keep each other warm
But tonight I am feeling cold
