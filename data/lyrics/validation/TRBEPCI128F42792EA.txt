As the music roared
We moved through the crowd
I kissed your lips
There was no one around
There was no one around

In a house made of glass
There's a boy throwing rocks
Every love's like his last
Cause your heart's all you got
Yeah your heart's all you got

Cos it's been so long
Since you've been around
I've never missed a stranger before
I think it's love
It's Judas's call
I've never missed a stranger before, like you

She wore lace round her hair
Yeah she looked like a queen
With eyes so fair...
She was something of a dream
Shw was something of a dream

Cos it's been so long
Since you've been around
I've never missed a stranger before
I think it's love
It's Judas's call
I've never missed a stranger before, like you

Cos it's been so long
Since you've been around
I've never missed a stranger before
I think it's love
It's Judas's call
I've never missed a stranger before, like you
