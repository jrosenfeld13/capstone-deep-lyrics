No devil, no angel
But I know how to be a stranger
I do not know my way about
But I'm seeking a way out
Out of a roundabout
Where are you from?
I really feel
Your eyes on me
Welcome
I am animated
Come enter a life
A life with me
Welcome
You are nominated
To be my next catastrophe
You are one small wonder
Here to tear, tear me asunder
I'm on a station here somewhere
Destination lies nowhere
Dare to meet me there?
Good luck if you do
Decide
Decide to take this ride
Be warned, I can't guarantee
That I would be
Good news for anyone
