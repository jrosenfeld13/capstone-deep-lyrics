If you ever feel like you're gonna fall - Oh I'll be there
And if you ever feel down or feel small - Oh don't despair
And if you ever feel lost or feel alone - Babe come on home

Let's just make love - All night
Let's just hold on - So tight
Let's make it last - For life
I won't let you go

Yeah we're flying
Feels just like flying
We're such a long way up
From the ground
Just you and me flying
So high and I'm never gonna come down

Every time you turn around and wanna run - Oh come to me
When every little dream comes undone - Oh don't worry

Let's just make love - All night
Let's just hold on - So tight
Let's make it last - For life
I won't let you go

Yeah we're flying
Feels just like flying
We're such a long way up
From the ground
Yeah - Just you and me flying
So high and I'm never gonna come down - No

Yeah it's just you and me
Oh let's just make love - All night
Let's just hold on - So tight
Let's make it last - For life
I won't let you go

Yeah we're flying
Feels just like flying
Ohh, we're such a long way up
Ohh, from the ground
(Yeah we're flying,)
Yeah we're flying
(Feels just like flying,)
Feels like flying
(We're such a long way up,)
A long, long way up, from the ground
Yeah we're flying
So high and
We're never gonna come down
You and me
