Darling this is my desire set your little old heart on fire
Do the things that lovers always do
So put your little hand in mine I buy you diamond ring so fine
Then I'll build a bungalow for two
Closer a little closer well there ain't no use to stay so far away
So darling turn on all your charms while I hold you in my arms
Let old mother nature have her way
[ steel ]
Now my baby take a chance for I'm just achin' for romance
And know that you were meant for me to love
You know your heart is beatin' fast you know I'm gonna win at last
So cuddle up and be my turtle dove
Closer a little closer well there ain't no use to stay so far away
I like to touch your lips to mine like to win your love divine
Let old mother nature have her way
[ guitar ]
Closer a little closer well there ain't no use to stay so far away
Cause baby when I hold your hand I feel just like a grown up man
Mother nature says now that's the way
