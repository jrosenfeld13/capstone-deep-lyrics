Chaos on the streets
What a price to pay for glory
Loud, proud, and punk
Just another East Side Story

1 to start the fight
3 to do it right
Bottle to the head
Boot between the eyes

The story of my life!

Back with a bang now! Oi! Oi! Oi!
Taking back the street with fury
Blood, sweat and guts
Yeah another East Side Story

Get ready for your life!

In the streets we're gonna fight for glory
Fist to fist we'll end the stories
Yeah I ain't never been sorry
And when in doubt I'll knock 'em out
Give 'em the boot, give 'em the boot now!

Give 'em the boot, give 'em the boot now!
And when in doubt just knock 'em out!
