Take all the time that you want
Take all the time that you need
Slow and easy
You might succeed

Time precious time, precious time, precious time, precious time
Time precious time, precious time, precious time, precious time

Searching for scars that you hide
Looking beneath very stone
Half deep half empty
This must be home

Time precious time, precious time, precious time, precious time
Time precious time, precious time, precious time, precious time

Remember, remember

Time precious time, precious time, precious time, precious time
Time precious time, precious time, precious time, precious time

Remember, remember
