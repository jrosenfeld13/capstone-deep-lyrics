The dead will take you in

Leave me alone, can't you see I'm dying here. I'll rip you, wide open. Just let me go, there's no more use for me
So cold I'm shaking

Are you all dead? Dead and walking, corpses talking. Is your blood red and beating? Still screaming "don't let them take me"

I'm paralyzed, my arms rest at my side. Stop testing, I'm resting. Incessantly, you're making a mistake. It's just my time now

Leave me alone, can't you see I'm dying here. I'll rip you, wide open. Just let me go, there's no more use for me. So cold I'm
Shaking

A pinprick glow, my heart rate is still falling let me go

I'm lost, this shaking won't stop, there's no hope

Close my eyes, take me before I
Realize, that there's still a
Chance to change, to live, and never fade away. I wake...
Don't wait. The dead will take you in
Like too much insulin
