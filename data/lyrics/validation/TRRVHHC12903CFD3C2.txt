'Cause I do, I do, I do
I do, I do, I love you like a fool
(Love you like a fool)
I've been there by your side
We've been laughing, we have cried
Kept the piece of heart you gave
From our breakup day
You left me, still, I know
You didn't have a choice
Waiting for the day we're back together
I won't give you up, I'll never stop
I got a piece of your heart, I can't get enough
'Cause I do, I do, I do
I do, I do, I love you like a fool
(Love you like a fool)
Our lives were torn apart
I know we'll get a brand new start
When the world just can't decide
Where we lay our love
We've done our time alone
And never will again
Waiting for the day we're back together
I won't give you up, I'll never stop
I got a piece of your heart, I can't get enough
'Cause I do, I do, I do
I do, I do, I need you
I won't give you up, I'll never stop
I got a piece of your heart, I can't get enough
'Cause I do, I do, I do
I do, I do, I love you like a fool
(Love you like a fool)
Waiting for the day when I hear you say
Our love is here to stay
I won't give you up, I'll never stop (Never stop)
I got a piece of your heart, I can't get enough
'Cause I do, I do, I do (Oh yes, I do)
I do, I do, I need you
I won't give you up, I'll never stop
I got a piece of your heart, I can't get enough
'Cause I do, I do, I do (Yes, I do)
I do, I do, I do (Yes, I do)
I do, I do, I love you like a fool
(Love you like a fool)
