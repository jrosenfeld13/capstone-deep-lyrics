People say our love won't last too long
But who are they to judge us
Just because they see our love is strong
Built on love and affection

What we have inside our hearts
Will last forever and ever
Whereas no way we can ever part
Honey, I wish for no other

When I'm alone with you
You're the only one I'm thinking of, girl
Cause I got a lot of love
I want to give you

A lifetime love, girl
I want to share a lifetime love affair
Only with you
Only with you
Only with you

Lovers come and lovers may go
Honey we've got something special
The kind of love that only grows and grows
Each time that we are together

Two hearts that beat as one
Having fun in the sun
And I just want to tell you, girl
How much I thinking of you

When I'm in love with you
You're the only one I'm thinking of, girl
'Cause I've got a lot of love
I wanna give to you
A lifetime love affair, girl

When I'm in love with you
You're the only one I'm thinking of, girl
'Cause I've got a lot of love
I wanna give to you
A lifetime love affair, girl

A lifetime love, girl
I want to share a lifetime love affair
Only with you
Only with you
Only with you
