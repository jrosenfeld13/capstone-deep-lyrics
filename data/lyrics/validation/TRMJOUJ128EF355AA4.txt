(m. riperton - r. rudolph)

If you come with me
I will show you things you always dreamed of
We can make it happen on our island in the sun

Every morning we will swim in
Cool clear sparkling waters
Wrapped in purple satin nights
We'll make slow love

If you come with me
Please bring all your secret yernings
You'll find what you need on our island in the sun
Close your eyes and you will hear the palm trees gently swaying
I can hardly wait to get my hands on you

Time is wastin'
Come pluck the fruit your mind is tastin'

Or will you keep on chasin'
"if only it could be"

If you come with me
We'll live happy ever after
We could be so free on our island in the sun
Secret thoughts your heart conceals like ancient buried treasures
Will at last be whispered in love's ear

Time is wastin'
Come pluck the fruit your mind is tastin'
Or will you keep on chasin'
"oh, if only it could be"

Come with me
We could be so free
If you come with me
We could be so happy
Come to my island
Come to my island
Come to my island
