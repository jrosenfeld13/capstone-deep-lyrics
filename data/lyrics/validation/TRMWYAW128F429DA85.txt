When Im sleeping at night
I have visions of you
I make believe were running away
To a world of fantasy
Pretty images of you
Are reflected on the clouds in the sky
You appear as an angel from heaven
Bringing love and ecstasy

There are visions of you
Dancing on my ceiling above
I could paint pictures of you
Like a great symphony
When the dream is over
I wish that it could come to life
So I could take you in my arms
To hug and kiss

I have visions of you
Dreaming about you

When the dream is over
I wish that it would come to life
So I could take you in my arms
To hug and kiss
But since you are a dream
I can only hope it will come true
So that together we can
Love each other forever

I have visions of you
Dreaming about you
I have visions of you
Dreaming about you
I have visions of you
Dreaming about you
