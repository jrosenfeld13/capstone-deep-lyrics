Juliet, I can feel your glow
Of passions ready to explode
Secrets you kept should all be told
Like blossoms ready to unfold

Juliet, you're not afraid anymore
Juliet, Juliet, I'm not afraid anymore

Sweet love's comin' on, oh
Girl can you hear it? Oh, oh, oh
Standing in the sunshine, oh
Juliet of the spirits

Pleasure is calling you, oh
Girl can you hear it? Oh, oh, oh
Sweet love hon' is what you need, oh
Juliet, I can feel it

Spirits, let your cool light shine
Visions swirling, let me tell you mine
You're a force of nature, can't be controlled
You know you've got it girl, c'mon and let it show

Juliet, you're not afraid anymore
Juliet, Juliet, I'm not afraid anymore

Sweet love's comin' on, oh
Girl can you hear it? Oh, oh, oh
Standing in the sunshine, oh
Juliet of the spirits

Pleasure is calling you, oh
Girl can you hear it? Oh, oh, oh
Sweet love hon' is what you need, oh
Juliet, I can feel it
