When it's time you know it's time
When it's time to go. CHECK CHECK LET'S GO
I'm running out of time to save my soul
I GOTTA GOTTA GOTTA GO to save my soul

TICK TOCK GOES THE CLOCK for so long
I BEEN RUNNIN' FOR SO LONG
TICK TOCK GOES THE CLOCK for so long
I BEEN RUNNIN' AND I CAN'T HOLD ON
HUA

ALRIGHT
I've seen enough, I've seen too much
And I've done my best
To walk away in disgust
But what can you really do
On that bitter cold day
That you find that the truth horrifies?
But scream SCREAM. Shout SHOUT. Spit it all out
And rage against the empty sky and
Anyone with an ear to hear
That's what we've done for years
And all I need's a little more time

JUST GIMME SOME time. ALL I NEED
Just gimme some time
CAUSE I CAN'T HOLD ON
HUA
TICK TOCK GOES THE CLOCK for so long
I BEEN RUNNIN' AND I CAN'T HOLD ON. GO!
WE'VE SEEN ENOUGH WE'VE SEEN TOO MUCH
AND WE'VE DONE OUR BEST OH YEAH
IT'S A BITTER COLD DAY
And I've been running for so long
AND IT'S A BITTER COLD AGE
And all I need is some time. ( ALL I NEED )
Just gimme some time
CAUSE I CAN'T HOLD ON

When it's time you know it's time
When it's time to go. TIME'S UP LET'S GO
I'm running out of time to save my soul
I GOTTA GOTTA GOTTA GO to save my soul

CHECK CHECK 1,2
I've been runnin' for so long
I've been runnin' and I can't hold on much longer
Cause I've been runnin' for so long CHECK CHECK

And all I need's some time
TICK TOCK GOES THE CLOCK
All I need's some time
TICK TOCK GOES THE CLOCK
All I need
All I need's some time
TIME'S UP LET'S GO
All I need's some time
IT'S A BITTER COLD COLD DAY
All I need's some time
All I need's some time
IT'S A BITTER COLD AGE
Time, ALL I NEED

When it's time you know it's time
When it's time to go. TIMES ARE UP NOW

I feel my time slipping away
I can't wait even one more day
I feel my time slipping away
