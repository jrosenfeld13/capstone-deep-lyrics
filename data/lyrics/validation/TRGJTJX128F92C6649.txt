[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
Listen, babe, I think it's time for me to come clean
I mean I haven't been the most faithful
And I don't know how else to say this plain and simple
I been cheatin', believe me
This isn't easy especially since you've been so good to me

The hardest thing I've ever done is tellin' you
You're not the only one, just understand this
You made a man outta ignorance
And like a boy I toyed with innocence
This double lives not worth livin'
Not givin' more to her and I apologize

[Hook: Travie McCoy]
And it's all part of the game
It's just the same old thing with a different name
And we can try and drown the pain
But we both swim too well, to submerge ourselves

And I'm tired of the shame
Of bein' the fool, too cool to maintain two dames
And all I need is time
Please forgive me, darling, the blame's all mine

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
When I come home to you with open arms
Insist on pressin' on my overcoat
The alcohol and still cigarette smoke
I know you've been skeptical, I play it off like you're delusional
The fact is that I'm losin' you

And I'm scared, she doesn't want me
The way I need her to know, she doesn't want me
The way I need her to
I'm pleading with the judge on my knees
God, please just make these charges go away

[Hook: Travie McCoy]
And it's all part of the game
It's just the same old thing with a different name
And we can try and drown the pain
But we both swim too well, to submerge ourselves

And I'm tired of the shame
Of bein' the fool, too cool to maintain two dames
And all I need is time
Please forgive me, darling, the blame's all mine

[Verse 3: Travie McCoy]
Girl, I promise I'll do my best to impress the jury
Cause when the smoke settles and one of us falls to the dirt
It was worth all of the hurt and if not let's cut our losses
Cause you crossed the line, thinkin' I'd choose you over music

That's just stupid, this whole situations bogus
Especially since I'm so focused
From the beginning to the end
And we in with these friends
Unfortunately this is hopeless

Did my best to juggle both of you
Struggled but I'm still here holdin' you
Tie the man up, stand up, put your hands up
If you understand what I'm goin' through

[Hook: Travie McCoy]
And it's all part of the game
It's just the same old thing with a different name
And we can try and drown the pain
But we both swim too well, to submerge ourselves

And I'm tired of the shame
Of bein' the fool, too cool to maintain two dames
And all I need is time
Please forgive me, darling, the blame's all mine
