Down around the corner, half a mile from here
See them long trains run, and you watch them disappear
Without love, where would you be now
Without love-ove-ove-ove
You know I saw miss Lucy down along the tracks
She lost her home and her family and she wont be coming back
Without love, where would you be right now
Without love-ove-ove-ove
Well the lilino is central
On the southern central freight
Gotta keep on pushing mama
You know theyre running late
Without love, where would you be now
Without love-ove-ove-ove
Well the pistons keep on turning
And the wheels go round and round
The steel rails are cold and hard
For the miles that they go down
Without love, where would you be now
Without love-ove-oveooh
Where would you be now
Baby baby baby babe oh wont you move it down
I gotta keep on moving, gotta keep on moving
