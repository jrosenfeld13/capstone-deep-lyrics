I lay down my head
Almost asleep
Tears in my eyes
Why should I weep
I know there's more
Where I am going now
Angels surround me and lead me back home

So if I should die before I wake
I pray dear God my soul he'll take
So don't you cry for my sake
When I am gone
Cause I have just begun to live my life
It's just my faith
Don't ask me why
Cause we're all just here for a time
And then we're gone
Looks like I'm moving on

As I close my eyes
That's when I see
It's not what you know
It's what you believe
And as the page turns
And this world gets the best of me
I hold to my faith
And let hope lead her way

So if I should die before I wake
I pray dear God my soul he'll take
So don't you cry upon my sake
When I am gone
Cause I have just begun to live
I will bravely pay the price
No counting tears or casting doubt
I'm going home

Cause I have just begun to see the signs
I see the light
In the corners of my mind
Parental tears I hear them crying
As the moment passes by
A beeping sound is slowing down
I feel the waves are breaking now
I call to shore and drift away

So if I should die before I wake
I pray dear God my soul he'll take
So don't you cry for my sake
When I am gone
Cause I have just begun to live my life
It's just my faith
Don't ask me why
Cause we're all just here for a time
And then we're gone
Cause I have just begun
I have just begun
I have just begun
I have just begun to live
