Now Little Johnny Jewel
Oh, he's so cool
He has no decision
He's just trying to tell a vision
But some thought that this was sad
And others thought it mad

They just scratching the surface;
JJ can do the floor kiss
Was he on display?
No, no, not today
All that guy ever said
He said, "I want my little wing-head"
He half-asleep at night
Over his head, sensation of flight
And he wake up dreaming...
Dreaming...
And he run down to the airport--
The rush. The roar
And he crouched down behind a fence
With a chest full of lights
Then...
He loses his senses

Oh Little Johnny Jewel
He's so cool
But if you see him looking lost
You ain't gotta come on so boss!
And you know that he's paid;
You know that he's paid the price
All you gotta do for that guy...
Is wink your eye
