[Verse 1]
Plans of man done in the darkness
Sleight of hand will be the process
Enemies created from ghosts
To lure the fools into hunting shadows

[Chorus 1]
The target centuries old
Lust for power and control
Bow down and kiss the ring
Consume, devour, repeat

[Verse 2]
Giants of steel brought down to the earth
With a word from the mouth of a man
Swallowed up in the undertow
Where snarling fangs feast on the brave

[Chorus 2]
The target centuries old
Lust for power and control
Bow down and kiss the ring
Consume, devour, repeat

[Bridge]
My brother, my sister, my father, my son

[Verse 3]
The secrets buried beneath
In the wreckage where it sleeps
As your rats haul away
Evidence of a dark new day

[Verse 4]
Plans of man done in the darkness
Sleight of hand will be the process
Enemies created from ghosts
To lure the fools into hunting shadows

[Chorus 3]
The target centuries old
Lust for power and control
Bow down and kiss the ring
Consume, devour, repeat
[?]... to dominate
[?]
Bow down and kiss the ring
Consume, devour, repeat
