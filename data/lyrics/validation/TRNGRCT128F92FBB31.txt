He called me William Holden Caulfield
It was no compliment
What's wrong with William Holden Caulfield?

All that stuff that bummed me out ten years ago
Still bugs me today, and boy, I wanna know
Who died and made you my mom and me some stupid kid?
How can you forget all those things we did?

So keep on sleeping on
'Til your hair is grey
When I turn eighty
I better feel this way

I'm afraid of people who like Catcher in the Rye
Yeah, I like it too, but someone tell me why
People he'd despise say: I feel like that guy
I don't wanna grow up, cause I don't wanna die

When I'm thirty-one
Then keep living on
For fifty more years

I respect the man in Sunset Boulevard
Got a heart somewhere, just won't let down his guard
Doesn't trust happiness or the bad luck that it brings
He's lonely and he's cold and he's proud of these things

I said I'm cold
And I'm lonely
I'm proud of these things
