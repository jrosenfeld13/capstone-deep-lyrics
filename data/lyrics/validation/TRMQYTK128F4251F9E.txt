Keep your money for the rainy days
To get round the sadness of your face
Free your worries for the better days
Ride my head and touch the sand
Couse I'm back yeah!

My steps always face the ground
My cried tears flew to my youth

See how the moon don't want to hide
And the sun don't want to shine

If you smile at me I'll set you free
Give me diamonds or just disease
Let it go now come on up babe
Please read the book for me again
Cause I'm lying down

My steps always face the ground
My cried tears flew to my youth

See how the sun don't want to shine
And the moon don't want to hide
