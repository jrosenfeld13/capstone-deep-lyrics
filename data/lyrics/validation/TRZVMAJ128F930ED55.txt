Covering ourselves with flesh and carnage
I need your wrist to slit wide open
Raining your blood over my wounds
Wash me with crimson security
Bathe me with your life

And I taste the death upon your tongue
I smell decay between your lungs
While you sucked me like a vacuum
Your need was never complete
And your soul was always tarnished
And your body lay...
And your body lay...
And your body lay rotten

Leave me now
Leave me now
Leave me now
Leave me now

Get out!
Get out!
Get out!
Get out!
