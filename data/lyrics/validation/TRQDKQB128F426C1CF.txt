You're playing the victim
Any man in my shoes would say the same
That's why you have to change
With God as my witness
I'm making promises
This won't be the last time

I'll never be the same
I will beg and plead to never see you gasp your dying breath
I'm glad it's over

I can feel you digging up my bones, just let me rest
I think we failed lying to ourselves, we can pretend
We'll find no remorse in an explanation

Where have you been I've been up all night
I'm taking hold of this lifeless affair
I can't be blamed for giving up on you
Because now there's someone who's taking my place
It's been too long to stay on the ground
Moving on, moving on, moving on, moving on

It's such a simple solution
An end to this misery
I'll enjoy every second of you on your knees
You said you were with me, but where are you now?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you now?

I can feel you digging up my bones, just let me rest
I think we failed lying to ourselves, we can pretend
In an instant everything we love is gone

There are no windows; I've boarded the doors
You're finally getting all that you deserve
If you're looking for her go dig her up
If you're looking for her go dig her up

I can feel you digging up my bones, just let me rest
I think we failed lying to ourselves, we can pretend
