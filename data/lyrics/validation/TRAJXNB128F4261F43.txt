Brother, I'm in need of a friend
For I am drowning in disarray
And brother, it is on you I depend
To pull me out of this misery

Like a hero I've always seen you
Even though I would never say
And through the years
The laughter and the tears
It's you who were strong
In the right and the wrong
A tribute to the world that
Blood is thicker than water

I'm tryin' to say that I love you
I'm tryin to say that I need you
Brother

And father, I'm in need of your hand
So I can face the world bravely
And father, do you understand
What it is you mean to me

Like a warrior you always conquered
Every battle you had to face
And through the hard times
When life was a bitter fight
It's you who would give
So unselfish you lived
A tribute to the world that blood
Is thicker than water

I'm tryin' to say that I love you
I'm tryin' to say that I miss you
Oh, father
