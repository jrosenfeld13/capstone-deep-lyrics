One minute cutting back the ties
One minute seems to signify
Tick tock now sings the second hand
This mortal coil is in demand
The wind that shakes the barley free
This faith you pour in industry
Tick tock this comes as no surprise
These clocks will cut you down to size

Bridge:
All alone, so far away from home
How does it feel?
All alone, a boy left on his own
How does it feel?
Vitriol, a toy he called his own
So heavenly

Oh the broken record duly runs its course
When hiding in corridors, were sleeping with remorse
An ode to a wanderer who wishes we were free
Come out, come out
Leave the barley, let it be

The wind that shakes the barley
The wind that shakes the barley

One minute I can see the lie
Next minute painting our demise
Tick tock now sings the second hand
This century like sinking sand
The wind that shakes the barley free
This future tries to poison me
Tick tock come crashing down the spires
These clocks will cut you down to size

(Bridge)
Oh the broken record duly runs its course
I cant seem to compromise, old habits are divorced
Oh wheres the sympathy when wishing I was free?
Come out, come out
Wherever you are, come out
Leave the barley, let it be

Where the hell, where do we go from here?
How the minutes seem to fade
Take the simple way and face your fear
Come and join the great parade

Where the hell, where do we go from here?
Do we even care at all?
This is consequence itself, my dear
When were headed for the fall

The wind that shakes the barley
The wind that shakes the barley

No more will I believe the lies
No more this moment signifies
Goodbye I sing to you my friend
Some hearts now broken will not mend
The wind that shakes the barley free
You wont go down in history
Tick tock youd best be on your way
Just leave now, get the hell away

The wind that shakes the barley free
The wind that shakes the barley free
The wind that shakes the barley
The wind that shakes the barley
