Chorus
Bottle Of Vodka, We Want More
Smashing Glasses On The Floor
Are We Real Or Are We Fake
Just Go Home Give Us A Break
You Play Dead, We Play Dumb
You Say Talk, We Say Run
You Play Dead, We Play Dumb

You Just Think We're Bubblegum

You Don't Understand, We Play...
We Play Dumb

Excuse Me But We Can Be Late
Why Don't You Abriviate
What You See, Is What You Get

Don't You Understand It Yet

You Play Dead, We Play Dumb
You Say Talk, We Say Run
You Play Dead, We Play Dumb
Don't Call Us, It's Just For Fun

We Play...
We Play Dumb

Interviews Are So Much Fun
