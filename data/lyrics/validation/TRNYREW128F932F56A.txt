I believe my steps are growing wearier each day
Still I've got a journey on my mind
Lures of this old world have ceased to make me wanna stay
And my one regret is leaving you behind
If it proves to be his will that I am first to go
And somehow I'll be feeling it will be
When it comes your times to travel like wise don't feel lost
For I will be the first one that you'll see
And I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
I'll be waiting drawing pictures in the sand
And when I see you coming I will rise up with the shout
And come running through he shallow waters reaching for your hand
Through this life we've labored hard to earn our meager fare
It's brought us trembling hands and failing eyes
I'll just rest here on this shore and turn my eyes away
Until you come then we'll see paradise
And I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
I'll be waiting drawing pictures in the sand
And when I see you coming I will rise up with the shout
And come running through he shallow waters reaching for your hand
And I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
I'll be waiting drawing pictures in the sand
And when I see you coming I will rise up with the shout
And come running through he shallow waters reaching for your hand
