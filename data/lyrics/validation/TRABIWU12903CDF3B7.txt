Wanna wanna wanna wanna take a ride
Get your clothes off in the summertime
Wanna wanna wanna wanna be surprised
Put a big kiss on these lips of mine

So hot I can't believe it
So hot I can't believe it
So hot I can't believe it
Hey ho, don't be slow, ready to go yeah

Wanna wanna wanna wanna take a dive
Head first into Summertime
Wanna wanna wanna wanna take a ride
Down to the beach with some friends of mine

So hot I can't believe it
So hot I can't believe it
So hot I can't believe it
Hey ho, don't be slow, ready to go yeah

Walking down the street
He looks so pretty, yeah
Pretty as a boy can be

Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!

Wanna wanna wanna wanna take a ride
Get your clothes off in the summertime
Wanna wanna wanna wanna be surprised
Put a big kiss on these lips of mine

So hot I can't believe it
So hot I can't believe it
So hot I can't believe it
So hot I can't believe it
