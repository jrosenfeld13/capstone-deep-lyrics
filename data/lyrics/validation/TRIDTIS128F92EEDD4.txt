Well here I am from Paddy's land, a land of high renown
I've broken the hearts of all the girls for miles from Keady town;
And when they hear that I'm away they raise a hullabaloo
When they hear about that handsome lad then they call O'Donahue

I'm the boy to please her and I'm the boy to tease her
I'm the boy can squeeze her up, I'll tell you what I'll do:
I'll court her like an Irishman with me brogue and blarney too is me plan
Me rollikin swollikin hollikin wollikin bold O'Donahue

I wish me love was a red rose growing on yon garden wall
And me to be a dew drop and upon her brow to fall;
Perhaps then she might think of me as a rather heavy dew
No more she'd love the handsome lad they call O'Donahue

I'm the boy to please her and I'm the boy to tease her
I'm the boy can squeeze her up, I'll tell you what I'll do:
I'll court her like an Irishman with me brogue and blarney too is me plan
Me rollikin swollikin hollikin wollikin bold O'Donahue

I hear that Queen Victoria has a daughter fine and grand
Perhaps she'd take it into her head for to marry an Irishman
If I could only get the chance to have a word or two
I'm sure she'd take a notion in the bold O'Donahue

For I'm the boy to tease her and I'm the boy to please her
I'm the boy can squeeze her up, I'll tell you what I'll do:
I'll court her like an Irishman with me brogue and blarney too is me plan
Me rollikin swollikin hollikin wollikin bold O'Donahue
