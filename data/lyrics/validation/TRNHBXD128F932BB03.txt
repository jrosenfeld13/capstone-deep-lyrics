It took me a lifetime to understand
Where I was going to end up at

What do you know
What do you see
What in yourself do you come to believe

This is not my time in this land

What do you know
What do you see
What in yourself do you come to believe

What a selfish life to perceive
Lifes grey enemy
What a selfish life to disown
Your lies
What a selfish life to perceive
This is your enemy
What a selfish life to become
Your loss

Cast in stone

I see this life of denial that you call life

What do you know
What do you see
What in yourself do you come to believe

Life
Your suicide
Of lies
Life:Sick

Waiting inside my head
Inside this life that I don't understand

What do you know
What do you see
What in yourself do you come to believe

I see this life of denial
That you call lies

What do you know
What do you see
What in yourself do you come to believe

Watch out who you trust in this life
Your suicide
Of lies
Sickness of mind

What a selfish life to perceive
Lifes grey enemy
What a selfish life to disown
Your loss
What a selfish life to perceive
Lifes grey enemy
What a selfish life to bestow
Your loss
