[Intro: Elena]
Hey...
I wanna to be bad now!
Get the time...
Ah...

[Verse 1: Elena]
I feel it from the inside
You'd better turn off the light
And keep on doing it right
I'm stock in my obsession
You don't need my direction
Just give me the affection

[Chorus: Elena]
I'm off my way, I'm under pressure
Let's do it this way, just give me pleasure
I'm off my way, 'm under pressure
Let's do it this way, just give me pleasure

[Post-Chorus: Marina]
I'm telling you - keep on doing it!
I'm telling you - keep on doing it!
I'm telling you - keep on doing it!
I'm telling you - keep on doing it!

[Verse 2: Olga & Elena]
It's getting out of control
You make me play my best role
So it up nice and slow
You can't stop look at me
But I want to feel the hit
That's all you need to be

[Chorus: Elena]
I'm off my way, I'm under pressure
Let's do it this way, just give me pleasure
I'm off my way, 'm under pressure
Let's do it this way, just give me pleasure

[Post-Chorus: Marina]
I'm telling you - keep on doing it!
I'm telling you - keep on doing it!
I'm telling you - keep on doing it!
I'm telling you - keep on doing it!

[Outro: Marina]
I'm telling you - keep on doing it!
I'm telling you - keep on doing it!
I'm telling you - keep on doing it!
I'm telling you - keep on doing it!
