[1st Verse]
How can I let you know
How much you mean to me
I know sometimes you wonder why
Are you the one that I need
As sure as I breathe
You are the one for me
And I want you to know

[Chorus]
You fill my heart with love
My tears with joy
And now and forever
I'm yours
With everything you do
Makes my dreams come true
With all of my heart
I'm yours

[2nd Verse]
I think about you all the time
You're always on my mind
The thought of you brings happiness
Inside I know that I am yours
But there's so much more to say
There's something that I got to tell you
So you know that I care, baby

[Chorus]
You fill my heart with love
My tears with joy
And now and forever
I'm yours
With everything you do
Makes my dreams come true
With all of my heart
I'm yours

[3rd Verse]
When I think about you, baby
Joy comes over me
And when I close my eyes boy
Your face is all I see
Your eyes tell me that I'm yours
And there's something that I got to tell you
So you know that I care

[Chorus](2x)
You fill my heart with love
My tears with joy
And now and forever
I'm yours
With everything you do
Makes my dreams come true
With all of my heart
I'm yours
