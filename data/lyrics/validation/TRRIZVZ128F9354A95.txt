Fired up with the devils fuel
I seek an utter high
Leaving an all to boring reality
Everyday, a day to die

Clear, brown or red, doesn't matter much to me
I want to enter a level of ecstasy
Let my veins be filled to get a thrill
What doesn't kill you only makes you ill

Waking up to the demons from yesterday
Aching of pain an decay
I join the demons by refuelling myself
Intoxication is my hideaway

Raving madness suits me fine
You'll never see me spit in the glass
From the darkness of night
Through the lack of daylight
I am at one with the moonshine
