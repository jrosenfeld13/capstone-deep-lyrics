What a duo what a duo what a two
Two carved spoons carve two spoons out of wood
From the same tree from the same bowl the same school
But without one when without one not the same
Lost and looking lost and looking is a shame
Their two hearts two hearts
Holding tight
Over oceans under mountains days and nights
But when together
Hold together
Good glows light
Swapping stockings starting stopping
Borrowed tights
So happy birthday happy birthday
Runny eyes
