Through troubled times, news of hatred, death and war
Find signs of an end, but it may just seem to be okay
And I'm not alone, when I say I feel enough to think
I know there's dark in all things so I find the light and struggle on

[Chorus]
Lead me with a grip so tight, I'll move ahead, I'll break the path
I'll cross the line, and still reach out
Wash my mind or stab my back but spirit stays my friend
You can not sway what's on the inside
Messin' around, but if it feels like serious, I fall to the ground
And I pick myself up, so I can face th days
Learn on my own but I get so much from things I see these days
Vivid, so clear, I can't see why it's hard to understand
