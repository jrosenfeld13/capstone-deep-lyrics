Somewhere my love there will be songs to sing
Although the snow covers the hope of Spring
Somewhere a hill blossoms in green and gold
And there are dreams all that your heart can hold

Someday, we'll meet again, my love
Someday, whenever the Spring breaks through
You'll come to me out of the long ago
Warm as the wind, soft as the kiss of snow

'til then my sweet, think of me now and then
God speed my love 'til you are mine again
