There I was
All alone
Someone in just the right place
For something to go wrong
Just when I thought
That I was safe and sound
He picked all the locks protecting me
And got to me somehow
Just look around
Everything is gone
All that's left is just the heartache I've got on

Chorus:
He walked right in
And robbed me blind
He took all the love I had
It was almost the perfect crime
And slipped away like a thief into the night
Oh but here I am still breathing
The only proof he left behind
Look on my heart
If you want evidence
You'll find his fingerprints

Just how I feel
Is hard to say
I guess the shock'll fade away
But for today I'll be as strong as I can be
I saw the whole damn thing
But I still can't believe

Repeat Chorus

Instrumental

He slipped away like a thief into the night
Oh but here I am still breathing
The only proof he left behind
Look on my heart
If you want evidence
You'll find his fingerprints
Look on my heart
If you want evidence
You'll find his fingerprints
