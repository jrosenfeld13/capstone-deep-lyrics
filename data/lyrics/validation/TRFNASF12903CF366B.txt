Hey
Hiii
Yea I ca- I can see you
You look great
You think.. maybe.. you and I could go out sometime?
That would be goo- that would be great
You're so, so beautiful
Hello

Can you see me?

The scene of a crime
An outline in chalk
Like burgundy wine
There's blood where i walk

The rain hits the ground
I feel myself ill
Eyes staring down
I keep my mind still

I won't go away
I won't ever go
You can't make me leave against my will
I know where you live
I know what you want
Why won't you accept that you need me?

I'm in the backdoor
I keep out of sight
Walk soft on the floor
Don't turn on the lights

They know what I've done
But still don't know how
Perhaps i should run
Just end this right now
Despite my better reasoning I continue
To obsess about this strange beautiful woman
Who would walk her dog each morning outside the
Window of my street level apartment
Each day as she passed I wondered
Whether she could see me hiding behind my curtains
And asked me to take a walk with her and her pet
For one whole year i wondered if we could be together
But now i know that she would've hated me
If only she could...

I won't go away
I won't ever go
You can't make me leave against my will
I know where you live
I know what you want
Why won't you accept that you need me?

You need me

You need me

Why?

Why?

Why?

WHY?

[solo]

I won't go away
I won't ever go
You can't make me leave against my will
I know where you live
I know what you want
Why won't you accept that you need me?

I won't go away, [I won't go away]
I won't ever go, [I won't ever go]
You can't make me leave against my will
I know where you live, [I know where you live]
I know what you want, [I know what you want,]
Why won't you accept that you need me?

You need me, yea

You need me, [x7]
