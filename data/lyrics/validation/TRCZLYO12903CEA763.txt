Downwind there is a comin'
A rumble in the sand
Sets our feet to running
For the fear of the faceless man
For the fear of the faceless man

But if I had an arsenal and if it was ten feet tall
Then I would put an end to it all
And if I had wheat to burn
And if I had a lot to learn
Then it still would not matter what color you were
And if I had but one wish on which to stand
I'd wish the weapons all turn to sand
I'd see the gunners watch their empty hands
Fall down to their sides

Downwind they come up lonely
All hungry for the kill
The horses do the pounding
But it's a blood that's going to spill
It's a dark blood that's going to spill

But if I had an arsenal and if it was ten feet tall
Then it wouldn't matter what color you were
And if I had but one wish on which to stand
I'd see the weapons all turn to sand
I'd see the gunners watch their empty hands

Fall down to their sides

If I had but one wish on which to stand
I'd have the weapons all leave Sudan
I'd see the gunners wash their empty hands
Down by the riverside

Ghost town in my homeland
I will come back again
And if you make a ghost of me
I will still be free
Ghost town in my homeland
I will come back again
If you make a ghost out of me
I will still be free

If I had but one wish on which to stand
I'd see the weapons all leave this land
I'd see the gunners watch their empty hands
Fall down to their sides

If I had but one wish on which to stand
I'd see the weapons all leave Sudan
I'd see the gunners wash their empty hands
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside
