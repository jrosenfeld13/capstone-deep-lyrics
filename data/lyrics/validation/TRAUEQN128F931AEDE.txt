She came to him last night
With a bottle of wine and a broken heart
And he held her in his arms
And he wondered for a while
Was sadness just a broken smile
From a girl with pale green eyes
But he knows now what it was
He was fallen out of love

And she came to him to that night
He was quietly sending candle light
When he heard her at the door
And it ended in this place
Once they held a warm embrace
But it slipped right through their hands
And words just aren't enough
Fallen out of love

She came to him last night
With a bottle of wine and a broken smile
And he held her in his arms
But he wondered for a while is happiness just a broken smile
From a man who's wasting time
But he knows now what is true
He has fallen twice for you
He has fallen twice for you
