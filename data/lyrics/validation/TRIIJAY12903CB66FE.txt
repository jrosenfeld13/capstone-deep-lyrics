It was 1984
We drove down to the shore
It was 1984
Got ready for the show
I want to stay down here forever
Want all my friends to come
It's just an everlasting summer
We just ride and ride and ride

It was 1984
We drove down to the shore
It was 1984

Got lost inside a storm
It's only memories and pictures
Left in the alluring light
There's something looming in the distant
Outside the camera eye

Don't turn away
Just don't turn away
I see that look in your eyes
Don't turn away, don't turn away on love
Everyday I ask myself
How am I getting through
Without a single soul to turn to
Say how am I getting through
Don't turn away
Just don't turn away
I see that look in your eyes
Don't turn away, don't turn away on love
