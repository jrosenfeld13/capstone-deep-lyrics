Something happens to me when I'm lying down
Eyes are closed, but I know that I am wide awake
There's a feeling, a tiny vibration
I can't move and I am unable to use my voice

It's keeping me down
But something's pulling me up
Then increasingly I feel I'm leaving

When I'm moving there's no sound
And my vision's in surround
It doesn't feel unreal
Not like a dream, surreal
It feels like I'm no longer touching the ground

Then above there is something just passing by
- That's my dream
I grab it and change the storyline
When I focus at something it does appear
Like my mind is playing a game I do not know

I know I am one
But still, I'm feeling us both
Need to know if there are any others

When I'm moving there's no sound
And my vision's in surround
It doesn't feel unreal
Not like a dream, surreal
It feels like I'm no longer touching the ground

All this time I've been afraid
That is why I've never stayed
Always felt I need to know
I decided to let go

When I'm moving there's no sound
And my vision's in surround
It doesn't feel unreal
Not like a dream, surreal
It feels like I'm no longer touching the ground
