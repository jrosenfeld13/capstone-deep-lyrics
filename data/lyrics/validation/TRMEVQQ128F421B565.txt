Why?
Should it be so hard to deal with things?
You always slip away
I sit here wasted, twisted on the thoughts
That have come my way
Seeing everything as a paradox
It seems so toxic
Analyze this hopeless situation
With your blinded eyes

You could never see
The nightmare I feel
It always seems
That nothing is real

I don't believe your lies
I don't believe in what you say
I don't believe your lies
I don't believe in anything

Hide
From the endless politics
The money and your tainted life
I know it's time
To break out of the shadows
Find my place in time
Getting out from underneath
The smoke screens
Meant to hide what you create
I figured out that trust was just
My one mistake

You could never see
The nightmare I feel
It always seems
That nothing is real

I don't believe your lies
I don't believe in what you say
I don't believe your lies
I don't believe in anything
I don't believe you're you
I don't believe you're what you say
I don't believe this game
I don't believe in anything

I don't believe your lies
I don't believe in what you say
I don't believe your lies
I don't believe in anything
I don't believe you're you
I don't believe you're what you say
I don't believe this game
I don't believe in anything
Anything
Anything
Anything
