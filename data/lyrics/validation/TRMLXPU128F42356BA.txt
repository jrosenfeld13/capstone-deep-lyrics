Oh yeah!....you know what?
I'm envisioning
Pretty women, Rims spinning
All my homies dressed
In expensive Linnen

It ain't a dream
That's the life we're livin
Mov'in up to a new position

People used to look
And be like, I ain't
Never gonna be shit
That's until I gotta
6 Hundred, v dozen full why equipped whip
And I never stop stacking chips
Fool, got bling in the chain
Got bling on the wrist
And this type of life is priceless
Cause ain't nothing
On earth like this
What you know

[Bridge]
When it's hot it gets crazy
We pop Krystal on a daily
Just me and my ladies, we
Know how to make you move
Your feet to the beat
Can you feel the heat tell
Me sisters do you feel me
Brothers roll with me

[Chorus]
Summertime is the time you've been waiting for oh yeah!
There's always a party
Somewhere round the
Way - oh yeah
Summertime is the time you've been waiting for oh yeah!
There's always a party somewhere round the way - oh yeah

Boys and girls, go
Find yo friends
Ladies and gentlemen
Call your partners
Let them feel this time
Of year again
Don't be scared to shout
Come on and move yo
Body lets all get down
Tap yo feet to the beat
Come on and party with me

It's a pretty hot day and all I want to do is play with the homies from
Around the way okay!
