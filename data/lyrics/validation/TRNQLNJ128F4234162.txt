Let's break the ice
I can feel the heat
Let's get together
Let's get together

Let's not talk, honey
Let's just start
Here's a message to you
From my private parts

Got no money
All I got is heart
Let me in, let me in
Let me in

Whisper/touch
Tender/cruel
Whisper/touch

There is a love
Without a name
But a kiss is a kiss
Is a kiss is a...

In a certain place
In a certain way
Let me in
Let me in

Whisper/touch
Tender/cruel
