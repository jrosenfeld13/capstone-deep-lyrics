Lately things been coming on real nice
I must admit it's a kind 'o surprise
But it feels real nice
I have been thinking about a ring
Me and my baby, we just got through this thing
Now ain't nothing can come between

Anything can happen - any day now
Remember that

You ain't the man, not the man with the master-plan

I saw it coming in a beautiful dream
Was like nothing else, yet such a familiar theme
And I think I know what it means

I went down the valley, I went on top of the hill
Say I made a little wow, not to rest until
The worried blues lay still

Anything can happen - any day now
Remember that

You ain't the man, not the man with the master-plan nononono

Any day now
Tonight the moon's so bright and you can hear the mockingbird sing
Feel a little mixed up, wondering what tomorrow will bring
But don't worry 'bout a thing
Anything can happen - any day now
Remember that
Another day at break of dawn, find a reson keep movin on

You ain't the man, not the man with the master-plan
