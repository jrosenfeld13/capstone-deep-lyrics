Drivin' downtown
On that crazy summernight
Your sweetest perfume filled the air
And your body moved to the sound
The beat kept spinnin' round and round

Wanderin' downtown
Lovin' till the mornin' light
And then we walked along the lane
And the breeze that played upon your dress
Felt even warmer than before
The look of love was in your eyes
A perfect dream for evermore

Since you went away nights are awfully sad and lonely downtown
Waitin' for the day when somebody comes around
To tell baby's back in town
Your main direction is right
I know your baby's waitin downtown

Headin' downtown
And everything belongs to us
A distant sunset paints the sky
Smoothly shakin' your body around
The beat still spinnin' round and round
The look of love is still in your eyes
The perfect dream for evermore

Since you went away nights are awfully sad and lonely downtown
Waitin' for the day when somebody comes around
To tell (your) baby's back in town

With every beat of my heart
I hope once more you're headin' downtown

Me and my precious baby we're gonna have some fun
Downtown
Me and my precious angel we're gonna hold on tight now
