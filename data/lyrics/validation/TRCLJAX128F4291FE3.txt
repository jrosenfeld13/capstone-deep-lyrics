[Verse 1]
Baby, where do I begin? Yeah
What a beautiful mood I'm in, I'm in
'Cause loving you has really been
One of the most beautiful things, yeah

[Hook]
'Cause I love when, I call you
And I hear you say hello
And I love when, I ask you
Where you at you say you're home
And I love when we are playing
When we are playing all alone
Playing all alone

[Chorus]
These are the best days of my life (my life)
These are the best days of my life (best days of my life)
These are the best days of my life (my life)
These are the best days of my life (best days of my life)
Best days of my life, of my life (best days of my life)
You are the best thing in my life (best days of my life)
Oh, baby (best days of my life)
Best days of my life, yeah, yeah

'Cause making up is a beautiful sound, yeah, yeah
There is no one else around, no
So baby let's go paint the town, yeah

These are the best days of my life (my life)
These are the best days of my life (best days of my life)
These are the best days
These are the best days of my life (my life)
I don't know where to begin
These are the best days of my life (best days of my life)
Oh, baby (best days of my life)
