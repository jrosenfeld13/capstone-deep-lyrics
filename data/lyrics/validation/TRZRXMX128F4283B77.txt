Think, think, think, think

Think of about the sacrifices
That I make for you
Think of all the time
That I spend with you

Think of all the good things
That I done for you
Think of all the bad things
I try not to do
So come on, baby, and

Think, think, think, think
About the good things
Think, think, think, think
About the right things
Think, think, think, think
About the best things
And maybe before you leave me
You'll realize I'm the one
That loves you

How much of all your happiness
Have I really claimed
How many tears have you cried
For which I was to blame

Lord, I can't remember
When it's not my fault
I tried so hard to please you
At least that's what I thought
So come on, sugar, and
