Did you think that it would end up this way?
A single shadow cast in the leading role?
I've got my suitcase by the door packed with secrets you'll never know
We lay down, you said, "Boy, don't ever let me go."
Now I'm writing all the things we couldn't show

Trying not to waste my time tonight
But honey, all the wrong things, they feel so right
I should have said I loved you but I just said
"I understand."

Trying hard to keep my mind occupied
On the road for at least six weeks this time
But satisfaction is the death of desire
Baby I'm not satisfied
I came home with the wood stacked in my arms
And found out you found a new way to keep warm

Trying not to waste my time tonight
Honey, all the wrong things, they feel so right
I should have said I loved you but I just said
"I understand."

Whoa x3

Trying not to waste my time tonight
Honey, all the wrong things, they feel so right
I should have said I loved you but I just said
"I understand."

Trying not to waste my time tonight
Honey all the wrong things feel so right
Should have said I loved you but I just said
"I understand, I understand."
