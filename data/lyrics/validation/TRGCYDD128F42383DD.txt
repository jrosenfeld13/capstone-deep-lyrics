Spin the wheel to the mummer's dance
And bite your thumb to the god of chance
Then the critical monkey self
Will raise a huff and go kill himself

Body and Soul, Amen

Hold back a mob with an empty gun
And turn the tragedy into fun
Take the stand, the graven stone
Yet free from the silence. you're not alone

Body and Soul, Amen

Go where the builders all have failed
And sail the seas that no man has sailed
Or go to church if your conscience wills
Or find your own in the far blue hills
