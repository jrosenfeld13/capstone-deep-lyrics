Everybody let me tell you bout my love
Brought to you by an angel from above
Fully equipped with a lifetime guarantee
Once you try it, I am sure that you'll see

(Without love) There's no reason to live
(Without you) And what would I do with the love I give
(All my lovin') To you I'll be giving
And I promise, yes I'll do, as long as I'm living

I'm thinking of you and the things you do to me
That makes me love you, now I'm living in ecstasy
Hey, it's you and the things you do to me
That makes me love you, now I'm living in ecstasy

All the time he makes me glad that I'm alive
Together we will survive
What do you think brought the sun out today
It's my baby, oh, help me sing

(Without love) Without love there's no reason to live
(Without you) Oh, what would I do with the love I give
(All my lovin') To you I'll be giving
And I promise, yes I'll do, as long as I'm living

That makes me love you, now I'm living in ecstasy
Hey, it's you and the things you do to me
