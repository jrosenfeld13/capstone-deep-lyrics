You know its hard for me to accept
That I will never have you , that you will always have the upper hand
You own my heart
I ain't got much left
So I am forced to find
A dream with worth fighting for
Cause I'll fight tooth and nail
Until I'm dead

And I will fight tooth and nail until I'm dead
Because I am aware, got one life to live why not take a chance

She danced around the room
I just wanted to choke you blue (I wonder if it makes a diffrence)

And I know now that we will never speak

These open eyes, they now see the reality
I only got one life to live
I'm tired of waiting on the stands
Time to put my life back in my hands

Go right ahead and marry the henchmen
And when I show up at your wedding

I'll bring
Flowers
And a shotgun
