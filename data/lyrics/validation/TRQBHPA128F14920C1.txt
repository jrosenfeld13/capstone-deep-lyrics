[Chorus]
There's a hole
In my life
There's a hole
In my life

[Verse 1]
Shadow in my heart
Is tearing me apart
Or maybe it's just something
In my stars

[Chorus]
There's a hole
In my life
There's a hole
In my life

[Verse 2]
Be a happy man
I try the best i can
Or maybe i'm just looking
For too much

[Hook]
There's something missing from my life
Cuts me open like a knife
It leaves me vulnerable
I have this disease
I shake like an incurable
God help me please

[Chorus]
There's a hole
In my life
There's a hole
In my life

[Outro]
Yeah

Yeah
Yeah

[Hook]
There's something missing from my life
Cuts me open like a knife
It leaves me vulnerable
I have this disease
I shake like an incurable
God help me please

[Chours]
Oh, there's a hole
In my life
There's a hole
In my life
There's a hole
In my life
There's a hole
In my life
There's a hole
In my life
There's a hole
In my life
There's a hole
In my life
There's a hole
In my life
There's a hole
In my life
There's a hole
In my life
There's a hole
In my life
There's a hole
In my life
There's a hole
In my life
There's a hole
In my life

In my life
In my life
In my life
In my life
In my life
In my life
