[Verse 1]
Realign all the stars above my head
Warning signs travel far
I drink instead
On my own
Oh, how I've known
The battle scars and worn out beds

[Chorus]
Gentle now a tender breeze blows
Whispers through a Gran Torino
Whistling another tired song
Engines hum and bitter dreams grow
Heart locked in a Gran Torino
It beats a lonely rhythm all night long

[Verse 2]
These streets are old
They shine with the things I've known
And breaks through the trees
Their sparkling

Your world is nothing more than all the tiny things
You've left behind

[Bridge]
So tenderly your story is nothing more than what you see
Or what you've done
Or will become
Standing strong
Do you belong
In your skin
Just wondering

[Chorus]
Gentle now a tender breeze blows
Whispers through a Gran Torino
Whistling another tired song
Engines hum and bitter dreams grow
Heart locked in a Gran Torino
It beats a lonely rhythm all night long

[Verse 3]
May I be so bold and stay
I need someone to hold
That shudders my skin
Their sparkling

Your world is nothing more than all the tiny things
You've left behind

[Verse 4]
So,realign all the stars above my head
Warning signs travel far
I drink instead
On my own
Oh, how I've known
The battle scars and worn out beds

[Chorus]
Gentle now a tender breeze blows
Whispers through a Gran Torino
Whistling another tired song
Engines hum and bitter dreams grow
Heart locked in a Gran Torino
It beats a lonely rhythm all night long

[Outro]
It beats a lonely rhythm
All night long
It beats a lonely rhythm
All night long
