Take my hand
We're leaving
It's easy
Understand
I need you
To see this

I've found the answer
It's somewhere else 'cause
I can see
The view from here
All we've planned is
There for us

I was gone a long time
Frightened
Being me gets harder
Each day

And I can see
The view from here
All we've planned is
Here now

Take my hand
We're leaving
Now
Understand
I need you
To be there

I've found
The answer
I can see
The view from here
All we've planned
Is very near
I was gone a long time
Frightened
All we've planned
Is here now
