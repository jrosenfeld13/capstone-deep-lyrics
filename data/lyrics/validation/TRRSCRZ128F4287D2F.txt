So many things I never said
All those regrets and broken promises
Would it have mattered if I had
Told you everything I felt
Admitted I was scared of losing you
Would you have understood?

Remember when you said, you'd wait forever
And I thought it was true
And as my broken heart just keeps on beating
I'll send this letters home to you
'cause I don't know what else to do
I wait for you

I guess it's been seven weeks
And I still got you on my mind
When will I find my way back
To where we were, when I left
The tape you send my pillows drenched with tears
Confirmed my worst fears
