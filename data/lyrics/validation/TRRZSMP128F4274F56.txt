Come on little light you know my name
It's only going to break you in the end
Nothing you can say could make it right
Only in the way of what you know

Come on to the floor your brittle bones
Don't be a fool
Don't let me go

And we danced in the dark on the stairs
Like the people had pushed us out the room

Come on little light you stupid thing
It's only going to hurt you in the end
Nothing you could say could make it right
Only in the way of what you know

Come on to the floor your brittle bones
Don't be a fool
Don't let me go

And we danced in the dark on the stairs
Like the people had pushed us out the room
And we kissed on the crowded stairs
Like we didn't know anyone was there

It's nothing
It's nothing
It is nothing

Oh home
Down, down, down we go

And we danced in the dark on the stairs
Like we didn't know anyone was there

It's nothing
It is
It is nothing
Oh yeah

Oh home
Down, down, down we go

And we kissed in the dark on the stairs
And we kissed on the empty stairs
