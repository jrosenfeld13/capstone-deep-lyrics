Am I allowed to breathe
Am I allowed to counter
Words that don't believe
And words that don't matter
And soon I'll sigh
And forget them all
Only sometimes
Am I allowed..... Breathe

And someone should have told me
That you would be here
But you weren't you anymore
You weren't you...

But you will, you will, you will, you...

Soon I will fall like the wall

And how it feels will be horror
Do you hate it?
'Cause you weren't you anymore
You weren't...

But you will, you will, you will, you...

Soon I will fall like the wall

All around fractured view of life
I tear down all these idols
And I'll make my transformation
You'll feel better..... Right?

But you will, you will, you will, you...

You can't scar me... You can't
You can't scar me... You can't

How the fuck does it feel?

Soon I will fall like the wall

And how the fuck does it feel?
And how the fuck did you figure?
