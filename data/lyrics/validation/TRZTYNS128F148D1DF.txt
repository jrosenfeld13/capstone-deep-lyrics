This world is not my home, I'm just a passing through
My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue
The angels beckon me from heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore

Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like you
If heaven's not my home then Lord, what will I do?
The angels beckon me from heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore

Just up on heaven's shore we'll live eternally
Well, the saints on every hand are gonna be shouting 'Victory'
Their songs of sweetest sound we'll sing for ever more
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore

Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like you
If heaven's not my home then Lord, what will I do?
The angels beckon me from heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore

Just up on heaven's shore we'll live eternally
Well, the saints on every hand are gonna be shouting 'Victory'
Their songs of sweetest sound we'll sing for ever more
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore

Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like you
If heaven's not my home then Lord, what will I do?
The angels beckon me from heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore
