[Verse 1]
Tonight we lie awake
Remember how the coffee made us shake
On those long drives?
One more long night
Another seven days
Heartbeat racing, the interstate
My home, tonight
One more long night

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sure as Hell the happiest I've ever been

[Chorus]
We get high, we let go
We've got more than we know
My friends are a different breed
My friends are...

[Verse 2]
There's a ghost in this room
I think I'll name it after all of you
And watch it hang over my bed
Like decorations, celebrated
Memories, they came and went
In light of all the time we spent
Listening to everything
Our parents told us not to take in
Now make a change
I'm counting down
The mile marks to every town
And falling more in love
With the distance put between us

[Chorus]
We get high, we let go
We've got more than we know
My friends are a different breed
My friends are everything
Make this last, take it slow
We've got it all figured out for now
So let us live our lives without a doubt

[Verse 1]
Tonight we lie awake
Remember how the coffee made us shake
On those long drives?
One more long night
Another seven days
Heartbeat racing, the interstate
My home, tonight
One more long night

[Bridge]
From coast to coast, I'll make the most
Of every second I've been giving with this crowd
Without a doubt, you're all I dream about
At night we lie awake with stories taking us back to
The nights we felt alive
The nights we felt alive

[Outro]
I would've married you in Vegas
Had you given me the chance to say, "I do."
Couldn't make it anymore obvious, could you?
Be anymore obvious
I would've married you in Vegas
Had you given me the chance to say, "I do."
Couldn't make it anymore obvious, could you?
Be anymore obvious, could you?
