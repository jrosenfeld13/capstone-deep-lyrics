We spent the night in the hall
Staring floor
Just waiting
For birds to come back
It doesn't work anymore
Bug's in the core
And whatever will be coming back
Be trouble all around
But far above the ground
Love survives
In dreaming of the past
Oh why oh why
We're crashing all our plans?
Oh why oh why
We're trashin all our plans?

I bet you are a good guide
As a consequence of your smiles
I bet you are a good guide
But the concierge is going wild

A baseball hat and a ball
Trapped in the hall
Just waiting
For birds to come back
It doesn't work anymore
Bug's in the core
We're all getting like funny wrecks
Happy like clowns
With children all around
Love survives
In dreaming of the past
Oh why oh why
We're crashing all our plans?
Oh why oh why
We're trashing all our plans?
I bet you are a good guide
As a consequence of your smiles
I bet you are a good guide
But the concierge is going wild
I bet you are a good guide
I bet you are a good guide
I bet you are a good guide
I bet you are a good guy
In a bind
