Ohh myyyy
20 throw down in my fist of rage
And the man to my left has folded down
Well johnny doubled up with a royal flush
I had three jacks and a pair of nines
My mind is turning - just two shots more
There's not much left to play
Well then dude walks in, black hat on top, what a mop
I'm lucky wasn't a county cop cause i'm just runnin out of time

Who's up for game two
What to do
My wallet's gettin thin
And i just lost my watch last night
Well i gotta problem
Just one answer
Gotta throw it all down
And kiss it goodbye
Yeah!

That was a crazy game of poker
(That was a crazy game of poker)
I lost it all
(I lost it all)
But someday i'll be back again
And I, never to fall
Never to fall

Who's up for game three
I can barely see the bourbon drowning next to me
And i just lost it all
Well there's a man sittin next to me
Red with smiling eyes
Its funny
I don't have no money tonight
Yeaaaaaaaahhhhhhh

That was a crazy game of poker
(That was a crazy game of poker)
I lost it all
(I lost it all)
But someday i'll be back again
And I, never to fold
(never to fold)

Bop bop bop...
I say now skittleedat dat
Well how bout that?
I'm coming out the front never coming out the back

And I walked into the bar yesterday
Cause I had something to do, something to say
And Johnny walked in right behind me and I didn't turn around
'Til I heard the sound of his feet falling on the ground
I looked over my shoulder and I saw a clown
And I said what'cha doin' in the bar tonight

So I said Johnny whatcha doing tonight?
He looked at me with a face full of fright
And I said, how bout a revolution?
And he said right
I say of, you all say a
I say revolution, and you all say jah
I say of, you all say a
I say revolution, and you all say jah jah jah
Jehovah!

And I said, what'cha looking at?
He hit me across the face with a bat
I grabbed my .45 and I said let's get out and go
So he opened the door and said do what you're here for
I said I'm wandering round the road 44
And I said I been walking for about a thousand years

And my feet are growing tired
My eyes a little wired
Don't know what to do unless I retire
And he just said let's play some crazy poker

So I said Johnny whatcha doing tonight?
He looked at me with a face full of fright
And I said, how bout a revolution?
And he said right
I say of, you all say a
I say revolution, and you all say jah
I say of, you all say a
I say revolution, and you all say jah jah jah
Jehovah!

I said that, was the craziest game of poker that I ever saw
I said that, was the craziest game of poker that I ever saw
But I'm not gonna quit and I'm not gonna stop
Don't give a shit cause I got the drop
Johnny just got two eyes just like mine
And I'm feeling kinda funky, kinda fine

And I drank a bottle of whiskey, 'fore I came
Came to the bar to see what's the same
I saw my man named Johnny sittin' across the table from me

And to my left was a man, he had no gin
He Didn't really think about starting to sin
The man to my right wasn't feeling kinda nice
He looked kinda mad and I felt bad
Beacuse I took his money last night it's kinda funny
But now I'm just struggling--
I need a honey-bunny
I don't know what to say anymore
So I'm just gonna go out, anyho!

So I said Johnny whatcha doing tonight?
He looked at me with a face full of fright
And I said, how bout a revolution?
And he said right
I say of, you all say a
I say revolution, and you all say jah
I say of, you all say a
I say revolution, and you all say jah
I say of, you all say a
I say revolution, and you all say jah
I say of, you all say a
I say revolution, and you all say jah
