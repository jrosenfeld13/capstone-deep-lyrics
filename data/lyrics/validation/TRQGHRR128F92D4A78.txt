You've been looking all your life
To find a place to hide
To cover up the hurt
And the sorrow in your cry
All the choices that we make
And the chances that we take
Define you in the end
But your heart's about to break
These five words I pray
You would find your way
So you will always have
That one more day

(Chorus)
Can you tell me what you're waiting for?
Tell me what you're looking for
Waiting on forever
Forever starts now
Can you tell me what it's all about?
Tell me why you live in doubt
Waiting on forever
Forever starts now

You've been wasting all your time
Asking yourself why
No matter what you find
You're running out of time
(Don't waste another day)
There's exceptions to the rule
You don't have to play the fool
You don't have to run and hide
Or justify your lies
So reach inside yourself
Take the bitterness you've held
Leave it all behind
The clock starts now

(Chorus)
What're you waitin' for? (3x)
The clock starts now!

(Chorus)
Waiting on forever
Forever starts now

Waiting of forever
