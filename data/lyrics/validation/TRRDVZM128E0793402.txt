[Verse 1]
I've been talking to myself again
Not communicating anything
It's a never ending fallacy
That you have always been so good to me
When I'm trying to explain it all
You are making me uncomfortable
Take a little piece of honesty
And be the man you always promised me
And be the man you always promised me

[Chorus]
I said that I would never leave
But now I cannot breathe
I said that I would let you know
But I'm not letting go
I've tried to make you understand
Now I've done all I can
It's time to make my final move
'Cause I'm not happy

[Verse 2]
I've been talking to myself again
Making sure that I am listening
I'm developing an attitude
It pushes me towards my solitude

[Chorus]
I said that I would never leave
But now I cannot breathe
I said that I would let you know
But I'm not letting go
I've tried to make you understand
Now I've done all I can
It's time to make my final move
'Cause I'm not happy

[Bridge]
I never thought it could happen
I never thought it could be
I never wanted to be here
I never wanted to see
I never wanted to see

[Chorus]
I said that I would never leave
But now I cannot breathe
I said that I would let you know
But I'm not letting go
I've tried to make you understand
Now I've done all I can
It's time to make my final move
'Cause I'm not happy
