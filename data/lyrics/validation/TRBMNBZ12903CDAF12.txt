(C.)
I got hell, can't you see
I got hell, written all over me

(1.)
Riding with the living dead I'm riding high I'm riding free, yeah
The thoughts that fill up my head are wicked and obscene
So if you're riding with me, your riding damned, free from the grace of god
Demoneyes yeah deamonlife, see with my eyes and keep yours shut

(2.)
We all have beasts that dwell within, and I have set mine free
I've let loose my devil spree, to fill the emptiness in me
I've sold my soul to a carnal ghoul, the devil? I've shaked his hand
I sold my soul and then time takes its toll, forever I stay damned

(REPEAT C.)

(3.)
Burning as I feel the flames getting higher, will I become a victim of my own desires
Still I'm more then satisfied, with my life, yeah the life of the wild side
As you carry on your pathetic existence, I'll be my own god and master
And I'll keep on spitting on your beliefs, and I'll keep laughing at your chosen one

(REPEAT C. x3)

(4.)
Riding with the living dead I'm riding high I'm riding free, yeah
The thoughts that fill up my head are wicked and obscene
I've sold my soul to a carnal ghoul, the devil? I've shaked his hand
I sold my soul to rock'n'roll, forever I stay damned

(REPEAT C.)
