Sometimes you have to encourage yourself
Sometimes you have to speak victory during the test
And no matter how you feel speak the word and you will be healed
Speak over yourself encourage yourself in the lord
(repeat)

Ohohoh sometimes you have to speak a word over yourself
Depression is all around but god is a present help
Well the enemy created walls but remember giants they do fall
Speak over yourself encourage yourself in the lord...

Oh as I minister to you oh I minster to myself
Life can have you so till you feel there's nothing left oh
No matter how you feel speak a word(over your life) and you(you) will be healed
Speak over your self x 4
(ad lib: sometimes you got to look in the mirror and tell your self I can make it
You gotta remember that life and death lies in the power of your own tongue
Even if nobody tells you you can run on you tell yourself
You gotta remember I more then a conqueror)
I'm encouraged x 4
(ad lib: greater is he that's in me
I believe everything that the lord said about me
Everything that the enemy ever told me its a lie its a lie its a lie yeah yeah yeah )
I'm encouraged I'm encouraged I'm encouraged I'm encouraged
I'm encouraged x 4
(ad libs: i......
I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills
All of my help all of my help comes from the lord
Yeah I believe I believe everything he said about me)
I'm encouraged I'm encouraged I'm encouraged I'm encouraged
I'm encouraged x4
(ad libs: I believe I'm gonna run on I'm gonna run on and see what the ends gone be
I know something better is out there waiting for me
I believe everything the lord asid about me)
Speak over yourself encourage yourself in the lord oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
