Haven't you noticed
A breakdown in the family tie
Just not as strong as it once was
Every time I see it weaken, it makes me want to cry

Oh, what a shame [Oh, what a shame]
'Cause another home's falling apart
Oh, what a shame [Oh ,what a shame]
Another group of broken hearts

It's not a secret
We all know that it's slipping away
Don't let it go, no, don't you let it go
It is the only true foundation on which we can survive

Don't be afraid [Don't be afraid]
'Cause you got to take it for a stand
Don't be afraid [Don't be afraid]
You've got to try to understand

Bring the family back, bring it back together
Bring the family back
Bring the family back, bring it back together
Together

Bring the family back, bring it back together
Bring the family back

There's also the children
The future's quickly comin' their way
How it will be
Oh, tell me how do you think it will be

Will they all join hands together and live in harmony

Oh, what a shame [Oh, what a shame]
If we don't get together fast
Oh what a shame [Oh what a shame]
How much longer will the whole thing last

Bring the family back, bring 'em back together
Bring the family back
Bring the family back, bring the family back and together

Bring the family back and live in harmony
Bring the family back
Bring back family unity

Bring the family back, bring 'em back together
Bring the family back
Bring the family back together, bring 'em family back
Bring 'em back together

Bring the family back and live in harmony
Bring the family back
Bring the family back, where's the unity
Bring the family back

Bring the old folks, the young folks, and all folks together
Just bring the people back
Bring the family back [Bring the family back, bring it back together]
[Bring the family back]

Bring the family back
Bring the family back
Bring the family back
Bring it all the time together

Bring the family back together [Bring the family back, bring it back
Together]
[Bring the family back]
[Bring the family back, bring it back together]
[Bring the family back]

[Bring the family back]
