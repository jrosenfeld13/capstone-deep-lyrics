We stand at the crossroads with holes in our hands
For all those crucified, forgotten fatherlands
I kissed your forehead, I kissed your lips
I dreamed of four girls for an apocalypse

But one day, someday, for you and me
An angel with talons will set us free

We drove through the mist, to a house by a lake
And waited in the garden for D'Annunzio to wake

And we stand at the crossroads with holes in our hands
For all those crucified, betrayed, lost motherlands

Behind the soft words of liars and fools
You're either the ruler or you're the ruled
The fuse has been lit, the sacrifice bled
And nature's deciding we are more use to her dead

Chorus

On the ledge of a cliff, hanging onto rosary beads
My wrists are aching and my fingers do bleed
Below me there's flies and disease
But above me the light and the breeze

And we stand at the crossroads with holes in our hands
For all those brutalized, genocide, paranoid lands

They're cutting up corpses, putting them into sacks
And blood in the moonlight looks ever so black
You pick wild flowers, dream of love and respect
In this world of the noose, the knife and the rack

Chorus
