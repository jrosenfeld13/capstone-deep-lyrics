Good vibes, bad vibes - dance on the ocean;
Man-made insanity's holding me down
Good vibes, bad vibes - a way of locomotion;
I can show you, show you all around
Blue light, red light - drink a magic potion;
One-track eternity's making me frown
Blue light, red light - bitter, sweet emotion;
Won't you send me way up the underground?
Hold tight, uptight waiting for the sunlight
All my enemies are watching me drown
Hold tight, uptight - I'm on the wrong side
I'm on camp site waiting on a silver cloud
Good vibes, bad vibes - dance on the ocean;
Man-made insanity's holding me down
Good vibes, bad vibes - a way of locomotion;
I can show you, show you all around
