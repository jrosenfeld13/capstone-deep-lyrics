DeVille

Every night when I go to sleep
That's when I begin to weep
Not again, oh no, not again
Now every time that I hear her name
I feel that sadness return again
Not again, oh no, not again
Now I don't want to cry
I don't want to cry
That river of tears
That river of tears
I don't want to cry (2x)
That river of tears (2x)
Now every night lonely empty dreams
Here comes that tide, washing over me
Not again, oh no, not again
I don't want to cry (2x)
That river of tears (2x)
I don't want to cry
