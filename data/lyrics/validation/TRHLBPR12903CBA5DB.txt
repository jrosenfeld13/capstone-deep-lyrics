My First Night With You
Performed by deborah cox

Yesterday was not just another day
Not like before
Yesterday i saw your smiling face
Love walked through my door

One precious moment changed my life
One tender kiss made everything alright
One touch from you and this world was mine
It was in your arms where i found forever

Cried my first tears of joy last night
Heaven shined a light
All my dreams came true
My first night with you

Felt the sun shine so bright on me
Chased the rain from my heart
Through a storm, through the darkest night
I found my brightest star

One magic moment made one magic night
I fell in love with one look in your eyes
I never knew i could feel so alive
Darling, in your arms i could feel forever

Hook

Do you get lonely (ooh i get lonely)
Thinking about you me (thinking about you)
Am i the only (girl i dream of or think of at all)
Are you into me
Outta your mind for me
Say you can't go a day without me
