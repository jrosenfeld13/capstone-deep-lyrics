[Verse 1]
On a plane, somewhere over the sea
Above the rain, the bottle sets me free
I turn to stone, fall back in my seat
The cuts are gone but somehow I'm still bleeding

[Chorus]
You know it's true there's nothing I can do
You know it's true there's nothing I can do
You know it's true there's nothing I can do about you

[Verse 2]
Move to France, La Rochelle or Nice
Get a house, pretend to live in peace
Paint the walls, a blackout of your face
Stalk the halls, then move into the basement

[Chorus]
You know it's true there's nothing I can do
You know it's true there's nothing I can do
Pick a fight, it's just you being right
Walk away, there's nothing I can say
You know it's true there's nothing I can do about you

[Bridge]
So don't you mind the gap when you leave
There'll be time enough to turn tail tomorrow
Don't you mind the gap when you leave

[Verse 3]
Broken up, like a tanker on the rocks
Not made of much, I'm like the Cubs against the Sox
On a plane, somewhere over the sea
I fall asleep convinced that I ain't breathing

[Chorus]
You know it's true there's nothing I can do
You know it's true there's nothing I can do
Pick a fight, it's just you being right
Walk away, there's nothing I can say
You know it's true
There's nothing I can do about you

[Bridge]
So don't you mind the gap when you leave
There'll be time enough to turn tail tomorrow
Don't you mind the gap when you leave
