Can you hear them talking 'bout us?
Telling lies, is that a surprise
Can you see them? See right through them
They have a shield, nothing must be revealed
It doesn't matter what they say
No one listens anyway
Our lips are sealed
There's a weapon that we can use
In our defense, silence
Well, just look at them, look right through them
That's when they disappear, that's when we lose the fear
It doesn't matter what they say
In the jealous games people play
Our lips are sealed
It doesn't matter what they say
No one's listening anyway
Our lips are sealed
Hush, my darling, don't you cry
Guardian angel, forget their lies
Can you hear them talking 'bout us?
Telling lies, well, that's not surprise
Can you see them? See right through them
They have a shield, nothing must be revealed
It doesn't matter what they say
In the jealous games people play
Our lips are sealed
Pay no mind to what they say
It doesn't matter anyway
Our lips are sealed
Our lips are sealed
Our lips are sealed
