Well, I know what I'm thinkin'
Is the direct result of drinkin'
In a heavy mix of intimate atmosphere
And I pray what I'm feelin'
Is insecurity revealin'
Lack of happiness
Cause I need a body here
And I would be much safer honey
If I could get this stuff for money

(Chorus)
Cause I'm hooked on love
I never ever felt like this before
If you tell me this is love
I better find a good supplier
I simply got to have some more

I was happy without it
Hardly ever thought about it
Thought that it was something
That I could live without
And now I am a victim
Of the dangerous addiction
Tried to keep it a secret
But the word got out
And I try hard to take it easy
But I've got to find some face to please me

(Chorus)
And now I am a victim
Of the dangerous addiction
Tried to keep it a secret
But the word got out
And I would feel much better about it
If I thought I stood some chance without it
