It's so cold inside on this summer night
Black clouds in the sky dancing before my eyes
I'm losing track of time

It's the eye of the witch
It's the eye of the witch

Thunder bring the rain, penetrate my brain
I am no more the same, that special night has come
Losing track of time

It's the eye of the witch
The eye.. the eye.. the eye
Guitar solo ANDY, Guitar solo PETE
Another glass of wine to heat blood mine
And as I look inside the necklace called "The Eye"
I'm going back in time

It's the eye of the witch
It's the eye of the witch
The eye.. the eye.. the eye
