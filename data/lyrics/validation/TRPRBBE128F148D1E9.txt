I was mindin my business like a good girl should
A little too careful for my own good
It was just like living life in the dark
'Till somethin jumped up and it grabbed my heart

I found love (I found love)
I found love (I found real love)
I found real love (I found love)
I found love (I found real love)

The beginning and end of every wish
Is balanced in the center of a vision like this
Maybe my emotions are inclined
To surrender to the notion of a glorious kind

I found love (I found love)
I found love (I found real love)
I found real love (I found love)
I found love (I found real love)

One touch, souls speak
The power's got me and it won't let me be
It's too much, this heat
I wanna laugh, cry, jump for joy, shout and scream
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

At the end of every tunnel there's a shining light, oh yeah
In the heart of every storm there's a quiet night
My joy was hidden in a dream
I didn't know that it was there until you set me free

I found love (I found love)
I found love (I found real love)
I found real love (I found love)
I found love (I found real love
