You keep me spinnin' around
(round, round, round, round, round, round, round)

Here we go!

I was thinkin 'bout it yesterday
I was thinkin about tomorrow
In a dizzy kinda sorta way, like vertigo
I was tryin' hard to figure out, but it's driven me crazy, well you'd think I know by now

A is last (oh yeah) Z is first
Livin' life in reverse, yes that's the way it works

(chrous)
Spinnin around, I've got this funny feeling
Iurnin' my whole world up-side-down
I'll keep my heart, my eyes on you
Cuz you keep me spinnin around!

What we're doin doesn't have a sequel, don't wanna lose your balance
Oh, you know you gotta keep your equilibrium
Goin' back to the forward, all these definite maybes
Its like runnin' aroung in circles

Make it last (oh yeah) take it slow
Just forget what you know, yes that's the way it goes

(repeat chorus)
Every now and then I feel your peacefullness surround me
Then once again it all goes up and down and over under 'round and around

Go, go, go, jump, jump, go, go, go, J5
Spinnin' around!
(oh yeah, yeah)
Upside down!
(oh yeah, yeah)
J5 in the house (hey) jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump

Turnin', turnin' upside down (down) spinnin' spinnin', spinnin' me around ('round)
Go, jump, go, jump, go, jump, go, jump
Spinnin' around, that's the way it works
Take it slow and not so fast (fast) Z is first and A is last (last)
Up and down all around (hey hey)
Turnin' my whole world upside down!

Oh yeah, it's not the take, it's the give
Yes that's the way okay, the way it is

(repeat chorus twice)
