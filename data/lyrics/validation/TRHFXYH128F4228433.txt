She comes to you from the dark abyss
She knows how to ease your pain
Five inch heels and her black leather boots
She makes you moan and scream
She takes control and you're on your knees
You're hungry for her flesh
She's the mother of mercy, the mother of night
The mistress of taboo
Oh, mistress of taboo

She's got a velvet glove with an iron hand
She's good enough to eat
Her skin's so hot you burn yourself
You worship at her feet
Kiss the boot and open the gate
The boiling rivers flow
She's the mother of mercy, the mother of night
The mistress of taboo
Oh, mistress of taboo

Slave of passion
Void of reason
Slave of passion
