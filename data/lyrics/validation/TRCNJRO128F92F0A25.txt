[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
I make the most of all this stress
I try to live without regrets
But I'm about to break a sweat
I'm freaking out
It's like a poison in my brain
It's like a fog that blurs the sane
It's like a vine you can't untangle
I'm freaking out

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Every time I turn around
Something don't feel right

[Chorus 1: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Just might be paranoid
I'm avoiding the lines 'cause they just might split
Can someone stop the noise?
I don't know what it is, but it just don't fit
I'm paranoid
Yeah!

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
I take the necessary steps
To get some air into my chest
I'm taking all the doctor's meds
I'm still freaking out
That's why my ex is still my ex
I never trust a word she says
I'm running all the background checks
And she's freakin' out

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Every time I turn around
Something's just not right

[Chorus 2: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Just might be paranoid
I'm avoiding the lines 'cause they just might split
Can someone stop the noise?
I don't know what it is, but it just don't fit
Consider me destroyed (consider me destroyed)
I don't know how to act, 'cause I lost my head
I must be paranoid (I must be paranoid)
And I never thought it would come to this
I'm paranoid

[Bridge: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
Stuck in a room of staring faces, yeah!
Caught in a nightmare, can't wake up
If you hear my cry
Running through the streets
I'm about to freak
Come and rescue me

[Chorus 2: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Just might be paranoid (might be paranoid)
I'm avoiding the lines, 'cause they just might split
Can someone stop the noise? (Can someone stop the noise?)
I don't know what it is, but it just don't fit
Consider me destroyed (consider me destroyed)
I don't know how to act, 'cause I lost my head
Oh, I must be paranoid (must be paranoid)
I never thought it would come to this
I'm paranoid
