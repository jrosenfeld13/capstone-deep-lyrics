There's somethin' happenin' here
What it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun, over there
Tellin' me I got to beware

(I think it's time we)
Stop, hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look. What's goin' down?

There's battle lines bein' drawn
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong
Young people speakin' their minds, once again
Gettin' so much resistance from behind

(It's time we)
Stop, hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look. What's goin' down?

What a field day for the heat
A thousand people standin' out in the street
Singin' songs and carryin' their signs
They're mostly sayin', "hooray for our side"

(It's time we)
Stop, hey, what's that sound?
Everybody look. What's goin' down?

I hear ya

Paranoia strikes deep
Into your life it will creep
It starts when you're always afraid
Step out of line, the man come and take you away

(Now then)
Stop, hey, what's that sound?
You got to stop and take a look around
(Now, now)
Stop, hey, what's that sound?
We got to stop and take a look around

(We got to)
Stop, hey, what's that sound?
Look what's goin' down?
