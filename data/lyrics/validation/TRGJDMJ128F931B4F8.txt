Here comes that feeling I've seen in your eyes
Back in the old days, before the hard times
But I'm not afraid anymore
It's only a broken heart

I know the place where you keep your secrets
Out of the sunshine, down in a valley
But I'm not afraid anymore
It's only a broken heart

What would I give, to start all over again
To clean up my mistakes

Stand in the moonlight, stand under heaven
Wait for an answer, hold out forever
But don't be afraid anymore
It's only a broken heart

(Bridge)

I know your weakness, you've seen my dark side
The end of the rainbow is always a long ride
But I'm not afraid anymore
