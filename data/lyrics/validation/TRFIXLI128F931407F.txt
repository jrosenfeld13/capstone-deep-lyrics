[Verse 1]
I left my heart
In San Fransisco
High up on a hill
It calls to me
To be where little cable cars
Climb halfway to the stars
The mornin' fog, mornin' fog
It more than chills the air, chill the air
But I don't care
I don't care
My love waits there
As I cross this globe
Above the blue
I went to see
Why I come back
Oh to see, San Francisco

[Bridge]
Your golden sun, golden sun
Shine on thee, come on thee
Ba-da-da-da-dum-dey

[Interlude: Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I left my heart
Down in 'Frisco
High up on a hilltop, hilltop
It calls to me
To be, to be, to be, to be
Where little cable cars
Climb halfway to the stars
The morning' fog
Is gonna chill, gonna chill, chill the air, but I don't care
My love is there
Mhmmm, San Francisco
High 'bove the blue
I went to see
When I come back, when I come back
To you, San Fransisco

[Outro]
Your golden sun
Shine on me, shine on me
Go, golden sun
California
California, here I come
