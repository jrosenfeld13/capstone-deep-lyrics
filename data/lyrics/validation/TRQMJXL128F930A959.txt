Fell

Well, I stopped at a road house in Texas
A little place called Hamburger Dan's
Heard that old jukebox start playin'
A tune called the truck drivin' man

The waitress then brought me up some coffee
I thanked her then called her again
I said that old song sure does fit me
Cause I'm a truck drivin' man

Pour me another cup of coffee
For it is the best in the land
And put a nickel in the jukebox
And play the Truck Drivin' Man

Well, I climbed back aboard my old semi
And then like a flash I was gone
I got them old truck wheels a rollin'
Now, I'm on my way to San Antone

When I get my call up to glory
They will take me away from this land
I'll head this truck up to heaven
Cause' I'm a Truck Drivin' Man

Pour me another cup of coffee
For it is the best in the land
I'll put a nickel in the jukebox
And play that Truck Drivin' Man
And play that Truck Drivin' Man
