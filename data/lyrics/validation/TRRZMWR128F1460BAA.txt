[Verse 1: Billy Preston]
Come bring me your softness
Comfort me through all this madness
Woman, don't you know? With you I'm born again

[Verse 2: Syreeta]
Come give me your sweetness
Now there's you, there is no weakness
Lying safe within your arms, I'm born again

[Pre-Chorus: Billy Preston & Syreeta]
I was half, not whole
In step with none
Reaching through this world
In need of one

[Chorus: Billy Preston & Syreeta]
Come show me your kindness
In your arms I know I'll find this
Woman, don't you know? With you I'm born again
Lying safe with you I'm born again

[Verse 1: Billy Preston]
Come bring me your softness
Comfort me through all this madness
Woman, don't you know? With you I'm born again

[Verse 2: Billy Preston & Syreeta]
Come give me your sweetness
Now there's you, there is no weakness
Now there's you, there is no weakness
Lying safe within your arms, I'm born again
Woman, don't you know? With you I'm born again

[Pre-Chorus: Billy Preston & Syreeta]
I was half, not whole
In step with none
Reaching through this world
In need of one

[Chorus: Billy Preston & Syreeta]
Come show me your kindness
In your arms I know I'll find this
Woman, don't you know? With you I'm born again
Lying safe with you I'm born again
