I like it spooky

Don't ever change
I like it spooky
Zombies eating brains
I like it spooky
Serial killers and the insane
I like it spooky
Angry ghosts rattling chains
I like it spooky

"Do you ever fantasize about being killed
Do you ever wonder
About all the different ways to die?
I like it spooky"

I love the night
I like it spooky
Werewolves and their bites
I like it spooky
Skeletons laughing at your fright
I like it spooky
A black witch in green light
I like it spooky

"Do you ever fantasize about being killed
Do you ever wonder
About all the different ways to die?
You know, violently?"
