Get busy!

[Refrain]
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live
I don't need permission
Make my own decisions
That's my prerogative

[Verse 1]
They say I'm crazy, I really don't care
That's my prerogative
They say I'm nasty, but I don't give a damn
Getting girls is how I live
Some ask me questions, "Why am I so real?"
But they don't understand me or really don't know the deal
About a brother, trying hard to make it right
Not long ago, before I win this fight (sing)

[Refrain]
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live
I don't need permission
Make my own decisions
That's my prerogative

[Hook]
It's the way that I wanna live (It's my prerogative)
I can do just what I feel (It's my prerogative)
No one can tell me what to do (It's my prerogative)
'Cause what I'm doing
I'm doing for you, now

[Verse 2]
Don't get me wrong, I'm really not souped
Ego trips is not my thing
All these strange relationships really gets me down
I see nothing wrong with spreading myself around (sing)

[Refrain]
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live
I don't need permission
Make my own decisions
That's my prerogative

[Hook]
I can do what I wanna do (It's my prerogative)
Can live my life (It's my prerogative)
I'm doing it just for you (It's my prerogative)
Tell me, tell me

[Bridge]
Why can't I live my life (Live my life)
Without all of the things that people say

[Interlude]
Yo Teddy, kick it like this
Oh, no, no
I can do what I wanna do
Me and you
Together, together, together, together, together

[Refrain]
Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live
I don't need permission
Make my own decisions
That's my prerogative

Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live
I don't need permission
Make my own decisions
That's my prerogative
