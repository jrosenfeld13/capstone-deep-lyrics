Nothing`s gonna stop me now
Nothing`s gonna stop me now

[Verse 1:]
There was a time
I couldn't get you out of my mind
And since the day you came
You tried to take control of me

Then came the day
I thought about running away
And now my bags are packed
Don't even think of holding me back

[Chorus:]
Nothing's gonna stop me now
And I don`t wanna talk it over
I said nothing`s gonna stop me now

Gonna break it up
Gonna take my love away
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2:]
Day after day
I started slipping away
You took my self respect
And you made a fool of me

Time after time
I turned it round in my mind
And now my mind`s made up
To leave the past behind me

Time after time
I turned it round in my mind
And now my mind`s made up
To leave the past behind me

Nothing`s gonna stop me now
Nothing`s gonna stop me now

There was a time
I couldn't get you out of my mind
And since the day you came
Tou tried to take control of me

Then came the day
I thought about running away
And now my bags are packed
Don't even think of holding me back

[Repeat Chorus:]

Day after day
I started slipping away
You took my self respect
And you made a fool of me

Time after time
I turned it round in my mind
And now my mind`s made up
To leave the past behind me

Time after time
I turned it round in my mind
And now my mind`s made up
To leave the past behind me
