After all these years
After all these tears between us
Still I couldn't find
Someone half as right as you
And each time I stop to think
What it is I truly need
Here's what I conclude
All I really need is you

Just say what you want to say
You don't have a chance in the world
Can I, knowin' how I've tried
Still come close to losing you, girl
When you are my world

Have I, spent these many years
Tryin' but in vain to tell you
Don't you know it too?
All I really need is you

How could I have known
We'd have ended here
Where we finally did?
You hooked your life to mine
Once upon a starry night

Now when someone asks of me
What it is that I believe
Say, I believe it's true
All I really need is you

Just say what you want to say
You don't have a chance in the world
Can I, knowin' how I've tried
Still come close to losing you girl
When you are my world
Have I spent these many years
Tryin' but in vain to tell you

Feelings come and go
Me, I'm never gonna
Ever let you go
Promise you I'm gonna
Always love you so
And all I really need is you
