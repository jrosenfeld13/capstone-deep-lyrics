I can't hide the way I feel inside
I just gotta say it's you makes me feel this way
So come with me, we'll take a walk down by the sea
From now on you'll be the only girl for me
We got no time for things gone by
For foolish tears we cried
I can't hide

You can't hide the way you feel for me
I can read your eyes and I like what I see
It's there so plain, it's just for you my love is free
Hold me close now girl and keep on lovin' me
We can't stop now to think about the past
We're moving too fast

Yesterday my life was filled with pain
But now it's changed, we'll never be the same
We're together now
We can never say goodbye
I can't hide, I can't hide, I can't hide
