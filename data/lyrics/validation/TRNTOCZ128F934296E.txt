November has come
To Long Island
And with it we've all packed in my father's car like a can of sardines

Everybody was there
Even Uncle Alvin
With Cats on the F.M., and Billy Joel in the back of the car

Well, speed up, slow down
I can drive faster than you can
And if you drink too many sodas then you will not fall asleep tonight

No family members left behind
Everybody's watching out for everyone else
But you, you drank too much of the wine
And now you've got a headache as big and deep as Niagra Falls

Well, look at the Statue of Liberty
I cannot believe that we went there. And if you are sorely mistaken
You gotta shake what you're coming for

With the Sanka can at the backdoor
And the Carvel cake on the counter, and you were walking quickly around her
