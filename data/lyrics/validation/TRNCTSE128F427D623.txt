I been north, I been east
To the California beaches
There's only one place I know where to find you
And you Southern girls get a way with your words and you show it

You say hump and I'll jump
You say go and I know
Waste no time gettin' so close to you
And you remember the way to find out that I wanted to thank you

Ooh, baby needs some brand new shoes
You get out on the street, you got nothing to lose
I feel your crazy and everyone says it
Southern girls, you got nothing to lose

I've been up, I've been down
I've been weak, I've been strong
But I've never met someone like you
And you'll never know that if I found you I'd thank you

You say hump and I'll jump
You say go and I know
Waste no time gettin so close to you
And all you Southern girls got a way with your words and you show it

Ooh, baby needs some brand new shoes
You get out on the street, you got nothing to lose
I feel your crazy and everyone says it
Southern girls, you got nothing to lose
Southern girls, you got nothing to lose

You might think this boy loves you, Southern girl
You make it hard, oh so hard

I been north, I been east
To the California beaches
There's only one place I know where to find you
And you Southern girls got a way with your words and you show it

Ooh, baby needs some brand new shoes
You get out on the street, you got nothing to lose
I feel your crazy and everyone says it, yeah yeah
Southern girls, you got nothing to lose, yeah
Southern girls, you got nothing to lose

Southern girls
Southern girls
Southern girls
