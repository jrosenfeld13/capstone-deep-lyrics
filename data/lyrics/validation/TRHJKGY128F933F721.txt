I was born one rainy morning in a little house across town
Daddy liked to roam leave Mama alone
She just couldn't tie him down
He liked his gamblin and whiskey
And mama just liked to cook and sew
It made me a man before my time
I felt many a cold wind blow

Worked real hard most all of my life
Bought a farmhouse out in the sticks
Set by the fire most every night
Working on my guitar licks
Before too long I was on my way
Playing from town to town
I guess I'm a little like Daddy was
Gotta keep on moving around

Chorus:
This journey takes me far away from home
Sometimes it makes me feel so alone
So alone

Now I look back on yesterday
Wondering what I'd done
Did I help somebody along the way
Or did I just look out for number one
I know I can't change a thing
So don't put me down
Cause I didn't cling to your heart
Oh I feel like dying when we're apart

Chorus:
This journey takes me far away from home
With nothing left to hold on to
But a voice from the telephone
It's taken me away from every love I've ever known
Sometimes it makes me feel so alone
So alone
