She's gone
And I'm gonna find her
It's been so long
Yeah I'm gonna find her
She's gone away
When it goes away
I'll dig a hole *4
Wasted and I'm out of patience
It's been so long
Yeah I'm out of patience
She's gone away
Pain goes away
I dig a hole *4
Runnin', goin' out at night
Friends they push and pull you
Burn out ground poor flowers
Spinning falling outta time
When it goes away
I'll dig a hole *4
La la la la, ooh
I'll dig a hole
La la la la, ooh
When it goes away
La la la la, ooh
I dig a hole
La la la la, ooh
Pain goes away
