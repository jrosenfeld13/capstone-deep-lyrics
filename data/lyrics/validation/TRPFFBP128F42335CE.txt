Look here girls, take this advice, and remember always in life

Into each heart, some tears must fall
Though you love and loose, you must stand tall
'Cause we all got to cry sometimes, I said, sigh sometimes
Pull yourself together, no use crying forever

Because there's too many fish in the sea
Too many fish in the sea
I said, there's short ones, tall ones, fine ones, kind ones
Too many fish in the sea

My mama once told me something and every word is true
Don't waste your time on a fella who doesn't love you
He'll only mislead you, only grieve you
Don't worry about him baby, you can do it without him

Because there's too many fish in the sea
Too many fish in the sea
I said, there's short ones, tall ones, fine ones, kind ones
Too many fish in the sea

Well, if that fish isn't on your line
Bait your hook and keep on trying
You don't let him get you down
There's other boys around

There's too many fish in the sea
Too many fish in the sea
I said, there's short ones, tall ones, fine ones, kind ones
Too many fish in the sea

I don't want nobody that don't want me
Too many fish in the sea
Ain't gonna love nobody that don't love me now
Too many fish in the sea

I don't need nobody that don't need me
Too many fish in the sea
I don't want nobody that don't want me now
Too many fish in the sea

Ain't gonna love nobody that don't love me?
Too many fish in the sea
Ain't gonna love nobody that don't love me now?
Too many fish in the sea

I don't want nobody that don't want me?
Too many fish in the sea
I don't want nobody that don't want me
Too many fish in the, too many fish in the sea
