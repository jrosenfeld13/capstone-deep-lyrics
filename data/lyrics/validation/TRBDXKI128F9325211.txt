One more young writer slid away in the night
Over the border he will drown in light
Hold it, wait a minute
I can't read my writing, my own writing
Like tiny insects in the palm of history
A domino effect in a cloud of mystery
My writing is an iron fist
In a glove full of Vaseline
But dip the fuse in the kerosene
I too become a dissident

Courting disaster we ran in the night
Wings of an angel were torn in flight
Check it, verify it
It's all here in writing, down in writing
At the hands of the press
And in the eyes of the government
I fell from grace
I too became a dissident
Like tiny insects in the palm of history
A domino effect and an early end to this story
My writing is an iron fist
In a glove full of Vaseline
But dip the fuse in the kerosene
I too become a dissident
