[Verse 1]
I woke up today with this feeling
That better things are coming my way
And if the sunshine has a meaning
It's telling me not to let things get in my way

[Pre-Chorus]
When the rainy days are dying
Gotta keep on, keep on trying
All the bees and birds are flying (ahh ahh ahh)
Never let go, gotta hold on in
Non-stop 'til the break of dawn and
Keep movin' don't stop rockin' (ahh ahh ahh)

[Chorus]
Get on up when you're down
Baby, take a better look around
I know it's not much, but it's okay
We'll keep on moving anyway

[Verse 1]
Feels like I should be screaming
Tryna get it through to my friends, uh
Sometimes it feels like life has no meaning
But I know things will be alright in the end

[Pre-Chorus]
When the rainy days are dying
Gotta keep on, keep on trying
All the bees and birds are flying (ahh ahh ahh)
Never let go, gotta hold on in
Non-stop 'til the break of dawn and
Keep movin' don't stop rockin' (ahh ahh ahh)

[Chorus]
Get on up when you're down
Baby, take a better look around
I know it's not much, but it's okay
We'll keep on moving anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
When the rainy days are dying
Gotta keep on, keep on trying
All the bees and birds are flying (ahh ahh ahh)
Never let go, gotta hold on in
Non-stop 'til the break of dawn and
Keep movin' don't stop rockin' (ahh ahh ahh)

[Chorus]
Get on up when you're down
Baby, take a better look around
I know it's not much, but it's okay
We'll keep on moving anyway
Get on up when you're down (keep on movin')
Baby, take a better look around (keep on movin')
I know it's not much, but it's okay (keep on movin')
We'll keep on moving anyway (keep on movin')
Get on up (keep on movin')
(Keep on movin')
(Keep on movin')
I know it's not much (keep on movin')
(Keep on movin')
(Keep on movin')
Get on up (keep on movin')
(Keep on movin')
(Keep on movin')
