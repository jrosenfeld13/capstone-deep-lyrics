From old Montana down to Alabam I've been before and I'll travel again
You triflin' women can't keep a good man down
You dealt the cards but you missed a play so hit the road and be on your way
Gonna board the Golden Rocket and leave this town
[ guitar ]
Well hear her thunder on through the night this Golden Rocket is doin' me right
And that sunny southland sure is a part of me
From your call board earse my name
Your fire went out you done lost your flames
And this Golden Rocket is gonna roll my blues away

Yeah I was a good engine a runnin' on time but baby I'm switchin' to another line
So honey never hang your signal out for me
I'm tired of runnin' on the same old track
Bought a one way ticket and I won't be back
This Golden Rocket's gonna blow my blues away
[ guitar ]
Well hear her thunder...
