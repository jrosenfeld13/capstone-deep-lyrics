She said "Face your fears and come with me
Take a chance and take my hand so you can see
Everything you know you'll never have
Everything you know you want but fate killed your plans"

Fill this hole inside of me
I can't stand the ache, this pain is killing me
Those who have suffered will understand
That pain is welcome when it's all you have left

Come and die with me
Let's see what we can't be
Come and die with me
Now is our chance to know how it feels to be free

I'm alone but not alone
You're welcome here but we're on our own
It's the test we were bound to fail
I've watched the strongest crumble, and seen their weakness prevail

The give and take, the grip and strain, the hopeless sincerity
We played and lost or so it appears to me
To be that way
I can't hold this smile, I can't hide this pain

Come and die with me
Let's see what we can't be
Come and die with me
Now is our chance to know how it feels to be free

I'm in search of a second opinion
A way to escape this situation
The list of wrongs I write no-one can read
I know the scars are shared but we can never speak

Holding on, holding in
The ache lulls and then I'll see you again
It's a pain I'd never trade for anything
I can smile outside, I can smile and say I'm all right
I'm all right
I'm all right

The give and take, the grip and strain, the hopeless sincerity
We played and lost or so it appears to me
To be that way
I'm always praying for things that will never change

Come and die with me
Let's see what we can't be
Come and die with me
Now is our chance to know how it feels to be free

So free from all this shit
I'm not content alone and not pleased with your distance
Come and die with me
Now is our chance to know how it feels to be free
