This is my time
This is my show
I fight the ocean
Searching my soul

And i'm alive
I am
I am alive

I'm a thousand suns
Burnt into your mind
I'm a battle won
I'm the front line

And i'm alive
I am
I am alive

I won't fear what's here tomorrow
Never feed of someones sorrow
I'll never hide in someones shadow
Now i feel alright

I can build this now
Etch my name in time
I can feel this now
This is my time

I'm alive
I am
I am alive
I am
I am alive
I am
I am alive
I am
I am alive
