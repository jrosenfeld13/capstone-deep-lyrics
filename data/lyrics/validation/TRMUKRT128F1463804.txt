And if it's all right with you
I'll just talk with myself
I never was the one to believe in magic

And with a light shining down on you
You sure look tragic too
And if it's all right with you
I'll just talk with myself

With all the stars so bright and the light shine down
And everything glows all around
And a wonder world and a perfect time for loving
And when it all gets hard and it all gets tough
And everything won't be enough
Were gonna throw a stone in it and it'll all come true for loving

And if you just say where and when
Then I will be there waiting
'Cause I would really love to see you again

With the stars so bright and the light shine down
And everything glows all around
And a wonder world and a perfect time for loving
And when it all gets hard and it all gets tough
And everything won't be enough
Were gonna throw a stone in it and it'll all come true for loving

With the stars so bright and the light shine down
And everything glows all around
And a wonder world and a perfect time for loving
And when it all gets hard and it all gets tough
And everything won't be enough
Were gonna throw a stone in it and it'll all come true for loving

I've seen you passing by
And when you caught my eye
I thought 'God this could be the next big thing'
And how I wished for your command
Telling me to hold your hand
Oh baby let it rain

With all the stars so bright and the light shine down
And everything glows all around
And a wonder world and a perfect time for loving
And when it all gets hard and it all gets tough
And everything won't be enough
Were gonna throw a stone in it and it'll all come true for loving yeah

And if you just say where and when
Then I will be there waiting
'Cause I would really love to see you again

Because, with all the stars so bright and the light shine down
And everything glows all around
And a wonder world and a perfect time for loving tonight
And when it all gets hard and it all gets tough
And everything won't be enough
Were gonna throw a stone in it and it'll all come true for loving yeah

With all the stars so bright and the light shine down
And everything glows all around
And a wonder world and a perfect time for loving
And when it all gets hard and it all gets tough
And everything won't be enough
Were gonna throw a stone in it and it'll all come true for loving

I wanna love you baby
I wanna hold you baby
I wanna dance and give you everything you need

And how I wish for your command
To make me twirl upon your hand
Oh baby how you make me bleed

Oh baby don't you know that since I saw you for the first time
Its been like living in this dream
Like a fantasy that just goes on and on forever
And its never real

With the stars so bright and the light shine down
And everything glows all around
And a wonder world and a perfect time for loving tonight
And when it all gets hard and it all gets tough
And everything won't be enough
Were gonna throw a stone in it and it'll all come true for loving
Oh yeah

Oh baby
Oh yeah
Oh oh yeah
When it all gets hard
When it all gets tough
When it all gets
When it all gets
When it all
When it all
