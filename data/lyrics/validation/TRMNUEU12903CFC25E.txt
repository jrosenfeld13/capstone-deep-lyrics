Drifting past old stomping grounds
I can't help reminisce
That's why I came here tonight

Wasting time down the barrel I find
A lonely memory
That's why I came here tonight

Desperately I fight
And I break down

Tell me how this world refused to turn
Back in the day when the air filled the romance
Take me back to that chapter in my life
Back to the days when the air filled the romance

Pints behind I stumble inside a faded scenery
And that's why I drive all night
Taking a ride up the mountain I climb, I've never felt so alive
And That's why I drive all night

Desperately I fight
And I break down

Tell me how this world refused to turn
Back in the day when the air filled the romance
Take me back to that chapter in my life
Back to the days when the air filled the romance

I miss the air from the from the last breath of my purity
I miss the air from the last words you shouted at me
I miss the air from the golden rooftops we sat on
I miss the air from my first love..

Take me back to that chapter in my life
Back to the days when the air filled the romance

Filled the romance, filled the romance
The air filled the romance
