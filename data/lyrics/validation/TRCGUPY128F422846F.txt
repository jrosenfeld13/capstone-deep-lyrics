Come on back to the House of Shame
Blood's burning to play my game now
Racks are roasting, bitches are boasting
With your blood they are toasting
Humiliations your dream
We'll make you laugh and scream
In my torture kitchen
Your body's itchin' for a switchin'
Pain! You can't take this another day
Precious moments without the pain
But you ain't leaving. You're here to stay
Breeds only longing in your brain
You willI needIt's your fucking time to bleed
You will obey everything I say
You will remain while I'm dishing out your pain
Your will is to blame in the House of Shame
Pain in a world with no anatomy
Branded slave, racked and hanging
Only function is pissing and banging
Forced entry breeds a heart full of self-conflicts
But who's to blame for your desire
Problem parents or porno flicks?
You willI needIt's your fucking time to bleed
You will obey everything I say
You will remain while I'm dishing out you pain
You will is to blame on the House of Shame
Pain! You can't take this another day
But you ain't leaving. You're here to stay
Breeds only longing in you brain
Precious moments without the pain
In the House of Shame
Come on back to the House of Shame
Your blood's burning to play our game now
Racks are roasting, Bitches are boasting
With your blood they're toasting
Humiliations your dream
We'll make you laugh and scream
Your body's itchin' for a switchin'
In my torture kitchen
