(verse one)
Its crazy
What keeps going thru my mind
Something is playing with my head (crazy)
How im feeling inside i wish i could see you here instead (baby)
It's so fulfilling oh(the way you give it)
Intimidating (but I)
I want more of it
I'm so tore up 'cause how you give it to me
Got me a sip of hypnomatic
The kiss was the chaser and i ain't mad at it
Followed it up with a little touching
Then the next day i don't remember nothing
Baby i'm hungover
Dizzy cause you got to my head
Wish you were here instead
Hungover can't focus on what i got to do can't stop thinking bout you
Baby i'm hungover can't even think bout the song
The list goes on and on
Hungover baby you got me twisted
Hungover baby i'm so sick baby i'm...

(verse two)
It's crazy
What i felt the first time
Can;t even find the words to say (crazy)
I think that i'm gonna try cause i don't take you for granted oh no (baby)
It's so fulfiling (the way you give it)
Intimidating (but I)
I want more it i'm so messed up cause how you give it to me

(chorus)
Got me a sip of hypnomatic
The kiss was the chaser and i ain't mad at it
Followed it up with a little touching
Then the next day i don't remember nothing
Baby i'm hungover
Dizzy cause you got to my head
Wish you were here instead
Hungover can't focus on what i got to do can't stop thinking bout you
Baby i'm hungover can't even think bout the song
The list goes on and on
Hungover baby you got me twisted
Hungover baby i'm so sick baby i'm...

(bridge)
Dizzy out of my brain

I want you baby, i want you baby, i want you baby
Dizzy out of my brain
I'm goin insane
Can't maintain i'm fellin crazy
I want you baby, i want you baby, i want you baby

(chorus)
Got me a sip of hypnomatic
The kiss was the chaser and i ain't mad at it
Followed it up with a little touching
Then the next day i don't remember nothing
Baby i'm hungover
Dizzy cause you got to my head
Wish you were here instead
Hungover can't focus on what i got to do can't stop thinking bout you
Baby i'm hungover can't even think bout the song
The list goes on and on
Hungover baby you got me twisted
Hungover baby i'm so sick baby i'm..
