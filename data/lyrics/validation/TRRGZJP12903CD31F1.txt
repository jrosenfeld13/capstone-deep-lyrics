Far away from nothing
Dark sky's what i see
I hear the wind
It's coming
Stirring on the trees

At first it was a whisper
A secret of the lakes
And bittering I dream of pain
Once falling on the streets

This is the rage of heaven
The answer to my prayer
The storm will sing my song tonight
The song of my despair

I hear the howling creatures
Smell passion in the air
The storm will sing my song tonight
The song of my despair

As windows start to shatter
I kiss the breaking pain
There is no cover, little lover
From thunder, wind and rain

This is our judgement day
The day to say farewell
The sinners prey
It's Time to pay
And most will burn in hell

This is the rage of heaven
The answer to my prayer
The storm will sing my song tonight
The song of my despair

I hear the howling creatures
Smell passion in the air
The storm will sing my song tonight
The song of my despair
