(Bob McDill)

Well the day it ends when the sun comes up
And it starts when the sun goes down
Out on the backroads and on the back streets
Of every farm and factory town
There in the world of weekly wage
There's always a place out there
And the names and the faces are the same everywhere

Well the room is full it's a Friday night
We all wanna hear Louie Louie
Been a long hard day and a long hard life
And this is how we make it through it
It's a blue collar place a red blooded crowd
Tonight everything's all right
In honky tonk America

There's a flashing sign on a rain soaked street
That lights up just about dark
A welcome beacon on life's highway
When your weary and when you lost heart
Never say its loneliness
It's only the drinks and the band
But something brings us back here again and again

Well the room is full it's a Friday night
We all wanna hear Proud Mary
Been a long hard day and a long hard life
We all got our crosses to carry
It's a blue collar place a red blooded crowd
Tonight everything's all right
In honky tonk America

Well talk about freedom alright but maybe some other time
Tonight everyone's feeling fine

Well the room is full it's a Friday night
We all wanna hear Wolly Bully
Been a long hard day and a long hard life
Monday morning well all do our duty
It's a blue collar place a red blooded crowd
Tonight everything's all right
In honky tonk America

Honky tonk America
Honky tonk America
Honky tonk America
Honky tonk America
