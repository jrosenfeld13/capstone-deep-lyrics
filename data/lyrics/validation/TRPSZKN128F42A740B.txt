To be, to be free again
To be, to be free again
To be, to be free again
To be, to be free again

It is the night
My body's weak
I'm on the run
No time to sleep
I've got to ride
Ride like the wind
To be free again

It is the night
My body's weak
I'm on the run
No time to sleep
I've got to ride
Ride like the wind
To be free again

To be, to be free again
To be, to be free again
To be, to be free again
To be, to be free again

It is the night
My body's weak
I'm on the run
No time to sleep
I've got to ride
Ride like the wind
To be free again
To be free again

And I got such a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind

It is the night
It is the night
It is the night
Night, night, night, night

It is the night
My body's weak
I'm on the run
No time to sleep
I've got to ride
Ride like the wind
To be free again
(To be free again)

It is the night
My body's weak
I'm on the run
No time to sleep
I've got to ride
Ride like the wind
To be free again

It is the night
My body's weak
I'm on the run
No time to sleep
I've got to ride
Ride like the wind
(Ride like the wind)
