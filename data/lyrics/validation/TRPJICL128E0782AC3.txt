You weightless astronaut
You sunset diving bird
You're cool wind set upon the branches of a tree
You're holding my attention
You are my first impression
And I can recognise the light that I've been given

One day they will discover you
Low cloud moving across the sky
One day they will uncover you
Young girl
Wash the sleet out of your eye

Dust on my piano
Wool rest never sleeping
All your best one-liners borrowed from a film
The thing that gets to me is
How you're never free, and
How the spirit yearns
Your body is a prison

One day they will discover you
Low cloud moving across the sky
One day they will uncover you

The thing that gets to me
Is how you're never free
And how the spirit yearns
Your body is a prison

Bright as her eyes
Wide in the night
Why can't you see me?
Come with the wind
Time to begin
There'll be no compromise
When all you want is wrapped around you
As those saints preserve us when we're dying
To pick us up from where we're lying
One day they will discover you
One day they will uncover you
Bright as her eyes
Wide in the night
They will discover you
They will discover you
