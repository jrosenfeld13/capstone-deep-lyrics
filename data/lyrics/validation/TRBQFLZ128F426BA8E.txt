Money in my pocket but I just can't get no love
Money in my pocket but I just can't get no love
I'm praying for
A girl to be my own

Soon you said she coming but I don't believe a word she say
Cause she run away and left me one rainy day
She made me had in mind
That her love would never die
And now I'm alone, so alone
So alone, yeah, yeah

Money in my pocket but I just can't get no love
Money in my pocket but I just can't get no love
The love I had in mind
Was very, very hard to find

It's hard for a man to live without a woman
And a woman needs a man to cling to
You'll see what love can do
After making me feel blue
Ain't that a shame, whoa baby
Ain't that a shame
To make me feel blue

I've got money in my pocket
