He fills the room like champagne
Into an empty glass
As they slither to him like snakes
Through the grass
His stance is quiet with grace
Before they throw him into the rat race

And he turned to me to say
I'm a lonely boy
Even with the life I asked for

Chorus:
Lonely boy, why don't you see
You're exactly the same as me
You could be the most beautiful thing
That I ever did see
With your head pointing down
And your friends leaving town

He sung like an angel
That had cracked deep inside
While I played my guitar
And cried and cried
And the nails that we jam into our hearts
Are essential and needed for the part

And he turned to me to say I'm a lot like you
Does that mean, boy, I'll be lonely too?

[Chorus]
Days are passing like November rain
Constantly falling
But nothing here remains

And he turned to me to say, I'm a lot like you
Does that mean, boy, I'll be lonely too?

[Chorus]
You're home getting high every day
Don't you think it's strange?

[Chorus]
