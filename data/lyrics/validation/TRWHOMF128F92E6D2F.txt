Everything comes falling
Like the leafs fall from a trees natural progression
Everything comes falling
Like the rain falls when gods cry for our salvation
Ride through endless sin
To the mountains of despair
Break through all the things you couldn't do
Suffer inside, everyday living a lie
Cleansed by those feelings you try to deny
Everything comes falling
Like tears flow from a soul full of sorrow
Everything comes falling
Like blood drops from a bruised aching heart
Fly to the bludgeon sky
Look at terror's eyes
Embrace the full aura
That will consume your everything
Abandon your destiny to reach uncertainty
With nothing left to see you fade away
Gone... are all the feelings
That battle has just begun
Die before I fall...
My kingdom stands tall
Bleed... my fatal blade
The rupture has just commenced
Die before I fall...
My kingdom stands tall
Ride through endless sin
To the mountains of despair
Break through all the things you couldn't do
Suffer inside, everyday living a lie
Cleansed by those feelings you try to deny
