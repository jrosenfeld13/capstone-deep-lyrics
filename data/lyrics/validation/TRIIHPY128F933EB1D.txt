The world is growing loud
It's time for us to fade
To grey
I wish they'll let us stay

The lights are going out
We knew we had to go
One day
I wish they'll take us in

The skies are falling down
Too late for us to change
Our minds
I wish they'll keep us safe

The times are changing fast
We knew we wouldn't last
This long
I hope they'll keep the pace

The world is growing loud
It's time for us to fade
Away
I wish they'll let us stay
