I just came back from a trip along the Milky Way
I stopped off at the North Pole to spend the holiday
I called on old dear Santa Claus to see what I could see
He took me to his workshop and told his plans to me
Now Santa is a busy man he has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas Day
You better write your letter now and mail it right away
Because he's getting ready his reindeers and his sleigh
You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
He's making a list and checkin' it twice
He's gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh, you better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Little tin horns, little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Curly head dolls that cuddle and coo
Elephants, boats and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
The kids in girl and boyland
Will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a toyland
All around the Christmas tree
So you better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
