[Verse 1]
Top of the world, bottom of the ocean
Top of the world, bottom of the ocean
They built you up and broke you down again
So now you hope to be pacific

[Chorus]
'Cause the future is not what you've seen
It's not where you've been to at all
The future is not what you've seen
It's not where you've been to at all
The future is not what it used to be, used to be
The future is not what it used to be, used to be

[Verse 2]
Top of the world, bottom of the ocean
Top of the world, bottom of the ocean
They lit you up and found the ground again
So now you know to be pacific

[Chorus]
'Cause the future is not what you've seen
It's not where you've been to at all
The future is not what you've seen
It's not where you've been to at all
The future is not what it used to be, used to be
The future is not what it used to be, used to be

[Bridge]
They buried the gold, your ancestry's sold and left
Just the residue
They buried the gold, your ancestry's sold and left
Just the mist of you
They buried the gold, your ancestry's sold and left
Just the residue
They buried the gold, your ancestry's sold and left
Just the mist of you
Now, what's happened to you?
Look what's happened to you
What's happened to you?

[Verse 3]
Now that spring is finally here
Your hollow heart, your hollow heart
Drive through the forest and into the night
Away from the city, away from the light
Hollow heart, your hollow heart, you know
And we're worlds apart
And we're worlds apart

[Verse 4]
They gouge you out, they dug you in
They took the name right out of your mouth
Hollow heart, your hollow heart, you know
Worlds apart
And we're worlds apart

[Outro]
Into yourself, past of it
Into yourself, past of it
Into yourself, past of it
Into yourself, past of it
Into yourself, into yourself
Into yourself, into yourself
Into yourself, into yourself
