Verse 1: I said put yourself in my shoes. You know I hate to lose. Would you stick around and get your heart broken? She said I don't want you to go. She said I don't want you to go. 'Cause you know you can't hide away. You will need me. you will need me

Chorus: I've got island fever. Need to be holding her again. I've got island fever. I keep remembering. She said those lazy tropical breezes won't blow that moon away. Why didn't I believe her? I've got island fever

Verse 2: My solitude is wearing thin. My tiny world is closing in. And I can't get her words out of my head. She said I don't want you to go. She said I don't want you to go. 'Cause you know you can't hide away. You will need me. You will need me
Repeat Chorus

Bridge: I swear I'm not giving in. I'm over it now. I tell you I'm digging in. I'm over it now
