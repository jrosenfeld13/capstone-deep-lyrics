Some say a trick, some say a look
It's just a way of thinking after all
From underneath something concrete
It's just a way of coping, coping with it all
Some with revolt, some will obey
Who attains perfection and who's to say
A criminal or a cardinal
They're both frightened of angels
It doesn't mean much now
It's built for the future

For some a walk, to some a dance
It's just a form of motion one and all
Without dispute the least aware
Will no doubt see the ragings of a fool
First we look then we spy
The man who has a vision wants it all
A sin so clean rule supreme
The power to undermine
It doesn't mean much now
It's built for the future
It doesn't mean much now
It's built for the future
It doesn't mean much now
Build it up, build it up for the future

Some say a trick, some say a look
Some say a trick, some say...

First a glance, then a chance
To make a simple gesture worth it all
A conquer all, a desert stall
That serves a drink to people under the sun
At last the place, now where's the time
To take in all the other points of view
Some are inert but one exists
To build a bridge
It doesn't mean much now
It's built for the future
It doesn't mean much now
It's built for the future
It doesn't mean much now
So build it, build it up, for the future
It doesn't mean much now
Some will revolt, some will obey
(Built for the future)
Who attains perfection, and who's to say
It doesn't mean much now
So build it up, build it up, built for the future
It doesn't mean much now
A criminal, a cardinal
(Built for the future)
Both frightened of angels
It doesn't mean much now
So build it, build it up
Built for the future
It doesn't mean much now...
