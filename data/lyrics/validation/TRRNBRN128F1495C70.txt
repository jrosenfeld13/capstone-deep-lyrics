Softly glowing
Watch the river flowing
Its reflections
Shine into my eyes
I see clearer
When you hold the mirror
We can reach the stars up in the sky tonight

All around the universe
You're looking down
I know You're watching over me

La Luna  is it a mild case of madness?
La Luna  You take me out of the darkness

Move on  I tried to
But I'm lost without you
You're my guide, my light
I'm there when you call

So hold me closer
Till the dance is over
On a night like this
Don't ever let me go

All around the universe
You're looking down
I know You're taking care of me

La Luna  is it a mild case of madness?
La Luna  You take me out of the darkness

Till the night is gone  don't ever let me go
Till the night is gone  don't ever let me go
Don't let me go
Until the day is dawning  let me dance
Until I can no more
