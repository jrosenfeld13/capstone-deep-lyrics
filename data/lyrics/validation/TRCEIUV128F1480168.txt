I am unbreakable but it looks like I could sometime soon
And you are unreachable about as possible as me touching the moon

I am unraveling unbearably empty
And if this ground gives way I just hope that you'll catch me

You came and saved me tonight
Defending all my life
Whoa, now I'm content with my breath cuz I'm alive

And this is the epitome of everything you see in the movies
And this world is a time bomb ticking and I think I can stop it if you help me

I am unraveling unbearably empty and if this ground gives way I just hope that you'll catch me

You came and saved me tonight
Defending all my life
Whoa, now I'm content with my breath cuz I'm alive

My faith will never rust
No longer to prone bust
Oh finally I believe...

You came and saved me tonight
Defending all my life
Now I'm content with my breath

You came and saved me tonight
Defending all my life
Now I'm content with my breath
Cuz I'm alive

Cuz I'm alive...
