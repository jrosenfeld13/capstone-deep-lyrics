Let my spirit ride on a one way mule
Blistered skin in a cold hearted pool
Distant emotion hides a concrete wall
Naked and anchored
I'll climb right back to you

Love me for my mind
Cause I'm a dangerous heart
When I've got time to kill
I'm coming back to you

Distant memories in a cage by my bed
Viscid dreams stick to holes in my head
But a patient career of sleep in a Sunday dress
Rides my wake

And love me for my mind
Cause I'm a dangerous heart
When I've got time to kill
I'm coming back to you
I'll stake out just to find
The knife in the dangerous heart
When I've got time to kill
I'm coming back for you

And love me for my mind
Cause I'm a dangerous heart
When I've got time to kill
I'm coming back for you
I'll stake out just to find
The knife in a in a dangerous heart
When I've got time to kill
I'm coming back to you
To you
To you, yeah
To you
