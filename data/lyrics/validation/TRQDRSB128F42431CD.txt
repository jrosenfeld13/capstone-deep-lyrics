Just look at the world...falling down around you
Are we really doing all we can do
Wasted lives, no jobs, no money, just scars
Ever think we would take it all this far

Look at the world coming down around you
Look at the world see it's gone to far
You got Jesus watching from above
If you think a change can't wait, that's a lie

Look at the world Christ what a scene
Got us living on dope and gasoline
Got us believing all he twisted lies
Time to wake up...time to realize
