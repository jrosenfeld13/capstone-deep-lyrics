(Harlan Howard - Tompall Glaser)

I sold the farm to take me woman
Where she longed to be
We left our kin and all our friends
Back there in Tennessee
I bought the one way tickets
She had often begged me for
And they took us to the streets of Baltimore

Bridge
1) (1st Section)
Well my heart was filled with laughter
When I saw those city lights
She said the prettiest place on earth
Was Baltimore at night
2) (2nd Section)
Well, a man feels proud to give his woman
What she's longing for
And I kind of liked the streets of Baltimore

I got myself a factory job
I ran an old machine
We bought a little cottage
In a neighborhood serene
But every night when I came home
With every muscle sore
She would drag me through the streets of Baltimore

Bridge
1) (1st Section)
Well, I did my best to bring her back
To what she used to be
But, I soon learned she loved those bright lights
Much more than she loves me
2) (2nd Section)
Now I'm goin' back on that same train
That brought me here before
While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore
