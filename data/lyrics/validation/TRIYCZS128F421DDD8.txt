Got to pull this timber 'fore the sun goes down
Get it cross the river 'fore the boss comes 'round
Drag it down that dusty road
Come on, Jerry, let's dump this load

Hollerin' timber
Lord, this timber's gotta roll
Hollerin' timber
Lord, this timber's gotta roll

My old Jerry was an Arkansas mule
Been everywhere and he ain't no fool
Weighed nine hundred and twenty-two
Done everything a poor mule could do

Hollerin' timber
Lord, this timber's gotta roll
Hollerin' timber
Lord, this timber's gotta roll

Jerry's old shoulder was six foot tall
Pulled more timber than a freight can haul
Work got heavy, old Jerry got sore
Pulled so much he wouldn't pull no more

Hollerin' timber
Lord, this timber's gotta roll
Hollerin' timber
Lord, this timber's gotta roll

Boss hit Jerry and made him jump
Jerry reared up and kicked the boss in the rump
Now my old Jerry was a good old mule
If it had-a been me I'd-a killed that fool

The boss he tried to shoot my Jerry in the head
Jerry ducked the bullet and stomped him dead
Stomped that boss till I wanted to scream
Should have killed him 'cause he's so damn mean

Hollerin' timber
Lord, this timber's gotta roll
Hollerin' timber
Lord, this timber's gotta roll
Lord, this timber's gotta roll
Lord, this timber's gotta roll
