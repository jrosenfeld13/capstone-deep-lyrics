Melancholy Polly spills her guts on stage
She can't get her jollies any other way
Safe inside the music and the melody
Polly gets to lose it and no one can see

She is not a starlet with a red guitar
Just an easy target for a broken heart
Peddling her story up there all alone
Is another allegory carved in stone

She would ransom her fate
If she had some escape
But her words are a curse
Every rhyme every line and verse

In front of the footlights Polly takes a bow
Waves and says her goodnight to the drunken crowd
When the house is clapping she knows what it means
Her life only happens for a song to sing
