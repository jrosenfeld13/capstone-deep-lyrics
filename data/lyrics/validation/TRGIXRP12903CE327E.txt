Sugar, skulls and marigolds
Flowers, thorns and blood
Say a prayer for each of us
Beneath the dust and mud

Everyday is the day of the dead
Everyday is the day of the dead

Thirsty ghosts and twisted bones
Petitions, shrines and feasts
Say a prayer for each of us
Whose souls have been released?

Everyday is the day of the dead
Everyday is the day of the dead

[Incomprehensible]

Banned saints and sweet dry bread
Candles, masks and bells
Say a prayer for each of us
Was put in heaven or in hell

Everyday is the day of the dead
Everyday is the day of the dead
Everyday is the day of the dead
