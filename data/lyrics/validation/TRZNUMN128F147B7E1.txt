Oh, well, well, well, well, well
Well, we're looking at the cover
We're spending all our time just staring at the magazine
Well, look who's on the cover, wasting all our time
Some pseudo fascist hero machine
Well, that's no space for a human being
That man is not a hero or saint
When somewhere in deepest America
Grown men weep at the sound of his name
So it goes

And it goes
All the girls named Gloria sing sweetly out of key
The sun rose in the west today
Accidents in the land of the free

Oh, well, well, well, well, well
Well, I grew up where they showed you the body count
In color on your dinner TV
And I've been numbed so insensitive
That all I can think about is you and me
You know, children from the best homes
They all have 'guns and butter'
They have their share of 'murder blue'
Well, it's not such a wiggy awesome good time
When the shopping mall militia point their cannons at you
So it goes

All the girls named Gloria sing sweetly out of key
The sun rose in the west today
Accidents in the land of the free
I love this world harder in my imagination
Than my conscience should allow
But, accidents do happen
Accidents will happen
Don't you dare to ask me how


Now everyone believes in
The stories about the Cadillacs
Everybody's got enough to eat
And people always keep their eyes glued to the ground
When desperate men, he's gotta cling to the streets
And I swear, "Myself, I will help them. I will be an upstanding man."
Well, when I walk by and I hear them cry
That money just sticks to my hand
What's wrong with me?

All the girls named Gloria sing sweetly out of key
The sun rose in the west today
Accidents in the land of the free
I love this world harder in my imagination
Than my conscience should allow
But, accidents do happen
Accidents will happen
Don't you dare to ask me how
On and on it goes
All the girls named Gloria sing sweetly out of key
The sun rose in the west today
Accidents in the land of the free
