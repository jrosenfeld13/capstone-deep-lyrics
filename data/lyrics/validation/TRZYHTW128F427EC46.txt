After we go to sleep
Our sun rise
I will make it the truth
Of painfully helping me
Cover up things
I wish I never had found
Confident
Tangled up
In a nice life
Put the spider in you
Watching in
Disregard
You live a nice life
With the spider in you
I saved myself for someone somewhere's sweet caress
Something goes wrong
And all I sought was happiness
And so
In right-wing fashion
We'll nurture xenophobia
And be strong
In right-wing fashion
With paste and generosity
Because no one is safe
From someone somewhere's sweet embrace
And so I have simply decided to dislike you now
