Sever the ties and bury the hatchet
Keep looking away 'cause there's nothing left to see in here

Baby but we're all but innocent
Baby I thought it was true what they all say
Baby shame's a gift for someone else
How come it shines all day how come it shines all night

You better fall you better get up you better get drunk
You better lie you better love you better do better
You better cry you better laught you better shut up
You better sink you better swim you better do better
You better look you better see you better close your eyes, love
You better love you better stay you better stay here with me
You better search you better sense but you better not
You better listen you better talk you better do better
