She's not home
I knew she'd have to go
I could have done more
Should have nailed myself 'cross the door

And say
Now leave me
Now leave me
If it's easy

She's upped and gone
She put her boots back on
And I've left the sneck on
Should've put my fist through the lock

And say
Now leave me
Now leave me
If it's easy
If it's easy

She's not home
Somehow I knew she'd 've gone
But how come I feel wrong when I know
She can do what she wants
She can do what she wants
She can do what she wants
She can do what she wants
She can do what she wants
