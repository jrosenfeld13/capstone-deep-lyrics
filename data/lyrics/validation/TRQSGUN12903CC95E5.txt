Why does it keep coming up? you ask
I want it to go away
It keeps coming between us
And i am tired of turning away
But i'm so angry, so angry
I am so damned scared
Don't leave me here just hold me
Talk about anything i don't care
Talk of tangents talk of tangents anyway you like
Cuz i'm just not gonna get through this baby
It's not gonna happen tonight
Cuz it is all in the timing
And the placement of words
You know i can chase it, i can beat it, i know it's absurd
I just can't face it, can't face it cuz all that i see is a massive blur

Oh yeah....yeah yeah

So it's these women, well they keep coming into my life
And they got the same damn story, and they're linin' in mass strife
But you see they're from a different town
Or they got a different last name
But we got the same lonely friends and the same last name
Cuz it is all in the timing
And the placement of words
You know i can chase it, i can beat it, i know it's absurd
I just can't face it, can't face it cuz all that i see is a massive blur
Oh yeah cuz all that we see...oh all that we see...is a massive blur

So why does it coming up? you ask
I want it to go away
It keeps coming between us and i am tired of turning away
It keeps coming between us and i am tired so tired
It keeps coming between us and i am tired
It keeps coming between us and i am tired so tired
It keeps coming between us and i am tired so tired
It keeps coming between us and i am i am tired of turning away
