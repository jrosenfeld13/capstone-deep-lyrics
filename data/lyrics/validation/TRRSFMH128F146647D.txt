What's happenin' Butterfly, what's happenin'?
What's happenin' Butterfly, what's happenin'?
What's happenin' Butterfly, yeah what's happenin'?
What's up Butterfly, what's happenin'?

If it's swoon I can dig
I peep out the flowers when they bloom, if you dig
Sisters do their dips to our booms cause they dig
Muslims add perfumes and the zoom be a dig
I scoped out as a sprout then Mamma said to dig
The mind then the butt cause the drama ain't to dig
Lovely little honeys in their crews is what I dig
If they fake the fig it's the Blues Child dig
(Want some of my soda?)
Fine they be mega, sexy they be ultra
But don't enroll in pageants to get judged by the chauva's
Crazy fly whips, baggy jeans and sneakers
Silver hoops and Jeeps, hip-hop in the speakers
The gag rule is bunk, it's like chains on the rump
We help to liberate through this butt-shaking funk
Nikki Giovanni and Maya Flamm
With poems so I tried for the units, cause damn

To the gals I am hip
The funky naturals is the ones, are you hip?
If you dis a sis' then you ain't actin' hip
Check Doodle, Silk and Butter cause we be black and hip
Silky like jazz silky beats to move the hip
Milky with pizazz kinda sheik and very hip
The chocolate and the braids and the eyes be so hip
That insects for the units gettin' live gettin' hip
{I think you need a quota!}
The gardens known as cities sprout ferns and tulips
A sexy "hi" followed by requests to do it
When funky duds is drapin' off the curves of a vixen
And fig leaf sugars start to sprout elix 'em
And roll with the lines, damn they be fine
Ask T from the deep, we heard it through the vine
I keep cans of bait for the fishes in aquariums
Boosting me with verve like marine boys aquagum

Run and tell your mom about this

[Doodlebug]
The original swarm whether cold whether warm
I, the Doodlebug Knowledge every form
It's a beautiful day by the park take a seat
As bosoms float by keepin' Doodlebug in heat
Chocolate treats, silky bronze skin
Butter sees what I see and gives me a grin
All is good in the land of the honey-dip lovelies
Don't wanna be 'em just to see 'em
Ow!

[Swoon unit]
Oh that's what's happenin' y'all
Yeah that's what's happenin'
Oh I see what's happenin' now, yeah
I see what's happenin' now Butterfly, yeah...
