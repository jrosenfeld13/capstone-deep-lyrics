[Verse 1]
Sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep
I'm tired and I
I want to go to bed
Sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep
And then leave me alone
Don't try to wake me in the morning
'Cause I will be gone

[Refrain]
Don't feel bad for me
I want you to know
Deep in the cell of my heart
I will feel so glad to go

[Verse 2]
Sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep
I don't want to wake up
On my own anymore
Sing to me
Sing to me
I don't want to wake up
On my own anymore

[Refrain]
Don't feel bad for me
I want you to know
Deep in the cell of my heart
I really want to go

[Verse 3]
There is another world
There is a better world
Well, there must be
Well, there must be
Well, there must be
Well, there must be
Well ...

Bye bye
Bye bye
Bye ...
