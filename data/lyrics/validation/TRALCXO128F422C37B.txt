Over me. Cover me
Deep inside THE FEVER SEA

Lame from my mothers womb
Born a cripple and sick. Under a red moon

My hands bleed. Feet red raw
I'm a broken man who dreamt the great war

The fear of life swallows me
Takes me through THE FEVER SEA
They crawl to me. Cry for me
I'll drown them all in THE FEVER SEA

The feast flows on forever
Devour me until never
Fill them all with horror
Let them sleep with terror
Who calls me now, then turns away?
Who takes the night, and brings day?

Lame from my fathers hand
Born to heal. Heal in every land
I will never get out
I even prayed unto his house

The cold feel of my skin
I try to lose but alwys win

Lame from my own hand
Believe me I've tried. Tried to make a stand
