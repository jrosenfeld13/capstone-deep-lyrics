[Chorus 1]
The rain has washed my dog away again
Closest to a breathing thing I'd call a friend
Hope the next wave brings a valentine

[Verse]
Its been so cold and lonely here
Ever since that cloud appeared
I keep wishing the lamp would shine
Feed me any piece of you
I'll find a way to prop it up alone
Cause I care about the way you stand
But I think you'd look nicer if you had a few bones
Waiting for the tree to cry
Blow a kiss as the mountains wave bye
And the turtles are running free
Blind man has got a whip
It's more fun than that white stick
He bought a carrot, but he still can't see
You know I've waited forty-six years
For a ray of hope to pierce me through
Then I could bleed the sunshine
And wriggle chest high in mountain dew

[Chorus 2]
There's only so much to endure
There's only so much space here on my skewer
Sick of second billing to that magic goat
All I wanna know, baby

[Outro]
Does it float? [x6]
Does it float? [x4]
Why does it float?
Does it float?
