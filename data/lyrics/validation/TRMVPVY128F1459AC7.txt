Divas need love too
Divas need love too

Work to make money
Love to travel the world 'round and 'round, yeah
Say you wanna see me
Break out my appointment book
And put your name down, yeah

Monday's booked
Tuesday's taken
Wednesday got to get my hair done
I just don't have the time, no
Yes, I'm vain
Hard to tame
Blame our past relationship
I need peace of mind

But if you promise me that you won't hurt me
Maybe I'll change my point of view
If you consider all my worldly needs
I'll rearrange my thoughts of you

Because divas need love too
Divas need love too

Alexis Carrington wouldn't give her love to Blake
Without a warning sign, no
So what makes you think that I
Would give my love to you one more time
Not gonna be hurt no more

Now if you promise me that you won't hurt me
Maybe I'll change my point of view
If you consider all my worldly needs
I'll rearrange my thoughts of you

Because divas need love too
Divas need love too

I want the girls to sing for me
Divas need love too, yes

Divas need love too
Let me break it on down

Baby, I know
And I realize and I recognize
The fact that your love is so good
Yes baby, oh baby
Oh baby, ow
But now in order for me to maintain my individuality
I must have complete control of my emotions
'Cause you are not gonna hurt me again baby

But if you promise me that you won't hurt me
I'll change my point of view for you
If you consider all my worldly needs
I'll rearrange my thoughts of you

Because divas need love too
Divas need love too

I want the girls to sing for me
Divas need love too, yes
Divas need love too, yes, we do
Divas need love too
