Been a long time
Since we spoke to an extent
Reflecting on the past
And the roots of intent

With miles on our back
A stranger can attest
It wouldn't hurt nothin
To be warry of rest

Now we run with a new routine
To overcome tryin' times of our scene
The dusty trail that we tread upon
Has now sailed, sent a message far beyond

Embrace
Be humble by temptations that remain steadfast
If you stumble
A momentary lapse will soon be on the path

Falter
In the middle of a dream
Awakening to a hard reality

A diary
Stirring in the blood stream

A planted seed
Slowly surfacing

Open up through the skin
Rip it up and open in
Seal it up to stop the bleed
Open arms to receive

Embrace
Be humble by temptations that remain steadfast
If you stumble
A momentary lapse will soon be on the path

Embrace
Be humble by temptations that remain steadfast
If you stumble
A momentary lapse will soon be on the path
