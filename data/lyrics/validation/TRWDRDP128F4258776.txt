Out of the way, John's coming through and you're next on the shit list
In memory of the man, who taught me how to live
When the chips were down, and the barrel was loaded
Oh, John. Master (peace brick) thief
How can we ever forget you?
Everything we did you did bigger
And you could bring the kid out of anyone of us
And I will never understand what you thought you were doing
You didn't have to go out like that, John
You didn't have to do that. We love you
