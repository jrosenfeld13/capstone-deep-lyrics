We believed in fairy tales that day
I watched your father give you away
Your aim was true a pink bouquet
It fell right into my hands

We danced for hours and we drank champagne
You screamed and laughed when I got up and sang
And then you rode away in a white Mustang
To your castle in the sand

Through the years and the kids and the jobs
And the dreams that lost their way
Do you ever stop and wonder
Do you ever just wanna say

Hey,Hey Cinderella what's the story all about
I've got a funny feeling
We missed a page or two somehow
Oh, Cinderella maybe you could help us out
Does the shoe, fit you now

Your older but no more the wise
But learn the art of compromise
Sometimes we laugh, sometimes we cry
And sometimes we just break down

We're good now 'cause we have to be
We come to terms with our vanity
Sometimes we still curse gravity
When no one is around

Yeah, I don't gather dust in the corner of the attic
Bicycle rusting in the rain
Still we walk in the fabled shadow
Sometimes we call her name

Hey, Hey Cinderella what's the story all about
I've got a funny feeling
We missed a page or two somehow
Oh, Cinderella maybe you could help us out
Does the shoe, fit you now

Hey, Cinderella maybe you could help us out
Does the shoe, fit you now
Fit you now
Oh, Cinderella (Cinderella)
Does it fit you now
Cinderella (Cinderella)
Ohh
Cinderella (Cinderella)
Fit you now (Cinderella)
Oh - Oh - Oh - Ooo...
