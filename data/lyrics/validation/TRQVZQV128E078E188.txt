I will admit it
That you're something special
I'm now convinced
Marguaritte

The flame may be hot
But you can't resist it
To know is to touch
Marguaritte
Mama mama, Marguaritte
Marguaritte, Marguaritte

I don't know whether
To over or under estimate you
Whether to over or under estimate you
For when I come over
You then put me under
Personal taste is a matter of gender
Marguaritte

Don't let slip my name
While you're making love
Say you were dreaming
Marguaritte

Thou shalt not commit
The seventh commandment
Most precious of all
Marguaritte
Mama mama, Marguaritte
Marguaritte, Marguaritte

I don't know whether
To over or under estimate you
Whether to over or under estimate you
For when I come over
You then put me under
Personal taste is a matter of gender
Marguaritte

I don't know whether
To over or under estimate you
Whether to over or under estimate you
For when I come over
You then put me under
Personal taste is a matter of gender
Marguaritte
