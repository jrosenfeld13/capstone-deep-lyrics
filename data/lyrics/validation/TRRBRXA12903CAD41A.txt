Turn through the pages in my head
Remember what we had
Break through the shell you hide behind
Into the skin and see what the truth holds inside
I'll see what's behind your new eyes

And I will fight to keep myself alive
Without you I will find
Another source of light

Dissolve the memories in your head
Pretend like I was dead
And when you're looking for a friend
You'll turn around and miss all the people you had
And now they won't cover your back

And I will fight to keep myself alive
Without you I will find
Another source of light

Find your way back home

Your way back home

Find another source of light
Another source of light
Find another source of light
Another source of light
