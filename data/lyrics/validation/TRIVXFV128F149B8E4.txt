Walk us through
All the remnants of the aftermath
The stakes where high I knew
But i could not stop

Two aimless arrows fell
And I motioned you
Said this was nothing that
Two friends wouldn't do

Captured in the afternoon
It's better not to give yourself away
Give yourself away, away too soon

So, sing us your praises
It is without regret
Some say there's too much love
We just haven't found ours yet
