I see myself in a sea of gray
Colors fade no light no day
Alone i sit wondering where to roam
Hoping one day to find my home

Into what you read
Take back another day-the key
Look inside and you will see
The man you'll become eventually

What you got is your loneliness
All you got is your loneliness

I look beyond and i see Dismay
Little hope no light just pray
Can't figure out just what went wrong
I've been a prisoner for way too long
