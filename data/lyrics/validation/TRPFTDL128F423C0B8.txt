[Verse 1]
That Crystelle, you temptress
You creature of back booths
So accomplished at dancing
When walking would do
There's a neon fire in your eyes
Reflecting off a rhinestone tear
Fixed upon your cheek to see who cares
And that's way too much
For a country boy who stares
"Our life is just a private joke"
She said it like that was the punch line
Me, I fell in love now, wouldn't you?
And here's a fine madness in the air
It comes and goes like honeysuckle
Sent to you free from what to do
Oh, me I fell in love now, wouldn't you?

[Chorus]
Oh that Crystelle, she's barely a woman
Oh that Crystelle, she's hardly a child
Oh that Crystelle, I know she saw me coming
But doesn't Crystelle have a beautiful smile

[Verse 2]
She's a reason to be reckless
She's the right to Rock 'n' Roll
She's exactly what they meant
When they told you not to go
And her breath's as sweet as chewing gum
And her heart's a gold as kingdom come
She's heaven sent and hell bent to run
Oh, me I fell in love now, wouldn't you?

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Oh me, I fell in love now, wouldn't you?
