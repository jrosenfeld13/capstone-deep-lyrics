People they are everywhere why is it I can't
Connect with people they never understand
Me sometimes I feel so different or crazy 'cause I
Just can't seem to fit in I want to escape this life
Of taxes rules, false freedoms "I'll lay down and
Die not saying good-bye I'll lay down and die not
Saying good-bye it all will go on without,me
(I never connected)" why should I go on I feel so
Insignificant in this point in time I don't belong I
Can't make nothing of myself I can't catch a
Break anywhere I seek advancement i don't
Know what to do I'm hopeless I've made my judgement
"I'll 'lay down and die not saying goodbye I'll lay down
And die not-saying goodbye it all will-go on
Without me I never connected as a human being"
