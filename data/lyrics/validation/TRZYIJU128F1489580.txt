You build the walls that block your way
Hey kid you're in over your head
You build the walls that block your way

Excess unease
Avoid repeat
High frequency
2 years no one
Too late relive
Delay onset
Severe prevent
No cause effect

You build the walls that block your way
Hey kid you're in over your head
You build the walls that block your way

Drop off decline
On edge all times
Refuse to try
Recurring dream
Replays

Off the side of a mountain
So high
I never realize in time
So high

You build the walls that block your way
Hey kid you're in over your head
You build the walls that block your way
