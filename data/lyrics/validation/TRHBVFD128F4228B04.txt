You're sitting next to me
You don't know what to say to me
You're afraid that I might
Just worship you, tie myself to you

You're sitting next to me
You're staring at the screen
You cannot see me, I'm not here
They found the fountain of the endless love

Boy you hurt me, too much

Take me on, on your own

You're sitting next to me
You're taking my hand
Turning away from me, I can't wait
Cuz' every time you choose you choose the same

You're sitting next to me
You're so afraid you cannot please me, make me satisfied
They found the fountain of the endless love

Take me on, on your own
