Depot, depot, what am I doing here?
Depot, depot, what am I doing here?
I ain't coming, I ain't going
My confusion is showing
And outside the midnight wind is blowing, Sixth Avenue
I'm gonna paint myself blue
At the depot

I watch the taxis pull up and idle
I can't claim title to a single memory
You offered me a key
Cause opportunity don't knock
Has no tongue as you cannot talk
You're gonna shuffle when you walk
At the depot

This peeping Tom needs a peephole
And an up-tempo song
To move me along
When I find this depot, baby
I'm on a roll just like a pool ball, baby
I'm gonna be there at the roll call maybe
At the depot

Outside the midnight wind is blowing Sixth Avenue
Ah, tell me what is a poor boy to do?
At the depot
I'm on a roll just like a pool ball, baby
I'm gonna be there at the roll call maybe
At the depot
Depot
