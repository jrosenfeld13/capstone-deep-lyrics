Well, way down yonder in new orleans in the land of the dreamy scenes
There's a garden of eden, ah-you know what I mean

Yeah, creole babies with flashin' eyes softly whisper with tender sighs
And then you stop
Oh won't you give your lady fair a little smile
And then you stop
You bet your life you'll linger there a little while

Yeah, there is heaven right here on earth with those beautiful queens
Yeah, way down yonder in new orleans
Whoo

Way down yonder in new orleans, whoo, in the land of the dreamy scenes
There's a garden of eden, you know what I mean

Well, creole babies with flashin' eyes softly whisper with tender sighs
And then you stop
Oh won't you give your lady fair a little smile
And then you stop
You bet your life you'll linger there a little while

Yeah, there is heaven right here on earth with those beautiful queens
Well, way down yonder in new orleans
Yeah whoo
