Just an everyday evenin'
A lew nights ago...
I saw this beautiful lady
ThaI I scarcely know;
I don'l know where she'd come from
I don'l know where she's been...
But something in her big green eyes said
To me...
Baby won'l you come on in

As the sun was rising
I couldn't let myself go...
But something she showed me
Put a hold on me so
I ain't had this feeling
Since I don't know when
Falling in love was the tastthing on my mind
...but it started all over again...

And I know, what happened to me long
Time ago...
Bull know, this feeling just thrills me so...

It's like the first tlime walking in the moonlight
The first time you ever touched a rose
The first time in a long time, everything was alright
What happens now, nobody knows...anything goes!

The sun was rising
I couldn't make myself go...
Something she showed me
Put a hold on me so
Well I ain't had this feeling
Since I don't know when

It's like the first time walking in the moonlight
The first time you ever touched a rose
The first time in a long time, everything is alright
What happens now, nobody knows...
Anything goes
Anything goes
