[Verse]
We all know Fata Morgana
She keeps herself to herself
She likes the sound of explosions
You know, some people need nothing else
She has a volatile nature
Moves in a dangerous way
All the creatures around her
They keep quiet
Or she blows them away

[Chorus]
They sing, wha diddle iddle-i doh
Down here, the underwaterboys
Singing, wha diddle iddle-i doh
Down here, the underwaterboys

[Verse]
There's always fast talking Jonny
He used to get so ill
He spent a while in the country
Now he's clean and serene
But he can't stand still
Little Nick wasn't happy
He felt sick inside
One day he jumped from the window
Into the arms of a Wagnerian bride

[Chorus]
Singing, wha diddle iddle-i doh
Down here, the underwaterboys
Singing, wha diddle iddle-i doh
Down here, the underwaterboys

[Verse]
And then there's old Uncle Charlie
He don't speak any more
He lives one side of a mirror
A refugee from the chemical wars
A critical disposition
He likes to eat his own hands
His principle motivation
Is a special secretion from a secret gland

[Chorus]
He sings, wha diddle iddle-i doh
Down here, the underwaterboys
Singing, wha diddle iddle-i doh
Down here - the underwaterboys
Singing, wha diddle iddle-i doh
Down here, the underwaterboys
Singing, wha diddle iddle-i doh
Down here, the underwaterboys
