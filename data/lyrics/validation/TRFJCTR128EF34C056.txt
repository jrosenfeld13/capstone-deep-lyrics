A sun does rise from distant lands
Tears run and fires burning
He find first place with dirty hands
He graduates man without learning
Agenda set
So long ago
This son's a puppet with a master
The hands stand still right by his side
Middle finger on the button of disaster

And most of us we stand and watch
Like old lady getting handbag stolen
It's time to chase, chase them criminals
I see the devil and the devil is running

Bad business ties turn out sour
Backstabbed man nothing forgotten
And in an unforgotten hour
Seeds fall from an apple rotten
Now hate and fear have their own way
And don't the scum just love the distraction
Black blood will need to be lanced
And when it's found you just blame the guilty faction

And now it's time not just to watch
Like old lady getting handbag stolen
It's time to chase, chase them criminals
I see the devil and the devil is running (x2)
