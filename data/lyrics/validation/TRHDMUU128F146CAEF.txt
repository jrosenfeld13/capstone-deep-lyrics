Annie, told me
Get out of here, head for the sea
The sun is hot and the air is clean
Best things in the world are free
And Mister Murphy
Likes his jackanory
Holstein export, times three
Jimi Hendrix and Thin Lizzy

Met a mate in the afternoon
Holstein shore-line pub-crawl
Looking for some cold beer
Missed the stone punch drunk Judy
Tony, Brandy, M.G., Andy
Vodka, scotch and loads of beer
It's so great we want to stay here
