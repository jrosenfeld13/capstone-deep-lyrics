He gets up late
And he gets upset
And I watch the whole thing happen from the foot of the bed

Well, I could stay in bed all day
Is that such an awful thing for me to say?
Oh, that's a problem, and it's anybody's guess

[Chorus]
He's not impressed
He's not impressed
But I'm so, whoaohh ohh ohh ohh ohh (x3)
Amazed

When she gets home
Door is open, it ain't hard to wait outside when she was gone
That's a problem, and it's anybody's guess

[Chorus]
He's not impressed
He's not impressed
But I'm so, whoaohh ohh ohh ohh ohh (x3)
Amazed

Go out, and you sleep
You're hiding in the sheets
But I work hard so we can have nice things
And you're not even dressed
The house is such a mess

He's not impressed
He's not impressed
He's not impressed
He's not impressed
But I'm so, whoaohh ohh ohh ohh ohh (He's not impressed)(x3)
Oh, no
