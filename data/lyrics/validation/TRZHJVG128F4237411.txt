Verse 1: DJ Taz

Make hits is all I do
Well, how bout you?
Lay it down for the decision
Up sets is  all I vision
Got to make that money, honey
It ain't funny, country
Like Tom Sawyer
Diane Lench is my lawyer
Business strict, damn strict
DJ Taz, don't quit
No stoppin'   (Stoppin', stoppin')
Stop knockin' (Knockin, knockin')
You mad, boy
Our hoes keep on jockin'
Snappin' Uh like a turtle
Out of line, me want Myrtle
Nasty dancers on your station
Uh-huh we be bassin'
Keep it crunk, keep it crunk
Play it loud in your trunk

Chorus

Verse 2: DJ Taz

First best, best last  (Ohhh)

Pump it up, don't stop
Till the planet rock
Pipeline in the mist
Sucka's can't fade this
Hits (Hits) that's all I make
Records (Records) that's all I break
Billboards is all I do
You know me, but I don't know you
Shake it down, at the show
What the bass, mids, highs, lows
I give you mo
Can't peel me, I ain't no ho
Who's slippin', who's snoozin'
Who's winnin', who's losin'
In the South we love that drop
Don't quit, don't stop
Little sumpin' from big Taz
For yo monkey ass
