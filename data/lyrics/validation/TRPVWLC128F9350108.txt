[Verse 1]
Come back baby
Baby won't you come back
Come back baby to me
Now I know why all sad hearts cry
Baby baby come to me
Well, I cried all night
Ever since you left me
Nothing has gone right
Poor lonely oh me
I say come back baby

[Chorus]
Baby won't you come back
Come back baby to me
Now you know I love you so
Baby baby come to me

[Verse 2]
When you left me all alone
To sing the blues
I waited by the phone
To get good news
That you would come back baby

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh, come back baby to me
Hmm Hmm Hmm Hmm Hmm
Come back baby to me
Oh baby baby come to me
Come back baby to me
