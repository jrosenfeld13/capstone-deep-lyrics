Sittin' with a crowd around me
Why do I feel lonely?
People talkin' lots around me
Why do I feel lonely?

I can go to congregation
Still neglected by the nation
I can get my fill  a- bration
Still I'm feelin' lonely

Time, time in good time
Oh, oh I feel so better
Time, time, in good time
Oh, oh I will forget her

Yeah...

I'm not one to start complaining
Why am I so sour?
I'm not losing ground, I'm gaining
Why am I so sour?

Everything is going my way
Traffic's moving on the highway
Don't mind eating fish on Fridays
Sill I'm feeling sour

Time, time in good time
Oh, oh I feel so better
Time, time, in good time
Oh, oh I will forget her

Now it doesn't matter what I'm playing
Why do I get shaky?
It doesn't matter what I'm saying
Why do I get shaky?

Cannot figure, why I'm bitter
Folks call me a real go-getter
I ain't never been no quitter
Still I'm feeling shaky

Time, time in good time
Oh, oh I feel so better
Time, time, in good time
Oh, oh I will forget her

Time, time in good time
Oh, oh I feel so better
Time, time, in good time
Oh, oh I will forget her
