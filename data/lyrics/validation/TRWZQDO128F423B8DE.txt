[Verse 1]
And he's back again
Big decision, hoping the cards will fall kind
Not impossible, but your parents won't stop crying
And you got nothing but the dregs again, yeah, yeah, yeah
And you caught someone else's flowers from the tower

[Chorus]
Big boy, bring the hammer down
Big boy, bring the hammer down
On me

[Verse 2]
I had it coming, I had a ten-year plan, I had a plot on the corner
I dug a hole to the turtle shells, I keep the lid on eternal
Did you ever, did you ever
Really wanna make something out of nothing?
And do you ever, ever dream about a patch of dirt?
And about the time the Martians attack
And the tidal wave, and the lightning crack

[Chorus]
Big boy, bring the hammer down
Big boy, bring the hammer down
Big boy, bring the hammer down
Big boy, bring the hammer down

[Bridge]
And if you're clever, you glide like a feather
Take a number, follow to the letter
Or you can sever, soar to the heavens
Take a loan out, pay it back whenever
(Big boy, bring the hammer down)
And if you're clever, you glide like a feather
Take a number, follow to the letter
(Big boy, bring the hammer down)
Or you can sever, light up the heathers
Get your hands on the leather

[Chorus]
Big boy, bring the hammer down
(I spent a long time just kicking up the dust)
Big boy, bring the hammer down
(I spent a long time just waiting on the rust)
Big boy, bring the hammer down
(I spent a long time not getting up to much)
Big boy, bring the hammer down
(I spent a long time just kicking up the dust)
