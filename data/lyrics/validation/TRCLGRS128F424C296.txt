Well you could be friends of mine
I see your pondering
But the pleasure will be mine

I do feel hungry even though I've had the share
I'll keep shouting out loud to convert the herd
Got to spread the word to the non believers yeah

And the drummer must try holding times together
Cos the rest of us can keep it tied forever

Feels like I've been to every single disco all around
Another night, another town
It's time to burn this disco down

A higher place on higher ground
I've heard the sounds and do you like it now
Another night another town
Its time to burn this disco down

Well you could be magnetised
I know your wondering but for you I will oblige
If you try harder to persist in what you feel
Then you could push me down
Am I making me heard
Got to spread the word to the disagreers yeah

And the plastic must keep spinning round forever
(Round round)
And the memories will flood and keep us together

Feels like I've been to every single disco all around
Another night, another town
It's time to burn this disco down

Feels like I've been to every single disco all around
Another night, another town
It's time to burn this disco down

A higher place on higher ground
I've heard the sounds and do you like it now
Another night, another town
Its time to burn this disco down
