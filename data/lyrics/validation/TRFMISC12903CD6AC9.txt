[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be ignored, oh god
When I'm a gun in a fistfight
You're chewing with an open mouth, raw meat
Your blood drool attracts the flies

[Half-Chorus]
I give a little to you, I give a little to him, I give a little to her
I give a little to you, I give a little to him, I give a little to her

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna be left out or get fucked
But there's a talent in your lies
If you're chewing with an open mouth, raw meat;
Your blood drool attracts the flies

[Chorus]
I give a little to you, I give a little to him, I give a little to her
I give a little to you, I give a little to him, I give a little to her
A little bit for myself, don't put a price on your health, I give a little to her
I give a little to you, I give a little to him, I give a little to her

[Bridge]
Don't wait for the sun
Your story's been spun
These boys, they just wanna have fun
But your damage is done
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
I give a little to you, I give a little to him, I give a little to her
I give a little to you, I give a little to him, I give a little to her
A little bit for myself, don't put a price on your health, I give a little to her
I give a little to you, I give a little to him, I give a little to her

[Outro]
I give a little to her
I give a little to her
Oh, I give a little to her
Oh, I give a little to her
