This is tonight
And it rains like in a French black and white movie of the 50's
I feel like a character in it who's just lost it all
Who is alone with his raincoat
And a face showing a yet unknown way out of it
Steamy hot summer night street
Makes me laugh
I enjoy waiting for a taxi
And I hope
It's not gonna be here
Until I've had enough of
This pleasant situation

Movie is on
There comes a lady through the night
She stops in front of me
And asks me
For a light

To win some time
To introduce myself
I pretend not to know
In which pocket I got my matches
Movie is on
There comes a lady through the night
She stops in front of me
And asks me
For a light

She is walking on but not too far
She disappears behind a door
Some cats down there inside a club
The Sixties play guitar
Movie is on
There came a lady through the night
She stopped in front of me
And asked me
For a light

I enjoy the rain and my wet hair
Feel slightly stupid
But got to follow her
The club is empty
I am standing near the door
She is the only dancer
On the biggest floor

Quel est votre nom ?

Madame, que me dites-vous
I don't know...
I don't know at all...
