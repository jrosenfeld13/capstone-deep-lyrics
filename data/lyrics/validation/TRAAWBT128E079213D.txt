[Intro]
Too many

(Haters, haters, haters, haters)
Too many
(Haters, haters)
Kill all the
(Haters, haters)

[Chorus]
I had to do it, rock my shit
Had to get down to rock my shit
Y'all know the rules and how the game exists
Don't hate cause I had to handle business
So I had to do it, rock my shit
Had to get down to rock my shit
Y'all know the rules and how the game exists
Coz gradually i have to go and count my shit

[Verse 1]
Peep my game, it's ex-quis-ite (when I)
Flip my slang, it's just so slick (I don't)
Fuck around, cause I'm monogamist
Mama knew I got phlegm
Cause I always spit shit
I round up the air
And i beat you with a stick
If you chop off my legs
Im a still stand hit
I push you like a killer a killer
Coz im most definate
The road i push you to
I get my money, I get it real quick (but I)
I keep my soul, cause that's priceless (I'm a)
I'm undivided, the individualist (and the)
Globe united, the internationalist
I fornicate an elevator, fuck it up (Uuuh!)
I get a little reckless, so buckle up (Oooh!)
I see a gang of holes
There's no need to sew it up
Dont ask why I did it
Cause I had to blow it up

[Chorus]
(Yo) I had to do it, rock my shit
Had to get down to rock my shit
Y'all know the rules and how the game exists
Don't hate cause I had to handle business
So I had to do it, rock my shit
Had to get down to rock my shit
Y'all know the rules and how the game exists
Coz gradually i have to go and count my shit
