Ever since I saw you
I want to hold you
Like you were the one

It sees right through me
A bullet it comes and takes me
And I love you, I love you
I want you but I fear you

Who are u?
Who are u?

Ever since I saw you
I want to hold you
Like you were the one

Your feet rest on my shoes
I sing this song for you
Just to see you smile

And I love you, I love you
I love you but I fear you

Who are u?
Who are u?

For how long
How strong do I still have to be?
How come you mean so much to me?

For how long
How strong do I still have to be?
How come you mean so much to me?

And I love you I love you
I want you but I fear you

Who are u?
Who are u?

For how long
How strong do I still have to be?
How come you mean so much to me?

For how long
How strong do I still have to be?
