I don't know where i should go since you've been gone
I search planets just to find where i belong
I'm unmending, pretending you can hear me screaming out my song
I STILL HANG ON TO YOU
I SING THIS SONG FOR YOU

I felt whispered rain fall on my face today
I felt everything begin to slip away
My sunrise keep falling
Rhythms of your voice keep calling
Inside arenas in my mind i sing for you to hear me say...
