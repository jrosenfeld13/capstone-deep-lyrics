If I pick it up, can I put it down
Whatever it is I just can't stop
For only 20 seconds at a time it's all mine
I got too much pressure
Got me under it's thumb
And it's no fun, you can lose
Now I got a choice but I can't choose
Insistent as you are
Is no guarantee that you'll go far
Rock steady, if you can
But I've never been a steady man
People, wanna shoot you down
If you can't swim then you will drown
In sorrow
Can't get no medical attention till tomorrow
Sadlands are where I live
But that's none of your business
You keep asking, and soon enough
The kids gonna have to get rough
Maybe I'm a speed king
Push with the foot and I'm smiling
I can glide on the love inside
And there was you thinking that my hands were tied
All along I saw you hoping
I would slip and I'm not joking
The evidence in these events
Is still your lack of common sense
Did you really think that I would sink
Because I like another drink
Have to get up to get down
The remedy is in the sound
Absurdity of your suggestion
Leaves me asking just one question
If you are my friend today ?
Why do you want to hear me say ?
If I pick it up, can I put it down
Whatever it is, I just can't stop
(Repeat)
