Oh Lord my God
When I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds
Thy hands have made
I see the stars
I hear the rolling thunder
Thy power throughout
The universe displayed

Then sings my soul
My saviour God, to Thee
How great thou art
How great thou art
(Repeat 2X)

Woooo... Hmmm...
When Christ shall come
With a shout of acclamation
And take me home
What joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow
In humble adoration
And then proclaim
My God, how great thou art

Then sings my soul
My saviour God, to Thee
How great thou art
How great thou art
(Repeat 4X)

You are God, the mighty God
Lord, your name is great
I'll lift my voice (Echo: I'll praise your name)
I'll lift my voice
Sing and celebrate
(Repeat 4X)

Then sings my soul
My saviour God, to Thee
How great thou art
How great thou art

How great thou art
(Repeat 5X)
