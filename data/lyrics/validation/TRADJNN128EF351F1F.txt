I'm walking down an empty road, and I don't know
Where it's leading to
My heart is beating faster and I'm searching
For the truth
Gravity keeps pulling me and time is standing still
Golden rays are shining
On you...

The sun is shining down on me, now i feel you
The rain is falling over me, and i feel only you..
The sun is shining down on me (the sun is shining down on me)
Now i feel you (now i feel you)
The rain is falling over me (the rain is falling over me)
And i feel only you.. (and i feel only you..)

Spinning round i feel the heat, rising up
Deep inside of me
Look around and soon you'll feel the very air
That i breathe
Your mind and soul is all around
I sense you are so near
Now golden rays are shining
On me

The sun is shining down on me (the sun is shining down on me)
Now i feel you (now i feel you)
The rain is falling over me (the rain is falling over me)
And i feel only you.. (and i feel only you..)
The sun is shining down on me (the sun is shining down on me)
Now i feel you (now i feel you)
The rain is falling over me (the rain is falling over me)
And i feel only you.. (and i feel only you..)

(repeat)
