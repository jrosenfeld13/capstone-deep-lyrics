He makes a little frown
When you are acting proud
He'll try to tone you done
When you're a bit too loud
You cannot be too free you cannot be too smart
You know the law of John T is almost like a work of art

Just be a face in the crowd
Like everybody else
A silver lining cloud?
If that's what Johnny says
And there's no guarantee he won't break your heart
You know the law of John T is almost like a work of art

Blame your neighbour when you're feeling small
Kick the lying as soon you see them fall
In the fight for energy as we all play our parts
You know the law of John T is almost like a work of art

He makes a little frown
Like everybody else
He'll try to tone you done
When you're just being yourself
And he will never be someone you can out smart
You know the law of John T is almost like a work of art
He'll try to tone you done
When you're just being yourself
And he will never be someone you can out smart
You know the law of John T is almost like a work of art
