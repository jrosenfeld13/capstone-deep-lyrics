Have all you are and all you're to be
Fade in your world and all that you see
This hole in the wall all is under your thumb
Dulling your senses until you become

Until you become
Oh yeah, I gotta run
Oh I just got to run
Caught in a world where
You could never run too fast
To finally reach
Lord, The Beginning...At Last

Dismantling comfort of those you surround
Placing joy upon strangers
Now child, ain't that profound?
This hole in the wall all is under your thumb
Dulling your senses

Until you become, Until you become
Mmm yeah, I gotta run
Oh I just got to run
Cought in this world where
You could never run too fast
To finally reach
Lord, The Beginning...At Last

Where Are You Going?
Never knowing
Just who and where
You gotta turn
Forever caring
Forever sharing
You never learn, learn
Lifetime of getting burned
Oh yeah, I gotta run
Oh I just got to run
Caught in a world where
You could never run too fast
To finally reach
Lord, The Beginning...
...At Last
