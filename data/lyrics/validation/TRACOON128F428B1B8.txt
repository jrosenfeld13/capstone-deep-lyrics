I won't ever get used to this
A blank spot
Temptations
Do resist
The other shoe will drop
Just an aftershock
Nice hat; you look like a referee
Nice watch; but why are you timing me?
Its spring has come unwound
I was not out of bounds
This is not out
I drew that line
When I was handed free time

Bells clang
I guess it's a holiday
Did that rhyme?
Shit! I'm a poet now
So give me stuff for free
And if I do somehow
Into the soft whites
Of beautiful lies
Stare down
Stare
I don't apologize
I've never been the kind
To close an open mind
So leave behind all that extra free time
