(Billy Dean/David Gates)

The movers came today
To take out things away
Memories that we held so dear
One by one they're out of here
I hung the "for Sale" sign
On what was yours and once was mine
One last look around to find
Any home we might have left behind
But the emptiness rings true
There's really nothing left to do

Cause I'm not needed here now
You made it clear to me somehow
If it's not built on love
A home is just a house
So I'll close and clock this door
Not comin' back here anymore
It's time to face the fear
I'm not needed here now

That's where he said his prayers
And learned to climb the stairs
Every room has history
That holds a part of you and me
In my heart it's getting through
It's tellin' me that without you

Cause I'm not needed here now
You made it clear to me somehow
If it's not built on love
A home is just a house
So I'll close and clock this door
Not comin' back here anymore
It's time to face the fear
I'm not needed here now

It's time to face the fear
I'm not needed here now...
