I ain't picked up my guitar in 15 days
Some music man didn't give a damn what i had to say
But he's still in tears and playin' games that i dont play
Im not gonna let that son of a bitch take my love away
Can't take my love away

So roll me over over and over
While i turn your head
Hold me under under under
While im takin my last breath
It just gets colder colder colder
While you try to save yourself
God's gonna blow your clouds away
And give me a sunny day

It's on the telephone the tv and on the radio
Any day now the final whistle is bound to blow
But this ain't the way we have to say we had to go
There's still a chance at hand in hand from shore to shore
But can't take our love away

(can't take our love away)

So roll us over over and over
While you turn your head
It just gets colder colder colder
While you try to save yourself
God's gonna blow your clouds away
And make me a sunny day

Roll me over over over
While you turn your head
It just gets colder colder colder
While you try to save yourself
God's gonna blow your clouds away
He's gonna blow your clouds away
And make a sunny day
A sunny day ooooh
(a sunny dayyy)3x
