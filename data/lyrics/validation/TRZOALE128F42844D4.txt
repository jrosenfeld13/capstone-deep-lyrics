So I had a little time put aside
The whole damn kiss made me feel alive
Uh huh, uh huh

Ooh
Don't you analyze
Ooh
What you feel inside

You can't stop now
And though you say you're had enough
Honey stop the train I'm getting off
No, you can't stop now
Are out of your mind

I'm daydreaming that
Love is cool
Angels leaving and I'm the fool
No you can't stop now that you've started

Jessie's always out drinking and getting high
But you're all I need to get by
Uh huh, Uh huh

Don't you realize
Got to let it slide
