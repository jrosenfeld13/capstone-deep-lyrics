To you. Separation, only to put it down
To you. Desperation, only to be around
So on and so under, misdirected in other words
Always I wonder, is there anything I can do for you?
Anything I can do? Well I can do anything...
To some, I've been singled out, always I take your fall
To some, sane and broken down
All we've left is dropping around you
And you know these lines they're open ended
These books were meant to be followed
And your rules left to be read...
Is there anything I can do?
I can do anything. I can do anything
It's vulgar before me...
Is there anything I can do?
I can do anything. I can do anything
Vulgar before me, Vulgar before me
