You're walking in the city
But you don't know where to go
You're looking for action
But it don't come flying no no, oh
You're never in danger
And you don't know why that's so

You're hiding, you're smiling
And it's much too close for you
You'll give a dollar for a frame of mind
Walking on the edge of time
You were checking out the seconds
Now you're tripping every time you're walking out of that door

You've seen your little baby walk, by, round the corner, yeah
You've seen your little baby walk, over, to the other side, hey hey

Oh Lord

There's no day like Sunday
You can feel the time go by
It's ticking, you're tapping
You can wave your baby bye bye, oh
You're trying to take a picture every time
Getting the exposure right
You were checking out the seconds
Now you're counting out the hours from the screen to the door

You've seen your little baby walk
By, round the corner, yeah
You've seen your little baby walk
Over, to the other side, of the road

Oh Lord, no no, mmmmmm
(get up against the wall - but it wasn't me man - spread eagled)

Oh Lord, oh

You've seen your little baby walk, mmmmm, by, from the corner, yeah
You've seen your little baby walk, over, to the other side
You've seen your little baby walk, by, round the corner, yeah
You've seen your little baby walk, over to the other side, hey yeah
You've seen her walking
Oh Lord, no

Sometimes you have to run
