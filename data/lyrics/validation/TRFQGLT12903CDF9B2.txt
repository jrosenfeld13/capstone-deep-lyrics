Better days, better days, better days

I could hardly feel my post today

2000 volts is the answer to my problems
I thought I heard you say

I tried to tie you around, I need your pills
All I need, all I need is

Better days, better days, better days

I woke up in the morning just to find myself
All alone again
I talked to the mirror just to find myself
Laughing on the outside of my face

I tried to tie you around, I need your pills
All I need, all I need is

Better days, better days, better days

Ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I tried to tie you around, I need your pills
All I need, all I need is

Better days, better days, better days

Ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
