[Verse 1:]
You're more then...
A pretty face
Girl with ah...
Curvy shape...
You're full of substance
You're not shallow at all...
For hours we could sit
And talk...
Yeah...
Just about anything
From A to Z
It's crazy how you relate to me...
Aww...
Girl
With you I can always be my self
Is something that I never felt...

[Chorus:]
What's not to love about you...
Everyday I find more reasons too...
Girl is you're inner beauty...
That's always shining through
What's not to love about u...

[Verse 2:]
I love how you...
Don't walk around
With an all about me
Attitude...
Without going hard...
Chicks ain't seen you at all
It's what I'm thinking...
If you want it you can floss it
Floss it...
And you're not afraid to admit
When you're wrong...
Better yet...
What about our love making
Marathons...
Ohh
Girl is making me...
Wanna head straight
To tiffany's
It's like something shining on...
It feel good...

[Chorus]
What's not to love about you...
Everyday I find more reasons too...
Girl is you're inner beauty...
That's always shining through

What's not to love about u...

[Bridge:]
I'd be a fool...
To ever let you...
Get away...
Cause there ain't no one
Who could take
You're place
And you complete me...
So many different ways...
So today I sing you praise...
Baby...

[Chorus]
What's not to love about you...

[Ad-lib:]
What's not to love...

Everyday I find more reasons too...

[Ad-lib:]
Reasons to yeah

Girl is you're inner beauty...
That's always shining through
What's not to love about u...

[Ad-lib:]
La la la bout you...
Baby

[Chorus]
What's not to love about you...

[Ad-Lib:]
What's not to love...

Everyday I find more reasons too
Girl is you're inner beauty...
That's always shining through
What's not to love about u...
Love about you

[Outro:]
What's not to love...
