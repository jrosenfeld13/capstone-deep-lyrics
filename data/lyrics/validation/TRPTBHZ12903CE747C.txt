[Verse 1]
Baby, don't turn out the light
I wanna see you look at me
Whisper only truth tonight
Not just promises and empty fantasies

[Chorus]
I don't need a bed of roses
'Cause roses wither away
All I really need is honesty
From someone with a strong heart
A gentle hand
Who'll take me as I am

[Verse 2]
Baby, I need for you to know
Just exactly how I feel
Fiery passions come and go
I'd trade a million pretty words
For one touch that is real

[Chorus][2x]

[Outro]
From someone with a strong heart
A gentle hand
Who'll take me as I am
