Midnight, lock all the doors
And turn out the lights
Feels like the end of the world
This sunday night

Theres not a sound
Outside the snows comin' down
Somehow i can't seem to find
The quiet inside
My mind

3: 02
The space in this room
Has turned on me
And all my fears
Have cornered me here
Me and my t.v. screen

The volumes down
Blue lights are dancing around
And still
I can't seem to find the quiet
Inside my mind

Daylight is climbing the walls
Cars start
Feet walk to halls
The world waits
And now I am safe
At least by the light of day
At least by the light of day
