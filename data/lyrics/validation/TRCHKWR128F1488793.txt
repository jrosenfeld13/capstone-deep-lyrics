Saw the headlines just the other day
Said the wall's comin' down
Said the peace is just a breath away

One world, one voice, on happy family
Yeah, that's what the world believes

I read my Bible just the other day
Said the Kingdom's comin' down
Jesus said the Kingdom's just a prayer away

One Lord, one God, one faith eternally
Yeah that's what the church believes

We're alive, we are strong
We're a nation, we belong
Let us all stand together in the Kingdom
No more darkness, no more night
We are children of the light
Let us all stand together in the Kingdom

Heard a newsman just the other day
He said a war was comin' down
He said destruction was just a breath away

One world, one war, one awesome tragedy
Yeah, that's what the world believes

I heard a preacher just the other day
He said God's glory's comin' down
Just as the waters cover all the seas

One King, one crown, one reign forevermore
Yeah that's what we have and more

In the Kingdom
One Lord, one God
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
One name above all names
All stand together in the Kingdom
Na na na One King, one crown
One reign forevermore
