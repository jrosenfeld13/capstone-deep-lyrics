I know, you know, we know
I'm pulling on myself a third time
It's absurd, get up and go to work
Lately, medicated

Sleep got an over rated
Four star, nominated
I'm perforated with confession
Obsession, submission

Popping prescriptions in the kitchen
Hello, I'm in here, just let yourself in

Everything that you want
Well, it's never enough
When it all comes down
Everything that you want
Well, Its never enough
When it all comes
Down, down, down

I stutter, I cough, I flutter
This place is in a clutter
Standing ovation in the back
I'm held for ransom feeling stupid

Pathetic, underweight, filled up
With diuretic bombshell
Hand grenades
Make all the same mistakes

This earthquake weather
Has got me shaken
Inside, I'm high up and dry

Everything that you want
Well, it's never enough
When it all comes down
Everything that you want
Well, Its never enough
When it all comes

Confess to me
Everything that's in between
Confess to me
Everything that's in between

Pornographic, prophylactic
Reactions so sporadic erotic, exotic
When did making love
Become so robotic, hypnotic, psychotic

Three hundred dollars
Buys a three minute serenade
Inside the candy jar
Finding yourself a hobby
Drugs in the hotel lobby
Stereophonic, ironic
This conversations gone

Everything that you want
Well, it's never enough
When it all comes down
Everything that you want
Well, it's never enough
When it all comes

(Confess to me)
Swaying your hips to the vynal
While your hair is braided
Post dated, agitated, masticated

(Confess to me)
Aggrivated post cards, throwing darts
Side kicks and super marts
Break dance, lap dance
(When it all comes down)
I just want another chance
