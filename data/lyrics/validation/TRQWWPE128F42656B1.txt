Watch out!
You better get yourself runnin'
I got a hurricane comin'
No warnin' surprise
I'm gonna take my leave
I wanna plant my seed
Don't let it shock you
Hold tight, hold tight
You better run for cover
I'm a hit 'n run lover
Run for cover tonight
Get ready!
So you think it's easy
Wanna be this sleazy
Well, I'll tell you it's nice
Ha ha
We're gonna make a name
Ain't gonna play no games
You'd better take the first flight tonight
You better run for cover
I'm the hit 'n run lover
Run for cover tonight
Find some shelter and hide
No survivors tonight
Hold tight, tonight
Yeah, watch out!
You better get yourself runnin'
I got a hurricane comin'
No warnin' surprise
I'm gonna take my leave
I wanna plant my seed
Don't let it shock you
Hold tight, hold tight
Run for cover
I'm the hit 'n run lover
You better run for cover tonight
Yeah
Run for cover
I'm the hit 'n run lover
Run for cover tonight
Look out! Watch out
Get out! Hold out!
Run for cover tonight
Run for cover! Woo!
