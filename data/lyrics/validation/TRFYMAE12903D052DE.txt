Say what's the matter with you?
Knocking me out like you do
You're kicking me boy, you're kicking
It's like nothing seems to boom in your box, baby
Nothing seems to boom in your box

I sit on fences with my defences and devices
The pressure ices baby, tell me why's it so?

It's like nothing seems to boom in your box, baby
Nothing seems to boom in your box

Said boy why did you do that
Said boy why did you do that?

I won't hurt you girl
I won't hurt you girl

Can you fix this heart failure
Can you fix this heart failure
'Cause if you can then I suggest you come do it, do it
Can you fix this heart failure
Can you fix this heart failure
'Cause if you can then I suggest you come do it, do it

Oops, was it something I said?
No, it's something with your head
You better get that checked, better better get that checked
It's like nothing seems to boom in your box, baby
Nothing seems to boom in your box

Straighten up boy now, when you gonna get this straight?
'Cause if you wait too late, I'll be gone away
It's like nothing seems to boom in your box, baby
Nothing seems to boom in your box

Said boy why did you do that?
Said boy why did you do that?

I won't hurt you girl

'Cause if you can't then I suggest you come do it, do it
