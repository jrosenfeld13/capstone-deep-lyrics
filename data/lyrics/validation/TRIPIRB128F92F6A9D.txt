Its a little late love the night is caving in
Lights hang overhead like stars - my dress is black as sin
And the music is low and my body is yours
Won't you hold me tight until they close the doors
And the rythm is smooth like the sea against the sand
And i tremble with each touch of your hand
You dont really know me and i dont recall your name
But i like the way your body moves and i know you feel the same
So welcome to the club life baby step into my world
I dont care if you got much cash, if youre a boy or a girl
Its the way you wear your hair, your careless little smile
Its the way you dance with me until im spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning yeah
Some might call it a one night stand, but i dont really care
Its far to late to define this and we cannot stay here
So its out into the street, and its out into the night
And its so long to this love affair, so i'll kiss you goodbye
