Don't you know I need you so
Tell me please, I gotta know
Do you mean to make me cry
Am I just another guy

Wo-oh yay yay
Love you more than I can say
I'll love you twice as much tomorrow

Tell me please, I gotta know
Do you mean to make me cry
Am I just another guy

Wo-oh yay yay
I love you more than I can say
I'll love you twice as much tomorrow
Wo-oh, love you more than I can say
