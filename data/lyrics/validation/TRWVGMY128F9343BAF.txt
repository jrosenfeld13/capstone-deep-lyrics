Mama, mama
I want some milk

Yeah!
Back years ago
In the month of June
When all those animals got together
And had that party down at the house of brother 'Coon
Now the little Monkey
He was most delighted
He was a hot mother cause he wasnt invited
Well late that night, he looked at his watch
I got half past nine
I know god damn well its party time
Looked up over his door
Got that long .44
Started walkin down the street
Whilst walking down the street, he was walking slow
He kicks an Elephant's ass and leaves him lying dead on the road

Then he went on down to this building
Where they were having this party at
And he made a loud knock on the door
Say you mammy fuckers
Get down drinkin' that goddamn Bacardi
If you don't give me some of that shits or Ill break up the mother fucking party
Said, "I got an ass pocket of whiskey and a front pocket of gin
If you dont open this door Ill kick the mother fucker in."
Thats when the Lion jumped up, you know
Said, "listen to that little squirt out there talkin shit
It couldnt mean a thing."
"Cant bullshit the public, know damn well Im the king."
But they opened the door and opened it wide
Little bad monkey stepped inside
All you motherfuckers get up on your [unknown] toes
And quit your clowning cause you know youre wrong
Those the queen of diamonds on the table and four of diamonds on the floor
And cut the lights out with his .44
By that time one them pimps got the light
He jumped up on the counter and throw back his vest
And said, "every mother fucker in here is under arrest."
Hes the Police you know

He was the main man you know
