Just saying I love you just ain't enough
Needing to be with you is a must
The thing I love more than you is us baby
Ain't nothing gonna stop this love
Ain't nothing gonna
Ain't nothing gonna stop this love

Just saying I love you just ain't enough
Needing to be with you is a must
The thing I love more than you is us baby
Ain't nothing gonna
Ain't nothing gonna stop this love

Soul mates from birth
If you were the Moon, I'd be the Earth
Two people destined to be together
A love so strong it can't be severed

Girl we can make this from the heart
You feel my every move
You know I'm thinking bout you
With you and only you
I can have piece of mind
That's why

Just saying I love you just ain't enough
Needing to be with you is a must
The thing I love more than you is us baby
Ain't nothing gonna stop this love
Ain't nothing gonna
Ain't nothing gonna stop this love

Just saying I love you just ain't enough
Needing to be with you is a must
The thing I love more than you is us baby
Cuz baby you're my everything

I can feel it when I close my eyes
This love of mine, deep inside me
The happiest moment of my life
When you said that you feel the same that I do

Girl you know I, I love you
And I know you love me too
Without any questions, you were here for me
That's why you gotta see

Just saying I love you just ain't enough
Needing to be with you is a must
The thing I love more than you is us (is the both of us together baby)
Ain't nothing gonna
Ain't nothing gonna stop this love

Just saying I love you just ain't enough
Needing to be with you is a must
The thing I love more than you is us baby
Cuz baby you're my everything

You're the reason why
Love feels nice to hold
We've got a love tale that's never been told
Too strong to deny
Too bold to control
A love that grows from young
Until the days we are old

You said someone told you
You only get one true love
And if this is true
Girl, I know it's surely you
Girl you know I love you
You know you've got my trust
But these few words are not enough

Just saying I love you just ain't enough
Needing to be with you is a must
The thing I love more than you is us baby
Ain't nothing gonna stop your love
Ain't nothing gonna
Ain't nothing gonna stop your love

Just saying I love you just ain't enough
Needing to be with you is a must
The thing I love more than you is us baby
Cuz baby you're my everything
