I am going down the long lonesome road to Memphis
And I have come from the valley of the damned to Memphis
My love has gone with the devil to the well of poison
But I declare I drink my fill from that well of poison

The lord's gonna save my soul
Somewhere in the hills of Memphis
And the lord's gonna rest my bones
Somewhere in the hills of Memphis
