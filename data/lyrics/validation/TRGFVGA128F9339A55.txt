Wake up, wake up
Whats the matter with you
Is there a stone in your shoe
I think I can help
Yes, Ive been there myself
Its such a beautiful guide
??? so incredibly shy
I think its a shame
So in the name of the game
I think you better wake up, wake up
Oh darling now before we break up
Give up and give in
Im going on a holiday with you
I put my money on you
Bought a ticket for two
A place in the sun (ohohohoh)
With nowhere to run (ohohohoh)
Watching you disappear
Everytime I come near
Drives me insane
So in the name of the game
Oh, I think you better wake up, wake up
Oh darling now before we break up
Give up and give in
Im going on a holiday with you
(holiday with you)
I guess it would be nice, so nice
To da-di-da-di-dam-do
I know it would be nice
To keep on ruby-ru, to ruby-ru with you
I-yeah-i-yeah-i-yeah
I-yeah-i-yeah-i-yeah
I-yeah-i-yeah-i-yeah
I-yeah-i-yeah-i-yeah
Wake up, wake up
Oh darling now before we break up
Give up and give in
Im going on a holiday with you
Wake up, wake up
Oh darling now before we break up
Give up and give in
Im going on a holiday with you
Wake up, wake up
Oh darling now before we break up
Give up and give in
Im going on a holiday with you
On a holiday with you
Im going on a holiday with you
Wake up, wake up
