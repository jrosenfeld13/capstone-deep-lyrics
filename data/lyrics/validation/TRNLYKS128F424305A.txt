Well I me my little chicken
At the bar and grill
She said "hey, dad
You really give me a thrill."

I really love the way
You sing that song
Hey there cat
Can we go whole hog

I said "Wait a minute kitty
I'm no cat
Well I'm a dog!"

So I took the little kitten out for a date
Boy, she's something special and life was great
Until I got her home and walked through her door
She started looking at me like she was a bit bored
Her eyes started buggin' just like a frog

She said "Wait a minute daddy
I don't kiss dogs."
A rockin' dog!
A rockin' dog!

She said wait a minute daddy
You're no cat
Well, you're a dog

And now I call my little kitten
Up on the phone
Another man answers
Sayin' she's not at home

She never let's me in
When I come a'knockin'
She's always goin' out
With some double-talkin' Jock

I've got to stop sittin'
Like a bump on a log
I've got a reputation as a
A rockin' dog

I've got to stop sittin'
Like a bump on a log
I've got a reputation as a
A rockin' dog

I've got to stop sittin'
Like a bump on a log
I've got a reputation as a
A rockin' dog
