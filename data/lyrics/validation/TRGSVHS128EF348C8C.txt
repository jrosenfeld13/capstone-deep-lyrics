My skinny Minnie is a crazy chick
Six foot high and one foot thick
Well, do I love her, does a boy love pie?
Well, she is the apple of my eye

Skinny Minnie
She ain't skinny
She's tall, that's all
Oh yeah, she's somethin' else

Well, tho' her shadow doesn't take much ground
Well, what there is really gets around
Well, what there ain't that's what she be
And even that's way too much for me

Skinny Minnie
She ain't skinny
She's tall, that's all
Yeah

Well, slightly slimmer than a fishing pole
She's one half rock and the other half roll
Well, dig that chick from either side
And man, you'll yell "Where did she hide?"

Skinny Minnie
She ain't skinny
She's tall, that's all

Man, she's double king size
Tree top tall
Man, she's a long drink on a mountaintop
