If I'm not sleeping
It's because I'm frightened
Of what I might find
Behind the curtain
There is a signal
There is a warning
I will not heed them
Before I hear the morning dew
That trickles down my window
Mulu - the people of the rain forest
Believe in dream time
Real time inverted
Along a faultline
Below the surface
There is a sequence
There is a reason
For all these nightmares
All this mayhem
Mulu - the changes came before he knew
The keeper of the rain forest
Talk to me Mulu
Speak to me Mulu
Walk with me Mulu
Reach for me Mulu
Mulu - the changes came before they knew
The seasons changed an hour too soon
The waters came before he knew
The prisoner of the rain forest
