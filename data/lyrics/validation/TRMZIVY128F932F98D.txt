Once there was a battle there
In Zaire, in Zaire
A hundred thousand people there
In Zaire, in Zaire
All those people gathered there
In Zaire, in Zaire
To see the rumble in the jungle there...
In Zaire!

Came a man called Elijah
In Zaire, in Zaire
With him came the superstar
In Zaire, in Zaire
All those people came from far
In Zaire, in Zaire
To see the rumble in the jungle there...
In Zaire!

And who was the victim in the night?
Elijah Mohammed's boy Ali won the fight!

(instrumental)

All those people chanted there
In Zaire, in Zaire
Seven rounds of torture there
In Zaire, in Zaire
One more round and Ali's there
In Zaire, in Zaire
There was great exitement everywhere...
In Zaire!

Came a man called Elijah
In Zaire, in Zaire
With him came the superstar
In Zaire, in Zaire
All those people came from far
In Zaire, in Zaire
To see the rumble in the jungle there...
In Zaire!

And who was the victim in the night?
Elijah Mohammed's boy Ali won the fight!

(instrumental)

The lightning struck twice in the night
First in the ring and then after the fight...

In Zaire, in Zaire
In Zaire, in Zaire
In Zaire, in Zaire
In Zaire, in Zaire
In Zaire, in Zaire
In Zaire, in Zaire
