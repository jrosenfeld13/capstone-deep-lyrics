I'm just a boy, but I'm a man
My body's young, my mind is old
I've lived through life movin' all the time
Stories I can tell of things I've seen and done
And feelings that I've hid and cannot find
Ooh Ooh Ooh I think I'm running out of time

Peace of mind, you escape me
Peace of mind, you could rape me
Every time I get you near to me
I've got to chase you to another town

The time when I was born, and the city I been in
I got the Gypsy Spirit making all my moves
I got no home I can remember
My only friend is gone
And I only see my mother in December
Ooh Ooh Ooh I think I'm running out of time

Peace of mind, I forsake you
Peace of mind, think I hate you
Even if you let me find your home
I think I'll pass it up and move on down the road

Well I got mountains in my past
And the valleys up ahead
I got miles, and miles, and miles before I sleep
I need to have a week, or just a day, or just an hour
To sleep, but I can't remember how to dream
Ooh Ooh Ooh I'm givin' up on peace of mind
