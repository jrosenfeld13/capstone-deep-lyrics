I want to go deeper
But I don't know how to swim
I want to be meeker
But have you seen this old earth?
I want to fly higher
But these arms won't take me there
I want to be, I want to be

Maybe I could run
Maybe I could fly, to You
But do you feel the same
When all You see is
Blame in me?

Hey

And the wonder of it all
Is that I'm living just to fall
More in love with You

And the wonder of it all
Is that I'm living just to fall
More in love with You, yeah

I want to go deeper
But is it just a stupid whim?
I want to be weaker
Be a help to the strong
I want to run faster
But this old leg won't carry me
I want to be, I want to be

Maybe I could run
Maybe I could fly, to You
But do You feel the same
When all You see is
Blame in me?

Hey, yeah

And the wonder of it all
Is that I'm living just to fall
More in love with You

And the wonder of it all
Is that I'm living just to fall
More in love with You, yeah

And the wonder of it all
Is that I'm living just to fall
More in love with You

And the wonder of it all
Is that I'm living just to fall

Maybe I could run
Maybe I could follow
It's time to walk the path
Where many seem to fall
Hold me in Your arms
Just like any father would
How long do we have to wait?
How long, we're going all the way

Hey

And the wonder of it all
Is that I'm living just to fall
More in love with You

And the wonder of it all
Is that I'm living just to fall
More in love with You, yeah

The wonder of it all
And the wonder of it all
Yeah
Yea, the wonder of it all
And the wonder of it all
Is that I'm falling, falling, falling
