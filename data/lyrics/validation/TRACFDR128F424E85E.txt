I partied hard on the first tier

But i burned a lot of bridges and then

I'm a photograph that was torn in half

And I'll never be invited again

But hey, it's okay, I don't care, I don't mind You know I'm gonna be just fine

Cous when the world shut me out I was pretty lucky that you let me in You're all i need to face another day whenever i'm in a bind, there's really only one thing i keep in mind You're all i need to survive

Used to sit and worry that i'd ruin my reputation it was the hardest thing i ever had to face But now i'm free of worry and i'm free of all complication

It's simple but it's true, it's all because of you

But hey, it's okay, I don't care, I don't mind You know I'm gonna be just fine
