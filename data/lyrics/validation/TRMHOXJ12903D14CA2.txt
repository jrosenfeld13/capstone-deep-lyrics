A horrible mistake or maybe i knew what you were thirsting
Now search for life parched wasted wanting thirst forever
To relay a dismaying fact is here

Call it what it is
Just a fantasy injected to what seems fit lay backside shuffling leaves
Fraud the leaves are not there the ground is the quicksand
Burns to know still unnoticed if rectally acquainted and set ablaze

What can i expect?
Run wild be set free
Ignorance reams minds of the clumsy

No textures silhouettes
Inquiring minds love to know
Still were longing to plug in this enlightenment

Down to forward a motion to quit
Theres nothing intact with a whole skin
Pillars are closing in and the life that betrayed you eclipses the fool
