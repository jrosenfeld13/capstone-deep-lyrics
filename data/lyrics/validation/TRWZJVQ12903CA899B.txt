I had the strangest dream
That you were lost at sea
I found you drowning on the ocean floor
I woke from my deep sleep to end the misery
I found you lying outside of my door
I tried to wake you up
To shake you up
And found out you were dead

Like a leaf in the wind you left me standing alone
To face the demons in my head

We're making fiction of our lives
Burning pages as we write
We read the lies between the lines
These dead letters won't survive

A dusty record spins
An old song plays again
The needle drags across it's skin
Ink spills through my pen
The paper soaks it in
The music bringing tremors to my hands

I can't just give you up
Just lift you up to chance on a dragon fly's wings
With my love in the wind you left me standing alone
Hoping it brings you back to me

We're making fiction of our lives
Burning pages as we write
We read the lies between the lines
These dead letters won't survive (x2)

We are not poets
We have not right to make amendments
This story's over
This chapter's closing
I don't know how it ends
But I really don't like how it begins

We're making fiction of our lives
Burning pages as we write
We read the lies between the lines
These dead letters won't survive (x2)

We're burning pages
We're burning pages now
