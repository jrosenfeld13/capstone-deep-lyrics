I live on a battlefield
Surrounded by the ruins of the love we built
And then destroyed between us
The smoke has cleared
As I stumble through the rubble
I'm dazed, seeing double
And I'm truly mystified

My new home is a shell hole filled
With tears and muddy water
And bits of broken heart
All around there is desolation
And scenes of devastation
Of a love been torn apart
I live on a battlefield
I live on a battlefield

I live on a battlefield
The one where not one single drop of blood has spilled
Is no less horrifying
Sweet memories, memories
Of a bygone situation
Now shattered lord and battered
Lie scattered all around

My new home is a shell hole filled
With tears and muddy water
Yes and bits of broken heart
All around there is desolation
And scenes of devastation
Of a love been torn apart
I live on a battlefield
I live on a battlefield

Everything that can has gone wrong
(I live on a battlefield)
It's gonna take spine to carry on
(I live on a battlefield)
Like a drowning man coming up for air
(I live on a battlefield)
I'm looking for another survivor
But I can't see one anywhere

My new home is filled with muddy water
All around there's bits of broken heart
My world is one of desolation
And scenes of devastation
There is no consolation
For a love been torn apart
I live on a battlefield
I live on a battlefield
I live on a battlefield, battlefield
I live on a battlefield
