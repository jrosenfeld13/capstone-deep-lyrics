Where the big boys meet on the Vegas Strip, yeah
With the SDI as the gun in his hip
Theres a gleam in his eye as he shakes her hand and he leaves you
Then his sellin plans are to walk away and deceive you, whoa

Shes a shell shocked baby in the cradle of time
Were just a walk soft army on a human land mine
Ive walked a million miles far beyond the stars of your future
Ive walked a million miles far beyond the hope of your future

So ivory tower man
Was it part of your plan
Turn this city to sand
With a one way ticket to the promise land

Atomic Playboys
We are Radiation Romeos
You built this body
But cant take away my soul, no

Atomic Playboys
We are Radiation Romeos
You stole the sky
And dared to watch the world explode, Romeo

So its one wrong move and two worlds collide
With this touch and go game of suicide
Im a atom brained man with a heart of gold
And Ill heat you up when your body gets cold

So ivory tower man
Was it part of your plan
Turn this city to sand
With a one way ticket to the promise land

Atomic Playboys
We are Radiation Romeos
You built this body
But cant take away my soul, no

Atomic Playboys
We are Radiation Romeos
You stole the sky
And dared to watch the world explode, Romeo

Atomic Playboys
We are Radiation Romeos
You built this body
But cant take away my soul, no

Atomic Playboys
We are Radiation Romeos
You stole the sky
And dared to watch the world explode
Romeo
Touch and go
Romeo
Romeo
