You're making deals, your money is on the mark
You'll always take, you're always on the dark
You buy a proof, you know just what to say
I took you out, I took you for a ride

You don't stand a chance
Not for a little while
You don't mean a thing, not a thing to me
You don't mean a thing, you don't mean a thing

You don't mean a thing, you don't mean a thing
You don't mean a thing, you don't mean a thing
You don't mean a thing, you don't mean a thing
No matter what I might say, you don't mean a thing to me

You have those eyes, those pretty brown eyes
That's where you make, you make up all the lies
A part of you that I don't wanna see
A part of you I wouldn't wanna be

You don't stand a chance
Not for a little while
You don't mean a thing, not a thing to me
You don't mean a thing, you don't mean a thing

You don't mean a thing, you don't mean a thing
You don't mean a thing, you don't mean a thing
You don't mean a thing, you don't mean a thing
No matter what I might say, you don't mean a thing to me

You don't mean a thing, you don't mean a thing
You don't mean a thing, you don't mean a thing
You don't mean a thing, you don't mean a thing
You don't mean a thing, you don't mean a thing
No matter what I might say, you don't mean a thing to me

You're making deals, your money is on the mark
You'll always take, you're always on the dark
You buy a proof, you know just what to say
I took you out, I took you for a ride

You don't stand a chance
Not for a little while
You don't mean a thing, not a thing to me

No matter what I might say, you don't mean a thing to me
You don't mean a thing, you don't mean a thing
You don't mean a thing, you don't mean a thing
You don't mean a thing, you don't mean a thing
You don't mean a thing, you don't mean a thing

No matter what I might say, you don't mean a thing to me
You don't mean a thing, you don't mean a thing
You don't mean a thing, you don't mean a thing
You don't mean a thing, you don't mean a thing
You don't mean a thing, you don't mean a thing

No matter what I might say, you don't mean a thing to me
You don't mean a thing, you don't mean a thing
You don't mean a thing, you don't mean a thing
You don't mean a thing, you don't mean a thing
You don't mean a thing, you don't mean a thing

No matter what I might say, you don't mean a thing to me
You don't mean a thing, you don't mean a thing
You don't mean a thing, you don't mean a thing
You don't mean a thing, you don't mean a thing
You don't mean a thing
