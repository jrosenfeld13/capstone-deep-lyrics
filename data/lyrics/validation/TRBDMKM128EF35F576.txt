Yeah, we wanna star in an eighties movie
American bratpack members, truly
Yeah, we want big hair, permed and curly
So we can wear shades, looking mean and surly
Yeah we wanna car with a removable roof
So we can air our big hair, bypass the truth
That these things never happen in reality
But we'll be pretty in pink, just wait and see

I'll be the starbright boy
And yr the starbright girl
I'll be the starbright boy
And invade yr world

Yeah, we wanna star in a skateboard movie
And be bad at the stunts like all amateurs should be
But we'd have so much fun playing lets pretend
That we'd get good at the stunts, showing off by the end
Yeah, we'll steal sport cars from our dads
And we'll fail our exams 'cause it's cool to be sad
Yeah, everyday could be a holiday
No school, no rule, just me to say...

I'll be the starbright boy...

We'll be hanging around with ferris bueller
Meet drew barrymore 'cause she's way cooler
Buy all our clothes on rodeo drive
Never flatlining, we'll be alive
Upside down like we're the lost boys
Endorse the starbright fake plastic toys
Until the white flag must be unfurled
Just like superman, we'll invade yr world
