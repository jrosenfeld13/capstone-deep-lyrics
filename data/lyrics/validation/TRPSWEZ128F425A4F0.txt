Can't you see me running
I am really running for my life
Guess from where I'm coming
Guess why I'm running for my life

Can't you see the witch
Can't you see the witch
Can't you see the witch by my side

Can't you see my death fear
I can hear her voice shouting everywhere
Who know what I've could done
It must be so bad that a witch does care
