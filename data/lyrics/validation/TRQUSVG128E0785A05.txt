We've been through all of these things before
We've said a lot of these things before
It's starting to get boring

I might as well be talking to a wall
'Cause they're not listening anymore
You'll get no answers from them

You're knockin' on the wrong door
You'll soon find out there's...
No reaction
No reaction yet

They'll never answer you if you call
They'll never be there for you if you fall
So don't get broken hearted

They're watchin' every move you make
But still you find there's...

We've been through this all before
We've said a lot of this before
And it's startin' to sound like a worn out record
That no one wants to play

Sit back and pay attention
Seems we forgot to mention
We're conducting our own investigation
So get out of the way
