It's when I look at you
Suddenly life
It all makes sense

Feel so beautiful
Completely natural
It's love I guess

It's the closest thing
I've imagined it to be

With one kiss, one touch
I'm in heaven
We can make it last baby

Feel my love tonight
Knowing it's not goodbye
Leaving my heart at the door (heart at the door)
Keep it warm and true
Giving it all to you
I'm coming back for more
So let me love you more

It's when you look at me
That I feel like I'm at home
It all works out

It's my own miracle
So free and wonderful
It's what it's all about

It's the closest thing
I've imagined it to be

With one kiss, one touch
I'm in heaven
We can make it last baby

Feel my love tonight
Knowing it's not goodbye
Leaving my heart at the door (heart at the door)
Keep it warm and true
Giving it all to you
I'm coming back for more
So let me love you more
