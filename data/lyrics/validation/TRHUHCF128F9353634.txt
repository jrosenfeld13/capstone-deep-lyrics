[Hook: Thes One]
My city, are you wit me?
Jump around the floor and get busy
Got the kid stone-trippin at the disco
Got the kid stone-trippin at the disco
My city, are you wit me?
Jump around the floor and get busy
Got the kid stone-trippin at the disco
Got the kid stone-trippin at the disco

[Verse 1: Double K]
Ho! Right now, on the mic tonight
Young handsome brotha on the disco hype
Got the butterfly collar and the skins to match
Ten crates in the booth, got a break to catch
Skills needed to apply, dress chic and be denied
Pay the cover and fly, everybodys gettin high
Please dont ask why, see the ladies get tipped
While the cheeba get lit, yall, heres another hit

[Verse 2: Thes One]
Oh, party people, lets set it off tonight
Tip the bartender, keep the dance floor tight
Young ladies in the house (Oh, my God!)
Turn it up, yall, protocol: up off the wall til the last call
Last pint, (Last night!), change it all
You keep moving like your wedding night
Mikes sweating, light-headed, like too much hype, you wipe your brow
Hey, bartender, I think I need a shot right now
Do you have the Jgermeister? (Oh, yeah!)

[Verse 3: Double K]
Well, heres a round of brandy, for those feeling randy
The P going disco, like Marvin and Tammi
The jam of the decade, so overdose
Jump on the good foot, dance comatose, ah!

[Thes One] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Thes One]
The hipsters too cool, and having funs too weird
He got cant-dance pants and a cant-dance beer
Grew up in a cant-dance house
To a cant-dance mom who wore a cant-dance blouse
He needs to have fun, he got a cant-dance trust fund
If I was his dad, Id kill my cant-dance son. Good riddance!
P.U.T.S., good rhythms, party people get with em, say, Ho!

[Verse 5: Double K]
See, I was born and raised in the ghetto
Ate the Aunt Jemima and Nabisco
They say I do my thing at the disco
And keep the groove real slick like Crisco
Ceremonial conductor of the rhythm, one time
Peep: my hands move fast under lights that shine
All the girls know me, and all the fellas act jealous
So G, Reggie Wells, without the sales and tales
Get the folks overzealous, what they tell us? ([Sung sample:] Oh, yeah!)

[Verse 6: Thes One]
Its the party of the year, right here, right now, Kapowski
Heartthrob, be a teenager, like, Wow, dude! Im down, dude!
Fuck it, who cares, tonight youre partying with People Under The Stairs

[Thes One]
break it down
Break, break it down, break it down, break it down
Break, break it down, break it down, break it down
Break, break it down, break it down, and set it off
Break, break it down, break it down, break it down
Break, break it down, break it down, break it down
Break-a, break it down, straight set it off, set it off
Party people, straight set it off, set it off
My city, are you wit me?
Jump around the floor and get busy
Got the kid stone-trippin at the disco
Got the kid stone-trippin at the disco
My city, are you wit me?
Jump around the floor and get busy
Got the kid stone-trippin at the disco
Got the kid stone-trippin at the disco

[Double K]
