[Verse 1]
Cigarettes recommended
"Need a light to use?" said the lady in blue
After the rain

[Verse 2]
What is left? What is right?
"You may understand, I left the right man"
Said the lady in blue, "I left the right man"

[Chorus]
Boys play well into midnight
"Can I join you?" said the lady in blue
After the rain

[Verse 3]
"Pillow cold, but she won't stray into other lands," he said
"Take my hand," to the lady in blue
"You wronged the right man"

[Verse 4]
Cigarettes recommended
"Need a light to use?" said the lady in blue
"I wronged the right man"

[Chorus]
Boys play well into midnight
"Can I join you?" said the lady in blue
After the rain

[Chorus]
Boys, you play well into midnight
"Can I join you?"
Said the lady in blue

[Post-Chorus]
Said the lady in blue
Said the lady in blue
"I can play too"

[Outro]
For you I will play, lady in blue
For you, if you want me to, I will play, lady
Lady in blue, if you want me to
I will play, play for you, lady
Lady in blue
