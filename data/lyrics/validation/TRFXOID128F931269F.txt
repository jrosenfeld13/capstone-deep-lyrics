The sky is crying, look at the tears rolling down the streets
The sky is crying, look at the tears rolling down the streets
I just looked out my window, rain was falling down in sheets

My baby left me this morning, I don't know the reason why
My baby left me this morning, I don't know the reason why
Everytime I think about it, I hang my head and cry



The sun is shining although it's raining in my heart
The sun is shining although it's raining in my heart
I love my baby, I hate to see us part



Have you ever loved a woman and you know you can't leave her alone ?
Something deep inside of you won't let you wreck your very best home



I got rambling, I got rambling all on my mind
I got rambling, Lord knows, I got rambling all on my mind
I hates to leave my baby but she treats me so unkind
