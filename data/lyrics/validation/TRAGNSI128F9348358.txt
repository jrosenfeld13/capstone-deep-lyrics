[Chorus]
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care
Martha's gone away

[Verse 1]
Rod-a, he ride him and he jumped a ditch
He ride-a, he rode him, and the pony did pitch
The pony, he felt a little bit shy
'Cause he's bitten by that blue-tailed fly

[Chorus]
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care
Martha's gone away

[Verse 2]
When I was down in Louisiana
I stayed a little while in Texarkana
Every once in a while, I felt a little bit shy
'Cause I was bitten by that blue-tailed fly

[Chorus]
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care
Jimmy cracks corn and I don't care
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care
Martha's gone away

[Verse 3]
I was on my to Shreveport, Louisiana
Then I stopped out in Caspiana
And I felt a little bit shy
'Cause I was bitten by that blue-tailed fly

[Chorus]
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care
Martha's gone away

[Verse 4]
When I was drivin' along in my car
I would stop most anywhere
Once in while I look up in the sky
'Cause I was bitten by that blue-tailed fly

[Chorus]
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care
Martha's gone away

[Verse 5]
Once in a while I do a little bit o'dance
And some of the people come around and says, "Will you allow me a little chance?"
But every once in a while I feel a little bit shy
'Cause I was bitten by that blue-tailed fly

[Chorus]
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care
Martha's gone away, yes
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care
Martha's gone away
