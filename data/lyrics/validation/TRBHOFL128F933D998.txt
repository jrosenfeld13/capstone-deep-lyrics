Black maybe
Or maybe it's just what you say
Black maybe
Or maybe this is just your color for the day
You've seen the way they've done your boy
And your boy's still down
After 300 years
Black maybe
You better come 'round
Black maybe
Or maybe you just talking trash
Black maybe
Or maybe your color I'd better not ask
You've seen the way they've done your boy
And your boy's still crying
For days in and days out
Black woman, you better wash your man's tears away
Maybe you're red
Or maybe you're green
But your real color
I've never seen
Oh
Black maybe
Or maybe you just talking trash
Tell me, black maybe
Or really would you rather for me not to ask?
You see, the time is running out
And your man's been sad
For ages and ages and ages
Black maybe
It's time for you to wake up
Come around
Come around
