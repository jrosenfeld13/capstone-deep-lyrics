I could have loved you but I couldn't lie
Even if you asked me to
I could have fooled you from the very start
Carried on deceiving you

But time let me down
Turned my whole world around
And I stayed for too long

Where the hell did I go wrong?
Won't you tell me?
I didn't want you to know
Where the hell did I go wrong?

You saw right through me but you didn't care
Love was just a game to you
You started something that I couldn't stop
Even if I wanted to

I was lost in your smile
And my heart couldn't hide
It was you all along

Where the hell did I go wrong?
Won't you tell me?
I didn't want you to know
Where the hell did I go wrong?

I don't know if I should laugh or if I should cry
I know I've fallen in love and I don't know why
But I know I'm alive

Where the hell did I go wrong?
Won't you tell me?
I didn't want you to know
Where the hell did I go wrong?
