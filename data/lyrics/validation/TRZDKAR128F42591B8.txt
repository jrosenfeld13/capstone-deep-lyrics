[Tom DeLonge]
The building turned it's back ignored my call
The concrete looks too thin to break my fall
The sunset stretched across this nighttime scene
I counted people as I neared the street below
Whoa-oa-oa
Below
Whoa-oa-oa

[Mark Hoppus]
I saw it all, I saw it all go down
The shadow grew as he approached the ground
The sunset stretched across this nighttime scene
I turned away as he came near the street below
Whoa-oa-oa
Below
Whoa-oa-oa
Below
