The best chance to pick fights
Is in the midwest
With your mouth fat
On your own words
In the parking lots
Of the worst clubs
With fresh laid asphault
And flourescent lights that flicker
While the boys drink courage
And the girls show their navals and toes
You don't need no curses
No squinched up nose
Or turned up top lip
No cut throat kicking
Kids' sandcastles
Spit, and "fuck you" talk
You need only to arrive
At your own show in
Glasses and open-toe sandals
And step out the van all
Weak with a tour-worn voice
When you try to speak
With your mouth fat
On your own words
But you can't be heard
Over the noise of the opening act
Some wack rapper coming off c.d
Could've been me
Back before we
Practiced for the mush tour
