Sugarfoot's got two hands just as long as he can see
One hand in the birdfeed and a hand in the apple tree
He stands in line just a little behind the yellow moon that hangs
He's all tangled and he broke his sticks on the links of his own chain gang

You ought to see this home that he owns it's like a box of jewelry
He's got his own church bell in his bed it lays in a gallery
And all the colors they shine like flames comin' in through the window pane
End up gettin' checked over twice for the reds of someone's veins

So cold and blown all apart
So cold and needin' of a heart

He stands alone on top of his home where all the bluebirds flown
Sucks in on his cheeks and he cries as he moans through the saxophone
Reaches high with his hands in the sky puts his fingers right into the storm
Always one to stand under the moon and blow on his own horn
Yet anyone with anything has already begun to think that somebody down there knows
Just how he sat down on his knees in the dirt buried someone's rainbow

So cold and blown all apart
So cold and needin' of a heart
So cold and blown all apart
So cold and needin' of a heart

Well I know you ain't my enemy the only one's inside of me is killin' me getting free
I hear he wants my head with an old ice pick and fix me up on a stick
And all I've ever gotta be is anything I wanna be and Sugarfoot disagrees
He still stands tall underneath that apple tree man, he's still watchin' me

His chain gang is tryin'a pull me down like the birds and the fireflies
They shoot arrows up into the sky and they burn all the feathers dry
He only wants to fill his belly up with rocks 'till it hurts, then he stops
He don't know what to do with love if it don't fill his belly to the top

So cold and blown all apart
So cold and needin' of a heart

So cold and blown all apart
So cold and needin' of a heart
