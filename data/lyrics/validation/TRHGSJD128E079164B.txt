I'm into something
Something really cool
Mr DJ's got me started
I got my eyes set on you

I feel fine
The dancefloor is mine
I'm moving to the Dj playing beats
Watch me, move my body
You're feelin' like you wanna leave yourself

I got my boots on
I'm feeling mighty strong
As I ride all upon you
Baby bring it on
How you diggin' that?
You like my cowboy hat?
I dance like a kitty-cat
Hey y'all, this beat's phat

Wanna come along for the ride
Cos i know that its good love
You got me whoopin over you
If you wanna let me drive
Its alright, coz its good love
You got me whoopin' over you
Let me tell you something
You know you got me whoopin' over you
(You got me whoopin')
You got me whoopin' over you

I'm completely different
A funk diva on the floor
I'm not quite like the other girls
Now i want you even more
Ooh you're bad to the bone

Is this where you wanna be
Can you feel it in your feet
How you diggin' that?
Do you like my cowboy hat?
I dance like a kitty-cat
Hey y'all, this beat's phat

Wanna come along for the ride
Cos i know that its good love
You got me whoopin over you
If you wanna let me drive
Its alright, coz its good love
You got me whoopin' over you
Let me tell you something
You know you got me whoopin' over you
(You got me whoopin')
You got me whoopin' over you

Say what, say what
Na na now
Say what, say what
Na na now
Say what, say what
Say what, Na na now
Say what, say what
Na na now

I got my boots on
I'm feeling mighty strong
As i ride all upon you
Baby bring it on
How you diggin' that?
Do you like my cowboy hat?
I dance like a kitty-cat
Hey y'all, this beat's phat

Wanna come along for the ride
Cos i know that its good love
You got me whoopin over you
If you wanna let me drive
Its alright, coz its good love
You got me whoopin' over you
Let me tell you something
You know you got me whoopin' over you
(You got me whoopin')
You got me whoopin' over you
You got me whoopin' over you
(You got me whoopin')
You got me whoopin' over you
