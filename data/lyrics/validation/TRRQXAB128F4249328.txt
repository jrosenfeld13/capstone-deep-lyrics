We fell so far from home
Conscious of all the questions you will never ask
I'll wait and see if you can ever reach a different ending
I'm holding my breath, and we don't have long
But we are ok
Tonight is the only thing that matters
It's everything you've ever wanted
But we are ok
And even as the world dissolves around us
We'll sit inside and watch it all come down
Don't worry babe, we can work it out
What have they done?
Is this the only choice for us to completely give in
How could this happen?
For all we know this could have all been planned a long time ago
So why be alone? We won't be alone...
But we are ok
Tonight is the only thing that matters
It's everything you've ever wanted
But we are ok
And even as the world dissolves around us
We'll sit inside and watch it all come down
Let the tide walk alone
Rely on no one to pull it in
Did you think that it would be different?
So did I...
But we are ok
Tonight is the only thing that matters
It's everything you've ever wanted
But we are ok
And even as the world dissolves around us
We'll sit inside and watch it all come down
Even as the world dissolves around us we will watch it all come down
