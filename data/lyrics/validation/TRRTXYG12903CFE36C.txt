[Verse 1]
Helping the kids out of their coats
But wait the babies haven't been bor-or-or-or-or-orn, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Unpacking the bags and setting up
And planting lilacs and buttercu-u-u-u-u-u-ups, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
But in the meantime I've got it hard
Second floor living without a yard
It may be years until the day
My dreams will match up with my pay

[Chorus]
O-o-o-o-o-o-old dirt road (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Knee-e-e-e-e-e-e deep snow (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Watching the fire as we grow (mushaboom, mushaboom)
O-o-o-o-o-o-old

[Verse 2]
I've got a man to stick it out
And make a home from a rented hou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ouse, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
And we'll collect the moments one by one
I guess that's how the future's do-o-o-o-o-o-one, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
How many acres how much light
Tucked in the woods and out of sight
Talk to the neighbours and tip my cap
On a little road barely on the map

[Chorus]
O-o-o-o-o-o-old dirt road (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Knee-e-e-e-e-e-e deep snow (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Watching the fire as we grow (mushaboom, mushaboom)
O-o-o-o-o-o-old (mushaboom, mushaboom)

[Outro]
O-o-o-o-o-o-old diiiiiiirt road
Ra-a-a-a-a-a-ambling rose (mushaboom, mushaboom)
Watching the fire as we grow (mushaboom, mushaboom)
We-e-e-e-e-e-ell earned soul
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh
(Ohhhhhhhhhhh)
(Ohhhhhhhhhhh)
