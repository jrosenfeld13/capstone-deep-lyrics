Muted familiar fragrances
Distant fleeting recollections
This beauty I had come to know
Shatters
Then recedes
In brittle air

Aimless vagrant waters
Draw me out with the tide
Gasping, slowing descending
Screaming toward the shore

Painful persistent images
Disrupts my sleep
Intrudes in dreams
Faint droning echoes within the walls
Veiled reminders
Of regret time will hold
