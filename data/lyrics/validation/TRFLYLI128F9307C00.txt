Talk about love
How it makes life complete
You can talk all you want
Make it sound good and sweet

But the words have an empty ring
And they don't really mean a thing
Without love you are not to be found
You are not to be found

For love is surrender
You must surrender if you care
You must surrender if you dare

Shout about love
And the wars will all end
You can shout, "We're all brothers"
And even pretend

But you can't cover up the past
Just pretending will never last
Without love you are nothing at all
You are nothing at all

For love is surrender
You must surrender if you care
You must surrender if you dare

For love is surrender
You must surrender if you care
You must surrender if you dare

Da-a-a-re!
