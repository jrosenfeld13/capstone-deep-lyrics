Once i lived the life of a millionaire
Spent all my money just did not care
Took all my friends out for a good time
Bought bootleg whisky champagne and wine
Then i began to fall so low
Lost all my good friends i did not have nowhere to go
If i get my hands on a dollar again
I'm going to hang on to it till that eagle grins
Because nobody loves you when you're down and out
In your pocket not one penny
And as for friends you don't have many
When you finally get back upon your feet again
Everybody wants to be your good old long lost friend
Said it's mighty strange without a doubt
Nobody knows you when you're down and out
