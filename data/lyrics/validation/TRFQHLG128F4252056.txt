In the night time
I can feel it
I can tell it
I can sell it
In the night time
I can see it
I just wanna be it
So I can yell it

Has everybody in this town
Gone crazy or what?

In the night time
I can hear it
I can feel it
I can tell it
In the night time
I can't hide it
I'm not gonna fight it
I just wanna ride it

Has everybody in this town
Gone crazy or what?
