Dream, when you're feelin' blue
Dream, that's the thing to do

Just watch the smoke rings rise in the air
You'll find your share of memories there

So, dream when the day is through
Dream, and they might come true

Things never are as bad as they seem
So dream, dream, dream

Things never are as bad as they seem
So dream, dream, dream
