Uptown girl
She's been living in her uptown world
I bet she never had a backstreet guy
Bet her mamma never told her why

I'm gonna try for an uptown girl
She's been living in her white bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man, that's what I am

And when she knows what she wants from her time
And when she wakes up she makes up her mind
She'll see I'm not so tough
Just because I'm in love

With an uptown girl
You know I've seen her in her uptown world
She's getting tired of her high-class toys
And all her presents from her uptown boys, she's got a choice

Uptown girl
You know I can't afford to buy her pearls
But maybe someday when my ship comes in
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been, and then I'll win

And when she's walking she's looking so fine
And when she wakes up she makes up her mind
She'll see I'm not so tough
Just because I'm in love

With an uptown girl
She's been living in her white bread world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now she's looking for a downtown man, that's what I am

Uptown girl (uptown girl) my uptown girl (uptown girl) you know I'm in love
With an uptown girl (uptown girl) my uptown girl (uptown girl) you know I'm in love
With an uptown girl (uptown girl) yeay yeay uptown girl (uptown girl)
My uptown girl (uptown girl)

Let me hear ya, motherfucker! One more time, yeay! Yeay! Yeay!
