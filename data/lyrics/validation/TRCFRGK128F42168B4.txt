[Verse 1]
Fear and panic in the air
I want to be free
From desolation and despair
And I feel like everything I sow
Is being swept away
Well I refuse to let you go

[Pre-Refrain]
I can't get it right
Get it right
Since I met you

[Refrain]
Loneliness be over
When will this loneliness be over?

[Verse 2]
Life will flash before my eyes
So scattered and lost
I want to touch the other side
And no one thinks they are to blame
Why can't we see
That when we bleed we bleed the same?

[Pre-Refrain]
I can't get it right
Get it right
Since I met you

[Refrain]
Loneliness be over
When will this loneliness be over?
Loneliness be over
When will this loneliness be over?
