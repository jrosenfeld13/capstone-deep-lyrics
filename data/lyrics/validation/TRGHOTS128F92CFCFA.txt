She's so hard on my love
She's so hard on my love
She's so hard on my love
She's so hard on my love

Her name was Jessica, I met her in the bathroom
It was on it was off, it was good it was bad,it was...yeah
I took her to the movies, had a little popcorn
And I guess when I looked at her shirt, just cus'

She's so hard on my love
She's so hard on my love
She's so hard on my love
She's so hard on my love

All you got to do is
Lay with me, come and stay with me, baby
All you got to do is
Lay with me, come and stay with me, baby

Six months later, ain't nothin' new going on here
I ain't kissed on your lips
Since the last time you heard from me

You're so hard on my love
You're so hard on my love
You're so hard on my love
You're so hard on my love

All you got to do is
Lay with me, come and stay with me, baby
All you got to do is
Lay with me, come and stay with me, baby
Oh

I don't wanna lose you
But I don't wanna get lost
It'd be easy to see eye to eye
If you'd come down off your high horse
Hey

All you got to do is
Lay with me, come and stay with me, baby
All you got to do is
Lay with me, come and stay with me, baby
Oh

She's so hard on my love
She's so hard on my love
She's so hard on my love
She's so hard on my love
