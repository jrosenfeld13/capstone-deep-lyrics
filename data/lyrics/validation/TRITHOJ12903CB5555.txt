I am so wide awake
So wired and I don't like this state
I'm seein' into spots
That narrow into places inside

I fought for what I got
And when I sleep the dust remains
I won't go when you go and where it takes you no one knows

Oh now and you come 'round and you often do
We go lookin' for illusions, anything at all, anything at all
All the spaces that we cover and we often do
And do  (?) back to where
Where we started from
All these spaces that we cover and we often do
And (?) back to where
Where we started from

The spaces on the trail
I'm tryin' to hear what you say
The spaces on the wall
I'm tryin' to see what you see
I fought for what I got
And when I sleep the dust remains
I won't go and when you go and where it takes you no one knows

(Chorus)

Oh I got this feeling that were going in circles too
Going back around and I don't know what to do
Take it all down
Take it all down
Take it all down
Tear it all down
