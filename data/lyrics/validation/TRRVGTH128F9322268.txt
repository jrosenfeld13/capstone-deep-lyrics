Come in close come in tight
Taste my neck and take a bite
Be the vampire saints you are
Stab it right into my heart
Cut my skin upon your teeth
Cut the muscle underneath
We're not animals at all
Only marching to the call
When the saints go marching in
We'll be walking right beside them
Wanna taste it on my tongue
Breathe it right into my lungs
Taste the blood and sweat like wine
Bite the fruit right off the wine
Stretch out like you're crucified
On the altar of my eye
Resurrect my beaten soul
Turn my metal heart to Gold
When the saints go marching in
We'll be walking right beside them
Come in close come in tight
One more dance before we die
Be the vampire saints you are
Stab it right into my heart
RED BLOOD RED BLOOD RED BLOOD RED BLOOD RED BLOOD RED BLOOD RED BLOOD RED BLOOD RED!
