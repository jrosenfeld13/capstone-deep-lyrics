[Verse 1]
I had tried my best to find you
Through the fields and forest floor
I have waited in the silence
And knocks upon the door
I have stumbled through the alley
In a place I did not know
If it's all the same to you, love
I will take the last train home

[Verse 2]
I have cursed you in the morning
I have laid awake at night
I have begged for your forgiveness
To avoid a fight
I have held on to my anger
Watched the sunset on my pride
If it's all the same to you, love
Leave and pass me by
Woah, woah

Honey don't you listen
Don't?
Fills the air around us
Let it go
Honey hear the silence
We'll be still
You may know
You're not on your own

[Verse 3]
It was as if in a nightmare
Hoping this would disappear
There was no one else around me
As it became clear
There is nothing worse I know of
To spend our lives around
If it's all the same to you, love
Take the last train home
If it's all the same to you, love
Take the last train home
If it's all the same to you, love
