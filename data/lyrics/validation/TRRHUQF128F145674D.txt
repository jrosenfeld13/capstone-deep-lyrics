(S. Van Zandt)

I had the craziest dream last night
There was thunder and lightning everywhere
Hellhounds reached up and ripped a hole in the sky
Pissed in the water and spit black smoke up in the air

Demons were chasing me all tattooed
In dollar signs, suits and ties
They wanted me to party
I woke up just in time
I heard somebody say

Better days are comin'
We're gonna wake up and break this curse
Better days are on the way
'Cause you know and I know
It can't get no worse

Sometimes the dream seems so real
Comes to me over and over again
Last night I swear I saw America sleeping in the streets
When does this nightmare end?

I got to find my baby
Maybe I'll find salvation in her kiss
Tell me I'm dreaming
It's got to get better than this
I want somebody to say

Better days are comin'
We're gonna wake up and break this curse
Better days are on the way
'Cause you know and I know
It can't get no worse

I believe I see a train coming
I know it's time to take a ride
Shattered dreams and broken promises
We gotta leave 'em all behind
'Cause you know
We're gonna catch that train, baby
We're gonna catch that train
We're gonna catch that train
I know we're gonna catch that train
Whooa yea

Better days are comin'
We're gonna wake up and break this curse
Better days are on the way
'Cause you know and I know
It can't get no worse
