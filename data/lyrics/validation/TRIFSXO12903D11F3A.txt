I go away*
Leave me alone she said
... too soon
She'll make you play
You said you go
But I
I gotta prove it to you
She'll push me
Over the edge
You know
I know where to push
I had enough
Cause I've done it to you
And now I'm feeling the bruse

[Chorus:]
Tell the world
Tell the world
I'm holdin' on
And tell the world
Tell the world
I'm growing strong
Yeah
Movin' on
Thinkin' of you
And you
You're not thinkin' of me
When you take it on
...
...
We will be friends
Play me for a fool
You know I'm changing the game
I let you know
It's not up to you
For givin' in too

[Chorus]
[Solo]

[Chorus]
We'll tell the world
Tell the world
We'll tell the world
Tell the world
We'll tell the world
Tell the world
We'll tell the world
