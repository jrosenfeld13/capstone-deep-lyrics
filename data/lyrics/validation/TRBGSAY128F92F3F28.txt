[Verse 1]
It's night, again
Time for my mind to go wandering
Off on a journey, through space and time
In search of a face I can never find
So I close my eyes and look inside
I can't forget
The night that I saw her we never met
She felt so close to me as I reached for her hand
She drifted away like the desert sand
It was her and she was gone
I wish she'd come back tonight
Like a star shining bright
I don't know where she's from

[Chorus]
She's like a girl on the moon
A girl on the moon
She's like a girl on the moon
A girl on the moon

[Verse 2]
Yeah it's night, once again
And that same old feeling is setting in
It all seems so familiar but I hope this time
That the girl on the moon will soon be mine
All mine, tonight
Am I asking too much
Should I leave my dream untouched
Should I even know where she's from

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Fille sur la lune
Girl on the moon
Fille sur la lune
