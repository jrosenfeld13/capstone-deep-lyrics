The plan is intact
From the front to the back
All that's left now
Is waiting for you

So do what you can
For blood and for land
And it's alright
Yeah
It's alright

All that's left is execution, now
We just pray in the shadows of the south
For the moment to pass
Faith moves from the heart to the soul
Overpowers and it loses all control
We're waiting for you

Come in, come in
It's all within in reach
And it's alright, alright, alright
Get on with it
It's falling at your feet
Beg your conscience
But it's alright, alright, alright

Head down we'll get on with this life
Hold fast find a place in time
For the moment to last
Lit fuse running out of air
False start but momentum doesn't care
We're waiting for you

Come in, come in
It's all within in reach
And it's alright, alright, alright
Get on with it
It's falling at your feet
Beg your conscience
But it's alright, alright, alright

The plan is intact
From the front to the back
All that's left now
Is waiting for you

So do what you can
For blood and for land
All that's left now
Is waiting for you

Come in, come in
It's all within in reach
And it's alright, alright, alright
Get on with it
It's falling at your feet
Beg your conscience
But it's alright, alright, alright

It's alright
