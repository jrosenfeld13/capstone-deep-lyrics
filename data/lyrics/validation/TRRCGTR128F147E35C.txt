Good God, where does it end?
You have been waiting in line
To have a phone chord or a cable fed right down your throat
Don't struggle or it will bend and be a waste of time
To drain the depth of you from somewhere there
You'll only choke
What seems to be the problem? We can't dig up anything
Only dust and spit, and some pictures of you
You're choking on the wires and still trying to sing
It seems that no one could ever love you
As much as you do

Hey misses hopeless, the world will catch up
With your intrepidness, I hope you know this
There's no one like you, it's so oppressive
You can even spell your own name, how impressive

I want what I see, I want something shiny
I want the one who stand in front of the biggest crowds
If we are to be, there will be more eyes on me
There will be more for everyone to talk about
It all leads to me, independent and free
It all comes back to who will say what I want them to say
Not complicated, keep it simply stated
There's only so much that I can understand
Before it's all wasting away

Hey misses hopeless, the world will catch up
With your intrepidness, I hope you know this
There's no one like you, it's so oppressive
You can even spell your own name, how impressive

But don't forget I can have what I want
And I want to be everything and everywhere

Say I'm smart, say my skirt is so short
Say I'm different, say I'm one of a kind
If I'm on TV maybe you will love me
There's not another reason I can find
And if you only reject, there's still these tubes in my neck
There's still cigarettes and four letter words
And I'm sure that you'll pick such a plain jane
To think the world goes on without me just seems so absurd

Hey misses hopeless, the world will catch up
With your intrepidness, I hope you know this
There's no one like you, it's so oppressive
You can even spell your own name, how impressive

Hey misses hopeless, the world will catch up
With your intrepidness, I hope you know this
There's no one like you, it's so oppressive
You can even spell your own name, how impressive
