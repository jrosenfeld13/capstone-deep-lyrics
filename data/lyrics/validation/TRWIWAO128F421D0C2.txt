There's a place inside of me
Where my demons are singing for me
Their voices are enticing
I try not to give, give in to them

Oh, I will strike back
Oh, I will strike back
Oh, I will strike back
Oh, I will strike back

There's a place inside of me
Where my demons are singing for me
Their voices are enticing
I try not to give, give in to them

Oh, I will strike back
Oh, I will strike back
Oh, I will strike back
Oh, I will strike back
