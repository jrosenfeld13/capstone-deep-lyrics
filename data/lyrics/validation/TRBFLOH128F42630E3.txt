Today I saw somebody
Who looked just like you
He walked like you do
I thought it was you

As he turned the corner
I called out your name
I felt so ashamed
When it wasn't you
Wasn't you

You are everything
Everything is you
Oh you are everything
Everything is you

Oh you are everything
Everything is you

How can I forget
When each face that I see
Brings back memories
Of being with you?

I just can't go on livin' life as I do
Comparing each boy to you babe
No, no they just won't do
No, no, no, no, no, no they're not you

You are everything
Everything is you
Oh you are everything
Everything is you

Oh you are everything
Everything is you

You are everything
Everything is you
Everything is you

You are everything
Everything is you

You are everything
Everything is you
Oh you are
Ooh everything is you

Oh you are everything
Everything is you
Oh you are
Everything is you

You are everything
Everything is you
Oh you are
Ooh everything is you
