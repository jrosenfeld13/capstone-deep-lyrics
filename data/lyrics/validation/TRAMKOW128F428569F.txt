Did you see the grizzly bear
Roving over the floodplain?
Richard Henry Dana did
I read about it and it stuck in my brain
Did you see the river flow
Clear down to Baja Mexico?
John Wesley Powell most certainly did
I read about it when I was a kid
Time-sick son of a grizzly bear
I can't fit in anywhere
I'm a time-sick son of a grizzly bear
Were you at old Monterey
In Joaquin Murrieta's day?
Adobe huts in the cypress grove
Is where the rich men now build their homes
Time-sick son of a grizzly bear
Can't seem to find myself anywhere
I'm a time-sick son of a grizzly bear
