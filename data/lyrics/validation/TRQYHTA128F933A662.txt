[Verse 1 - Hollow Tip]
I'm loccing up on you busters
Bitch made Nigga's in the game gettin' crossed
When I floss with my Nine I'm in range
No more brains. You kinda like fucked with your strap tucked
Under your Khak's on your back, you go tryin' to duck
Another victim had to stick him with the dandy mate
SK start spittin' got it rippin' off the candy paint
Another tragedy so gangsta' don't get mad at me
Because you wanted funk and I brought it to your family
You Nigga's can't handle me when I'm flashin' showin' chrome
Got the M-I Carbine cocked blowin' Domes
The war zone and I ride up in the center, strike
And poppin' them clips tryin' not to slip and get hit with life
And I'm on a mission can't be slippin' when I'm dishin' shells
Cus if I do I might be through until my soul bails
So many soldiers fake, so they break and they bodies shake
The yellow tape is all it take to know we ain't no Grape
Another Nigga served face down on the curb
With a MAC spit his back split and paralyze his nerve
That's how it is, skulls crack leavin' Nigga's dead
All you see is that dead G, R.I.P. Hella brains and Bloodshed
It's goin' down so pack your hollow tips and extra clips
Cus when its on its do or die if you wanna slip

[Verse 2 - Hollow Tip]
Round 2, straps cap in a mist of violence
Nigga's be slippin', chests be rippin' left in eternal silence
Nigga's be swearin' that they hardcore
Reachin' for they .44 and get they backs pent up on that car door
I'm creepin' up from behind with the black TEC
His heart flew to the left when I blew his spine through his chest
Another mind died blindside young killin'
It ain't no feelin' signed off and smoke him up like villains
My strap is peelin' any Nigga that think he willin'
Already made that decision or had a feelin' for no longer livin'
That's how I think, put you on your back before you blink
Fuck the enemy, pop the Hennessy and take a drink
And now I'm gone in the zone feelin' half dead
Hold a pump up out the window leavin' bodies half red
Point blank range straps sang callin' for your brains
Niggas get banged then they heart beat start to change
Pleadin' for help but your mark ass homies already broke
Bangin' ain't no joke, leave your stranded at the end of the rope
It ain't no hope for you mark ass Nigga's with no stripes
Busters ain't no factor, you just another took life
Slippin' is the way ya mark, so they pistol whipped in the dark
Lock him in the trunk for the bark, slap the old school out of park
That's how it is when it's on catch these R.I.P's
Stay out my path or get blasted by this Highland's G
