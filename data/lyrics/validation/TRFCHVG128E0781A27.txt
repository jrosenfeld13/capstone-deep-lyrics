Secret squirrel splashes in
Sirens warn Tsunami
Secret's come to save us all
Sirens warn eminent doom
He can breathe in water yeah
And super tail can stop the danger

No one moves quite like you do
Secret how do you do it

I just fly I come sailin in
Like it's sunny skies
I know I'll always win

So I see you came secret squirrel's a shame
You will have to die

Final round

Will he conquer the world?
Tune in next week and see
Secret squirrel save you and me
