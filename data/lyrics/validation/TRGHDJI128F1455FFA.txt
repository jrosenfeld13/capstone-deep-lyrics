1. Every little thing's been said about it
How does it apply to you?
Maybe I could learn to live without it
Where do you find, one of a kind
Playing for time the way you do?
2. Every other day I think about it
Do you remember when?
You said we'd never be without it
Where do you find, one of a kind
Playing for time the way you do?
Maybe I'll find love the way you do
Maybe I'll find love the way you do
Playing for time love the way you do
The way you do. The way you do
3. Everybody says I'm mad to doubt it
And I believe it's true
Maybe I should learn to live without it
But, where do you find, one of a kind
Playing for time the way you do?
Maybe I'll find love the way you do
Maybe I'll find love the way you do
Or maybe goodbye love the way you do
The way you do. The way you do
