Serenade the night runs out
As the moment fades we're wearing down
Celebrate, i don't know how
I can keep this up
Keep you around
As long as it tastes so bittersweet

I'm sorry louise
I didn't mean it louise
I need a favor
Let go of my hand
I won't lead you around
Oh please louise

Self-esteem eludes your reach
So the maybelline becomes a routine
Do you believe geography is the chemistry in our tragic scene
As long as it tastes to bittersweet

I'm sorry louise
I didn't mean it louise
I need a favor
Let go of my hand
I won't lead you around
Oh please louise

Louise
I didn't mean it louise
I need a favor
Let go of my head
I won't lead you around
Oh please...oh...
