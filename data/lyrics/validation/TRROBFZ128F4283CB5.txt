You know they jockin', but I don't, really give a damn what theys in for
Cause what we had, was special, and enough to make me never wanna leave home
Maybe you're right, and I'm wrong, I was too young to notice, I know it looks bad, but we don't have to deal with our problems alone

Now that I'm here, would you stop cryin'?
Have no fear, cause I'm a start tryin'
It's okay, without you I'm dyin'
And I can't let it end, so girl I'm checkin' in
Somebody call the doctor, shawty tryna give me a heart attack
Somebody call the doctor, & perscribe me somethin' that'll show me how to act when she's gone
Woahh woahh. when she's gone

I won't, I can't go on
When you left girl it felt like, my heart stopped beating, and my lungs stopped breathin' and baby you're the reason that I
I've got to do right, the truth is that I, I ain't worth a damn without you
Just wanna take the time, to slow it down, and cherish every moment that you're around
Let me change your mind, about me now, and show you what my love is about
Now that I'm here, would you stop cryin'?
Have no fear, cause I'm a start tryin'
It's okay, without you I'm dyin'
And I can't let it end, so girl I'm checkin' in

I was in my old school, she was in the escalade
She pulled off on the exit, then I pulled up next to her
No time for flexin now, I knew I had to get next to her
All black she love shades

Could tell how I'm jockin' she could have me if she wanted me
Now that I got her I'm a need a doctor if she leave me
