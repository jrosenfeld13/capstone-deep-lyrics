You open up this heart of mine
You see beyond this restless mind
There's so much magic in this day
I wanna shout it out
I wanna laugh out loud
I wanna shout it out
The everlasting gaze you have
The love of everything you share
There's so much magic in this day
I wanna shout it out
I wanna laugh out loud
I wanna shout it out
This love is hurling me across the world
This love is leaving me dazed in this new world
Close up you don't even see it
Close up you don't even hear it
Right up you don't even know it
You never say you don't even see it escalating
Racing on...........
Open up open up......
This love is hurling me across the world
This love is leaving me dazed in this new world
I wanna shout it out
I wanna laugh out loud
I wanna shout it out.....
