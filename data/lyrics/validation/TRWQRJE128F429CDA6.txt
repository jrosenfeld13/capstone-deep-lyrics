I was alright, for a while
I could smile for a while
But when I saw you last night
You held my hand so tight
As you stopped to say hello
Oh, you wished me well
And you couldn't tell
That I'd been
Nobody's got an answer
Crying over you
Crying over you

When you said so long
You left me standing all alone
Alone and crying
If we take it slow now and don't expect too much
Crying
Crying
I'm crying
It's hard to understand
That the touch of your hand
Could start me crying
Don't it make you ask yourself why
I thought that I was over you
But it's true, oh so true
I love you even more
Than I did before
But darling, what can I do
Cause you don't love me
And I'll always be
Don't it make you ask yourself why
Crying over you
Crying over you
And don't it make you wonder
And now that you're gone
And from this moment on
I'll be crying
Crying
Crying
Crying
I'm crying
I'm crying
Over you
