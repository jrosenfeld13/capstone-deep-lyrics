Mangiaracina-Pitney

Chorus
Hello, Mary Lou, goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou, I'm so in love with you
And I knew Mary Lou, we'd never part
So hello, Mary Lou, goodbye heart

You passed me by one sunny day
Flashed those big brown eyes my way
Ooh I wanted you forever more
Now I'm not one that gets around
I swear my feet stuck to the ground
And though I never did meet you before

[Chorus]
I saw your lips, I heard your voice
Believe me I just had no choice
Wild horses couldn't make me stay away
I thought about a moonlit night
My arms around you good and tight
All I had to see for me to say

[Chorus]
I saw your lips, I heard your voice
Believe me I just had no choice
Wild horses couldn't make me stay away
I thought about a moonlit night
My arms around you good and tight
All I had to see for me to say

[Chorus]
Yes hello, Mary Lou, goodbye heart
And hello, Mary Lou, goodbye heart
