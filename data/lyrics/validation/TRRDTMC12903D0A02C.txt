Close to insanity
Beyond the realms I've been
At darkest places
I'm crying
"The dragon flies"

Something savage
Is yearning for me
I'm waiting afraid for the night
What will be
I've lost myself
A few days ago
It's touching my soul
And a vision of past dreams comes true

Welcome to dying
I don't let it out
Welcome to dying
Look to the mirror it shows what I am
Welcome to dying
This town must burn now
Welcome to dying
Can't You see the dragon's seed bears in me

The one who's been before
Many times I terrorized this town
Many times and here I start again
Now I'm stronger and so cold
Cold as ice
Returning is my destiny
Now I feel it's growing up in me
Now I feel it's burning deep in me
I'm not what I was before
Could I stop this dream
I'm a stranger to myself
And I cannot control

Welcome to dying
I don't let it out
Welcome to dying
Look to the mirror it shows what I am
Welcome to dying
Can't you see the dragon's seed bears in me
Welcome to dying
The dragon's breath I don't let it out

I'm a savage
It's too late for me
The other side's taking control and I know
There's one way I can walk alone
Or the dragon will fly
And a growing fear's all that I feel

Welcome to dying
I don't let it out
Welcome to dying
Look to the mirror it shows what I am
Welcome to dying
This town must burn now
Welcome to dying
Can't You see the dragon's seed bears in me

Welcome to dying
Welcome to dying
Welcome to dying
Welcome to dying
Welcome to dying
Welcome to dying
Can't you see the dragon's seed bears in me

Spread my wings and fly away
I spread my wings and fly away
I spread my wings and fly away
