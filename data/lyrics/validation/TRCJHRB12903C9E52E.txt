Another face, another name
Stand in line, all the same
I've been here so many times
I don't know the reason why
I do want to live to tell
Chained inside this living hell
Cries of freedom never heard
I guess this is what I deserve

Who am I?
Alone in this world
Alone in this world
Without love
Without...

Eyes of sorrow, eyes of shame
Self destructions so insane
I don't care, just let me go
Let the veins of scarlett flow

Show me a sign
Unlock the door
Release me, I'm yours
Into the clouds
Higher,higher,higher...

I like to sit and think alone
I like to dream of coming home
Maybe now the voices sleep
This time...
