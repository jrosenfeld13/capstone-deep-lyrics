At an anarchist fortress in Roma
We laid in each other's arms on the stone
After all those nights and all of those fights
I never felt less alone

We stole all of the liquor and cocaine
At the mermaid in old New Orleans
The clowns ran the bar, and jack drove the car
It all smashed, c'est la vie

You are always surrounded by lovers
You are never as broke as you seem
But i might have fought for the wrong side
It was never this cold in my dreams

We stopped and picked sage in montana
Won big at the poker machine
Bought a round for the bar, twenty bucks goes pretty far
At only a dollar a dream

You are always surrounded by lovers
You are never as broke as you seem
I still think i fought for the right side
But it was never this cold in my dreams

Just call 'em nine musketeers, still more family than friends
I'll burn a candle to you in some great cathedral
Of course i'll burn it at both ends
Bonfires and bridges, beginnings and ends
Sometimes i don't even care what it all meant

But i never forgot my lines
I still hear them all the time
I always tried for the right side of life
But it was never this cold in my mind

You are always surrounded by lovers
And you are never as broke as you seem
But i might have fought for the wrong side
It was never this cold in my dreams
I might have fought for the wrong side
It was never this cold in my dreams
