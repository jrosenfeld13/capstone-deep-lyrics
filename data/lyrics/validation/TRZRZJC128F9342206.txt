I gotta have it, I gotta have it
I ain't got no control
It's a struggle, I'm in trouble
Like I've sold my soul
Once you try it, I wanna buy it
But it just ain't for sale
You got me so stung out
Don't need nothing else, no

Addicted
Said every single time
And every time you call my name
I can't resist it, can't quit it
It's much too much
And girl I must admit it
Feeling like this, want another hit, girl I need a fix
Addicted to your love I can't get enough

I don't need liquor, she's much quicker
You can keep your cocaine
She's my desire, gets me higher
Running straight through my veins, babe
One day without her's like I'm going insane, I'm so

Addicted
Said every single time
And every time you call my name
I can't resist it, can't quit it
It's much too much
And girl I must admit it
Feeling like this, want another hit, girl I need a fix

Addicted to your love I can't get enough

You're the dealer, I'm the junkie
Need you everyday
Whenever you're close I overdose
I like feeling this way
Rehabilitation's not an option for me
Your sweet intoxication is what's making me so

Addicted
Said every single time
And every time you call my name
I can't resist it, can't quit it
It's much too much
And girl I must admit it
Feeling like this, want another hit, girl I need a fix
Addicted to your love I can't get enough
Addicted to your love I can't get enough

Addicted
Said every single time
And every time you call my name
I can't resist it, can't quit it
It's much too much
And girl I must admit it
Feeling like this, want another hit, girl I need a fix
Addicted to your love I can't get enough, whoa no no no no
Can't get enough, whoa no no no no
