Everything that we said flew over your head
Live your life at the end of a runway
You were so head strong, never could be wrong
Things could only go, just one way
Here's some news for you, I don't think you'll like the truth, no
When your ball begins to roll, will you be able to pay the toll, man now
And when your ball begins to roll, will you be able to pay the toll, man now
The bridge is burning hot on your heels
You're the one that's burnt, well how does it feel?
You ought a teach us to boss the pro
But your all time high just became your worst low
Here's some news for you, you tied your own noose, yes you did
When your ball begins to roll, will you be able to pay the toll, man now
And when your ball begins to roll, will you be able to pay the toll, man now
Everything that we said flew over you head
Live your life at the end of a runway
You were so head strong, never could be wrong
Things could only go, one way
Here's some news for you, I knew you wouldn't like the truth, no
When the ball begins to roll, will you be able to pay the toll, man now
And when your ball begins to roll will you be able to pay the toll man now (x2)
