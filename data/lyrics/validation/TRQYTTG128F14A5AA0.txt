Wish upon a shooting star
For heightened contemplation of suicide
Kiss of death with a birth defect
Or eulogy gets the best of me
In this dark and scary world
These fucked up images control everything
Controlling my passion to lose it all
If you know what i mean

And i want you in my room
And i want you in my bed
Girl don't turn the lights off
I want to see your eyes
And i want you on my floor
And i want you one time more
Cause i can't get enough
You're so indiscreet so anonymous

Loaded words weigh down phrases
Holding too much clout
This conversations turned to rambling
This relationship has turned to nothing
So keep screaming baby
Cause i am wrong
And two can make it right

And i want you in my room
And i want you in my bed
Girl don't turn the lights off
I want to see your eyes
And i want you on my floor
And i want you one time more
Cause i can't get enough
You're so indiscreet so anonymous

And she's all mine

And i want you in my room
And i want you in my bed
Girl don't turn the lights off
I want to see your eyes
And i want you on my floor
And i want you one time more
Cause i can't get enough
