I want to be free, to fly like you
I want to be free, to walk, to stand, to start anew
Oh, to feel grace within these wings
We have been forgiven for all our memory of sin

Because we've waited so long to shine, to shine
This love is so strong, I'm flying, I'm high
On God's love

Oh, the taste of ruby wine on lips
Oh, to be hypnotized by the lying, swaying billboard hips
It is our souls to which the big machines are drawn
And it's money that fuels their hearts
There are no human dreams at all

Want you to drink your drink and lay your money down
But when you awaken, you will hear the sound around you sounding out
But I, I feel like you and I are just beginning to shine

Because we've waited so long to shine, to shine
This love is so strong, I'm flying, I'm high
On God's love

I pray for peace, or at least an open window
I want to be free, I'm free
To walk, to stand, to start anew
Oh, the feel of grace within these wings
We have been forgiven for all our memory of sin

'Cause we've waited so long to shine
This love is so strong, I'm flying, we're high on God's love
Got a lot of love, a love supreme
We've got a lot of love
Got a lot of love, a love supreme
We've got a lot of love
