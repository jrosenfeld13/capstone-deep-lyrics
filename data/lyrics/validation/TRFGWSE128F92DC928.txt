Let's rip it up

Well, Saturday night
And I just got paid
Fool about my money
Don't try to save

My heart says
Go, go, have a time
'Cause it's Saturday night
And, baby, I feel fine

[Chorus:]
I'm gonna rock it up
I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up
I'm gonna break it up
I'm gonna lock it up
At the ball tonight

Well, I got me a baby
And I won't be late
Pick her up in my 88

A shag going down
By the social hall
When the joint starts jumping
Gonna have me a ball

[Repeat Chorus]
Well, along about ten
I'm breezing high
I walk on out to
That groovy sky

But I don't care
If I spend my dough
'Cause tonight I'm gonna be
One happy soul

[Repeat Chorus]
Well, Saturday night
And I just got paid
Fool about my money
Don't try to save

My heart says
Go, go, have a time
'Cause it's Saturday night
And, baby, I feel fine

[Repeat Chorus]
Well, along about ten
I'm breezing high
I walk on out to
That groovy sky

But I don't care
If I spend my dough
'Cause tonight I'm gonna be
One happy soul

[Repeat Chorus]
