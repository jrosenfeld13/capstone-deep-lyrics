Eight weeks ago tonight we parted
It's so hard to realize we're through
When we quit you said you'll always love me
Now I wonder if you feel the way I do

I'll ne'er forget our days together
Even though we know they're very few
I loved you then and will forever
And I wonder if you feel the way I do

It's just strange to stand the sweetest love, dear
That two people ever knew
You told me that I need not weary
That forever you'd be true

Through this dreary world alone I wander
My thoughts will always be of you
But it seems to me there's no use livin'
If you feel the way I do
