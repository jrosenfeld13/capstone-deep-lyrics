Fuck this life
Bereft of free will
Once a man now a beast, an abomination
Looking through the eyes of a mind corrupted by hypocrisy
Now every sin I harbor inside become one with me

Nameless
No family to call my own
Helpless
Nobody to save me now
Hopeless
Could there be light beyond this hell I call home(x2)

Hate, war
Slowly becoming what I can only think about
My dungeon reeks of all the decomposing flesh of what seems to be
Heroes come and gone, slaughtered with no remorse

Innocent blood I crave
No sanity is found in me
No sanity found(x2)

Bereft of free will
Once a man, now a beast, an abomination
Looking through the eyes of a mind corrupted by hypocrisy
Now every sin I harbor inside become one with me

Human flesh enters the chamber
Emotionless, my meal a delicacy in this place
The chamber doors close, my mind corrodes
This seems to be a diabolical plan for extinction

This is pure hatred

Nameless
No family to call my own
Helpless
Nobody to save me now
Hopeless
Could there be light beyond this hell I call home(x2)

By the hands of an unknown lord
I am the highest threat to the future of mortality
This is pure fucking hatred
