[Verse 1]
I'll give you money
I'll give you loving
I'll give you everything
But heaven above
I'll give you all I have right now
I'll give you money
I'll give you loving
Everything

[Verse 2]
I'll give you kisses
Sweet as honey
I'll do you everything
'Cept make the sun shine
If I could change the world right now
Make you happy
Stop your crying
Everything
Everything

[Bridge]
All of my life, I've been dreaming
'Til you came my way
All of your life, aren't you searching
For love forever
All I need is someone to believe in me
Even if you're losing
What you left behind, everything

[Verse 3]
I think it's funny
Lost all my money
I threw it all away
But now I'm happy
I'll give you all my love right now
I'll give you money
I'll give you loving
Everything
Everything

[Outro]
Money- everything
Everything
Money- everything
Money- everything
Money- everything
Money- everything
Money- everything
Money- everything
Money- everything
Money- everything
