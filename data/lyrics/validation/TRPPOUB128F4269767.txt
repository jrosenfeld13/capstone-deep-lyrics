Do you not hear me anymore?
I know it's not your thing to care
I know it's cool to be so bored
It sucks me in when you're aloof
It sucks me in, it sucks it works
I guess it's cool to be alone

Do you never rest
Fighting the Battle of Who Could Care Less
Everyday you wake up late
Sometimes I wish I was that way

And you think Rockford Files is cool
But there are some things that you would change
If it were up to you
So think about your masterpiece (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Watch the Rockford Files
And call to see if Paul can score some weed

Will you never rest
Fighting the Battle of Who Could Care Less
Unearned unhappiness
That's all right I guess

I've got this great idea
Why don't we pitch it to the Franklin fucking Mint?
Fine pewter portraits of
General Apathy and Major Boredom singing
"Whatever and ever amen"

Oh well, maybe not, I'll try again
Well, this should cheer you up for sure
See, I've got your old I.D
And you're all dressed up like the Cure

You never rest
Fighting the Battle of Who Could Care Less
Unearned unhappiness
You're my hero, I confess
