(Snatched for the gods
You are snatched for the gods)

You're looking good
Like I knew you would
Your body just seems to gleam
Well
You been to the gym
With the shape you're in
(You are fierce)
I hope you don't hurt nobody

A heavenly body
(Don't tell no lie)
It always looks good
To the naked eye
Your heavenly body
(Oh me, oh my)
So divine
(Pump it baby)

(Snatched for the gods)
Oh me, oh my
Gonna cut me a piece of that cherry pie
(Snatched for the gods)
Oh me, oh my
Your stuff is good, it's fortified

(Snatched for the gods
You are snatched for the gods)

There's no doubt
You been working out
Your muscles so strong and lean
Yeah
You're so fine
I'm gonna make you mine
I just want to touch your body

A heavenly body
(Don't tell no lie)
It always looks good
To the naked eye
Your heavenly body
(Oh me, oh my)
So divine
(Pump it baby)

(Snatched for the gods)
Oh me, oh my
Gonna cut me a piece of that cherry pie
(Snatched for the gods)
Oh me, oh my
Your stuff is good, it's fortified
