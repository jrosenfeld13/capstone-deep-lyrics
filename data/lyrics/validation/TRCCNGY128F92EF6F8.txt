Do you ever want to leave yourself
And let misfortune take your soul?
Worthless heavy heart
As I turn the switch and throw it away
Misery seeps on my skin and I sit and stare
Numb and mute
Can anything else I touch break?
Carry me away pain
Look through the framework and impale my disgust
Mistrust
I have nothing
None of it
Please join in, but do you deserve it?
I beat fulfillment into white walls
Fuck it we all cry and hate life as we choose it
Bit by bit by broken piece we kill it
We grasp heavily as blood and
Tears drip through our hands
The light in my eyes
Unsettled in my actions
Kill them
