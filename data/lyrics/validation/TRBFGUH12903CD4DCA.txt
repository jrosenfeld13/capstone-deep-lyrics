She flies much faster
Shouts much louder
Looks much fresher
And eats much less than you

There's nothing you can do
It's just hard to hang out with Tomoko
Tomoko

She doesn't gossip
Her hair still shines
Still has hope
Is never broke
Like you

There's nothing you can do
It's just hard to hang out with Tomoko
Tomoko

But you get into all these clubs
You never dreamed off
And get loads of boys and toys
When you want
If you want
Do 3000 stupid things
But you don't get screamed at
And get loads of boys and toys
When you want
If you want

She's always nice
And gives advice
When we don't have a clue
She needs no help
From you

There's nothing you can do
It's just hard to hang out with Tomoko
Tomoko

But you get into all these clubs
You never dreamed off
And get loads of boys and toys
When you want
If you want
Do 3000 stupid things
But you don't get screamed at
And get loads of boys and toys
When you want
If you want

She's never cold
Puts boys on hold
Has the whitest smile
And her shoes
Used to be crocodile
It's true
Tomoko
It's hard to hang out with Tomoko
Tomoko
There's nothing you can do
Tomoko, Tomoko
No there's nothing you can do
Tomoko, Tomoko
It's just hard to hang out with Tomoko
Tomoko, Tomoko
And there's nothing you can do
Tomoko, Tomoko
Yes it's hard to hang out with Tomoko
Tomoko, Tomoko
