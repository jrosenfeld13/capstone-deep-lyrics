I helped you baby, you couldn't help yourself
Now, you on your feet, helpin' somebody else
I'm a poor man, but a good man, been treated wrong

She walked off and left me, she didn't say a word
Wasn't nothin' she knowed, but somethin' she heard
I'm a poor man, but a good man, been treated wrong

If you don't b'lieve me, people, wait a right round and see
Somebody gonna mistreat you, like you mistreated me

I walked down to the station, I looked up on the wall
My money was too light, I didn't go nowhere at all
I'm a poor man, but a good man, been treated wrong
