MEG:
Jesus, what a crowd

GIRL 1:
Nervous?

MEG:
Just a bit

GIRL 1:
Kid, look who you are!

GIRL 2:
The headline act!

GIRL 1:
A major star

GIRL 2:
You're already a hit!
(Got a match?)

MEG:
Wonder what he'll think

GIRL 1:
(The boss?)

GIRL 2:
Ha, if he's even here

GIRL 1:
(Honey, please, he's here!)

GIRL 2:
And in just two days
He'll be there tossing you bouquets
At our gala premiere
Picture it!

GIRL 1:
The cream of Manhattan!

GIRL 2:
Celebrities, millionaires!

GIRL 1:
Watching you!

MEG:
I'll be waiting in the wing
Wound up tighter than a spring
As the house begins to dim
And I'll practice every line
Hoping desperately to shine
Shining only for him

GIRLS:
Just imagine how they'll cheer
At the moment you appear

MEG:
Stepping out before the scrim
Let them whoop and let them call
I won't hear the crowd at all

GIRLS:
No, it's only for him

MEG:
Tell me how I look

GIRL 1:
(Fine!)

MEG:
(Just fine?)
What about my hair?

GIRL 2:
(Beautiful!)

MEG:
(You swear?)

GIRL 1:
Trust me, once the boss sees
How you put that song across

GIRL 2:
Hell, he ain't got a prayer!

MEG:
(Oh, you mean it?)

GIRLS:
You'll stand proud into the light

GIRL 1:
Looking lovely

GIRL 2:
Burning bright

GIRLS:
All vitality and vim

MEG:
Ah-Ahh...!
And I'll rapturously float
Through the melody he wrote
Singing only for him

GIRLS:
And before the music dies
Up the audience will rise
Nearly bursting at the brim
And you'll stand there in the glow

MEG:
And perhaps at last he'll know...

GIRL 3:
(Girls, hurry up, we're on!)

AUDIENCE MEMBERS:
Where is she?
(Look!)
The center!
(Just like in the posters!)
There!
(The ooh-la-la girl!)

ALL:
Meg Giry!

MEG:
Welcome, each and everyone
To our firmament of fun

GIRLS:
A buffet of Ballyhoo!

GIRLS/MEG:
It's where Coney comes to play
And it's opening today

MEG:
And it's only for you!

GIRL 1:
And you!

GIRL 2:
And you!

GIRL 3:
And you!

GIRLS/MEG:
Entertainment day and night
Sure to dazzle and delight

MEG:
And of course we'll be there too!

GIRLS:
Yoohoo!

GIRLS/MEG:
We're so happy that you're here
For this season's big premiere
And it's only for you!

[GIRLS laugh, AUDIENCE MEMBERS cheer]

ANNOUNCER:
(Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Meg Giry! The ooh-la-la girl! Five shows daily only here at Phantasma! And now the aerial exoticism of the fabulous Miss Fleck! Half bird, half woman! All for only 10 cents a ticket...)

MEG:
(How was I? Tell me!)

MADAME GIRY:
(Delightful, Meg, you were just perfect. And I say that not only as your mother, but as your producer.)

MEG:
(Was he watching?)

MADAME GIRY:
(I'm sure he was. I'm sure he'll have much to say about how much you've progressed. By the way, it seems you have an admirer...a certain Mr. Thompson.)

MEG:
(Is he important?)
