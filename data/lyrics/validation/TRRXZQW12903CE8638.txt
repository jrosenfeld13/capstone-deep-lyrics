[Intro: Lee Hazlewood]
Sometimes a man and a woman spends thirty or forty years together
And they don't belong together
And then one day, one of them tries to leave
And does but in a most peculiar way

[Verse 1: Lee Hazlewood]
Woman, one of these days I'm (leaving)
Leaving you far behind
And on that day you'll be (grieving)
Grieve on, woman, I don't mind
Look out in the backyard (Mama)
Cause I'm leaving you real soon
Gonna fly me up to (heaven)
In my big red balloon

[Hook: Nancy Sinatra]
You're nothing but an old fool
And that's all you'll ever be
You're nothing but an old fool
You know you'll never beat me
So stop your silly playing
It's time you settled down
And hear me when I'm saying
You'll never get that damn thing off the ground

[Verse 2: Lee Hazlewood]
Old woman are ya (looking)
Cause I'm almost ten fight high, high, high
Woman stop your (cooking)
Cause I'll never eat that pie
I'm on my way to (heaven)
Might even touch the moon
Wave me goodbye I'm (leaving)
In my big red balloon

[Hook: Nancy Sinatra]
You're nothing but an old fool
And that's all you'll ever be
You're nothing but an old fool
You know you'll never leave me
So stop your silly playing
It's time you settled down
You better hear me when I'm saying
You'll never get that damn thing off the ground

[Verse 3: Lee Hazlewood]
You never gave me (loving)
You never were the kind
You never gave me (children)
You never had the time
Remember me to (no one)
I was born this afternoon
I got it all (together)
In my big red balloon

[Hook: Nancy Sinatra]
You're nothing but an old fool
And that's all you'll ever be
You're nothing but an old fool
You know you'll never leave me
So c'mon and stop this silly playing
It's time you settled down
And hear me when I'm saying
You'll never get that damn thing off the ground

[Outro: Nancy Sinatra (spoken)]
You'll never get that damn thing off the ground
I said you won't get that thing off the ground
Get that -
What are you doing up there?
Bring that damn thing back down here
Listen - you hear me
Get back down here boy!
