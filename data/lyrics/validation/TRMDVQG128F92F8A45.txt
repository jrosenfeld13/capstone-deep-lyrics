Time is wastin'
It's time to move
Day is breakin'
With the early morning news

Eggs 'n' bacon
Big pile of hash
The river's waitin'
I can see that silver flash

Pick up my gear
Start up the truck
Stick with me, baby
Wish me well
Wish me luck

Take a dirt road
I walk a mile flat
Nest of bluebirds
Singing in my hat

I feel so light
I might drift away
If I get lost
Then I have found my way

I walk on water
Dive like a duck
Stick with me, baby
Wish me well
Wish me luck

Chasin' daydreams
Down a riverbed
Black flies buzzin'
All around my head

Hooked a rainbow
He's jumpin' for the sky
He's pulling me along
I've never been so high

'Til he gave in
And he gave up
I set him free
I wished him well
I wished him luck

You know I love you
You know I always will
While you lay sleepin'
Up there on the hill

No other angel
Has come along
Who can sing to me
The way you sing our song

'Til lightning strikes
And I get struck
Stick with me, baby
Wish me well
Wish me luck

Time is wastin'
It's time to move
Day is breakin'
With the early mornin' news

Eggs 'n' bacon
Big cup of mud
Anticipation
Like a river in my blood

'Til lightning strikes
And I get struck
Stick with me, baby
Wish me well
Wish me luck
