So enticed by the incentives
Inside all broken and defensive
Glorifying the human pace

As if there's some destination
For our supposed sublimation
Our delusions lead the way

No promised land
No Canaan found in our ascension
No answers found in our progression

I'm having trouble seeing the importance
A fragile front masks our ignorance
Maybe tomorrow it will be OK

I've heard that before
And it sounds like madness
Tomorrow is gone, we almost had it
But egos got in the way
