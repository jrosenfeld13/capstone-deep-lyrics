Last night I had a dream
Said I had a dream last night
Found myself being helplessly drawn into the light

Headed headlong to the light (to the light)
I was feeling trouble
Reached for the wrong hand and I got slighted

If you feel me slipping oh so far away from you
Please don't stop tripping for there is nothing you can do
Try as you might

Headed headlong into the light
If you're feeling trouble than reach for the wrong hand
And I get slighted

God is just a fantasy
In this fantasy wonderland
And I am an illusion of a ? that was a man
Not wrong or right

Headed headlong into the light
If you're feeling trouble
Than reach out for the hand and get delight
If you're feeling trouble
Just reach out for the hand thats acting right
