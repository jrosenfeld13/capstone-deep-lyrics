Levis exurgit Zephyrus
Et sol procedit tepidus
Iam terra sinus asperit
Dulcore suo diffluit

Tu saltim veris gratia
Exaudi et considera
Frondes, flores et gramina
Nam mea languet anima

Quod oculis dum video
Et auribus dum audio
Heu, pro tantis gaudiis
Tantis inflor suspiriis

Ver purpuratum exiit
Ornatus suos induit
Aspergit terram floribus
Ligna silvarum frondibus

Cum mihi sola sedeo
Et hec revolvens palleo
Si forte capud sublevo
Nec audio nec video

Translation by kjc007:

Zephyrus gently expels heat
And the sun proceeds with warmth
And breathes on the earth's cup
He flies in sweet stitchery

You youth dance with grace
You perceive and consider
The branches, flowers and grass
You sing in the languid breeze

Because I see while I have eyes
And we hear while we have ears
Oh, for such great delight
Such great breath to blow

Spring leaves in purple splendor
Wraps us in ornate stitchery
The earth is made of strong smelling blooms
Trees are made of branches and leaves

I take pleasure in holding fast
And looking into the dimness
If by fate I am left blind
I will neither see nor hear all this
