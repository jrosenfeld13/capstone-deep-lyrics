Static
Coloured by the television set
Listen while everything fades to grey
Static

Traded for the life of love in hearts
Downing while everything comes up ace

Coloured by a black leather belt
Taking back the years of consciousness

Traded for the gift of happiness
Listen while everything fades to grey
I'll listen
Listen to stories caught up in a feverish nightmare
I'm not a fish
Unable to swim
Downing faster, twirling in
Through the sand
Waves to the enemy
Crash course in surviving perjury

Traded for the gift of happiness
Listen while everything fades to grey
Static
