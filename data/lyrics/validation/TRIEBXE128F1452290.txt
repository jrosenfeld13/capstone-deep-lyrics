[Verse 1]
Coming down
Solid ground
It's not the same
How do you feel?
Something has changed
Life's rearranged
Faces are grey, worn, pale
How do you feel?

[Chorus]
It's just beginning again
I can't take it, I won't make it, I can't fake it
Bruised and I'm twisting again

[Verse 2]
Hopes growing strong
Still holding on
Life's not the same, same game
How do you feel?
As long as you know
It's what's owed
You're losing your game
What's the remains
How do you feel?

[Chorus]
It's just beginning again
I can't take it, I won't make it, I can't fake it
Bruised and I'm twisting again
Loose and untwisted again

[Verse 3]
Looking back
Still looking back
There's no return
How do you feel?
Lost in a daze
Emotional maze
Nothing to give, lose, hate
How do you feel?

[Chorus]
It's just beginning again
I can't take it, I won't make it, I can't fake it
Loose and untwisted again
Bruised and I'm twisting again
