If I fell in love
Would you sold me out
Would you take me deep
Would you go without
If I never leave
Took the pills again
Would you love me more

If I buried you
Would you bury me
If I broke in two
Would that set me free
If I never need
Took the life again
Would you love me more

And what did you think we would find
Travelled a million miles but still no sign
And what did they think we would find
Pile into anyone we've all gone blind

If I'll only you
We'll keep it complicated
If you never find out
Will we still be waiting
If I'm too strung out
And I follow you
Would you need me more

If I never try
And we never take
If we never bend
Then we'll never break
If we stimulate
And we sexualize
Will you need it more

And what did you think we would find
Travelled a million miles but still no sign
And what did they think we would find
Pile into anyone we've all gone

So I'm not in love
I can sort it out
You can take me in it if
Or I will go without
If we never need
If the pills again
Would you love me more

If I war on you
Will you war on me
If I break you down
Will that set you free
If we never need
Need the life again
Would you love me more
And more

And what did you think we would find
Travelled a million miles but still no sign
And what did they think we would find
Pile into anyone we've all gone blind
