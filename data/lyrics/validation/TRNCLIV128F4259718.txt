The other night a close friend told me
Never let my heart fall into careless hands
I said, "Thanks, that's very nice, appreciate your good advice
But things don't always go the way that I planned"

[Chorus]
Oh you, you, you take my heart and shake it up
You, you, you take my heart and break it up
Get me to the doctor
My heart goes bang, bang, bang, bang
My heart goes bang, bang, bang, bang
My heart goes bang, bang, bang, bang
My heart goes bang, bang, bang, bang

When I get in close to you, I do the things I never do
There's no depression, doctor put me to the test
I've heard your lovin' is the best
Well he is right, you know I need affection

[Chorus]
Oh you, you, you take my heart and shake it up
You, you, you take my heart and break it up
Get me to the doctor
My heart goes bang, bang, bang, bang
My heart goes bang, bang, bang, bang
My heart goes bang, bang, bang, bang
My heart goes bang, bang, bang, bang

[Bridge]
Doctor, doctor, give me the cure
Doctor, doctor, give me the cure

Doctor, I'm consulting you
I wanna put myself into your careless hands
All I need's a lovin' dose, I feel much better when you're close
I really hope things go the way that I planned

[Chorus]
Oh you, you, you take my heart and shake it up
You, you, you take my heart and break it up
Get me to the doctor
My heart goes bang, bang, bang, bang
My heart goes bang, bang, bang, bang
My heart goes bang, bang, bang, bang
My heart goes bang, bang, bang, bang
