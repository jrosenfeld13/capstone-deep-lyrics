[Verse 1: Blackout]
Playa, Playa let's get 'em
Right down the middle we split 'em, split 'em
Wid what we hit 'em
Pass it to me I get rid ah suckas who wanna ruckus
Kickin' up dust is a must it's leavin' ya family fussin'
Cause no discusses ya bustas, act like you know the deal
Reppin' wid Terror and Fly, picture me ridin' high
Runnin' the streets to get by, even wid hot fire
Hop in the truck run you over dog you out like a Rover
Bring it to you high or sober, reach underneath the seats
You layin' dead where you be, blackin' out in a jeep
Makin' your bi-zalls increase, I come to bring the heat
Heamin' and hot for the block, posted up at the spot
Pull up ya socks when I cock, I make you bustas drop
See what I'm sayin' no playin' you prayin' where you layin'
It's on again everyday an' right now it's goin' down
Standin' my ground wid a frown, so get the word around
Tennessee be heaven bound, shit

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Flizy we gotta get 'em, come on Lil Terror get 'em
No time for playin' wid 'em, just let the lyrics hit 'em
Right up the center split 'em, give 'em this vocal venom
Flizy we gotta get 'em, come on Lil Terror get 'em

[Verse 2: Lil Terror]
Ridin' like tanks, best believe I got some shit for yo ass
Spark the trunk plug the mic up cause I'ma bump to the last
Beat drop, you niggas not, compare to this shit that I speak
Buck one six and leave you suckin' yo duck, fuckin' yo bitch
I love you, yes I take you up, bumpin you out, stompin' yo clout
Fuck what you thought you was it's what you about
And I ain't shame to call names, Glock to kill you gon' speak
My nigga you owin', and I'm knowin, cause you showin' you weak
Man I gotta get 'em, down the middle and split 'em
Hit 'em wid venom bump the rhythm like the game get wid 'em
Enemies chokin' slugs, ain't gotta show me love
Nigga huh nigga what, ain't playin' nigga thug
Say what you wanna say, it's Playa Posse day
And Minnie fuckin' Mae, give us our earned pay
As Bill Chill lay, we still love and hate
Bump til your heart decay, scared ah me I don't play
Blackout bossin' the track, hater callin' ya wack
Anna gimme the Mack, y'all ah make it a crack
Lyrical the attack, blow your heart out ya back
Broke knots wid Playa Fly, come through wid Gangsta Blac

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Blackout we gotta get 'em, come on Flizy let's get 'em
No time for playin' wid 'em, just let the lyrics hit 'em
Right up the center split 'em, give 'em this vocal venom
Blackout we gotta get 'em, for Nino Lanes get 'em

[Verse 3: Playa Fly]
Will pursuit to execute and do whatever Fly got to do
The world became my victim gotta give somethin' to listen to
Flizy givin' no time for playin' wit 'em, Fly can't baby sit 'em
Fly got so much work that's left undone so Fly gon' buck this system
Start the music bumpin' loud, watch the crowd get buck and wild
Cloud followed by sound, followed by cloud from this golden child
Circumcision of the system by Fly and my mafia members
Heavyweight contenders not pretenders but you should remember
We kind enough to smoke it wit ya, kind enough to choke it wit ya
Kind enough to blow it wid ya, kind enough to blow it wit ya
If you cross we gotta get ya call the click and quickly hit ya
Up and down the center split ya, we ain't playin' wit ya
Mafia movin' bodies to that music wid an attitude
So rude you lose yo cool put on yo dog and start to act a fool
Fool and buck and out the frame, IBN gon' bring the pain
Injected in the veins of each and every one ah you lemon lames
Snatchin' cheques from Minny Mae who slam the poems and what I claim
Wid these M-town figures we gon flush up in and out this bank
Enemies should be ashame to even dis or down my name
And if they do they do so Gangsta Blac you come and get' em maine, GET 'EM!

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Blackout we gotta get 'em, come on Lil Terror get 'em
No time for playin' wid 'em, just let the lyrics hit 'em
Right up the center split 'em, give 'em this vocal venom
Blackout we gotta get 'em, come on Lil Terror get 'em

(Song ends wid Gangsta Blac, Flizy and other people talking 'n singing)
