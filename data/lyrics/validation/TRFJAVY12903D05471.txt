My brain is dead
I sneaze if I can
My thoughts just left my head
I can't control my temper
Boil up inside
Nightlife ain't worth the ride
I feel like shit
Smashed state of mind
Sensational
One of a kind
Let's call razor boy
Let's make it right
Nightlife a life I like

No reason why
I'll wait and see life goes by
Don't wanna try
I'll wait and see life goes by

Sensitive to the light
Can't stand the sunshine
Sensitive to the light
I'll leave U behind

What's goin' on
It kills me when you're gone
How could I do you so much harm
I'm fading fast
Tomorrow I'm gone
My nightlife brings me charm
