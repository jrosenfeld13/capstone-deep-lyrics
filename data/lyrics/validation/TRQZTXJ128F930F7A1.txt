We storm the stage, we play our part
Everybody loves a thespian
We jump a grade, we make our mark
Everybody loves a champion
And we are larger than life
Brighter than lights
We're always on
Everybody knows us we are the wonderful ones
We live too fast and then we die
Everybody loves a legend then
We shoot to last we don't ask why
Everybody loves Americans
And we are armed to the teeth
High on speed
We'e always on

Everybody knows us we're the wonderful ones
Making the scene, the kings and
Queens of last years prom
Everybody loves us, how about you?

The ghostly girls who shed their skins
The sunbathed boys, the Hilton twins
The fabulous fucked up us
Well ready or not we're coming because
The show must go on
The show must go on
The show is on

Everybody knows us we're the wonderful ones
Making the scene, the kings and
Queens of last years prom
Everybody loves us, how about you?

Everybody knows us, we're the wonderful ones
Our names on the list we're hard to resist
We're so like young
Everybody know us, we're the wonderful ones
Nothing's our fault, we never get caught
Everybody loves us, how about you?
