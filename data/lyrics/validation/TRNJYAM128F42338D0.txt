How come there's so many people
Willing to suffer
So they get up
And suffer every day
They think they were put on
This Earth to suffer
And, by God, they're going to suffer
Until they suffer their lives away

How come so many are willing to say:
"There is no sense"
"There is no plan"
Yet they will not believe
The ancient mysteries
Passed down through time into their hands

If my choice is despair or wonder
On the line between truth and belief
Do I just let the tide take me under
Or do I let the fascination come on
And rain all over me

Open your mind
You have been blind
Imagine the answers
Or questions will be all you find
Open your mind

The grooves in my life
Were unforgiving
Over the years I laid them down
Night after night
Work - eat - sleep
Work - eat - sleep
Work - eat - sleep
Work - eat - sleep
Work - eat - sleep
Work - eat - sleep
Suffocating my delight
Until I was dragged into the light
Into the stillness
Into the white hot flame
Of my deepest fears
And when I came crashing through
Humbled and true
I was better than I've been in years

If my choice is end or beginning
In my perception between death and life
I'll keep on with this message I'm sending
We may not know how or when
But don't you wanna know why?

Open your mind
You have been blind
Imagine the answers
Or questions will be all you find
Open your mind

Oh, ah, ah, ah

Open your mind
You have been blind
(Oh..., oh..., oh...)
(Oh..., oh..., oh...)
(Oh..., oh..., oh...)
(Oh..., oh..., oh...)
(Oh...)

Open your mind
