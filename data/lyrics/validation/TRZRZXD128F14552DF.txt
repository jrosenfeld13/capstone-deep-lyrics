[Verse 1]
You gotta live
You gotta love
You gotta be somebody
You gotta shove

[Chorus]
But it's so hard, it's really hard
Sometimes I feel like going down

[Verse 2]
You gotta eat
You gotta drink
You gotta feel something
You gotta worry

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
But when it's good
It's really good
And when I hold you in my arms baby

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You gotta run
You gotta hide
You gotta keep your woman satisfied

[Chorus]
