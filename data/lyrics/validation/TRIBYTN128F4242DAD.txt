Seems I no longer score oh baby

Is there something you should tell me
'Cause I feel the tension in the air
Maybe we should talk about it
'Cause this silence I can't bear
And I'm not making no excuses
There's a million reasons why
We were once so good together
Now we're living separate lives

[Chorus]
'Cause you don't love me anymore
Don't hurt the way I do crying over you
And you don't need me anymore
Don't see the tears I cry (when I'm) crying over you

One was such a lonely number
Then I realize the score
All you can do is change it
Let me hold you just once more
'Cause every picture tells your story
And tonight I feel the blues
So afraid to think about tomorrow
All the love that we once knew

[Chorus]
I'm just living on a prayer
Hope I wake up, find you there
We can turn the world around us
And make it like it's ??? day

[Chorus x3]
