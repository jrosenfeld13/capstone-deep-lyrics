Under the sun there are many pretty things
You talk of love and the happiness it brings
You took my heart, you took my heart from me

Under the sky there are many pretty girls
But there's not one that can help me in this world
You took my heart, you took my heart from me

I'm sitting here alone tonight, and I'm thinking about you
Wondering if it's wrong or right to be dreaming about you
You took my heart, you took my heart from me
You took my heart, you took my heart from me

I'm sitting here alone tonight, and I'm thinking about you
Wondering if it's wrong or right to be dreaming about you
You took my heart, you took my heart from me
You took my heart, you took my heart from me

There will be no love for me, there will be no love for me
No love for me, no love for me, no love for me
