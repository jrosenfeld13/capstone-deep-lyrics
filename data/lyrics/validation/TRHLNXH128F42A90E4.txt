Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly
With his song telling my whole life
With his words
Killing me softly
With his song
I heard he sang a good song, i heard he had a style
And so i came to see him and listen for a while
And there he was this young boy, stranger to my eyes
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
I felt all flushed with fever
Embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish
But he just kept right on strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Yo l-boogie, take it to the bridge
(bust it)
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Strumming my pain with his finger, yeah he was . .
