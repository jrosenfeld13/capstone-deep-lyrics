[G. Feldhausen]

I feel your fire
And it's burning hot
And it takes me higher
Right back to the start
I know you're rotten to the core
But I feel like I've never felt before, it's alright

You tell me I'm a rough boy
Those words that make me strong
But I know you really enjoy
Treating me like a dog
And when you put me down onto my knees
I wanna leave you just to get me free, it's alright

Will I save my heart from you
Can I believe you're being true
Do you wanna tell me lies
And will I see it in your eyes
Will I save my heart from you
Can I believe you're being true
Do you wanna tell me lies
And will I see it in your eyes

You show me that you need me
When you're feeling down
I just hate it but I love it
Don't say I'm the only one
And when you tell me all these little lies
I really hope you will fall through the ice, oh yeah

You're like the fallen angel
Like a devil on the run
And when you tell me that it's over
Please tell me what I've done
Will you miss a man who prays to you
Or will you break another heart in two, and feel right

Will I save my heart from you
Can I believe you're being true
Do you wanna tell me lies
And will I see it in your eyes
Will I save my heart from you
Can I believe you're being true
Do you wanna tell me lies
And will I see it in your eyes
