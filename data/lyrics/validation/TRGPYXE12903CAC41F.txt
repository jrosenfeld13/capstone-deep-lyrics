Open my eyes to see
The wonderful mystery of love
Falling into you
I'm drawn to the gravity of love, love, love

We're standing still in a moment of eternity
Where worlds collide and I feel the breath of heaven over me

My soul sings
My soul sings
My soul sings
How I love you

My soul sings
My soul sings
My soul sings
How I love you

Open the page and see
The wonderful history of love, love
I start and end with you
I'm pulled to the gravity of love, love, love

We're standing still in a moment of eternity
Where worlds collide and I feel the breath of heaven over me

My soul sings
My soul sings
My soul sings
How I love you

My soul sings
My soul sings
My soul sings
How I love you
