We drove in my car into the night
With you in my arms it just felt right
We talked a lot about the things we could do
And your eyes were sparkling bright
Then one day you started a fight
For no good reason you had no right
I never thought it would be like that
So today, Im thinking of leaving
Now its time to leave you
Leave you behind
Now its time Ive made up my mind
Ive got a strange kind of feeling
A feeling so true
That it aint no cure loving you
I put a record on my stereo
I found a photo from a long time ago
Of you and me from way back when
We had fun, so much fun
But then you wake me up from my dream
Youre at your friends and wont be coming home
Well Ive been thinking about calling you
cause today Im thinking of leaving
Now its time to leave you
Leave you behind
Now its time Ive made up my mind
Ive had this strange kind of feeling
A feeling so true
That it aint no cure loving you
And I drive to the end of the road
It aint no cure
You know I tried, but its taken too long
It aint no cure
Loving you....
