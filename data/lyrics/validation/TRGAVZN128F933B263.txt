They got married in a honky tonk bar
Said their vows on a 6-string steel guitar
He's been in love from the moment he saw her
All those years ago at the livestock shows
He's just a rodeo clown
He ain't much, just the biggest damn fool in town
Now, his best man he couldn't come around
Cause he died a month ago down in Mexico

Well, God bless the fools
For breaking all the rules
And fighting over their bar stools
And getting married in a honky tonk bar

They honeymooned in a pick up truck
Threw some hay in the bed so that they mightstay up all night
And laugh with the stars and the moonlight
And all them U.F.O.'s with their crazy light shows

He left his three-legged dog at home
And let the cows loose so they could roam
We don't know if they'll ever come home
But that's O.K. you see, we think they ought to go free by now

God bless the fools
For screwing up all the rules
And hanging on to their bar stools
And getting married in a honky tonk bar

They got married in a honky tonk bar
Said their vows on a 6-string steel guitar
He's been in love from the moment he saw her
All those years ago at the livestock shows

He's just a rodeo clown
He ain't much, just the biggest damn fool in town
Now, his best man he couldn't come around
Cause he died hard and slow down in Mexico

Well, God bless us fools
For stumbling all over your rules
And falling off our bar stools
And getting married in a honky tonk bar
Getting married in a honky tonk bar
