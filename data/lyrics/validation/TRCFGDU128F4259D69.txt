You said I hurt you
The pain I feel still burns
You said I neglect you
Let things by with no concern
You said that I don't care
What the hell do you want from me?
You said I ruined you
Don't you see what you've done to me?

You said I wasted
These years gone down unjust
You fucking tasted
And left me in the dust
You said you hate me
You should have left me behind
The fact is you've mistook me
Now there's nothing left to find

When I fill you up, I cheat myself
When I start you up, I beat myself
When I let you go, I kill myself
Can you rip me from this hell
It's only fair!
