One silver cloud collapsed below the glow of a harvest fullmoon
'Cause we're here to make an oath
And we'll raise our realm in a sky of maroon
Our stratosphere turned dark; however
The Western winds never stopped blowing
All deceiving religions fall, we'll gonna close our hands
And make our own way

Ignite the wroth flames -
3 fires to the sky
Before the violence
We stand before the most, wild beast
We'll rape the peace
Once again
We summon you
To join us all!

Standing upon the sand of the shores
Was a Queen, with a crown, of 13 stars
She worships the dragon above
Which exalts impiety in that wild beast
Our father is here with us and we'll summon you to join us
If we're bonded by jewels and blood on our fists
Then we hail you within kingdoms of mist

Gorias! (The silver sword of the moon)
Finias! (The flaming lancet of the sun)
The winter zephyr warps the power of Sessair
