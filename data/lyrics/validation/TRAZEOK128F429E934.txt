When she sleeps she shuts out the eyesights of you
When you call her name she trembles at what you might do

Daytime- save her and she might give in
Nighttime- demons who know you can't win

Sleeping demons
They lurk but they don't make a sound
But you won't get up even when they're not around

Daytime- brings out the promise within
Nighttime- demons who know you can't win

Daytime- brings out the promise within
Nighttime- demons who know you can't win
Daytime- brings out the promise within
Demons who know you can't win
