(CHORUS)
Hurry home, hurry home
Time to get scurrying and hurry home
This trusty assistant has traveled far in distance
But now we got to hurry home!

(Verse #1)
I traveled all the way to the mummy's tomb
And I was so scared, my heart was going boom
But you weren't so bad
Well, thanks I'm glad
Now, c'mon, we got to hurry home!
Next it was the werewolf that we had to see
You walked through the forest like a grabbing tree
I thoght she'd be scary
But she was only hairy
C'mon, we got to hurry home!

(CHORUS)
...We'll get the story at the laboratory
That's why we got to hurry home!

(Verse #2)
We had to make a stop at the vampire tower
I made the stairs fall
It took like an hour
We were scared of each other
Yes, we were
Oh, brother!
But now we got to hurry home!

(CHORUS)
...Our monstery faces of in a bunch of places
But now we got to hurry home!(x3)
