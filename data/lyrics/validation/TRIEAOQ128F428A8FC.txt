This is a mean old world to live in all
All by yourself
This is a mean old world to live in all
All by yourself, oh yes, it is

This is a mean world and I wish to be alone
Without friends, can't settle even a home
This is a mean old world to live in all
All by yourself

What you should do is try and make at least
One friend each and everyday, oh, yes
You should try and make at least
One friend each and everyday and, oh, yes

If you make one friend each and everyday
And then later that same friend
May help you along your way
This is a mean old world to live in all
All by yourself

This is a mean old world to live in
All by yourself, all by yourself
This is a mean old world to live in
All by yourself, all by your self

This is a mean world and I wish to be alone
Without a friend, can't settle even a home
This is a mean old world to live in
All by yourself, all by yourself

This is a mean old world to live in
All by yourself, all by yourself
This is a mean old world to live in
All by yourself, all by yourself

This is a mean world and I wish to be alone
Without a friend, can't settle even a home
This is a mean old world to live in
All by yourself, all by yourself
