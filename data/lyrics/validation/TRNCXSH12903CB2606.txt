We're stealing bodies
So the doctors can study
And improve their technique
They operate next week
On the girl who's embarrassed
That she melted the chalice
With a thought thrown through the air
But she's only half of a pair

Cuz Effie's on the other side
She's laughing and sculpting and washing the filth
Off of the devil's hide

We're replacing their bones
With pipes, sticks, and stones
So the grievers don't notice
That their loved ones helped us grow this
Translucent creature being housed
By the doubting preacher
Reciting the scriptures
While the creature paints this picture

Of Effie on the other side
She's laughing and sculpting and washing the filth
Off of the devil's hide
