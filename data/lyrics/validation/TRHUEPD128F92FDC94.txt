[Chorus]
Friends in high places, others in cages
Tips on the races and a bottle full of rum
You never will see him from here to the river
If you do see him, he'll be drunker than a cunt

[Verse 1]
Well panic attack Jack calls up the Samaritans
Little brother Zac's tag-alonging with the pack
Two lovers argue phone booth over all their hangups
Which one never listens, now they're never calling up
Well Riot Rock Scott decided all of his answers
Were down at the shop in the other side of town
Intelligent Robbie's at university watching clock
Singing along as he sits and he stomps

[Chorus]
Friends in high places, others in cages
Tips on the races and a bottle full of rum
You never will see him from here to the river
If you do see him, he'll be drunker than a cunt

[Verse 2]
Quicksand land got the best of the man
Even if it's in the toilet, even with a winning hand
Sell it in a faux pas and left it in a trunk
While sitting in the back, she's a notch up on his bunk
While young professionals are watching girls on poles
These work hard, play hard, dying to get old
Dirty 'til you're thirty, then securing gold
Raising up a family, make sure they never know

[Chorus]
Friends in high places, others in cages
Tips on the races and a bottle full of rum
You never will see him from here to the river
If you do see him, well, he'll be drunker than a cunt

[Hook]
B-b-b-baby, you must know
The dance of the young professionals
B-b-b-baby, you must know
The dance of the young professionals
B-b-b-baby, you must know
The dance of the young professionals
B-b-b-baby, you must know
The dance of the young professionals

[Chorus]
Friends in high places, others in cages
Tips on the races and a bottle full of rum
You never will see him from here to the river
If you do see him, well, he'll be drunker than a cunt
Friends in high places, others in cages
Tips on the races and a bottle full of rum
You never will see him from here to the river
If you do see him, well, he'll be drunker than a cunt

[Hook]
B-b-b-baby, you must know
The dance of the young professionals
B-b-b-baby, you must know
The dance of the young professionals
