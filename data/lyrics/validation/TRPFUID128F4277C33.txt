Weak souls, take heart. I know you've fallen apart
Ambition's left its mark, I know you've fallen apart
Do you know about, the patient?
Oh I doubt you really even care to know
You do not really care to know. You do not really care to know
Well listen to a song about
I won't let you forget
We will never forget
