[Verse 1]
Has it been a year, since the last time I've seen her
My God, I could swear it was ten
And the ocean of liquor I drank to forget her
Is gonna kill me but I'll drink 'til then
I've been living in hell with a bar for a cell
Still paying for my cheating crime
Oh, And I've got a long way to go
Still doin' time

[Chorus]
Still doin' time
In a honky tonk prison
Still doin' time
Where a man ain't forgiven
My poor heart is breaking
But there's no escaping
Each morning I wake up and I find
Still doin' time

[Verse 2]
Oh when your caught me cheating twice
It's twenty to life in a place
Where the sun never shines
And tomorrow you're gonna find me right here
Still doin' time

[Chorus]
Still doin' time
In a honky tonk prison
Still doin' time
Where a man ain't forgiven
My poor heart is breaking
But there's no escaping
Each morning I wake up and I find
Still doin' time
Still doin' time...
