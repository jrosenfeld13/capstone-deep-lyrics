Blind to the answers, find yourself
Walk for the moment, find the reason in yourself
Theres a reason for you and I
Take this time to find a meaning
A reason to sit back and measure the worst six years of my life
Waiting for your legs to close on my best friends
Last night I saw your life flash before my eyes
Why did I laugh so hard baby?
(you won't be back and i'm still laughing)
I never meant to hurt you (but I did)
I'm sorry that you cried so hard darling
I'll never hurt you again
Take this time to find your tounge
A sorry excuse to stop your lies
The best 30 seconds of my life
My angel take your pills
My angel I sold your ring
And now I can't stop laughing
I didn't want it this way
I hope you're happy where you are
And i'm glad to say I put you there
Who's the one that's laughing now
I'm the one who's laughing now
(now theres nothing left to say I hope you're feeling my embrace, and I can't sleep)
You should have left me sleeping
You should have let me sleep....
