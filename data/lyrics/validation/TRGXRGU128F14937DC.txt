So let's be honest for one moment
Pretend that everything went smooth as planned
"Deceiver", "Stabbed me in the back"
Can't seem to find my words
Where will this lead to?
End in hate?
The feelings of the past and everything attached

Far beyond here
The touch of deception
Always remember the reason you live
And there's someone who's watching your back

He taught us to forgive but we forget to let things go
Attached to everything we know
This thrill to leave it all behind
A place where joy was as rare as gold and doubt then stalked my heart
And passion followed close behind, scared stiff of failure alone
Searching for a father's love
But she'll never find it here

Never forget where you came from or what makes you tick
Always remember the reason you live and there's someone who's watching your back

Close your eyes, I will free you
