He's making all these promises you know he cannot keep
He made me pick him up now he won't pay for gasoline
He's drinking all my beers he's wearing all my clothes
And if he winks at me again i think i'll take him home

There's a barbarian in the back of my car, oh no
There's a barbarian yeh yeh yeh in the back of my car

He's started all my worries and he's finished all my wine
He's giving me a headache but i still think he's divine
He says he has a question, he starts tugging at my clothes
Would i be good enough to take him to his girlfriend's
Home ?

There's a barbarian in the back of my car, oh no
There's a barbarian yeh yeh yeh in the back of my car

Some boys go by plane and others go by sea
He'll go anywhere with anyone just as long as it's for free

There's a barbarian in the back of my car, oh no
There's a barbarian yeh yeh yeh in the back of my car

He's got his eyes on the horizon
He says i can ride his rocket
While telephone numbers are tumbling from his top
Pocket
Dream logic operator he falls out of the car
He says i'll fuck you later now just get me to the bar
