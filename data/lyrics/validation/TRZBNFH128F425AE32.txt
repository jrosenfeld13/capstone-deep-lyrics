What would I do if I was you
I'd come out and say all I wanted to
I'd be all the man you could ever be
So why don't you get up and groove with me

Give it up, give it out
Let it burn, let it shout
Stay'n alive to survive
Bein' pretty
Feelin' chic, like Le Freak
You will jump to the beat
Let your young hearts run free

Everybody come on let's get G.A.Y
(G.A.Y., ooh-ooh-ooh)
Throw out bad times, kiss yourself and say goodbye, G.A.Y
(G.A.Y.)

What would you do if you could be me
Are you ready to face what you wanna be
And nothin's enough when it's just too long
So get up and go wild and get it on

Give it up, give it out
Let it burn, let it shout
Stay'n alive to survive
Bein' pretty
Feelin' chic, like Le Freak
You will jump to the beat
Let your young hearts run free

Everybody come on let's get G.A.Y
(G.A.Y., ooh-ooh-ooh)
Throw out bad times, kiss yourself and say goodbye, G.A.Y

G.A.Y
Good as you
G.A.Y
Good as you

Everybody come on let's get G.A.Y
(G.A.Y., ooh-ooh-ooh)
Throw out bad times, kiss yourself and say goodbye, G.A.Y

Everybody come on let's get G.A.Y. (G.A.Y.)
(G.A.Y., ooh-ooh-ooh)
Throw out bad times, kiss yourself and say goodbye, G.A.Y
(Repeat to Fade)

C'mon everybody
C'mon everybody
Kiss yourself goodbye
