Youre so good good good youre great
Perfect in every way
A mole adorns your cheek (Monroe)
Dressed in the latest clothes
And forever in the know
Of whats out or in every week
Desired by every man (Desired by every man)
The queen of clubbing land (The queen of clubbing land)
The Papz all know your name (Showing a bit of thigh)
Youre a slave to fame

Chorus:
And it makes me sick
You make me sick
Decidedly sick
I dont miss a trick
Followed by every rag (Followed by every rag)
To everywhere that you stand (To every bar that you go)
Attentions your disease (Attention is your disease)
Its got you on your knees
Youre so good good good youre great
Joe Public knows your face
Youre in a million magazines (Well done!)
Decked from head to toe (Toe)
In every brand you know (You know)
And a jacket once owned by The Libertines
Not a hair out of place (not a hair out of place)
Flawless made up face (flawless made up face)
Mortgage worthy shoes (Imelda Marcos loves you)
But who is the real YOU?
Chorus
Key Change
New Flame
The botox doesnt work any more
Theyve fallen out of love
With you now
Your television is over and how will you love yourself?
When they dont love you?
Lifes so cruel

Chorus:
