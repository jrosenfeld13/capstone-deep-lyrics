I sit and stare upon my trembling hand
As it starts to move once again
Still I wonder why, is this all a lie
What does this all mean?
Midnight the board awaits in a circle on the floor
Many sins held within, many pleasures to behold
Life's, Hell, Birth, Death
Cast before my eyes
Spirits spelling out my fate
In a world that doesn't lie
It's like being crucified
No priest speaks my last rights
I can't pretend it
I must confess it, no!
Born of the Board
As I lay me down to rest
Born of the Board
Will I sleep in peace tonight?
Come! Forth! Spirits!
I have summoned you
Give me pleasure, give me pain
Ya know, round and round and round it goes
Where it stops no one knows
Such a twisted game to play!
It's like being crucified
No priest speaks my last rights
I can't pretend it
I must confess it, no
Born of the Board
As I lay me down to rest
Born of the Board
Will I sleep in peace tonight?
