I'm kinda numb without you, I cannot swallow my, my saliva
I'm kinda lost without you, please refill my drink before I say farewell

I wish that I was as strong as you, a hero in my heart
A gentleman at all costs, you made living such an art
Together, you can touch quiet shore, a shore where he belongs
A loving ghost watched over her and through the storm you'll sail

I will honour you and I will praise you
I will always value everything you taught me

I'm kinda similar to you, I will use your name when it's my turn
I'm kinda cold without you, I got the photos out, I can't control myself

I wish that I was as strong as you, a hero in my heart
A gentleman at all costs, you made living such an art
Together, you can touch quiet shore, a shore where he belongs
A loving ghost watched over her and through the storm you'll sail
I don't want to overreact any more, I don't want to live a lie
I won't ever be distracted by the ones who want me to fail

I will honour you and I will praise you
I will always value everything you taught me

I'm holding on
I'm holding on
Even though you're gone I hope that you know what you really mean to me

I'm holding on
I'm holding on
Even though you're gone I hope that you know what you really mean to me

I wish that I was as strong as you, a hero in my heart
A gentleman at all costs, you made living such an art
Together, you can touch quiet shore, a shore where he belongs
A loving ghost watched over her and through the storm you'll sail
I don't want to overreact any more, I don't want to live a lie
I won't ever be distracted by the ones who want me to fail

I will honour you and I will praise you
I will always value everything you taught me
I will honour you and I will praise you
I will always value everything you taught me
I will honour you and I will praise you
I will always value everything you taught me
I will honour you and I will praise you
I will always value everything you taught me
