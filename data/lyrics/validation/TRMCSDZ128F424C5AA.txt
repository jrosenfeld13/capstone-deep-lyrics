I like the way you hold your head
If your brother knew, he'd have my head
But I wouldn't care if I was dead
If I had the chance to hold your hand
But my love goes undeclared
Yeah, my love goes undeclared
And my love goes undeclared
Yeah, my love goes undeclared
You let me stay here for a week
On your couch but I would rather sleep
In your bed, or even better yet
We could run away and never rest
But my love stays undeclared
Yeah, my love stays undeclared
Yeah, my love stays undeclared
Yeah, my love stays undeclared
You come to me out of a dream
And you run around like you just can't be
Cause your mind is filled with fantasies
And it makes me laugh and it comforts me
But my love stays undeclared
Yeah, my love stays undeclared
Yeah, my love stays undeclared
Yeah, my love stays undeclared
You give me your insanity
But I think it might be vanity
Cause you want what you can have for free
And we don't know what it means to me
So my love stays undeclared
Yeah, my love stays undeclared
Yeah, my love stays undeclared
Yeah, my love stays undeclared
