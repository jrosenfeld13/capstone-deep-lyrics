Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger
You may see a stranger across a crowded room
An' somehow you know, you know even then
That somewhere you'll see her again and again!

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room
An' night after night as strange as it seems
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams!

Who can explain it, who can tell you why
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try!

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love
When you hear her call you across a crowded room
Then fly to her side and make her your own
Or all thru your life you may dream all alone!

Once you have found her
Never let her go!

Once you have found her
Never let her go!
