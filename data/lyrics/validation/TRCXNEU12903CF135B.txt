I'm a lucky man
And I thought you should know
That you're stuck in my head
And I can't let it go

'Cause your cracked, dry lips
Leave traces and more
I wake up wanting you
I wake up wanting you

In a darkened room
I watch you move
All the colours you could name
Are flowing out of you

And when you lay your hands
On this drunken fool
I know I'm wanting you
I know I'm wanting you

So don't be afraid
I'm only
Wanting to say
I'm glad that you stayed
