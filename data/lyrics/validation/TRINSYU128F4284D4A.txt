This song is for all the children
This song is for all the children

You can't enter Mount Zion
Jah said if you ain't like a child
You can't enter Mount Zion
Mount Zion, Mount Zion, Mount Zion

Mama want you to be what she wants you to be
You got to be what you got to be
Yes everyone suffers from the pains of life
And everyone suffers from the pains of life
Pains of life, pains of life, the pains of life

Solo

Everyone suffers from the pains of life
Everyone suffers from the pains of life
Pains of life, pains of life, the pains of life

This song is for all the children
This song is for all the children

Jah said if you ain't like a child
You can't enter Mount Zion
Jah said if you ain't like a child
You can't enter Mount Zion
Oh Mount Zion, Mount Zion, Mount Zion
