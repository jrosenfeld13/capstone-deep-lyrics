You had me when I saw your shoes
Or trainers if truth be told
You had my heart the day I heard your footsteps near me
And every summer passed me by
The stairs to my apartment lacked excitement and style
Until I heard your footsteps with me

On the top deck of the 23
Through winter snow and autumn leaves
Our footsteps in sync
It's a beautiful thing, choreography

From the supermarket aisles to the dancefloors of provincial towns
I'd occupy my vacant hours just waiting for something
For every couple holding hands in the high street
You can bet your life
You'll only hear a single set of footsteps between them

On the platforms of the Central line
The beaches of a south coast town
Our footsteps in sync
It's a beautiful thing, choreography

Like the mischief hidden in your eyes
Or the retro clothes you always buy
I just hope I'll always hear your footsteps with me
Like the clutter in your kitchen
The same song you keep on whistling
I just hope I'll always hear your footsteps with me

On the top deck of the 23
Through winter snow and autumn leaves
Our footsteps in sync
It's a beautiful thing, choreography

Like the mischief hidden in your eyes
Or the retro clothes you always buy
I just hope I'll always hear your footsteps with me
Like the clutter in your kitchen
The same song you keep on whistling
I just hope I'll always hear your footsteps with me

We'll take one step forwards and then two steps backwards
