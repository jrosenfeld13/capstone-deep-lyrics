I take the chance to lose my soul my life my pride I take the chance to be with you
I've tried to live my life the best I can
I've prayed I'd never cheat to heed my heart's command
But dear you know to one I've been untrue
I wonder if you think I'd do the same by you
I take the chance of causing you to doubt my love I take the chance to be with you

I know it's wrong for us to steal a kiss
And when you hold me in your arms I can't resist
I have a home and someone kind and true I know I'd lose it all if I was seen with you
I take the chance to lose my soul my life my pride I take the chance to be with you
