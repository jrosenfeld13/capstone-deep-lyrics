Another cold and lonley rainy day comes to an end
I have to clear my mind before i sleep or else attend
To close my eyes and realise there is nothing left but light
I need shadow i need darkness to help me through the night
Another cold and lonley rainy day comes to an end
I have to clear my mind before i sleep or else attend
To close my eyes and realise there is nothing left but light
I need shadow i need darkness to help me through the night
The dark side
The dark side
The dark side
Another cold and lonley sunday morning hurts my eyes
Cold water hits my face only get up to see the skies
I raise my head look up and i'm surprised the clouds have gone
I'm still in search for darkness so i can't till wait till dawn
Can't till wait till dawn
Can't till wait till dawn
Can't till wait till dawn
So i can't till wait till dawn
Can't till wait till dawn
So i can't till wait till dawn
Can't till
Can't till
Can't till
Can't till wait till dawn
The dark side
Another cold and lonley sunday morning hurts my eyes
Cold water hits my face only get up to see the skies

I'm still in search for darkness so i can't till wait till dawn
Till dawn
Till dawn
Till dawn
The dark side
The dark side
The dark side
The dark side
