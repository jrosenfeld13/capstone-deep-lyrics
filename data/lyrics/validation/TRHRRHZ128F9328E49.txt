People just aint no good
A thing thats well understood
You can see it everywhere you look
People just aint no good

We were married under cherry trees
Under blossom we made our vows
All the blossoms come sailing down
Through the streets and through the playgrounds

The sun would stream on the sheets
Awoken by the morning bird
Wed buy the Sunday newspapers
Never read a single word

[Chorus]
People, they aint no good
People, they aint no good
People, they aint no good at all

Seasons came, seasons went
The winter stripped the blossoms bare
A different tree now lines the streets
Shaking its fists in the air

The winter slammed us like a fist
The windows rattling in the gales
To which she drew the curtains
Made out of her wedding veils

[Chorus]
People, they aint no good
People, they aint no good
People, they aint no good at all

To our love, send a dozen white lilies
To our love, send a coffin of wood
To our love, let all the pink-eyed pigeons coo
That people, they just aint no good

To our love, send back all the letters
To our love, a valentine of blood
To our love, let all the jilted lovers cry
That people, they just aint no good

It aint that in their hearts theyre bad
They can comfort you, some even try
They nurse you when youre ill of health
They bury you when you go and die

It aint that in their hearts theyre bad
Theyd stick by you if they could
But thats just bullshit baby
People just aint no good

[Chorus]
People, they aint no good
People, they aint no good
People, they aint no good at all
