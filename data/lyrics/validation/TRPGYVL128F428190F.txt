Carousing all the evening and the drinking of the wine
The dancing and the winching and the ladies in line
But we'll be lying idle in the morning of the day
Carousing, carousing, carousing away!

And I love to see you angry, then I know you are alive
And you're already rowdy when the flash girls arrive
But we'll be lying idle in the morning of the day
Carousing, carousing, carousing away!

I feel the sickener run in my veins
Holy pulse-quickener, easer of pains
Knower of knowledge and namer of names
Worker and shirker and player of games
Oh holy pulse-quickener, how can this be
That that which unveileith doth also deceive?
Open the bottle and let the wine breathe
Open the bottle and let the wine breathe
