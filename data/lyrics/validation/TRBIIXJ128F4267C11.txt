You've got the cool water when the fever runs high
You've got the look of lovelight in your eyes
And I was in crazy motion till you calmed me down
It took a little time but you calmed me down

When something goes wrong I'm the first to admit it
I'm the first to admit it and the last one to know
When something goes right, well, it's likely to lose me
It's apt to confuse me, 'cause it's such an unusual sight, oh

I can't get used to something so right
Something so right, something so right

They've got a wall in China, it's a thousand miles long
To keep out the foreigners, they've made it strong
And I've got a wall around me that you can't even see
It took a little time to get next to me

Some people never say the words, "I love you"
It's not their style to be so bold
And some people never say those words, "I love you"
But like a child they're longing to be told

When something goes wrong I'm the first to admit it
I'm the first to admit it and I'm the last one to know
When something goes right, oh, it's likely to lose me
It's apt to confuse me because it's such an unusual sight

Well, can't get used to something so right
Something so right, something so right
I can't get used to something so right
Something so right, something so right

Can't get used to something so right
Something so right, something so right
I can't get used to something so right
Something so right, something so right

Something so right, something so right
I can't get used to something so right
