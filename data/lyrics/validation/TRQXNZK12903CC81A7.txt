Knock, knock, knock
Before you enter
'Cause the chances are
I'm with another on the floor
All tangled up
Trying to forget when we were sober

So knock, knock, knock
Before you enter
'Cause the chances are
I'll be with whoever had a car
To drive me home
And alcohol to last until the morning

For every argument I did not start
For every chance you get to break my heart
I face another skirt chase
I think I'm taking someone home

Knock, knock, knock
Before you enter
'Cause the chances are
I'm with another on the floor
All tangled up
Trying to forget when we were sober

So knock, knock, knock
Before you enter
'Cause the chances are
I'll be with whoever had a car
To drive me home
And alcohol to last until the morning

For every argument I did not start
For every chance you get to break my heart
I face another skirt chase
I think I'm taking someone home

For every smile I see you shoot his way
For every indiscretion I will make you pay
It's just another skirt chase
I don't wanna be alone

And I think I've got the right idea
And I think I'm taking someone home

So knock, knock, knock
Before you enter, baby
Knock, knock, knock
I've told you once before
Knock, knock, knock
Before you enter baby
Knock, knock, knock
I'm not asleep behind that door
