So Westwind with your splendor
Take my people by the hand
Spread your glory sunshine off
And unify my promised land

Unify us don't divide us unify us don't divide us
Unify us don't divide us unify us don't divide us
Unify us don't divide us unify us don't divide us

Westwind with your splendor
Take my people by the hand
Spread your glory sunshine out
And unify my promised land
Unify my promised land
Unify my promised land
