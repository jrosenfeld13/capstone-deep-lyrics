We play reggae, we play reggae
And sing it too
We love reggae, we love reggae
And sing it too

And when you listen to the music
It gives your soul a new beginning
And when you rock into the riddim
Then you will feel that irie feeling

Do you know how you're feeling it
When the music gets in your mind
Shake your hips, shake your bodyline
It's the music of all mankind, mankind
Feel it, feel it in your mind
Shake in ??, yeah
Music for all mankind

We play reggae, we play reggae
And know it too
We strum reggae, we strum reggae
And know it too

(..)

We dance reggae, we dance reggae
And rock it too
We skank reggae, we skank reggae
And rock it too

And when you listen to the boogie
It gives your soul a new beginning
And when you rock into the drumming
Then you will feel that irie feeling

Do you know how you're ??
Reggae beat taking over now
Can't we let go your feeling time
Then you'll swing with your..
No way, what it's all about
Reggae's taking over
Put your feeling out
