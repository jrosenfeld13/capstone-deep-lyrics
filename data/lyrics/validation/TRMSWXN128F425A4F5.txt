Why did you have to fire Ramon
I turned around and he was gone
I thought he was on top of the situation
Why did you have to fire him
Guess he was on to something
Just before he got the sudden vacation

But it's

All or nothing
What it's all about
(Basically) don't be a loser
A succer for circumstances
All or nothing
No second chance
Don't be a loser a succer for circumstances
Don't be a loser a succer for circumstances

Why did you have to fire Mandy
I thought she came in handy
She was the good and bad of being
An American
Why did you have to fire her
She started to call me "Sir"
And reminded me of Lucy in disguise
(diamonds?)

But it's

All or nothing
What it's all about
(Basically) don't be a loser
A succer for circumstances
All or nothing
No second chance
Don't be a loser a succer for circumstances
Don't be a loser a succer for circumstances

Are you a fool to believe in me
Am I a fool to believe in you
Are you a fool to believe in me
Am I a fool to believe in you

But it's

All or nothing

What it's all about
(Basically) don't be a loser
A succer for circumstances
All or nothing
No second chance
Don't be a loser a succer for circumstances
