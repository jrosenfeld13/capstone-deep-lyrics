This is a warning
A gun to the head thing
This is a sign
A don't get out of bed thing

The sky was deep
And the wind was hot
And I tried to speak
But I could not
The telephone rang like church bells
Jesus Christ I've gone to hell

A powder burn to the face
To remember you by
A powder burn to the lips
It'll make you cry
A blazing blister kiss
My love, don't you even try
To remember this

Exit everything
Nodding dogs and valium
Let's make this whole world
Spin like a top
And then stop
Exit everything

Here we go again
One more time
Out of the black
And into the ether...

The windows blew out
As you blew in
You wore the smell of success
I wore the taste of sin
With every lie I did you in
Now the siren slowly spins
It'll never last

I backed away from the stars
Because the light cut my skin
Like shards of glass
And the cordite sting
I'm far too late, I'm far too thin
I've lost it all, that's everything
I don't feel a thing

You know you probably heard her
It was the sound of murder
You know, maybe you heard her
This is the sound of murder

Exit everything
Nodding dogs and valium
Let's make this whole world
Spin like a top
And then stop
Exit everything

Exit everything
Torch the throne, kill the king
And teach the whole world to sing
Exit everything
