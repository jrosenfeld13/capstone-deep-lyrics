A boy without a girl
Is a song without a tune
Is a year without a June
My love

A boy without a girl
Is a day without a night
Is a star without a light
My love

And since you've come to me
All the world has come to shine
Cause I've found girl
Who's really mine

And if you stay with me
All your life you'll never be
A girl without a boy
My love

My love, my love

And since you've come to me
All the world has come to shine
Cause I've found girl
Who's really mine

And if you stay with me
All your life you'll never be
A girl without a boy
My love

My love, my love
My love, my love
