Let's get lost
Fingers crossed
It is an ordinary evening
I am broadcasting are you receiving

Sick sick sound
All fall down
It is a necessary evil
Just like highway gas stations and people

I remember golden days when all this was a mystery
And you could write a letter then or god forbid come visit me
And if you find yourself without me
Can you find yourself without me
Can you find yourself without me
Can you find your self without me

Hi I'm fine
You are saying nothing but your tongue is getting blacker all the time
It is a measurable feeling
Seven on a scale from dead to breathing
I've connected speakers to my suitors at the discotheques
And they don't know the difference
Are they men or are they Memorex?
And if you find yourself without me
If you find yourself without me
C'mon find yourself without me
C'mon c'mon c'mon
And take your Listerine

I remember golden days when all this was a mystery
And you could write a letter then or god forbid come visit me
I remember golden days when all this was a mystery
And you could write a letter then or god forbid come visit me

And if you find yourself without me
If you find yourself without me
C'mon find yourself without me
C'mon c'mon c'mon
And take your Listerine
