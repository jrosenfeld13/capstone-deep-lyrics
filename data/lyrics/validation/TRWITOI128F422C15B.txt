I said this is how we're doing
Hold tight, I said hold tight
Giving up my body and my soul

In the night when no bodies around me I call on you, Daddy-O
No one else will do it on you, Daddy-O, Daddy-O
I need affection only your protection is good enough for me, Daddy-O
I can do I'll never be without you, oh Daddy-O

Come into my life, come into my life right now
Gonna make my love, gonna make my love come down
Can't get enough, can't get enough of you
Ain't no other man will ever treat me like you do

In the night when no bodies around me I call on you, Daddy-O
No one else will do it on you, Daddy-O, Daddy-O
I need affection only your protection is good enough for me, Daddy-O
I can do I'll never be without you, oh Daddy-O

I want you in my life, I want you in my life
Gonna feel my love, gonna feel my love come down
I'm so caught up, I'm so caught up in you
Ain't no other man will ever treat me like you do

In the night when no bodies around me I call on you, Daddy-O
No one else will do it on you, Daddy-O, Daddy-O
I need affection only your protection is good enough for me, Daddy-O
I can do I'll never be without you, oh Daddy-O

Hold tight giving up my body and my soul
Hold tight I think I might be losing my control
Hold tight giving up my body and my soul
Hold tight I think I might be losing my control

In the night when no bodies around me (Daddy)
I need affection only your protection
I said hold tight
Giving up my body and my soul

In the night when no bodies around me I call on you, Daddy-O
No one else will do it on you, Daddy-O, Daddy-O
I need affection only your protection is good enough for me, Daddy-O
I can do I'll never be without you, oh Daddy-O

Come on, come on, come a little closer, put one on me, Daddy-O
I won't tell if you keep it on the low, Daddy-O, Daddy-O
The situation ain't no complication, put one on me, Daddy-O
I can do I'll never be without you, oh Daddy-O
