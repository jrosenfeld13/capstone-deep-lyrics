I'm a bow-legged chicken
I'm a knock-kneed hen
Never been so happy
Since I don't know when
I walk with a wiggle and a giggle and a squawk
Doin' the Tennessee wig walk

Hear a tune on a fiddle, on the hardwood floor
Though I'm broke and I'm weary and my back is sore
I walk with a wiggle and a giggle and a squawk
Doin' the Tennessee wig walk

Put your toes together
Your knees apart
Bend your back, get ready to start
Flap your elbows, just for luck
Then you wiggle and you waddle like a baby duck

Dance with me, honey
Tap your toes and glide
And we'll always be together
Side by side
Walk with a wiggle and a giggle and a squawk
Doin' the Tennessee wig walk

I'm a bow-legged chicken
I'm a knock-kneed hen

Though I'm broke and I'm weary and my back is sore
I walk with a wiggle and a giggle and a squawk

So dance with me, honey
Tap your toes and glide
And we'll always be together
Side by side
Walk with a wiggle and a giggle and a squawk
Doin' the Tennessee wig walk

Walk with a wiggle, wiggle with a walk
And you're doin' the Tennessee wig walk

Doin' the Tennessee wig walk
Doin' the Tennessee wig walk
Doin' the Tennessee wig walk
