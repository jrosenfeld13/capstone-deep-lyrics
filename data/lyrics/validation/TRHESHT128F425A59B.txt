Misinformation came around today
She was quite convincing with all she had to say
I was buying everything she had to sell
My eyes grew heavy underneath the spell

Shake me, wake me from my slumber
Lord, I need Your help

Help me keep my eyes wide open
Got to keep my eyes wide open
I will keep my eyes wide open
Help me keep my eyes wide open
Got my eyes wide, eyes wide open
Got to keep my eyes on You

My mind was blinded by the bliss of ignorance
With only half the truth, all I have is wishful thinking
I am trying to be wise, I'm watching You
To keep me far from dulling lullabies

Help me keep my eyes wide open
Got to keep my eyes wide open
I will keep my eyes wide open
Help me keep my eyes wide open
Got my eyes wide, eyes wide open
Got to keep my eyes on You
