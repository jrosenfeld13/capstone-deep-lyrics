Every fucking day this shit seems more the same
Every thing around me makes me wanna bow my head in shame
Going through the motions, I can feel I'm withering away
Bottom of the barrell yelling loud as I can but you don't hear a word I say

Break out, boring life of mediocracy
Break out, do something better set myself free
Break out, don't wanna sit in complacency
Break out, won't live a life of blind stupidity

Do we really have to live this way?
Will we sit around and fucking fade away?

We fuck our heads in a repititive hell
Sedated confinement is my fucking cell
Feeling so trapped like a rat in a cage
So full of fucking anger and I gotta vent my rage

Do we really have to live this way?
Will we sit around and fucking fade away?

It's like life is one big revolving door
Every step that you take forward you're in the same place you were before
Gonna fight till the death to fucking break away
Gotta say something before I fucking go insane

Break out, won't be controlled gonna get away
Break out, I'll fucking survive in my own way
Break out, breaking out cause I don't fit
Break out, don't wanna wade in this pile of shit
Break out, boring life of mediocracy
Break out, do something better set myself free
Break out, don't wanna sit in complacency
