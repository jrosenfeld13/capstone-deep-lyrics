We've only just begun to live
White lace and promises
A kiss for luck and we're on our way

Before the rising sun we fly
So many roads to choose
We start our walking and learn to run
And yes, we've just begun

Sharin' horizons that are new to us
Watchin' the signs along the way
Talkin' it over just the two of us
Workin' together day to day, together

And when the evening comes we'll smile
So much of life ahead
We'll find a place where there's room to grow
And yes, we've just begun

Sharin' horizons that are new to us
Watchin' the signs along the way
Talkin' it over just the two of us
Workin' together day to day, together

And when the evening comes we'll smile
So much of life ahead
We'll find a place where there's room to grow
And yes, we've just begun, we've only just begun, too late
