We don't need the world outside, we've got all we need tonight
Love is Enough, oooh yeah yeah
Let 'em say what they wanna say, when you're holdin' me this way
Love is Enough
Everybody searchin' for a piece of mind, all they gotta do is look at you and I

Chorus:
Baby, just wait and see you can always count on me, When times getting tough
You're the reason that i'm livin' nothing that i wouldn't give
Love is Enough
May never have a lot of money, but it don't really matter honey
Love is Enough
Ain't it funny how 4 little letters, can hold it all together
Love is Enough
Even when we're old and gray, i'll be here and you can still hear me say

(chorus)
Long kisses and a tender touch, 2 hearts make a leap
What else do we need?
(chorus
