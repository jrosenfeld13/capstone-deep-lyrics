[Intro, Marvin Gaye, spoken]
Hey homeboy, how come everywhere you go
You have to go in a limousine, man?

[Other man]
Hey, man that's my thing

MG: I know it's your thing
Every time I see you, you're awful clean
You got your rings, jewelry on
Y'know

Other: Flashin' cash is what I need

MG: I can understand it

[Verse 1]
Oohh
I got the baddest cool
Could never be the fool
The ladies wait to get down with me
The love I make's superb
To doubt me is absurd
The latest and the greatest, you see

[Verse 2]
Oohh oo oohh
I want to have your spot
And more than what you got
I bought the baddest house I could find
All it must be said I'm greatest in the bed
And when I love a lady she's mine
I know I'm really hot
My diamonds shine a lot
Check out here this 450 SE babe (Ego trippin' out)

[Chorus]
I'm what's its all about
Ego tripping out (hey, tripping out, hey tripping out, you're tripping out, your tripping out)
Ahh ha hey hey
Without a doubt
I know we ego tripping out
Sometimes it's a shame
But it caused so much pain
He don't want you, baby
I know you ego tripping out
'times it's a shame but it can't do without
Without a doubt
I know you're ego tripping out
Hey she don't know it
But ain't it a shame, all the pain to come

[Verse 3]
I'm better than the rest
Check out the way I dress
And got a lot of money to spend
The best club in town
Is where I get down
You're lucky if I choose you my friend

[Verse 4]
Walk the greatest walk
I got to be the talk
I've got the greatest show in town
Woohoo! Rock with your other man then roll over to me
So I can thrill your soul baby
Aoow check out the love man standing tall and bold
Can fulfill your needs, too cold, baby
Needless to say, I'm your greatest play
Ego tripping out, ooh, ego tripping out
Yeah, ego tripping out, woooh!

[Outro]
In my mind what it's for
Got a sweet tooth for the chick on the floor
Walking in my shoes
Walking to the beat
Still got some love inside
And some good old body heat
Aoow
Oh, baby
Spread the news
Only here to deepen my soul
No it ain't about money
Aoow
Turn the fear into energy
'cause the toot and the smoke
Won't fulfil the need
Aoow hey, hey
Only one way
Only one way
Wooh!
Feel the feelin, energy of the kiss
