Rrrrah!

Well, the first time we met, she seemed just like a puzzle
Keeping all the answers a-to herself
Savin' up her feelings for some rainy day
Keepin' them on the shelf
For a magic moment

As the time slowly passed, I played my hand so careful
I began to wonder who was really foolin' who
She said "Nothing ventured, nothing will be gained"
Then suddenly my plan fell through
It was a magic moment

(Have you been denied?) If you feel you've been denied
(Did I see you cry?) Then darlin' don't you cry
(Time is on your side) 'Cause time is on our side

Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
Whoa

(Have you been denied?) If you feel you've been denied
(Did I see you cry?) Then darlin' don't you cry
(Time is on your side) 'Cause time is on our side

Well, you can spend your precious time
And you can spend your money
You can wait for all the answers by the phone

The magic moments don't come every day
They're slippin' away

Was a magic moment
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo
Magic moment

Doo doo doo doo doo
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo
