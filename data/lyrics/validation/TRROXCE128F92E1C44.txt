Im in the groove
But all you do is rag
Come on now, baby
Dont be a drag
Dont be a drag, baby
Dont be a drag on me
Dont be a drag now, baby
Come on an let me be

Do what I please
Anytime I want
But somebody else
Always saying, Dont
Dont be a drag, baby
Dont be a drag on my mind
Dont be a drag now, baby
On my rockin good time

Your drawers are funky
Your hair is incorrect
And when I dig that dress
Cold chills down my back
That dress is a drag, baby
That dress is a drag on you
The dress it look better now, baby
On a monkey in the zoo
