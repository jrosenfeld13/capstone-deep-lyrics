They kick and they fight
Over a parking space on Saturday night
Put on their village face
I believe it's alright to kick their ass out of town
Born and bred white
Poverty's so cool, your parents who live on
Madison Avenue while some of us just suffer to live

It's me, my beeper, my car, my brand name
It's me, I'm a fashion punk with all the accessories
Talk and they talk about the struggle and the price they pay
Take up my space, what a waste of humanity
You follow the trend, you're a bolt on the treadmill
You're giving them what they want, they'll have control of you next year
Who's telling you you're any better than the next one?
You're giving them what they want, they'll have control of you next

[Chorus]
Born and bred white
Why don't you go away?

Government soldiers occupy every corner of the street
You run for cover to hide from what's killing me
Keep on talking, talk to me please
Wake me up, I've fallen asleep

They kick and they fight
Over a parking space on Saturday night
Put on their village face
I believe it's alright to kick their ass out of town
Born and bred white
Poverty's so cool, your parents who live on
Madison Avenue while some of us just suffer to live

[Chorus]
Born and bred white
Why don't you go away?
