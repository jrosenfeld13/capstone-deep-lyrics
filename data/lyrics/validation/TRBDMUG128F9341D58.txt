I'm so happy that I've found someone to love
I'm so happy that I've found someone I can trust
It's like a dream that I never want to wake from
I'm so caught up with you I swear you're all that I think of
How you love me, how you deal with my insanities
Sometimes I just can't believe that I'm finally where I need to be
And...

[Chorus:]
I'm so happy that I've found someone to love
I'm so happy that I've found someone I can trust
I'm so happy 'cause I know that you really love me too
And I smile every day 'cause my heart overflows with you

You're the first and the last thought of my day
You're a constant presence in my mind in my ocean you're the waves
In my sand you're the grain
You wash away my pain
You're the friend I never had
You're the strength of my reality

[Chorus]
It's been so heard for me to finally find you
Bot now that you're in my heart
My mind is free, my soul is free

[Chorus]
