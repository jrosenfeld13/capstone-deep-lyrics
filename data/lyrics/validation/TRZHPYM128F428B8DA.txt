Got eight hours till the coming sunrise
Till another day of artificial grace
In my mind I'm chasing bad guys
Thru empty streets and dark alleways

I'm a crimestopper, a good copper
I kick the doors in
Bad against good in my neighbourhood
Stand aside and watch it all begin

A police car howls in the distance
The city sleeps but I'm wide awake
Well I don't know where the world is going
Listen up! Step on the breaks

I'm out there
Midnight hour, I'm feeling tense
Yeah I'm out there
Fighting the edge of broken sence
