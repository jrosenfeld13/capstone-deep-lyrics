Memories of random events
Fill my days walks
Insignificant moments taken too hard mental concrete
Mistakes taken for granted

Routines begin again
Swallowed smoke and drywall dust
Facial creases expression weathered

Alligator allegory
Oh Lord my shoulder bears shit
Over and over something sorely missing
But it ain't hardly cousin
But supposing he already
Knows what's happening and coming
Hardly a whisper in my ear
But tea by candlelight

Sitting in a tree
High overlooking
These trees hills
Words don't really describe that motion
So heavy in these woods
Fall's somber lonesome
Brought it with me as well
Death always on my mind

Alligator allegory
Oh Lord my shoulder bares shit
Over and over something sorely missing
But it ain't hardly cousin
But supposing he already
Knows what's happening and coming
Hardly a whisper in my ear
But tea by candlelight

You ain't real
Busted wing full moon vibe reader
Dickhead
There is why they call them dog's dog
And when this story ends
I pick up my guitar
Swollen with content
Alone quietly feeling

Hide my soul and cry

Strumming six strings
Gentle power struggle
No don't tape it for outer space
Squint Inner atom
Let your mind's voices go
Just keep your hands moving
Abstain from making moves
For once forget daytime lists

Hide my soul and cry

Take that hard hat off
Suction solder crib
Burn butt naked
Get your tone
Work on your soul bends
Scrape and scrub and
Polish de punk
Shift perspective on to the next
And all signs point ahead
Into my memory

Hide my soul and cry

[Two-guitar braid]
Waiting on my two lives call
[Two-guitar braid]

You get ignorant
As quick as you can
Yes man
Playing on people's emotions
St Anne scum bag
Quicksand
Ain't shit boy
[Whoo growl]
Oh people think you're crazy
Squawking in gibberish like this
Acting glad
Acting sad
Passing off bullshit as truth
No wonder where you are tonight

Oh my darling...
