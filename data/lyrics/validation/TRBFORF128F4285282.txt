Sail on silver wings
Through this storm what fortune love may bring
Back to my arms again
The love of a former golden age

I am disabled by fears
Concerning which course to take
For now that wheels are turning
I find my faith deserting me

This night is filled with the cries
Of dispossessed children in search of paradise
A sign of unresolved ambition
Drives the pinwheel on and on

I am disabled by fears
Concerning which course to take
When memory bears witness to
The innocents consumed in dying rage

The way lies through our love
There can be no other means to the end
Or keys to my heart you will never find
You will never find
