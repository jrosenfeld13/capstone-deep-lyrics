When you've climbed the highest mountain
When a cloud holds the sunshine in
Suddenly there's a valley
Where the earth knows peace with man
When a storm hides the distant rainbow
And you think you can't find a friend
Suddenly there's a valley
Where friendships never end
Touched only by the seasons
Swept clean by the waving grain
Surveyed by a happy bluebird
And kissed by the falling rain
When you think there's no bright tomorrow
And you feel you can't try again
Suddenly there's a valley
Where hope and love begin
Suddenly there's a valley
