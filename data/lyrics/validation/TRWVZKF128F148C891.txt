It's immoral to encourage others to accept injustice you do not endure
Such superficial optimism a deepness not so pure
Anesthetic presence with an undefined concern
With images so glorified but still where is our cure
Give! Where's your fire?
Movements definition unclear amid definite crises
Retreating carelessly with persuasions that seem to never end
And must immarilty become so monumental before we see?
Give! Where's your fire?
Out my face! Out my face!
Pseudo-intellectual moderate steppin' to dis
And you say that my concerns don't burn with validity
Trying to check me got nothing to prove "be"
On with the privilege shit-talking blood of my people your mocking
If it came down to dying I would see that ass running
Say full belly-buster you willing to suffer and put your ass on the line and fool help me gets mine!
Give! Where's your fire?
