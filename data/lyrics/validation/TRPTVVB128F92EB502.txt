The city lights spin in my head
Another night, can't go to bed
Across the street, I hear a telephone
The shadows dancing by, I'm on my own

The lonely avenue, the hours passing through
These never-ending dreams of you
The silence of my room, the darkness of the night
These never-ending dreams of you

The sun goes down, the day is dead
I feel the evening air blow 'round my head
I see the house, I knock the door
Expecting you to come just like before

The visions in the night, the pictures of my life
These never-ending dreams of you
The secret never told, the way the song unfolds
These never-ending dreams of you

The crying moon, the distant fire
The howling winter wind, the singing wire
The shining sea, the open sky
The frozen memory of days gone by

The lonely avenue, the hours passing through
These never-ending dreams of you
The silence of my room, the darkness of the night
These never-ending dreams of you

The visions in the night, the pictures of my life
These never-ending dreams of you
The secret never told, the way the song unfolds
These never-ending dreams of you
