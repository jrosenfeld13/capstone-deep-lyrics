Would you stop talking?
Because I don't think we agree
You're always keeping all your borders up
I think that something must be wrong with me

Well I know you don't like it
You're no exclusive company
You're always keeping all your borders up
And it's a little more than you and me
Yeah

Well somebody's had a harder time
But you're always on the outside
And they've been giving you the run around
And now you're trying to get your own back

Ah
Ah
Well I know you don't like it
You're no exclusive company
You're always keeping all your borders up
And it's a little more than you and me
I'm not guilty

Well I better say something
To stop us creeping round these avenues
Your always keeping all your borders up, I bet your getting a little confused
I don't think so

Well it's time to turn this thing around
When there's no reason for this thing you found
Well your keeping all your borders up
I think it's time we tore them all down

You gotta fight for a reason, what's your reason?
You never cared
You gotta fight for a reason, what's your reason?
You never cared
You gotta fight for a reason, what's your reason?
You never cared
You gotta fight for a reason, what's your reason?
You never cared
You gotta fight for a reason, what's your reason?
You never cared
