Appalachian woman
A blizzard tearing screw (?)
Of what she sees before her
She'll suffer once for you

Appalachian woman
Shooting savages from her head
Rapid eyes are burning
Of the wine that drunk him dry

All my friends are alcoholics
Temptations drip from their eyes
And man I'm so tired living in this shit
Cast iron hate, black angels to the right

Steaming locomotive, she's past the '68
Butchered on the highway, there's glitter on the rain
