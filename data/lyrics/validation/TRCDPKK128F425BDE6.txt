The smart money's(2) on Harlow, and the moon is in the street
And the shadow boys are breakin' all the laws
And you're east of East St. Louis(3), and the wind is making speeches
The smart money's(2) on Harlow, and the moon is in the street
And the shadow boys are breakin' all the laws
And you're east of East St. Louis(3), and the wind is making speeches
And the rain sounds like a round of applause

And Napoleon(4) is weepin' in a carnival saloon
His invisible fiancee's in the mirror
And the band is goin' home, it's rainin' hammers, it's rainin' nails
And it's true, there's nothin' left for him down here

And it's time, time, time
And it's time, time, time
And it's time, time, time that you love
And it's time, time, time

And they all pretend they're orphans, and their memory's like a train
You can see it gettin' smaller as it pulls away
And the things you can't remember tell the things you can't forget
That history puts a saint in every dream

Well, she said she'd stick around until the bandages came off
But these mama's boys just don't know when to quit
And Matilda(5) asks the sailors, 'Are those dreams or are those prayers?'
So close your eyes, son, and this won't hurt a bit

Oh, it's time, time, time
And it's time, time, time
And it's time, time, time that you love
And it's time, time, time

Well, things are pretty lousy for a calendar girl
The boys just dive right off the cars and splash into the street
And when they're on a roll(6), she pulls a razor from her boot
And a thousand pigeons fall around her feet

So put a candle in the window(7) and a kiss upon his lips
As the dish outside the window fills with rain
Just like a stranger with the weeds in your heart
And pay the fiddler(6) off till I come back again

Oh, it's time, time, time
And it's time, time, time
And it's time, time, time that you love
And it's time, time, time

And it's time, time, time
And it's time, time, time
And it's time, time, time that you love
And it's time, time, time
