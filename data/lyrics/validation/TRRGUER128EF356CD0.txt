There ain't a girl alive who likes to look in the mirror like you do
There ain't a girl alive who likes to look in the mirror like you do
There ain't a girl alive who likes to look in the mirror like you do
There ain't a girl alive who likes to look in the mirror like you do

Yeah you love your reflection
Looking back at you
With your long blond hair
And your leggie legs

Yeah you like to go the shopping mall
They got mirrors wall to wall
You like to be on the centre stage
You can see adulation on a thousand faces

It gets your motor running wild
Any object that shines
It's a great opportunity
To look yourself in your big beautiful eyes

There ain't a girl alive who likes to look in the mirror like you do
There ain't a girl alive who likes to look in the mirror like you do
There ain't a girl alive who likes to look in the mirror like you do
There ain't a girl alive who likes to look in the mirror like you do

Wanna see the juices flow
Just stand you next to a mirror
Any polished metal
Can't pass up the chance
To see the image that you love the most

You like to go the shopping mall
They got mirrors wall to wall
You like to be on the centre stage
You can see adulation on a thousand faces

There ain't a girl alive who likes to look in the mirror like you do
There ain't a girl alive who likes to look in the mirror like you do
There ain't a girl alive who likes to look in the mirror like you do
There ain't a girl alive who likes to look in the mirror like you do
