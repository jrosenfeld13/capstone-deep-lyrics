Since day one you've been away
And since then you've, you've made me stay
Alone in a world where I'd like to hear
The words of approval ringing in my ear
Cuz I don't ask for much
Yet I want it all
I've gained nothing from this
You want to see me fall
But we will stick to our passions
We'll keep playing far and away
Alone in a world where I'd like to see
The smile on your face which means security
Cuz I don't ask for much
Yet I want it all
I've gained nothing from this
You want to see me fall
Don't live life by the norm in society
Do what you have to do to keep you happy
And what if it doesn't add up to them at all?
It makes sense to you, keep on, don't stall
Don't live life by the norm in society
Do what you have to do to keep you happy
And what if it doesn't add up to them at all?
It makes sense to you, keep on, don't stall

Cuz I don't ask for much
Yet I want it all
I've gained nothing from this
You want to see me fall
