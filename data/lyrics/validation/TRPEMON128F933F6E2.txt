Women think I'm tasty, always tryin' to waste me
Make me burn the candle right down
But baby, baby, I don't need no jewels in my crown

It's all you women is low down gamblers
Cheatin' like I don't know how
But baby, baby, there's fever in the funk house now
This low down bitchin' got my poor feet a-itchin'
Don't you know the duece is still wild

Baby, I can't stay
You got to roll me and call me the tumblin' dice
Always in a hurry, never stop to worry
Don't see the time flashin' by
Honey, got no money
I'm all sixes, sevens and nines
Say now, baby, I'm the rank outsider
You can be my partner in crime

Baby, I can't stay
You got to roll me and Call me the tumblin' dice
Call me the tumblin' dice
Oh, my, my, my, I'm the lone crap shooter
Playin' the field every night

Baby, I can't stay
You got to roll me and call me the tumblin' dice
(You got to roll me)
Call me the tumblin' dice
(You got to roll me)
Call me the tumblin' dice
(You got to roll me)
