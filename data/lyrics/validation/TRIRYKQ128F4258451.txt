Full moon stares at me
From the ceiling
Shadows are sucking
At my breath

Mind mumbles
In its hibernated halfworld
Love and life grow cold
Foretold of their death

Loneliness is full of echoes
Distant calls
You know you're lost
When they're coming
Out of the walls

Angels of pain
You'll fight in vain
They'll get inside you
They'll drive you insane

Angels of pain
You'll fight in vain
They'll make you reach
Your final breaking strain

Wingbeat, heartbeat
The rhythms are alike
Loe one, flutter, stop
And down you go

The jar that holds
This God created spirit
Breaks if you bring
Its host too low

Loneliness is full of echoes
Distant calls
You know you're lost
When they're coming
Out of the walls

The sunken stare in their eyes
Hollow and blind
Faces with no expression
Always leering once behind

Angels of pain...

It's not the years
That wear you down
You grow old by
What they contain

If you choose to bleed
The last laugh is on you
Mocking you
To the oblivion
The angels of pain

Sometimes
I get compelled by the mirrors
To see the image
Of what might have been

Hours turn to eons
I dare not to blink my eye
Haunted face of myself
Is all that I've seen

The message brought home
Is not gentle "father to son"
They throw the revelations
Like bullts from a gun

Angels of pain...

They'll make you reach
Your final breaking strain
They will drive you insane
They'll never leave
The angels of pain
