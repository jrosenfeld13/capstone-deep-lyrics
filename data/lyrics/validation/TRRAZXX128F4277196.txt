Back from the dead
Across the axis of dreams
A malicious hunger
The bloodline still streams
I am a martyr of the dark side
A tyrant in soul and flesh

Triumphant I stand in a blaze of fire
As dark silhouettes of dancing shadows
Caress me with desire
I rise from the abyss below

A disciple of darkness
Bound to this earth
The spirit wander
In a realm of emptiness
I am a martyr of the dark side
A tyrant in soul and flesh

My art is a reflection, a mirror of tormented images
A labyrinth of morbid minds cathedral halls of stone
Abysmal ruins

Walking a path of putrefied flesh
In the garden of rotting sculptures
Everything dwells in an aura of death
And the presence of nocturnal vultures
