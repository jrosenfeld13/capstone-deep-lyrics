Look across the land
What was green with sand
It's all got out of hand
The sea is full of shit
No-one to admits to it
Just my frame of mind
Toxic fumes are in the air
Ask questions -- no-one cares
Who's values, mine or theirs?

Standing on the outside looking in
Search your soul, children of a nation
Global corrosion -- its a sin
Search your soul, children of a nation
Seeds of destruction have been sown again
Search your soul, children of a nation
Together we stand, ease the pain
Search your soul, children of a na-na-na-na-nation

Vision of decay -
All mankind will pay
Waiting for the day
One man's stand against
The making of the plan
The future's in our hands
Mornings broken
And the world's awoken
To a better place

Standing on the outside looking in
Search your soul, children of a nation
Global corrosion -- its a sin
Search your soul, children of a nation
Seeds of destruction have been sown again
Search your soul, children of a nation
Together we stand, ease the pain
Search your soul, children of a na-na-na-na-nation

Nothing happens
Question's asked
Still no answers
What is the fucking point?
What is the fucking point?

Standing on the outside looking in
Search your soul, children of a nation
Global corrosion -- its a sin
Search your soul, children of a nation
Seeds of destruction have been sown again
Search your soul, children of a nation
Together we stand, ease the pain
Search your soul, children of a na-na-na-na-nation
Nation, nations unite
