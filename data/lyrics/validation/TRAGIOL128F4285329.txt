I can see a new expression on my face
I can feel a strange senstation taking place
I can hear the guitars playing lovely tunes
Everytime that you walk in the room

I close my eyes for a second and pretend
It's me you want
Meanwhile I try to act so nonchalant
I see a summer night with a magic moon
Everytime that you walk in the room

Maybe it's a dream come true
Standing right alongside of you
Wish I could show you how much I care
But I only have the nerve to stare

I can feel that something pounding in my brain
Just anytime that someone speaks your name
Trumpets sound and I hear thunder boom
Everytime that you, everytime that you
Everytime that you, walk in the room
