There's a sign on my door, say's I'm not here anymore, cause I've been missing for so long, I can't
Remember where I've gone

I wish to hell that I could cry, I'd feel better, count me in, I'm one of the Low Millions, like
Her, like him, just one of the Low Millions

I'm disconnected to myself, there isn't anybody else, that I can point to that I know, who isn't
Being torn by the undertow

I wish to hell that I could cry, I'd feel better, count me in, I'm one of the Low Millions, like
Her, like him, just one of the Low Millions

I'm an alien in my own skin, I'm fishing where the ice is thin, I'm holding it all up with safety
Pins, I'm sitting on nitroglycerin

I wish to hell that I could cry, I'd feel better, count me in, I'm one of the Low Millions, like
Her, like him, just one of the Low Millions

I'm an alien in my own skin, I'm fishing where the ice is thin, I'm holding it all up with safety
Pins, I'm sitting on nitroglycerin

And I, I'm one of the Low Millions
And I, I'm one of the Low Millions
Lookin' down, Lookin' down, Lookin' down
