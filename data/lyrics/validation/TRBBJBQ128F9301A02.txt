Got myself a crying, talking, sleeping, walking, Living Doll
Gotta do my best to please her just 'cos she's a Living Doll
I gotta roving eye and that is why she satisfies my soul
Got my one and only walking, talking, Living Doll

Take look at her hair, it's real
You don't believe what I say just feel
Gonna lock her up in a trunk
So no big hunk can steal her away from me

Got myself a crying, talking, sleeping, walking, Living Doll
Gotta do my best to please her just 'cos she's a Living Doll
I gotta roving eye and that is why she satisfies my soul
Got my one and only walking, talking, Living Doll

Take look at her hair, it's real
You don't believe what I say just feel
Gonna lock her up in a trunk
So no big hunk can steal her away from me

Got myself a crying, talking, sleeping, walking, Living Doll
Gotta do my best to please her just 'cos she's a Living Doll
I gotta roving eye and that is why she satisfys my soul
Got my one and only walking, talking, Living Doll
