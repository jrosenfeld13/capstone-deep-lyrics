Standing bold Romantic Warrior
Timeless one in amour gold
Giving your message to warriors all
The victory of victories is about to be told
Dont succumb to the sorceress warriors
Tarnishing your purpose bright
Have your senses yet to have their fill
Of battles old and fearsome stories told each night
Youve wandered off the path my warrior friends
Those pictures painted in your weary eyes
Tell of age old times gone by
When you fought and jousted cross the skies
In those battled faces etched so deep
Are stories of those gruesome duels
When locked in combat for a thousand years
You earned the title tyrants cruel
But even in those loud victorious cries
The magician spun a strange defeat
For as you smote from view the jester bright
Your battered selves lay at your feet
The sadness in your hearts ring out
Protesting those whose silent will
Led you to this bloodstained trail
And you can't recall deciding to kill
Pick up the gauntlet warriors
Sheath your swords put up your trusty lance
Channel the power used to rush every foe
Into giving the future a chance
Believe in yourselves old warriors bold
Create a path so firm and sure
Fight for the birth of the freedom of man
The end of this medieval overture
