City life
Steals your rights
Robs you of your dignity
Robs you of your sanity
City life
Lose your soul
Insanity
Till you wonder
Endlessly with a untrack mind

For no one
Will i go to hell
For no one
Will i go to hell
For no one

Take me away from this madness
Take me away from this sadness

Dont wan't to be part of your confusion
Dont wan't to be part of your corruption
And be fooled by illusion

For no one
Will i go to hell
For no one
Will i go to hell
For no one

One of your subhuman
Goes the ruth without the ruth
Makes hollow sounds to my ear
You've got curse to drive and
Ships to sail and
Blains to fly
And material possesions
Bet i've got mount things to plain

For no one
I ain't go into hell
For no one
For no one
For no one
Will i go to hell
For no one
Will i go to hell
For no one
