Fame, is what drives a man
To the center of the earth
Master and servants, kings and knights
They will fight for what they're worth
Any man, with a golden tongue
Who's miracles are for sale
Pleasure for pain, salvation for loss
On your coffin he's the nail
Why waste
Any precious time, to wait would be a shame
This taste
Is of victory, with all but you to blame
Why waste
Because in the end, you're grateful for your name
See this man, hear his words, they're the Prophecies of Fame
Try to withstand the Prophecies of Fame
Fame, see how we're convinced
He describes the goal you'll reach
Questions and answers, weakness and strength
Devotion is what they preach
Raise your hand
Share your country's pride
As one we stand
Devotion nation-wide
By the time you've lived your life
Memories are all you need
Where're my children, where's my wife?
Torn by pride and greed
All alone
In my grief at home
In my endless roam, why?
Enter the gates of deception my friend
Here lies no path, no beginning, no end
Try to withstand the Prophecies of Fame
