[Verse 1]
I've been waitin' for my dreams
To turn into something I could believe in
And lookin' for that magic rainbow
On the horizon, I couldn't see it

[Pre-Chorus]
Until I let go, gave into love
And watched all the bitterness burn
Now I'm comin' alive, body and soul
Feelin' my world start to turn

[Chorus]
And I'll taste every moment and live it out loud
I know this is the time, this is the time to be
More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time, this is the time of my life
Time of my life

[Verse 2]
Holdin' onto things that vanished into the air
Left me in pieces
But now I'm risin' from the ashes
Finding my wings
And all that I needed

[Pre-Chorus]
Was there all along within' my reach
As close as the beat of my heart

[Chorus]
And I'll taste every moment and live it out loud
I know this is the time, this is the time to be
More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time, this is the time of my life
The time of my life

[Bridge]
And I'm out on the edge of forever
Ready to run
Keeping my feet on the ground
Arms open wide, face to the sun

[Chorus]
And I'll taste every moment and live it out loud
I know this is the time, this is the time to be
More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time, this is the time of my life
My life
More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time, this is the time of my life
This is the time of my life
The time of my life
The time of my life
