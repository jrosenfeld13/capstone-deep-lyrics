Well I wish I was your sweet little honey man
Just a hanging 'round the rising sun
You know you can't hold out against a boy who's
A whiskey fast and a honey slow;
I wish I was, I wish I was your
I wish I was your honey man
I wish I was your, sweet little honey man;
And when the bee's inside the hive
You gonna holler in the thick of love
I'll buy you all the jag I can
This honey man's gonna' sting you again;

A when I come a home to you honey
Oh, your little eyes never flicker
I wished I was that cool
And then your love just a wouldn't matter at all
