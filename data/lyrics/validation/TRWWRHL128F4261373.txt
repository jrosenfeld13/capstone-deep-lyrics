I know all your moods and faces
You try a gaze that paralyses
Stand back from nobody and none
And drop your panties for a number one

You stick at nothing with the things you're running for
But don't tread on those who've served your scheme once more

[Chorus:]
You're a bore, you whore

Let down friends are not to mention
You pretend to relieve your tension
I know that you can't love anyone
But you say you get the bloke you want
You feign like no other when you're out to reach a goal
You give what you get, but nothing's free at all

I know all your moods and faces
You try a gaze that paralyses
You say you get the bloke you want
But I know you're a sleazy cunt

But that's the way you are...
