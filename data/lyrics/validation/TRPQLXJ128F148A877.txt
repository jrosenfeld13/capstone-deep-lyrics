If you wanna know me
You gotta dig my style
You gotta show me
And go where nobody knows
And when you find me
You gotta show me you're real
Girl you're on my mind

Ready or not here comes the thunder
Ready or not I'm closing in

You don't have anybody
Who's gonna help you now
And if you need somebody
No one will hear you scream

You don't have anybody
Who's gonna save you now
And if you need somebody
No one will hear you scream

If you wanna know me
You gotta reach my soul
You gotta show me
Where you want me to go
And when you touch me
I lose my gravity
Girl you're on my mind

Ready or not here comes the thunder
Ready or not I'm closing in

When ever you want just bring on the thunder
Ready or not I'm closing in

You don't have anybody
Who's gonna help you now
And if you need somebody
No one will hear you scream

You don't have anybody
Who's gonna save you now
And if you need somebody
No one will hear you scream

How does it feel now are you holding your own
You got to feel it got to make it your own

You don't have anybody
Who's gonna help you now
And if you need somebody
No one will hear you scream

You don't have anybody
Who's gonna save you now
And if you need somebody
No one will hear you scream
