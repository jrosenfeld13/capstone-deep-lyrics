Ten miles east of the highway
Hot sparks burnin' the night away
Two lips touchin' together
Cheek to cheek, sweatshirt to sweater

Young love, born in a back seat
Two hearts pound out a backbeat
Headlights, somebody's comin'
Got to move, keep on a runnin'

With the hot rod hearts
Out on the boulevard tonight
Here come those hungry sharks
Up from the bottom for another bite

Schoolgirl brushes her hair back
Blue jeans can't hide the bare facts
Bad boy knows where to find her
Runs the light, sneaks up behind her

Hot rod hearts
Out on the boulevard tonight
Here come those hungry sharks
Up from the bottom for another bite

True believers livin' on the borderline
They're just dreamers killin' time
(They're just killin' time)
Killin' time

(They're just killin' time)
Killin' time
(Out on the borderline)

Times are hard for those hot rod hearts
Out on the boulevard tonight
(Here come)
Here com the hungry sharks
Up from the bottom for another bite

Girl with the hot rod heart tonight
Girl with the hot rod heart tonight
(Keep runnin')
With the hot rod hearts
Out on the boulevard tonight
