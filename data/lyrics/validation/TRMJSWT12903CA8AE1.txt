[Verse 1]
Lump sat alone in a boggy marsh
Totally emotionless except for her heart
Mud flowed up into lump's pajamas
She totally confused all the passing piranhas

[Chorus]
She's lump, she's lump
She's in my head
She's lump, she's lump, she's lump
She might be dead

[Verse 2]
Lump lingered last in line for brains
And the one she got was sorta rotten and insane
Small things so sad that birds could land
Is lump fast asleep or rockin' out with the band?

[Chorus]


[Interlude]
Ba ba ba ba banana. (3x)
Ba baw

[Verse 3]
Lump was limp and lonely and needed a shove
Lump slipped on a kiss and tumbled into love
She spent her twenties between the sheets
Life limped along at sub-sonic speeds

[Chorus]

Woo!


[Outro]
Is this lump outta my head?
I think so
Is this lump outta my head?
I think so
Is this lump outta my head?
I think so
Is this lump outta my head?
