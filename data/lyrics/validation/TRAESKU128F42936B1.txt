Ooh-oooh
Ooh-oooh

Why?
Why are you messin'
It up for me?
Why?
Why are you not happy for me?

Remember the times
We talked alone
I was ... we were never bored
I miss the times
You held my hand
Now it's not necessary

I said why did you
Have to go and change
The way that could be
Why did you have to
Can't you see what
It's meant to be?
It's gotta be

(Refrain:)
Why?
Why are you messin'
It up for me?
Why?
Why are you not happy for me?
Why?
I said why? oh-oh

So tell me now
There there yeah can you
Be happy for me?
So tell me now
There there yeah will you
Be happy for me?

Every time I talk with you
I break a wall
I break in two
I may be wrong in what I feel
Oh baby, please
Won't you let me in?

I'm beggin' you
Let it make it right
Oh baby now

I said Why?
Why are you messin'
It up for me?
I said Why?
Why are you not happy for me?
I said Why?
I said Why? oh-oh

So tell me now
There there yeah why
You're not happy for
Me?
So tell me now
There there yeah can you
Be happy for me?
So tell me now
There there yeah can you
Be happy for me?
So tell me now
There there yeah will you
Be happy for me?
