If all our flights are grounded
Libby, well go to Paris
Dance along the boulevards
And have no one to embarrass
Puttin on the Ritz in style
With an Arab and an Heiress
Libby, well fly anyway, heyyyy
And leave behind our blues
Half sung melodies
We'll trade them all in
For a Paris breeze
Libby well fly

See how dark the circles grow
In a town that has no light
So many eyes just staring out
Into the bloodshot night
And Libby, I hate to see you cry
And I want to share it all with you
And if it brings us to our knees
Well trade it all in for a Paris breeze
Libby well fly

They say it dont come easy
And they say that love is blind
If youre afraid to be close
Then love is hard to find
And if you spend too much time winning love
Theres no time to be kind
And Libby Im guilty of your crimes
Im just another passenger
Traveling on these crazy high seas
Very likely be the same
In a Paris breeze
Libby well fly

If all our flights are grounded
Libby well go to Paris
And wish we were back home again
Or sailing on the ocean
Just a window and a drink
To set our dreams in motion
But Libby, well fly anyway, heyyyy
And leave our blues
Half sung melodies
Trade them in for a Paris breeze
Libby well fly
