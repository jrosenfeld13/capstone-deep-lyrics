Going down the dole got to sign on
Millions of kids with nowt to do
You better watch out they're after you

Alternative
I don't wanna join the army
Alternative
I know it's a waste of time
Alternative
No alternative is what they say
Alternative
The choice is mine

Politicians what do they care
They're all money grabbers they're after their share
They don't even care if you get shot
Cause there ain't no way they'll be there

Do you really want to die
Alternative
Kill other people just to survive
Alternative
Only the dead have their freedom
Alternative
It's the living that's got to suffer most
