Please take my hand, and let me lead you through these museum halls
My god, the light casts an ugly shadow across these decaying walls
And should I ask you, is that fear I see etched across your sullen eyes?
Because inside this house, behind these cold stone walls
You can hide amongst the candlelight but you cannot hide your voice
