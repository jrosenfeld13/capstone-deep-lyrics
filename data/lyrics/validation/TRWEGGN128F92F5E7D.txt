Yeah, get ready
I'm gonna show you how to do this
'Cause it's so sweet
Let me here, it's a
Say yeah, yeah

I ain't seen nothin' on the late, late show
Got my hook, line and sinker, ready to go
My dogs got tired so I took 'em on a trip
Well, I was workin' all night until I slipped my disk

I'm a shooter, a looter, a runaway train
I got a love drug pusher to rattle my brain
Lots of women, to swim in 'cause that's rock 'n' roll
I'm the ace in your hole

Get wise to the rise
I'm the king of the mountain
Just look in my eyes
Get wise to the rise
I'm an earthquake comin'
(Get wise to the rise)

Had a shotgun wedding
But I didn't show up
The thought of tyin' me down
Always makes me throw up

I'm a sinner, a winner, I'm fillin' my cup
'Cause I'm a pure grain drinker if my liver holds up
I'm on fire, a liar but that's okay
'Cause I'm livin' for today

Get wise to the rise
I'm the king of the mountain
Just look in my eyes
Get wise to the rise
I'm an earthquake comin'
Get wise to the rise

I'm a shooter, a looter, a runaway train
I got a love drug pusher to rattle my brain
Lots of women, to swim in 'cause that's rock 'n' roll
I'm the ace in your hole

Get wise to the rise
I'm the king of the mountain
Just look in my eyes
Get wise to the rise
I'm an earthquake comin'
Get wise to the rise, yeah
(Get wise to the rise)

Get wise to the rise
You better get it, baby yeah
You better get wise
'Cause I got your rise
Right here
