Memories
He was throwing grain to the ground below, ground below
With dreary circles of his arm, going slow, very slow
His cap pulled down roun' his ears to
Hide the smile and watery tears

My loving life is so wonderful
How small seeds gracefully to grow
Into beautiful things that spring from these rows
With their musical names and musical sound

Dreary birds parade across the dreary sky, down below
The woman absent mindedly begins to sow, how she sows the
Seeds her husband loved so much, but he's no longer
Here with us

But her life is so beautiful
As memories continue to grow
Into beautiful things that spring from these rows
With their musical names and musical sounds
Beautiful things that spring from these rows
With their musical names and musical sounds, and musical sounds

(Husband speaking)
Distant tho I am
Orange, gold, and green
Firing, flaming, colors surround me
(Wife)
I'm always wondering where you are?
I'm always wondering where you are?
(Husband)
Darling shouldn't I be the one
Wondering after all I am the one who is gone
(wife)
I'm always wondering where you are
I'm always wondering where you are
(husband)
Darling shouldn't I be the one
Wondering after all I am the one who is gone
(wife)
I'm always wondering
(husband)
I'm the one...who is gone
I'm the one...who is gone
Who is gone

But, there's beautiful things that spring from these rows
With their musical names, and musical sounds
There's beautiful things that spring from these rows
With their musical names, and musical sounds
And musical sounds
