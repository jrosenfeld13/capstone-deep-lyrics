If I should lose you, the stars would fall from the sky
If I should lose you, leaves would wither and die
The birds in May-time, they'd sing a mournful refrain
And I would wander around, hating the sound of rain

With you beside me, the rose would bloom in the snow
With you beside me, no winds of winter would blow
I gave you my love, and I was living a dream
But living would seem, in vain
If I
(Hating the rain, if I)
(All is in vain if I)
If I ever lost you
