I got a light in my head
Nobody sees it but you
I got a hearse in my bag
Nobody drives it but you

Nobody believes anything I say
I don't blame them
When they look at me that way

Got a light?
Got a light?
Turn around and you're dead

I got a ticket for your trolley
I'm looking for the lolly
It's a sad situation
A national distraction, inflation, elation

Pay no attention
Nobody believes when they look at us and say
We're gonna fight, gonna fight
Gonna fight for your lives

I thought it through
I think I'll spend the night
Got a light?
Got a light?

Got a light?
Got a light in my head
Nobody puts it out like you
I got a taste of a life
Nobody swallows quite like you
It's a case of distortion
Blown out of proportion
It's a natural condition to be drawn to science fiction

I thought it through
I think I'll spend the night
Got a light?
Got a light?
Got a light?

Got a light?
Got a light?
Got a light?
