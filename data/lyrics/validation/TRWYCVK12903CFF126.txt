I am an old bird
Careworn from flying
Caught in the down wind far from home
I used to fly
I was fire
Mine was the sky and the sun
Maybe I'm too far gone and my wings too beaten and torn
(now I'm lost and I'm tired)
'Cause I spin and I stall
But I hope if I fall
I am falling home
To you
I should be home now
Done with this wild sky
My only hope now is falling home
I'm falling home
I'm falling home
I'm falling home
I used to fly
I was fire
Mine was the sky and the sun
But I'm too far gone and my wings too beaten and torn
(now I'm lost and I'm tired)
'Cause I spin and I stall
And I hope if I fall
I am falling home
Falling home
To you
