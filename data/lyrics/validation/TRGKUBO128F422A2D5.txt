Something is crawling
In the back of my mind
I am feeling like I'm hovering
Coz nothing....nothing seems right
My world just stop turning
I'm loosing this fight
I decide to keep on yearning
Don't .....Don't let the Music die!!!!!
Dance Dance
I am full of devotion
Dance
Don't let the music die
Dance Dance
I am full of devotion
Dance
Don't let the music die
Dance Dance
Don't let it die, don't let it die...

Verse 2:
Let's get back to pleasure
Let's get in process tonite
Get your senses back together
When you think its right on time
You feel like you're burning
And that you need to survive
Come and decide to keep on yearning
Don't..... Don't let the Music die!!!!!

Rap-Part:
Come on, come on and show sum love
Sum Love from high above come on and turn me on ah ah
Come on, come on and show sum love
Sum Love from high above come on and turn me on - stand up
Dance Dance
I am full of devotion
Dance
Don't let the music die
Dance Dance
I am full of devotion
Dance
Don't let the music die
Dance Dance
Don't let it die, don't let it die...
