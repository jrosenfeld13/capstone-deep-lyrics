I should know by now
I should see some how
How to bring her round
How to breathe

I don't make a sound
Splinters hit the ground
Silence screams so loud
As see leaves

As the torch light shines
Through the heavy skies
Autumn waves her hand straight at me
See her world fall down
As the trees turn brown
As she drifts away and leaves

As the lights go down
She won't leave this town with me

There's more endless days
Heaven slips away
And I still see her face in broken dreams
Words are left too late
In our last embrace
Pushed until she breaks just like me

As the lights go down
She won't leave this town
She won't leave this town with me

Things I wish she'd say
Just to hear something
Left alone to a fate that we don't yet see
Then the moment fades
The sun turns to slate
Nothing stays the same
She will leave

As the lights go down
She won't leave this town
As the lights go down
She won't leave this town
As the lights go down
She won't leave this town with me
