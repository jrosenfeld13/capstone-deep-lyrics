Footsore this morning
At the break of day
Not the curtains won't part
Not the curtains won't part
He left his fingersprints
Dull trails upon a heart
Yeah weary come this morning
Slid on his black boots
Settled and stayed
Stettled and stayed
Envy come to live with me
He looked into my head
Spoke my conversations
Come to sleep with me in my bed
Trouble, oh he came this morning
Called out my name
And covered me with shame
Oh trouble oh trouble
Weary walkin' over me
Softly he won't tread
Broke into my centre
With his hard heart
Led me onto shelter
This shelter is my home
I borrow no light

I know no treasured sights
I see no-one
No-one sees me
Envy come to live with me, etc

I know you
I know you
I know trouble
I know trouble
Footsore come this morning, etc
Trouble come this morning
At the break of day
Now the company I'me keeping
Has change my name
