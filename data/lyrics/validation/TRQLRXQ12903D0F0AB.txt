You wind me up
Like a clockwork orange
Then you hide the key
To my destination
No satisfaction its all frustration
The times are changing
They're changing me
Open the cage
Let free the animals
Running wild
With hardened criminals
No satisfaction it's all frustrations
The times are changing when you're

13, 14: It's a teenage warning
15, 16: But nobody's listening
17, 18: Who takes the blame
19, 20: The twentieth century

Is my image right
For your fashion parade
If it don't look right
Your days are numbered

13, 14: It's a teenage warning
15, 16: But nobody's listening
17, 18: Who takes the blame
19, 20: The twentieth century
