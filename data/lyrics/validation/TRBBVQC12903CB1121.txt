Hey girl, I've got you
Yes, we all want to have
Part of the play

I am behind you
Falling over, crushing
Snow into green

This makes an ideal
Of the blindness before
The mirror you face

We're in the room now
If you look at me
I can't remember your face

Come, come, come give me eyes

Oh God, I'm

I'm drinking
I'm drinking
I'm drinking
From the silver tray

I'm drowning
I'm drowning
I'm drowning
In the liquid grey

Hey girl, I hear it
It's the ocean playing
The sun from the moon

Hey girl, I feel it
It makes me smaller, I steal
The look from your eyes

We're in the room still
Here in heaven's hell
Heaven's hell

And when you wake up
I'll be gone like
Some fly off the wall

Fly, fly, fly off the wall
The wall

Oh God, I'm

I'm drinking
I'm drinking
I'm drinking
From the silver tray

I'm drowning
I'm drowning
I'm drowning
In the liquid grey

That's how we play
That's how we play
