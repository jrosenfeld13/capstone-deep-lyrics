Now, the children of the future tried to come to terms
With the industrialised nations and their corporate firms
To decontaminate the planet and meet their demands
Detoxify the oceans, rivers, lakes and lands
Purify the air, get rid of nuclear waste
Put it on the a rocket ship and send it into space

Tone down, bone down, hone down, hatred!
'til love for the most highest creation is sacred
Rectify, recompense, re-evaluation;
Clarify, satisfy, the current situation
Spiritualize, realise, crystallise aspirations;
Recognise, stabilise, the unity of nations
Take all the bullshit and bury it with a shovel
Quit the lying, spying, alibi-in' daring the devil
But the parents of the future, like the ones in the past
Had an apocalyptic childhood and the die was cast
Those among their leaders were the children of the present
And some of them were devious and extremely unpleasant
Irradiated, mutated, DNA deranged
Sci-fi, sinister, slick and strange
In a megalo-manic, satanic, pseudo-scientific mode
At the pavilion of oblivion based on creed and code
The super secret, inclandestine, indiscreet elite
Saw their conquest of nature ending in defeat
They had dared to do what they shouldn't have done
And the planet overheated from the rays of the sun
You couldn't tell them nothing 'cos they didn't wanna hear it
And were oppressing all the people 'til they just couldn't bear it
And so the children of the future went underground
So deep down that they couldn't be found
Fleeing for their lives for all it was worth
They burrowed in their capsules 'til they reached the third earth

At the depth that was equal to the stratosphere
They met the underground dwellers who lived down there
These subterraneans were evolved and were aware of the facts
And gave the children shelter then covered their backs
They were illuminated, elevated, extrasensory heightened
Transcendental, mega-mental, fully enlighten
Into teleportation, levitation, meditation, cryptographics
Clairvoyance, telekinetics, astral travel, telepathics
Comprehensive comprehension, total memory retention
In every third eye seeing subterranean state of being
Within a multiple dimension, a gravitational suspension

Then they taught all the children 'bout the secrets of life
To gain inner peace instead of stress and strife
Meanwhile the mutated, fabricated, tyrants and such
Were trying to colonise space but it was mega too much
Their computers were deluders and androgynous clones
And had the planet subdivided into no-go zones
With their doomsday scenarios all coming to pass
They were holding out, in dread and doubt until the last
While the pursuit of the children had been in vain
With everything to lose and nothing to gain
Making war on the surface time and time again
Until the end was beginning from beginning to end

But the children of the future had learnt the arts
Immunity of mind, body, spirit and hearts
They kept on evolving 'til they the reached the stage
When the children of the future finally came of age
For death had taught them what life was worth
And had prepared them for the task of leaving planet earth
Then a starship came from deep within outer space
And took the children of the future to join the cosmic race
