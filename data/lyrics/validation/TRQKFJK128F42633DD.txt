Another ride - you got another place
He's the one - yeah, he's the mercy case
Another face - you're getting in the car
All the world for one stinking bar
You're a blank stare, a closed book, a red light
You're sugar torch

She's alone - just like when she came in
She was yours - she could be yours again
Close your eyes and she's all over you
No, you made it up - just like you always do
She's a black smear, a flat line, a pack of lies
She's sugar torch

You see your chance - you're slipping out the door
You burned him down - like he burned you before
The streets are wide - it's good to breathe the air
You've had enough - so why should you care
You're a blank stare, a closed book, a pack of lies
You're sugar torch
