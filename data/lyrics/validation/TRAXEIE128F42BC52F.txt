Waking skies at sunrise, every sunset, too
Seems to be bringing me memories of you
Here and there, everywhere, scenes that we once knew
And they all just recall, memories of you

How I wish I could forget those happy yesteryears
That have left a rosary of tears

Your face beams in my dreams
Spite of all I do
Everything seems to bring memories of you
