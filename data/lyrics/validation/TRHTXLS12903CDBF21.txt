Sooner or later more
These words to paper pour
Compose apologies
To bring you back to me

What words were written for
One girl whose pages tore
I'll bet you never knew
With a letter came a fool for you
She says she worked it out
This room's not big enough for two
He swears she'd work his words out
If she ever knew

How do I find her
Bearing my heart in hand
Last winter
Anne Arbour
Was all I had

I still wear your heart around my throat
I still wear your heart around my throat
With barely the air not to choke

Never, not ever again
Finally replaced every promise you've taken away
Now that it's over I'm older and colder this way
Finally replaced every promise you've taken away

How do I find her
Bearing my heart in my hand
Last winter
Anne Arbour
Was all I had
