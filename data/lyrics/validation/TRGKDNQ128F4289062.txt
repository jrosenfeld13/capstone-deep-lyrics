You better watch out, you better not cry
You better put out records D.I.Y
Cause it's not what you've done it's what you've been
If you fuck up, I'm telling Tim

Take you out of book your own life part six
You won't play again at ABC
You're gonna get ostracized like Lawrence
When I tell Tim, I'm telling Tim
I'm telling Tim, I'm telling Tim
