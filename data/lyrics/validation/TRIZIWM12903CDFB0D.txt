Your jugular arteries ripped
Viscous juices gush and bleed
You're gutted, skinned and mangled
Enteral disorder is freed
Your rib-cage wrenched and torn
Still-pumping heart is crushed and smashed
Your alimentary canal is finely chopped
Lumpen meat is hacked

Disembowel, chop and trash

Veins are stripped and flayed
Of haemorrhage, bile and sweat
Savoured cuts are cured
Bodily parts are wrecked
Bissection of the twitching corpse
Copious blood is drained
Captive-bolt and pole-axe
Shred, trash and maim

Dismember, carve and hack

I rip open pectoral cavities to devour my still-steaming grub
Drinking adeps and effluence, smearing myself in congealing blood
I tear at sauted crackling to guzzle on fetid swag
Butchered remains are carved and collected in a doggy-bag

I mince up your limbs, off-cuts and cartilege
Stuffing freshly-drawn intestine with grated coronary arteries
I slice from your mutilated trunk runny fats and rind
Skewering eye-orbits, brain, genitals and organs I grind

Bins of torrid offal where writhing stomachs squirm
Chunks amongst your thighs and rump, crawling with tape-worm
Snapped spinal column is gnawed, curdled trypsin turns into cheese
Your vena cava lashed, on your pericardial sac I feed

I gourge myself on your loin, erepsin and brine consumed
Blubbering escharic tegument, steaming remains turn into grume

Cranial fluids sucked
Flooded organs crushed
You are totally wasted

Your dissected shell collapses, as I eat congested insides
Desregarded entrails fume and rot, now host to hungry flies

Cranial fluids sucked
Flooded organs crushed
You are totally wasted

Slow bissection makes me laugh
