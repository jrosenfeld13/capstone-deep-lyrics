I'm being held captive
Something's got a hold of me
Stay until death splits us up
And calls for a judge to ask if you believe

You've lost your soul for eternity
But you've never been free
When it's said and done
We can run, it's our eternity

But for now, I've been trapped
Too long to take these roads
Tell me when you see the smoke
Hear my cry and bring me back to home

Arrested by your love, girl
Constant search from the floor
Badly beaten in love, girl
Turn the key and lock the door

Arrested by your love, girl
Constant search from the floor
Badly beaten in love, girl
Turn the key and lock the door

I'll send an SOS
Through a telegraphic note
Expressed in shreds
Written in code, signed to a note

'Cause nobody should know
What it's like to be alone
So take back your soul
A lot to uphold, a lie to be told
'Cause love's not set in stone

But for now, I've been trapped, oh
Too long to take these roads
Tell me when you see the smoke
Hear my cry and bring me back to home

Arrested by your love, girl
Constant search from the floor
Badly beaten in love, girl
Turn the key and lock the door

Arrested by your love, girl
Constant search from the floor
Badly beaten in love, girl
Turn the key and lock the door

Come as you are, my darling
Bare bones so I can see your soul
I'm beginning to lose control
I need to know who's starting
To crumble down my nervous walls
Had to stumble for far too long

Come as you are, come as you are
I'm beginning to lose control
I need to know, I need to know
You're beginning to lose control

Arrested by your love, girl
Constant search from the floor
Barely beaten in love, girl
Turn the key and lock the door

Arrested by your love, girl
Constant search from the floor
Barely beaten in love, girl
Turn the key and lock the door

Come as you are, come as you are
I'm beginning to lose control
I need to know, I need to know
You're beginning to lose control
