Ooh, ooh
It might seem strange that a girl like me, would go crazy
Over a simple guy like you, calling me baby
I'm too high, everybody knows, I'm walking a real-time hope

I know I know, the wind will blow, the sky may shake but your arms will hold
When I'm on your mind, I'm on cloud nine
The way I feel, without a tear, I'm floating, light, in your atmosphere
When I'm on your mind, I'm on cloud nine

Twenty-four hours in a night and day, should be plenty, for me to chase your thoughts my way, and you can catch me
I'm too high, everybody knows, I look at you and I'm in control

I know I know, the wind will blow, the sky may shake but your arms will hold
When I'm on your mind, I'm on cloud nine
The way I feel, without a tear, I'm floating, light, in your atmosphere
When I'm on your mind, I'm on cloud nine

I'm too high, everybody knows, I'm walking a real-time hope

I know I know, the wind will blow, the sky may shake but your arms will hold
When I'm on your mind, I'm on cloud nine
The way I feel, without a tear, I'm floating, light, in your atmosphere
When I'm on your mind, I'm on cloud nine
I'm on cloud nine, I'm on cloud nine...
