Animal nuzzles up to my shoulder
Sweats and grunts and pushes me over
With its musty mane in my eyes
I'm closed off and protected
Inside sleep together
Sleep within sleep
It's everywhere
I'm safe, safe with the head of the animal
Breathe on my breath
There's nothing else
Gone world, gone
When he wakes in all our red rooms
Next to pillows that scream "alone"
And we're shaking uncompleted
Aching for this creeping sleep
On which to ride away
Sleep is the animal whose name is safety
Whose name is angel's wings
Whose name is never will it happen to me
Whose arms are the longest the world will ever see
Whose voice is Jesus saying "innocence is the child"
Whose breath is warmth and the scent of safety and the taste of purity
Animal flies me in a hollow in it's belly
Until the world's gone
Inside a world inside a world inside a world without end
