It's not like it used to be, ancient history
Why are we throwing those stones
Cold sweat and blistering, sounds like a plea to me
Don't lose that glow in your eyes, save your breath and be still
Save your breath and be still

No other traumas have weighed quite this dark
There's still light but you can't force the tides
You won't know if you're coming in light 'til your ship has arrived

Relish this moment, 'til death do us part
I want answers before it's too late
Take your time old man, take your time
Take your time old man, take your time
These vultures are happy to wait

Savor the sympathy, one final victory ???
Bring me an axe to grind, look it's not hard to find
Skeletons under your bed, save your breath and be still
Save your breath and be still

No other traumas have weighed quite this dark
There's still light but you can't force the tides
You won't know if you're coming in light til your ship has arrived

Relish this moment, 'til death do us part
I want answers before it's too late
Take your time old man
These vultures are happy to wait

I'd like to forgive and forget, but I can't
It's just one of the ways that I'm petty
I'll leave you to carry this weight, to burden the rest of your days
I'll leave you to carry this weight, all alone
And no single regret to the grave

It's not like it used to be, ancient history
Why are we throwing those stones
Cold sweat and blistering, sounds like a plea to me
Don't lose that glow in your eyes, save your breath and be still
Save your breath and be still

No other traumas have weighed quite this dark
There's still light but you can't force the tides
You won't know if you're coming in light 'til your ship has arrived

Relish this moment, 'til death do us part
I want answers before it's too late
Take your time old man
These vultures are happy to wait
