Forty years the wilderness held my sad children
Promises of lands that flow with milk and honey
Hold me Jordan. Hold me Jordan

The builders of the wall, the temple fell
The sun the moon stood still circled by
The twelve stones of Jordan, Hold me Jordan

Tomorrow you will walk on water
Twelve stones, twelve stones of Jordan
Tomorrow you will take me down to the river
Oh twelve stones, twelve stones of Jordan

Divided were the waters at the feet of the priests
Did you see me Joshua, standing in the Jordan
See the open wounds flowing from your hands
Flowing from your feet
Hold me Jordan

Tomorrow you will walk on water
Oh twelve stones, twelve stones of Jordan
Tomorrow you will take me down to the river
Oh twelve stones, twelve stones of Jordan

Are you hungry my sad children
Are you thirsty run to the river
And are you angry my sad children
Take the twelve stones, twelve stones of Jordan
