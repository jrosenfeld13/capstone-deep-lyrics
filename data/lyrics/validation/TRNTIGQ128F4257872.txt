[Verse 1]
Get a load of me
Get a load of you
Walking down the street
And I hardly know you
It's just like we were meant to be

Holding hands with you
When we're out at night
Got a girlfriend
You say it isn't right
And I've got someone waiting too

[Pre-Chorus]
What if this is just the beginning
We're already wet
And we're gonna go swimming

[Chorus]
Why can't I breathe
Whenever I think about you
Why can't I speak
Whenever I talk about you

It's inevitable
It's a fact that we're gonna get down to it
So tell me
Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you

Whenever I think about you...

[Verse 2]
Isn't this the best part of breaking up
Finding someone else
You can't get enough of
Someone who wants to be with you too

It's an itch we know
We are gonna scratch
Gonna take a while
For this egg to hatch
But wouldn't it be beautiful

[Pre-Chorus]
Here we go
We're at the beginning
We haven't fucked yet
But my head's spinning

[Chorus]
Why can't I breathe
Whenever I think about you
Why can't I speak
Whenever I talk about you

It's inevitable
It's a fact that we're gonna get down to it
So tell me
Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you

[Bridge]
High enough for you to make me wonder
Where it's going
High enough for you to pull me under

Somethin's growing
Out of this that we can control
Baby I am dying

Why can't I breathe
Whenever I think about you
Why can't I speak
Whenever I talk about you

[Chorus]
Why can't I breathe
Whenever I think about you
Why can't I speak
Whenever I talk about you

It's inevitable
It's a fact that we're gonna get down to it
So tell me
Why can't I breathe whenever I think about you

Whenever I think about you?
Whenever I think about you?
Whenever I think about you?
