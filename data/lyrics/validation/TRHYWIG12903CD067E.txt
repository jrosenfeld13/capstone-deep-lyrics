[Verse: 1]
Baby
I really want to talk to you
Oh Darling
And baby what am I supposed to do?
To fall away from me
You know I think about you everyday
[?]

[Chorus]
Don't stop baby
[?]
Let's keep it long distance
[?]
[?]
[?]
I want it baby I want it
You can give it to me, long distance

[Verse: 2]
Now lady, how we gonna make it through?
