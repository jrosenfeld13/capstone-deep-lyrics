[Verse1]
Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died
From a stray bullet
Woman hold her head and cry
Explaining to her was a passerby
Who saw the woman cry

[Pre-Chorus]
Wondering how can she work it out
Now she knows that the wages of sin is death
The gift of Jah is life
She cried

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, all-la I know
Johnny was a good man
Ah-la I know
Johnny was a good, good, good, good man
She cried, She cried

[Verse 2]
Woman hold her head and cry
As her son had been shot down in the street and died
Just because of the system
Woman hold her head and cry
Comforting her I was passing by
She complained, then she cried

[Chorus]
Whoa-oh, oh, ah
Yeah, I know now
(Johnny was a good man)
Said I know
(Never did a thing wrong)
Ah ah
(Johnny was a good man)
Can a woman tender care?
She cried
(Never did a thing wrong)
Cease towards the child she bear
(Johnny was a good man)
Oh, woman cried
Woman, she cried, oh, she cried, yeah
Can a woman tender care
Cease towards the child she bears

Take it down

Johnny went out on a Saturday night
Never hurt anybody never started no bar room fight
Johnny never did nobody no wrong
Never hurt anybody never hurt anybody
Johnny was a good man
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny...

Johnny was a good man
Johnny was a good man

In a top floor flat in the middle of the night
There's a man with rifle and Johnny in his sight
I said oh no, we can't let that kind of thing happen here no more
Oh no
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny...

A single shot rings out in a Belfast night and I said oh
Johnny was a good man

Can a woman tender care?
She still wants the child she bears

Johnny
Johnny
