Not this time, Not this time
Not this time, Not this time
Not this time, Not this time
Not this time, Not this time

You told me that my love was all good for you
But when I'm not around there's always someone new

With all my trust
And every little kiss
I can't believe you played me out
Like this
All my friends told me
I was not your only
Guess my heart was wrong again

How could I be with someone like you
After all of the things that you put me through
And how could you lie looking straight in my eye
Sorry baby not this time

Not this time, Not this time
Not this time, Not this time

The other night when I was out with my friends
And we were chilling at the club when you walked in
Said you were staying home
Here you coming not alone
Tell me what the... Is going on
Baby what goes around
Always comes back around
Shall be the one to bring you down

How could I be with someone like you (someone like you)
After all of the things that you put me through (put me through)
And how could you lie looking straight in my eye (straight in my eye)
Sorry baby not this time

Here I am all alone
Wondering where it all go wrong
Guess my love was not enough
For you to stay true

Rap:
Can't believe you did me wrong
I should've known, so now I'm gone
After all the things I did for you
And all the thing you put me through
Telling me you wanna stay with me
When all along you was playing me
But all the games are gonna stop this time
It worked before, but not this time

With all my trust
And every little kiss
I can't believe you played me out

How could I be with someone like you (someone like you)
After all of the things that you put me through (put me through)
And how could you lie looking straight in my eye (how could you lie)
Sorry baby not this time

How could I be with someone like you
After all of the things that you put me through (yeah they told me)
And how could you lie looking straight in my eye (straight in my eye)
Sorry baby not (yeah, yeah) this time

How could I be with someone like you
After all of the things that you put me through (put me through)
And how could you lie looking straight in my eye (straight in my eye)
Sorry baby not this time
