Jealousy told me you were fooling around
Changed into hate when you turned me down
Can't get her out of my head, no no
Never again a girl like that I will find
Baby please, give me peace of mind

Fearless, yes, babies' cries
Witch trial, witch trial
Burning flames
Pumping veins, yeah
There's no rest to be found
Cure of soul ain't enough
Seperated by centuries, reincarnated love

They made you admit things you've never done
The jeers from the crowd went on and on and on
This morbid plot I regret, yeah yeah
She was unfaithful to me
A long gone love lost in time for eternity
