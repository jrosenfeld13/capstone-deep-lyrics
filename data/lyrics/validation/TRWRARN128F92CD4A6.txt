Oh as I sit under this weeping willow tree
Pain and sorrow is all that I feel
Deep inside of me its burning out of control
That same sensation You started in my soul
So, Peace and love in the ghetto
Peace and love in the ghetto, now
Peace and love in the ghetto
Peace and love in the ghetto now
Oh as I sit under this weeping willow tree
Pain and Sorrow is all around me
Woe as I wipe these tears from my eyes
Oh yeah, I realize that Our lives should be free

(Chorus)
Oh as I sit under this weeping willow tree
Never been enchanting the vines of the concrete
Oh as I wipe these tears from my eyes, Oh father
I realize that our lives should be free

(Chorus)
Like a bird in a tree
(Peace and love in the ghetto now)
Mm, Yeah
I'm holding one tired eye
(Peace and love in the ghetto now)
Steady, Its Free now
Oh love, love...love for everyone
