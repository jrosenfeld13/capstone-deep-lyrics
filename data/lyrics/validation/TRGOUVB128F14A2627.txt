Well, I'm married to a devil woman
I'm married to a devil gal
Do me wrong devil woman
Do me wrong devil gal
Well, one more time believe me, baby
One more time and you go away
Do me wrong
One more time and you go away
Well I love her sweet and I love her simple
Our love is off every day
Love is soft and lovin' her tender
Then she does be this way
Every day I day a little, every night I wild away
Do me wrong devil woman
One more time and you go away
[music]
Well the more and more I love you baby
More and more you this way
Do me wrong
One more time and you go away
Well, one more time believe me, baby
One more time you runnin' play
Do me wrong devil woman
One more time and you go away
Well I love her sweet and I love her simple
Our love is off every day
Love is soft and lovin' her tender
Then she does be this way
Every day I day a little, every night I wild away
Do me wrong devil woman
One more time and you go away
[music]
Well the more and more I love you baby
More and more you this way
Do me wrong devil woman
One more time and you go away
