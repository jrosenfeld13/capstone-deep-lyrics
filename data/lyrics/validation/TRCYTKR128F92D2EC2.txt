All dolled up in your glad rags
But tomorrow may turn to sad rags
And they call you Glad Rag Doll
I know that you're admired
I know that you're desired
But only by the fellows who soon grow tired
My poor little Glad Rag Doll
You're just a pretty little toy
The boys like to play with
You're not the kind that they choose
To grow old and gray with
Now don't you make this, this the end dear
It's never too late to make amends dear
My poor little Glad Rag Doll
You're just a pretty little toy
The boys like to play with
You're not the kind they have on their mind
You're just a toy for them today
So listen to the things I say
Now don't you make this, this the end dear
It's never too late to make amends dear
My poor little Glad Rag Doll
