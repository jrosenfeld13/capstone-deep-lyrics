A careless leper
Too comfortable
In his own world
To notice the the older wounds
Have new infections
With new intentions
Darkness settled in behind me
Tapped me on the shoulder singing
Shivers to my spine
From the corners of my mind
"i've been wanting to remind you
Of everything you've left behind
And wouldn't you, shouldn't you
Remember me
Should you forget, i haven't yet
Remember when we...
Almost stepped right off
Between the two heavens
One above
And one below
One last flight
All stars and city lights
One last goodbye
One last goodbye..."
She's there when i'm alone
And she always seems to know
The stories that'll take me
Back to where my comforts sleep
A caress with velvet paws
That hide her sharpened claws
Along the walls that time has built high
Searching for the blemishes
And i know she's breathing murder
That it is folly to endure her
But there is sweetness in her whisper
"when you've had enough, i'll be waiting
Wouldn't you, shouldn't you
Remember me
Should you forget, i haven't yet
You know that we can always
Step right off
Between the two heavens
One above
And one below
One last flight
All stars and city lights
One last goodbye
One last goodbye..."
I've never known a life without her
At every turn she's there
Her comfort i despise
But there's a coward in me, fearing any
Changes for the trial
Hopeless is a hideaway
Familiar escape
I've never known a life without her
At every turn, she's there
Yesterday's a siren
Singing memories so inviting
Sometimes reaping takes a lifetime
But i'm pushing on, with living life
Renewed in mind, i say goodbye
To yesterday, the siren
Singing memories so inviting
Sometimes reaping takes a lifetime
But i'm pushing on, with the mind of Christ
I say goodbye
And watch her die
