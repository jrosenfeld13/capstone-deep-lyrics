Louie, Louie, oh no, me gotta go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, baby
Louie, Louie, oh baby, me gotta go

A fine little girl, she waits for me
Me catch the ship across the sea
Me sailed the ship all alone
Me never think I'll make it home

Louie, Louie, oh no, me gotta go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, baby
Louie, Louie, oh baby, me gotta go

Three nights and days I sailed the sea
Me think of girl constantly
On the ship, I dream she there
I smell the rose in her hair

Louie, Louie, oh no, me gotta go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, baby
Louie, Louie, oh baby, me gotta go
Okay, let's give it to 'em right now

Me see

Me see Jamaica, the moon above
It won't be long me see me love
Me take her in my arms and then
I tell her I'll never leave again

Louie, Louie, oh no, me gotta go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, baby
Louie, Louie, oh baby, me gotta go
I said we gotta go now

Let's step on out of here
Let's go
