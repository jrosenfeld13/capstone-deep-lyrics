SEND ME YOUR MESSAGE, IF YOU CAN
AND BRAKE THE SILENCE, IF YOU CAN
AND I WILL KNOW THAT YOU EXIST
AND YOU WILL KNOW NOW WHAT I'VE MISSED
AND MAYBE I'LL GET KICK FOR MY EMOTIONAL LIFE

ANOTHER WARNING, ANOTHER HAZE
ANOTHER TRY TO GET AWAY

LET'S LEAVE THIS FALLACIOUS WORLD
LET'S LEAVE THIS FALLACIOUS WORLD
LET'S LEAVE THIS FALLACIOUS WORLD
LET'S LEAVE THIS WORLD

THE LONGER WE COMPLAIN ABOUT OUR SORROWS
THE MORE SLOWER SEEMS THE TIME TILL TOMORROW
I'M AFRAID NEXT TIME IT COULD BE TO LATE
THIS NOCTURNAL STEPPING STONE WON'T COME AGAIN
SO DON'T RETHINK, LET'S MOVE THROUGH THE GATE
DON'T RETHINK, LET'S GET AWAY !

LET'S LEAVE THIS FALLACIOUS WORLD
LET'S LEAVE THIS FALLACIOUS WORLD
LET'S LEAVE THIS FALLACIOUS WORLD
LET'S LEAVE

GET AWAY, LET'S GET AWAY !
LET'S LEAVE THIS FALLACIOUS WORLD
LET'S LEAVE THIS FALLACIOUS WORLD
LET'S LEAVE THIS FALLACIOUS WORLD
LET'S LEAVE THIS FALLACIOUS WORLD
THIS FALLACIOUS WORLD
LET'S LEAVE TONIGHT
LET'S LEAVE TONIGHT
TONIGHT, TONIGHT, TONIGHT
