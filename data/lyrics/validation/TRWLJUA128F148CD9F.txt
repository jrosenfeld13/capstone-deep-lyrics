Sugar, I call my baby my sugar
I never maybe my sugar
That sugar baby of mine
He's special ration
Funny, he never asks for my money
All I give him is honey
And that he can spend anytime

I'd make a million trips to lips
It I were a bee
Because he's sweeter than chocolate candy to me
He's confectionary

Sugar, I never cheat on my Sugar
Cause I'm too sweet on my Sugar
That sugar baby of mine
