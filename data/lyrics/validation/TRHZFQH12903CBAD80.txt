Feel the moment
The sky has open
Horizon is endless
Live again

The edge of light
Draws me near
Inside your wisdom
Inside your fear
Let it go
Release the pain
Live again

Come close to me
Don't be afraid
I will take the pain away
Forever will I stay
Alone you are not
Alone you will never be
I am here to protect you
To help set you free
