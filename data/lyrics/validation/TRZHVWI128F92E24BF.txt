Someone came out of the blue
And they said "I'm gonna be representing you"
Oh my, can you tell me why?

Well I said I didn't need anybody
But they came on strong
What i say they just carried on and on

Won't somebody tell me
'Cos I don't underatand
'Bout paying these legal fees
When I'm an innocent man

I guess these people need me
More than I need them
I feel like I have been condemned

I've been a good man
I ain't never done no wrong
Oh not I, I just roll along

Well I'm an innocent man
Can you hear my plea
Can you tell me
I have to pay all these legal fees

How long Lord oh how long
As far as I can see
It's never gonna end
Don't let them take it all
Just leave me some money to spend

Someone came out of the blue
Said "I'm gonna be representing you"
Oh my, can you tell me why?
