Jack was born towards the end of the 19th century
He married his sweetheart at the age of 23
Shortly before the birth of their first child
He answered the call of duty

He carried English bayonets in an English way
He smoked German cigarettes on Christmas Day
He never made it past 25, he died at Passchendaele
Fighting for the cause in the war to end all wars

His son fell from a Spitfire in 1944
Well Daddy, what did you do in the Great War?
And what did we learn the second time round?
Never again
Never again

He carried English bayonets, in an English way
He smoked German cigarettes on Christmas Day
He never made it past 25, he died at Passchendaele
Fighting for the cause in the war to end all wars

(Just keep on fighting, still we keep on fighting)
(Just keep on fighting, still we keep on fighting)
(Just keep on fighting, still we keep on fighting)

He carried English bayonets, in an English way
He smoked German cigarettes on Christmas Day
He never made it past 25, he died at Passchendaele
Fighting for the cause in the war to end all wars
