Free space
Secondhand free space
Kick the grand plan
Steal the free space
There's no fear when the meaning is clear

Underachievers
Attack at your leisure
Hoist up your guitars
And make them all believers

Free space
Secondhand free space

Of total frustration

Underachievers
Attack at your leisure
Hoist yourself
For intercontinental seizure

Underachievers
Total domination
Kick a billion years
Of total frustration
