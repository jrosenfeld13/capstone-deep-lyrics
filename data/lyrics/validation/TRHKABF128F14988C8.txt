Mmm, hmm

The night we met
I often remember
Two strangers meeting for the very first time
Now here we are
Facing each other
Two lovers holding on to something real

Something so meaningful
If you wanna know how I feel

I feel good
(I feel good)
Baby, I feel good all over
(Baby, I feel good all over)
You and I have what others dream about
We've finally worked it out

Say no more
Your expression shows it
I see a little sunshine inside of you
Just to be with you is so exciting
Who would have thought it could to me, mmm

It's no secret we're in love
Even a little child can see

I feel good
(I feel good)
Baby, I feel good all over
(Baby, I feel good all over)
You and I have what others dream about

You know I've been many places
I've seen lots of faces
Thought I knew just about everything
Everything there is to know

Yet you never
(Never)
Cease to amaze me
(Cease to amaze me)
The main reason I live is because

You make me feel good
(I feel good)
Baby, I feel good all over
(Baby, I feel good all over)
When I think about all the good things you do

You do to me, baby
(I feel good)
Oh, oh
(I feel good)

Baby, I feel good all, all, all over
(Baby, I feel good all over)
The way you hold me and smile my way
(I feel good)
Oh...
(I feel good)

I...
I feel good
You make me, make me feel so, feel so good
(Baby, I feel good all over)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I feel so good
Oh, oh, yeah

I feel good
(I feel good)
Can't you see I feel good all over?
(Can't you see I feel good all over?)
I wanna let you know
(Wanna let you know)
Yeah
(From head to toe)

I love you so, yeah
(I love you so)
(I feel good)
Yes, I do
(I feel good)

Oh, baby
Oh, honey
Oh, sugar, I feel good all over?
(Can't you see I feel good all over?)
Sweet
(Sweet things you say to me)
Oh, yeah
(Whoa, oh, oh, I love this, love this)

I feel good
(I feel good)
Oh, baby
I feel good all over
(Can't you see I feel good all over?)
You and I
We have what others dream about
We've finally worked it out
