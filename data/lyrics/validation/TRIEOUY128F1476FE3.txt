Did you ever see
Two Yankees
Part up on
A foreign shore
When the good ship's
Just about to start
To old
New York once more

With tear
Dimmed eye
They say goodbye
Their friends
With out a doubt
When the man
On the pier shouts
Let them clear
As the ship
Strikes out

Give my regards
To Broadway
Remember me
To Herald Square
Tell all the gang
At Forty Second Street
That I will soon
Be there

Whisper of how
I'm yearning to mingle
With
The old time throng
Give my regards
To old Broadway
And say
That I'll be
There 'ere
