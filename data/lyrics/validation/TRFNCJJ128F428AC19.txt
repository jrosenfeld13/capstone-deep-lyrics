[Verse 1]
Girl, tonight we're gonna make love
You know how I know?
Because it's Wednesday
And Wednesday night is the night
That we usually make love
Monday night is my night to cook
Tuesday night we go and visit your mother
But Wednesday we make sweet, weekly love
It's when everything is just right
There's nothing good on TV
You haven't had your after-work
Social sports team practice
So you're not too tired, oh boy...it's all on
You lean in and whisper something sexy in my ear like
"I might go to bed now, I've got work in the morning"
I know what you're trying to say, girl
You're trying to say oh, yeah, it's business time
It's business time."

[Hook]
It's business, it's business time
I know what you're trying to say
You're trying to say it's time for business
It's business time, ooh!
It's business, it's business time
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah!

[Verse 2]
Then we're in the bathroom, brushing our teeth
That's all part of the foreplay...I love foreplay
A-chicka-chicka, a-chicka-chicka, a-chicka-chickow-ow-oww!
Then you sort out the recycling
That isn't part of the foreplay process
But it is still very important
Next thing you know, we're in the bedroom
You're wearing that baggy old ugly t-shirt
You got from your work several years ago
Mmm, you know the one, baby
With the curry stain, oww!
I remove my clothes very, very clumsily
Tripping sensuously over my pants
Now I'm naked, except for my socks
And you know when I'm down to just my socks
What time it is...ooh!

[Hook]
It's business, it's business time
You know when I'm down to my socks it's time for business
That's why they call it business socks, ooh
It's business, it's business time
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah!

[Bridge]
Ah, makin' love...makin' love for...
Makin' love for two...makin' love for two minutes

[Verse 3]
When it's with me, girl
You only need two minutes
Because I'm so intense
You whisper something sexy like, "Is that it?"
I know what you're trying to say, girl
You're trying to say, "Aww yeah, that's it"
Then you tell me you want some more
Well uh, I'm not surprised, but I'm quite sleepy

[Hook]
It's business, it's business time
Business hours are over, baby
It's business, it's business time
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah-yeah, yeah!
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah-yeah!
