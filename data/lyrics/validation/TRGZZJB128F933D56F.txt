[Verse 1]
Please don't forget me
I'm going away
I'm taking a taxi to Kentucky
Where they don't need to know all about me
I just need to feel safe
I've got a thousand sweaters and shoes and paintings to hide
The skeletons in my bed
Don't ask where I'm going

[Chorus]
I'm going away
I'm going my way
Finally it's my time
To be lonely, and lost, unloved and I can't wait
Don't forget what I said
Don't forget my letter
Every night I pray for you
I don't got no religion
Isn't that something?
I'll miss those days

[Verse 2]
I saved that bottle
It's now ten years aged
I've got some bibles I could sell for money
And a pair of fresh shaved legs
Won't you baby come with me?
I've got extra space
In my car, in my heart, in my mind
Look there's the passenger seat
By the postcards you gave (Don't know where I'm going)

[Chorus]
I'm going away
I'm going my way
Finally it's my time
To be lonely, and lost, unloved and I can't wait
Don't forget what I said
Don't forget my letter
Every night I pray for you
I don't got no religion
Isn't that something?
I'll miss those days

[Bridge]
But he said, "Slow down, slow down
Think it over, we've all got wretched closets
But silly girl pride kills more than aids lately."
I said, "Come on
I've thought it over
I don't want to die here
I've no desire to get married"

I can't race the others anymore
No, I must learn to race myself

I'm going away
I'm going my way
Finally it's my time
To be lonely, and lost, unloved and I can't wait
Please forget what I said (I'll find my way)
Please forget my letter
Every night I pray for you
I don't got a religion
Isn't that something?
I'll miss those days

I, I'm not going halfway (I'll find my way)
I, I
Every night I pray for you
Don't believe in heaven
Or that it could be a happy place
I, I'm going away
