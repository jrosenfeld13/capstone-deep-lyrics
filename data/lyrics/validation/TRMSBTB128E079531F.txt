My potions addictive

You shoulda love me now
You don't wanna miss me when im gone
But till im gone its on
Hustle stong, nothing long
If you wanna come and touch this son dey ru on clan de floor and flowin' on
Ayo want you free the feeling

And a stree with meaning
Yo, i dont believe im boastin if i say i can achieve before i see the notion

(chorus)
Ay girl!

In times of excess we have to know are limitation
Some boy say das good buts its a lie
A woulda have believe it but dey can't fool de eye

Got to get the dough you know to stay fly
Tell me a why a da a boy wanna try
When i always lost it with the pocket carbine, dats ill
