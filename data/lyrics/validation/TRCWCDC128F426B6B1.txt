Shes got lips that taste like wine
I like hers, she likes mine
What a perfect combination!
No wonder were in love
When she sits upon my knee
I take this, so does she
What a perfect combination
No wonder were in love
She taught me one thing
Love is only what you make it
And I know one thing
She can dish it out and I can take it
We both want a family
I want twins and so does she
What a perfect combination
No wonder were in love
I just fell hook, line and sinker
Sweetest gal in town
Im all bound up with a brand new love affair
I cant tell which way Im going
The world is upside down
I know that Im gone the panic is on
I like bread, she likes Yam
I like eggs, she likes ham
What a perfect combination
No wonder were in love
Can she cook?
Can she sew?
She can sew and sew and sew
What a perfect combination
No wonder were in love
Once she liked crooning
Used to go for Rudy Valle
We started spooning
Now her radio is in the alley
Ill never rest until shes mine
When shes mine Ill never rest
What a perfect combination
No wonder were in love
She taught me one thing
Love is only what you make it
And I know one thing
She can dish it out and I can take it
We both want a family
I want twins and so does she
What a perfect combination
No wonder were in love
