I don't know where I'm going
Don't know where I've been
'Cause I haven't seen my baby
Since I don't know when

I'm walking down that long road
With a smile up on my face
I'm broken hearted
But you won't see a trace

Feeling disconnected
These blues are out to kill
Sweep them in the corner
Put 'em in the bin

All right so you don't sympathise
Don't expect that you should
Walk right for one day you might
Run into this patch of grey clouds too

All right so you don't sympathise
I don't expect that you should
Stay bright for one day you might
Run into this patch of grey clouds too

Gravel in my pockets
From the places I have been
The soles of my shoes are paper thin

I got sand here in my pockets
From the place that I come from
That's where I'm going
So I'll say so long...yeah
