Well there's nothing I can do
If you leave me here to cry
Well there's nothing I can do
If you leave me here to cry
You know my love will follow you
As the years go passing by

I gave you all that I own
That's one thing you can't deny
Yes, I gave you all that I own
That's one thing you can't deny
Yeah my love will follow you
As the years go passing by

I'm gonna leave it up to you
So long, so long good bye
Yes, I'm gonna leave it up to you
So long, yeah so long good bye
You know my love will follow you
As the years go passing by
