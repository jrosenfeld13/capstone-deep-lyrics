[Chorus]
When you said, "it's a touch too much", I knew, I knew
That I'd be walking home again

[Verse 1]
I lift my head and it falls again
I take a step and I fall, I never asked for much
Watch my hand in a shaking love
And it is always thus I never asked for much

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
If I said enough's enough you'd know
I'd call on your brother, he would show
It'd be on his face, I would not stare
But beyond our best attempts we'd care

[Verse 3]
It was a really long time ago when you were a friend of mine
And I would really like you to know, it would help to ease my mind
I would hold you up again if you ask me

[Chorus]
