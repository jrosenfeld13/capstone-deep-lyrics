Too much makeup for a Sunday
Virginia Wilson, you oughta be ashamed
Somewhere in the second verse of Have Thine Own Way
She left an empty pew
She said I think that's what I'll do

Now she's singing hallelujah on a Saturday night
She's stepping out looking for the other life
Press on nails and a run in her hose
Goin downtown, down she goes
She don't care if it's a big mistake
She needs a whole lot more than Amazing Grace
She's running from that Southern Baptist Hearbreak

She must be easy, that's what they say
Her skirt's too short for the PTA (huh)
Good girls don't smoke and when they kneel they pray
She had enough of that come-on, back-stabbing, back-sliding love

Now she's singing hallelujah on a Saturday night
She's stepping out looking for the other life
Press on nails and a run in her hose
Goin downtown, down she goes
She don't care if it's a big mistake
She needs a whole lot more than Amazing Grace
She's running from that Southern Baptist Hearbreak

Sweet Virginia, where have you gone
Everybody misses you
Cause there's no one left to catch the stones

Singing hallelujah on a Saturday night
Stepping out, looking for the other life
Press on nails and a run in her hose
Goin downtown, down she goes
She don't care if it's a big mistake
She needs a whole lot more than Amazing Grace
She's running from that Southern Baptist
Passes on that peace that passes
And livin out a Southern Baptist Heartbreak
