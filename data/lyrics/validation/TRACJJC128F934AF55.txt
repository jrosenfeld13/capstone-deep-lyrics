Deathless sin
Led to the place of atonement
Repent through pain
Slicing off proof of guilt

Immortal lust
Blood craving torturers revel
Pain through penance
You will plead for your scourge

Burnt with iron
Retinas scorched
Eyes are blind
Purge the mind

Enter the chambers of blood
Slave to the cruelty inside
Die in the chambers of blood
Cleansed of the sins of your life...bleeding

Walls are stained with blood of vice
Learn through scourge
The errors of depravity

Immortal curse
Inquisitors for eternity
Scourging to learn
The stamina of the condemned

Disembowel
Torn apart
Heaving lungs
Severed tongues

Never to speak evil, never again
This is the way it must be
Burnt at the stake or
Stretched on the rack
Burning your soul
Draw out your guilt

Pieces torn off
Pieces that sinned
Tumors that must be destroyed
Chop off a cock or carve out a cunt
Cleansing your soul, bleed to atone

Enter the chambers of blood
Slave to the cruelty inside
Die in the chambers of blood
Cleansed of the sins of your life

Bleed on it's infernal walls
Nailed to the prison you made
Scraps of flesh litter the halls
Torture the price has been paid
