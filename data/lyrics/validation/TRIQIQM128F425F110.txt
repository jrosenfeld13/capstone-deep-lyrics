Barely survived
The last goodbye
It hurt so bad
Thought I would die
So I built a wall
And built it high
Around this broken heart of mine

No one has ever wanted in as bad as you
There's only one thing left for me to do

It's time to tear the wall down
Let it crumble to the ground
Cause it's true love
I have found
It's time to tear the wall down
Yes it is

Oh memory
Stacked up like stone
It kept you out
For way too long
So come on in
Where you belong
And turn this house
Into a home

If you wanna love me as bad as you say
I can't let nothin' stand in your way

It's time to tear the wall down
Let it crumble to the ground
Cause it's true love
I have found
It's time to tear the wall down
Yes it is

No one has ever wanted in as bad as you
There's only one thing left for me to do

It's time to tear the wall down
Let it crumble to the ground
Cause it's true love
I have found
It's time to tear the wall down

It's time to tear the wall down
Then let it crumble to the ground
Cause it's true love
I have found
It's time to tear the wall down

It's time to tear the wall down
Yes it is
So long
