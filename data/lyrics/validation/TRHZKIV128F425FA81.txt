(Sharon Anderson/Kristian Bergsnes/Bob Moulds)

I caught you glancing in a pawn shop window
You caught me looking there too
Just a little quarter-carat diamond
But it was sparkling true
I could see you were a little uneasy
You said: "We're running late."
And later on, parked over in my driveway
Said: "Boy, you're gonna have to wait

"If you really wanna be my baby
"I really want you to be mine, all mine
"If you wanna talk about forever
"That's what's on my mind
"Give me a ring sometime."

I always love the little things you give me
Gentle roses and sweet perfume
I was thrilled the first time you kissed me
But just a little too soon
Where I come from, love stands for something
And it's worth the wait
Baby, I'm a little old-fashioned
But maybe that's okay

If you really wanna be my baby
I really want you to be mine, all mine
If you wanna talk about forever
That's what's on my mind
Give me a ring sometime

Don't keep my heart on the line

If you really wanna be my baby
I really want you to be mine, all mine
If you wanna talk about forever
That's what's on my mind
Give me a ring sometime
Give me a ring sometime
Give me a ring sometime
