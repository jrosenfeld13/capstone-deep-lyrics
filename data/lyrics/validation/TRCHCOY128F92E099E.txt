[Verse 1]
That old pair of jeans
You always see me wearing when it's grey
You know what I mean
I'm riding a lazy mood

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause you've been waiting got me ready to go
And I've been straying off the way that I know, keep me
Wise enough, nothing to owe
Guess I need ya and I want it to show

[Chorus]
Lying here in my sanctuary
Days go past it's autumn already
And I wish it would thunder
Lying here in my sanctuary
Days go past it's autumn already
And I sit here and wonder

[Verse 2]
And I'll kick off my shoes
Think about the things I'd like to do
Everything going smooth
There ain't nothing I'd rather do

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
What I say and what I mean, are two very different things
Can't tell life from lies got a bad sense of spins
What I say and what I mean are two very different things
Babe, it's time to figure it out
Holding my hands in your hand and I won't let go
Keeping your words and your face is a place like home
I've been blind don't you know
