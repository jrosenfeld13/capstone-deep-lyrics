Avenues and dirty arches you run down the street and i will follow
Try try sliding through the network of a crowded paradise
My tears are indivisible
Underneath overexposure like a shellshocked distant past
Ride ride sifting through the remains surfing on a concrete tide
My tears are indivisible
Animals in pretty cages you have watched them wear their ugliest faces
Cry cry saline droplets splashing in the boat that saved your life
My tears are indivisible
When we fall we're always sorry
But it makes us glad to know it's only temporary
