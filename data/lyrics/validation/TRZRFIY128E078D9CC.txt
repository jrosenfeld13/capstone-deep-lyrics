Hair-raising sheik
You're much too late
You've been the temper who's fixing a cause
The peak of the day
It's waiting for your packed up slave

Come right away
And help me bear this single day
These fifty feelings in my head
Have come to leave what we have had

I'm on my way
The sizes we take
They have been given to give us a call
You know that we claim
Four million pictures that we saved

Come right away
And help me bear this single day
These fifty feelings in my head
They've come to leave what we have had
Improve this fever, errate the scared
I'm leaving though you're in my head

Come right away
And help me bear this single day
These fifty feelings in my head
They've come to leave what we have had
Improve this fever, errate the scared
I'm leaving though you're in my head
