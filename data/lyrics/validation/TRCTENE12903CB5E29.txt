You dont write back when you promise to
The moon has overdosed on night-time like me on you
I got bars of your punk rock running through my veins
I got symphonies and science but no way to explain
How you broke my life in two different worlds
You move quicker than the lightning illuminates a girl
Got cigarettes you smoke burned into my veins
I got sympathy and silence but no way to explain
This almighty love
Sometimes it seems enough but baby baby its all wrong
This almighty love cant deny it when it comes but baby baby its all wrong

I saw a movie in your eyes a long goodbye
I wont find a toxic angel like you a second time
You come down all at once like your Vancouver rain
I got sympathy and silence but no way to explain
This almighty love
But baby baby its all wrong
Just like this song
Its here for a minute or two then it disappears just like you
