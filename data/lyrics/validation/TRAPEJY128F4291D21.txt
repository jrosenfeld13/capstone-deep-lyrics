The noise pumping through your insides
Makes you wanna scream in pain
Visions get incomprehensible
You loose the touch with your brain

As the blood runs thick and warm
You're melting down inside
The music's hammering never ends
Realization si denied

You can't run you can't hide
Not this time
You're trapped in my game
Filled with pain
I'm to blame

Now I've got you on your knees in front of me
You're so little you never were shit and you'll never be

You can't run you can't hide
Not this time
You're trapped in my game
Filled with pain
I'm to blame
You're mine until the music stops
Your temperature raises your body drops
And now you'll never forget me

Now I've got you on your knees in front of me
You're so little you never were shit and you'll never be
