[Verse 1]
In the black and white, your wounds all bound
Sitting at the table, biting nails all short
To the consequence of adultery
As he rips you from your skin
We're all paying for this and in your prayers
You believe, you believe

[Chorus]
You believe, you believe (just for the first time)
You believe, you believe (just like the last time)
You believe, you believe (a seam away from breaking)
You believe, you believe (always forever)

[Verse 2]
Tasting you for the first time, just to breathe you in
Breaking you for the first time, bathed in sin
Bathed in sin

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
The embers will burn you
The embers will burn you
(Will burn you)
Will burn you, will burn you tonight
(Will burn you)
Will burn you, will burn you tonight

Moments forever faded, will burn you tonight (x4)
