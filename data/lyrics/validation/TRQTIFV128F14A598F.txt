So this is how it feels to be happy, to find real true love
To be wanted, to be real
We throw away the rest of the past, every small broken thing
We find new things that will last

And everything's the same but my name
And I have everything I wanted
For a change I'm not ashamed
And I have everything I wanted

It's another gorgeous day in Miami, I am missing you
Can you hear me, are you real
Never home for long we are passing in our dreams at night
But we send signals we can feel

And everything's the same but my name
And I have everything I wanted
For a change, I'm not ashamed
And I have everything I wanted

We make do, we get by
We don't know how or why
We lose track, were we happy?
Would we take anything back? If we could
Would we try?

And every single day I am grateful, I hold my heart in my hands
And I love you, this is real

'Cause everything's the same but my name
And I have everything I wanted
For a change I'm not ashamed
And I have everything I wanted

Not to blame, not ashamed, everything I wanted
