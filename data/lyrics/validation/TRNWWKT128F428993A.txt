[Verse One: Baje One]
Baje taking notes on the way that people get rich
Check list then see which is the best fit
Utilize your tools, implement the strategies
Motivate your clientele with simple sets of batteries
I know it had to be a tad bit Pavlovian
But amongst the tadpoles, frogs is draconian
When your only friend forced like Obi-Wan
And you holding palms out flat like you know me son
But it's not that way, it's the other one
Where you getting popped in the face like Bubble Yum
When it comes to handing checks out
I would rather be a X-File than manufacture textiles
Need the next style or feeling stressed out?
You could find a solution sitting in the next aisle
And while you're there you should spend, spend, spend
Maybe sin, sin, sin
That's a book I never read like Rin Tin Tin
So I wouldn't know the mathematics
The way some of you lie is straight acrobatics
And the fact of the matter of the fact is
You could fill in the blanks with truth like Mad Libs
This is Snaf-ish, and if you ask me
Reality's a floor model, you take it as is
But that's me and heretofore I ain't made a lot of cash
So what the duck do I know?
Pointing at a pie chart like shut your pie hole
He don't see dough unless he's touching filo
Making baklava but stocks he got nada
Gotta watch for the first cold press like kalamata
I use some of that oil to slick my hair back
Slide door to door selling dreams as bare facts
What's the basis?
The shortest distance between two points is by stepping on faces
A simple dance - two-step or a do-si-do
Next thing you know you're synergizing backward overflow
And it all happens right here in the naked city
Now go ahead and grab your pasties come on shake them...

[Verse Two: Cool Calm Pete]
Set in his ways, stubborn and stuck
Couldn't get him to budge for like a million bucks
But money talks and we all listen
The finer things in life you've been missing
Offshore account, bowtie and tux
Your wifey is classy fly as (fuck)
Your mistress is dipped cause you buy her stuff
Your little round glasses - Scrooge McDuck
Ascot, sometimes a top hat
Walking a dog the size of a rat
Your black ties, shaking hands with rich guys
Laughing it up, passing the buck
Yo making bacon is painstaking work
Raking in the dough, boy, stay getting perks
The penthouse suites, luxury seats
Room with a view eating delicious treats
No fat pockets, just black cards
Shooting for the stars, rockets in cars
James Bond without the danger
Just like the new Bill Gates, helping strangers
They used to say more money more problems
Christmas in Aspen or some private island
Wildin' in my yacht off the plank
White pants, tennis with Carlton Banks
Ducks in a row, can't stop the flow
Living fast eating escargot
You're popping bubbly in my gold plated tub
Upper class citizen smoking "rosebud"
Your hungry eyes shaped like dollar signs
Your diamond rings, white collar crimes
In tough times, it ain't about luck
You ain't (shit) without a million bucks
Reading Dianetics, cryogenics
Chilling like Disney, cabbage, lettuce
Mile high business class, sky writing
A million and one, catch the excitement
