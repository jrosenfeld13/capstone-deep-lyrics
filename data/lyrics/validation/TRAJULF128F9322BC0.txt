Want to just see how cheap we can go
Flash in my eyes
Say i am to love you
I can disappear right before
Demons dig me down
Magic black dreams
I would never reach your signs
Lovers die
They open up fire
I assume it's something you need
Flash in my eyes whenever we go

All since i decode you
I'm feeling lower than low
The fire i breathe in burns me from the inside out
I will never return to the city of dead angels town

Now i'm lower than low....
Lower than low

I saw the guns and knives open hearts and throats
Kindly bleeding
You can never beat the worm inside
On your own
Well get me out of the zone of needing more
More forgiving
I assumed it's something you need
A flash in my eyes lower than low

All since i decode you
I'm feeling lower than low
The fire i breathe in burns me from the inside out
I will never return to the city of dead angels town

The moment saw the beast in your eyes
Damage is done
How can you force me now
Such a sweet lonely whore you'll push me down
Then turn me on
You can even live and die forever
Too wasted for you now
How can you wish to be
On my side on my side

All since i decode you
I'm feeling lower than low
The fire i breathe in burns me from the inside out
I will never return to the city of dead angels town

Now i'm lower than low.... lower than low
Now i'm lower than low.... lower than low
