Ask me why I came so late
Ask me why I made you wait
What's the story?
Well, you ought to know
I had a little fight
I was dancing at a go-go
I'll tell you anything
Baby, except the truth

I'll tell you anything
Baby, except the truth
I've got nothing
But everything to prove

I never smile when I tell a lie
I swear the only one tonight

Ask me if I can be true
Ask me where I'm going to
I say I love you
But you ought to know
I only love the night
And I always gotts to go-go
I'll tell you anything
Baby, except the truth
