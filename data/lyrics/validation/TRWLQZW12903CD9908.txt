You're a beautiful trace
Of time and space
You're a thing that once shone
And you still shine bright
In the darkest night
Though you're already gone
You have travelled so far
My terminal star
In your coat so red
But I still don't know how
I can watch a thing now
When it's already dead
When it's already dead

Just to reach my eyes
You traverse the skies
For a hundred million years
I behold your power
In this waukrife hour
Just before it disappears
All the stories in stones
And in beakers and bones
All the salt in the sea
Are eclipsed by the might
Of your fading light
You're dying so beautifully
So beautifully (so beautifully)
So beautifully
So beautifully

You're a beautiful trace
Of time and space
You're a thing that once shone
And you still shine bright
In the darkest night
Though you're already gone
Though you're already gone
Though you're already gone
