I watched the sun roll down in Texas
Out on the edge of town in Texas
I keep on hanging round in Texas
Waiting for my lucky day

Lost everything I had in Texas
A million dreams went by in Texas
Sometimes the same life turns against us
But I'm waiting for my lucky day

I watch the sun go down, I keep hanging on
Waiting for the wind to change
I watch the sun go down and I keep hanging on
I know it's coming up again

The friends I had are all gone in Texas
Sometimes you stand alone in Texas
Just when it all goes wrong in Texas
I'm waiting for my lucky day

I watch the sun go down, I keep hanging on
Waiting for the wind to change
I watch the sun go down and I keep hanging on
Waiting for my lucky day
Waiting for my lucky day
Waiting for my lucky day
