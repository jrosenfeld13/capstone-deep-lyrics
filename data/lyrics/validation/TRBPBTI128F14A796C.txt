Don't improve me
With your cool manners
I don't want your money
I want your body
Don't cry, don't wish
Don't talk, please no tears
I feel no pity
No sorrow at all
Don't be afraid
Let's forget
Aprs le jour
C'est la nuit
Aprs la nuit
C'est le jour

Touch me, touch me
Please touch me
Touch me, touch me
Please touch me

Taste my spittle
Smell my body
Feed me
Undress me

Touch me, touch me
Please touch me
Touch me, touch me
Please touch me

Touch me, touch me
Please touch me
Touch me, touch me
Please touch me

I'm not the one
To worry about
Everybody's got something
To hide
Let's create something to replace
But but but isn't there

Touch me, touch me
Please touch me
Touch me, touch me
Please touch me

Touch me, touch me
O Please touch me
Touch me, touch me
Please touch me

Touch me, touch me
Please touch me
Touch me, touch me
Please touch me
