Your world, not mine
Your world, not ours
Your world, not mine
Your world not ours

I will resist with every inch and every breath
I will resist this psychic death
I will resist with every inch and every breath
I will resist this psychic death

There's more than two ways of thinking
There's more than one way of knowing
There's more than two ways of being
There's more than one way of going somewhere

Silence inside of me silence inside
Silence inside of me silence inside
Silence inside of me silence inside
Silence inside of me silence inside

I will resist with every inch and every breath
I will resist this psychic death
