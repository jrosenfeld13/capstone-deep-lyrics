Doo do do doo
Do do do doo
Doo do do doo
Do do do doo

We met at a dance
Walked hand and hand
Into the night in this wonderland
I know, now I know that's the creation of love

We kissed once or twice
That's when our hearts
Danced into to the night
I know, now I know that's the creation of love

Someday we'll walk down the isle
And we'll be wearing a smile
Some people will sing and your mother will cry
As we say I do until the day we die

I love you and you love me
Think how happy we will be
I know, now I know that's the creation of love
I know, now I know that's the creation of love
