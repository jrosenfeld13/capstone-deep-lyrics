We've got to straighten out the deal
It's time to give me something real
You better put your toys away
You know that I'm not here to play
Something's strange is in your eye
I don't know what you're seeing in your mind
Today, I've got to know, why you've been stalking, stalling all the time
Is it true or do you lie? I don't know who you've been seeing on the sly
Today, I've got to know, who you've been calling, calling. Did you sly?
You've got to put it on the line
Not just a nickel or a dime
You better hear the words I say
You know that I'm not here to play
Something's strange is in your eye
I don't know what you're seeing in your mind
Today, I've got to know, why you've been stalking, stalling all the time
Is it true or do you lie? I don't know who you've been seeing on the sly
Today, I've got to know, who you've been calling, calling. Did you sly?
