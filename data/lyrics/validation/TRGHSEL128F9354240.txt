Film your little sister with some dirt on her face
Read a Maya Deren book and shoot a staircase
Gather urgent footage for the introduction
Mess around with framing during post-production

Life with a tripod in Manchester beckoned
Panning the high street at twelve frames a second
Film a cloud on Super-8
Thread it through and check the gate

As data fills a perspex spool
My sequences will outsell Tool
So load me in and let me reign
'Cause I was born to entertain
