[Intro: Lady Sovereign]
Yeah, is this mic on? Right
Ahem  little shhh for the MC please (thank you)

[Verse 1: Lady Sovereign]
Yo, I ain'tfeatherweight nor bantamweight
Cause the only thing I be isheavyweight
Let me demonstrate, lyrically decorate
Check out the vibe, um, that I create
You want me to stop  well, it's too late
Want me to flop? Haha  never mate
Never hesitate to drop the mic 
I neverhesitate to do what I like
Never hesitate to pick up a fight
At the things right challenging my vibe
"Continue?" Yes, I'm sure
Get off my lyric and get a big roar
Will leave you sore like a beat up whore
All eyes them after a ten pound draw
Fighting lyrics was against the law
Be lame right now when the girl's so flawed
Eating bread and water
My living went out to slaughter
With an order:
Have you come to a decision?
"Yes, she's going to" (oh shit!)
Don't send me there
The beef for my living just to get you; know what?
Don't really care: write what I like
So you better prepare
Oh, yeah, be aware

[Hook: Lady Sovereign]
Yo, a little bit of "Shhh" for me
A little bit of quiet for the MC
A little bit of "Shhh" for me:
Make way for the S. O. V
A little bit of "Shhh" for me
Now shut your mouth for the MC
A little bit hush for me
Right now: it's the S. O. V

[Interlude: Lady Sovereign]
Right, haha
Don't joke with us small folk

[Verse 2: Lady Sovereign]
Yo, I've had one nightstand
What you think of mic stands?
Right now, how it sounds: I got very hard hands (oww)
An acoustic band on hand, all the time
All my fans, I'm in trouble (uh-oh)
That sound pollution man got down
Well, I make up noise like pots and pans
They should put my voice in an ice cream van
That way the streets won't be bland
Big-headed? No. Confident? Yes
I must confess  well, I'm never gonna rest
Well, unless, I don't want to mess
Here comes the press!!
Another damn reporter
Obsessed with my disorder
Diagnosis, please? What's wrong with that girl?
"She's ill!"
Naw, she's sick

[Hook]

[Interlude: Lady Sovereign]
Oh my God!! Pianos!! Ahhh!!

[Verse 3: Lady Sovereign]
(haha) BRRRRRRRR!!
It's cold: there's a new top gyal on road
Running t'ing, running t'ing, running t'ing  everything: oh, you've been told
I requested Shhh and, well, I got it
So, let me carry on this; you sit back and vomit
Some say I'm cheeky like Wallace and Gromit
You know, you can't stop it
Some don't like me
Like the whole Miss Spears and Madonna story:
I'm horny
Just keep writing; surely, you could ignore me
But, then again, if you saw me, you'll adore me (aww!)
Cause I'm so cute and scrawny
Spit on a track and leave it so horny (hmm)
And who taught me? Nobody
I did it all by myself: you can't stop me!

[Hook]

[Interlude: Lady Sovereign]
It's O. K., it's alright. You  you can start making some noise now, if you like; you know what I mean, right? I'm not going to go completely off the rail, you know what I mean? Ha, thank you. Hey! {whistle} Alright, calm down, please. Alright now, a little bit of shhh
