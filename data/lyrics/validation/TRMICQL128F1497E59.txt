Trickled down
To the valley below
Heart of snow
Let go let go
But your sad wings
Won't fly you home
No more

Hellfire
You're wrong
Our hopes have held high
Hellfire
You're wrong
Our hopes will not die
But your proud wings
Won't carry you home

Trickled down
To the valley below
Heart of snow
Let go let go
But your sad wings
Won't fly you home
No more

Lay down your guitars
And buck up superstars
And hush now all you kids
