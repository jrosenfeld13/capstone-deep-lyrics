[Verse 1]
There he goes, gone again
Same old story's gotta come to an end
Lovin' him was a one way street
But I'm gettin' off where the crossroads meet

[Verse 2]
A quarter moon in a ten cent town
It's time for me to lay my heartaches down
Saturday night I wanna make myself a name
Take a month of Sundays to try and explain

[Chorus 1]
It's gonna be easy to fill
The heart of a thirsty woman
And harder to kill the ghost of a no good man
And I'll be ridin' high in a fandangled sky
It's gonna be easy, it's gonna be easy from now on

[Verse 3]
Raw as a whit but clean as a bone
Soft to the touch when you take me home
When the mornin' comes and it's time for me to leave
Don't worry 'bout me, I got a wild card up my sleeve

[Chorus 2]
It's gonna be easy to fill
The heart of a thirsty woman
And harder to kill the ghost of a no good man
And I'll be ridin' high in a fandangled sky
It's gonna be easy, it's gonna be easy
It's gonna be easy from now on

From now on
It's gonna be easy
It's gonna be easy
It's gonna be easy
Easy
Easy
