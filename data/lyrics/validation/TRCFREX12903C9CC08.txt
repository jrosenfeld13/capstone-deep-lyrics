Whether the weather keeps
Blowing the same
I've already been swept away
Since you got tangled in my hair
Can i keep you there
Or will you be my sweater
And weather the weather with me
I would wear you every day
In the sun or in the shade
Whether rain or shine
Will you be mine
If i'm under the weather
Will you be mine
If i'm light as a feather
Will you be mine
Let's be together and
Weather the weather
