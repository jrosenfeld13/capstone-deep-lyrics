Please, kill me in my sleep so I get stuck in my dreams
I'll keep exhaling the rime of my chaotic harmony
But the wrecked parts of that ship keep floating in
So, I see this time was never made for me

Never wanted you to know
What was inside of me
And all the things I ever wanted
Was things I had before

Making my way to heaven
Through a thousand miles of hell
And your absence bought me time
To break from my mind

Every time I slept with you, I made sure that
There was no ice pick hidden in the sheets of the bed
But my feelings for you are wearing out
It's the strife; still, you're the sundown of my life

Never wanted you to know
What was inside of me
And all the things I ever wanted
Was things I had before

Making my way to heaven
Through a thousand miles of hell
And your absence bought me time
To break from my mind

Everything is lost
Everything is gone
The shadow from the past
Is watching over me
Consuming me

Making my way to heaven
Through a thousand miles of hell
And your absence bought me time
To break from my mind

Making my way to heaven
Through a thousand miles of hell
And your absence bought me time
To break from my mind
