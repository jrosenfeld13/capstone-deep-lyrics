[Chorus]
I wonder if you know how they live in Tokyo ()
If you see me, then you mean it, then you know you have to go

You should see me in the parking lot (ah)

Fights with wings and shiny things
And lions, tigers, bears, oh, my ride

Supersonic like J. J. Fad, and we ride till the wheels are flat
Can't beat that with a baseball bat (uh, [whirr])

[Verse 8: Verbal]
It's gotta be the shoes, it's gotta be the furs
That's why ladies choose me
All up in the news, 'cause we're so cute
That's why we're so huge
Harajuku girls know how I 
They respect, I keeps it 
Not a China-man 'cause I ain't from China, man
I am Japan-man

[Interlude]

 (don't worry about it, let's go)

I wonder if you know how they live in Tokyo ()
If you see me, then you mean it, then you know you have to go
