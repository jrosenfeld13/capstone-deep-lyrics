One man carrying the weight of it all
Digging deep across his shoulders
Sell his burden to the devil below
Buys a life before he gets much older
Toasting freedom, drinking joy
Like a man with a reason to live
Feeling re-born
Feeling

Absolutely wonderful
Absolutely everything
Absolutely nothing
And absolution sometimes

One man walking on a cloud in the sky
High on a new way of beeing
Burning his candles with a flame at both ends
Just to see the past he's fleeing

Don't turn around and pay your pound of a flesh back
When your future is done
Just keep dancing
Feeling

Absolutely wonderful
Absolutely everything
Absolutely nothing
And absolution sometimes

Absolutely wonderful
Absolutely everything
Absolutely nothing
And absolution sometimes

And absolution sometimes
And absolution sometimes
And absolution sometimes
