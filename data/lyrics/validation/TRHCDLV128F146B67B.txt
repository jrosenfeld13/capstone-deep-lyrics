We're falling faster, this is the last year
Just a few more hours until we are all alone
This never happens, changing with fashion
Just a few more hours until we are unknown

I wish I could have known you better
I should blame it on the weather
This was over from the start
Does it even matter?
Our situations getting worse

Sleep in, sleep well
With this life we are set to fail

[Chorus]
I just wanted you to know
I think about you every night when I fall asleep
You are in my dreams
Just like in a movie
The one you want to see with a happy ending

This dead letter, written on black paper
It never found her eyes
Instead of love, she only saw dollar signs

Sleep in, and sleep well
With this life we are set to fail

[Chorus]

With this life we are set to fail

[Chorus]
