Jealousy is my evil twin, he looks like me and I look like him, I see
His face in the mirror as the day begins, needles and pins. Envy is
My middle name as long as I've got someone else to blame for all
My problems, it's such a shame, ain't it a shame? Well I sat around
And thought about how it used to be, you and me, you and me, but
I couldn't think of a goddamned thing to say about you and me, you
And me. Anger is my closest friend he's always been my means to
An end, my unjust cause he'll defend upon my friend anger I can
Depend because everything I see tends to make me angry
Everything I see tends to make me angry, and everything I see turns
My rage to jealousy, and everything I see turns my rage to jealousy
Well jealousy is my evil twin he looks like me and I look like him I see
His face in the mirror as the day begins, needles and pins, needles
And pins, because now he's talking to my girlfriend, now he's talking
To my girlfriend, so now I'm gonna have to kick his face in, now I'm
Gonna have to kick his face in, for all his sins, for all his sins, for all
His sins, for all my sins, my evil twin, my evil twin, my evil twin, my
Evil twin is me
