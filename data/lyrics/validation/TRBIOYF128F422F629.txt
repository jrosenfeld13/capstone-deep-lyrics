We have reviewed your yellow form
Congratulations, we find you qualified
You have just the right capacity
For putting up with our nonsense

There's just one thing you've got to prove
We know how you must be dishonest and lazy
If you're so desperate
You actually want to work at this place

You must be guilty, lie detector
Guilty, lie detector
Guilty, lie detector
Guilty 'til you're proven innocent these days

Blood pressure clamps around your arms
Now don't get nervous when we yell in your face
We know you steal, just who do you screw?
With what, with who, aren't you a Christian?

The polygraph, don't make it move
One little twitch, the anvil drops on you
Don't matter if you told the truth
We want your facial egg for our file

You must be guilty, lie detector
Guilty, lie detector
Guilty, lie detector
Guilty 'til you're proven innocent these days

Guilty 'til proven innocent
Guilty, it says so on your face
Guilty when you try to find
A place to live or a job that pays

Guilty when you file a complaint
Against the cop that kicked your face last night
Guilty, it says so on page three
Guilty, who'd think a guy like me

Would plant drugs in your car?
Break in your house while you're asleep
Open your mouth, bet your ass you're watched
And it's your word against ours

Yeah, just because we're hiring you
That don't mean we trust you at all
You'll have to take a test like this
Once or twice every week

We know machines, they make mistakes
And it's your word against our dead black box
The machine is always right
'Cause we know how it makes you feel so small

You must be guilty, lie detector
Guilty, lie detector
Guilty, lie detector
Guilty 'til you're proven innocent

You must be guilty, lie detector
Guilty, lie detector
Guilty, lie detector
Guilty 'til you're proven innocent these days

Guilty 'til you're proven innocent these days
'Cause when you're innocent
When you're innocent
When you're innocent it just don't pay
