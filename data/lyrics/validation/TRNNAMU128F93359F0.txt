Well, I've been hurt but I still love you
I've been hurt like this before, oh, yeah

You're not teaching me a new thing
Try to realise and call me when you're ready
Whenever you're ready

I know you laugh but I still love you
And though I've cried like this before

You're not teaching me a new thing
Try to realise and call me when you're ready
Whenever you're ready

But if you call me
You've got to treat me in a different way
And if you call me
You've got to listen, girl, to what I tell you

And never hurt me, 'cause I love you
Never hurt me like before, oh, yeah

You're not teaching me a new thing
Try to realise and call me when you're ready
Whenever you're ready

You're not teaching me a new thing
Try to realise and call me when you're ready
Whenever you're ready

All you gotta do is call, call me, call me
You know
Call me, call me, call me
Call me

Call me
