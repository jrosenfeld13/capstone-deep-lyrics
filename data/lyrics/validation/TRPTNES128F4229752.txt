I'm an gasoline man
I dunno where i go
I'm gonna drive and drive
I wanna get there on time

I'm an gasoline man
That's the way i feel
I wanna take my hand
And put it on the wheel

I'm an gasoline man
Gonna set your world on fire
I'm gonna drive and drive
Find out where you hide

Say an little prayer for the mother
Gasoline baby
Say an little prayer for the mother
Let's go for an ride

I'm an gasoline man
I dunno where i go
I'm gonna drive and drive
Find out where you hide

Thank you light
You told me how to bend
Thank you wolf
You told me how to bite

Say an little prayer for the mother
Say an little prayer for the mother baby
Say an little prayer for the mother (x2)

Let's go
Said the gasoline man
Yeah i'm the gasoline man
Cos i'm the gasoline man
