You are bright light and animated
A demolition color scheme
Mismatched and complicated
Who put the hex on Mr. X?

Living in a big top dimension
You're the stalker of the mini-world
Trapped in wonderland suspension
Transmission from the micronaut girl

Where are you now?
And we'd like to think
You've found your own way home
On your own
Where's Gerrold now?

You're a visual illusion
Like Christmas
A trendsetter for the colorblind
A think-fast solution - no way out
Washed away with the crimson tide

Where are you now?
And we'd like to think
You've found your own way home
On your own
Where's Gerrold now?
And we'd like to think
You've found your own way home
On your own

Transglobal spectacle
With post-mortem fame
Popsicle cannibal
Can you hear me?

Transglobal spectacle
With post-mortem fame
Popsicle cannibal
Can you hear me?

Rainbow dementia smiles
Everyone smiles
The small realities
A pixie playland

Can you find yourself
With bright lights flashing
Cover my eyes
I'm feeling sick, I'm getting paranoid

Find yourself
With bright lights flashing
With bright lights flashing

I'm feeling paranoid
