[Verse 1]
The lights are on, but you're not home
Your mind is not your own
Your heart sweats, your body shakes
Another kiss is what it takes

You can't sleep, you can't eat
There's no doubt, you're in deep
Your throat is tight, you can't breathe
Another kiss is all you need

[Chorus]
Whoa, you like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
You know you're going to have to face it, you're addicted to love

[Verse 2]
You see the signs, but you can't read
You're running at a different speed
Your heart beats in double time
Another kiss and you'll be mine

A one-track mind, you can't be saved
Oblivion is all you crave
If there's some left for you
You don't mind if you do

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love [x5]
Your lights are on, but you're not home
Your will is not your own
Your heart sweats your teeth grind
Another kiss and you'll be mine

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love [x8]
