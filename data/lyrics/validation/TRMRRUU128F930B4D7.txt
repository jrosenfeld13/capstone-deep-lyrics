Spending time
In not so obvious places
Where no one would search for me
A little dose
Of ambivalence in attitude
As to the trends of the places
I should be
Please don't leave me
Don't tell me there's not time for me
Cause I used to be your best friend
Taking a trip down a road I've been before
These crazies want to change their personalities
For things that I deplore
The rationale of your average trendsetter's pretty hip
But the rationale of those who follow for the crowd's
Just s**t
