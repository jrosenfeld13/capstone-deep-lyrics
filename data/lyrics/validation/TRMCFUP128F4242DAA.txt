If you have a problem with your love affair huh

There's problems with this love affair
Problems and I can't get nowhere
So woman you know if it was down to me yeah
We would be together if it was down to me
But the true circumstance is I am with another
But she don't seem to understand why
My mind just keeps on drifting back to you girl

[Chorus]
Though folks may say certain things certain ways
I know my heart will always stay
Forever by your side, our love will never hide
Our love will never hide

Painful heart and now I'm grievin'
With lots of lovin' deep within, alright
And now you feel what I am feelin'
Tell me how it's gonna end, alright

So woman you know most times I wish that I
Could be forever by your side and ever incomin' tide, oh
I know I'm glad you came, oh baby
True love is not a game, oh honey
But you and I shouldn't have to live apart
Though honey, I just don't know for sure

[Chorus]
Painful heart and now I'm grievin'
With lots of lovin' deep within, alright
And now you feel what I am feelin'
Tell me how it's gonna end, alright

Problems with this love affair
Problems and I can't get nowhere
Problems with this love affair
Problems, I still can't go nowhere hey hey yeah

If you have a problem with your love affair
If you have a problem with your love affair
If you have a problem with your love affair
