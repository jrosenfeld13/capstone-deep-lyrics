Time was when i could forget about feelings
Time was when i should have stopped all my breathing
Give me the day when my hope evaporates
I'd change my name anyway

You and i
Open wide
Why don't we go home?
Too much time wondering why
Shouldn't we go home?

I'd never feel that my time was so precious
If i could forget
All i'd learnt from your lessons
Two contradictions can make me uncentred
I need a balance too

You and i
Open wide
Why don't we go home?
Too much time wondering why
Shouldn't we go home?
