If you give up too easily and follow every whim
Lose your mind before it could even begin
Missing link, it might be what you got, so won't you give it a shot?
So you do it all the same and you do it all again
You wake up in the morning and you ain't got a friend
Your boss is coming down on you and you can't pay the rent and then
Back into trouble again

Missing link has got you beaten, battered, bruised
If you had a problem, now it's two
Missing link he took you down a notch, so won't you give it a shot
You're always under pressure
It's harder to be sane when
You wake up and you realize that every day is the same
You can't go back to work and now you know just who to blame ain't it a shame
Back into trouble again

Missing link, I know you tried to cut him loose
But missing link is still a part of you
Think you lost him, but it ain't exactly showing
Got you by the neck and now there ain't no way of knowing
Pretend you got a will but you know just where it's going

Missing link has got you standing on the brink
Left the world to rot and to stink
Left the world, you pick up the pieces of the puzzle
And now you get lot of work done but you don't get a cent
You wake up in the morning and do it all again
Your landlord's coming down on you and and you can't pay the rent and then
Back into trouble again
