Went through three winters, three summers
Thinking that you're gonna return
My friends said it over and over
"Gotta stop holding on to her"
I went through fire and rain
Every moment I thought you called
There was nothing to gain
How did I get the blame for it all

Feels like I could never let you go
'Cause it just intensifies the pain
I wish there was a way to let you know
That being without you is not the same

So I'm not giving up on love
You know our history
Girl, we were meant to be
Why should I give you up, my love
It was you and me
Now I'm left with nothing

Do you remember the flowers I sent
They don't grow in September, you know
You said you didn't feel love
You know better girl, but that was the story you told
You said that you tried and you tried
You kept telling that lie to yourself
What you feel you can't hide
You won't find it in nobody else

Feels like I could never let you go
'Cause it just intensifies my pain
I wish there was a way to let you know
Being without you is not the same

So I'm not giving up on love
You know our history
Girl, we were meant to be
Why should I give you up, my love
It was you and me
Now I'm left with nothing

So I'm not giving up on love
You know our history
Girl, we were meant to be
Why should I give you up, my love
It was you and me
Now I'm left with nothing

Giving up on love
You know our history
Girl, we were meant to be
Why should I give you up, my love
It was you and me
Now I'm left with nothing

(Giving up, up, up, up, up, up, up
