Come disconnect the dots with me, poppet
Come disconnect the dots
Come disconnect the dots with me, poppet
Come disconnect the dots

It's so beautiful
Our lunacy
It's so beautiful

Come disconnect the dots with me, poppet
Come disconnect the dots
Come disconnect the dots with me, poppet
Come disconnect the dots

It's so beautiful
Our lunacy
It's so beautiful
Ahh

[Bridge]

Come disconnect the dots with me, poppet
Come disconnect the dots
Come disconnect the dots with me, poppet
Come disconnect the dots

It's so beautiful
Our lunacy
It's so beautiful, ah

It's so beautiful
Our lunacy
It's so beautiful, ah
