Returning home, I look forward to the thrill
Of another lecture or another pointless drill
Ascend the front steps dreading further war
Why the fuck is my key not fitting in the door?
I guess I'm not wanted, I wonder what I'll do
I've already been banned from my friends houses too
I wonder what I did to make my mum so mad
No perfect homelife but the only one I had

Oh my god, mum changed the locks

Now I've got my freedom but no place to go
No prospects or money to go to a show
I haven't got on well with my mum all year
Can't use the phone to call my friends for a beer
