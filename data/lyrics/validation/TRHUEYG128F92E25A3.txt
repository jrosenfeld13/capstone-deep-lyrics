Create in me god a new clean heart
And give me your steady spirit, steady mind
Don't warp me from your visage
And don't take your holy ghost from me
Clean my conscience from this crime
Clean me from my sins that I repent on my misdeed
My sin is always in front of me
My sins are always in front of me

Look, I'm born as a sinner
And my mother conceived me in sin
Now clean my heart that I'll be snow white
Clean my heart that I'll be snow white

Clean my conscience from this crime
Clean me from my sins that I repent on my misdeed
My sin is always in front of me
My sins are always in front of me
Create in me god a new clean heart
And give me your steady spirit, steady mind
Don't warp me from your visage
And don't take your holy ghost from me

Look, I'm born as a sinner
And my mother conceived me in sin
Now clean my heart that I'll be snow white
Clean my heart that I'll be snow white
