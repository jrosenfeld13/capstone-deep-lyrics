I see you every night walking down the street and
Watching cars with the world looking at your feet so
Why dont we just count to ten and draw our guns and see?
This town aint big enough for you and me
All night scraping the sky with their funny faces
Lets go get in our cars go off to the races
What if there was nothing else but open sky and sea?
An island big enough for you and me
Dont stay inside open up your eyes
What if there was nothing else but open sky and sea?
An island big enough for you and me
I see you every night walking down the street and
Watching cars with the world looking at your feet so
Why dont we just count to ten and draw our guns and see?
This town aint big enough for you and me
This town aint big enough for you and me
This town aint big enough for you and me
