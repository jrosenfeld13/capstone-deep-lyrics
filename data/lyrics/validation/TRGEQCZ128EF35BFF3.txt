I've run alone through these empty streets
No children play in these wintry days
I've looked for you on the mountaintops
In the crashing waves, in the pouring rain

Somehow, I'm lost without you near me
I'm helpless and I can't speak
When I can't be with you, my heart has no home

So I wake up to a new brand new day
While children sleep, alone I pray
Walk with me on this perfect day
Through empty streets while my heart sings

Somehow, I'm lost without you near me
I'm helpless and I can't speak
When I can't be with you, my heart has no home

This is the moment I've waited for
This is the moment here in your arms today
Just for a moment
This is the moment

Somehow, I'm lost without you near me
I'm helpless and I can't speak
When I can't be with you my heart has no home
Somehow, I'm lost without you near me
I'm helpless and I can't speak
When I can't be with you my heart has no home

Just for the moment
This is the moment
These are the moments
