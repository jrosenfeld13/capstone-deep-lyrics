[Verse 1]
When you walked up behind me and covered my eyes
And whispered in my ear, guess who
I rattled off names like I really didn't know
But all along I knew it was you

And, the longer we talked, the more we laughed
And wondered why we didn't last
It had been a long time, but later last night
Baby, we caught up real fast

[Chorus]
And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is going to work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt
That's right
You look good in my shirt

[Verse 2]
Well now I'm not saying that we solved overnight
Every way that we went wrong
Oh, but what I'm seeing I'd sure love seeing
Every morning from now on

[Chorus]
And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is going to work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt

[Bridge]
Come on now
Aww, that's right
Oh, you look so fine
Eh, yeah

[Chorus]
And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is going to work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt
And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is going to work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt
You look good in my shirt

[Outro]
One, two, three, four
You look good in my shirt
Yeah, yeah
(Come on, now)
