If i ever left the scene
I wouldn't get too far
How could i miss a single zine
Or a flyer on the wall
And if there ever was a show
I know i'd have to go
And see all of my friends
I'm gonna be right here until the end

A couple years and you're gone
Straight Outta Hardcore
Now you're moving on
Straight Outta Hardcore
When it was trendy you were down
Straight Outta Hardcore
And now you're no where to be found
Straight Outta Hardcore

So now we have all grown
The old days are long gone
I guess i should have always known
You were just playing along
And know you wonder where it went
Cause you live your whole life in the past
I'll be living for the present
And won't spend my time just looking back
