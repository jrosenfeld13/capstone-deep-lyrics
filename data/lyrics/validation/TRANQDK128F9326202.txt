I don't feel like I know you
Flawed in trust and in truth you fake excuse
From the moment that I wake up
You taste the venom in your tea cup

As I look out the window
All I see is a deadly row of eyes
With no colour in their makeup
Many cracks in a mask that hides disgrace

In the paper there's a headline
"A vicious cloud weighs the sky down tonight"
They forsee a bloody screaming
In the palms of a man who is seething

I can smell your fake smile now
The glue sets on a face you wear proud
Remind me who the hell you are
I don't remember ever thinking we were friends

Spare me your bullshit
Cracking a smile disguises
All the underlying lies
They're bursting from your eyes

You're the traitor with a pounding head
As you drank another toast to the living dead
It's not wise to celebrate so soon
The party's over and you're sweeping up the room

I'm only glad that I brushed you aside
Cause I was choking on the dust from your empty mind
You're full of promises unpaid
This only serves to remind me you're a fake
A counterfeit will break

Spare me your bullshit
Cracking a smile disguises
All the underlying lies
They're bursting from your eyes
They're burstin' from your eyes

Burstin' from your eyes
