Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I heard
Was the song outside my window
And the traffic wrote the words
It came ringing up like Christmas bells
And rapping up like pipes and drums

Won't you stay
We'll put on the day
And we'll wear it 'till the night comes

Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I saw
Was the sun through yellow curtains
And a rainbow on the wall
Red, green and gold to welcome you
And crimson crystal beads to beckon

Won't you stay
We'll put on the day
There's a sun shower every second
(instrumental)
Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning
And the first thing that I knew
There was milk and toast and honey
And a bowl of oranges, too
And the light poured in like butterscotch
And stuck to all my senses

Won't you stay
We'll put on the day
And we'll talk in present tenses
