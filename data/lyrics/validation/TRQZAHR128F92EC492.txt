[Verse 1]
Gold and silver is the Autumn
Soft and tender are her skies
Yes and no are the answers
Written in my true love's eyes

[Verse 2]
Autumn's leaving and winter's coming
I think that I'll be moving along
I've got to leave her and find another
I've got to sing my heart's true song

[Verse 3]
Round and round the burning circle
All the seasons, one, two and three
Autumn comes and then the Winter
Spring is born and wanders free

[Verse 4]
Gold and silver burned my Autumns
All too soon they'd fade and die
And then, ah there were no others
Milk and honey were their lies
