By Gary Chapman, Jerry Mcpherson
There's a girl in Birmingham with her heart about to break
How could he fall for another
There's a girl in Tokyo, she has married her mistake
Maybe she'll run home to mother
Hearts break the same in each country
Tears fall alike 'round the world

Chorus:
Around the world we're all hopin', prayin'
Our little world survives with our lives
Around the world hear this message sayin'
Our little world can live when we learn to forgive
There's a boy in Lebanon with his hand around a gun
Learning to die for his homeland
There's a boy in San Antone, he is learnin' how to run
Having to live from his own hand
Each one has fear as his passion
Every young man wants to live

(Repeat chorus)
There's a man in Washington with a power in his hand
God only knows if he'll use it
There's a fear across the waves
There's a fear across our land
Only God's gonna help us all to lose it
(Repeat chorus twice
