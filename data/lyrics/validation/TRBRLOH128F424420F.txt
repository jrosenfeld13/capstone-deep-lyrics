Take a long drive with me
On California one, California one
Take a long drive with me
On California one, California one...

And the road a-winding goes
From golden gate to roaring cliff-side
And the light is softly low as our hearts become sweetly untied
Beneath the sun of California one

Take a long dram with me
Of California wine, California wine
Take a long dram with me
Of California wine, California wine

And the wine it tastes so sweet
As we lay our eyes to wander
And the sky, it stretches deep
Will we rest our heads to slumber beneath the vines of California wine?
Beneath the sun of California one

Annabelle lies, sleeps with quiet eyes
On this sea-drift sun
What can you do?
And if I said, "Oh it's in your head"
On this sea-drift sun
What can you do?

We're calling all bed wetters and ambulance chasers
Poor picker-pockets, bring 'em in
Come join the youth and beauty brigade

We're lining up the light-loafere'd
And the bored bench warmers
Castaways and cutouts, fill it up
Come join the youth and beauty brigade
Nothing will stand in our way

I figured I had paid my debt to society
By paying my overdue fines at the Multnomah County Library, at the library
They said 'son, go join up
Go join the youth and beauty brigade'

Nothing will stand in our way
