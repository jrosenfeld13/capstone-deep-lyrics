How many words can you fit inside a suitcase?
Packed it so tight that you couldn't sing in tune
Fell down the stairs cause you didn't tie your bootlace
Given a choice could you choose?

Walked through the park and you came across a cool place
Rested your head with a vodka by the pool
Went for a swim and you found that you were sinking
Don't you know pools are for fools?
Given the choice could you choose?

Groovin' along all alone in the park
Singing a song cause you're 'fraid of the dark
Running away from a world that can't walk
Swinging your hips so you don't have to talk

Showing your girl 'bout a natural way of living
Got bit in the ass by a tiger at the zoo
When you got home you just passed out in the kitchen
Now you've got no one to lose

Bought a new car with a fuel injected system
Popped in a tape and cruised around the town
Chased by a cop 'til he wrote you out a ticket
Now you can just dig the sound

Groovin' along all alone in the park
Singing a song cause you're 'fraid of the dark
Running away from a world that can't walk
Swinging your hips so you don't have to talk

What can you do when it feels like no one listens?
Where can you turn when you're turning on yourself?
Head to the church and you got yourself a 'Christened
Put your life up on his shelf

Ran to the store and they sold you on the future
Bit in your lip and you start to crack a smile
Come up with a plan but now does it really matter
When you got no reason why?
Given a choice would you try?
