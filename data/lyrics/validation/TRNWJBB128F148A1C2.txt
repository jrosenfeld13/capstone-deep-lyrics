Before I turn on my lover, gotta turn on my stereo
And it goes in better with a little bit of rock and roll
Now I'm easing to my pleasing by the candlelight
I'm slippin' on a stack of black wax and then I call it a night

I started groovin' and she started movin'
And we really started feeling fine
In the midst of consummation she caused me aggravation
When she started messing with that dial

Don't you change that song
It's my favourite record
Don't you change that song
It goes on and on again

I took her forty-fives right in my hand
And baby, I've got twelve inches of fun always at my command
Ease it out of the sleeve, put the needle in the groove
It ain't no silver platter, it's a matter of who does who

And I started shakin', the lady started takin'
And everything I disgorged
In the midst of satisfaction she caused a distraction

When she started messin' with that sound

Don't you change that song
It's my favourite record
Don't you change that song
It goes on and on again

Hey baby, there's no reason
Why we can't get along
It's easy to see I got the music in me
When it boils down, if you're gonna hang around
Baby, don't change that song

Don't you change that song
It's my favourite record
Don't you change that song
It goes on and on again
Don't you change that song
It's my favourite record
Don't you change that song
It goes on and on again
