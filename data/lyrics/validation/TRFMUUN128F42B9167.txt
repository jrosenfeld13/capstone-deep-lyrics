Must have been to blinded to see
It was there all along
And all the signs that I missed, gave up on me
They're already gone
Fire, I want it back
Desire, I want it back
Tell me you believe ther's no chance
That we still belong

OOO
I know I can't escape the pain
It's falling on me like the rain
Don't leave me alone

Nights are getting lonely and cold
I am left in the dark
And all the words should have been unspoken
Trust in our hearts
Fire, I want it back
Desire, I want it back
This can't be the end of the story
Let's not fall apart

OOO
I know I can't escape the pain
It's falling on me like the rain
Don't leave me alone
OOO
Baby try to keep the faith
To make the sun come out again
Don't leave me alone

I miss your skin on my skin
Won't you let me in
Need to have it all
I miss your kiss on my lips
Won't you not resist
Need to have it all
I need to have it all

Fire, I want it back
Desire, I want it back

(Chorus)
