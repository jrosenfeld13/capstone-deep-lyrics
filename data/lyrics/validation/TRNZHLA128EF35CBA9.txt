[Verse 1]
We stepped on the scene and shortly we chose our course
We were given the world but we lost it and found remorse
We fell so far (from day to night )
We fell so hard (we should have died)
And we would have perished and left no descendents
Except for a miracle

[Chorus]
Oh a miracle (a miracle)
Life is a miracle (gazing on the stars)
Formed from the chaos
And loved like a blameless child
Oh a miracle (a miracle)
Life is a miracle (walking in the dark)
We breathe every breath by the grace of God

[Verse 2]
We stepped on the moon as if it were obvious
And we watch life destroyed as if it were meaningless
Some unborn child (no mother's cries)
Some unknown soldier (destroyed by lies)
And lies would destroy this world
If if weren't for a miracle

[Chorus]
Oh a miracle (a miracle)
Life is a miracle (gazing on the stars)
Formed from the chaos
And loved like a blameless child
Oh a miracle (a miracle)
Life is a miracle (walking in the dark)
We breathe every breath by the grace of God

[Verse 3]
The choices we make will be heard 'til the end of time
As we try to remember how to live in a world that's dying
Beyond our place (beyond our time)
Beyond our faith (beyond our minds)
The truth lives on
Earth dances with heaven in a miracle

[Chorus]
Oh a miracle (a miracle)
Life is a miracle (gazing on the stars)
Formed from the chaos
And loved like a blameless child
Oh a miracle (a miracle)
Life is a miracle (walking in the dark)
We breathe every breath by the grace of God

[Outro]
We breathe every breath by the grace of God
Oh, oh, oh
Life is a miracle
Life is a miracle...
