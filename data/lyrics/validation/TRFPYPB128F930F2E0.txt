On some dismal planet

The second thing on Mars was monkey bars (x2)

The first was the big laugh
The last big laugh

The fourth thing on Mars was a gal of real sweet
The third was a bird
The fifth, a tiled floor still in its box
And the sixth
And the sixth I can't recall
And the seventh I can't recall all

And so it's a shame only that stuff made it to Mars, oh it's

It's really all so silly. So awfully awfully silly (x3)
It's really all so silly

The second thing Mars was monkey bars on Mars was monkey bars
The first was the big laugh
The fourth was a gal of real sweet
The third was a bird
The fifth a tiled floor still in its box
The sixth I can't recall
The seventh I can't recall
So

It's a shame only that stuff may get to Mars for it's a dismal place all covered in stuff

It's really all so silly. So awfully awfully silly (x3)
