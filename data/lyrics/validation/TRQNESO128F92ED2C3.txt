Rain keeps falling on your pale white skin
You are still new to taste of sin
Desire inside grows stronger than pain
And you can't resist this voice in rain

You feel no fear, you've been hurt before
For this night of sin, you're willing to go
And in your mind your thoughts are black
You take his hand and there's no way back

Come my darling, I'm here for you
This night is meant for me, and you
Come my darling, soon I'll be gone
This night has just, for us, begun

Come my darling, I'm here for you
This night is meant for me, and you
Come my darling, soon I'll be gone
This night has just, for us, begun
