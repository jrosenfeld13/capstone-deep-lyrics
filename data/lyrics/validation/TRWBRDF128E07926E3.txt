Shut down
Fallin over once again
Dropped out
Hand extended for a friend
Looked up
And there's you lookin in
And who cares
Cause no ones lookin anyway
Impaired
My vision lost to yesterday
And that's fine
Don't mind feelin that way
Just don't let me lie here by my self

Let's go
I know I'm faded
Drop outta sight
Tonight
Just stay with me, I don't wanna go home
Drop outta sight
Tonight
Just rescue me
I don't wanna go

Rewind and take me back to start again
Ducked out cause paranoia's settin in
But I'm with you until the end
One ride
We'll drive around the parkin lot
No pride
Cause I don't seem to care a lot
No cash
This change is all I got
Just don't let me ride here by myself now

Let's go
I know I'm faded
Drop outta sight
Tonight
Just stay with me, I don't wanna go home
All right
Tonight
Just rescue me, I don't wanna go
So stand still
One last thrill
Just stay with me and we'll never go home
Drop outta sight
Tonight
Just rescue me and we'll never go home
Yeah we'll never go home Yeah
I don't wanna go
One more ride
One time once again
Just climb in
I'm still climbing yeah
One more ride
One time once again
Just climb in
I'm still climbing

Drop outta sight
Tonight
Just stay with me, I don't wanna go home
All right
Tonight
Just rescue me, I don't wanna go
So set still
One last thrill
Just stay with me and we'll never go home
Drop outta sight
Tonight
So rescue me and we'll never go home
