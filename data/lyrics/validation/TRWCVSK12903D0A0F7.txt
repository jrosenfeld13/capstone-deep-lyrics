Trying to make the grade
Striving for your best
Beginning hopes seem slim as you
Break away from all the rest
No support from friends or peers
The battle rages on
Judging life by results
Won't show us where we've gone wrong

No failure -
You cannot afford the cost of wasting your time
No failure -
Who can decide if its really your best on the line?

Pressure to prevail
Logic put off guard
Can't reach a higher plane
When the past returns with all the scars
Guidelines plague our every move
Slowing progress down
Purpose lost with passing days
Will something change this time around?

Asking - answering
Looking - seeing
Should it really be so hard?
Seeking - finding
Directions clearer
Take chance out of the cards
