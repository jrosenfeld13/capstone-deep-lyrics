This is the time of awakening
The season has come for new life
The cold giving way to a warm wind
The darkness is 'chased by the light'

The world half asleep since the snowfall
Turning her face to the sun
Somehow the seeds still remember
To spring from the earth as one

And we sing the songs of love and we watch the stars above
For a sign of the change in the seasons, a return of the light of love

Some of us stay through the winter
And some of fly to the sun
Those who remain know the joy that comes
With the taste of spring rain on the tongue

And we sing the songs of love and we watch the stars above
For a sign of the change in the seasons, a return of the light of love

Is this the reason for living
To learn from earth how it's done
We're never far from our mother
She's where we are going and where we're from

And we sing the songs of love and we watch the stars above
For a sign of the change in the seasons, a return of the light of love
