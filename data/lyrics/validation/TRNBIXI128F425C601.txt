What do you take me for?
You think I'm nothing more
Than who you think I am
I tried to live the lie
I let that lifestyle die
And now I'm something more

(chorus)
Now I've got a peace of mind
There's just no better way
And if I should die tonight
That would be alright

I'm gonna try real hard
No matter what it takes
And even if I fail
I know that when life's done
And I'm accounted for
I lived it to the full

(sing chorus)
