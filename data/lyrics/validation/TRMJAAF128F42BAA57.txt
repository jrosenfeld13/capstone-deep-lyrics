Once I was invisible
For all the world to see
I travelled through the ether on
The blood of my enemies

And if they dared to whisper
When they thought they were alone
Then I was just as deadly as
A bug on the telephone

And though I was a child
And though I knew it well
You'd only know deliverance
To hope I would never tell

The night began to close around
The neighbourhood again
But as I walked the streets the devil
Tumbled down my brain

And though I was a child
And I knew right from wrong
Three can keep a secret if
Two are dead and gone

Not a long way away
On and on let us pray

The secret of my mystery
Will never see the dawn
And you will never ever know
If you were once my pawn

When I was a child
And when I went away
You were not the victim for
It was you who let me stay
