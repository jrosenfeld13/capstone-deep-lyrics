You walk in like you've never seen the light
You walk in like it every night
But I've never seen you dance
And I've never heard you sing
So how could it mean a single thing?
It's all so rudimentary

You talking like you handy in a fight
You talking like it every night
But I've never seen those flowers in the barrel of your gun
All I've ever seen you do is run
It's all so rudimentary

Well tell me baby, how does it feel?
I know you like the roll of the limousine wheel
And they all get them out for (they all get them out)
For the boys in the band (only for the boys in the band)
They twist and they shout for (they twist and they scream and shout)
For the boys in the band (only for the boys in the band)

You walk in like you've never seen the light
You walk in like it every night
But then I stop to think
And I ask myself why
It's one of those things that darling you must try
It's all so rudimentary

And now I'm jealous
I'm jealous of my own
I have no homestead but through these hearts I will roam

They all get them out for (they all get them out)
For the boys in the band (only for the boys in the band)
They scream and they shout for (they twist and they scream and shout)
For the boys in the band (only for the boys in the band)

But tell me baby, how does it feel?
I know you like the roll of the limousine wheel
And they all get them out for (they all get them out)
For the boys in the band (only for the boys in the band)
They scream and they shout for (they twist and they scream and shout)
For the boys in the band (only for the boys in the band)

Yes they all want them out for (they all get them out)
For the boys in the band (only for the boys in the band)
They scream and they shout for (they twist and they scream and shout)
For the boys in the band (only for the boys in the band)
