In a crowd naked, with no words to explain
In a car braking glass cracks
As I freeze the frame

Keep falling away
Keep falling away
While I watch myself and pray
Keep falling from view
What a mind puts a body through
And down on the ground onlookers stare

In a pool sinking, water fills my mouth
Sole victim of your own terror
Cold flesh as the air runs out

Keep falling away
Keep falling away
While I watch myself and pray
Keep falling from view
What a mind puts a body through
And down on the ground onlookers stare
