Never to go where the wind don't blow
Always to say 'you will find your way'
Always to be kicking around with the wind and breeze

So kiss me again in the moonlight, lady
'Cause you might just set me free
I was the one with your father when he
When he told me it would be this way
And I know I can't take the memory
And I know I can't take the memory

Never to go where the wind don't blow
Always to say 'you will find your way'
Always to be kicking around with the wind and breeze

So kiss me again in the moonlight, lady
'Cause you might just set me free
I was the one with your father when he
When he told me it would be this way
And I know I can't take the memory
And I know I can't take the memory
