She left her shoes out on the beach
She left my dreams just out of reach
She left her footprints in the sand
She was a bird right in the hand

I met a girl that made me laugh
She left a faded photograph
I thought I heard a silent song
I sang along but I was...

I was only dreamin'
I was only dreamin'
Visions in my head
Talking in my sleep
Turning in my bed
But I was only dreamin'

I met a girl that talked in rhyme
I met a girl who took her time
I saw the ocean in her eyes
I saw myself unrecognized
And all the stars up in the sky
Fell down like rain and made me cry
I held the world right in my hands
I held her close but I was...

I was only dreamin'
(I was only dreamin')
I was only dreamin'
Visions in my head
Talking in my sleep
Turning in my bed
Life was so complete
But I was only dreamin'...

(Wake up, wake up)
I was only dreamin'
Oh Yeah - I was only dreamin'
I was only dreamin'
Visions in my head
Talking in my sleep
Turning in my bed
Life was so complete
Her shoes were on the beach
But I was only dreamin'
