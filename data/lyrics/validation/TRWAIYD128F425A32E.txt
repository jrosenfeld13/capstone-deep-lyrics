Some days it looks like rain
Doesn't mean we stay inside
Just because we might get wet
Doesn't mean we run and hide
We're given circumstance
Doesn't mean it's always good
Sometimes things don't end up
The way we thought they would
But my reality
Is nothing less than all that You have promised me

What I see isn't always what will be
I know that there is a hope beyond what I can see

Can't say I understand
Each step along the way
What should be black or white
Suddenly is shades of gray
But when I can't see clear
I simply close my eyes
The light in me is bigger
Than the world outside
It all makes perfect sense
'Cause my trust is in nothing less than providence

It isn't so easy
Not like I thought it would be
But slowly I am seeing things are clear to You
