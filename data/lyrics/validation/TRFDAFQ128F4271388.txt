Whoo!

Oh, listen, baby, don't get funny
I ain't gonna waste my money
You ain't so hot, you won't turn cold
When I'm weighed down with wedding gold

And it's been like this for a thousand years
And I ain't gonna waste my tears

I'm gonna be a dead boy, cold meat by then
I'm gonna be a dead boy, cold meat by then

I can tell what you are thinking
And it's true, I've been drinking
You may smile, but I ain't joking
I just laugh, 'cos I've been smoking

And it's been like this for a thousand years
And I ain't gonna waste my tears

I'm gonna be a dead boy, cold meat by then
I'm gonna be a dead boy, cold meat by then
I'm gonna be a dead boy, cold meat by then
I'm gonna be a dead boy, cold meat by then

Ow! Take it, Bob!

And it's been like this for a thousand years
And I ain't gonna waste my tears

I'm gonna be a dead boy, cold meat by then
I'm gonna be a dead boy, cold meat by then
I'm gonna be a dead boy, cold meat by then
I'm gonna be a dead boy, cold meat by then
(Whoa, let's take it down!)

I'm gonna be a dead boy, cold meat by then
I'm gonna be a dead boy, cold meat by then
I'm gonna be a dead boy, cold meat by then
(Yeah, that's right)
I'm gonna be a dead boy, cold meat by then

I'm gonna be a dead boy, cold meat by then
(Mmm, yeah)
I'm gonna be a dead boy, cold meat by then
