This song is dedicated
To the city of New Orleans
From the whole world, let's go

I feel your heartbeat, I see your tears fall
I see your hands go up, now you've given up on it all
I see your head go down, I know you've lost hope
You're walls keep on comin' down and you can't take no more

Every road you travel seems like your journey's end
That life's an endless battle that you can't seem to win
Well I say, stand up and claim what's yours
Leave those troubles behind and don't you look back no more

Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine
Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine, let your light shine

I know your struggles and I feel your pain
You're doin' everythin' to stop yourself from goin' insane
Tryin' to find the strength to fight your way back
But life keeps swingin' on you 'cause you're under attack

You prayed and cried about it but still no change has come
My life is livin' proof that you're not the only one
And that's why I say, stand up and take your place
Hold your head up high and put a smile upon your face

Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine
Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine, let your light shine

When the storm sends it dark clouds
(And put it right over you)
And a step seems like a million miles
(And you don't know what to do)
You gotta stand and be strong now
(You've got to get up now)
And the morning will come and victory will be yours, yours

Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine, let your light shine
Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine, let your light shine

Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine, let your light shine
Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine, let your light shine

Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine, let your light shine
Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine, let your light shine

Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine, let your light shine
Let your light shine on the world
(No matter the weather)
Let your light shine, let your light shine
(We gonna shine together)
