Happy birthday, John
Where has your sweetheart gone
She left today with one week's pay
And the boy she calls your son

Let's not wait for your invitation
Pour yourself a drink
And think about what happened

Happy birthday, John
The warning lights were on
But you were far too gone
To notice what went wrong

Let's not wait for your invitation
Pour yourself a drink
And think about what happened

Happy birthday, John
Where has your sweetheart gone
The warning signs were on
Happy birthday, John

Let's not wait for your invitation
Pour yourself a drink
And think about what happened

Let's not wait for your invitation
Pour yourself a drink
And think about what happened
