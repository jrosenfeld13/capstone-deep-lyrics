Don't delay leave today
Get out now while you can
Don't be daft leave your half
To the hard drinking man
And if they start knocking
It's just the booze talking
They've got the Malt and Barley Blues

Take your chance

Someone tries to patronize you
When you don't know why
But you can stand up and look
Them right between the eyes
'cos it's just the booze talking
It's just the booze talking
They've got the Malt and Barley Blues
They've got the Malt and Barley Blues
It's just the Blues

Take your chance while you can
We're behind you all the way
Some are proud some are loud
They don't heed to what they say
It's just the booze talking
It's just the booze talking
They've got the Malt and Barley Blues
