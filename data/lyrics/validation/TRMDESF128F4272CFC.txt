Flogging a rocking Horse
Getting nowhere
We are a pair to behold
You like a funeral me like a fair
Nobody cares for the show

These days the rapids may drag us from here
And I do not care where we go
And you say that love is what we are my dear
But I just pretend not to know

If it's the be all and end all
Then come on now love lets make a start
When love calls then it's time to play ball
But starting's the easiest part

Counting my blessings like stars in the sky
The sleep walking moon watching on
And she's seen how lovers before us have tried
My darling lets not get it wrong

If it's the be all and end all
Then come on now love lets make a start
When love calls how sudden the fall
But falling's the easiest part

I've had love come to nothing before
But it's alright it's alright
I've welcomed it in
And I've shown it the door
But it's alright it's alright
