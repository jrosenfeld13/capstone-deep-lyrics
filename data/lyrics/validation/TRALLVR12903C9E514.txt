You must have thought my love was just a coin because
You tried to spend it like a dollar
You got the nice string but you know your yo yo is just the wrong color
That' why I'm telling you
Don't you mess with cupid
Cupid's not stupid
Don't you mess with cupid
Cupid's not stupid man
You thought my love was just a walk across the lawn
Then I'm just a walk on there's nothing more
You just don't ever seem to realize that I'm a man full grown
Don't you mess with cupid
Cupid's not stupid
Don't you mess with cupid
Cupid's not stupid man

Now when I'm looking for you you're never home
And like a lamp you turn it off and on
Just like a shade when you dim the lights
If it's on I can't do nothing right

Don't you mess with cupid
Cupid's not stupid
Don't you mess with cupid
Cupid's not stupid man
