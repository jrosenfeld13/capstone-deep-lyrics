Trial by fire
Final war is now at hand
Purity through annihilation
Crucifixion of the damned
Condemned is dissidence
Set free the demons of war
On towards Armageddon
On these fields the righteous shall fall
Witness to abomination
Set upon the weakness of flesh
From above the fire burns
So below the bringer of death
As this world burns
So shall these empty faiths
Nations are burning
As are these Gods we embrace
Dethroned are the prophets
Their lies have been exposed
Dawn of a new creation
From the ashes the beast is now know
Into the arms of annihilation
Another empire is coming down
Into the arms of annihilation
Creation is buring to the ground
Burning
Another empire is coming down
Burning
Another empire is coming down
Burning
Another empire is coming down
Burning
Another empire is coming down
In denial as we suffer
Our Gods are no more
Drown in mass deception
And bring forth the dogs of war
Into the arms of annihilation
Another empire is coming down
Into the arms of annihilation
Creation is buring to the ground
