'I'm flying, watch me now
'I'm flying, watch me now

She wore a T Shirt proclaiming love will reign
I touched her hand and I felt the same
Hey liberation what's that game

She fell in love with a cousin of my friend
Who said he'd be there till the end
He was a lying hippy fiend
A vegetarian and you can trust them

Baby, you're so free
You don't understand
What it is that you mean to me

Liberation, freedom for the girl in trendy flares
And bendy perms
Those neon lights in discotheque's
Safe sex on the pill but it doesn't always work'

Baby, you're so free
You don't understand
What it is that you mean to me (x2)

She wore a T Shirt proclaiming love will reign
I touched her hand and I felt the same
Hey liberation what's that game

Baby, you're so free
You don't understand
What it is that you mean to me (x2)

'I'm flying, watch me now
'I'm flying, watch me now

Watch me now
Watch me now
