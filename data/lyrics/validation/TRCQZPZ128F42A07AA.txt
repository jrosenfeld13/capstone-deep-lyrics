What you did to us was inexcusable
You disappointing, sallow scab
Took advantage of us got your way
Abused us, almost destroyed all we had

You took my strength
You took my passion
And turned it into a fashion show
Dollar signs in your eyes
You begin to fantasize about how much money you'll be owed

Drink your greyhound *
While you drive around
And everything you did's a letdown

I am not a robot
He is not a robot
He is not a robot
He is not a robot
Never again!
