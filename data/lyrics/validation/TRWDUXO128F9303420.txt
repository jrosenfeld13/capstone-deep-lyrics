Can't come down
I like the view from here
And i won't come down
Not 'til you come near
I've been wasting
Away up here
I'll be waiting
'Til my thoughts come clear

Perched up here
In my lookout tower
Froze with fear
At the midnight hour
I think I stay
Where life is safe and sound
It's the end of me
If I come down

'Least we're livin' the high life together
We'll be lovin' the high life forever
'Least we're livin' the high life together
We'll be lovin' the high life forever

Seems to me
It's just a way of life
Altered states
They make it seem alright
'Cause who's to say
Whether it's wrong or right?
It fills the need
To get me through the night

'Least we're livin' the high life together
We'll be lovin' the high life forever
'Least we're livin' the high life together
We'll be lovin' the high life forever

'Least we're livin' the high life together
We'll be lovin' the high life forever
'Least we're livin' the high life together
We'll be lovin' the high life forever

Forever...

Can't come down
I like the view from here
And i won't come down
Not 'til you come near
I've been wasting
Away up here
I'll be waiting
'Til my thoughts come clear

Can't come down
I like the view from here
And i won't come down
Not 'til you come near
I've been wasting
Away up here
I'll be waiting
'Til my thoughts come clear

'Least we're livin' the high life together
We'll be lovin' the high life forever
'Least we're livin' the high life together
We'll be lovin' the high life forever

'Least we're livin' the high life together
We'll be lovin' the high life forever
'Least we're livin' the high life together
We'll be lovin' the high life forever

Forever...
