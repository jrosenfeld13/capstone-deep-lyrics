[Verse 1]
Someone is smiling, someone cries
Whatever it is, it's alright
Someone is born, and someone dies
Something is holding the light

[Pre-Chorus]
It's standing in the line now
Standing in a line now
Standing here right now for you
Everything you do now
Everything you are now
Creating it right now for you

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day
The sun's coming up
The sun's going down for you
It's a beautiful day
And everyone sees the world's turning round for you

[Verse 2]
There's no need to be afraid
There is no need to deny
That everything is on this way
Life's going on in your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
It's standing in the line now
Standing in a line now
Standing here right now for you
Everything you do now
Everything you are now
Creating it right now for you

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day
The sun's coming up
The sun's going down for you
It's a beautiful day
And everyone sees the world's turning round for you

[Bridge]
It's a beautiful day
Oh...
It's a beautiful day
Oh...

[Pre-Chorus]
It's standing in the line now
Standing in a line now
Standing here right now for you
Everything you do now
Everything you are now
Creating it right now for you

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day
The sun's coming up
The sun's going down for you
It's a beautiful day
And everyone sees the world's turning round for you
