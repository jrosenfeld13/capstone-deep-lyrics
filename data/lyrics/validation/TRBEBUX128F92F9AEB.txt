The reactor's down
I guess for Labour Day
Today is the first day I ain't seen the great plume of steam
From across the lake
From across the lake
Hey, that's a morning moon, yeah

I'm not making strange
You said, "Someone's paying"
"When something's too cheap
Somebody's paying something"
You said, "Someone's paying something"
Under a morning moon, yeah
Say those little things that don't make anyone feel better, yeah

It didn't take too much to upset her
Nothing that could clear a room
Just say one little thing that could make me feel better
Under this morning moon, yeah

The sun's a lightbulb
And the moon is a mirror
There are times when you can see
Both the bulb and the mirror
See the bulb in the mirror
And that's morning moon, yeah
Say those little things that don't make anyone feel better, yeah

It doesn't take too much to upset her
It was nothing that could clear a room
Just say one little thing, trying to make you feel better
Under this morning moon, yeah
Under this morning moon, yeah

Morning moon, yeah, trying to make you feel better
Morning moon, yeah, nothing too far from the truth
Morning moon, yeah, trying to make you feel better
Morning moon, yeah, nothing too far from the truth
Morning moon, yeah, trying to make you feel better
Morning moon, yeah, nothing too far from the truth
