Blown in our winds of mischance
He would stay but that's not his way
What escape for her she swims in the dark
In too deep but still waves - "I'm okay and
I don't need his name, thank you
Mine fits me nicely, mine will do
Yeah, mine will do"

Unsteady footsteps can't walk alone yet
He's sends a postcard he says he's in debt
Now she's treading water got a back room to let
Curses in the backyard, neighbors on the doorstep
"You must give your child a name some time"
Well you mean his and what's wrong with mine?
Yeah, what's wrong with mine?"

Sometimes she could kill him
Sometimes this house gets too small
She drives him to distraction
To see if he will fall

But if the truth were told
Which it never is
With a family like that
Who needs enemies
She'd be better on her own
You sink her like a stone
