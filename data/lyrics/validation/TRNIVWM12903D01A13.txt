All this time I've been dreaming of it
All this time it's been haunting in my head
Tempting me
Inviting me to fall asleep in it's arms
To fall from grace
To breathe its ever-dimming dusk

Through my eyes
You could see the hurt I crave
Through my eyes
You'd see there's nothing left to save
I heard you said: "There's a light up ahead"
But I am heading towards a dead end
I just can't say no
I just can't let go for it's got me bent

I crave therefore I am and that is all I ever feel
I hoped you'd understand
One love, one pain, one enemy

I toast to misery as I dig into the devil's bone
And for eternity
The pain became me and won't leave me alone
