You cried alone by the window
Over the love that you lost
You gave it all
Never counting the cost
Rain like tears beat on your window
Melting your heart to the floor
No love returned
And now you have less than before

It's never for nothing
When you love with no return
It's never for nothing
Light your candle in the darkness
'Cause it's never for nothing

Your friends say you're the fool
For loving with nothing to gain
But they can't see the reward
That you'll claim
So hold on to the holy promise (that says)
"No labor of love is in vain"
Precious tears are changed to jewels
In the rain

(Repeat Chorus)
