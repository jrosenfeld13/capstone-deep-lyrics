Hi
I'm Ted Mosby
And exactly 45 days from now
You and I are gonna meet
And we are gonna fall in love
And we are gonna get marry and...
We're gonna have two kids
And we're gonna love them and each other so much
All that is 45 days away
But I am here now
I guess because
I want this extra 45 days
With you, I want each one of them
Look if I can't have them I took the 45 seconds
Before your boyfriend shows up
And punches me in the face
Because...
I love you
I always gonna love you
Until the end of my days
And beyond
