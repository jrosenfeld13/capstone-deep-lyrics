[Verse]
I feel alright
I found a place that fits tight
It feels small
But I won't get sad about it
The softest voice said to me
All through last night
I forget
But I won't feel bad about it
I'll stay inside and find a page that sounds right
Bombs outside
Such a small bird laughing at me

[Chorus] x2
Be me
Be mine
I might have not have reminded you to feel
(mine to feel)

[Outro]
I feel alright
I found a face that fits tight
It feels small
But i won't get sad about it
