Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing over the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains

Gloria in Excelsis Deo
Gloria in Excelsis Deo

Come to Bethlehem and see
He, whose birth, the angels sing
Come, adore on bended knee
Christ, the Lord, the newborn King

Gloria in Excelsis Deo
Gloria in Excelsis Deo
