Monsters speak with my voice telling me what to do
That's their way of turning me into to what they want

I'm not going to let them into my heart
They can make me lie and try to visualize for a lifetime
Then the sun will set never been before (it) is beautiful

Monsters speak with my voice telling me what to do
That's their way of turning me into to what they want

I'm not going to let them into my heart
They can take my life to the twilight zone on December 4th
Having seen you alone on December 4th , looking beautiful
Like no other, looking out for you
Some way or another looking out for me on December 4th
