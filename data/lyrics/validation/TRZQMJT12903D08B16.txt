Oh
What's he doing when he looks in my eyes
I get the feeling that I know I can't hide
My heart is pounding and my lips are on fire
My pulse is rising and I feel with desire
And when he looks at me I know there's gonna be
Some hot love
Hot love
A lot of hot love
Hot love
A lot of hot love. - Oh
Hot love
Hot love
A lot of hot love
Hot love
A lot of hot love
I fall into his arms and he holds me tight
He smiles and asks me if I'm feeling alright
He's got the kinda looks that I can't resist
He's got the kinda lips that I long to kiss
Then when he looks at me I know there's gonna be
Some hot love
Hot love
A lot of hot love
. . 
He's just the one that I wanted
He's got that look in his eye
When he stands next to me I feel that ecstasy
Creeping up on me
I'm on fire
Hot love
A lot of hot love
Hot love
A lot of hot love
Hot love
A lot of hot love
Hot love
A lot of hot love
Hot love
A lot of hot love
. . 
Then when he looks at me I know
There's gonna be some hot love
Hot love
A lot of hot love
Hot love
A lot of hot love. - Oh
Hot love
Hot love
A lot of hot love
Hot love
A lot of hot love
He's just the one that I wanted
. . 
Hot love
A lot of hot love
. .
