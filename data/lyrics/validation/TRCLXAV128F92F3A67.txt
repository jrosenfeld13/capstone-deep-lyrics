Right on Time
U changed my mind
Right on Time
Showed me I could do it again
U came?

V1: So Out of touch with myself
Not strong enough to do this all over again (no)
I don?t wanna come face to face with crazy ways of Love again

I refuse to make the same mistakes, waste my time
To deal with all of the troubles that comes along with Love
I don?t wanna hurt no more
No doubts , no reservations

Hook. U changed my mind
Right on Time
Showed me I could do it again

V2

Don?t wanna listen to nomore tired lieswhere truth always subside
Much Better off on my own out here, Cause I won?t let me down
Showed me that it was all the choices that
I made, had to find my way, and do what was right one 4 me
Helped me remember, how good it could be when it?s working out see u?

Vamp: I never knew that (it could be so )
It?s was you that (open my heart)
I use to think that (so hopeless)

Bridge:
I thought that I knew
All that there was to know
But I never knew , til
You came along
Gave me a brand new song
So glad that you
