Let me get lost
I'll drive you around 'til I run out of gas
Find me a boss
There are ripples in my tea cause an
Earthquake's coming

And there's people meeting on Mars
And people driving in their cars
And kids are laughing under the stars today

Let me go hide
Find a box to put BK inside
Things are so well
We're blowing shit up only you could tell

And there's people meeting on Mars
And people driving in their cars
And kids are sleeping under the stars today

No reason reason
There's no reason reason
There's no reason reason
There's no reason to cry

I'm going against
Every person that I once walked with
Things are happening
My cat is sleeping and my jade tree's dying

And there's people meeting on Mars
And people crashing in their cars
And kids are kissing under the stars today

No reason reason
There's no reason reason
There's no reason reason
There's no reason to say goodbye

No reason reason
There's no reason reason
There's no reason reason
There's no reason to...

No reason reason
There's no reason reason
There's no reason reason
There's no reason to cry. (say goodbye)
