I'm keeping our love warm
Keeping myself on cool
Keeping our love warm
Living by the lovers' rules

I know we have to be apart
That's just the way we have to live
But darling
That can't change my heart
You're the only one that I give my love to

And I'm keeping our love warm
Holding myself in check
I'm keeping our love warm
Wanting to hold you every second

You know I'm always waiting here
Saving it all for you
You never need to have a fear
There's no other one that I'd give my love to

Ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

I dream about you every night
Think of you everyday
You know
I'm gonna do you right
You're the only one that I give my love to

She's keeping our love warm
(Keeping our love warm)
Keeping herself on cool
(Keeping myself on cool)

She's keeping our love warm
(Keeping our love warm)
Living by the lovers' rules
(Living by the lovers' rules)

She's keeping our love warm
(Keeping our love warm)
Keeping herself on cool
(Keeping myself on cool)

She's keeping our love warm
(Keeping our love warm)
Living by the lovers' rules
(Living by the lovers' rules)

Keeping our love warm
