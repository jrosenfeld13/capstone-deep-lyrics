Beautiful you know you leave me breathless when
You fall into my eyes
My heart belongs to you my angel
There is just no reason for you to let
Life bring you down
Please come with me and let me show you

I know that at times it may be hard
To let go of yourself
Baby girl tonight leave your cares behind
Because it's time to celebrate
All night long I'll sing and dance with you
My sweet princess only if you trust in this...
Take my hand and follow me
I will sweep you
(I will sweep you)
Off of your feet
All night long I will sing and dance with you

Everytime I look at you I can't believe
How Magical you are
The stars belong to you my angel
Run away with me into a world where time
Seems to not exist
The smile on my face will show you

I know that at times it may be hard
To let go of yourself
Baby girl tonight leave your cares behind
Because it's time to celebrate
All night long I'll sing and dance with you
My sweet princess only if you trust in this...
Take my hand and follow me
I will sweep you
(I will sweep you)
Off of your feet
This night will only end when we stop
Dancing

My sweet princess
I will sing and dance with you
(All night long)
The stars, they belong, to you My Angel

All night long I'll sing and dance with you
My sweet princess only if you trust in this...
Take my hand and follow me
I will sweep you
(I will sweep you)
Off of your feet
This night will only end when we stop
