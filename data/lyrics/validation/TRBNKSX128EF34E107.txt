Woke up on my worn red carpet
Bought cheap in an antique market

A winding path that stretches far
Further than the eye can see
Take a stroll to happiness
Joy and mystery

Woke up on my worn red carpet
Bought cheap in an antique market

Pleasant times are there for you
Or anyone who follows me
A see-through world of silent sound
Filled with ecstasy

Pay the piper call the tune
You'll be back again so soon

Woke up on my worn red carpet
Bought cheap in an antique market

Pay the piper call the tune
You'll be back again so soon

Woke up on my worn red carpet
Bought cheap in an antique market

Woke up on my worn red carpet
Bought cheap in an antique market
