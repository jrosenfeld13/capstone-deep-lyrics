[Verse 1]
You can't see me behind the door
I just heard everything you said
You call him
You're saying all the things you used to say to me
Who is he?
I never thought you'd drop
That avalanche on me
And be unfaithful
These hotel walls are paper thin
I'm going out

[Chorus 1]
Seven seven with the lime will keep me safe
Long enough to stop the thought of your embrace inside my head
The lies that I've been fed
Throw it back behind my lips the pain is gone
Line them up and knock them down
The night goes on and on and on to
Let me cope with this disaster

[Verse 2]
I'm seven deep
Long brown hair and blue eyes
Looking right at me
Who is she?
I never thought I'd ever think of stepping out
I'll fight this temptation
This crowded bar is full of sin
I'm going out

[Chorus 1]
Seven seven with the lime will keep me safe
Long enough to stop the thought of your embrace inside my head
The lies that I've been fed
Throw it back behind my lips the pain is gone
Line them up and knock them down
The night goes on and on and on to
Let me cope with this disaster

[Chorus 2]
I'm not coming home tonight
I'd rather sleep on the street
I'm not coming home to you
I won't sleep with the devil
I'm not coming home tonight
I'd rather sleep on the street
I'm not coming home to you
I won't sleep with the devil
I'm not coming home tonight
I'd rather sleep on the street
I'm not coming home to you
I won't sleep with the devil
On this city street I'll rest my head tonight
I'm going out!

[Chorus 1]
Seven seven with the lime will keep me safe
Long enough to stop the thought of your embrace inside my head
The lies that I've been fed
Throw it back behind my lips the pain is gone
Line them up and knock them down
The night goes on and on and on to
Let me cope with this disaster
