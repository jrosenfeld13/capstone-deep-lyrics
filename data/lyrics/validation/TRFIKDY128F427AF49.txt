Where did you go
When things went wrong for you
When the knives came out for you?
Where did you go?
All you needed was a friend
You just have to ask and then...

You don't have to have the solution
You've got to understand the problem
And don't go hoping for a miracle
All this will fade away
So I'm coming home
I'm coming home

What did you learn
Locked away all on your own
Chance and your head all blown
What did you learn
It was unfortunate
You missed you chance to find out that

You don't have to have the solution
You've got to understand the problem
And don't go hoping for a miracle
All this will fade away
So I'm coming home
I'm coming home

You don't have to have the solution
You've got to understand the problem
And don't go hoping for a miracle
All this will fade away
So I'm coming home
I'm coming home

I'm coming home
But just for a short while
