I was in Tahoe, on the California side
Waiting in the lobby at 665 1/2 Frontage Road
When two extra-blond short sleeve button-down
White-shirt blue-tie mystery Mormons
Came in and put this music on:
Came in and took me by the arm
And as they had me marching through the parking lot-
And as they were marching through the parking lot-
They blew into their shirt-pocket microphones
Like this:
And then they drove me to an Albertson's outside of Boise
And took me into a back room
And they said they wanted to balance my checkbook;
And they said they wanted to organize my receipts
And itemize my expenses
And that I had the key
To a safety deposit box
With treasury bonds and the key
To another safety deposit box
Where I'd stashed away
The only pewter pocket watch
That ever belonged to
Joseph Smith's Great-Great Uncle's
Brother-in-Law
And I said, "You've got the wrong Eleanor Friedberger."
And then they sang at me like this
