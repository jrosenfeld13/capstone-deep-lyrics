We've traded in our EZ chairs for these bar stools
And our remote controls for a bunch of old pool cues
We left our houses all in a row
Cause we've all been told just where to go
So we found out home away from home

Chorus:
Now We're All Here
Cause we ain't all there (yeah)
We got pieces of our broken hearts scattered everywhere
It ain't home, but it ain't bad
We ain't happy, but we ain't sad
But We're All Here
Cause we ain't all there

Willie had a problem with puttin' the bottle down
Old Jimmy had a bad habit, of runnin' around round
An ol' Snake Eyes has gambled too much
I guess one night he just lost his touch
But as for me I never done a damn thing wrong (yeah right)

Chorus:
My hound dog's callin' me
I miss my big screen TV
You know I really hate to admit
I even miss my baby just a little bit

Chorus2:
Now We're All Here (We're All Here)
Cause we ain't all there (Cause we ain't all there)
We got pieces of our broken hearts scattered everywhere
It ain't home, but it ain't bad
We ain't happy, but we ain't sad
But We're All Here (We're All Here)
Cause we ain't all there (Cause we ain't all there)
But We're All Here
Cause we ain't all there

(I just wanna go home, does anybody got a quarter)
(anybody seen my wife)
