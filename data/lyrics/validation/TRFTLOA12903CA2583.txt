(Intro)
So it looks like you're going to be in the record business
You think it's a pretty good idea?
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Ya know, not for myself of course and other guys I'm singing with
And because of our plans, in the future
Ya know, for the group and things we wanna do

(Cold Chris)
Pick it up, freak it
Peep and get a look-a
Chris be comin' off like clothes on a hooker
A mad motha' you can't change
Into the game, other kids sound lame
And it's a god damn shame
Inject 'em dissect 'em ? come back ? roughneck with no sweat
Handled together it's a tough bet
I'm here to turn the track out
Never on the back out
Chris be going off like lights in a blackout
Leavin' other fools singing the blues
Ooooo, at the bottom of the river wearing cement shoes
From tha ground unda, the gutter style strutter
Mad butter, rappin' like a mother
Flippin' the flash brass do grass on a quick ?
Check, cuz I'm catching more effect than a car crash
Kickin' that dope reach
To bring the boom like thunder
Straight from tha ground unda

(Hook)
From tha ground
From tha ground unda
From tha ground
From tha ground unda
From tha ground
From tha ground unda
From tha ground
From tha ground unda

Biggity-back ?
? ?
Thinkin' about my style
Like most people think about greetin'
Than um, getting busy, busier than a bumble bee
And mumble-jumble'n but never fumble'n
? ? me and the lady and ? ? to the early ?
? ? never gonna miss your chance to shoot the Christmas gift
More swift than a rattlesnake
I'm thinkin' that that might take
Much more serum than your average model'll make
Of an emcee or should I say master
Of ceremony mic controller, the holder
I told ya I was serious, but you made me furious
But thinkin' that you could handle it
But you know I'm getting deep
And about to go much deeper
So let loose let the juice the freestyle millimeter
That ya puff like a ? now you rough and rugged wonder
Hype Dawg and Mad Flava from the freakin' ground unda

(Hook)

The split streeter takin' you deeper and deeper
I roll like reefer when I flow to blow your chump's speaker
The soul freaker, called Cripsy the name
I go with the flame because my flow is like butane
Fire! The roughneck for hire
Every urge desire
As I kick it liver than a wire
The flowa, the overthrowa, the swinging punker
The blunter, kicking more game than a punter
Ready as I've ever been
Strong as Excedrin
If I had to battle 2 emcees I'd double-header it
Now let me tell the tale of the rugged roughneck
Comin' rugged from the set, comin' out of Dallas Tex
Catch the suplex, now who wanna step next
The pile driver and ain't nobody's style liver
Now get the picture ? I hit you like a top-gunna
It's Mad Flava comin' up from tha ground unda

(Hook)

You'll sink into the rhyme like quicksand
You'll sink into the rhyme like quicksand
You'll sink into the rhyme like quicksand
You'll sink into the rhyme like quicksand
You'll sink into the rhyme like quicksand
You'll sink into the rhyme like quicksand
You'll sink into the rhyme like quicksand
You'll sink into the rhyme like quicksand
You'll sink into the rhyme like quicksand
You'll sink into the rhyme like quicksand
