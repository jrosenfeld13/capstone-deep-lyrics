Is there a king that can do no wrong
When I play my fiddle-will I see you dance
The crown that sings its very own song
You crack the whip-and I'll break the lance

CHORUS
You make me feel so proud and sure
You make me feel like an emperor
So secure from the familiar
Uncommon sense is the great leveller
An emperor-we need you
An emperor-we need you
Best to flatter the devil-than fight him

The weak heart hidden-in weaker sin
An occupation is as good as land

In you I have a kingdom in the palm of my hand
CHORUS
Even a speckle of sand

Can be dangerous in the right hand
Don't want to be no inflexible flake
If I'm standing too brittle-I know that I'll break
And all the doors-I broke inot
And all the doors-I opened for you
And lift the hammer-lift the curse
I've seen too many crack at the seams
The chance to put heaven back on earth
I need the wonder of all my wet dreams

CHORUS
Little fears keep us in chains

And throw away thoughts, flushed down the drains
Sweet poetry

CHORUS
