People Say He's A Pescadore
From The City Of Salvadore
People Say He Came Long Ago
But That's All That They Seem To Know
What's Your Name
You Can't Ask, Can't See
My Name Matters Not Says He
But I Do Have A Song To Sing
And The Love For A Poets String
And I Know What A Song Can Do
Make A Wish And I Make It True
Birembau
When He Plays That Bow And String
What Magic He Can Bring
So Sing You
Birembau
Play Your Song Across The Sea
And Tell My Love For Me
I Need Her
