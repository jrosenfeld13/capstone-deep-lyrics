Fighting my way every day
Trying no to let them see or get inside of me
I know I got to hold on a little longer
Any day seems so far away
I don't get a chance to breathe
Any day seems so far away
I don't get a chance to breathe

And when will I know I can move myself on forward
And when will I know I can move myself on forward

How can I go wrong when life is feeling strong
Watching my dreams just fade away, fade away

And I can't find my way out of this desperation
I've been kicked so hard down
I feel myself bleeding
Any day seems so far away
I don't get a chance to breathe
Any day seems so far away
I don't get a chance to breathe

And when will I know I can move myself on forward
And when will I know I can move myself on forward

How can I go wrong when life is feeling strong
Watching my dreams just fade away, fade away
How can I be strong when life is going wrong
Watching my dreams just fade away, fade away

Watch me fade away, watch me fade away

And when will I know I can move myself on forward
And when will I know I can move myself on forward

How can I go wrong when life is feeling strong
Watching my dreams just fade away, fade away
How can I be strong when life is going wrong
Watching my dreams just fade away, fade away

How can I be strong when life is going wrong
Watching my dreams just fade away, fade away

How can I be wrong, how can I be strong
How can I be wrong, how can I be strong
