Sitting on a job from 9 to 5
All I ever do is stay alive
Thinking to myself is it worth it?

I really need some comfort from you now

Cos I'm not used to wake up in this hour
Long before the morning seems started

When Im home from work its all a drag
I'am so tired of always being sober
I just can't wait until this day is over

Cigarettes is killing me, I know
Its just one way of many to go
I dont see why I should even bother

Starting saking(?) every time I sleep
Gaybe its the secrets that I keep
I can't even seem to stop the wondering
So then when you tell me where to go
I'am so tired of being on my toes
I just want to be yours until its over
