[Chorus x2]
This is my moonshine rhyme
You know I stay drunk most all of the time
I say goodbye to the world and I guzzle again
Kick back, relax drinking with my friends

[Verse 1]
Heres a seat, sit down and have a drink
Vibe with me for a moment, taste and tell me what you think
I love liquor, love beer, wine gets me almost there
But the shine from the moon makes a rainy sky clear
No matter what you get me through the dark times
Only damn problem is that I do love her too much
Cant put her down, always there for me in the clutch
Aint no wrong about it, keep it strong, I know that I must
She the goods, need the perfection, the perfect selection
Crafted by my hand and you wont see no protesting
Cause all the neighbours know I make a mean batch
They swill it down the hatch and I politely say

[Bridge]
Friends and family take a shot for me
Toast to good times, thank God with me
Pour one up for those that passed away
Have a couple more, we getting drunk today

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Everydays a Friday, the Saturdays are my day
Make the magic potion, really stock my supply
Why would I lie? I speak easy at my speakeasy
But you cant order what the other saloons provide
It dont compare to what Im cracking off, now I stare
Aint no pill, try to feel copping the high
This is the real deal, be no faking
Surrounded by the souls of the desert where I forever reside
We never die, we staying pickled to the pores
Slowly functioning, sharing all the good times of yores
? pretending ? tall-tale sipping, we aint tripping
