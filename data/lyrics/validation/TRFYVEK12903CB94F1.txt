[Intro]
Reliving the past?
You lost! (blessed, blessed)
You better walk on the right path
Big life! Livety!
Straight up
Mankind, unuh sing
Song!

[Hook]
Memories don't live like people do
They always 'memba you
Whether things are good or bad
It's just the memories that you have
The Beenie Man a sing say, "Hey!"
Boy, stop live down inna di past
Stop from 'memba when man a ride horse
Now your dead, that means yuh soul lost
Crushed like a serpent snake under grass (again!)
Boy, stop live down inna di past
Stop from 'memba when man a ride horse
Body between di board, your head a peep through the glass
Crushed like a serpent snake under grass

[Verse 1]
Meg, peg, diss a man yuh dead
Way back inna di west before dem lick Jango head
For a few more dollars
'Nother one dead
High plains drifter man ah fled (I sing)
Too much wickedness
Down inna di west
Down inna di west
Wild Apache form
Dem nest
Dem nest
Outlaw Josey Wales
Get vexed (get vexed)
All bounty hunter
Dem draw fi
Dem vest (dem vest)
Gold an diamond
Wicked man intercept (intercept)
Pack up mi saddle
And decide to make a flex
Way back inna di future
Where me haffi make a step (and sing along)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I cyan believe or understand
Why some man approach that white man tradition
Talk 'bout dem a Cowboy and Indian
Me an African, and me a born black man
And, a who deh pon the mic? The fabulous Beenie Man
Same, maga, skinny, and same cranky one
Talking lyrics to all the nation
And sing along

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
But, what I cyan understand
Why some man a reveal white man tradition
Talk 'bout dem a Cowboy and Indian
Like dem no respect dem complexion
Me black and me ugly, Africa me come from
One day you got to return to that land
Selassie I me praise
It's here me make mi stand
So, sing along

[Hook]
