[Verse 1]
A little girl, a little small for her age
A little too slow for the field day race
Momma's waiting at the finish line
And wipes the teardrops from her eyes
She says, "you did just fine honey, that's okay
"Sometimes life's just that way
"You're gonna lose the race from time to time
"But you're always gonna find

[Chorus]
"You can't lose me
"Bet your life
"I am here and i will always be
"Just a wish away
"Wherever you go
"No matter how far
"My love is where you are
"You won't be lost if you believe
"You can't lose me"

[Verse 2]
Momma use to say "girl it won't be long
'"Till it's time to go out on your own
"Chase your dreams find your place in life
"I know you'll do just fine"
When that day finally came
There were things she needed to but could not say
So i whispered softly as i wiped
The tears from momma's eyes

[Chorus]
