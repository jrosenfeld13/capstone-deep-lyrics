How can you ask me that
How can you even consider it
From where I stand, I know you don't
I know there's a million guys out there
And I'm deeply flattered
But I know why you're asking
It doesn't really matter

Cause you wouldn't know romance if it came in your mouth
Cause you got no heart

You're a headfoot
Thinking of legging it
Yeah
You're a headfoot
You ain't got no heart

You think you're so daring
But how can someone be brave
When you've got nothing to lose to start with
You don't need guts to flirt
Not the first, not the final kiss
What takes courage is embracing what you know you'll miss

You're not singled out
You can't live without
Your pretty face ain't making pace

You're a headfoot
Thinking of legging it
Yeah
You're a headfoot
You ain't got no heart

Headfoot
Thinking of legging it
Yeah
You're a headfoot
You ain't got no heart
You got no heart

You're always legging it
Always running scared
What if it was you who cared

As for myself, I'm a curious child
I know where I stand when I'm running wild
Got a place to start
Got a hungry heart
I'm going out tonight
I'll love out your lights

You got no deal cause you got no feelings
You just walk and talk
You got no time for your guts and heart

Headfoot
Headfoot
Headfoot
You ain't got no heart
You got no heart

Punk you
