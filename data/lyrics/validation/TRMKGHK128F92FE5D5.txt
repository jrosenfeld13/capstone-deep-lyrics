Yeah you, you look like trouble
You, you're always dancin'
Look who's fashion conscious
True always romancin'

Out until the sunlight
Nothing else to say
Puttin' out 'til morning
Well then just walk away

I've seen your pictures in the magazine
I knew it must be you
You know I really wanna meet you, girl
On 7th Avenue

It's your sweet attitude

You, you're always playin'
I don't know what you're sayin'
You, you like the night life
Well diamond girls don't think twice

Showy strings of pearls and
Trips around the world
Got men 'round your finger
Well that's my kind of girl

I've seen your pictures in the magazines
I knew it must be you
You know I really want to meet you, girl
On 7th Avenue

It's your sweet attitude

Yeah you, you look for trouble
You, you're always dancin'
Look who's fashion conscious
True always romancin'

I got love I want to show you
I know it's up to you
You know I'm dyin' to meet you, girl
On 7th Avenue
On 7th Avenue
On 7th Avenue
You know I really want to meet you, girl
On 7th Avenue
