[Verse 1]
I confused a few people and whistled a tune
In the cold grass where I lie
And the beasts were all tame as we lay down beside them
Light from the darkness shone in their eyes
Oh that night
We were sedated and strewn on the ground
Like the leaves and the trees we were blowin'
And she was there too but she did not approve
Of the songs that we sang though we did not oblige her
Her cries at night

[Chorus 1]
Oh that night, I woke up
And the river was burning, very concerning to me
Off the cuff
It was a pale colored hue that night, I woke up
And the band was still playing, people were saying to you
Looks like the sky's on fire

[VERSE 2]
Me in the grass hon and you in your cap
I don't care much for your temper
But I'll come home with you if you'll get me a few
Of those little pills that you sell by the dozen
To my cousin

[Chorus 2]
Oh that night, I woke up
And the river was burning, very concerning to me
And off the cuff
It was a pale colored hue that night, I woke up
And containers were busting, very disgusting to you
That looks like the sky's on fire
Looks like the sky's on fire
Looks like the sky's on fire

[VERSE 3]
Well I confused a few people and whistled a tune
In the cold grass where I lie
And she was there too

[Chorus 3]
Oh that night, I woke up
And the river was burning, very concerning to me
Off the cuff
It was a pale colored hue that night, I woke up
And the band was still playing, people were saying to you
Looks like the sky's on fire
Looks like the sky's on fire
It looks like the sky's on fire
