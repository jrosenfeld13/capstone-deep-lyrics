I get high when I see you go by
My oh my
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you?
Its only love, and that is all
But its so hard loving you
Is it right that you and I should fight
Every night?

Just the sight of you makes night time bright
Very bright
Haven't I the right to make it up girl?
Its only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
Its only love, and that is all
But its so hard loving you
Yes its hard loving you
Loving you
