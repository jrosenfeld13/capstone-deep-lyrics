(Rolling ball, pins falling)
Wow-wee, ha, ha, ha, haaaaa, a strike
Boom-boom-boom, boom-a-boom-boom
Boom-boom-boom, boom-a-boom-boom, boom
Rip Van Winkle, Rip van Winkle
Sleep, sleep, sleep, ha, ha, ha, haaaaa
Rip Van Winkle, Rip Van Winkle
Sleep, sleep, sleep
Boom-boom-boom boom-a-boom-boom
Boom-boom-boom boom-a-boom-boom, boom
He fell asleep in the woods one day
Spent twenty years of his life that way
Boom-boom-boom boom-a-boom-boom
Boom-boom-boom boom-a-boom-boom, boom
Rip Van Winkle, Rip van Winkle
Sleep, sleep, sleep
That nagging wife kept all of his coin
None of his friends did he ever join
While those little elf's bowled on the green
He would dream, dream, dream
Oh well, he left his nagging wife now
He slept for 20 years
Didn't bother to wake up
He grew a long white beard
This is how the story goes
Listen my children and you will hear
He fell asleep in the woods one day
Spent twenty years of his life that way
That nagging wife kept all of his coin
None of his friends did he ever join
Rip Van Winkle, Rip van Winkle
Doo, doo, doo, doo, da-doo
Boom-boom-boom boom-a-boom-boom
Boom-boom-boom boom-a-boom-boom, boom
Rip Van Winkle, Rip van Winkle
Sleep, sleep, sleep
Rip Van Winkle, Rip Van Winkle
Sleep, sleep, sleep
Rip Van Winkle, Rip van Winkle
Slept his life away
Rip Van Winkle, Rip Van Winkle
Slept his life away
Boom-boom-boom boom-a-boom-boom
Boom-boom-boom boom-a-boom-boom, boom
Those little elf bowled on the green
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz [snoring]
(Rolling ball, pins falling, "wow-wee!")
