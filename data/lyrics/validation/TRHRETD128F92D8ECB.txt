I never had a problem with drinkin'
'til I ran out of booze
Never had a problem with thinking
'til I started watching the news
I never had a problem with the rhythm of life
Groovin' on down the line
Singing my songs on the backbeat baby
Swinging along in my own time
I've paid all of my dues, livin' the life I choose, I got no one to prove
I've got nothing to loose, got nothing to loose
I've never had a problem with lying
Couldn't lay straight in bed
Never had a problem with faking
Crooked as a dog's hind leg
I never had a problem with being the clown
Always coping it sweet
Making people laugh was my joke baby
Didn't need a wig or big flat feet
I've paid all of my dues
Never wore out my dancing shoes
I've got nothin' to prove, I've got nothing
I've never had a problem with loosing
'til it was my turn to cry
Never had a problem with leaving
This is me waving bye bye
Never hat a problem with the girlies I've known
Was just me lovin' my way
If they started lovin' me too much baby
I'd kiss em and then run away
I've paid all of my dues, livin' the life I choose
I got no more to prove, I got nothing to loose
