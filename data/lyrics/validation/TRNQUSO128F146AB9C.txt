Midst of the rain, so full of pain
Rescued my soul, love took control
Midst of the rain, to smile again
Awesomely changed, midst of the rain

Now every time I lift my eyes to the sky
I'm reminded of a time in my life
When all the dark clouds hung over me
I was lost inside in search of a key

I remember loved ones being so kind
Saying things would get much better with time
And I admit sometimes they did for a while
And then I'd find myself back under the cloud

Right in the midst of the rain
My heart was so full of pain
You came and rescued my soul
And then your love took control

Right in the midst of the rain
You caused me to smile again
My life was awesomely changed
Right in the midst of the rain

When it comes right down to just you and me
There's nothing better now these eyes can see
And tell me what compares to all you are
You are everything, yes, my morning star

My mind my heart and soul, said, I now give to you
I'm under your command, so what can I do?
'Cause I surrender all, all that I owe
And will follow wherever you go

Right in the midst of the rain
My heart was so full of pain
You came and rescued my soul
And then your love took control

Right in the midst of the rain
You caused me to smile again
My life was awesomely changed
Right in the midst of the rain

There will never be another
'Cause you're nothing like the others
This love I find in you
I found to be true

Midst of the rain, so full of pain
Rescued my soul, love took control
Midst of the rain, to smile again
Awesomely changed, midst of the rain

Right in the midst of the rain
My heart was so full of pain
You came and rescued my soul
And then your love took control

Right in the midst of the rain
You caused me to smile again
My life was awesomely changed
Right in the midst of the rain

Midst of the rain, so full of pain
Rescued my soul, love took control
Midst of the rain, to smile again
Awesomely changed, midst of the rain

Midst of the rain, so full of pain
Rescued my soul, love took control
Midst of the rain, to smile again
Awesomely changed, midst of the rain
