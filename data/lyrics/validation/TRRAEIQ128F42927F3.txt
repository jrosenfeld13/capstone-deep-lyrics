[Chorus]
If ya getting down, baby
I want it now, baby
Come and get it on, baby
I want it now, baby
(Say number 1)
(Say number 1)

[Verse 1]
I wanna take a little time to refresh your mind
Because the boys are back in town with a different kinda funk
Who's got the funk? We's got the funk, right
Everybody wanna boogie down tonight
Now throw your hands up in the sky
Move 'em round from side to side
I got what it takes, the beats that brace the funky bass
I'll give your body crazy shakes (come on)

[Pre-Chorus]
I heard somebody say (what?)
She's at the party so (huh)
I'm gonna get me some (ah)

[Chorus]
If ya getting down, baby
I want it now, baby
Come and get it on, baby
I want it now, baby
If ya getting down, baby
I want it now, baby
Move it all around, baby
I want it now, baby

[Verse 2]
Wiggi wiggi, I'm getting jiggy
Open up the door, I got the keys to your city
You're lookin' kinda pretty, dance 'til you drop
And it don't stop 'til it goes pop
Dance how you wanna dance
Let's all get down while we got the chance
I've still got 12 seconds on the clock that's mine
And I ain't gonna stop 'til the sun don't shine
Line after line, I flow like rhyme after rhyme
Just like time after time
Keep it up 'til you feel the heat
And get down once you feel the beat, uh, uh

[Pre-Chorus]
I heard somebody say (what?)
She's at the party so (huh)
I'm gonna get me some (ah)

[Chorus]
If ya getting down, baby
I want it now, baby
Come and get it on, baby
I want it now, baby
If ya getting down, baby
I want it now, baby
Move it all around, baby
I want it now, baby

[Interlude]
Hey you
Are you talking to me?
Show me your skill
I will show you my hand eye technique

[Verse 3]
There ain't no problem that we can't fix
'Cause we can do it in the mix
Now if your man gives you trouble, we'll be there on the double
Guaranteed we'll be hittin' for six, come on, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I heard somebody say (what?)
She's at the party so (huh)
I'm gonna get me some (ah)

[Chorus]
If ya getting down, baby
I want it now, baby
Come and get it on, baby
I want it now, baby
If ya getting down, baby
I want it now, baby
Move it all around, baby
I want it now, baby
If ya getting down, baby
I want it now, baby
Come and get it on, baby
I want it now, baby
If ya getting down, baby
I want it now, baby
Move it all around, baby
I want it now, baby
