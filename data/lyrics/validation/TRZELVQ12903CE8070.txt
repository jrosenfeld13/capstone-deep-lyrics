Angels wallow in this serene harbour
Takes my breath, this vivid scene, farther
Crystal kisses of the sun save me
Soul in bliss to be above

Be above, free above, found forever, this earth sever
Be above, free above, I'll be forever

Silver streams like ribbon entwine you
It's like a euphoric drug when it binds you
Lush with boundless treasures of love
The sky is graced by a lily white dove

Be above, free above, found forever, this earth sever
Be above, free above, I'll be forever

Not frightened by the beauty of the free above

Be above, free above, found forever, this earth sever
Be above, free above, I'll be forever above
Be above, free above, found forever, this earth sever
Be above, free above, I'll be forever above
Above, above, above
