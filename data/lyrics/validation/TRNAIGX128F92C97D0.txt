[Intro]
Its good to be back
Yall wont believe this tonight, see
Everybody think Hollywood is what you read, hear about
And its a drag, its rough out there
Cause see you got a lot of phonies out there
Everybody wanna be a star

Ay, Madlib
You a fool for this, Madlib

[Chorus]
Give me them dice
I dont roll snake eyes
I dont roll with fake dudes
I dont roll with fake guys
Gamble on ya boy, its a sure shot bet
Im the best of the vets
Im the best of in West
Give me them dice
I dont roll snake eyes
I dont roll with fake dudes
I dont roll with fake guys
Gamble on ya boy, its a sure shot bet
Im the best of the vets
Im the best of in West

[Verse I]
Defari [?], nickname Money Morten
In the seal grey Porsche and a Gucci bucket sportin
Venice Beach glasses looking like two hundred dollars
Ay, Im ghetto swap meet, but a well-known scholar
King told me, Cousin, just let the top drop
This summer when its hot, ay, were both gonna squat
Holla, holla, holla, like that dude on Chappelle
And no time, no era has Defari ever fell
Off like a light switch in the down position
I be spitin, I be shitin, any beat I be pissing on
I just devastate that yall piece of a hater
I can feed your horse mouth cuz I got a haymaker
I walk through the street like a tiger in the jungle
Keep all lose change, but prefer tight bundles
Of carrots that can fill up the Sepulveda Tunnel
OD from a keg, from a 40, or a funnel

[Chorus]
Give me them dice
I dont roll snake eyes
I dont roll with fake dudes
I dont roll with fake guys
Gamble on ya boy, its a sure shot bet
Im the best of the vets
Im the best of in West
Give me them dice
I dont roll snake eyes
I dont roll with fake dudes
I dont roll with fake guys
Gamble on ya boy, its a sure shot bet
Im the best of the vets
Im the best of in West

[Verse II]
Defari [?], nickname Nat Turner
On probation, had to get rid of the fat burner
But believe when Im off, Imma get him then I got him
I can jump better chump with a life threating problem
Mr. Defari, nickname thorough bread
Tell a chick take her time, give me thorough head
I blaze any stage, any crowd I amaze
Im a star, so in the sky dont have to gaze
Love being free, fuck countin the days
Soul brother to the grave, Frankie Beverly and Maze
I roll in the black like sharks roll in a packs
But I dont roll with cats that try to hold us back
Many, many flights, many tours, many nights
Still never drank Coors, still never snort white
I check cheese, cheese dont check me
Im a muthafuckin G for the Gs, ask [?]

[Chorus]
Give me them dice
I dont roll snake eyes
I dont roll with fake dudes
I dont roll with fake guys
Gamble on ya boy, its a sure shot bet
Im the best of the vets
Im the best of in West
Give me them dice
I dont roll snake eyes
I dont roll with fake dudes
I dont roll with fake guys
Gamble on ya boy, its a sure shot bet
Im the best of the vets
Im the best of in West

[Outro]
Up, so this is what yall wanted, huh?
That liquid shit, huh?
That liquid shit, huh?
Madlib

Liquid crew from the cradle to the grave, yeah
Big shots to all Dilated Peoples crew

Liquid Junkie crew
Ay, Swift, yeah boy, its what Im talking about
