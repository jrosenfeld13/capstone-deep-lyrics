Written By Lee Roy Parnell And Tony Arata

She's A Little More Than A Child Herself
Now With Children Of Her Own
All Her Living's Done For Someone Else
The Only Life She's Ever Known
All The Dreams And Desires That She Had
She Had To Put Them All On Hold
While Another Young Heart Became An Old Soul
The River Of Life Keeps Rushing By She Just Rolls With
The Flow She's Seen It All Through World-Weary Eyes
She Takes It Like It Comes And Goes And She's Forgotten
More About Life And Love Than Most Will Ever Know
While Another Young Heart Became An Old Soul
Laugh Too Little And You Cry Too Much Way Too Long
Without A Gentle Touch The Weight Of The World
Resting Down In Your Bones And Pretty Soon You've Got
An Old Soul Pretty Soon You've Got An Old Soul
You Laugh Too Little And Cry Too Much Way Too Long
Without That Gentle Touch The Weight Of The World
Resting Down In Your Bones Pretty Soon You've Got An
Old Soul Pretty Soon You've Got An Old Soul And God
Have Mercy On That Old Soul
