Helplessly held by the weeds, we are grown
I tried talking sense to you, leave it alone;
I give in to the weight of the kick
So weary of waiting and hoping for this
The two of us alone, no-one else to see
I promise not to miss you and no more jealousy

Careful of my gender, it comes, how it goes
Love me tender so nobody knows
Nobody knows the trouble I seen
Each time they asked, I said something obscene
The splinters shower down, I shelter from the rain
Against the grain, against the moon
I waxes and I wanes

No ecstasy sent for taking a line
Right through the stokehold they rip, run and shine;
I awake and the feeling won't drop
Each time they slam down, I swear I will stop
The two of us alone, no-else to see
The damage brings us closer to murder, can't you see?

Here in my rocking-horse house
I keep the curtains drawn;
Inside my little head
I hear them screaming out my name

Here in my rocking-horse room
I keep my eyes shut tight:
Inside my peeping-holes
I know that if they're empty I can sleep

Don't you believe her, deliver a shiver to me
Is this what you wanted?
I'm haunted, my eyes grown cold
I still got second sight
I still can see at night

Here comes the enemy, the beast in me
Alive a little more
On my hard shoulder
The warning goes deeper than before
I still got second sight
I still can see at night
