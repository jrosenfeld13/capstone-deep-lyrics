When you shook that fist
Did it feel like you were winning?
When you drew that blood
Did you think you'd take the blame?

If you spoke up now, would you tell without the lying?
Or are the answers laced with lies to hide your pain?

Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?
Happy now?

When you hate that much
Do you get in touch with your feelings?
Is there learning inside every broken bone?
Did it fire you up
Did you get things done in your reeling?
Or did your hapless heart lay sunken like a stone?

Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?
Happy now?
