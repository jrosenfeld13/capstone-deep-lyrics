I know you sat alone so many nights waiting for me
Cold, your face like a stone, I hang up the phone when we disagree
Standing there by my side when the fighting is done
Glaring at me in the light is my little toy gun

Shining in black like shoes on a rack with a trigger that's dressed up in gold
It's always warm inside my home but its handle is always so cold
Whispering into my ear, all the lies you spun
My single greatest fear is my little toy gun

....

Wait for the day when I can save face and come to a happy home
I know it's turning me to the count of girl who'd rather be alone
Just wait til I get my way -- I promise you it won't be fun
If you feel like you should pray, pray for my little toy gun
