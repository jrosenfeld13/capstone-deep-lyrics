He's just a man getting through life the best he can
He's a not a scientist, he programs a computer
Before that he sold cars to pay a student loan now he
Receives pity from his family - his friends say
How could he turn his back on reason worshipping a God
Finding truth through fear and mind control

He's just a man trying to explain
How he found the word of God could make life seem less insane
So he shares what he's read, what he understands
It makes sense to him, it makes perfect sense
He's never seen the world so clearly
Turned his back on free will - has he lost his mind?
He'd rather kneel down than take charge of his life
And he knows what people think, but it doesn't sway him
He can read the writings on the wall
'Cause he knows how people treat, how they treat each other
A sacrifice to benefit the all
Don't try to judge him, his theological ideals
His hopes may be false but his happiness is real
Don't try to judge him, he's just a man
