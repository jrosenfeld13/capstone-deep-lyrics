One place for my own
Another for anyone
You'd like to know
And when i get back home
And act like the king of Rome
It balances everything
Helps with the low
CHORUS
And I feel
Like a carnivore
But I do
Think you're pitiful
Both hands by my side
Take me for anything
So why did you hide?
And when I lay down low
And feel like I'm in control
It damages everything
You'd better go
CHORUS
And I feel
Like a carnivore
But I do
Think you're pitiful
BRIDGE x4
Get back home
And act like the king of Rome
It balances everything
Helps with the low
And when I lay down low
Feel like I'm in control
It damages everything
You'd better go
And I feel that you
Are on my side
This time
And I do believe
We're slow and down this time
Get back home
And act like the king of Rome
It balances everything
Helps with the low
