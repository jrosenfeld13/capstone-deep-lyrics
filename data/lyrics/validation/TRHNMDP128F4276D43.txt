[Chorus 1:]
Your grace and mercy brought me through
If it wasn't for Your love
Tell me what would I do?

Your blood redeemed me
Made me brand new
It was Your grace and mercy
That brought me through

[Verse 1:]
I know that I don't deserve
All the things that You've done
You keep blessing me over and over again

I once was lost deep in sin
'til I heard Your voice
Saying, "you're my child, come on in";
It was Your grace...

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2:]
You see, I'm not what I want to be
But I'm not what I used to be
Since He cleansed and made me whole

I've got to press towards the mark
For the prize of the high calling
Which is in Christ, Jesus
I cannot be left behind

[Bridge:]
('Cause everyday that I wake up) Your grace
(it's Your way of telling me) and mercy
(that You love me so) love me so

(And every thing that I give up) Your grace
(is my way of showing You) and mercy
(that You live in me and I've been set free)

[Chorus 1]
[Vamp 1:]
Your grace and mercy brought me
It brought me
It brought me
It brought me
It brought me

[Chorus 2:]
Your grace and mercy brought me through
If it wasn't for Your love
Tell me what would I do?

Grace, grace
Grace and mercy;
If it wasn't for Your love
Tell me what would I do?

Your grace and mercy brought me through
If it wasn't for Your love
Tell me what would I do?

[Vamp 2:]
Grace, grace
Grace and mercy

[Ending:]
If it wasn't for Your love
Tell me what would I do?
