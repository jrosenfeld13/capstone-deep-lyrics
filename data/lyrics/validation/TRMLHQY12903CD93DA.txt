You drink your coffee, and
I sip my tea and we're
Sitting here, playing so cool, thinking
"What will be, will be."

Well it's getting kind of late now
Oh I wonder if you'll stay now, stay now, stay now, stay now
Or will you just politely say "Goodnight"?

I move a little closer to you
Not knowing quite what to do and I'm
Feeling all fingers and thumbs
I spill my tea
Oh silly me!

Well it's getting kind of late now
I wonder if you'll stay now, stay now, stay now, stay now
Or will you just politely say "Goodnight"?

And then we touch
Much too much
This moment has been waiting for a long, long time
It makes me shiver
It makes me quiver
This moment I am so unsure
This moment I have waited for
Is it something you've been waiting for?
Waiting for too?

Take off your eyes
Bare your soul
Gather me to you
And make me whole
Tell me your secret
Sing me the song
Sing it to me in the silent tongue

Well it's getting kind of late now
I wonder if you'll stay now, stay now, stay now, stay now
Or will you just politely say "Goodnight"?
