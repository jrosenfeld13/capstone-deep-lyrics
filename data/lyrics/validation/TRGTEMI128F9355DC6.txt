You're amazing, you're the greatest
You're a real mr. wonderful
Always talking, always bragging
Such a real mr. know-it-all

You're so certain, you're so sure
That you are the best I would ever find
Oh, that's what you said
Trying to get me in bed
But I know your time

You're such a waste of time
Such a waste of time
You're such a waste of time
Such a waste of time

You're amazing, you're the greatest
You're a real mr. wonderful
Always talking, always bragging
Such a real mr. know-it-all

You're so certain, you're so sure
That you are the best I would ever find
Oh, that's what you said
Trying to get me in bed
But I know your time

You're such a waste of time
Such a waste of time
You're such a waste of time
Such a waste of time

You're such a waste of time
Such a waste of time
You're such a waste of time
Such a waste of time

You're such a waste of time
Such a waste of time
You're such a waste of time
Such a waste of time
