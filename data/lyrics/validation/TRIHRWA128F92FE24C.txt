Order my steps in Your word dear Lord
Lead me, guide me everyday
Send Your anointing, Father I pray;
Order my steps in Your word
Please, order my steps in Your word

Order my steps in Your word dear Lord
Lead me, guide me everyday
Send Your anointing, Father I pray;
Order my steps in Your word
Please, order my steps in Your word

Humbly, I ask Thee teach me Your will
While You are working, help me be still
'Cos Satan is busy, God is real;
Order my steps in Your word
Please, order my steps in Your word

Bridle my tongue let my words edify
Let the words of my mouth be acceptable in Thy sight
Take charge of my thoughts both day and night;
Order my steps in Your word
Please order my steps in Your word

[Chorus]
I want to walk worthy
According to Thy will
Please order my steps Lord
And I'll do Your blessed will
The world is ever changing
But You are still the same;
Please order my steps, Lord I'll praise Your name

Order my steps in Your word
Order my tongue in Your word
Guide my feet in Your word
Wash my heart in Your word
Show me how to walk in Your word
Show me how to talk in Your word
When I need a brand new song to sing
Show me how to let Your praises ring
In your word, in your word

Please order my steps in Your word
Please order my steps in Your word

[Chorus]
I want to walk worthy
According to Thy will
Please order my steps Lord
And I'll do Your blessed will
The world is ever changing
But You are still the same;
Please order my steps, Lord I'll praise Your name
I want to walk worthy
According to Thy will
Please order my steps Lord
And I'll do Your blessed will
The world is ever changing
But You are still the same;
Please order my steps, Lord I'll praise Your name

Please order my steps in Your word
Please order my steps in Your word
