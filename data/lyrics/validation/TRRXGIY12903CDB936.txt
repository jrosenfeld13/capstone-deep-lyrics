Where ever you go
What ever you do
I will be thinking of you
Whatever you are
Never so far
I will be there inside you
And just as the world keeps turning...
My love for you get's burning
Don't walk away, no, no no
Cause i got something i wanna say
Grown up...

You got a face, baby
I'm comming after you
Your gonna like, baby
All of the things that i do, too
Anything you want just stay dead
But don't you ever try to fake death
Don't walk away, no, no no
Cause i got something i wanna say
