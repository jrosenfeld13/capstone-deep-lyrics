I'd like my life to be simple
I need my life to be straight
I'd like to see my existence
Going great going great
Going great great great

I want my life to be easy
Need my life to be pure
I want to see my success is
Guaranteed that's for sure
That's for sure sure sure

Give me the simple life
The plain and the simple life
You've got to give me the simple life
The plain and the simple life

Don't want my life to be anxious
Don't need my life to be tense
I'd like to see my existence
Making sense making sense
Making sense sense sense

I'd like my life to be simple
Like my life to be plain
So don't you say that I ever
Live in vain live in vain
That's insane sane sane

Give me the simple life
The plain and the simple life
Give me the simple life
The plain and the simple

Give me the simple life
The plain and the simple life
Give me the simple life
The plain and the simple
