I love you and I'm not ashamed to say
How much I didn't want to walk away
I love you and won't hesitate to say
Before you break my heart I'll walk away
Now that you and lare here
There's some words that you should hear
In my heart I always knew
The love we shared was too good to be true
We had some real good times
Some bad times
Too
But now we've split because of things you do
I love you ond I'm not ashamed to say . . 
You want me back
That's plain to see
But for my lovin'
Or for my money
I'm telling you now
Boy
Your old ways must change
Or the split between us will remain the same
Why now do you come knocking on my door
Asking me what did we split for
You were my pride
You were my ioy
But all I was to you was your little toy
I miss you
Baby
I still want you
Too
Want to give my lovin'
All to you
But I'm no fool for you
You must treat me right
If you want the love I feel for you to stay tight
I love you and I'm not ashamed to say . . 
I love you and I'm not ashamed to say . 
Why now do you come knocking on my door . . 
I love you and I'm not ashamed to say . .
