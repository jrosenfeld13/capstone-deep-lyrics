Can't escape all your worries
Endless sorrow, pain and suffer
Can't escape your emotions
Enslavement by the world you choose
The struggle continues as the cries of pain
Peace can no longer rest in your mind
The world you choose is fucking already
So stop your dreaming and face reality
You work so hard, all for nothing
Your dreams are shattered, your goals destroyed
No-one listens to what we stand for
So why even try do you really care
The struggle continues as the cries of pain
Peace can no longer rest in your mind
The world you choose is fucking already
So stop your dreaming and face reality
