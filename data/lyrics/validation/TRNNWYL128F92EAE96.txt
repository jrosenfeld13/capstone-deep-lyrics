I look for a job both day and night
I can't find nothin' that will suit me right
A little bit of nerve I'm not tryin' to shake
But everything I've found seems too much like work

(Work work work)
What you're talkin' 'bout?
(Work work work)
Are you talkin' to me?

(Work work work)
Mmm, mmm
(Work work work)
Hey, hey, hey

Does anybody here know somebody
Who needs somebody who wants somebody to
(Love love love)
Now, you're talkin' now
(Love love love)

I need a little spendin' change every now and then
I ain't seen a quarter since who knows when
I ask my friends if they could spare a little cash
But all they ever do is stand around and talk trash about

(Work work work)
What you're talkin' 'bout?
(Work work work)
Are you talkin' to me?

(Work work work)
Mmm, mmm
(Work work work)
Hey, hey, hey

Does anybody here know somebody
Who needs somebody who wants somebody to
(Love love love)
Now, you're talkin' now
(Love love love)

Work work work
