When I kiss you
Do I kiss to deep?
When I kiss you
Can you breathe?
When I hold you
Do I hold too tight?
I feel so lonely
By your side
Don't you love me
Like you did before?
Don't you need me
Anymore?
I sense the distance
In your dark brown eyes
I sense no presence
In this fight

Are we stuck in the sand?
Baby give me your hand
I know that we'll get up again
Are we stuck in the sand?
Baby give me your hand
I know that we'll get on feet again

When I touch you
Am I too intense?
When I touch you
Why defence?
When I love you
Do I love too much?
When I need you
You just walk

Are we stuck in the sand?
Baby give me your hand
I know that we'll get up again
Are we stuck in the sand?
Baby give me your hand
I know that we'll get back on feet again

Are we stuck in the sand?
Baby give me your hand
I know that we'll get up again
Are we stuck in the sand?
Baby give me your hand
I know that we'll get up on feet again

I know
(Stuck in the sand)
I know
(Give me your hand)
I know
(I know that we can)
I know we'll get back on feet

(Stuck in the sand)
I know
(Give me your hand)
I know
(I know that we can)
I know we'll get back on feet again

I know, I know
We'll get back on feet again
Back on feet again
