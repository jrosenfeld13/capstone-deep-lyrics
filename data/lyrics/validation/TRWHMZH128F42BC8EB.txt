Ooohooohooo...
Ooohooohooo...

(Headin' for the islands)
We're ready, man, and packed to go
Ooohooohooo...

(When we hit those islands)
There's gonna be a big hello
Ooohooohooo...

Diggin' all the sunshine
It's easy not to say goodbye
Bye, bye
Bye

(Headin' for the islands)
Hey, yeah, we're really flyin' high
Ooohooohooo...
Ooohooohooo...

Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home, gotta go home

Ooohooohooo...
Ooohooohooo...

(Walkin' down the beaches)
Tomorrow mornin' we'll be there
Ooohooohooo...

(Golden sandy beaches)
Say, I can smell the breezy air
Ooohooohooo...

One more celebration
And then we're ready for goodbye
Bye, bye
Bye

(Walkin' down the beaches)
Hey, yeah, we're really flyin' high
Ooohooohooo...
Ooohooohooo...

Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home
Gotta go home, home, home, gotta go home

Ooohooohooo...
Ooohooohooo...
