You ain't gotta go home but you can't stay here
I hear what you're saying, buddy, you're coming in clear
I've had too much and you've had enough of me

Well being asked to leave and being shown the door
Ain't nowhere I ain't never been before
Just one more thing I wanna say before I get up and leave

I been thrown out of better places than this
I know where to go and I know what to kiss
I've heard it all before from my sweet angel's lips
In that little piece of heaven where I used to live
Now there's a place that a man could miss
I've been thrown out of better places than this

Keep your old cold shoulder and your lukewarm beer
Yeah, I've seen enough, I'm outta here
Pour me just one more and I'll be on my way
I'm dreaming of perfume she wore in her hair
And all you got is stale cigarette smoke hanging in the air
So Adios, au revoir, manyana
Whatever they say

I been thrown out of better places than this
I know where to go and I know what to kiss
I've heard it all before from my sweet angel's lips
In that little piece of heaven where I used to live
Now there's a place that a man could miss
I've been thrown out of better places than this

I haven't lost anything here I can't live without
Can't you see everything's already gone
That I've ever cared about

I been thrown out of better places than this
I know where to go and I know what to kiss
I've heard it all before from my sweet angel's lips
In that little piece of heaven where I used to live
Now there's a place that a man could miss
I've been thrown out of better places than this

Yeah, I'm leaving, get your hands offa me
Yeah, I know where the doors at
Y'all might wanna clean this place up a little bit
