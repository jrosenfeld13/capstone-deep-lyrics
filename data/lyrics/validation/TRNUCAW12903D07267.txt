[Brian East]

Convictions fixed in one's mind, fanatics
Trained for self sacrifice
The doctrine of those without hope, deceived
In their vision to sanctify the world
The voice of the just shall be heard
Distorted, misshapen and bastardized
Unleashed to those as a fear, sent forth
As a message for nations all to hear

[Chorus:]
Behind the guise looms a twisted mind
Bent on annihilation, violence, breeds, violence
Winds of war, blinded eyes, sacrifice
The age of innocence
Terror strikes sky and seas by surprise
The age of innocence dies

[2nd Verse:]
Captives taken by swords, induced by the faith
Of the blind, the wrath of their anger so cruel
Pray to the claim of the just and right
A tactic to seize and to hold, sentenced
To age of command
Demands of those that are capt, delivered
Unto us, a new media event

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
So many cry from their graves
Innocence taken by the blade

[Lead Break]

[Chorus]
Slay them all, young and old, hostage cries
The age of innocence dies
