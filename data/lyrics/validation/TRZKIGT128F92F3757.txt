You live your life like its a movie screen
You're putting on a show
Melodramatic and exaggerated
I can do without
So insincere
And so self serving, baby
I can see it clear
You're the center of it all
I'll be here to remind you that
You ain't no tortured soul
And I'll be there to remind you
You ain't a loser with a heart of gold
One minute you can be the victim, man
Then you're the leading role
An action here or the comic relief
Your talents know no bounds
So insincere
But you act so caring baby
We can see if clear
You're not fooling anyone
I'll be here to remind you that
You ain't no tortured soul
And I'll be there to remind you
You ain't a loser with a heart of gold
It seems like all my life I've been dealing with shams like you
I don't know if I'm just too trusting or a magnet for you fools
Don't think you got away with it cuz I see you for the truth
And I'm wiser now because of you while, you, you're still just you
I'll be here to remind you that
You ain't no tortured soul
And I'll be there to remind you
You ain't a loser with a heart of gold
