I've something to say
I saw you today in my binoculars
You smiled and then you looked away
Now I want you to look up, way up
What do you see?
There's a star
A star in the sky for you and me, baby
And it's falling in the ocean
And it's falling in the sea
And we are
Swim, swim, swim

Star so bright, a comet is ice and fire
An ocean in space burning way up high
Swim the sky
Now listen and I'll tell you it's 1000 degrees
The world is burning up
The world is hurling through space
The world is on fire

Oh, I've been waiting for you all my life
I've been watching for you all my life
To fall like a star
To shine from the ocean
We'll take our binoculars and spin out
We'll burn like satellites tonight
We are everywhere tonight
Swim, swim, swim

The world is burning up
The world is hurling through space
The world is on fire
We burn from the inside out
See our light
We are everywhere tonight
Swim, swim, swim
