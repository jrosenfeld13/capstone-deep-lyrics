All aboard

Hi there pal, whatcha say?
Step aside partner, it's my day
Lend an ear and listen to my version
Of a really crazy Tennessee excursion

Pardon me boy
Is that the Chattanooga Choo-Choo?
Track twenty-nine
Boy, you can give me a shine

Can you afford
To board the Chattanooga Choo-Choo?
I've got my fair
And just a trifle to spare

You'll leave that Pennsylvania station 'bout a quarter to four
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner in a diner, nothing could be finer
And a-have your ham and eggs in Caroliner

When you hear the whistle blowing eight to the bar
Then you know that Tennessee is not very far
Shuffle all the coal in
Gotta keep a-rollin'
Whoo whoo Chattanooga there you are

There's gonna be
A certain party at the station
Satin and lace
I used to call funny face

She's gonna cry
Until I tell her that I'll never roam
So Chattanooga Choo-Choo
Won't you choo choo me home?

So Chattanooga Choo-Choo
Won't you choo choo me home?
(Chattanooga, Chattanooga)
(Chattanooga, Chattanooga)

Chattanooga Choo-Choo
Won't you choo choo me home?
(Chattanooga, Chattanooga)
(Chattanooga, Chattanooga)
