[Verse 1]
Brothers and sisters, put this record down
Take my advice 'cause we are bad news
We will leave you high and dry
It's not worth the hearing you'll lose

[Pre-Chorus]
It's just past 8 and I'm feeling young and reckless
The ribbon on my wrist says, "Do not open before Christmas."

[Chorus]
We're only liars but we're the best (we're the best)
We're only good for the latest trends
We're only good 'cause you can have almost famous friends
Besides, we've got such good fashion sense

[Verse 2]
Brothers and sisters, yeah, put these words down
Into your notebook
(Spit lines like these)
We're friends when you're on your knees
Make them dance like we were shooting their feet

[Pre-Chorus]
It's just past 8 and I'm feeling young and reckless
The ribbon on my wrist says, "Do not open before Christmas."

[Chorus]
We're only liars but we're the best (we're the best)
We're only good for the latest trends
We're only good 'cause you can have almost famous friends
Besides, we've got such good fashion sense

[Bridge]
We're only liars but we're the best
We're only good for the latest trends

[Chorus]
We're only liars but we're the best
We're only good for the latest trends
We're only good 'cause you can have almost famous friends
Besides, we've got such good fashion sense
