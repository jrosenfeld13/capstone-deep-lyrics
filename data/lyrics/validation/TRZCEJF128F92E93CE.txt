Get ahead, fall behind
Thats the deal, nevermind
Try to win, never can
Its because of the real estate man

March in time, stand in line
Yeah buddy, thats the crime
Try to live, never can
Its because of the bureaucrat man

Feel the teeth, in your neck
Bloodsuckers at your back
Suit and tie, and a six-month plan
The disguise of the real estate man

Worthless money, thats the scam
Slave to your desk, slave to the man
Counterfeit if you can
To destroy, the real estate man
