[Verse One]
I'm kneeling in front of the altar
Satan's cross upon the wall
Strange emptiness, a crystal ball between two candles
Melissa has entered another life

[Chorus]
Melissa, you were mine
Melissa, you were the light

[Bridge]
She was a witch
Why did they take you away?

[Chorus]
Melissa, you were the queen of the night
Melissa, you were my light

[Interlude]
I swear revenge on the priest
The priest must die
He must die in the name of Hell

[Outro]
Melissa, can you hear me?
Melissa, are you there?
Nothing is left outside at the stake

They take the hurt
Away from me
I think Melissa's still with us
