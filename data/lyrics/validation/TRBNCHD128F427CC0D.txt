Oh
Oh, my love
Oh, my love
Oh, my love, my darling (oh, my love)
I've hungered for your touch (oh, my love)
A long, lonely time (oh, my love)

(Need your love) Time goes by so slowly (need your love)
And time can do so much (need your love)
Are you still mine?

I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me (my love)

Oh, my love
Lonely rivers flow (river flow, river flow)
To the sea, (to the sea, to the sea, to the sea) to the sea
To the open arms of the sea (the sea, the sea, the sea)
Lonely rivers sigh (rivers sigh, rivers sigh)
"Wait for me, (wait for me, wait for me, wait for me) wait for me
I'll be coming home, wait for me"

My love
Oh, my love
Oh, my love
My love
