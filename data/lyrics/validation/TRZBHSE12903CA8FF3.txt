It feels like yesterday
When I was told a little tale
About a broken road
A tale of fortune and of fame

There was a time
When a man couldn't find his kind
There was a rhyme
Which made a man make up his mind

In those lines I heard you say
Fare well on your way
There every root and stone and wishing well
Has a tale to tell

The air that I breathe
Is made of dreams and memories
Of past and future days
And countless new pathways

When I look behind
I see my footprints on the road
Those remind of the time
When your haven always welcomed me

In those lines I heard you say
Fare well on your way
And when the broken road turns home again
There's a tale to tell
