Keeping me away from elevation! Upset
Keeping me away from elevation! Upset

Keeping me away from elevation!
For something I dont wanna ring the bell for
Wont you let me stand at the top
You wanna keep me upset, yeah!

I wake up this morning like another day
Scarring pictures in my head as long as I go this way
Isolating me into a fake death
Isolating me into a fake death

People asking me about this place
Theyve never been before
The implications
Of my dark visions
Have never been told

Why do we always try to change our damn personality?
This solution always contributes
To fucking ease the pain

Keeping me away from elevation
For something I dont wanna ring the bell for
Wont you let me stand at the top
You wanna keep me upset

Keeping me away
Keeping me, from elevation, away
Away, keeping me away
Keeping me, from elevation, away
Away, Yeah! Why?

Im forced to see your face every fucking day
Even going blind would not be the better way
I feel like becoming a time bomb
I feel like puking all the time
Im going down

Why do we always try to change our damn motherfucking fate?
Theres no solution as long as we dont take a look in the mirror

People asking me about this place
Theyve never been before
The implications
Of my dark visions
Have never been told

Keeping me away
Keeping me, from elevation, away
Keeping me away
Keeping me, from elevation, away

I woke up this morning like another day
Scary pictures in my head as long as I go this way
Isolating me into a fake death
Isolating me into this fake death! Why?

Keeping me away
Keeping me, from elevation, away
Keeping me away
Keeping me, from elevation, away

Told. It has never been told. Told
I never told
I never told anybody
