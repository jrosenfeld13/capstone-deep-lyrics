Don't feed me any of your shit
Not gonna buy any of it
Won't get fat with all your lies
Your happy package was just a disguise
Don't want your product or your views
At least the cynics never lose
Can't get diseased, cause they're immune
To gilded far-fetched cartoons

I don't like what I see
I've had my taste test
And I don't like it
I can't believe it took this long
To make you transparent
I don't like it

I've got an anorexic mind
Don't feed me any of your shit

Say I'm just a wimp
I won't take what you're dishing out
Bulimic gut, bulimic mind
I'll chew you up and spit you out
Don't want any of your lies
You've got your pills to pass the time
Too bad I spoiled all the fun
Your days of gluttony are done
