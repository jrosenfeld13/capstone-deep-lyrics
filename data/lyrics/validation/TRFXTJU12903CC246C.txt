I'd paint your hair crimson red
And your eyes blue instead
If I could I'd draw a heart for you
Fix it in between the essence of my hands
Illuminate the arteries until you understand
I'd paint your hair crimson red
The end of this halo on your head
And your eyes
So hold me close tonight
And take me with you when you leave
We'll watch the pieces falling closely into place
I'll make you believe
And if I could see the world in different colors
I'd read it in the air as signals send them through
But every one is just a different shade of you
I'd paint your hair crimson red
The end of this halo on your head
And your eyes
So hold me close tonight
