Caught out running
With just a little too much to hide
Maybe, baby
Everything's gonna turn out fine

Please read the letter
I nailed it to your door
It's crazy how it all turned out
We needed so much more

Too late, too late
A fool could read the signs
Maybe, baby
You'd better check between the lines

Please read the letter
I wrote it in my sleep
With help and consultation from
The angels of the deep

Ah, ahah, ahah
Please read the letter that I wrote
Please read the letter that I wrote

Once I stood beside
A well of many words
My house was full of rings and
Charms and pretty birds

Please understand me
My walls came falling down
There's nothing here that's left for you
But check with lost and found

Ah, ahah, ahah
Please read the letter that I wrote
Please read the letter that I wrote
Please read the letter that I wrote
Oh

One more song
Just before we go
Remember, baby
You gotta reap just what you sow

Please read my letter
And promise me you'll keep
The secrets and the memories
We cherish in the deep

Please read the letter
I nailed it to your door
It's crazy how it all turned out
We needed so much more

Please read the letter that I wrote
Please read the letter that I wrote
Please read the letter that I wrote
Please read the letter that I wrote
Oh, oh, oh

Please read the letter
Please read the letter
Please read the letter
Oh, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
