I tried to tell you
There's something dead in me
Love lies in moments
Still I cannot grasp one fragment
I can tell you nothing
Answers don't exist
Floors, walls my own asylum
Shades my eyes from all of this

And i kill the one that you loved
Soiled, shaded
But the knife will cut the same skin
Now i still grasp my heart
I can't graze the sadness surface
I'm so tired

I tried to feel it
Guilt wouldn't come to me
Blood soiled pillows
Sheets writhing in agony
I tried to make you feel it
You just wouldn't heal
Skin cold ends the nightmare
Sun seems brighter than before

And i kill the one you loved
Soiled, shaded
But the knife will cut the same skin
Now i still grasp my heart
I can't graze the sadness surface
I'm so tired

Talk shit
It seems to go with you fine
Living up to it when i lie
Can't stand to stare with these dead
Eyes
Turning in the badge cause you can't
Sell the image
Living with another god
He'll tell you he's mine
So you know i don't like you
Still i think you're the best

You can't find the day
So when should i take the bare
Beatings
When i'm alone
See if i can find it
Take it away all the pain cause i'm
Sorry
Can't feel any worse but i'm sure i will
Seems like no one cares but it's all
Right
Find another way
Your savior suits you
