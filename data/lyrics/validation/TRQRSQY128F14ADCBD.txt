Take your time, your on your own
And I'll be watching you as you sleep late tonight
The feeling's only natural
To defile something that is beautiful

Creep in my mind to control now
Feel their power grip, moral slip
As we let go now
Setting traps, regret, mark get set
As time marches on

Cleansing day
Wash your hands from wrong investments that were made
But rivers flow from high to low
And I can feel the elevation
Drop below

Fall in my arms to control now
Feel a downward grip, moral slip
As we let go now
Setting traps, regret, mark get set
As time marches on

We will raid
We will see
We will do
We all fall down
And we all fall down
And as time marches on

Take my thoughts now
Take my thoughts now
Take all my thoughts and control them I say

Bare me intent
To control now
Give me joy of light
Why wouldn't I?

As we let go now
Traps instead with death
Pleasures sent
As time marches on
I will raid
I will see
I will be
They all fall down
And they all fall down
And they all fall down
