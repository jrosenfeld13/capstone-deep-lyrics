Just once I'd like to feel like you were listening to what I say
But this is the last day
I can feel the waste when you walk by me
You lie on the couch and look right past me
I'm ready to find a home. I'm ready to find some place that feels like home
I can see the fragments falling off you
Young man, I only want to help you. And I can, but you still have to act so
Suspicious. Give up the lies! There's more to life than clinging to the very
Thing that's killing you and while you refuse, you're looking older by the day
But this will be the last day
This is the last day that turns to night
This is the last day that turns to night for me
Give up the lies. There's more to life
