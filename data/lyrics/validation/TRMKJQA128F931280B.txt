Vagabond haze
You get lost when you find hope in a feeling
You've been estranged
You've been a far away child
All you need is four little problems solved
Where you go they follow
Slow the breathing first and burn the lock
Get that action
Can't you see?
Throw the ashes on my shore
I'll return in time
I know your noises
I know you're always in love
You talk him up
You can't afford what you take
I know your noises
What's sent from above divides you up
You become hard to believe
A teenage parade
See how the vanity puts a claim on your freedom
Ain't it a shame?
You're such a far away child
All I hear is four little problems still
Where you go, they follow
Slow the breathing first and burn the lock
Get that action
Can't you see?
Throw the ashes on my shore
I'll return in time
I know your noises
I know you're always in love
You talk him up
You can't afford what you take
I know your noises
What's sent from above divides you up
You become hard to believe
