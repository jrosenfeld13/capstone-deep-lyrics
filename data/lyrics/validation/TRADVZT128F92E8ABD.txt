Anything you want
Anything the world has to offer
I can give you
If you just reach out to me

Take my hand
Everything a kiss cannot bring
I will give you
If you just say you will

And it's freedom in my arms
And it's freedom in my arms
In my arms
In my arms
In my arms, yeah

Anything you want
Anything this world has to offer
I can give you, yeah
All this world and it's glory

And it's sin
I will give it all to you
Take my hand
If you just say you will

And it's freedom in my arms
Lord, it's freedom in my
In my arms
In my arms
In my arms

Anything you want, it's in my arms
Anything you need, it's in my arms
Anything you want, it's in my arms
Anything you need, it's in

In my arms
In my arms
In my arms

Anything you want, it's in my arms
Anything you need, it's in my arms
Anything you want, it's in my arms

In my arms
In my arms
In my arms
