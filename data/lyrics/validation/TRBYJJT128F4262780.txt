I won't hold..hold my breath in hope for silhouettes..
I still do..
I don't know you
You waste your life on worthless games
I owe you nothing if only it were true..
I don't know you
Keep thinking the madness will undo
The reason for being
I know the choice is up to you
..a million miles away
Still fighting memories, the war inside my head
A million miles can't be explained
It's not up to me to make this end
I won't hold my breath again
I'm lost for words that can't be won
Look at what you've done
..and still do
I don't know you
You're so fake, just make this end because I can't understand a single thing
Make this end
A million miles can't be explained because we'll never be the same
