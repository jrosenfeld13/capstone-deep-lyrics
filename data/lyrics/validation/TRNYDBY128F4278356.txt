Oh
Turn me loose, turn me loose I say
This is the first time I ever felt this way
I'm gonna get a thousand kicks
I'm gonna kiss a thousand chicks
So turn a me loose

Turn me loose, turn me loose I say
Gonna rock 'n' roll as long as the band's gonna play
Gonna holler, gonna shout, gonna knock myself right out
So turn me loose, ooh yeah

I got some, change in my pocket uh eh, I'm rarin' to go
I'm takin' some chick-a to the picture show
And when I, see her home and then we, kiss goodnight
She'll turn me loose, turn me loose, turn me loose, turn me loose

Turn me loose, turn me loose I say
Yes today is gonna, be the day
I want ya to all understand baby that now I am a man
So turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose, listen

I got some, change in my pocket that uh eh huh I'm rarin' to go
I'm takin' some chick-a to the picture show
And when I, see her home and we, kiss goodnight
Well, turn me loose, turn me loose, Owwwwwwwwwwwwaaa

Turn me loose, turn me loose I say
I'm gonna rock 'n' roll as long as the band's gonna play
I'm gonna holler, gonna shout, gonna knock myself right out
So turn me loose
Turn me loose
Ah ooooooohh
