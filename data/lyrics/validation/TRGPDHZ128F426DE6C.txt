Everything is crashing down on my head over and over again
When the devil came knocking at your front door step
You never should have let her in
But you did and now you're sad
Do, do, do...
So you did, but you're not dead
Do, do, do...
There was a time where I'd drive a million miles
To hear your heartbeat
But your colors changed
Today I'm gonna walk the sand
Just to see your cold heart sink
So I did and I'm so glad
(Do, do, do...)
So I did, and your now dead
(Do, do, do...)
As the cold steel releases
Part of me
I hope your cold heart will stop this beat I'm remembering
As the cold steel releases
I hope your cold will stop this pain
I'm remembering this agreement used to be here
So I did, and now you're sad
(Do, do, do...)
And I did, but your not dead
(Do, do, do...)
So I did and I'm so glad
(Do, do, do...)
So I did, and now your dead
(Do, do, do...)
We-- We all, we all belong down here
