(Percy Mayfield/Charles Morris)

I've often been told that time bring 'bout a change
I've often been told that time bring 'bout a change
Yes I've had two years of torture and my heart still feel the same

I had a real fine woman, fine as she could be
Let me tell ya, I had a real, real fine woman, fine as she could be
But the syndicators, back-biters stole that little girl away from me

(Sax/Piano)

Two years of being without her, seven hundred and thirty days
And I still remember her little brown body and the sweet love baby way

Two years of torture and I'm still in misery
Oh, but I'm doomed as a lover unless she come back to me
