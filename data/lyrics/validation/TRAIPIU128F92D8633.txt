[Verse 1]
So glad to be back home, be back home
So glad to be back home, be back home
I can't stay too long, be back home
So glad to be back home, be back home

[Verse 2]
The winter hits so hard hits so hard
The winter hits so hard hits so hard
Every little part hits so hard
Loving to hit so hard, hits so hard

[Refrain](x4)
So glad to be back home, be back home
