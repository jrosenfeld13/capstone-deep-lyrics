We'll give you complete creative control...

Conformity is tainted
By the mark of mediocrity
I never want to be a statistic
Another life unmade and put it to the ground

I will live forever
I refuse to fade away into the nether
I don't wait for heaven
I will leave my mark right here on earth instead

Don't bother with the jilted
I cast my ripples in eternity
Prepare to count me more than once
As I echo on in future minds

I will be forever
I refuse to fade away into the nether
I don't wait for heaven
I will live my life right here on earth instead

So many under the sun
So many under the gun
But I've only just begun
A million miles till I'm done
A million miles till I'm done

I will live forever
I refuse to fade away into the nether
I don't wait for heaven
I will leave my mark right here on earth instead

I will be forever
I refuse to fade away into the nether
I don't wait for heaven
I will live my life right here on earth instead

So many under the sun
So many under the gun
But I've only just begun
A million miles till I'm done

So many under the sun
So many under the gun
But I've only just begun
A million miles till I'm done
A million miles till I'm done
