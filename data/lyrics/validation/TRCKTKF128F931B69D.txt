[Intro]
With our hands up high
We're screaming
Whoa whoa oh
Whoa whoa oh

[Verse 1: Aaron Gillespie]
I'm not afraid to make big mistakes
I'm not afraid to fall flat on my face
I need to get this looked at
Need to get this looked at
I need some time to think about
What I've done

One last thing before I go

[Chorus]
With our hands up high
We're screaming
Whoa whoa oh
Whoa whoa oh
And with our feet
We stomp a cadence for you

[Verse 2: Aaron Gillespie]
It's all free and that's real
It's all free, you said
I need to accept
I need to forget I guess

I'm glad I got this looked at
Finally got this looked at
I'm so glad you came for me

Get this, get this right before we go

[Chorus] x2

[Bridge]
I am the one who needs you
I am the one who needs you
I am the one who needs you

[Chorus] x2
