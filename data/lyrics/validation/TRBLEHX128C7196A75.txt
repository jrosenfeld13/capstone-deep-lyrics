BARRY:
Nobody knew who he really was
But they called him Mambo when he played
KID CREOLE:
He became the King
King of Latin Swing

And oh, the music that he made
Hey Mambo
Did your mama teach you that
Hey Mambo
Did she know what she begat
KID CREOLE:
They used to come in their fancy threads
And he always turned them inside out
BARRY:
They would jam the floor
BOTH:
They would beg for more
BARRY:
And when they got it they would shout
BOTH:
Hey Mambo
Did your mama teach you that
Hey Mambo
Did she know what she begat

Take it away
Do it again
Hey Mambo
