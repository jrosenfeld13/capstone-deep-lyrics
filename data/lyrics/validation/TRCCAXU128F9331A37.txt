Did you find what you're looking for?
Dinner for three up on the stove
It's alright, we'll leave it all alone
And it was nice, we'll miss you, now off you go

Her little head is off to sleep
Poor little girl, she looks just like me
It's alright, we'll leave it all alone
And it was nice, we'll miss you, now off you go

It's alright, we'll leave it all alone
And it was nice, we'll miss you, now off you go
