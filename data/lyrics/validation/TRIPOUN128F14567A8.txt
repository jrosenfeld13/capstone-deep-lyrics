The tour bus passed here yesterday
Exciting all the fools who pay
To see the naked lady in our yard

The hang out gang is back in town
Rumor has it going 'round they brought back
Four new groupies and a St. Bernard

We're peaceful and abiding cats some call Gypsies
Some call brats but bare feet don't tear streets up like their bus

Chorus:
All we was doing' was a hangin' and little Koochie was sangin'
Mama I'm guilty of a hangin' out
I know it's a shabby old building but after all ain't we God's children
And Lord it's a good place for hangin' out

The fast approachin' local heat was poundin' out the southwest beat
When they came upon Koochie in our yard
She smiled sir I meant no harm just a little suntan on my arm
They wound up takin' in our St. Bernard
It didn't have a tag y'all

Chorus:
All we was doing' was a hangin' and little Koochie was sangin'
Mama I'm guilty of a hangin' out
I know it's a shabby old building but after all ain't we God's children
And Lord it's a good place for hangin' out

Now you hang with me and I'll hang with you and we'll hang out
'Til we both turn blue mama I'm guilty of a hangin' out

Chorus:
All we was doing' was a hangin' and little Koochie kept sangin'
Mama I'm guilty of a hangin' out
I know it's a shabby old building but after all ain't we God's children
And Lord it's a good place for hangin' out

All we was doin' was a hangin' and little Koochie kept sangin'
Mama I'm guilty of a hangin' out

(Spoken)
"Yeah, they moved up there about a month ago
Fixed up that little cabin on the ridge
They really them long hairs?
Well, Homer seen 'em. Homer seen how long it was
Still reckon I seen it. They a bunch of weirdos
One of them had a little instrument looked like a mandolin
Why Lord, they might freeze to death up there this winter
Well. Homer, turn that radio down."
