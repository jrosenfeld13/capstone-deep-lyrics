Fallen Angel, I want your flesh
Fallen Angel, I need your flesh

There's a weight from deep within
The blood on my lips, it tastes like sin
I like your pale skin, I close your eyes
Nothing to see in this world of lies

You were so beautiful but not mine
But on this night it was no crime
To show you my world, and so you can see
I love you when you're dead, it's no difference to me
