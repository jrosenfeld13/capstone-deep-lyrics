Some people are saying that time will take care of people like me
That I'm livin' too fast and they say I can't last much longer
But little they see that their thoughts of me is my savior
And they really should know that the beat oughta go just a little faster
So pick up the tempo just a little and take it on home
The singer ain't singin' and the drummer's been draggin' too long
Time'll take care of itself, so just leave time alone
And pick up the tempo just a little and take it on home
Well, I'm wild and I'm mean, I'm creatin' a scene, I'm goin' crazy
Well, I'm good and I'm bad and I'm happy and sad and I'm lazy
I'm quiet and I'm loud, I'm gatherin' a crowd and I like gravy
About half off the wall but I learned it all in the navy
So pick up the tempo just a little and take it on home
The singer ain't singin' and the drummer's been draggin' too long
Time'll take care of itself, so just leave time alone
And pick up the tempo just a little and take it on home
Yeah, pick up the tempo just a little and take it on home
