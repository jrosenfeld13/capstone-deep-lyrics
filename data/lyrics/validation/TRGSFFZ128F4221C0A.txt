Will you ever know Jeff
How much I'm glad you're here
Though the second half's long gone
The better will be shifting in new gears
Should we hit the lane
East coast runs through our veins
Still the rhythm plays
No weaker than the promise of last May

(Chorus)
We can gig all night
We can jam on riffs that no one claimed
And underneath the golden grain
The timbre drives me sane

John I love the sounds you make
Feels good with the licks we play
To the shake in the rhythm of the Rue
Hard pressed to find a better you
It goes on with the songs we sing
Seven years and we still believe
We'll drown in this desert sea
Western Tread is the label that pays me

(Chorus)
