Her dress was dark and clean
And how did you get here
You twist all over me
Like you were caught in the wind
And we were cold callin'

Oh Evangeline
Oh Evangeline

Imagine you and me
Following orders
Lights on a frozen sea
North of the border
And I heard their guns callin', hey

Oh Evangeline
Oh Evangeline
Say what you mean
Come back to me
Say what you mean

Oh Evangeline
Oh Evangeline

We hardly knew summer
And it goes to show
We hardly knew each other
And it goes to show

Oh Evangeline
Oh Evangeline
Oh Evangeline
Oh Evangeline
