We built this town
Bitter lips like cigarettes
Given all she's got to give
I'm feeling worse cause its
Never enough
Broken hands can only give so much
Wanting trying I hate this city
I hate this city to death
Living loving I hate this city
Hate this city to death
Can't you feel the heat of this city?
I hate this city
Don't you miss it?
I hate this city hate hate this city to death
I love it, early morning, missing the sound of
A railroad next door
These cold streets, rush by me in a cadence of
Cold glass and blur
The skyline sings, the asphalt screams
So glad I'm home
I really hate this city
