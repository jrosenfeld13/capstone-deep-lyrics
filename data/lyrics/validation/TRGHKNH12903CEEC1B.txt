Hello, hello, yes may I speak to Jewell
Oh no this is not Yolanda darling
You may not know who I am
But the name is Shirley
Miss Brown to you
You see I am the originator of the message
You're trying to bring
And I wanna tell you and Yolanda
A thing or two about my man
You see ain't no need for you girls
Sweating each other about somebody that don't belong
To either one of you
You see he's still mine
Always has been, always will be
Until the end of time
Yeah I heard you bragging about that beat up Volkswagon
I saw you riding in
Girl please, I'm pushing a Mercedes Benz
And I heard you talking about the little stuff you know what he likes
And the food he eats
I don't think so darling
You see because I give my man
A full course meal every night
Something to fill him up and satisfy his appetite
And I can see why you and Yolanda ain't got no man
Y'all too busy playing star 6 9 games
And it really don't make much difference
How you takin this
I just want you to remember one thing
Woman to woman
You ain't woman enough to take my man
Now you check this out

You're wasting your time
Girl if you think that I would ever be so weak
To let you steal my man from me
You see I ain't got no doubt
About my opposition
And girl let me tell you
You ain't even no competition
You see there's a difference
Between a girl and a woman
And there's just one thing
I want you to understand

Oh you ain't woman enough
You ain't woman enough
You just ain't woman enough
Hey little girl
To take my man
You ain't woman enough
No you ain't
You ain't woman enough
No no no no no no
Just ain't woman enough
Hey to take my man

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

When it comes to my mans
Needs and desires
It ain't no way you would ever qualify
You're just too young girl
And you ain't got a clue
Girl you could never
Stand in my shoes
Cause you could never please him
The way that I do
There's just one thing
I want you to understand yeah

You ain't woman enough
You just ain't woman enough
You ain't woman enough
No you ain't, you could never take my man
No no no no no no

Your eyes may shine
And your teeth may grin oh
But let me tell you, my man's love
You're never gonna get it oh oh
And there's just one thing
I want you to understand yeah

You see you ain't woman enough
No you ain't woman
You ain't woman enough
You can't do it all
You see there's a difference
Between a girl and a woman
See I know what he like, when he likes it
And how long he likes it
You could never take him
No no no no no no no no no
You ain't woman enough
You can't do it
See you ain't got the power
And you ain't got the skill
You could never love him no
