Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Have you ever woke up in the morning?
Everything is dark and
I don't feel like rising
Can't face another day unfolding
Out of dreams into routines
Why can't it be easy to start a new day
Why does it always feel the same?
How can it get hard in a beautiful day
Nothing is gonna change
So I'm just gonna stay

In my bed
Feeling fed up
Pull the sheets over my head
Take no calls
Fuck it all
Had enough of standing tall
Daytime TV
Home delivery
I'm gonna hide away
Nobody's gonna find me
Nobody can find me
In my bed
(In my bed)
Nobody can find me
In my bed

Can't believe the kind of world
We're living in
Wanna go on a talk show
Tell everybody where you've been
Kinda makes me think of
How it coulda been
So now I'm counting my blessings

Maybe my life isn't as bad as it seems
Maybe I'll never know what it all means
Maybe tomorrow is bringing a change
But until then
I'm just gonna stay here

In my bed
Feeling fed up
Pull the sheets over my head
Take no calls
Fuck it all
Had enough of standing tall
Daytime TV
Home delivery
I'm gonna hide away
Nobody's gonna find me
Nobody can find me
In my bed
(In my bed)
Nobody can find me
In my bed

Don't wanna see nobody, no
(I wanna be alone)
I wanna be alone

What can I do
To improve how I'm feeling
Gotta release all the tension
I'm needing
Tossing and turning
I stare at the ceiling
