You and I
Since you've gone all the flowers have died
You and I
We've been drifting apart for some time

How could I survive
In this world full of cocaine and lies?
'Cause every day away feels like
I've gone a thousand miles and have to go a thousand more
It's like a slow death in my soul
I feel while falling into space now darker than before
What ever happened to those simple days?

You and I
From a distance we're just shapes and lines
You and I
Pictures filling with holes in our minds

What can I do?
Change the tides so they bring me to you?
And every day away feels like
I've gone a thousand miles and have to go a thousand more
It's like a slow death in my soul

I feel while falling into space now darker than before
What ever happened to those simple days?

You and I
Disconnected and falling apart
Crucified
By the hand that keeps squeezing my heart

How could I survive
In this world full of cocaine and lies
And every day away feels like
I've gone a thousand miles and have to go a thousand more
It's like a slow death in my soul
I feel while falling into space now darker than before

A thousand miles, a thousand miles, I go a thousand more
What ever happened to those simple days?
I sure miss those good ol' simple days
I sure miss the world before it changed
