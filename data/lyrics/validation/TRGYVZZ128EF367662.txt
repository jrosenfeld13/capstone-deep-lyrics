I broke at the seams, I'm falling apart
You want to hang on so I'm letting you go
You can come back when you make up your mind

Please give him a call, he'll want you to see
That love isn't real and your heart doesn't bleed
You can come back when they let you down

All cards are out, I'll follow your lead
I'm more in need and I'm stuck in a sigh
You can come back and give us a try

Stuck in the hurt
Falling back
Hoping you don't relax

Shadows of teeth, the caskets you used
A bed always made, straighten your spine
And you can come back whenever you lose

High on the words you try to inhale
I'm calling your bluff in every verse
And you can come back whenever you fail

Tied to your waste, I'm a ship on the chain
I'll make them think that the death was rehearsed
You can come back when it's your turn

Stuck in the hurt
Falling back
Hoping you don't relax

All cards are out, I'll follow your lead
I'm more in need and stuck in a sigh
You can come back and give us a try

Tied to your waste, I'm a ship on the chain
I'll make them think that the death was rehearsed
You can come back, baby it's your turn

Stuck in the hurt
Falling back
Hoping you don't relax
