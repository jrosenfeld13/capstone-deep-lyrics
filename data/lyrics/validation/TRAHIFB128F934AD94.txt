Poisonous Mandrake, you danerous root
One of the three fates, when a man's time has come

You look so human, so different from any other plant
Youlook so human, that the Devil might take you for a man

White Mandragora, with you root so thick, you are the male
Black as the night on the outside, inside you're like a moon

You look so human, so different from any other plant
Youlook so human, that the Devil might take you for a man

Your leaves spread out... so close to the ground
Mandrake root, your berries are just like the sun
Mandrake root, as a female your root will be forked
Your juice has been known, to take away lives
Cause insanity... am I losing my mind?

Solo: Shermann-Wead

In the olden days it was believed
That in the dark of night, you had to
Tie a string from the neck of a
Black dog to the Mandrake root, then move away, move away
And with meat you must lure the dog
To pull the Mandrake root from the ground

Cover your ears... cause the cry of the Mandrake root
No man has ever survived, the dog will surely die

Solo: Wead

Poisonous Mandrake, you dangerous root
One of the three fates, when a man's time has come

You look so human, so different from any other plant
Youlook so human, that the Devil might take you for a man

Your leaves spread out... so close to the ground
Mandrake root, your berries are just like the sun
Mandrake root, as a female your root will be forked
Your juice has been known, to take away lives
Cause insanity... am I losing my mind?

Mandrake root, bring me your poisonous love
Mandrake root, I need you to bring me that love
Mandrake root... Mandrake root bring me love
Mandrake root, bring me that poisonous thing
That everyone is calling LOVE
