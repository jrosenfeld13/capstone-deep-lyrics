You're going come back someday (someday)
Begging me (begging me, begging me)
You're coming to me one day (one day)
Wait and see (wait and see, wait and see)
And there'll be changes made
Like things were meant to be

You want my love and kisses (kisses)
But you'll find (but you'll find, but you'll find)
Won't get my love and kisses (kisses)
'Less you're kind ('less you're kind, 'less you're kind)
You'll never love me
Till you give me peace of mind

Just wait and see
Just wait and see
It's in the cards
It's in the stars
And that's the way this love should be

But I'll be right here waiting (waiting)
When you fall (when you fall, when you fall)
Won't be no hesitating (hesitating)
Oh, that's all (oh, that's all, oh, that's all)
And if you want this love of mine
You better call

Just wait and see
Just wait and see (yeah)
It's in the cards
It's in the stars
And that's the way this love should be

But I'll be right here waiting (waiting)
To break your fall (break your fall, break your fall)
Won't be no hesitating (hesitating)
Oh, that's all (oh, that's all, oh, that's all)
And if you want this love of mine
You better call (yeah-who)
And if you want this love of mine
You better call

You're going come back someday (someday)
Begging me
Begging me
Begging me
Begging me
Begging me
Begging me
Begging me
