[Verse 1]
Blue is my favorite color
That's what you said
That's what you said
It's mine as well, there's no other
I stare at you

[Chorus]
Do-do do-do do-do do-dah-do
Do-do do-do do-do do-dah-do
Do-do do-do do-do do-dah-do
Do-do do-do do-do do-dah-do

[Verse 2]
You live in words and in pictures
That you send to me
That's how I get to collect you
Piece by piece
Piece by piece

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Blue jets fly all around me
To rescue me
That's how you get to protect me
Piece by piece
Piece by piece
Piece by piece
