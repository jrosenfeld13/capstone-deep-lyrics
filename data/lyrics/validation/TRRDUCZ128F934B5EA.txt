I came across to find a corner, where life is safe and calm
For god and country they will die, one shout would end this lie
I'm watching you, a perfect smile, an ancient force set free
I read the lifetimes on your skin as it's dark enough to see
You give and take
Put me to sleep
The weakness in my heart
Awaken in the dark
Come meet again these words will change our soul and destiny
It fills my world the blinding light lies where the eyes should be
When you see me falling
Trapped in fears and lies
My dreams will haunt you
My fears will find you
Rise from the ground
You're gone without a trace
I can't speak, shadows on my face
