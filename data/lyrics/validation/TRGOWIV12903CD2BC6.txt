I put my money into a condens can
You steal it 'way, give it to your TV man
Come here, pickney gal, come here
Where you think you're running to
I said to come here, girl, pickney gal, come here

How could you say that I'm not real
Look pon your face, it fayva turn cornmeal
Come here, pickney gal, come here
Where you think you're running to
I said to come, come here, pickney gal, come here

How could you say I'm not speaking the truth
Look pon your gut, it fayva spoilt jackfruit
Come here, pickney gal, come here
Where you think you're running to
I said to come, come, come here girl, pickney gal, come here
Do, do, ha-ha, hai, ha-hai, hai

(Repeat 2nd and 3rd verse)
Come, come, come here babe, come here
Come here, lord, pickney gal, come here
Where you think you're running to
Look, I said, come, come, come, come here, pickney gal, come here...
