In my mouth there is a hurricane
Just let it out
On the radio a bunch of fakes
Just shut them down

Hum along
And regret it
Cause you alone
Would get it
God don't make the laws

When i get bored i use novocaine
To numb the sound
I'm the sixth spice, the heavyweight
I bring the frowns

Hum along
And regret it
Cause you alone
Would get it
God don't make the laws

I'm the heavyweight
And i don't know why
I got the sixth sense
To make the girls cry
How unamerican
How unamerican
To leave em fainting
Waiting for a breath
