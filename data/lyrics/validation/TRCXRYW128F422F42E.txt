[Verse 1]
A wraith with an angel's body
A demon with a smile of gold
You soul-sucker
I won't become like you

A killer with the perfect weapons
Crystal eyes and a heart of coal
You soul-sucker
I won't lose myself in you

[Chorus]
Look how pretty she is when she falls down
Now there's no beauty in bleeding mascara
Lips are quivering, like a withering rose
She's back again

[Verse 2]
What the fuck do you think love means?
It's more than words and more than feelings
Sucking me dry
Is my marrow that sweet?

Your dead lovers have left a trail of broken hearts
And misspent hopes, sucking them dry
Does their marrow taste of sweetness, sweetness?
I hope you choke

[Chorus]
