My
You did look dapper in your mothers
Old green scarf
With your famous Auntie Aurthurs trousers on
You were slapped by that slapper
And we all laughed
But she laughed the loudest
Oh in 93
You could charm the bees knees of the bees

Cheeky youd say and we all fell around
Rolling round the playground
Saucy you'd say and we all fell about
Rolling round the playground
In 94
We all sang
Skipping and dancing hand in hand

Yeah with all the boys together
And all the girls together

She's the last of the English roses
She's the last of the English roses

She knows her Rodneys from her Stanleys
And her Kappas from her Reebok
And her tit from her tat
And Winstons from her Enoks
It's fine and take what I
Coming out, coming alive
Round the Snooker table
You dance the Frutti-Tutti
She almost spilled her lager
Toasting girls of great beauty

But the closing moved by
Coming of age, coming alive
All the boys together
And all the girls together

She's the last of the English roses
She's the last of the English roses
Yeah she's the last of the English roses
She's the last of, last of the English Roses

Ah sometimes you can't change
Therell be no place
Ce soir, disons chez moi
Enfin je compte de toi
Je te drague la rose mystique
Tu l'arroses mystique?
Ha, vas-y
C'est mon monde de soleil
