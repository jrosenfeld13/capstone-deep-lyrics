Baby I know there's people out there starving
Baby don't go, you got the wrong idea
Baby don't say there's people out there laughing
Baby that way it's gonna take me years

You're blowing hot and cold
I want you heart and soul
A pretty pal curiously [1:30] won't give me what you sow

Some day I think that nothing outside matters
Some day you blink, you miss a thousand years
Some day I pray, falling dumbly to my bed
Some day you stay till the audience appears

You're blowing hot and cold
I want you heart and soul
A pretty pal curiously [2:54] won't give me what you sow
