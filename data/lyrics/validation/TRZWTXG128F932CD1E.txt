Nothing can replace, what damage is done
Spewing from your mouth
Like locusts clouding the sky
Venomous and painful
Puncturing this giant wall
It will not hold
Words as weapons
An onslaught, that I cannot win
I sit, wondering if I can heal, but my battle is lost
Sorrow, oh sorrow, how do we withstand this test of strength?
My legs cannot sustain this weight
Crushing all that stands
Devourer, devourer
My battle is lost
