I want to thank you for sticking my neck out
I know I'll be there when they let the cranks out
I won't be culpable, got too much to answer for ooo oooh
My heart is in a can, my neck is in your hands
You wanted a family man but I'm not relating
I'll never be arranged I'd rather be estranged, I don't care, I don't care

Second cousin to the poor relation
Holding last week's ticket in this week's train station
Relegated to the third division on the lunatic fringe

We're not on any team not after what I've seen
All that back slapping makes me want to scream
I'll just be feeling low, waiting for the final whistle to blow oo oo ooh
They're beating metal, outside this window
I'm getting a kick out of every hammer blow
I know I can't escape it until I've been reshapen
I'm on the I'm on the...

Relegated to the third division on the lunatic fringe

They're pumping iron down in the village
They're locking lions up in the zoo
I don't know what I'm thinking I don't know where I'm sinking
Down there, down there

Second cousin to the poor relation
Holding last week's ticket in this week's train station
Relegated to the third division on the lunatic fringe

On the lunatic fringe, on the lunatic fringe, on the lunatic fringe
