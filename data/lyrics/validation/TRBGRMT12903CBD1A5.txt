Oh yeah
Yeah

Little boy wishes he wasn't small
He'd give his turtle to be six feet tall
He's got photos of Shaq and Ewing up on his wall
And he'd try a jump shot but he's afraid he'll fall
Down

Little girl wants to fall in love
Dresses like her mother in white evening gloves
She pretends tells her friends she's got somewhere to go
They don't ask where so they'll never know how she feels

With a shorter past
There's a greater hurry
Let the moment last
There's no need to worry

We should be living for today
Or tomorrow anyway

And don't ask for the world on a plate
Cause you just might get it
Don't ever say its too late
You know you'll regret it because
Just when you're sure your life can change right before
Your eyes

A mother's thinking of her little boy
Left home at sixteen back in '84
He's got a dog named lucy says she's all that he needs
Lucy know's better
She hears all his dreams

When you search yourself
When you get down to it
If you know yourself
You know you'll get through it
So start living for today
Or tomorrow anyway

And don't ask for the world on a plate
Cause you just might get it
Don't ever say its too late
You know you'll regret it
Just when you're sure your life can change right before
Your eyes (before your eyes)

With a shorter past
There's a greater hurry
But don't grow too fast
There's no need to worry
So start living for today
Or tomorrow anyway

And dont ask for the world on a plate
Cause you just might get it
Dont you ever say its too late you know you'll regret it
Yeah and dont try to tempt the hands of fate
If it rains you got to let it
And don't ever say its too late
Cause Just when you're sure your life can
Change right before your eyes
Right before your eyes
