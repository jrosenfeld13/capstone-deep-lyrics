That face I saw and thought of love
Is gone
And if you thought you'd end on top
You're wrong
You'll realize when I'm standing over you
Time will cut you down
Time will steer your path from your precious dreams
And I won't be around
No souvenirs or guilty tears
Or anything
My trust is lost and it will cost
You everything
There's a lot of lies but I'll tell you one thing that's true
Make no mistake, the hearts you break
Grow strong
I know this shame will bring you pain
So long
I know this memory will haunt you 'till the end
