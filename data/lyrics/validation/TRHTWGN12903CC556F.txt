Tender breeze, a hint of silence
Raven down the night and sky
Tinted clouds, a sheen of velvet
Echoes separate truth from lies

Chrome and iron shape the colour
Purest blue and You and I
A pale reflection on the water
Utter sadness in your eyes

Our love is a storm
We're lighter than air
We travel like clouds
Our tears are your rain

Tender breeze, a quiet warning
Lock the doors, pray for your life

Pray for your life
