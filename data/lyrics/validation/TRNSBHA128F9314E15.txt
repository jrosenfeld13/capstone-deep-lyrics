Would you like to meet me for coffee
And talk for a while
Cause time hasn't changed my mind
I need a funaral or a revival
Both ways i'll smile
But i can't sill pretend that i
Dont have a crush on you

You were everything i wanted
When i was eighteen
Perfect in every way
Then you left the church
And the rumours were plenty
I know they weren't all empty
But i'm tired of pretending that i
Dont have a crush on you
