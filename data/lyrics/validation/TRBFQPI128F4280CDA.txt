What are we supposed to do
After all that we've been through
Where everything that felt so right is wrong
Now that the love is gone

There is nothing else to proof
Now you still deny the simple truth
Can't find the reason to keep holding on
Now that love is gone

There is nothing else to proof
Now you still deny the simple truth
Can't find the reason to keep holding on
Now that love is gone
Love is gone...
Love is gone...
Love is gone...
Love is gone...

Love is gone...
Love is gone...
Love is gone...

Now that the love is gone
The love felt so right so wrong
Now that the love is gone

I feel so hurt inside
Feel so hurt inside
Got to find a reason

What are we supposed to do
After all that we've been through
Where everything that felt so right is wrong
Now that the love is gone

There is nothing else to proof
Now you still deny the simple truth
Can't find the reason to keep holding on
Now that love is gone
Love is gone...

Got to find a reason
Got to find a reason
Got to find a reason
Got to find a reason
Got to find a reason
To hold on

Love...
There's nothing left for us to say
Love...
Why can't we gently walk away

What are we supposed to do
After all that we've been through
Where everything that felt so right is wrong
Now that the love is gone

There is nothing else to proof
Now you still deny the simple truth
Can't find the reason to keep holding on
Now that love is gone
Love is gone...

What are we supposed to do
After all that we've been through
Where everything that felt so right is wrong
Now that the love is gone
Love is gone...
