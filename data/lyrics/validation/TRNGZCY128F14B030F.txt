Words and music by grant cunningham & matt huesmann
Silence
Trying to fathom the distance
Looking out 'cross the canyon carved
By my hands
God is gracious
Sin would still separate us
Were it not for the bridge his grace
Has made us
His love will carry me

[Chorus]
There's a bridge to cross the great divide
A way was made to reach the other side
The mercy of the father, cost his son
His life
His love is deep, his love is wide
There's a cross to bridge the great divide

God is faithful
On my own i'm unable
He found me hopeless, alone and
Sent a savior
He's provided a path a promised
To guide us
Safely past all the sin that would divide us
His love delivers me

[Chorus]
The cross that cost my lord his life
Has given me mine

There's a bridge to cross the great divide
There's a cross to bridge the great divide

[Chorus]
