If you're trav'lin' out west
And you see a dark haired girl
Tell her her love is a'waitin
In the rockies so near
And the mountains is high
As his love it is strong
It's a fine place to be
By his side
She belongs
And they both travelled far
And they both travelled wide
But they travelled alone
With no one to confide
Their love can't grow stronger
Tho' now it is deep
They must trust in each other
Their souls
For to keep
And we all know that people
Ain't made to live lonely
They need to be trusted
And loved by one only
That one special one
Who can just let it be
And remember that Jesus
Gave love
Away for free
