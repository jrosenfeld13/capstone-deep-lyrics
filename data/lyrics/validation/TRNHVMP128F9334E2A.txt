Pavanne, cold steel woman, Pavanne
How do you love a woman?
With eyes as cold as the barrel of her gun
Who's never missed her mark on anyone
Pavanne, Pavanne, Pavanne

Casino doors swing open, rich men raise their eyes they say "Who is this beauty"?
As elegant as ice, and later there's an accident, another charges d'affaires
Is lying in a pool of blood no witness anywhere

And they say she was a hundred miles away
The hotel porter saw her climb the stairs
And the maid with trembling hands knows what to say
When the judge says, "Are you sure? "I'm sure? she swears

Pavanne, cold steel woman, Pavanne
How do you love a woman?
With eyes as cold as the barrel of her gun
Who's never missed her mark on anyone
Pavanne, Pavanne, Pavanne

At the presidential palace a thousand people saw
His excellency leave his car and never make the door
The blood flow through his fingers as he clutches at the stain
And staggers like a drunken man lies twisted in the rain

And they say she grew up well provided for
Her mother used to keep her boys for sure
And her father's close attentions led to talk
She learned to stab her food with a silver fork

Pavanne, cold steel woman, Pavanne

And they say she didn't do it for the money
And they say she didn't do it for a man
They say she did it for the pleasure
The pleasure of the moment

Pavanne, cold steel woman, Pavanne
How do you stop this woman?
When everyone is moving through a trance
Like prisoners of some slow courtly dance
Pavanne, Pavanne, Pavanne, Pavanne
