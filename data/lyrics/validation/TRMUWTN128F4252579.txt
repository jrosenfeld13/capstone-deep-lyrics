Rodgers

And will you wait for me as I cross the raging sea ?
And Ill wait for you, China Blue
And will the stars looking down remember the sound
Of your tears in the wind, China Blue ?
And though the seasons may change from the green to the gold
But my heart will remain true to you

Save your smile for the sun and your sighs for the moon
Ill save my love for you, China Blue
And though the seasons may change from the green to the gold
But my heart will remain true to you
