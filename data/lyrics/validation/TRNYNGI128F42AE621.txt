Hold back your diamonds and pearls
'Cause the attraction's no good to me
Hold back your California Girls
Your prescriptions and your limousines
Hold back your influential friends
For they are really not my type
'Cause just as long as I've got my baby
I'll be alright

I'll be alright
Despite all the finer things
She'd have if she were monied
Like a rich girl
I'll be alright
Despite all the candy coloured things
The things that are so untrue

Hold back your perfumes so rare
'Cause she smells like a rose untorn
Hold back your designer underwear
She's a beauty just the way she was born
She may not move like Fred Astaire
But her gingerly walk is out of sight
'Cause just as long as I've got my baby
I'll be alright

I'll be alright
Despite all the finer things
She'd have if she were monied
Like a rich girl

I'll be alright
Despite all the candy coloured things
The things that are so untrue
I'll sing it for the last time y'all

Hold back your critical reviews
'Cause my baby don't need the hype
We're happy just to pay our little dues
So get movin', get on your bike
'Cause just as long as I've got my baby
If I can hold on and keep my baby
If I can just hold on and keep my baby
I'll be alright
