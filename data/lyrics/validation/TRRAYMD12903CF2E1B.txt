It's been dark and cold for too long
I've been lying here on this stone
Waiting for the time to arrive
For me to reclaim my throne
In the shadows of my tomb
I will rest and I will wait
My departure will come soon
The stars are controlling my fate

Here inside I find my peace
I am safe from light and sound
All my thoughts are mine to keep
Lying here under the ground
Outside the storm is raging on
Like the storm I come and go
I can tell my time will come
When or where I still don't know

I've been waiting
Waiting for the dawn
Meditating, learning more

I've been waiting
Waiting for the dawn
Levitating above the floor
