I don't go out

Without you

Without me

Without anybody

I don't go out

Without you

Without me

Without anybody

I don't go out

Without you

Without me

Without anybody

(We're all going to die)

Let's, Rob a bank

And then

(And then?)

Leave this island for good

I said, Le-e-e-eave this island for good

Le-e-e-eave this island, for good!

I don't go out

Without you

Without me

Without anybody

I don't go out

Without you

Without me

Without anybody

Le-e-e-eave this island for good

Le-e-e-eave this island for good

Le-e-e-eave this island for good

Le-e-e-eave this island, for good
