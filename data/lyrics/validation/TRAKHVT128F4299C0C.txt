Half the moon is shining tonight
And half the moon is pitch black
And I got half the chance that you might
Turn around and come back
Half my love has seen the light
And half my love is still blind
It keeps on thinking tomorrow
You'll change your mind

Half our hearts were doing just fine
And half our hearts were in doubt
And half the time while walking the line
I ended up steppin' out

Half my prayers were praying to God
And half my prayers were to you
Tonight it looks like
The answers are overdue

And I'm feeling just how hard
Half the moon can fool
I swear my heart might crack in two
If that moon were full
Half the moon is shining tonight
And half the moon's up and gone
You must have taken half of it's life
To find the road that you're on

Half my love has seen the truth
And half my love is still blind
It makes that missin' half the moon
Hard to find
Oh

It makes that missin' half the moon
Hard to find
