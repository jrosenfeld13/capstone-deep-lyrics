[Intro]
Bring it back, sing it back
Bring it back, sing it back to me
Bring it back, sing it back
Bring it back, sing it back to me

[Verse 1]
When you are ready
I will surrender
Take me and do as you wish
Have what you want
Your way's
Always the best way
I have succumbed to
This passive sensation
Peacefully falling away
I am a zombie
Your wish will command me
Laugh as I fall to my knees

[Chorus]
Bring it back, sing it back
Bring it back, sing it back to me
Bring it back, sing it back
Bring it back, sing it back to me

[Verse 2]
Can I control this empty delusion
Lost in the fire below?
And you come running
Your eyes will be open

And when you come back I'll be as you want me
Only so eager to please
My little song will keep you beside me
Thinking your name as I sing

[Chorus]
Bring it back, sing it back
Bring it back, sing it back to me
Bring it back, sing it back
Bring it back, sing it back to me

[Interlude]
Come, come
Come to my sweet melody
Come, come
Come to my sweet melody

[Verse 3]
Now you can't help it
If you have been tempted
By fruit hanging ripe on the tree
And I feel useless
Don't care what the truth is
You will be here come the day
Truth do you hear me?
Don't try to come near me
So tired, I sleep through the light
If you desire
To lay here beside me
Come to my sweet melody

[Chorus]
Bring it back, sing it back
Bring it back, sing it back to me
Bring it back, sing it back
Bring it back, sing it back to me
Bring it back, sing it back
Bring it back, sing it back to me
Bring it back, sing it back
Bring it back, sing it back to me

[Bridge]
Sing it back, sing it back, sing it back to me
Sing it back, sing it back, sing it back to me
Sing it back, sing it back, sing it back to me
Sing it back, sing it back, sing it back to me
Sing it back to me
Sing it back to me
Sing it back, sing it back, sing it back
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back

[Chorus]
Bring it back, sing it back
Bring it back, sing it back to me
Bring it back, sing it back
Bring it back, sing it back to me
Bring it back, sing it back
Bring it back, sing it back to me
Bring it back, sing it back
Bring it back, sing it back to me
