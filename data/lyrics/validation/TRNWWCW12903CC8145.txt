How can you call yourself a genius?
Your confidence provokes my doubt
You turn my notions all inside out
Misleading pun...
So miscellaneous...

[Chorus]
Jeer...
The logic knot defies solution
The masterpiece that you ignore...
Lampoon...
From academic and classical to folk-lore
World art in material sphere
From positive image to its primitive forms -
"Creative Grotesque"
It's so weird for you and too late to revise
The outdated views...

Looking through a prism of practical criticism
Your position is just a fake, last attempt to not make mistake

Looking through a prism of practical criticism
Your position is just a fake, better way to make mistake

[END Chorus]
Prejudiced critic
Not so brave
Refuses to notice
Somebody else's succdess
A free artist
Or "Mental Labour Slave"?
Vicious criticism
And moral regress... Jeer...

[Chorus]
Activity
Constructive unrest
Global design
Inspiration is evil jest
Absolutely zero is everything you wrote
You have no poison
But you have antidote
