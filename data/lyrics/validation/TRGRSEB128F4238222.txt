I close my eyes
Feel shadows swell
Close my eyes
Feel shadows swell
See prayers die
Where angels fell
Close my eyes
Feel shadows swell in me

Hold me in your arms
As the tears flow
Promise me and say
I won't go
I won't go
I won't

New sunshine
Darkness is gone (darkness)
New sunshine and darkness gone
Fear is torn light is reborn
New Sunshine the darkness is gone in me

Hold me in your arms
As the tears flow
Promise me and say
I won't go
I won't go
I won't

Hold me in your arms
As the tears flow
Promise me and say
I won't go
I won't go
I won't

Hold me in your arms
As the tears flow
Promise me and say
I won't go
I won't go
I won't

Hold me in your arms
As the tears flow
Promise me and say
I won't go
I won't go
I won't
