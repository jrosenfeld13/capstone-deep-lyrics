I can fly, but I want his wings
I can shine, even in the darkness
But I crave the light that he brings
Revel in the songs that he sings
My angel Gabriel

I can love, but I need his heart
I am strong, even on my own
But from him I never want to part
Hes been there since the very start
My angel Gabriel
My angel Gabriel

Bless the day he came to be
Angels wings carried him to me
Heavenly

I can fly, but I want his wings
I can shine, even in the darkness
But I crave the light that he brings
Revel in the songs that he sings
My angel Gabriel
My angel Gabriel
My angel Gabriel

Ohhh-ohh-aaahhh
My angel Gabriel
My angel Gabriel
My angel Gabriel
My angel, my angel, my angel
Gabriel, Gabriel, Gabriel, Gabriel
