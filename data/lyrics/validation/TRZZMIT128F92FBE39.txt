Well, I say, friend, don't take her, she's all I've got
Please, don't take her love away from me
I'm beggin' you, friend, don't take her, she's all I've got
She's everything in life I'll ever need

She is life when I wanna live
She's everything to me in life that life can give
She's my water when I need to drink
She's the first thought in my mind each time I try to think
Let me tell you now, friend...

She's my fingers when I want to feel
She's the only thing in life to me that's really real
She is love, she's all the love I know
She could kiss the ground in the wintertime and make the flower grow
Let me tell you now, friend...
