This love is illogical
But the pain is physical
Why do I act like an animal?
Cause you're so damn critical

Too sharp
Your tongue is like a knife
It cuts my heart
And leaves me sad
Cause I'm not that smart
I never knew that love
Could hurt so bad

It's breaking me up
What the matter with you?
Why'd you do it to me?
It's supposed to be love
Not a tragedy
Do you want me to go?
Do you want me to stay?
Where I stand, I don't know
And I got to say
Love is breaking me up
Oo-oh
I said love is breaking me up

Big fish in a little pool
Still you treat me like a fool
Wish I could just act sensible
But you're so incredible

This love will be the death of me
It hurts too much to be a clown
Cause I'm not so tough
Sometimes you look at me
And I break down

It's breaking me up
What the matter with you?
Why'd you do it to me?
It's supposed to be love
Not a tragedy
Do you want me to go?
Do you want me to stay?
Where I stand, I don't know
And I got to say
Love is breaking me up
Oo-oh
I said love is breaking me up

This love is breaking me up
This love is breaking me up

Where are you now that I'm falling apart?
Just take a look at what you've done to my heart
With this love
Oh

It's breaking me up
What the matter with you?
Why'd you do it to me?
It's supposed to be love
Not a tragedy
Do you want me to go?
Do you want me to stay?
Where I stand, I don't know
And I got to say
Love is breaking me up
Oo-oh
I said love is breaking me up

Oo-oh
Love is breaking me up
Oo-oh
Love is breaking me up
Oo-oh
Love is...
