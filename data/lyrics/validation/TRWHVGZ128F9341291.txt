Ah Ah Ah Ah
Ah Ah Ah Ah

I think I'm lost
Don't you know
You look so good
I want you so
And I-ah-ah-ah-I

You make me feel
Good Inside
But all I do is run and hide
Oh why-ah-ah-ah-why

I think about your private life
When I'm alone
Late at night
Oh I-ah-ah-ah-I

So won't you take me
To the light
And show me how your star shines bright
All night-ah-ah-ah-night

You make me feel
So surreal
Physcho thrills
Ah ah ah ah

You make me feel
So surreal
Physcho thrills
Right here, right now

You make me feel
So surreal
Physcho thrills
Ah ah ah ah

You make me feel
So surreal
Physcho thrills
Right here, right now

I think I'm lost
Don't you know
You look so good
I want you so
And I-ah-ah-ah-I

I need to know
Not understand
My silver tears are running dry
This ti-ah-ah-ah-ime

Pictures of your daily life
Sent to me via Satellite
At nigh-ah-ah-ah-ight

So can you tell me
What its like
To live alone in paradise
And why-ah-ah-ah-why

You make me feel
So surreal
Physcho thrills
Ah ah ah ah

You make me feel
So surreal
Physcho thrills
Right here, right now

You make me feel
So surreal
Physcho thrills
Ah ah ah ah

You make me feel
So surreal
Physcho thrills
Right here, right now

You make me feel
So surreal
Physcho thrills
Ah ah ah ah

You make me feel
So surreal
Physcho thrills
Right here, right now

You make me feel
So surreal
Physcho thrills
Ah ah ah ah

You make me feel
So surreal
Physcho thrills
Right here, right now
