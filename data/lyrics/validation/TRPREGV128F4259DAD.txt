Wait for me I'll understand
I just need time to comprehend your changes
There's always been these changes in you
I remember there was a time when
Fears we had we left behind and we danced
But it seems the more we learn
We'll learn that it's over
Over
It's dangerous this game we play
Your killing me words

Forget if you can
The way you moved when our hands touched
You forced me to force you
Do you remember
All the dreams, the nightmare we shared?
The poison of love so pure it's deceiving
And deceit is all we have it's got to be over
Over
It's dangerous this game we play
Your killing me words
Over
Over
Too late to take a chance again it's over

Now the wireless in my hand is ringing
The distance of our lives keeps spreading
Pounding I hear my heart, I'm not listening
Your voice from far away is screaming it's over
Over
Too late to take a chance again it's over
Over
Over
It's dangerous this game we play
You're killing me
Killing me!
Over
Over
You're too late to take a chance again;
It's over!
