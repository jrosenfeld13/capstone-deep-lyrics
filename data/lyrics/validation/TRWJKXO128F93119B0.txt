She said
"i know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad."
And she's making me feel like i've never been born
I said
"who put all those things in your head
Things that make me feel that i'm mad?
And you're making me feel like i've never been born."
She said
"you don't understand what i said."
I said, "no, no, no, you're wrong
When i was a boy
Evrything was right
Evrything was right."
I said
"even though you know what you know
I know that i'm ready to leave
'cause you're making me feel like i've never been born."
