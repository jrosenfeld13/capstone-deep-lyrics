[Verse 1]
Let's have bizarre celebrations
Let's forget who, forget what, forget where
We'll have bizarre celebrations
I'll play the Satyr in Cyprus, you the bride being stripped bare

[Chorus]
Let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in Antarctica
Let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in Antarctica

[Verse 2]
Let's have bizarre celebrations
Let's forget when, forget what, forget how
We'll have bizarre celebrations
We'll play Tristan and Iseult, but make sure I see white sails

[Chorus]
Let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in Antarctica
Let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in Antarctica

[Verse 3]
Maybe I'll never die
I'll just keep growing younger with you
And you'll grow younger, too
Now it seems too lovely to be true
But I know the best things always do

[Outro]
Let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in Antarctica
Let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in Antarctica
Let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in Antarctica
Let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in Antarctica
Let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in Antarctica
Let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in Antarctica
Let's pretend we don't exist, let's pretend we're in Antarctica
