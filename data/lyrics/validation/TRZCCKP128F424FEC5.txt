Your pretty eyes they follow me
Across the room to infinity
I turn around but you're not there
Whats the name of the game that you play everyday with me, with me

What you gonna do, what you gonna do
What you gonna do, what you gonna do

I don't know what she did
But she did it to my head
I don't know what she said
But she said it to me
I don't know what this is
But you better make it something
Do what you want to do then take it with you

What you gonna do, what you gonna do
What you gonna do, what you gonna do
What you gonna do, what you gonna do
What you gonna do, what you gonna do

Her tiny voice is in my head
She's conversations with the dead
Her footsteps trace my every move
Tell me why do I try to believe in a lie with you

I don't know what she did
But she did it to my head
I don't know what she said
But she said it to me
I don't know what this is
But you better make it something
Do what you want to do then take it with you

What you gonna do, what you gonna do
What you gonna do, what you gonna do
What you gonna do, what you gonna do
What you gonna do, what you gonna do
