Always a Larkspur
No Rest for my heart

Always a Larkspur
No Rest for my heart

Pulled its hands from the earth
Pulled its hand from the earth

And always a Larkspur
No rest for my heart

Always a Larkspur
No Rest for my heart

Pulled its hand from the earth
Pulled it's hand from the earth

Always a Larkspur
No Rest for my heart

Always a Larkspur
No Rest for my heart, heart

Something got a hold of me, baby
Something got a hold of me

Always a Larkspur
No Rest for my heart

Always a Larkspur
No Rest for my heart

Pulled its hand from the earth
I pulled its hand from the earth
Pulled its hand from the earth
I pulled its hand from the earth

Something got a hold on me
Know that something a hold of me
Know that something a hold of me
Know that something a hold of me
Know that something a hold of me
Know that something a hold of me
Know that something a hold of me
Know that something a hold of me
Know that something a hold of me
Know that something a hold of me
Know that something a hold of me
Know that something a hold of me
Feel that something a hold on me
Feel that something a hold on me
Feel that something a hold on me
Feel that something a hold on me
Feel that something a hold on

And the sky lit up
And the sky lit up
And the sky lit up
And the sky lit up
And the sky lit up
