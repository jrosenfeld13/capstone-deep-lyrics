Hide the key, cause I'm coming over
To settle the score
Don't forget how well I know you
Stop asking and keep dancing

You don't stand a chance, girl
You'll fall apart
Stop talking with your hands, girl
You'll have to start over, over again

Maybe I'll call him up and call you out
Maybe next time you should turn around
Over, over again

And put, put, put your heart where your mouth is
And put, put, put your heart where your mouth is now

Hide the key, cause I'm coming over
To settle the score
Do...do...
Stop asking and keep dancing

You think that I am blind, girl
My eyes are always floating in your mind, girl
You'll have to starve over, over again

Maybe I'm the one that plays the game
Maybe I tend to make the same mistake
Over, over again

Baby, you should put, put, put your heart where your mouth is
And put, put, put your heart where your mouth is now

Hide the key, cause I'm coming over
To settle the score
Don't forget how well I know you
I'll take, take, take, take you down
Do...do...
Stop asking and keep dancing
Stop asking and keep dancing

I'm talking about change
You really want to see the way
But if you want to see
Then you need to settle down
We're talking about change
You really want to see the way
But if you want to see
Then you need to settle down, down, down, down

Hide the key, cause I'm coming over
To settle the score
Don't forget how well I know you
I'll take, take, take, take you down
Do...do...
Stop asking and keep dancing
Stop asking and keep dancing
