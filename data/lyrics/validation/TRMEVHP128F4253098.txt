When I was seventeen, it was a very good year
It was a very good year for small town girls and soft summer nights
We'd hide from the light on the village green when I was seventeen
When I was twenty-one, it was a very good year
It was a very good year for city girls who lived up the stairs
With perfume hair that came undone when I was twenty-one
When I was thirty-five, it was a very good year
It was a very good year for blue-blooded girls of independent means
We'd ride in limousines. Their chauffeurs would drive when I was thirty-five
But now the days are short, I'm in the autumn of the year
And now I think of my life as vintage wine from fine old kegs
From the brim to the dregs. It poured sweet and clear. It was a very good year
