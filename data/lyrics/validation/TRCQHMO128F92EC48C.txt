Kimbie wants a nine-dollar shawl
Kimbie wants a nine-dollar shawl
She wants a nine-dollar shawl
And I need a Mackinaw
Well baby where you been so long

Baby where you been so long
I've been in that State pen
With them rough and rowdy, rough and rowdy, rough and rowdy men
Well baby where you been so long
Baby where you been so long
I've been in your state pen
And I gotta go back again
Well baby where you been so long

Kimbie let your hair hang down
Kimbie let your hair, let it hang down
Let your hair hang down
And your bangs all curl around
Kimbie let your hair hang down

Kimbie let your hair, let it hang down
Let your hair hang down
And come the morning
You know I'll be gone
Well baby let your hair hang down

Well I wished I was a mole in the ground
I wished I were a mole in the ground
If I was a mole in the ground
Id out-I'd tearI'd tear this mountain down
Wished I was a mole in the ground
