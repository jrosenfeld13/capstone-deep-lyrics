Is this the good the beautiful and true
Can't see the battle when it's right in front of you
In the mirror I know a weary heart when I see one I see one
Is this the good the beautiful and true
Can't see the battle when it's right in front of you
In the mirror I know a weary heart when I see one Am I gonna do what I came here to do
Am I gonna say what I came here to say
We both know you're the only one who can make me rest perfectly

I've been hiding, but I don't have a clue
Can't you see me I am right in front of you
In the mirror I know a weary heart when I see one I see one

Am I gonna do what I came here to do
Am I gonna say what I came here to say
We both know you're the only one who can make me rest perfectly

Oh can it be
Resting in you resting in me
Finally it's so sweet
Is there room on your sleeve when you're resting by me
Hey can it be
Resting in you resting in me
Finally it's so sweet
Resting in you

Am I gonna do what I came here to do
Am I gonna say what I came here to say
We both know you're the only one who can make me rest perfectly
We both know you're the only one who can make me rest perfectly
Oh can it be
Resting in you resting in me
Finally it's so sweet
Is there room on your sleeve when you're resting by me
Hey can it be / Perfectly
Can it be / Perfectly
Can it be / Perfectly
