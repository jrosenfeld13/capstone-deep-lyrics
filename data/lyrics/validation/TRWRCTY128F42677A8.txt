You ran a chainsaw through my heart
Rippin' right through me from the start
You make me go crazy all night long
I need you so bad, I know it's gotta be wrong

You get on my nerves, you make me so mad
It's times like these that I just can't stand
You're so far away and I can't hurt you now
I guess I'll just use myself like I know how

Rip out my hair
Wish that's yours
Cut my own skin
Pretend that's yours
Call you up in tears

Then you'll take back all the things that you said
And we can be ourselves once again

Goddamn, how you make me scream and shout
I don't wanna run around my room and pout
But you make me do it and I can hardly stand it
You dumped my heart, you know you've always had it
But now you're so far away
And there is no way to make you pay
So I'll go in that room and break anything I want
And in my head I just break your heart

Rip out my hair
Wish that's yours
Cut my own skin
Pretend that's yours
Call you up in tears

You're such a tease
You're such a jerk
Why do I waste my time
Or maybe you take back all the things that you said
Or maybe you take back all the things that you said
You're such a tease
You're such a jerk
Why do I waste my time
Or maybe you take back all the things that you said
Or maybe you take back all the things that you said

You're such a tease
You're such a jerk
Why do I waste my time
Or maybe you take back all the things that you said
Or maybe you take back all the things that you said
You're such a tease
You're such a jerk
Why do I waste my time
Or maybe you take back all the things that you said
Or maybe you take back all the things that you said

And we can be ourselves once again

You ran a chainsaw through my heart
Rippin' right through me from the start
You make me go crazy all night long
I need you so bad, I know it's gotta be wrong

You get on my nerves, you make me so mad
It's times like these that I just can't stand
You're so far away and I can't hurt you now
I guess I'll just use myself like I know how
