So you think it's funny
That you've been calling me
All of the time

Everyday, oh honey
I don't wanna be following
And falling behind

If you're gonna be walking away
And I don't know why I wouldn't follow
Wouldn't follow

You got me looking up
Even when I'm falling down
You got me crawling out of my skin

You got me wondering why
I am underneath this big old sky
Stopping the loving getting in
I'm stopping the loving getting in

And now you say it's easy
That you been falling for all of my charm
And getting lost in my smile

Never ceases to amaze me
When I'm chancing my arm
That I still do it with style

And now I hope
You'll be with me tomorrow
With me tomorrow

You got me looking up
Even when I'm falling down
You got me crawling out of my skin

You got me wondering why
I am underneath this big old sky
Stopping the loving getting in
Stopping the loving getting in
Yes, I'm stopping the loving getting in

You got me looking up
Even when I'm falling down
You got me crawling out of my skin

You got me wondering why
I am underneath this big old sky
Stopping the loving getting in
