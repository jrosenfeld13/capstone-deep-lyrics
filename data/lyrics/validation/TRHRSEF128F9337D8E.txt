I want to know the exact moment when I ran outta luck
I want to know the exact moment when I decided to grow up

But if I try hard, look deep inside, I'll find the fire that never died
Remember what I used to be, if it all comes back it'll set me free
I'm sick and tired of being rushed, I'm sick and tired of being pushed
I'm sick and tired of no respect, I'm sick and tired, get of my back!

I want to know the exact moment when I decided to get old
I want to know the exact moment when my feelin's turned cold

But if I try hard, look deep inside, I'll find the fire that never died
Remember what I used to be, if it all comes back it'll set me free
I'm sick and tired of being rushed, I'm sick and tired of being pushed
I'm sick and tired of no respect, I'm sick and tired, get of my back!
