(Hold on to me)

The hum of the cars, psychedelic pines
Flickering sun and endless lines
So far away the train rumbles by

(Hold on to me)

Something's in the air, I make it clear
This is who I've become and now I'm here
Sully, almost unseen, fractured skulls, cracks and seams

(Hold on to me)

This is the moment
This is the time
This is the moment
This is the time

Wishing I could carry you away but I can't
Feeling like a child and a parent
Caught between two states can't do nothing, but wait

(Hold on to me)

Put a period at the end of the phrase
Sometimes you have to punctuate

(Hold on to me)

This is the moment
This is the time
This is the moment (This is the end of something)
This is the time (This is the moment)
This is the moment (This is a moment
This is the time (This is the end of something)

But it's still mine, it's still in me
And I'm growing
But it's still mine, it's still in me
And I'm growing

I close the door, it feels so strange
Wish, wishing you would just walk in
But you can't, at least not yet

Wanna say good night
Wanna say good night
Wanna say good night
This is the moment

This is the moment
This is the time
This is the moment (This is the moment )
This is the time (This is a moment)
This is the moment (This is the end of something)

Calling out what's lost in me
Pulling, I'm selling, I'm crying
Hold, Hold, Hold on to me
