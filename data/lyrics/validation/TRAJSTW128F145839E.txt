[Chorus]
I'm waiting on the empty docks
Watching the ships come in
I'm waiting for the agony to stop
Oh, let the happiness in

[Verse 1]
I'm watching as the gulls all settle down
Upon the empty vessels
The faded whites of their wedding gowns
The songs of hopeless selflessness

[Verse 2]
The cold December Sun
A cold that blisters
The hands of a working man
Wasted, ooh

[Chorus]
I'm waiting on the empty docks
Watching the ships roll in
I'm longing for the agony to stop
Oh, let the happiness in
Oh, let the happiness in

[Verse 3]
Oh, let the happiness in
Listen to the waves against the rocks
I don't know where they've been
I'm waiting for the skies to open up
And let the happiness in

[Outro]
Oh, let the happiness in
Oh, let the happiness in
Cause it's coming, coming on
Let the happiness in
Oh, let the happiness in
Cause it's coming, coming on, coming on
Oh, let the happiness in
Cause it's coming, coming on
Oh, let the happiness in
Doo doo, doo doo doo
Oh, let the happiness in
