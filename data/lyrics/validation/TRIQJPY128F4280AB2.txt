Mad about the boy
It's pretty funny
But I'm mad about the boy;
He has a gay appeal that makes me feel
There's maybe something sad about the boy

Walking down the street
His eyes look out at me from people that I meet;
I can't believe it's true, but when I'm blue
I some strange way, I'm glad about the boy

I'm hardly sentimental
Love isn't so sublime
I have to pay my rental and I can't afford to waste much time

If I could employ
A little magic that would finally destroy
This dream that pains me and enchains me, but I can't
Because I'm mad about the boy!
