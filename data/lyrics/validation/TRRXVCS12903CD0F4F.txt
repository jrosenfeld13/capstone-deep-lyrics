Never had one, always wanted one good man
Just like every girl 'round the world wants a good man
So we hold on 'cause we know he's out there
Taking so long but I know he's out there

Seems like every man that talk to me
Didn't know nothing 'bout nothing
I don't mind being from the streets
But he gotta treat me like something
But now it's all good, everything's all good

I finally got me one
Found the special one
Thought I'd never find
Search my whole life for

Someone who needs me
As much as I need them
And someone who treats me
As good as I treat them

So I'm gon' keep this one
I'm telling you he dotes me
He loves me, ohh
Finally got me one

I be fussing, I be trippin' on this good man
But then I catch myself 'cause I know he is a good man
He don't fuss much but he boss up when he got to
I don't cost much but he buys up when he got to, yeah

Now every time my girls talk to me
I don't gotta worry 'bout nothing
I don't mind him being from the streets
'Cause he always treat me like something
And it's so good, everything's all good

I finally got me one
(Finally done got me one)
Found that special one
(Oh, so special, special)
