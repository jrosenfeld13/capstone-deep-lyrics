I don't pray to be aware of all dangers
Let me face them without fear
I don't pray for my pain to end
Let me bear it with all strength
I don't pray to be invulnerable
Let my heart be open to forgive
I don't pray for a saviour
Give me patience to wait 'til I'm free

But please stand beside me if I fall
Let me hold your warm hands
While mine get colder...
