Went to the sea but the tide was out
Stood on the shore but the wind was cold
Waited around till no one's about
Got out my spirit till my head took hold

Went to my the heart but my heart was empty
Went to the ground but the road was long
And now I've found my new salvation
It's so new the old one's young
I've been waiting for the dark to come
Like temptation and salvation
I've been waiting for the tide to turn

Dark eyes become divine
I need the love I crave
Your hands they burn like mine
I'll take you to my grave (x2)

I've been waiting for the dark to come
Like temptation and salvation
I've been waiting for the tide to turn

Dark eyes become divine
I need the love I crave
Your hands they burn like mine
I'll take you to my grave (x2)

I've been waiting the dark to come
Like temptation and salvation
I've been waiting for the tide to turn

Dark eyes become divine
I need the love I crave
Your hands they burn like mine
I'll take you to my grave
I'll take you to my grave
