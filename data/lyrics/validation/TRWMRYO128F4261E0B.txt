Living on this lonely street, a stranger in this town
Feel it in this cold concrete whenever I'm around
On the outside looking in, it's a mystery
When I'm out there in the wind, I know I'm feeling free

I know I'm a stranger in a strange land
Just a stranger, I'm a solitary man
All alone I stand about, just a stranger in a strange land
In a strange land, just a stranger

Seems I'm spending half my life saying long goodbyes
On the edges of a knife I leave it all behind
In another place and time, I'll find where I belong
But until that day arrives, I guess I'll be moving on

Yes I'm a stranger in a strange land
Just a stranger I'm a solitary man
All alone I stand about, just a stranger in a strange land
In a strange land, just a stranger, in a strange, strange land
Just a stranger, yeah

I'm a stranger, in a strange, strange land
Hey, [Incomprehensible], I'm a stranger

I'm a stranger in a strange land
Just a stranger, I'm a solitary man
I'm a stranger, in a strange, strange land
Just a stranger, I'm a solitary man
I'm a stranger in a strange land
