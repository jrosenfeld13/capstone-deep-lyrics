Ink bleeds deeper
When pressed hard
Soaks through paper and
Leaves stains on the table
You don't look how i pictured
You don't look quite
How i remember
I'll tell myself
"i cannot surround me."
But some smiles both ressurect
And drain the life from me
I don't tell you everything
It's heartless
The pictures remind me
I'm calloused to smiles
