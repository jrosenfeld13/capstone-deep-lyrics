We're all searching for someone
'cause we can't find ourselves
We all are the same, with these feelings our hearts all break
Why can't you see? Why can't you see?
We're not alone
Why can't we see? Why can't we see?

Restless 'til the end
Just shut your mind 'til your final breath
If this is it then why lie 'til the death?
We are all so proud
At least we can say we tried

Why can't we live for the day? Live for the day?
(Why can't we see without the world?)
Why can't we live for the day? Live for the day?

(Why can't we see wihtout the world)

And nothing goes as expected
And happiness can't be planned
Soon our bones will be dust on the Earth
Will your legacy still stand?
At least we can say we tried
As it's all a matter of time

Why can't we live for the day? Live for the day?
(Why can't we see without the world)
Why can't we live for the day? Live for the day?

It's just a matter of time before we lose it all
Will you rise above until the moment you fall?
Will you make the choice to treat each chance as your last?
Stop waiting to die

Why can't we live for the day? Live for the day?
(Why can't we see without the world)
Why can't we live for the day? Live for the day?

It's just a matter of time before we lose it all
Will you rise above until the moment you fall?
Will you make the choice to treat each chance as your last?
Stop waiting to die
