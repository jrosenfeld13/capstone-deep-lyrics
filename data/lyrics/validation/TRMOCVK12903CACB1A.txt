Open up my eyes
Flooded with daylight
Another sleepless night turns color black and white

With all the things I've said
There is just regret
Repeating in my head

Hands into a fist
Static in my head
Now I'm sitting face to face with loneliness

What did I expect?
Did I see forever
In you?

I never want it to hurt
More than it should
I hope you're satisfied;
I never could

Time to close my eyes
Forget about this mess
Try to fix this tragic loss of innocence

But how can I forget
The things I haven't done
When everything is dead?

I never want it to hurt
More than it should
I hope you're satisfied;
I never could

Can't you see that you left me
Here on my own?
Give me one good reason why I should let go...

With my hands around your neck...
Who will stop me now?
With my hands around your neck...
Who will stop me now?
With my hands around your neck...
Who will stop me now?
With my hands around your neck...

WHO WILL STOP ME NOW? (WHO WILL STOP ME NOW?)
WHO WILL STOP ME NOW? (WHO WILL STOP ME NOW?)
WHO WILL STOP ME NOW? (WHO WILL STOP ME NOW?)
WHO WILL STOP ME NOW? (WHO WILL STOP ME NOW?)
WHO WILL STOP ME NOW? (WHO WILL STOP ME NOW?)
WHO WILL STOP ME NOW? (WHO WILL STOP ME NOW?)
WHO WILL STOP ME NOW? (WHO WILL STOP ME NOW?)
WHO WILL STOP ME NOW? (WHO WILL STOP ME NOW?)

I never wanted it to hurt (WHO WILL STOP ME NOW?) (WHO WILL STOP ME NOW?)
More than it should. (WHO WILL STOP ME NOW?) (WHO WILL STOP ME NOW?)
I hope you're satisfied; (WHO WILL STOP ME NOW?) (WHO WILL STOP ME NOW?)
I never could. (WHO WILL STOP ME NOW?) (WHO WILL STOP ME NOW?)

Can't you see that you left me (WHO WILL STOP ME NOW?) (WHO WILL STOP ME NOW?)
Here on my own. (WHO WILL STOP ME NOW?) (WHO WILL STOP ME NOW?)
Give me one good reason why I should let go now... (WHO WILL STOP ME NOW?) (WHO WILL STOP ME NOW?)
