I saw you three times
In a face in the crowd
Called out your name
Just as clear and a loud
As I could without thinking
It wouldn't be you
But a lie in my head
Was a hope that died true

I saw what I thought
Was that look in your eyes
On the face of a stranger man
Standing in line
And all I know now
When it comes to you
Is that I ran outta stars
For one wish to come true

And gone are the days when I still had the time
And please tell my mother I'm doing alright
But it's slow, slow and gone is the life that I've known
The life that I've known

It's already November
We've been driving all night

Never thought that we'd bring it this far
In a working man's town
Thought I'd see you around
On the shotgun side
With my own two eyes

Then I saw you three times
In a rear view mirror
Like the broken white stripes in the dark
Could've sworn it was you
By the light of the moon
Like a Tennessee cross in a fog

And gone are the days when I still had the time
And please tell my mother I'm doing alright
But it's slow, slow and gone is the life that I've known
The life that I've known

And gone are the days when I still had the time
And please tell my mother I'm doing alright
But it's slow, slow and gone is the life that I've known
The life that I've known
