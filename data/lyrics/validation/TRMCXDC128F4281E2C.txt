Well tell me something I don't know
About discretion
Manic deception
Oh, hari kari here we go
Only I don't know
Hari kari here we go
No, I don't know
Hari kari here we go
How to let it go
Hari kari here we go
To where the winds blow

There's no fighting, no hiding
The hurricane we're riding
There's no hiding, no fighting
It doesn't matter either way
The piper has been paid
It doesn't matter why we must pay
For death on Friday

Tell me something I don't know
About savlation
Annihilation
Hari kari here we go
Help me, I don't know
Hari kari here we go
No, I don't know
Hari kari here we go
How to let it go
Hari kari here we go
To where the winds blow

There's no fighting, no hiding
The hurricane we're riding
There's no hiding, no fighting
It doesn't matter either way
The piper has been paid
It doesn't matter why we must pay

There's no fighting, no hiding
The hurricane we're riding
There's no hiding, no fighting
It doesn't matter either way
The piper has been paid
It doesn't matter why we must pay
A death on Friday
A death on Friday
A death on Friday
