Well I'm blowing smoke out of your window
And you're slippin' back into your dress
You know you were always such a lady
I've always been impressed
But gentlemen they don't ask questions
Just keep quiet, pay attention, gentlemen
They don't ask questions, we could pay attention

I said I'm gonna have myself in shambles
Before your folks are up and lookin' for some answers
Said I'm gonna have myself in shambles
Before your folks are up and lookin' for some answers

Well, I pictured you in blue, but I have to say
I'm more partial to the red, deep, dark, and devastating
Leaving no question as to where you've been
I calmed the crowd, by keeping quiet, moved like a shadow, up to your mattress
Gentlemen don't ask questions, we could pay attention

Do you think hed be better
(Cause were down for competition)
Doing what I do best?
(This could all be on purpose)

I said I'm gonna have myself in shambles
Before your folks are up and lookin' for some answers
Said I'm gonna have myself in shambles
Before your folks are up and lookin' for some answers

Do you think hed be better
(Cause were down for competition)
Doing what I do best?
(This could all be on purpose)

I said I'm gonna have myself in shambles
Before your folks are up and lookin' for some answers
Said I'm gonna have myself in shambles
Before your folks are up and lookin' for some answers
