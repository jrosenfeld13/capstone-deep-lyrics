This morning was a fight to get up
Those words still ringing in my head
Never felt like such a fool in front of anyone
I guess that's what you do when you love someone

I was in Nashville, you were driving home
I wish I'd been in the passenger seat
I just needed you to know that I'm coming undone
That's what you do when you love someone

If I fall, I'll try a little harder and get back up
Please stay by me, love
That's what you do when you love someone
That's what you do when you love someone

Just give me time, if you need more
There's no way to ever really know
How to protect yourself or predict the outcome

But you'll do anything when you love someone
You'll do anything when you love someone

If I fall, I'll try a little harder and get back up
Please stay by me, love
That's what you do when you love someone
That's what you do when you love someone

I just hung up the phone
You've got a way of changing my day
You proved me wrong
When I was convinced I was alone
Yeah, that's what you do when you love someone

If I fall, I'll try a little harder and get back up
Please stay by me, love
That's what you do when you love someone
That's what you do when you love someone
