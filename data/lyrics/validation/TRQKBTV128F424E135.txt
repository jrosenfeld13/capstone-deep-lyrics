I must admit I wonder
When she brought up all of those things on her mind
I couldn't do much better
When I told her everything was fine

I had to go away
I had to go away

I might have waited longer
Seemed like forty days and eighty nights
But Then I saw my angel
It seemed like everything would turn out right

Set my heart aflame
She became my everything
See the joy she brings

If we can get through this
You know we got our wish
We took it to the level
And we held out for more

And isn't it a trist
The things we might have missed;
Of stickin' with the wrong too long to know what right was

And isn't it a shame?
We have only ourselves to blame
At least thats what they tell you when you take the back door

But it just never fit;
The thought of makin' it end
Lets leave it to the pretty boys and girls in the show

Why do we go away?
Why do we go away?
Why do we go away?
