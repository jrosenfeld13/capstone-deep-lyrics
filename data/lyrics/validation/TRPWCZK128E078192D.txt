Was there in your cage
When your lion got tamed
Was up on your stage
When your childhood flamed
The sorrow and rage
But it ain't no game
To me now

All the lights in London shining now
Slow ye down and stay awhile
All the lights in London shining now

Standing in line
With these abstract gifts
Counting the time
As the dragnet shifts
A quarter to nine
And the gray cloud lifts
Away now

All the lights in London shining now
Slow ye down and stay awhile
All the lights in London falling down

Hearing you say
With your perspect's tongue
Walking the way
Where the dreams get flung
Was never your thing
When it all goes wrong
To worry
Whoa-oa

All the lights in London shining now
Slow ye down and stay awhile
All the lights in London shining now

Interlude

Telling a lie
Cause the truth just stinks
Out in the mud
Where the lightning sinks
Wishing you could
As the strip light blinks
Away now
Whoa-oa

All the lights in London shining now
Slow ye down and stay awhile
All the lights in London falling down

All of London falling down
All of London falling down
All of London
