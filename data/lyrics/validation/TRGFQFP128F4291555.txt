Bullshit knocks you over the head
Like a ton of bricks
CNN kills brain cells like alcohol
PR feeds the rage
But the clear answers never come
It's like an open bar to misplace our trust

Call into your talk show hatred
To express all that we don't know

The sun will not rest
On backs of evil
The sun will not set
When we think like this

Wake up. We will. Destroy. Ourselves

This rage is realy against yourself
You're slamming the shots of fear itself
They'll have to pry that remote from your dead
Cold hands
Our grip on truth rests
On the lies we've been told
And this whole thing..
Smells like
Bullshit
It smells like more bullshit to me

It's the same scenario all across the land
TV radiating, remote in hand
Advertising, propagting-entertaining

We're escaping. We're escaping from ourselves

Pull up a stool...
Truth. Lies. It's all the same
Fact. Fiction. It's all a game
Failure- to think for ourselves
Success- to live up to a lie
