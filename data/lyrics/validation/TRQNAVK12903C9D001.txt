Well you can find me serving drinks inside a honky tonk
I'll even play the jukebox on your dime
And sometimes I will dance with you to your favorite song
But she'll be mine after closin' time
She will smile at all the men and shake her pretty hips
And you can yell and say she look so fine
But I'm not looking for a man I'm looking for their tips
And she'll be mine after closin' time
When they turn the lights out that's when I'll turn him on
She can serve me love much better than wine
So when they close the doors I guess who takes me home
And she'll be mine after closin' time
[ guitar ]
Tomorrow night I'll still be there inside that honky tonk
And I'll still play the jukebox on your dime
But as long as you keep buyin' drinks she'll smile and lead you on
But she'll be mine after closin' time
When they turn the lights out...
She'll be mine after closin' time
