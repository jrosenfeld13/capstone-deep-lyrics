All you feel and you taste and you wanna go higher so what do you do and
So you peek into the mountain where your desire goes
Spilled blood on this place it only echoes true, all through the days and
So you peek into the mountain where your desire goes

Oh, havin' the space to know
The weight is coming down
Take it on down the line
Oh, yeah, havin' the space to know
The weight is coming down
Take it on down the line

It's hard to get ahead when the center is bleedin'
And you tear out the middle and you send it all away
Tasteless lead sittin on our tongues
And then we have to worry more about the ones we love

When you see the smoke there's fire
When you see the smoke there's fire
When you see the smoke there's fire
When you see the smoke there's fire

(Chorus)

(Repeat 1st verse)

(Chorus)
