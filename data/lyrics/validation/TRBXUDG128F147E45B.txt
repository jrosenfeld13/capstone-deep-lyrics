[Verse]
You ask me how much I need you
Must I explain
I need you oh my darling
Like roses need rain
You ask how long I'll love you
I'll tell you true
Until the Twelfth of Never
I'll still be loving you

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold me close
Never let me go
Hold me close
Melt my heart like April snow

[Chorus]
I'll love you till the bluebells
Forget to bloom
I'll love you till the clover
Has lost its perfume
And I'll love you till the poets
Run out of rhyme
Until the Twelfth of Never
And that's a long, long time

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
