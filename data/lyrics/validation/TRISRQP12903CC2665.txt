It's endless it's heartless, defines you all
You're hearing not listening but still want more
You follow and mimic what you fight for
I'm watching and reeling I can't take anymore
Never ending I can feel my patience wear thin
You drew the line but never again
Set this straight so let's just begin

You gave me hope but you fed me lies
What's left to lose what's left to hide
Can't take my dreams you can't take my pride
There's nothing left when you can't hide
How dare you look into my eyes
What's left to lose what's left to hide
You lose

It's endless it's heartless, defines you all
You're hearing not listening but still want more
You follow and mimic what you fight for
I'm watching and reeling I can't take anymore
Never ending I can feel my patience wear thin
You drew the line but never again
Set this straight so let's just begin

You gave me hope but you fed me lies
What's left to lose what's left to hide
Can't take my dreams you can't take my pride
There's nothing left when you can't hide
How dare you look into my eyes
What's left to lose what's left to hide
Won't take my dreams you won't take my pride

And this time you won't take my pride
Hide behind your safest guard
You push you push you won't get far
You've got what's coming from me

Hide behind your safest guard
You push you push you won't get far, you won't get far
You've got you've got what's coming from me
