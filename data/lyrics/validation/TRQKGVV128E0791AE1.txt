When the world was travelling faster and faster
Two colors became just a blur
And the buildings were falling, plaster from plaster
'Til things just weren't what they were

What could save mankind from man?
When the blind the blind overran
From this scene of confused devastation
Came the great spontaneous apple creation

And a speck in the sky grew to a cloud
And fishes flew and laughed aloud
And hamsters grew wings and flew on the doors
And rich wine was sweated from every man's pores
And 3,000 people ate one strawberry

And the cloud grew green and pushed out a stalk
And the chairs grew suede boots and started to walk
And the strong silent ones began to talk
And three million people told butter from stork

And the cloud grew greener and greener and harder
'Til it reminded all those there of something from the larder
And suddenly it was there and in each and every land
Each man, beast, and creature had an apple in his hand
And from that day came a new recreation
The great spontaneous apple creation!

What could save mankind from man?
When the blind the blind overran
From this scene of confused devastation
Came the great spontaneous apple creation
(apple creation)
