Hearts in clubs and shapes and diamonds. In my old town you can smell the violence. We played the house and the house always won. I know it sucks and we can move to the city. We can start again. And the whole damn story started like this. I bet on diamonds and I lost everything. So I'm never betting on diamonds again. D-I-A-M-O-N-D-S!
