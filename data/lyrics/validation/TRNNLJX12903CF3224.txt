This is what I wait for
Every three hours take more
Don't you tell me life's a bore
I got stuff to live for
This is what I wait for
Each two hours take more
Don't you tell me life's a bore
I got stuff to live for
This is what I wait for
Every hour takes more
Don't you tell me life's a bore
I got stuff to live for
I got stuff to live for
I got stuff to live for
If you're new here
You'd have things to do here
If you knew, like I do
And I try, get you high, oh I
I got sound, no sound
I got eyes, no eyes
I got heart, no heart
I got a body that don't wanna be mine
I got nobody, I want to be mine
I got a body that don't wanna be mine
I got nobody, I want to be mine
This is what I wait for
Every minute take more
Don't you tell me life's a bore
I got stuff to live for
