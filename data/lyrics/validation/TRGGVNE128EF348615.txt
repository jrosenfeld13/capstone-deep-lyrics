[Verse 1]
I can't do what you do
I'm just able to tear it down
Stay in a cold minute of sleep
See the world right through the ether

[Chorus]
Twisting names inside of me
Electric atmosphere to be
Must carry on one last time
Cannot end what has begun

[Post-Chorus]
In your eyes, in your eyes you're alive
But in my eyes, in my eyes you're a lie

[Verse 2]
You can't do what I do
I'm just able to ruin you
Stay in the cold ways of winter
See myself right through the ether

[Chorus]
Twisting names inside of me
Electric atmosphere to be
Must carry on one last time
Cannot end what has begun

[Post-Chorus]
In your eyes, in your eyes you're alive
But in my eyes, in my eyes you're a lie
In my eyes, in my eyes, in my eyes you're a lie
In my eyes, in my eyes, in my eyes you're a lie
