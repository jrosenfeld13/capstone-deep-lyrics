Captured in a photograph
In black & white
Her hair brushes her shoulders
As she leans to turn out the light
She's warm and you can feel her
But she can't feel you
No she's just too numb to move

Captured in a photograph
Without a frame
I see you standing tall
But I see no face to blame
And did she say she loved you
Well you know that's really nice
Because they say that when she cries
Her tear drops turn they turn to ice

Let her feel the rain
Won't you let her feel again
Feeling through the pain
Won't you let her feel the rain
Upon her face
Let her feel the rain
Won't you let her feel the rain
Upon her face

Captured in a photograph
Inside her eyes
She'll wrap you in her blanket
And then she'll tell you some lies
And you will kneel before her
At her altar in the trees
Because they say no matter who you are
She'll bring you to your knees

Let her feel the rain...
