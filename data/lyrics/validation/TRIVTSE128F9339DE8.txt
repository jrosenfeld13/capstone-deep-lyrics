Heart of my heart
Got to leave you today
You don't love me and you can't understand
Cut by the torns awhile
Have to loosen my grip
Have to let your flower fall my hands

Down Put It put it Down
Put It Down
Put It Down
Put It Down
Go Let it let it go
Let It Go go
Let It Go go
Let It Go
Mail drop it the mail drop it the mail drop it the mail
Put it in the sauce
Bottle up the sauce
Bottle up the sauce
Bottle up the sauce

Na na na, na na na na na na na na na na na na

Love of all loves, you have made a mistake
Oh the saw the flaws (?), and now you regret
My minds aggrieved and my belly's ablaze
I have swallowed all the words that you've said
