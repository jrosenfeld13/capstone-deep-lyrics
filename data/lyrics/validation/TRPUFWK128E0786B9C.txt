[Verse 1]
Come down to my house, stick a stone in your mouth
You can always pull out, if you like it too much

[Chorus 1]
Make a whole new religion
A falling star that you cannot live without
And I'll feed your obsession
There'll be nothing but this thing that you'll never doubt

[Verse 2]
A hit is hard to resist and I never miss
I can take you out with just a flick of my wrist

[Chorus 2]
Make a whole new religion
A falling star that you cannot live without
And I'll feed your obsession
There is nothing but this thing that you'll never doubt
This thing you'll never doubt

[Instrumental bridge]

[Chorus 3]
And I'll feed your obsession
The falling star that you cannot live without
I will be your religion
This thing you'll never doubt
You're not the only one
You're not the only one

[Outro]
Bow down to me
Bow down to me
Bow down to me
Bow down to me
Bow down to me
Bow down to me
Bow down to me

[Hidden lyrics]
Now I want it too much
Now I want it to stop
Now I'm lucky like a falling star fell over me
Yeah you worry too much
Now it's got to be stopped
Now I'm lucky like a falling star fell over me
Now I want it too much
Now I want it to stop
Now I'm lucky like a falling star fell over me
Yeah you worry too much
Now it's got to be stopped
Now I'm lucky like a falling star fell over me
