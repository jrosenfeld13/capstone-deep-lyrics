When I looked at my reflection in the mirror
I said this can't be happening to me
I wasn't ready for the challenge
For my life was still unbalanced
And the pleasing of my fans and my friends still had demands on me
To find out who I was did not come easy
For I felt like I was in this race alone
Until I heard a voice speak clearly
Saying there's a winner within me
And I was charged to beat the odds and the victory I'll say
The winner in me pushed me forward
When my problems would push me down
The winner in me with found my freedom
When my surroundings kept me confound
So let's make one thing perfectly clear
There's one reason that I'm still here
It's the winner in me
Jesus, the winner in me
The winner in me pushed me forward
When my problems would push me down
The winner in me with found my freedom
When my surroundings kept confound
So let's make one thing perfectly clear
There's a reason that I'm still kept me
It's the winner in me
(And his name is Jesus)
Jesus, the winner in me
The winner in me would bring me peace
When those around would drive me insane
The winner in me became a refuge
When obscure became my pain
God's taking me to my destination
This is my proclamation
(It's the winner in me)
And his name is Jesus
(Jesus the winner in me)
I wanna tell the world about him
(It's the winner in me)
He's the winner in me
(Jesus the winner in me)
Jesus is the winner in me
(It's the winner in me)
I've got a testimony
(Jesus the winner in me)
He's the winner in me
(It's the winner in me)
If it had not been for Jesus
(Jesus the winner in me)
I would have lost my mind
(It's the winner in me)
Though the struggles I was in
(Jesus the winner in me)
I can tell everybody
(It's the winner in me)

The only way I could have made it
(Jesus the winner in me)
Oh Yeah, when nobody else would come to my rescue
