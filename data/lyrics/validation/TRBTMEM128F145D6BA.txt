Just another lonely trail
Heading through the pouring rain
I am lost in time and space
Remembering your face
Just another winding road
I don't know where it will go
All I know is that it
Takes me far from you
If I had my way
I'd be there beside you today
Until I'm home again
Till I see the morning in your eyes
Though the world may spin
Here inside my heart I'm only
Half alive
Till I'm home again
When I'm high above the clouds
Or alone inside the crowd
I'm a million miles from where I want to be
And oh day runs into night
And this room has run out of light
If I had my way
I'd be there beside you today
Until I'm home again
Till I see the morning in your eyes
Though the world may spin
Here inside my heart I'm only
Half alive
Till I'm home again
So tell me you will wait for me
You're the star in my horizon
Keep the fire warm for me
I'll be back before the first snow fall
