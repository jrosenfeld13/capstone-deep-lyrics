Go on and crash the car
Take the keys I won't get far
Nowhere will do just fine
Here I am again
Beginning at another end
There's no turning back this time

Don't let me down
I need you now
To make it easy
Dying ain't that hard
So in a little while
I'm gonna make it easy
Make it easy

The sweet sunshine won't let me be
A good man wants to marry me
I burn my house down to the ground
Wine and Roses and a symphony
The best things in life are terrifying me
I break my heart every time

Don't let me down
I need you now
To make it easy
Dying ain't that hard
So in a little while
I'm gonna make it easy
Make it easy

Don't let me down
I need you now
To make it easy
Dying ain't that hard
So in a little while
I'm gonna make it easy
Make it easy

Do you want the good news?
Or the bad news?
Do you want the good things
No, you want everything
Keep your possessions, I've made my decision
And it was easy, easy

I've waited for this all my life

Don't let me down
I need you now
To make it easy
Dying ain't that hard
So in a little while
I'm gonna make it easy
Make it easy

Don't let me down
I need you now
To make it easy
Dying ain't that hard
So in a little while
I'm gonna make it easy
Make it easy
