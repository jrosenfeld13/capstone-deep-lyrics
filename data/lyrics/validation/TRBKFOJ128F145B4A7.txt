[Chorus 1]
You know the night time is the right time
To be with the one you love

[Chorus 2]
I said, oh baby, well now come on baby
I want to be with the one I love
You know you're the one I'm thinking of
I know that night time, oh, is the right time
To be with the one I love

[Verse 1]
Well I used all my dollar
Dollar and dime away[?]
Left me alone, a child

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]
Baby![x5]
You know I love you
No one above you
Holy child, make everything alright?

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
So squeeze me[x3]
Lead me, oh baby
Take my hand
Hug me, no other way[?]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 1]
