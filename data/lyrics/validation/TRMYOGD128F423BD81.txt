Some people can love one at time
Say every woman's bears a man
My baby said she wouldn't put here forever
So she gonna love as many as she can
What can I do now?
I just play it cool
I just play it cool, people
'Cause that's the only thing I know to do
Now women look good these days
They can look sexy in so many ways
They can wear those dresses up above their knees
And that will make a man take his life away
But what can I do, people?
I just play it cool
I just play it cool now
'Cause that's the only thing I know to do
People may be wrong sometime
They can't be wrong all the time
Like they say I can't have nine lives
But my baby say she can love that many times
Oh, what can I do now?
I just play it cool
I just play it cool
'Cause that's the only thing I know to do
