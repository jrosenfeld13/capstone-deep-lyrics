Hey now
I want your kisses in the morning, yeah
To let me know that everything will be alright
I wanna touch you every night before I go to sleep
To let you know that everything will be just fine
Whenever your happy
It makes me happy
I wanna be there for you
And do whatever makes you smile
We only get to see eachother every now and then
And you know I'm grateful for that time
It's just not
It really ain't enough for me
It really ain't enough for me
I really need to have you here by my side
It really ain't enough for me
It really ain't enough for me
I really need to have you here by my side
I wanna see you when I get home from work
To let go of the worries and the problems of the day
I can listen, sittin' right outside of the shower curtain
And we can both call in and we can spend a lazy day
Whatever makes you happy
It makes me happy
I wanna be there for you
And do whatever makes you smile
We only get to see eachother every now and then
And you know I'm really grateful for that time
It's just not
It really ain't enough for me
It really ain't enough for me
I really need to have you here by my side
It really ain't enough for me, darlin'
It really ain't enough for me
I really need to have you here in my life
