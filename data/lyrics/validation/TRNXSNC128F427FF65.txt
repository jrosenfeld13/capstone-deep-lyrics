Johnny was a schoolboy when he heard his first Beatles song
'Love Me Do,' I think it was. From there it didn't take him long
Got himself a guitar, used to play every night
Now he's in a rock 'n' roll outfit and everything's all right

Don't you know?

Johnny told his mama, "Hey, Mama, I'm goin' away
I'm gonna hit the big time, gonna be a big star someday."
Mama came to the door with a teardrop in her eye
Johnny said, "Don't cry, Mama," smiled and waved good-bye

Don't you know, yeah yeah, Don't you know that you are a shooting star
Don't you know, don't you know. Don't you know that you are
A shooting star
And all the world will love you just as long
As long as you are

Johnny made a record, went straight up to number one
Suddenly everyone loved to hear him sing the song
Watching the world go by, surprising it goes so fast
Johnny looked around him and said, 'Well, I made the big time at last'

Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know that you are
A shooting star
Don't you know, oh, yeah, don't you know that you are
A shooting star, yeah
And all the world will love you just as long
As long as you are, a shooting star

Don't you know that you are a shooting star, Don't you know, yeah
Don't you know that you are a shooting star, now
And all the world will love you just as long, As long you are you

Johnny died one night, died in his bed
Bottle of whiskey, sleeping tablets by his head
Johnny's life passed him by like a warm summer day
If you listen to the wind, you can still hear him play

Oh oh oh, Don't you know that you are a shooting star
Don't you know, yeah, don't you know', Don't you know that
You are a shooting star
Don't you know, yeah
Don't you know that you are a shooting star
Don't you, don't you
Don't you, don't you
Don't you know, don't you
Know, oh, yeah, you are
Yeah, a shooting star, yeah, oh
Oh oh oh oh......
Don't you, don't you know
That you are a shooting star
Don't you don't you know......
