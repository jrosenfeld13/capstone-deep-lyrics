When I am lonely I sing about the night
When I am feeling food I sing about what's right

[Chorus]
Songs, songs we sing of life and love
Every little thing that your thinking of

He walked the rest, left his cucle broken down
He came from Veriginia all the way to this little town
Hair unkempt and shoes undone
A second lost a moment's won
A secont lost a moment's one
The song begins the day's begun

Some sing of visions of a life to live
Some sing about the way they feel -
And I believe that's all there is
