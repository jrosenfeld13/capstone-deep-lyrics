Feelings
Nothing more than feeling
Trying to forget my
My feelings of love
Teardrops rolling down on my face
Trying to forget my, my feelings of love
Feelings for all my life of feelings
I wish I never met you, boy
You'll never come again
Oh feeling, oh, oh, feelings
Oh, I feel such feelings again in my heart
Feelings
Feelings like I never lost you
And feelings like I never had you in my life
Oh, feelings
For all my life of feelings
Oh, Lord, I wish I never seen you, boy
'Cause I know you'll never come again
Oh feelings
Nothing more than feeling
Oh trying, trying to forget
My feelings of love
Oh, feelings
Oh, such feelings
Oh, I feel such feelings again in my heart
Oh, feelings again in my heart...
