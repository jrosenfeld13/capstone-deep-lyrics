[Chorus]
We are riding on a railroad
Singing someone else's song
Forever standing by that crossroad
Take a side and step along
We are sailing away on a river to the sea
Maybe you and me can meet again
We are riding on a railroad
Singing someone else's song, sing along

[Verse 1]
Time to time, I tire of the life that I've been leading
Town to town, day by day
There's a man up here
He claims to have his hands upon the reins
There are chains upon his hands and he's riding upon a train

[Chorus]
We are riding on a railroad
Singing someone else's song
Forever standing by that crossroad
Take a side and step along
We are sailing away on a river to the sea
Maybe you and me can meet again, now
We been riding, we been riding on a railroad
Singing someone else's song
