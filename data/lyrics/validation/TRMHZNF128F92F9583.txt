Father can you hear me
Did you talk to Mother Earth?
What did she say
What do you see
Now is it time for our re-birth?

Open up the silent center of your mind
I now want to know the future of our kind

In the Valley of the Kings
When the storm breaks loose again
When the gods return to fight
For the future in their lives!

[Chorus]
In the Valley of the Kings
In the Valley of the Kings!
In the Valley of the Kings
In the Valley of the Kings!

Oh Mother do you hear me
Did you talk to Father Moon?
I don't want to leave my brothers
In this temple of their doom

Open up the silent center of your mind
I now want to know the future of our kind

In the Valley of the Kings
When the storm breaks loose again
Then the gods will spread their wings
In the Valley of the Kings

[Chorus]

Ra vite, deus sanctus, ra vite
Ra vite, revertate, ra vite

[Instrumental]

Oh Mother Earth do you believe there is a place for us to go?
Come set us free again and let us fly away and give us hope!
There'll be a time for us to fly
Up to our thrones in the sky!


In the Valley of the Kings
When the storm breaks loose again
Then the gods will spread their wings
In the Valley of the Kings
-In the Valley of the Kings!-


In the Valley of the Kings
When the storm breaks loose again
Then the gods will spread their wings
In the Valley of the Kings
