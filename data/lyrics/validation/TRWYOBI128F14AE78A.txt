The song you sing
Orchestrates in perfect harmony
A verse that shines of brilliance
Whispers every moment subtly

You compose a symphony
Playing with notes that are in key
A sound that will not be forgot
Defining clarity so

Sing to me this melody
I'll let the rhythm take control
Sing to me this melody
A rhythm I have never known

A love song like no other one
Resounds on in time
Your design it lights up the distance
Signaling the noise to help me find

The words I can't ignore
So I'll sing along in a discord
Every measure, beat after beat
I'm slowly learning more so

Sing to me this melody
I'll let the rhythm take control
Sing to me this melody
A rhythm I have never known

This harmony rises up in me

Sing to me this melody
I'll let the rhythm take control
Sing to me this melody
A rhythm I have never known
