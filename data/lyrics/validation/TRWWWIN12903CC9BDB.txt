If I had a ribbon bow to bind my hair
If I had a fancy sash, my love would think me fair
Then he would go to Frankfurt, a-loggin' on the rise
He'd bring me back with his own hands, a very pretty prize

If I had a ribbon bow to bind my hair
If I had a fancy sash, my love think me fair
If I was a city girl, and fair with smart
Not a lad in all these parts would know my heart
Copy paste is a sin, always on the run is better
And then I'd live in Frankfurt
Where all the lovers go
I'd lark about them settlements
A-wearing foreign clothes
