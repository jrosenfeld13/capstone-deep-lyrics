You don't know me
You just know my name
You want to see me ruined
I know that's your game
Realize
There's nothin left at all
You want to see me ruined
Or not at all

Taking trips, instead of reading rhymes
You want to take a tip
And redefine your mind
Realize
(there's a brain to the side of dawn??????)
????????????????????

Taking trips inside your pretty mind
Won't have to go too far
There's nothing there to find
Realize
There's a brain this side of dawn??????)
You want to see me ruined
Or not at all

You don't know me
You just know my name
You want to see me ruined
I know that's your game
Realize
There's nothin left at all
You want to see me ruined
Or not at all
