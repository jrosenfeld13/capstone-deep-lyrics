I'm wondering why your face no longer shines
I'm wondering why your face no longer shines
I'm wondering why
You're always on my mind
I'm stll wondering
Give me a little more time

I need to know why I can't see your tears
I need to know why I can't see your tears
I need to know how many lonesome years
I want to make you cast away your fears
