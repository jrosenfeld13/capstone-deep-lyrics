Living by numbers
Adding to history
And living by numbers
I guess was always meant to be
Living by numbers
Living by numbers now
We've been living a long time
Counted out in the rows of files
Such a digital lifetime
It's been by numbers all the while
Living by numbers
Living by numbers now
You count the days but does it
All add up to you
Does it all add up to you why we're
Living by numbers
Living by numbers now
So you're living by numbers
And numbers you answer to
You can count all the nubmers
You bet that someone's counting you
Living by numbers
Living by numbers now
Living by numbers
Living by numbers now
They don't want your name
They don't want your name
They don't want your name
They don't want your name
Just your number
