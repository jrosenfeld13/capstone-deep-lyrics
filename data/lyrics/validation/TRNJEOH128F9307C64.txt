You laugh, I cry
You live, I die
I made you happy, you made me hurt
I gave you honey, you gave me dirt
Now, I look at myself and there ain't nothing left-
But a ghost of myself

Don't want to live, but I'm scared to die
My tears are all gone
When I'm sad I can't cry
Met some other people
That weren't good enough
Cause what you left me to work with
Sure made it rough
Now, I look at myself and there ain't nothing left
But a ghost of myself

If another man were to come along
I couldn't even give him, a sincere smile
You took away my womanhood
Stripped me of all my pride
Now when you left you didn't give a damn
Whether I lived or died
(Oh you didn't care if I died)
I'll just wander from pillar to post
Cause don't nobody want to love a ghost
You're the winner, I'm hanging up my gloves
I'm through fighting, trying to win your love

Now, I look at myself and there ain't nothing left
But a ghost of myself

Ain't nothing left
But a ghost of myself
Ain't got nothing left, ain't got nothing left, ain't got nothing left
I ain't got nothing left but a ghost of myself
