[Verse 2]
My Glock cocked and my beam on
Money up and my team strong
Eat, sleep, and shit money
Racks on racks my ringtone
Bang Bang my theme song
Millionaire my dream song
God sent me an angel, so now i can put my team on
Had a loss, at the bank, shake yo hands and make a deposit
True religion, rock jeans, Gucci throw in my whole closet
These niggas leave with my city star
Gotti real but these niggas flaw
Murder murder with my yung niggas
Stay the fuck out our apartments
We run that bitch like the fuckin carter
Lil mo grams but a lil mo smarter
Runnin to the side cuz we gon make them bombs and
We gon go to court and we gon beat them charges
66 hey nigga how you mobbin
Always broke nigga how you robbin
Target practice where you bithces headed
All you doing is bullet dodging
Got a bullet charge its all great
With them chrome rims and them pipes barking
Black tent with that black 40
When the windows down you see numbers barkin
Pow, niggas bodies droppin
Niggas made a client partner switch a side
And im just in Miami on the beach, ridin down ocean drive
