You could never kill me
Old, diseased, and weak
Forced to break the promise you could never keep
Broken, tired, animal
You will never be me

There will be no more
Always and forever
Only secure
Hopeless lives
There will be no more
Always and forever
It would make me sick

Old, diseased, and weak
Forced to break the promise you could never keep
Broken, tired, animal
You will never be me

I will turn it all in for
Late nights and impossible dreams
Impossible

I will turn it all in for
Late nights and impossible dreams
Impossible
