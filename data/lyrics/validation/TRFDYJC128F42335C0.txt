Oh she may be weary
And young girls they do get wearied
Wearing that same old shaggy dress
But when she gets weary
Try a little tenderness, (Fandango)

You know she's waiting; just anticipating
The things that she' never never never never possesses, yeah
But while she's there waiting, without them
Try just a little bit of tenderness

That's all you got to do (this is for you)

It's not just sentimental no no
She has her grief and her care
But soft words they are spoke so gentle
It makes it easier, easier to bear

You won't regret it, no no
Young girls; they never forget it
Love is their only happiness
But it is so- so easy
All you got to do is try
Try a little tenderness

Squeeze her, don't you tease her, never leave her
You've got to, got to, got to try a little tenderness
(Ad lib to end)
