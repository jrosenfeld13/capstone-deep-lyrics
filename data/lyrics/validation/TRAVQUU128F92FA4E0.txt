Wake up, crossed another state line
Fed up, a hundred million miles to drive
Yeah....
I hope you'll be waitin at the door
With open arms, like you did before
So carry me free

You know I was born to roam
I need you to help me along
And I'm driving all night going home

Tell me, Tell me that you'll always be true
Keep me going, tell me what to do
To get back to you

You know I was born to roam
I need you to help me along
And I'm driving all night going home
Going home
