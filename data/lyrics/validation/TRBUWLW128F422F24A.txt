I don't want to barge in on your secrecy
Dependency
It means nothing to me;
I don't want to hear about your problems

And I don't want to listen to your apathy
You're not like me
You mean nothing to me;
That cash doesn't make you any greener

I don't need anyone, I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone to tell me what to feel
I don't need anyone, I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone to hate the world with me

Day in day out it's not that bad
I worry and I worry but you'll never have to worry again
Day in day out it's not that bad
I worry and I worry but you'll never have to worry again
Won't have to worry again ever be, alone

Even if I told you what it meant to me
You'd disagree
You'd never let it be
You just wanna dance around the problem
And everybody's talking about humility
Indecency
Smoke, and mirrors to me
You had the world, and you pissed it all away

I don't need anyone, I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone to tell me what to feel
I don't need anyone, I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone to hate the world with me

Day in day out it's not that bad
I worry and I worry but you'll never have to worry again
Day in day out it's not that bad
I worry and I worry but you'll never have to worry again
Won't have to worry again never be, alone

Alone, in my room, with a bucket full of phlegm
I don't need, a music scene, to tell me who I am
I should've got a warning
Should've came a year ago
Should I send her a birthday card?
My conscience tells me "No"

I don't need anyone, I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone to tell me what to feel
I don't need anyone, I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone to hate the world with me

Day in day out it's not that bad
I worry and I worry but you'll never have to worry again
Day in day out it's not that bad
I worry and I worry but you'll never have to worry again
Won't have to worry again never be, never be, never be alone
