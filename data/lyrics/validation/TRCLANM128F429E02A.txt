You're listening too close
With a knife in your back
You're on the attack
Did I hurt you that bad?
Youre sweating me, girl
And it's not even subtle
Oh, I am in trouble
What to do now in my world

And oh my, dear Allison
Youre running in platform shoes
And you loved it when I wore my
Evening blues
And it's love dear Allison
You're kissing with such great ease
And my lips aren't hard to please

Hey now, Allison
You are the one
Who makes boys hold their breath
As you walk on
Hey now, Allison
You are the one
Who changed my life before it had begun

So by the phone is where I'll wait
Waiting for calls
Waiting for anything (Waiting for anything)
You're hypnotizing me
With those eyes and that smile
I think I'll be here
I think I'll be here for a while

Goodnight, dear Allison
Don't try to make me cry
Just let me walk away and heal in time
Goodbye, dear Allison
We'll meet again someday
And you'll be happier this way

Hey now, Allison
You are the one (You are the one)
Who makes boys hold their breath
As you walk on (You walk on)
Hey now, Allison
You are the one
Who changed my life
Before it had begun
