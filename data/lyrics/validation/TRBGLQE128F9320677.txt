Inching nearer each and every moment
Feel the rhythm of our drums
Searching, seeking
Forward thinking
A dawning of mind that we create
A border breaking for the taking
Words that remind us to awake

I don't need a bold commandment
I've got one of my own
Stand alone
Let's watch Babylon fall, our captivity
Vices of the kingdom, exile in luxury

You'll hear the darkest voice say
Bow before, crawl beneath
Dance around my altar
If you grovel long enough
Someday I will let you be as pure

I don't need a bold commandment
I've got one of my own
Stand alone
Let's watch Babylon fall, our captivity
Vices of the kingdom, exile in luxury
