Sapphire earings in the one hand
Long stemmed rose and cash in the other
Got one last kiss on her forehead
Wonder what she's going to tell mother
Out the window to the alley
Join the sidewalk crowd and dissapear
Catch the last train to Marseilles

Theres not much more to discuss
There's you and me but there's no us
So if you would just get out of the way
I'm not sure where I'm going to go
What I'll do but this I know
That if I don't write then I'm OK

France is grey and needs a shower
Waves of fog roll by my window and
I could sleep for days on end, but
I keep hearing voices that I know
Strange, this train car makes me nervous
Even though I've got it to myself
Feels like someone watching me

I'm sure people have their talks
Say life's no(?)
But it makes no difference what they say
We had four whole months of fun
And you don't cook it when you're done
And if I don't write then I'm OK
I'm OK, I'm OK, I'm OK, I'm Ok, etc

Some things just fall apart with time
Stop acting like I committed some crime
And if I don't write, then I'm alright
I'm OK, I'm OK, I'm OK, I'm OK, etc
