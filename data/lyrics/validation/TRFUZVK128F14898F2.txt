You said no
We'll never make it together
You said no
We'll never be this forever
I wanna tell you
Stranger things have happened

You said see
This always happens to me
You said see
This never end happily
I gotta tell you
Stranger things have happened

And the minute you get what you want
You don't know what you want anymore
And the minute you want to hold on
You let go

You said go
We'll only break down and cry now
You said go
We'll never keep it alive now
Oh can you imagine
Stranger things have happened

And the minute you get what you want
You don't know what you want anymore
And the minute you want to let go
You hold on

Stranger things have happened
Stranger things have happened
