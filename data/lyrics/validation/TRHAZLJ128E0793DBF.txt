[Intro]
Oh yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
It never rained, the sun was always shinin'
And every traffic light was always green
There was a time when every door was open
And the universe was mine, or so it seemed
Every roll is seven or eleven
That it would ever end never crossed my mind
I was flyin' higher than the heavens
Back when the world was mine

[Chorus]
Sometimes a man can't see when he has it all
Take a look at me, oh how the mighty fall
Once I ruled the earth, once upon a time
When I had your love
That's when the world was mine
Oh, woah, mmm

[Verse 2]
Oh the changes I'd make if I had the power (if I had the power)
How could I have so much and be so blind
But at least for a bright and shining moment
I had you, and the world was mine

[Chorus]
Sometimes a man can't see when he has it all
Take a look at me, oh how the mighty fall
Once I ruled the earth, once upon a time
When I had your love
That's when the world was mine
Woah

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Once I ruled the earth, once upon a time
When I had your love
That's when the world was mine
When I had your love
That's when the world was mine
Oh, woah
That's when the world was mine

[Outro]
Oh
(Once I ruled the earth, once upon a time)
(When I had your love) when I had your love
(That's when the world was mine) yeah
(Once I ruled the earth) once I ruled the earth
(Once upon a time) once upon a time
(When I had your love, that's when the world was mine)
(Once I ruled the earth, once upon a time)
(When I had your love) yeah
(That's when the world was mine)
(That's when the world was mine)
(When the world was mine) yeah
