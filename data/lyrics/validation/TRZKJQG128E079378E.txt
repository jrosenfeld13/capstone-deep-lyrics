The sun goes up, the son goes down, and still my life is just spinning around
It builds me up, it drags me down, and keeps me looking for some solid ground

Hai hai, hai hai, hai hai

The race is on, the stakes are high, they want your body better dance or die
The game is up, the die is cast, this roller-coaster may well be your last

Hai hai, hai hai, hai hai

If you want to know me, if you want to know me
Won't you love me like no body ever did before

The road is long, the climb is steep, and ghosts and goblins never seem to sleep
The storm has gone, the sky is clear
But there ain't no courage when there ain't no fear
So get away, oh get away

The sun goes up, the sun goes down, and this old world is still spinning around
It fills me up, it drags me down, and keeps me looking for some solid ground

Hai hai, hai hai, hai hai

If you want to know me, if you want to know me
Won't you love me like nobody ever did before'
