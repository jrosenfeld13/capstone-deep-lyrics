Dinosaur egg, oh dinosaur egg
When will you hatch?
'Cause I got a million people coming on Friday
And they expect to see a dinosaur, not an egg

Robot slave, oh robot slave
When will you spring to life?
'Cause I got a million people coming on Friday
And I don't expect to serve them drinks myself... myself

My own reflection... oh my own reflection
Do you think anybody else thinks you're quite as handsome as I do?
Probably not 'cause they're not me, and I am biased

Solitude, sweet solitude
When will you, when will you disappear?
'Cause you're an acceptable guest sometimes
But you'll not be a long-term friend of mine

My solar body, oh my solar body
When will I join you out of this flesh?
'Cause I am sick and tired of being sick and tired
I'd much rather be a golden ball of light, but still have sex

Tortured spirit, oh tortured spirit
When will you appear?
'Cause I got a million people coming on Friday
And I don't wanna have to scare the shit out of them myself

Tortured spirit, oh tortured spirit
When will you appear?
'Cause I got a million people coming on Friday
And I don't wanna have to scare the shit out of them myself
