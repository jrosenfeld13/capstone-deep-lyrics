And it's a bad moon rising
Rising in the sky tonight
Peace there was, I'm never gonna fall in
Never gonna get inside

And it's a strange sound building
Building in the air tonight
But don't you go worryin'
Don't you go worryin'
'Cause it's gonna be all-it's gonna be all right

So the lights in Joshua's inn
And suddenly it's a sack on the city
It's a sack on the city
And the cards ran out, spelled your name

And then the drums started thundering on
Started thundering on
All night long we were playing
The same old song that you used to play
The shout went up and the walls started tumblin' down

And it's a hard rain comin' down (it's comin' down on me)
And it's a hard rain comin' down (it's comin' down on me)
And it's a hard rain comin' down (it's comin' down on me)
It's a hard rain comin' -- comin' down on you

The walls start-started to shake
Shakes started to shake
Shakes started to shake
To shake
And the walls start-started to shake
Shakes started to shake
To shake shake shake

And then the walls started tumblin' down
Started tumblin' down
Down down down and they're tumblin'
Down down down today
The shout went up and the walls started tumblin down

And it's a hard rain comin' down (it's comin' down on me)
And it's a hard rain comin' down (it's comin' down on me) (legs don't fail me now)
And it's a hard rain comin' down (it's comin' down on me)
And it's a hard rain comin' down (it's comin' down on me) (legs don't fail me now)
And it's a hard rain comin' down (it's comin' down on me)
And it's a hard rain comin'
Legs don't fail me now
Legs don't fail me now
