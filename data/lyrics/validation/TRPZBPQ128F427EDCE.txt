[Verse 1]
Wrote you this, I hope you got it safe
It's been so long I don't know what to say
I've traveled 'round through deserts on my horse
But jokes aside, I wanna come back home

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that night I said I had to go?
You said you'd meet me on the sunny road

[Chorus]
It's time, meet me on the sunny road
It's time, meet me on the sunny road

[Verse 2]
I never married, never had those kids
I loved too many, now heaven's closed its gates
I know I'm bad to jump on you like this
Some things don't change, my middle name's still 'Risk'

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that night so long long time ago
Will you still meet me on the sunny road?

[Chorus]
It's time, meet me on the sunny road
It's time, meet me on the sunny road

[Verse 3]
Well, this is it, I'm running out of space
Here is my address and number just in case
This time as one we'll find which way to go
Now come and meet me on the sunny road
