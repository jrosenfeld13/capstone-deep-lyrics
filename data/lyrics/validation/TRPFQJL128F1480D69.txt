You're my little love gun
You're my beehive stinger
I'll be you Braille if you'll
Read me every night
You are my cup of tea and
I'll drink you very slowly
You are the church of love and
Suddenly I feeling holy
It's just like you to make me
Shiver when I'm sweating
It's just like you I'm pulling
At my party frock
Its just like you to leave me
Shaking in my go-go boots
I've seen love it might be true
I've seen it it look just like you
You are my second skin
You're a birthday wish
Haven't eaten all day long and
You're my favorite dish
You're the plug and I'm the socket
I'm the moon and you're the rocket
You can sing it you can talk it
You're the change in my back pocket
Angel, I feel I'm flying with the angels
And on my naked back are soft white wings
And they will fly me to my angel
You're a present in the past. I'll unwrap
You save the paper, blinding my eyes with
A blast. The devil and the saviour. You're
The trash I should toss or the treasure
I should savor. You are everything and less
You're the rag and I'm the mess
