[Verse 1]
How could You see what You see and not totally
Want to discontinue me for all eternity and then some
It bothers me so that I could be so
Completely unaffected when connected to the holy One
And so I sit here and stare at this page and wonder
At what age it will become clear to me
So for now I am clueless to how You do this
And how You move this Spirit in me

[Chorus]
I'm going Your way
Even though I cannot see in front of me
I'm going Your way
Even though I feel lost at sea, yeah

[Verse 2]
How could Your favor be the flavor I savor
When the fruits of my labor are so unfavorable
And old pages are setting the stages for something outrageous
A Man who can save all our souls
And You know and You know, You know
And You know, You know

[Chorus]
I'm going Your way
Even though I cannot see in front of me
Oh, and I'm going Your way
Even though I feel lost at sea
Lost at sea, yeah

Ba-da-da-da-dum-da-dum
Lost at sea

[Verse 3]
Ride the wave, wave goodbye
By the way did I mention today that I don't know the way home
So could You take me by the hand and lead me to the dryer land
So I can finally breathe again instead of sinking like a stone
And now I will diligently and not religiously, but affectionately come
Before the throne of Your grace in this place and seek Your face
For all eternity and then some

[Chorus]
I'm going Your way, yes-yes
Even though I cannot see in front of me
Yeah, I'm going Your way
Even though I feel lost at sea
Lost at sea, yeah

[Interlude]
Mmm-mmm
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Mmm, yeah
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

[Chorus]
I'm going Your way, yeah
Even though I cannot see in front of me
Oh, and I'm going Your way, way
Even though I feel lost at sea
Lost at sea, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Lost at sea
