YW+D:
It's time for Animaniacs
And we're really making tracks
Let's go all around the earth
From Alaska down to Perth
We're travelin' maniacs

Come join us on our journey
As we race around the globe
You may meet an attorney
Or an Eskimo named Joe
We'll go to Bora Bora
Or maybe Kokomo
We promise not to bore ya
But of course you never know

We're travelin' maniacs
From Bombay to Halifax

Y+D:
Board a bus or take a yak
Or just jump on Wakko's back
And don't forget the snacks

YW+D:
From Canada to Paraguay
And places in between
From India to Mozambique
You'll see just what we mean
It's fun to visit countries
That you have never seen
But if you drink the water there
You might turn slightly green

We're travelin' maniacs
With our knapsacks on our backs
We'll leave raisins in our tracks
From the trail mix in our slacks
We're Animane-y
Totally insane-y

Dot:
Let's not miss our plane-y

YW+D:
Animaniacs!
Bring your backpacks!
