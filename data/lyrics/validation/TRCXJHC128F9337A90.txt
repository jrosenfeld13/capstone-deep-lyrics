Pain's temporary glory's forever
We all know chicks dig scars
I've done my time with broken bottles
And been kicked outta my share of bars
We've been ridiculed and critisized
For doin things our own way
But we won't back down we'll stand strong
So get the fuck outta my way

Cuz we live and we die by the
L.C.B. Army
We live and we die for the
L.C.B. Army

People talk shit for no reason at all
But what the fuck do they know?
You don't like me you don't like my band
Get the fuck away from our shows
We got our army they've got the spirit
As they crowd around the dance floor
The army knows as well as we do
We'd rather be hated than ignored
