Last night while I was asleep I washed away my pores
And had my last conversation with you the way I usually can
There were whirling little spinners that tickle the rough of my hands
And a weekend exchange but I want you to know just in case
You wanted me to take your hand

Well I can see the blazing good
And my love for your mellow soul
And I can't hate you cause you're free
And you'll be wealthy when you're old

Kissing in the flaccid points between our sin soaked night
And we spin wax with the favoring dream mixing our heads up with weak
There were moments which I would regret and then later ask why
And when I went outside as if nobody knew but the sky
To whom I made shady deals regarding money and girls

Well I can't be done with cheap thrills
And when I thought I felt safe
While I could scrape at my old love
There was a mountain of new taste

Hey motion eye, oh how you've turned into a certain type
Of ugly person when your ship has sailed
Then all of your shit will fly away
