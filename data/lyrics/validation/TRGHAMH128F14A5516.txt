Well, I know a lady in Alabam'
And one or two in Louisian'
And when my troubles feel like the weight of the world
I go to the arms of those southern girls

And get that Southern comfort Whenever my soul hurts
Southern comfort, It makes me feel so fine

A Mississippi miss will set you free
And so will those ladies up in Tennessee
And if you ain't had yourself a Georgia kiss
You don't know what you have missed

I love that southern comfort whenever my soul hurts
Southern comfort It makes me feel so fine

--- Instrumental ---

So here's to the ladies with the soft Texas drawls
And all of those beauties in Arkansas
From up in Kentucky to Caroline
I'll never get you off of my mind

I love your southern comfort whenever my soul hurts
Southern comfort It makes me feel so fine

I love your southern comfort Whenever my soul hurts
Southern comfort It makes me feel so fine

So fine...
