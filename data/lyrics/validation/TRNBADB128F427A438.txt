All the same take me away
We're dead to the world

The child gave thought to the poet's world
Gave comfort to the fallen
Heartfelt, Lovelorn

Remaining, yet still uninvited
Those words scented my soul
Lonely soul, Ocean soul

It's not the monsters under your bed
It is the man next door
That makes you fear, makes you cry
Makes you cry for the child
All the wars are fought among those lonely men
Unarmed, unscarred

I don't want to die a scarless man
A lonely soul
Tell me now what to do

I studied silence to learn the music
I joined the sinful to regain innocence

Heaven queen, cover me
In all that blue
Little boy, such precious joy
Is dead to the world

Heaven queen, carry me
Away from all pain
All the same take me away
We're dead to the world

Dead, silent, constant
Yet always changing
- My favorite view of this world

As he died, he will return to die in me again
Weaving the cloth
Giving birth to the Century child
Who gave his life not for the world
But for me.. innocence reborn once more

Heaven queen, carry me..
Away from all pain
All the same take me away
We're dead to the world

Heaven queen, cover me
In all that blue
Little boy, such precious joy
Is dead to the world

Heaven queen, carry me
Away from all pain
All the same take me away
We're dead to the world

We're Dead To The World
