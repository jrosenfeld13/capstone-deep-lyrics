[Verse 1]
This may seem all too confusing
How I could walk away from something so rare
But you see it got too demanding, yeah
And I just didn't care, I just didn't care, if I cared, if I cared

Lately, I've been left wanting, but not wanting you
Attraction that once was is no longer there, ooh
And it sucks to be taken for granted
When the veil is drawn so there is only air

[Chorus]
I had to walk away
Give up something I love
For what I loved even more
And save my tears for you

[Solo - Mustaine]

[Verse 2]
Everything has lost its meaning, I had to let it go
To find myself, myself, and start something new, brand new
Forced to look deep in the mirror, face who I really am
Now it's just me, because I can't afford you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I gave up something I love
For what I loved even more
And save my tears for you
In a vial and walked away

[Solo - Mustaine]
[Solo - Poland]

[Verse 4]
You were so beautiful to look upon
I could see the light in your smile
Your eyes were the windows into your soul
Your body was heavenly just like the sky

[Solo - Mustaine]

[Verse 5]
Until all your good looks betrayed you, which wasn't much
Counted on your counterfeit smiles for too long
Your eyes are empty windows, broken
The body may be here but the soul is gone

[Outro]
I saved my tears for you in a vial
From everything wicked thing that you did, that you said
To send away, buried with your love
So many tears in a vial, now that you're gone, and now that you're dead
