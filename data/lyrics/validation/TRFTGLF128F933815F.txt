Now that were through
I guess youll be leaving
To pastures new
Well, I wont be grieving

Light outta darkness
Dreams outta dust
Knowing that you
Sold out my trust

Well, I cant be part of that tragedy
Knowing that youre so wrong for me

Im never through
Through with believing
Seems that its true;
You were deceiving

Light outta darkness
Dreams outta dust
Lucky in life
If not in love

Well, I cant be a part of this tragedy
Cause you and I were never meant to be
