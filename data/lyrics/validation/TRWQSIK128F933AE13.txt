Down a spray paint back alley
I look up at the sky
And I see through red eyes
The seagulls wheel around and around

Worn out couches and fridges
And mongrel dogs roam free
There are rags and there are riches
Inside this head for me

We drink cheap English cider
And smoke hashish from North Africa
I've been tryin' to get the mix right
But I haven't got it right tonight

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

I've a fifteen year old mustache
I'm so desperate for to be a man
People tell me to shave it off
If I shave it I'm a boy again

Watch my father and my brother
Fixing old cars
And their rough oil stained hands
Are skilled and scarred

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

Behind this big rusty shed door
There's a punch bag and a clapped out car
As the car sits on breeze blocks
The punch bag takes some heavy shots

Down the lane way sniffin' petrol
I thought pebble dash was snow
As I stumbled in a blizzard
The pain inside me disappeared

Cross the city down the alleys
A thousand kids like me
They are watching through red eyes
The flock of little birds gracefully gliding by

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

Fought in the lane, lost in the lane
Swallowed the shame, then I fought again
Fought in the lane, cried in the lane
Swallowed the pain, then I fought again

Fell in the lane, got back up in the lane
Died in the lane, and came alive again

We are all in the gutter
But some of us are looking at the stars
We are all in the gutter
But some of us are looking at the stars

We are all in the gutter
But some of us are looking at the stars
We are all in the gutter
But some of us are looking at the stars
The stars, ooh the stars, the stars
