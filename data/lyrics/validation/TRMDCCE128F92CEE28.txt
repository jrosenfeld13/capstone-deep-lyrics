Nobody said this club is closing
Too many hipsters on the dancefloor vogueing
Too many blue jeans standing on the outside ring
Watch me now, watch my body twisting
Forget yourself - nobody's watching
And let the heavy rhythm guide you let it help you swing

Don't touch the fader DJ, don't touch the fader
Don't stop the beat, keep on the accelerator
Keep it up, keep it up, keep it up for me
Don't touch the fader DJ, don't touch the fader
Don't stop the beat, keep on the accelerator
Keep it up, keep it up, keep it up for me

The fashionistas in the tight washed
The pop boys popping in the neons (dance)
Too many people so we rock upon the outside ring
The speaker speak into my body
The rhythm sneaking up and through me
We gotta lotta getting down to do
Are you with me?

Don't touch the fader DJ, don't touch the fader
Don't stop the beat, keep on the accelerator
Keep it up, keep it up, keep it up for me
Don't touch the fader DJ, don't touch the fader
Don't stop the beat, keep on the accelerator
Keep it up, keep it up, keep it up for me

Keep it up, getting down, keep it up, getting down
