If you'd only listen to what I can't say
I told you to leave 'cause I was in your way
And even if it ends it still will feel the same
I don't what it is but I will have to change
Ohh will it always be this hard
Will it always be this hard to live
Why can't I happy with the list there is
All that I can think of is what I will miss
Nothing's really fun unless we're two to play
But I'm a lost cause and you should stay away
Ohh will it always be this hard
Will it always be this hard to live
