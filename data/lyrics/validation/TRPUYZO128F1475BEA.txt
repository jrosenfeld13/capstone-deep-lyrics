Do anything you want
But never find the heart to leave me
Cos I need you too much
So play your game but don't desert me
You're being hurt, undone
True lovin baby please believe me

Don't be afraid to trust me
I wouldn't trade you for the world
And if you feel you've gotta test me
Before you'll be my girl

Well you can take me, you can break me
But you can't make me (kill my love)
Cos that's the only thing I won't do for you

Cos I say too much
I am rehearsed so please forgive me
Well I can't help but touch
For please so keep inside you in me
I threw away my crutch
I'm not a boy you dare to see me

Don't be afraid to try me
C'mon and give a guy a whirl
And if you feel you've gotta test me
Before you'll be my girl

Well you can take me, you can break me
But you can't make me (kill my love)
Cos that's the only thing I won't do for you

I was makin lotta time o' mine
So now you take me to the other side
I wanna get somewhere inside your world
So come on away girl
