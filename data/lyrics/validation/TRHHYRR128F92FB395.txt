I don't need to know
Why the oceans blue or how the flowers grow
I don't need to live
Waiting on someone to forgive me for my sins

Like my father before me
I'm a working man a working man

But I don't need to believe in something that won't save my sanity

No I don't need I don't need to know no I don't need to know
I don't need to know I don't need to know

I don't want to live in a world where faces change from day to day
I don't want my life to be
So full of doubt and misery

The years now pass without a trace
It's something that I'm learning to embrace
How most black nights are spent awake
Thinking about how I don't want to live that way

No I don't want to live
I don't want to live

I don't know but I've been told
If you don't believe the devil owns your soul
If this is the truth then to hell I go
Cause I don't need to know
