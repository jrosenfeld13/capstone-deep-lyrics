Coming so far from it all
Wondering how this came so fast
With every breath trying not to fall
In retracing the steps of our past

The beginning was thought the end
Losing every ability to pretend
Forcing down the rising words
Of everything we wanted heard

Now that I've found my call
I'm going through it all
Sure of nothing more, nothing less

I'm going through it all! [x3]

I'm going...

Through it all!
The beginning was thought the end
Losing every ability to pretend
Forcing down the rising words

Knowing now that I've found my call
Sure of nothing more, nothing less

A story still unfinished
And then the plot thickens

Prepare me Father. Show me how

Lead me to lead, Feed me to feed [x3]

And this goes to show
Everything you're hoping
You already know
