"you fucking cunts"
Sally called, when she got the word
She said 'I suppose you've heard about Alice.'
So, I rushed to the window, and I looked outside
And I could hardly believe my eyes
A big limousine pulled slowly into Alice's drive

I don't why why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't wanna know
'Cause for twenty four years I've been living next door to Alice
Twenty four years, just waitin' for a chance
To tell her how I'm feeling, maybe get a second glance
Now I've gotta get used to not living next door to Alice

We grew up together, two kids in the park
Carved our initials deep in the bark...
Me and Alice
Now she walks to the door with her head held high
And just for a moment, I caught her eye
As the big limousine pulled slowly out of Alice's drive

I don't why why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't wanna know
'Cause for twenty four years I've been living next door to Alice
Twenty four years, just waitin' for a chance
To tell her how I'm feeling, maybe get a second glance
Now I've gotta get used to not living next door to Alice

Then Sally called back, and asked how I felt
She said 'I know how to help get over Alice.'
She said 'Now, Alice is gone, but I'm still here
And you know I've been waiting twenty four years...'
And the big limousine disappeared...

I don't why why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't wanna know
'Cause for twenty four years I've been living next door to Alice
Twenty four years, just waitin' for a chance
To tell her how I feel and maybe get a second glance
But I'll never get used to not living next door to Alice

No, I'll never get used to not living next door to Alice...
