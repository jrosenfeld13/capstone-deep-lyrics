Magentalane
(John Woloschuk / Dino Tome)

My my what a lovely day
Could it be that we've arrived in fair Magentalane
There were times, many times
When I thought we wouldn't make it
I was quite prepared to take it like a man
But here I am

Aye aye bring our best champagne
We will drink a toast, you and I, to fair Magentalane
Now let me see well shouldn't I make a speech
Or say something in Greek
Perhaps recite a browning poem, but why
When the only thing that is on my mind is
It feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good to be back at home

In Magentalane
Where the sea of pink champagne flows
Magentalane
Under rose colored bainrows
I mean rainbows

Yes there were times, several times
I was sure we had been defeated
As our Hopes became depleted through the years
But now we are here

So if you please it is time to take our leave
The road to liberty awaits us on the aerodrome incline
Gonna leave that bad old world behind
Because it feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good to be back at home
