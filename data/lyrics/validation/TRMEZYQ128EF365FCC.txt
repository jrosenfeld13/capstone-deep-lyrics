Well they said you are as good as you look but that would be impossible
For you look better than the face of God on a sunny day
You look good enough to eat but I've had a bellyful
And now I have this bill I don't wanna pay

How was it for you. (7 times)

Do you really need that drink to disarm defences
Can you never face the flak when you're in control
Well I don't believe my luck I am defenceless
Do with me what you want but don't tell a soul
Don't tell my soul

How was it for you 7 times)

If you ain't out of your head can you ever enjoy yourself
But if you ain't ni your head then who's at home?
I'm so possessed by sex I could destroy my health
We could be dancing over coals and we'd never know
We'd never know

How was it for you. (7 times)

Where did you get those clothes
Are you sure they're still fashionable?
The sell-by date on the label says says '68
Where did you steal those riffs and that bad attitude
You are travelling back in time to an altered state

How was it for you. (7 times)

Was it as good as it was for me
Well that's the best it's ever been
And you're the best I've ever seen

How was it for you
