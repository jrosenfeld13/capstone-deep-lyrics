I went to the river to water my horse I couldn't find the river just rode across
On that drifting shifting Texas sand
Texas sand drifting Texas sand Sandy land down by the Rio Grande
Well sand in my coffee sand in my tea when I die they're gonna bury me
Deep in that drifting shifting Texas sand
( steel )
Texas sand drifting Texas sand Sandy land down by the Rio Grande
I went to the river to water my horse I couldn't find the river just rode across
On that drifting shifting Texas sand
( steel )
Well sand in my coffee sand in my tea...
