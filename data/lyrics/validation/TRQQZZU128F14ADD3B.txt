I met a girl named Tara
She lived in the heart of America
She liked black caddies
Listened to Cinder puff daddy
Danced until her legs were sore

She worked around the corner
At the diner with the grouchy owner
And her boyfriend's Shady, dates another girl named Katie
He loves her definitely maybe

Don't think I can take it
Wake me when it's over
Seems so far away
I wish that it was closer
I see her every day
I'm too scared to go over
I wonder what she'd say
I barely even know her

And how much longer
Will this keep getting stronger
I wonder what she's doing when im singing myself to sleep
Cause he's a faker
So see ya later
I wonder when you'll realize that she means a lot more to me

I saw you in the hallway when my last class was just over
It was friday, school was out tonight
Everything seems to be all right
I said, "yo, are you going to the party at the cove,"
She said he's picking me up at six again
And I don't wanna disappoint my boyfriend

And she's staring at his picture hanging in her locker
She's telling all the girls about all the things that he bought her
I saw what really happened all those times he went for water
When we were at the movie theater watching Harry Potter
He had his hands on
Every single girl he laid his eyes on
Hate to break it to you, he's a pylon
And even when he kissed her
He was looking over, staring at her sister

And how much longer
Will this keep getting stronger
I wonder what she's doing when im singing myself to sleep
Cause he's a faker
So see ya later
I wonder when you'll realize that she means a lot more to me
