My kisses wake her in the night
When she turns I'm not there
I wouldn't have left if I had known
That she'd be left all by her lone
It took my breath when she was mine
I wish my hands could turn back time
And now she can't believe I'm gone
She still thinks I'm coming home

[Hook]
She thinks I'm coming home (x4)

I wanted you to be my bride
But you didn't feel the same inside
You never heard a thing I said
Oh how could I be so misled
And all the time we spent together
I thought that we would turn out better
You took my breath, one of a kind
My one and only valentine

[Hook]
She thinks I'm coming home (x4)

Your love is killing me, now I don't have to cry anymore
Your love is killing me, now I don't have to cry anymore
Your love is killing me, now I don't have to cry anymore
Your love is killing me, now I don't have to cry anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore

I hope you understand this letter
But noone ever lives forever
I wanted you to be my wife
I trade my heart in for my life
It makes me sad to have to say
That I'm not coming home today
Cause I can't live with or without you
I had to take my life away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away
