Goodbye
So long
Well there's a lady that knows
All that glitters is not gold, she said
"Don't play that awful song
Don't play that awful song, cos then we'll know
That the party has gone on too long."
I said, "This stairway ain't to heaven
This one's to oblivion"
She said "You get too drunk, you get too high
Oh tell me why
Sod this, I'm going home on my own."
Goodbye
So long
