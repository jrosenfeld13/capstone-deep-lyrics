A prison called
Social welfare
Weaknesses lead to riots
Some tenants never left the green
Never left the green

Empty riots still reflected
And still they cause
Empty riots still inflected
With dubious scores

The smiling presidents
A living toothpaste commercial

Checking the constitution
The constitution
Degenerate peace force
Kiss your record kiss your minds
Adventures and exhaulance
Equipment up to date

Too busy giving orders
Too busy for the state
Death in the rainforest
Death in the rainforest

Intelligence still (grows?) static
Makes me feel sick
Makes me feel sick

A thousand steel drums for the states
A thousand steel drums for the states
A thousand steel drums for you
A thousand steel drums for you
A thousand steel drums for you (Optimized v1.2)
A million steel drums for you!

How (Optimized v1.2)

For you! (MY-1)
For you! (MY-1)

A thousand steel drums for you! (Optimized v1.2)
