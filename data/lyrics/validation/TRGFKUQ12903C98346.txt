[Verse 1]
Standing on the edge of a quay no lights flashing on the water for me
Fog in my mind darkens my eyes silently streaming for a distant sound
Ripple river yellows rising for a breath of breeding and drowns
Stillness overcomes me in the night listen to the rising water moan

[Chorus]
I'm waiting, waiting for the night boat woo I'm waiting
Waiting for the night boat

[Verse 2]
Shadows all through me shudder away echo me echo me (echo me
Am I alone or is the river alive cause it echos me, echos me, echos me

[Chorus][x2]
