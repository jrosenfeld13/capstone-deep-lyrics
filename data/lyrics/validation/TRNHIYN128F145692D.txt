Sometimes I think of what I could've been
And then I kick myself
Knowing that I've ended up
Just like him and

Remember the time he caught us in your room
Your hands were down my underwear
And your tig ol' bitties glistening in the air
With the zip of my pants
Well I headed for the door
And with the swing of his fist
You were laid out on the floor and

Involuntary Self defence
Call it what you will
How can we go on
Where do we go from here
Involuntary Self defence
Call it what you will
How can we go on
Where do we go from here

Involuntary Self defence
Call it what you will
How can we go on
Where do we go from here
Involuntary Self defence
Call it what you will
How can we go on
Where do we go from here

Involuntary Self defence
Call it what you will
How can we go on
Where do we go from here
Involuntary Self defence
Call it what you will
How can we go on
Where do we go from here
