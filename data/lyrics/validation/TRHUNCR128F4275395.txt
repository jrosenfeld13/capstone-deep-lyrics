Set me off you can calculate pushing me
Tormented by the agony of everyday
Died, dissolve, descend I'm by myself I'm by myself
Again! Don't you touch me
Swallow me, swallow me up, and take me now out of my inside
Set me free, I've had enough, and let me out of this abyss right now
And as this life defeats me I need to simplify
And everything that beats me I need to purify
Fuck you all, fuck everyone and everything
You don't know me and you wouldn't want to anyway
Force into the end I fucked myself I fucked myself
Again, I am nothing, again, fuck everything
Suffer, we will inside
