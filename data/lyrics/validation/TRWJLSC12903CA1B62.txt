To walk down the street
More then the ground movin' under my feet
I need a shadow to move me on down the line
A sad Cinderella with a heart full of holes
A barbell in her tongue

And the night is so young
So play old Virginia on your clarinet
And I light the wrong end of a wet cigarette
Goin' backwards over the balcony

I lay down laughin', man I woke up cryin'
The silver moon comes through your glowin' blinds
I see the light and go right to the devil
You can't take it with you when you go
Oh no, la la la la

It's three in the morning when the bottle comes down
And ooh the razor goes around
But your time is your time
And nothing will change nothing will change
Gimme a dollar and I'll say it again
Here comes nothin'

Now it's going once going twice
The demon is doing his bidding, who am I kidding?
To be in this all night dream
I wind up strumming on my old guitar
The only tune I even know so far

I see the light and go right to the devil
You can't take it with you when you go
Oh no, la la la la
