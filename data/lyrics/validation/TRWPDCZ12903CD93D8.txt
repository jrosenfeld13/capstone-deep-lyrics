Hazel O'Connor - Major Black

Time after time, I will follow you
I lay myself on the line, I'll always try for you
Because you, you are my inspiration
You, you are my destination

That's why time after time I choose you

Night after night, I have dreamed of you
I see your smile, see your face, how can I ever hide from you
Because you, you are my inspiration
You, you are my destination

Time after time, I will follow you

I lay myself on the line, I'd even die for you
Because you, you are my inspiration
You, you are my destination

That's why time after time I choose you
Time after time I choose you
Time after time
