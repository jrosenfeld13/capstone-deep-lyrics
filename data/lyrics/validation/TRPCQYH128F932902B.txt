Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'?
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the blue bird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married? We'll say no man
But you can do the job when you're in town
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonderland
