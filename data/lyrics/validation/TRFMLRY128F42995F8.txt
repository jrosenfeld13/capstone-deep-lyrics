See the days get shorter now
A frozen river slow
Well honesty is only a reflex action
You lost years ago

Save the good songs for the good times
There's still work to do
Close you eyes now gently
And hold out your hands

The village idiot meets and greets
Shaking hands for votes
Join the procession that's clogging our streets
And feel the fumes in your throat

Save the good songs for the good times
There's still work to do
Close you eyes now gently
And hold out your hands

You're all asleep at the wheel

You're all asleep at the wheel
You're all asleep at the wheel
You're all asleep at the wheel
You're all asleep...
