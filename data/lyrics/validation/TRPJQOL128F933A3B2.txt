[Prerena]
Flying high in my dreams
Give me some clarity
Flying high in my dreams
Hoping they'd set me free
Set...me...free

[Prashun] (intro)
Get up now...
And no more can you snore...
But instead leave your bed...
It's time to go!

[Prashun]
(verse 1)

As the sun rises, the fun dies
Is this real or just some lies
I wish it wasn't. Just give me five
More minutes in my dreams, one last time

The alarm's buzzing, Someone stop it, please
My head hurts as if stung by honey bees
Wake Up! What's for breakfast? Bread & cheese?
Had that yesterday and day before. Geez!

Can't sulk now, got a bus to catch
For a pain in the ass, there ain't no match
Just a second late and off it goes
Gotta get a cab and give him all my cash

But the ride's not smooth. Such bumpy roads
So the driver takes it easy and drives it slow
But time's running fast like the do-si-do
By the hands on my watch and here we go

[Shubhankar]
(Chorus)

Must plan out what's in it for me
Maybe not a thing
Just the little things are all I want

Love, need my own space
But it's not the case
Oh Oh Oh No No No!

Just cannot let it screw my day
What else can I say
Gotta find way out of it all

Man, I can't get away
Stuck in this for days

God, find a way out!

No way out! No way out! (x8)

[Prashun]
(verse 2)

The boss seems angry.He is always
What can I do now? Oh yeah! False praise
"That an awesome tie, boss! You got a cool taste."
But it never works. All you get's a cold gaze

Damn, the cubicle! I have claustrophobia
And the deadlines have come also so near
Gotta pass this test and get my head clear
Already got two 'F's. Frustration & Fear!

Then my gal calls up, "How you doing, love?
How about a movie tonight, honey?" Ow!
Final nail in the coffin, cause I'm really broke now
Can't afford to say yes or even out the phone down

Get me outta here to Paris or Vegas
Just me, myself & I. We'd celebrate us
But I can't. I'm not that rich and famous
All I finally do is update my facebook status

[Shubhankar]
(Chorus)

Must plan out what's in it for me
Maybe not a thing
Just the little things are all I want

Love, need my own space
But it's not the case
Oh Oh Oh No No No!

Just cannot let it screw my day
What else can I say
Gotta find way out of it all

Man, I can't get away
Stuck in this for days

God, find a way out!

No way out! No way out! (x16)
