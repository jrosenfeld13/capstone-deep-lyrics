We found a house
With a yard
And moved all of my things in
And most of your things in
And honey I was proud of it
Yeah honey I was proud of, you...

You quote the good book
When it's convenient
But you don't have the sense
No you don't have the sense
To tie your tangled tongue
Instead you slash it through the mud

And some boxes
And hand me down couch, and chair
They used to be at your church
We borrowed them from there
And cabinet-record player
With nothin' but James Taylor
Tore the carpets from the corners
To put in that hardwood floor
I'd be a fool to have asked for more

You quote the good book
When it's convenient
But you don't have the sense
No you don't have the sense
To tie your tangled tongue
Instead you slash it through the mud

The love you had but couldnt name
The past that we were stuck between
Beside myself I stopped to think
Lord, what have I done?

You quote the good book
When it's convenient
But you don't have the sense
No you don't have the sense
To tie your tangled tongue
Instead you slash it through the mud
