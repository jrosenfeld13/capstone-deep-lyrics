(BeBe Winans, Rhett Lawrence, Travon Potts)
Thank you Thank you...
The key to my emotions
You keep me going strong
The source of my solution
When things are going wrong
When my life's uncertain
There's no place I'd rather be
Then standing here beside you
'Cause your love always comforts me

Chorus:
Thank you, Thank you
Thanks for being a friend
Thank you, Thank you
Over and over again
Thank you, Thank you
I could never repay
The love you're sending my way, my way
Thank you, Thank you
Something else I wanna tell you
You are my salvation, yes you are
Don't you know you're everything
Set my feet to dancing
When I think of all you've done for me
Chorus
Here and now my heart's proclamation
You are awesome and true
You've been better to me than I've been to myself
Always give thanks to you, to you
Right now I wanna thank you for all that you've done for me
Right now I wanna thank you for taking good care of me
Right now I wanna thank you for all that you mean to me
Right now, right now, yeah, said right now
No doubt about it, I can't live without your love
