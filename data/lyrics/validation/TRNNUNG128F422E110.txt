Someday, right away
Hey you out there
I'd know you anywhere
Your smile can't hide the pain
Your eyes give you away
Seems love has gone again
It happens now and then
Suddenly the one you need
No longer wants you
But if you can find the heart to let it go
CHORUS
Someday love (will come back to you)
Someday love (will come shining through)
Someday love will be the reason
You've got to keep believin', someday love
Maybe it's much too soon
To try to comfort you
The words won't set you free
When love's a memory
Oh but don't forget
Your life's not over yet
Even the darkest night
Can't last forever
And just keep in mind the sun will shine again
Someday love (will come back to you)
Someday love (will come shining through)
Someday love will be the freedom
That will always keep you dreamin'
CHORUS
Someday love, someday's love
Someday love will be the freedom
That will always kep you dreamin'
(repeat til fade)
