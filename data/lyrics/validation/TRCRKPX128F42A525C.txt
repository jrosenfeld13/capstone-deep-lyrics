[Verse 1]
Two weeks away, feels like the whole world should have changed
But I'm home now and things still look the same
I think I'll leave it till tomorrow to unpack
Try to forget for one more night that I'm back in my flat

[Pre-Chorus]
On the road where the cars never stop
Going through the night
To a life where I can't watch the sunset
I don't have time, I don't have time

[Chorus]
I've still got sand in my shoes
And I can't shake the thought of you
I should get on, forget you
But why would I want to?
I know we said goodbye
Anything else would've been confused
But I wanna see you again

[Verse 2]
Tomorrow's back to work and down to sanity
Should run a bath and then clear up the mess I made before I left here
Try to remind myself that I was happy here before
I knew that I could get on a plane and fly away

[Pre-Chorus]
From the road where the cars never stop
Going through the night
To a life where I can watch the sunset
And take my time, take all our time

[Chorus]
I've still got sand in my shoes
And I can't shake the thought of you
I should get on, forget you
But why would I want to?
I know we said goodbye
Anything else would've been confused
But I wanna see you again
I wanna see you again
I wanna see you again

[Bridge]
Two weeks away, all it takes
To change and turn me around I've fallen
I walked away and never said
That I wanted to see you again

[Chorus]
I've still got sand in my shoes
And I can't shake the thought of you
I should get on, forget you
But why would I want to?
I know we said goodbye
Anything else would've been confused
But I wanna see you again
I've still got sand in my shoes
And I can't shake the thought of you
I should get on, forget you
But why would I want to?
I know we said goodbye
Anything else would've been confused
But I wanna see you again
I wanna see you again
I wanna see you again
