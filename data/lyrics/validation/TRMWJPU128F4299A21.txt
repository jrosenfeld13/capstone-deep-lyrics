If I said it, I meant it
I'm not really demented
I'm just saying it's been said again and again
Not that I'm all that grounded
I'm already dumbfounded
I'm a liar believe me, baby

Well it's all that you are
You're just one shining star
Well that's all that you are

Maybe everything's changed
And maybe I stayed the same
What does it matter to me now, anyway
If I ever regret it
If I'm ever repentant
Karma sings and we'll dance the dance, baby

Well that's all that you are
Your just one shining star
Well it's all that you are
You're just one shining star

Do do do do yeah yeah yeah (x3)

If I said it, I meant it
I'm not really demented
I'm just saying it's been said again and again
Not that I'm all that grounded
I'm already dumbfounded
I'm a liar believe me, baby

Well it's all that you are
You're just one shining star
Well it's all that you are
You're just one shining star
(It's all that you are)
Well it's all that you are
You're just one shining star
