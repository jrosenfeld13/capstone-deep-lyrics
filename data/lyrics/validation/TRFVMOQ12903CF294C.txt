How how can it be
That a love carved out of caring
Fashioned by fate could suffer so hard from the games played once too often
But making mistakes is a part of life's imperfection
Born of the years
Is it so wrong to be human after all?

Drawn into the stream of undefined illusion
Those diamond dreams
They can't disguise the truth
That there is something about you baby so right
I wouldn't be here without you baby tonight

If ever our love was concealed
No one can say that we didn't feel a million things
And a perfect dream of life

Gone, fragile but free
We remain tender together
If not so in love, it's not so wrong
We're only human after all

These changing years
They add to your confusion
Oh and you need to hear the time that told the truth
Because there's something about you baby so right
I wouldn't be here without you baby tonight
