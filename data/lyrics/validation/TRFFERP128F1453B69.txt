[Verse 1]
"You know who I am," he said
The speaker was an angel
He coughed and shook his crumpled wings
Closed his eyes and moved his lips
"It's time we should be going"

[Chorus]
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, driven by the night
Til you come
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, see it in my eyes
Til you come

[Verse 2]
No one seemed to hear him
So he leafed through a magazine
And, yawning, rubbed the sleep away
Very sane he seemed to me

[Chorus]
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, driven by the night
Til you come
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, feel it in my voice
Til you come

[Outro]
(Waiting so long, ahhh...)
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
(Waiting so long)
