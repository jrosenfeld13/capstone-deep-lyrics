Keep it together now
As you wish as you know how
It'll all work out
When nothing ever seems to be
Exactly what you need now
Hold fast now, to drench yourself and last

All that you know
Is all that you've figured out
But you'll never land again
Until you stop falling down

Don't let yourself wither now
Perpindicular to the ground
It'll all work out
And don't ever doubt the days
As if they're not apt to change now
It'll all come around
So brace yourself and last

All that you know
Is all that you've figured out
But you'll never land again
Until you stop falling down

So alive
Even cut down to size
We're here to recognize
Our place in time
The role we play, the days we make
And the ones made without
Us around
We all must carry on
When we can't carry on
With what we want now

All that you know
Is all that you've figured out
But you'll never land again
Until you stop falling down
