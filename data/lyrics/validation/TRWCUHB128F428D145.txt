[Verse 1]
Where the rain don't fall and the grass don't grow
The older part of New Mexico
I drifted into town one day
And stumbled in on a lost cafe
Shades were pulled and the door was locked
Something made me knock
Time stood still when she opened the door
I didn't know where I was anymore
And we were lost in each other's eyes
Where loneliness meets paradise
Something in my heart broke free
Blowing wind as the tumbleweed

[Chorus]
Somewhere north of heaven
Where eagles fear to fly
Where the sun burns hot as the devil's gate
The desert meets the sky
Tattooed on my memory is the image of an angels face
North of heaven, south of Santa Fe

[Verse 2]
Bad news tends to travel fast
I was running from my past
I left her when their morning broke
Truth is I never let her go
I'm still running free
But in my heart I'll always be

[Chorus]
