It's a shame
Shame
Shame
Second time it's never the same

It's a shame
Shame
Shame
If you wanna do it again
Last night you said: Please
Don't go

Last night you said: I wanna know for sure

Two steps from heaven
High on a mountain top

Two steps from heaven
I just can't get enough
It's a shame
Shame
Shame
Second time it's never the same

It's a shame
Shame
Shame
If you wanna do it again
True love will never die
True love will never die

True love will never die if it's true

It's a shame
Shame
Shame
Second time it's never the same

It's a shame
Shame
Shame
If you wanna do it aaain
First time so real
I just wanna know how you feel

First time you said: I wanna know for sure

Two steps from heaven
High on a mountain top

True love will never die
True love will never die
True love will never die
