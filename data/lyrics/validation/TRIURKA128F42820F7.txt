I repent, i repent of my pursuit of america's dream
I repent, i repent of living like i deserve anything
Of my house, my fence, my kids, my wife
In our suburb where we're safe and white
I am wrong and of these things i repent

I repent, i repent of parading my liberty
I repent. i repent of paying for what i get for free
And for the way i believe that i am living right
By trading sins for others that are easier to hide
I am wrong and of these things i repent

I repent judging by a law that even i can't keep
Of wearing righteousness like a disguise
To see through the planks in my own eyes

I repent, i repent of trading truth for false unity
I repent, i repent of confusing peace and idolatry
By caring more of what they think than what i know of what we need
By domesticating you until you look just like me
I am wrong and of these things i repent
