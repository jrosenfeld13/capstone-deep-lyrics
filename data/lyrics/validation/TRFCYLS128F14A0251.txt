In the morning I open my eyes
I'm lost in love and I wonder why
Will I ever happen to see you again
Will you ever come back to me in the end

It's the morning of loneliness
It's the morning of emptiness
But I'm reaching up for the lie of pain
Reaching up, I'm running away!

I am ready to fly
I feel so high
I am ready to go
I lost control
I am ready to fly
I touch the sky
I am ready to fly... (2x)

Everytime when it seems like the end
Then I think of you and I'm happy again
Yes, and everywhere I lay in my head
I will dream of you and I'm no longer sad

It's the morning of loneliness
It's the morning of emptiness
But I'm reaching up for the lie of pain
Reaching up, I'm running away!

I am ready to fly
I feel so high
I am ready to go
I lost control
I am ready to fly
I touch the sky
I am ready to fly... (2x)

In the morning I open my eyes
I'm lost in love and I wonder why
Will I ever happen to see you again
Will you ever come back to me in the end
