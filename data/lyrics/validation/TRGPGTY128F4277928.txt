[Verse 1]
I'm in love with Mary Jane
She's my main thing
She makes me feel all right
She makes my heart sing

[Hook 1]
And when I'm feeling low
She comes as no surprise
Turns me on with her love
Takes me to paradise

[Hook 2]
Do you love me Mary Jane?
Yeah. Whoa-oh-oh
Do ya? Do ya? Do ya?
Now do you think you love me Mary Jane
Don't you play no games

[Verse 2]
I love her just the same
I love her, Mary baby, just the same
The woman plays no games
Now, now, now
I'm in love with Mary Jane
I'm not the only one
If Mary wanna play around
I let her have her fun
She's not the kind of girl
That you can just tie down
She likes to spread her love
And turn your head around

[Hook 2]
Do you love me Mary Jane?
Yeah. Whoa-oh-oh
Do ya? Do ya? Do ya?
Now do you think you love me Mary Jane
Don't you play no games

[Bridge]
I love her just the same
I love her baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah
Cause Mary plays no games
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh baby

[Verse 3]
Yeahhhhh! Ooowoooo
Oh baby. Oh baby. Hit me
Whoah, Mary. Only love
I love you, yeah. Whooo!
Something until we give it now, lovey-dove
Uh-huh. Wow, baby!
Sing! La-du-da-da-du-da-dahh
Sing! La-du-da-da-du-da-dahh
Sing it for me baby
Come Mary, Mary Jane
Sing it for me baby
