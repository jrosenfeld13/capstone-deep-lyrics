[Verse 1]
We'll bring you to your knees
You cannot see something you cannot please
We'll bring you to your knees
You cannot see something you cannot please

I met a girl with predictable ways
Open doors, yeah she's here to stay
Come clean, just open your mind
Shut those legs girl, it's closing time

[Chorus]
Oh faithful, I'm amazed to find you look that way
Oh faithful, put away the pills, come waste away with me

[Verse 2]
You see these hospital walls are full
From the bodies of all the dead
It's spreading around the room
Just like you, wants to be fed

[Bridge]
Bloody hands stop beating hearts
Bloody hands stop beating hearts
Oh!
Bloody hands..
We'll bring you to your knees
How can you be something you cannot see?
We'll bring you to your knees
How can you see something you cannot please?

[Bridge 2]
Black, block out the sun, blot out your eyes
Pray for the ones you love
The sun runs from the sky
Beg for your life, pray for the ones you love
Black out the sun, we'll block out your eyes
Pray for daylight, your time it has come

This is the get off, I can't give up now

[Chorus]
Oh faithful, I'm amazed to find you look that way
Oh faithful, put away the pills, come waste away with me
Oh faithful, I'm amazed to find you look that way
Oh faithful, put away the pills, come waste away with me

[Outro]
Come waste away with me
It's all in your head
It's all in your head
If you see it, just close those blue eyes like you mean it
