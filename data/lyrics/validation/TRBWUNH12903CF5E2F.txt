A murderer resurfaced
My tantrum unbound
The killing is inevitable
Blood craze delirium
With tools of might
Escalated screaming
Nightmare in sight

I approach you with a sharpened blade
Slice 'n dice
Throat be cut across
Arterial spray on the wall
Abdominal cavity embowelled
I hear my demon call

What are you screaming for?!
It's only pain!
I ripped out your tongue
To get rid of that acrid voice

So shut the fuck up!!
You annoy me!!

Flesh to destroy
For me
Flesh to destroy
Tearing

Trapped in a dark corner of my mind
A regurgitated spawn piled up on the floor
Your pathetic appearance
I hate it so much!!
I've had enough of your banalities
But you are here right now
With me, and the horror you'll see

Flesh to destroy
You'll scream far more
Flesh to destroy
You'll scream far more
