Nobody's home
Drive downtown to this bar I know
Drinking alone
Won't get me where I want to go
In a smoke filled room
There's people playing pool
Everything's gonna be all right
I know, it's OK
Tomorrow's gonna be an even better day

On Second Street
There's a caf where I like to eat
The waitress there
She's always been real good to me
But it's not enough
I can't feel or touch
Everything's gonna be all right
I know, it's OK
Tomorrow's gonna be an even better day
