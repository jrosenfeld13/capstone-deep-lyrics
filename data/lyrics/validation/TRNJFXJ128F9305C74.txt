Lay that pistol down, babe
Lay that pistol down
Pistol packin' mama
Lay that pistol down
Oh, drinkin' beer in a cabaret
Was I havin' fun
Until one night she caught me right
And now I'm on the run
Oh, lay that pistol down, babe
Lay that pistol down
Pistol packin' mama
Lay that pistol down
Oh, I see you every night, Bing
And I'll woo you every day
I'll be your regular mama
And I'll put that gun away
Oh, lay that pistol down, babe
Lay that pistol down
Pistol packin' mama
Lay that thing down before it goes off and hurts somebody
Oh, she kicked out my windshield
And she hit me over the head
She cussed and cried and said I'd lied
And she wished that I was dead
Oh, lay that pistol down, babe
Lay that pistol down
Pistol packin' mama
Lay that pistol down
We're three tough gals
From deep down Texas way
We got no pals
They don't like the way we play
We're a rough rootin' tootin' shootin' trio
But you oughta see my sister Cleo
She's a terror, make no error, but there ain't no lassie fairer
Here's what we tell 'er
Lay that pistol down, babe
Lay that pistol down
Pistol packin' mama
Lay that pistol down
------ instrumental break ------
Pappy made a batch o' corn
The revenuers came
Their draw was slow so now they know
You can't do that to Mame
Oh, lay that pistol down, babe
Lay that pistol down
Pistol packin' mama
Lay that pistol down
Oh, singin' songs in the cabaret
Was I havin' fun
Until one night, I didn't sing right
Now I'm on the run
Oh, lay that pistol down, babe
Lay that pistol down
Pistol packin' mama
Lay that pistol down
Oh, pistol packin' mama
Lay that pistol down
