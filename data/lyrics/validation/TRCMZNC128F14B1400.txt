And the spaniels down among
The old blue tick
Read about how the sherriffs down among
The old blue tick
And i cant say who you are
With your new running boards
And the spaniels down among
The old black ear
Read about how the Spainards down among
The old black hair
And i cant say who you are
With your new running boards
And i cant say who you are
Goodnight city boys
