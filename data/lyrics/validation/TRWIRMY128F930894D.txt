Crawling under my skin
Never knew a love so deep within
Silence can you hear me
Crying
Do you want me like I want you
Silence

I never knew a love like this before
That stepped up in my life and layed down on my door

Crawling under my skin
Never knew a love so deep within

Silence can you hear me
Crying
Do you want me like I want you

I never knew a love like tis before
That stepped up in my life and layed down on my door
I love you
I do love you

Crying
Can you hear me

I know that you think it's untrue
How could I ever leave and be without you
Know that you've been there for me

Forever will I thank you for eternity
I love you forever more
Forever more
Forever more

Forever more
Forever more

Forever more

Crawling under my skin
I never knew a love so deep within

Silence can you hear me
Crying

Do you want me
Like I want you

Silence

I love you
I do love you

Crawling under my skin
I never knew a love so deep within

Crawling under my skin
I never knew a love so deep within

Silence can you hear me
Crying

Do you want me
Like I want you

Silence
