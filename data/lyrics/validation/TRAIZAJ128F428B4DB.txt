I have your love and I'm taking it with me
Into the wild into the wild
I have an anchor that drops from inside me
Into the wild into the wild that
Always was hidden for you for you to find
Always was hidden for you for you to find

I have an instinct that's going to lead me
Into the wild into the wild
Call out his name and my father goes with me
Into the wild into the wild that
Always was hidden for you for you to find
Always was hidden for you for you to find

I have a charm that my best friend made for me
Into the wild, into the wild
The genius-est magic is that which is spun by
The small movements of lady fingers
Into the wild
Into the wild
Always was hidden for you to find
Always was hidden for you to find

I have your love and I'm taking it with me
Into the wild
Into the wild
Into the wild
