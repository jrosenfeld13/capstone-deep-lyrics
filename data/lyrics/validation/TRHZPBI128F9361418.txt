I keep my head on straight
And my eyes wide open
I try to move forward
Wishing and hoping
I took a hold of myself
In the middle of November
Don't you look back now
Is all I can remember

I feel like I'm leaving
Like I'm leaving home
Like he clouds are parting, and I'm not alone

[Chorus 1]
I'm learning to live
Living to learn
Starting to sing my song
Right, or wrong
Breaking away
Setting me free
Free to be, my own me
I'm learning to live

I got my vanity crisis
From my beautiful mother
I'm not gonna go there
I'm anything other
Take another deep breath now
It's just one more hurdle
I'm breaking this line
Before it comes full circle

I feel like I'm leaving
Like I'm leaving home
Like he clouds are parting, and I'm not alone

[Chorus 2:]
I'm learning to live
Living to learn
Starting to sing my song
Right, or wrong
Breaking away
Setting me free
Free to be, my own me

I found a place, where I can lay my shit down
Somewhere that I can finally be myself - be myself

[Chorus 2:]
I'm learning to live
Living to learn
Starting to sing my song
Right, or wrong
Breaking away
Setting me free
Free to be, my own me

[Chorus 1]
I'm learning to live
(Living to learn)
(Starting to sing my song) living to learn
(Right, or wrong)
I'm breaking away
Setting me free
Free to be, my own me
I'm learning to live
