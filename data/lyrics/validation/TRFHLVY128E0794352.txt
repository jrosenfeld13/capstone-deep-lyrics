[Intro]
Oh yeah

[Chorus 1]
Love me two times baby
Love me twice today
Love me two times girl
I'm goin away
Love me two times girl
Once for tomorrow
Once just for today

[Chorus 2]
Love me two times
I'm goin away

[Chorus 3]
Love me one time, Girl
I could not speak
Love me one time, Baby
You know my knees got weak
Love me two times, Girl
Love me all through the week
Love me two times
I'm goin away

[Chorus 2]
Love me two times
I'm goin away

[Chorus 3]
Love me one time, Girl
I could not speak
Love me one time, Baby
You know my knees got weak
Love me two times, Girl
Love me all through the week
Love me two times
I'm goin away

[Chorus 1]
Love me two times baby
Love me twice today
Love me two times girl
I'm goin away
Love me two times girl
Once for tomorrow
Once just for today

[Outro]
Love me two times
I'm goin away
Love me two times
I'm goin away
