[Verse 1]
Love has truly been good to me
Not even one sad day
Or minute have I had since you've come my way
I hope you know I'd gladly go
Anywhere you take me

[Chorus]
It's so amazing to be loved
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above

[Verse 2]
Got to tell you how you thrill me
I'm happy as I can be
You have come and it's changed my whole world
Bye bye sadness, hello mellow
What a wonderful day

[Chorus]
It's so amazing to be loved
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above

[Bridge]
And it's so amazing, amazing
I could stay forever, forever
Here in love and I'll leave you never
'Cause we've got amazing love
Truly it's amazing, amazing
Love brought us together, together
I would leave you never, never
Yes, we've got amazing love

Ooh, so amazing and I've been waiting
For a love like you

[Chorus]
It's so amazing to be loved
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above
(Ooh, and it's so, it's so...)
It's so amazing to be loved
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above
(And you know, it's so...)
It's so amazing to be loved
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above
(Hey, hey, hey, it's so...)
It's so amazing to be loved
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above...
