I'm a tourist
World at my feet
Across hither and dither
And hither and dither
And hither and dither
Won't fall off my seat

I've a camera
Keep my photos in a book
The more i keep shooting and shooting
And shooting and shooting and shooting
And shooting
The less i have to look

Im a tourist
I'm a tourist
Oh Cairo where did you go
Oh Cairo where did you go
Oh Cairo where did you go
Oh Cairo where have you gone
(where have you gone x3)

You're an Oyster
That's food for thought
Whats not for sale
For sale for sale for sale for sale
For sale for sale cannot be bought

I'm a tourist
I'm a tourist
Oh Cairo where did you go
Oh Cairo where did you go
Oh Cairo where did you go
Oh Cairo where did you go
Oh Cairo where did you go
Oh Cairo where did you go
Oh Cairo where did you go
Oh Cairo where have you gone
(where have you gone x3)
