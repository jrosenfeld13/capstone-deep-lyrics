There's all kinds of music, everywhere you go
Some folks like it fast, and some like it slow
Some like it hot, some like it blue
Some like it old, and some like it new

Now I'm not liking country, and I'm not rappin' rap
You can make a man swing, just say my thing
No, I'm talkin' to dig, my step
The only thing that turns me on is when I hear a soulful song

I like soul with a capital S
Soul with a capital S
Sweet soul music, that's the best
Soul with a capital S

Music makes you happy, thinking makes you sad
It can do the worst thing to the best you ever had
For entertainment found you if I had to choose
You and me might disagree cause I like rythm and blues

Now I'm not missing disco, I'm not saying punk is bunk
I can't settle for heavy metal cause I got to have that funk
The only thing that turns me on is when I hear a soulful song

I like soul with a capital S
Soul with a capital S
Sweet soul music, that's the best
Soul with a capital S

Oh, there's people who tell you to get in with the times
It doesn't even matter that if your poem rimes
But I'm here to tell you, whatever comes along
There's something that gave up everyone
And there ain't no right or wrong

If some rock makes you lazy highschool leaves you flat
If fusion drives you crazy that's now funk is where it's at
The only thing that turns me on is when I hear a soulful song

I like soul with a capital S
Soul with a capital S
Sweet soul music, that's the best
Soul with a capital S

I like soul with a capital S
Soul with a capital S
Sweet soul music, that's the best
Soul with a capital S, with a capital S
With a capital S, with a capital S

Soul with a capital S
Don't you know I like Soul
(With a capital S)
Gotta give me some of that soul
(With a capital S)

Yes I like soul
(With a capital S)
(With a capital S, with a capital S)
(With a capital S, with a capital S)

Yo fellas sounds like that Oaklands soul music
You know what I'm talking about

(They done found the stroke
Done found the Oakland stroke
They done found the stroke
Done found the Oakland stroke)

(Soul with a capital S)
Give me some of that soul
(With a capital S)
I gotta have that soul
(With a capital S)
(With a capital S)

That's what I like
(With a capital 'S')
Sweet soul music
(With a capital 'S')
(With a capital S)
(With a capital S)
