Walk away from your grace leave it behind, all that you once were
Now sell yourself out, for the very last time
Now take my hand and run far away
Your not an object, a credit card
You're so much more than an object for them to buy
Despite what you may think, Jesus will be there for you
Your eyes give you away it's not what you are
It's what you will become, through your lust
Your lust, your lust is suicide, your heart will overcome
Now sell yourself out, for one last time, now take my hand and run far away
You're so much more than this, you're so much more than this, your beauty
Now run away and grab my hand
You're so much more than an object for them to buy
You don't know what you've done
You think you're wrong, there is another way out of here
Despite what you may think, Jesus will be there for you
You're eyes give you away it's not what you are
It's what you will become, though your lust
Your lust, your lust is suicide, your heart will overcome
