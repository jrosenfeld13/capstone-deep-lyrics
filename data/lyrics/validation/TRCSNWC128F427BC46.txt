Always
Be not always
And if always
Bow our heads in shame
Always
Please be not always
And if always
Bow our heads in blame

'Cause time has made promises
Just promises

Faces
Did you see their faces?
Did they touch you?
Have you felt such pain?
To have nothing
To dream something
Then lose hoping
Is not life but lame?

But time has made promises
Just promises

Mothers cry, babies die
Helplessly in arms
While rockets fly and research lies
In progress to become
But what of men are flesh and blood?
We turn our backs on life
How can we claim to stand for peace
When the race is armed in strife
Destroying life?

Always
Please be not always
But if always
Bow our heads in shame
Always
Please, please be not always
'Cause if always
Bow our heads in blame

'Cause time, time, has made promises
Death promises
