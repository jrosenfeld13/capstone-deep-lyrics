I spend the night with Radio Luxembourg
Pop music crackles me to sleep
I tune the dial to Radio Luxembourg
It's better than counting sheep
I wrote away to Radio Caroline
I need to hear your saddest reggae song
And I'll wallow like a zombie in it
Tear up my Ipi Tombi ticket
Let chocolate buttons limbo under my tongue
I've never liked the taste of Lucozade
Another sip of hospital champagne
Charge your glasses "Radio Luxembourg"
Get well soon
Get well soon
Get well soon
Am I the only one tuned in to Luxembourg tonight
Do they only programme music to accompany my cough
Lousy words and drab percussion
Fading in and out of Russian
I haven't got the strength to turn it off
Get well soon, get well soon
Get well soon, get well soon
Get well soon, get well soon
208 - fabulous - 208
Fabulous - 208 - fabulous - 208
Contagious flu cold faint
Contagious flu cold faint
Contagious flu cold faint
Contagious flu!
I'm getting better thanks to Luxembourg
But I didn't stop to thank the radio
Today when I was downstairs eating
Its Ever-Ready heart stopped beating
Was it just coincidence, who knows?
Get well soon, get well soon
