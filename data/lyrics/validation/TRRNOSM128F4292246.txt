You call me in the middle of the night
Saying that you just got home
You're lucky I'm even still awake
Awake enough to answer the phone
But I knew it would be you
Cause I was hoping that you'd call
Hoping you'd say that you were sorry
But you don't apologize at all

And it's not ok and it's not alright
What have you been doing with those guys all night?

If they're really just friends
Why wouldn't you choose me over them?
Please don't do this again
I try to give you the space you need
But you end up walking all over me
Please don't do this to me
Oh no, please don't do this to me

You call me in the middle of the night
So drunk you're ready to pass out
Tellin' me you had a great time
Except for that hour you blacked out
Now you're surprised that I'm pissed
You think I'm acting all tough
Well I think you're acting like a bitch
And I swear this time I've had enough

And it's not ok and it's not alright
What have you been doing with those guys all night?

If they're really just friends
Why wouldn't you choose me over them?
Please don't do this again
I try to give you the space you need
But you end up walking all over me
Please don't do this to me
Oh no, please don't do this to me

Why do you have to push me so hard?
You're pushing me away
I ask, please don't do this to me
But you're doing it anyway

And it's not ok and it's not alright
You can't fool me, so don't even try
And it's not ok and it's not alright
What have you been doing with those guys all night?

If they're really just friends
Why wouldn't you choose me over them?
Please don't do this again
I try to give you the space you need
But you end up walking all over me
Please don't do this to me
Oh no, please don't do this to me
(call me in the middle of the night)
Please don't do this to me
(call me in the middle of the night)
Please don't do this to me
(call me in the middle of the night)
Please don't do this to me
(call me in the middle of the night)
Please don't do this to me
