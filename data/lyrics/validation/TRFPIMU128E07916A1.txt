(Harry Garfield And Michael McDonald)

Not every hope is a dream come true
Not every heart is made of steel
Not all love sees the end of time
And more hearts than not will be broken tryin'

But I believe that love is enough
In the healing of your touch
Because you show me
What it's all about
I would never find out
Unless you showed me

How easily we complicate the simple things
And one mistake we make along the way
Is to think there's so much more we need
Of things that time only takes away

Here all that we have is now
We learn to believe somehow
It's enough we have today
All I know is time changes everything
Whatever tomorrow brings
I will believe...
