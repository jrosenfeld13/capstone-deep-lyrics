Tom:
He rocks in the tree tops all day long
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet

Rockin' robin, (Danny)(tweet tweet tweet)
Rockin' robin' (Danny)(tweet tweetly-tweet)
Blow rockin' robin
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight

Danny:
Every little swallow, every chick-a-dee
Every little bird in the tall oak tree
The wise old owl, the big black crow
Flappin' their wings singing go bird go

Yeah

Tom:
Pretty little raven at the bird-band stand
Told them how to do the bop and it was grand
They started going steady and bless my soul
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriol
