Made a metal cross
And hung it on your wall
Do you like me, Deb?
Carved your name in oak
A hundred times
Who wrote chivalry is dead?

When you gonna get up, meet me half-awake?
When you gonna get up, unfreeeze?
Am I mistaken I was you soldier
When you gonna get up?

Feelies wheel me round
Were closer to the ground
Closer to the ground
Will I raise her bones and rest them on the stones?
Youre nothing to me now

Im off the ride, my hands are tied
And Im trying to respect your space

My head today
