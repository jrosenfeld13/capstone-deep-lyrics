"people are like chernobyl plants..."

Sometimes i read slower than slugs
Not that a slug can read by any means
But sometimes i read six lines at a time

While cutting glass

And there i am in the middle of the sahara
More like
There i am chugging away
In three adjacent running wheels at the same time...

Question i: (well this one's more of a declaration)
Jesus wasn't a carpenter he was a gardener...

Sequenced order of split seconds before a pin drops

Question ii: "let it be dead b___erfly..."

Sequenced order of split seconds before a pin drops

Question iii: i am the only one like me;
Subtitled (therefore symbol)
I am no better for any one for it though...

Well seems all three were declarations
It's like i'm retaining water
Then i turn around to take another sip of water
And it's like s___ my water broke...splash
War is in the imagination
Or that's what the sidewalk chalk won't shut its mouth about
Mel and i read with the best saved for last
"dream.love.be."
(sorta spoof on question 2)
Well at least that's how i read it aloud
In my head with the punctuation and all
She might not have...
O.k
Here's my problem...
(like there's on and even if there was one
Like he knew what it was)
Or at least the basic size and shape of it...
(the short and skinny if you will...)
Blah blah blah blah...

I want to write a book but up 'til now i've only done raps
Soooo is sole gonna put out my two hundred page album?
Can i rock a crowd with excerpts?
When will i finally get my super powers back?
Before or after my mid life crisis?

Crawl back into the v_____
Invent the airplane
Crawl back into the v_____
Invent the windmill
(...twelve noon or twelve midnight...)

Look!
I'm overreacting again
Whooooaa ho ho now
(a little bit of commin at cha saunter)
I'm changing my life
A flick of the wrist..some magic words...

"catharis!"
"alakawung!"
"presto!"

I'm overreacting again
But at least i'm making my selves laugh...
(hahaha hehehe)

And the b.l. is
The covered book that learns the baby stupid is...
I don't believe in dharma
But i'm scared stiff of what i was totally not expecting...
And hell, if i lose this poem...i lose this poem...

It's another peglegged upstairs neighbor/tennant
Clop clop clop clop...off into infinity

So there's an interesting point
Our lethaldose of adam
Widdles pointy for us...
Is this in fact a poem?
Question3ly i feel a circle tracing coming on here...here
Of course i'm different from everybody else
Mel...
And yes, i'm just like everybody else
"we are all the same"
We are all people...

So in the name of fresh water to drink
I've written a poem because...
Machine wash warm seperately
With bleach, tumble dry warm
Do not dry clean or iron if decorated wpl7232
Is a poem for christ's sake...

Hey, we're back to question i
Jesus didn't cut the grass...
He just got all melodramatic and martyrific and sat in it...
And don't tell anybody now but aaa...
"i'm making this up as i go along..."
"and it feels good..."
Its unleavened profundity loaf bread...
Ya know?
I'm no leader
I just can't see myself following you...
And that's not in a "heavy" way you...
To phrase a dying wish quasi-question3ly...
Not you personally but...
You personally...
...i just "brought some of the words i write
The way i write them..."

So watch me do the funky dead b___erfly
And smile my lost a__ found...
Perfect...
Here's to lightning up the uncola...
The special magic treat...
The "relative end"...
Signed, yours truly...
Will open (dot, dot, dot)
Whisper (optional)
