[Intro: Pinchers]
Hey!
Yeah you..
Try to test, eh?
Take this!
*shoop, poop, huh!*
You grunt like a pig, amigo
Haha
Hey! long time
I have been riding west
Hey!

[Chorus: Pinchers]
Veintiuno, that was the number
Raid the indian chief as I see they ride
Reigning the place was the leader of the apache
And scalpels traveled at them side

[Verse 1: Pinchers]
'Cause me just
Line up the cowboy fi catch him with...jam
Gun under clothes, but mi spear inna mi...hand
Beretta inna di brezze it a -...
Soon as I enter, soon as I arrive
Pretend to be a chief from another tribe
My true identity, was concealed, believe me
I tell dem, Bounty Killer, my profile was hide
'Cause me just
Back out mi gun from under mi....clothes
And push up inna di indian chief's....nose
Mi cowboy boot mi use and step pon him.....toe
Him make a sound like a wild buffalo

[Verse 2: Bounty Killer]
Long time me riding and me riding west
A who waan fi touch inna mi bullet proof vest?
Then a how them a galang so? Then a wha' them a profess?
Touch Bandelero, we shot up your bird nest
Me ride all about, East, West, North, and South
I have been known by my big black coat
Remington underneath, do no make me pop out
Shoot to the head, or the eye, or the throat
Me shoot through mi Eagle, kill hawk and eagle
Murder a bwoy, make him know say me evil
Bwoy a send threat long time without a reason
Now me buck him up, him and mi big gun even
Make him know the Killer murder bwoy and season
Me riding west, me get anything me want
Natural water from the cactus plant
Kill a rabbit and get food fi pass mi throat
Kill a fox and take him skin and make mi coat

[Verse 3: Pinchers]
Everybody ask me, "How the West was won?"
But I man have the answer fi every question, Lord
Because Martina won
Al Pacino won
Franco Nero won
Johnny Ringo
John Wayne, and
Blood Stain, and
Me gone too much inna memory lane
Oh, no one test my caravan
And take my cow bully and
No one dare test my caravan
Hey!

[Chorus: Pinchers]
Veintiuno, that was the number
With the indian chief as I see they ride
Reigning the place was the leader of the apache
And scalpels traveled at them side

[Verse 4: Pinchers]
'Lero dip inna di waist, pop off di gun
Take out mi gun, nuh think it is fun
Nuff bwoy fi die, so murder Eli
'Cause all mi see that nuff bwoy is spy

[Verse 5: Bounty Killer]
Well!
Long time me riding and me riding west
Who waan fi test inna mi bulletproof vest?
Then a how some a galang so? Then a wha' them a profess?
Touch Bounty Killer, we shot up your bird nest
Me no give up hope!
Me have mi gun near me, so!
There's a ring around the tub, a just mi back me a scrub
Water might look green, or it might smell stench
That no bother the Killer, me just put on mi trench
Long time me riding and me riding west
Who waan fi test inna mi bulletproof vest?
Then a how some a galang so? Then a wha' dem a profess?
If you touch the Killer, we shot up your bird nest

[Verse 6: Pinchers]
(Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo)
Indian a scream
(Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo)
Running in my Gatlin
(Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo)
Dynamite from nowhere
(Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo)
And someone fall on their spear

[Verse 2: Bounty Killer]
So!
Long time me riding and me riding west
A who waan fi touch inna mi bullet proof vest?
A how them a galang so? Then a wha' them a profess?
Touch Bandelero, we shot up your bird nest
Me ride all about, East, West, North, and South
I have been known by my big black coat
Remington underneath, mind you make me pop out
Shoot to the head, or the eye, or the throat
Me shoot through mi Eagle, kill hawk and eagle
Murder a bwoy, make him know say me evil

[Outro: Pinchers]
Hey!
Veinti and what now?
Veintiuno, that was the number
With the indian chief as I see they ride
Reigning the place was the leader of the apache
And scalpels traveled at them side
