If I fall apart on you now
Would you hold me?
If I fall apart on you now
Would you cave in, too?

I am afraid
And I just can't seem
To reach out and touch you
Because you still don't believe
Fall apart

So when you gonna make up
Your mind?
Are you hearing me
Cause if I fell apart on you now
You would cave in, too

My heart is empty
I need to be filled
Come take these tears
Just one last time
Within your wings
Help me to fly
I'm waiting for you
I'm ready for you to be real
I'm ready
To fall apart
Feel me slipping
Fall apart

It's time to let go
Time to be real
I'm taking my hands off
The steering wheel
I'm ready to fall apart
Ready to fall apart, baby
It'll break your fucking heart
Your miserable heart
Oh, I got your fever
I got your fever
I feel it inside me, sickened
Sickened
Temperature rising, sickened
Sickened
I got your fever
