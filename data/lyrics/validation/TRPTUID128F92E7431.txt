[Verse 1: Rodrigo Amarante]
I bet you're wondering how I knew
That this would come to an end
He stole your heart from you
So you tossed me out to the wind

[Verse 2: Rodrigo Amarante]
I keep pretending not to care
Oh the winter scent in her hair
Compels my hands to do
The things my heart wouldn't dare

[Chorus:]
I'll keep holding on to you
See no use perfecting lives with strangers
If only you, if only now

[Verse 3: Rodrigo Amarante]
And in the twilight of this hour
When fools are mistaken for men
This shadow suits me well
My regrets are faced in the end

[Chorus:]
I'll keep holding on to you
See no use perfecting lives with strangers
If only you, if only now

[Chorus:]
I'll keep holding on to you
See no use perfecting love with strangers
If only you, if only now
