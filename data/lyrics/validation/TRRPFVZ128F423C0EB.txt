Let?s go bare back ridin? baby, yes
Come on baby, let?s go bare back ridin? right now

Hat on your head, boots on your feet, spurs on your heels, you look so sweet
And this little pony rides so sweet, so sweet, so sweet, so sweet, so sweet!

Get on that little pony right now, baby, yes
Get on that little pony, you?ve got to ride
Saddle on her back, bit in her mouth
I?ll head north, she heads south
And if she lose me, you know you?ve just blew it, you blew it
Don?t blow it, don?t blow it, don?t blow!
Oh, blow baby. Ow!

Yes, I wanna ride
Yea babe, I wanna ride
Come on baby, let me ride with you
Come on baby, let me ride with you

I don?t wanna ride, English-style

I don?t wanna ride, Western-style, oh no
I wanna ride, like Geronimo used to ride
Like Sittin? Bird used to ride. Like Apaches used to ride

I?m talkin? ?bout bare back, bare back ridin?
You can?t get any closer, talkin? ?bout bare back, yea
Talkin? ?bout skin-to-skin
Talkin? ?bout you and me
Talkin? ?bout ridin? in the sunset
Ridin? all night long, yea, all night long, all night long

Grab the pony and ride
Grab that pony and ride
Grab that pony and ride
Grab that pony and ride
Grab that pony, grab that pony, grab that pony
Grab that pony, grab that pony and ride
