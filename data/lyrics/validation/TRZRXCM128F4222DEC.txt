C'mon Julie, I've been watching you
Ever since you've been to town
I'm through with watching you, there's lots more we can do
Julie, I need your love so bad

C'mon Julie, time's a-wasted
I should be tasting your sweet lips
C'mon give love a try, don't let it pass you by
Julie I need your love so bad

My love, my devotion is deeper than the deepest ocean
Julie, oh, won't you give your sweet love to me?

C'mon Julie, say you love me
Give me your sweet love all the time
C'mon and take my hand, tell me you understand
Julie, I need your love so bad

C'mon, give love a try, don't let it pass you by
Julie, I need your love so bad

My love, my devotion is deeper than the deepest ocean
Julie, oh, won't you give your sweet love to me?
My love, my devotion is deeper than the deepest ocean
Julie, oh, won't you give your sweet love to me?

Julie, I need your love so bad
