I came from Alabama
Wid my banjo on my knee
I'm g'wan to Louisiana
My true love for to see
It rain'd all night the day I left
The weather it was dry
The sun so hot I frose to death;
Susanna, don't you cry

Chorus:
Oh! Susanna, Oh! don't you cry for me
I've come from Alabama, wid my banjo on my knee

I jumped aboard de telegraph
And trabbelled down de ribber
De Lectrie fluid magnified
And killed five hundred Nigga
De bulgin' bust, de horse run off
I really thought I'd die;
I shut my eyes to hold my breath
Susanna, don't you cry

Chorus:
I had a dream de odder night
When ebery ting was still;
I thought I saw Susanna
A coming down de hill
The buckwheat cake war in her mouth
The tear was in her eye
Says I'm coming from de South
Susanna, don't you cry

Chorus:
I soon will be in New Orleans
And den I'll look all round
And when I find Susanna
I' fall upon the ground
But if I do not find her
Dis darkie 'I surely die
And when I'm dead and buried
Susanna, don't you cry
