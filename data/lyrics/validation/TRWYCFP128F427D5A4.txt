We're so friendly to the better lookin guys
Watchin 'em wiggle in front of our eyes
We just laugh, we stay cool
We're in control, we're in the mood
We won't stop
Too hot!
Platform shoes too high for hip hop
Faces, places never never
-never never felt so good

We're somthin special baby
And u know, dont u know it

We r here
(lets freak out)
Step aside and let us in
(word is out)
Now this party can begin
Lets freak out
Wake up people we've arrived
(word is out)
We're gonna burn it up tonight
Now this party can begin

See that fella with the crazy lookin shoes
Seriously bad bad news
Watch him laugh thinks he's cool
Lost all control
He's in the mood
And he won't stop
Too hot
Crazy shoes to new for hip hop
Faces places never never
-never never felt so good

We're somethin special baby
And u know, dont u know it
Now this party can be-
Now this party can begin
Now this party can be-
Now this party can begin

We're gonna burn it up tonight

Lets freak out
Wake up people we've arrived
(word is out)
We're gonna burn it up tonight
(lets freak out)
Step aside and let us in
(word is out)
Now this party can begin
