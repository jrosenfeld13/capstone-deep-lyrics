I made you!
And you wanna know why?
You wanna know what I did it for?
'Cause I was born too soon
And I started too late, that's why
But what I have in me, I could've been better than any of you!
What I got in me...!
What I've been holding down inside of me
Oh, if I ever let it out
There wouldn't be signs big enough!
There wouldn't be lights bright enough!

Here she is, boys!
Here she is, world!
Here's Rose!

Curtain up!
Light the lights!
Play it, boys!

You either got it or you ain't
And, boys, I got it!
Ya like it?
Well, I got it!

Some people got it and make it pay
Some people can't even give it away
This people's got it
And this people's spreadin' it around!
You either have it
Or you've had it!

Hello, everybody! My name is Rose! What's yours?
How do you like them eggrolls, Mr. Goldstone?
Hold your hats and hallelujah
Mama's gonna show it to you

Ready or not, shhh, here comes Mama

Mama's talkin' loud
Mama's doin' fine
Mama's gettin' hot
Mama's goin' stong
Mama's movin' on
Mama's all alone
Mama doesn't care
Mama's lettin' loose
Mama's got the stuff
Mama's lettin' go
Ma-- mm
Mama's got the stuff
Mama's gotta move
Mama's gotta go
Mmm -- ma...
Mama's gotta let go

Why did I do it?
What did it get me?
Scrapbooks full of me in the background
Give 'em love and what does it get you?
What does it get you?
One quick look as each of 'em leaves you
All your life and what does it get you?
Thanks a lot and out with the garbage
They take bows and you're battin' zero

I had a dream
I dreamed it for you, June
It wasn't for me, Herbie
And if it wasn't for me
Then where would you be
Miss Gypsy Rose Lee?

Well, someone tell me, when is it my turn?
Don't I get a dream for myself?
Starting now it's gonna be my turn
Gangway, world, get off of my runway!
Starting now I bat a thousand!
This time, boys, I'm taking the bows and...

Everything's coming up Rose!
Everything's coming up roses!
Everything's coming up roses
This time for me!
For me!
For me!
For me!
For me!
For me!
For me!
