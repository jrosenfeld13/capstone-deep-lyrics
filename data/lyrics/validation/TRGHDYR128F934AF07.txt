Ball of fire in the sky
The sound of solid steel
A flash of lightning
Sounds so frightening
When the power's all you feel
From the leather of the fifties
Murray The K and Alan Freed
Monroe and James Dean
Died for the silver screen
And Elvis made them bleed
Born in America
Born in America
You wanna see a movie star?
Hollywood or D.C.?
Politicians greed
Money's all you need
The power's guaranteed
Vegas got the casinos
And Texas, oil wells
Got your Boston beans
Got your Frisco Queens
Anything that sells
Born in America
Born in America
Land of the free
Born in America
Born in America
Born in America
Born in America
Motor city, motown
Chili-dogs and baseball
Bluejeans and Coca-Cola
Rock 'n' roll
All born in America
