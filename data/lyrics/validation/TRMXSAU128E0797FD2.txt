[Intro]
[Woman's Voice] That's what I believe got him re-elected, is the people knew that you could believe what he says
[George Bush] Our Country is strong, we go forward to defend freedom, and all that is good and just in our world

[Verse 1]
All my devotion betrayed
I am no longer afraid
I was too blinded to see
How much you've stolen from me
You want to know why I feel so horrified?
I've let my innocence die
You want to know why I can't be pacified?
You made me bury something
I won't be sleeping tonight

[Chorus]
I only wanted a blessing made
Now I've been labeled a renegade
It seems so clear now what I must do
You're no immortal
I won't let them
Deify you
They view you as the new messiah
Deify you
Renew belief in some demented man

[Verse 2]
You want to know why it seems the passion's died?
We've all been living this lie
You want to know why my will's been fortified?
You've made me hunger again
Good luck sleeping tonight

[Chorus]
I only wanted a blessing made
Now I've been labeled a renegade
It seems so clear now what I must do
You're no immortal
I won't let them
Deify you
They view you as the new messiah
Deify you
Renew belief in some demented man
All my devotion betrayed
I am no longer afraid
I was too blinded to see
How much you've stolen from me
Deify you
They view you as the new messiah
Deify you
Renew belief in some demented man
