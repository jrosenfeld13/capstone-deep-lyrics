I make rock 'n' roll records
I sell 'em for a dime
I make my living and feed my children
All in good time

The blues they go for a quarter
Guaranteed to satisfy
It's a real funky deal
Don't let it pass you by

If your evening sun don't shine, my friend
Tell you what I'm gonna do I'm gonna hammer out this rhythm
Till I get right next to you
