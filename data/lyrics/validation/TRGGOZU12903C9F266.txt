Mend up your stocking hole
'Cause this lump ain't made of coal
I've got a boner for Christmas
Cranberry sauce, ice cream and muffins
You be the turkey and I'm the stuffing
I've got a boner for Christmas

Singing joy to the world
To each and every girl
To all of of you girls, oh oh you

Ohh yeah

Hang up your Christmas stocking
And let me put my cock in
I've got a boner for Christmas
All year, you've been in a rut
This time, let's do it in the butt
I've got a boner for Christmas

Singing joy to the world
To each and every girl
To all of of you girls, oh oh
I've got a boner
Oh oh oh
For Christmas
