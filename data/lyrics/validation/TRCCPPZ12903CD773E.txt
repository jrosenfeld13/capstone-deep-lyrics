I give you metallic license
Spin your wheels until they cough
Deaths got all its fingers hanging down like broken slats
If I speak to you in metaphors
And tongues that make you sing
Will you drop the act of getting by and pray for shiny things
But you tried to make it better
And I tried to understand
That night we walked across the bridge
You held on to my hand
Ive got time to wait for you
You crossed my mind a time or two
Im alright, youre ok
Close your eyes . . . babe
I come home to you calling
And youre waiting by the phone
The black and red passing signs forever pushing on
Soot-colored window sills
Solemn-covered views
Accentuate the distance, darkening the hews
Accents of your inflections
Were starving for the same
Old feelings start and flutter
Like your dress a picture frame
CHORUS
I wish it were as harmless
As you wanted it to be
Could justify the things I do
Each night so I can sleep
