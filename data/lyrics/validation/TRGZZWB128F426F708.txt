I'm worried in mind
Stay worried all the time
Someday I'll be satisfied

It's your time now
But it's my time after a while
Oh said, if things don't get no better
I'm gonna move on down the line

'Cause when you was my baby
I treated you nice and kind
But baby I have changed my mind

I was crazy 'bout you, baby
Crazy as a man could be

So now, when I leave ya now, baby
Don't try an follow me

You gonna wake up
One a these mornin's
An it ain't gonna be long
And look for me
An I will be gone

So bye-bye, baby
Babe, you know you'd done me wrong
So try your best to forget
That I ever held you in my arms

'Yas, yas, yas'

(instrumental & piano)

You gonna worry 'bout me
One a-these old lonesome days
An yo' daddy'll be far away

So long peoples an sweetheart
I'll soon be on my way
You're going to be sorry
That you let me go run, still
