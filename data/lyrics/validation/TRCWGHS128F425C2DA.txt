Try to forget torment
Lying behind a smile
Tears for sentiment
Now I've done my time

You filled my head with your opinions
Blind to your lies I listened

Still waiting for love to take revenge (revenge)
For that sweet surrender

You'll get what you deserve
Hiding behind a lie
Revenge says more than words
You'll pay for your crime

I fooled myself you'd change your ways
Blind to your lies I listened

Still waiting for love to take revenge (revenge)
For that sweet surrender

Still waiting for love to take revenge
For that sweet surrender

Still waiting for love to take revenge
For that sweet surrender

Still waiting for love to take revenge (revenge)
For that sweet surrender

(Inst. Break)

Still waiting for love to take revenge
For that sweet surrender

Still waiting for love to take revenge (revenge)
Still waiting for love

Still waiting for love to take revenge
Waiting for love from heaven

Still waiting for love to take revenge
Still waiting for love

To take revenge
Sweet revenge
Waiting for love from heaven
