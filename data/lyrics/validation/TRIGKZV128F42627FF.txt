I smelled like you
But woke up alone
And I didn't know
If you'd taken me home

Like who got who
Into the car?
Who wanted to park?
Who brushed my arm?

I dreamt of dating and breaking up
Yeah, I hated waking up
But I am through with love and loving
It's a lot of work for nothing
Oh, from this day on

Now what am I
Going to say
To your new little friend
Who called me today?

Trying to remove
Any and all doubt
Of where you've been and how
You're there with him now

I guess I'm hoping he's right
But I just can't remember last night
I guess I'm beyond believing
Anybody here could get so lucky
No, too far gone
And I am through with love and loving
It's a lot of work for nothing
Oh, from this day on

From this day on
