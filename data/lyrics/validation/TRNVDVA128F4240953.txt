[Verse 1]
All dressed in black
Eyes of attack
Coming with one hand in pocket, to take from me
Sin in eyes I see
Sin is nice to me
Nothing left for me
Reality, forget it

[Chorus]
You have messed up
Can't do anything
I have messed up
Can't do anything
You're just a fuckup
I'm just a fuckup
We're just two fuckups
At least we're fucked up together

[Verse 2]
So sad to see you go
I said to myself you know
So sad to see a mind
Disappear through time
Lunacy's an argued taste
I guess there's no time to waste
This time, it's a passing phase
Reality, forget it

[Chorus]
You have messed up
Can't do anything
I have messed up
Can't do anything
You're just a fuckup
I'm just a fuckup
We're just two fuckups
At least we're fucked up together
You have messed up
Can't do anything
I have messed up
Can't do anything
You're just a fuckup
I'm just a fuckup
We're just two fuckups
At least we're fucked up together

[Bridge]
We are two fuckups
We are two fuckups

[Chorus]
You have messed up
Can't do anything
I have messed up
Can't do anything
You're just a fuckup
I'm just a fuckup
We're just two fuckups
At least we're fucked up together
You have messed up
Can't do anything
I have messed up
Can't do anything
You're just a fuckup
I'm just a fuckup
We're just two fuckups
At least we're fucked up together

[Outro]
Together
Together
Together forever
Together Forever
Together forever, on paper
Together forever
Together forever
