Close the door, turn the light off

And before you drop come to me

I'll be here when you wake up

Please don't ever stop, stay with me

If I could do it all over I wouldn't change a thing

I wouldn't change a thing

I will spend my life trying to make you love me

Whenever you breathe. Whatever you need
