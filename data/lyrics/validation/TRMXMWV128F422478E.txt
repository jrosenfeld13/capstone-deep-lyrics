If you've ever been mistreated, you know what I'm talkin' about
If you ever been mistreated, you know what I'm talkin' about
I worked five long years for one woman and the she had the nerve to put me out

Got a job in a steel mill, shuckin' steel like a slave
Five long years, ev'ry Friday, I went straight home with my pay

I've been mistreated, ah, you know what I'm talkin' about
I worked five long years on one woman, now she has the nerve to put me out

I finally learned a lesson a long, long time ago
Next woman I marry she's gotta, work an' bring me some dough
'Cause I've, I've been mistreated, you know what I'm talkin' about
I worked five long years for one woman, now she got the nerve to put me out
