I would never, ever let you go
All this fighting is really just a show
That we put on behind doors that
Everyone knows aren't closed

All these eyes are watching in the dark
Putting black holes in the stars
That we used to think we ours
Until they fell apart
Right now they seem so far

But all I know is the way you hold my heart
But all that shows is the way we fall apart
To a world I hate
You are the one I love
They'll say what they'll say
But they'll never say enough

I'll sing it more than once
That you are the one I love
After all of the things we've said and done
You are the one I love

There are couples, couples everywhere
Oh why, oh why does everyone care?
It's hard to be me and you
When all that everyone does is stare
Oh, all that they do is stare

Oh, all I know is the way you hold my heart
But all that shows is the way we fall apart
To a world I hate
You are the one I love
They'll say what they'll say
But they'll never say enough

Why can't we hide away?
All that I need is your face
To remind me that I feel this way

And all I know is the way you hold my heart
But all that shows is the way we fall apart
To a world I hate
You are the one I love
They'll say what they'll say
But they'll never say enough

And to a world I hate
You are the one I love
They'll say what they'll say
They'll never say enough

I'll sing it more than once
That you are the one I love
And you are the one I love
