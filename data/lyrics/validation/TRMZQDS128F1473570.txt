Take it all
Take it all away and watch me fall
Take me in
Show me what it's like to be alive, truly alive

I'm holding fast to what I know
I found it surrounded

Take it on
Take it on for what you think it's worth
Find your life, find it in your heart to let this go
To come back home

And all we ever wanted was the truth
Count the rest as lost, count it all as lost
I'm gonna figure out what's right
Count the rest as lost, count the rest as if it's lost for good

I'm holding fast to what I know
I found it surrounded
I found it surrounded
Surrounded

Hallelujah, left the back door open
There's a reason, one which we can hope in
There's an answer, he left the back door open
There's a reason, one which we have hope in
