Come on over to my house
I'll make you buckets of tea
Put your breath inside of me

Come on over to my house
Will you be wearing your black tie?
You probably thought I'm a shy guy

Come on up to my door
Walk across my hardwood floor
C'mon, just a little more...

Come on over to my house
Come on over to my house
Put your breath inside of me

Here comes Rosie
He's a tricky bitch
But sometimes you've got to scratch that itch

Come on over to my house
Come on over to my house
Put your breath inside of me

Come on over to my house
Come on over to my house
You probably thought I'm a shy guy
