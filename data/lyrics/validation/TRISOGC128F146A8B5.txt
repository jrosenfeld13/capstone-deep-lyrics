Don't make me hate. Just try to relate
Please let me stay. I just want to play

I'm just a child

Don't make me mad. Don't let me be sad
'Cause I don't understand. 'Cause I'm not yet a man

I'm just a child

I'm demanding your attention. So push my brother and sisters aside
I've been crying for your affection. Yeah mother tan my hide
I'd better run and hide

I'm just a child

Don't make me hate, just try to relate
