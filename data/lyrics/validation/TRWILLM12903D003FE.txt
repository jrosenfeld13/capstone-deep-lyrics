You are going down
Down
At the bottom I have found
I cannot wait to get back in the fight
And send you straight to the ground
Hide and seeking
When I'm on the ropes
You wanna knock me down, knock me out - Your cheap shots are denied
You're going down now - You can't kill my soul and kill my dream
Back down
Now - You will understand me now
You don't want to come back to the fight
I've been the underdog all my life
I can feel it
I will not stop until I see you down
On the ground - Cause I am still alive
