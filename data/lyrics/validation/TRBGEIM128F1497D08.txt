The halos lights
Look good with the ringing
Fog bells
Orion dead in the arc
But you cant tell
Lead gray eclipse above
Hiss of the snakes
Rolling beside us
We are thrown into the shade
We are thrown into the shade
I think well be okay
The echo of the muffled drums
Dont be overwhelmed by that
Dont be overwhelmed by that
If you think this is hard work
If you think this is hard work
Youve never seen work
Feel for your charm
Take out your good luck
Were getting close to the edge
Do what you know
Do a good job
Youre getting closer to the end
What do you know
What do you know
I know the song of the road
The song of the road
The song of the road
