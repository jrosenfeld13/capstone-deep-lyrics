Dirty
You're a dirty ol' man
You can't keep your hands to yourself
You're a dirty ol' man
Go mess around with somebody else

Now I've done told you
That you can look but please don't touch
'Cause you don't understand what I mean
Can't you see I'm not old enough

You say that ain't, ain't nothing but a number
You're much too experienced for me
Ooh, all you wanna do is take my love
All you want is another victory

Dirty ol' man
You can't keep your hands to yourself
You're a dirty ol' man
Go mess around with somebody else

Next time you see me
You can speak but please don't stuck
'Cause I believed every word you said
And here I am with a broken heart

You won your game now
Don't waste it on a date
No, no, no, no, no

'Cause you're a married man
And I'm still free
Ooh, all you wanna do is take my love
All you want is another victory

Dirty ol' man
You can't keep your hands to yourself
Dirty ol' man
Go mess around with somebody else

A dirty, dirty
Dirty ol' man

A dirty, dirty
Dirty ol' man

A dirty, dirty
Dirty ol' man

A dirty, dirty
Dirty ol' man

Dirty

All you wanna do is to use me
All you wanna do is to take advantage of me
Dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty

Dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty ol' man

You're a dirty ol' man
You can't keep your hands to yourself
You're a dirty ol' man
Go mess around with somebody else

You're a dirty ol' man
You can't keep your hands to yourself
You're a dirty ol' man
Go mess around with somebody else

You're a dirty ol' man
You can't keep your hands to yourself
