I am a driver
I am a driver
I am a driver
I am a driver
I am a driver
I am a driver
I am a driver
I am a driver
I am a driver
I am a driver

We all come in dancing
Never want to stop
Wear the magic out
And suddenly we're not driving
We all got one that got away
But I saw mine just yesterday
Get an oil change and go
Be louder than ever before
What have I left?
Oh my vision of love
How sweet it is
Oh my vision of love
