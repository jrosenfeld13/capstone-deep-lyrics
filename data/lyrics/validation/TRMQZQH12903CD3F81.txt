We shall overcome
We shall overcome
We shall overcome, some day

Oh, deep in my heart
I do believe
We shall overcome, some day

We'll walk hand in hand
We'll walk hand in hand
We'll walk hand in hand, some day

Oh, deep in my heart

We shall live in peace
We shall live in peace
We shall live in peace, some day

Oh, deep in my heart

We shall all be free
We shall all be free
We shall all be free, some day

Oh, deep in my heart

We are not afraid
We are not afraid
We are not afraid, TODAY

Oh, deep in my heart

We shall overcome
We shall overcome
We shall overcome, some day

Oh, deep in my heart
I do believe
We shall overcome, some day
