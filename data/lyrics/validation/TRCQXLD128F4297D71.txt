[Verse 1]
The time has come, You're really leaving
You always told me that you wanted to
I guess I never thought It would happen
I guess I never really wanted it to
The world is calling you and you must answer
But you can take me with you In your dreams

[Chorus]
If you ever get back to Amarillo
In a shiny new car or worn out shoes
If you ever get back to Amarillo
I'll be waiting for you

[Verse 2]
Your sister told me you were working
At some office out in tinsel town
Don't forget about those who love you
They'll be there for you if you get down
I believe in you and all you're after
I hope you end up where you want to be

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Thirty years now have gone by quickly
I still think of you from time to time
My wife died early, I've got children
I'm happy and my health is fine
I often wondered if you found your freedom
I sometimes wonder if I should have gone

[Chorus] [x2]

[Outro]
I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting for you
