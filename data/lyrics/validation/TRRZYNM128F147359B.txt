This time it was summer
And the planet
Grew upwards
The steam
The horizon
Before the snow
Before the endless winter
Within the heat wave
Against the walls
Against the ashes of those
Who didn't find the shadow in time
I guess we got stuck in neither gas
Nor rain or medicine
But something hot
Clean and chemical

Raise your hands towards sun I will be there
Overlooking your arm, birds-eye intense
Clean and cloudless and laser - blue blinding
Way to close to the ground
To find me
To find me
I will be there

I feared
But I wasn't alone
Amongs those with me
There was the same little one
The Oracle from my dream before
The sun swirled as we jiggled between the hideways
Each one of them worse
Each time the slow ones behind screamed
The ones ahead prayed but she wouldn't listen
A small, big eyes, grown up
A natural born magician
A natural born magician

Raise your hands towards sun I will be there
Overlooking your arm, birds-eye intense
Clean and cloudless and laser - blue blinding
Way to close to the ground
To find me
To find me
I will be there

I sensed, I would be safe
Only if I keep up and hold my breath
Until the rain attacks and fades again
Within time
I would have faded with it
To wake up, to be here
Within time
I would have faded with it
To be with you
To wake up
A natural born magician
