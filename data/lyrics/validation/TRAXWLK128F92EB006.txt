There are things that I'll never understand
The road I've walked that has made me who I am
Reminiscing with the picture on the wall again
Reminding me just how far away I've been

I'm looking to lay my burdens down
They're something I can't carry anymore
I'm longing to lay my body down
Beside still waters and find rest for my soul

My knees are weak and my mind is tired
I've followed every dream of every liar
If there's a place that you've prepared for me that I belong
Then let these dry bones arise to live and breathe your song

What once was dead has now come alive
