I'm not a know-it-all
Don't know why the grass is tall
Don't know why there's morning dew
I only know that I love you

I'm not a know-it-all
Don't know why the raindrops fall
Don't know what's beyond the blue
I only know that I love you

With things that are not of you alone
I'm not so wise
And still I could write a book of my own
When I look in your eyes!

I'm not a know-it-all
Yet I know I'll run to you
The very moment that you call
I love you, know you know it all!
