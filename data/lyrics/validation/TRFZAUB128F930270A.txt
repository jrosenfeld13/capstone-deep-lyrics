All that I thought about for the longest time
All that I thought about for the longest time
But he's untouchable, untouchable, untouchable
For me

Across the waves
Through my defence
Messages speak
Tell me it's over
That it's over
Yes, it's over

Must be heartache
Shortness of breath
So I can't speak
To say it's over
That it's over
Yes, it's over

And if you read all that he wrote
Then you would now
All that I know
But would you understand how deep in goes

Never forget all the words said
They stick around in the front of my head
Clearing the doubt that I could have changed anything

All that I thought about for the longest time
All that I thought about for the longest time
But he's untouchable, untouchable, untouchable
For me

Across the waves
Through my defence
Messages speak
Tell me it's over
That it's over
Yes, it's over

Must be heartache
Shortness of breath
So I can't speak
To say it's over
That it's over
Yes, it's over

All that I thought about for the longest time
All that I thought about for the longest time
All that I thought about for the longest time
All that I thought about for the longest time
