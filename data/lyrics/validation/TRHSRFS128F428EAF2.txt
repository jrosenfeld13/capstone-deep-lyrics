[Verse 1]
Comin' down the mountain, boys, what do I see?
Bear tracks, bear tracks comin' after me
Better get your rifle before it's too late
The bear's got a pig and he's headed for the gate

[Chorus]
He's big around the middle and he's broad across the rump
Making ninety-miles-an-hour, takin' thirty-feet-a-jump
He ain't never been caught, he ain't never been treed
Some folks say he looks a lot like me

[Verse 2]
I took all my money and I bought me some bees
They started making honey way up in the trees
I cut down the tree, but my honey's all gone
Old Slew Foot done made himself at home

[Chorus]
He's big around the middle and he's broad across the rump
Making ninety-miles-an-hour, takin' thirty-feet-a-jump
He ain't never been caught, he ain't never been treed
Some folks say he looks a lot like me

[Verse 3]
The winter time's comin' and it's twenty-below
The river's froze over, where can he go?
We'll chase him up the holler, run him in the well
And shoot him in the bottom just to listen to him yell

[Chorus]
He's big around the middle and he's broad across the rump
Making ninety-miles-an-hour, takin' thirty-feet-a-jump
He ain't never been caught, he ain't never been treed
Some folks say he looks a lot like me
Some folks say he looks a lot like me
Some folks say he looks a lot like me
