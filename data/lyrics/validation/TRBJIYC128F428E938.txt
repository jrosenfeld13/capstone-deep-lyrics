Wanna see me waging a war on the world?
Wanna see me waging a war on the world?
Well, I will, I will
Just as all the good things come to an end
Even the survivors will die in the end, in the end

And my heart aches
My heart aches
And my heart aches
My heart aches
Inside

It really starts to hurt the more that you know
You lose a silver lining as the clouds unfold
But you know, you know
I lost a piece of mind, body and soul
I guess that evolution makes you a whore
Oh no

And my heart aches
My heart aches
And my heart aches
My heart aches
Inside

If only you, if only you
Couldn't break my heart
And I'll be seeing you some time
In another life
When this all goes wrong
