As we meet
Watching the really good ground?
Washing the memories away
There's something we shine its a feel?
There's something we care about

We're having a real good time
I guess this is the time of our lives
It's a pleasure to see u again
With nothing to care about

We're having a real good time
I guess this is the time of our lives
It's a pleasure to see u again
With nothing to care about

And soon, a pulley will float through the sky
A sight that nobody can deny
It's a pleasure to see him again
There's something we care about

We're having a real good time
I guess this is the time of our lives
It's a pleasure to see u again
With nothing to care about
