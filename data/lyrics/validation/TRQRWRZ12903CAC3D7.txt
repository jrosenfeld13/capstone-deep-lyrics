Don't say it's over so soon
We've tied to the day every wrong
We can wait in the shadows of mourning
But to wait just betrays what's to come
There's nothing, there's no one, no cause
And still we believed in it all

The sweet feeling's gone
The sweet feeling's gone

So they say with a pause
It's just moving on
But I can't see
No, I can't see
No, I can't see it at all

So they say with a pause
It's just moving on
But I can't see
No, I can't see it at all

The sweet feeling's gone
The sweet feeling's gone

So they say with a pause
It's just moving on
But I can't see
No, I can't see
No, I can't see it at all

The sweet feeling's gone
The sweet feeling's gone
With you
