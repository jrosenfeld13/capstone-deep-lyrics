You say
It's time to make a stand and make a clean sweep of this world
You say, you say
It's time to understand, if you don't shout you won't be heard
Never got a minute just to take it easy, always so busy in your ideology
Looking in your filofax if there is some time you can spend with me
Standing on the corner, waiting for you lonely, hoping you'll come along
You were at a meeting or a demonstration trying to save the earth, I should have known
Should have known

You say
You've got a few demands and those responsible will pay
You say, you say
It's time for reprimands and no one's gonna get away

Never got a minute just to take it easy, always so busy in your ideology
Looking in your filofax if there is some time you can spend with me
Standing on the corner, waiting for you lonely, hoping you'll come along
You were at a meeting or a demonstration trying to save the earth, I should have known
Should have known

Never got a minute just to have a good time, always so busy in your ideology
Looking in your filofax if there is some time you can spend with me
Standing on the corner, waiting for you lonely, hoping you'll come along
You were at a meeting or a demonstration trying to save the earth, I should have known

Standing on the corner, waiting for you lonely, hoping you'll come along
