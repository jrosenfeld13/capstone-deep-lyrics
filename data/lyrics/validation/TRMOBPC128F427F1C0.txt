For so long I tried to please
Evyerone around me
I didn't realize
I was wasting so much time
Alyways trying to achieve
Everything they asked of me
But no matter how much
It was never enough
I tried everything I had all that I knew
To give away what I should only give to You
Cause You're the One who made that sacriffce
The only One who paid the highest price
And for the One I now will live my life
Let everything be said and done be for the one
Well done my faithful son
Those are the words I long
I long to hear from You
Only from You
Show me the road to take
Let no part of me get in the way
All that I want is that Your will be done
Keep me faithful and true to Your heart
May I never forget who You are
Chorus
For the One who suffered and died
For the One who gave me new life
To the One I will life up My eyes
Chorus
