Up here alone in this room
Watching you come into view
Off in the distance where I want you to stay
Can't get you out of my mind
I'm tired of passing the time
I've got your picture and all I can do is try to look away

[Chorus]
You're in my telescope
You don't wanna get too close
It's easy to stay where you feel safe
You circle around at night and shine like a satellite
It's easier when you're far away

You disappear in the crowd
I scream but don't make a sound
I never know when you might come back again
So close but don't let me in
You still get under my skin:and it's showing
And all I can do is try to look away

[Chorus]
I'm a fool for every move
For coming back to you
I'm a fool afraid of love

You're in a telescope
You don't wanna get too close
It's easy to stay where you feel safe

[Chorus]
