Close your eyes and rest your head on me
I will keep you safe from all your fears
I know I hurt you, let you down
Broke your heart and left you in a thousand tears

There's no changing yesterday
And I know who stood by me and who walked away

I will be there for you now
There's no reason to come back down
I will be there for you now
Leave the sorrow here to drown

Where we've been no one will understand
How you stood by me when no one gave a damn
I say I'm sorry but they're just words to use
Please give me this one last chance to prove to you

There's no changing yesterday
And I know who stood by me and who walked away

I will be there for you now
There's no reason to come back down
I will be there for you now
Leave the sorrow here to drown

You can close your eyes now, leave it all behind
You can close your eyes now, leave it all behind

I will be there for you now
There's no reason to come back down
I will be there for you now
Leave the sorrow here to drown

I will be there, I will be there for you now
