Every time I open my mouth I feel a little bit lower and a little bit slower
At times I feel like time and space are a race and I'm feeling like I'm chopping a mountain inside
And I feel like this is why

Why!
Why!
Why!
Why!
Whhh!

Every time I open my mouth I feel a little
Every time I open my mouth I feel a little
Every time I open my mouth I feel a little
Every time I open my mouth I feel a little... shit!

Sounds like shit
Sounds like shit
Sounds like shit
Sounds like shit

Every time I'm looking for you I set a bear trap open every wire I go, design
Life's tweak in timed sequence getting operatic over cuz its already started
Its life
But I feel like my life
Isn't mine
Isn't mine
Isn't mine
Isn't mine
Isn't maaa!
Life...life...life...

Every time I open my mouth I feel a little... shhh
Every time I open my mouth I feel a little... shhh
Every time I open my mouth I feel a little... shhh
Every time I open my mouth I feel a little... shhh
Shhh
Shhh
Shhh

Shit
Sounds like shit
Sounds like shit
Sounds like shit
Sounds like shit

Sounds like shit
Sounds like shit
Sounds like shit
Sounds like shit
Sounds like shit
Sounds like shit
Sounds like shit
Sounds like shit
Sounds like shit
Sounds like shit
Sounds like shit
Sounds like shit
Sounds like shit

Same scene
Daydream
Like mind
Daze
Same scene
Daydream
Like mind
Daze
Daze
Daze
Daze...

With both of these noble thighs wrapped firmly around my neck
I do believe I've found my way to go soaring off the wall
I took them to fall
Tube around the back misshapen a world thats filled with giants feasting
