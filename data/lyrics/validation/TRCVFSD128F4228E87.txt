[Verse 1:]
Too many storms have passed your way
And you're all washed out cause it rained on your parade
Seems nobody cares about you anyway
Now you're living your life like a castaway
Searched for strength inside was it all in vain
Cause the deeper you dig you find more and more pain
Don't let your tomorrow be like yesterday
Cause I spoke to God, I called out your name
And on your behalf, I just asked if He would be there for you
I want you to

[Chorus:]
Be blessed, don't live life in distress
Just let go, let God
He'll work it out for you
I pray that your soul will be blessed
Forever in his rest
'Cause you deserve his best no less

[Verse 2:]
Enter a place where you never have to cry
Never have to live a lie, never have to wonder why
Never want for nothing you're always satisfied
In the peace that his arms will provide
He will erase any guilt or shame, any bad habits you've got
You won't wanna do em again, Yes we all can change, I can testify
See I spoke to God, I called out your name
And on your behalf, I just asked, If he would be there for you
I want you to

[Chorus:]
Be blessed, don't live life in distress
Just let go, let God
He'll work it out for you
I pray that your soul will be blessed
Forever in his rest
'Cause you deserve his best no less

[Bridge:]
My prayer for you today, Is that you trust and always obey
On his name keep calling
He'll keep you from falling
He'll supply the answers
Yes He will, if you stand in faith
And trust Him to make a way out of no way

[Chorus:]
Be blessed, don't live life in distress
Just let go, let God
He'll work it out for you
I pray that your soul will be blessed
Forever in his rest
'Cause you deserve his best no less

Be blessed from the bottom of your feet
To the crown of your head
Your life be blessed
Your family be blessed
Your finances be blessed
Everything about you
