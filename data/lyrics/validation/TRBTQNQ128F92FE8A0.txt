I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses
One for every time you've broke my heart
And as the door of love between us closes
Tears will fall like pedals when we part
I begged you to be different but you've always been untrue
I'm tired of forgiving and there is nothing left to do
So I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses
One for every time you broke my heart

You've made our lovers lane a road of sorrow
'til at last we had to say goodbye
You're leaving me to face each new tomorrow
With a heart that you tought how to cry
I know that I should hate you after all you've put me through
But how can I be bitter when I'm still in love with you
I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses
One for every time you've broke my heart
