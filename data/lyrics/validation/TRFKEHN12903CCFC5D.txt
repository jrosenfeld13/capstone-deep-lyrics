We're standing in front of the fire on this faux-summer night
It just takes one spark and we'll burn this whole place down
I love the way your eyes turned red when the city hall burned bright
As red as the blood from my arm searching for colours

We'll burn this whole place down
I think I'm ready now
As red as the blood from my arms
To take the life of someone who should die
We'll burn this whole place down
Send the rich kids to war
And keep the poor at home

Don't curse me, sweet Mary. about your lucky destiny
I'd slit my throat for your liberty and my mother shouldn't cry
I'm waiting for a sign from god or his son, don't call him Christ
I lost faith years ago when I came to love life

We'll burn this whole place down
The leader of the apocalypse
As red as the blood from my arms
Will come to save us now
We'll burn this whole place down
He will kill us one by one
As red as the blood from my arms
Until he's the last to fall

We'll burn this place
We'll burn this place down
We'll burn this place
We'll burn it to the ground
