Start pulling your weight way over the track
____ to wait for the train
To escape through the black hole in your swollen mind with stolen rhyme
So _______ who is _____ ________? They're weak no doubt
You amount to nothing left so I'm, gonna take you way back, climb
Over platinum made back lines
When it was laid back not about pay checks back to the apex
Im gonna take you back in time
Me and my boys, had a ploy to make some noise
Underground, invisible but not unheard our words destroy
Any decoy by default cause we _____ by the _______ with sea salt
Under our boots, juiced with that robot boost
Nowadays im searchin for substance
But end up feelin so empty till im tempted to quit
But I know the world needs our shit
Holdin on to animosity towards that radio rap is rancid
It eats me up inside the entertain in hip-hop has died
I can see it in black in white on the front page
Of my biggest fears over the hill and back
Again my friends im here till the back is bendin breaks
Take, my word like medicine
If you got fetishes for good music
With _______ to change, to producin this strange
But im just doin my thang
And im a keep doin my thang
Till people dont wanna hear it bang
Im just doin my thang

With elements of change
Deep fellas with their aim
To hit that bulls eye centerfold
Spin it, turn it, burn it, rearrange till somethin bangs
I used to hit the ______ scrapin in the 70 Plymouth
Tapes in my lab 4 cd's in a dash were __________

No ________ ________ off chillin
That's not to say im soft, just free you be illin
Let me get my paint right for the children
It's faint might fade away
They do it to make a killin nowadays
I was one lone ranger
Before hip-hop was the back drop to a stranger life
Wasn't angels light shown to me
Strong gone through me in my long johns and hoodie
I got my footing now, hike
Who spiked the punch? That chump tried to dare on my light
But I medicate with music
And set it straight for fools with a black hole inside
The truest I can be I will ride for my family and friends
Makin beautiful art to the, to the...
________ on the range
With elements of change
Deep fellas with their aim
To hit that bulls eye centerfold
Spin it, turn it, burn it, rearrange till somethin bangs
