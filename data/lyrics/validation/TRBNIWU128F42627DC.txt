I'm sad when I'm gone
But I'm leaving again
What do you think?
Could you even care?

I tried to be strong
But I wanna cry
So I hold you close
As I say goodbye

And I'm sorry I won't be
With you tonight
When you close your eyes

And I feel so guilty
As I walk away from you again

You know that I want the best for you
And I hope that you will write
If I had it my way
I could be with you tonight
I am coming home to you
I can finally see the light
And if I should make it through
I will be with you tonight

To have and to hold
Protect and provide
All you should need
I won't deny

And I need to see
That smile on your face
The look in your eyes
It takes me away

I'm sorry I won't be
With you tonight
But you're on my mind

And I feel so helpless
All I want is just to be with you again

You know that I want the best for you
And I hope that you will write
If I had it my way
I could be with you tonight
I am coming home to you
I can finally see the light
And if I should make it through
I will be with you tonight

I've been away for so long
It's been so hard on my own
I think about you every single day
I can't wait to come back home

You know that I want the best for you
And I hope that you will write
If I had it my way
I could be with you tonight
I am coming home to you
I can finally see the light
And if I should make it through
I will be with you tonight
I will be with you tonight
