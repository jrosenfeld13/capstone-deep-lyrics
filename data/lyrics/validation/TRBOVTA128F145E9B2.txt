You Instantly awakened my imagination
Old fashioned infatuation
I can be anything that you want me to be
And you can have me in every position that you dreamed
I know you've got a wild streak
You're a freak
You're alone in your bed with graphic images in your head

Let me do what I want to do with you
Let me tie you down pick you up and
Flip you all around
Let me tell you how sexy you are
As I'm going down on you in the car
If feeling this good is a sin
Let's do it all over again

Just when I thought this might get boring
Wake me up in the morning by pouring
Honey on my body and licking it off
You're taking me to concerts and you're taking off your top
I know you've got a wild streak
You're a freak
Then you're back in our room with the bride and the groom

This is it
This is great
This is what I always wanted
Where do we go from here?
That's the question of the year
I think you're fine
I think you're hot
This is what I always dreamed of
The one thing I forgot
Was to get to know you
