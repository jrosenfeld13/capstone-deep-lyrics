I sleep on bugs and rust
I don't know why trees made her cry
She's just a mucky bug

Oh No! Here we go!
And I want more!
Can I get any more?

I met my maker in the grass
While rocks, they burn my guts
Protecting plants through sodium
It burns and boils my blood

Get out!
Oh no!
And I want more
Can I get any more?
Wow

The he judge he said, "You call yourself a man?"
"I'm just a man, I'm just a man" I said
My love she said, "You call yourself a man?"
"But I'm just a man, I'm just a man" I said

Wow
And I want more
Can I get any more?
And I want wow

More and more, please give me more
Please my love, please give me more
Please my love no more
