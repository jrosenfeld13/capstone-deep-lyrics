Well, it's a rock, rock, rockabilly boogie

Well, I know a little spot on the edge of town
Where you can really dig 'em up and set 'em down
It's a little place called, The Hideaway
You do the rockabilly till the break of day

Well, it's a rock, rock, rockabilly boogie
A rock, rock, rockabilly boogie
A rock, rock, rockabilly boogie
A rock, rock, rockabilly boogie
A rock, rock, rockabilly boogie tonight

Well, they kick off their shoes, gettin' ready to bop
They're gonna rockabilly wearin' their socks
You wiggle your hip, feel the thrill
So come on, little baby, do the rockabilly-bill

Well, it's a rock, rock, rockabilly boogie
A rock, rock, rockabilly boogie
A rock, rock, rockabilly boogie
A rock, rock, rockabilly boogie
A rock, rock, rockabilly boogie tonight

Well, there's little ol' Suzie, turnin' seventeen
Well, everybody knows her as a rockabilly queen
And there's Ol' Slim, as quiet as a mouse
He grabs Ol' Suzie, they'll tear up the house

Well, it's a rock, rock, rockabilly boogie
A rock, rock, rockabilly boogie
A rock, rock, rockabilly boogie
A rock, rock, rockabilly boogie
A rock, rock, rockabilly boogie tonight
