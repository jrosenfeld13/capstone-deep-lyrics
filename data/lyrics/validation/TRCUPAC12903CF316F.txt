Severed Heads
Bad Mood Guy
Hot With Fleas
I am covered in filth, at least it's my own
My smell, well, you know you can't get higher
One day in my life is six in your old
With filth, it's all a little faster
I am off the leash and hot with fleas, family couldn't be stronger
I am off your leash and hot with fleas
Hang your head, hang your head in shame! Hang your head in shame!
"Yeah, well, you can't take away my self-respect. Written at a bad time
For feelings but a good time for wising up."
