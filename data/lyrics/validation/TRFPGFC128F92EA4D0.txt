The children settle down so safe and sound, and when the mourning comes again I'm here to hold your head. But I can see you feather the nest with a dusty hope, you swoon and moan, there's water in your bones
So you can keep a dresser full of sympathy, you're haunted by a better ghost than me. It's sad to see you cry when we're so near
Such happy pilgrims now, so safe and sound, and when the winter comes again I'm here to hold your head. But I can see we feather the nest with rust and soap, we coo and groan, there's magnets in our bones
So you can keep a dresser full of baby teeth, you're haunted by a better ghost than me. But take away the weight of where we've been and there'd be nothing left for us to talk about
