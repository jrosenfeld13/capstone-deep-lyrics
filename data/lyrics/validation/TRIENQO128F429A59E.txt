Did you say it's all over? It was me not a whisper
The marriage is over, was it me or my heart?
Justify all affection, beyond recollection
I was fine in Virginia, guess it's true what I said

Wake up, get up, get out, break up
Just say goodbye for today
I'm wearing my blue hat for a blue day is all we need
Please my love, release the things that I touch

Please my girl, release the story of love
Swim with love, don't lose that magical part of you
My, sweet blue girl

You're heading to lose your blue hat for a blue day
Is all we need
A blue hat for a blue day is all we need

But you can't understand what i hold in my hand
It's only God, how I miss you
My blue times that rain so hard

But you can't understand what I hold in my hand
It's only God, how I miss you
My blue times that came so hard, blue for you
Blue for you, did you say it's all over"

Leaving for Minnesota, the marriage is over
Was it me or my heart? Please my love
Don't lose the story of love

Blue hat for a blue day is all we need
A blue hat for a blue day, a blue hat for a blue day
Blue day, blue day, a blue day, it's all over

I guess it's all over for us two
But you can't understand my blue day
