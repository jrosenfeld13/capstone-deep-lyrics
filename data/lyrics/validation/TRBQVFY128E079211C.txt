Oh lord
Oh lord, You've made it....

You wanna drag your vessel
You wanna hush your voices

You better drag your... you better hush your...

I'll remember that I'll need to carry on
I'll pretend you're not around, I'll forget you
Just like everyone else, I'll forget you
Is there anybody around, I'll forget you
Just like anyone
Just because, just because, just because
Do you come here ohhh
Shiver around, shiver around

Oh Lord, oh lord, you've made it....

You wanna drag your vessel
You wanna hush your voices

...hush your mouth
