Alone tonight
Id rather be by your side
As I drift out to sea
I think I should be in another place
Closer to the lips on your face

But now Im even further away
Now Im even further away
Now Im even further away
Now Im even further away

I started a fire and burned it down
My one desire is that beautiful sound
The sound of your voice
Tickling inside my mind now

But now Im even further away
Now Im even further away
Now Im even further away
Now Im even further away
From your secret sky
Ringlets of your hair in your eyes
