Walk down to the beach and what do I see
Non local cars blocking up our streets
Don't they know the beach is for locals only
Don't they know they can't surf on our beach

This beach is for locals only
Don't they know thacn't surf on our beach
This beach is for locals only
Take your silly ass and get it off of our streets
Gonna have to kick you out, gonna have to teach you why
This beach is for locals only

Go into the local store and what do I see
Out of town goons in front of me
Have no idea what they're doing around here
I think I'll hit 'em with this empty bottle of beer

Going into my waters and what do I see
Out of town fagots in front of my
All I want to know is what they're doing on my waves
Gonna have to show 'em how we behave
