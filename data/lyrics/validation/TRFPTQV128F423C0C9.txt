[Hook: Amy + (Mutya)]
B boy, be my baby
(Won't you be my baby?)
My one and only baby
(Be my baby now)
B boy, be my baby
(Be my baby now)
My one and only baby
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
B boy, be my baby
(Won't you be my baby?)
My one and only baby
(Be my baby now)
B boy, be my baby
(Be my baby now)
My one and only baby
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 1: Mutya]
It was winter time
You know what they say
Did you think about us?
Did you miss your baby?
I'm gonna catch the train
Cause I'm heading your way
You're my number one
That's all a new born son
Won't you be my king?
(Won't you be my king?)
Cause I know you care
Did a dance for you
And when I'm done
I'm gonna do it again?
And when it's over
I'm gonna pull you closer
Keep your Nike's on
You know how we do
There's nothing he won't try
We like two stars in the sky

[Pre-Hook 1: Mutya]
You are my rainy day's Sunshine
It's plan to see
My heat in the cold of Winter
Just so right for me
So won't you please?

[Hook: Amy + (Mutya)]
B boy, be my baby
(Won't you be my baby?)
My one and only baby
(Be my baby now)
B boy, be my baby
(Be my baby now)
My one and only baby
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2: Mutya]
There are two in the air
If you feel like me
Someone who cares for, so freaky
In demand by all the ladies
It's not for sale
It's being home delivered to me
So hang up all your trying cards please
(He's my baby)
Lovesick cause that's what I get
I hear his voice then things get wet
Knows what I want
And then he'll fetch
He's my boo
And I'm his little pet, his little pet
You never know what he'll do next
He's my baby

[Pre-Hook 2: Mutya]
My rainy day's bright sunshine
Live in fantasy
My heat in the cold of Winter
Just so right for me
So won't you please?

[Hook: Amy + (Mutya)]
B boy, be my baby
(Won't you be my baby?)
My one and only baby
(Be my baby now)
B boy, be my baby
(Be my baby now)
My one and only baby
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
B boy, be my baby
(Won't you be my baby?)
My one and only baby
(Be my baby now)
B boy, be my baby
(Be my baby now)
My one and only baby
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
