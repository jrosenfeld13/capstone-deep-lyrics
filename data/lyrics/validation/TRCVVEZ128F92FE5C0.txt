[Chorus]
We connect
When we're together it's so perfect
Boy, you shock me with your wide hot love
I start to overload, I explode when we connect

[Verse 1]
It's no exaggeration, not imagination
You're the finest boy around
Playing with temptation, overnight sensation
With a boy from the wrong side of town

[Pre-Chorus]
Give me your love and affection
Dance with me tonight
Give me all of your attention
Dancing in love's light

[Chorus]
We connect
When we're together it's so perfect
Boy, you shock me with your wide hot love
I start to overload, I explode when we connect
