She said what I was supposed to think
Thank God for freedom
Thank God for liberation, yeah
Now we are allowed to think (allowed to think)
Now we are allowed to feel (allowed to feel)
Lust without cute boring love

But don't you ever just like me
Long for purity
And don't you ever
Get so sick of our territories

What are you so scared of sister
What made you so afraid to feel (to feel)
To choose (to choose)
This stone cold liberation
The one thing I hate most about me
Is the one thing you want to make your trademark
To feel lust without cute boring love

But don't you ever just like me
Long for purity
And don't you ever
Get so sick of our territories

And don't you ever feel like glass (don't you ever)
Fragile, hurting, letting it pass (don't you ever)
And don't you ever
Don't you think it's time to trespass

But when the fire is gone
Who are you?
Who are you now?
Who are you?

(What are you so scared of?)
But I'm just scared
(What are you so scared of?)
Of you
(What are you so scared of?)
What are you so scared of, sister?
What are you so scared of?

Don't you ever just like me
Long for purity
And don't you ever
Get so sick of our territories

And don't you ever feel like glass (don't you ever)
Fragile, hurting, letting it pass (don't you ever)
And don't you ever
Don't you think it's time

And don't you ever feel like glass (don't you ever)
Fragile, hurting, letting it pass (don't you ever)
And don't you ever
Don't you think it's time to trespass
