Come on dance with me
Inside of me
Come on Baby...
Come on Dance...

If you wanna dance with me
Don't be shy just follow me
But you'd better think twice baby
What you get is what you see

Come on dance with me
Inside of me
Come on dance with me
Inside of me

Come on dance with me
Inside of me
Come on dance with me
Inside of me

If you wanna dance with me
Don't be shy just follow me
But you'd better think twice baby
What you get is what you see

Come on dance with me
Inside of me

Come on dance with me
Inside of me
Come on dance with me
Inside of me

Come on baby...
Come on dance...
