Caress me baby
Like the wind caress the trees
Caress me baby
Like the wind caress the trees
I want you to love, love me baby
Like a soft, soft summer breeze

Down by the river
On a real moonlighted night
Down by the river
On a real moonlighted night
I want to love, love you baby
Everything will be all right
