My baby wears her dress so short
Way up above her knees
My baby wears her dress so short
Way up above her knees
Says she's gonna show her big fine legs
To just anybody she please

The men all crazy about you
The boys are watching you too
I looked across the street girl
There stood nobody but you

Wearing that short dress baby
Way up above your knees
Says she's gonna show her big fine legs
To just anybody she please

I give a party last week
You came a taken the prize
Wearing that dress so short woman
Way up above your thighs

Said my baby wears her dress so short
Way up above her knees
Says she's gonna show her big fine legs
To just anybody she please
