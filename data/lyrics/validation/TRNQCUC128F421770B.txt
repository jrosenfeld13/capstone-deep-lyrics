I'm goin' down south where I don't have to hurry
I don't have to hurry, I don't need to worry
I'm goin' down south where I don't have to hurry
And I ain't gonna worry no more

Might be Memphis, Tennessee
Let that sweet soul music wash over me
Mississippi River movin' nice and slow
And I won't have to worry no more

Yeah, I really dig it down in South Austin
It's a good place for me to get lost in
And go to Loco Maria's, eat some migas tacos
And I ain't gonna worry no more

Some people say I'm just runnin' away
I just can't take it another day
Things around here movin' way too fast
Every time I turn around another year is past

I'm goin' down south, I don't have to hurry
I don't have to hurry, I don't need to worry
I'm goin' down south where I don't need to worry
Ain't gonna worry no more

Some people say I'm just runnin' away
I can't take it another day
Things around here movin' way too fast
Every time I turn around another day has past

So I'm goin' down south where I don't have to hurry
I don't have to hurry, no, no need to worry
I'm goin' down south where I don't have to hurry
And I ain't gonna worry no more

Go to Eureka Springs, Arkansas
Get with my friends now, play some guitar
Floatin' with Sally down the Buffalo
And I ain't gonna worry no more

Oh, maybe I'll go down to San Diego
Sit on the beach, watch the day go
Buy myself a surf board and hasta luego
And I ain't gonna worry no more

Goin' down south, don't have to hurry
I don't have to hurry, I don't have to hurry
I'm goin' down south where I don't need to worry
I ain't gonna worry no more

Goin' down south, I don't have to hurry
I don't need to worry, refuse to hurry
I'm goin' down south where I don't have to hurry
And I ain't gonna worry no more

And I ain't gonna worry no more
I ain't gonna worry no more
Gonna worry no more
