[intro]

Die!

I gave in to
The stress in life
I can't escape
The pressure seems to get me down

It's like a needle in my spine
It stings inside
Poisons me with time
I can't deal with your lies

[Chorus]

I wish I could watch you drown and die
And take my time
(Lies)
It's always been a problem, can't you see?
I don't get
(Your lies)

[verse]

People have said (They have said)
I'm not okay (I'm not okay)
I lost my mind, numb me 'til I won't feel pain again

It's like a needle in my spine
It stings inside
Poisons me with time
I won't deal with your lies

[Chorus]

I wish I could watch you drown and die
And take my time
(Lies)
It's always been a problem, can't you see?
I don't get
(Your lies)

[Chorus]

Life is gone
I have no one
Life is good
I am no one

Life is gone
I have no one
Life is scarred
I am no one

Life is gone
I have a lie

[verse]

Something, something inside of my mind
Let it all go and tie me to your fight
Nothing is real inside, just the lies
Something keeps building you high with lies

[Chorus]

I wish I could watch you drown and die
And take my time
(Lies)
It's always been a problem, can't you see?
I don't bend
(The lies)

[outro]

I wish I could watch you drown and die
And take my time
(Lies)
It's always been a problem, can't you see?
I don't bend
