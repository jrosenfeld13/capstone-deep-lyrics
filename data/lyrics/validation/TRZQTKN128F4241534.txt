Why do I learn enough to just get by?
Enough to make my family cry
Will I ever escape and would it ever last?
Or will I crawl back?
This is not the life I asked for
I'm face to face with all my demons
Turnmy head but can't ignore
This state I'm in
Will I get to the next?
Will I ever get to have some rest?
Knowing that everything's all good
Barely scraping by, never ahead
Sick of asking help from friends
Will I ever wake up before it's out of hand
When will I learn?
I tell myself to calm down
Sit back,just relax
No need for a heart attack
But I'm having trouble shaking disappointment
Sorry Mom and Dad
