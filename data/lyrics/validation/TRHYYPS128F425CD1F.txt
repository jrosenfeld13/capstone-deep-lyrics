You think I love you
For just one day
To you my love it may
Be the way it seems

But I love the way you carry yourself
I even love the way you wear your hair
Ain't that loving you, ain't that loving you
For more reasons than one?

Somehow, my love
You've been misled
Despite the things
That other man said

But I love the way you carry yourself
I even love the way you wear your hair
Ain't that loving you, ain't that loving you
For more reasons than one? Oh yes indeed

Did it ever occur to you why I do
All that any man can do?
You keep a smile on your face
It's because I love you, I love you
I love you in so many ways

Somehow, my love
You've been misled
Despite the things
That other man said

But I love the way you carry yourself
I even love the way you wear your hair
Ain't that loving you, ain't that loving you
For more reasons than one?

Don't you know I love you?
From the depths of my heart
I love you, darling
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you
Mmmmmmm, I never find you.....
