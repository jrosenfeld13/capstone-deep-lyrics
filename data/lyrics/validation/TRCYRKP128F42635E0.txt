All washed out and faded to gray
Color comes and goes with ebbs and flows
And a little less vivid each time
Whiled away some time looking in your eyes
Smiled at every smile (it seemed a loss)
Seemed a loss

An orange glow goes on all day
Some blues and browns with ups and downs
It may just be a dream
Coiled up and cold
Risked it and sweated it
Shed another shell
Both ends burning well
Burning well

The colors came through not bright but true
Then did a fade as the music played

Rode out the hour
Watching for anything
Not really believing
It seemed a loss
