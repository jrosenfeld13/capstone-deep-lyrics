Breathing
Feel it on my skin
Your breathing
Falling to your arms again
Spread my wings and fly
Hold my head up high
Feels like summer wind
When you're breathing
Breathing
Breathing
Everytime I close my eyes
When the stars begin to rise
I feel like I could fly
You're the reason why
When i need to have you near
Drowning in my tears
The colors fade to grey
You wash them all away
Morning sun
You're the one
Deep within
I hear you breathing
Breathing
Feel it on my skin
Your breathing
Falling to your arms again
Spread my wings and fly
Hold my head up high
Feels like summer wind
When you're breathing
Oh when you're breathing
Breathing
