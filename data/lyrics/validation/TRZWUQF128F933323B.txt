Well in North Carolina, way back in the hills
Lived my pappy and he had him a still
He brewed white lightning 'till the sun went down
And then he'd fill him a jug, an' pass it around
Mighty, mighty pleasin', you're pappy's corn squeezin'
White Lightning

Yeah, the G-men, T-men, revenurers too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were lookin', tryin' to book him
But my pappy kept on cookin'
White Lightning

Well I asked my pappy why call it brew
White lightning, 'stead of mountain dew
I took on sip and then I knew
As my eyes bugged out and my face turned blue
Mighty, mighty pleasin', you're pappy's corn squeezin'
White Lightning

Yeah, G-men, T-men, revenuers too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were lookin', tryin' book him
But my pappy kept on cookin'
White Lightning

Well, a city slicker came, and said "I'm mighty tough."
"I think I want to taste that powerful stuff."
He took one s..slug and he drank it right down
And I heard him a-moanin' as he hit the ground
Mighty, mighty pleasin', you're pappy's corn squeezin'
White Lightning

Yeah, G-men, T-men, revenuers too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were lookin', tryin' book him
But my pappy kept on cookin'
White Lightning!
