Oh
Woo
Ah yeah
Tender lover
Everybody

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Tender lover
Tender love

[Verse 1]
Eleanor Rigby spends half her life all alone
No fault of her own
Made a decision
Love has no place in her home
Love it has a right to go

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Love has no limit
If you believe in love it'll open up, so
Don't ever give in
'Cause if it starts to give just hold on
We didn't make it
Love'll get you by if you only try
Just don't give up on love 'cause it didn't work out this time

[Chorus]
Tender lover
Girl, I'm so sorry
Well, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to break your heart
Tender lover
So brokenhearted
Well, I never meant to break your
Break your little tender heart

My tender lover
Hoo

[Verse 2]
Don't ever give up in spite of our love
Love is much too precious
It's greater than both of us
There's more than enough
Keep looking for love
Just be a believer
It'll give you what you want

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Sky is the limit
If you believe in love it'll open up, so
Don't ever give in
'Cause if it starts to give just hold on
We didn't make it
Love'll get you by if you only try
Just don't give up on love 'cause it didn't work out
Said it didnt work out this time

[Chorus]
Tender lover
Girl, I'm so sorry
Well, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to break your heart
Tender lover
So brokenhearted
Well, I never meant to break your
Break your little tender heart

[Rap: Bobby Brown]
Now squeeze my, my lovely tender lover
When Im undercover
Im not like any other brother
Like Face, hes nothing like the man Bob
And like Tide, hes giving you a wash job
Hung you out to drip-dry
Ill never do that to ya, cause youre too fly
And when I saw ya, I scoped ya like a veteran
He shouldnta broke your heart and been a better man

(L.A., get Bob outta here!)
(Bobby: A yo, man; come on, man.)
(Get him outta here! L.A., get him out!)
(Bobby: Lets go.)
(Now!)

Oh-oooh-oh, oh-oooh-oh, oh baby
Tender lover, love, love, lover

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Love aint a limit
You believe in love itll open up, so
Dont ever give in
Because if starts, hold on
We didnt make it
Lovell get you by if you only try
Just dont give up on love cause it didnt work out
Said it didnt work out this time

[Chorus]
Tender lover
Girl, I'm so sorry
Well, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to break your heart
Tender lover
So brokenhearted
Well, I never meant to break your
Break your little tender heart

Didnt know your all-in tender lover, baby
Didnt know your all-in tender love
(Never meant to break your heart. Tender lover.)
Didnt know your all-in tender lover, baby
Didnt know your all-in tender love

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Tender lover, tender love)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Tender lover, tender love)

Dont ever give up, in spite of our love
Never, ever, never, ever
Dont ever give up, in spite of our love
Never, ever, never, ever

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Tender lover, tender love)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Tender lover, tender love)
