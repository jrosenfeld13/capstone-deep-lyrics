You're sailing away, to another shore
My heartache today, I can't tell you anymore

And I thought I saw your shadow in the street today
But that was yesterday, oh that was yesterday

With a little courage, in time
You might forgive me
With a little loving, in time
You might forgive me

Believe me I know it's been hard for you
There's never an easy way to let it go

And I dreamt that you were telling me you dreamt of me
But now I'm waking up, I think I'm waking up

With a little courage, in time
You might forgive me
With a little loving, in time
You might forgive me

And I thought I saw your jacket in my room today
But that was yesterday, oh was that yesterday?

With a little courage, in time
You might forgive me
With a little loving, in time
You might forgive me
