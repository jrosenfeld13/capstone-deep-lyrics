I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do?
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning with much alarm
British museum had lost it's charm

How long I wondered
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles hadn't past
For, suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town
The sun was shining everywhere

For, suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town
The sun was shining everywhere

Everywhere
Everywhere
Everywhere
