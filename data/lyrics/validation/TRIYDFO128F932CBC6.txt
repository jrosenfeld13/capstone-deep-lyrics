I left a note on his dresser
And my old wedding ring
With these few goodbye words
How can I sing
Goodbye old sleepy head
I'm packing you in like I said

Take care of everything
I'm leaving my wedding ring
Don't look for me
I'll get a hand
Remember darling
Don't smoke in bed

Don't look for me
I'll get a hand
Remember darling
Don't smoke in bed
