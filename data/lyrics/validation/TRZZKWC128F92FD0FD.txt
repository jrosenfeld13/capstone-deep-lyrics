Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Oh honey
Why you got to be so mean?
Don't you
(Don't you remember me?)
Oh baby, baby
You and me, you and me, you and me
We build sandcastles in the Serengeti
(Don't you remember me)
You splashed my face with Nile water
Daughter of Diaspora
You named me, claimed me

[Chorus}
Do you remember me?
(Do you remember me?)
Do you remember me? (Oh)
Do you remember me?(Me)
Do you remember me?

[Verse 2]
Remember playing pinball right on 23rd street
(K-I-N-G)
I was there, I remember
When you got your first pair of sneaks
(Oh the are phat!)
Mmm Converse I think
(Do you)
I remember you swore you were so big and bad
You walked around like your mmm didn't stink
(You can't beat everybody)
But I was there always been there
I remember that it did, ooh it did

[Bridge]
I remember you lovin' me
It was so beautiful
(Magical, wonderful)
I remember loving you
So good, so good, so good

[Chorus]
Do you remember me?
(Do you remember me?)
Do you remember me?(Oh)
Do you remember me?(Me)
Do you remember me?
Do you remember me?

[Spoken]
I mean, for real (Do you remember me?)
Don't you remember those days
Way back when we spoke Kiswahili (Do you remember me?)
It was you and me
See, remember playing hide and go freak
I was that one you were born to seek (Do you remember me?)
And I'm still here

[Singing]
Getting down, getting down (Do you remember me?)
Getting down, getting down
Getting down, getting down, for you
Getting down, getting down (Do you remember me?)
Getting down, getting down
Getting down, getting down, for you
