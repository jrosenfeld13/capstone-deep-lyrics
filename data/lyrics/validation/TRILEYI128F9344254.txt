[Verse 1]
You've been down for so long
Can't seem to find out what's wrong
Though I've tried and tried
To see what's behind those dark eyes

[Chorus]
And then you try
To hand me a line
Like it's alright for me to be unkind
Oh, you swine

[Verse 2]
Can't you see what you've done
You've got me on the run
Girl, you know I've cried
Night after night
Pardon me

[Chorus]
But if you get time
Please drop me a line
Some little white lines
Would blow my mind
Yeah!
It'll be fun

[Interlude]
Ow!
One more time

[Verse 3]
If you could be with me now
I'd make you see it somehow
But you won't take the time
To see what's inside of my mind

[Chorus]
But if you get time
Please send me a line
Or maybe two
To blow my mind
I'll be there for a time
But then we'll say bye
