Now asks sweet mama
Lemme be her kid
She says, 'I might get boogied
Like to keep it hid'

Well, she looked at me
She be-gin to smile
Says, 'I thought I would use you
For my man a while

'Tha-at you just don't my husband
Catch you there
Now, just-just don't let my

Husband catch you there'

Now, went upstair
To pack my leavin' trunk
I never saw no whiskey
The blues done made me, sloppy drunk

Say, I never saw no whiskey
Blues done made me sloppy drunk
Now, I never saw no whiskey
But the blues done made me sloppy drunk

Now some said, disease
Some said it was, degree'in
But it's the slow consumption
Killin' you by degrees
Lord, it's the slow consumption
Killin' you by degrees
Now, it's-a slow consumption
An it's killin' you by degrees

(piano & strings to end)
