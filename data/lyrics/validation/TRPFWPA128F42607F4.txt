Long and lean, a silver queen
Have you ever seen such a flying machine?
Hits the ground as fast as sound
Seven hundred thousand pounds of little pieces lying around
The Widowmaker is a real brain-shaker
The Widowmaker is a silver queen
The Widowmaker is a real heartbreaker
The Widowmaker is long and lean

Easy to fly like a pie in the sky
Do you wanna try? A good way to die
Dive through the clouds with a scream really loud
Hold your head proud and wind up in a shroud

The Widowmaker is a real brain-shaker
The Widowmaker is easy to fly
The Widowmaker is a young life taker
The Widowmaker is a pie in the sky
The Widowmaker is a good way to die
The Widowmaker
The Widowmaker
The Widowmaker, a good way to die
Hold your head proud, wind up in a shroud
Dive through the clouds with a scream really loud
The Widowmaker
The Widowmaker
