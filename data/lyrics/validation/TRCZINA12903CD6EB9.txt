Detroit couldn't rock itself out of a paper bag
Gene Simmons looks kinda cool
But Paul Stanley kinda looks like a jag
Ace Frehley can play guitar
But he ain't no fucking Kerry King
So get your ass out of the way
Here comes a rock revolution

Listen up cause I'm about to sing
The creatures of the night
Can't hold a candle to this
We'll be kickin' ass we'll be takin' names
When we're bigger than Kiss
I never thought cocaine
Could be as good as this
We'll live our lives in alcoholic bliss
When we're bigger than Kiss
Rock!

Me and Charlie we have it loud
Yeah you know we rock and roll all night
Paul Stanley fell down on stage and broke a hip
Let's hope he's not alright
The ladies don't like old men
Now my love gun is the one in demand
And we're gonna go down in history
As the world's greatest rock 'n' roll band

The creatures of the night
Can't hold a candle to this
We'll be kickin' ass we'll be takin' names
When we're bigger than Kiss
Calling Dr. Love hey geta load of this
Ray beat the piss out of Peter Criss
Now we're bigger than Kiss
