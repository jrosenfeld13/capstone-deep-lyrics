Sentimental creeps and cops
Congressmen and debutantes
Wander up and down the avenue
They don't know world's a bore
Everything's been done before
And I'm so tired, that change is overdue

And it's blah, blah, blah on the radio
Blah, blah, blah on remote control
Blah, blah, blah on the TV too
Blah, blah, blah means nothing new
Blah, blah, blah for me and blah for you
... blah, blah, blah

I tried sex, but sex is dumb
Rub some bits and wait to come
Staring at the ceiling is a drag

And itis blah, blah, blah on the radio
Blah, blah, blah on remote control
Blah, blah, blah on the TV too
Blah, blah, blah means nothing new
Blah, blah, blah for me and blah for you
... blah, blah, blah

I tried God, but God's a fake
Whitewash fathers on the make
And I don't need a pedofile with pew

And it's blah, blah, blah on the radio
Blah, blah, blah on remote control
Blah, blah, blah on the TV too
Blah, blah, blah means nothing new
Blah, blah, blah for me and blah for you
... blah, blah, blah
