I remember thinking
That you'd never leave
Praying in your bedroom
Before I fell asleep
I still feel the moment
When you came alive
Like a poem about springtime
Nothing to hide

All of these homes
Are lined up so straight
But here on the inside
It's not that way

I gave you my life and more
From sadness to sunshine
I'm yours, I'm your lost happiness
Up in your Los Angeles sky

Lately I've been thinking
That you'll never know
If you don't mark the way back
The further you go
Lately I've been feeling
Like I'm the bright star
That fell behind the mountain of feeling you are
