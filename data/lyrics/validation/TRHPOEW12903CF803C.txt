If you're going into the city
Can I follow behind
And if you think it's all so pretty
I might just lose my mind

'Cause it's been raining all the time
Yeah, it's been raining all the time
And I might not know how to find
My way back home

And if you're feeling sorta' weary
Let me change your troubled mind
And if you need me to be crazy
I'll only have to be kind

'Cause it's been raining all the time
And it's been raining all the time
And I might not know how to find
My way back home

And it's one tear tonight
One tomorrow
And you leave me tonight
You're back tomorrow

If you're going into the city
Can I follow behind
And if you're leaving in the morning
Can you take my worried mind

'Cause it's been raining all the time
And it's been raining all the time
And I might not know how to find
My way back home

It's been raining all the time
It's been raining all the time
And I might not know how to find
My way back home
