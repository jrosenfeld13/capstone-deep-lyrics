Muffled snaps and louder cracks
Sound of blows knocks you down
Flesh recoils and starts to swell
Hear the rushing of the blood

Carve the rage into you
I've absorbed the pain
It comes so easy
From my arm to your face

Big enough to speak again
Finds a place that's not been numbed
Sinks with lightness once again
Feel the blankness from above

Carve the rage into you
I've absorbed the pain
It comes so easy
From my arm to your face

Carve the rage into you
I've absorbed the pain
It comes so easy
From my arm to your face

Carve the rage into you
I've absorbed the pain
It comes so easy
From my arm to your face
