Working class hero, working class zero
Tell me who's the real weirdo
Outside your living room door
The neighbors dying on the floor
Did you get what you've been looking for?
Did you find what's behind the door?
Ls this what you've been hoping for?
Did you settle for nothin' more?

Mass confusion, packed in like cigarettes
Smoke filled rooms, sucking in my breath

Rooms of victims, numb from crisis
Sing a litany of woe and mistakes
Forget what they say, they lie to your face
The scenery changes, but it's the same old place
Everyone's always lookin'. for satisfaction
For me it's the worst that can happen
As cut-rate solutions continue to spread
Twisted kicks will play with your head

We are the apocalypse
We are here lo wipe the slate clean
We are the bridge between the old and new
We are the door that you must get through
(They are obviously afraid of us
We are the dangerous
No one knows what became of us
We are the dangerous) x4

All the lost lonely hearts are done in flames
They took the dead and left the lame
All stand waiting for the end
While torrents rise. in fountains of red
Waste time preaching to bones In the valley
While confessing who may be the enemy
Isn't it dangerous to walk around like this?
Might look over the edge fall Into the abyss
We are the dangerous (repeat)
