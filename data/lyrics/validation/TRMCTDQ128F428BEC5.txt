Last night, I dreamed I was a kid again
All the things I used to do, I went and did again
Spent the afternoon with my best and closest friend
Wandering through the days we thought would never end

It was back when I'd still get things from Santa Claus
Back when he believed in me and overlooked the flaws
That can grow inside until it hides
The perfect little boy inside the man

I'm not a kid anymore, but I still believe
That those miracles occur
That's not something up his sleeve
And that the reindeer pull the sleigh
And the elves still make the toys
Santa gives away to all the girls and boys

Tonight, I'll climb back in that bed again
Try to live out all my dreams inside my head again
After Christmas Eve, with my best and closest friend
Who still believes the world's greatest dad just tucked him in

And I know that he'll be looking out for Santa Claus
And I'm sure beyond a doubt he'll overlook the flaws
That will grow inside until it hides
This perfect little boy inside a man

I'm not a kid anymore and I still believe
That those miracles occur
That's not something up his sleeve
And that the reindeer pull the sleigh
And the elves do make the toys
Santa gives away to all the girls and boys
