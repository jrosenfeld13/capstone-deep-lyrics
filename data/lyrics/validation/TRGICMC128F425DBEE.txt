Kingston, Kingston, Kingston

[Chorus]
I see them coming from afar
I got my eyes open I'm ready for war
When I fight mon' they know who we are
A Kingston mi come from, a Kingston mi come through
I see them coming from afar
Dem diss Sean Kingston dem gonna get a scar
When I fight mon' they know who we are
A Kingston mi come from, a Kingston mi come through

My mom is my hero
Two three nine zero
The doctor was lookin' at a star
From then I've been strictly on a mission
I got twenty-twenty vision
All the haters I can spot them from far
I'm sure
Jamacains on slash date
Probably representin' and bringing it home
After I sing my songs
I duck trouble but it keep on lurkin'
Things going to well the devil start workin

I see them coming from afar
I got my eyes open tough luck for ya'll
Crush, Crush the wall
I'm still a young boy that drive all the grown folks right up the wall

I'm aware of the snakes cause they near
They plottin' to get me
I'm watching my peers
Bout time in a million
It's close man i swear
I feel it in the air and i'm order for them

[Chorus]
I see them coming from afar
I got my eyes open I'm ready for war
When I fight mon' they know who we are
A Kingston mi come from, a Kingston mi come through
I see them coming from afar
Dem diss Sean Kingston dem gonna get a scar
When I fight mon' they know who we are
A Kingston mi come from, a Kingston mi come through

I'm what it is i'm Macdola hype with a game to back
Spitting a big ticket number one in the track
Ease along, baby say ease the bar
My b's the door
Bout to take the game by storm

The one and only
Haters got nothing on me
I can feel the vibe
I see it in their eyes
They praying for my demise
They don't want to see me blow yo
Rather see me low low
Or I be on the floor yo
But no yo
I'm pull through this game of tug o' war
What you fellas fussing for
Maybe cause i'm grubbing more
None the less, i'm paying my dues
Don't hate me
A little hard work will get you here too

I got next, better yet i got now
Everybody got faith and yelling cause my hot style
86 the bullshit they don't want me hostile
I'ma reign supreme until the day i drop down

[Chorus]
I see them coming from afar
I got my eyes open I'm ready for war
When I fight mon' they know who we are
A Kingston mi come from, a Kingston mi come through
I see them coming from afar
Dem diss Sean Kingston dem gonna get a scar
When I fight mon' they know who we are
A Kingston mi come from, a Kingston mi come through

Dem a run off dem mouth and dem a run off dem beak
And dem a talk 'pon the block and dem a talk 'pon the streets
But dem don't wan' war with we
'Cause we bus it and we pop it off, bus it and we pop it off

Dem a run off dem mouth and dem a run off dem beak
And dem a talk 'pon the block and dem a talk 'pon the streets
But dem don't wan' war with we
'Cause we bus it and we pop it off, bus it and we pop it off

[Chorus]
I see them coming from afar
I got my eyes open I'm ready for war
When I fight mon' they know who we are
A Kingston mi come from, a Kingston mi come through
I see them coming from afar
Dem diss Sean Kingston dem gonna get a scar (Kingston)
Man a badman, they know who we are
A Kingston mi come from, a Kingston mi come through
