Hey, Mike, I wish I could help you figure something out
But it's been too long since we spoke
Your sarcasm radiates unhappiness
So withdrawn and rooted deep inside

Are you content at 27?
Were you hopeful at 17?
A void the size of oceans stretches out between us
I guess our blood is supposed to be a bridge

Can you pull yourself up
From this self hatred?
Can you pull yourself up?
Frustration's driven you to angry dreams

Let Nebraska disappear in golden flames of grain
I know you can't imagine having company right now
There's a world of tired faces who understand this pain
There's a better life waiting on the outside

Of these decaying walls
Of these decaying walls

Your bitterness doesn't surprise me
As these pointless days go streaming by
Rejected, sour eyes can't imagine blue skies
Rejected, sour eyes can't imagine blue skies

I wish you could find something to live for
Besides the agony of bleeding towards this last breath
I truly believe that you want more than this
This is killing you, I truly believe that you want more than this

What you want is very simple
But somehow so complex to get
What you want is very simple
But somehow so complex to get

Please don't hate yourself
Please don't hate yourself
Please don't hate yourself

Please don't hate yourself
Please don't hate yourself
Please don't hate yourself

I truly believe that you want more than this
