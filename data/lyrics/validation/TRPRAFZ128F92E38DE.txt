"Well pull a single thread from my arm and watch me fold like a bathrobe"
Is what he said to you tonight
Well you did it to him, didn't you, my god
"Well pull a single thread from my arm and watch me fold like a bathrobe"
Is what he said to you tonight
Well you did it to him, didn't you, my god
Like a cat with an insect, you are
So what can I say

You see these harbour towns
Slowly reveal themseves
The darkest of society
The darkest of company
The darkest of company...
Reveal themselves

Weight splintering coastline away
Just some sparkling shore but no weight
Oh there's something I remember, yes now wait
Oh there's something I recall
Oh her heart was black and her eyes were blue

So thread your fingers through my hair
And whisper to me your ideas
I balk at the mention round here
Bigotry's obligatory around here
There's nothing for me to defend
She's gone too good

You see these harbour towns
Slowly reveal themseves
The darkest of society
The darkest of company
The darkest of company
Reveal themselves

Weight splintering coastline away
Some sparkling shore but no weight
Oh there's something I remember, yes now wait
Oh there's something I recall
That her heart was black but her eyes were blue
