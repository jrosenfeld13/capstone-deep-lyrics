May I lead you away to a silver day passing
All your thought are there
May I drown your belief in a blue water chasm
You can taste the air

[Chorus]
Memories grow like scarlet poppies
On a silver quilted shore
Melting in the moment you adore

Through the filtered remains
Of a picture show past life
Chosen moments play
Through a rose colored lens
That you look with your eyes closed
You recount your days

Leave the golden threads bare
Leave the past born and naked -
Pulsing like the moon
Not the ghost of day
But just one chosen moment
Screaming through the room
