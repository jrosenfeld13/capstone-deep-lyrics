You say that time will tell
Everyday keeps getting harder
I know that I've been gone so long

Who'd believe I was missing you
Everything is getting to me
These lonely nights go on and on

Days are getting longer
Miles and miles between us
This feeling's getting stronger
Please believe me when I say no way

Long distance love, it ain't for me
This can't go on, oh, can't you see
We've been holding on too long

Long distance torture on the line
Far too much talking all the time
Let it go, our time is gone

Fighting, crying, almost dying
That's enough for me
Time for living, no more giving
Time to set me free

Long distance love, it ain't for me
This can't go on, oh, can't you see
We've been holding on too long

Long distance torture on the line
Far too much talking all the t
Let it go

Days are getting longer
Miles and miles between us
This feeling's getting stronger
Please believe me when I say no way

Long distance love, it ain't for me
This can't go on, oh, can't you see
We've been holding on too long

Long distance torture on the line
Far too much talking all the time
Let it go, our time is gone

Long distance love, it ain't for me
This can't go on, oh, can't you see
We've been holding on too long
