Yellow skies, I can see you in yellow skies
See you again, I see you again
In my dreams, in my dreams
In my dreams, in my dreams

Morning light, I remember morning light
Outside my door, I'll see you no more
In my dreams, in my dreams
In my dreams, in my dreams

Forever, forever, I'll be forever holding you
Forever, forever, I'll be forever holding you
Responsible, responsible, responsible, responsible

Black and white
It's become so black and white
So insecure, you're so insecure
That's what you are, That's what you are
That's what you are, That's what you are

Forever, forever, I'll be forever holding you
Forever, forever, I'll be forever holding you
Responsible, responsible, responsible, responsible

Forever, forever, I'll be forever holding you
Forever, forever, I'll be forever holding you
Responsible, responsible, responsible, responsible
