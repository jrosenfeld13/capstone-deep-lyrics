[Verse 1]
With that we got it
We're undefeated
Give me a long kiss
Like you mean it

[Verse 2]
A little bloodshed
But it was worth it
We made a promise
After this we'd quit

[Verse 3]
Turn on the motor
Keep off the headlights
To the cabin
In the cover of night

[Verse 4]
Slow down
Wheels on the gravel
Use the key
Hidden in the panel

[Verse 5]
Wood stove
Like a warm heart
Wall shadows
This is the best part

[Verse 6]
Put it in the chest
Under the trapdoor
Unroll the carpet
Across the cold floor

[Verse 7]
Like we planned it
When the clock chimes
Turn around once
And tap three times

[Hook]
Remember it'll all blow over
We'll meet again when the temperature is lower
If we don't turn each other in, dear
We'll be fine
Time to disappear

[Verse 1]

[Verse 2]

We made a promise
After this we'd quit

[Hook]

Time to disappear
Time to disappear
We disappear

[Hook]
