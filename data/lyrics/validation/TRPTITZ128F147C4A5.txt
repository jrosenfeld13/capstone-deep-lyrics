(Olson) Gunflint Music BMI

He's only six years old, that old killer died
Put him down in a great big hole, I fill it up all the time
See the buildings rise up to the sky, parking meters, traffic cops
You'd best watch your record son, they'll come and lock you up

Chorus:
I been working all night
I go long into the day
You got much money now
Got the time ahead, you got the time ahead to pay

Smoke and lightning, dressed to kill
Don't talk to strangers, girl take your pill
Forty years of sudden death, the acid rain is falling on my head
Bush raids (abortion rates?) on the rise, doctors working overtime
Too much of a good thing not enough, stepping stones, building blocks

(Chorus)

(Chorus)
Cause, I been working all night
I go along into the day
You got much money
Got the time ahead, you got the time ahead to pay
