Twilight For All Mankind

Faces in turmoil
Going though hard times
Global warming
Is changing everybody's lives
This climate chaos
Is the Beginning of the end
It's a bitter lesson
We all have to understand
Feel the deadly heat waves
And the force of hurricanes
Droughts and mega floods
Make the earth a piece of mud
Fire is burning high
Crops are getting dry
Isn't that enough?
A point of no return

Twilight for all mankind

Ambitious leaders
In an endless decay

Fuck the planet
Filling people with dismay
Here we come again
To a sad farewell
We're too tired
To stand another painful hell
Mass migration and civil war
No resources anymore
Hungry countries in decline
Making people cross the line
Famine and diseases
Put us on our knees
The future of mankind
Rests inside our minds

Twilight for all mankind

Fire is burning again
Water is causing pain
Air is hard to breath
Insane

Droughts split the land
Fast floods expand
Leading to the end
The end

This climate chaos
Is the Beginning of the end
It's a bitter lesson
We all have to understand
Feel the deadly heat waves
And the force of hurricanes
Droughts and mega floods
Make the earth a piece of mud
Fire is burning high
Crops are getting dry
Isn't that enough?
A point of no return

Twilight for all mankind
