Things I say and do may not come clear through
My words may not convey just what I'm feelin'
But I hope you'll recognize what's right before your eyes
Oh, your heart should realize
From where I'm dealin'

Baby I'm tryin' to show you that I love you
Baby I'm tryin' to show you that I care
Baby I'm tryin' to tell you that i, i need you
Baby, I'm tryin' to tell you that I care

Oh, you may not understand just why I show my hand
The method to my madness you inspire
Perception is the key
It's evident you see
What this is all about
Is love entire

And all I know is true
Is this love I have for you
And all I know is true
Is this love I have for you
