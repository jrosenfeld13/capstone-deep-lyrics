You
You need a love like mine that you can depend on
When your whole world's falling in
And you need a friend
You can depend on me

Oh, I'll be by your side
When you need me
When the whole world seems unfair
And no one seems to care
You can depend on me

Oh when life seems not worth living
And nothing seems to be going right
Comfort my love will be giving

Will change your darkness to light
I'll be right by your side
When you need, need me
When the whole world seems unfair
And no one seems to care
You can depend on me

Oh, don't you know that I'll be right by your side
Oh, little girl, little girl, little girl
When you need a friend
I'm yours 'til the end
Oh, yeah, I love you. I love you
