Past beliefs and beyond myself
Where I am king of my inner flesh
Get off on the angel saint
Get off to reject the pain

I crawl where there never will be light
I crawl where the poison makes me go insane
I'll crawl till the day I die

I'm falling!
I'm falling down where ruins serve as shelter
A state of mind achieved through shots sent from heaven
Seductive venom
Inject the blood
Scars only heal, they never go away forever

Broken down by I'll resurrect
With fire flowing through my dried out veins
Always being left behind
Always fighting in the blind

I crawl where there never will be light
I crawl where the poison makes me go insane
I'll crawl till the day I die

I'm falling!
I'm falling down where ruins serve as shelter
A state of mind achieved through shots sent from heaven
Seductive venom
Inject the blood
Scars only heal, they never go away forever

Trapped in a world half way to death
In an empty void worse than hell
Battered!
Shattered!
No, nothing will be the same again
Inject to stay alive

Past beliefs and beyond myself
Where I am king of my inner flesh
Get off on the angel saint
Get off to reject the pain

I crawl where there never will be light
I crawl where the poison makes me go insane
I'll crawl till the day I die

I'm falling!
I'm falling down where ruins serve as shelter
A state of mind achieved through shots sent from heaven
Seductive venom
Inject the blood
Scars only heal, they never go away forever
