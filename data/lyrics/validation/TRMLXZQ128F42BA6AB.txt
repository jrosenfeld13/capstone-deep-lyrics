Here you go, you really wanna make it
There you go, i know you can't take it
I don't know, but i don't think you'll pass the test
You'll be a castaway, yes you are
Slipping away and no you're not
Number one
One by one
NOW!

If we can take it this outside
It's just a walk
Run and hide
One by one
You idiots i'll take you one by one

If i can make you turn around
I will bury you underground
One by one
You idiots i'll take you one by one

You have never felt this bad, now can you take it?
Take this one to your heart, and if you make it
I don't know but i don't think you were the best
I think you're fakin in vain and now you are
Screamin in pain and no you're not
Number one
One by one

I had no intentions after all
But i will smile when you rise and fall
One by one
