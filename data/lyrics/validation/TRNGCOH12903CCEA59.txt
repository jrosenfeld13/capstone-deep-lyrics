Things start moving that never did before
The blue and purple dragones have me rolling on the floor
I look the other way and I see a cat-fight
But I don't mind cos I'll be flying for the rest of the night

(Chorus:)
Things start moving but tell me what happens
When everything around me starts laughing
Things start moving that never will again
But now I need to know where last night was spent

Things start moving and they never will again
The windowpanes open and close, my head's in a spin
Red and blue flashes from cars black and white
Point guns at the rocket for speeding 85

(Chorus)
Things start disappearing and to rearrange
Mickey Mouse with his wizards's wand and another change
Trolley car makes a turn and now we're lost
Foot by foot, another great trip, never want to stop
