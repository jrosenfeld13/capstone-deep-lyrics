[Verse 1]
She's addicted
If the divine master's plan
She's addicted
She's addicted
She's addicted
She's addicted
She's addicted
She's addicted
She's addicted
She's addicted
She's addict
She's addict
She's addict
She's addict

[Pre-Chorus]
She's addicted
She's afraid
Here
Here

[Chorus 1]
T'nod uoy tub, niaga dna niaga
T'nod uoy tub, niaga dna niaga
Don't
T'nod uoy tub
T'nod uoy tub, niaga dna niaga
Don't
T'nod uoy tub ,niaga dna niaga
Mean it

[Verse 2]
She's addicted
She's addicted
She's addicted
She's addicted
She's addicted
If the divine master's plan
She's addicted
She's addicted
If the divine master's plan is perfection
Maybe next I'll give Judas a try
Trusting my soul to the ice cream assassin
Here, here, here

[Chorus 2]
T'nod uoy tub, niaga dna niaga ti tnaw t'nod
T'nod uoy tub, niaga dna niaga ti tnaw t'nod
T'nod uoy tub, niaga dna niaga ti tnaw t'nod
T'nod uoy tub, niaga dna niaga ti tnaw t'nod
Don't
Don't

[Post-Chorus]
Don't, don't really mean it
You don't
Don't, don't really mean it
You
Don't, don't really mean it
You don't

[Verse 3]
She's addicted
She's addicted
She's addicted
She's addicted
She's addicted
She's addicted
She's addicted
She's addicted to nic...

[Outro]
She's addicted to nicotine patches
She's afraid of the light in the dark
6:58 are you sure where my spark is?
Here, here, here
