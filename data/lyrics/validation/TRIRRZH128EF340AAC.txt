My loins say just one thing to me but my brain
My brain says another thing to me but my loins
I deserve to be drop-kicked
I deserve to be back drop-kicked
Drop-kicked by my God but He won't
My name is cut and then you dry
Don't even try me
They call me slip and then you slide
You gotta find me
I'm gonna be your wildman
I got things in mind
Do you mind if I plan my wedding?
It's gonna be grand
