[Verse 1: Luni Coleone]
Ugh
They call me Luni Coleone, down to dump on a snitch
Fuck em all, nigga, this West Coast, bitch
Down with I.M.G, nigga, so I'm gang related
Spittin' hardcore shit, fool, I can't see faded
I'm a Sacramento psycho (psycho)
Gone of the nitro (off the nitro)
Smash on a bitch, then hit the ass when the lights go
Rollin' down Florin Road, perved off yak
I do dirt then, ski-skirt when I bust my caps
I bet a nigga lay down when his shit get hit
Got his body smellin' worse than some week old piss
Its I, Coleone, wrappin' it up like egg rolls
Keep your bitch jockin' on some 20's of Dayo
On the go, making my louchi up off the yayo
Niggas never knew Shotgun would spit with Skandal
But its real shit, we been folks since high school
Doggin' bitches, ditching class, and passing the dank fool

[Hook X2: Luni Coleone]
Who wanna fuck with some of this thug shit
We got game to make your main bitch love dick
To all my enemies, when killing me, nigga, bump this
I'll have my niggas on your ass like some draws, trick
Thug shit

[Verse 2: Luni Coleone]
Ugh
We spit that thug shit, everything is on a bitch
Hardcore livin', ghetto fabulous, on some real shit
Poppin' my collar, we getting sideways
Bangin' gears, big car pullin' up on the highway
We kill 'em up, mash on niggas like take a bone
I hit 'em up with the chopper, once again its on
Now thug niggas raise them thangs up (thangs up)
And bust a cap up in the air if you dont give a fuck (give a fuck)
Grab your bitch by the neck and yell out slut (slut)
And tell your partna with his bitch ass, he better duck
Thug living mafioso, doing big things up off the heezi
Like your breezi at the mo cheezi with a dick up in her kizi, thru
I thought you knew, Coleone make the shit crack
Like beer cans off my boots when I'm tore back
Thug livin', death or prison is our motto
Thug shit, Coleone spitting hard with Skandal

[Hook X2: Luni Coleone]
Who wanna fuck with some of this thug shit
We got game to make your main bitch love dick
To all my enemies, when killing me, nigga, bump this
I'll have my niggas on your ass like some draws, trick
Thug shit

[Verse 3: Skanless]
Skandal be the realla, the nigga the big figga
Hustle hard, go get her, tell that bitch I wanna meet her
Player till I die, but killa when I ride
Strapped, armed, and daily its a struggle to survive
So I keep my mind on my paper and my head on straight
You could ask my folks
Who the Coleone, fool, It's been that way
Since high school, been the same fool
With the same tool, with the same rule
Every bitch nigga must lose
Cause I've paid dues and got my ranks from bringing bad news
To hoe ass niggas that be acting just like you
You brand new, like young niggas smoking boo boo
I'm old school, like real niggas smoking green jewels
Bringing the pain, none of that to no gain
Its like the mutherfucking sun without no goddamn rain
Skandal, fuck the whole world, high as a kite
Ask my peep Shotgun, I bet we ride tonite
Come on

[Hook X2: Luni Coleone]
Who wanna fuck with some of this thug shit
We got game to make your main bitch love dick
To all my enemies, when killing me, nigga, bump this
I'll have my niggas on your ass like some draws, trick
Thug shit
