[Chorus]
Belsen was a gas I heard the other day
In the open graves where the jews all lay
Life is fun and I wish you were here
They wrote on postcards to those held dear
Oh dear

[Verse]
Sergeant major's on the march
Wash their bodies in the starch
See them all die one by one
Guess it's dead, guess it's glad

[Chorus]
Belsen was a gas I heard the other day
In the open graves where the jews all lay
Life is fun and I wish you were here
They wrote on postcards to those held dear
Oh dear

[Outro]
Be a man, Be a man
Belsen was a gas
Be a man, kill someone
Kill yourself, be a man
Be someone, kill someone
Be a man, kill yourself
