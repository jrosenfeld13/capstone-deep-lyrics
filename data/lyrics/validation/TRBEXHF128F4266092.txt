Thrillseeker, heartbreaker
Shapeshifter, secret keeper
You know I love to see ya
All the time shakin' down
Movin' with the sound
You know we like to turn it up loud

Price is right (x5)

Rhyme, we steppin' up and dance oh
Move on up and get yours
You know, right on up and they go

We say, "Go move your body baby"
All right, we're movin' up and inside
And get to ride, move your body baby
This place is live movin' with the ride

Thrillseeker, heartbreaker
Shapeshifter, secret keeper
I love to see ya
Movin' it on
Shake your body down yeah
I'm moving with the sound

With the ride we're moving up and inside
I'm feeling high upon life
I'm feeling good tonight
And there's strange vibe
Don't know what it is
Let's check inside
Open it, space is too tight

Hey you know, somebody say hello
You know it's time to go say flow so
A different kind of style you never know
Never right, we're so slick we slip and slide

We say, "Go move your body baby"
All right, we're movin' up and inside
And get to ride, move your body baby
This place is live movin' with the ride

We say, "Go move your body baby"
All right, we're movin' up and inside
And get to ride, move your body baby
This place is live movin' with the ride

Thrillseeker, heartbreaker
Shapeshifter, secret keeper
You know I love to see ya
Make it tight, slip and slide
With the right so this is how we flow hard

We say, "Go move your body baby"
All right, we're movin' up and inside
And get to ride, move your body baby
This place is live movin' with the ride

We say, "Go move your body baby"
All right, we're movin' up and inside
And get to ride, move your body baby
This place is live movin' with the ride
