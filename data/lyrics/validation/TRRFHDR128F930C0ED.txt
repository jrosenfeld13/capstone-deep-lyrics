Where do we go from here?
Where is our home, what's our destiny?
When do we learn to see?
When do we learn to understand?

Give me a reason to believe!
Is this a tale I should believe?
This is a tale of mystery
Is this the tale I should believe?

Dimensions, Dimensions
Castaway eternally
Dimensions, Dimensions
Hear the call and follow us to heaven

What do we find out there?
Is it heaven, is it hell?
Where will our journey end?
Beyond the gates of space and time?

Is this a story made of dreams?
Is this a tale I should believe?
Is this all real or fantasy?
Is this a tale I should believe?

Dimensions, Dimensions
Castaway eternally
Dimensions, Dimensions
Hear the call and follow us to heaven

Dimensions, Dimensions
Castaway eternally
Dimensions, Dimensions
Fear the call, don't follow us
Cos heaven is hell
