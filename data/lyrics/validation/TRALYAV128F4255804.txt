[Intro]
Pretty, if the sun won't shine
I'll be coming out to meet you
I'll be there to make you mine
And pretty, if the rain will pour
I'll be knocking at your window
I'll be begging you for more

[Verse 1]
It's as if you've come along too soon
And I'm trying to fit you in
But I can't seem to find the room
And cutie, if it all falls through
We can piece it back together
I can learn to trust you too

[Chorus]
You're just, you're too good to lose
And I can't refuse
So don't make me choose
Between the two
And burn up in here
In my atmosphere
Don't you know who you are?
You're my shooting star

[Verse 2]
Pretty, teach me wrong from right
'Cause in love there are no answers
And in life there is no light
Pretty, if the sun won't shine
Now you've come this far to meet me
And I know, I know you're mine

[Chorus]
You're just, you're too good to lose
And I can't refuse
So don't make me choose
Between the two
And burn up in here
In my atmosphere
Don't you know who you are?
You're my shooting star

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Outro]
Don't you know who you are?
You're my shooting star
