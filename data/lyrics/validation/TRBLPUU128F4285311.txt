Right string, baby
But the wrong yo-yo
Somebody knockin' on yo' do'
I passed this mo'nin' by the hardware sto'
I bought a brand new string
To fit in my yo-yo

Went on down to the doctor
To get this string put on
He turned around
And put the string on wrong
No need a-knockin' on nobody's do'
You got the right string, baby
But the wrong yo-yo

Mama tol' me, papa did, too
'Some-a these here women
Gonna be the death of you'
'Better find out which 'un you crave, son
Some a-these here women'll
Take you to yo grave'!

See me comin', baby
Put yo' man outdo's
I ain't no stranger
I been here, befo'

No need a-knockin' on nobody's do'
The right string, baby but the wrong yo-yo

The right string but the wrong yo-yo
Somebody's knockin' on the do'
Pass this mo'nin by the hardware sto'
Brand new string to fit in my yo-yo

Went to the doctor
To get this string put on
He made a mistake
An put it on wrong

No need a-knockin' on nobody's do'
You got the right string, baby but the wrong yo-yo
