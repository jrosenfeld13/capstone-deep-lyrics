[Intro: Fredro Starr]
Just to let you know this is recorded 9/11/2001
The day the World Trade Center blows up
Shit is real, son. Shit hit home, kid, word up
Uh, yeah, hope you can feel this

[Chorus]
Hope you can feel me
So much pain inside
Hope you can hear me
Im cryin through my heart

[Verse 1: Fredro Starr]
When I first heard the track it made me cry
Brought tears to my eyes and I dont even knowwhy
My life aint nothing but anger and pain
Tatoos on the back of my arm should explain
Blood, sweat and tears, ten years in the game
So many times all alone with the gat to mybrain
Its Me Against the World nigga, I feel the same nigga
Im Ready to Die too BIG, I feel the same
Im Americas nightmare  young, black and rich
Man, Im paranoid, make me wanna clap mybitch
A hundred miles an hour, wanna rap mywhip
Asking God Shit, where we going afterthis?
Ima thug, a thug til heart be stop
Til they pick me off the street nigga, murdered ashot
My wars, my words, the only thing that Igot
And I live by the gun and I die by the Glock
Sixteen shots, fuck that Im takin them all
Id rather die on my feet then live and crawl
My gun got powers like the 48Lords
The Ghetto Superstar die see my face on the wall
And dont forget me

[Chorus]
Hope you can feel me
So much pain inside
Hope you can hear me
Im cryin through my heart

[Verse 2: Sonsee]
Growin up in Brooklyn, times was rough cuz
Poor as we was it couldnt get no tougher
On my ave. most of us was not blood
But as kids we shared that block love
But that faded, when my brothers got arrested
They thugged on the block to hard, we was ejected
To the creator: was it you that made moms pick Queens?
So her baby son could race the world, when he created things?
Why her elders always heard the sounds of sirens?
Plus they ignored the divine guidance
Why was the time I was born 9/16?
Turn it upside down its the same thing
Why do I have a M-16, and the 9?
Will I have to go out, blazing one at a time?
When you took moms baby carriage, in the early stage
Was he too ill for this world, and you made amistake?
Did he come back as me, to do something great?
To keep the fam strong and straight, help my brothers escape?
And have baby sis and us, living on an estate
Do it big or die tryin, is that my fate?

[Chorus]
Hope you can feel me
So much pain inside
Hope you can hear me
Im cryin through my heart

[Verse 3: Sticky Fingaz]
Who really cares, what the world think aboutme?
If I die right now, is you comin with me?
When Im broke, who the hell got money forme?
Cant even trust half the team runnin withme
I only know three people thatd kill for me
Break the 6th commandment, make blood spill forme
Life and death the only thing thats real forme
Cuz I was born into the world with aguilty plea
Now shit hit the fan, is you ridin withme?
When the whole world watchin, All Eyez onMe
Swear on a stack of Bibles, testify forme
Look the judge dead in the face and lie forme
If I go to prison, who gon do my time forme?
Start the revolution, get the chair, fry withme
Go out in a blaze of glory, guns to the sky withme
Im all alone in this world, all I got is me

[Chorus]
Hope you can feel me
So much pain inside
Hope you can hear me
Im cryin through my heart
Hope you can feel me
So much pain inside
Hope you can hear me
Im cryin through my heart
Hope you can feel me
So much pain inside
Hope you can hear me
Im cryin through my heart
