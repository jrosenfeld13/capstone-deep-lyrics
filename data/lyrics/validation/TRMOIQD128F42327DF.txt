[Hook]
In a room all alone waiting by the telephone
With a tear in his eye and a pen in his hand
So begins the diary of a working man

[Verse 1]
He'd been a poor man all his life
And just when things were going right
Some stranger takes his woman away
He doesn't know if he'll see, oh, another day, oh, another day

[Verse 2]
Time has come and he was right
It was a cold and rainy night
And he thought for sure she would follow
But it won't be the same, no tomorrow

[Verse 3]
Now here's a man glory bound
In a pool of dreams about to drown
If he can just get through this night
Then maybe tomorrow things will work out right, oh, will work out right

[Verse 4]
Well, with the pain in his blood
He'd love to take her if he could
And as he wakes with a scream
To only realize it's just reality, oh

[Outro]
He woke with sweaty hands
Maybe there'll be a change in plans
With a tear in his eye and a gun in his hand
So ends the diary of a workingman
