I wish you would stake the claim
Turned too far for your will
And I feel I failed your will
And you come later
And the healer
Makes better and better and better

Le vainqueur
And it's better
Le vainqueur

I'm coming around
To take all your messages down
And I feel I failed your will
And you come later
A healer
And better and better

Le vainqueur
And better
Le vainqueur
