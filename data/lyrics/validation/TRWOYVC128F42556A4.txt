[Intro]
Oh, how about a round of applause?
Yeah, a standing ovation
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
You look so dumb right now
Standing outside my house
Trying to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry
Please, just cut it out

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not
Baby, when I know you're only sorry you got caught

[Chorus]
But you put on quite a show
Really had me going
But now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now (but it's over now)
Go on and take a bow

[Verse 2]
Grab your clothes and get gone (get gone)
You better hurry up
Before the sprinklers come on (come on)
Talking' bout' "Girl, I love you, you're the one"
This just looks like a re-run
Please, what else is on? (on)

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not
Baby, when I know you're only sorry you got caught

[Chorus]
But you put on quite a show
Really had me going
But now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now (but it's over now)
Go on and take a bow

[Bridge]
Oh, and the award for the best liar goes to you (goes to you)
For making me believe
That you could be faithful to me
Let's hear your speech, oh
How 'bout a round of applause?
A standing ovation

[Chorus]
But you put on quite a show
Really had me going
Now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now (but it's over now)
Go on and take a bow
But it's over now
