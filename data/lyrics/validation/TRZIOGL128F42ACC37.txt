Music: Kie von Hertzen
Words: Mikko von Hertzen

Hush hush
High above us
Up in the sky
Behind the fuss
A lullaby of stars

There's so much
Waiting for us
And it's grace
Is in a touch
So beautiful and soft

Nature takes a moment
Only to imbibe the melodies
Descending on her trees
Such a lovely moment
Only to remind that there is peace
High above the evergreens

Hush hush
High above us
A lullaby of stars
