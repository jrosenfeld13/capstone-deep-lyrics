[Verse 1: the MarXman]
Hickory Dickory
Doppler Hailey, copped on the radar is
A spot.  (Where?)  Wait, r-right there (Are you sure)
(That it wasnt there before?)  Am I sure?  Im quite clear
(Oh dear).  I fear he can be viewed up in the rear of the
Right mirror, which just seems close.  (Its red or appears so clear)
(With deep strokes).  Magnified.  (Is that him?)  Yeah.  (Long)
(Locks and Converse, conversing with the concrete).  Yeah, yeah, con... mmm, yeah, and
Constant converse.  (Really?)  Really, this
Nerd has one-liners.  If Im Kirk, I swerve right over
Nerves like drunk drivers.  (Well, then, why is his file)
(Not in the archives?)  He was deleted, his existence can
Cost us our lives.  (You betrayed him, didnt you?)
There was nothing left to do.  (Leaving our most effective operative)
(With nothing left to lose?!?)  What?!?  C-
-Cause he knows the truth.  (Well, according to the bloop-bloop)
Hes coming for the booth.  (Oops, whoever he)
(Is gunning for, duck!)  Who the fuck do you think he is
Coming for?  (Us.  Damn)
(What if you and I miss him?)  Computer, record this as
A suicide mission.  (Damn).  X, I guess
This is your destiny.  From a young boy, I know
Youd be the death of me.  Infiltrate, pursue him.  (And then)
(He fought right through em, shouting something about his training in)
(The danger room).  Aaah, we are ruined!
