Primrose Lane, life's a holiday on Primrose Lane
Just a holiday on Primrose Lane with you

Can't explain when we're walkin' down the Primrose Lane
Even roses bloomin' in the rain with you

Sweet perfume
Those little old roses bloom
And I want to walk with you my whole life through

Primrose Lane, life's a holiday on Primrose Lane
Just a holiday on Primrose Lane with you

Sweet perfume
Those little old roses bloom
And I want to walk with you my whole life through

Primrose Lane, life's a holiday on Primrose Lane
Just a holiday on Primrose Lane with you

Wi-i-i-th you
Wi-i-i-th you
Fade
Wi-i-i-th you
