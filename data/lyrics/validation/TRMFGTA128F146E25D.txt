Girls
You've been in love too long
(You're a fool for your baby)
Don't you know, girls
You've been in love too long
(You're a fool for your baby)

When just his smile
Takes all your pain away
And you find yourself believing
Whatever he may say

Now when he keeps you crying
But your heart tells you
Girl, keep right on trying

Girls
You've been in love too long
(You're a fool for your baby)
Don't you know, girls
You've been in love too long
(You're a fool for your baby)

When you accept his wrongs
Just to share his kiss
And even your lonely nights
Are filled with happiness

Now girl, you're in trouble
You know your heart
Is seeing double

When your head tells you to run
But your heart says
He's the only one

Girls
You've been in love too long
(You're a fool for your baby)

(Girl, you've been
In love too long)
Poor fool

Cause when a week
Of loneliness can be erased
Eith just one sweet caress

Girls
You've been in love too long
(You're a fool for your baby)
I said girls, oh, yeah
Poor fool

When his wrongs look right
Though he always treats you bad
When you find little excuses
For all the sadness and abuses

Don't you know, girls
You're in love, oh, no
You're just a fool for your baby
(You're a fool for your baby)

Girls
You've been in love
Too long, poor fool
(You're a fool for your baby)
