Million eyes and million souls
Never seen beyond the zone
As Charon proclaim the law
Winds come front, reveal the ones who gone

Transform all suffering into plagues

The slaves never seen beyond
Forever locked behind the rusty door
Naked suffer but they never die
In chains polluted, bless they alive

Wild annihilating riders
Made in bowels of the earth
Defend the chariot arise in tartar
On winged horses they attack

Transform all suffering into plagues

Transform all suffering into plagues
Mayhemic curses once predicted
Worthless humans beg their death
Eternal suffer miserables

The curse of Nath
The curse of Iostha

Walk through sensual rivers
An energy weakening sensations
Certainly infect the hypnotized target
Never stop to suffer
Miserables

Million eyes and million souls
Never seen beyond the zone
As Charon proclaim the law
Winds come front, reveal the ones who gone

Transform all suffering into plagues
