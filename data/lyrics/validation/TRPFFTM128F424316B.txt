[Chorus 1]
Don't fall in love with me, baby
It's a love that just won't last
Your eyes are lookin' out at the future
But you see the past
You know love was made for a dreamer
But when the dream is out of sight
Well, all you're gonna get in the morning is a lonely night

Gonna be a lonely night, nothing but a lonely night

[Verse]
Saving it all for something wild and wonderful
Holding it down
There's gotta be another horizon
Keep it inside
Don't throw away your precious love
'Cause if you need to be free, you can take it
Not a prison of love that you make it

[Chorus 2]
Don't fall in love with me, baby
It's a love that just can't last
Your eyes are looking out at the future
But you see the past
You know hearts were made to be broken
And your love has broken mine
Now all your gonna get in the morning is a lonely night

Gonna be a lonely night, nothing but a lonely night
Gonna be a lonely night
You gonna be blue... (don't fall... don't fall)

Gonna be a lonely night, nothing but a lonely night
Gonna be a lonely night

[Verse]
Saving it all for something wild and wonderful
Holding it down
There's gotta be another horizon
Keep it inside
Don't throw away your precious love
'Cause if you need to be free, you can take it
Not a prison of love that you make it

[Chorus 3]
Don't fall in love with me, baby
It's a love that just can't last
Your eyes are looking out at the future
But you see the past
You know love was made for a dreamer
And your love has broken mine
Now all your gonna get in the morning is a lonely night

Gonna be a lonely night, nothing but a lonely night
Gonna be a lonely night
You gonna be blue... (fall in love, baby, it's just a love that just can't last)

Gonna be a lonely night, nothing but a lonely night (lonely, lonely)
Gonna be a lonely night (alright, all...)
You gonna be blue...

Gonna be a lonely night, nothing but a lonely night (lonely, lonely)
Gonna be a lonely night (alright, all...)
You gonna be blue...
