Thick shakes little snakes
Fashion accessories earthquakes
Five and dime cherry lime
Wait my turn at the back of the line
Barbed wire forest fire
Muddy trail air in my tires
Downhill's faster much faster
Than uphill no time to kill
Take a chill take a pill
Headrest on the windowsill

I lived alone so i took him home
He doesn't love me but he keeps me company
Everything is alright

Grape soda locked door
Lost shoe satin star
Pink ribbon cellophane
Boxing match football game
Kitchen floor reggie bar
Monster mash corned beef hash
A-ha saxophone
5'3" dial tone
Lips parched sousa march
Flat foot no arch

I lived alone so i took him home
He doesn't love me but he keeps me company
Everything is alright

Why do i always pretend i can spoon a guy and still be his friend?
I always wind up crushed out in the end and it makes me crazy
Whoa - whoa - whoa crazy
Whoa - whoa- whoa

Dolly parton was really smart when
She said
"it's not my head that's broken it's my heart-
Daddy come and get me"
Come and get your baby
Your big crybaby
Is going crazy

Why do i always pretend i can spoon a guy and still be his friend?
I always wind up crushed out in the end
