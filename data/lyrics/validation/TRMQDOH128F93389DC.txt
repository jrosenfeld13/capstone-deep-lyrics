Sometimes you accu-use me, oh yeah, and sometimes you're ri-ight
Sometimes we try-y-y too hard and sometimes we love to fight
With some days you lose and some guys are cru-uel
And sometimes you really got to choose what's good for you-ou
Groove baby, groove baby, groove baby
Take what's good for you
(Groove baby, take what's good for you)
Groove baby, groove baby, groove baby
Take what's good for you
(Groove baby, take what's good for you)
Sometimes you mo-o-ove me and some days you don't wanna try-y-y
Some days will never change thi-ings and sometimes it's better that way
Some days you lose and some guys are cru-uel
And sometimes you really got to choose what's good for you
Groove baby, groove baby, groove baby
Take what's good for you
(Groove baby, take what's good for you)
Groove baby, groove baby, groove baby
Take what's good for you
(Groove baby, take what's good for you)
Groove baby, groove baby, groove baby
Take what's good for you
(Groove baby, take what's good for you)
Take what's good for you-ou
Groove baby, groove baby, groove baby
Take what's good for you
(Groove baby, take what's good for you)
What's good for you
Sometimes you accu-use me, oh yeah, and sometimes you're ri-ight

Groove baby, groove baby, groove baby
Take what's good for you
