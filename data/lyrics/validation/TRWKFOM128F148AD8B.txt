[Intro]
We still can't care
When you stare

[Verse 1]
Shut up and leave
Do whatever you, please
Slapped me and left me behind
Now what are trying to find
Just let your conscience be your guide!
And you'll discover wrong from right
And pray that you'll recover
Never

[Chorus 1]
We will never know, why the feeling feels so cold

[Verse 2]
Blackened these eyes
With your guilt, in disguise
Pushing the buttons of pain
Nothing to lose, nothing to gain
Follow the path that will drive us insane
What is the purpose for these lies
And scratch beneath the surface
See my eyes

[Chorus 2]
We will never know, why the feeling feels so cold
But we wait for you to care
All I feel's your ice-cold stare

[Refrain]
You stare...And It feels so cold

Stare! Aaah...Stare!

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
Feel your stare
Ice-cold stare
You stare (x3)
And It feels so cold
