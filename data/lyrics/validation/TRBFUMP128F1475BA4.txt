Days go by. Turn into weeks
I'm not vagrant but I've really
Nothing to speak of... life's purposes evading me
Try oh though I might
Can't keep 'em in my sight... And now who's controlling me?
If it's not myself, it must be someone else you see
Face down in a pool of my own sorrow
Will it last or will it leave tomorrow?
Broken man, he's got you on his mind
All life's rewards are broken dreams someone forgot I guess;
Forgot to wake me up you see
Are you suprised the world's not free?
Now words are all you've got
Words aren't good enough for me
You've gutta move if you'll be free
You gutta bow your head
You gutta give it up
Be free
Face down in a pool of my own sorrow
Will it last or will it leave tomorrow?
Broken man, he's got you on his mind
