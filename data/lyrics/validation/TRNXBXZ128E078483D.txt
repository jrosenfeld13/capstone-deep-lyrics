Life is tough if you find you got it all and you're not satisfied
People try to lead you astray
But I ain't gonna fall for the games that they play
I know of the damger
I'm foolin' with strangers
You
You are my one temptation
You
You are the one I've no resistance to
Yeah
Honey
It's you
You are my one temptation
You give me the thrill that I'm addicted to
You're my one temptation
You can look
You can touch
Nothing is free if you pay too much
When there's talk on the street
And the pressure is hot to want more than you got
I don't hear what they're saying
Day out and day in
You
You are my one temptation
You
You are the one I've no resistance to
Nobody knows you are my one temptation
You give me a thrill that I'm addicted to
You're my one temptation
Nothing ever happens till you show your face around
Can't let you see that you turn my world around
My love lines grow and get too strong to say no
You
You are my one temptation
You
You are the one I've no resistance to
Yeah
Honey
It's you
You are my one temptation
You give me the thrill that I'm addicted to
You're my one temptation
