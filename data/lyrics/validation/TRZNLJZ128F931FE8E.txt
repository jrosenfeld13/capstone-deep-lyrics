It's a fragile situation
It could fall apart at any time
And none would be the wiser
'Cept you and I

It seems that we stopped talking
Like we're afraid to disagree
And after we've been through
Can we still be that naive

CHORUS
If my heart isn't in it
Why can't you tell me so
If my heart wasn't in it
I'd have gone long ago
If your heart isn't in it
Why keep me hanging on
Just tell me and I'll be gone
From your life

You treat me like a stranger
As if I wasn't there

Oh, baby, I waited for a miracle
To make you show that you care

CHORUS

If your heart isn't in it
Why can't...

I can't go through the motions
I have to know

If your heart isn't in it
Why can't you tell me so

I can't go to the limit
I have to know

If your heart...
Ooh, can't you tell me so
I have to know
If your heart isn't it
Why keep me hanging on
Just tell me and I'll be gone
Don't keep me hanging on
For dear life
