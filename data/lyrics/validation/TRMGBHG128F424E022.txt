If you can tame my heart than half the battle's won
If you teach it how to love again, the deal is done
I've tried and given up because it's all or none
If you can tame my heart then half the battle's won
V1
A new heart shines with love and life so fearlessly
til the one it finds to love can lie so carelessly
As it counts the times in love it counts the liars sting
The lines roll by til it becomes a wind thing
If you can tame my heart than half the battle's won
If you teach it how to love again, the deal is done
I've tried and given up because it's all or none
If you can tame my heart then half the battle's won
V2
The time rolls by and no one seems to even know
The wine flows high but no fun seems to soften stone
Til you came by I'd hope to die before the dawn
If you can tame my heart then half the battle's won
If you can tame my heart than half the battle's won
If you teach it how to love again, the deal is done
I've tried and given up because it's all or none
If you can tame my heart then half the battle's won
