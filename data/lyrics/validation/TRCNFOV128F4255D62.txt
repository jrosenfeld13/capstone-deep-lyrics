Bridge:
Teri To, Teri Ta, Hamesha Yaad Satave (It`s my addiction for you, that troubles me)
I don`t know what you`re saying, all I know is that I came to party!
Teri To, Teri Ta, Hamesha Yaad Satave (It`s my addiction for you, that troubles me)
I don`t know what youre saying, all I knows that I came here to

Vers1:

There`s a party going on, and they`re playin` your favourite song
So girl, get your ass on the floor
I don`t wanna hear no more, I don`t want no excuse
You got rhythm so put it to use, hey!
And if you really wanna get down, take my hand and let me spin you around!
Round we go, round we go

Bridge:
Teri to, teri ta, hamesha yaad satave (It`s my addiction for you, that troubles me)

Chorus:
Rock tha party, rock tha party
Oye hoye ni kudiye teri jawani! (Damn girl, its your body!)
Rock tha party, Rock tha party
Oye hoye jawani aakh mastani! (Damn your body, its your eyes!)
Shake your body, shake your body
Oye hoye jawani teri jawani! (Damn your body...DAMN your body!)
While we rock tha party, rock tha party Hooooooeeeey!

Vers2:

Hoooooooooooo!
Teri yaad satave, tenu dekh dekh (I miss you, even when I see you)
Bas ik pal, ik vari vekh vekh (Just look at me, one moment, one time)
Mainu neend na aawe raat raat (I can`t sleep in tha nights)

Hosh udave raat raat! (Make me high every night)
Ik vari aaja, ik vari aaja , ik vari tu aaja hoooooo!
(Come to me, just one time, only one time, just this time)
Round we go, round we go
