Yours truly, far from booty Starang Wondah *clapping*
AKA Gun Clappa Numba Won, so it's only right I be
The first voice that you hear bringin you on this new
B.C.C. expedition
Duck Down staff is in the motherfuckin house *clapping*
Bringing you this Nocturnal LP (I love those guys)
Nocturnal! Which means to live life at nighttime
Daytime's used to plot schemes for the night prowl baby *clapping*
In other words we see through the bullshit niggas be tryin to do
So for this portion of the album, we bring forth Da Rockness Monstah
*clapping* YouknowhatI'msayin?
(bringin forth Heltah Skeltah) Boo-yaa!

[Rock]

You asked for it who want beef well here's war
For this I pack twin automatic four-fours
Fuck what you heard don't even speak bout my fleet
Many pop shit but bitch when dem see me
Rock out of the realms of dark in BuckTown
Me and Ruck we don't, give a, wiggy what now (wiggy what now)
I wonder, if heads are ready or are they butter
Ain't near one of y'all bitch niggas tough
You can get your clans, posses, cliques bring the static G
We starts mad ruckus and rock domes while we at it G
My soldiers gone psycho let the madness begin (let it begin)
Enter the square if you dare bring a friend
We-a snipe ya, we see in the dark like an owl
So we prowl understand the plan is operation lockdown
Sean Price will slice that punk shit you reppin G
Drugs jewels and Versace niggas need therapy
Enter the great unknown, nocturnal adventures of
Sparsky and Dutch the power forward and the center (whatever)
Needless to mention, this means war
So with the help of my twin shark and boot camp
I declare Heltah Skeltah

We be the W, W, B.C.C
Worldwide, Boot Camp Click till we D.O.A
We continue, smashin crews
Ringin more bells than Mont Raceways and Avenues

Repeat 4X

Here we come (repeat until fades)
