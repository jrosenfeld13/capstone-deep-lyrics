You said you want it all but what you've got
You just talk, talk, all you do is talk
I see your superstitions run around in your mind
And you talk, talk, all you do is talk

You don't seem to listen
You don't seem to know
Your time is ours now
And we won't go away

You are everything, you're everything that I'm not
And you talk, talk, all you do is talk
You are the one and only thing I've got in my heart
And you talk, talk, all you do is talk

You don't seem to listen
You don't seem to know
Your time is ours now
And we won't go away

And you don't mind me now, me now
And you don't mind me

You don't seem to listen
You don't seem to know
