When you speak to me, Treat me like a King
Because you know where I'm coming from
And I'm about to come undone
I'm on a mission honey give me some love

CHORUS
I want everything, everything
I want models and limousines custom built for me
I want everything, everything
I want everything, you see

I'm off to Hollywood, Rolling numbers til I'm feeling good
Yeah this is where the fun begins at the penthouse with the twins
I'm on a binge committing sin after sin

CHORUS

I'm on a binge so honey give me some more

CHORUS
