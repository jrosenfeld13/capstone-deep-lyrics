Caught up in circles
Crazy in the head
You know I'll love you
Till the end - till the end

Everything you love
Everything you hate
All that you desire
Everything you want
Everything you think is Great

Love Hate Desired Fate

Everything you love
Everything you hate
All that you desire
Everything you want
Everything you think is Great

My love won't make you wait

Never but always
Inside out and upside down
Nowhere but everywhere
Makes me even high when I feel down

Everything you love
Everything you hate
All that you desire
Everything you want
Everything you think is Great
Love to hate desired fate
Every little thought inside your brain is about me
Twisted turning most concerning you love to hate me
I'm everything that's good and everything that's bad
But baby, you know I'm te best you ever had
