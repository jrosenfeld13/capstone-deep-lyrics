[Chorus]
To whom it may concern and for those who are listening
We're fighting hard, but it's not with our fist and
Recruiting soldiers livicated to this mission
To dissect this bullshit system
To whom it may concern and for those who are listening
We're fighting hard, but it's not with our fist and
Recruiting soldiers livicated to this mission
To dissect this bullshit system

[Verse 1]
Trying to ride the thin line of divide
Between the rivers and the highways
Pedaling strong moving on, so get on
Or get out of I and I way
When we realize that the Most High divine
Is around and inside we
Then we can stand tall, we won't fall
'Cause we're all Soldiers of Jah Army

[Chorus]
To whom it may concern and for those who are listening
We're fighting hard, but it's not with our fist and
Recruiting soldiers livicated to this mission
To dissect this bushwick system
To whom it may concern and for those who are listening
We're fighting hard, but it's not with our fist and
Recruiting soldiers livicated to this mission
To dissect this bullshit system

[Verse 2]
Deception from those who sit up on dem thrones
Just like Trump in his tower
They say they're friends of me, some imply family
When they call them big brother
They tell us we're free
But they're spying on me every minute on the hour
Their satellites fly as their eye in the sky
'Cause they're all fucking cowards

[Chorus]
To whom it may concern and for those who are listening
We're fighting hard, but it's not with our fist and
Recruiting soldiers livicated to this mission
To dissect this bullshit
To whom it may concern and for those who are listening
We're fighting hard, but it's not with our fist and
Recruiting soldiers livicated to this mission
To dissect this bushwick

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
To whom it may concern and for those who are listening
We're fighting hard, but it's not with our fist and
Recruiting soldiers livicated to this mission
To dissect this bullshit system
To whom it may concern and for those who are...
We're fighting hard, but it's not with our...
Recruiting soldiers livicated to this mission
To dissect this bullshit, alright, alright
