I'm goin' to move to Alabama,  I'm goin' to move to Alabama
I'm goin' to move to Alabama, make Georgia be your home

Ah, she's long and tall
*The way she do the boogie* makes a panther squall

I have to move to Alabama, I have to move to Alabama
I have to move to Alabama to make Georgia be your home

I'm going to show you, common women, how I feel
Going to get me another woman before I leave

I'm goin' to move to Alabama, said I will move to Alabama
Said, I will move to Alabama, make Georgia be your home

Say, mama got the washboard, my sister got the tub
My brother go the whiskey, mama got the jug

I'm goin' to move to Alabama, I'm a-move to Alabama
I'm a-move to Alabama, make Georgia be your home

Well, these evil women sure make me tight
Got a handful of give-me, mouthful of much-obliged

You must've been to Alabama, you must've been to Alabama
You must've been to Alabama to make Georgia be your home

Well, I got a woman, she's long and tall
But when she wiggles she makes a panther squall

She gonna move to Alabama, have you been to Alabama
Have you been to Alabama to make Georgia be your home

Say, mama and papa going to work
Left my sister standing at the watering trough

Well, have you been to Louisiana, have you been to Alabama
Have you been to Alabama to make Georgia be your home

My mama told me
Never lose a woman like she can't love you

Well, have you been to Alabama, have you been to Alabama
Have you been to Alabama to make Georgia be your home

I got up this morning, my hat in my hand
Didn't have no other brown, didn't have no man

Well, have you been to Alabama, have you been to Alabama
Have you been to Alabama to make Georgia be your home
