More time and you've slowed down
Let more dreams tumble down around you
Foundations crumbling to sand

No point in a change of mind
You just got left behind
Fool to think that it could ever be the same again

Now you're nervous
Wasted time
Missed your chances

Bet you thought you were lucky
But now you don't seem happy
Maybe someone wiped that smile clean off your face
