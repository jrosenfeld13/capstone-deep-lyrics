[Chorus:]
Only you can make me happy
Happy
Only you can make me happy

[Verse 1:]
I never thought that I
I'd find someone like you
I feel hypnotized with the things you do

I'll never let you go
No
You're so right for me
I have to let you know
Forever
You and me

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
You must be Heaven sent
Sent into my life
And I compliment you, baby
Baby

We have a love that's strong and true
It's true in every way
I want to be with you
Each and every day

[Chorus:]
Only you can make me happy
Happy
Only you can make me happy
So happy

Only you can make me happy
Happy, happy
Only you can make me happy
So happy, yeah

[Bridge:]
Hello
How you doing, baby?
You know
I was just thinking about you

You know
I am glad to call
Would you come in right over?
Beautiful, baby
I'll be waiting
I love you too

[Repeat x2:]
You're all I need in my life
I don't need no one
I don't need no one but you

[Repeat Chorus:]
