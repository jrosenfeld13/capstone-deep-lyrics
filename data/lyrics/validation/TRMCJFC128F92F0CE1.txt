Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

I wouldn't trade you for the world
Or the pearls in the sea (pearls in the sea)
All the treasures of a kingdom
That's not what you mean to me

You fill all my sweetest dreams
With a love so devi-i-ine (so-o devine)
You're like precious gems and spices
It's so wonderful you're mi-i-ine

I love your tender lips
My heart is at your fingertips
I love the starlight in your eyes
More than you will ever realise

I wouldn't trade you for the world
Or the heavens abo-o-ove (heavens above)
I have heaven here on earth dear
Since you've given me your lo-o-ove

I wouldn't trade you for the world
Or the heavens abo-o-ove (heavens above)
I have heaven here on earth dear
Since you've given me your lo-o-ove...
