The worst person I know, mother-in-law, mother-in-law
She worries me so, mother-in-law,mother-in-law
If she leaves us alone, we would have a happy home
Sent down from below
Mother-in-law, mother-in-law, mother-in-law, mother-in-law

Sin should be her name, mother-in-law, mother-in-law
To me, they're about the same, mother-in-law, mother-in-law
Every time I open my mouth, she steps in, tries to put me out
How could she stoop so low?
Mother-in-law, mother-in-law, mother-in-law, mother-in-law

I come home with my pay, mother-in-law, mother-in-law
She asks me what I make, mother-in-law, mother-in-law
She thinks her advice is a contribution
But if she will leave that will be a solution
And don't come back no more
Mother-in-law, mother-in-law, mother-in-law, mother-in-law

Sin should be her name, mother-in-law, mother-in-law
To me, they're about the same, mother-in-law, mother-in-law
Every time I open my mouth, she steps in, tries to put me out
How could she stoop so low?
Mother-in-law, mother-in-law, mother-in-law, mother-in-law
