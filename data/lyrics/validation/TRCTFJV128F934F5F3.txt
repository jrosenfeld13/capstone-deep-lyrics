You're so right, it's true, what being free can do to you
It's such a hit ... yes, Miss, you're right, nothing's quite like this
You make me listen hard, I sit and stare
But even Godot knows this nowhere
And on a dull/dole day I can see forever ... here I go again
Keep me on line 'cause I'm falling apart (start it up)
How nice ... so this is my life:
Big plate of air with nothing on the side
Anonther day of Q&A (queue'n'nay)
How'm I spose to keep to keep my mind at bay?
I heard them say "We'll put you life on the lin, boy" parBut
They forgot to put the line on the lifebuoy
And I don't git it for the life of me, I'm drowning in the redundancy
See me going down

[Repeat Chorus]
