I don't want to spin my wheels
I don't got no wheels to spin
Now I hear you're hanging out
With electric guitars no doubt
I don't care for anyone
You probably got a lot of fun
You got your own thing going on
In places you don't belong
Could have been mine at the right time
And it seems like, we were all right

Meet me in Anchorage
That's where the action is
There's no nectar there for bees
Only flesh so wolves can feed
Alaskan wilderness
Old convicts slide away
First light at 3 A.M
I can smell the parsley stems

Some people can't relate
And others have a lot to learn
I don't want to spin my wheels
I don't want to let my stomach squirm
If it feels right
At the right time we'll work it out
We'll be alright, I know it oh
Ooooooh oh oh

You've got a reputation
You know how to unwind
And you got a reputation for
Knowing how to read your mind
I don't want to spin my wheels
I don't want to let it all hangout
I just want volcanoes to erupt
And thaw me out
Ohhhhhhhhh
