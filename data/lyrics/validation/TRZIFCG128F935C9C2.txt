[Verse 1]
Are you hanging up your stocking on your wall
It's the time when every Santa has a ball
Does he ride a red nosed reindeer
Does a ton up on his sleigh
Do the fairies keep him sober for a day

[Hook]
So here it is, Merry Xmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

[Verse 2]
Are you waiting for the family to arrive
Are you sure you got the room to spare inside
Does your granny always tell ya
That the old songs are the best
Then she's up and rock 'n' rolling with the rest

[Hook]

What will your daddy do when he sees your mama kissing Santa Claus A-ha

[Verse 3]
Are you hanging up your stocking on your wall
Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall
Do you ride on down the hillside
In a buggy you have made
When you land upon your head
Then you bin slayed

[Hook x3]
