Around the bend in the L&N
They loaded it down with a lot of men
The whistle blow and threw the switch
Nobody knew just-a which one switch
I'm ridin', ridin on the L&N
I ain't jivin', ridin' on the L&N
Well a man named Quin on the L&N
Runnin' around on how she's been
Train slowed down and the men jumped off
I wasn't dead 'cause I heard him callin'
I'm ridin', ridin' on the L&N
I ain't jivin', ridin' on the L&N

A man named Mose with a great big nose
Sleepin' on that pile of toes
The doctor came and he rang the bell
The palla alla
Get well, well, well
I'm ridin', ridin' on the L&N
I ain't jivin', ridin' on the L&N
