[Verse 1]
I never followed leaders
I got no machine
And I've paid my dues all along
Always set to break it
When I mix with other people
'Cause I knew that I was really alone

[Chorus]
Fall out
Fall out with all the leaders and gangs
Fall out
Fall out with all the leaders and gangs

[Verse 2]
I saw my education
It was my indoctrination
Just to be another kind of machine
Always set to break it
When I mix with other people
'Cause I knew that I was not very clean

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Fall out
