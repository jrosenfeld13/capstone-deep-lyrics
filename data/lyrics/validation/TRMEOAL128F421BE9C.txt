Spark Is A Diamond's here, and we're in effect
Want you to push it, babe
Coolin' by day then at night working up a sweat
C'mon girls, let's go show the guys that we know
How to become number one in a hot party show
Now push it

Push it good
Push it real good
Push it good

Yeah, yo, yo, yo, baby-boy
Yeah, you come here, gimme a kiss
Better make it fast or else I'm gonna get pissed
Can't you hear the music's pumpin' hard like I wish you would?
Now push it
Now push it

Push it good
Push it real good
Push it good

Oh, baby, baby

Oh, baby, baby
