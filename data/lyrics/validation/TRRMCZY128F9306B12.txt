I see the balance of things, I admire it, but man is insensible to this
He doesn't care about us
Is it our quest of progress?
We are not the element which has revolutionized life on Earth
I see the balance of things, I admire it, but man is insensible to this

That he, master builder of his own rotten shelter, is not not master creator
Creation of my imagination. Creation of my imagination
Your suffering can change everything in your life
See who your friends are
Creation of my imagination
What are men able to do for the power?

He doesn't care about us
Is it our quest of progress?
We are not the element which has revolutionized life on Earth
