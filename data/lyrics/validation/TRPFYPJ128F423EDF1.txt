Always get in the way, never fall in line
Many have tried
Our lives they never felt right
We don't undersand

Somewhere we can feel it
Somewhere over there
Somewhere we can find it
Anywhere

Don't wait, the moment will fade
And you're on your own
Do you think so
All alone cause you never leave your home
You were never fine, so afraid of your life
Now she's into his thing cause he's gonna buy a ring
What a foolish bride
Open your eyes
Our lives thay never felt right, we don't understand

Somewhere we can feel it
Somewhere over there
Somewhere we can find it
If we dare

I have hope, but mistakes i made hang on
Read my note, gonna cherish our photos
Going solo

Somewhere we can find it
Anywhere

Somewhere we can feel it
Somewhere over there
Somewhere we can find it
Anywhere

Somewhere we can feel it
Somewhere over there
Somewhere we can find it
If we dare

Somewhere we can find it
If we dare
