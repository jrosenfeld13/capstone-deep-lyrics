O holy night the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth

(O little town of Bethlehem I'll still be singing life
Of all the deaf and promise that silent stars roll by.)

And it came to pass in those days that there went out
A descree from Ceasar Augustus that all the world should be taxed
And all went to be taxed, everyone into his own city
And Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth
Into Judeea into the city of David which is called Bethlehem
To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife being great with child
And so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished
And she should be delieverd
And she brought forth her firstborn son
And wrapped him in swaddling clothes
And laid him in a manger because there
Was no room for them in the inn

Away in a manger, no crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head
The stars in the sky looked down where he lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay

And there were in the same country
Shepherds abiding in the field
Keeping watch over their flock by night
And to the angel of the Lord came upon them
And the glory of the Lord shone round about them
And they were sore afraid
And the angel said unto them fear not for behold
I bring you good tidings of great joy
Which shall be to all people
For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour
Which is Christ the Lord and this shall be a sign unto you
Ye shell find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger
And suddenly there was with the angel
A multitude of the heavenly host
Praising God and saying glory to God
In the highest and on earth peace good will toward men...
