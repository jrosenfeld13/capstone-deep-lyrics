Everything's happening
At the turn of the century
I'm gonna buy myself a time machine
Go to the turn of the century

And all those people passing by
And the town crier makes his cry
At the turn of the century
Turn of the century

Big wide hats and men is spats
At the turn of the century
With those horseless carriages
At the turn of the century

And there are lots of things to do
On a bicycle built for two
At the turn of the century
Turn of the century

Everything's happening
At the turn of the century
I'm gonna buy myself a time machine
Go to the turn of the century

And all those people passing by
And the town crier makes his cry
At the turn of the century
Turn of the century, turn of the century
