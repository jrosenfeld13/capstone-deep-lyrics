Nicholas:
She never really had a chance
On that fateful moonlit night
Sacrificed without a fight
A victim of her circumstance
Now that Ive become aware
And Ive exposed this tragedy
A sadness grows inside of me
It all seems so unfair
Im learning all about my life
By looking through her eyes
Just beyond the churchyard gates
Where the grass is overgrown
I saw the writing on her stone
I felt like I would suffocate
Inloving memory of our child
So innocent, eyes open wide
I felt so empty as I cried
Like part of me had died
Im learning all about my life
By looking through her eyes
And as her image
Wandered through my head
I wept just like a baby
As I lay awake in bed
And I know what its like
To lose someone you love
And this felt just the same
She wasn't given any choice
Desperation stole her voice
Ive been given so much more in life
Ive got a son, Ive got a wife
I had to suffer one last time
To grieve for her and say goodbye
Relive the anguish of my past
To find out who I was at last
The door has opened wide
Im turning with the tide
Looking through her eyes
