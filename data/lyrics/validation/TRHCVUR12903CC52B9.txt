Barrre-Fuller-Payne-Tackett

Gettin' it while you can
Before the fascination goes
Down to the very last man
Where it stops nobody knows

Nothin to hold you back when the feelin's right
Hidin' from the day and waitin' for the night
It's just a pretty hard thing
To keep gettin' back up after being knocked down

Ain't no backin' down
Ain't no turnin' of the other cheek
The rules of the rest of the town
Ain't the same ones out here on the street
Lookin' for anything that'll make your emotions stir
Like walkin' the street with some tight-skirt sister
It's just a pretty hard thing
To keep gettin' back up after being knocked down

I'm caught in a crossfire
Of a hopeless disillusion
Nothin' but chain link and barbed wire
Defining the confusion

Ain't really enough to hold back the winter wind
Really don't know if it's keppin you out or it's keepin' me in
It's just a pretty hard thing
To keep gettin' back up after being knocked down
It's just a pretty hard thing, A pretty tough town
Ya keep gettin' back up after being knocked down
It's just a pretty hard thing, a pretty tough town
