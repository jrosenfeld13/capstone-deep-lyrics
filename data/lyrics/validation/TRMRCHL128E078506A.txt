Know this ones dedicated to the police dem you know Liar
Cause some of them is wicked and them good for nothing
And dem love pick upon people
And dem think der no right
And I man come to show you dat
Alright alright alright alright

So we kick it up because you
So we kick it up because you know we good to go
One for the money and three for the show
Warning for you and here's a warning for me
No bodder test the beast it coulder end up nasty
Stop you on the street without a reason
Search through your pockets under suspicion
Everybody in here is a prime suspect
Gone are the days where they serve and protect
