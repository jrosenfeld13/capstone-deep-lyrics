[Verse:]
Somebody play on the guitar strings
Makes me think of my favorite songs
Reminds me of when I heard Aretha sing
Gladys, Tina, and Chaka Khan
Can't go back to yesterday
But can we just put the thongs away

[Bridge:]
And fall back in love with music
Nothin' but the music
Oh

Everybody knows that Marvin's gone
Still I gotta tell you what's going on
Said the music gone

[Chorus:]
Where'd the soul go?
It's all about the video
We don't sing no more
Where's the music gone?

Where'd the music go?
It's all just for the dough
It ain't soul no more
Where's the music gone?

[Verse 2:]
Still hear Donny playin' them keys
Singin' one day we'll all be free
Can't even turn on my radio
Somebody hollerin' bout a bitch or a ho

[Bridge:]
Right now I'm missing music
Black folks count on music

Chorus
