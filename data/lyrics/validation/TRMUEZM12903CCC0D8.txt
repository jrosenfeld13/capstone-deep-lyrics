Oh my! The world begins to shine
Good nights turning out just fine
They're fly but for you I'll ever long. Goodbye sad songs

Wherever you are-
I am sunshine
Wherever darkness-
You will light up
If I don't know how-
Well I will have to show how
Wherever sunshine, that's where we are

Tell me have you seen the pictures on my wall?
The past is growing hazy as for you I fall
So high, together we reverse the wrongs. Goodbye sad songs

Wherever you are-
I am sunshine
Wherever darkness-
You will light up
If you don't know how-
Well you will have to show how
Wherever sunshine, that's where we are!

So goodbye sad songs
