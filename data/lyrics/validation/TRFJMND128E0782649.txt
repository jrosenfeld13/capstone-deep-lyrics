Babe I don't want you no more
And I'm sick about all the game
You're playin' behind that door

Too much lies
Too much guys
Lonely nights
Bleedin' fights
Jealousy stay away from me

Babe, babe!
Get out, get out
Of my life
You're livin', livin'
Out of my heart
I say I
I don't want you no more

There's a man upstairs
There's a man downstairs
There's a man under the bed
& one across the street

All the friends you got
They will give you a home
