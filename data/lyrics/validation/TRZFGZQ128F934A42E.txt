[Verse 1]
Hear our cry, O King of heaven
Jesus, hope to every heart
We are lost without Your glory
We are lost without You, God

[Verse 2]
Be the fire that burns within us
Flames of love that purify
Send Your power and Your salvation
Let us see Your kingdom come

[Chorus]
Only You can move the mountains
Only You can heal our land
Christ alone, our hope and glory
Christ alone in You we stand

[Verse 3]
Turn Your eyes and show us mercy
How we need Your Father's love
Lead us home and out of darkness
With Your gospel burning bright

[Chorus]
Only You can move the mountains
Only You can heal our land
Christ alone, our hope and glory
Christ alone in You we stand

[Bridge]
We believe our God is mighty
We believe our God is here
We believe our King is coming
Christ alone, in You we stand

Praise the Lord our God is mighty
Praise the Lord our God is here
Praise the Lord our King is coming
Christ alone, in You we stand

[Chorus]
Only You can move the mountains
Only You can heal our land
Christ alone, our hope and glory
Christ alone in You we stand
