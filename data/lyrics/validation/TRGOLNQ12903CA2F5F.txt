[Verse 1: Justin Robinson]
Well tell me, pretty baby, do you think you're too sweet to die?
Well tell me, pretty baby, do you think you're too sweet to die?

[Chorus: Justin Robinson]
'Cause we kiss and we cuss and we carry on
We kiss and we cuss and we carry on
Until the break of dawn

[Verse 2: Justin Robinson]
Well, I was born in the country, you think I'm easy to fool
Well, I was born in the country, you think I'm easy to fool

[Chorus: Justin Robinson]
'Cause we cuss and we kiss and we carry on
We cuss and we kiss and we carry on
Until the break of dawn

[Verse 3: Justin Robinson]
Well, I see you smiling babe, the knife behind your back
Well, I see you smile, the knife behind your back

[Chorus: Justin Robinson]
We kiss and we cuss and we carry on
Yeah, we cuss and we kiss and we carry on
Until the break of dawn

[Verse 4: Justin Robinson]
Well tell me, pretty baby, do you think you're too sweet to die?
Well tell me, pretty baby, do you think you're too sweet to die?

[Chorus: Justin Robinson]
'Cause we kiss and we cuss and we carry on
We kiss and we cuss and we carry on
Until the break of dawn

[Outro: Justin Robinson]
Oh woman, till the break of dawn
Until the break of dawn
Until the break of dawn
