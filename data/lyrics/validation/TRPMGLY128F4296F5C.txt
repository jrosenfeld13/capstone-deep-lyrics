Keep on pushing

I've got to keep on pushing (mmm-hmm)
I can't stop now
Move up a little higher
Some way, somehow

'Cause I've got my strength
And it don't make sense
Not to keep on pushin'

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Keep on pushin'

Now maybe some day
I'll reach that higher goal
I know that I can make it
With just a little bit of soul
'Cause I've got my strength
And it don't make sense
Not to keep on pushin'

Now look-a look (look-a look)
A-look-a yonder
What's that I see
A great big stone wall
Stands there ahead of me
But I've got my pride
And I'll move on aside
And keep on pushin'

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Keep on pushin'

Coda (repeat to fade):

Keep on pushin'
