[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: Justin Vernon]
We were safe when love would come in
Wearied my mind, saw relief
Well, the earth is but a sad fucked up and puked up big dismay
And we resolved to swim around in circles so slowly

[Verse 2: Justin Vernon]
Those cents you said you sent me
Are rolling alone
Burning truth along in one light
For I'm feeling sad
So many killed
We're running their engine

[Verse 3: Aaron Dessner]
Just like we ought to be for them, real hard
Could I quitted on or bought in? The sorry might do it
But I've moved on with more life in me
Big red machine

[Outro: Justin Vernon]
'Cause all I've learned is to suffer
'Cause all I've learned is to suffer
'Cause all I've learned is to suffer
