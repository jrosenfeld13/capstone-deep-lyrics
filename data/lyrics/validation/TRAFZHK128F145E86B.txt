Come on, take a look at what I've got inside
Steppin' up to me I'll make you question your mind
So step up! Step up! And eat a piece of your pride
Even the big look kind of small
So if you're gonna snooze ya' lose and don't forget it
It happens again, guess you're never gonna get it
You'll never learn, no, you'll never knock me over
If you're offended by a freak, stop coming to the show

No name calling, everything will change
What will you do now that everything is rearranged?
Can you sit back and laugh about the things that I do
When I try? Will you try for me?
I'm fed up with everything 'bout me
When I think back to how it used to be
Sit there and watch me pretend

You bore me now
You bore me now, what am I supposed to think?
Boring, somehow you think you're so much better than me

Come on, take a look at what you left behind
Steppin' off will make you race for the life
So shut up! Shut up! Or eat a piece of your pride
Even the big look kind of small
So if you're gonna snooze ya' lose and don't forget it
It happens again, stop! You'll never get it
You'll never learn, no, you'll never knock me over
If you're offended by a freak, stop coming to the show

No name calling, everything will change
What will you do now that everything is rearranged?
Can you sit back and laugh about the things that I do
When I try? Will you try for me?
I'm fed up with everything 'bout me
When I think back to how it used to be
Sit there and watch me pretend

You bore me now
You bore me now, what am I supposed to think?
Boring, somehow you think you're so much better than everyone else

You bore me now
You bore me now, what am I supposed to think?
Boring, somehow you think you're so much better than me

Come on, take a look at what I've got inside
Steppin' up to me I'll make you question your mind
So step up! Step up! And eat a piece of your pride
Even the big look kind of small

No name calling, everything will change
What will you do now that everything is rearranged?
Can you sit back and laugh about the things that I do
When I try? Will you try for me?
I'm fed up with everything 'bout me

You bore me now
You bore me now, what am I supposed to think?
Boring, somehow you think you're so much better than everybody else

You bore me now
You bore me now, what am I supposed to think?
Boring, somehow...
