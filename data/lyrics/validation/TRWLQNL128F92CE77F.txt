[Chorus]
Everyday will be like a holiday
When my baby, when my baby comes home

[Verse 1]
Now she's been gone for such a long time
Ever since she's been gone, she been on my mind
I got a letter today, just about noon
She said, "Don't worry, I'll be home soon"

[Chorus]
And everyday will be like a holiday
When my baby, when my baby comes home

[Verse 2]
I'll never have to worry about sitting by the phone
When she gets here, I'll never be alone
She said she'd get here sometime today
I know when she gets here, she'll never go away

[Chorus]
And everyday will be like a holiday
When my baby, when my baby comes home
Oh, everyday will be like a holiday
When my baby, when my baby comes home
