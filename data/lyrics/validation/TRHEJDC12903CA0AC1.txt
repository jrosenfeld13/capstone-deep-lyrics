(C. Stepney - R. Johnson)

I'm flying high about the clouds
Wherever we choose to be
A barren land becomes a paradise
Your touch is all that I need
Whenever we are, Wherever we are

Never, ever say you don't love me truly
Whenever, however, wherever
For as long as you live be faithful to me
Forever, whenever, wherever
Whenever, however, wherever

How my days are passing differently
When I'm with you the universe has no mystery
The reasons clear, for you are here
Your love colors my days
Whenever we are, wherever we are
