Oh, oh
Would you believe me if I told ya
You only dream about big
Would you relieve me of my worries
If I could give you something special
You said to celebrate who you are
No one else could take you so far, oh
Girls
No one else could take you so far, oh
Even though I'm hurting
Something special babe
Would you believe me if I told ya
Would you believe me ? If I told you something special
Happy fucked up, happy fucked up

Would you relieve me of my worries
If I could [?] something special
You said to celebrate who you are
No one else could take you so far, oh
You said to celebrate who you are
No one else could take you so far, oh
