Here i am in the back again
Whispers something to a friend
Plays the songs like he knew his own
Walk away you're all alone
Separated it's hard for you
Wasting time like you only can
There's much to say, here you are again
Whoevers' listening this time around
Seem to doubt about your sound
What's at home, who's life you live?
Someone asks and you never give
What you have nobody wants
No self esteem, it's your own fault
In the back again, whispering to that same old friend
Plays the songs their his very own
Walk away you're still alone
