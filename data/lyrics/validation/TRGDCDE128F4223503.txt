I sit here staring at the wall
Asking why i set myself to fall
Think to myself, is this my life

We lie we cheat we steal we climb
We beg we fall we hope we die
I think, we're doing it wrong
Doing it wrong

I stand outside
And watch the world fly and pass me by
It;s nice to look and learn but never experience
The pain, the guilt, the fear, the hate
The pride, the shame, of stupid mistakes
We're doing it wrong

I push away my past
What am I hiding from
Can't open up myself
To the people that i love
In my final days
I wanna look back and know that i tried
The best that I can,So i can move on
To another Disease and i do believe
That time is on my side, I've had fun

I'll never think, that I'm alone
When i hear you, I feel at home
Somebody help me, hear me
I'm screaming over here
