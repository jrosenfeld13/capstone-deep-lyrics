[Verse 1]
We have time for racism
We have time for criticism
Held bondage by our ism's

[Chorus]
When will there be a time to love

[Verse 2]
We make time to debate religion
Passing bills and building prisons
For building fortunes and passing judgements

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
At this point in history we have a choice to make
To either walk a path of love
Or be crippled by our hate

[Verse 3]
We have time to cause pollution
We have time to cause confusion
All wrapped up in our own illusions

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
We have time to conquer nations
Time for oil excavation
Hatred, violence and terrorism

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
At this moment in time
We have a choice to make
Father god is watching
While we cause mother earth so much pain
It's such a shame

[Verse 5]
Not enough money for
The young, the old and the poor
But for war there is always more

[Chorus]

[Verse 6]
We make time for paying taxes
Or paying bills and buying status
But we will pay the consequences

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Now's the time to pay attention
Yes now is the time... to love.....love
A time love... love...love
A time to love
Please, please won't you tell me
When will there be a time to love
Please, please won't you tell me
When will there be a time to love
Please, please won't you tell me
When will there be a time to love
Please, please won't you tell me
When will there be a time to love
Please, please won't you tell me
When will there be a time to love[x4]
