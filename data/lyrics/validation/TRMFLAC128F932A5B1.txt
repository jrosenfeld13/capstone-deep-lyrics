And put your hand in a parting wave
Pass around
Make a shroud pulling combs through a backwash frame
Find the copies in a carbon mount
Pass around
Stroke a pocket with a print of a laughing sound

Get around town, get around town
Where the people look good, where the music is loud
Get around town, no need to stand proud
Add your voice to the sound of the crowd

The shades from a pencil peer
Pass around
A fold in an eyelid brushed with fear
The lines on a compact guide
Pass around
A hat with alignment worn inside

Get in line now, get in line now
Stay in time with the rhythm and rhyme
Get around town, get around town
Where the people look good, where the music is loud
Get around town, no need to stand proud
Add your voice to the sound of the crowd

Get in line now, get in line now
Stay in time with the rhythm and rhyme
Get around town, get around town
Where the people look good, where the music is loud
Get around town, no need to stand proud
Add your voice to the sound of the crowd

Get in line now, get in line now
Stay in time with the rhythm and rhyme
Get around town, get around town
Where the people look good, where the music is loud
Get around town, no need to stand proud
Add your voice to the sound of the crowd
