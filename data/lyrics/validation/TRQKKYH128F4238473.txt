I wish I was in heaven high
For night and day I just wait and cry
And from my arms he flew one night
To where I cannot find

I wish I had the wings to fly
For in this world he left no sign
But maybe someday he'll bring me back
To where I cannot find

Had I the heart to tell him then
He might have stayed until the end
But maybe someday we'll meet again
In where I cannot find
