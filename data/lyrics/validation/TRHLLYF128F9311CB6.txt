[Intro]
This is, this is, this is
You like this
You are now witnessing the {{shit}} in the world
I can't think of nothing else to say
Christina Milian
Cool & Dre
Come on

[Christina Milian]
I got the urge to sream out
Pull out your purse, let's be out
And I don't know about you
But I'mma get it poppin like I'm suppose to do
Don't hold your breath, girls breathe out
Sweat out your perm, pull your weave out
And tell the world it's time
That we got love, heard we gon scream about

[Hook]
I'mma make it happen, I'mma make a way
If you got something to prove and you feel the same way
Say I-I-I-I-I-I! I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I!

I'mma keep it gangsta, I'mma make it hot
If you feeling like I do, ten people throw your hands up
And say I-I-I-I-I-I! I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I!

[Christina Milian]
You wanna dance then get down
You tryna hill then sit down
Do what you want to do
Don't let nobody tell you what you're suppose to do
You wanna go and keep grinding
Try to jook the feds, and you ain't tryna do no time then
I know you feel it's rough
And if you with me people, let me see your hands up and say

[Hook]

[Young Jeezy over Hook]
Yeah, yall heard the lady (Ha ha)
Say I if you feel it, yeah
Yall already know it is
TC, show me
I got it from here Chris' damn

[Young Jeezy]
My nephew getting older and he starting to talk
Now my moms got sick and she can't walk
No high school diploma but I know math
Ain't write one song but she still want half
Dead beat dad is what the media would say
Best father in the world, that's what my son would say
Won't stop till you broke, that's what his moms would say
But hey, them are types of games she play
The media talk so bad about me
But the streets'll do so bad without me
Can't ban the snowman
This is Thug Motivation, just part of the program
YEAHHHHHHHHHHH, The first day of class
And all you gotta do is stack cash to pass
Don't mind me, I'm just thinking out loud (Heeeyyy)
Purple {{haze}} got my head in the cloud

[Christina Milian]
Get into it, let's just face it
We can do it if we try (We can make it if we try, make it if we try)
Ain't nothing to it, let's just take it
We can make it if we try (Say Ohhhhhhhh)
Let's just do it, we can make I
I know we'll make it if we try (Say Ohhhhhhhh)

[Hook]

[Christina Milian]
Get into it, let's just face it
We can do it if we try (Try try)
Ain't nothing to it, let's just take it
We can make it if we try (Try try)
