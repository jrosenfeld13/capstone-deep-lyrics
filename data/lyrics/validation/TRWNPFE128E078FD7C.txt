I'm gonna hit it and against the rock
I'm gonna hit it and against the rock, hit it
I'm gonna hit it and against the rock, hit it, I'm gonna hit it and against the rock, hit it
I'm gonna hit it and against the rock, hit it

I skipped the part about love
I skipped the part about love

I'm gonna hit it and against the clock
I'm gonna hit it and against the clock, hit it
I'm gonna hit it and against the clock, hit it, every minute and against the clock, hit it
I'm gonna hit it and against the clock, hit it

I skipped the part about love
I skipped the part about love

Break my heart with a frying pan

Liar, liar
Liar, liar
Liar, liar

I'm gonna hit it and against the rock (liar)
I'm gonna hit it and against the rock
I'm gonna hit it and against the clock
I'm gonna hit it and against the clock, hit it
I'm gonna hit it and against the clock, hit it
I'm gonna hit it and against the clock, hit it
I'm gonna hit it and against the rock, hit it
I'm gonna hit it and against the clock, hit it
