Sometimes I get so depressed y'all
The same things don't go my way
But if I can reach out and help somebody
Than I've had a good day
If I could help some sister or brother
If I could reach and help somebody
Than I have had a good day
If I could reach out help somebody
Help somebody find their way
If I could help feed somebody that's hungry
Help someones that's lost be found
Have a little mercy
On those who's right or wrong

Help someone who's blind see
Brightens someones life
That's filled with misery

If I could reach out help somebody
Help somebody find their way
If I could reach out and help somebody
Than I've had a good day

I've I could get some one out there
Who might going down the wrong path
Let him realize what he's doing is bad

If I could reach out, help somebody
