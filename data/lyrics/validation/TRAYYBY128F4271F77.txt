I'm on a plane
That takes me away
From the place
Where I belong

The choices I made
Before guilt came
They're not right
They are not wrong

You're in my head
I wrote you this song
Sometimes I think I belong
Maybe I'm sad
Maybe I'm glad
But I'm ready for the night

People are passing by
Living busy lives
Trying to forget
That part at night
Everyone's the same
Playing dirty games
Wondering if anyone
Will find out
How we really are
Selfish to the bone
I want what I need
And I'll have it now
You can't hold me down

I'm one a plane
That takes me away
From the place
Where I belong

The moments we shared
Are in the back of my head
I'll keep 'em there
For a while

It's important that I
Don't ever abide
Because you have a
Reason to stay
Maybe one day
When all fades away
I'll be knocking on
Your door
