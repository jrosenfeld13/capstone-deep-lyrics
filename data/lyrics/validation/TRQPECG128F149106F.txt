It's been so long
Since I've touched
So long
Since I wanted
Then you made me laugh
And my heart opened

I want you to find me
Charming and wise
I just want you to find me
Somewhere here inside
I barely know you
We've been sort of friends
So what if I called you
And called you again?
What would I tell you?
Where would I begin?

Please forgive me
If I don't know what to do
It's an old fire
This familiar desire
But my skin is painfully new

There's a light in my window
It shines all night long
In the morning, my coffee
Is sweet but it's strong
I carefully reach out
From behind these walls
I'll take a deep breath
And give you a call
"Hello how are you?"
"Not much at all"

Please forgive me
If I don't know what to do
It's an old fire
This familiar desire
But my skin is painfully new

Lost in this hole
That has ripped through my soul
I unlock this secret inside
What should I think?
I've had too much to drink
As my mind and my body collide

Please forgive me
If I don't know what to do
It's an old, old fire
This familiar desire
And my skin is painfully new

It's been so long
Since I've touched
It's been so long
Since I wanted
Then you made me laugh
And my heart opened
