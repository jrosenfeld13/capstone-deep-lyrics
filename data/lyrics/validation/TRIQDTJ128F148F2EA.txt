I spent half my life on bended knee
Begging somebody to change
And the other half prayin' to God
That they never would
And all it got me was twice as lost
When it all turned out the same
But all that beggin' finally did somebody good
I used to dream all night
Of a day that was gone
But come the mornin' light
Forever from now on

Gunna do my dreamin' with my eyes wide open
I'll do my looking back
With my eyes closed
We can do some livin'
Or spend our whole lives hopin'
End the end we're left with
The one we chose
So I'll do my dreaming with my eyes wide open

Every time the world moved on
I fell a little further behind
From runnin' back or followin someone home
Until I learned that one step forward
Will take you further on
Than a thousand back or a million that ain't
Your own
I used to dream all night
Of a day that was gone
But come the mornin' light
Forever from now on

Gunna do my dreamin' with my eyes wide open
I'll do my looking back
With my eyes closed
We can do some livin'
Or spend our whole lives hopin'
End the end we're left with
The one we chose
So I'll do my dreaming with my eyes wide open

We can do some livin'
Or spend our whole lives hopin'
In the end we're left with
The ones we chose
So I'll do my dreaming with my eyes wide open
