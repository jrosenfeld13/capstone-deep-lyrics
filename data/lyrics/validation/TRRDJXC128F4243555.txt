No left tonight
I have come to you in my dreams
Imagination running wild
Until I get to the end

That's what we got
We've got it good

I think of you
The way you want me to
I long for you
Until the night is through

I imagine you next to me
Hiding out to ecstasy
I can feel your breath, it's burning
You're burning fire

I think of you
I think of you
I think of you
I think of you

Staring at the shadow
It reminds me of you
You're the only on my mind
As you love me too

Don't let me down
You've got all the looks I need
Imagination running wild
As I begin again

That's what we got
We've got it good
