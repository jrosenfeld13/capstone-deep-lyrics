Picture this nigga me a ghetto millionaire
And all my fucking enemies evaporated (evaporated)
Only the real can feel me (only the real)

Let's ride this one's for the killers and dealers
Still bout it bout it nigga now the world gone feel it (3X)

Stomach pains in the ghetto when I'm starving
But picture me a third ward nigga ballin'
A house on the lake and one on the hill
A mansion and a Ferrari worth millions in dollar bills
If the game won't change me these niggas won't tame me
This bitches won't brain me and everybody blame me
Niggas gettin' paid started from the streets
If a nigga don't hustle then mama don't eat
I live my life with some thugs I run with killers and G's
Tech-nine and Oz's gone off hennessy and weed

Chorus(2X)

I'm asking ya'll a question who make these white laws
And all the taxes I pay why don't the government protect superstars?
They couldn't save Biggie and what about 2Pac
My little brother C-Murder went to jail with AP-9 and two Glocks
This ghetto got me trapped these fiends drivin' me crazy
I'm duckin' dodgin' the police, penitentiary, and daisy
Protected by soldiers live my life smokin'
The ghetto bottles are broken and cast popped open
Nobody want to die young but everybody gotta go
So pass me the stress release cuz even Bill Cliton smoke

Chorus(3X)

Nigga we riders (riders) for every fucking one of us they take
We takin' a hundred of them
We gonna make some motherfuckin' statements too now
But you know what that we mortalizin' together and comin' together
And we diein' together it ain't no game niggas soliders black power
'til death do us part nigga for every nigga they take we gone make 100 more
To multiply ya'll niggas multiply (wake up niggas, we gotta stop killin' each other) No Limit like gremlins nigga
Water make millions, ya heard? (nigga we don't make dope they make dope)
If all ya'll niggas talkin' to the feds tryin' to get a nigga locked up
Then ya'll know a nigga that changed his whole attitude
Changed his whole motherfuckin' game nigga we too motherfuckin' legit to quit
So ya'll read about that and ya'll motherfuckin' media
That want a nigga to war this rap wars and shit niggas don't kill niggas
The media kills niggas I feel your pain Suge Knight nigga Death Row Records
No Limit motherfuckin' records (could be anyone of us) niggas unite
(they don't want niggas to make it out of the ghetto)
Take advantage of opportunites ya heard me?  To all ya'll fucking niggas out there
Livin' like guppies ya'll know No Limit niggas we wet guppies up
(wet'em up) ya'll remember that this is from the motherfucking Last Dizzon
Not the last tizzime though.  This is for all my No Limit soldiers from the south to the west
To the east to the motherfuckin' north let's ride niggas
Real niggas don't die we multiply nigga gotta pack some heat cuz
That's the only way he gone protect himself I don't give a fuck if I
Just got off parole nigga I'm gonna protect me and mines nigga
You protect you and yours
