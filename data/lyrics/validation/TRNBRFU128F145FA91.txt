Thought the heart was worth something
I just sold mine to somebody for nothing
Thought the heart was worth something
But...
(whispered throughout)

Love was a game, and he won too fast
Yeah, love was a painkiller that never lasts
And I hate to say that I won't care for it no more
Yeah, it was real to start, but a pretender got my heart

Oooo...
(I caught you out)
(Pretender)
(I found you out)

Love can be strange, when you're open and na've
Love got a hold, got a gun, and then shot me
And I hate to say that I won't care for it no more
Yeah, it was real to start, but a pretender got my heart

Oooo...
(I caught you out)
(Pretender)
(I found you out)

And now all I have is what you forgot
(oooo) And it's all because of you babe
And all that my heart needs now
Is a resting place if it's not too late, oh

Oooo...
(I caught you out)
(Pretender)
(I found you out)

I thought the heart was worth something
I just sold mine to someone for nothing

(repeat to end)
