She's seductive, but she does it well
She'll charge you by the hour
For a straight trip down to hell
She'll correct you, when you think you know
She's gonna let me go, she's gonna let me go

I'm not a lover, but I'm still concerned
That when you touch the fire
That your heart could still be burned
I should warn you that I know
She's gonna let me go, she's gonna let me go

See all those familiar faces
Crowded in my mind
I know that now is not the time
Run around with someone else
Satisfy yourself but don't fool me
Don'tcha let it be a state of emergency

Pledge allegiance to the cause
She'll tell you that she's leaving
If you don't put your life on pause
She'll surprise you, when you think you know
She's gonna let you go, she's gonna let you go

See all these familiar faces
Crowded in my mind
I know that now is not the time
Run around with someone else
Satisfy yourself but don't fool me
Don'tcha let it be a state of emergency

I know it's hard when life's unfair
But that doesn't mean you shouldn't care
Show me the way to reach your heart
Where do I start

See all these familiar faces
Crowded in my mind
I know that now is not the time
Run around with someone else
Satisfy yourself but don't fool me
Don'tcha let it be a state of emergency
