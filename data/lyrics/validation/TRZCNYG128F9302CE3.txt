[Verse 1]
Look yonder comin', mercy me
Three wise men in a SUV
Corporate logo on the side
Air-conditioned quiet ride

[Verse 2]
That thing don't run on french fry grease
That thing don't run on love and peace
Takes gasoline to make that thing go
Now bring your hands up nice and slow

[Chorus]
Take us to the land of milk and honey
Sing and dance all night long
Whatcha gonna do with all that money?
Whatcha gonna do when that money's all gone?

[Verse 3]
Negotiation's just no fun
And it don't serve our interests none
Gonna turn up the heat 'til it comes to a boil
And then we'll go get that A-rab oil

[Verse 4]
We'll suck it all up through the barrel of a gun
Everyday's the end of days for some
Republicans don't cut and run
Tell me, ain't you proud of what we've done?

[Chorus]
Take us to the land of milk and honey
Sing and dance all night long
Whatcha gonna do with all that money?
Whatcha gonna do when that money's all gone?

[Instrumental]

[Verse 5]
You keep talkin' that shit like I never heard
Hush, little president, don't say a word
When the rapture comes and the angels sing
God's gonna buy you a diamond ring

[Chorus]
Take us to the land of milk and honey
Sing and dance all night long
Whatcha gonna do with all that money?
Whatcha gonna do when that money's all gone?
Take us to the land of milk and honey
Sing and dance all night long
Whatcha gonna do with all that money?
Whatcha gonna do when that money's all gone?

[Outro]
Take us to the land of milk and honey
Take us to the land of milk and honey
Take us to the land of milk and honey
Take us to the land of milk and honey
(Take us to the land)
(Whatcha gonna do with all that money?)
