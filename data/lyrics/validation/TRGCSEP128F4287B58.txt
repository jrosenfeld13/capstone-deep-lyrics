They Face The Night, Will They Return Again?
Eyes Wide With Fright, Religion They Defend
Holding Their Guns With A Tight Grip
Hiding Their "Sighs" As They Pray

And They Pray, So I Pray

The Last Thing To Remember, You Can't Run Away
There'll Be No Surrender
The Lives Are Lost But They Are Free At Last

Marching On, Can You See The Children Of The Dawn
They Are The Chosen Ones Who Suffer In The End
Marching On, Can You See The Children Of The Dawn
What Are They Fighting For In Your Holy War?

Ohh, Miles To Go
And Their Young Hearts Yearn
There's Salvation The Next Life
But The Sand Just Burns

Now The Cannons Thunder
As Ordnance Lights The Sky
The Whole World Stare In Wonder
The Lives Are Lost But They Are Free At Last

The Days Are Months, The Months Are Years
But Time Can't Dry Away The Million Tears
When All The Souls Are Gone And Nobody's' Left To Play
The Game Is Over

They Will Never Learn, Never Turn
Away From Violence And Destruction
Never Fear, Never Hear
Throw Caution To The Wind
But They're Out Of Time, Out Of Place
Don't Belong In This Situation
You Don't Know, You Don't Hear
The Pounding Of The Beat They're Marching On, And On
