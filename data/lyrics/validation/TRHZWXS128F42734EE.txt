Right, you bastards!
Worst pornography I've ever seen!
The kind that destroys all the people's dreams
Absolute and true
The hype has now become the norm
The game is take the charts by storm
When it began you saw it through
When it began there was only you
You talked and talked about the chances
Putting money on your steps

A travesty of justice
The time has come to tell the truth
Your Trade is murder
[?]

I tried and tried to understand
But only see the sleight of hand
Now we feel we have no chance
You've led us such a merry dance

[?]
Everything you do I just see green
[?]

All you do and all you say
Won't get it all
Don't be that way
It's what they want
It's what they need
But everyone won't stop me now
What difference does it make to you
If you cheat like all the rest
It's not so hard
Can't see it turning
There's nothing we can do

True to say, I see it when
You close your eyes, you close your eyes
So close now, can see you falling
I just want to laugh
Can you remember when you made your stand?
Before your hyped independent bands
Nine years since it changed
Nine years now it's the same
