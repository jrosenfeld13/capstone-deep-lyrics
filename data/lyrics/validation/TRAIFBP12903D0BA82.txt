Sold to the highest bidder
How does it feel to be meat
Hard as nails like a psycho killer
Runnin' around as if you're oh so street
Well it's time to check yourself
Cause if they find you out they'll
Drop your ass on the damn shelf
Just another corporate tool
Gonna show you why it pays to be genuine fool
Bite the black sheep and emulate
Messages that they create
Our nation is fueled by hate
The decimation of a facist state
Same as it ever was, or maybe not
Sick enough to make your head spin around
Or get your ass shot
I think it's time we made some noise
Drop bombs
Seperate men from boys cause
Independence is king and
Anything else don't mean a god damn thing
