I hear you dancing upstairs moves
As swift as astaire I would like to embrace you but
I'm not in your afterlife oh, ghost of mine!
You haunt these walls forever calling...moaning is there something unsettled?
Were, wounds left wide open to rot?
When you died so many years ago miserable when you died
So many years ago were
Your wounds left wide open?
I'm sorry I have no schooling to sew them shut
For you I'm sorry...oh, ghost of mine
