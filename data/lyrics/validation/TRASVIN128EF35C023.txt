I saw three ships come sailing in
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;
I saw three ships come sailing in
On Christmas Day in the morning

And what was in those ships all three
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day?
And what was in those ships all three
On Christmas Day in the morning?

The Virgin Mary and Christ were there
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;
The Virgin Mary and Christ were there
On Christmas Day in the morning

Pray, wither sailed those ships all three
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;
Pray, wither sailed those ships all three
On Christmas Day in the morning?

O they sailed into Bethlehem
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;
O they sailed into Bethlehem
On Christmas Day in the morning
