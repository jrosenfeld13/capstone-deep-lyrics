There is another machinery taking all the hit
Spreading out it is filth ignoring the perpetual
Guilty. This phase is what consumes me
Repent, this is my bitterness
I'm waiting for this all to end
Forged to function complete
The sight you see is never before seen
The words you speak have never been heard
All new! All gone! So my words didn't lie
Everywhere I turn I see the same face
Striking me, hitting me, killing me
Every where I turn I feel the same fear
Collapsed, I'm being erased
I'm waiting for my chapter to be written
I'm waiting for this all to end
Everywhere I turn I see the same face
Striking me, hitting me, killing me
Every where I turn I feel the same fear
Collapsed, I'm being erased
