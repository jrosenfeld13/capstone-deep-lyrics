Ooh, hoo...yeah
Mmm, hmm

Tired of living life in black and white
There's so much in between
Like a rainbow in the sky
Crying to be seen

When I open my eyes to find inspiration
I search for the best I can see
If I settle for less
I won't be the best I can be

When I dream, I dream in color
There is so much I want to discover
I'll give you so many good reasons
To capture a dream, yeah, yeah

Life is short, but can't be bought, mmm
And time is a very precious thing
I want to go to where I've never been
And see what's never been seen

In the midst of the morning I won't take for granted
There'll always be another new day
Got to live for each moment
Never let time slip away

When I dream, I dream in color
There is so much I want to discover
I'll give you so many good reasons
To capture a dream, whoa...

If I was unaware, if I didn't care
About people and places and things
How could I live a life full and satisfied
Now knowing how to dream
When I dream, oh, yeah

When I dream, I dream in color
There is so much I want to discover
Show me a child who never has seen
A vision that shows what his life really means
I'll give you so many good reasons
To capture a dream
