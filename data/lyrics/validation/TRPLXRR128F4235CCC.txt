Youre waking up martyrs to ask them for lighters
Tears on pillows look like leaves on willows
Bright young boxers with eyes like foxes
Do you like me room you know it comes with a groom
All the best drinkers are very good thinkers
Its pink and attractive like the head of a match is
Arithmetic angels use stage names of angels
There is parties in winder when everybodys bitter
You know youre changing your star sign because you only work part time
Now your standing here naked with a fist full of aphids
Looking round corners to see if you oughta
Youre sleeping in cake tins to try and stay thin
Oh take me there
Shes training pigeons to lose their bearings
They deliver earings to girls with no hearing
Staying sober you get run over
Youre making it up before the cameras go live
Oh take me there
