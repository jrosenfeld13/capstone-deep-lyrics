And the panic of the frantic
Has divided our houses
Spirit of deep sleep has been lifted
Some are pandering for mercy
Some are fighting until the end
I say, the end
Fighting to the end I say

The bread of adversity
And the waters of affliction
Shall not remove our teacher
Jah shall give our heart a song
Lips of indignation tongues of devouring fire

So corn
Thats what a gwan, it a gwan
If you plant corn you gonna reap corn
Thats what a gwan
It a gwan

Corn unto corn a gwan
Lord another youth dead and gone
Corn onto corn a gwan
Lord another youth dead and gone
And then unto us a son is born
Lord unto us a son is born
And then unto us a son is born
Lord unto us a son is born

The government shall be
Upon our shoulder
The brightness of our fire
Will cool troubled water
You enemy will be of your own house
The strength of their desire
Will be for your failure

So corn
Thats what a gwan, it a gwan
If you plant corn you gonna reap corn
Thats what a gwan
It a gwan
