Little things you say and do
Make me wanna be with you
Rave on, it's a crazy feelin'
I know, it's got me reelin'
When you say you say you love me, rave on

The way you dance and hold me tight
The way your kisses say goodnight
Rave on, it's a crazy feelin'
And I know, it's got me reelin'
When you say, you say you love me, rave on

Rave on, it's a crazy feelin'
And I know, it's got me reelin'
When I'm so glad that you're leavin' your love for me
Rave on, come on and tell me
Tell me, not to be lonely
Tell me, you love me only, rave on

Rave on, it's a crazy feelin'
And I know, it's got me reelin'
I'm so glad that you're leavin' your love for me
Rave on, come on and tell me
Tell me, not to be lonely
Tell me, you love me only, rave on
