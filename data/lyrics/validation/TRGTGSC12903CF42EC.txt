I've rushed a million miles, haven't moved at all
Just like the rats, I will keep on going
I've severed all my ties, set up for my fall
And just like that, I'm back at square one

Take me, somewhere
Wake me from this nightmare
Hear me, call out to the world

Someone, somewhere
Save me if I fall, you'll be my savior
Lead the way; I call out to the world

All these countless bugs, crawling in my skin
I'm losing hope, and I'm, going nowhere
I've heard a million lies; my patience's wearing thin
Up to my throat, and I've, heard it all before

Take me, somewhere
Wake me from this nightmare
Hear me, call out to the world

Someone, somewhere
Save me if I fall, you'll be my savior
Lead the way; I call out to the world

Take me, somewhere
Wake me from this nightmare
Hear me, call out to the world

Someone, somewhere
Save me if I fall, you'll be my savior
Lead the way; I call out to the world
