Fashion crisis hits New York
I saw a blind man he was eating his fork
He said thats what you had to do to be cool
You eat your cutlery instead of your food
What a hippy diddly crazy world
What a hippyd iddly crazy world
Well fashion it moves on and on
While the things we've bought
Have been hardly worn
I still like my old three piece suite
But its in the shed and I've got no seat
Oh no no...
They say necklines to the waist
You change your body to keep up with the pace
The rich buy dearest 'cause want to be sure
The poor can't afford to be that insecure
What a hippy diddly crazy world
What a hippy diddly crazy world
