[Intro]
Yes
Black, blackness
The Black side of me
C'mon, listen up

[Chorus]
In all things we commend ourselves
In much patience, in tribulations, in needs, in distress
In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumult
We belong to God

In all things we commend ourselves
In much patience, in tribulations, in needs, in distress
In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumult
We aint givin up

[Verse 1]
See my people on the road walking
I'm not sure as myself where we're headed to
We're going so fast, we're going so fast
And when this question rise ?
Cause they made the rules in which we're living in today
It's all good 'cause there is one who sees you ever
? Take heart

[Chorus]
In all things we commend ourselves
In much patience, in tribulations, in needs, in distress
In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumult
We belong to God

In all things we commend ourselves
In much patience, in tribulations, in needs, in distress
In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumult
We aint givin up

[Verse 2]
You have no trust in the fact that of being strong
Get to know this, get to know this
And though you lack physical riches?
You have achieved spiritual growth. This is what counts
So don't worry about all these things that pass away
'Cause the grace of God is sufficient for you
Don't go astray

[Chorus]
In all things we commend ourselves
In much patience, in tribulations, in needs, in distress
In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumult
We belong to God

In all things we commend ourselves
In much patience, in tribulations, in needs, in distress
In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumult
We aint givin up

[Bridge]
Keep on walkin' baby
Keep on movin' like me
?

[Chorus]
In all things we commend ourselves
In much patience, in tribulations, in needs, in distress
In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumult
We belong to God

In all things we commend ourselves
In much patience, in tribulations, in needs, in distress
In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumult
We aint givin up

[Outro]
It's over, over
It's over, over
