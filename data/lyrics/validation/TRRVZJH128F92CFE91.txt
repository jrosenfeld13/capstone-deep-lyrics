Chains
Chains

We console now you and I
I said hold me there
Hold me
Make the night roll magic
I will not fly away
So now make it, make it rain

Chains
Chains

I have wandered and I have found no reason that I can understand
Why all these boundaries return to where I am
So please break them
Make them break down into -

Chains
Chains

Make the night roll
And hold my hands up to your own
I'm like a man pitied and maimed
Sorrow won't lift our shame like these

Chains
Chains
Chains
Chains
Chains
