I see the picture
Clearer now
And the fog has lifted
The wool you tried
To pull over
My eyes was clever
Yeah your gifted
But you forgot
To dot some I's
And cross some T's
Along the way
I'm better now
Despite you baby
I'm stronger these days
Stronger

I survived the crash
Survived the burn
Survived the worst
Yeah baby
But I learned
Survived the lies
Survived the blues
Almost killed me
But I survived the truth
And when you wrote me off
Like I was doomed
I survived you

I can look in
The mirror now
It's been a
Slow awakening
Haunted by a heart
Full of you
Couldn't help mistaking
That you could ever care for anyone
Anyone but yourself
Hey yeah
But you would have to
Have a conscious baby
Good luck
I wish you well

I survived the crash
Survived the burn
Survived the worst
Yeah baby
But I learned
Survived the lies
Survived the blues
Almost killed me
But I survived the truth
And when you wrote me off
Like I was doomed
I survived you

This heart has been torn in two
Cut and bruised
With too many bitter endings
There's no way
That I'll let thoughts of you
Rain on my new beginning

I survived the crash
Survived the burn
Survived the worst
Yeah baby
But I learned
Survived the lies
Survived the blues
Almost killed me
But I survived the truth
And when you wrote me off
Like I was doomed

I survived the crash
Survived the burn
Survived the worst
Yeah baby
But I learned
Survived the lies
Survived the blues
Almost killed me
But I survived the truth
And when you wrote me off
Like I was doomed
I survived you
