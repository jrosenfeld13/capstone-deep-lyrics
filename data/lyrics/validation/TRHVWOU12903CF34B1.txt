SO HELP ME
Mildred Bailey
So help me, may I never see the moon on high
May I never see the stars close by
So help me, if I don't love you
So help me, may I never know a breath of spring
May I never hear the birds that sing
So help me, if I don't love you
And if I lie then rain should fall
From heave, and blight each day with its teeming
Night should never bring sleep
With its dreaming, sweet dreaming
So help me, may I never see the sight of you
And without you what am I to do
So help me, if you don't love me
