I got a man who tries to run me
Thats the way to make me run away
He dont know hes just a pushin me
To a man who make me happy

Im an independent woman, mmm
I don't need no man to take care of me
Can't nobody pay for my problems
Cause I supply my own security

I need a hide hide hide
Hideaway
To make me runaway
Listen to me:
I need to hide hide hide
Hideaway
To make me runaway, no no

I need you to go

If it ain't one thing ifs another
Dont you get caught up in the truth
Time each other
Love will make you blind everytime
But now I need a little peace of mind
My mistake was lettin my pa down
Settin myself up for this runaround
Now you just dont need to let me go
Cause now I know you dont have no control

I need a hide hide hide
Hideaway
To make me runaway
Sing it with me
I need a hide hide hide
Hideaway
To make me runaway

I need to go

He doesn't no control
