You couldn't feel the sunlight upon your face
Your little world, a little out of place
You couldn't hear the ocean
You couldn't hear the waves
I know you meant to come back
I know you meant to stay

An' all you touch... An' all you knew...
An' all you love... yeah

Oh I can see you smile, can you see my tears?
I reach to hold you, but you ain't there
You left a hole so big, Lord, beyond repair
I try to find forgiveness
In talkin' what we'll never share

[Pre-Chorus]
An' all you touch... An' all you knew...
An' all you love...
You just left 'em with nothing to say

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-ohh
You're just throwin' it all away
Oh-oh, No you didn't care to see the light of day
Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-ohh
You're just throwin' it all away
Like the sand upon the shore
Your crashing waves came took you away

[Pre-Chorus] / [Chorus x2]
