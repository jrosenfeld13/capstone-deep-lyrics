[Chorus][4]
I can't find myself

[Verse 1]
In the head of this stranger in love
Holding on, given up
To another under faded setting sun
And I wonder where I am
Could she run away with him?
So happy and so young
And I stare
As I sing in the lost voice of a stranger in love
Out of time, letting go
In another world that spins around for fun
And I wonder where I am
Could he ever ask her why?
So happy and so young
And I stare

[Chorus]
But I can't find myself
I can't find myself[x3]

[Verse 2]
In the heart of this stranger in love
Given up, holding on
To this other under faded setting sun
And I'm not sure where I am
Would he really turn away?
So happy and so young
And I stare
As I play out the passion of a stranger in love
Letting go of the time
In this other world that spins around for one
And I'm not sure where I am
Would she know it was a lie?
So happy and so young
And I stare

[Chorus]
But I can't find myself
I can't find myself[x3]

[Verse 3]
In the soul of this stranger in love
No control over one
To the other under faded setting sun
I don't know where I am
Should he beg her to forgive?
So happy and so young
And I stare
As I live out the story of a stranger in love
Waking up going on
In the other world that spins around undone
I don't know where I am
Should she really say goodbye?
So happy and so young
And I stare

[Chorus]
But I can't find myself
I can't find myself[x2]
I got lost in someone else
