Oh yeah
Somethin' gettin' wrong with my little machine
Oh yeah
Somethin' gettin' wrong with my little machine
Now an' she gotta standard carburetor
My baby been burnin' bad gasoline

Now I'm goin' do like you
I'm gonna fly up on the mountain top
Lord an' I don't find my baby
It ain't no telling' where I'll stop

Because, oh yeah
Somethin's gettin' wrong with my little machine
Now an' she gotta standard carburetor
Oh, but my baby burnin' bad gasoline

Well, I don't know, baby
I don't know what to do
You know, I don't know what you're pleadin'
Baby, or even gettin' mad with you

But I tell ya, ooh yeah, yeah
Somethin' gettin' wrong with my little machine
Now, you gotta standard carburetor
Oh, but you've been burnin' bad gasoline

Spoken
Now play it for me
You all know how it feels, play

Well, I don't know, baby
I don't know what to do
Baby, you is so sweet
But you just-a won't be true

But oh, yeah
Somethin' gettin' wrong with my little machine
Now she's got a standard carburetor
Oh, but my baby's been burnin' bad gasoline
