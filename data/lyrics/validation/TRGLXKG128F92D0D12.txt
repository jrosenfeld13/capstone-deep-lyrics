It's only love girl you broke my heart girl
You broke my heart and just threw it away come tomorrow
I will feel a change I'll be happy once again
Same old love story please don't cry for me
Being together just tore us apart I'm so sorry
Had to be this way all my love gone in one day
The tears I cried for you are not the same
As the tears you cry for me it's a diff'rent game;
The songs I sing for you they never end
I'll write @a million words my love I'll send
Now it's all over find a new shoulder
Someone will give you the things that you need
Don't forget me
Think of me sometimes
Soon t.he sun will start to shine
The tears I cried for you are not the same
As the tears you cry for me
You are the girl I adore
You are what I'm living for
You are the one who can make me happy
The tears I cried for you are not the same
As the tears you cry
For me . .
