Waking from his eyes ......
He's just a child we'll have to try
I was just kidding all the time
How can I have really died
And why am I dancing, dancing alone?

We'll go out tonight
Still searching
For ways to get high
And I've got mine
I can't feel my hands
I can't feel my hands

I was just kidding all the time
How can I, have really died
And why am I dancing, dancing alone?

Time moves slowly through these walls

Still took years to find
Lost in a world of our own we'll find
With hope in our eyes
That we find another world
