I've been over you for some time now baby
I don't miss your kiss
Like before now
Anymore now
If you ask me how I'm doin'
I'm fine
All I needed was a little time
So if you think that I'll still need ya baby
I really don't know why

Oh baby
Since you left me
I think that my worlds' been torn apart
But if you see me
Baby you'll see that nothin's broken
Nothin's broken but my heart

You won't see no tears in my eyes now baby
If you think I'm sad that you're gone now
Then you're wrong now
If you ask me if I'm happy
I'm free
Tell ya
That's the way I wanna be
& all those nights we shared together baby
Well they don't mean a thing

Oh baby
Since you left me
I think that my worlds' been torn apart
But if you see me
Baby you'll see that nothin's broken
Nothin's broken but my heart
(Repeat to end)
