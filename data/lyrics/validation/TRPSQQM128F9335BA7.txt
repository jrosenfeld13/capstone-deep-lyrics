When you see me smile
I'm smilin' for my baby
When you hear me sigh
I'm sighin' for my baby
When I step out as sharp as a tack
The girls whistle but I never whistle back
'Cause everything I do
I do it for my baby

And every time I dream
I dream about my baby
And every time I scheme
I'm schemin' for my baby
I know my baby, she's never hard to find
Because she's always on my mind
And everything I do
So help me, I do it for my baby

My baby, she's somethin' else
Let me tell you, she's fine
I'm glad I belong to her
And she's mine all mine

Everything I make
I make it for my baby
And every dime I take
Oh I just take 'em for my baby
Now when you see us strollin' down the avenue
You just keep your eyes off you know who
Cause everything I do, you know I do it for my baby
When you see me walking alone
I'm tryin' to make it to my baby
When you hear me singin' a song
I'm just singin' for my baby
