He's the one who stands out in the crowd, He's the one who stands up straight and proud
He's the one that feels out of place, In society he's got a strange face

(Chorus)
{There was no one he could trust so a loner he became
His friends all came and went and a loner he'll remain}

Doesn't matter what he wears, He don't feel right anywhere
Hasn't had friends in his growing years, No one to talk about his hopes and fears

(Chorus)
No one to talk to, he doesn't mind, young loner knows he's one of a kind
Boots and braces he stands alone, Sad life's the only one he's ever known
