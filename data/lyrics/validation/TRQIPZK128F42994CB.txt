If you ever go to Trinidad
They make you feel so very glad
Calypso sing and make up rhyme
Guarantee you one good real fine time

Drinkin' Rum and Coca Cola
Go down "Point Koo mah nah"
Both mother and daughter singin' for the Yankee dollar

Any visitor to Trinidad
Can have good time he never had
If he come just for rest, okay
Then he lie around in sun all day

Drinkin' Rum And Coca Cola
Go down "Point Koo mah nah"
Both mother and daughter singin' for the Yankee dollar
Drinkin' Rum And Coca Cola
