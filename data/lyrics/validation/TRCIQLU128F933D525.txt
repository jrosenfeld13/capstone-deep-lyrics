Friend, that's what they call me
Friends, when they lie behind your back

Why don't they just leave me alone
When they're always asking for more
Useless and lazy
Who don't want to work
Why don't they work for themselves

Friends, who smile at me
Friends, who wish bad on me

(Chorus)
Give me this, give me that
What a bunch of worthless crap
The ride is fun when you're young
But what will you have when it's done?

Friends, who I gave to all of the time
Friends, who want more all the time

(Chorus)
Friends are just like leeches
Especially when you've got what they want
