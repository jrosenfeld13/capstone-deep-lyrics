I can make it disappear but I can't look at the sky
Calling for a black eyed girl, and twist for the world
I'll twist just like a kite
So make up, when you wake up, slow, don't turn on the light
I'll be waiting up for good
So do what you should until you get it right
Get out, good night, so I'm leaving
Anyway you'll have nothing left now but time
Goodbye, and I know I know
I'll never feel my hand in mine
So look around this town
And wonder why all the people stay away
