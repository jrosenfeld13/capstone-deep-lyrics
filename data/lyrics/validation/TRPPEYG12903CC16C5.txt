Come and join my voice in songs of love and death
Come and feel me, steal me, save me from myself
All my longing, wandering heart is yours to have
Come and join my voice in songs of love and death

Tonight well start off our story told
From this day on well watch our lives unfold
Kisses of fate on my shivering skin
You touch my heart and reach for the soul within

Come and join my voice in songs of love and death
Come and feel me, steal me, save me from myself
All my longing, wandering heart is yours to have
Come and join my voice in songs of love and death
Songs of love and death

Tonight our fortune will turn her wheel
Ill close my eyes and listen to what I feel
And when the dawn breaks for you and me
Then we will turn to more than we both could be
