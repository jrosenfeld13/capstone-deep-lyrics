Picture yourself when you're getting old
Sat by the fireside a-pondering all
Picture book, pictures of your mama, taken by your papa a long time ago
Picture book, of people with each other, to prove they love each other a long ago
La, la, la, la, la la
La, la, la, la, la la
Picture book
Picture book

A picture of you in your birthday suit
You sat in the sun on a hot afternoon
Picture book, your mama and your papa, and fat old uncle charlie out cruising with their friends
Picture book, a holiday in august, outside a bed and breakfast in sunny southend
Picture book, when you were just a baby, those days when you were happy, a long time ago
La, la, la, la, la la
La, la, la, la, la la
Picture book

La, la, la, la

A-scooby-dooby-doo
Picture book
La, la, la, la

Picture book, pictures of your mama, taken by your papa a long time ago
Long time ago
Long time ago
Yeah, yeah, yeah
