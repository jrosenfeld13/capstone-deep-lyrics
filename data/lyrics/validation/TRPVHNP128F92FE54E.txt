In a world of dime store diamonds
We're all looking for a gem
You might even find a blossom
In a field of stones and stems
But inside there lies a treasure
Beneath the layers of honest grime
Could You buff this rusted halo
Of this angel out of time
'Til it shines
'Til it shines

Mmm, walking through the streets of Dallas
On a cold dark windy night
There's a beggar on the corner
Barely hanging onto life
But if hope could be his blanket
And if faith could be his wine
He'd be new again tomorrow
I believe he still has time
'Til it shines
'Til it shines

Your love is my compass
Come show me the way
With You there's no driving blind
Help me to polish each moment
Each dream left behind
Oh, 'til it shines

In a world of dime store diamonds
You know I found myself a gem
Love's a flower that can blossom
In a field of stones and stems
Deep inside You placed Your treasure
Now You can see it in my eyes
Could You buff this rusted halo
Only You would take the time
Oh, 'til it shines
'Til it shines

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
'Til it shines
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, 'til it shines
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Only You would take the time
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
'Til it shines
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Of this angel out of time
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
'Til it shines
Oh, 'til it shines
