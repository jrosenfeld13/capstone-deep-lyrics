[Verse 1]
I listen to what you say
'Cause Lord knows I want to believe you
But something inside my heart
Says the words that you tell me are false tunes

[Chorus]
Here it comes again
Then it's gone like a long lost friend
It's with us until the end
The fears that you had will become you

[Verse 2]
You must take upon yourself
To do what you must do
And yet you keep asking yourself
Why the answers you seek still avoid you

[Chorus]
Here it comes again
Then it's gone like a long lost friend
It's with us until the end
The fears that you had will become you

[Verse 3]
Sunshine follows the raindrops
Rainbows follow the dew
I keep following this heart of mine
My heart keeps following you

[Chorus]
Here it comes again
Then it's gone like a long lost friend
It's with us until the end
The fears that you had will become you
The fears that you had will become you, yeah
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah
