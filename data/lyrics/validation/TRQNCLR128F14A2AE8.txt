Home for sale
That's much too large
Too many rooms
Big ol' empty yard
Far more space
Than the owner needs
Price includes
All memories

Home for sale
Restored like new
It's just a place
Two lives outgrew
A change in heart
Forces move away
Would like to keep
But just can't stay

Listen close and you might hear the sound
Of what you think is rainfall leaking down
The roof is fine
Set aside your fears
It's just a few remaining tears

Home for sale
Not all that old
A family's dream
Stands dark and cold
Scenic views
That go for free
Of all the love
That used to be
