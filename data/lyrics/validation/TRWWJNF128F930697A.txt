Testing, turn me up
These streets make me think twice
When I see the hate each day
Burning inside, the friction
Between the masses
It's enough to spark any fire
Pushed to the limit any man would break
This foolish pride makes you weak
It makes you think you have more than me
Do you have what it takes?
Try the hard way, it makes you show you're empty
To the ones I love, I'll stand by you
To the ones I hate, I'll bury you
The ashes of my smile
Burn through you
This love you've given me, turns to rage

These streets make me think twice
When I see the hate each day
Burning inside, the friction
Between the masses
It's enough to spark any fire
Pushed to the limit any man would break

You will break

To the ones I love, I'll stand by you
To the ones I hate, I'll bury you
The ashes of my smile
Burn through you
This love you've given, turns to rage
Have you forsaken me?
Do I have to repeat myself?
The streets we walk each day
Will take you down

These streets make me think twice
When I see the hate each day
Burning inside, the friction
Between the masses
It's enough to spark any fire
Pushed to the limit any man would break

To the ones I love, I'll stand by you
To the ones I hate, I'll bury you

Rise up, or be buried alive

Rise the fuck up fools, or be buried alive
