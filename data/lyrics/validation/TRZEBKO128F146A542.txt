I had everything I ever wanted in my life
Wasn't looking for nobody to be satisfied
Wasn't looking for a honey or a steady girl
'Til I turned around the corner
And you rocked my world

He/She was walking down the street
Body boomin' to the heat
You had everything complete
(Was cold, too cold)
And the funky things you said
Was like music to my head
And I turned around and said
"baby, let's go!"

You're so sexual (oh, sexual, c'mon)
So intellectual (yeah, so incredible)
So emotional (emotional)
You have everything I want
You have everything I need

Upside down you're turning me
Oh, it's an emergency
Could it be I'm falling for your crazy love?
I want your body next to me
Oh, with such an urgency
Could it be I'm falling for your crazy love?

I hear everybody talking
That your mind ain't right
And they all say I'm gone crazy, girl
But that's alright
Cuz the things we do together
Mean so much more
Boy, you've got me feeling things
I've never felt before

You're so sexual (yeah, sexual, c'mon)
So intellectual (so incredible)
So incredible (emotional)
You have everything I want
You have everything I need

Upside down you're turning me... (x2)

Do you know what you want, baby?
Do you like what you see?
Do you wanna have some fun with me?
I can give you just a little taste
Just a little bit
If I give it all to you
Can you handle it?

Let me have it all! (x8)

Upside down you're turning me...

Drive me crazy
You know you drive me crazy (crazy for your crazy love)
You know you drive me crazy
You know you drive me
You know you do, you know you do

You know you drive me crazy
You know you drive me crazy (crazy for you crazy love)
You know you drive me crazy
You know you drive me
You know you do, you know you do

You know you drive me crazy
You know you drive me crazy (crazy for your crazy love)
You know you drive me crazy
You know you drive me
Crazy for your crazy love!
