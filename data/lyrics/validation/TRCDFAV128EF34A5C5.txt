If there's something you need
That you never had
Then don't just sit there
Feeling bad

You better get up
For I'll understand
Just raise your hand

Oh yeah, baby here I am
You know I'm standing in line
I wanna give you my love
Please let me try

I wanna be good
Can't you understand
Just raise your hand

Raise your hand
Just raise your hand

Just raise your hand
I'll understand
Holy, holy, holy

Baby here I am
You know I'm standing in line
I wanna give you my love
Please let me try

You better get up
For I'll understand
Just raise your hand

Raise your hand
Just raise your hand
Just raise your hand
Just raise your hand
Just raise your hand
Just raise your hand
