[Verse 1]
I got shot through a space not long ago
I thought I knew the place so well
It wasn't the same, now it goes to show
Sometime you never can tell

[Chorus]
I'm looking high and low, don't know where to go
I got to double back, my friend
The only way to find, what I left behind
I got to double back again, double back again

[Verse 2]
You know I'm moving on in this fine machine
Rolling on through the night
Seeing things like I've never seen
And it's taking me outta sight

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It's got me up and down
I been lost and found
Down in a deep dark hole
Looks like my luck has changed
I been rearranged
And I'm coming out on a roll

[Chorus]
