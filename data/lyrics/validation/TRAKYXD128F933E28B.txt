Once I had a girlfriend
She made my heart just want to die
She just couldn't stay inside
She'll make you open up your eyes until you've
Cried yourself a river
Throw your hands up in the sky
To be by her side
I'll do anything if just to make her stay
Make her stay
To make her stay
Stay...count the time until you're mine
Will they ever know
We can't deny the world outside just leaves us cold
Count the time until you're mine
They'll never know
Oh, we'll compromise
The world outside just leaves us cold
Once she gave a reason
But the end just made me cry
A red sunrise outside
She made me open up my eyes until I
Finally looked around me
When I heard her soft reply
I can't pretend to try
I'll do anything if just to make her stay
Make her stay
To make her stay
Stay
