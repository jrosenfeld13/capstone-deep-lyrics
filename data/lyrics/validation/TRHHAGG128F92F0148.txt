Well, then I do it
Love not not laughter
I do it do it
Bug flying out of my hands do it do it
Trouble now it's hard to figure out what I did
Here we go

You got a hell of a mouth
You know you got a hell of a mouth
And you know you know you got a hell of a mouth
If you didn't use it

How does it feel so real

Act like a train concealed
I'm movin out
I'm holding my head
I do I did it
Look at my hands
I do I did it
Trouble now here she comes

You got a hell of a mouth
You know you got a hell of a mouth
And you know you know you got a hell of a mouth
If you didn't use it
