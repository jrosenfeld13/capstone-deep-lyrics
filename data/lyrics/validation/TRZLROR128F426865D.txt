[Verse 1]
If you don't eat yourself, no doubt the pain will instead
[?], say it all messed up

[Verse 2]
You went south on the train, she wore plastic boots for rain
And you crawl along exhausted
No sense, no reason

[Chorus]
Who will I be when I'm with you again
Silver jet in the sky
You are the pain, got a song, got to sing
For life

[Verse 3]
If you don't eat yourself, no doubt the pain will instead
If you don't eat yourself, you will explode instead

[Verse 4]
So how can I love you so
When I know you don't love me
[?] say it all, get wicked [?]

[Chorus]
Who will I be when I'm with you again
Silver jet in the sky
You are the pain, got a song, got to sing
For life
