They took my blue suede shoes down to ol' Mobile
Got to rockin' with the rhythm, run 'em over at the hill
Put you cat clothes on
Cause tonight we're gonna really rock it right
Yeah Kitty, put your cat clothes on
Cause tonight we're gonna really bop it right
Well I slicked up myself till I looked like a dilly
I run down town to get my female Billy
Put you cat clothes on
Cause tonight we're gonna really rock it right
Yeah Kitty, put your catclothes on
Cause tonight we're gonna really bop it right

Rock it!

Well my ol' gal's slow and easy, but all the hep cats know
When she gets that rockin' beat
She knocks the polish off her toes
Put you cat clothes on
Cause tonight we're gonna really rock it right
Yeah Kitty, put your cat clothes on
Cause tonight we're gonna really bop it right

Slap cat!

Well now come on cat get with it
Keep your hands off that fruit jar
Do some be-boppin' rhythm, pick your toenails up tomorrow
Put you cat clothes on
Cause tonight we're gonna really rock it right
