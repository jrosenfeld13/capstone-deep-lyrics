[Verse 1]
One man come in the name of love
One man come and go
One man come he to justify
One man to overthrow

[Chorus]
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?

[Verse 2]
One man caught on a barbed wire fence
One man he resist
One man washed up on an empty beach
One man betrayed with a kiss

[Chorus]
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?

[Interlude]
Nothing like love
There's nothing like love
Nobody like you

[Verse 3]
Early morning, April 4
Shot rings out in the Memphis sky
Free at last, they took your life
They could not take your pride

[Chorus]
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?

[Chorus]
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
