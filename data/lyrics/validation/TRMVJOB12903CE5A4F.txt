And everything will come to pass
And it all happened in the dash
I saw the numbers on each side
But all that mattered was the line

When you left so many came
To see the stone they had engraved
It all happened way too fast
It all happened in the dash

And everything will come and go
And we will never really know
Just how much falls in-between
Or we'd say everything will be

But we can't sum up every page
With just one cover and one name
It all happened way too fast
And all we had becomes a dash

And if I had one more chance for us to start things over
Ya know I wouldn't change a thing
And if I had one more chance for us to be together
If I could do it all again, I wouldn't change a thing

And everything will come to be
Another distant memory
Something alone to make you laugh
One for your own epitaph

And in the end what will they say
About your spirit and your name
It all happened way too fast
And all we are becomes a dash

And if I had one more chance for us to start things over
Ya know I wouldn't change a thing
And if I had one more chance for us to be together
If I could do it all again, I wouldn't change a thing

Life is what happens in-between the dreams you're trying to remember
Life is what happens in-between going for your longest breath underwater
Life is what happens in-between the red lights and stop signs
Life is what happens in-between losing your patience on the express line

Life is what happens in-between letting the phone ring and staring at the number
Life is what happens in-between finding out what no one wants to tell ya
Life is what happens in-between staying for the end of your favorite song
Life is what happens in-between wanting to say it, but waiting too long

Life is what happens in-between each fight on the message board
Life is what happens in-between each time I leave for another tour
Life is what happens in-between the holding out for a better spot
Life is what happens when you take a chance and lose what ya got

Life is what happens in-between the traffic stopped to look at the crash
Life is what happens in-between forgetting to hit save and starting from scratch
Life is what happens between agreeing that the year went by so fast
Life is what happens and all we have becomes a dash
