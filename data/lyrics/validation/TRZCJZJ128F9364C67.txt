[Verse 1]
Who's gonna tell you when
It's too late?
Who's gonna tell you things
Aren't so great?

[Chorus]
You can't go on
Thinking nothing's wrong, ohh no
Who's gonna drive you home
Tonight?

[Verse 2]
Who's gonna pick you up
When you fall?
Who's gonna hang it up
When you call?
Who's gonna pay attention
To your dreams?
Who's gonna plug their ears
When you scream?

[Chorus]
You can't go on
Thinking nothing's wrong, ohh no
Who's gonna drive you home
Tonight?

[Verse 3]
Who's gonna hold you down
When you shake?
Who's gonna come around
When you break?

[Chorus]
You can't go on
Thinking nothing's wrong, ohh no
Who's gonna drive you home
Tonight?
You can't go on
Thinking nothing's wrong, ohh no
Who's gonna drive you home
Tonight?
