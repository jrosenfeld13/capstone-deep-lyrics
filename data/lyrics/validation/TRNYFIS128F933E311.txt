The neon light, of the "Open all night"
Was just in time replaced by the magic appearance of a new day-while
A melancholic Reno was crawling on his back just in
Front of the supermarket door-way child

Hey girl, on a cold summernight
As we stood on the corner
As a man passed by and asked us
What we were doing what we need
As he pointed his big fat finger
To the people hangin round at the corner of the - other side of street
Oh well

Doin' nothing, just hanging around
What do you mean doin' nothing Sir
So we had to hit him to the ground
Doin' nothing just hanging around
His head all busted lookin' just a little to wise child

Chorus:
I just can't wait
I just can't wait for saturday night
For saturday night
For saturday night
Saturday night

Bit with solo:
Saturday night
Saturday night
Saturday night

Chorus:
I just can't wait
I just can't wait
