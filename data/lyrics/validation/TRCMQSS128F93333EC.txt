I've gone running from the devil, at times I've beaten down his path
I've seen the fight of the dove and I've stumbled my way back
Miles and miles of interstate, nights not meant to last
I can take this road all the way to Tulsa, but I cannot stop my yearning for you

They say a simple life's the best, but you would never know
The way we complicate this world, lions' king, the lamb lies low
All I wanted was your love, the taste of your sweet kiss
The river may flow deep and wide but I cannot stop my longing for this

So meet me on Red Mountain, lace of laurel, bed of moss
Where the wind's forever howling beneath that Northern Cross

When that final deal goes down I'll gladly pay the cost
If my soul could be a station high upon that northern cross
Then I would have a bird's eye view, I'd watch you night and day
In casting off my mortal self, maybe all this yearning will go away

Oh meet me on Red Mountain, lace of laurel, bed of moss
Where the wind's forever howling beneath that Northern Cross

Old memories have faded, nearly all of them are lost
Except for your face shining beneath that Northern Cross
