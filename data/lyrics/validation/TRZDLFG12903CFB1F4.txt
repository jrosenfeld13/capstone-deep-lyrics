The railroad comes through the middle of the house
The railroad comes through the middle of the house
The trains all come through the middle of the house
Since the company bought the land

They let us live in the front of the house
They let us live in the back
But there ain't no livin' in the middle of the house
'Cause that's the railroad track

When a bill collector comes to the house
He knocks and bangs on the door
So we sit him right down in the middle of the house
And he never comes back no more

The railroad comes through the middle of the house
The railroad comes through the middle of the house
It comes and goes through the middle of the house
And the trains are all on time

Here comes the five-o-nine
Singin' this song in the middle of the house

The railroad comes through the middle of the house
In and out of the middle of the house
Right smack dab through the middle of the house
Where the parlor used to be

There's a great big door in the front of the house
There's a little old door in the back
But we can't have doors in the middle of the house
'Cause that's the railroad track

A relative came to visit the house
He liked to scream and fuss
So we sat him right down in the middle of the house
And he never more bothered us

The railroad comes through the middle of the house
The railroad comes through the middle of the house
It comes and goes through the middle of the house
Since the company bought the land
