Out on the streets i'm a cannibal
Another savage on a string
And on the streets we're invisible
A dead canary never sings

Out on the streets
Where the world is changed
I've seen it for myself
Bilingual roadsigns burnt in my mind
A heritage of doubt

Let's hear it for the sons and the daughters
Of the world forgotten countries
A country dressed up in another's colours
Is a faded lonely light

Let's hear it for the sons and the daughters
Of the world forgotten countries
A country dressed up in another's colours
Is a faded lonely light

Out on the streets i'm a cannibal
Another savage on a string
And on the streets we're invisible
A dead canary never sings

Out on the streets
Where the world is changed
I've seen it for myself
Bilingual roadsigns burnt in my mind
A heritage of doubt

Let's hear it for the sons and the daughters
Of the world forgotten countries
A country dressed up in another's colours
Is a faded lonely light

Let's hear it for the sons and the daughters
Of the world forgotten countries
A country dressed up in another's colours
Is a faded lonely light

We're not we're not we're not moving not moving
We're not we're not we're not breathing not breathing
We're not we're not we're not moving not moving
We're not we're not we're not breathing not breathing

So let's hear it for the sons and the daughters
