(feat. Julee Cruise)

Maybe I'm acting crazy
I feel low and miss my baby
I had you and then I left you
Lord knows I never meant to
'Cause I remember'

'Cause I remember..
(uh, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
The first picture
I remember
(uh, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
The first picture

One million different shadows
Were weeping around the willows
My pillow is as I remember
One tear for every meltdown
'Cause I remember'

3 x
'Cause I remember..
(uh, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
The first picture
I remember
(uh, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
The first picture

'Cause I remember
Come back to me
Love is for free
Come back to me
Love is for free..
