I've got that word, I've got that tune
I've been rehearsing under the moon
But I've got nobody to hear my song
So I'm hummin', hummin' to myself
I've got that word, I've got that tune
I've been rehearsing under the moon
But I've got nobody to hear my song
So I'm hummin', hummin' to myself

I've got the place, I've got the time
I've got a lot of love words that rhyme
But I've got nobody to hear my song
So I'm hummin', hummin' to myself
I've got the place, I've got the time
I've got a lot of love words that rhyme
But I've got nobody to hear my song
So I'm hummin', hummin' to myself

We have a little tune and we always play it for the ladies
[Indistinguishable]
So it goes like this, take four

I've got the place, I've got the time
I've got a lot of love words that rhyme
But I've got nobody to hear my song
So I'm hummin', hummin' to myself

I guess it just had to be
Won't someone come and listen to me
