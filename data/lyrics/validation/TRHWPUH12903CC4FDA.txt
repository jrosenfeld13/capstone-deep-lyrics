Hey

We work for our children, to raise them right
Provide for their days and protect their nights
And pass them on

We try to instruct them about the right ways
And currents of life that can snatch them away
Out of our hands

What will remain?
Only the love
What will remain?
Only the love

We pour out our lives for a legacy
With so little knowledge, we rarely can see
The real world
Devoting our souls to a lofty ideal
In searching for one truth, in all that we feel
That won't turn cold

What will remain?
Only the love
What will remain?
Only the love

It's treasures of the heart, the rose that never fades
The womb where love is born
The fire never dies
The bright, unchanging star
That guides us to the morning

Hey

The issues of love come and cannot cease
They're much more than memories;
They're life and they're peace to all who wait
Anticipate the end of hate and dying

What will remain?
Only the love
What will remain?
Only the love

Only the love
Only love
