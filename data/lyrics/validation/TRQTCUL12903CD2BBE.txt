You want to tell me how to do it
If I shut my eyes real tight I'll get through it
You want to lead me to the water
But I'm not allowed to drink 'till you give the order

Seems like all you thinking about
Is how much louder you can shout
You love to move me to how you want me to be
You love to move me

I'm not really into this kind of thing but...

Hey what's a difference?
It's a funny kind of love but I'll try it once
If it makes you feel it's happening
Then its worth a go to get it on the action

Seems like all you thinking about
Is how much louder you can shout
You love to move me how you want me to be
You love to move me

Move me

You want to tell me how to do it
If I shut my eyes real tight I'll get through it
You love to move me to how you want me to be
You love to move me how you want me to be

Move me how you want me to be
