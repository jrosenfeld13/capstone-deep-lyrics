I was born in this town
My name taken from here
Three sisters and a brother
Who all died before me

When wickedness takes you
Like a child of its own
Nobody will befriend you
Nobody will defend you

I murdered the law here
I took on God here
So in place of your sins I bring you a Judas

So mother, burn my body
For fuel
Oh, mother, burn my body
For fuel

They say I'm a story
But the legend's all wrong
I was forced out of town
But kept in this song

See, it was you who made me
It is you who must take me
Love me or hate me
I'm still your son

So mother, burn my body
For fuel
Oh, mother, burn my body
For fuel
So mother, burn my body
For fuel
