Nobody Knows
When I see the way she looks at him
Hurts so bad, you know it's such a sin
To see her love him while I just walk on by
(Nobody knows) what it does to me
(Nobody knows) no one could ever see
Nobody knows what it does to me
Now those tender looks upon her face
Are meant for someone else who's in my place
And he's her lover the way I used to be
I can see her dancing with someone else
Holding him so close while I'm by myself
I just want to hit him but that won't do
All I know is I've got to find some way
I can get to you
When I see the way she holds his hand
It burns inside me, I can't understand
How could she love him the way she once loved me
Nobody knows
