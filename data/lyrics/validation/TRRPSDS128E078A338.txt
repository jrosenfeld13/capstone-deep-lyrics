[Verse 1]
I don't want to hurt you
For no reason have I but fear
And I ain't guilty of the crimes you accuse me of
But I'm guilty of fear

[Chorus 1]
I'm sorry to remind you
But I'm scared of what we're creating
This life ain't fair
You don't get something for nothing, turn now
Gotta try a little harder
It could be sweet

[Verse 2]
Like a long forgotten dream
And we don't need them
To cast the fate we have
Love don't always shine through

[Chorus 2]
'Cause I don't wanna lose
What we had last time, your leaving this life ain't fair
You don't get something for nothing, turn now
Gotta try a little harder
It could be sweet

[Verse 3]
But the thoughts we try to deny
Take a toll upon our lives
We struggle on in depths of pride
Tangled up in single minds

[Chorus 2]
'Cause I don't wanna lose
What we had last time, your leaving this life ain't fair
You don't get something for nothing, turn now
Gotta try a little harder
'Cause I don't wanna lose
What we had last time, your leaving this life ain't fair
You don't get something for nothing, turn now
Gotta try a little harder
It could be sweet
