[Verse 1]
Uh
Once again I'm here
Once again alone
What is there to fear
When I am in my zone
Chug another beer
Write another poem
So many girls
How am I alone
Ain't got shit left
Make jokes for the stress
But sometimes, I wish that I never had left
Nobody can relate
That's because they don't see below all the hook ups and the drugs
And the friends
And the dates
And the jokes about rape
And the people that I hate
And the poon that I slay
What sport should I play
Is it wrong to be gay
How come it's only March
When will it be May
And then the summer's too short
But somehow it's too long
You can see through her shorts so we're staring at her thong
Roll up the weed
Bada bing, bada bong
Gimme that shit
One hit then I'm gone

[Hook]
Real life
It can get real tight
This doesn't feel right
But we'll try
Yeah
We'll try
We'll try

[Verse 2]
My J. Cole flow
But K. Dot know
Who really run the land where we get no snow
And who really been the man who always drive slow
Cause he always seen the show where the man becomes a ghost
I just pray to God that He stop me
If I ever become too cocky
So I stay humble
Hear the jets rumble
Cause He's always there to recover my fumble
I'm no Happy Feet, I don't mumble
I don't dance
I don't stumble
I'm no Squidward, cause I wumbo
But I've seen tigers in the jungle
There are savages
That are ravishing
Writing passages that say racist things
I own the night so I gotta fight
But my armor's got a thousand chinks

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My arms shake
Another earthquake
I got a toothache but want a milkshake
We all want our cake and eat it too
Wanna make it on the news
Wanna do something cool
Wanna play you as the fool
"What you freaking baby
Did you piss in the pool?"
Now I'm pissed off at you
Wanna throw a fist or two
So we're swinging
Imagine bells ringing
Parents come running
Order they are bringing
So the kids step back
What they hear is yes
They hearing this track
Cause we all caged in like a caged-in match
They wanna break out
But they don't know how
So they take a step back
Try to figure shit out
Cause they still got time
And so do I
But your time ends
It ends with this

[Hook]
