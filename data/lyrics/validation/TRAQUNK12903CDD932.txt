[Intro (Sam I Am)]
"You have you fight for her."
"yeah but I try, I try hard!"
"Try harder."
"No but you don't know, you don't know."
"I don't know what?"
"Yeah you don't know what it's like when you try, and you try
And you try, and you try, but you don't ever get there!"

[Hook]
You can say what you want
You can pose and front
But yo, it don't really matter
You can scream
You can yell
Succeed or fail
But you'll slowly start to shatter
You can fight
You can write
You can piss and gripe
And try to climb up the ladder
But know this, the abyss will swallow
And kiss as you become decomposed matter

[Verse 1]
I don't care
If my record sells
Or if thousands crowd and they yell
I don't care
If the hip-hop heads turn away
And say Pigeon John has turned gay
See I don't care
Workin as an office clerk
To pay rent and to save my sense
And I don't care
If only two people come to my show
I'll still make dents come on
[Hook]
You can say what you want
You can pose and front
But yo, it don't really matter
You can scream
You can yell
Succeed or fail
But you'll slowly start to shatter
You can fight
You can write
You can piss and gripe
And try to climb up the ladder
But know this, the abyss will swallow
And kiss as you become decomposed matter
[Verse two]
I don't mind
Not being known
But being an example that will only be cloned
I don't mind
Being myself
Even if it holds me from possible wealth
See I don't mind
Living true life
And having that peace and the presence of strife
And I don't mind
If it's night or day
Because in the end we will all pass away

All my niggas in jail come sing my song
All my niggas that don't know that Daddy's singing
All my niggas that don't got no money sing along
Sing my song
You like her, she don't like you
Sing it
They don't know
Same old times
Same old times
Gonna be all right
