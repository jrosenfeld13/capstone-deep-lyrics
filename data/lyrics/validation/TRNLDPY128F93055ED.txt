Listen to old John goin' on and on
About his glory days
But then the ball slips through his finger tips
The seconds tick away
That's one football game he'd love to replay

Then there's Ruby Jean, well, she can really sing
But she's stuck in this bar
She thinks some big wheel out of Nashville
Come and make her a star
Who am I to talk? I'm the worst of them all

I'm the king of wasted time
Night after night I spend wishing that you were still mine

Just look at me now with my royal crown
In this place again
I'm still missing you, I'm still wishing you
Would come walking in
And I'd get that second chance of changing my past

I'm the king of wasted time
Night after night I spend wishing that you were still mine

There's no bigger fool than a lonely fool
Yeah, a dreamer who still waits for you

I'm the king of waste time
Night after night I spend wishing if you were still mine

John goes on and on, Ruby sings her song
And you're still gone
