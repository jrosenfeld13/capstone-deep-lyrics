Wake up in the morning, pull myself outta bed
Think about the night before and everything I said
I've made lots of promises I know that I can't keep
So I'll do 'em tomorrow
That seems like a pretty good idea to me
Life is movin' fasterI can feel it everyday
I have trouble keepin' up with what other people say
Big problems in the world, my life's just a social swirl
But I'll do it tomorrow
That seems like a pretty good idea to me
What's wrong with tomorrow?
I'm watchin' him, and who's watchin' me?
Out my window there's nothin' where a city used to be
Phone line dead, the power gone, there's nothin' on TV
Can't understand what happened to all the plans I made
I turn on the radio and hear the signal fade
(It's pretty loud in here...)
But I'll do it tomorrow
Life is moving faster, I can feel it every day
So I'll do it tomorrow
That seems like a pretty good idea to me
What's wrong with tomorrow?

I'm watchin' him, and who's watchin' me?
I'll do it tomorrow
Hope I've got enough time
I'll do it tomorrow
And things'll be fine
I'll do it tomorrow
Can't spare today
I'll do it tomorrow
That'll be okay
I'll do it tomorrow
I'll do it tomorrow
Let's do it tomorrow
I'll stop the clock
Let's do it tomorrow
Talk, talk, talk
Let's do it tomorrow
I'll do it tomorrow
What's wrong with tomorrow
It just goes on now, y'know
I'll do it tomorrow
The money starts rollin' in, yah
