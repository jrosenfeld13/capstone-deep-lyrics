Angels walking in the starlight
People gather at the roadside
I am willing to be with you
Tell me nothing ever leaves you

Love come down
I watched it fall from the sky
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm laughing
The world upon my shoulders
Somehow we gotta march together
A poet sat at his typewriter
We try to live, we try to live

Love came down
I watched it fall from the sky
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Are you almost ready
To come here with me
Is this my lucky day

I was always ready
To be there with you
To going the same way

And the radio plays
Out in the alley way
It's a love song
Yeah, and so tonight
Lovers walking down the highway
In the hope of
Crying to the streetlights, yeah

Love come down
I want you to fall from the sky
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
