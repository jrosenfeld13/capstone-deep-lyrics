To set the stage
To coin a phrase
You really are quite dumb

And so in brief
With great relief
I have to say Im going

But Im not paid enough
To be the one you want
And Im not caned enough
To be the one you love

So dont pretend
To comprehend
In your drunken haze

With that in mind
I think youll find
Youre just a little vague

But Im not paid enough
To be the one you want
And Im not caned enough
To be the one you love
