[Verse 1]
I can see it, I can feel it
Rushing in my veins
I don't like it, I don't hide it
See it in my face
But I don't want to wait
For I have lost my faith

[Chorus]
Why can't I find myself an idol?
Somebody that I can look up to
Be big enough to hold me close in their arms
And never let me down
And all these stupid conversations
That always seem to lead to nowhere
Thery're going round and round and round in my head
And they'll be back again
They're coming back again

[Verse 2]
It's not fair, I still care now
We're always alone
Honesty and modesty
Will never find my home
But I will never say
When I have lost my way

[Chorus]
Why can't I find myself an idol?
Somebody that I can look up to
Be big enough to hold me close in their arms
And never let me down
And all these stupid conversations
That always seem to lead to nowhere
Thery're going round and round and round in my head
And they'll be back again
They're coming back again

[Bridge]
You take it, you take it, you take it
And throw it away
You take it, you take it
And throw it away
But I will never say
When I have lost my way

[Chorus]
Why can't I find myself an idol?
Somebody that I can look up to
Be big enough to hold me close in their arms
And never let me down
And all these stupid conversations
That always seem to lead to nowhere
Thery're going round and round and round in my head
And they'll be back again
They're coming back again
