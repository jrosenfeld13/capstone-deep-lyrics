Son of heaven, the sun of God
A blink from the eternal facade
The ever-spot orb'd polyphony
No epiphany

Tune the universe, be the spine
To stay in place as the planets align
Set to changes, affix to time
No epiphany

Nothing new and nothing old
The chilling warmth of the scorching cold
No way to change how the story is told
No epiphany

Wait for time for a blessed reply
No surprise under the tired eye
Wait to live as I wait to die
No epiphany

Shine as bright in a darkened sky
Won't wait for hope to be regret's disguise
Vibrate alone as I say my goodbyes
No epiphany

See no changes, show no age
Life's a book with a single page
The body spins but I stay the same
No epiphany
