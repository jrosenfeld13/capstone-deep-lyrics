You work all night
And it's really frightening
'Cause you're so ambitious

It's just a habit
That you have to grab it
You're avaricious

I know you'll make it
But I just can't take it
You're so ambitious

Nothing's ever going to make you stop
Not even when you've made it to the top

You're a workaholic
It's so hyperbolic
You're so ambitious

You're so ambitious
You're so ambitious
For the road

You're a finance wizard
A Stock Exchange lizard
'Cause you're so ambitious

Always talking deals
Turning cogs and wheels
You're so ambitious

What has happened to the girl I knew?
When you're rich and famous you'll just say we're through

You want a Rolls-Royce motor

And an eighty-foot boat, oh
You're so ambitious

Your satisfaction
Is a new transaction
'Cause you're so ambitious

Your excitation
Is negotiation
'Cause you're so ambitious

You want a house that's Georgian
And ahead you're forgin'
You're so ambitious

Nothing's ever going to make you stop
Not even when you've made it to the top

You're so ambitious
Am-ambitious
You've got a pinstriped suit
A polka-dot computer
You're so ambitious

Your calculator
It says "see you later"
Its voice sounds vicious

I know you'll make it
But I just can't take it
You're so ambitious

Nothing's ever going to make you stop
Not even when you've made it to the top
