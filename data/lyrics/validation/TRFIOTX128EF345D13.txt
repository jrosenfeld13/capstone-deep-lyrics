Try to make a difference, I'm givin' it up
Leaving me stuck, feeling like I'm all outta luck
It takes me back to my silence baby, its clear cut
Forget common sense ideas and start to deconstruct
I found sanctuary blazin' up the bud with friends around me
Get the balance right and look beyond your country
As I spit words and verbs, attack the learning curve
In the funk style I redress what ya heard
And stop covering up my eyes and sight, my skins gets tight
I hit this undiminished hold, forget what you've been told
They suppress my personality whatever that involves
You know we're cool because we're stable
Trust
No way there's things that you forget to mention
You're not ready
From the way that you speak
Its clear this beat is gonna stop your power bloc war
With the old school flows and the old school beats
Its gonna stop you, you're not ready yeah
Its not hard to admit from the situation that we're faced with
And in principle the problem is in essence basic
Coerced and forced, I'll put the fuckin' force in when I knock you off course
Its your ethics that I question
Boycott the brands that put gain before society
Sick of media defining our reality
I spit words and verbs, attack the learning curve
In the funk style I redress what ya heard
And stop covering up my eyes and sight, my skins gets tight
I hit this undiminished hold, forget what you've been told
They suppress my personality whatever that involves
