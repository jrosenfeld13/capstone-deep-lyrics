(Bob Regan/Chris Lindsey)

I love the way you move
Like moon light on the sea
The way your body calls me
Like a secret melody
The way you start a fire
When you look into my eyes
The way you always love me
Until I'm satisfied

There are moments
When I love you
Beyond the limits of my human heart
I want to hold you
And take care of you
The way the angels watch over the stars
Past the pull of earth
Across the deep blue sky
Through the universe
Beyond the reach of time
You will always be mine

I don't know how you know
Exactly what I need
I don't how you found
The man I wanna be
I don't how your sweet tears
Make me see clear again
I don't how you know
I don't know how you go everywhere I've been

There are moments
When I love you
Beyond the limits of my human heart
I want to hold you
And take care of you
The way the angels watch over the stars
Past the pull of earth
Across the deep blue sky
Through the universe
Beyond the reach of time
You will always be mine

The way you start a fire
When you look into my eyes
Past the pull of earth
Across the deep blue sky
Through the universe
Beyond the reach of time
You will always be mine
Beyond the reach of time
You will always be mine
