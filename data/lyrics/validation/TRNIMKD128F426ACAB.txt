Taking it back
New York Hardcore
Agnostic Front
Let's go!

Take me there, take me back
To before my tomorrows died
To when it was so real and true
To when it was my only care- Take me back!
Take me there to when it started
Take me back to when we ran it

Just take me, just take me
Just take me, take me back!
This is real, this is pure
Go!

Take me, take me back!

Cro-Mags, Warzone, Murphy's Law
Agnostic Front, Sick of it All
CBGB's where it all began
The music, the lifestyle we represent
Demonstrate your style!
