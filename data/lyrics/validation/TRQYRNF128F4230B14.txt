[Chorus]
Lonesome Cowboy Bill
Rides the rodeo
Lonesome Cowboy Bill
You got to see him yodel "Ay-hee-ho!"

[Verse 1]
Lonesome Cowboy Bill
Rides the rodeo
Ever since he was a little lad
Loves the rodeo
Bucking broncs, yeah, sipping wine
You got to see him go
And all the ten-gallon girls
Love to hear him yodel "Ay-hee-ho!
Because

[Chorus]


[Verse 2]
Oh, Lonesome Cowboy Bill
You still ride the rodeo
Up 'round the Colorado shore
Down by the Ohio
Sometimes even New Orleans
Down by the Mardi Gras
And all the ten-gallon girls
Love to hear him yodel "Ay-hee-ho!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You got to see him in the rodeo
When he's ridin', goin' too darn fast
You got to hear the people scream and shout

[Bridge]
They call him
Lonesome Cowboy Bill
He's a
Lonesome Cowboy Bill
He goes...

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I said
You got to see him yodel "Ay-hee-ho!"
Oh he's a Lonesome Cowboy Bill, Lonesome Cowboy Bill...
