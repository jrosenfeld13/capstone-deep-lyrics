Standing on the shore
Waiting for the ship in call
There's something in the way I move that keeps them on their own

The stars explodes a storm
A billion seasons born
A shock to the waves I know, breaking far from shore

Don't want to talk
All I hear is noise
Don't want to talk

The future's in my hands
I hold it in my palms
Engrave it the leylines running right down her arms

Speak in silent tongues
Lies reflect the times
The ghosts and the shadows fill the living scene

Don't want to talk
All I hear is noise
Don't want to talk

Don't want to talk
All I hear is noise
Don't want to talk

Don't want to talk
All I hear is noise
Don't want to talk

Don't want to talk
All I hear is noise
Don't want to talk
