Summon the northern sphere to embrace its wisdom
Bring forth the sole scroll of ethereal black enchantments
Emblazon the scriptures and its devilish incantations
Behold the scorching supremacy in the wake of the infernal names

Ring the bell, turn to the north
Drink the blood; take heed on the voice of the chant
Ring the bell, turn to the south
Drink the blood; take heed on the voice of the present

Summon the southern sphere to embrace its wisdom
Immense emotional horizon shiver, engrave the signs in thy flesh
Devour thine fear; embrace the power of demonic incantation
Dusk shall rise from the north; the abyss shall be the heavens

Summon the eastern sphere to embrace its wisdom
The seed of sinister dimensional abhorrence arises
The rites of passage; an overture of satanic disharmony
Deliverance lies near as from a flick of a razor blade

Ring the bell, turn to the east
Drink the blood; take heed on the voice of the future
Ring the bell, turn to the west
Drink thine blood; take heed on the voice of the past

Summon the western sphere to embrace its wisdom
Fall deeper into the abyss move towards the dark light
One final sacrifice, bloodletting thyself into dim visions
Enslave thyself to the chains of death
