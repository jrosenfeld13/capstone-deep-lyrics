And the fields are turning
And the temperature's are rising
I see the factories are burning
When the wheels keep a turning
Well, I've seen that you've grown now
With the horses you ride
Gonna have your say now
See the new moon rising

Oh, she don't mind, she got the time
I see the new moon rising
Oh, she don't mind, she got the time
I see the new moon rising

See the small town boy now
From a small town family
He's got to find his way now
Gotta find himself a woman
Well, he's scared of the people
He don't wanna be the whipping boy
But the time has come now
Gotta hit the highway

Oh, she don't mind, she got the time
I see the new moon rising
Oh, she don't mind, she got the time
I see the new moon rising
I see the new moon rising
I see the new moon rising

See the new moon rising
When the tides are turning
She got the look of the knowing
She got the feelings to showing
With all that love now
I see the fear returning
I see the new moon rising
I see the new moon rising

Oh, she don't mind, she got the time
I see the new moon rising
Oh, she don't mind, she got the time
I see the new moon rising
