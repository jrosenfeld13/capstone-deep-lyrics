[Intro]
True life true life story
This is a true life a true life story
This is a true life a true life story True life
This is a true life story of a short pretentious man
Decoded in [?] that your short attention span
So I won't bother you with details
I won't bother you with details
Fuck the details

[Verse 1]
I ain't wasting my time waiting in line
Pacing in a basement aging like wine fuck that I'm taking what's mine
Waking up in the morning and working
While you're snoring performing at night
And I'm ready to rock no matter where I'm going
I'm getting love while I'm building my buzz
In two ways giving the five bucks up I make on Tuesdays up
To the homeless to [?] steady blues
Where sources say there's an occasional sighting of Snafu
I wish they sold 40's at the dollar store
So I could have a bad habit that I can afford
I plan on having a cabin with the cash I grabbed on tour
Took a stab at it guess who's not laughing no more
But I, sick with it
Running myself in circles
Watching rappers crack ad girls "You still have curfews?"
I'm in the back of a packed van with guys saying
"Dude it's purple!"
And everyone knows I can't resist a smoke circle

[Hook]
You gotta make yourself get up
You gotta make yourself get up
Get up, and get by
We got money to make time to run for the day
We got classes to take, we got bills to pay
You gotta make yourself get up
You gotta make yourself get up
Get up, and get high
I got nothing to do
Ain't got nothing to lose
I'm just chilling in my comfortable shoes

[Verse 2]
Man hater!
I ain't a misogynist
I love massaging a bitch in exchange for her slobbing my dick
Oh shit, shock rap's out and now emo's in
I'm sorry girl I didn't even know what I was thinking
I just get caught up in my feelings it's so complex
In fact the only way I know how to tell you is abstract
[?] with red flames, lions
Swallowing rabbits holding will work for food signs
My hands are grapevines taped to the floor
Fuck that bitch shit and go represent the hard-core
I'll leave your carcass for maggots today
Until you asshole faggots you can dodge with automatics
Give you matching John Doe toe tags
I'm so bad you motherfucker should know that
Man I'm a keep on doing my thing
And never follow trends so I guess I do it for me
Cmon

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My rhymes are permanent like 9-1'
Imma take it and run
Made it for fun, made up a way to awake or race the sun
It started by smoking too much
Splitting and packing the dust
Light it and pass it around till I pass out and don't wake up
Till like 9 o'clock, I'm like damn it's early
I think I'll sleep in and not realizing it's 9 o'clock PM
I heard there's a sun, I'd really like to see it
I'm tight tight repeated then knife fight get bleeded
World renowned sound now I'm top seeded
Won't bow down to no man out with that [?] keep it
I mean it been needing a reason to slap these heathens [?] far from even Sleep
It's hard to beat him or enjoy to read him our swords the reason
You shouldn't step
Especially when he speaking about his rep
[?] third person no impersonating changing the game by playing at fair and never waiting

[Hook x2]
