Give me silence
No more talking
Give me patience, before I fail
Before my voice fails

Ew delightful oh delightful laborers
When the rattle when the rattle crows
Hunger into poison weed
Eat the rock, eat the rock, a beggar breaks
Before I fail
Before my voice fails

And the children of the flood
The stones, the stones of the church's
Ruins, then the wind will howl
All around

Before I fail
Before before before my voice fails

Before I fail
Before before before my voice
Before my voice fails
The cockleshell and sure
Has a way of knowing
But I'm deaf to his part
But I'm deaf to his heart
