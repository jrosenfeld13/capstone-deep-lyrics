The seasons have turned, the sun is back again
The long nights are over, we have reached the serpent's end

Forget this new God, let the old ones be reborn
We'll hang him on a tree, and crown him with thorns

Our king's beneath a hill, an army by his side
They wait with sword and shield, ready to rise

Our queen is in the moon, the stars and the sky
From a blood red mouth comes a sigh

They said the child was mad, or must be telling lies
For deep in the forest she saw a god with one eye
