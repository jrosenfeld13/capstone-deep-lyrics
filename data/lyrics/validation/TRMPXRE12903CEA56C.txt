Air! In my bones where the marrow should be
But what I lack for guts and blood
I make up for in dreams

Love! And you're wondering how it works
The heart in the natural world
It's a wonder that science can hurt

I am made to fly
You are made for flight
From the structure of our cells
To the chambers we share inside
So let's become like birds
We will become like birds

Hope! It's the one thing that science will prove
What you dont have hope for you lose
Evolution is what you choose

I am made to fly
You are made for flight
From the structure of our cells
To the chambers we share inside
So let's become like birds
Well become like birds

Air! In my bones where the marrow should be
But what I lack for guts and blood
I make up for in dreams
I make up for in dreams
I make up for in dreams
