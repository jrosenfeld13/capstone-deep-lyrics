I finally found a job in the paper
Moving barrels at a chemical plant
There's a shiny-looking dust on my fingers
Going up my nose and into my lungs

[Chorus]
It's the Kepone poisoning - Minamata
It's the Kepone poisoning - Minamata
At the grimy Kepone factory
Turning people into bonsai trees

Now I've got these splitting headaches
I can't quite get it up no more
I can't sleep and it's driving me crazy
I shake all day and I'm seeing double

[Chorus]
It's the Kepone poisoning - Minamata
It's the Kepone poisoning - Minamata
At the grimy Kepone factory
Turning people into bonsai trees

Gonna go down to your big metal building
Gonna slam right through your bright metal door
Gonna grab you by your sta-prest collar
And ram some Kepone down your throat

The lawyer says, "That's the breaks, kid
Gonna gnarl and rot the rest of your life
If you don't sue, we'll give you a Trans-Am..."
That I'll never drive 'cause I shake all the time

[Chorus]
It's the Kepone poisoning - Minamata
It's the Kepone poisoning - Minamata
At the grimy Kepone factory
Oh! Ohhhh!
