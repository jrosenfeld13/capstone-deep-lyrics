Dear God
Protect Us
Come on
Laugh this time

She stares. Forever and then some never again
Polished, Barbwire Smile. Tricks and trade
She's done. So cut her again, gut her again

Dear God
Protect us
Come on
Laugh this...

Silence tells us we're damned. Silence tells us we're damned
Jesus we've gone and done it again. Jimmy's got a new gun in his hand

You're being a liar. You're being a liar. You're being a liar. You're being a liar
How could you doubt? He would never find out
You're being a liar. Let's start the show. You're being a liar. I'm ready to go
You're being a liar. You're being a liar. You're being a liar. You're being a liar
How could you doubt? He would never find out
You're being a liar. Let's start the show. You're being a liar. I'm ready to go
The emperor is dead. The emperor is dead. Goodbye. Don't cry
Die. So long. Revenge. Defend. You know we brought the crowd to us

Staking time into the gust of wind to the face
Never returning, favors take the prison to the man
I could promise the world if we could travel through time
Don't back out here. Now relax and remember the promise of the sign
I wish you could see yourself now...you look at me like a child...
The way you glide across the room, it's drama of seduction
Let go of it, Repunsel. Let it down
Aim for the signal then bring it down with a smile....now...
Become the conductor...
The way you slide across the room...how wonderful
A connection and the last cut still bleeds as good as the first one does
It's just the opening seed of a new flame
I look at you like a child but not at all like you looked at me...

Grace is already dead. Now is the time to go back. Face what you've done
You should never said "Yes"?
Grace is already dead. Now is the time to go back. Face what you've done
Grace is already dead
Grace is already dead. Face the master
You should never have said "Yes"? when you really mean "No"?
