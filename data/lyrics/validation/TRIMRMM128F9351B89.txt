Wake in the morning, we've been talking
About reflections and sitting on a tree
Heard what you said though, moving southward
To apartment by the police

Sun has woken up above and
The beach lies starting at me
Mural of a mountain, stained with beer cans
Honey go there and let me be

Hear them talkin' 'bout me, well
Well I ain't no daughter of thieves, no
I'm just myself
And no one else
Hear them talkin' 'bout me, well
I might date the youngest of three, yeah
But no one cares
The curse has been cured down here, yeah

Down on the curbside, bees and half-light
Screaming "beach house!" from the road
See what you said though, moving southward
To apartment down by the shore

See there are goldmines in these forced drives
While the birds are staring at me
See what you said though, moving southward
To apartment, I better believe

Hear them talkin' 'bout me, well
Well I ain't no daughter of thieves, and
I'm just myself
And no one else
See them talkin' 'bout me, yeah
I might date the youngest of three, but no more
But no one cares
The curse has been cured down here, yeah

Oh, oh love, let's prove them wrong
So time ain't wasted on us
Oh, oh love, let's prove them wrong
See, time ain't wasted on us
No it's not
