I walked the streets of this little town
Late last night when it all shut down
Feelin' stuck between lost and found and nowhere
Using my memory for a map
I went lookin' for a train on the torn up track
Where the weary conductor just turned his back but he's still there

Waitin for the resurrection
Fire from the ashes and the tears
The resurrection
You know dreams die hard, dreams die hard around here

Well it's hard to believe I'm back again
Lookin' up old lovers and long lost friends
Just to reminisce like the veterans and survivors
I heard Reverend Bill with the kind old face
Said he got little stale and he's been replaced
Still we all bowed our heads when he said Grace at the diner

Waitin for the resurrection
Fire from the ashes and the tears
The resurrection
You know dreams die hard, dreams die hard around here

Well the engine dies and the main line fails
Surely the heart and the soul prevails
Like the wild flowers grow between the rails in the summer

Oh, the resurrection
Fire from the ashes and the tears
The resurrection
You know dreams die hard
Dreams die hard
Dreams die hard around here

Oh, the resurrection
Oh, the resurrection

I walked the streets of this little town
Late last night when it all shut down
When it all shut down
