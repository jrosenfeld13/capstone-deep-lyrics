I am young but not for long
I don't know how long im gone
Pick me up, take me back, put me down

I am old but not for long
You told me just sail it home
Pick me up, take me back, put me down
Pick me up, bring me back, and turn me around

Pick me up, take me back, put me down
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
Tell me why, tell me why

I dont know you and you dont know me
Let it go, let it go

I cannot see what you cannot show
I cannot be where you will not go
Let me go, let me go

I dont know you and you dont know me
Let it go, let it go

I cannot see what you cannot show
I cannot be where you will not go
I cannot see what you cannot show
I cannot be where you will not go
Let me go let me go
