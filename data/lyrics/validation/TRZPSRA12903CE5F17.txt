I was sitting on my expectation
Waiting for some validation
I was far away from home
So far from my home
Waiting in a crowded room
Talking with some people whom I'd met before
They were traveling musicians just like me
And I was basking in the comfort of their company
Then there came a knock upon the door
And a tower in my profession
Walked into the room
And people I was talking to
They couldn't leave too soon
And though I should know better
I was star struck and babbled like a loon
I said it's awfully nice to meet you
It's an honor and a pleasure
And you're a national treasure
And I hope we can make some future plans
Then he turned to me and said
Don't be a silly man, don't be a silly man
He said I don't need your worship or your praise
It's a real conversation that I crave
It's a real, it's a real, ooh
We talked about our virtues and our crimes
We talked about the nature of these tenuous times
How our constant search for immortality will always be denied
I said it's awfully nice to meet you
It's an honor and a pleasure
And you're a national treasure
And I hope we can make some plans
Then he turned to me and said
Don't be a silly man, don't be a silly man
I don't need your worship or your praise
It's a real conversation that I crave
It's a real, real, real, real
It's a real conversation that I crave
Don't be a silly man
Don't be a silly man, oh no
It's a real, real, real conversation that I crave
Oh yes, it is, don't be a silly, silly man
