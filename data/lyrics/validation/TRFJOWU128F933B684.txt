I'll see you in a month and maybe we'll talk about everything thats happened from then to now
I'm listening to everything i used to pretent to be
And now i'm hardly aware of everything
And how about yourself?
I'm fine and that's what i've been telling
Everyone else who's wondering why i'm being nice tonight
I'm fine
If i say it this time
Is that what you want to hear?
But then what's left to be said?
"i'm happy" yeild to "i'm fine"
And i'm happy we're safe
