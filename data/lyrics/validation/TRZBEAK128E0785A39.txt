And if you could make up
For every single time you lied
I'd probably whisper this
Hello, goodbye
And so it begins and gets
Harder each and every time
I start to reminisce

I never seem to ever find
Someone I can trust
Someone I believe
Someone who will never try
To bring me to my knees

Someday I will find again
Someone just like me
Someone who will take my time
In understanding me

And if I could make up
For every single tear you've cried
I'd probly never miss
Your hand in mine

I never could understand
Mistakes I repeat again
I've been through this so many times

I never seem to ever find
Someone I can trust
Someone I believe
Someone who will never try
To bring me to my knees

Someday I will find again
Someone just like me
Someone who will take my time
In understanding me

I've stopped searching
To take my time
And to really clear my head
I believe in whats meant to be
And I feel its time to know

And if you could make up
For every single time you lied
I'd probly whisper this

I never seem to ever find
Someone I can trust
Someone I believe
Someone who will never try
To bring me to my knees

Someday I will find again
Someone just like me
Someone who will take my time
In understanding me

Never breath
Never scream
Someone who believes
Never lies to me
And would die for
Me
