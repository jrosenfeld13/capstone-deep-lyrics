I left a camel coat
On the train to idaho
Out on the ninth fairway
And then a chimney dusts it
All in gray

Molly, Molly where you been tonight?
(Molly, Molly where you been tonight?)
Molly, Molly where you been tonight?
(Molly, Molly where you been tonight?)

When she discovered me
She took my matches and my keys
And then she stole my socks
Gave me a room without a view
And flipped the locks

Molly, Molly where you been tonight?
(Molly, Molly where you been tonight?)
Molly, Molly where you been tonight?
(Molly, Molly where you been tonight?)
Molly, Molly stop your lying
Molly, Molly where you been tonight?

When you take your leave of me
Tell the people that you see
In the places where you roam
Someone needs you back at home

I'm gonna count to ten
(One, two, three, four, five...)
And hope your change your mind by then
And then i'll steal your socks
Give you a room without a view
And flip the locks
