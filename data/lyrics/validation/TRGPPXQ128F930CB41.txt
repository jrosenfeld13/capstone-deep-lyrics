She rode the cough felt in the air
Smelled the cops before they cared
Knew the time before wasn't fair
She's the she you'll always be

Hey trouble, I hear you call my name
Hey trouble, I'm coming down again

One black cloud catching all those lights
One bright fire hiding in the night
One real devil blowing through the air
Take my hand and run

(trouble)
Why you sing that song to me
Hold my arm and walk for me
(Hey, trouble)
Take my blood when it ain't time to bleed

Christine haven't I been good to you?
And always done just what you asked me
To
I know you're busy
And you've got a lot of friends
Help me I'm coming down again

I'll do anything for you
Just tell me what you want me to
I'll do anything it's true
Just answer me when I call you

I know you're busy
And you've got a lot of friends
Help me I'm coming down again

Trouble, I hear you call my name
Hey Trouble, It's feeding time again

(trouble)
Why you sing that song to me
Hold my arm and walk for me
(Hey, trouble)
Take my blood when it ain't time to bleed

Trouble, I hear you call my name
(Hey Trouble)
Trouble, I'm coming down again
(Hey Trouble)
I'm coming down again
