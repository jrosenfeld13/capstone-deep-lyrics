Someone's got the stereo close*
The close's know
We go bad taste and touch it
Second side and overcoat
The winter's wet
I'm sweating in your pocket
There's a destination desperate
She's already stocking through
Street lights craving her attention
She can't stay alone it's true
There's no way that I can stay away, away, away, away
Make me see my own again;
I'll miss my friend
I'm acting not so friendly
I'm the one who's in control
Who needs dispose. who knows what won't be showing
There's no way that I could stay away, away, away, away
There's no way that I could stay away, away, away, away
