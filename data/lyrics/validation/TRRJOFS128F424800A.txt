People-watching is one of my
Favourite things to help pass the time
They're all making a deal out of nothing
Decisions to be made, it seems so easy
And they're reading into things without my say-so
And he's sniffing his way to the top
Because the impression he gave was good
And so he stopped, and he stopped to shake my hand
With a smile but I knew he was in denial
Deer-hunting for ideas
