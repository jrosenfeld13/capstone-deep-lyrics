All day I faced the barren waste
Without a taste of water
Cool water
Oh dan and I, with throat's burned dry
And souls that cry for water
Cool clear water
The nights are cool and I'm a fool
Each star's a pool of water
Cool clear water
And with the dawn I'll wake and yawn and
Carry on, to water
Cool clear water
