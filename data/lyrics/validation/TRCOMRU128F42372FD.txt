So you think you've found yourself the girl
You want to spend your life with?
How come that girl's got my eyes and my curls?
And how come I never was asked?
Coz I've been trying desperately to give you all the clues
But if you stay asleep like this it won't be any use
Coz I've been trying desperately to give you all the clues
But if you stay asleep like this it won't be any use

(Chorus)
Coz I'm sorta very slowly getting out
Coz I think I finally know what you're about
Yes I'm sorta very slowly getting out
And I think I finally know what you're about

So you think you've found yourself the girl
Who wants to hear you stories?
They are probably great but you told them too late
And I've got a few of my own
Coz I've been trying desperately to give you all the clues
But if you stay asleep like this it won't be any use
Coz I've been trying desperately to give you all the clues
But if you stay asleep like this it won't be any use

Chorus

Coz I'm sorta very slowly getting out
Coz I'm sorta very slowly getting out
And I think I finally know ...
Coz I'm sorta very slowly getting out
And I think I finally know ...
