If you want me, say it
Don't waste time, don't delay it
If you want me, say it
Don't waste time, don't delay it

Love is in your eyes every time you look at me
No, you can't disguise it, I can clearly see
You want to dance with me all night long
Now you're tying to find a way to say, "Can I take you home"?

If you want me, say it
Don't waste time, don't delay it
If you want me, say it
Don't be shy, don't delay it

If you want me, say it
Don't waste time, don't delay it
It's hard to say you wanna play but that's okay
Yes, I will stay with you for a little while

If you want me say it
Don't waste time, don't delay it

I'm not any different than any other girl
I'm trying to find love too in this big world
Don't think of me as an easy score
'Cause no one has ever made me feel this way before

A woman can lay with any man she wants
It's really up to her whether she do or don't

So if you want me, say it

Don't waste time, don't delay it
If you want me, say it
Don't be shy, don't delay it

If you want me, say it
Don't waste time, don't delay it
It's hard to say you wanna play but that's okay
Yes, I will stay with you for a little while

Don't waste time, don't delay it
If you want me, say it
Don't be shy, don't delay it

If you want me, say it
Don't waste time, don't delay it
If you want me

Yes, I will stay with you for a little while

Don't waste time, don't delay it

Don't waste time, don't delay it

If you want me, say it
Don't waste time, don't delay it
