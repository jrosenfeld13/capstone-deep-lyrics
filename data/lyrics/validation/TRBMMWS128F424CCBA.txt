The tower of sense inside you
Ruined by the hands of lies
Your daylight is already dusk
Feel the dead inside alive

Feeding an invincible master
With all you wanted or did
The only one you respected
Can't remove a coffins lid
Show me a fleshful truth
Behind the blind eyes of your father
You can't 'cos the only truth
Is denying that fuckin' dictator

Skinfather
Larger than lies
Faithfucked believer
Use your own eyes

You are the one putting flesh on his bones
Fuckin' thief of human lives

Skinfather
Larger than lies
Faithfucked believer
