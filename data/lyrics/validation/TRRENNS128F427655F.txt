One day you wake up alone and you think the song is over
All you have now are memories but the song has just begun

[Chorus]
And i'll die someday (ya i'll die someday)
But the song is in my soul and nothing can take that away

So what can we do now?
Your time has come
I guess i really kinda wasn't prepared
But now i've got the wind at my back and there ain't no reason to be scared

[Repeat Chorus]
(woah) long lost life [4x]

So what can we do now?
Your time has come
I guess i really kinda wasn't prepared
But now i've got the wind at my back and there ain't no reason to be scared
And you died that day (ya you died that day)
But the song will survive
We'll always keep it alive

(woah) long lost life [4x]

And you died that day (ya you died that day)
But the song will survive
We'll always keep it alive

(woah) long lost life [4x]

Take out the song, and get me outta town
