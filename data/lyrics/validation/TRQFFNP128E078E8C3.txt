A storm is raging inside my head
The wind is howling such thoughts of death
Why am I so lost and confused?
Can't find the reason for feeling blue
There's so much I can't explain
Hope this season changes soon
. The lightning strikes and the mountains fall
The sea's come crashing against it all

Hang on tight in the tides of change
And get your bearings from those still sane
There's so much I've yet to feel
Hope the seasons change me too

The serpent tangles in the lion's claw
A cloud of darkness hangs over all
As fires soar in search of sky
So blow embers like fire flies
Hoping love is where they'll lie
And the season change us too
