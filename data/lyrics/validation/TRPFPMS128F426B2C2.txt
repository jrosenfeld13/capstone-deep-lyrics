Sunrise
And the new days breakin through
The morning
Of another day without you
And as the hours roll by
No-ones there to see me cry
Except the sunrise
The sunrise and you

Tired eyes drift across the shore
Looking for love and nothing more
But as the sea rolls by
No-ones there to see me cry
Excep the sunrise
The sunrise and you

Sunrise
Bless my eyes
Catch my soul
Make me whole again

Sunrise, new day
Hear my song
Im tired of fightin
And foolin around
But from now on
Till who knows when
My sword will be my pen
And Ill love you, love you
For all of my time
