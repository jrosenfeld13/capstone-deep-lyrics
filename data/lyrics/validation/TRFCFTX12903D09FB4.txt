Pain Patrol

Like hungry wolfs
They pick up your tack
They smell the fear
Creeping down your neck
Straight out of hell
Comes a roaring sound
Heavy metal demons
Run you to the ground

Don't make a sound
Stay on the ground
Don't lose your head
Pretend that you're dead

The pain patrol
Torments your soul

Untransparent shadows
Devouring the light
Silent move delivers
Death from out of sight
Expressionless figures
Stands tall and wait
Your unmoving body
Seal its painful fate

Don't make a sound
Stay on the ground
Don't lose your head
Pretend that you're dead

The pain patrol
Torments your soul
