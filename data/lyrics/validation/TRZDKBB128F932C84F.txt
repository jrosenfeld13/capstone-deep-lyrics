I am a victim of demands
A unit in their quota
A neck within their hands
A scapegoat and a blame
Compressor of the strain
A vent or the penned-up reality

The cleanest man is oh so dirty
You walked on a ground not sturdy
No exception for their written laws
No explanation for their groundless cause

While you were out
Kids were diseasing each other
Brothers were killing their brothers
People decaying in the gutters
While you were out
The world was falling apart
Right before your eyes

You were busy fulfilling orders
Remaining safe inside their borders
Writing tickets to the suspects
While you used the culprit's pen

A reason marked
I am ranked and filed
Should I now attack the innocent child?
Twisted logic
And a faith dispenser
Makes the "us vs. them" wars
Much more tense(r)
