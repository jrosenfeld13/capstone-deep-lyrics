It's 66 and cloudy here this mornin'
I'll make a bet those clouds will turn to rain
The weather's rusted out the sign
And I almost missed the turn
That'll take me down to Saunders Ferry Lane

The creekin' boards of the empty dock
Are the only sounds I hear
The sign on the catfish stand says
"closed till spring"
Summer drown in the frozen lake
As the winter came to life
And nothing moves in Saunders Ferry Lane
Nothing moves in Saunders Ferry Lane

Raindrops mingle with the leaves
That tumble to the ground
As I find my way to the spot
Where we once lay
But the grass is dead
The life is gone
And the birds have flown away
It's awful cold in Saunders Ferry Lane
Awful cold in Saunders Ferry Lane

The gentle arms that held me
And made me want tomorrow now are, are gone
We found so much comfort
In the way we loved each other
Then the angels came
As quietly as the dawn
Standing by the water
In an icy winter wind
I find no present comfort for my pain
No gentle arms to hold me now
I know there's nothin' worse
Than a day alone in Saunders Ferry Lane
A day alone in Saunders Ferry Lane

It's 32, and raining here this evening
I'll make a bet that rain will turn to snow
It's hard to see through the tears
And I almost missed the turn
The easy way from Saunders Ferry Lane
The easy way from Saunders Ferry Lane
