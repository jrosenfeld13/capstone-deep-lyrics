Searchlights
Awake the night
Blasts rip open
Scores of faceless masks

Afterburners
Scorch the charred remains
A shattered dawn
Looms above the waste

Blackened sun
Poisoned hope
Distant dreams
Forever lost

Distorted figures
Crumble to ash
Corroded structures
Dismember the past

Thermal heat
Scorches skin
Vision lost
Another corpse
Falls beneath

Nuclear fires
Blaze through concrete walls
Cities burn
No escape
From this final world

A final collision
Free from pain
Tormented shadows
Remind of the slain

Wasted skies
Bury all hope
A nuclear flash
Consumes the earth
