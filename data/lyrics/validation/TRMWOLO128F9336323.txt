Time heals everything
Tuesday, Thursday
Time heals everything
April, August

If I'm patient the break will mend
And one fine morning the hurt will end

So make the moments fly
Autumn, winter
I'll forget you by
Next year, some year

Though it's hell that I'm going through
Some Tuesday, Thursday, April, August
Autumn, winter, next year, some year
Time heals everything, time heals everything
But loving you

Though it's hell that I'm going through
Some Tuesday, Thursday, April, August
Autumn, winter, next year, some year
Time heals everything, time heals everything
But loving you
