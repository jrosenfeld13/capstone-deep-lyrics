Sister your time has come
Got to lay it down
Got to get things done
But you're looking so hard
And you just can't see
Trying so hard dragging on me
I'll tell you something baby
I'll tell you what I know
It's oh so cold - do what you're told
It's hard when they're telling you no
I said it's oh so cold - do what you're told
With all the lies that they hold
Inside their hands
Mother, got to lay it down
To be number one
On this side of town
But, you're looking so hard
You just can't see
Trying so hard dragging on me
I'll tell you something baby
I'll tell what I know
It's oh so cold - do what you're told
With all the lies that they hold
Inside their hands
Stop those lies
Just don't see
Stop those lies
Get away from me
It's oh so cold - do what you're told
It's hard when they're telling you no
I said it's oh so cold - do what you're told
With all the lies that they hold
Inside their hands
