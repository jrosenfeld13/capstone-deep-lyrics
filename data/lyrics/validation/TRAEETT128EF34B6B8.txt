It's not you and it's not me
It's a feeling now and then
It's not you and it's not me

To your face
I find it hard to say
A word about your ways
That's okay
Your smile
The bravest face of all

Look your eyes
Are trying to pin me down
Save me from myself
I won't see you
Your smile
The bravest face of all
I don't care for it at all

It's not you and it's not me
It's a feeling now and then
It's not you and it's not me

Warmth
And smiles
As we follow this old game
And we're looking through windows
The colour of wine
And second by second
They close
Leaving me behind

It's not you and it's not me
It's a feeling now and then
It's not you and it's not me

It's not you and it's not me
It's a feeling now and then
It's not you and it's not me

Here am I
Dressed in my bravest face
Same time
Same place
Week in
Week out
I can't give you any more somehow
The goal to mention
You know my susceptible mind
And unwind
Unlock my defenses
And I'll be here
Dressed in a brave face
Your choice
Same time
Same place
Next week
