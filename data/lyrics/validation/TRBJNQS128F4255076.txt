An elemental kind of rhapsody
A paper or a pen
A movie that was never meant to end
The kind of silence that will drown you out
The beating of the air
A mystery in need of no repair
Suddenly
You beside of me
Left alone
Turn up the radio
Was it a fatalistic cameo, to show up in a dress?
My reaction was mental I confess
And all the shadows of your funny eyes
Were made for you to stare
I'm glad it was a casual affair
Suddenly
You beside of me
Left alone
Turn up the radio
Hey you
Feel me
Was it worth an apology?
Someday
You'll see
That it's
Not a democrazy
Someday
You'll see
Believe me
Someday
You'll see
Believe me
Someday
You'll see
That it's
Not a democrazy
Suddenly
You beside of me
Left alone
Turn up the radio
Suddenly
You beside of me
Left alone
Turn up the radio
