Sign a petition under working condition
Union is in bed with the call of Berettas
Carry our freedom lookin' for something
To give your family a better life for every single day
Somethings keep me goin'
Well, I got no one to blame
Five o'clock is comin', do ya feel the same
When a lonely whistle calls out your name
What a man likes to see
When they come after mine
No prettiness for the mighty black lung
Reconfirm workers, reconfirm us
So take off the gloves and sock it to 'em
Somethings keep me goin'
Well, I've got no one to blame
Five o'clock is comin,' do you feel the same
When a lonely whistle calls out your name
Hey young believer, black lung fever
Transmit receiver, stand up to see her
I don't like it you either
Were all prejudice to the black lung fever, oh
Somethings keep me goin'
Well, I've got no one to blame
Five o'clock is comin', do ya feel the same
When a lonely whistle calls out your name
