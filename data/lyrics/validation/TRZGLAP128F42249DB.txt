Hello can you hear me
Please don't go
Where are you going
Conversations go over my head
Isolation has an ugly face

Surround me with your love
Understand me I need you now
Surround me with your words
Understand me I need your love

I need your love I need your love

Hello I'm so lonely
And it feels like a disease
Come and stay stay beside me
Stay always, forever don't go

Surround me with your love
Understand me, I need you now
Surround me with your words
Understand me, I need your love
