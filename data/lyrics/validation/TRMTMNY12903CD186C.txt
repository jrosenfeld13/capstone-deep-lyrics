I can tell we don't belong
By the way you look in my eyes
I can bet you moved right on
Baby cause I'm just another good bye
I can tell it's over now before you ever said a word to me
You can take a final bow honey cause your act is like a 3rd degree
Whoa, you've struck the last match with me baby
You've got me burning
What did I do to deserve this burning
You bring me down when I'm all I've got
I never know cause my mind keeps turning
Why oh why
You're only happy when I'm not
I can tell thats somethings wrong
By the way you look in my eyes
I can bet the warmth is gone
Cause honey your stare is like the black ice
Cause you lit this fire
What did I do to deserve this burning
You bring me down when I'm all I've got
I never know cause my mind keeps turning
Why oh why
You're only happy when I'm not
You've got me burning
You've got me burning baby
What did I do to deserve this burning
You bring me down when I'm all I've got
I never know cause my mind keeps turning
Why oh why
You're only happy when I'm not
