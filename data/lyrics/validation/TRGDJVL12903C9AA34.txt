[Verse 1]
Hope unknown. Sometimes just waking is surreal
I walk right through the nameless ones
I know that hope's unknown
Sometimes the water feels so real
As I walk through it fills my lungs, my god, I'm drowning

[Chorus]
This day never seems to end
This pain, never
This rage I can not let go
I hear them calling
I feel them gnawing out holes through flawless souls

[Verse 2]
So alone. Sometimes I swear that I can hear the taunting of the voiceless ones
I fear that I alone fear those ceased to feel they're alone inside of this place
I am the misplaced
Now every face, it looks familiar
Then every face would melt away until
Now everyone, do you know, I know your deception

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Now every face, it looks familiar
Then every face would melt away until
Now everyone, do you know, I know your deception

[Chorus]
