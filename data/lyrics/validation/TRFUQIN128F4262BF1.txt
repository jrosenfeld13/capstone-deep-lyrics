Try to say
You love some one
Its hard to say you dont
Its hard to learn
To try to trust someone
Its hard to be without

So if u think u love some one
Try, try, try
Because
That one maybe your one

So if you love her
Think only of her
Take the time tell her today

And if Without her
Everything is harder
Take the time
Drop everything
Go tell her today

If for every king
You find a queen
The Key keeps them strong

Oh if love is a ? that beats my heart
Then maybe
Sweet baby
?right now

Oh
So if you think you love some one
Try, try, try
Because that one may be your one
So if you love her
Think only of her
Take the time tell her today

And when with out her
Everythings harder
Take the time
Drop everything
Tell her today

[Chorus To fade]
