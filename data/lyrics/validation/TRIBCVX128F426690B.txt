Candlelight and romance, and a black-and-white movie
Makes me wanna treat her like a lady
A touch of her emotions and the way she looks through me
Makes me wanna treat her like a lady, oh yeah

Well, she's mine, my girl
And I never wanna be a minute without her in my life
She's a lady, a lady to me
My lady

Feelings of desire in the way that she kisses
Makes me wanna treat her like a lady, yeah
And just to think she needs me, I'm the one that she misses
Makes me wanna treat her like a lady, lady

Well, she's my whole world
And I never wanna be a minute without her in my life
She's a lady, she's a lady
And to think about life without her is crazy to me

Time is all I need to prove my love for her lives
Yeah, yes indeed
And all I want when I look in the mirror as my life goes on
Is at every beat, she's a lady
And I never wanna be just a memory to her
She's a lady, she's a lady
And to think about life without her is crazy, crazy to me
(Treat her like a lady) Oh, treat her like a lady
She's my love, my life, my hopes and my dreams
Oh, treat her like a lady
She's been so good to me (she's a lady)
Gotta treat her like, treat her like a lady
My, my, my baby, gotta treat her like a lady
She's my lady, treat her like, my, my, my baby
Gotta treat her like a lady
(Treat her like a lady) Oh, my, my, my baby, she's my lady
