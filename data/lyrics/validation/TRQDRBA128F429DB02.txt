[Hook]
Mr. Marley, them know your name
Ragamuffin Mr. Marley in the Hall of Fame
Mr. Marley, them know your name
Ragamuffin Mr. Marley in the Hall of Fame

[Verse 1]
With the forklift on the night shift on the Zion Train
Babylon by bus or Babylon by plane
When the race gets hard to run around run all through your vein
Whether the confrontation or the uprising
All nation a bow just to hear him sing, say

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
When the music hit you, you no feel no pain
In Mt. Zion is where he live and reign
He said, "I don't wanna, I don't wanna wait in vain"
Chase those crazy bald head then from off of the lane
Guide a lot of people out of sorrow and shame

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Everyman have the right to decide his own destiny
And in his judgment there is no partiality
So don't you think that you are better cause you gwan boasty
I've got to keep on moving so them can't hold me
Di man shot the sheriff and him spare the deputy

[Hook]

[Verse 1 repeated]
With the forklift on the night shift on the Zion Train
Babylon by bus or Babylon by plane
When the race gets hard to run di blood run all through your vein
Whether the confrontation or the uprising
All nation a bow just to hear him sing, say

[Hook X2]
