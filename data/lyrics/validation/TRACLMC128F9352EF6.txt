[Verse 1]
It's been a while since I've seen you
I'm trying to not offend you
I count the days as they go by
Since I phoned you and said good bye
You gave me roses just to show me
How much you love and adore me
You know you didn't have to do that
Because with you, it's this and/or that

I'm thinking of a way cause I know you never listen
Why don't you ever listen?

[Hook]
Tearin' down the house, tearin' down the house, tearin' down the house
Girl, you never listen
Tearin' down the house, tearin' down the house, tearin' down the house
You don't know what you're missin'
And now your roses don't mean a thing
You're tearing down the house

[Verse 2]
The good times are a reminder
Of how much I really like her (tearin' down the house)
I wish that I could see her right now
But we're just tearin down the house now

I'm thinking of a way cause I know you never listen
Why don't you ever listen?

[Hook]

With a bit of common sense
And more consideration
You'd know exactly not what to do
I'm thinking of a way cause I know you never listen
Why don't you ever listen?

Tearin' down the house, tearin' down the house, tearin' down the house
Girl, you never listen
Tearin' down the house, tearin' down the house, tearin' down the house
You don't know what you're missin'
Tearin' down the house, tearin' down the house, tearin' down the house
Girl, you never listen
Tearin' down the house, tearin' down the house, tearin' down the house
Now your roses don't mean a thing
You don't know what you're missin'

[Small Break]

And now your roses don't mean a thing
