I get the feeling that beneath the little halo on your noble head
There lies a thought or two the devil might be interested to know
You're like the finish of a novel that I'll finally have to take to bed
You fascinate me so

I feel like Christopher Columbus when I'm near enough to contemplate
The sweet geography descending from your eyebrow to your toe
The possibilities are more than I can possibly enumerate
That's why you fascinate me so

So sermonize and preach to me
Make your sanctimonious little speech to me

But, oh, my darling, you'll forgive my inability to concentrate
I think I'm dealing with a powder keg that's just about to blow
Will the end result deflate me or will you annihilate me?
You fascinate me, you irritate me, you fascinate me so

So sermonize and preach to me
Make your sanctimonious little speech to me

But, oh, my darling, you'll forgive my inability to concentrate
I think I'm dealing with a powder keg that's just about to blow
Will the end result deflate me or will you annihilate me?
You fascinate me, you irritate me, you fascinate me so
So, so
