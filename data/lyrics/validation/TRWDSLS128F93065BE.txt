I feel my temperature rising for you
From ninety-eight to a thousand and two
I feel my temperature
No need for doctors
I know you got what it takes, love
To keep the pressure up
No need to slow or stop
Go

I can show you colors that never existed
Show you I've got substance

I'll give you everything you need, my love
I show you all you need to know
I've never felt this way about someone
Whoa, oh, oh

I feel my temperature rising for you
There's just no way to describe it
It's true
I need your medical attention
Fix me up and turn me on, love
Go grab a scalpel
Could cut me open
Go

I can show you colors that never existed
Show you I've got substance

[Repeat]
I'll give you everything you need, my love
I show you all you need to know
I've never felt this way about someone
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

I'll give you everything you need, my love
I show you all you need to know
I've never felt this way about someone
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

Grab the paddles
He's a goner

I can show you colors that never existed
Show you I've got substance
(I feel my temperature rising)

I'll give you everything you need, my love
I'll show you all you need to know
I've never felt this way about someone, whoa
And I hope you know
I'll give you everything you need, my love
I'll show you all you need to know
I've never felt this way about someone
Whoa
