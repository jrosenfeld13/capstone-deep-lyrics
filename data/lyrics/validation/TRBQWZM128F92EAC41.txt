[Verse 1]
I'm a fish out of water
Kill me and choke on the bones
Nothing seems to matter anymore
Gotta get back to the reason
Gotta get back to the hole
Someone throw me an anchor
Gotta drown this disease
No one seems to matter anymore
Gotta get back to the meaning
Gotta get back to the score

[Chorus]
Buy my soul, so you can sell me
I don't need this, I don't need you
Trust your lies, then you betray me
I don't want this, I don't want you

[Verse 2]
Up the creek with no paddle
Through the oars overboard
No one seems to carry at all anymore
Gotta get back to the meaning
Gonna break backs of the poor
Let me tell you a secret
So you can tattle and leave
No one holds to their honesty anymore
Gotta get back to the stealing
Gotta take back from the hoard

[Chorus]
Buy my soul, so you can sell me
I don't need this, I don't need you
Trust your lies, then you betray me
I don't want this, I don't want you

[Bridge]
I don't want to change
Who do you wanna be, the summit of integrity
Or the bottom, the filth, the dichotomy
All these fallen angels
Skeletons of what they once were
Hanging in the closet for the world to see
Another fallen angel
Faced by demons on their judgment
Hanging from the gallows for us all to see it

[Chorus]
Buy my soul, so you can sell me
I don't need this, I don't need you
Trust your lies, then you betray me
I don't want this, I don't want you
