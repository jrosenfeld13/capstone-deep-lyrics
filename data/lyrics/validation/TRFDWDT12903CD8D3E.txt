Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corn cob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say
He was made of snow, but the children know
That he came to life one day
There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head, he began to dance around
Frosty the snowman was as live as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said 'Let's run and have some fun, now
Before I melt away.'
Down to the village with a broom stick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying, 'Catch me if you can!'
He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop
He only paused a moment when they heard him holler, 'Stop!'
Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye saying, 'Don't you cry
I'll be back again, someday.'
Frosty the snowman was as live as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said 'Let's run and have some fun, now
Before I melt away.'
