When will I get my chance to make the lilacs bloom?
To decorate the tomb with petals from the groom?
Who cried "the circumstance could never be assumed"?
It's hard to say, it's hard to say

When will I get my chance to burn the shoulders of
The women and the men who dance when they're in love
Who give into romance like hands give into gloves?
It's hard to say, it's hard to say

When will I get my chance to watch autumn leaves fall?
To make babies crawl to windowsills and all
To watch the colors change?
And some children are so strange
Some children are so strange

When will I get my chance to watch autumn leaves fall?
To make babies crawl to windowsills and all
To watch the colors change?
And some children are so strange
Some children are so strange

When will I get my chance to put you in a trance?
A-watchin all the snow that's fallin'
Even though it never lets you down
Never makes a sound

It's hard to say, it's hard to say
