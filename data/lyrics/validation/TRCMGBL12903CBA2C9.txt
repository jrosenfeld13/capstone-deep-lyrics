I lost my way, I did so much wrong
God, I need a friend to help me get along
I need my baby, gotta get her back
I need lady luck to get her from where I'm at

Gotta make it rain, million dolla baby
Make it rain, million dolla baby
Make it rain, million dolla baby
Luck be a lady, luck be a lady tonight

I lost my soul out on that road
Sat in the darkness, ain't leading me home
I need my baby, my lover, my muse
Hold onto me baby, don't let my hand go

Gotta make it rain, million dolla baby
Make it rain, million dolla baby
Make it rain, million dolla baby
Luck be a lady, luck be a lady tonight

Got me singing, yeah, yeah, hoo

I'm hot at the tables, I'm seven-eleven
I'm playin' for hours, I'm bettin' on even
The waitress is rockin'
I need some more deuce please now

I'm doubling up, I have money to spend
And I look at the dealer, thinking, "Should I hit?"
And I'm shaking my hands
And I could see you bet good now

Make it rain, million dolla baby
Make it rain, million dolla baby
Make it rain, million dolla baby
Luck be a lady, luck be a lady tonigh
