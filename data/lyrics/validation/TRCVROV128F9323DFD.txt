What you want is a little piece of my love
Come on and get it
Come a little closer
A little closer
You won't regret it
Come on baby baby
Shake your tree tonight
Oh, it's what you wanna do
You know baby you want my love
I gotta give it to you

Hey, baby, now what she said
Freeze Sucker, you move and you're dead
Hey, baby, now what she said
Freeze Sucker, you move and you're dead

Lady Luck
Gimme your stuff
On that dance floor
Come a little colser
A little closer
Oh, you know
I want you more and more
Come on baby baby
Shake your tree tonight
Oh, it's whatyou wanna do
You know baby you want my love
I gotta igve it to you

Hey, baby, now what she said
Freeze Sucker, you move and you're dead
Hey, baby, now what she said
Freeze Sucker, you move and you're dead
You, You and me we take a ride
On a rocketship
