Eye on the crowd, baby
Looking for someone to satisfy my need
Someway or somehow
Gonna find someone to spend some time with me

Well I ain't looking at forever
Just a woman to treat a good man right
You look so good you got me thinking
You might satisfy my soul tonight

There's no harm done
I know you're the one
You don't have to worry
No hurry
The night's still young
I'm just looking for some good clean fun

I ain't looking for a woman
Who's always trying to put me down
I don't want nobody
Giving me that same old run around

I ain't leaving, I'm just leaning
And I'm looking for that good time thing
And I could tell by the way you're acting
Girl, you know exactly what I'm thinking

There's no harm done
I know you're the one
You don't have to worry
No hurry
The night's still young
I'm just looking for some good clean fun

Don't want to slow down, don't want to move too slow
I am so confused, I don't know what to do
So please don't think I'm moving in for the kill
If you don't want to love me somebody else will

Don't want to slow down, don't want to move too slow
I am so confused, I don't know what to do
So please don't think I'm moving in for the kill
But if you don't want to love me somebody else will

No harm done
I know you're the one
You don't have to worry
No hurry
The night's still young
I'm just looking for some good clean fun
Looking for some
Oh, baby
Looking for some good clean fun
Looking for some"
