Ahhhh
We've been so caught up in the subject first again
Playing and laughing and slaving and begging our friend
Who lies and to try to cut off our heads like we were
Painting our picture to show everyone in the world
Show them

Killing is natural
The legs and faces can break
We're not superiors
Hiding behind the grey paint
Who lies and to try to cut off our heads like we were
Painting our picture to show everyone in the world

Ahhhh
Ahhhh
Ahhhh
Ahhhhhhhhhh
Woo woo woo woo woo woo
