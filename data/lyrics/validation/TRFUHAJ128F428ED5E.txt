Dances on top a pile of excess
It's a good time until you breathe
Breathless assures my sign of sickness
Swim past the tide, sail out to sea

Cause I wanna know, cause this is hardly worth going for
A long time ago when there was something left to uphold

Last time I'll have to explain my withdrawal

Forces around the point of entry
Will avert the eyes so you can scream
Ship me, forever barred from entering
We'll hold up the signs of apathy

Cause I wanna know, cause this is hardly worth going for
A long time ago when there was something left to uphold

Last time I'll have to explain my withdrawal
