I can't change
The way we live today
It's just a matter of exceptance anyway
I can't change
The pain we have to face
All our worries in time will fade away

In time will fade away (repeats)

I can't change
How people think today
Maybe it's better
There's nothing left to say
I don't care
How people think today
Maybe it's better
There's nothing left to say

There's nothing left to say (repeats)

I don't care
About the way we live today
I'm just a part of the game we have to play
I don't care
What people have to say
All our worries in time will fade away

I can't change
How people think today
Maybe it's better
There's nothing left to say
I don't care
How people think today
Maybe it's better
There's nothing left to say

There's nothing left to say (repeats)
