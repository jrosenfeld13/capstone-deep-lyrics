[Verse 1]
Baby, you pretend that things ain't what they seem
All this tension telling just exactly what we should be
Now I don't mind us bein' some kind of casual thing
Listen, all I want to do for now is have you come and take all of me

[Chorus]
Can you put your hands on my waistline?
Want your skin up against mine
Move my hips to the baseline
Let me get mine, you get yours
Hang a 'please don't disturb' sign
Put my back into a slow grind
Sending chills up and down my spine
Let me get mine, you get yours

[Verse 2]
If you see me with a man, understand that you can't question me
The feelings that you caught ain't my fault
Can't help your jealousy
If you can handle the fact
That what we have has got to be commitment free
Then we can keep this undercover lovin' comin'
Hidden underneath the sheets

[Chorus]
Can you put your hands on my waistline?
Want your skin up against mine
Move my hips to the baseline
Let me get mine, you get yours (we don't fall in love)
Hang a 'please don't disturb' sign
Put my back into a slow grind
Sending chills up and down my spine
Let me get mine, you get yours

[Bridge]
Now listen, so, come on and freak my body
We can get nasty, naughty all night, a private party
Gotta hit that spot just right, work me like a nine to five
It ain't about the kissin' and huggin'
'Cause this is a physical lovin'
Straight sweatin', our bodies are rubbin'
Gotta hit that spot just right, work me like a nine to five

[Spoken]
We have a physical thing
We make love, but don't fall in love
Let me get mine, you get yours
We spend time just enough so you get yours, and I get mine
No strings attached
I want your body, not your heart
Let me get mine, you get yours

[Chorus]
Can you put your hands on my waistline?
Want your skin up against mine
Move my hips to the baseline
Let me get mine, you get yours (we don't fall in love)
Hang a 'please don't disturb' sign
Put my back into a slow grind
Sending chills up and down my spine
Let me get mine, you get yours
Put your hands on my waistline
(Put your hands on my waistline)
Want your skin up against mine
Move my hips to the baseline
Let me get mine, you get yours (we don't fall in love)
Hang a 'please don't disturb' sign
Put my back into a slow grind
Sending chills up and down my spine
Let me get mine, you get yours

[Outro]
Come here
Don't be shy, I won't bite
Let me get mine, you get yours
