Realize you're dehumanized
You criticize your existence
It's your demise when no sun arise
When you're paralyzed by your lack of resistance

[Chorus]
She knows she is, she knows she's going
Down below where the fire's glowing
Tenderloin, Tenderloin, Tenderloin

The tricks she gets them
She's not a victim
She makes a list of them and reads them all alone
For money she's walking down on Larkin
In TL they're rocking all night long
