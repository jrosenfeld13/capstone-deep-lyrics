Don't stop the music
We just gotta move
We missed a few cities, now
We gotta put 'em in the groove

Home in Chicago
(Chicago)
Whoa, you're really jumpin'
Down in Baltimore
(Baltimore)
Tell me you're Foot Stompin'

People are really rockin' (rockin')
In Nashville, Tennessee
(Hip City!)
You wanna be in the groove, boy
You gotta come on with me
(Where?)

Clarksville, Mississippi
Into Kansas City, town
(Hip City)
Get them hip shakin', now
Yeah!
And what they're puttin' down
Hey!

You oughta see 'em, h'uh
They move it
You oughta be with 'em
They groove it

You don't feel a thing
In yo' feet
You gotta move yo' hips
With that beat

You gotta feel it, now

Ay-yeah-yeah!
You gotta Fly high
Ooo, ah-ah-ah
You-ah-ah-ah

Ooo-ah-hey!

Crowd clapping

Hey, bring it on back, now
Yeah, we gotta move, St. Lou
Chicks down there, now
They got the Boog-a-Loo

Now, when it comes to dancin'
Marv, just had it wrong
New York, Hip City
(Hip City)
Is the King of 'em all

A-look-a-here:

Don't put Detroit down
(No, never!)
It's the home of the Motown Sound
(Yeah, yeah!)

You've gotta feel it
(We feel it!)
You've gotta groove
(We're movin')

Gotta move it, now

Feel it in your bones, boy
(We feel)

Gotta blow my horn
(Blow your horn, yeah!)
