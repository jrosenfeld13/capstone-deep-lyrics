[Verse 1]
There she was... laughin', talkin', window shopping with a new guy
An' I'd heard about him... I heard she found him right around when we said goodbye
And I came real close and almost lost my temper
But I bit my tongue, kept my cool, 'cause I remembered

[Chorus]
I don't care, she don't matter
I don't love her anymore, he can have her
I don't know why it slips my mind, I tell myself all the time
Guess I forgot again, for a second there, that I don't care

[Verse 2]
Almost 10:00... should've known his car would still be parked in her drive
Almost pulled in... knocked on her door and gave her a piece of my mind
Oh, but I just kept on drivin' back to my place
Wonderin' why I went so far out of my way, when...

[Chorus]
I don't care, she don't matter
I don't love her anymore, he can have her
I don't know why it slips my mind, I tell myself all the time
Guess I forgot again, for a second there, that I don't care

[Bridge]
I got home the light was blinkin' on that old machine
She said, "My brother's been in town, but he just left, and I miss you. Give me a ring"

[Chorus]
I still care, she's all that matters
I still love her just like always, gotta have her
I never got her off my mind, been hopin' she would call sometime
I know it's late, to be drivin' over there, but I don't care
I don't care
