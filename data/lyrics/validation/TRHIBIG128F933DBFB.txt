If I had a hammer I'd hammer in the morning
I'd hammer in the evening all over this land
I'd hammer out danger I'd hammer out a warning
I'd hammer out love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land

Well if I had a bell I would ring it in the morning
And I would ring it in the evening all over this land
I'd ring out danger I'd ring out a warning
I'd ring out love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land

Now if I had a song I would sing it in the morning

I would sing it in the evening all over this land
I'd sing out danger I'd sing out a warning
I'd sing out love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land

Well I've got a hammer and I've got a bell
And I've got a song to sing all over this land
It's a hammer of justice it's a bell of freedom
It's a song about love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land
All over this land
