[Intro]
Hey hey
Hey hey

[Verse 1]
I was hell
Sarcastic silver swell
That day it rained
Tough spun. Hard won. No
Ocean flower aquarium
Badlands. Give a hand
Honey dip, flim flam
Hey hey, hey hey
That cat can walk like a big bad man

[Chorus]
So happy to show us
I ate the lotus
Say haven't you noticed?
I ate the lotus

[Verse 2]
Storefront window, I reflect
Just last week I was merely heck
Tip the scale, I was hell
It picked me up, then I fell
Who's this stranger?
Crowbar spine
Dot, dot, dot, and I feel fine
Let it rain, rain, rain
Bring my happy back again

[Chorus]
So happy to show us
I ate the lotus
Say haven't you noticed?
I ate the lotus
I ate the lotus

[Verse 3]
Let it rain, rain, rain
Save me from myself again
Wash away my ugly sins
Opposing thumb, dorsal fin
That monkey died for my grin
Bring my happy back again
Let it rain, rain, rain
Bring my happy back again

[Chorus]
So happy to show us
I ate the lotus
Say haven't you noticed?
I ate the lotus
I ate the lotus
I ate the lotus
I ate the lotus
