Sit around, dream away the place I'm from
Used to feel so much, now I just feel numb
Could go out tonight, but I ain't sure what for
Call a friend or two I don't know anymore

Sit and listen to the rain
Sit and listen to the rain

Gonna ride down to the river where it runs
Gonna watch TV and pray for decent reruns
Sit around and dream away what I've become
Used to feel so much, now I just feel dumb

Sit and listen to the rain
Sit and listen to the rain

I'll never understand this emptiness
I'll never really try and understand, I guess
I'll never understand this emptiness
I'll never really try and understand
Try and understand, I guess

Sit around, dream away the place I'm from
Used to feel so much, now I just feel dumb
Could go out tonight, but I ain't sure what for
Call a friend or two I don't know anymore

Sit and listen to the rain
Sit and listen to the rain
