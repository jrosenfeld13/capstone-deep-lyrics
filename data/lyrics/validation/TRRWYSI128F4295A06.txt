Into the coloured field of view
My eyes are on the toe line
Into another space and now
It's clear that I will soon be found

And this is the first time that it's made vague sense
So into the coloured field of view
My eyes are on the go line
Into another place and time
It's clear that I will soon be fine

And maybe somehow I can see it through
So into the coloured field of view
My eyes are on the phone line
Into another space and now
It's clear that I will soon be found

This is the first time that it's made vague sense
Maybe this time I can see it through
So into the coloured field of view
My eyes are on the toe line
Into another space and now
It's clear that I will soon be found

It's clear that I will soon be found
It's clear that I will soon be found
