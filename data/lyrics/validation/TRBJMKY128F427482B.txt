'Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome Mr. Georgie Fame'

(applause)

Jumpin' with my boy, Sid, in the city
Jumpin' with my boy, Sid, in the city
Mr. President of the DJ committee
We're gonna be up all night gettin' with it

Want you to spin the sounds that are with it
From down in the land that's real, real pretty
Make everything go real crazy over Jersey
Make everything go real crazy over Jersey
(Woo!)

Make everything cool for me an' my baby
We don't wanna think we're listenin' lazy
Gotta be Pressburg cheerin' all the Basie
The dial is all set right though for 8-0
Let it roll

If you tune in to your radio
You hear Moreno clear
Spinnin' your favourite tracks
Johnny Griffin's tenor sax
And all around Manhattan, all the cat's are jumpin'
With Symphony Sid

So tighten your wig
Come out in the boon, dig!
He's Symphony Sid
He's got the power to make you swing
He's the King
Ding, dong, ding

Ain't a-callin' him
Down or in a square
Really doesn't matter where, Jack!
Long as you're there
'Cause we said he's on the air

You hear the sweetest sounds
That you ever heard
And I mean to say
It's the grooviest way to get down
Every single name
Classic Jazz they taught him
Spinnin' till the mornin' light
And it feels alright

When you listen to the 'Bird'
You will flip!
Charlie Parker's spread the word
All the way up from Kansas City
Gr-ooo-vy as he could be

What a pleasure
Tuning in to Sidney
Let it ro-ooo-ooo-oooll

Let it ro-ooo-ooo-oooll

Jumpin' with my boy, Sid, in the city
Mr. President of the DJ committee
We're gonna be up all night gettin' with it

We want you to spin the sounds that are with it
From down in the land that's real, real pretty
Make everything go real crazy over Jersey (wee!)
Make everything go real crazy over Jersey (wee!)

Gotta be cool for me n' my baby (woo!)
We don't wanna think we're listenin' lazy
It's gotta be Pressburg cheerin' all the Basie
That's all for now tune in tomorrow night!
Bye-i-i-i-i!
