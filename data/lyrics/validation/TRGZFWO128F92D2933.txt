[Verse 1]
Sometimes a man does things without half thinking
And what I saw I did not understand
I called you names and said some things that hurt you
And in the heat I started walking out that door

[Chorus]
But on second thought I'll just turn around here in my tracks
And walk back into your arms where I belong
I was wrong
On second thought I apologize for what I've done
'Cause you're the only one I'll always be in love with

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I know it's not your fault that you're so pretty
And that you turn the head of every man
I understand
But when I saw you dancing with him I just lost it
I started thinking I don't love you anymore

[Chorus]
But on second thought I'll just turn around here in my tracks
And walk back into your arms where I belong
I was wrong
On second thought I apologize for what I've done
'Cause you're the only one I'll always be in love with

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge?]
But when I saw you dancing with him I just lost it
I started thinking I don't love you anymore

[Chorus]
But on second thought I'll just turn around here in my tracks
And walk back into your arms where I belong
I was wrong
On second thought I apologize for what I've done
'Cause you're the only one I'll always be in love with

[Tag]
Yes you're the only one I'll always be in love with
