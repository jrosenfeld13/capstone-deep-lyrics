Will you go and leave me in the song?
I'll be hiding
I'll be on queue
For spaces that
Can bring me from the wrong
Change the light love
Make it strong

Cause...
Times of songs are
Times of songs are
Times of songs
Our song

I'll be on the record When you're gone
Sides are sorted
Pixels formed

The measure and the meter may be off
Still returning
Strangest stops

And the time slows
And where you go
I'll pull you from the bottom
And I'll leave you on the floor

And halos and con shows
And where you go
I've been before
And I'll be on the tongue

Are you on the record when I'm gone?
Stealing covers
Lifting poems

It's where you've been
And what you've done so long
I'll be your bitter song
Bitter... song

Cause the time slows
And where you go
I'll pull you from the bottom
And I'll leave you on the floor
And where you've been
For way too long

For each and everybody
Has a calling in the song
For each and everybody
Has a calling in the song
