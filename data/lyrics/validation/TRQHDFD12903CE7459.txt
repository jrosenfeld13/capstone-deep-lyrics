Enter the imagination, explore the dreamlike plains
And know the things will never be the same again
(Confide)
Begin the initiation, an offer to dream and drift away
(Abide)
As you go clarity will descend upon the vague

Unobserved
I am the noumenon
Hidden out of sight
I'm the elusive one
While observed
I'm the phenomenon
Miracle in sight, distorting concepts of minds

That's where ideas will never cease to roam (dream and drift away)
And where impressions never cease to flow, follow

(Resist)
Defy every calculation of reason explaining me away
(Persist)
Unfold what is beyond, I am the mutant strain

Unobserved
I am the noumenon
Hidden out of sight
I'm the elusive one
While observed
I'm the phenomenon
Miracle in sight, distorting concepts of minds

That's where ideas will never cease to roam (dream and drift away)
And where impressions never cease to flow, follow

I deny faithseekers who seek spaces within
Their cause and quest forsaken
You can't find what is already here

And as you dream of rain, on earth it falls
Balanced internally, all things become entwined

Unobserved
I am the noumenon
Hidden out of sight
I'm the elusive one
While observed
I'm the phenomenon
Miracle in sight, distorting concepts of minds

That's where ideas will never cease to roam (dream and drift away)
And where impressions never cease to flow, follow
When unobserved I am the noumenon (I am the mutant strain)
And while observed I'm the phenomenon, unveiled

And as you dream of rain, on earth it falls
Balanced internally, all things become entwined
