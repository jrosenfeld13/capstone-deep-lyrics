[Intro]
What a gwaan inna de ghetto?

You know what?

A just sufferation, sufferation, hey!

[Chorus]
Hungry days, mi want a change of pace
Owl ah seek mi bird outta desolate place
'Cause ah hungry days, it a show inna mi face
Owl ah seek mi bird outta desolate place

[Verse 1]
One youth inna belly and two deh pon di ground (di ground)
She nuh know from whence her next meal a come
Hungry ah yawn; well dat a di norm down inna di slum
Still nuh go lose mi cool
Mi a stay focused; nuh go pick up nuh gun
Still nuh guh drown mi sorrows inna rum
Cause if riches fi come
One day it's gonna come
But right here now a jus'

'Cause ah hungry days, it a show inna mi face

Unno remember de youths dem inna Rwanda
Me wonder if wah good fi di goose no good fi di gander
Ca' goose no have a diamond gander have it ah squander
Ah build up dem demonical police and sodomonic empire
But ah greed ah di biggest factor
Ca' some say dem love we but dem just a actor

Deceive ah youth ah dem ah future dem ah fracture
Inna hungry, inna hungry, inna hungry, ah hungry days!

[Chorus]
Hungry days, mi want a change of pace

But what about di little baby feed (feed)
Weh no cater 'bout we basic needs
Each and every day mi say tax ah increase
And still di liccle ghetto youths cyaan juggle inna peace
Thro' pressure Maxine swallow her pride (pride)
Dollar her sell di love 'pon di side
Daytime bucka bold and brave she nuh go hide (hide)
For her belly full she'll gi' any man a ride

[Chorus]
Hungry days, mi want a change of pace
Owl ah seek mi bird outta desolate place
'Cause ah hungry days, it a show inna mi face
Owl ah seek mi bird outta desolate place

Still nuh guh drown mi sorrows inna rum
