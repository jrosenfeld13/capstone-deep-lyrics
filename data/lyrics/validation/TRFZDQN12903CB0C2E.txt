Why do I sense, benevolence
You stand tall at my great expense
Thick words of gratitude, what a price to pay
Stuck in my throat, I sell every word I say

But I don't want your charity
Twisting me round
I don't want your charity
Keeping me down...

Why does your world keep burying
Gorging much deeper, than it's ever been
Rubbing still harder, salt on my hurt
Licking my burns while I grovel in your dirt

But I don't want your charity
Twisting me round
I don't want your charity
Keeping me down...
Oh, keeping me down

You pity me with your tasteless gestures
Gratitude for kind
But your bludgeoned, intentioned objectives
Are screwing with my mind, screwing with my mind

But I don't want your charity
Twisting me round
I don't want your charity
Keeping me down...

I don't want your charity, oh charity
Twisting me round
I don't want your charity
Keeping me down...

I don't want your, don't want your, don't want your charity
Keeping me down
I don't want your charity
Keeping me down, down
Keeping me down, down, down
Your charity, it's keeping me
Keeping me down
