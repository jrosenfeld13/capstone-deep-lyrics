I haven't learned to say goodbye
Hello itself is hard enough
It kills to let a good thing die
And I don't want to see it go bad

Picture perfect morning
Just before the dawn
And city lights are dying
Sing in the cathedral
Face in the stained glass is crying

I won't let myself look at you
And see you like I really do
It's hard to believe
That you're really here
So I just pretend that you're not there

Picture perfect morning
Just before the dawn
And city lights are dying
Sing in the cathedral
Face in the stained glass is crying

Picture perfect morning
Just before the dawn
And city lights are dying
Sing in the cathedral
Face in the stained glass is crying

And when my plane flew through the rain
It shook the wings and people screamed
But I was so sure that I'd see you again
I was not afraid of anything
