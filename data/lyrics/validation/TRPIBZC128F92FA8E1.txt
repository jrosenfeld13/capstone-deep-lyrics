People said to lock the door and have an open house no more
The said the factory must change and slowly slip away
But if I have to live in fear, where will I get my ideas
With all those crazy people gone, will I slowly slip away

Still there's no more Billy Name, and Ondine is not the same
Wonton and the turtle gone
Slowly slip away...slowly slip away
If I close the factory door and don't see those people anymore
If I give in to infamy...I'll slowly slip away
I know it seems that friends are right
Hello daylight, goodbye night
But starlight is so quiet here, think I'll slowly slip away

What can I do by myself, it's good to here from someone else
It's good to hear a crazy voice that will not slip away
Will not slip away

If I have to live in fear my ideas will slowly slip away
If I have to live in fear I'm afraid my life will slip away
If you can't see me past my door
Why your thoughts could slowly slip away
If I have to lock the door, another life exists no more
Slip away

Friends have said to lock the door
Watch out for who comes through the door
They said the Factory must change
But I don't
