[Verse 1]
When will this winter end?
The snow's been fallin' for months
The town all dressed in white
And my skin is burning from the wind

[Verse 2]
A cold sun in disguise
An assault from the morning light
My burial, I can't succeed
Frozen and paralyzed

[Chorus]
Oh, winter [x 8]

[Bridge]
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh [x6]

[Chorus]
Oh, winter [x8]

[Outro]
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh [x4]
