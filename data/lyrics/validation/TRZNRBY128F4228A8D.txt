[Verse 1]
He came riding fast like a phoenix out of fire flames
He came dressed in black with a cross bearing my name
He came bathed in light and the splendor and glory
I can't believe what the lord has finally sent me

[Verse 2]
He said, "Dance for me, fanciulla gentile."
He said, "Laugh awhile, I can make your heart feel."
He said, "Fly with me, touch the face of the true god
And then cry with joy at the depth of my love."

[Chorus]
'Cause I've prayed days, I've prayed nights
For the lord just to send me home some sign
I've looked long, I've looked far
To bring peace to my black and empty heart
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, aaaaaah!

[Verse 3]
My love will stay 'till the river bed run dry
And my love lasts long as the sunshine blue sky
I love him longer as each damn day goes
The man is gone and heaven only knows

[Chorus]
'Cause I've cried days, I've cried nights
For the lord just to send me home some sign
Is he near?
Is he far?
Bring peace to my black and empty heart

So long day, so long night
Oh lord, be near me tonight
Is he near?
Is he far?
Bring peace to my black and empty heart
