[Verse 1]
I gave you love
You did me wrong
I didn't know what to do
But baby, I'm strong
I'll get over you
A new boy I'm gonna choose
You'll see

My love was true
Still you threw it all away
Now other guys will have me
They'll appreciate my love
Tell me, how does it feel?

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that I needed you
You know that you meant the world to me
You know I had to have you
Now I'm gonna find somebody new

[Chorus]
I'm looking for a new love, baby
A new love, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm looking for a new love, baby
A new love, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Was she hot?
Did she turn you out?
Curiosity rules my brain
Was she worth my heart
It's torn all apart
Are you going back again?
Tell me

My love was true
Still you threw it all away
But now your like the rest
Unworthy of my best
Hasta la vista, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that I needed you
You know that you meant the world to me
You know I had to have you
Now I'm gonna find somebody new

[Chorus]
I'm looking for a new love, baby
A new love, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm looking for a new love, baby
A new love, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm looking for a new love, baby
A new love, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm looking for a new love, baby
A new love, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Other guys will have me
They'll appreciate my love
Tell me, how does it feel?
Now you're like the rest
Unworthy of my best
Hasta la vista, baby

[Outro]
I'm looking for a new love, baby
A new love
I'm looking for a new love, baby
A new love
I'm looking for a new love, baby
A new love
