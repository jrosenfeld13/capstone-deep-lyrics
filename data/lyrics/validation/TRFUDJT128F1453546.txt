Fly (Through The Starry Night)
Come on lift your head high
Reaching out for the sky
Spread your wings out and fly right through the starry night
You're unique, you're o.k
Never must be afraid
Spread your wings out and fly right through the starry night
Through the starry night. (2x)
Move as I groove on
Now put your dancing shoes on
It's time to realize you can rise to the top
Now don't you ever stop
Sometimes in live when you feel like giving up
You got to keep your head up
Be the best you can
Strive in your live to make a masterplan
Here I am here I am bam
Positive vibes for the mind so slam
All the negativity around you end me
Feel free mentally
Break the chain holding you down
To the ground turn up the sound
Here it is if you wanna try
Keep your head up and reach for the sky

(chorus)
Right through the starry night. (2x)
Through the starry night
Feel the vibe moving your mind
Feel the vibe always on time
Elevate you got what it takes
Elevate it's not too late
I got the remedy just follow me
Fly high with no XTC
It's real and natural
You feel good like I know you would
Knock, knock, knock who is it
R.O.C.K. the lyrical wizard
Get ready to fly with me
To a place with mysteries
Close your eyes, let yourself go
Don't be afraid cause you got to know
Here it is you wanna try
Keep your head up and reach for the sky

(chorus)
Right through the starry night. (4x)
