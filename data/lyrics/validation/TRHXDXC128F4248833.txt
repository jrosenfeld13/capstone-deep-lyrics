Spoken:

Well I never think that when I'm twenty-one, I'm twenty-one - I think of tomorrow or this minute... And hope there's a tomorrow, 'cause I don't like what's going on in the world. I'm scared of that, more than drugs. I'm not afraid of them...
I'm just... I'm just scared you know?

In 15 years... the high school and college students... who are experimenting with LSD... will be running our institutions and guiding public policy
Remember..., the college students who are using LSD and Marijuana today do not comprise a criminal class. They are not drug addicts seeking to escape...
They're your best educated, your most creative, and your most courageous young people...
And like it or not, they're going to build you a new civilization

They may be severely depressed, with suicidal tendencies, or may be very serious suicide attempts, they may be confused, wandering about, not knowing where they are... they may be hallucinating, that is hearing voices or seeing things, or they may be extremely anxious to the point of panic...

LSD helps me to remember or it helps me to forget (laughing), no, I don't know...

In the last year, we're told that perhaps a million Americans, most of them young people, have made the LSD experience part of their lives. Is this a social menace and a cause for alarm?
I don't think so. I see nothing less than the speedy evolution of a new, indigenous religion

Well I never think that when I'm twenty-one, I'm twenty-one - I think of tomorrow or this minute... And hope there's a tomorrow, 'cause I don't like what's going on in the world. I'm scared of that, more than drugs. I'm not afraid of them...
I'm just... I'm just scared you know?
I'm just... I'm just scared you know?
I'm just... I'm just scared you know?
I'm just... I'm just scared you know?
I'm just... I'm just scared you know?
Everybody is
