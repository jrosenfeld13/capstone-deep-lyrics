Even though you were fooled
I was on my guard
Cheap tricks for money
The magician man
Tacky gag, wacky lines
He was at this best
Must've seen us coming
The magician man

Nobody to play to is the fear we all hold inside
Will somebody pay to see this magical man?

Roll up, and see it all
(Roll up, the magical man)
A ball
(Stroll up, the magical man)
Stroll up, we have it all
(Roll up, the magical man)
And more
(Stroll up, the magical man)

Simply done, round applause
All the glamour too
"Show me your hand", says
The magician man
"I will read, amaze you all!"
He tells you what you want to
Hear for a lifetime by
The magician man

Nobody to play to is the fear we all hold inside
Will somebody pay to see this magical man?

Roll up, and see it all
(Roll up, the magical man)
A ball
(Stroll up, the magical man)
Stroll up, we have it all
(Roll up, the magical man)
And more
(Stroll up, the magical man)

Roll up, and see it all
(Roll up, the magical man)
A ball
(Stroll up, the magical man)
Stroll up, we have it all
(Roll up, the magical man)
And more
(Stroll up, the magical man)
Roll up and see it all

(Roll up, the magical man)
(Stroll up, the magical man)
(Roll up, the magical man)
(Stroll up, the magical man)

I have seen you playing tricks
I have seen you playing tricks
I have seen you playing tricks
I have seen you playing tricks
