[Verse 1]
Tonight I dreamt we found a fair of wonders
Where the future and past cannot contain
We were greeted by a spell that took us under
And laid down in a field there ever was
To me, in this dream we share
I believed a perfect pair
Oh, but I was wrong
This fair comes with a price
Because tonight, I'll wake up twice
And both times find you gone

[Chorus]
Reflection
Is all we have and when it's over
Reflections
Of the path that sends us searching over and over again

[Verse 2]
Too quick to fall asleep again to find you
I'm rushing through a dream I can't control
This house of mirrors beckons us to walk through
But inside again, I'll have to let you go
Stuck here in this stare
Revealed beyond the glare
Again you're gone
So throw a stone through these reflections
Scatter light in all directions
And sing this song

[Chorus]
Reflection
Is all we have and when it's over
Reflections
Of the path that sends us searching over and over again

[Bridge]
Where does the physical meet with the spiritual?
Is this the typical question?
But down below and up above
It looks the same so I'm not sure of anything
Where will love come from again?

[Chorus]
Reflection
Is all we have and when it's over
Reflections
Of the path that sends us searching over and over again
Reflection
Is all we have and when it's over
Redirection
Is the path that sends us searching
