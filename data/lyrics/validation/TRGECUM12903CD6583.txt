[Orchestra]
Boy, the honeydripper
He's a killer, the honeydripper
Salt, sweet, hot, reet
A solid old cat
Really, a mellow hep cat

[Cab Calloway]
And he jumps
And he sways
And he rips
And he rides
And he ships
And jumps
He's high
Oh my
To dig that cat
And jump for joy
You dig that lick
You dig that beat
You get knocked out
Right off your feet

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, oh rip it
You take it away
He's a killer
Honey driller
Boy, joy, joy, hoy, boy, hoy, joy
He's a dipper
The honeydripper
Boy, hoy, joy, hoy, boy, hoy, hoy, joy
A-swing it up, bring it up, bring it on up
A-swing it up, bring it up, bring it on up
A-swing it up, bring it up, bring it on up
A-swing it up, bring it up, bring it on up, boy!

[Instrumental Break]

Boy, the honeydripper
He's a killer, the honeydripper
He's salt, sweet, hot, reet
A solid old cat
He's really, a mellow hep cat
