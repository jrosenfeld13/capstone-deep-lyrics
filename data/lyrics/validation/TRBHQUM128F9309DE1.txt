[Verse 1]
Michael, Michael, Michael
Wake up, we're going back to Chelmsley Wood
Michael, Michael, Michael
My feet are dancing, can you see them?

[Verse 2]
Michael, Michael, Michael
I'll change my hair but inside I'll stay the same
Michael, Michael, Michael
I'll draw my lips around my lipstick

[Chorus]
My feet are dancing so much and I hate that
My feet are dancing so much
See, if you're feeling like you're looking for a chance to let go
And if you're feeling like you're looking for that chance then let go
Let go, let go

[Verse 3]
Michael, Michael, Michael
Come on, your father was a teddy boy
Michael, Michael, Michael
There's nothing written on your fingernails

[Verse 4]
Michael, Michael, Michael
You said, "Remind me not to be myself"
Michael, Michael, Michael
This is not your sawtooth wave

[Chorus 2]
See, if you're feeling like you're looking for a chance to let go
And if you're feeling like you're looking for that chance then let go
Let go, let go
My feet are dancing so much and I hate that
My feet are dancing so much

[Chorus]
My feet are dancing so much and I hate that
My feet are dancing so much
See, if you're feeling like you're looking for a chance to let go
And if you're feeling like you're looking for that chance then let go
Let go, let go

[Verse 5]
Michael, Michael, Michael
Today the old height rise is coming down
Michael, Michael, Michael
This is not your sawtooth wave
