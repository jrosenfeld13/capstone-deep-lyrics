I can barely remember what it was that made me walk away
But something deep inside my heart is tellin' me I still love you, baby
Now I'm walking all alone this cold December day
I see you come to me, but I can't see
'Cause all I wanna do is tell you, baby

1-How many times I
Daydreamed of what we could have been
How many times I
Find myself asking why

2-'Cause I will never stop lovin' you
Can you tell me what I gotta do?
'Cause I never wanna say goodbye
Don't wanna say goodbye again
Now I know that I was meant for you
One more time I can't bear to lose
I don't ever wanna say goodbye
Don't wanna say goodbye again

We thought it'd last forever, but I was swept away
What I thought I knew it wasn't true
I wish I would've knew before today
I always said I'd never let myself lose again
Yes, I found a way what I gotta do to get myself back to you

Repeat 1
Repeat 2

How can I get through to you?
I'm not even close to over you
Tellin' you the truth
Got me shaky
There's nothing I won't do
To get you right back next to me
The way it's supposed to be

Repeat 2 (2x)
