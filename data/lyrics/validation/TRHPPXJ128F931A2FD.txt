Tell me, what did you wear
Innocence and recked well, I really don't care
How it's all been easy, and why your not lonely
I didn't need to know how he gets you loud

I stumble through the fire on my own
Burns a little more now, the seasons are gone
Centuries been together, back to bad
Someone give me more now, I need this to last
In the beat of the hour

Sweetness the bubble did burst, maybe for the better
That I knew first, given all the secrets you had to fine
Well everyone got needs, but what about mine

I stumble through the fire on my own
Burns a little more now, the seasons are gone
Centuries been together, back to bad
Someone give me more now, I need this to last

So now I'm failing in this war
A little wise won't help at all
You know I'm failing in this war
This little lie will mend my soul

I stumble through the fire all alone
Burns a little more now, the seasons are gone
I have wasted centuries away, but in my own sweet time
I stumble through the fire

Sweet sweet lie

Sweeeeeeeeet...
