The groove juice special keeps rolling along
The groove juice special it's the night clubbers' song
You're out at night, and art feelin' tight
The juicy, juicy, juicy, juicy groove juice
Z for ziskey is the word you'll say
When the bottles start comin' your way
You'll be hoppin' like hades a poppin'
The juicy, juicy, juicy, juicy groove juice

You'll feel mellow, just a cello
You'll feel fine
Just like wine, and I ain't lyin'
The groove juice special keeps rolling along
The groove juice special it's the night clubbers' song
You'll feel great like a P38
The juicy, juicy, juicy, juicy groove juice
