If your body's feeling bad
And it's the only one you have
You want to take away the pain
Go out walking in the rain
Watch the flowers go to bed
Ask the man inside your head
Your spirit never has to grieve
All you've got to do's believe

The faith healer, the faith healer

All you've got to do is feel
Your body's going to start to heal
Fingertips of holy fire
Everlasting sweet desire
It don't matter what the doctors say
Healer man, sail away
Immortality for two
Miracles will come to you

The faith healer, the faith healer

Can I put my hands on you

Faith and hope and charity
Simple relativity
He can make you understand
Calm enough to take his hand
Remember when somebody said
Ask the man inside your head
Fingertips and holy fire
Everlasting sweet desire

The faith healer, the faith healer

Can I put my hands on you

The faith healer, the faith healer
