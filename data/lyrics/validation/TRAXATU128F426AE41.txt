Fifteen hundred miles is a long, long way
And I wish that I could be with you especially today
Standing right beside me is a man with a gun
And he's waiting for the chance to shoot me down if I should run
'Cos I'm on the inside looking out
And don't you know there's nothing I can do

Yes I'm sitting on the inside looking out
And I know that time is slowly running out

I've been here for seven long years doing time
And I just can't take much more of this, I'm gonna lose my mind
Standing close to me the warden looks me in the eye
I can hear him saying, "Boy, you're gonna be here till you die"
'Cos I'm on the inside looking out
And don't you know there's nothing I can do

Yes I'm sitting on the inside looking out
And I know that time is slowly running out

As I write this letter there is something you should know
It's to tell you I don't think that I am ever coming home
So when you receive this note don't bother to reply
'Cos I don't want you to waste your life the way I've wasted mine
'Cos I'm on the inside looking out
And don't you know there's nothing I can do
'Cos I'm on the inside looking out
And don't you know there's nothing I can do
