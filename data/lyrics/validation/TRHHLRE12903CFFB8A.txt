Clueless fool
A speck of insignificance
...Living in a thin dream
Deluded complainer
Led by the confused
...Living in a thin dream

Perhaps you should be looking at their genitals?

No inspiration, no inner child
No depth - Only icing
Save your breath - I hear you cry
You're just a weak little boy
Wasting your breath - I hear you cry
...You're just weak

Patchwork of stolen identities
Stick to the trend or fade from existence
Can't break the programming
Another follower thinking he's in the lead
Live the lie - The convoluted hoper
Clean and tidy, just right
You're just a weak little boy
Wasting your breath - I hear you cry
No longer mommy's little boy - you're just a weak
