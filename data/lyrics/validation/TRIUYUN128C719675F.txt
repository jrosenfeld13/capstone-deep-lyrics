Where've you been, love?
How've you been, love?
It's a long time since I've seen love
You make me happy, love
Hope that you're happy, love
I was a scrappy love

I feel like I'm stupid now
I feel like I'm stupid now

How've you been, love?
I've committed a sin, love
You care for him, love?
He's good for you, love
Guess who has sinned, love?
She asked how you're doin', love
I feel kind of stupid, love
'Till he moves to the neck, to the push, to the shove

How much time has it been, love?
How much time has it been, love?

We don't even speak now
Remember the first walk-out?
You fill my need
You tell me to read
We sat in the park
We sat just apart

But not for our own love
We grew a strong love
But not for our own love
We grew a strong love

Wish I could sin, love
Wish I could sin, love
Wish I could sin, love

Where've you been, love?
How've you been, love?
It's a long time since I've seen love
You make me happy, love
Hope that you're happy, love
I was a scrappy love

Feel like I'm stupid now
Feel like I'm stupid now

How've you been, love?
I've committed a sin, love
Do you care for him love?
He's good for you, love
Guess who I've seen, love?
She asked how you're doin', love
I feel kind of stupid, love
'Till he moves to the neck, to the push, to the shove

How much time has it been, love?
How much time has it been, love?

We don't want to speak now
Remember the first walk-out?
You fill my need
And tell me to read
We sat in the park
We sat just apart

But not for our own love
We grew a strong love
But not for our own love
We grew a strong love

Wish I could sin, love
Wish I could sin, love

How've you been, love?
It's a long time since I've seen love
You care for him, love?
He's good for you, love
He's good for you, love
