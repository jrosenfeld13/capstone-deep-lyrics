They say
You curse at girls
Don't you know it isn't right?
You could get yourself in trouble..
You've been
Livin in a different world
Lookin' for another fight
Sifting through emotional rubble

Hey, boy, don't you get it
That one day you're gonna regret it
When she's gone
Hey, boy, you can bet it
That you will be blue

Each time you curse at girls
You curse a little at yourself
Don't you know a girl gets angry?

Hey, boy, don't you get it
That one day you're gonna regret it
When she's gone
Hey, boy, you can bet it
That you will be blue

They say you curse at girls
Don't you know it isn't right?
