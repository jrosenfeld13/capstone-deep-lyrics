Do angels fly higher in the dark?
Black is my mind when a new day has come
Black are the tears when I cry
Come here and take my hand, join this misery
The fallen angel will set us free
Do angels fly higher in the dark?
Do they crash down and fall apart?
Let's cut the wings away
And the angel has fallen again
Together in eternal flames
Where the cold razor cares
I do not care if you want to hurt me
Torture is ecstasy to me
You cut my wounds so deep, even deeper than yours
Like the fallen angel without remorse
