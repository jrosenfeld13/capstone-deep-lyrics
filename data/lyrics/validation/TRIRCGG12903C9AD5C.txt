I don't want you coming here
No way, no way
I can't have you staying here
No way, no way
Every time I am reminded
Of the good thing that we use to know
And I know you're not expecting
To go on second guessing
But I think it's for the best

I don't want you coming here
No way, no way
I can't have you staying here
No way, no way
Everytime I see your eyes
I want to walk with you in moonlight
And I know you're not intending
To go on just pretending
But I think it's for the best

But when you're with me darling I don't believe in anyone else
I'm so confused by you
I don't know what to do
I don't want you coming here

Yeah I don't want you coming here
No way, no way
I can't have you staying here
No way, no way

But when you're with me darling I don't believe in anyone else
I'm so confused by you
But when you're with me darling I don't believe in anyone else
I'm so confused by you
Don't tell me what to do
I don't want you coming here
