Too many times I've tried to answer
The voices in my head
Too many nights I see that anger
All of the things I said

Can you believe
You're building a fire
It's one that keeps me cold

Take me down
And leave me lonely
Who's left to watch over me
Now you're gone
My light is fading
You brought on the darkness in me

In me

Sometimes I feel the words you whisper
Why can't you hear me scream
To make believe that it doesn't matter
Is harder than it seems

Can you believe
You're building a fire
It's one that keeps me cold

Oh, the sanctity

That circles me, broken
My soul's been fighting solemnly

Take me down
And leave me lonely
Who's left to watch over me
Now you're gone
My light is fading
You brought on the darkness in me

Take me down
And leave me lonely
Who's left to watch over me
Now you're gone
My light is fading
You brought on the darkness in me

Take me down
And leave me lonely
Who's left to watch over me
Now you're gone
My light is fading
You brought on the darkness in me

In me
