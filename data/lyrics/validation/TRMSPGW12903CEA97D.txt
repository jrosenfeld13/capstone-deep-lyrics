I have a watch tower
I have the light the emulates
I have the key that fits
I have the love that radiates

We will be on the throne
We'll cast away the jokers
We're on a treasure hunt
We are the key that fits

We're marching forward
Looking backward, hunting for treasure again
We're marching backward looking forward
Searching for treasure again

We are the watch towers
We are the light that emulates
We are the key that fits
We are the love that radiates

We're marching forward
Looking backward, hunting for treasure again
We're marching backward looking forward
Searching for treasure again

We're marching forward
Looking backward, hunting for treasure again
We're marching backward looking forward
Searching for treasure again
