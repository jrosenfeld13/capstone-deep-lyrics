Yes, I walk through valleys deep
Shadows of death I will fear no thing
I fear no man and no evil speak
No slave to grave and no death to be
Almighty's riding next to me
I know I've, I got the devil to beat

Hellbounds are running close to me
On the trail of my life
I was hellbound, but now I'm running free
From Satan's Angels of Light

Resurrect me high
And then rise me up
Reaper leaving my bones
I'm dead asleep until now
You wake me up
Rapture me and I'm gone

I'll live to die
Die another day
Another place, another time
I'll live to die, oh Lord
I'll rise to life again
I will live to die another time

Oh, so close, I feel him breathe
Devil's come for my life
Showdown's a coming 'round, ya see
A bigger gun, I come to take his life

Resurrect me high
And shake me up
Leave the Reaper my bones
Raise the dead in me now
And take me up
Rapture me and I'm gone

Yes, I walk through valleys deep
I will fear no man, I will fear no speak
No slave to grave and no death to be
Almighty's riding next to me
