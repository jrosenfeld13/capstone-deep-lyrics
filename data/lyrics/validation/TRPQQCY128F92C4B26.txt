Hear the music coming
Loud as you can stand
You will never be the same again
Let the beat into you
Let it turn you round
Let it be your best friend

You are the future, it's your time
You and you and you
Stay together, this is yours and mine
What we gonna do?

Rock out, rock out, rock out
Let it crush your fear
Rock out, rock out, rock out
And you can get it here

Here come the bass
Thunder in the guts
Rocking till you can't stand
Now, the guitar speaks
Gonna drive you nuts
Power under your hand

You are the people, now you shine
You and you and you
Stay together, let me speak the line
What you gonna do?

Rock out, rock out, rock out
Let it crush your fear
Rock out, rock out, rock out
You can get it here
Rock out, rock out, with your cock out
Impress your lady friends
Rock out, rock out, rock out
Till your life is at an end

No, no, no
