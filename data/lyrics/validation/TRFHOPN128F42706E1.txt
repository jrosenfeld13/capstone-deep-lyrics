I met him in old Mexico
He was laughing sad and young
In a smokey room where no one could see
His favorite poets all agreed
Spanish is a loving tongue
But he never spoke Spanish to me

He was born in Monterrey
All the Christmas songs were sung
And Padre knew what he'd grow up to be
Saints and sinners all agree
Spanish is a loving tongue
But he never spoke Spanish to me

Like a lion screaming in the jungle low
He never fooled with things he couldn't see
He spoke to all the shadows in his bungalow
But he never spoke Spanish to me

He said if you're from Texas, woman
Where's your boots and where's your gun
And I smiled and said I got guns that no one can see
Well, we laughed at that, we both agreed
Spanish is a loving tongue
But he never spoke Spanish to me

I left him in old Mexico
He was laughing sad and young
In a smokey room where no one could see
His favorite poets all agreed
Spanish is a loving tongue
But he never spoke Spanish to me
No, he never spoke Spanish to me
