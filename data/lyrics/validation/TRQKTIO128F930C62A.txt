Been workin' overtime
And gettin' sick of these crazy games
I'll be a satellite
And wait for someone to enter my gaze

I see you like a star in the sky
And I love it, yeah, the light in your eyes
And I wonder when you're lookin' in mine
Do you see them like a star in the sky

You got me fallin' for ya
And I won't stop 'til I hit the clouds
See I don't wanna hide these feelin's
Or even try to figure them out

Sparks flyin' all around, electricity
Dance with me, dance with me
Ten feet off the ground, no gravity
Fly with me, fly with me

I see you like a star in the sky
And I love it, yeah, the light in your eyes
And I wonder when you're lookin' in mine
Do you see them like a star in the sky

I see you like a star in the sky
And I love it, yeah, the light in your eyes
And I wonder when you're lookin' in mine
Do you see them like a star in the sky

Way up high, satellite, yeah
You and I identify

I see you like a star in the sky
And I love it, yeah, the light in your eyes
And I wonder when you're lookin' in mine
Do you see them like a star in the sky

I see you like a star in the sky
And I love it, yeah, the light in your eyes
And I wonder when you're lookin' in mine
Do you see them like a star in the sky

I see you like a star in the sky
And I love it, yeah, the light in your eyes
And I wonder when you're lookin' in mine
Do you see them like a star in the sky

Sparks flyin' all around, electricity
Dance with me, dance with me
Ten feet off the ground, no gravity
Fly with me, fly with me
