Hey, Renee
How you doing today, Renee?
Picking up a cup of coffee
Then you'll be on your way

Take a sip or two
What's it like to be you?
Is it really as perfect
As we'd like to conclude?

Or do you lie awake at night
Contemplating life
Trying to remember some line
Of a song?

Do you stare off into space
Dreaming of a place
Where you can just erase
What went wrong?

Hey, Renee
We got you up on display today
How do you process our opinions
With a smile on your face?

Hollywood
I guess the pay's pretty good, it should be
I don't think I'd trade places with you
Even if I could

I'm sure there're days you have your doubts
Wonder what it's all about
When you can't wait to just go home
And get out of those shoes

Might even pace across the floor
'Cause you know there's something more
But can't decide what door you should choose
Me too

Hey, Renee
It'll all be okay
Sorry, no, you don't know me
Hope you have a nice day

You got a tough role to play
Jesus loves you, Renee
That's all I wanted to say
