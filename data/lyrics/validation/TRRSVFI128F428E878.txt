So you've made some big decision
You seem to feel so cold
It may sound worse today
Go on and tell me something's changing
You need to be alone
And take some time away
We all must survive
On what keeps us alive
Don't go, take this too far
Stay here for a while
Don't go, leave this behind
Stay here for some time
So, you've found yourself a partner
It seemed to take so long
A place to call your home
Still, you need so much to listen
To each and everyone
Their hearts except your own
We all must survive
On what keeps us alive
Don't go, take this too far
Stay here for a while
Don't go, leave this behind
Stay here for some time
