I will try to buy my freedom
I am cursed with golden chains
And the walls are getting thinner
Will I survive these phantom pains?

I still believe theres something wrong
Its getting hopeless, cause it cant get much worse
What other choices, should I have made here first?
Theres no excuses, are we a waste of skin?
So does it matter? If I would lie down still

Put the gun against my temple
Ask the question by my grave
Hope the end will make you wiser
Tell me where was God today?
