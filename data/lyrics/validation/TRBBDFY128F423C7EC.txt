[Both]
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

[Cham]
This not a video, I don't burn the thing I see
This not a fashion show, with free drinks and a color tv

[Rigorod]
Welcome to your dream world, when you finding up time to kill
Try to find a pretty girl, in a world full of shiny bills

[Chorus x2]
I'm an xtraterrestrial, try to make peace in this beautyful world
They treat me like a criminal, it's so hard to make yourself heard

[Both]
Rraaaahhhhhhh!
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

[Cham]
Can I get a witness yooo, I need some to set me free
Find me in +The Patio+, doin la di di the di di (Puff puff)

[Rigorod]
Talking 'bout hollywood dreams
Talking 'bout shit that I really don't care
And tell me if life?s so mean
How come I so easily forget?

[Chorus] Repeat several times
I'm an xtraterrestrial, try to make peace in this beautyful world
They treat me like a criminal, it's so hard to make yourself heard

Rraaaaahhh!!
