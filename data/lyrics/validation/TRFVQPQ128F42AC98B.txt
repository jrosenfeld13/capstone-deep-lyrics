[Verse 1]
Why do you whisper, green grass?
Why tell the trees what ain't so?
Whispering grass, the trees don't have to know
No, no

[Chorus]
Why tell them all your secrets?
Who kissed there long ago?
Whispering grass, the trees don't need to know

[Verse 2]
Don't you tell it to the breeze
'Cause they will tell the birds and bees
And everyone will know
Because you told the blabbering trees
Yes, you told them once before
It's no secret anymore

[Chorus] (x2)
Why tell them all the old things?
They're buried under the snow
Whispering grass don't tell the trees
'Cause the trees don't need to know
