Lots of faces around us here
I just love to see the way
You're wild at heart

Your airs and graces don't bother me
I just wanna see the world
My own way

One beat away
One beat away
One beat away

One beat away
One beat away
From my heart

Ho ho ho ho, ho, ho, ho
Ho ho ho ho, ho, ho, ho

You're only one beat away
From my heart

A thousand miles of your life ahead
Tell me what you dream at night
Where the wild things are

Do you ever blow the clouds away
I just wanna be with you
Can I stay?
