I been working all day for me mate on the site
Running around like a blue arsed fly

(chorus) i been working, working all day for me mate
Every bleeding minute i been on the go
Up and down the ladder like a fiddler's elbow
I been working, i been working all day for me mate
Wait for tomorrow at half past ten when i sign on
But until then i'll be working, working all day for me mate
Ain't' got no cards, don't pay no tax
For a score in me hand i'll be breaking me back
Call me a crook, call me bent
But i need more than food and rent
They try to follow me every day
I give 'em the slip and i'm on my way
None of the other blokes thinks it's wrong
'coz every one of 'em's signing on
The benefit boys are out of touch
What they don't know won't hurt 'em much
If i'm caught i'll go down for a month or three
But they'll still be paying out looking after me
