[Chorus]
Wherever I go
Whatever I see
Over oceans unknown
You are always with me
Pure as the water
We float on this wave
On the breath of an angel
I'll fly away

[Verse 1]
At the ends of your fingers
I follow tonight
Caught in the lighting
Of a thousand horizons
We dance for no reason
You hold on so tight
Lost in the feeling of a wonderful ride

[Interlude]
Di semua bahasa
Semua warna
Kupahami kata
Yang kau ukir indah
Nyanyi beku angin
Cairkan sengat suria
Di relung hatiku
Bernyanyi Bidadari

[Verse 2]
I can hear every word
I see everywhere
Take me into your world
You can answer my prayers
Rivers of hours where time is so rare
Hold me forever
Say you'll always be there

[Chorus]
Wherever I go
Whatever I see
Over oceans unknown
You are always with me
Pure as the water
We float on this wave
On the breath of an angel
I'll fly away
