Look at me, look at you
Been around with nothing to do
Can't you see I need you
Gotta get crooken for the night is through
Rock 'n' roll in your soul
Can't you feel it when the drums start to pow
Let it go then you'll know
Feels so good when you're moving around

Let it all out
Get out your chair, shake it in the air, let it all out
Get it outside, you'll be satisfied, let it all out
You'll feel better when you let it flow, let it flow

Go to town, mess around
It's okay, I'm gonna moving
Kick your feet, feel the beat
Every night and every day
Rock 'n' roll in your soul
Can't you feel it when the drums start to pow
Let it go then you'll know
Feels so good when you're moving around

Let it all out
Get out your chair, shake it in the air, let it all out
Get it outside, you'll be satisfied, let it all out
You'll feel better when you let it flow, let it flow
Let it flow, let it flow

Rock 'n' roll in your soul
Can't you feel it when the drums start to pow
Let it go then you'll know
Feels so good when you're moving around

Let it all out
Get out your chair, shake it in the air, let it all out
Get it outside, you'll be satisfied, let it all out
You'll feel better when you let it flow, let it all out
Get out your chair, shake it in the air, let it all out
Get it outside, you'll be satisfied, let it all out
You'll feel better when you let it flow, let it flow
Let it flow, let it flow
