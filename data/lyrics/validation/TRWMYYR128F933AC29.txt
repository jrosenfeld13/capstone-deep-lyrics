(Gloria Estefan/Jorge Casas/Clay Ostwald)

Oh I love my baby and my baby sure loves me
He understands me like no other so naturally
I spoil my baby with love too hot to throw away
I don't think he'll ever find another that 'll love him that way

Oh baby please, every night
The only thing I really need
To keep me satisfied
You really gotta love your girl
You really gotta love your girl, don't let go
Show her how much you care
You really gotta love your girl
You never gonna lose this girl
Say that it's true, she is your world

My baby knows me
He knows what I love and what to do
He takes me to heaven and I know just how to take him too
I know of no desire my baby has that I can't fulfill
For all the times that we've made love
I've never really had my fill

Oh baby please, every night
The only thing I really need To keep me satisfied
You really gotta love your girl
You really gotta love your girl, don't let go
Show her how much you care
You really gotta love your girl
You never gonna lose this girl
Say that it's true, she is your world
You really gotta love your girl
You really gotta love your girl
Don't let go
Show her how much you care
You really gotta love your girl
You never gonna lose this girl
Say that it's true, she is your world
Oh baby please, every night
The only thing I really need
To keep me satisfied
You really gotta love your girl
