We pulled into Rome
With blood in our eyes
After days of travelin'
Months of lies

Taking our various
Turns at the wheel
Taking booze and pot and cigarettes
Anything not to feel

No one had slept
No one had eaten
Our bodies were bad
Our spirits were beaten

Together we dragged
All of us down
As we staggered through Rome
Blaming the town

Blaming the students
For worship of others
Blaming the cops
And blaming their brothers

And never quite looking
Ourselves in the heart
And minute by minute
Growing further apart

Julia, Julia
Where have you gone?
Why have you vanished
Off of my lawn?

Julia, Julia
Where is your truck?
Where have you driven
With all of my luck?

But even old bull fighters
Their gravestones in sight
Must search till they unearth
One last bull to fight

And so it was with us
So near to the end
One last story to tell
One last hill to defend

One glance to avoid
One guitar to strum
One untruth to be told
One last song to be sung

And you, the most brilliant
Most driven, most keen
Jewel of a bastard
I ever have seen

And you and your turn
The good bitch of the nile
So real to the end
Nothing left to defile

And me in the middle
Along for the ride
The unwilling distraction
From familiocide

And knowing our weaknesses
No one refrained
From picking and prodding
Till nothing remained

Julia, Julia
Where have you gone?
Why have you vanished
Off of my lawn?

Julia, Julia
Where is your truck?
Where have you driven
With all of my luck?

And now in this kitchen
Miles from home
Miles from anything
Miles from Rome

Rome was a bust
Rome was a scream
Rome was the final rapid eye movement
To this dream

We scattered like leaves
Like pieces of dust
Warriors watching
Their swords and shields rust

And now as we descend
To couches and clocks
To closets and appointments
Let us drink to the rocks

Let us drink to the sand
To the winds which have blowed us
Let us drink to the rivers
Let us drink to the road

And if you travel this far
From either conscience or greed
Have one piece of advice
That I think you should heed

Yes, if ever your travels
Take you this far from home
Consult your map carefully
Stear clear of Rome

Julia, Julia
Where have you gone?
Why have you vanished
Off of my lawn?

Julia, Julia
Where is your truck?
Where have you driven
With all of my luck?

Julia, Julia
Where have you gone?
Why have you vanished
Off of my lawn?

Julia, Julia
Where is your truck?
Where have you driven
With all of my luck?
