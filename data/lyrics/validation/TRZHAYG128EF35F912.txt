See her standing, watch him looking
A fly is entering a jar of jam
Separated by dimensions
This repeats itself in time
Get the notion, feel it coming
Try to avoid it if you think you can
Separated by a visible nothing
It's bound to be just a matter of time
Feel it
Imagine the river, imagine the sea
At a certain point they become one
Separating people and land
Like always till the end of time
Feel it
