I could hear the metal rising
From the land across the sea
A wave of thunder in the darkness
Grinding rhythm, scorching steel
FM radio was rockin
Building armies on the air

[Chorus]
Revolution that is still evolving
Standing tall the metal breed
Generations of the anvil pounding
You cant kill the Metal Breed

Burning up the next frontier
Images that stir your mind
Moving pictures with the music
Winning masses all the time
Music television rockin
Legions turning in the show

[Chorus]
Digital now cast in concrete
Spreading out like a disease
Every download on computer
Exhilarate the metal scene

[Chorus]
