As i end this war
Like many times before

I burned these words and without a reason
Spit out ashes your fasting on happiness
This subtle remorse, i claimed treason of course
The mirrors truth is my reflection
This subtle excuse, no one to blame but you

Secrets that you cherish you will take to the grave
It always kills me to see you endure the pain
And i calculate the same mistakes always being made
As i shattered this glass that reflects my face

I died tonight
(as i end this war)
And never felt so alive
(like many times before)

I tryed to explain to you all of my callous ways
But i can no longer justify that my past was to blame
As methodically as the seasons will always change
I would tear off my facade and replace it with a new face
And each time a new scar would surface for me to remember
That it's been twenty six winters and i still have not surrendered
But if i died tonight my letter would read
Dear you

My last breath was in vain

Sincerely
Me

Across twenty six winters
I died that december night and i still can't remember
(across december)

Your apathy does not go unnoticed
And im sorry but they all see through you
Finally face to face
And finally this ends today
(your apathy does not ever seem noticed)

Today i will end this war like many times before
Before the sun sets . . 

Across twenty six winters
I died that december night and i still can't remember
(across december)

Finally face to face
(and im sorry)
And finally this ends today
(but they can see through you)
