I'm sitting here alone - In this Waxwork Palace
I stare at the motionless man, with the eyes of Judas
It's a face I've seen before. In a distant Mental War
Where am I? Where have I come from?

I am Frankenstein - One Million Years B.C
Dinosaurs Rule the Earth - All for you to see

Museum of Mankind - distilled in Ghostly Silence
This Orb no longer turns. As if it never happened
My laboratory has closed. I'm a scientist with all the answers
But where am I? But where do I belong???

I am Frankenstein - One Million Years D.C
Machines now rule The Earth. Not for you to see

I've played chess against the world, and conquered my own madness
I've designed my own plague - Become my own Big Brother
But life goes on, and all this wealth I own....
Amongst the ruins I roam, uncivilized. Alone
