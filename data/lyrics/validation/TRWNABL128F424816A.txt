Black sky before dawn
The moon shines down below the Earth
The new day has begun
Another frightful and dreaded rebirth
Yesterday was such a pressure
Last night was waste of time
This morning's not much better
This morning's not much better
Time has come, and then run past me
I think I'd better just go walk this time
Instead of dealing with the pain of failure
I take my pleasure from the dark of night
Yesterday was such a pressure
Last night was waste of time
This morning's not much better
This morning's not much better
Finally come to the morning
And my legs are feeling wet with cold
I wish I hadn't gone and done it
I wish I woulda just stayed home
Yesterday was like today and
Tonight may be what I'm longing for
And the morning has not come
And still there's work to be done
Time has come, and then run past me
I think I'd better just go walk this time
Instead of dealing with the pain of failure
I take my pleasure from the dark of night
Yesterday was such a pressure
Last night was waste of time
This morning's not much better
This morning's not much better
