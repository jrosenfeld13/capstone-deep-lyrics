In the light of the early morn
There were markings on the heads of the newly born
There was fire in the air
Questions that needed to be
On the ground, an un-earthly shake
There were rumors running round that the dead would wake
And the fear in their eyes
Told me that this was the end
Sleep in the moonlight
And cry in the starlight
And burn in the sunlight
And pray for forgiveness
Welcome the dawn
As their death lingers on
We will sing a new song now forever
Walk on the water
I believe
Walk on the water
I believe you
In the black of the early night
There were vultures in the air with an Eagle's sight
There was dust in my lungs
Choking the life out of me
Then the thunder made my hair stand still
There were demons all around me trying to break my will
But the fear in their eyes
Told me that this was the end
Sleep in the moonlight
And cry in the starlight
And burn in the sunlight
And pray for forgiveness
Welcome the dawn
As their death lingers on
We will sing a new song now forever
Walk on the water
I believe
Walk on the water
I believe you
