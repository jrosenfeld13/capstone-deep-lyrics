Dry me bleedin eyes, internally
I'm longin for my distant sanity
Here I'm all alone and still faithfully
Holdin on my private misery

Why must we live
In this drain that we hate
Life is hell for the dreamer
Who's seeking this shade

Give Me Something To Kill The Pain
There is no tomorrow and no today
My soul is not for eternity
And I know I will fade away, In memories

Cold and crystalized, the world around me
As the daylight brings insanity
I turn my face away regretfully
How I act is always away
From how it has to be

Why must we live
In this drain that we hate
Life is hell for the dreamer
Who's seeking this shade

Give Me Something To Kill The Pain
There is no tomorrow and no today
My soul is not for eternity
And I know I will fade away, In memories
