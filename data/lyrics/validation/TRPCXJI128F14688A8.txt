Don't you worry, I'm alright, Jack
We've never had it so good
House in Hampstead, fallout bunker
Done everything we could
Fitted the Rolls with a shatterproof windscreen
Soon as we heard the news
Harrods do a nice little teargas
Even a woman can use

All good men at Number Ten
Everything's understood
Don't you worry, I'm alright, Jack
We've never had it so good

Don't you worry, I'm alright, Jack
We've never had it so good
There's plenty of grouse at the country house
We're eating as we should
Hugh's at Sandhurst, everything's safe
With Perkins running the farm
Half a dozen shotguns in the Land Rover
Ready for the call to arms

Gin traps down around the grounds
Trip wires out in the wood
Don't you worry, I'm alright, Jack
We've never had it so good
