There's a light
A certain kind of light
That never shone on me
I want my life to be
Lived with you
Lived with you

There's a way
Everybody said
To do each and every little thing
But what good does it bring
If I ain't got you

You don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

I know my faith is mine
I ain't got to be so blind
I'm blind
So, so very blind
And I'm a man
Can't you see what I am?
I live and I breathe for you, yeah
But what good does it do
If I ain't got you
Ain't got

Mmm, baby, you don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like
To love somebody

The way I love you

I'm a man
Can't you see what I am?
I live and I breathe for you
But what good does it do
If I ain't got you
Ain't got

You don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

No, no, no, no, no, no (you don't know what it's like)
You don't know what it's like
To love somebody
