He couldn't find the words to describe his thoughts
Couldn't paint a picture to illuminate his heart
But I knew what he had seen
He tried to trace the changes that had taken place
I saw them written all over his face
And I knew what he had seen

In the cup of cooling water
In the clouds of soothing shade
In the arms of love encircling him
He saw the shape of grace

There was a time he'd said that he could never believe
In the kind of mercy he did not need
And he drew himself away
It was a broken heart and an endless thirst
That drove him to the love he did not deserve
And he knew what he had found

In the cup of cooling water
In the clouds of soothing shade
In the arms of love encircling him
He found the shape of grace
(What did he find?)
In the cup of cooling water
In the clouds of soothing shade
In the arms of love encircling him
He found the shape
Of grace

In the cup of cooling water
In the clouds of soothing shade
In the arms of love encircling him
He saw the shape of grace
(What did he find?)
In the cup of cooling water
In the clouds of soothing shade
In the arms of love encircling him
He found the shape
Of grace
