Just like ma-ma-ma-ma-magic
Just like ma-ma-ma-ma-magic

Inside your dreams, is where you keep me
Tucked away privately
Nobody knows but me those freaky things
You do when you sleep
I can make your x-a-rated, sex-a-cated, fantasies real
I'll have you wrapped around my fingers
Boy, with my sex appeal

And instinctively you come back to me
'Cause your an addict and you'll have it
You don't want to be free

If you, if you make it
Baby, I'll grant your wishes
Don't you take me for granted
Oh oh under my spell now
Let go, is taking you down
Just when you figure me out
My love will disappear

Ma-magic!

Just keep it to your self, 'cause if you tell
They'll take me away
I only come to life, when your at rest
I'm gone when you wake
Come to my hiding place, boy let's get naked
I'm in control
You could have been my matrix, storminatrix
Baby, let's go

And instinctively you come back to me
'cause your an addict and you'll have it
You don't want to be free

My love makes you so weak, it traps you endlessly

If you, if you make it
Baby, I'll grant your wishes
Don't you take me for granted
'Cause my love will disappear like magic
Oh oh under my spell now
That girl is taking you down
Just when you figure me out
My love will disappear

Ma-magic
Just like ma-ma-ma-ma-magic
Just like ma-ma-ma-ma-magic
Ma-magic

You can't tell my secrets babe
It's just the code on my magic
Got you enchanted babe
All messed up from my magic

If you, if you want me
If you, if you want me
If you, if you want me
If you, if you want me

If you make it, I'll grant your wishes
Don't you take me for granted
'Cause my love will disappear like magic
Under my spell now. It's taking you down
Just when you figure me out
My love will disappear

Just like ma-ma-ma-ma-magic
(Just like magic)
'Cause my love will disappear like magic
