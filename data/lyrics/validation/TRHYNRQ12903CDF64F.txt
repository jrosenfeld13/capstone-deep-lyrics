Snorting the stench of latent effluvium
And maturing damp fumes
This foul menage forces tears to your eyes
As the corpse's gas are exhumed
Intoxicated by foul body odours
And the nauseating tepid whiff
Pinching your nostrils as you irrigate flatus
From the emaciated stiff

Volatile entrails fume and steam
As they're meticulously hacked during discission
Evaporating sludge and bubbling pus
A rotten gaseous expiration

Maturating corpse, the stale smell of decay and rot
A sickening asphyxiation
Gross remains gush, innards turn to sludge
With partial liquefaction

Smell the rot
Of the corrupted corpse
Hallucinogenic trip

Tissue gases leak -- a warm, unpleasant reek
A quite macabre addiction
Deteriorated, bloated corpse -- decomposure burning hot
Sniff the smell of carrion

Inhaling the dank smells
As you gouge out the dripping innards with glee
Succumbling to a translucid state
As you sniff the aroma of necropsy
Bacterial decomposition
The aroma of fungal/larval infestation
Consuming, ripening slime
As the cadaver is slowly wasting

Your sore sinews rot, blood curdling coughs
As acrid foetor corrodes your lungs
Body orifices clenched in your teeth
As you frenziedly try to insert the bungs

Swollen, ripened corpse, the stench of crusting clots
The smell of stale perspiration
Administering watery gore, you're screaming out for more
Addicted to putrefaction

Snort the corpse
Get high on the rot
Orgasmic rush
Turns your brains to pus
