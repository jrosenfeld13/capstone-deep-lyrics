There's a rumor that the president's dead
He had a tumor growing deep in his head
But it hasn't had the slightest effect on how he's doing his job
And there's these lessons that they teach you in school
That you'd better learn to play by the rules
Or at least make sure you never get caught
Now that's a dangerous thought
Oh!

They've got McDonald's in the USSR
Fries and burgers in the Kremlin's backyard
Now they're learning what Democracy means
Let's send them Calvin Klein jeans

Is this what Democracy means?
Is this what Democracy means?
Is this what Democracy means?
Is this what Democracy means?

Now there's people living out in the street
Going hungry with no shoes on their feet
While the government just twiddles it's thumbs
And spends more money on guns
And they keep on planning nuclear war
Tell me who is it they're planning it for
If not the men that keep their profits from hate
I swear it simply can't wait

Is this what Democracy means?
Is this what Democracy means?
Is this what Democracy means?
Is this what Democracy means?

And the business boys that don't seem to care
About the blood that fills Tieneman Square
They're so fearful that their checkbooks will bounce
If they should lose these accounts
And the wall that tore Berlin has come down
Can you hear, it's such a beautiful sound
Like it was written up above in the stars
Now we can sell them more cars

Is this what Democracy means?
Is this what Democracy means?
Is this what Democracy means?
Is this what Democracy means?
