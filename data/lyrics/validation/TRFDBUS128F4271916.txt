Hark! The herald angels sing
'Glory to the new born King;
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled.'
Joyful, all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies;
With th'angelic host proclaim
'Christ is born in Bethlehem!'

Hark! The herald angels sing
'Glory to the new born King!'

Christ, by highest heav'n adored
Christ the everlasting Lord;
Late in time behold him come
Offspring of a virgin's womb
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see
Hail th'incarnate Deity!
Pleased as Man with man to dwell;
Jesus, our Immanuel!

Hark! The herald angels sing, etc

Choir
Hail, the heav'nly Prince of Peace!
Hail, the Son of Righteousness!
Light and life to all He brings
Ris'n with healing in His wings
Mild He leaves His throne on high
Born that man no more may die;
Born to raise the sons of earth;
Born to give them sencond birth

Hark! The herald angels sing, etc

Come, Desire of nations, come
Fix in us Thy humble home;
Oh, to all Thyself impart
Formed in each believing heart!
Hark! The herald angels sing
'Glory to the new-born King;
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled.'
