Carol come outside
Wanna gonna go for a ride
We got an ice cream truck
And fireworks to light

With the music up
Loud as we can stand it
Roman candles in a vacant lot
We'll feel like bandits

In a stolen ice cream truck
On the wrong side of town
Sparklers out all the windows
Under shrill familiar sounds

Hazel stole some beer
You work the breaks i'll steer
Over fences and lawns
We'll drive around til the gas runs out

On look out for the cops
Binoculars made out of push up pops
All the missiles are melting
We'll give them away

Anna stole an ice cream truck
On the wrong side of town
High on stolen pills from her sister's treatment
I think it's gonna be pretty bad when we come down
