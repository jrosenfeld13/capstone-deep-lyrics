Sunday in Memphis it's hallelujah dawn
I can hear the angels singin'
Such a beautiful song
Lost here in Memphis
Feeling so alone
I can hear the church bells ringing
Callin' me back home
Down on my luck
Here on these sidewalks

It's Sunday in Memphis
And I'm down to my last prayer
Sunday in Memphis
And I'm wishing you were here

I can still remember
Every word she said
With every step that's taken
And every tear that's shed
Fell down on my knees
Said please forgive me lord won't you please

It's Sunday in Memphis
And I'm down to my last prayer
Sunday in Memphis
And I'm wishing you were here

We all make mistakes sometimes
That's just the way it goes
But we can change and make it right I know

It's Sunday in Memphis
And I'm down to my last prayer
Sunday in Memphis
And I'm wishing you were here
