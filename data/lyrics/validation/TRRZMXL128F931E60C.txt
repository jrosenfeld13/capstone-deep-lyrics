I was told that kite flying's for lovers
I was told that we can't share the covers
If you'd like me to
I'll try to be brave like you
I know you'd like me to
I'll try to be pretty too
I was told that you rest with another
Weren't you told son, that that's wrong by your mother?
If you'd like me to
I'll try to be brave like you
I know you'd like me to
I'll try to be pretty too
If what you mean's so true
Why let invertebrates cling to you?
If what you hold loves you
Why're you watching the horse pass you?
The Horse
