Credit cards, sealed lifts and covert sanitation
Processed meat and a national waste disposal system:
The scale of deception begs the question
What it is we're burying

Cosmetics, contact lenses and plastic surgery:
Bulk orders for yet more imperial finery
Double-glazing for phasing out suspicions
That this is really happening

It seems this season the cool kids
Are sporting white canes
And braille zines

And when I close my eyes
Am I invisible?
An embarrassed smile
And you assume I'm being rhetorical
But if I don't see it die
This animal is invincible
I won't catch your eyes tonight

I will stutter
Stutter
Stutter
Stutter
Stutter
Stutter
Stutter
Stutter
Stutter my way through naked poverty
Until I'm across the street safe
I justified giving my eyes to Stevie Wonder
With some spiel about a sense of wonder to discover
But I was hiding under cover of the excuse of helplessness

I fell in line with the cool kids
And spared my eyes
Instead of change

I just called to say
That someone moved my furniture around
And so i fell down
And I hatched a plan here sprawled on the ground

So hey
So what do you say
We pack our things and call it a day
So come round
Let's lose that frown
And you and I will leave this town
Behind
Leave this
Leave this town behind
Leave this
Leave this town
