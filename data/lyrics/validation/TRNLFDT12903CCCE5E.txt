Five foot nine, long legs clear up to there
High heel shoes, short skirt with her shoulders bare
It's easy to see she's got her style down pat
Got a way of walkin' like a wild bobcat
Well, you gotta love the Lord for makin' girls like that

She likes pickup trucks and longnecks
And she loves to dance
She can steal your heart in a second with a single glance
Skin tight jeans and a cowboy hat
Hit a boy harder than a baseball bat
Well, you gotta love the Lord for makin' girls like that

Well I wouldn't call myself a righteous man
But I thank heaven every chance I can
For sending Eve to Adam when this old world first began

Well, I wouldn't call myself a righteous man
But I thank heaven every chance I can
For sending Eve to Adam when this old world first began

You can find them on a city street or down a country road
Natural born beauties turning heads everywhere they go
Take your breath away like a tire gone flat
Make a man cry like a little spoiled brat
Well, you gotta love the Lord for makin' girls like that

Yes, you gotta love the Lord for makin' girls like that
Well, you gotta love the Lord for makin' girls like that

--- Instrumental to fade ---
Umm ummm
Girl
You gotto move on
Girl like that
Woo for making a girl like that
Making a girl like that
Umm emmm...
