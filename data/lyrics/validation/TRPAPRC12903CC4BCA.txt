You walk around, always screaming about
How you're trying to get your way
But you should just keep your fucking fat mouth shut
If you got nothing important to say

Because you...you got a lot to learn

All you do is bitch about the things in life that get you down
You never care for nobody else
If you saw how your life looks to me
I think you'd be ashamed of yourself

You live inside your fucked-up world
Talking loud with nothing to say
You got a lot to learn about your life
