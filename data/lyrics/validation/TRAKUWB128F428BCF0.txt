I've heard them lilting
?At are? you milking
And I've heard them lilting
Before light a-day

Now they are mourning
For all time a-lilting
The flowers of the forest
Are all ?wean? away

Sad they for the order
That sent them to the border
The English by guile
For once won the day

Now they are mourning
For all time a-lilting
The flowers of the forest
Are all ?wean? away

I've heard them lilting
?At are? you milking
And I've heard them lilting
Before light a-day

Now they are mourning
For all time a-lilting
The flowers of the forest
Are all ?wean? away
