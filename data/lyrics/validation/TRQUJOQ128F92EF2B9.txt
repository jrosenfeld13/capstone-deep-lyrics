Like Pack of Wolves
We hunted our preys at Nights
Why they put you to the holy ground
When you died?
I must get you out of there
Or your soul can not be saved

WAR - I am coming to take you back
WAR - Nothing can stop me now

I kill, destroy, hunt those people
Who did this to you
HIDE if you can, but you do it in vain
I'll crasp our soul and take you down
Eternal torment in burning Flames

We were together as one
By doing this to you
They have done it to me

I will see that day
When I am gonna make them pay
What they did to you is
What I will do to them

CHARGE!

BLOOD - WAR - DIE
