[Zack sings:]
You're set in so many ways
Dead set in so many ways
And you're free in so many ways
You can't stay locked up forever

[Both sing:]
You're set in so many ways
Dead set in so many ways
You're free in so many ways
You can't stay locked up forever

[Zack sings:]
A long time ago
I would've like to know
If I could break this case
That I would be OK, YEAH!!

[Both sing:]

You're set in so many ways
Dead set in so many ways
You're free in so many ways
You can't stay locked up forever

[Zack sings:]
But how would you even know?
When all you get is what you got?
So, how could you even know?
When all you get is what you...
...OH, is what you got?

You're set in so many ways
Dead set in so many ways
You're free in so many ways
I won't stay locked up forever!!!
