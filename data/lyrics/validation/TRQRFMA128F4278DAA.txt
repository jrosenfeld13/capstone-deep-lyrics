You gotta sing sing sing sing sing out loud
Don't matter if you stay on track
You gotta sing sing sing sing sing out loud
Don't you dare hold nothing back
I've been around for long enough to know that
Everybody needs to sing
No matter if you're all alone or surrounded
By a thousand people with a thousand things
You gotta sing sing sing sing sing out loud
Don't matter if you stay on track
You gotta sing sing sing sing sing out loud
Don't you dare hold nothing back
It' not about the way you look or what you do
As long as you are having fun
Because you know we're here
Together in the world
You'll never be the only one
You gotta sing sing sing sing si---ng
You gotta sing sing sing sing sing out loud
Don't matter if you stay on track
You gotta sing sing sing sing sing out loud
Don't you dare holding nothing back
Don't you dare hold nothing...
Don't you dare hold nothing...
Don't you dare hold nothing back
Don't you dare hold nothing...
Don't you dare hold nothing...
Don't you dare hold nothing back
