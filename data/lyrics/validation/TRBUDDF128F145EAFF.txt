[Chorus]
I won't cheat on you
I won't do it no more
Like I did before
I can't do it no more
I'm faithful to my baby
To cheat on you would be crazy
I can't cheat on you
I can't do it no more

[Verse 1]
I've been a cheater ever since I was twelve years old
Baby, baby, yeah, baby
But when I first laid eyes on you
I knew it was over for the other cuties, oh lady
I could cheat with girls from Amsterdam, but I'll never take the chance
'Cause I really love you, your style
There could be fine naked girls in the room
But I'm comin' home to you, 'cause you know I love you

[Chorus 2]
Girl, I love your big eyes, (I'm faithful to my baby)
You're my one special prize (To cheat on you would be crazy)
I won't cheat on you
I can't do it no more

[Verse 2]
To get respect, I know I had to show respect
That's why I'm by your side, goin' nowhere
Now that I'm with you, every girl wants a piece of my mind and soul
Can't have it
You know you really opened my eyes, even my father was surprised
How faithful I am to you
I tell them all to get away, 'cause I love you more each day
And my life is yours
Girl, you are my whole life

[Interlude: Raphael Saadiq + Skinny Black]
Saadiq, what's up, playboy?
You know what's up Skinny Black
What's up with that?
I can't be like you no more
What's wrong with me, man?
You got 'em all, you got this one, you got that one
You got four or five of 'em
You know I love them rigs
Now you see me, I gotta let all that go
'Cause you just can't have 'em all, you know what I'm sayin'
I heard ya, I hear ya

[Chorus 3]
'Cause I really love my baby, baby, ooh wee, baby
I'm faithful to my baby
I won't cheat on you
And to cheat on you would be so crazy, baby
To cheat on you would be crazy
Nobody could ever change my mind, lady, lady, I'll be crazy
I'm faithful to my baby
I won't cheat on you
And I'm comin' home every night, baby, baby
To cheat on you would be crazy
They could call me crazy, 'cause I love you, lady
I love you, lady, ooh baby, yeah

[Outro Chorus]
I won't cheat on you
I won't do it no more
Like I did before
I can't do it no more
(I can't do it no more, no, oh no)
I won't cheat on you
I won't do it no more
Like I did before
I can't do it no more
(No no no, baby)
I won't cheat on you
I won't do it no more
Like I did before
I can't do it no more
