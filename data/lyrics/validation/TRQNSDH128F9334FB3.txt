[Verse 1]
We're finally alone at last
Oh how I've waited for this day to come
There's just something about you that rubs me wrong
You're not worth my attention
I built this with my own two hands
If you could spare me the time
Stop using me as your next misconception

[Chorus]
I don't believe that everything
You've known about me is gone forever
And I won't forget the days
That we spent forever, it haunts me
I don't believe that everything
You've known about me is gone forever
And I won't forget the days
That we spent forever, it haunts me

[Verse 2]
It won't be long before you meet your end
You're nothing more than a passing trend
So keep those cameras rolling
You think I wouldn't remember?
You thought that I would lose faith in myself
You can spare me the lies
You don't believe in me
Your life's a contradiction

[Chorus]
I don't believe that everything
You've known about me is gone forever
And I won't forget the days
That we spent forever, it haunts me
I don't believe that everything
You've known about me is gone forever
And I won't forget the days
That we spent forever, it haunts me

[Verse 3]
We draw the line at being in your life
Here's to the man of the hour
We'll cast out problems aside
Cheers to your future, may they bury you alive

[Bridge]
Move!

[Chorus]
I don't believe that everything
You've known about me is gone forever
And I won't forget the days
That we spent forever, it haunts me
I don't believe that everything
You've known about me is gone forever
And I won't forget the days
That we spent forever, it haunts me
