Kept all the little things you wrote
Take them with me where I go
Keeps the darkness from the door
Makes me happy

Now I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head
Over you

Stand, let the winter warm your skin
It leaves you when you least expect
This is what you do to me

Now I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head
Over you

Now I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head
Over you
