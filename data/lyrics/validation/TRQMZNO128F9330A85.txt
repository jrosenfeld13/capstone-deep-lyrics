Can we sing a truly good song?
We should sing now you and I
For the children who live without music
In the land where songs have all died

They need food for empty bodies
We need love to fill our souls
They are small and dark and distant
We are big enough to know

Oh, is it all that real?
We see with all our eyes
But it's so hard to feel

If for us the sun is shining
They have one lone evening star
See the pictures in our paper
And we watch the pictures star

Oh, is it all that real
We see with all our eyes
But it's so hard to feel

So can we sing a truly good song?
We should sing now you and I
For the children who live without music
In the land where songs have all died

Oh, is it all that real?
We breathe enough to live
But it is so hard to feel
