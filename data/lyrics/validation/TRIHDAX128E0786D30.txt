Mmmmmm

Don't walk like you're scared again
That'll only make him angry
You're face only makes it seem
Like there's plenty of money comin' rollin' in

Don't stop and don't look around
You don't know where's he's aimin' no
If you've got pockets your gonna pay
So you can save your hope for judgement day

A ticket to take the bottom over the top
Mixed up and never knowing where to stop
To move half way up in this town
How can you go that low down low down

She looked up to the sky and then she
Praised the lord
Hands up and amen
Now she's waiting for the good times

Don't you try and understand
There is no explanation no
He needs your fear and he needs your cash
'Cause the brothers poor and the brothers bad

A ticket to take the bottom over the top
Mixed up and never knowing where to stop
To move half way up in this town
How can you go that low down low down

She looked up to the sky and then she
Praised the lord
Hands up and amen
Now she's waiting for the good times
Waiting for the good times

Mmmm mmmm oh yeah mmmm mmmm oh oh oh yeah

A ticket to take the bottom over the top
Mixed up and never knowing where to stop
To move right on up in this town
How can you go that low down low down

She looked up to the sky and then she
Praised the lord
Hands up and amen
Now she's waiting for the good times

She looked up to the sky and then she
Praised the lord
Hands up and amen
Now she's waiting for the good times hey

Waiting for the good times no
She's waiting for the good times
She's waiting for the good times hey
