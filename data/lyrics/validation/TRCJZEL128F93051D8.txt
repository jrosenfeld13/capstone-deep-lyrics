Face down in the dirt
I've crawled a thousand miles on my own
Weathered hands and wounded pride

It's hard to find the words
I've searched for all my life
It's a puzzle with the missing piece inside

Then the waves began to swell
And I'm going under
And the world came crashing down

You were the hand of the ocean, that pulled me to the shore
You were the heart of the distance, the love that broke the storm
You were the heat of evening, the arms that kept me warm
Now is this life I am living now you've gone?

Broken and deserted
Forgiven no, I have not earnt it yet
Too many ghosts still haunt your mind

Innocent still learning
This puzzle yeah, I'm still searching for
The missing piece that makes things right

Then the waves began to swell
And I'm going under
And the world came crashing down

You were the hand of the ocean, that pulled me to the shore
You were the heart of the distance, the love that broke the storm
You were the heat of evening, the arms that kept me warm
Now is this life I am living now you've gone?

What are we fighting for?
Broken and deserted
Forgiven no, I have not earnt it yet
I have not earnt it yet
