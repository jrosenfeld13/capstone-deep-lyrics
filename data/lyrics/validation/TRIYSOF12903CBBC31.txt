Reapet 2x
Huoh.. ouh ouh...
Womba-di-eh-oh...

CHORUS:
Wombada-eh-ah-eh-oh
All the people they sing
Wombada-eh-ah-eh-oh
Wombadi... Wombadi...
Wombada-eh-ah-eh-oh
It's a magical thing
Wombada-eh-ah-eh-oh
Wombadi... Wombadi...
The dark force came to destroy
The land of the living
With spear and sword
He tried to defeat all man and beast
Ohhh... and they were crying out in pain
It could never be the same without the magic words
Huoh.. ouh ouh...
Womba-di-eh-oh...
CHORUS
But then when all seemed lost
The people grabbed each others hands
And together they fought back the surrounding
Darkness
Ohhh... and they were crying out with joy
That it would never happen again if they said the magic words
CHORUS
