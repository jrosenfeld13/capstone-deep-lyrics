Michael Jackson - Shake Your Body

I don't know whats going happen to you baby
But I do know that I want you
You walk around this town with your head all up in the sky
And I do know that I want you
Let's dance, let's shout shout
Shake you body down to the ground

You tease me with your lovin'
To play hard to get
Cause you do know that I want ya
You walk around this town
With your head all up in the sky
And you do know that I want ya
You are the spark that lit
The fire inside of me
And you know that I love it
I need to do just something
To get closer to your soul
