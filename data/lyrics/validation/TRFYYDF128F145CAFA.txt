Oi
Maria mondou me dizer
Maria mondou me dizer
Nao (eu) quero falar com voce
Oi

She's just testing her wings
And if you give in to her, you'll be
Just another feather in her cap
She'll drop you in a flash

She's casting a spell
She's casting a spell
Well if she's casting a spell
I can cast one as well

So I said, no no no
I ain't falling for this

This girl is built to tease
She's only testing
The efficiency of her kiss

She's casting a spell
Well if she's casting a spell
I can cast one as well

She wants to check out how
You check out on her test-bed
Will you get in her book
Or will you go right to her head

She's casting a spell
Well if she's casting a spell
I can cast one as well

And so I cast it right back on her
Don't you know my luck
She fell under the influence
And then the thunder struck

Now we're casting a spell
We're casting a spell
You can cast one as well
