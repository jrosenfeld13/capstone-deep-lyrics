From time to time you get the sign
Move your body right next to mine

From day to day you get nowhere
Oh baby don't leave me there

Love dove on me
Love dove on me

And when you tell me pass it on
And I'll pass it on...

It's a chain reaction it never stop
What's on your mind
What's on your mind
(A chain reaction it never stop)
Think about you all the time
Oh baby what's on your mind
No sympathy dedicate it to memory

Oh turn it on treat me square
How can I be everywhere boy...

It's a chain reaction it never stop
What's on your mind
What's on your mind
(A chain reaction it never stop)
Think about you all the time
Oh baby what's on your mind

I'm down on my knees
Down on my knees

Love dove on me
Love dove on me

And when you tell me pass it on
I'll pass it on...

A chain reaction it never stop
What's on your mind
What's on your mind
(A chain reaction it never stop)
Think about you all the time
Oh baby what's on your mind
(A chain reaction it never stop)
Oh don't leave me there
Baby don't leave me there
(A chain reaction it never stop)
Don't leave me there
Don't leave me there
Don't leave me there
What's on your mind
What's on your mind
What's on your mind
What's on your mind......

(A chain reaction it never stop)
(A chain reaction it never stop)
(A chain reaction it never stop)
(A chain reaction it never stop)
(A chain reaction it never stop)
(A chain reaction it never stop)
