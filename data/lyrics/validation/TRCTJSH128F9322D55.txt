Crown whiskey
(Incomprehensible)
When you get on the whiskey
Let somebody else drive 'cause I'm
Trying to sober up, sober up, sober up
Let somebody else drive
2, 3, 4

Well, I heard it on the radio
In 6 O'clock news
They said you better not drive
When you get on the booze

The sheriff was on TV
Shaking his hand
Said, we're really cracking down
You better understand

When you get on the whiskey
Oh, when you get on the whiskey
Hey, when you get on the whiskey
Let somebody else drive

I started drinking on Friday
And by Saturday night
They had me blowing through a tool
Charged by DUI

Cuffed and buffed and done in the cell
I was trying to sober up and tell 'em myself

When you get on the whiskey
Oh, when you get on the whiskey
Hey, when you get on the whiskey
Let somebody else drive
I'll drive me home cousin

And forty eight hours is a long time to kill
In a room full of drunks, surrounded by steel
Hell's all they serve in a metro bar
So don't be drinking if you're driving your car

And you get on the whiskey
Oh, when you get on the whiskey
Hey, when you get on the whiskey
Let somebody else drive

I said, when you're on the crown whiskey
Let somebody else drive

Why don't you let John Anderson drive, oh, yeah
