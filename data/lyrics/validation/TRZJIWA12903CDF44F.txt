You're looking for something
But what could it be?
You look for a hero
Well don't look at me
You look for solutions
But there's none you can find
You believe in something
That's only in your mind
You're looking around you
But hate has made you blind
And you've spent the last ten years of your life
In this emergency

So please don't just sit there
Let's try to break out
From all the hatred
Suspicion and doubt
Try to change your life
That is no life at all
Try to break down the imaginary wall
And if you couldn't be bothered
Well then, my friend, you'll fall
And spend all the rest of your life
In this emergency
