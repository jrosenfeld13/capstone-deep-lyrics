Ah forever yours

Sometimes, when we're far apart
Where's my heart, you wonder
Do you think I ever would forget
All the things we own
I wrote this letter just to let you know

That I'm all alone
I couldn't sleep at all
Without your love
Darling, I miss you
I tossed and turned
Oh how my body yearned
Just to be with you
And for miles away
I write to say once more, I love you
I'll be home someday
Until then, I'll stay
Forever yours

Oh if its cold outside
Still m heart's in fire
And it keeps me warm at night
With only thoughts of you
And if you doubt me
You just have to know

That I'm all alone
I couldn't sleep at all
Without your love
Darling, I miss you
I tossed and turned
Oh how my body yearned
Just to be with you
And for miles away
I write to say once more, I love you
I'll be home someday
Until then, I'll stay
Forever yours
