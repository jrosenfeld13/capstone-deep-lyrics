Said you came from a mining town
But they closed the mining down
Said your daddy was a drinker
He had a picture of jesus on his sinker
Maybe i... maybe I'm coming for you tonight

This town's only five miles wide
Look everywhere there's a road sign
On tops and places to hide
And cops sit around hungry
Waitin to dine

Maybe i... maybe I'm coming for you tonight
Maybe i... maybe I'm coming for you tonight

Said you came from a mining town
They closed the mining down
Said your momma was a drinker
She had a picture of jesus on her sink and
Maybe i... maybe I'm coming for you tonight
Maybe i... maybe I'm coming for you tonight
Maybe i........ baby, I'm coming for you tonight
