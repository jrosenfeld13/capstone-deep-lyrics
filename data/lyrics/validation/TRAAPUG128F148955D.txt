Do you kiss your lover when you leave the house?
Is this the last time that you'll see him?
Are you sitting comfortable are you feeling proud?
Are you turning heads when you shout?

All my sorrows I give to you
All my pain and wasted years
I'm feeling tired so I'll have to go
It's a beautiful dynasty

Did you clip the mountains, fall into air?
Are you feeling a little scared?
Is there white rain, in your heart?
And does that make you what you are?

All my sorrows I give to you
All my pain and wasted years
I'm feeling tired so I'll have to go
It's a beautiful dynasty

It's so beautiful
It's so beautiful
It's so beautiful
It's so beautiful
It's all...

All my pain and wasted years
My pain and wasted years
My pain and wasted years
Are no better than nothing
