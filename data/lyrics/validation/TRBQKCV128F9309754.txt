Heels on her feet, swear she's in heat, flirtin' wit every man she sees
Her pants hangin' low, she never says no, everyone knows she's easy
Nasty put some clothes on, you lookin' stank
Nasty what's your problem, you should be ashamed

Hard...for women like me who try to have some intergrity
You make it hard...for girls like myself who respect themselves
And have dignity
