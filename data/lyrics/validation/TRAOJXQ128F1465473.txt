I give you everything
'Til songs of freedom come and take me for a little ride
Walkin' by in my lonely dreams
You say you feel forgotten well I'm sorry I haven't waken
And in these times I write about forgiveness
In the sand and I hope and pray
That it's here to stay

And there's a song I wrote for those who would like to sing
But I still play alone on these old heartstrings
'Cause how we tried and tried to make that perfect harmony
Wasn't it a shame, we never heard the same?
That's why in these times I
Write about forgiveness in the sand
And I hope and pray that it's here to stay

So when those birds fly south in the winter I have to go
Baby please don't cry it's the end of our long goodbye
And in these times I write about forgiveness in the sand
And I hope and pray that it's here to stay
It's alright, it's okay, it's here to stay

I give you everything
I gave you everything
