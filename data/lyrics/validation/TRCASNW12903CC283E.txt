Well I knew she was lonely, and I was alone
A stranger in a strange town, too far from home
Her eyes blue as diamonds, Her hair black as cole
I could feel her desire, Burning like fire, Right down to my sole

(Chorus)
In a moment of weakness, Who would have known
God was in heaven, You were at home
I could have easily fallen
Forgotten till dawn
But in a moment of weakness
Your love held strong

I could say I wasn't tempted, But that would be a lie
A man is only human, And she was so alive
Could have said it didn't matter, Thrown caution to the wind
Could have been in her arms, Truth is my heart wouldn't let me give in

(Chorus)
In a moment of weakness, Who would have known
God was in heaven
You were at home
I could have easily fallen
Forgotten till dawn
But in a moment of weakness
Your love held strong

In a moment of weakness, your love held strong. (END)
