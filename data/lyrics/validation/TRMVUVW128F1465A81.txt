So beauty's only skin deep baby
But when you touch me I don't care
All I know, when you're in deep baby
I just want to keep you there

I can't control my needing
You're all I hoped you'd be
I'm breathless from this feeling
This need's controlling me

The softer the touch
The more that I love you
The sweeter the kiss
The harder it hurts
The slower the hand
The faster I want you
It feels so good
Ooh it must be bad

And everytime I feel I'm winning
I quickly start to loose my head
Just one touch and it's soon beginning
You make a temple of my bed

I can't control my needing
You're all I hoped you'd be
I'm breathless from this feeling
This need's controlling me

The softer the touch
The more that I love you
The sweeter the kiss
The harder it hurts
The slower the hand
The faser I want you
It feels so good
Ooh it must be bad
The softer the touch
The more that I love you
The sweeter the kiss
The harder it hurts
The slower the hand
The faster I want you
It feels so good
Ooh it must be bad

Is it wrong, don't know just let it go
Can't say it's right, too weak to fight
My guilt is free when you're with me
Don't think I should but it feels so good

I can't control my needing
You're all I hoped you'd be
I'm breathless from this feeling
This need's controlling me

The softer the touch
The more that I love you
The sweeter the kiss
The harder it hurts
The slower the hand
The faster I want you
It feels so good
Ooh it must be bad
The softer the touch
The more that I love you
The sweeter the kiss
The harder it hurts
The slower the hand
The faster I want you
It feels so good
Ooh it must be bad
