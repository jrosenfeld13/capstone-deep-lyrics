India Rubber Man
How far can you bend
Way across the sea far and wide
Bending the rules now and then

India Rubber Man
How long can you extend
The more I stretch the more you ask
Illusion has no end

India Rubber Man
How high can you ascend
Up and up and disappear
I'll show you with my magic rope

India Rubber Man
How far will you go
I've really have no plans
I work in a medicine show
