I'm here to meet with You
Come and meet with me
I'm here to find You
Reveal Yourself to me

As I wait, You make me strong
As I long, You draw me to Your arms
As I stand and sing Your praise
You come, You come and fill this place
Won't You come, won't You come and fill this place

I'm here to meet with You
Come and meet with me
I'm here to find You
Reveal Yourself to me

As I wait, You make me strong
As I long, You draw me to Your arms
As I stand and sing Your praise
You come, You come and fill this place
Won't You come, won't You come and fill this place

As I wait, You make me strong
As I long, You draw me to Your arms
As I stand and sing Your praise
You come, You come and fill this place

As I wait, You make me strong
As I long, You draw me to Your arms
As I stand and sing Your praise
You come, You come and fill this place
Won't You come, won't You come and fill this place

Lord come, Lord come and fill this place

I'm here to meet with You
Come and meet with me
