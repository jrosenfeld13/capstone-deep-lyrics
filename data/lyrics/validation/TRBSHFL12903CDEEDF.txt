Sorry, I said I was sorry
There seems to be a problem
You have to listen closely
I can't change the perception

I thought that there was more to this
I was wrong
But everybody else still says how well

We get along
We get along

I remember a time when
We weren't always going our own ways
When we were alone we were never lonely
We were only apart

You ask me what was wrong and then suddenly everything was right
But I'll go along with this so i can say that we get along

We get along
We get along
We get along

Sorry, I said I was sorry
There seems to be a problem
You gave me an answer
To a different question

And I will wait here endlessly to respond
While everybody else still says how well

We get along
We get along
We get along
We get along
