Stigma
Fury
Throw him
Bound and gagged upon soil
The red sun
Burning
Burning
Tear the soul of God's only son

Inhuman is elite
Anger
Release my breath
The violence burns in me
The words I speak to him of suffocating dark

Poison
Blind eye
Lashing
Bleeding shadows on the sun
The madness
Swirling
Swirling
Iesous

Constant suffering
Heaving breath
Cross hangs twisted round his neck

Eeso
Yeshua
Iesous

Absorb now this pain
Spirit encaged
All hope is slain
Die by our rage
