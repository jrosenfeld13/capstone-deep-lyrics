On a midnight train to Laredo
Four aces stepped aboard
Gonna find a Laredo rose
Find out who was she chose

She is in love with a bearded singer
He come from Texas way
Said his name was Willy
And I don't mean 'Say Hey'

One had an accordion in his left
A cold beer in his right
One was a hippy
Completely out of sight

One was a border singer
From San Benito they say
One had a pony tale
They shuffled along that day

Four aces going nowhere
Riding gently toward the sun
Four aces going nowhere
Never meant to hurt no one

Willie sought but he could not find her
'Cause Zimmys was in town
He's drinking at the cantina
He ordered up another round

His vato went down for his pistola
I thought we were dead
But as luck would have it
Enter one grateful Fred

Four aces going nowhere
Riding gently toward the sun
Four aces going nowhere
Never meant to hurt no one

The tale of the Texas story
Is read quite well by all
This border queen had something
That made meses hombres fall

Like strings of a sweet corridor
The story is the same
She just won a bundle
On the Texas lotto fame

Four aces going nowhere
Riding gently toward the sun
Four aces going nowhere
Never meant to hurt no one
