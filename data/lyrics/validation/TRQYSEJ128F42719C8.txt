Well, you gave me your number
I wrote it on my kitchen wall
And I've been gettin' these signals every time I call
See what this game you're playin'
It ain't no fun at all

Tell me, what's it gonna take to make you love me?
What's it gonna take to make you mine?
What do I have to do to make you want me?
All of the time

Is there a mystery I haven't discovered?
Is there a magic word I need to say?
Is there a way to spark a fire in your heart?
What's it gonna take?

Baby, when we're out ridin' in my old Chevrolet
You kept me slow and you started
With all the things you say
You act like you want to kiss me
But baby it's flyin' away

Tell me, what's it gonna take to make you love me?
What's it gonna take to make you mine?
What do I have to do to make you want me?
All of the time

Is there a mystery I haven't discovered?
Is there a magic word I need to say?
Is there a way to spark a fire in your heart?
What's it gonna take?

What's it gonna take to make you love me?
What's it gonna take to make you mine?
What do I have to do to make you want me?
All of the time

Is there a mystery I haven't discovered?
Is there a magic word I need to say?
Is there a way to spark a fire in your heart?
What's it gonna take?

Is there a way to spark a fire in your heart?
What's it gonna take?
