What a beautiful day
Im enjoying the breeze, enjoying the coffee
What a beautiful sense of the world you and I have
What is it darling

Dont get into that now weve got nothing but time
Can we get through the morning please

Did you see what the cat did
He laid on his back with his paws in the air
And he wanted to play
And he wanted to play with me

But I was dealing with this, dealing with that
Righting a wrong
Pushing myself throught the dirt like a weed
And then getting stepped on

Oh what a slow burning night its a hot one for sure
If it rains well be lucky
Is that sex in your eyes
Is it time to get down, time to get funky

Lose the glasses my love
I could sure use a drink
Is it caught on the pillow

Did you see what the cat did
He laid on his back with his paws in the air
And he wanted to play
And he wanted to play with me

But I was dealing with this, dealing with that
Righting a wrong
Pushing myself throught the dirt like a weed
And then getting stepped on

Oh youve caught me in my Monday morning

Ive been making the rounds
Every symptom is real
Every secret a circus
In the kitchen it hangs with the birds
And the sky and the ocean and I
In the photo you can see
In the corner thats me in all my glory

Dealing with this, dealing with that
Righting a wrong
Pushing myself throught the dirt like a weed
And then getting stepped on

Oh youve caught me in my Monday morning

Dealing with that
Righting a wrong
Pushing myself throught the dirt like a weed
And then getting stepped on
