Watch the lines goin' faster on the highway
Got my bourbon by my side
I'm on a liquor slicked highway
I'll be a gypsy 'til the day I die
Got a couple dollars in my pocket
On a Greyhound bus I ride
Wonder where I'll find a place to crash
I'll pass out with my microphone by my side
I never sleep, I just pass out
In the back of a bus I'm high
I live fast and I live alone
I'll be a loner 'til the day I die
Day I die
Don't understand me, don't even try
You never will, I keep it inside
Riding down a liquor slicked highway
Gonna do it 'til the day I die
It's not a game, it's very serious
I sing my songs on distaster slides
I'm feelin' crazy, I'm feelin' empty
I'm feelin' cold 'til the day I die
Day I die
On a Greyhound Bus I ride
Riding down a liquor slicked highway
I'm gonna do it 'til the day I die
Gonna do it 'til the day I die
Day I die
Liquor slicked highway
I got Jim by my side
It's not a game, it's only serious
I'm on a liquor ride
I'm gonna do it 'til the day I die
See ya
