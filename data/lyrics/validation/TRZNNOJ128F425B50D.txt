Walking up the hill tonight
And you have closed your eyes
I wish I didn't have to make
All those mistakes and be wise
But please try to be patient
I know that I'm still learning
I'm sorry that you have to see
The strength inside me burning

Where are you my angel now?
Don't you see me crying?
And I know that you can't do it all
But you can't say I'm not trying
I'm on my knees in front of him
But he doesn't seem to see me
But all his troubles on his mind
He's looking right through me
And I'm letting myself down
By satisfying you
And I wish that you could see
I have my troubles too

Looking at you sleeping
I'm with a man I know
I'm sitting here weeping
While the hours pass so slow
And I know that in the morning
I'll have to let you go
And you'll be just a man
Once I used to know
But for these past few days
Someone I don't recognize
This isn't all my fault
When will you realize?

Looking at you leaving
I'm looking for a sign
