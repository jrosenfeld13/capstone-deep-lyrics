Morrow
The day of dark
In my sorrow I am engulfed
My fear showed
My forever needed spark

Gone is my fear for not having it all
Here now and forever
Yet I'm still hearing her calls
For my wicked needs but I will never answer
Dead now is Satan's daughter

She sucked the marrow out of my life
But still her I was feeding
God's beloved Satan's wife
I was breeding

She's gone down below
But I'm no longer at her side
And I'm drunk with the love
Of the dead who is my bride

I married the dark
From which I was born
Like an infant I cried
She gave me the spark
From which I was torn
Like an elder I died
I'll never believe
And I never will see
Her face again
My burning desires
Burns deep in hellfire
I will rise in the end
