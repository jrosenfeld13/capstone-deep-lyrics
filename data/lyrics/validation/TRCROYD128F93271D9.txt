Oh, along the rocks
It's good, it's not so hard now
Oh, I bite my tongue, who cares?
This chance to drop off

All that you left, you left for someone
All of this hurt that's wilted off
All this relief, it's the oddest thing
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God

All that you left, you left for someone
All of this hurt that's wilted off
All this relief, it's the oddest thing
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God

Chen, he'll never come
That's fine, I lost my thought
Wei Huai could talk me down
Still, still, this chance to drop off

All that you left, you left for someone
All of this hurt that's wilted off
All this relief, it's the oddest thing
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God

All that you left, you left for someone
All of this hurt that's wilted off
All this relief, it's the oddest thing
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God

All that you left, you left for someone
All of this hurt that's wilted off
All this relief, it's the oddest thing
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God

All that you left, you left for someone
All of this hurt that's wilted off
All this relief, it's the oddest thing
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God
