You're a vision, the girl of my dreams
All I ever wanted, all that I need

I should be thankful, for all that I've got
I should be falling, but baby I'm not

Cause I've got a haunted heart
Baby she's still inside of me
I wanna make a new start
These walls are high around me
I can't seem to break free (from this haunted heart)

Back in the distance, lost in the past
If love is forever, why didn't it last

I'm telling you baby, I would give anything
To return all the love, that you've given to me

Cause I've got a haunted heart
Baby she's still inside of me
I wanna make a new start
These walls are high around me
I can't seem to break free (from this haunted heart)
I've got to break free (oh yeah)

Oh oh oh, I know it hurts you
Oh oh oh, you can't get close
Oh oh oh, I wish that I could just let her go
Just let her go
