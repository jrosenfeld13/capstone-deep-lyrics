[Intro]
In the morning, I raise my head
And I'm thinking of days gone by
And the thing I want out of life is

[Chorus]
I want you (I want you)
I want you (I want you)

[Verse 1]
You can run, you can hide
But you'll never get away
You can lie and deny
But you know you're gonna pay

[Pre-Chorus]
Never loved, never thought you could
Treat you right, girl, you know I would
You can fight, but tonight
There's nothing you can do

[Chorus]
I want you (I want you)
Baby, baby, babe, I want you (I want you)

[Verse 2]
You can walk in a haze
You can travel 'til you die
You can live in a dream
And your life will pass you by

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day that you hesitate
You're never changing the hands of fate
You can fight, but tonight
There's nothing you can do

[Chorus]
I want you (I want you)
Baby, baby, babe, I want you (I want you)

[Bridge]
In the morning, I raise my head
And I'm thinking of days gone by
And the thing I want out of life is

[Chorus]
I want you (I want you)
Baby, baby, babe, I want you (I want you)

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, babe, I want you (I want you)
Baby, baby, babe, I want you (I want you)

[Chorus]
I want you (I want you)
I want you (I want you)

[Chorus]
I want you (I want you)
I want you (I want you)

[Outro]
Ah (I want you)
(I want you)
