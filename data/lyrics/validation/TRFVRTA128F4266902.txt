Well I've been out walking
I don't do that much talking these days
These days
These days I seem to think a lot
About the things that I forgot to do
Nd all the times I had the chance to
And I had a lover
I don't think I'll risk another these days
These days
Now if I seem to be afraid
To live the life that I have made in song
Well it's just cause I've been losing so long
I quit my scheming
I don't do all that dreaming these days
These days
These days I sit on corner stones
And count the time in quarter tones to ten
Don't confront me with my failures
I have not forgotten them
