Well this world is hard and no one gives a shit
To help anyone or give them their just pay
There ain't no hand out and they take more than they give
And you find you're going crazier each day
And the one you love, you're torturing
cause all that fucking pressure leaves a whipping sting
And you will know when you've nowhere else to go
That you got to turn to something that's enlightening

So I'm going down, going down to Leopardstowns
When the horses run a flat, for I'm flat broke I'm going down
Where the wine and whiskey flow, leave the ladies all aglow
Back to wander Francis Street in the morning
Back to wander Francis Street in the morning

Well I've just got to be strong, cause it's lasted so long
The sadness now that has me in its grip
Well I'm completely worn of thinking I have to conform
And I have to give this stale life the slip
But I love you, that's why it's so hard to
Leave, but I know I have to be strong
To create a new dynamic of our lives, to try to cut the pain and strife
Well don't give up on me, for I won't be always gone

So I'm going down, going down to Leopardstowns
When the horses run a flat, for I'm flat broke I'm going down
Where the wine and whiskey flow, leave the ladies all aglow
Back to wander Francis Street in the morning
Back to wander Francis Street in the morning
