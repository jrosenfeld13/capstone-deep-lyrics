Carve your name on my door
You can say you've been here before
Get down and learn the law - on your own
Then take it back home

By your side all night long
There were times when I didn't know
If I should come and go - roll slow
Or take it back home

And you can send it in a letter
You'd better let it be known
You can ride it but don't fight it
Feel it but don't leave it alone
You can shake it but don't break it
It won't be long and you'll be gone
Out of my mind

Dry your eyes one more time
Sing a song while your tears dry
Sad songs will never die so cry
Then take it back home

Pack your bags don't be long
I don't mind if you've come or gone
I'll just carry on on my own
Then take it back home

And you can send it in a letter
You'd better let it be known
You can ride it but don't fight it
Feel it but don't leave it alone
You can shake it but don't break it
It won't be long and you'll be gone
Out of my mind
