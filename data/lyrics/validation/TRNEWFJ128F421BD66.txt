I remember waking in the morning
To the sound of a rooster's crow
Mama cooking in the kitchen
And Arthur Godfrey on the radio

Me and dad were just like strangers
We never did see eye to eye
It came to blows one Sunday morning
So I packed my bags and I said goodbye

And when you leave that way you can never go back
A train won't run on a torn up track
Some times I wish I'd never roamed, oh no
Cause when you leave that way you can never go home

Then I met a girl in Knoxville
Oh we set our wedding date
Left her standing at the altar
With a baby on the way...

And when you leave that way you can never go back
A train won't run on a torn up track
Some times I wish I'd never roamed, oh no
Cause when you leave that way you can never go home

Lord I'd love to see my Mom and Daddy
And what I'd give to hold that boy of mine
I'd get down on my knees and say I'm sorry
If I could only go back one more time
But I killed a man in Houston
When he caught me with his wife
And I told the preacher man to leave me alone
When he came to read my rights
And he said son

When you leave that way you can never come back
A soul won't roll on a torn up track
All through eternity you'll roam alone
Cause when you leave that way you can never come home
All through eternity you'll roam alone
Cause when you leave that way you can never come home
