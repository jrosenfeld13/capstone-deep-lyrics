[Verse 1]
If time has no end and if time has no end
A billion years a trillion years what then is infinity
A circle an eternal loop
It can drive you crazy searching for the truth

[Chorus]
Someday will we know all about it
Have no reason to doubt it
Someday

[Verse 2]
Before we were babies
There's nothing we recall and when we go back
Will it fade to black and that's all
Or could we be destined for some other time and place
And have we lived other lives our memories have erased

[Chorus]
Someday will we know all about it
Have no reason to doubt it
Someday

[Verse 3]
Will we see Jesus coming as the sunshine fills the night
Or when we die will we fly into the light
Will we all be reunited with the ones who've gone away
And will we love each other the way we do today I believe
Someday we'll know all about it
Have no reason to doubt it
Someday
