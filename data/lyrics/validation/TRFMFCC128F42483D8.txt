I'll always hate you
For the way
You never understood
Even if you tried
Even if you could
You'll never know the same
The way it really feels
I'll have to show the world
I'm hiding all my fears
Acting like a bad ass
Making up for what I had
Let's go out and drink some booze
My tattoo says, "I'm Born to Lose"
Beating kids, having fun
With a knife or a gun
Show them all how big I am
Slam another tall boy can
I'll show the world how cool I am
Pretending that I'm hard
Because I can't face who I am
It left me in a bind
When you went away
I tried to call my friends
But they said I'm not the same
So now I've got to show
The world just how I feel
Go under any low
To raise my self appeal
Since the day you left
I threw away my self-respect
Blame the world for what you did
All the bullshit that I had
Shave my head
Smoking crack
Drawing foremost heart attack
Beat a gun out from a whore
See you at the liquor store
I'll show the world who cool I am
It's not too hard to understand
That I'm blaming the world
For what happened to me
Maybe a bullet in my head
Will make me see
