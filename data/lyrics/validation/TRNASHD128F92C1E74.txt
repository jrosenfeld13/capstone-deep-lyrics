Monday
Seventeen degrees
The shadows disappear
All around you, dear
Until it's loud and clear

Isn't it the truth?
The whole truth
Nothing but the truth
So help me
The whole truth
Nothing but the truth
So help me, God

I'm the bad guy
Waiting in the wings
And the key light hat
All my words fall flat
But I'm used to that

Getting to the truth
The whole truth
Nothing but the truth
So help me
The whole truth
Nothing but the truth
So help me, God

Baby, if you want to talk
I'll be there to listen
Neither rain, not hail
Or sleet or snow
But Cahuenga is stop and go
This much I do know

All I want's the truth
The whole truth
Nothing but the truth
So help me
The whole truth
Nothing but the truth
So help me, God

Baby, if you want to talk
I'll be there to listen
(Neither rain, not hail)
(Or sleet or snow)
Baby, if you want to talk
(Neither rain, not hail)
(Or sleet or snow)
