Is it ok if I should stay here at home and in my bed
So warm and dark a womblike ark
So my clothes never get to tight
And my worldview of toys and shoes
Can occupy my closed off mind
Reposed and tired trapped in the mire
Muting out the truth that knocks Wake up oh sleeper you know that its time
You know that you've fashioned a monster inside
I'll help you destroy it
You've always been mine
I'm not growing up inside

So close to rope I cleared my throat
Thought I had no chance for life
But hangman's slack my father's back
And calling through my reverie

Wake up oh sleeper you know that its time
You know that you've fashioned a monster inside
I'll help you destroy it
You've always been mine
I'm not growing up inside

I'll help you destroy it

I'm not growing up inside

Give me a window give me light
In the solemn hope I might
Make it to the other side to the other side
