Oh my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me
Lonely rivers flow to the sea
To the sea
To the open arms of the sea
Yeah
Lonely rivers sigh "Wait for me"
Wait for me
I'll be coming home
Wait for me
Oh my love, my darling
I've hungered
Hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
And time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine
I need your love, I
I need your love
God speed your love to me
