Love makes the world go round
But the world is slowing down
It's such a stormy place
Standing
I'll shake the ground
Gonna take a look around
Then I saw your face, oh

Since I met you
It's such a perfect world
What a boy and girl can't find
What they need to do for a life of love
Such a perfect world
It's mine
It's a perfect world

I had to spread the news
I finally got my dancing shoes
Now I realized
Just take a different view
Just comes shining down on you
Let's open up our eyes

Since I met you
It's such a perfect world
What a boy and girl can't find
What they need to do for a life of love
Such a perfect world
It's mine
It's a perfect world

Sunshine and flowers
Ain't nothing gonna stop the way we feel
We've got the power
Yes, we do

Love makes the world go round
Love turned you upside down
Love across a million miles
No chance I won't take
When my feet are on the brake
With you here by my side

Since I met you
It's such a perfect world
What a boy and girl can't find
What they need to do for a life of love
Such a perfect world
It's mine
It's a perfect world
