Living on a diet of chocolates and cigarettes
I wanna call you again
I'll drink tea sometimes when it's cold
It's getting old, I call you again

Still too young to fail
Too scared to sail away
But one of these days
I'll grow old, and I'll grow brave and I'll go
One of these days

Blowing out the candles from my cake
I choke on the smoke as I look around the room
Everybody's wishing for no more mistakes
And all that I can think about is you

Still too young to fail
Too scared to sail away
But one of these days
I'll grow old, and I'll grow brave and I'll go
One of these days

La da
La da, da da, da da
La da, da da
La da da, da da, la da
La da, da da

Still too young to fail
Too scared to sail away
But one of these days
I'll grow old, and I'll grow brave and I'll go
One of these days

La da da da da da
La da da da da da
La da da da da
Da da da
