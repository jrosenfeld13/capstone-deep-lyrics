It's sorry business, how I had to let you go
No time to look back now / the truth we'll never know
The past we shared is somehow bitter sweet to taste
Too bad I walked out, but I had no time to waste

The constant aggravation of two stubborn hearts / one home
The then the realization I'm your property to own
The many nights spent fighting have turned both our hearts to stone
And now it's time to leave to set upon my future alone /

[Chorus]
BUT NO MATTER HOW LONG
NO MATTER HOW FAR I GO
I'LL STILL REMEMBER YOU
I MISS YOU, I MISS YOU, SO LONG

I start to choke back on the words I've left unsaid
But I can't go back with all this fight stuck in my head
Don't want to cry but I know deep inside my bones
It coulda worked somehow, but now we'll never know

Mixed between confusion and the jealousy you've shown
I found a heart that aches for me with love I've never known
But many nights spent fighting have turned both our hearts to stone
So now it's time to leave to set upon my future alone

[Chorus]
Mixed between confusion and the jealousy you've shown
I found a heart that aches for me with love I've never known
But many nights spent fighting have turned both our hearts to stone
So now it's time to leave to set upon my future alone

[Chorus]
