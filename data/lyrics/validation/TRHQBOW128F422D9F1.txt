Far away from you
Disgusting subhuman fuck
You think you rule the world
Up my ass, tough luck!

I have my world here
You think you are right
But you can't touch me here
The forest is cold and white

Maximum distance to your idiocy
While you read and study a book
Yes, you are in many and crazy
Like flies to a pile of shit

I have my world here
You think you are right
You can't fool me now
My world is cold and white
My world is cold and white

Far away from you
Disgusting subhuman fuck
You think you rule the world
Up my ass, tough luck!

I have my world here
You think you are right
But you can't touch me here
The forest is cold and white

Maximum distance to your idiocy
While you read and study a book
Yes, you are many and crazy
Like flies to a pile of shit
