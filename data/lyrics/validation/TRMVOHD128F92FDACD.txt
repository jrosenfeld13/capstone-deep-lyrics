I wasted too much time
Trying to read the signs
I've been so afraid to speak my mind
Too afraid to know

Maybe you weren't the one
Maybe I was wrong
If we were never meant to be together
How can it feel so strong

I'm changing
I'm not weak like before
I'm changing
I won't take it anymore

[Chorus]
You better love me or let me go
Either way I gotta know
Oh baby now if this is what, it seems to be
Give my heart back to me
You better love me or let me be
Hey give it all or set me free
Oh baby now the time has come
For you to show
You better love me
Or let me go

Don't wanna cry in vain
Love has been a lonely lonely game
Time to break the chain
When you say love me
You never look in my eyes
Is it because that deep inside you know
It's just a bunch of lies

[Chorus]
You better love me or let me go
Either way I gotta know
Oh baby now if this is what, it seems to be
Give my heart back to me
You better love me or let me be
Hey give it all or set me free
Oh baby now the time has come
For you to show
You better love me
Or let me go

It's not too late to turn things round again
Somehow it feels too soon to say goodbye
I'm changing
I won't take it anymore

[Chorus]
You better love me or let me go
Either way I gotta know
Oh baby now if this is what, it seems to be
Give my heart back to me
You better love me or let me be
Hey give it all or set me free
Oh baby now the time has come
For you to show
You better love me
Or let me go

You better love me or let me go
