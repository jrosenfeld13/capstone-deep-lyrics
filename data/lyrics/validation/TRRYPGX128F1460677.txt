To everything turn turn turn
There is a season turn turn turn
And a time for every purpose under heaven

A time to be born a time to die
A time to plant a time to reap
A time to kill a time to heal
A time to laugh a time to weep

To everything turn turn turn
There is a season turn turn turn
And a time for every purpose under heaven

A time to build up a time to break down
A time to dance a time to mourn
And a time to cast away stones a time to gather stones together

To everything turn turn turn
There is a season turn turn turn
And a time for every purpose under heaven

A time of love a time of hate
A time of war a time of peace
And a time you may embrace a time to refrain from embracing

To everything turn turn turn
There is a season turn turn turn
And a time for every purpose under heaven

A time to gain a time to lose
A time to rend a time to sew
A time to love a time to hate
A time for peace I swear it's not too late

To everything turn turn turn
There is a season turn turn turn
And a time for every purpose under heaven
