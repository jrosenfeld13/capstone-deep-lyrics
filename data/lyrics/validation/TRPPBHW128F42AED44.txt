I am not important
I am a broken man
Throw myself on your mercy
You who have wronged me

I built my life in vainglory
I lost sight of the light
Where once I walked down streets of gold
I stumble through the darkness

I offer you my broken image
On the alter of your hatred for me
It's a phantom it is nothing
But it's all I have to give

Every word we say is crucial
A lie to avoid a lie
Can we bridge the gap between us?
Will you pray with me?

Could you use some quiet?
Can you perform an exorcism?
You numbed you conscience with sanctimony
I numbed mine with narcissism

I surrender to you
You who I so long despised
I will expect nothing
Believing you to be kind

Can you accept me shattered?
Can you speak with one who is no one?
This must all be kept in context
And Yesenia gets a book deal
