With ideas in my hands and a head full of plans
Should I keep my cool, sit on my hands
And just wait, and just wait, and just wait, and just wait, and just wait
I said wait a second and you left in a flash
You said Ive got the brains but youve got the cash
And Ill pay, and ill pay, and ill pay, and ill pay, and ill pay

So we told a few lies just to cut around the corners
When the princess at the door says Murilo I love you
The horses on the floor as the show goes on around him
And the newspapers report Murilo I love you
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

So you chase the questions as I spring the traps
Draw up an escape plan, stick pins in the maps
On our way, on our way, on our way, on our way, on our way
And theyre all growing up and Im still getting high
See its hard to see straight through the red i my eyes
But Ill try, and Ill try, and Ill try, and Ill try, and Ill try

So we told a few lies just to cut around the corners
When the princess at the door says Murilo I love you
The horses on the floor as the show goes on around him
And the newspapers report Murilo I love you
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

So we told a few lies just to cut around the corners
When the princess at the door says Murilo I love you
The horses on the floor as the show goes on around him
And the newspapers report Murilo I love you
