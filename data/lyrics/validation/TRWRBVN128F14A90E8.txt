The way you move when we touched
Is like fire in my arm, baby
And when we kiss with our lips touched
It makes me crazy, deep inside

When we hold, like we hold
It seem forever and a day since I was [Incomprehensible]

But Jesus loves the way you walk
And Jesus loves the way you talk

The way you walked into the room
It's electric, so refined
When you laugh, it's hard, to me
Than I could ever give to you

When we see all we can
We are defined without sign

But Jesus loves the way you walk
And Jesus loves the way you talk
But Jesus loves the way you walk
And Jesus loves the way you talk

When I die, it's not forever
When I'm gone you won't remember, remember

But Jesus loves the way you walk
Jesus loves the way you talk, yeah
But Jesus loves the way you walk
Jesus loves the way you talk
