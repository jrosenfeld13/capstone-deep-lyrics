And for awhile can feel the heat
Praise to the liquor that warms our heads
Gives us the courage
To get things said

Loosens our tongues

And for a time can feel the heat
Praise to the liquor that warms our heads
Give us the courage

Loosens our tongues
And for awhile
Well, you might even make each other smile
