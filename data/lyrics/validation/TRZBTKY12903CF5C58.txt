You and I have such good times
And I know that's hard to find
I would never take for granted
What you give to me
So don't you ever think I would mess around
You don't have to worry
You don't have to worry about me

You're the only one
That makes me feel this way
You turn something inside of me
You're the only one
That takes my breath away
When it comes to my heart
You're the only one

Only you can reach my heart
Feel my soul when we're apart
Cause even when we're not together
I'm true to you
So don't think I don't know you've been hurt before
You don't have to worry
You don't have to worry about me

You're the only one
That makes me feel this way
You turn something inside of me

You're the only one
That takes my breath away
When it comes to my heart, baby

You're the only one
That makes me feel this way
You turn something inside of me

You're the only one
That takes my breath away
When it comes to my heart
You're the only one

You're the only one
That makes me feel this way
You turn something inside of me

You're the only one
That takes my breath away
When it comes to my heart, baby

You're the only one
That makes me feel this way
You turn something inside of me

You're the only one
That takes my breath away
When it comes to my heart
You're the only one

You're the only one
When it comes to my heart
You're the only one
The one can make me feel this way

You're the only one
Yeah, that ever touch my heart
You're the only one
Baby, you're the only one
