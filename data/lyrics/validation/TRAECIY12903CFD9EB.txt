Long before I was 12 I would read by myself
Archie, josie, super-heroes
I would read them by myself
I had the stars on my wall

14 was a gas for me
Batman on tv
I would cheer the super-heroes
They were all I wanted to be
I had the stars on my wall

18 I was guaranteed
I would lose my teenage dream
But it's so funny how I got to look
Like all the people in my comic books
Now I'm a star on my wall
