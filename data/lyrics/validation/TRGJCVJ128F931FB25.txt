I can talk for hour until it hurts
Until it comes and takes you out of the dirt
You can say: it's not right
But letting go? it won't get you far
And i still know
I gotta get in, i gotta get out
I gotta get in, gotta get out of something
It's gonna be great
For charlotte and kate
I gotta get in, gotte get out of something
Something
I can make it work love
I can let it roll
But everything's just getting out of control
You always take the good part
You always will
But it won't get you far
I know still
Chorus
And she lays down, down low
And she cries until she leaves you
On a day like this you might sweat it out
Now
Chorys
