Lately I find myself
Amazed
And all around me
Everything I see

Like all of life a blaze
With love
That suddenly I see
Only now I see

The wonder
The wonder of it all

Wonder everywhere
More than we know
Heaven's not up there
But on earth below

The wonder
The wonder of it all

Wonder everywhere
More than we know
Heaven's not up there
But on earth below

Don't know if God exists

But there's some magic out there
So much we're not aware
And sometimes suddenly
I hear (I hear)
A harmony sing
Of each and everything

The wonder
The wonder of it all

Wonder everywhere
More than we know
Heaven's not up there
But on earth below
