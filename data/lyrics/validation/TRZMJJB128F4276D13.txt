[Spoken intro]
Four for a pound your face flannels, three for a pound your tea towels!
Four for a pound your face flannels, three for a pound your tea towels!

[Verse 1]
I hear a gang fight on a human factory farm
Are they howling out, or doing somebody harm?
On a catwalk jungle, somebody grabbed my arm
A voice spoke so cold it matched the weapon in her palm

[Chorus]
This is England
This knife of Sheffield steel
This is England
This is how we feel

[Verse 2]
Time on his hands the freezing mohawk strolls
He won't go for the carrots
Been beaten by the pole
Some sunny day confronted by his soul
His eye will see how fast you can grow old

[Chorus]
This is England
That I'm supposed to die for
This is England
Never gonna cry no more

[Verse 3]
Black shadow of the Vincent
Falls on a Triumph line
I got my motorcycle jacket
But I'm walking all the time
South Atlantic wind blows
Ice from a dying creed
I see no glory
And when will we get free?

[Chorus]
This is England
We can chain you to the rail
This is England
We can kill you in a jail

[Verse 4]
Hey, British boots go kick Bengali in the head
Police sit watching
The newspapers being read
All deaf to protests
And after the attacker fled
Out came the batons and
The biggest one then said

[Outro]
This is England
The land of illegal dances
This is England
Land of one thousand stances
This is England
This knife of Sheffield steel
This is England
This is how we feel
This is England
This is England
