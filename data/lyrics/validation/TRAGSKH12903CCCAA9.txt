She said, "Andy what you doing on the mountain?"
She said, "Now, Andy, what you doing on the air?"
And he said, "Andy doesn't live upon the mountain."
"If you're looking for Andy,"
"You'll be looking everywhere."

So don't call me Andy
No don't call me Andy
No don't call me Andy
And don't call me Anne

When something's covered
Does it just go away?
Or does it just hover
Behind the veil of today?

And she said, "You don't,"
"You don't have any houses."
And he said, "No, you don't,"
"You don't have any home"

So don't call me Andy
No don't call me Andy
No don't call me Andy
And don't call me Anne

So don't call me Andy
No don't call me Andy
No don't call me Andy
And don't call me Anne
