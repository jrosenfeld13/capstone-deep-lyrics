I'm workin 40 hours
And more if i can get it
Still need an extra job so i can get more credit
Well i work hard because we charged
Tommorrow yesterday i'm in debt way over my head
The American way

Chorus
It's already spent
Every dime i'll ever make
From the high cost of living
And what the government takes
I don't have to worry or wonder where it went
I sleep like a baby cause it's already spent

I hear 'em talkin' on TV
Bout where we should invest stocks bonds mutual funds 401s and rest
Well my retirement plan's a coffee can and it's full of IOU's
My money goes to those i owe
And i bet yours does too

Repeat chorus

Yeah it's already spent every dime
We'll ever make from the high cost of livin
And what the government takes
We don't have to worry or wonder where it all went
We sleep like babies cause it's already spent
We'll sleep just like babies cause it's already spent
Every last dime
