I've heard misfortune blossoms
And wasted ways before me by the cause
Of givin' someone time enough for spendin'
Love only borrowed

And I've placed myself at ease
Listenin' to the lies and self-belief
For wantin' somethin' close enough for keepin'
A far cry from here

But I believe in wastin' the years
Speakin' of the deer who has been spared
Innocence so near
A far cry from here

Even still, the night is passin'
Behind a heart an emptiness still follows
Distance stands the swallow's heart from lendin' me
Love only borrowed

But I believe in wastin' the years
Speakin' of the deer who has been spared
Innocence so near
A far cry from here

Some are sad but true to know
There's belongin' in just longin' for someone
My shoulder rests a road I only follow
Love only borrowed

But I believe in wastin' the years
Speakin' of the deer who has been spared
Innocence so near
A far cry from here
A far cry from here
A far cry from here
