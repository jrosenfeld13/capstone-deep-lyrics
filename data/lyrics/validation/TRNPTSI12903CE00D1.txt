I don't wanna talk about anythin'
Words only get in the way
There's nothing to say anymore
I've been there before
I was safe behind an invisible wall - then baby you broke right through
Now there's nothin' to lose but everythin' and nothin' to prove

All defenses down
No one can save me now
There's only me and a white flag in the sky

I surrender
I surrender
No more fighting no more tears

All my pride just dissapears
I give in
You win
Take my forever
I surrender

Take me away I 'm a prisoner
Now whatcha gonna do with me?
Will you sett me free?
Or throw away the key?

All defenses down
No one can save me now
Ain't nothing left but my will to survive

I surrender
I surrender
No more fighting no more tears

All my pride just dissapears
I give in
You win
Take my forever
I surrender

Everything to lose
Nothing more to prove
I am not afraid just take me away

I surrender
I surrender
No more fighting no more tears

All my pride just dissapears
I give in
You win
Take my forever
I surrender
