Busted in Austin, walkin' around in a daze
I'm sittin' in a slammer lookin' out through these bars in a haze
But it'll all clear up in 11 months and 29 days

Keep the Lone Star cold, the dance floor hot while I'm gone
Keep the Lone Star cold, the dance floor hot while I'm gone
Keep your hands off my woman, I ain't gonna be gone that long

That old judge put a sledgehammer in my hand when he said
I'm gonna sent you to Huntsville, shave your face and your head
I'm doin' 11/29, boys with a cement floor for my bed

Busted in Austin walkin' around in a daze, yes, I was
Now I'm sittin' in a slammer lookin' out the bars through a haze
But it'll all clear up in 11 months and 29 days, hey Lord
