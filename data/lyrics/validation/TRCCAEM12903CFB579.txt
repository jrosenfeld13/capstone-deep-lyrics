Blind existence
Second wave deployed
Final distance
Transports fading into blinding light

Surface melting
View distorting within mind
Paths erasing
Leaving traces beyond sight

As the cities crumble into burning light
Can you see
Can you see

As the skies turn inward over vacant eyes
Can you see
Can you see

Inside the clouds
Concrete shifts
So
Trivial
