Downstairs at danny's all-star joint
They got a juke box that goes doyt-doyt
The vice is nice, they stay in the back all day
But when the nighttime comes, hey-hey
There's this cat down there that makes a bad kinda soup
I come around struttin' my luck in my shoop coupe
Cecil gives me coffee
And he won't never take my coin
I say, " I got thirty dollars in my pocket!
Whatchoo doin' ? "

I holler, " Come on, Cecil, take a dollar!
Come on, Cecil, take a ten!
I've finally geared up into a whole buncha big ones
And you're actin' like I'm down-shiftin' "

He knows all the under-riders on the boulevard
They got to barefoot cruise when it's forty-weight hard
They look particularly dead-beat
Permanently pale
Cecil picks up his butcher knife
Waves it at the jail
The kid say, " I ain't got no dough, Joe, I just want some o.j "
I said, " Don't look at me " ( Cuz he was lookin' my way )
Cecil wink upon him some juice and some green
And the kid walks over and puts the quarter in the pinball machine
And he says, " Come on, Cec, gimme a dollar
Come on Cecil gimme five
I'm in a half-way house on a one-way street
And I'm a quarter past left alive "
