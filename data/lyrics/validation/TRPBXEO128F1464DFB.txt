The future teaches you to be alone
The present to be afraid and cold
So if I can shoot rabbits
Then I can shoot fascists

Bullets for your brain today
But we'll forget it all again
Monuments put from pen to paper
Turns me into a gutless wonder

And if you tolerate this then your children will be next
And if you tolerate this then your children will be next
Will be next, will be next, will be next

Gravity keeps my head down
Or is it maybe shame
At being so young
And being so vain

Holes in your head today
But I'm a pacifist
I've walked Las Ramblas
But not with real intent

And if you tolerate this then your children will be next
And if you tolerate this then your children will be next
Will be next, will be next, will be next

And on the street tonight an old man plays
With newspaper cuttings of his glory days

If you tolerate this then your children will be next
If you tolerate this then your children will be next

And if you tolerate this then your children will be next
And if you tolerate this then your children will be next
Will be next, will be next, will be next

And on the street tonight an old man plays
With newspaper cuttings of his glory days
