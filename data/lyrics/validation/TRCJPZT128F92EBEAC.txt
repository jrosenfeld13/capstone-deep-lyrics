I got a riddle for the people who wanna be
More than a number in the 21st century
It's just a little time to spend by the telephone
And make the call even though you know
There's nobody home

You're number 10 baby
You get the prize
You're number 10 baby
Right between the eyes

She caught a devil seed, it came from a demon chain
Just got a level when you know were you come again
Your kind of label getting ready for all the fame
Just like a funny little monkey that was calling your name

You're number 10 baby
You get the prize
You're number 10 baby
Right between the eyes

Another day another dollar ain't the world looking beautiful?
I got another one waiting and I know I can't lose her

If anybody wants to follow my easy lead
Just leave a number by the door with a set of keys
You know my feelings wouldn't matter a single bit
If you were smart enough to let your curiosity quit

I got a riddle for the people who wanna be
More than a number in the 21st century
It's just a little time to spend by the telephone
And you have got to be the only one who's sitting alone

You're number 10 baby
You get the prize
You're number 10 baby
Right between the eyes
