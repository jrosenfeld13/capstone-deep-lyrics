Armchair Detective

Armchair detective, what's your synopsis?
Hoping you'll tell us how we can stop this
Nobody wants to look stupid today more so than usual
To say something clever is of such importance, to say something clever is crucial

Armchair detective, what (are) you surmising?
A fountain of knowledge in times of crisis
Opinions like arseholes on days like today; everyone's got one

Just cos you shout loudest don't mean that you're right
Cos you shout loudest don't mean that you're right
Cos you shout loudest don't mean that you're right
Cos you shout loudest don't mean that you're right

Ignorance is bliss, folly to be wise
What's the best course of action? Waiting for advice
Kneejerk reactions are invoked today more so than usual
To say something clever is of such importance, to say something clever is crucial

(Say what you think however far from the truth it might be)
Just cos you shout loudest don't mean that you're right
Cos you shout loudest don't mean that you're right
Cos you shout loudest don't mean that you're right
Cos you shout loudest don't mean that you're right
(Say what you think but don't believe in a half of what you read)
Just cos you shout loudest don't mean that you're right
Cos you shout loudest don't mean that you're right
Cos you shout loudest don't mean that you're right
Cos you shout loudest don't mean that you're right

Say what you think however far from the truth it might be
