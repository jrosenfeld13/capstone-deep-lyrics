( Billy Nicholls/Jon Lind)

My friends are all waiting
With time on there hands
It's Saturday night
The bridges are broken
There's no turning back
To white city lights

Here in this cage it gets harder to relate
What did I do, to change me this way
Oh yes I remember I can just see your face
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you

(Guitar Solo)

A hero or villain, is what you become
Or take the road in-between
As free as a bird or a man on the run
Well it could have been me
When other lights shine and then leave me in the dark
You're always there your happy from the start
But where still separated and it's breaking my heart
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
