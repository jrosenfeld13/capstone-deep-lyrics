It's not the pain, that I'm used to it
It's feeling like I'm already dead
I see from a ceiling of misty spirit
Rising from a place in my head

And I never even get to go down
Down in flames

I said, friend you have a life to see
Why do you want to scare me so?
All the suffering and mystery me
I can't even pretend to know

So you never even get to go down
Down in flames
You never even get to go down
Down in flames

We had plans to explore the stars
Be rejected by stage door guards
Mining for gold, the time unreels
Not stifling behind Suburban wheels
Not stifling behind Suburban wheels, yeah

The plan was to burn up when the air was clear
We'd all wear our visors down
Not from a spark in the atmosphere
Not this man-sized hole in the ground
Now your father's face is frozen between anger and tears
You're mother's hair's amazingly grey
And I'm seeing these friends for the first time in years
It's icicle reunion day

And you never even got to go down
Down in flames
You never even got to go down
Down in flames
You never even got to go down
Down in flames
You never, ever, ever even got to go down
Down in flames
