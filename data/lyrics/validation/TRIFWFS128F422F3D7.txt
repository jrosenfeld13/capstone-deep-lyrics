Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shinin'
Shine on the one whose gone and proved untrue
Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shinin'
Shine on the one who's gone and left me blue

It was on a moonlit night
The stars were shining bright
They whispered from on high
Your love has said goodbye

Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shinin'
Shine on the one who's gone and said goodbye
