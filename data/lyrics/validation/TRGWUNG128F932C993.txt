When my work on earth is done, and the setting of thy son; Oh, I'm going to my home over there

I shall walk the golden stairs, and be free from every care, and I'll be happy, in my home over there

In my home over there, that the lord has prepared. there will be peace, there will be joy, everywhere

I shall see his face up there, and be free from every care, and I'll be happy in my home over there
