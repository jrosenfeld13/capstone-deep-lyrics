Come and meet
Those dancing feet
On the avenue I'm taking you to
Forty-Second Street

Hear the beat
Of dancing feet
It's the song I love the melody of
Forty-Second Street

Little nifties from the fifties
Innocent and sweet
Sexy ladies from the eighties
Who are indiscreet

Side by side, they're glorified
Where the underworld
Can meet the elite
Forty-Second Street

Little nifties from the fifties
Innocent, sweet
Sexy ladies from the eighties
Who are indiscreet

Side by side, they're glorified
Where the underworld
Can meet the elite
Forty-Second Street
Forty-Second Street

Naughty, bawdy
Gaudy, sporty
Forty
Forty-Second Street
