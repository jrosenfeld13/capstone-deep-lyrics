There is a chill wind blowing outside
My window pane is wet with tears from the sky
And my record player answers me
A crying song for a fool like me

The midnight bell is striking twelve
Hymns of love ring out for someone else
A choir of children sing innocently
A crying song for a fool like me

The razor blades of love
The razor blades of love

I stare at the empty screen
I've nothing left to say
I cut up magazine headlines
And toss my rhymes away
Toss my rhymes away

The razor blades of love
The everglades of love, of love
Of love, of love, of love
The razor blades of love

And the TV's on and the curtains are drawn, oh, my
And the wallpaper faces look down and scorn, oh, my
Well, I'll keep my sense of humor, huh!
And I'll laugh about it all someday
But I'm lonely again, and left with a pain
That'll never go away, hey!

Oh...

The razor blades of love

Of love
The razor blades of love
Of love
The razor blades of love
The razor blades of love

Of love, of love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Of love
