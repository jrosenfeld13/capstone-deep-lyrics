Daybreak
I saw you in your mess and I heard you say
What could make a girl know she's worth loving

Heartache
I'm just another lost one and I'm wasting time
But I need to know, just like you, how I'm worth loving

And I know it's just about me
There's not a law to read
But something is pushing me
And by the dawning
I can't see how I'll be worth loving

Payday
That's not about us and I'm glad I'm aside
You do what you've got to, better make it worth loving

And I know it's just about me
There's not a law to read
But something is pushing me
And by the dawning
I can't see how I'll be worth loving
