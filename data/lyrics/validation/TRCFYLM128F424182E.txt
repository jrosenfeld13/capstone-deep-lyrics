Too many times you were all alone
He left you behind cryin' by the phone
You weren't born to lose but losing him is wise
You've got a new fool
And he's just about my size

Live your life just how you love to live it
And things will all fall into place
Take your strife and try your best to sing it
In the end you meet your friends

There is something I must tell you girl
Been building up so long
See, all the times I served as your love consultant
I wanted to be there myself

Live your life just how you love to live it
And things will all fall into place
Take your strife and try your best to sing it
In the end you meet your friends

I love you more than it would seem
I love you more than it would seem

Love to me is not a total stranger
But love to me don't make no sense
Love can be a capsule full of danger
But that's a risk I'll have to take

I love you more than it would seem
I love you more than it would seem

I'm sorry I waited so long but the
Time was so wrong
I know it's just a song but I love you
Things ain't what they seem to be
I have tried to conceal but love overwhelms me
