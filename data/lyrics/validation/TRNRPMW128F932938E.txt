I know you have been looking for me
Hidden from view
Searching under your bed
Call me inside your head
Very well, but I can see you here
Yes your presence is known
Been caught on the hidden cameras
Been heard through the bugs on you walls


So if you will stop creeping around
Im waiting here, here to be found
Cos when I am, you are not
And when Im not, you are all
So you can break all my laws, I dont mind


I can see you, at the door
Wanting in, come through the walls (the things we said today)
I can see you, at the door
Wanting in, come back for more


Walking quietly through my daydreams
Hidden from view
No thing I would begrudge
Leave me open to touch
Stay here, no need to leave yet
No need to cover your eyes
If youre a true believer
Hold me up to the light


And if you will stop creeping around
Im waiting here, here to be found
Cos when I am, you are not
And when Im not, you are all
So you can break all my laws, I dont mind


(I dont mind, I dont mind, I dont mind, I dont mind)
(I dont mind, I dont mind, I dont mind, I dont mind)


I can see you, at the door
Wanting in, come back for more (the things we said today)
I can see you, at the door
Wanting in, come through the walls


I can see you (see you), at the door
Wanting in, come back for more (the things we said today)
Yeah, I can see you (see you), at the door
Wanting in, come back for more
