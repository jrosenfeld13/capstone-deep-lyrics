(Ohohoho
Find another way
Ohohoho
Find another, another way)

(Find another way to me
Find another way and make me free
Can you hear my voice so find another way
Oh, I cried to you, please, follow me oh, follow me)

(Ohohoho
Find another way
Ohohoho
Find another, another way)

(Find another, another way)

Shake it, break it, no, I can't fake it
To another level, can't take it
Pressurize and hypnotize
And in your mind, realize

And move, move, no I gotta move
Yo, so, watch me groove
Beat to the beat, fire and heat
Make you jump right outta your seat

Gotta jam, jam, watch me jam
To the beat, yo, watch me slam
Pumpin', pumpin', looking for something
Always question leaving nothing

Shake it, shake it every day
Keeping busy day by day
To find, to find another way

(Find another way to me
Find another way and make me free
Can you hear my voice so find another way
Oh, I cried to you, please, follow me oh, follow me)

(Ohohoho
Find another way
Ohohoho
Find another, another way)

(Find another, another way)

Weekdays morning, always holding
Got to be studying, I'm rolling
Project on the dancefloor
Working where you're going

But certainly no way out
No way out, gonna make you pride
No doubt respect, what I'm looking for
Weekday on, now hit the door

Faster, faster, making it faster
Turn it loud, sweep your blaster
Bust the sound you've found
Keepin' the thunder underground

Keep the bass is what I say
Keepin' it pumpin', day by day to find
To find another way

(Find another way to me
Find another way and make me free
Can you hear my voice so find another way
Oh, I cried to you, please, follow me oh, follow me)
(Ohohoho
Find another way
Ohohoho
Find another, another way)

(Ohohoho
Find another way
Ohohoho
Find another, another way)

(Ohohoho
Find another way
Ohohoho
Find another, another way)
