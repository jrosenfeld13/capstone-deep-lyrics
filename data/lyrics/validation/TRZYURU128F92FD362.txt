[Intro]
Crazy but I'm relieved this time
Begging for sweet relief
A blessing in disguise

[Verse 1]
Dying behind these tired eyes
I've been losing sleep
Please come to me
Tonight

[Chorus]
Hands on a miracle
I got my hands on a miracle
Believe it or not, hands on a miracle
And there ain't no way
Let you take it away

[Verse 2]
Everything that we survived
It's gonna be alright
Just lucky we're alive
Got no vision I've been blind
Searching everywhere you're right here in my sights

[Chorus]X2
Hands on a miracle
I got my hands on a miracle
Believe it or not, hands on a miracle
And there ain't no way
Let you take it away
