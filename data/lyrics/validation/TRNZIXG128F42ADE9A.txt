My life is over, at least for 94 weeks
I look like some metal mouth freak
And that's a long time

I wanna go to the party
But I don't wanna be seen
I wish it was Halloween
And I could wear a mask

Woe is me, life will have to wait
Until my teeth are straight and that's a long time
Can't you see life will have to wait
Until again I'm looking great and that's a long time

Life is over, at least for 600 days
By then you'll be far away
And you'll like another

Then I see you standing there, you make me want to smile
But if I open my lips too wide, would you still want me

Woe is me, life will have to wait
Until my teeth are straight and that's a long time
Can't you see life will have to wait
Until again I'm looking great and that's a long time

That's a long time

Life's not over I was stupid and scared
Worried about who cared that I have braces
Now I see, life won't have to wait and I won't hesitate, its a good time
Can't you see life is full of surprise You can't let it pass you by; its a good time

Yeah its a good time
