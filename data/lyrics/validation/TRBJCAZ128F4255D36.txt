All around us
And in between
Politics like cancer
Information
In extremes
Never find the answers
Events unfolded
Set the stage
We know they have us
In every way
They held a grudge for
Way too long
I feel that danger
Coming on
I have grave expectations
For this strange situation
I signed my letter of resignation
For the stealing of a nation
Cut your losses
Get the votes
Come fall they'll change every single quote
Heavy ammunition
Targets in sight
Inhuman nature
Fills me with fright
Do your life justice
It won't take long
