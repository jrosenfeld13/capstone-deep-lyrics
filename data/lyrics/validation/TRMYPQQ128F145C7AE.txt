God I hate your needles and
Your dirty little vial of pills
I guess I love the sweat you put me through
I know I love your body
Like I used to love your mind
But now your soul's a slave
To all the things you use
I put you in the tub babe
With five big pounds of ice
If you don't get back up
I don't know what I'll do
I've walked around the room
Here nearly 37 Times
Can you hear me now
And am I getting through

Get up, get back up
Get up, get back up

I thought I heard you laughing
I thought I heard you scream
I thought I heard some wailing
Like lovers in heat
I thought maybe we'd been

Somewhere that we've never seen
Still you lie so still like
A china doll lost in a summer dream

Here I am way down here
Way down upon my knees
You're looking awfully blue
We were having such a good time
We were having so much fun now
We'll lock the door change the sheets
But how do I get to you

Get back up, get up babe
Get up babe, get back up

I feel like the walls
Are closing in get back up
You look like a china doll
So pale and so thin
Get back up and make me laugh
The way you used to do
