Runnin' down the interstate
Coffee drippin' down my leg
Every day I'm runnin' late
Gettin' slapped around by the hands of time

Next lane there's a pick-up
A girl puttin' on her make-up
Her cellular phone's startin' to break up
She's gettin' slapped around by the hands of time

Everybody's runnin' a little late like me
The whole world's runnin' behind
Can't seem to get where we need to be
Gettin' slapped around by the hands of time

Here comes a carpool
Mama's got her hands full
Six kids all late for school
Gettin' slapped around by the hands of time

Just passed the governor's motorcade
Must've had a flat tire on the way
I guess everybody's got to wait
When you're slapped around by the hands of time

Everybody's runnin' a little late like me
The whole world's runnin' behind
Can't seem to get where we need to be
Gettin' slapped around by the hands of time

Well everybody's runnin' a little late like me
The whole world's runnin' behind
Can't seem to get where we need to be
Gettin' slapped around by the hands of time
