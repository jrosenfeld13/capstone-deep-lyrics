It was monday when I met you
At a high school party
The teenage recluse, I knew I'd never forget you
Now I want you back

On tuesday we absconded
To the club on F street
To watch the Pixies
And I got so jealous when you looked at frank black
Now I want you back
I want you back

On wednesday at nine
We kissed on the lawnchairs on the back porch
It was fantastic of course
But it only made me want you back more
I want you back
Yeah I want you back

On friday when we said goodnight
How I wish I had known
That you meant goodbye
Yeah I wish I had known
That you meant goodbye

I want you back
Yeah I want you back
I want you back
I want you back
I want you back
Yeah I want you back
I want you back
Yeah I want you back
I want you back
