Bring down the slain from among thine adversaries
They shall fall to rise no more

Thus said the Lord: I am Sabaoth
Feel my holy wrath
I am glorified
I cannot be denied

I am he who is
Punishment for wickedness
I am the one you dread
You are as good as dead

Tetragrammaton
Thy wrath inflame my passion
Tetragrammaton

There is no God but the one that dies with me
I have no life but the one I take with me to the grave
We come into this world alone
And we will die on our own
I live
I die
