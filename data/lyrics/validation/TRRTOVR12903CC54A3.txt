[Verse 1]
(No don't you let her)
Don't let her take your love from me
I know you're infatuated with her loveliness
And you tell me she's the key to your happiness
You ask me to try, oh try and understand
Well just put yourself in my place, go on and just see if you can

[Chorus 1]
I'm beggin' you, don't let her take your love from me
Don't let, don't let her take your love from me
Don't let her take, don't let her take it away from me
Don't let, no don't let her take your love from me

[Verse 2]
So does she whisper how much she loves you in your ear
Pay her no mind because I love you much more [?]
My love can move mountains that's how strong it is for you
And for you to walk away into her arms would break my heart in two

[Chorus 2]
So darlin' don't let her take, don't let her take your love from me
Don't let, no don't let her take your love from me
I'm beggin' you
No don't let her please don't let her no take your love from me

[Verse 3]
If you leave me for her you would truly be unfair
Remember it was me who stuck beside you when you didn't have a pair
Now I'm beggin' you down on bended knees
Baby baby baby please stay here with me

[Chorus 3]
Darlin' don't, don't you let her, don't let her take your love from me
Please don't let her, no don't let her take your love from me
Darlin' don't let her take, don't let her take your love from me
Oh don't let her, please don't let her take your love from me
I can stand it
Just don't let her take your love from me
Please don't let her take your love from me
Baby baby
