The heart is a bloom, shoots up through the stony ground
But there's no room, no space to rent in this town
You're out of luck and the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck and you're not moving anywhere
You thought that you'd found a friend to take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace

It's a beautiful day
The sky falls and you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

You're on the road but you've got no destination
You're in the mud, in the maze of her imagination
You love this town even if that doesn't ring true
You've been all over and it's been all over you

It's a beautiful day
The sky falls and you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

Touch me, take me to the other place
Teach me, I know I'm not a hopeless case

See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light and
See the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out

It's a beautiful day
The sky falls and you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

Touch me, take me to the other place
Teach me, I know I'm not a hopeless case

What you don't have you don't need it now
What you don't know you can feel it somehow
What you don't have you don't need it now
Need it now

It's a beautiful day
The sky falls and you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

Touch me, take me to the other place

It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
