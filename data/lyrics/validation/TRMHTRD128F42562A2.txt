I saw a friend just the other day
We took a walk around the way
The sky was blue and his face was grey
I asked him what could cause such dismay?
He tallied his life and he noticed the score
He felt his pain he never felt before
He said it feels like He (Allah) can't no more
He said it feels like He (Allah) can't love me no more
No No No No
He can't love me anymore
It's a fact I know for sure
We started out this life so pure
But He can't love me anymore
He can't love me anymore
It's a fact that I know for sure
I started out this life so pure
But He can't love me anymore
He went on about the past
To listen with patience was my only task
No need to pry and no need to ask
His words to me were my looking glass
And with much pain his heart did pour
With this feeling never felt before
He said it feels like, He (Allah) can't love me no more
He said it feels like, He (Allah) can't love me no more
No No No, No!
I asked my friend how can this be?
Not the One Who created me
Cause if our sins outweighed the sea
Forgiveness comes so easily
Just repent and stay to the task
To make an effort is all He asks
And don't get bogged down by the past
His mercy outweighs His wrath
And He can love you once more
It's a fact that I know for sure
We started out this life so pure
But He can love you once more
And He can love you once more
It's a fact that I know for sure
We started out this life so pure
But He can love you once more
