[Verse 1]
Did you come here to kill
Or did you come here to die
And did you really think that spaceships
Would descend from the sky

[Verse 2]
Bending light
And beaming forth across space-time
To see us scared
In the reflection of their oil black eyes
To stalk us as a predator
Like our movies imply

[Verse 3]
They're not the ones who've come to kill us
Come to fill us full of lead
They're not the ones who hate us

[Verse 4]
And they are not the ones who mutilate our animals
Or travel through the stars
They're not the ones who cause us harm (We are)
We are, we are, we are

[Verse 5]
We are still-life and cold blooded
We feel nothing
We are still-life and cold blooded
We feel nothing

[Verse 6]
Hell-bent on heaven
Hell-bent on heaven
Hell-bent on heaven
Hell-bent on heaven

[Bridge]
While our righteous men are stuffing corpses
Full of shit and faith

[Verse 7]
We are, we are, we are still-life
We are, we are, we are still-life
We are, we are, we are
Still-life

[Verse 8]
They're not the ones who cause us harm
We are, we are
Did you come here to kill
Or did you come here to die?
We are still-life, in cold blood
We are still-life, in cold blood
And we feel
We feel nothing

[Verse 9]
Stuffing corpses
Full of shit and faith
They bloviate about a future beyond the moon
To bring about another planet's doom
To discover peaceful life
And beat our war drum to its tune
Unless my prayers are answered
Our end is coming soon
