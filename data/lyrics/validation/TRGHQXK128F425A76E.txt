[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, woah, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Taxi ride, going downtown
Me and my girls, going out
Counting down to detonation
Ten to zero, mushroom cloud
Little angel, I've been too good
Ditch the halo for a while
Dressed to kill
I'll be causing mass distraction
So shield your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm all steamed up
And I'm ready to blow
The Pressure max
Meter red overload
To get release, I gotta explode, explode

[Chorus]
I'm a bomb
Can you hear me tick?
Beware if you turn me on, there is no safety switch
I'm a bomb, use only steady hands
To mess with me, you must be a brave man
I'm a bomb (I'm a bomb)
Bomb, bomb, bomb
I'm a bomb (Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb)

[Verse 2]
Bass so loud, I can't hear you
Can't defuse me, now I'm wired
Do not disturb while I'm dancing
Watch me set this house on fire

[Chorus]
I'm a bomb (I'm a bomb)
Can you hear me tick?
Beware if you turn me on, there is no safety switch (no, no)
I'm a bomb, use only steady hands
To mess with me, you must be a brave man
I'm a bomb
Bomb, bomb, bomb
Can you hear me tick?
Beware if you turn me on, there is no safety switch
I'm a bomb (bomb, bomb, bomb)
Use steady hands
To mess with me, you must be a brave man

[Bridge]
Club crescendo, getting loud
Run for cover, underground
What are you doing?
Showing me no fear
You must be crazy hanging 'round here

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm all steamed up
And I'm ready to blow
The Pressure max
Meter red overload
To get release, I gotta explode, explode

[Chorus]
I'm a bomb
Can you hear me tick?
Beware if you turn me on, there is no safety switch
I'm a bomb, use only steady hands
To mess with me, you must be a brave man
I'm a bomb (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can you hear me tick?
Beware if you turn me on, there is no safety switch
I'm a bomb
Use steady hands
To mess with me, you must be a brave man

[Outro]
I'm a bomb
I'm a bomb (bomb)
I'm a bomb (bomb)
I'm a bomb (bomb)
I'm a bomb (bomb)
You must be a great man
