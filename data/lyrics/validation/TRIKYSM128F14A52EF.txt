Down in the silvermine
Dusk is playing tricks on time
Days are long but the work is fine
Down in the silvermine

Hear how the band is playing
Folks on the platform saying
Bye to the boy who's leaving home

Hurry, the whistle's blowing
Hanky, my tears are showing
Anchors away, I'm on my own

I'd never lose her on a silver streak
Far from the girl I left behind
No time for tears and sorrow
I've got silver on my mind

Down in the silvermine
Dusk is playing tricks on time
Days are long but the work is fine
Down in the silvermine

Down in the silvermine
Dusk is playing tricks on time
Days are long but the work is fine
Down in the silvermine

Hi-ho, the wheels are grinding
Strong arms, the picks are winding
Straight down the mining shaft we go

Why, oh, the rocks they rumble
Into the dark we stumble
Risking our lives because we know

Down there's a one-way fare to Easy Street
Grab all the silver we can find
Sell to the highest bidder
Head for the girl I left behind

Down in the silvermine
Dusk is playing tricks on time
Days are long but the work is fine
Down in the silvermine

Down in the silvermine
Dusk is playing tricks on time
Days are long but the work is fine
Down in the silvermine

Down in the silvermine
Dusk is playing tricks on time
Days are long but the work is fine
Down in the silvermine

Down in the silvermine
Down in the silvermine
Down in the silvermine
Down in the silvermine
Down in the silvermine
