[Verse 1]
My head, it hurts, each day it's getting worse
My looks and smile have now become my curse
Tight lips, red skirt, the never ending street
Big car, little man, my lover for a fee

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you see me will you just drive on by?
Or will I catch the twinkle inside your eye?
And if you want me, well, I guess I want you
Oh, pretty baby, how could you?

[Chorus]
Standing in the rain
Milk carton mug shot, baby
Missing since 1983
Standing in the rain
Twenty years of dirty needles
Raindrops running through my veins

[Verse 2]
My head, it hurts, each day it's getting worse
No sun, my room has now become my hearse
Cold sores, I'm beat, got bruises on my feet
My pride, these men have taken it from me!

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you see me will you just drive on by?
Or will I catch the twinkle inside your eye?
And if you want me, well, I guess I want you
Oh, pretty baby, how could you?!

[Chorus]
Standing in the rain
Milk carton mug shot, baby
Missing since 1983
Standing in the rain
Twenty years of dirty needles
Raindrops running through my veins

Standing in the rain
Milk carton mug shot, baby
Missing since 1983
Standing in the rain
Twenty years of dirty needles
Raindrops running through my veins

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you see me will you just drive on by?
Or will I catch the twinkle inside your eye?
And if you want me, well, I guess I want you
Oh, pretty baby, how could you?!

[Bridge]
Standing in the rain...
Standing in the rain...
Standing in the rain...
Milk carton mug shot, baby
Mother, I have lost my way

[Chorus]
Standing in the rain
Milk carton mug shot, baby
Missing since 1983
Standing in the rain
Twenty years of dirty needles
Raindrops running through my veins

[Outro/Chorus]
Standing in the rain
Mother, I have lost my way
Standing in the rain
Mother, I have lost my way
