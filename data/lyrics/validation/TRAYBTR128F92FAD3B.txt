Arranging unlogical circuits in random patterns
Disassembling components of organic tissue
A disarray of sickening skin and mechanical parts
Brain-connected systems, synapses disconnected
Veins replaced with wires, fragments of mind collected
A recombinant being designed into a new human form
Programmed to appease a dishonest reason
Unclean purpose of bionic knowledge
Phased, adapted, redesigned by objective eyes
Misguided, unmatched, erased
A walking generation, abort transmission
Senses expanded, multidimensional perception
Stroboscopic eyes transfixed, mind-projected images of dissolution
Nerve impulses overgained to raise the level of production
Unrepaired damaged to the inner cranium area
A gradually lowered potential and diminished life form
Brain-connected systems, synapses disconnected
Veins replaced with wires, phased, adapted
Redesigned by objective eyes
Misguided, unmatched, erased
A walking generation, body triggered
Senses expanded, multidimensional perception
Stroboscopic eyes transfixed, mind-projected images of dissolution
