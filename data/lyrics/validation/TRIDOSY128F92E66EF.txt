Open your eyes its clear to see
That the heroin trade is a big industry
More people die through this slavery
Then you could ever kill in a shooting spree

Your support of this corporation
Is killing people in these third world nations
Harvest transport and distribution
Stop the demand is the only solution

Convinced that your a loser and you've got no hope-shoot people not dope
Sick of being picked on and you just can't cope
Shoot people not dope
Sitting in the dark in you're room all alone

Shoot people not dope
Go out with a blast not a whimpering moan
Shoot people not dope
Load up the needle shoot in the vein

Another fix to cure the pain
Either way they call you insane
I've seen the light and there's a another way
