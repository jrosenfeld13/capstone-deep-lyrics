We don't talk much
We don't make love like we used to
And I stay guarded
I've got walls and triggers
I never thought I had
And so do you
But this is love
And that's the way we seem content to play it

I touch your clothes when you're gone
I let your scent wash over me
You cry at night and you wish just like a child
That we were how we used to be

There's a Stranger In The House
In the house
There's a Stranger In The House
In the house
There's a Stranger In The House
In the house
And she looks like somebody from a lifetime ago

I stonewall you, you stonewall me
But we both know that
Hiding deep inside us
Lives the love that we try hard to lose
And never will
But this is war
And that's the way we seem content to fight it

I get so angry and confused 'cause
I want out but I want you
You can't decide between moving out or moving in
You don't know what to do

With a Stranger In The House
In the house
There's a Stranger In The House
In the house
There's a Stranger In The House
In the house
And she looks like you
And he looks like me

Is this the same girl that, I fought so hard to win
And now I fight to lose her
Now I feel that it's just like skin to skin
And nerve to nerve
Strung out like wire
Is that the way we are content to live

We face off in anger
In rooms once filled with love
Looking for a chink in the armour
Where we can stab the blade
What are we thinking of

There's a Stranger In The House
In the house
There's a Stranger In The House
In the house
There's a Stranger In The House
In the house
And she looks like somebody from a lifetime ago

There's a Stranger In The House
In the house
There's a Stranger In The House
In the house
There's a Stranger In The House
In the house
