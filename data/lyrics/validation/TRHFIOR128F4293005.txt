[Intro]
Riding on these waves
Holding on to what you say
"Everything will be okay
It will work out one way."

[Verse 1]
But I've drifted way too far
My arms, my legs, have grown too tired
And could you be inspired?
No, I'm just tired

[Verse 2]
And on a swing you push me hard
So I'll come back to where you are
And you know I'm never far
No decisions, nothing hard

[Bridge]
And I knew that it would rain tonight
I'll take the bus or the next flight
I won't give up on what feels right

[Chorus]
If you see these tears filling my eyes
It's just the wind that makes me cry
If you could feel this pain inside
It's from the drinks we drank last night
It's from the drinks we drank last night

[Verse 3]
And the shadow of our past
Projects on clouds of dust and gas
Wounds where my eyes will rest
The silhouette of loneliness

[Chorus]
If you see these tears filling my eyes
It's just the wind that makes me cry
If you could feel this pain inside
It's from the drinks we drank last night
It's from the drinks we drank last night
