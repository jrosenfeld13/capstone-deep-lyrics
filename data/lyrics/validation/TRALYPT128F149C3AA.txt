Let there be you
Let there be me
Let there be oysters
Under the sea

Let there be wind
And occasional rain
Chili con carne
Sparkling champagne

Let there be birds
That sing in the trees
Someone to bless me
Whenever I sneeze

Let there be cuckoos
A lark and a dove
But first of all, please
Let there be love
Oh, love
Oh, let there be love
Let there be love
