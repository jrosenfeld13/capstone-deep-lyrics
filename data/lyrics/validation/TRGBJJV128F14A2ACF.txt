(Lefty Frizzell, Blackie Crawford)

Chorus:
Always late with your kisses
Won't you come to my arms sweet darlin' and stay
You're always late with your kisses
Why, oh why do you want to do me this way

How long do you think that I can wait
When you know you're always late
Always late with your kisses
Why, oh why do you want to do me this way

Always late, always late

Always late, always late

How long do you think that I can wait
When you know you're always late
Always late with your kisses
Won't you come to my arms sweet darlin' and stay
You're always late with your kisses
Why, oh why do you want to do me this way
I said, why oh why do you want to do me this way...
