[Verse 1]
Eliminate, the life decline
I've paid the masters with blood and hunger
And it's not for sale by any stretch
It's like religion without a Bible
And the Dragon lives inside my mouth
And it speaks in tongues, the word

[Chorus]
Hellbound - in Fort Worth, Texas
Hellbound - Fort Worth

[Verse 2]
Snakes, in Southern flames
To bring the thunder; the great decider
Would you believe in this or the ash?
I do believe it and it's taking over
Accept [x7]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Born to a world so young and proud
But over your head hangs a black cloud
Grow your hair and crawl inside yourself
Because there you cannot hide
Facing fears that you'll overcome and one
Of these years you know you've won
You've won [x2]

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Hellbound
