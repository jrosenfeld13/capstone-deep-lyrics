I re-read silly lines
That made sense at the time
Pages all stained with tears and red wine
And I walk through the airport and see magazines
Every face that I see
So much younger than me
And I smile to myself how I don't even miss
My glorious past or the lips that I've kissed
And I think to myself that how easy this is
Easy to breathe, easy to live

And I wonder why I tear myself in two
Over how to be, what to say and what to do
And I know you liked me better then
And I know you liked me better when I was a fool
I was a fool
mm
I was a fool
mm

So I live in these days
But I still have my old ways
'cause the future, somehow, has yet to arrive
And I see all around me the women on time
Kids and divorces and crisis in midlife
And do I surrender and give up my dream
For a brick in the wall and a washing machine
Grow up and get real
For a kid in their teens
Who won't care what I've done
Where I've been, what I've seen

And I wonder why I tear myself in two
Over who to be, how to be and what to do
And I know you liked me better then
And I know you liked me better when I was a fool
Iwas a fool
I was a fool
I was a fool

I'm free to a fault
I'm 45
I'm playing guitar
I'm living my life
Fly down the highway
Sun on my face
I belong to nobody
I belong to no place
