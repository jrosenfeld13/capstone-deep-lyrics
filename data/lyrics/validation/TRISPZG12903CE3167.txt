[Verse 1]
Waitin' at a stoplight yesterday as a funeral procession made its way
Through the gates
I watched it roll up a windin' road, through a field of green with white headstones
All in a row

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And it made me think about where I'm at
On my not so straight and narrow path
All the generous and mostly undeserved
Blessings that I've had

[Chorus 1]
I had an all-American mom and dad
Some of the coolest friends you could ever have
Found love I thought I'd never find
Sometimes I can't believe this life is mine
And I'm not plannin' on leavin' yet
But the truth is, you just never know
And if this is as good as it gets
Man, I think I'm good to go
I'm good to go

[Verse 2]
I said a prayer for the dearly departed, and the loved ones left broken hearted
Then traffic started
And I drove away a little more able to see the good things on my table
And that I'm grateful

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I have had my troubles, had my trials
I've hit the mark and I've missed by miles
Had days that I've been fightin' mad
But the good times have more than outweighed the bad

[Chorus 2]
I got to hold my newborn baby girl
And the hand of a man as he slipped from this world
I've laughed so hard I couldn't stop
Seen the sunrise from a mountain top
And I'm not plannin' on leavin' yet
But the truth is, you just never know
And if this is as good as it gets
Man, I think I'm good to go

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I've been thinkin' 'bout where I am at
On my not so straight and narrow path
And I wouldn't wanna change nothin' about
This "roll with the punches" life I've had

[Chorus ]
I had an all-American mom and dad
Some of the coolest friends you could ever have
Found love I thought I'd never find
I can't believe this life is mine
And I'm not plannin' on leavin' yet
But the truth is, you just never know
And if this is as good as it gets
Man, I think I'm good to go

[Outro]
I'm good to go
I'm good to go
