You said you like mixin' it up
I said I don't like to chat
You said you smoked the big kahunas
I said I'm not like that

I'm just chillin', I'm just hangin'
So don't be spillin' your stuff on me
I'm just chillin', I'm just hangin', baby

You said you played some pocket pool
I said I played some myself
You wanna try it together sometime
I only play by myself

I'm just chillin', I'm just hangin'
So don't be spillin' your stuff on me
I'm just chillin', I'm just hangin', baby

You've got your friends in high places
Babe, I can pull my own strings
You said I'm a name in a phone book
I don't have one of those things

I'm just chillin', I'm just hangin'
So don't be spillin' your stuff on me
I'm just chillin', I'm just hangin', baby

You said we're cogs in a great big machine
Babe, I've got the right tools
You said it's all just a crazy dream
Well, I've got plenty of fuel

I'm just chillin', I'm just hangin'
So don't be spillin' your stuff on me
I'm just chillin', I'm just hangin', baby
I'm just chillin', I'm just hangin'
So don't be spillin' your stuff on me
I'm just chillin', I'm just hangin', baby
