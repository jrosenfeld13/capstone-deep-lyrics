When we meet again

Springtime is here, and the wind from the south
Blows strong and warm to clean out your house
The sun has arisen and the lies that were told are
Driven outside with the freezing cold
I can remember a spring just like this
I was 19 yrs. Old
Now the time is sorely missed
The first year that I left my mother's house
Out to make my way in this world somehow

I can't believe how the times they have changed
All the dreams that came true still seem so far away
I remember the days sittin' on the front porch with
The sun beatin' down in my neighborhood

I'd sit out all night singin' songs to the moon
Or try and get some sweet honey back to my bedroom

My friends they were few but to me they were true
All we was trying to do was just to make it thru
Always thought for the future, but we shouldn't have cared
All the best things in life we shared them right there

So to all those old friend God be with them
I wish, I wish I could see you again
In the same corner bar where it all started from
Dig your plow so deep now the stars have all gone
So wherever they shine may it be warm and bright
Out to ease my mind on this worried night
It all seemed so simple and good tidings I send
I'll never forget that one year that we spent
