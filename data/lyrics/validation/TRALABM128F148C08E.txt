[Verse 1]
Just because you know I love you so much
Do not be afraid to tell me you are sad
Because you lost his love
Though your love is not for me
I do not want to see you in misery, so come on, baby come on

[Chorus]
You can cry on my shoulder
You can cry on my shoulder
And bring all your troubles to me
All your troubles to me

[Verse 2]
Big girls are not supposed to cry
If you do I will understand
Maybe I can show you how you can win his love again
It may seem strange I know
But it is just that I love you
So come on, baby come on

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Girl you have given him all you had
He would better stop treating you so bad
Come on babe, come on, oh yeah

[Chorus]
You can cry on my shoulder, yes you can girl
You can cry on my shoulder
And bring all your troubles to me, yeah babe, yes you can now
Darling, ooh, ooh yes, yes you can girl
I will be there to help

[Outro]
You can cry, you can cry, you can cry
Baby
(You can cry on my shoulder)
Oh yeah babe, yeah babe
(You can cry on my shoulder)
You can cry, you can cry
