[Verse 1]
If you feel like running today
You know Id understand
You dont but you long
Its easier to give it away
When on the other hand
You know I, Im not much better without you
Im like your victim and all that you need is an alibi
It's one thing about you
I dont wanna make you cry

[Chorus]
Damn girl
Dry your eyes
You stole my heart and then you kicked it aside
No girl, you cant see
When hes inside you know theres no room for me

[Verse 2]
If you can take a chance
Find you that better man
Your life seethes from your quick disease
Youre giving all my loving away
Tell me to understand
Cuz you know I, Im not much better without you
I'll press your lips and I taste everyone that youve had tonight
It's one thing about you
I dont wanna taste tonight

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
And I used to think that I was all you would need
Nah nah nah
And there you go again
Nah nah nah
Oooh you think that you can just push me around
Nah nah nah
Yeah and there you go again
You lift me up and then you throw me back down

[Chorus]

[Outro]
(Damn that girl)
Damn girl
Dry your eyes (Dry your eyes)
You stole my heart and then you kicked it aside (Damn that girl)
No girl you cant see (You can't see)
When hes inside you know theres no room for me
And I used to think that I was all you would need

If you feel like running today you know Id understand
