[Verse 1]
Wasted all a disgrace
Rearranged the pretty messes
Pray on your bended knee to fucked up pleasures
To the kids with king of rights
Underneath the night tonight
You would rather spite your face than change your life

[Chorus]
Spay
Why won't you?
Why won't you?
Why won't you spay yourself?

[Verse 2]
Blitzkrieg the bitches bald
May the trophy sell the gold
Pay the toll of sell your soul come one, come all
When the bill is on collections
Peppers holes and ugly messes
The singer sings of diamond things and all excesses

[Chorus]
Spay
Why won't you?
Why won't you?
Why won't you spay yourself?
Spay
Why won't you?
Why won't you?
Why won't you spay yourself?

[Bridge]
There is a love that doesn't lease, through the night
Heed all your baggage and consume all your life

[Chorus] (x2)
Spay
Why won't you?
Why won't you?
Why won't you spay yourself?
