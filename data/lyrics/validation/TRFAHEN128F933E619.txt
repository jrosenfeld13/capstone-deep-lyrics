An image from a long long time ago
Is haunting me
It plays itself with
Picture perfect clarity
A certain walk, a certain talk
Forever twenty three
For only me to see

I watch it like a movie
The details so consume me
What's real will surface when it's gone
(and then it's gone)

By now you've heard the news
What is there left to do

I watch it like a movie
The details so consume me
What's real will surface when it's gone
(and then it's gone)

Yr face looks so familiar
Unwashed and quite peculiar
No i can't say that i recall
I guess it's gone
