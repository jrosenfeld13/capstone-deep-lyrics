Hey listen, treasure
You know I'm waiting for you
I want some pleasure
I love those things that you do

Do you know what you want
Oh yes I do
Do you know how to get it
You know that it's true

I know what I want
And I know how to get it
So come on baby
Let's do it again

I feel your motion of love
I feel the motion of love
I feel the motion of love
I feel your motion of love

Pretty angel
You've got a rhythm that's blue
You could not measure
This love I feel for you

Do you know what you want
Oh yes I do
Do you know how to get it
You know that it's true

I know what I want
And I know how to get it
So come on, angel
Let's share it

I feel your motion of love
I feel the motion of love
I feel the motion of love
I feel your motion of love

I just wanna kiss, just wanna kiss
Your lips, your lips
I wanna kiss, I wanna kiss
Just a bit like this, oh yes

I want some pleasure
I'll dance over you
You little treasure
You know our world is blue

Do you know what you want
Oh yes I do
Do you know how to get it
You know that I do

I know what I want
And I know how to get it
So come on, baby
Let's share it

I feel your motion of love
I feel the motion of love
I feel the motion of love
I feel your motion of love

Motion of love...
