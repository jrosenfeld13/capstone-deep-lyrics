Travel the days of freedom
Roads leading everywhere
Come with me now, and show how you care

Follow the dying embers
Cross on the paths they lay
Breath of the past, the earth's yesterday

Clear your mind, maybe you will find
That the past is still turning
Circles sway, echo yesterday
Ashes burning, ashes burning

Colours are fading starlight
Silver the way to find
Walking the shadows, there in our mind

Changing the order slowly
Leaving the mist of time
Fingers are holding, fragments of mine

Clear your mind, maybe you will find
That the past is still turning
Circles sway, echo yesterday
Ashes burning, ashes burning

Imagine the burning embers
They glow below and above
Your sins you won't remember
And all you'll find there is love
Ashes are burning brightly
The smoke can be seen from afar
So now you're seeing how far
Ashes are burning the way
Ashes are burning the way
