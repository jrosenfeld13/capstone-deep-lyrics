If I could have just one wish granted
If I could have just one prayer answered
This would be that wish, this would be that prayer
Nothing bad must happen to her

Let me take the time to tell her
Everything that I should tell her
How I need her more and more, how I'm glad she came along
And how I know we've found where we belong
And how I know we've found where we belong

Nothing bad must happen to her
In the cell of the night
Holding on so tight
Thinking this is all we want for the rest of our lives
