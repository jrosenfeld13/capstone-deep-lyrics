I'm trying to figure out
Trying to understand why
We look up to those spreading genocide

Bragging you're a dealer
Saying it with pride
While baby's born on drugs
Don't have a chance to survive

I apologize if I offended you
Not trying to be a hater
I've got friends that hustle too

And I'm trying to figure out
While we call out your name
I know that I am guilty
I did it on some game

But you're so conditioned
It doesn't bother you
And I was just a name
That you and your friends used

If I offended you
You've got to let me know
I didn't know it was acceptable
To call someone a ho

Things have got to change
They can't go on this way
It's got to start with me and you
Why can't we do?

And I'm trying to figure out
And I tried to understand
Why the color of the clothes
Will make you kill another man

And what about the children
We've got to educate
They won't grow with prejudice
We've taught them how to hate

I'm not trying to put you down
Just tell you how I feel
Now tell me can you handle
When I keep it real

Things have got to change
They can't go on this way
It's got to start with me and you
Why can't we do? Can't we do?

You know things have got to change
They can't go on this way
It's got to start with me and you
Why can't we do? Why can't we do?

Trying to figure out
Trying to understand
What's going on
