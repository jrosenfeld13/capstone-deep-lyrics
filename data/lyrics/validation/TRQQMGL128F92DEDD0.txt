Hello stranger
We haven't spoke in a while
It's been three years
And I forgot how to smile
I think I'm ready to find out why
It doesn't matter how hard I try
Cause every time I convince myself it's what I need
A darkness fills my eyes

I know you're lonely
I know you feel
There's only one way
For you to heal
But it's not gonna change a thing
If you always depend on me
Did you really expect I'd be the one
To pull you out of here
I can't erase the past, all that you fear

C'mon take me
Cause I got nowhere to go (I got nowhere to go)
And I'm helpless
And I want you to know (and I want you to know)
I think I'm ready to find out why
It doesn't matter how hard I try
Cause every time I convince myself it's what I need
A darkness fills my eyes

I know you're lonely
I know you feel
There's only one way
For you to heal
But it's not gonna change a thing
If you always depend on me
Did you really expect I'd be the one
To pull you out of here
I can't erase the past, all that you fear

And you've been asleep for days
Hanging around this place
Wondering if you will find the strength
To walk away
But it's not gonna change a thing
If you always depend on me
Did you really expect I'd be the one
To pull you out of here
To pull you out of here
To pull you out of here
To pull, to pull you out of here
