Why did you leave that message on my phone
Was it from your head? Cause I don't what I done to earn it
You could be right here, but would say what you mean or would you wait until I'm gone and you are lonely and you blame me for never understanding

And if this house was on fire would you tell me your desire
If my hands were round your throat would you tell me what I need to know
There must be some way, some way through this
If the sky was falling down would I see behind that frown
If cold steel touched your skin would you finally stop and let me in
Tell me baby how to get through this

And I done my time in the firing line
And I paid my dues hanging from a noose
And I'll do whatever it takes to put a smile upon your face
I will do whatever it takes, I will do whatever it takes
If my hands were round your throat would you tell me what I need to know
Theres's got to be some way, some way through this
If the sky was falling down would I see behind that frown
If cold steel touched your skin would you finally stop and let me in
Tell me baby how to get through this
