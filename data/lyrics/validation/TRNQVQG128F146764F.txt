[Verse 1: Jimmy Gnecco]
Pressure fried the coldest head
Bent to the side, wishing he was dead
And I would still defend
I would still defend

[Chorus 1]
I'll give up on it all
I'll give up on the greed
I'll give up on the ones
Who'll give up on me

[Verse 2]
Held up by the poor somewhere
They're unaware, but I know we are scared
If I was to give in
The fire would soon begin, again

[Chorus 2]
So I'll give up on it all
I'll give up on the greed
I'll give up on the one
Who'll give up on me

[Bridge]     [x2]
Sometimes the sun shines
Sunshine

[Chorus 3]
Did you give up on it all? (Did you give up?)
Did you give up on the greed?
(Did you give up? Did you give up?)
Did you give up on the ones?
Who'll give up on me?

[Chorus 4]
Did you give up on it all?
Would you give up on the greed?
Could you give up on the ones?
Who'll give up on me?
