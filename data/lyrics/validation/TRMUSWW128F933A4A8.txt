We'll take the long way
The roads and highways home
Fall through the middle
Get to where nothing's wrong

You fell asleep there
A place to rest your head
But i couldn't dream there
I grind my teeth and stare

Holding onto what you say
But you can't bring back yesterday

It's always been there
It always sounds this way
They're underwater
They ? keep me safe

Holding on to what you say
But you can't bring back yesterday

Holding on to what you say
But you can't bring back yesterday
Always told what not to do
Just keep me around
Yeah, just keep me around

Holding on to what you say
But you can't bring back yesterday
Always told what not to do
Just keep me around
Yeah, just keep me around
