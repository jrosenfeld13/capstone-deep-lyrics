I do it all for Hip Hop
From the bass of the beat
Underneath what we stay in the street
At the peak where we run it to me
Across the sea where were making it meet
So you better believe that
I just wont stop
Bringing the real
In the booth Im a do what I feel
Im the truth whats one in a mil
But the catch is Im brass
And Im back just to show you the skill
What? Yeah!
This is more than an epic
Any time, rhyme or line is more than impressive
Im a try and find a line to show you a message
Cos Im kind of like the guy who already said it
You can rectify the shine; Im taking the credit
Try and jeopardise the grind, youll be needing a medic
You better recognize the sign; Im coming to get it
Between the kick, hat, the snare Im staying embedded
I made an impression
Cos I feel it in my soul
I feel it in my heart
And I feel it in my stroll
Its beyond the flow, the goal
The glitter and gold
So I wrote, spoke and chose a different road
And let it be known
This is deep in my bones
Deep in my tone when I speak on the phone
Im a beat what I sow when I speak what I know
Im defeating a foe, now Im seeking the throne
I do it all for Hip Hop
From the bass of the beat
Underneath what we stay in the street
At the peak where we run it to me
Across the sea where were making it meet
So you better believe that
I just wont stop
Bringing the real
In the booth Im a do what I feel
Im the truth whats one in a mil
But the catch is Im brass
And Im back just to show you the skill
Blood! Best behold the flow
I chose to roll upon what you fuckers wont
Im lone, I roam a road where I trust and hope
And know Im prone to blow
Till the speakers blown
And overload, Im dope
Im a reach the show
And roll a cone and cope
While in focus mode
From every line I wrote
What you jokers dont
To every like you spoke was a hopeless joke
So dont provoke
Best know your limit
Im bold and hold a flow whats beyond a gimmick
I know the road I stroll is real; I live it
So Ive grown to know and revere the lyrics
From start to finish
Show you the art in minutes
Its more than spitting, its raw, this is unforgiving
I tore the rhythm, I saw that its more than living
Im born in Britain, I lord and I sought to get it
I do it all for Hip Hop
From the bass of the beat
Underneath what we stay in the street
At the peak where we run it to me
Across the sea where were making it meet
So you better believe that
I just wont stop
Bringing the real
In the booth Im a do what I feel
Im the truth whats one in a mil
But the catch is Im brass
And Im back just to show you the skill
