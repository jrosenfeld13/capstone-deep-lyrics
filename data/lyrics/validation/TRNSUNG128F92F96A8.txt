This is about glaciers
This is about glaciers and flattening
All the hills and ice
And snow and land and dirt
I like freezer boxes
I like freezer units
They preserve my home
I think I could be okay with
Being flattened and living under glaciers
So if I'm running errands
And you are on an island
I would like to say goodbye
In anticipation
In case it just comes rolling in
And we are lying under frozen landscapes
And frozen birds, it's in the winter
Northeast of the Grand Canyon
Northeast of the Grand Canyon
In winter it's a little cold
