LITTLE CHILDREN
Billy J. Kramer
(Schuman/McFarland)
- as recorded by Billy J. Kramer in 1964
Little children, you better not tell on me I'm tellin' you
Little children, you better not tell what you see And if you're good
I'll give you candy and a quarter
If you're quiet like you oughta be
And keep a secret with me
I wish they would go away
Little children, now why aren't you playin' outside I'm askin' you
You can't fool me, 'cause I'm gonna know if you hide and try to peek
I'm gonna treat you to a movie
Stop your gigglin', children do be nice
Like little sugars and spice
You saw me kissin' your sister, you saw me holdin' her hand
But if you snitch to your mother, your father won't understand
I wish they would take a nap
Little children, now why don't you go bye-bye Go anywhere at all
Little children, I know you would if you tried Go up the stairs
Me and your sister, we're goin' steady
How can I kiss her when I'm ready to
With little children like you around
I wonder what can I do around
Little children like you
