When your love has moved away
You must face yourself and you must say
I remember better days
Don't you cry 'cause she is gone
She is only moving on
Chasing mirrors through a haze

Now that you know it's nowhere
What's to stop you coming home
All you got to do is go there
Then you'll really realize what's going down

You went to a strange land searching
For a truth you felt was wrong
That's when the heartaches started
Though you're where you want to be, you're not where you belong

When your love has moved away
You must face yourself and you must say
I remember better days
Don't you cry 'cause she is gone
She is only moving on
Chasing mirrors through a haze
