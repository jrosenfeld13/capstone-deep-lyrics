Tonight, I try to let you remember
All the times, that we happy together
Sing a song, (sing a song), you and me can be singing
Tonight, such a pleasure, come on! And let yourself go!
Let you...Let yourself go! flowtation, ooooh!
Flowtation, feel the flow, its time to let yourself go (flowtation)
Feel the flow (come on!)
Live your lifem you dont get second chances
Love the night, release your seven senses
Feel the flow (feel the flow) its time to let yourself go
Tonight, such a pleasure, come on! Just let yourself go!
Feel the flow, its time to let yuurself go (flowtation)
Loose control, let yourself go, flowtation
Its time let yourself go (right now, right now)
Feel the flow, and let yourself go!
Flowtation...
Just let yourself, just let yourself go...
Just let yourself, just let yourself go...
Just let yourself, just let yourself go...
Just let yourself, just let yourself go...
(Let you... let yourself go, feel the flow now! Oooh! Let you... let yourself go!)
(Flowtation), feel the flow, its time to let yourself go! (feel the flow now!)
Loose control, let yourself go! Flowtation (Let you... let yourself go!)
Flowtation (feel the flow now!)
Flowtation, feel the flow, its time to let yourself go!
