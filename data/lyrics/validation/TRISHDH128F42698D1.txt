Gathered in this hellish pit my domain
This world of sin, rebels dome
Rebels raving with violent rage
Marching at the dawn of no return

Rebels sworn to darkness
Praise the beast
Revenge is ours

Arena of hatred, torment and bliss
Blasphemous sinister feast
Heretics screaming in bestial lust
Terror strikes and victims fall

Rebels dome
My domain
Rebels dome

Rebels feasting to praise the beast
The wasteland roars, to vengeance sworn
Explosion of chaos, death is up hand
Extirpete enemies from our dome

Rebels sworn to darkness
Praise the beast
Revenge is ours

Rebels dome

Anger rise, raptures pain, praise the beast
Burn in bliss, the abyss roars, rebels feast

Rebels dome
My domain
Rebels dome

Gathered to burn
Burn in my domain

Rebels dome
My domain
Rebels dome
