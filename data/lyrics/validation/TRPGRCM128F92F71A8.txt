I saw you, again I knew just
Where you'd be...
I stop this real soon
When you 're back
Safe with me...

[3X]
When you come home
I'll stop this...
When you come home
I'll hide it good...
I'll never cry again
When you come home...To me...

In picture
I'd see you weren't really there
In truth...I...still feel it
Hanging in the air...

When you come home
I'll stop this...
When you come home
I'll hide it good...
I'll never cry again
When you come home...To me...

When you come home
I'll stop this...
When you come home
I'll hide it good...
I'll never cry again
When you come home...To me...
