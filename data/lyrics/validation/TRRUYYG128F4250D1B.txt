Woke up again this morning
To play another game
It comes without a warning
It's nothing you can name

It's raining in the meadow
Shepherd's gone to town
Wolf has finished breakfast
No one else around

And me, I'm feeling fine
Still get lonely
I don't mind

And now we're out of danger
I guess they'll sound all clear
Throw some pennies in the fountain
And wish
For a better year
