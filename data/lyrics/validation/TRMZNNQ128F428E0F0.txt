Give me something for nothing
Give me too much too soon
I'm so damn sick of your stupid rules

Give him something for nothing
Give him too much too soon
He's so damn sick of your stupid rules

Tell me why do we always get what we want
When we don't want it no more
And how do you feel now
We still sound so sick
Still fish around, in waters you know so well

Give me something for nothing
Give me too much too soon
We're so damn sick of your rules

(We don't want your progress
We wanna be first)
Give me something for nothing
Give me too much too soon
We're so damn sick

Real life
Real life
Real life
Real life

The world's at my feet
But in your arms
A seeker of real silence am I
Deepest dreams come to real life
Shall I

Colours on the landscape grow brighter now
The long, dark years have passed by
Is the coffin of your true love
True love
