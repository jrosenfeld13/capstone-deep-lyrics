Every face I see is cold as ice
Everything I touch is pale
Ever since I lost imagination

Like a stream that flows into the sea
I am lost for all eternity
Ever since you took your love away from me

Sometimes
The sound of goodbye
Is louder
Than any drumbeat
Sometimes
The sound of goodbye
Is louder
Than any drumbeat

Every face I see is cold as ice
Everything I touch is pale
Ever since I lost imagination

Like a stream that flows into the sea
I am lost for all eternity
Ever since you took your love away from me

Sometimes
The sound of goodbye
Is louder
Than any drumbeat
Sometimes
The sound of goodbye
Is louder
Than any drumbeat

Sometimes
The sound of goodbye
Is louder
Than any drumbeat
Sometimes
The sound of goodbye
Is louder
Than any drumbeat
