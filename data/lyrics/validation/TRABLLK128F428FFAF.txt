[Verse 1]
(Hear me lord)
Forgive me lord
Please, those years when I ignored you, hmm
Forgive them lord
Those that feel they can't afford you, hmm
Help me lord, please
To rise above this dealing, hmm
Help me lord, please
To love you with more feeling, hmm

[Chorus 1]
At both ends of the road
To the left and the right
Above and below us
Out and in, there's no place that you're not in
Oh, won't you hear me lord

[Bridge]
(Hear me lord)[x4]

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
Help me lord, please
To rise a little higher, hmm
Help me lord, please
To burn out this desire, hmm
Hear me lord, please[X2]

[Chorus 2][x3]
Oh, won't you please, please
Hear me lord
Oh, hear me lord
Hear me lord
