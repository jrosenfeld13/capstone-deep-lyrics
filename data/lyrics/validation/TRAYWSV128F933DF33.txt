Beautiful morning's breaking
Leaving us all behind
All of the gloomy faces
And all the truth we hide

Nail me up, crucify
I'm on my way to the freeway
Nail me up, testify
But none of your lies will hurt me no more

Strain the truth, print your lies
Let me fall into the other side
So bail me, bail me out of you!

Now that our life is wasted
There's no use to look behind
Only the burned down places
Reminds us of what we used to have

Nail me up, crucify
I'm on my way to the freeway
Nail me up, testify
But none of your lies will hurt me no more

Strain the truth, print your lies
Let me fall into the other side
So bail me, bail me out
Fading out of your soul
I won't be there for you anymore
So bail me, bail me out

Nail me up, crucify
I'm on my way to the freeway
Nail me up, testify
Your lies will hurt me no more
Now that our life is wasted
There's no use to look behind

Strain the truth, print your lies
Let me fall into the other side
So bail me, bail me out
Fading out of your soul
I won't be there for you anymore
So bail me, bail me out of you

Of you
Of you
Of you
