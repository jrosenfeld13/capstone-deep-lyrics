[HOOK]
I know that I'm crazy
It's nobody's fault but mine
I know that I'm lazy
It's nobody's fault but mine
I know you don't love me
It's nobody's fault but mine
I know that you hate me
It's nobody's fault but mine

[VERSE 1:  ESHAM]
Once again it's on
3-5-7 chrome
Damn what's going on in my maggot dome
A pill poppin', hip hoppin' nigga with a death wish
Suicidalist
But I'm still so selfish
Used to have this hoe that I loved a while ago
But the bitch played out like disco
Cisco drinkin'
Dead bodies stinkin'
Nervous twitch
I blinked and stabbed her 26 times
With my dagger Jimmy Swaggart style
I gave a smile
Rigormortis
Body froze
Then slit her throat and watch her shake 'til her eyes close
A bloody body on my bathroom flo'
When the cops came to get me I said, 'So?"
Hey yo

[HOOK]

[VERSE 2:  ESHAM]
1, 2, 3 pigs knockin' at my door
Trying to catch the big bad wolf
I blew their house down
Boom
Bacon all over the room
Say hello to my little friend
I bust a shot again
Three cops dead, now I'm called the Cop Killer
Iller cap peeler
Bullet, body full of bloody naps
Bust caps in Superman's kneecaps
I can't believe she didn't love me, so she didn't breath
I took her to the place where the sun don't shine
Without you, there's no me
So I'm going out my fucking mind
Running blind with the bloody steel piece
I didn't know I was surrounded by police
And all I said was

[HOOK]

[VERSE 3:  ESHAM]
I heard, "Put the gun down and don't make a move!"
I ain't got shit to lose
I made one false move
Buck, buck
I struck a copper right between the eyes
And I don't give a fuck
I'll keep busting 'til he dies
The cops open fire
Bullets ripping through my tissue
And all I thought about was, "Baby girl I'm going to miss you"
I shouldn't have cut you up because our love'll last forever
And now that I'm dead we can still be together, 'cause

[HOOK]
