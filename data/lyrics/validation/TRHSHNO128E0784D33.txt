Geldof

One two three four
So whats the story? So what's the score?
What did we do? What are we guilty of?
When they shoot you down
Bring you to your knees
Until you hit the ground
And kick you in the teeth

And I dreamed I was standing, on my own
Staring out, into the twilight zone
And I dreamed of icebergs
And I dreamed of heat
And my face was melting, and the SLE

So whats the story? So what's the score?
What did we do? What are we guilty of?
When they shoot you down
Bring you to your knees
Until you hit the ground
And kick you in the teeth

Then I was kneeling, on a stone
And I heard you scream, into the telephone
Then I felt the hunger, so I think of meat
And if it wasnt you, it must have been me

And I dont like them, any more
The things they do, the things they stand for
Shoot you down, bring you to your knees
Then you hit the ground
Kick you in the teeth

But no theyll never, never
Never, never, never
Get a hold of my heart
No theyll never, never
Never, never, never
Get a hold of me
Hold of me, hold of me, hold of me

And the rain was falling, all around my head
And I blinked my eyes, so I wasnt dead
And my ears was ringing, and my tongue slipped out
And I licked my lips until my teeth fell out
And I saw you running, and you made the line
Then it was night, but it was still too bright
Then it turned to dawn, and it was still too dark
And the streets were empty, and it was time to start
And Im for thinking, between the ears
For mental process, for cogs and gears
Yes Im for flesh, and Im for mind
Oh Im for people, and Im for life!

So whats the story? So what's the score?
So what did we do? So what are we guilty of?
When they shoot you down
Bring you to your knees
Oh when you hit the ground
They kick you in the teeth

But no theyll never, never
Never, never, never
Get a hold of my heart
No theyll never, never
Never, never, never
Get a hold of me
Hold of me, hold of me, hold of me
