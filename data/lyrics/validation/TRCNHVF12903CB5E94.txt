You knew me better than anyone ever
And I remember your very first letter
We were so young
And all that we wanted was more

We fit each other like rebels on Harleys
And I knew how to answer your body
But at the speed that we drove
We were bound to wash out
We flew

I could read every word you were thinking
You gave me something I never was given
It was heaven and hell all at once
As we laughed and cried

There always needs to be one that is willing
To throw a rope down to someone who's slipping
But sometimes you gotta know when to let it go

We flew rockets to the sun
Knowing we'd crash and burn
And that's the risk we run
When you fall in love

We flew rockets to the sun
Knowing we'd crash and burn
And that's the risk we run
When you fall in love

Rockets to the sun
Knowing we'd crash and burn
And that's the risk we run
When you fall in love

We flew rockets to the sun
Knowing we'd crash and burn
And that's the risk we run
When you fall in love
In love, in love, in love, in love, in love

We flew rockets to the sun
Knowing we'd crash and burn
We flew rockets to the sun
Knowing we'd crash and burn
