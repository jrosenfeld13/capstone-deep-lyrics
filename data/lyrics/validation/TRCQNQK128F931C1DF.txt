Willie and Laura Mae Jones
Were our neighbors as long time back
They lived right down the road from us
In a shack just like our shack

We worked in the fields together
And we learned to count on each other
When you live off the land
You don't have time to think
About another man's color

The cotton was high
And the corn was growing fine
But that was another place and another time

We sit out on the front porch
In the evening when the sun went down
Willie would play and Laura would sing
And the children would dance around

And I'd bring over my guitar
And we'd play into the night
And every now and then
Willie would grin and say
"Boy, you play all right"
And that made me feel so good

Lord the cotton was high
And the corn was growing fine
But that was another place and another time

I remember we'd hitch up the mules
When Saturday rolled around
We'd always stop by Willie's house and say
"Do y'all need anything from town?"

He'd say, "No, but why don't y'all
Stop on your way back home?
And I'll get Laura Mae
To cook up some corn pone"
You know they're good

Lord the cotton was high
And the corn was growing fine
But that was another place and another time

The years rolled past our land
They took back what they'd given
And we all knew we'd have to move
If we was gonna make a living

So we all moved off
And we went our separate ways
And it sure was hard to say goodbye
To Willie and Laura Mae Jones

The cotton was high
And the corn was growing fine, yes it was
But that was another place and another time

The years rolled past our door
And we heard from them no more
Till I saw Willie down town the other day

I said, "Y'all stop by tonight
And we can sit down and eat a bite
We'd love to see your children and Laura Mae"

He shook his head real slow
And spoke with his eyes so kind
"This is another place and another time"

Lord the cotton was high
And the corn was growing fine
But that was another place and another time

Lord, Lord the cotton was high
And the corn was growing fine
But that was another place and another time

Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
The cotton was high
And the corn was growing fine
But that was another place and another time
