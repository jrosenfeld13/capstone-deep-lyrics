As the party closes
I ain't got a clue
Red and yellow roses
Nipple rings and tattoos
Well, I never met no girl
No one, no where
I never met no girl
Narcotic Prayer
If I seen her breathing
How could I adjust
Should I see her bleeding
Calling me in trust
Well I never met no girl
No one, no where
Narcotic Prayer
I copped and caught a movie
But you know it can't last
Lights come up and I just crashed
