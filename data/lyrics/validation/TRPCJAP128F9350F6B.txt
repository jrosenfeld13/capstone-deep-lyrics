Girl the night's not over (Oh, too young)
We're not getting older (Oh, too young)
They can chase forever (Oh, too young)
Cause in the morning (Oh, too young)
There's a million names to choose from
You don't care just take one
Leave a place to rest on
Because you're too young (Too young, Uh)

Yeah you're too young (Too young, Uh)
Oh you're too young (Too young, Uh)
You're too young

Too young, Oh

There goes another moment
Just wrap it up we own it
This night's a skill we hone it
And in the morning
Would you tell me that it's over?
You think that you'd do better
To stick with someone older
Because we're too young
Because I'm too young
Too young
