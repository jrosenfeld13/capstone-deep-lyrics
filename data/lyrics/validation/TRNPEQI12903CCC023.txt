Shallow gating
Mass migrating
My love
There must
Be some other better way for this

And if I'm colder
Skin worn shoulder
My love
In time
You'll break
Me down
Will you wait for this?

Cuz I've been accused
Of being unkind
So many times
So many times

Shallow gating
Mass migrating
My love, love, love, love, love

Be kind to me
My robot heart
Is fragile too
Keep it well
Keep it true
My robot heart

Be kind to me / my robot heart
Is fragile too / keep it well / keep it true
My robot heart

Call me crazy
And say I'm broken
Again
My love
I might
Be wrong
To be saying this

Kind of steely
You wouldn't want to be me
My love
Can we
Just lay
Down here
Let the night begin

Cuz I've been accused
Of being unkind
So many times
So many times
Kind of steely
You wouldn't want to be me
My love, love, love, love, love

Be kind to me / my robot heart
Is fragile too / keep it well / keep it true
My robot heart

Be kind to me / my robot heart
Is fragile too / keep it well / keep it true
My robot heart

Even a boy like me can be alive. And love and live and enjoy the company of someone as beautiful as you. We can cook on a Saturday and learn new things while we read the news and try not to cry and try not to cry... So please...

Be kind to me / my robot heart
Is fragile too / keep it well / keep it true
My robot heart

(and try not to cry and try not to cry)

Be kind to me / my robot heart
Is fragile too / keep it well / keep it true
My robot heart

(and try not to cry and try not to cry)
