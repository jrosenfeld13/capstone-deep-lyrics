Keaggy-Field

By still waters running deep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
Through the quietness it all begins
And I hear the beating of angels' wings

When silence speaks, I've got to listen
The voice of peace, louder than words
The answers I seek, reasons I'm missin'
By still waters can be heard
By still waters can be heard

Pushing harder all the while
But running empty mile after mile
Watching details as the pressure mounts
And lose sight of things that really count

When silence speaks, I've got to listen
Voice of peace, louder than words
The answers I seek, reasons I'm missin'
By still waters can be heard
By still waters can be heard

A peaceful moment is hard to find
We're all too busy, there's never time
Taking care of business, that's what we say
Through the noise and haste, life slips away
Life slips away

By still waters I will go
To find the peace I long to know
Through the silence of love's embrace
And I find in Jesus, my resting place

When silence speaks, I've got to listen
The Voice of peace, louder than words
The answers I seek, reasons I'm missin'
By still waters can be heard
By still waters can be heard
By still waters can be heard
By still waters can be heard
