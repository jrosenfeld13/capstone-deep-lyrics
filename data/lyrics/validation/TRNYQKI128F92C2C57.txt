I am so overwhelmed by who You are
And Your goodness in my life so forever I will sing
I should not be here but You chose to let me live
I am so grateful to You

The melody in my heart brings Your presence close to me
And everyday that I wake reminds me constantly
That in all my days good or bad, throughout life's bitter sweet
The melody in my heart keeps repeating
And I'll sing of Your goodness forever

Each and everyday I am tempted not to trust
The song You place in me and the voice that guides my feet
Oh, but I choose to believe Your every word
I'll stay close and love You through my praise

The melody in my heart brings Your presence close to me
And everyday that I wake reminds me constantly
That in all my days good or bad, throughout life's bitter sweet
The melody in my heart keeps repeating
And I'll sing of Your goodness forever, forever, forever, yeah

The melody in my heart brings Your presence close to me
And everyday that I wake reminds me constantly
That in all my days good or bad, throughout life's bitter sweet
The melody in my heart keeps repeating
And I'll sing of Your goodness forever
And I'll sing of Your goodness forever
And I'll sing of Your goodness forever
