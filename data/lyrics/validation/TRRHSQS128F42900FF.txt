[Verse 1]
It's how the hustle goes
See what the jukebox knows
Put my last quarter on
I'll play "Authority Song"

[Chorus 1]
Honesty or mystery?
Tell me I'm not scared anymore (I, I)
I got no secret purpose
I don't seem obvious, do I? (Do I, do I?)
I don't seem obvious, do I? (Do I, do I?)
I don't seem obvious do...

[Verse 2]
The DJ never has it
J.M.C. "Automatic" (Do I?)
If those were Roy's headphones
You bet he'd play "What Goes On" (Do I?)

[Chorus 2]
Honesty or mystery?
Tell me I'm not scared anymore (I, I)
I got no secret purpose
I don't seem obvious do I? (Do I, do I?)
I don't seem obvious, do I? (Do I, do I?)
I don't seem obvious do I? Do I?

[Bridge]
Oh, well I'm here, that means something doesn't it?
Oh, won't you dance with me a little bit?
Oh, you don't notice, cause the music's too loud

[Modified Verse 1]
It's how the hustle goes
See what the jukebox knows (Do I, do I?)
Put my last quarter on
I'll play "Authority Song" (Do I?)

[Modified Chorus 1]
Honesty or mystery?
Tell me I'm not scared anymore (I, I)
Say anything you want already I'm not scared anymore (I, I)
Honesty or mystery, want something else?
Just tell me I'm not scared anymore (I, I)
I got no secret purpose
I don't seem obvious, do I? (Do I?)

[Outro]
I don't seem obvious, do I? (Do I?)
I don't seem obvious, do I? (Do I?)
I don't seem obvious, do I? (Do I?)
I don't seem obvious, do I? (Do I?)
I don't seem obvious, do I? (Do I?)
I don't seem obvious, do I? (Do I?)
I don't seem obvious, do I? (Do I?)
