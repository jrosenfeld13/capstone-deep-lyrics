Hey baby
Shh
You don't have to say it, I know
I know I haven't been there for you lately, I'm sorry
It's not that I'm running out on you
I wanna be into you
You're all that I want
You're all that I need
So please
Don't leave me

[Verse 1]
We were in love
And now you tell me that
You wanna turn and walk away
All of my sunshine
And happiness
Turned to rainy days

How could you be in love so strong
And throw it all away
You promised to love me
Never to leave me
Forever and a day

[Pre-Hook]
Sometimes I feel that I'm lost without you
Lost without your love
Sometimes I feel that I'm going under
There's no one above you

Sometimes I feel that I just don't know the words I need to say
Don't you ever go away (I'm so lost without you baby)

Baby don't leave me

[Hook]
You're all that I want (You're all that I want)
You're all that I need
And I just can't live without you
Baby don't leave me
Don't leave me

You're all that I want
You're all that I need
And I just can't live without you
Baby don't leave me
Don't leave me

[Verse 2]
You know I need you in my life
Like the flower needs the rain
I want you by my side
To keep my heart from pain
No need for promises
No need for sympathy
All that I hope for
All that I pray for is
That you'll stay with me

[Pre-Hook]
Sometimes I feel that I'm lost without you
Lost without your love
Sometimes I feel that I'm going under
There's no one above you

Sometimes I feel that I just don't know the words I need to say
Don't you ever go away (I'm so lost without you baby)

Baby don't leave me

[Hook]
You're all that I want (You're all that I want)
You're all that I need
And I just can't live without you
Baby don't leave me
Don't leave me

You're all that I want
You're all that I need
And I just can't live without you
Baby don't leave me
Don't leave me

[Breakdown]
(Skatting)
You're all that I want
(Skatting)
Don't you ever ago away

(Don't go)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

You're all I want
You're all that I need
Baby, you're all I need

Listen, shh

[Bridge]
You're all that I want (You're all that I need)
You're all that I need (You're all that I want)
You're all that I want (Baby don't leave me)
Baby don't leave me

(You're all I want)
You're all that I want
(You're all I need)
You're all that I need
(You're all I want)
You're all that I want
(Baby don't leave me)
Baby don't leave me
(Repeat until fade)
