Southern nights
Have you ever felt a Southern night
Free as a breeze, not to mention the trees
Whistling tunes that you know and love so

Southern nights
Just as good even when close your eyes
I apologize to anyone who can truly say
That he has found a better way

Southern skies
Have you ever noticed Southern skies?
Its precious beauty lies just beyond the eye
It goes running through your soul
Like the stories told of old

Old man, he and his dog
They walk the old land
Every flower touched his cold hand
As he slowly walked by
Weeping willows would cry for joy, joy

Feels so good
Feels so good, it's frightening
Wish I could stop this world from fighting
La da da da da la da da da........

Mysteries like this and
Many others in the trees
Blow in the night in the Southern skies

Southern nights
They feel so good, it's frightening
Wish I could stop this world from fighting
La da da da da........

Southern skies
Have you ever noticed...
