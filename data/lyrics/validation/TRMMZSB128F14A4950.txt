Once upon a good time on this very day
Somewhere in another universe
A band got in a van and drove for miles on end
They just this minute got here with no time to rehearse
They've not even had a sound-check but don't worry folks, it's true
Whatever Major Happy did for them they'll do for you!

Here we are once again on another one night stand
Major Happy's Up and Coming Once Upon A Good Time Band
Major Happy, Major Happy, Majah Happy, Made ya happy
Major Happy's Up and Coming Easy-Going Good Time Band
We're only here for you out there so give yourselves a great big hand
Major Happy, Major Happy, Majah Happy, Made ya Happy
So put your hands together and let's really hear it for
Major Happy's Up and Coming Once Upon a Good Time Band...
