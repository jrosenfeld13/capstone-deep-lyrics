Baby, baby start looking at me!

I know you've got a left eye
I know you've got a right
But will they be appearing together tonight

We're always cheek to cheek or cheek to face or face to cheek
But never face to hey, what do you say

Jackie serves to Johnny
Johnny serves to Jack
Jackie serves to Johnny, Johnny serves to Jack

I ain't that fussy that a bit of second best would cause
A sudden little turn in our affair

Once you've been ushered in, you ought to face the music
And ignore the guiding hand, surely you can

You ain't Whistler's Mother
Or any other art
You ain't seen me lately though we never part
