Did you get what you wanted
When you told me good-bye
Did you get what you thought you needed
To make a grown man cry

Now theres a hungry look
Inside your eyes
And theres a shiver i felt
Between your thighs

I've been good and kind
And sweet and nice
For way too long

I'm gonna be bad
And its gonna feel good
I'm gonna do every thing your mama said we
Never should

I'm gonna be bad
And I wanna do wrong
And you're gonna be every broken heart
Inside my every song

Was it really as easy
As you made it seem

I never heard you
Raise your voice you
Never heard me scream

When you tuck yourself
In bed at night and
Read a book alone by candle light
And you wonder what
I just might be getting into

I'm gonna be bad
And its gonna feel good
I'm gonna do everything your
Mama said we never should

I'm gonna be bad
And I wanna be Cruel
I'm gonna try everything they taught me
Down in catholic school
Cause if you wanna see
The brand new me
Well just look at the brand new you
I'm gonna be bad
Every time i think about you
I'm gonna be bad
