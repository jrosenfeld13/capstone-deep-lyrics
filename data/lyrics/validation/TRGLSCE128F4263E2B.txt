Lost like a child in the dark
A whisper of sadness cries in your heart
Why can't you open your eyes
So you can see how this love is to be
There can be no mistaking
My heart is right here waiting

Give me one more chance
Just tell me how to reach you
And I'll be your friend
Give me one more chance
I have to know where to begin
One more chance

I am no stranger to pain
I know what it's like to stand in the rain
Don't try to hide what is true
You know how I feel it's all up to you
Why can't you hear me calling
I'll keep your world from falling

Give me one more chance...

Give me one more chance
Don't be afraid to show me
What you feel inside
Give me one more chance
You can not hide behind your pride
So give me one more chance
One more chance

I'll wipe away your tears
You'll see
Believe in me if you love me

Give me one more chance...

Oh I want you back
If you love me, give me one more chance
