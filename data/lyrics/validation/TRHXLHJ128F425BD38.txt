The wind plays flute through the cellar door
And on my window sill plays a sad old song

I hope tonight you will touch my hair and draw ghosts on my back

Walk the shore to impassable
Shout at screaming waves, shout at silent rocks

I think tonight I'll dream of salty tounges, so tears drip down my legs

The wind plays flute through the cellar door
And on my window sill plays a sad old song

I hope tonight you will touch my hair and draw ghosts on my back
