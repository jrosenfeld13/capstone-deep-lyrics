[Verse 1]
For every treasure lost and found
During my young days in the sun
When all the children loved to run
Felt so good when I was home
For I was never left alone
I had a Dad when I was down
When I was sad I had a Mum

[Verse 2]
For every long day in the heat
And every one night out of sleep
I have a memory to keep
I met you someday on the street
For every time I wasn't there
And all the things I couldn't share
For all the words friends wouldn't dare to sing

[Chorus]
I care, I care
