Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school

Well, I don't care about history
(Rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school)
'Cause that's not where I wanna be
(Rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school)
I just wanna have some kicks
I just wanna get some chicks
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school

Well, the girls out there knock me out, you know
(Rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school)
Cruisin' around in my GTO
(Rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school)
I hate the teachers and the principal
Don't wanna be taught to be no fool
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school

Fun, fun, rock 'n' roll high school
Fun, fun, rock 'n' roll high school
Fun, fun, rock 'n' roll high school
Fun, fun, oh baby
Fun, fun, oh baby
Fun, fun, fun, fun

Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
