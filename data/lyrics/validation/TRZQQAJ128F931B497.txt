[Verse 1]
In my hurry, I can ever seem to get nowhere
When I [?] out
Close my eyes and Im halfway there
All I carry is this remedy to [?] you again
So Im sending out this signal that Im traveling to
As fast as I can

[Chorus]
To the [?] station gate
Among the Sundays just to make it through
Another window in this terminal wait
There is no easy easy to pay these dues
Sing for this transcendental meditation blues

[Verse 2]
I dont worry  the [?] man beside me has got on his face
I know Im weary now, I know that these old greyhound
Buses seem better days

[Chorus]
Then this dixie highway run
Old [?] in this trisco shoes
Another short and the same old song
There aint no better way to send the news
So I sing this Transcendental Meditation Blues

[Verse 3]
When Im broke down are you waiting?
Are you waiting with the horse like [?]
Do you wonder will I always do speed to [?]
The river is wide and the valley low
Miles to go and mountains to [?]

[Outro]
Bended life for my only one
Through the grand post and the broken heaven news
For this transcendental meditation blues
