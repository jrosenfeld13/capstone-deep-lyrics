You are screaming at me
Dont get me started
Saying you're gonna leave
Thats just retarded
Leaving me all alone
To throw the party
To celebrate your fate
You are departed
It seems as though
Your mouth is closed
It's painted shut
With guilt
No more screaming at me
Dont get me started
No more saying you'll leave
Thats just retarded
No more leaving alone
To throw the party
I'll just celebrate fate
You are departed
It seems as though
Your mouth is closed
It's painted shut
With guilt
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
It seems as though
Your mouth is closed
Its painted shut
With guilt
It seems as though
Your mouth is closed
It's painted shut
With guilt
