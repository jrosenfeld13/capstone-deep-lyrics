You're drifting to a dream
Lost in the frozen night
Shivering as the wolves start howling

Out of place, out of time
Watch the shadows come alive
Echoes in the wind, bells tolling

[refrain:]
I'm the angel fly with me
Leap into eternity
Dreamworld, dreamworld is calling
Close your eyes and ride the night
Let the darkness fill with light
Dreamworld, dreamworld
You're falling down...

Beyond all fantasies
Your memories flashing by
Don't know if you're awaken or dreaming

See the old turning into young
The dead come back to life
Laughing at all you believe in

[refrain 3x]

Take my hand I'll lead the way
Through fire and ice to light of day
Dreamworld, dreamworld
You're falling down...
Down down...
