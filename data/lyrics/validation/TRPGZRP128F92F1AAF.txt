[Verse 1]
The days keep dragging on
Those rats keep pushing on, woah
The slowest race around
We all just race around, woah
And when the hope's gone the weight falls on me
Yeah, when I'm gone the weight falls on me

[Verse 2]
No sense in signing up
Your name's already in
Go ahead, yeah, fuck it up
The next guy pays for it
'Cause what I get ain't half of what I give
And half don't suit me anyway
'Cause what I get ain't half of what I give
And half don't suit me anyway

[Chorus]
Maybe I sacrifice
To feel like I'm alive
Penniless, its all the same
At least I'll die with a name

I AIN'T DEAD YET

[Refrain 1]
GIVE IT BACK
OR I'LL TAKE IT
GIVE IT BACK
OR I'LL TAKE IT
OR I'LL TAKE IT
OR I'LL TAKE IT

[Chorus] (x2)
Maybe I sacrifice
To feel like I'm alive
Penniless, its all the same
At least I'll die with a name

[Refrain 2]
OR I'LL TAKE IT
GIVE IT BACK
OR I'LL TAKE IT
GIVE IT BACK
OR I'LL TAKE IT
OR I'LL TAKE IT

[Outro](x2)
And when the hope's gone the weight falls on me
Yeah, when I'm gone the weight falls on me
