Fortunately I've been blessed
Blessed with love and happiness
(Happiness)
Who'd have known a soul so....
Pure could reach and save my loneliness
(Loneliness)

When i think that
Day to day i live a life so full of complications
Sobered by the thought of lies
But i just smile (But i just smile)
At the thought of you (At the thought of you)
By my side

Everyday my hopes evolve
When i see you
Now all around, my world is whole
I've no need to be insecure, i'm self-assured
Everytime i feel you
I feel you

People fall and lose their way
Because of you i'll know, i'll stay
(Know i'll stay, i know i'll stay)
Guided by our love
I'll always have a reason to pave our way
(Lovin' is leading the way)

Never give up on your lovin'
You're the one that keeps my heart growin'
Never give up on your lovin'
You're the one that keeps my heart growin' grownin'
