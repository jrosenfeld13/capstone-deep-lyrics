Your rough beauty catches my breath
Trashed flashed and too much make-up
Spiked-heeled sky-scraped
But baby you got some guts
With your toothy grin around your gun
What did you say?

Wanna die young, die young
Thats what you said
Thats what you did
Youre such a clich
Behind your mirrored shades

Well its been no laugh
In your oxygen mask
You suffer your last gasp
Strapped in
Draining
The stuttering light fades at last

With your burned-out
Country club superstar looks
As the rock cooks
Cocktail hour smile collapse
Slack-jawed black-eyed excess
Yeah baby youre a total knock-out

Remember what you said to me?

Scraping the gutter
For hard-ons and hardwire
In the guitar lazy night
