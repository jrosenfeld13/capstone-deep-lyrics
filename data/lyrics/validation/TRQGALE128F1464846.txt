[Intro]
Never give up
Yeah, yeah
Never give up

[Chorus: All + Natasha Hamilton]
The tide is high, but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
I'm not the kind of girl who gives up just like that
Oh, no, oh

[Verse 1: Liz McClarnon]
It's not the things you do that tease and hurt me bad
But it's the way you do the things you do to me
I'm not the kind of girl who gives up just like that
Oh, no, oh

[Chorus: All]
The tide is high, but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one (ah)
The tide is high, but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one, ooh

[Post-Chorus: All + Natasha Hamilton]
Number one (my number one)
Number one (number one)

[Verse 2: Jenny Frost]
Every girl wants you to be her man
But I'll wait right here 'til it's my turn
I'm not the kind of girl who gives up just like that
Oh, no, oh

[Chorus: All + Natasha Hamilton]
The tide is high, but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one (the tide is high)
The tide is high, but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one

[Post-Chorus: All + Natasha Hamilton]
Number one (my number one)
Number one (number one)

[Bridge: All]
Every time that I get the feeling
You give me something to believe in
Every time that I got you near me
I know the way that I want it to be
But you know, Im gonna take my chance now
Im gonna make it happen somehow
And you know I can take the pressure
A moment's pain for a lifetime's pleasure

[Breakdown: Natasha]
Every girl wants you to be her man
But I'll wait right here 'til it's my turn
I'm not the kind of girl who gives up just like that
Oh, no, oh

[Chorus: All]
The tide is high, but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
The tide is high, but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one

[Bridge: All]
Every time that I get the feeling
You give me something to believe in
Every time that I got you near me
I know the way that I want it to be
But you know, Im gonna take my chance now
Im gonna make it happen somehow
And you know I can take the pressure
A moment's pain for a lifetime's pleasure

[Outro: All]
The tide is high, but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
