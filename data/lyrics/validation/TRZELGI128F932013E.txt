I think i'm letting you go real slow
You never did me any good anyway
I think i'm ending this low
You always said you would go someday

You're taking this bad i know i know
Calm down and i'll be still so very still
Oh come here out of the cold
This draft is making me ill so ill

And you keep on giving me one for the road
And you keep on telling me stories i know
And you keep on keep on or so i've been told
And you keep on giving me one for the road

Wake me covered in one inch snow
Wake me up before you go go go
You do prefer me still so very still
Oh come here out of the cold
This drug is making me start to feel

And you keep on giving me one for the road
And you keep on telling me stories i know
