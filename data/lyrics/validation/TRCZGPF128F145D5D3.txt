(You made me love you)
I didn't wanna do it, I didn't wanna do it
You made me want you and all the time you knew it
I guess you always knew it

(You made me happy sometimes)
You made me glad
(But there were times, dear)
You made me feel so bad, you made me cry for

I didn't wanna tell you, I didn't wanna tell you
I want some love that's true
Yes, I do, 'deed I do, you know I do
(So give me, give me, give me, give me what I cry for)

You know you got the kind of kisses that I'd die for
You know you made me
('Cause I didn't wanna tell you
I didn't wanna tell you I love somebody, it's true)
Yes, I do, you know, I do, oh, how I do

Give me, give me what I cry for
You know you've got the kind of kisses that I'd die for
You know you made me love you
(I didn't wanna do, I didn't wanna do it)
