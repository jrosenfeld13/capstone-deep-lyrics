I put you in the flyest gear, making sure you're tight
Perpertrating, making you think everything's alright
Call you on my cell phone baby even on peak time
The crazy things I do for love
Flossin' baby acting like the money ain't a thing
Only if you promise girl that you will try no game
Kiss me girl and I'll spend every dollar to my name
The crazy things i do for love

Movies, hanging out, spending Time
Anything my girl wants
Phone Calls, I love you cards
Shopping malls, Nothings ever too much
I know I can't afford it baby
But I'll do The best I can lady
Cause you my everything
One day with my ring
I'll do all for you Baby

I put you in the flyest gear, making sure you're tight
Perpertrating, making you think everything's alright
Call you on my cell phone baby even on peak time
The crazy things I do for love
Flossin' baby acting like the money ain't a thing
Only if you promise girl that you will try no game
Kiss me girl and I'll spend every dollar to my name

In the park, Having fun, thats whats up

Roses cause I care and I'll be there
Cross my heart I swear
