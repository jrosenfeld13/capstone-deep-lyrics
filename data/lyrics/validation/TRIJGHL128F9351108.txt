Running hard towards what used to be
Losing ground in changes sliding endlessly
Reaching out for mirrors hidden in the web
Painting lines upon your face inside instead

Sounds so bad the music's flat on every line
Songs of blackened lace know you're dying all the time
Sounds so bad you let the music take your soul
Slipping through the day
Lose the only way you know

Running hard towards what used to be
Losing ground in changes sliding endlessly
Reaching out for things you want to see
Find reflections of insane reality

La la ...

Running hard towards what used to be
Losing ground in changes sliding endlessly
Reaching out for shadows passing through
See the dark around is coming down on you
