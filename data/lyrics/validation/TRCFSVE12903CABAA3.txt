If there was nothing that I could say
Turned your back and you just walked away
Leaves me numb inside, I think of you
Together is all I knew
We moved too fast but I had no signs
I would try to turn the hands of time
Then looked to you for a reason why
The love we had passed me by
And as the sun would set you would rise
Fall from the sky into paradise
Is there no light in your heart for me?
You've closed your eyes, you don't longer see
There were no lies between me and you
You said nothing of what you knew
But there was still something in your eyes
Left me helpless and paralyzed
You could give a million reasons, change the world and change the time
Could not give me the secrets of your heart and of your mind
In the darkness that surrounds me, now there is no peace of mind
Your careless words undo me, leave the thought of us behind
You could give a million reasons, change the world and change the time
Could not give me the secrets of your heart and of your mind
In the darkness that surrounds me, now there is no peace of mind
Your careless words undo me, leave the thought of us behind
If there was nothing that I could say
Turned your back and you just walked away
Leaves me numb inside, I think of you
Together is all I knew
We moved too fast but I had no signs
I would try to turn the hands of time
Then looked to you for a reason why
The love we had passed me by
And as the sun would set you would rise
Fall from the sky into paradise
Is there no light in your heart for me?
You've closed your eyes, you don't longer see
There were no lies between me and you
You said nothing of what you knew
But there was still something in your eyes
Left me helpless and paralyzed
