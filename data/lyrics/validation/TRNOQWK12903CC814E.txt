Born to lose i've lived my life in vain
All my dreams have always caused me pain
All my life i've always been so blue
Born to lose and now i'm losing you

Born to lose it seems so hard to bear
How i always long to have you near
You were all the happiness i knew
Born to lose and now i'm losing you

Born to lose i can't believe your gone
It's so hard to face that empty dawn
All my life i've always been so blue
Born to lose and now i'm losing you

There's no use to dream of happiness
All i see is only loneliness
All my life i've always been so blue
Born to lose and now im losing you
