All my life I wanted someone just like you
All my life I wanted someone just like you
I did all I could to try and get along with you
I lie for you I cry for you baby what more can I do?
I lie for you I cry for you baby what more can I do?
I did all I could to try and get along with you
I can't go on this way
I can't go on this way
You went away and left me
What you mean to me
