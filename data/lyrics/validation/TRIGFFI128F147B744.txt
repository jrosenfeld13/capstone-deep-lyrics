Nineteen
Is not the age of reason
I didn't have a reason
To setting you free
I've seen
A lot of love go sour
But that's not our love
You see the problem was
I was only nineteen
Yeah, I was only nineteen
Finished up with high school
Headed to a state school
Wandered into you
Big screen
Kissing in a movie
God, you moved me around
We got seriously down
But I was only nineteen
All I ever wanted to do
Was lie around in bed with you
I was only nineteen, I was only nineteen
I was only nineteen, I was only nineteen
I've seen
A lot of love go bad now
That's not how our affair
Would've wound up I swear
But I was only nineteen
All I ever wanted to do
Was lie around in bed with you
I was only nineteen, I was only nineteen
I was only nineteen, I was only nineteen
I was only nineteen, I was only nineteen
I was only nineteen
