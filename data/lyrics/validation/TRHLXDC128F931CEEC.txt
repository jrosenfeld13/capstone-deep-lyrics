[Marilyn Monroe & Jane Russel]
We're just two little girls from Little Rock
We lived on the wrong side of the tracks
But the gentlemen friends who used to call
They never did seem to mind at all
They came to the wrong side of the tracks

[Marilyn Monroe]
Then someone broke my heart in Little Rock
So I up and left the pieces there
Like a little lost lamb I roamed about
I came to New York and I found out
That men are the same way everywhere

[Marilyn Monroe & Jane Russel]
I was young and determined to be wined and dined and ermined
And I worked at it all around the clock
Now one of these days in my fancy clothes
I'm a go back home and punch the nose
Of the one who broke my heart (the one who broke my heart)
The one who broke my heart in Little Rock, Little Rock, Little Rock... Little Rock

[Jane Russel]
I'm just a little girl from Little Rock
A horse used to be my closest pal
Though I never did learn to read or write
I learned about love in the pale moonlight
And now I'm an educated gal

[Marilyn Monroe]
I learned an awful lot in Little Rock
And here's some advice I'd like to share :
Find a gentleman who is shy or bold
Or short or tall, or young or old

[Marilyn Monroe & Jane Russel]
As long as the guy's a millionaire!

[Marilyn Monroe & Jane Russel]
For a kid from the small street I did very well on Wall Street
Though I never owned a share of stock
And now that I'm known in the biggest banks
I'm going back home and give my thanks
To the one who broke my heart (the one who broke my heart)
The one who broke my heart...
In Little Rock!
