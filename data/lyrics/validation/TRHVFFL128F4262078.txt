As mortal death was at the door, the night seemed darker than before
Silence but no peace, visions of agony

The sweat and blood pour out
Hemorrhaging from the pores of His body

Rise up, the betrayer is at hand

The Son of Man betrayed into the hands of sinners
Innocent blood will be shed by the hands of the guilty

As mortal death was at the door, the night seemed darker than before
The sweat and blood pour out
Hemorrhaging from the pores of His body
