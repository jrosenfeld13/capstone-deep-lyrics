I've got to get up and get out of your way
And the best that I could do is take the easy way
Oh, it's such a shame
I can't call you up, can't think of what to say
And everyone falls in and out of everyday, oh it hurts to say

[Chorus]
The town crusher called to say he's on his way
We'll go around and then he'll go away
But it's okay
'Cause he's got a life and times
And he's got a bitter mind
And either way I'm sure he's hard to find

I try to keep up on the news today
All the papers that I'm buying, all the things they say
What does it say?
Don't let your children fly an aeroplane
And you have to save a city before you can give a name
Oh, it's such a pain

[Chorus]
