When I first start courting me honey
This likkle thing she'd always tell me
Find a penny, you pick it up
All day long it will bring you luck

Well at first I found it suspicious
That me gal should be so superstitious
Me bawl, "woman I think you're mad
No penny ever brought luck - good or bad", but she say

Every day I find a penny
Lord, every day it bring me luck

We were walking down the road one morning
On the street I spied something shining
When me bend down to pick it up, "ah look ya
Mojo penny come to bring me luck"

You see no girl like to be teased
So the next instant she give me the freeze
She say, "honey if you don't believe
This time I pack up all me things and leave", oh she say

Every day I find a penny
Lord, every day it bring me luck

I can see how you might find it funny
A gal to quit her man over a penny
Friends it's amusing, but it's true
For that's exactly what me girlfriend do

Now for days I've sat sad and lonely
Man of good luck I can't find any
All she left me was a piece of bread
A ball of string and the thing she said, wo yeah
Lord, yeah
Every day I find a penny
Lord, every day it bring me luck

'til this afternoon on the street
I hear a tinkling at my feet
When I look down in front of me - what I see
Lucky penny sent from heaven for me

As I cried my very last tear
The birds they sang, the sky became clear
And out of nowhere me gal appear, and she say
"here's a penny for your thoughts, my dear"

Now my story has found a good end
Me gal and me are happy again
You see, miracles sometimes happen
Oh yes, but only when you let them in, now me say

Every day I find a penny
Lord, every day it bring me luck
