I did not want to be stuck
One second longer
Than I had to be there
Stuck inside the door

I'm always scared
Of slamming my fingers in the door
Because the last time that I left
I slammed my fingers in the door

When you want to get out
You get up
And walk straight through the door

You stop and think about it
Thinking just one second longer
Then a car could hit me in it
If I thought more than I did

I did not want to be stuck
One second longer
Than I had to be there
Stuck inside the door

I'm always scared
Of slamming my fingers in the door
Because the last time that I left
I slammed my fingers in the door

When you want to get out
You get up
And walk straight through the door

You stop and think about it
Thinking just one second longer
Then a car could hit me in it
If I thought more than I did
