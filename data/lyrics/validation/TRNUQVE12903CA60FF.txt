Crooked man down a crooked mile
Crooked backbone, crossed out smile
Crooked cat, crooked mouse
We live together in a crooked little house

We're all fine, we're all fine
We fit together like worms on a line
We're so good, we're so nice
We stick together like dirty horse flies

Crooked eyes, crooked tooth
Crooked mind bending back the truth
A crooked road on a crooked town
Looking down at the crumbs on the ground

We're all fine, we're all fine
We fit together like nickles on a dime
We're so good, we're so nice
We talk the mumbo jumbo Greenwich Mean Time

We're all fine, we're all fine
We fit together like nickles on a dime
We're so good, we're so nice
We talk the mumbo jumbo Greenwich Mean Time
