In emergency
I fire my thoughts at you
Responding or not maybe
Reacting a lot you'll be

Turn around now
She's killing with looks at ease
Defending or not maybe
Depending a lot I'll be

And as we get lost deliver our souls
To each other we lose control
And start to bother about friends
We used to know

And as we get lost inside this dream
With each other nobody sees
Or seems to notice that we're losing
What we're fighting for

While the moments pass
I watch every move you make
Betray us or not who cares
Surrender the heart that tears

As I catch your breath
You stand there and watch me bleed
We'll blend into one maybe
But never apart you'll see

And as we get lost deliver our souls
To each other we lose control
And start to bother about friends
We used to know

And as we get lost inside this dream
With each other nobody sees
Or seems to notice that we're losing
What we're fighting for

Turn around now

And as we get lost deliver our souls
To each other we lose control
And start to bother about friends
We used to know

And as we get lost inside this dream
With each other nobody sees
Or seems to notice that we're losing
What we're fighting for
