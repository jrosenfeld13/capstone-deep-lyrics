I can sing a rainbow

Red and yellow and pink and green
Orange and purple and blue
I can sing a rainbow
Sing a rainbow, sing a rainbow too

Listen with your eyes, listen with your eyes
And sing everything you see
You can sing a rainbow
Sing a rainbow, sing along with me

The sun is yellow, the grass is green
Look how the sky is blue
We can sing a rainbow
Sing a rainbow, surely you can too

Listen with your eyes, listen with your eyes
And sing everything you see
You can sing a rainbow
Sing a rainbow, sing along with me

The sky is black, the clouds are white
And it's raining too
But we can sing a rainbow
Sing a rainbow of happiness for you
