Turn it inside out so I can see
The part of you that's driftin' over me
And when I wake you're, you never there
But when I sleep you're, you everywhere
You everywhereJust tell me, how I got this far?
Just tell me, why you're here? And who you are?
'Cause every time I look, you're never there
And every time I sleep, you're always there'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I close my eyes it's you I see
You're everything I know
That makes me believe
I'm not alone, ooo ooo ooo
I'm not aloneI recognize the way you make me feel
It's hard to think that you might not be real
I sense it now the water's getting deep
I try to wash the pain away from me
Away from me'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I close my eyes it's you I see
You're everything I know
That makes me believe
I'm not alone, ooo ooo
I'm not aloneI am not alone
Waa ooo, waa ooo, waa ooo, waaAnd when I touch your hand
It's then I understand
The beauty that's within
It's now that we begin
You always light my way
I hope there never comes a day aay aay
No matter where I go
I'll always feel you so'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I close my eyes it's you I see
You're everything I know
That makes me believe
I'm not alone, waa waa ohh yea'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I catch my breath
It's you I breathe
You're everything I know
That makes me believe
I'm not alone, waa waa ohhYou're in everyone I see
So tell me
Do you see me?
