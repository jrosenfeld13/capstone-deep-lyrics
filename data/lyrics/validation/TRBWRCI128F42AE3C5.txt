Shes' the same colour as my dreams
I'm not quite sure of what that means
All that I know is when I sleep
Her face is all that I can see

Infatuation over me
Got the kind of love I can't resist
Words don't do the same as justice
I'd give my life for one kiss

From her head, to her feet
She's the best part of me
Miss my everything (ooh)
Is so much more
There's no way to describe
What she is to my life
Miss my everything (miss my everything)
Is so much more

No matter how hard I will try
No heaven, earth I feel inside
Babe you're more than diamonds and pearls
My simple love for this one girl

Infatuation over me
Got the kind of love I can't resist
Words don't do the same as justice
I'd give my life for one kiss (Ooooooooh)

From her head, to her feet
She's the best part of me
Miss my everything (ooh)
Is so much more (is so much more)
There's no way to describe (ooh)
What she is to my life (to my life)
Miss my everything (everything)
Is so much more

More..

Is so much to me

From her head, to her feet
She's the best part of me
Miss my everything
Is so much more (is more)
There's no way to describe
What she is to my life
Miss my everything (everything)
Is so much more

From her head, to her feet (from her head to her feet)
She's the best part of me (part of me)
Miss my everything (everything)
Is so much more (so much more)
There's no way to describe
What she is to my life
Miss my everything (everything)
Is so much more (is so much more.)

Much more
