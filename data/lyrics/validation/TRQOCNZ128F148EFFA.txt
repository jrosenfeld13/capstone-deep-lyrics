No more tell you woman
To be so mad with me
I didn't do nothing
For you to treat me eviley

Cause I made up my mind
I made up my mind
I made up my mind
That your the girl I want to be mine

Oh listen to my story
Before you send me away
Please don't nail me baby
Until you've heard what I got to say

Cause I made up my mind
I made up my mind
I made up my mind
That your the girl I want to be mine

I just want you baby
To be on my side
Show me your sweet nature
Act a little nice and kind

Cause I made up my mind
I made up my mind
I made up my mind
That your the girl I want to be mine

Oh listen to my story
Before you send me away
Please don't nail me baby
Until you've heard what I got to say

Cause I made up my mind
I made up my mind
I made up my mind
That your the girl I want to be mine

I just want you baby
To be on my side
Show me your sweet nature
Act a little nice and kind

Cause I made up my mind
I made up my mind
I made up my mind
That your the girl I want to be mine
