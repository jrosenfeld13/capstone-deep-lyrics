Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh!
Oh-Oh-Oh!

Let's go down
To forgiving sea
The lights were found
When all you do is bleed

If you're sad then you may come with me
We can be sad together as we figure a way

To escape
This world of emptiness and
Full of hate
Because you'll never forget
The only place that we are free
Is on this bleeding stage and that's
Where i'll be

I wanna drown
Myself inside you
Love's desire
Is to make all pure and true

Life when i was a little boy so alive
Now i'm old and just want to find a way

To escape
This world of emptiness and
Full of hate
So i run down to the sea cause
The only place that we are free
Is inside a wave and that's
Where i'll be
As i Bleed-I-I-I-I-I!!

When i was a little boy i was alive
Now i'm old and know what goes on
Behind Your Mother Fucking Eyes!!
So That!

And when the beat goes down
Come on come on come on come on!
And when the beat goes down
Come on come on come on come on!
And when the beat goes down
Come on come on come on come on!
When the beat goes down
Come on come on come on come on!

I will be free
So come with me

To escape
This world of emptiness and
Full of hate
Sometimes you'll never forget
The only place that we are free
Is on this bleeding stage and that's
Where i'll be
As i
Bleed-I-I-I-I-I!

Come on come on come on come on!
Come on come on come on come on!
Come on come on come on come on!
Come on come on come on come on!
