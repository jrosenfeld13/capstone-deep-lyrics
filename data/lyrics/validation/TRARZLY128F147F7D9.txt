[Verse 1]
I grew up in a town where tough was a cigarette
And a souped up car on a county road
Nothing much to do back then
So we'd make bets
On how much drink a guy could hold
And I held my own
Learn to hold my own
Daddy works some dead-end job at the concrete plant
Mama taught the Sunday bible class
For eighteen years I remember thinking
There was more to life than that
So I ran the streets to beat the Devil
Going just as fast as I could fly

[Chorus]
Because I came here to live
I didn't come here to die

[Verse 2]
Mama used to wait for me with the porch light on
Worried about her little boy until I got home
Daddy he'd say, listen son
But back then there wasn't much
That I didn't already know
I reckon I was doing close to 80
When I felt the tire slip out from under me
And I never set out looking for Jesus
So I guess Jesus came looking for me
And He found me upset down in a ditch
Smoking gas in my eyes

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Sunday morning I got up and I went to church
That summer I got a job and I went to work
Met a girl in town put some money down
On a little house with a yard
Our little boy was due in September
But he came early in July
For eighteen days all I remember
Was sitting there at his side
Saying, son open up your eyes
Just open up your eyes

[Chorus]
