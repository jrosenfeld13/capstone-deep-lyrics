Missing the train every morning at 8:52
Sipping coffee from the same cup as you
The sharing of secrets we thought no one else knew
That's what I miss about you

The new way that love had made me see
Your bashful grin when you asked if I would like your key
The knowing way you used to caress me
That's what I miss about you

You stole in with your starry smile exciting me
Driving with you in your new car, feeling free
If it's true that love is blind, then I was blind willingly
You made me feel we had a future, that could be and would be

The way you said I'd be no one on my own
Your habit of soaking yourself in over-priced cologne
The way you turned the light out when I knew you were home
That's what I don't miss about you

I bet you're using your weary magic like it's new
Driving so fast with a new fool beside you
Presumably believing she's the last of the lucky few
I wonder if she knows she's being lied to like I do

The way I only doubted myself when I was with you
Like I was a fool for expecting something from life too
Your skill of putting me down in-front of everyone we knew
That's what I don't miss about you
