What do you want from me
Why do you even bother
What are you looking for
You can't get from anyone other

You only care when you can get
Something out of the situation
You do whatever is beneficial for only you

Cynical
It's a cynical world
Do you have to make it so obvious

I know you say men are swine but so are you
We all have our nature to attend to
Don't blame me cause I like full-figured women
It's inside of me, deep inside of me
Chronic by now, chronic by now

Cynical
It's a cynical world
Do you have to make it so obvious
