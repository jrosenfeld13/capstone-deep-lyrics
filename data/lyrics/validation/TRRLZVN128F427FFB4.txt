I see the truth in the eyes of the sky
And since I was a baby I've been destined to die
This life it has no meaning
I greet death like a friend
I'm in a state of worship
I've got a faith I must defend
My ticket to the heavenly
My salvation from Hell
My gateway to eternity
My escape from this insanity

Chorus:
My death will be my final stand
My death will be my sacrifice
My death will be my last command
And be my guide to paradise

My grave is open
I've said my good-byes
My path has been chosen
My faith can't be denied
A better life awaits me if I make my sacrifice
My sins will be forgiven when I reach my paradise
My ticket to the heavenly
My salvation from Hell
My gateway to eternity
My escape from this insanity
Chorus 2x
