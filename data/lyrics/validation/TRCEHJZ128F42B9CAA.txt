Phone me and I'll hang up
Sick and tired of being bubble gum chewed up
Dark lane, bleak house shrinking rose, You're over and out
Tie a cherry bootstring, put your candy teeth in
Choking on a sweetheart, hang up, hang up, hang up

Go on girls - solo
Go on girls - take a chance
Go on girls - trust it
Go on girls - the truth is ...

Cut your hair wear a chip on your shoulder
Get ahead, get laid, get it over
Cheap show, back seat martyr's pose, you're over and out
I'm checking out of my senses, buying best defences
Putting on the trousers, hang up, hang up, hang up

Go on girls - solo
Go on girls - take a chance
Go on girls - trust it
Go on girls - the truth is ...
So so ... Single ... So low ... The truth is ...

You want the day to fit to a soundtrack
Get a story get a life and get back
You've got nothing to shout about
You're over and out

I'm checking out of my senses, Buying best defences
Fired up on free-will, hang up, hang up, hang up

Go on girls - solo
Go on girls - take a chance
Go on girls - trust it
Go on girls - the truth is ...
So so ... Single ... So low ... The truth is ...
So so ... Single ... So low ... The truth is
