[Verse 1]
Shepherd is chased by the wolves
Wolves who live by intolerance and hate
For what they couldn't understand
Blinded and vicious are the beasts
Beating and ripping at a pitiful human
Until it's nothing more than meat itself

[Chorus]
Tied to the fence as they break you
And sadness will sear
Cold is the wind that will freeze you
And sadness will sear

[Verse 2]
Scarecrow is left crucified, left freezing, bleeding
Tied, and wondering why, the wolves just couldn't understand
It's the preachers, and the teachers
Governments, closed-minded creatures, try to teach us
To hate that which is different

[Chorus]
Tied to the fence as they break you
And sadness will sear
Cold is the wind that will freeze you
And sadness will sear

[Interlude]
It's 12:53 AM
October 12th when the scarecrow died
A victim of society's cruelty
It's 12:53 AM
October 12th when the shepherd died
The candles' light will alight your departure

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Tied to the fence as they break you
And sadness will sear
Cold is the wind that will freeze you
And sadness will sear

Tied to the fence as they break you
And sadness will sear
Cold is the wind that will freeze you
And sadness will sear
