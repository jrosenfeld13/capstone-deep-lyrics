This is the end of a beautiful friendship
It ended a moment ago
This is the end of a beautiful friendship
I know
For your eyes told me so

We were always
Like sister and brother
Until tonight
When we looked at each other

That was the end of a beautiful friendship
And just the beginning of lov&101

(Instrumental interlude)

We were always
Like sister and brother
Until tonight
When we looked at each other

That was the end of a beautiful friendship
And just the beginning of love

That was the end of a beautiful friendship
And just the beginning of love

That was the end of a beautiful friendship
And just the beginning of love!
