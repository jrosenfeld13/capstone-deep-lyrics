I won the fight
It seemed like eternity
But finally it stopped
I am standing in ruins
After all
I don't give in
There is no time
To see the victory

I lose but win
Here in my realm
Like heroes in films
I live your dream

Future was mine
You built it up
But you didn't care
So I pay the results
But after all
Grief is on my side
I've had to live
Your future plans
