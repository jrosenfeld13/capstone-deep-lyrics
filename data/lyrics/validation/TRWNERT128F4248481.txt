Tonight you are going to suffer and I will be the last glimpse of anything you see
Is pain real?
Do you believe in pain?
I want to walk away but I sit and watch you slowly fall in and out of consciousness
The pain
The panic
Grab your chest, feel your heart wanting to break through
The throbbing grows and turns into a steady pound
This is real; fear is real
Do you believe in fear?
The leisure of my scolding action happens to leave
A staggered expression on your bloated face
The impact leaves a scar
Can you smell the concern; this rancid scent of horror
I am always amazed how little I know you
