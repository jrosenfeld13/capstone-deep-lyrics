The face of doubt
Stuck in a drought
Thirty miles shy of the pouring rain
I got the peddle stuck to the floor
Constant right turns driving me insane

I'm running in circles, with hopes held up so high
My skeleton's got faster legs than me
So he always looks behind
To see where I hide
Can you see where I hide?

The rain keeps on pouring but it never likes to hit my face
I'm all alone and I'm fading
My mind is trying so heard to relocate

I'm running in circles, with hopes held up so high
My skeleton's got faster legs than me
So he always looks behind
To see where I hide
Can you see where I hide?

Don't stop, ever

I can't keep up with my habits
I can't keep up with my time
I can't keep up with my reasons
I need more rain to help me clear my mind

I'm running in circles, with hopes held up so high
My skeleton's got faster legs than me
So he always looks behind
To see where I hide
Can you see where I hide?
