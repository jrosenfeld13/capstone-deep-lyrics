Stare at a reflection
Hold it - keep it safe and calm
Just don't lose Titan Grip

Mean what you asked me for

There is one thing I can do
Alter light and mirrors view
Just don't lose Titan Grip

Now halt with open arms
And I'm waiting for you
And it seems like something has gone astray
Reflection is off the wall

Take these weapons to the great battle of self
And still you seem to stare

And repeat what you asked me for

Memory of name
This face escapes once again

I can't take this

Now halt with open arms
And i'm waiting for you

And it seems like something has gone astray
Reflection is off the wall

I see you and you are coming back
I'll be waiting
