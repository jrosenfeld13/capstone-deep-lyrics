It's alright now
We're alright now
Yeah we're fighters
You and me
Soul survivor
Start a fight like lovers can
Don't surrender to the man

We're alright now
We're alright now
They can't take us
They'll never break us
She my baby she stands tall

She my baby above it all
Not a pussycat at all
She's a leopard but she don't crawl

They can't take us
They'll never break us
They can't take us
They'll never break us
They can't take us
They'll never break us
Apart
Surround us
