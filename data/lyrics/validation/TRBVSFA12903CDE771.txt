Verse 1
Never ever deep in love never ever had a home
Others holding hands all day while I was on my own

Would you take my hand would you run away with me
To a destination where we can be so free

Never ever felt this way where have you been before
I was searching all my life now you knock on my door

Would you take my hand would you ran away with me to a destination where we can be so free

Refrain:
And I can be your girl, be your girl tonight
And I can see the world I see it in your eyes

We can be, you can be, they can be too
As long as there's eternity as long as there is you

Verse 2
My emotions getting strong your heartbeat close to mine
If I can be your girl tonight across your soul I sign

Would you say my name when I'm sleeping next to you
And would you say it loud when I'm laying over you

No one does it better no one loves the way you do
As long as there's eternity believe me there is you

Would you say my name when I'm sleeping next to you
And would you scream it loud when I'm laying over you

Refrain:
And I can be your girl, be your girl tonight
And I can see the world I see it in your eyes

We can be, you can be, they can be too
As long as there's eternity as long as there is you

Brigde:
I wanna be your girl tonight with you right here right by my side, one thousand miles I'd run for you into infinity

Refrain:
And I can be your girl, be your girl tonight
And I can see the world I see it in your eyes

We can be, you can be, they can be too
As long as there's eternity as long as there is you

Refrain:
And I can be your girl, be your girl tonight
And I can see the world I see it in your eyes

We can be, you can be, they can be too
As long as there's eternity as long as there is you

Refrain:
And I can be your girl, be your girl tonight
And I can see the world I see it in your eyes

We can be, you can be, they can be too
As long as there's eternity as long as there is you
