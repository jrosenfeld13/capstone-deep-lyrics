You want love but you fear it
Your attention's been shifted
You summed up the feeling
With a simple dismissing

What you gonna do? Deceiving
It ain't you, believe it
'Cause our love ain't easy
It changes with seasons

Whoa, yeah
Where we going I don't know
So baby won't you let it go?
(Baby won't you let it go?)

You sewed shut the curtains
You closed out the light coming in
And all your friends you don't want near
You don't want advice, advice to hear

'Cause inside you're working
You're mending what's broken
'Cause our love ain't easy
It changes with seasons

Ohhhh yeah, where we going I don't know
So baby won't you let it go?
Ohhhh yeah, where we going I don't know
Ohhhh so baby won't you let it go?

Don't you worry
Won't you let it go
Baby don't worry
Just let it go, let it go

Don't you worry
Won't you let it go
Baby don't worry
Just let it go let it go

Don't you worry
Won't you let it go
Baby don't worry
Just let it go, let it go

Don't you worry
Won't you let it go
Baby don't worry
Just let it go, let it go

Don't you worry
Won't you let it go
Baby don't worry
Where we going I don't know

Don't you worry
Won't you let it go
Baby don't worry
So baby won't you let it go?

Don't you worry
Won't you let it go
Baby don't worry
Where we going I don't know

Don't you worry
Won't you let it go
Baby don't worry
So baby won't you let it go?
