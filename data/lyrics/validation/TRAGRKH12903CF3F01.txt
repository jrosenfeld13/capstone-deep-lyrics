I'm in new york city i'm gonna lower my line
New york city is a high timin'
New york city! woo! ain't that a city
New york city, baby, you've gotta know my line!

There's one thing folks i'd ask you to do
Catch a busride ride up fifth avenue
New york city! woo! ain't that a city
New york city, baby, you've gotta know my line!

When you ride that bus keep it on your mind
Ride that bus that sure gonna cost you a diamond
New york city! woo! ain't that a city
New york city, baby, you've gotta know my line!

When your gammy be callin', "it looks like rain"
Sit down inside, catch you a subway train
New york city! woo! ain't that a city
New york city, baby, you've gotta know my line!

If i ever go down to georgia i'm gonna walk and talk
And tell everybody about the city of new york
New york city! woo! ain't that a city
New york city, baby, you've gotta know my line!

If i go down to lousiana i'll walk in tell
Get on atop of the townbell and call a yellin'
New york city! woo! ain't that a city
New york city, baby, you've gotta know my line!

Train's runnin' in the ground and it won't keep still
When i catch me a train to ride to sugar hill
New york city! woo! ain't that a city
New york city, baby, you've gotta know my line!

New york city, baby, you've gotta know my line!
