[Verse 1]
Now I done felt a lot of pain
I done seen a lot of things
From struggling and broken hearts to fancy cars, ooh yeah
And even though my money change
I try my best to stay the same
But you know with more money, more problems came
But if I...

[Chorus]
If I had to do it all again (if I had to)
I wouldn't take away the rain
'Cause I know it made me who I am
If I had to do it all again
I've learned so much from my mistakes
That's how I know He's watching me
(He's watching me)

[Verse 2]
In ATL I caught a case
And the media tried to say
I had a habit
I couldn't manage
And I'm throwing my life away (ooh yeah)
But everything ain't what it seems
Just because it's on TV
'Cause they speculate and exaggerate for a better story

[Chorus]
If I had to do it all again (had to do it)
I wouldn't take away the rain (no)
'Cause I know it made me who I am
If I had to do it all again (yeah)
I've learned so much from my mistakes
That's how I know He's watching me

[Bridge]
Nobody knows what life may bring
It might make you happy, it might make you sad
Sometimes yeah
But I know there's a reason for everything (but I know)
That's why I keep believing
Whatever's meant to be is gonna be

[Chorus]
If I had to do it all again (oh, if I...)
I wouldn't take away the rain
'Cause I know it make me who I am
If I had to do it all again
I've learned so much from my mistakes
That's how I know He's watching me (oh, if I...)
If I had to do it all again
I wouldn't take away the rain
'Cause I know it make me who I am
If I had to do it all again
I've learned so much from my mistakes
That's how I know He's watching me (oh yeah yeah)
