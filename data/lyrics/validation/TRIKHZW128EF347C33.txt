[Verse 1]
Blue moon, blue moon, blue moon
Keep shining bright
Blue moon, keep on shining bright
You're gonna bring me back my baby tonight
Blue moon, keep shining bright

[Verse 2]
I said blue moon of Kentucky
Keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
I said blue moon of Kentucky
Keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue

[Chorus]
Well, it was on one moonlight night
Stars shining bright
Wish blown high
Love said good-bye

[Bridge]
Blue moon of Kentucky
Keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue

[Verse 3]
Well, I said blue moon of Kentucky
Just keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
I said blue moon of Kentucky
Keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Blue moon of Kentucky
Keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
