Move On This Lyrics

I fell in love (I fell in love) with this beautiful girl
And well you know (well you know) she fell in love with me
And so the two of we (way yo yo yo), we took it one step further
(Way yo yo yo) put some action into history (2x)
All of this is beautiful
But there is one thing (one thing (echoes))
That comes back around to haunt me (haunt me)
I used to have a family
But I am the kid who will overcome
I will, I will, I will die to fear
Live for love, die to fear

Chorus: And so we move, move on this love (3x)
And let this love
And let this love move in us
I fell in love (I fell in love) with this beautiful girl
And well you know (well you know) she fell in love with me
And so the two of we (way yo yo yo), we took it one step further
(Way yo yo yo) put some action into history (2x)
You and I will overcome
Having been changed (been changed)
Been changed by our Father (Father)
Oh, forevermore
Cause we are the kids to counteract
We will, we will, we will die to fear
Live for love, die to fear
CHORUS
You can't, you can't, you can't stop this
Move on this (3x)
CHORUS
I fell in love (I fell in love) with this beautiful girl
And well you know (well you know) she fell in love with me
And so the two of we (way yo yo yo), we took it one step further
(Way yo yo yo) put some action into history (2x)
Way yo yo yo, way yo yo you, history (2x)
