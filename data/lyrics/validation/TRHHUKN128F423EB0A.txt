Stone cold in this warm bed again
Wide awake and waiting for them
I send my shadow running on ahead again
I wait and wait and.......
I'm waving in my beautiful friends over there on the end of the
The bright light the bright light begins it
The grass is high and the sky is low tonight
I wanna be here i wanna be gone
And this time i won't cry i won't
I'm waving in my beautiful friends over there on the end of the
The bright light the bright light begins it and i get sucked into it again
Wild and high on the summer wind
I'm in for a love so tough i could break my teeth if i bit down hard upon it
And a voice so rich just the sound of it is forever nauseating
And i get sucked into it again
Wild and high on the summer wind
