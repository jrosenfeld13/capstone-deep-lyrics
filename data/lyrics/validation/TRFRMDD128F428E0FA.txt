As tomorrow's man and a topless bee
Jump over your head, remember me
Don't get confused by a dying sky and sea

The panda club has an odds on bet
Mr. Music Man needs a string quartet
On the planet where the alphabet starts with Z

Energy and confidence
Buzz high in your consciouness
Don't get confused by an early morning rain

'Cause the panda club has an odds-on bet
Mr. Music Man needs a string quartet
On the planet where the alphabet starts with Z

Man and moon plays a melody
That you can't forget, so remember me
Twist with tomorrow's man and me

Man and moon plays a melody
That you can't forget, so remember me
Twist with tomorrow's man and me

Twist with tomorrow's man and me
Twist with tomorrow's man and me
Twist with tomorrow's man and me
