Hold on
Hold my hand
Storm clouds are circling
Hungry for barren land
It's eerie
Yeah, it's much too still
Can you feel my body spin?
Feel it, yeah, I know you will
Trauma makes me comfortable
Chaos calms me down
Everything is clear when you're inside the tornado
Everything is quiet in the eye of the storm
I will give you wings if you hang on to my halo
Nothing is stable
Inside the tornado
This wind
Is blowing madness
But there's a method to this
This is the cure for sadness
Force is centrifugal
It keeps you in
It's dark and rain is falling
Longing to touch your skin
Close your eyes and feel the power
This is so sublime

CHORUS
