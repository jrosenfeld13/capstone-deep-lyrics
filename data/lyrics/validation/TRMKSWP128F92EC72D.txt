You're acting strange
Like you have done something wrong
You're on a stage rehearsing line you've drawn

I'm not a fool
Not a fool
Gonna prove it
Gonna put you down
Gonna put you down

Last night it rained
I followed on my bike
I learned some things
I knew my heart wouldn't like
Your honesty is fading day by day

I'm not a fool
Not a fool
Gonna prove it
Gonna put you down
Gonna put you down

I packed your things
Then I threw them down the stairs
Chainsmoking
These dead soldiers can't repair the damage done
I see it day by day
