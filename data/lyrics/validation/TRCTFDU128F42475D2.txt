[Verse 1]
Why boasteth thyself
Oh, evil men
Playing smart
And not being clever?
I said, you are working iniquity
To achieve vanity
But the goodness of Jah, Jah
I-dureth forever

[Chorus]
If you are the big tree
We are the small axe
Sharpened to cut you down
Ready to cut you down

[Verse 2]
These are the words
Of my master, keep on telling me
No weak heart shall prosper
And whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall fall in it, shall fall in it
Whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall lay in it, shall lay in it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
These are the words
Of my master, telling me that
No weak heart shall prosper
And whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall fall in it, bury in it
And whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall bury in it, bury in it

[Chorus] [x2]
