Tea for two stars falling from the memphis sky
Tea for two stars falling from the memphis sky

I know the night bird called you now
Everything is fine
I know it's soon to be fading out
But oh, didn't we shine
Didn't we shine

Some people say that the memphis blues ain't bad
Some people say that the memphis blues ain't bad

Put your little hand in mine darling
I know you're fading fast
It weren't the memphis blues you had
But baby you still shine

Goodbye my love, goodbye my love, goodbye
Turn your lamp down low my love, goodbye
I hear the whistle singing now to the lonesome pine
I know that we faded out
But oh, didn't we shine
Didn't we shine
