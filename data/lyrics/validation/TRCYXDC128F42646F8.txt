Live for yourself
Today or tomorrow
Look after your health
Forget all your sorrows
Whoa

I wish I coulda' seen you
When you could run wild
I woulda' liked to know you
As an innocent child
Innocent child

It's never too late
For you to do
You don't have to wait
For the sun to come through

(Chorus)

I know a way
Of sipping the truth
Go back to the days
Before your youth

(Chorus)

Child, innocent child
Innocent child
