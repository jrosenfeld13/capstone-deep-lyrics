Under you, under me
You and I are the same
This skin and bones hides our souls
We're suspended in between

It's over you, it's over me
We couldn't reach it if we tried
Yet you try every time

Why did you say, that?
Why don't you stay, and
Let me remind you
Let me remind you

Cuz I didn't see this coming
No I did not
I thought that I knew you
I guess I was wrong
You seemed so strange
Or did I lose you today
Tell me there's time
To erase and rewind

I won't look back to our past
Cause if I do then it might rain
It's funny how all we have now
Are some memories like loose change

Why did you say, that?
Why don't you stay, and
Let me remind you
Let me remind you

That I didn't see this coming
No I did not
I thought that I knew you
I guess I was wrong
You seemed so strange
Or did I lose you today
Tell me there's time
To erase and rewind

If you meant what you said well then fine
And if you meant what you said well then goodbye

I want to remind you
That I still love you

I didn't see this coming
No I did not
I thought that I knew you
I guess I was wrong
You seemed so strange
Or did I lose you today
Please tell me there's time
Tell me there's time
To erase and rewind
