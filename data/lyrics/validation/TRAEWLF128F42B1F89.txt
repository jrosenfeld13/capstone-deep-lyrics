I believe
That deep inside you want to see
I can feel
The poisons that you breathe are real

You can change reality that you sustain
You concede
To anything that you believe

Please dont leave me words to cope with
Painted lies on walls of hope and
Wasted days for us to grieve
There is more to this
Than you believe

I can see
The end of this inevitably
Stay right here
Inverted and away from fear

You maintain the emptiness that I contain
You are free
Please be what you can choose to be

Throw away your words of greed
Hold onto the things you need
Perfect days and sympathy
Or dreams inside your "happy sea"
