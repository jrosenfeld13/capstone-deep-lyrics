Now this song is going out to all of you players
Wanna be players
Wanna be pimps
Mack daddys
Or whatever you call yourself
Well you better get your game face on
Cause this old lady told me one time
She say son, you men think you know what women want
But you don't
And then she went on to tell me a story
And it goes something like this
All you wanna be lovers
There's something you need to know
Now this old lady told me a story a long time ago
She said Theodis, men think they know what women want
But the truth about the whole thing is boy they really don't
She said, I had a man
Who thought he was the worlds greatest lover
But when you add his time up
He was just a five minute brother
He used to lick it
Mmmm
He used to stroke it
You know one night we was makin love he said
This thing is so damn good I wanna put it in my pipe and smoke it
She said Theodis you need to know
That you can lick it
And you can stroke it
And you can kiss it
And you can eat it
But you ain't done a dog gone thin until you stand up in it
Now this wanna be brother who thought he was the worlds greatest lover
Stopped by my house the other day and caught me with my part time lover
He said babymmm baby
Why you messin around on me?
I make sure your rents paid
I make sure your cable's on
Now just the other day I bought you a cell phone
Baby ooo baby why you do me this way?
She said Theodis, men think they know what women want
But the truth about the whole thing is boy they really don't

Now you can lick it, and you can stroke it
But you ain't did a dog gone thing until you stand up in it
Now you can eat it, and you can lick it
But you ain't did a dog gone thing until you stand up in it
And the moral of this story boys is
You can eat it, stroke it, lick it
Do anything you want with it
But you ain't did nothing til you stand up in it
