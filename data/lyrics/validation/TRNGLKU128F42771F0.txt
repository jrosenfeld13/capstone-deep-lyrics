Much confusion in the wake of suffering
Awaiting comfort that only silence can bring
Smoky ruins fill the greying skies
Tears of sorrow as our nation dies

Thoughts of sadness fill my haunted dreams
Shrieks of madness, life is ending it seems
Seeking inspiration from the voice that calls my name
Finding wisdom in the depths beyond our shame

Behind the eyes of misery a hope still lingers on
But yet I fear my final prayer goes down with the dying sun
The dying sun

There's not a tear of sympathy can take back what's been done
As dreams of all eternity go down with the dying sun
The dying sun

Your voice tells me I'm not dreaming
My mind is gone, inside I'm screaming
All I had has died in shadows
Now I lie where no one knows

Oh yeah, come on
