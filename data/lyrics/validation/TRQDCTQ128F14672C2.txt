I see it around me, I see it in everything
I could be so much more than this
I said my goodbye's this is my sundown
I'm going to be so much more than this
With one hand high, you'll show them your progress
You'll take your time, but no one cares
No one cares

I need you to show me the way from crazy
I want to be so much more than this
With one hand high, you'll show them your progress
You'll take your time, but no one cares
With one hand high, you'll show them your progress
You'll take your time, but no one cares
No one cares

I could be so much more than this
No one cares
I want to be so much more than this
No one cares
I could be so much more than this
No one cares
I want to be so much more than this
No one cares
I want to be so much more than this
No one cares
I want to be so much more than this

Good Goodbye, lovely time
Good Goodbye, tinsel shine
Good Goodbye, I'll be fine
Good Goodbye, good goodnight
