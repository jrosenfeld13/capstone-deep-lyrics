Haven't you noticed
There is someone outside
Looking through our window
When we sleep at night
You must not leave me alone anymore
Awake all night, worrying for
You to be with somebody else
It's time to be with somebody else
Didn't I tell you
About the dream I had last night
We were both in it
And everything seemed so right
When I opened up my eyes
He was standing behind our
Don't remember the look on his face
But I remember, I remember what he said
To be with somebody else
It's time to be with somebody else
??
It's time for you to be with somebody like me
Somebdy touched me
And whispered in my ear
Come a little bit closer
There's nothing for you to fear here
So I left your sight
Followed my own voice now
The window was open
But he was gone
And I went back to you
To be with somebody else
It's time to be with somebody else
??
It's time for you to be with somebody outside
