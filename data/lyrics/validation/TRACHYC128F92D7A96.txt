I wish i could tell you how much it means

Without letting go to too delicate dreams

I have swallowed a black poison cherry

It still hasn't really registered

I lost my balance when you sat on my knees

Spooked in a spell by the North Sea

(In a disaster, grab a kiss)

No one ever really (holds that close)

Just carry on being what you are

Look up over morning at a new perfect star

Come to me - come to me

I'm on your side - (eternity)

Scan the sky invoke a storm

I count the seconds and they're far, far, far, too long
