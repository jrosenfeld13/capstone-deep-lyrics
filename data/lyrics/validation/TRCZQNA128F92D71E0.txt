There are so many cold steps between us
But still I can almost hear you breathe
When I look at us in our space hero suits
There are so many cold steps between us
But still I can almost hear you breathe
When I look at us in our space hero suits
I can't help but think of us flying

Lift me up a couple of inches, I can lift you
Then we can both fly above the ground
Until one of us lets go
Please don't, please don't
Please don't let go

I wonder if the sun cast us
We may when we were young
Still this may be our way
Let's take in then with it

But if they do exist
I think that we have found
We have found our place

If you lift me up a couple of inches
I can lift you
Then we can both fly above the ground
Until one of us lets go
Please don't, please don't
Please don't let go

I don't know if that will do
I think you have to try some more
Keep on lifting so the floor can't hit us

If you lift me up a couple of inches
I can lift you
Then we can both fly above the ground
Until one of us lets go
Please don't, please don't
Please don't let go

If you lift me up a couple of inches
I can lift you
Then we can both fly above the ground
Until one of us lets go
Please don't
Please don't let go

If you lift me up a couple of inches
I can lift you
Then we can both fly above the ground
Until one of us lets go
Please don't, please don't
Please don't let go

If you lift me up a couple of inches
I can lift you
Then we can both fly above the ground
Until one of us lets go
Please don't, please don't
Please don't let go

If you lift me up a couple of inches
I can lift you
Then we can both fly above the ground
Until one of us lets go
Please don't, please don't
Please don't let go

If you lift me up a couple of inches
I can lift you
Then we can both fly above the ground
Until one of us lets go
Please don't
Please don't let go
