[Chorus: Brakeman]
And it's bang boy
Eight hurricane bang boy
All day long, bang, boy
Bang out the booth, bang, boy
Don't get me mad, boy
Stop acting like you're a badboy
Do you really want it with bang?
You will get eight hurricane bang, boy

[Verse 1: Footsie]

Look, I wear my own garms
Nah, I don't care what dem man wear
Dem man are anything when man's here
When I'm here, yeah, it's everything
Don't hold back, give everything
Put it all on the line, risk everything
Yeah, I'll bang, boy
Up in a tree, you'll hang, boy

But you better back your twang, boy
Look, nah, I ain't dang, boy
Confining with a big bang, boy

[Verse 2: D Double E]
Are you mad, blud?
He tried to spud man and I left man hanging
I wanna kiss my fists and bang him
Swear he was running up when I rang him
Talking all this stuff when I rang him
Now man are moving prang and bam
Cause you noticed my team and you wanna go HAM
Man can't chat with the Darren and Dan
Don't wanna start with the [?] man
Six foot under, I'll take man
Man wanna snitch and snake on a man
No long ting, I won't hesitate, man
Pause ain't likely, I'm a bait man
Pull up the ting and aim at man
Bare gunshots and everyone ran
Game over, now I'm gonna play with man

[Chorus: Brakeman]
And it's bang boy
Eight hurricane bang boy
All day long, bang, boy
Bang out the booth, bang, boy
Don't get me mad, boy
Stop acting like you're a badboy
Do you really want it with bang?
You will get eight hurricane bang, boy

[Chorus: Brakeman]
And it's bang boy
Eight hurricane bang boy
All day long, bang, boy
Bang out the booth, bang, boy
Don't get me mad, boy
Stop acting like you're a badboy
Do you really want it with bang?
You will get eight hurricane bang, boy

[Verse 3: Chronik]
Cause man wanna act like they didn't try it
I've got to sneak in the room all quiet
Old school like Brixton mass
A bag of man like Brixton riots
Walk in the room with the mask
You better know say it's Michael Myers
Run up on a car with the kitchen
Better know say, ain't stabbing up tyres
I've got the online flow
Blud, where's all the online fires?
Dem man can't deal with the truth
Us man can't deal with liars
Hostile, any hostility
[?] chain man up
Removal, rough means physically
Pull out man's teeth with pliers

[Chorus: Brakeman]
And it's bang boy
Eight hurricane bang boy
All day long, bang, boy
Bang out the booth, bang, boy
Don't get me mad, boy
Stop acting like you're a badboy
Do you really want it with bang?
You will get eight hurricane bang, boy

[Chorus: Brakeman]
And it's bang boy
Eight hurricane bang boy
All day long, bang, boy
Bang out the booth, bang, boy
Don't get me mad, boy
Stop acting like you're a badboy
Do you really want it with bang?
You will get eight hurricane bang, boy

[Verse 4: Brakeman]
Look, fam, forget all the rest
Cause I'll go head-to-head with the best of the best
Shower down ting, nuttin' more, nuttin' less
Soundboy burial, so I kill a soundboy dead
Send a soundboy home to his bed
But don't let this go over your head
A sixteen shells could open your head
But in sixteen bars, I'll shell the lev
Go over the edge, have you holding your head
Zoning like man's holding the meds
Trap ting, yeah, black bag full of Zs, I'm holding the levs
Grime ting so you know I'm keeping it effed
I beat the beat until there's no beat left
I've got them gassed like "oh, he's effed, oh, he's effed"
Back that quick, then it's onto the next

[Chorus: Brakeman]
And it's bang boy
Eight hurricane bang boy
All day long, bang, boy
Bang out the booth, bang, boy
Don't get me mad, boy
Stop acting like you're a badboy
Do you really want it with bang?
You will get eight hurricane bang, boy

[Chorus: Brakeman]
And it's bang boy
Eight hurricane bang boy
All day long, bang, boy
Bang out the booth, bang, boy
Don't get me mad, boy
Stop acting like you're a badboy
Do you really want it with bang?
You will get eight hurricane bang, boy
