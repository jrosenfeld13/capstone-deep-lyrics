Hold your head up, little girl. don't be scared off by the world and all its bitterness. because everyone's just like you and everyone needs friends. hold your head up, all you boys. don't be scared off by the noise that this whole world can bring. because everyone's just like you and everyone can sing
Do do do do do do do. do do do do do do do do do. do do do do do do do. do do do do do do do do do do
