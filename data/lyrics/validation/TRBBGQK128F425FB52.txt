Hit and run
Who is the love killer
Who ruined the music we thought was so special
Like fire between us spent over and over
Who emptied my bed and left me with nothing

Hit and Run
It came so sudden
From the mouth of the kiss that whispered "forever"
From the body of the soul that made my eyes listen
I'm hearing goodbye
But I don't want to listen

Love will tear and do you on
Turn you inside out and when
All you got is less than dim
You know you're grabbin' at straws
And you'd do it again

Hit and run
Who is the love killer
Who ruined the music we thought was so special
Like fire between us spent over and over
Who emptied my bed and left me with nothing
