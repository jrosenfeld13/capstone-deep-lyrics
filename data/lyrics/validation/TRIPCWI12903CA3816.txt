Springtime is coming again
Flowers lift their heads to the sun
And I wanna bloom with them
But I'm sitting here all alone
Come pick me and take me home
And I will bloom with them

For there's a time when independence
Starts to look like loneliness
Yeah there's a time when independence
Feels a lot like loneliness
Loneliness

Angel can't you see
The world's waiting patiently
For us to bloom with them
Couldn't we bloom with them
Ah we could bloom with them
With them

I can dance without you
But I'd rather dance with you
I can dance without you
But I'd rather dance with you

I can dance without you
But I'd rather dance with you
I can dance without you
But I'd rather dance with you
With, with you
