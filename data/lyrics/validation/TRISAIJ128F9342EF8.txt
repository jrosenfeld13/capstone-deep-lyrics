Get fresh at the weekend
Showin' out
Showin' out
Get fresh at the weekend
Showin' out
Showin' out

You`d better live in love than luxury
It`s alright
And don`t be dining out
On foolish dreams every night

O-o-only takes a moment
To feel alright
Get fresh at the weekend
Showin' out

Get fresh at the weekend
Showin' out
Showin' out
Showin' out

Can`t afford
To wear diamond and pearl
That`s okay
Wouldn`t want to be that kind of girl anyway

O-o-only takes a moment
To feel alright
Get fresh at the weekend
Showin' out

Get fresh at the weekend
Showin' out
Showin' out
Showin' out

I can supply you things
I can provide everything
If it`s the man`s hand that pays the price
Then you belong to me

Only, only, only, o
(Show, show, show, show)
Only, only, only, o
(Show, show, show, show)

Only, only, only, o
(Show, show, show, show)
Only only only o
(Show, show, show, show)

Can`t afford to buy finer things
That`s alright
We won`t just lose our heads for anything
Anytime

O-o-only takes a moment
To feel alright
Get fresh at the weekend
Showin' out
Showin' out

Get fresh at the weekend
Showin' out
Get fresh at the weekend
Showin' out

Showin' out
Showin' out
Get fresh at the weekend
Showin' out

[Repeat until end:]
Showin' out
I`m showin' out
Showin' out
I`m showin' out
