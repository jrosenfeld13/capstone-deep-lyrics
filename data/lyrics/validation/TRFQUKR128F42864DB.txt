[Hook x2]
Shocking out, shocking out
I am a soldier, no follow no scout
Shocking out, shocking out
I-man a soldier, no follow no scout

[Verse 1]
I am a youth who will drink all big soup
Don't follow no crowd, don't depend on no group
So no dress and no vest must try test my skill
'Cause I can and I will, ya hear me star, jus' chill

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
I come and I see and I must confess
At my age and my stage, don't want no distress
So bad boy, be good boy, and go take a rest
This current is flowing and we don't draw less

[Hook]
'Cause I'mma shocking out, shocking out
I am a soldier, no follow no scout
Shocking out, shocking out
I-man a soldier, no follow no scout
Shocking out, shocking out
I am a soldier, no follow no scout
Shocking out, shocking out
I am a soldier, no follow no scout

[Outro]
Shocking out, shocking out
I am a soldier, no follow no scout
Shocking out, shocking out
I am a soldier..
