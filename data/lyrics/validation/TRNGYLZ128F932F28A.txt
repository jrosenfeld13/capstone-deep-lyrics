[Verse 1]
If I had eyes in the back of my head
I would have told you that
You looked good
As I walked away

If you could have tried to trust the hand that fed
You would've never been hungry
But you never really be

The more of this or less of this or is there any difference
Or are we just holding onto the things we don't have anymore

[Chorus]
Sometimes time doesn't heal
No, not at all
Just stand still
While we fall
In or out of love again I doubt I'm going to win you back
When you got eyes like that
It won't let me in
Always looking out

[Verse 2]
Lot of people spend their time just floating
We were victims together but lonely
You got hungry eyes that just can't look forward
Can't give them enough but we just can't start over

Building with bent nails we're
Falling but holding, I don't want to take up anymore of your time
Time, time, time

[Chorus]
