Told y'all... down with Dilated....
Motherfuckers!

Phil Da Agony break your crew
Any problems?

Yeah, yeah

Bones full of agony
Skin full of melanin
Go ahead, tell a friend
We back at it again
Randomly I aim to cap
A wack rappin head off
Decapitate a rappin head off
You're better off...

Sucked off twice in the same night
You know my style right?
You know my large appetite
Brand new, keep it spank
Keep a bag of dank
Keep it top rank
Keep all my money in the bank

Money market Mutual funds
Investments for my son
Expanding the team and gettin it done

World Champions, shit - Los Angeles Lyrics
Bitch don't act shocked when you hear it
