Hold my hand and lead me there
To this place I'm unaware
Endless days have left me drifting
I have lost my thoughts
I follow you in, it's warm and cold
I've never been, I'd die to know
Will I be left vacant?

Slipping in this empty space
It's difficult believing
Sweet allure
Beauty face
When I'm left with no more feeling

I've got it sweet, I've got it grim
Never imagined this space I'm in
For endless days I am no wiser than I was before
You'll never know what's inside of me
Neither will I if I try to be
Don't want to be left vacant

Slipping in this empty space
It's difficult believing
Sweet allure
Beauty face
When I'm left with no more feeling
Falling down this empty space
I've left my heart behind me
Sweet allure
Beauty face
I'm left with no more
