You are the One, You are the Chosen
Thunder and lightning strikes in your eyes
Stand and guard until the End of Time
So it's written, So it shall be done
In front of the Golden Gates, an Angel is standing high
Wings wide and strong, a Sword of Fire in his hand
Guardian of the Gate, Bringer of the Fire
Never ending Power, Eternal Name : Uriel

So there He stands, Mightiest among the Mighty
Guarding a Holy Place where evil's never to rise
Archangel of Salvation, Vision of Majesty
Fly higher, bring the Fire, The Flame of God

[Chorus]
Holy Fire, guard the Gates of Eden
Holy Fire, guard the Gates of Eden
Holy Fire, guard the Gates of Eden
Holy Fire, guard the Gates for Eternity

[guitar solos]

So the words were spoken, His Voice was so loud
As the stars were looking down from the sky
So don't be afraid when you see the sun burning
Just remember the Fire of Uriel

[Chorus]
Holy Fire, guard the Gates of Eden
Holy Fire, guard the Gates of Eden
Holy Fire, guard the Gates of Eden
Holy Fire, guard the Gates for Eternity
