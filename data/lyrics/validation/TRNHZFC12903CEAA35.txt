I wanna rock the house
Watch the roof go bump
Watch the swingers swing on the floor
And all the brick houses
Gonna shake the rump
And all the swingers gonna swing it some more
And all you players
Gonna round 'em up
And all you lovers get ready to score
The beat gets harder
When the love erupts
And all the flames shooting out the back door

Out the back door
Out the back door
Powder boost and gloss it
Brush your shoulders floss it
And we're out the back door
Out the back door
Left hand on the Bible
'Cuz Daddy's got a rifle
And we're out the back door
Out the back door

And it's one on one
From Moon to Sun
What we do from Sun until Moon
We waltzing on water
Dipping Lucy Liu
And all the flames flicker red and then blue
And we cut that time
In two in two
And baby I'm turning purple like you
When we move we move
With wings on our shoes
Sickest angels you ever knew

Out the back door
Out the back door
Rolling up the window
Smoking up some indo
And we're out the back door
Out the back door
Mellow in the cloudy
Knock it back get rowdy
And we're out the back door
Out the back door

Spin the vinyl
Cut the bopshebop
Get down and bump hiphop
It's a motto
When it comes to rock
Tick tock and you do not stop
Hey now
Tick tock and you do not stop

Spin the bottle
Where will it stop?
Get down on the tabletop
It's a motto
When it comes to rock
Tick tock and you do not stop
Hey now
Tick tock and you do not stop

Out the back door
Out the back door
Rolling up the window
Smoking up some indo
And we're out the back door
Out the back door
Left hand on the Bible
'Cuz Daddy's got a rifle
And we're out the back door
Out the back door

When we rock the house
Watch the roof go bump
Watch the swingers swing on the floor
And all the brick houses
Gonna shake the rump
And all the swingers gonna swing it some more
And all you players
Gonna round 'em up
And all you lovers get ready to score
The beat gets harder
When the love erupts
And all the flames shooting out the back door

Out the back door
Out the back door
Rolling up the window
Smoking up some indo
And we're out the back door
Out the back door
Mellow in the cloudy
Knock it back get rowdy
And we're out the back door
Out the back door
Powder boost and gloss it
Brush your shoulders floss it
And we're out the back door
Out the back door
Left hand on the Bible
'Cuz Daddy's got a rifle
And we're out the back door
Out the back door

Out the back door
Out the back door
Out the back door
