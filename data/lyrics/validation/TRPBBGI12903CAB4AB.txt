In the shadows let me come and sing to you
Let me dream a song that I can bring to you
Take me in your arms and let me cling to you
Let me linger long
Let me live my song

In the Winter let me bring the Spring to you
Let me feel that I mean everything to you
Love's old song will be new
In the shadows when I come and sing to you

Shadows on the wall
I can see them fall
Here and there, everywhere!
Silhouettes in blue
Dancing in the dew
Here I am, where are you?

Let me dream a song that I can bring to you
Take me in your arms and let me cling to you
Let me linger long
Let me live my song

In the Winter let me bring the Spring to you
Let me feel that I mean everything to you
Love's old song will be new
In the shadows when I come and sing to you, dear
In the shadows when I come and sing to you
