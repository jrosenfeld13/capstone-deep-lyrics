Now that I am sad
That wack rappers brought me back from the dead
That since I've been gone
Sayin' Koopsta lost his flows
Knowin' that I was doin' time
Depressed, stressed out up in my mind
This is what saved my life
Versatile I.....

Now that I am sad
That wack rappers brought me back from the dead
That since I've been gone
Sayin' Koopsta lost his flows
Knowin' that I was doin' time
Depressed, stressed out up in my mind
Mane this is for saving my life
This versatile I.....

[Verse 1]
I took a long, long journey from this world
Koop missing
Upon me floating
Though spirit left these windows open
Upon that timeless rap
When I return, theres nothing left
If you leave all by myself
Tripping over tits, piss and drugs
Trapped your soul
Collection to my thy wicked arts
Thats why I fill up til it starts to smells like dirty broads drawls
Back to myself who that interfere
See I ain't done, come let me put this bug in yo ear
Taste my coffee, put her face in there
Until come up for deep air
Take off the face of a bear
If you run, then I take them over there
Built to be my downfall
I love your Hind
When you can't compete
Then you want that versatile I....
I don't understand
Come on in, DJ please be my friend
DJ (I need a) DJ, I need a DJ
So I can replay
I likes to gets hiiigh
I likes to gets hiiigh
So-o-oar hiiigh
So nigga you can fly
I likes to gets hiiigh
I likes to gets hiiigh
So-o-oar hiiigh
So nigga you can fly

[Verse 2]
I'm bumpin' that's a fact ya'll
Koopsta Knic' can't wait, yo
Ask them rappers why I ain't featured on they tracks, ya'll
I know boys, they scared yeah
When I flow I cut off heads
While they mom was givin' head
They was pissin' in the bed
So I know they didn't get fed
So I gave them niggas bread
While eatin' steaks and eggs
Hoe where that welfare check
I told you in the past nigga
This be everlast nigga
Strike me, I'm gon' blast nigga
Right back on yo ass nigga
Know y'all forget shit
Me up on the them hits and shit
What y'all thought I vanished?
I was stuck in traffic!
Navigating cells and traps
Memphis crap took Memphis rap
Fuck what Jockeys talkin' 'bout
I help put this here on map
Someone told me "bless you"
Koopsta Knic' we miss you
Fuck of how they treated you
You help make them dreams come true
Now they wanna laugh at you
Keep labels from grabbin' you
Even kept a plaque or two
Bitch check out this interlude
I'm Everlast!
