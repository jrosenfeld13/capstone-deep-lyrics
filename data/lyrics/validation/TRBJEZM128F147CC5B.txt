It's gonna be another lonely night
One more and I'm gonna die
Wired out waiting for the sign
Cuz you're a risk and I'm borderline
It's gonna be another lonely night
One more and I'm gonna die
Wired out waiting for the sign
Cuz you're a risk and I'm borderline

Cuz you're a risk and I'm borderline

It's gonna be another lonely night
One more and I'm gonna die
Wired out waiting for the sign
Cuz you're a risk and I'm borderline
It's gonna be another lonely night
One more and I'm gonna die
Wired out waiting for the sign
Cuz you're a risk and I'm borderline

All I know...is I've been sitting with this fire and it burns inside
Man if you want me to walk your line then
Don't stop at eight no let's take it
To the nine's
I know that we should lay out and love
Because man I really need it [ to the nine's]
I may be full but it's not enough
Come and show me how to feel it

It's gonna be another lonely night
One more and I'm gonna die
Wired out waiting for the sign
Cuz you're a risk and I'm borderline
It's gonna be another lonely night
One more and I'm gonna die
Wired out waiting for the sign
Cuz you're a risk and I'm borderline

It's gonna be another lonely night
One more and I'm gonna die
Wired out waiting for the sign
Cuz you're a risk and I'm borderline
It's gonna be another lonely night
One more and I'm gonna die
Wired out waiting for the sign
Cuz you're a risk and I'm borderlne
