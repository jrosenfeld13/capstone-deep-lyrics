Sometimes what you say
Confuses what you mean
A mouth of strangled words
Come spinning out your mouth
Nothing's like the dream
Forget the words I say
Just let them hit the ground

As long as we can
Tear down these houses
Tear down these houses

You can run away
While I protect the way I am
There's comfort in the pain
Ripping through my heart
That kicks you when you're land

Stand down on your demons
'Cause no one wins this war
You've sharpened your weapons
For another useless cause
There'll be no survivors

As long as we can
Tear down these houses
Tear down these houses

What have you done to me
And what have I done to you
Facing each other to the death
No other soul to witness this

A mass of strangled words
Come spinning out your mouth
It's nothing like a dream (nothing like a dream)
It's nothing like a dream (nothing like a dream)

As long as we can
Tear down these houses
As long as we can
Tear down these houses

What have you done to me
And what have I done to you
