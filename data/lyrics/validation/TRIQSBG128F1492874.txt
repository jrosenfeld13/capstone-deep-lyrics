I don't want you to think that I'm ungrateful
'cause I'm not
I love you from your head down to your toes
But daddy told me that variety was the spice of life
And I'm a mushroom eater

Scuse me Miss Rose
I gotta be going
Whichever way the wind is blowing
And the river is flowing
I got one of [...] baby yeah
I appreciate the things you gave me
Yes i do
We had some fun, as far as good times go
It's just that I ain't used to staying in one spot too long
Yeah
The whole world's waiting

Scuse me Miss Rose
I gotta be going
Whichever way the wind is blowing
And the river is flowing
I got one of [...] baby yeah

One day you'll see me walking down the road
But I ain't ever wore a collar
Or a ball and chain
Yeah
The whole world's waiting

Scuse me Miss Rose
I gotta be going
Whichever way the wind is blowing
And the river is flowing
I got one of [...] baby yeah
