I hate rap, I hate rap
Couldn't drive me crazier with a map
Talk about a generation gap
I don't turn my cap, I don't grab my lap
I don't do like that 'cause I look like a sap
I hate rap, I hate rap
And it don't go good with beer on tap
I hate the beat, hate the rhythm
But I love that melody they put with 'em

I hate rap, I hate rap
One nerve left and it's about to snap
I'd rather hear a little Chihuahua yap
I don't walk that walk, I don't flap that flap
If I talked that talk my lips would chap
I hate rap, I hate rap
And it don't go good with beer on tap
I hate the beat, hate the rhythm
But I love that melody they put with 'em

INSTRUMENTAL

I hate rap, I hate rap
It would rip Van Winkle from a nap
I'd rather be woke up with a slap
Than try to sleep through jive so cheap
They have to bleed a bunch of crap
I hate rap, I hate rap
And it don't go good with beer on tap
I hate the beat, hate the rhythm
But I love that melody they put with 'em

INSTRUMENTAL

I hate rap, I hate rap
Couldn't drive me crazier with a map
Talk about a generation gap
I don't turn my cap, I don't grab my lap
I don't do like that 'cause I look like a sap
I hate rap, I hate rap
And it don't go good with beer on tap
