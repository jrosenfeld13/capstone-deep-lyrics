There's nothing wrong with me, I'm ok
It's only because recently been kind of grey that I feel down
I know what I'm aiming for
Don't think so much about everything and let the day take over
It ain't that hard to do

It's a beautiful day outside
But you don't know how to fly

There's nothing wrong with you, you're ok
It's only because things don't always go your way that yo feel down
Hey, what you waiting for?
Don't think so much about everything and let the day take over
It ain't that hard to do

It's a beautiful day outside
But you don't know how to fly
It's a beautiful day outside
But you don't know how to fly

Hey, what you waiting for?
Don't think so much about everything and let the day take over
It ain't that hard to do

It's a beautiful day outside
But you don't know how to fly
It's a beautiful day outside
It's a beautiful day outside
It's a beautiful day outside
It's a beautiful day outside
