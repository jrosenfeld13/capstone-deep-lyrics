Four o'clock in the morning now
Well I can't sleep for love
Been waiting for you to call
To say you love me enough
Lost my head that unhappy night
Please forgive every word
I see it all much clearer now
It all seems so absurd

But my plane leaves at 10AM
We both know I must go
To return I must be told
That you know what I know
Call me, baby, call me

To tell the truth I don't want to go
So say you want me to stay
You are more than all to me
This is no game that I play

But my plane leaves at 10AM
We both know I must go
To return I must be told
That you know what I know
Call me, baby, call me

But my plane leaves at 10AM
We both know I must go
To return I must be told
That you know what I know
Call me, baby, call me

Say you love me, say you do
Let me love you
Tell me that you want me to stay
