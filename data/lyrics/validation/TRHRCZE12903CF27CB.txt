I'm losing, losing touch with my mind
I'm fallin', fallin' way behind
I'm walkin' down a one-way street
I'm tryin', tryin' to find my feet

I need it babe, it makes me feel alright
I need it babe, it makes me feel alright, alright, alright

I'm movin', but I'm goin' no place
I'm thinkin', but my mind's in space
I'm hopin', hopin' to find my aim
I'm aimin', but I don't take the blame

I need it babe, it makes me feel alright
I need it babe, it makes me feel alright, alright, alright

I'm shootin', shootin' off my gun
It's too bad now babe, but it's a lot of fun
I'm livin' like you'd like to live
But I'm wantin' babe what you've got to give

I need it babe, it makes me feel alright
I need it babe, it makes me feel alright, alright, alright, alright
