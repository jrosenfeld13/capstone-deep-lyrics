This is our last night here
The air is cold as ice
All the trees that lost their leaves
Are reflected in our eyes
This is our last night here
Or so it seems
Silence like the darkest waters in a submarine...

This is our last night here
On planet Earth
And I don't want my heart
'Cause it always hurts
If this is our last night here
I won't kick and scream
I'll just grab onto you
And I dare to breathe...

If it's is our last night here for long
I'm gonna put this record on
I'm gonna burn this city down
And we'll watch the glow until it's gone
But before I go insane
There's something else to say

You thought you were alone
But I was with you all the way...

With you all the way
With you all the way...

If this is our last night here
On planet Earth
Then I'll give you my heart
'Cause it hurts too much
If this is our last night here
I won't change a thing
I'll just grab onto you
And I feel you breathe...

If this is our last night here...
If this is our last night here...
If this is our last night here
I'll grab onto you
Just to feel you breathe...

Breathe... [x8]
