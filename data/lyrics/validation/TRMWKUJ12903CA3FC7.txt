[Verse 1]
And if I'm wasting my time
Then nothing could be better
Than hanging on the line
And waiting for an honest word forever

[Verse 2]
And if you're saying goodbye
Please don't you think me bitter
For recalling every rhyme
From the book, the page, the line, the word, the letter

[Verse 3]
Well the windows turning blue
And the waters ever flowing
And I hope I'm not a fool
For laughing at myself as you were going
