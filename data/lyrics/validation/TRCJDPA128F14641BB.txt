Rain on me baby mean mistreater lover
You got me branded by your love iron
With a love and affection I keep praying
For your desire
Sweet evil woman, I walk through your fire

(Chorus)
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
I live and die for your love
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Heartbreaker taker of love

Sweeter than honey of love on my tongue
Well I'm a slave to your love
Black widow woman thy will has been done
Trapped in your web of fire

Sister of mercy, I'm hooked on your drug
Well I hear the cry of the sirens'
And the reaper is calling
She's really gripped around my soul
My time has come, and the bell it tolls

(Chorus)
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
I live and die for your love
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Woman - I'm flesh and I'm blood

Ooh baby, I live for the breath of your love
Day after day - girl I'm waiting in vain
I keep waiting for the time to come
When my darkest dawn will fade away
Oh, when it does
Then I'll feel the rising sun of your love

(Chorus)
