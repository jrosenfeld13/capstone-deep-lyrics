Another night on this interstate
Seems like I've been on it everyday for years now
Does it ever end
On my way to another show
Where I'll end up, I don't even know where I'm going
Or where I've been

Don't know why, don't know how
But I keep comin' back for more
It's my life, there's no doubt
Guess I'll never know for sure
But when I stand on the stage, and the curtain falls
I love it all

It's getting late, I think I'll lay it down
Then I'll wake up in some other town and I'll wander
To my hotel room
I'll walk around just a-wastin' time
Lookin' for a little peace of mind I bet I'll find it
On an ole barstool

Don't know why, don't know how
But I keep comin' back for more
It's my life, there's no doubt
Guess I'll never know for sure
But when I stand on the stage, and the curtain falls
I love it all

Don't know why, don't know how
But I keep comin' back for more
It's my life, there's no doubt
Guess I'll never know for sure
But when I stand on that stage and the curtain falls
And the crowd wants to stay for one more song
I love it all

Another night on this interstate
Seems like I've been on it everyday for years now
I hope it never ends
