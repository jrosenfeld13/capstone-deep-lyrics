[Verse 1]
See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Colder than the moon
It's been so long
And I've been putting out fire
With gasoline

[Verse 2]
See these eyes so red
Red like jungle burning bright
Those who feel me near
Pull the blinds and change their minds
It's been so long

[Verse 3]
Still this pulsing night
A plague I call a heartbeat
Just be still with me
Well you wouldn't believe what I've been through
You've been so long
Well it's been so long
And I've been putting out the fire
With gasoline
Putting out the fire
With gasoline

[Verse 4]
See these tears so blue
An ageless heart
That can never mend
These tears can never dry
A judgement made
Can never bend
See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Just be still with me
You wouldn't believe what I've been through

[Verse 5]
You've been so long
Well, it's been so long
And I've been putting out the fire
With gasoline
Putting out fire with gasoline
