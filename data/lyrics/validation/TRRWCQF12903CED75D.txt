I've been on the road for many years
Never got myself a place to settle down
And even though I've had
My ups and downs I know
I'm still the same old kid like I used to be
I'm still the same old kid like I used to be

But I wonder yes I wonder
Will I ever make it home
To the place where I was born
And the town where I grew up

Spinning wheels that take me
Down this endless highway
Don't ever seem to take me home
And every where I go
I know I'm going my way
Still I feel so all alone

Many years have gone and I've grown old
In my youth I thought it
Never slow me down
But before I fade away
Just let me say to you
I'm still the same old kid like I used to be
I'm still the same old kid like I used to be

But I'm praying and I'm hoping
That there soon will come a day
When I'll be drinking with my friends
Singing songs of yesterday
