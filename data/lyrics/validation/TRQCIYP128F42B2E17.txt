[Intro]
Ooh, no
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
She's got green eyes and she's 5'5"
Long brown hair all down her back
Cadillac truck, so the hell, what's so special about that
She used to model, she's done some acting
So she weighs a buck o' 5
And I guess that she's alright if perfection's what you like

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
And I'm not jealous
No, I'm not
Ooh, ooh
I just want everything she's got
Ooh, ooh
You look at her so amazed
I remember way back when you used to look at me that way

[Chorus]
Tell me what makes her so much better than me? (what makes her so much better than me?)
What makes her just everything I can never be? (I can never be)
What makes her your every dream and fantasy?
Because I can remember when it was me

[Verse 2]
And now you don't feel the same
I remember you would shiver Every time I said your name
And now you don't feel the same
I remember you would shiver everytime I said your name
You said nothing felt as good as when you gazed into my eyes
Now you don't care I'm alive
How did we let the fire die?

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
And I'm not jealous
No, I'm not
Ooh, ooh
I just want everything she's got
Ooh, ooh
You look at her so amazed
I remember way back when you used to look at me that way

[Chorus]
Tell me what makes her so much better than me? (what makes her so much better than me?)
What makes her just everything I can never be? (I can never be)
What makes her your every dream and fantasy?
Because I can remember when it was me

[Bridge]
That made you smile (me)
That made you laugh
Me, that make you happier than you have ever been (oh me)
That was your world (me)
Your perfect girl
Nothing about me has changed
That's why I'm here, wondering

[Chorus]
What makes her so much better than me? (what makes her so much better than me?)
What makes her just everything I can never be? (I can never be)
What makes her your every dream and fantasy?
Because I can remember when it was....
What makes her so much better than me? (what makes her so much better than me?)
What makes her just everything I can never be? (I can never be)
What makes her your every dream and fantasy?
Because I can remember when it was me

[Outro]
When it was me
When it was me
When it was me
