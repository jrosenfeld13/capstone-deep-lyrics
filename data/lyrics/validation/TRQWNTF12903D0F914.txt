No matter how you fall
It shouldn't bother you at all
It could take more to overcome less in a day
No matter how you break
You shouldn't be the one to take
Your own opinions as they twist in their own way
When all she wants is to be left
Off to the side and counted with the rest
All she wants is to be spared
From voting for a candidate who doesn't care
Though many more have been provided
When the only one decided
Is someone who's left to wait
And any promise worth fulfilling
What when only one needs selling
Isn't one to leave till late

No matter how it's read
Only so much can be said
About subscribing to a point that has no ground
No matter how it feels
Your speculation isn't real
Nothing can be guaged until it comes around
When all she wants is to be left
Off to the side and counted with the rest
All she wants is to be spared
From voting for a candidate who doesn't care
And though the end may seem divided
Every story is two sided
But it's only yours you'll know
And truth be told if you are willing
Then that promises fulfilling
Is what only time could show
