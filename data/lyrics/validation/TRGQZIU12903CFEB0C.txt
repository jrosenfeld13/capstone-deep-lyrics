Why?
Wanna tell me bye bye?
Shy
To unzip and untie?
Butterfly lashes
That flutter with passion
Femme fatale fantastique

Dying to live
In an elegant future
You're casting a spell over me

Look at My Lucky Bride!
Dreaming clever
Everything we share
You're gonna blow it all
Plastic cards and lives
Together

Verse 2:

Yum Yum
Yoghurt spills on my arm
Love
E-mails for breakfast
Beautiful Creatures
Please do enjoy us
We know how hard you may feel
You don't have to wait for inspiration
But magic won't pay any bill
