I don't tell the truth
I bet that's not a real surprise
I said I'd be forgetting about you
But now I know I'm wasting my time
You won't set me free
I guess I'll never get away
I can't beat that feeling inside you
You're bangin' on my heart again

B-B-B-Bangin'
Bangin' on my heart
B-B-B-Bangin'

Just another girl
Is all I thought you were and then
You went and proved me wrong
Now I'm in trouble
You're bangin' on my heart again
Numbers all I took
Figures still inside my head
And now I'm not sure that it's all over
I thought you were gone
You're back in my heart again
Heart again
Back in my heart again
Heart again

You've known all along
I jump whenever
You're banin' on my heart again
Ooh I've been into you
More times than you've been into me
But this scar's gonna last forever
I know this feeling's something you'll never see
I know this feeling's something you'll never see
Bangin' on my heart again
Bangin' on my heart again

B-B-B-Bangin'
Bangin' on my heart
B-B-B-Bangin'
Bangin' on my heart
