(Kevin Welch)

I don't want nobody
I'm better off alone
I'm sworn to independence
My heart is made of stone
But you're breakin' on through
Oh, there's somethin' 'bout you

I've been tapping my toes
To the way you talk
And I've been singin' along
To the way you walk
I've got to do
Somethin' 'bout you

Chorus
Well, I've got this place of mine
It's nice and quiet and I like it fine
I work real hard got no time for you
But I've whiskied up my coffee cup
Sittin' here tryin' not to call you up
It's gettin' to where I don't know what to do
Oh. there's somethin' 'bout you

--- Instrumental ---

Somethin' about you like distant thunder
And I can't say I ain't been warned
But there's no shelter to crawl under
Ever gonna save me from this storm

Oh, there's somethin' 'bout you
That I can't shake
There's somethin' 'bout you
That's been keeping me awake
The whole night through
Oh, there's somethin' 'bout you

Chorus
Well, I've got this place of mine
It's nice and quiet and I like it fine
I work real hard got no time for you
But I've whiskied up my coffee cup
Sittin' here tryin' not to call you up
It's gettin' to where I don't know what to do
Oh. there's somethin' 'bout you, babe, somethin' 'bout you...
