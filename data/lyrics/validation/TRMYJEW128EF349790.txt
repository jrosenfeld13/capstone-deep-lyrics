[Intro]
You're jealous of me you think other fellas love me
Well I don't care if they come or go

[Verse 1]
Darling can't you see that no lover is returned by me
Oh jealous lover can't you see
Johnny's only teasin' when he said he'd fall
'Cause you know you and I were playin' records all along

[Verse 2]
Jealous lover can't you see that you're the only one that I love
No matter what they say it's you and only you all the way
Oh jealous lover though handsome boys may pass me by
You're still my kind of guy
You're not very handsome but you're so sweet and kind

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Oh come to me and let me dry your weeping eyes
Then you'll see the light
Then you'll know it's you I love with all my might

[Outro]
As long as day is day [?]
Right here in my heart you're gonna stay
Jealous lover, jealous lover
As long as day is day
Right here in my heart you're gonna stay
Jealous lover jealous lover
