She knows that I'm waiting by the door
I know that she's trying to cover up staring at the floor

Lets Go! Don't say maybe
Forget everyone around let's together and get down
I know it sounds crazy 1, 2, 3 times a lady

Oh no, I've got the notion
Lets get together and start the commotion
Round and round til everyone stops
'til the next needle on the record player drops

It's almost time to say our goodbyes and get home tonight
Lets do it up one more time
Show these people what we had in mind
