Burn Nya burn down Babylon place
Inna them high and low place
Wickedness me deh go chase
Oh burn Nya burn down Babylon place

Just now they come to realize it, somehow they had want to criticise
Black people get the worst yet them doh have no rights
Them ah do the dutty work yet you shove aside
Yo me start to burn them turf day and night
Rastaman nah nurse no pharecies nor scribes
Shouldn't dis the warriors pon tha east side
Watch them ____ eh that shell like ah rice

Cut all them style them only lef you one choice
This is the hour where the wicked get smite

When the Bobo man pass through everything get right
Rasta them ah spite, say them blow us dynamite, oy
