Suddenly I saw what I had done to it
Oh no, I'd murdered it, yeah
Dizzy, I fell in the chair, blood soaking in my hair
A body on the ground
The aftermath was an afterthought
Though I know I won't get caught
You've kept quiet up 'til now

I don't know how long
I can stay just this strong
I don't know how long
I can stay this strong
Suddenly, I feel I'm wrong

Suddenly I knew what I felt that I must do
I dug myself a hole
Operating within a trance, I breathed the air's romance
And threw you in the dirt
Now I'm not one for broken hearts, so I climbed into the dark
And lied right by your side
The rain washed in the soil, we were alone again
As in love as we'd ever been

I don't know how long
We can stay just this strong
I don't know how long
We can stay this strong
At least we were never wrong
