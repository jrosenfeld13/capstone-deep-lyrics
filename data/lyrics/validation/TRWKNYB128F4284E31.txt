If I wrote history
And could pocket a moment for me
It would be
Singin' with the big bands

I would turn back the clock
For the time we'll be in for a shock
Hearin me singin' with the big bands

If I had me a genie inside Aladdin's lamp
I'd tell him do your thing
And like that I would be
At the Paramount in '43
And I sing

Ringin' in the good times
Swingin' with the big boys
Singin' with the big bands
Singin' with the big bands

If I had me a genie inside Aladdin's lamp
I'd tell him Mr. Genie go on and do your thing
And like that I would be
At the Paramount in '43
And I sing

Ringin' in the good times
Singin' with the big boys
Swingin' it in swing time
Bringing back the big noise

I'm jumpin' with the Duke
Stompin' with the King
Cooler than the Kid
Swinging everything
I'm singin' with the big bands
