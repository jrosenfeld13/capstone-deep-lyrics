[Chorus 1]
I'd heard The Burritos out in California
Could fly higher than The Byrds
Roger McQuinn had a 12 string guitar
It was like nothing I'd ever heard

[Chorus 2]
And The Eagles flew in from the west coast
Like The Byrds they were trying to be free
While in Texas the talk turned to Outlaws
Like Willie and Waylon and me, hey

[Chorus 3]
Well, they say Texas music's in the make
And we've been making music that is free
Doing one night stands, playing with our bands
Willie, Waylon and me, oh Mad Dog

[Verse 1]
They say The Beatles were just the beginning
Of everything music could be
Just like The Stones I was rolling alone
Like a ship lost out on the sea
And Joplin would die for the future
And Dylan would write poetry
And in Texas the talk turned to Outlaws
Like Willie and Waylon and me, hey

[Bridge]
My name is David Allen Coe and I'm from Dallas Texas

[Chorus 3]
Well, they say Texas music's in the make
And we've been making music that is free
Doing one night stands, playing with our bands
Willie, Waylon and me, oh Mad Dog

[Chorus 1]
I'd heard The Burritos out in California
Could fly higher than The Byrds
Roger McQuinn had a 12 string guitar
It was like nothing I'd ever heard

[Chorus 2]
And The Eagles flew in from the west coast
Like The Byrds they were trying to be free
While in Texas the talk turned to Outlaws
Like Willie and Waylon and me, hey
