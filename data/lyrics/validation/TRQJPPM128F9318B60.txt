One day I'll go out walking
I don't know where (could be anywhere)
Send a letter cos I'm sick of talking
(Send my love you know I won't be there)
It's gonna last for ever and there's nothing I can do
(Nothing I can do)
Get yourself together that's what it comes back to
(Coming back to you)

No matter what you say
It doesn't matter what you do
(It all comes back to)
No matter what you say, no matter what I do
It all comes back to you

One day you'll see it my way
I don't know when (could be anywhere)
Another wreck on life's long highway
Another trip you know we'll have to share
It's gonna last forever and there's nothing I can do
(Nothing I can do)
Get yourself together that's what it comes back to
(Coming back to you)
Nothing I can do without it, your love must be true
(It all comes back to you)
Nothing I can say about it, keep coming back to you
(It all comes back to you)

Nothing I can do without it, your love must be true
(It all comes back to you)
Nothing I can say about it, keep coming back to you
(It all comes back to you)
No matter what you say, it doesn't matter what you do
(It all comes back to you)
No matter what you say, no matter what I do
(It all comes back to you)
No matter what you say, it doesn't matter what you do
(It all comes back to you)
No matter what you say, no matter what I do
(It all comes back to you)
