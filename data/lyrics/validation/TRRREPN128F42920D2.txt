Right from the start
Back to the ancient time

[Chorus]
The lights of the night are shining
When the light of the day is gone
In spite of the dark tonight
In my heart there shines a light

The stars are there
For all to see and not to reach

Where they came from
And who we are
To bring one down

[Repeat Chorus x3]
