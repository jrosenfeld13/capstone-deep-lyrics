Over here the ladies
All want sweet perfume
But there's never a rose
And over there
The roses are frightened to bloom
So they never can grow

And over here they need wool
For weaving their baby's new clothes
But nobody has any wool
And the sheep are all lost in the harbour

And over here
They want diamonds to wear
But there aren't any here
And over there
Everyone's hiding their tears
But they're crying inside

And the wall won't come down
Til they're no longer afraid of themselves
If you don't believe me, ask yourselves
And I can come down to the harbour

And then I will fill the ocean
Back up with my tears
I still have a couple more years
And then I can come back to the harbour
