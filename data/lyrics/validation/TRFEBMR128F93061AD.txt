Love! Love! Love! Love, love, love!
There ain't nothin' in this world for a boy and a girl but love, love, love
Love, love, love: love. love, love
There ain't nothin' in this world for a boy and a girl but love, love, love
And that's the only thing I'm thinkin' of

Love can make you happy when you're feelin' blue
If the one you love is in love with you

There ain't nothin' in this world for a boy and a girl but love, love, love
Love, love, love: love. love, love
There ain't nothin' in this world for a boy and a girl but love, love, love
And that's the only thing I'm thinkin' of

Love can pick you up (love can pick you up)
When you feel low-down (when you feel low-down)
Love can make you smile when you're wearin' a frown

I want it, I need it, fill my cup with lo-ove, lo-ove, lo-ove
Lo-ove, lo-ove, lo-ove: lo-ove, lo-ove, lo-ove
Let me drink till my head goes 'round and 'round with lo-ove, lo-ove, lo-ove
So come and be my, be my turtle dove
