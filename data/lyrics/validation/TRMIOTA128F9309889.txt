Picture a world of your own deepest wishes
I know it's secrets of delights so delicious
You sense the words that will weaken my resistance
Lighter than air total magical existence

Shangri-la
You're my keeper
Shangri-la
The sweetest feeling of all

Magnetic lips radiant and luminescent
Deep summer nights shimmering and phosphorescent
Dazzling allure that leads on in one direction
Pleasure of love feeding on this sweet confection

Shangri-la
You're my keeper
Shangri-la
The sweetest feeling
Sweetest feeling of all

Picture a world of your own deepest wishes
