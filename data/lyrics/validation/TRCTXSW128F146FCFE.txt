Be young, be foolish but be happy
Be young, be foolish but be happy

Don't let the rain get you down
It's a waste of time, a waste of time
Have your fun, live everyday
In the bright sunshine, the bright sunshine

Be young, be foolish but be happy
Be young, be foolish but be happy

Same old story all over the world
Girl meets boy and boy meets girl

So be young, be foolish, be happy
Be young, be foolish but be happy

Don't let love slip away, slip away
Live your life for today, for today
Life is too short to worry
About unimportant things, unimportant things

Reach for the sky, touch your star
And then you find your dream, find your dream
'Cause dreamin' alone, it's a shame indeed
But if you got love that's all you need

So be young, be foolish, girl be happy
Baby be young, foolish, let's be happy
Be young, be foolish, girl be happy
Baby be young, foolish, let's be happy
Baby be young, foolish and happy
Be young, be foolish, be happy
