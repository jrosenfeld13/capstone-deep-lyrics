A little bitter
A little sweet
That's how I like my life to be
I'll take it neat
Bitter sweet
That's how I see the world

I like the rain
I like the dark
I like the mornings in the park
The summer heat
Bitter sweet
That's how I see the world

Oh let's go
Let's go
To paradise, Jack
Paradise, Jack
Let's go
Let's go
To paradise, Jack
Paradise, Jack

I got the sorrow
I got the smile
I got a box under the stars
Shoes on my feet
Bitter sweet
That's how I see the world

I got the joke
I got the twist
I got a lazy afternoon
I'm a man over the moon
Man of the world

Oh let's go
Let's go
To paradise, Jack
Paradise, Jack
Let's go
Let's go
To paradise, Jack
Paradise, Jack

Chain me to a tree
Watch me
I'll set myself free
Escape from situations
Houdini would be proud of me
I'll lie around like Byron
And write verses to the moon
I'm the crime and I'm the siren
I'm a fighter in the ring of life

I've got the medals
I've got the scars
I've got a pocket full of hope
I got the beat
Bitter sweet
That's how I see the world

And the moon is in my head
The moon is in my head
The moon is in my head
