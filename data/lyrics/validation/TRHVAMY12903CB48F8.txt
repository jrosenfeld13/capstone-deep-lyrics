You are, as dead as you were
The day before your parents met
Unwanted, hungry, and abused

Baby Satan is a little brat
A vile being in his habitat
He was born with horns and a crooked spine
To plague the sacred and divine

Into another burning hell
Falls an angel from the sky
Cursed from birth
Until the day that he dies
You must be the devil
Because I've always loved you so
Baby Satan
You've got the devil in your eyes

Souls of the damned
Are in the palms, of the street lights

Baby satan is a little brat
A vile being in his habitat
He was born with horns and a crooked spine
To plague the sacred and divine

Into another burning hell
Falls an angel from the sky
Cursed from birth
Until the day that he dies
You must be the devil
Because I've always loved you so
Baby Satan
You've got the devil in your eyes

Father of darkness
Seduce the weakness I hold dear

Baby Satan, baby Satan, baby Satan, baby Satan

A plague of locusts
Arouse the children into fear

Baby Satan, baby Satan, baby Satan, baby Satan

Burn down this Babylon
We'll sleep forever

Into another burning hell
Falls an angel from the sky
Cursed from birth
Until the day that he dies
You must be the devil
Because I've always loved you so
Baby Satan
You've got the devil in your eyes

BABY SATAN!
