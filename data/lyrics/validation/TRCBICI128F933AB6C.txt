[Title influenced from the same-titled second aria sung by the Queen of the Night in Mozart's opera The Magic Flute (Die Zauberflte).]

By the seventh factor I have betrayed you
They'll forgive you beyond comprehension
---
As one we have walked before
The wolf and god's sinner by name
----
Der Hlle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen
Would that I could spare the child but there's no innocence

[verse 2]
All of the chalice has been drunk
Then bleeds away
(scream)
The inexorable change
The one ?? ?? beast
Der Hlle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen
Would that I could spare the child but there's no innocence
All your screaming is in fact murder
Der Hlle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen

And all hail the descending fire to cleanse what we lay waste
A debt to history repaid, iniquity replaced
