Played out what was the cause?
Stayed up just to sleep straight through it
Who threw out what I collected?
Nailed to the blank spot where it got lost
When I paid attention
Hearing what I've never seen before
Thinking nothing more
And I won't find it
It's a holy ghost
Where were you when it just left? (yeah)
Nailed to the blank spot where it got lost
I can't buy attention, I can't pay
And knowing that it's here
All this time we knew you were onto something
That you were onto something
