Oh ooh, Yeah yeahayayaa, mhmm, huh!
I admit I don't know how to listen
The trouble is predictant, wandering away
It doesn't help you never feel like kissing
Theres always something fishing, but i miss you babe
Miss you baby, baby!
(Can we get right, tonight tonight)x2
Can we get right? (uhoouhooo)
I need some of your love tonight
I need some OF your love
So kiss my lips and hold me tight
Lets get it right!
Chances are will have to make some changes
To get back to the basics
Get back to your smile
We should be holding hands and making faces
Somebodies gotta say "I love you baby, i love you baby baby!"

So kiss my lips and hold me tight
