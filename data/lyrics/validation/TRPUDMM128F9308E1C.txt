It was not copasetic
It was not right

No weapons that were fought for thee
None of them shall prosper
This is a time when man should be free
Instead of seeking disaster
It is a state of emergency
The government called in the military
They say all their men must fall
With the method, operation withdrawal

It was not copasetic
It was not right

Young men of my noble race
Must you cause such a big disgrace?
Free up the soldiers out of the reign
Let us all be at peace again

It was not copasetic
It was not right
