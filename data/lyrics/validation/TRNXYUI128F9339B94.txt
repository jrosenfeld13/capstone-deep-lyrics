[Verse 1]
Dreamless sleep will fall
Like a deep, poisoned well
On the steeple birds
And this red-light hotel

[Chorus]
So lay your pistol down, Granny
The company men never came to you
But don't unknit your brow, Granny
The mice in the yard ate the potted plants you grew

[Verse 2]
Pour your bitter tea
For our sweet, liquored host
Perfect polished stones
But this breeze beats you both

[Chorus]
So lay your pistol down, Granny
The duty of men never fell to you
When you unknit your brow, Granny
Your friends, they are jewels, twice as beautiful and few
