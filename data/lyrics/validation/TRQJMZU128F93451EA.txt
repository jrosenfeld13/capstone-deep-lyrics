It is such fun to see
Such fun to see
Satan lose
It is such fun to see

Jesus is the Winna mon
The Winna mon
The winna mon
Jesus is the Winna mon
The Winna mon all the time
I am on the winning side
I am on the winning side
The winning side
The winning side
I am on the winning side
The winning side all the time
In Matthew chapter two
Satan lost
When Jesus was born in a manger
And in the wilderness
Satan lost again
At the Mount of Transfiguration
Yeah!

At the crucifixion
Satan lost again
When Jesus rose triumphantly
From the grave
And at the ascension
Satan lost
Once more
When I was born again
Yeah!

Winna mon
Jesus is the Winna mon
The Winna mon all the time
Winna mon
Jesus is the Winna mon
The Winna mon all the time
He the Winna
The Winna
The Winna
Jesus is the Winna mon
The Winna mon all the time
He's the Winna
The Winna
The Winna
Winna mon
Jesus is the Winna mon
The Winna mon all the time
