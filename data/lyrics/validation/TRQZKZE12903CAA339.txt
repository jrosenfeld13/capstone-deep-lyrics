I got a mirror, a bottle and a pen
The mirror is cracked
The bottle is empty
And my pen don't know where to begin

I've got a picture, a letter and a song
The picture is torn
The letter is worn
And my tune has been sung before

Another show is over
And the lights have gone down
There's no flowers at my door
No, no callers come around, baby

But I'm glad to be alive and in the land of the living
Oh I can't believe that I survived
And I'm in the land of the living
Can't believe that I survived

I saw the city, the lights and the music
The city is hard
The lights they have lied
The music just seems to have died

And I had my hope
I had my faith
Oh my pride, yeah
And to hope I cling
To faith I am blind
And my pride I have left far behind

Another show is over
And the lights have gone down
There's no flowers at my door
Ain't no callers come around babe

But I'm glad to be alive and in the land of the living, babe
I can't believe that I survived
Still in the land of the living, baby
Can't believe that I'm alive

Still in the land of the living, baby
Can't believe that I survived
Oh no, I'm still in the land of the living
Yea Yea Yea

You see another night is over
And the curtain's come down
I see no flowers at my door
Oh no one's comin' 'round, yeah
But I'm glad to be alive
Still in the land of the living
Bet you can't believe I survived
Still alive in the land of the living

Oh babe, I'm still alive
In the land of the living
I bet you, bet you can't believe I survived
Oh, I'm still in the land of the living

Another night is over
I'm still in the land of the living
I see the curtains coming down
But babe, I'm still in the land of the living
I bet you can't believe me, I bet you can't believe
Yes, Here I am, I see that I'm still in the land of the living
Yea, I'm going to take my curtain call
Because I'm in the land of the living
