The night has become
The source of all the drum
When we get this straight
The ritual may begin
The sun as arised
With the morning by his side
Putting shadows into place
Bringing light to human race

I want to know where I'm coming from
We're made of Love
The source of all (x2)

And now my mind is on the run
And now the beat rise fast and strong
And now the lights are turning on
The magic dance is about to begin
And now my feet are on the run
And now my heart pumps fast and strong
And now my mind melts into all
The magic dance is about to begin
The magic dance is about to begin

Colours as bright as never before
Barriers are all lost gone
All the love become one
The magic dance has just begun

I want to know where I'm coming from
We're made of love
I want to know where I'm coming from
Do you really know why?
I want to know where I'm coming from
We're made of love
The source of all
I want to know where I'm coming from
We're made of love
The source of all!!

And now my mind is on the run
And now the beat rise fast and strong
And now the lights are turning on
The magic dance is about to begin
And now my feet are on the run
And now my heart pumps fast and strong
And now my mind melts into all
The magic dance is about to begin
And now my mind is on the run
And now the beat rise fast and strong
And now the lights are turning on
The magic dance is about to begin
And now my feet are on the run
And now the beat rise fast and strong
And now the lights are turning on
The magic dance is about to begin
