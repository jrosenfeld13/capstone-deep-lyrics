Your evil eye, every night
Cruising slow, flashing lights
There together, in the dark
But it ain't no friend, it's just another scared narc
I know you, lawman, lawman, lawman, lawman
I think you're a poor man, lawman, hey!

Every time you speak to me
Makes it plain that you don't see
What's really happening here
You just confuse respect with fear
I know you, lawman, lawman, lawman, lawman
I think you're a poor man, poor man
I know you!

See you in the Crown Court
It seems to me it's like a bloodsport
I know you live by the book of rules
But anyone who needs a book is a fool
I know you, lawman, lawman, lawman
Lawman, you know you're a poor man, poor man, lawman
