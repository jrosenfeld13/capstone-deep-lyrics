Honey, I'm with the Flinch Mob
I'll clean up your inkspot
I love just the red dot
Pencil through my hand
You always go to work sick
I think you had a wood tick
The virus will not hurt you
Pencil through my hand
Looking for the right coat
Laughing like a mountain goat
Spending all my time with a
Pencil through my hand
