I have great expectations
I can represent this nation
I am a wild party

Ooh, I am a late bloomer
Ooh, I was ugly as a child
Pimples on my pimples and scabs on my scabs
I've got pretty dimples and my face has class

I am a wild party
I am a wild party
Shakin' like a human being

Ooh, and here come I in a limo
Yeah, I gotta crawl out through the goddamn window, yes I am
I'm rude and I'm crude but I give good thang
I've got pretty dimples and my face has class

I am a wild party
I am a wild party
I am a wild party
Shakin' like a human being

Shakin' like a human being

I know I'm a lotta feathers and not much chicken
I know I'm a lotta feathers and not much chicken

Shakin' like a human being
I'm shakin' like a human being

I am a wild party
I am a wild party
I am a wild party
