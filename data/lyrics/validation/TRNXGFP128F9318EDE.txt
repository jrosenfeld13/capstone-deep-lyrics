Deep within the corners of my mind
I keep a memory of your faces
And I only pull it out when I long for your embrace

Deep within the corners of my mind
I'm haunted by your smile
As it promises me joys like a journey to a tropic isle
It's not hard to see what you do to me
It's like a page right out of fist time wave
Though I try to fight it all the word you write
Leave me standing in the starry robe in some tradjec lovers place

But deep within the corners of my mind
I'm praying secretly that eventually in time
There'll be a place for you and me

That eventually in time
There'll be a place for you and me

There'll be a place for you and me

Deep within the corners of my mind
