I want to turn on the lights
I want to keep your hopes alive
So where do I begin
To help you believe again
Makers of secret planes
Keepers of our last remains
Dream of a holy state
In a nightmare time

You know I meant it well
But who was it meant to help?

Even a child knows you dont waste it
A promise is only given once
And there is no doubt that changes have begun
Even a child knows that you can't fake it
As long as the world is waking up
You are free now to recover your heart

The stories left to write
The ebb and flow of my life
To justify the end
I'll do everything I can
And it's a dangerous game
I heard you tell someone that you don't care
But I don't believe the message

And when you sing about love
What are you thinking of?

Even a child knows you dont waste it
As long as the world is waking up
And there is no doubt that changes have begun
Even a child knows you don't fake it
A promise is only given once
You are free now to go wherever you want

Theres nothing like waking up in some foreign town
Music is a call to prayer
Wailing out of the speakers in the market place
The first time
Even a child

Even a child knows you don't waste it
A present can always be delivered twice
You are free now to receive the gift of insight

From now on (lets be open)
All in time (lets breathe in)
Am I brave (you're so brave)
Am I afraid (no not afraid)
Even a child
