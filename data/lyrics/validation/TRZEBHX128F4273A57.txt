Unity of black souls
Speech from talent
Shell the shadow slower
Returns the avatar
Prepared for a long time
Since the sinking began
The God hates the religion
Satan hates the God
The meanings are going fast
As the time is passing by
No one can see the story
The source of knowledge is hidden
Meditation on ecstasy
I worship the knowledge
(behind) the digital goat masque
All are a part of the path which is
Shifting from life
To join the digital Goat
Forgotten aristocratics
Reborn by the black bible
Standing for the supreme joy
Of ecstatic ocean of the goat
Its not by the chosen blood
Its not by the religion
It comes, it seeds inside
It comes from deep inside
The haunting black spells
Of them once become heard
The eternal joy and pleasure
Will be their final fair
Recreation comes true
As the battle had been done
And when the orgasm is over
There is nothing, nothing left
Only the pure empty space
Silence of all sounds
Surrounded by a dark industry
A forgotten sound factory
