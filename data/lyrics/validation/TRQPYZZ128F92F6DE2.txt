Old man walking on the old foot path
Old man walking with his first son
Oh son my heart is on the ocean
And my eyes are burning from the salt sea

The sun is steady as the sun it will rise
Morning the wind is in the willow
Oh son the wind is in the willow
And the morning is steady as the sunrise

My heart is in the ocean
My heart is in the ocean
And my eyes are burning from the salt sea

The ship is sailing as the ships they do sail
Over the blue and misty water
Oh son your ship is in the harbor
And your bag is tuggin at your shoulder

The seagull is flying as seagulls do fly
Crossing over the ocean
Oh son you're crossing over the ocean
And the seagull is flying as the bird flies

The sun is steady as the sun it will rise
Farewell my first son
Oh son my heart is on the ocean
And my eyes are burning from the salt sea
