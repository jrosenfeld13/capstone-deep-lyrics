I'm not the kind to complain
That I never had a girl to love
Many a fine girl I tried hard to know
But I think I never tried enough

Sitting one day by myself
And I'm thinking, "What could be wrong?"
When this funny little Hedgehog comes running up to me
And it starts up to sing me this song

Oh, you know all the words, and you sung all the notes
But you never quite learned the song, she sang
I can tell by the sadness in your eyes
That you never quite learned the song

Every day when the sun go down
And the evening is so very still
Many a fine girl I've held in my arms
And I hope there's many more that I will

But just when everything is going fine
And absolutely nothing is wrong
This funny little Hedgehog's always around
And every time he wants to sing me this song

Oh, you know all the words, and you sung all the notes
But you never quite learned the song, she sang
I can tell by the sadness in your eyes
That you never quite learned the song

One day when the moon was full
I thought I might settle down
Found myself a pretty little girl
And I stopped all my running around

But just when the preacher come along
And he's just gonna pop on the ring
This funny little Hedgehog comes running down the aisle
And I don't have to tell you what he did sing

Oh, you know all the words, and you sung all the notes
But you never quite learned the song, she sang
I can tell by the sadness in your eyes
That you never quite learned the song

I'm not the kind to complain
That I never had a girl to love
Many fine girls I've tried hard to know
But I think I never tried enough

But now I'll be looking all my days
And it isn't just me I got to please
There's this funny little Hedgehog who's always around
And the only words he ever sings to me are these

Oh, you know all the words and you sung all the notes
But you never quite learned the song, she sang
I can tell by the sadness in your eyes
That you never quite learned the song

I'm not the kind to complain
