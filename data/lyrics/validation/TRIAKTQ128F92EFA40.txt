[Intro]
Bugman, bugman

[Verse 1]
I am an ex offender
They let me out in the summer
I think I was in a coma
I didn't know what to do
Oh no

[Chorus]
You go hang around, go round
I'll watch myself hang on
Look out for the Bug man
You go hang around, around
I'll watch myself hang on
Look out for the Bug man

[Verse 2]
I got no sense of existence
I know the nodding dogs
I go out in the city
I stay away from the bugs
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
You go hang around, go round
I'll watch myself look out
Look out for the Bug man
You go hang around, around
I'll watch myself hang on
Look out for the B-b-b-bug man
The B-b-b-bug man
The B-b-b-bug man
The B-b-b-bug man
Oh Bug man!

[Verse 3]
I go out in the city
I stay away from the bugs
Oh yeah

[Interlude]
Na, na, na, na, na, oh, no
Na, na, na, na, na, oh, no
Na, na, na, na, na, oh, no
Na, na, na, na, na, oh, no
Na, na, na, na, na, oh, no
Na, na, na, na, na, oh, no
I go out in the city
Look out for the Bug man

Stay away from the ooh-ooh bugs
Stay away from the ooh-ooh bugs
Stay away from the ooh-ooh bugs
Stay away from the ooh-ooh bugs
Stay away from the ooh-ooh bugs

[Outro]
Na, na, na, na, na, oh, no
Na, na, na, na, na, oh, no
Na, na, na, na, na, oh, no
Na, na, na, na, na, oh, no
Na, na, na, na, na, oh, no
Na, na, na, na, na, oh, no
Space is the place
Space is the place
Space is the place
Space is the place
Space is the place
Space is the place
Space is the place
Space is the place
