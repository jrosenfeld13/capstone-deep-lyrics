I laid all I own at the devil's feet
And I have placed a rose between the angel's teeth
Night lay beside me, night lay beside me
I wish you could hear what I hear when I'm out there
The stars all seem to burn
And scream into the atmosphere
Night lay beside me, night lay beside me
May grief fall away like leaves from the trees
May grief fall away like leaves from the trees
And night lay beside me, only night lay beside me
