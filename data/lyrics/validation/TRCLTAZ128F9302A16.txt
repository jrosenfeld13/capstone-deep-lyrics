[Verse 1]
If I be so inclined to climb up beside you
Would you tell me that the time just isn't right?
And if I should ever find the key you hide so well
Will you tell me that I can spend the night?

[Chorus 1]
Leaving your smell on my coat
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand what it is about this woman

[Verse 2]
If I could bottle up the chills that you give me
I would keep them in a jar next to my bed
And If I should ever draw a picture of a woman
It is you that would come flowing from my pen

[Chorus 1]
Leaving the clothes on the floor
Making me walk out the door
And I still fail to understand what it is about this woman
Fail to understand what it is about this woman

[Verse 3]
Helplessly melting as I stand next to the sun
As she burns me, I am screaming out for more
Drink every drop of liquid heat that I've become
Pop me open, spill me out onto the floor

[Chorus 1]
Leaving your smell on my coat
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand,  fail to understand
Leaving your smell on my coat
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand what it is about this woman
