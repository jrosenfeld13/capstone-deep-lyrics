[Verse 1:]
Tipsy with St. John
He's got me feeling like a kid on halloween
And he asks me
What I wanna be
I got nothing to say
He says that's ok
He says
"I don't either but I got my
Dreams and maybe some are
Apparitions in the fog
But still I see them down in my soul
Like little girls in bows
Held up on little boys' shoulders."

Do people, when they're older
See places on maps get smaller
And promises of happiness stall?

[Chorus:]
I wanna see you again

Now she's drawing circles in the air
The ground is moving under me
But to where?

[Verse 2:]
Remember Susie?
Yeah she's got a pucker apple
In the ball of her chin
So I hugged her neck
And said I'm sorry for the way I been
She said, "that's ok."

Into my shoulder she said
"oh-oh-oh-oh
Now that I'm oh-oh-older
The distances on maps got smaller
And promises of happiness stalled."

[Chorus:]
I wanna see you again

Now she's drawing circles in the air
The ground is moving under me
But to where?
