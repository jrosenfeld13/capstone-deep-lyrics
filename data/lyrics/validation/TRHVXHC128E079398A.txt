What can I do - I know they've gotten to you When you say that your whites
Have an aerial blue
What's happened to you - since I last say you I thought I knew your name - but it's not you but it's not you

You're talking in a balloon
In this tidy room
Sounding like a commercial
For a serial
I wish you could feel the way that I feel I wish you could feel but your so unreal your so unreal

What can I say - what can I say
All the traits you had have all gone away get up and wash at the right time of day and greet the world with the right thing to say

You're so ideal - you're never down at heel you're so ideal - but you're so unreal
I wish you could feel - the way that I feel I wish you could feel - but you're so unreal you're so unreal
