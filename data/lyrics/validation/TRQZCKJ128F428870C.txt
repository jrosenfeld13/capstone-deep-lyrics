Lisa had me thinkin she was the only one for me
And Nikki had those angel eyes that changed my mind
The day she looked at me
Then outta nowhere you came walking in my life
You really blew my mind
Now I don't care about those other girls
It's only u I need in my world baby....

Excuse me my cutie
Tell me could u be the kinda shorty just for me
My everlasting meant to be
(oh girl) oh girl
From the moment I saw u (My heart starts racing)
And I can't let u walk away
So won't you tell me girl (girl)
Could u the kinda cutie that I need
My one my destiny
Lil lady tell me could u be

Not sayin Trina wasn't cool
But u changed my point of view
Chantel was nice sweet and everythang
But nothin compares to u (yeaah)
U stole my heart and I'm torn apart
I don't wanna cause the pain
Girl I would gladly throw it all away
For what I found in u today

Excuse me, my cutie (cutie uh-uh)

You see I've been a playa
But I'm tired of playin
Been waitin for a love like u

You came into my life and I feel so brand new (so brand new)
I'm so thankful for u girl I swear
