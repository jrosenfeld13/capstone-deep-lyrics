Bands come and go
They lack life
In a year they are gone
They lack grace
They're one hit wonder
They lack passion
It's a dead, worthless thing
Hey hey hey grace face labor
Wa ooh ooh music born of hardship
Hey hey hey born of our soul
Don't try to understand it, you never will
It's in our hearts, the music we feel
HEART BLEEDS BLACK, we're poor at income
HEART BLEEDS BLACK, but rich with pride
HEART BLEEDS BLACK, i might be sad and angry
TOGETHER WE HAVE HOPE UNTIL THE END
We're on the road in a filthy car
Crusted with sweat
We travel to the end of each highway
I'm opening up music, music to the ugly
How else can you get, get to the vine
Except through the guts, the gut of man
Not in the body, or through the skin
But the guts, where u feel it within
HEART BLEEDS BLACK, we're poor at income
HEART BLEEDS BLACK, but rich with pride
HEART BLEEDS BLACK, i might be sad and angry
TOGETHER WE HAVE HOPE UNTIL THE END
Meet some strangers along the way
Have a few laughs,maybe a drink
Tomorrow i'll do it again
I never stay in one place
Plenty of time to think
Consider what i've done
Do we do it for a reputation?
No We Do It Cause It's In Our Blood!
HEART BLEEDS BLACK, we're poor at income
HEART BLEEDS BLACK, but rich with pride
HEART BLEEDS BLACK, i might be sad and angry
WE SURVIVE, FIGHTING ON
