You are you and I am I
I do my thing and you do yours
I am not in this world to live up to your expectations
And you are not in this world to live up to mine
You say life is hard
I say compared to what
You should love this life, no matter what. x2
I'm opposed to back bitters
Oh how powerless I am
But if you offered me the position how dangerous it could be
You have double dealt your way to this seat
