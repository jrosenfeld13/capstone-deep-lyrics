Yeah

I won't last long
Soon I'll be gone
I won't last long
Soon I'll be gone

It's all the same to me
There's nothing to see
It's all the same to me

I feel so weak
I won't last long
I feel so weak
Weak in the world

It's all the same to me
There's nothing to see
It's all the same to me
I'm not made to last
I'm not made to last
I will soon be gone
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

I won't last long
Soon I'll be gone
I won't last long

I'll be gone

There's nothing for me to be
What will happen to me
What will happen to me
Although I'll soon be gone
I'll still think of you
Oh I'll think of you
And I will soon be gone
