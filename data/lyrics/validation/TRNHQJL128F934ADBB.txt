(Music: Nelson)

Looks in the mirror, thinks he knows what he sees
Hides the truth from himself
Not from you or me, check it

Acts like a dog, always take the easy way
You can't live forever without responsibility

Always in the action
And he knows which ways to go
The best way to break him is to break down his road

(Chorus:)
Feel the blade, he's living a lie
Feel the blade, he's wondering why
Feel the blade, why can't he see
That he'll feel the blade from me

His dreams have been ended, cut him down to size
His dreams have been ended, maybe he'll realize

He thought he'd live forever, for all eternity
He can't lead anything, nothing comes for free

(Repeat chorus)

(Repeat chorus)
Feel the Blade
