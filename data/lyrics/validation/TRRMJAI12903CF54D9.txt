I don't trust the government
I don't trust alternatives
It's not that I'm paranoid
It's just thats the way it is

Everyday I hear a little scream inside
Everyday I find it's getting louder
I just want to reach out and touch someone
'Cause I find I need a friend in this dark hour

We the people are getting tired of your lies
We the people now believe that it's time
We're demanding our rights to the answers
We elect a precedent to a state of mind

I trust in conspiracy
In the power of the military
In this wilderness of mirrors here
Not even my speech is free

Everyday I hear a little scream inside
Everyday I find it's getting louder
I just want to reach out and touch someone
'Cause I find I need a friend in this dark hour

We the people want it straight for a change
'Cause we the people are getting tired of your games
If you insult us with cheap propaganda
We'll elect a precedent to a state of mind

Everyday I hear a little scream inside
Everyday I find it's getting louder
I just want to reach out and touch someone
'Cause I find we need a friend in this dark hour

When we the people have our backs to the wall
Do we the people then assume control?
When it's too late to stop our own execution

When we're faced with the final solution
You can't elect a dream revolution
When you've a bullet in the back of your mind

It's just a state of mind

I hear a little scream inside
