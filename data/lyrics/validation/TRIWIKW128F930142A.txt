Imagine the surprise, we finally let him know
He has the Devil's eyes, and that's unhealable
In between mean shadows

Sit back, relax, let your mind flow
Forget your worries, all your troubles, let the free now, let them go
In no time you'll be haunted by my words
In no time you'll be stoned like two dead birds

You know I am all you need
Bound to the top of your family tree
And I'll be there everyday
So kick and scream if you feel better, but you'll never get away

You're gonna be surprised, well I've got to let you know
You've got the Devil's eyes, now you're casting out his shadow

Sit back, relax, enjoy the show
Why you rushing? What's your hurry? You've got nowhere to go
Just focus on the sound of my voice
No you ain't buying hocus pocus, but I ain't selling you no choice

And you know I am all you need
Bound to the top of your family tree
And I'll be there everyday
So kick and scream if you feel better, but you'll never get away

Don't you turn out the light, don't plan on shutting my eyes
Don't you turn out the light, some things go bump in the night
Afraid of my shadow, afraid of my shadow
