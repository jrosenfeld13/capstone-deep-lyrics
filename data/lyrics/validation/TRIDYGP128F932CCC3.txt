Shattering every part of me, I can't believe what I'm hearing
Her leave from sorrow has left me standing: alone, desperate the hours commence
I know the angels brush her face as I stand here in circle of confusion
Tell me everything, I see suffering
Pain, she lived in pain
Safe, she was not safe
Breathe, I could not breathe, dawn the darkest dawn
Lost (forever)
In my heart forever, in my thoughts forever
Lost control, things just aren't the same
The change, has left me shaking
Everything in life has to say goodbye, everything in life has to end sometime
All I know is what you've taught me to be: this dream won't fad I'll keep it alive with your memory
Right now, feel this (pressure)
Use your (mind)
Fuck the (cause)
Have no (fear)
Beyond this there's nothing else: feel the waves come crashing back
Beyond this there's nothing else: sand at her feet now turns to black
Silenced for eternity: you live through me
