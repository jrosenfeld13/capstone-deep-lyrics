Might is a magnet
And everyone dreams of it
And if they have it
They just try not to lose it

With all your might
You impose your will
You don't like the persons
Who put obstructions in your way

I see you
Your eyes so blind
Corruptive is the hate
And you try find
The sense of might
To understand its your site
There's nothing to ignore
So I look down to your abattoir

Blow your problems away
Look at the decay

Blow your problems away
Look at the decay

Do you really understand
What do you hold in your big hand
And do understand
How rapid you will close your hand
It's easy to resist your might
I just will look around
I feel like throwing up
I feel like throwing up

I see you
Your eyes so blind
Corruptive is the hate
And you try find
The sense of might
To understand its your site
There's nothing to ignore
So I look down to your abattoir

Abattoir
