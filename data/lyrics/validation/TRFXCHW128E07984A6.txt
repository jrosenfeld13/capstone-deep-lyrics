Look at the hottie in the tight jeans
Look at the pipe dreams
Look at the fat man burst at the seams
Look at the captain with the galaxy, right off his balcony
Look at the science and the alchemy
Look at the sirens on the cop cars
Look at the pop stars
Look at the convicts filing the bars
Look at the wife
Look at the knife
Look at the pom-pom prom queen scream and scream and run for her life

Oh, it's always right, the perfect light in the dark of night
Give up the world, give up your life, 'cause you cannot fight the television
Oh, woo-oo-oo
The television, television
Oh, woo-oo-oo
The television!

Look at them trying to get the flag higher
Look at the quagmire
Look at the tread separate from the tire
Look at the junky trying to get a gram
Look at the betting man
Look at him folding on a better hand

Oh, it's always right, the fearless light in the dark of night
Give up the world, give up your life, 'cause you cannot fight the television
Oh, woo-oo-oo
The television, television
Oh, woo-oo-oo
Oh, the television!

Look at me hypnotized and half alive, maybe it's four or five
Some parts are sleeping, some parts are paralyzed
Just one more minute, just one more minute, I think I'm almost in it
The television, television
Oh, woo-oo-oo
The television, television
Oh, woo-oo-oo

Oh, give me tits and politicians (television, television)
Oh, woo-oo-oo
Oh, give me death and demolition (television, television)
Oh, woo-oo-oo
Oh, give me glamour and sedition (television, television)
Oh, oh, woo-oo-oo
Oh, woo-oo-oo
The television!
