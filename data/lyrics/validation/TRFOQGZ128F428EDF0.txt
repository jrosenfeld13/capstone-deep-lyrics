She got those watchpocket blues

She cried like mary at the manger

Ain't got time to lose

No... dont care if im right

Baby im just dying all the time

Be born again

I'll fall and rise

I can't help it

No... can't help it

Send me back to heaven

Or are cuffs still on my brain?

Prising through bad vision

I stagger from the pain

Help me make it easy coming down

Help me make it easy with the sound

Sound of voices raises celebration

Dont you stop my speed to salvation

Second hand is running

Got me running out to sea

Changes shape but tomorrow be coming back again

Help me make it easy coming down

Help me make easy with the sound

Sound of voices raises celebration

Try to stop my speed to salvation

You've loved the dark before the summer

You've loved the ocean that your under

You've loved the storm before the thunder

But you know that your shadow still remains

Send me back to heaven

Or are cuffs still on my brain?

Prising through bad vision

I stagger from the pain

Come and make it easy coming down

Come and make it easy with the sound

The sound of voices raises celabration

Dont you stop my speed to salvation

She got them watchpocket blues

She cried like mary at the manger

Couldn't help but lose

She cried like jesus on the main line

Couldn't help but lose... and right
