I don't know why you ask me questions
I'm trapped inside my mind
There's no time here, no color
Oh please give me a sign

Don't you tell me where I'm going
Don't you tell me where I've been
In this world of mass destruction
I hold a higher ground

Don't you tell me that I've fallen
Don't you tell me to turn around
In this world of mass confusion
I hold a higher ground

Every aspect of myself is people
Who are fearing for my life
And if you try to kill them
I might just take a day

Can't get the hang of this lucid dream life x3
I think a nightmare better fix the girl

In this world of mass confusion
I hold a higher ground
