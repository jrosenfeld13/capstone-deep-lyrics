[Chorus:]
Angel
Baby, you make my dreams come true
Angel
Spend my whole life pleasing you

Angel
Baby, you are the one for me
Angel
Come and set my loving free

[Verse 1:]
Baby, you are the best thing in my life
You know you're sweeter than sugar and spice
Baby, you are for me
You know, a dream come true
I want to spend my whole life loving only you

There are so many things
That we can do
Just give me a chance to (move it all to) you

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
Every day, girl
When I come home from school
I can hardly wait to talk to you

Nobody can ever take your love from me
I really love you, girl
And that's the way it's got to be

There are so many places
We can go
Let's see a movie at the picture show

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]

[Spoken:]
Yo!
Is everybody here?
Yeah!

Jon?
I'm here!
Donnie and Danny?
We're here!
Jordan and Joe?
I'm here
And I'm here!

Since everybody's here
Let's tell 'em what angel means!
Word up!

A!! It means I'm always gonna love you
N!! I'm never gonna leave you
G!! It's for your good, good loving
E!! It's for your everlasting love
L is 'cause I love you
Really, really love you

[Repeat Chorus:]
