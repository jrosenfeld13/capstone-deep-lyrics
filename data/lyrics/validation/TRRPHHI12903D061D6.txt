[Chorus, 3x]
In the happyland

[1. Verse]
Poison my sight while you kiss me goodnight
In the happyland (in the happyland)
Go on and poison my sight while you kiss me goodnight
In the happyland (in the happyland)
Well your daddy left home
Mum is still on the phone
Lost belief in
Love's deceiving
Always going, went, gone
Poison my sight while you kiss me goodnight
In the happyland (in the happyland)

[1. Bridge]
Close the door and leave your key
You think you've got me but you'll see
When you're starting to lose me
I'm already gone

[Chorus, 2x]

[2. Verse]
Night lingers on, we'll be safe until dawn
In the happyland (in the happyland)
As the night lingers on, we'll be safe until dawn
In the happyland (in the happyland)
Cause your daddy left home
Mum is still on the phone
Lost belief in
Love's deceiving
Always going, went, gone
Night lingers on, we'll be safe until dawn
In the happyland (in the happyland)

[1. Bridge]

[Chorus, 2x]

[2. Bridge]
They will hurt you
And desert you
That's what they do
Run

[Chorus, 4x]
