Everyone is happy in your favorite dream
It's a pleasant surprise with all your favorite scenes
Just like a beautiful day without a cloud in the sky
And the only thing to blind you is the sun in your eyes

When your body's asleep all your thoughts are awake
Traveling through stories that your mind likes to make
Take a look around,enjoy what you feel
Is it just imagination or is everything real

Don't wake me up i want to dream
Don't wake me up i want to dream
I want this dream to last forever
Don't wake me up i want to dream
I want this dream to last forever
Don't wake me up

The skies are getting cloudy there's a storm on the way
The vision's disappearing in a strange kind of way
The perfect little picture that you paint in your head
Is a distant memory when you get out of bed

Don't wake me up i want to dream
Don't wake me up i want to dream
I want this dream to last forever
Don't wake me up i want to dream
I want this dream to last forever
Don't wake me up before I understand what everything means
Why does somebody always come and wake me up from my dreams
Chorus
