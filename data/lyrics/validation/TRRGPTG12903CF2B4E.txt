Atari Teenage Riot

He's been under medication and heavy sedation
Since Kula Shaker came along
'Cos he couldn't believe everyone in the world
Liked their songs

He made a bouncing bomb from his chemistry set
And he left it in the hall of the band's soundcheck

But now things are better, the birds are singing
And the sky is summer-blue
He's got Atari Teenage Riot on his music centre
In a home with a beautiful view
I know he's getting better cos he's getting excited
Telling everyone he hates Man United

Baby I love you
Baby I love you
Baby I love you
Baby I love you
Does your heart go boom
Does your heart go boom
Does your heart, does your heart, does your heart go boom
Baby I love you
You make my heart go boom

He's been under medication and under sedation
Since Bush came speeding along
'Cos he couldn't believe how those long-haired boys
Could make those up-tempo, toe-tapping, happy songs

He got a tank from the pages of the Western Mail
That he fired at the stage every time they played

But now things are better, the birds are singing
And the sky is summer-blue
He's got Atari Teenage Riot on his music center
In a home with a beautiful view
I know he's getting better cos he's getting excited
He's the number one star and I think he's delighted

Baby I love you
Baby I love you
Baby I love you
Baby I love you
Does your heart go boom
Does your heart go boom
Does your heart, does your heart, does your heart go boom
Baby I love you
