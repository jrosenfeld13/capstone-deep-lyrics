A uniform a labor force
A transformation will take by storm
It's invading a transformation
That generates hatred
You want the lion's share
You're not the exception
You're pointing finger in every direction
Stop complaining. i'm not being paid to listen
I'm sick of your droning voice
Start taking the blame for your conscious choices
