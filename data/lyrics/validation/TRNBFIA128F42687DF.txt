Your love is killing me, it draws me to the dark
Your veil of ecstasy, that leaves the telling mark
The spell you cast inside, is stabbing through my heart
It reaches deep within, it's pulling me apart

Night fall, you take my soul
Night fall, you're in control

Your love's still haunting me, it draws me into black
Your veil of fantasy, won't let my soul come back
The spell has taken all, I can't release my mind
I've lost my heart to you, you're too cruel to be kind

Night fall, you take my soul
Night fall, you're in control
Night fall, I called you and you came
Night fall, I'll never be the same

Night fall, you take my soul
Night fall, you're in control
Night fall, I called you and you came
Night fall, I'll never be the same
