Uncriticizable you
Unadorned, therefore not poorly adorned

We're fighting smiling irish, they say that we
Look good in uniform, and mais oui!
So good you couldn't pry the cold dead fingers
Of the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders free
We're action at a distance, we're forces
They say we're cute when we're mad, and we are!
So cute there's not an animation product in Japan
We don't outsparkle by far

Don't try to tell me we weren't inches away
From turning the tables and using what used you and me
Courtney, such little nonbelievers, aren't we?
Courtney, are you sure all your problems were me?
Courtney, I think we missed our chance to be free

You're finding focus now, your big project is
Finding the perfect way to leave me
And everybody needs their own big project
Time that's set aside for something stress-free

Will you be eating ice cream three meals a day?
Will tango music play? Will he be better than me?
Courtney, such little nonbelievers, aren't we?
Courtney, are you sure all your problems were me?
Courtney, I think we missed our chance to be free
