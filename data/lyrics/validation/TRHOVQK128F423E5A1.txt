Behind the mountains where the Cuckoo sings
They tried to mine a miner for his golden veins
But a guy gets lonely and a guy gets sick
Evil woman you're bound to make a mess of it

She laid me down in her golden sheets
Lord save me, Lord I was knee deep
Well a hundred soldiers and a thousand men
Couldn't drag me down but I'm back on my knees again

Wanna leave, wanna go
That woman is a devil yes I know

But I know more than you think I do
You got a hole in your face where I can see through you
Well holy me, you've got devils in your sleeves
With the bull in your court you're bound
To make a mess of me

Wanna leave, wanna go
That woman is a devil yes I know
