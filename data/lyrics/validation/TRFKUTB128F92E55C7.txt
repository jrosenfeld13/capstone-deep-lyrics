They made speeches preparations unavoidable the day
When a future great eradicator comes
Biding silently the tidings as there's little left to say
Little time, little minds, little ones

Hear the echoes of a nightmare close their minds to the decay
Sifting through the languid rapture dreams of some
Just a universal blinking repetition has its say
Little time, little minds, little ones

There's a writhing beauty once the ego's cast away
Once disposed nulls the throes supposed by they
Like the roach we encroach upon the means by which we stay
No surprise the wiser never pray

And the queens still give their orders and the soldiers still obey
Spreading forth to every corner 'neath the sun
Do they know their procreation self-exterminates their ways
Little time, little minds, little ones

There's a writhing beauty once the ego's cast away
Once disposed nulls the throes supposed by they
Like the roach we encroach upon the means by which we stay
No surprise the wiser never pray

And the queens still give their orders and the soldiers still obey
Spreading forth to every corner 'neath the sun
Do they know their procreation self-exterminates their ways
Little time, little minds, little ones
