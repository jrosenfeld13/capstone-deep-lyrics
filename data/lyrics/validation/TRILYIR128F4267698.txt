Choosing my words carefully has never been my strength
I've been known to be vague and often pointless
But you sure as shit know me better than anybody else
And for that in my heart I am hopeful

So I helped you pack your bags and I folded up your snap shirts
And when you come back it will already be the winter
If you look at other girls working out in the nighttime
I don't mind but I don't want to know

And these years that I have known you, it's gone and blurred my sense of time
Now I can hardly even recall what came before this
Letters left on pillows, messages left on phones
And the postcards in the mail when we sent them
Cobwebs all collected, paintings on the walls
Lounging around all day in a hot pink chenille housecoat
And the secrets that I whispered in your ear while you were sleeping
You can call to mind when you're out in the world without me

Oh the denim king
Oh the denim king
And I sure as shit do love you
And I cuss because I mean it
And for that in my heart I am hopeful
And these words that I chose, I was so careful
