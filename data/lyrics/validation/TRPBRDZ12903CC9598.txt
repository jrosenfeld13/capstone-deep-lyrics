You told me
That you would love me forever
N' you told me
That you couldn't love anyone else

So you left me
To study in the country
Now I find
That you're just studying
Somebody else

N' for once in my life
I was loyal
For once in my life
I was strong
For once in my life
I was honest baby
N' for once in my life
I was wrong

But I'm not
I am not gonna try to save you
N' I'm not
I am not gonna try to change you
If she is how you really want
You'd better let me know
'Cause my emotions
They are starting to get out of control

N' for once in my life
I was loyal
For once in my life
I was strong
For once in my life
I was honest baby
N' for the first time in my life
I was wrong. I was wrong. I was wrong

But you see
You told me
That you would love me forever
N' you told me
That you couldn't love anyone else

So you left me
To study in Pennsylvania
N' now I find
That you are just studying
Somebody else

Yeah, now I find that you are just
You're just studying somebody else
I am left
Just studying myself
