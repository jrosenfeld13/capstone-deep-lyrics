Since the day I turned 15 I've been
Standing on my own
Never tried no suicide standing on my own
Everyday I'm moving forward even
Though it seems a little bit awkward
Lost myself a thousand times I found
My way home I found my way home
Standing on my own with no help from you!
Since I lost my innocence I've been
Standing on my own
No time to reminisce standing on my own
Everyday I seem to mess up even
Though I think it's real bad luck
Lost myself a thousand times I found my way home
Standing on my own with no help from you!

Since the day I turned 15 I've been
Standing on my own
Never tried no suicide standing on my own
I learned to live I learned to live I've
Been standing on my own
I learned to fight I'll learn to die
Standing on my own
Standing on my own with no help from you!
