I walk down my old street, Used to be home for me
And
Now theres spraypaint on the walls
I see a house that at one time looked nice but now it is
Abandoned
Theres nothing left at all
So why-y-y must we let our chances fly
And when oh when oh when will we ever
See hope again
And why-y-y is it so hard to say goodbye
Oh well oh well at least i can
Still remember when our
City used to be such a beautiful place
But now you can't walk down the street and think youll see the same
My hands are in the air
It makes no sense to me
And i
Cannot
Explain this tragedy...

My first trip to the city, yeah, i remember thinking
That those buildings stood so tall
But now i see that my old stomping ground has just been ravaged
They seem now rather small
So why-y-y must we let our chances fly
And when oh when oh when will we ever
See hope again
Why-y-y is it so hard to say goodbye
Oh well oh well at least i can
Still remember when our
City used to be such a beautiful place
But now you can't walk down the street and think youll see the same
My hands are in the air
It makes no sense to me
And i
Cannot
Explain this tragedy...
-
Feels like im living in someone elses dream
Nothing seems as if its the way that should be
Its like a dark cloud swallowed up in humanity
Whatever it is, its beyond me
-
Homesickness is the flu that surrounds me
A virus spreading through the street, it astounds me
Homesickness-
-
Our City used to be such a beautiful place
But now you can't walk down the street and think youll see the same
My hands are in the air
It makes no sense to me
And i
Cannot
Explain this tragedy...
