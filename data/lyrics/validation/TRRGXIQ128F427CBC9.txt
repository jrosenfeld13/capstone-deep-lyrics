I heard the sirens blare
I saw the warning lights
So lover you're the one that pulled the trigger
Ain't that a thing?
Well this is red alert
And I don't mind saying I'm scared
Cause I could try and try and never really feel prepared

It's only for the things that matter
Only for the things that really count
I wouldn't have it any other way

So now you're talking again
I simply don't want to know
Life is too surprising as it is
I ain't no boyfriend
I got me these magical properties
I got three spells to cast, and intend to make them last

It's only for the things that matter
Only for the things that really count
I wouldn't have it any other way
Only for the things that matter
Only for the things that really count
I wouldn't have it any other way

YEAH

So now you're crying again
It's not your most attractive state
I really wonder what I'm doing here with you
But whatever cause this is playing with wire
My heart broke down entire
And lets be honest yeah
They don't stay broken all that long

I wouldn't have it any other way
Only for the things that matter
Only for the things that really count
I wouldn't have it any other way
I wouldn't have it any other way
I wouldn't have it anyway
