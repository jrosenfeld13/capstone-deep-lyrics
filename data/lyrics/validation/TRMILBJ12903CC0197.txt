Oh, you look so hungry, woman
How come you strayed in here
With your eyes so bright
On this long hot night

Could it be for a taste of my love

Down on your knees
With your face to the wall
Saying please, please, please
My friend said I should call

Well, I do feel lonely, woman
And to tell the truth
I could use some company
So come closer to me

Help yourself to a taste of my love

Call up room service
Order peaches and cream
I like my dessert first
If you know what I mean

Yeah, taste it, taste it, taste it
Around the maze of pleasure
To the gates of pain
You're driving me insane

Take all you need from the taste of my love

I want to love you
Like nobody ever loved you
Get on my stallion
And we'll ride

I want to hold you
And enfold you beyond reason
I want to dynamite your mind
With love tonight

Go down gently
With your face to the east
The sun may be rising
But we haven't finished the beast

Ooh, you still look hungry, woman
I'm glad your came in here
With your eyes so bright
On this long hot night

Ooh, you need love, I need love
Here it comes, the taste of my love

I'm gonna love you
Like nobody ever loved you
Climb on my rocket
And we'll fly

Over the moon
Past the sun 'til we find
The gates of heaven
Open wide for lovers

I'm gonna love you
Like nobody ever loved you
Climb on my rocket
And we'll fly
