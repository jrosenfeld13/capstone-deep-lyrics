Yo, what's up baby?
I can't even believe I'm bout to tell you this
But it's like every since I've been with you things you know, just been changing
Parts of me have been dying
I just wanna tell you about it

[Verse 1:]
Lately I feel like I've been slippin
And it's you that got me trippin
I can't control myself when I'm around you, oh
With any other I would've been done
Love to left the next one
But I just can't shake you off

[Pre-Chorus:]
Cuz you got it all girl
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
The body of a call girl
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
With a mind of a teacher
(Yeah, yeah)
That's why I need ya
(Yeah, yeah)
I gotta let you know

[Chorus:]
Girl, the pimp in me just died
(Died)
Died
(Died)
Died
When I look into your eyes
(Eyes)
Your eyes
(Eyes)
Your eyes
(You don't know how hard I tried)
Mature you
Not chill with you
Not to mess with you no more
Girl, the pimp in me just died
(Died)
It died
(It died)
Died, oh

[Verse 2:]
It ain't no use in me faking
Here goes my heart girl, take it
Do what you wanna do but please don't play me out
Just understand what you have got here
I'm the realist you gone find here
I know you hear this all the time
My wearing my heart, it's on the line

[Pre-Chorus:]
Cuz you got it all girl
The body of a call girl. (Ohh)
With a mind of a teacher. (Teacher)
That's why I need ya. (Need ya)
I gotta let you know. (I gotta let you know baby)

[Chorus:]
Girl, the pimp in me just died. (Hey)
(Died)
It died
(Died)
Said it died baby
When I look into your eyes
(Eyes)
Your eyes
(Eyes)
Said your eyes
(You don't know how hard I tried)
Mature you
Not to chill with you
Not to mess with you no more
Girl, the pimp in me just died
(Died)
Said it died baby
(It died)
Hey, oh

[Bridge:]
Baby I'm ready. (Ready)
To give up the game, can't play no more. (No more)
Do you think you ready? (Ohh)
Don't you say yes unless you're sure
Many have tried to bring me down. (Baby)
But I'm choosing you girl. (But I'm choosing you girl)
To ride with forever, that's a long time. (That's a long time, baby)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus:]
Girl, the pimp in me just died. (Girl, the pimp in me just died)
(Died)
Died. (Ohhhh)
(Died)
Died
When I look into your eyes
(Eyes) (Oh baby)

See you don't know how hard I tried to stay away, no no
Girl, the pimp in me just died
