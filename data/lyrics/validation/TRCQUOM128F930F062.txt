Silent rain is falling, mother's tears fill my veins
See the face of sorrow, stare into the rising sun
We all know it's over, like a song's last refrain
There is no tomorrow 'cause the sun has fallen down

Palace walls are burning, children's cries light the sky
You can taste the sorrow, where one was the rising sun
Angel's wings are broken and the pearl turns to dust
Waiting for tomorrow, will the sun rise again?

Heavy rain falls again, and our days of glory wash away
Hurricane blowing strong
Through the eyes of madness wash away

In the howling rain, thunder echoes our shame
In the howling rain, silence all sounds the same
In the howling rain

Hell black ground, all around, all around, all over me
All the sound, coming down, coming down, all over me
Try to stay awake, watching spirits break
Nowhere, nowhere left to fall

Hearing distant sighs, pantomime cries
Too late, feel the fire, fear the rain
Free the storm, feel the tears
Fear the wind, free the hope
Feel the love, every sin

In the howling rain, thunder echoes our shame
In the howling rain, silence all sounds the same
In the howling rain, nothing can be the same
In the howling rain, howling rain
In the howling rain
