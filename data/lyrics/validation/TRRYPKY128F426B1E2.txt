There's no trust. Not anymore
This time you've gone too far
So step aside. Out of my life
Take your troubles out the door

Please, get out, get lost. You've hurt me one last time
I've had enough, the deal is off
But you should know that I believed and loved you all along
Please leave while I'm still strong

Don't deny. Don't even try
There's nothing more to say
I can't forgive the things you did
Pack your bag and go away

Please get out, get lost. You've hurt me one last time
I've had enough, the deal is off
But you should know that I believed and loved you all along
Please leave while I'm still strong (3x)
