If the path of least resistance is all you ever take
Well at least you've been consistent and for that I baked you a cake

Recognize this as a dream, wake up and write it down
From thought to actions an eternity I can't get this thing off the ground

Author unknown

So spell me out your proverb and ink it with your soul
And I'll count down all the reasons you lost complete control

Brutalize me with beauty, don't ever let me down
Suspended on this stage of grace I have to remember this sound

Author unknown, author unknown...

Author unknown remember this sound
She's unknown. He's unknown. I'm unknown. We're all unknown
