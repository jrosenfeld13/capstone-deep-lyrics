Show me where the grass is green
Take me to your favorite colored field
They had to watch you grow
'cause you always knew which way to go

Down by the oceanside
Down where the ocean waves goodbye
You were the seventh one
Things they always seem to be undone
When you turn away
When you turn away
When we are all for sale...

I thought you had it all
Did you see my writings on the wall?
You're not the one to trust
And my expectation starts to rust
When you turn away
When you turn away
When we are all for sale...

Let it turn away
Let it turn away
'cause we are all for sale
Yes we are all for sale...
