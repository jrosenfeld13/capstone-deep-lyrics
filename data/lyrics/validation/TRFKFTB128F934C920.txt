Our father who art in Hell
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom is come
Thy will is done
On earth as it is in Hell

We take this night our rightful due
And trespass not on the path of He
Lead us unto temptation
And deliver us from false piety

For thine is the Kingdom
And the Power
And the Glory
Forever

Shemhamforash!
