[Intro]
Malinda
Malinda

[Verse 1]
Malinda's the girl (girl)
Who came to my world
And made my interest in all other girls stop
Malinda's a dream (dream)
Beauty to the extreme
Malinda is the cream of the crop

[Refrain]
So many guys in love with my Malinda (they can't get her)
You ought to see the presents others send her
Trying to make her surrender
Surrender them some of that tender
Love she's giving me (Malinda)

[Verse 2]
Oh, but she doesn't know
She'll never go
She's where she'd rather be
In the arms of a man who fits in her plan (fits into her plan)
She lets them know that man is me
So many guys have tried for my Malinda (but they can't get her)
From the Casanovas to the real big spenders
But all they do is offend her
Offend Malinda and send her

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Calling out to me in a lover's speed
"Love me tenderly"

[Chorus 1]
(Malinda) oh
(Malinda, I love Malinda)
I love Malinda
(Yeah, Malinda Malinda)
(I love Malinda)
Ooh, I love that girl (yeah)

[Verse 3]
Ain't gonna let no
Jill or Jane or Brenda
(Any one of those girls)
Come between me and my Malinda
I'll never let another girl hinder
The chance that Malinda's gonna

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Spend her every night and day
Satisfy this day
In love with me this way

[Chorus 2]
(Malinda, Malinda, I love Malinda)
Oh, she only has eyes for me (yeah)
(Malinda, Malinda, I love Malinda)
Yeah, she gives up all the
Other guys for me (yeah)
(Malinda, Malinda, I love Malinda)
She is mine, all mine
That's the way it was meant to be
