What a fucking lovely day
Everything has gone my way
All my flags are unfurled
I'm the king of the world
And to think, it's only May!

It's my favourite time of year
For a spree of crime and fear
It's a joy just to breathe
And to scheme, and to seethe
What a fucking lovely day!

La la la la, la la la
La la la la la la la

Ah, the smell of despair
Is that blood in my hair?
I don't care, I don't care
What a fucking lovely day!

Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh...
