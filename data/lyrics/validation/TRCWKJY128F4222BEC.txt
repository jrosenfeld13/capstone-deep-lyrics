Oh those girls just wanted to play
All in one body, they drive me insane
Never encountered a love so cold
Over and over and over they go
I couldn't take her screaming like that
Six tortured souls in one body trapped
They fight to control the tought of one brain
Blood-thirsty kin one in the game
Six stepsisters play the game
Two in the night, two by day
One says she loves me, one wants to kill me
I've never felt a feeling like that
The sex is so dirty, I like it like that
Three at one time, one's on the floor
The two that are lovers they always want more
I couldn't take her screaming like that
Six tortured souls in one body trapped
Blood-thirsty kin one in the same
Lying there bleeding, calling my name
Six stepsisters play the game
Two in the night, two by day
One says she loves me, one wants to kill me
The things we've done --- Six times the fun
I couldn't take her screaming like that
Six tortured souls in one body trapped
They fight to control the tought of one brain
Blood-thirsty kin one in the game
Six stepsisters play the game
Two in the night, two by day
One says she loves me, one wants to kill me
Six sick little sisters all in one brain
Oh it ain't so bad!
