Dare ya draw me closer still
And let me be the wild witness to the kill
See how the stars abide
Showing no resistance
Late into the night
Bluer than the winter wind that howls
On a sleepless lake
Me, I'm under no duress
Offering my throat before a hungry lioness
Hear how the jungle whines
And beats a violent drum along
With these blues of mine
Bluer than the winter wind that howls
On a sleepless lake
Where the light and shadows bend
I walk your silent haunts
Along the Michigan
Grief, banished by the glow
Electric dying autumn
Has a color all of its own
Bluer than the winter wind that howls
On a sleepless lake
