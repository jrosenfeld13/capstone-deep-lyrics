Smile an everlasting smile, a smile can bring you
Near to me
Don't ever let me find you down, cause that would
Bring a tear to me
This world has lost its glory, let's start a brand new story now, my love
Right now, there'll be no other time and I can show
You how, my love
Talk in everlasting words, and dedicate them all to me
And I will give you all my life, I'm here if you
Should call to me
You think that I dont even mean a single word I say
It's only words, and words are all I have, to take
Your heart away
