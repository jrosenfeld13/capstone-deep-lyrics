When you're in a dream
The time passes so slowly
When you're in a dream
The time passes so slowly

Open up your heart
Go sleep on the moment you were born
Open up your heart
Go sleep on the moment love was born

Love for you and me
Let be all the love within you tonight
Love for you and me
Set free all the love within you tonight

Open up your mind
Go sleep on the moment you were born
And open up your mind
Go sleep on the moment time was born
