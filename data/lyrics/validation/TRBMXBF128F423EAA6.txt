You got lost
Now you're scared
Because if you pay the cost
You won't be here
Dream of the eternal life
Where you're from
Riddled with the will to survive
Everyone
And now you don't believe
Freedom's coming
Because you've been deceived
And you still keep running
Dream of the eternal life
Where you're from
Riddled with the will to survive
Everyone
Dream of the eternal life
Where you're from
Riddled with the will to survive
Everyone
