Too late baby

I will no longer try
To live this compromise
You know that I've had my fill
I'm not here to please you

Still no matter what you say
Nothing you can do will make me stay
Still no matter what you do
Now you know that I'm through with you

'Cause I've weathered storms you've put me through
And now I've turned to walk away and leave this all behind

'Cause every time we try to work it out
Nothing was changed, things stay the same
This time, I don't wanna talk it over
'Cause it's too late baby, too late baby

Time for you to realize
I will not play the fool that cries
You don't seem to understand
That I don't want you as my man

I gave you just half a chance
Knowing that we would never last
I gave you all that I could
Now I see that I never should

'Cause I've weathered storms you've put me through
And now I've turned to walk away and leave this all behind

'Cause every time we try to work it out
Nothing was changed, things stay the same
This time, I don't wanna talk it over
'Cause it's too late baby, now it's too late

'Cause every time we try to work it out
Nothing was changed, things stay the same
This time I don't wanna talk it over
'Cause it's too late baby, too late baby

Ooh
Ooh

I can't stay here any longer
And watch as my heart breaks
'Cause baby now I'm even stronger
'Cause its too late baby, now its too late

I can't stay here any longer
And watch as my heart breaks
'Cause baby now I'm even stronger
'Cause its too late, too late, you're too late

'Cause every time we try to work it out
Nothing was changed, things stay the same
This time I don't wanna talk it over
'Cause it's too late baby, now its too late

'Cause every time we try to work it out
Nothing was changed, things stay the same
This time I don't wanna talk it over
'Cause it's too late baby, too late baby
