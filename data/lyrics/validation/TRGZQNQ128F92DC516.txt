Out back in Virginia
Crazy man played guitar with a cross-eyed mind
He said his music was like the wind
It'd come to him and go again
And I had a feeling the man he wasn't lying
Bottle of liquor by his side
A constant reminder of a man who dies
Cause he had done is living for so darn long
Pain of truth carved on his face
A monument to a fallen grace
But the words he said
Boy they hit me strong
CHORUS
Only one thing you got to learn
Only one thing you got to learn
If you run with the devil, you gonna' burn
Outside Birmingham
Young boy want to be a man
He met a woman
Who scared his young bones home
She watched him as he walked away
Thinking on her younger days
Thinking on how something right
Could be so wrong
Abused child barely sixteen
Accustomed to the death of dreams
She would hurt her father by making love to other men
Blessed with a body she used like a tool
She made all men paying fools
But at night they say her crying would never end
CHORUS
Midnight on a Mississippi road
A young boy with a tortured soul
Called out to the night
Would you set me free?
Devil come by and shook his hand
Said Son, you gonna be my man
But from this night on your soul belongs to me
People come from near and far
To hear him sing and play guitar
He was making money, making music, making women with style
A Louisiana woman toting a knife
Early one morning, she took his life
Before he died he saw the devil smile
CHORUS
