[Intro]
I'm your F. A. N

[Verse 1]
Ah
An era of information
Ah, oh
When no one seems to know whats going on
Close to you, my aspiration
Dumb me down for stage invasion
Misplace your faces
This close is just close enough

[Chorus]
I'm your F.A.N. M.A.N
I'm your F.A.N. M.A.N
I'm your F.A.N. M.A.N
I'm your M.A.N
I'm your F.A.N

[Verse 2]
Ah
Is all you want adoration?
Ah, oh
The only word you long to hear now is love
Life's a seesaw you've forgotten
How the top becomes the bottom
In time you'll find out
This face is just phase enough

[Chorus]
I'm your F.A.N. M.A.N
I'm your F.A.N. M.A.N
I'm your F.A.N. M.A.N
I'm your M.A.N
I'm your F.A.N

[Bridge]
You say that you need something
But really you need nothing
You're really going crazy, run
You're really going crazy, run

[Chorus]
I'm your F.A.N. M.A.N
I'm your F.A.N. M.A.N
I'm your F.A.N. M.A.N
I'm your M.A.N
I'm your F.A.N

[Outro]
F.A.N. M.A.N
I'm your F.A.N. M.A.N
I'm your F.A.N. M.A.N
M.A.N
I'm your
