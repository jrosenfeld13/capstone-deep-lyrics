The first time you take a drink
It makes you spit & sputter
Shiver and shutter
Mumble and mutter
But the next one tastes so sweet
It makes you want another
And now you're drinkin' all the time

If you're lookin' for trouble
Trouble will find you
Trouble will find you
Trouble will find you
Don't go lookin' for trouble
Trouble will find you
And you sure don't have to look too hard

The first time you shade the truth
You want to run and hide
Your tongue gets tied
Your throat gets dry
And you start thinkin' that maybe no one knows you lied
And now you're shady all the time

Don't go lookin' for trouble
Trouble will find you
Trouble will find you
Trouble will find you
Don't go lookin' for trouble
Trouble will find you
And you sure don't have to look too hard

Trouble will pin a tail on you
And follow you around
And catch you when your number's up
And when your guard is down

The first time you fall in love
And the skies are sunny
She calls you honey
Your jokes are funny
Then she reminds you she was only in it for the money
And now you're drinkin' all the time

Don't go lookin' for trouble
Trouble will find you
Trouble will find you
Deaf, dumb, & blind you
Don't go lookin' for trouble
Let me remind you
You sure don't have to look too hard
Trouble in your own backyard
