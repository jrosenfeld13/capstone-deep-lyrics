[Chorus 1:]
Go west
Paradise is there
You'll have all that you can eat
Of milk & honey over there

[Chorus 2:]
You'll be the brightest star
The world has ever seen
Sun-baked slender heroine
Of film & magazine

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2:]
You'll be the brightest light
The world has ever seen
The dizzy height of a jet-set life
You could never dream

[Verse 1:]
Your pale blue eyes
Strawberry hair
Lips so sweet
Skin so fair
Your future bright
Beyond compare
It's rags to riches
Over there
San andreas fault
Moved its fingers
Through the ground
Earth divided
Plates collided
Such an awful sound
San andreas fault
Moved its fingers
Through the ground
Terra cotta shattered
And the walls came
Tumbling down

[Chorus 3:]
Oh, promised land
O, wicked ground
Build a dream
Tear it down

[Chorus 3:]
Oh, promised land
(Oh, promised land)
What a wicked ground
(Such a wicked ground)
Build a dream (dream...)
Watch it all fall down
