She wears those micromini dresses
Hair hanging down her back

She wears those seethrough sweaters
She likes to wear her stocking black
And if I see her tonight

You can bet your life I'll attack

She got beautiful teeth

A toothpaste adman's dream
She got a beautiful form
The best I've ever seen
I' gonna get her tonight

I don't care where she been

Well
I said baby
Baby

Baby what you doin' to me
I said baby
Baby

Baby what you doin' to me
I said baby
Baby

Baby jump into my dream

I dream that she was Lady Chatterley'n
I was the game keeper
I dream that I was Da Vinci and
She was the Mona Lisa
I dream that I was Humbert and
She was Lolita

I said baby
Baby

Baby what you doin' to me
I said baby
Baby

Baby what you doin to me
I said baby
Baby

Baby jump into my dream
