[Chorus]
Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
They go to a lake of fire and fry
Won't see 'em again 'till the 4th of July

[Verse 1]
Oh, I knew a lady who came from Duluth
Who got bit by a dog with a rabid tooth
She went to her grave a little too soon
And flew away howling on the yellow moon

[Chorus]
Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
They go to a lake of fire and fry
Won't see 'em again until the 4th of July

[Verse 2]
Now people cry and people moan
And look for a dry place to call their home
And try to find some place to rest their bones
Before the angels and the devils fight to make 'em their own

[Chorus]
Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
They go to a lake of fire and fry
Won't see 'em again until the 4th of July
