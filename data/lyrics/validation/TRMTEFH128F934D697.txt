I'm not a superhero
Ill never fly through your window or crash through walls cuz you say so
I'm not an evil genius
I never meant to play mind games or tried to fuck up everything
I'm through with you
I'm through with you
The bridge has burned
Another lesson that I've learned
I'm moving on
I'm moving on
I've realized, should have listened to myself
I'm not that superficial
You never wanted to grow up
I never wanted to give in
You think that your so special
You might be partly right but you should stop being so damn selfish
You never wanted to do anything
And you always told me that I'm not one to give
And everytime I thought it was my fault it's you
