All I fucking do is complain
Me and the rest of the scene
That's what's wrong with us
Whinging does nothing
When did we become so clean
I'm really over this
No one want's to hit close to home
I'm this I'm that which makes me right
No it makes you narrow minded you're
Choking on your words you fucking clone

Get straight up do our part
Word up do our part
We're not the only ones

I know you think you are so smart
So heres a four one one for you
I know you've got know heart
So I can see right through
Why don't you just do your part
Make a start show us heart
See that shit right through
What the fuck are gonna do

What are we gonna do
Like I said before
It's up to you and me
Whinging does nothing
Does nothing
