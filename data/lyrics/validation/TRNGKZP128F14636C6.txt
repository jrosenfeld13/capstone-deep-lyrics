Give your broken heart
To me
Let me give you my soul
For you to keep
Just give me some words
To speak

Gonna leave it down
Cos all I wanna do is be around

Someone like you
Someone like you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Someone like you no fool can suffer
I just can't wait long enough
For someone else to take your love

Let me open my heart
For you to see
Let me give you my soul
For you to keep
Let your love go
Just let it go with me

Have I ever let you down?
Cos all I wanna do is be around

Someone like you
Someone like you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Someone like you, no fool can suffer
I just can't wait long enough
For someone else to take your love
I can learn to live again
Wash away the hurt inside

Hell yeah
Send 'um up, send 'um up

Have I ever let you down
Cos all I wanna do is be around

Someone like you
Someone like you
Someone like you no fool can suffer
Someone like you no fool can suffer

Cos all I wanna do is be around
