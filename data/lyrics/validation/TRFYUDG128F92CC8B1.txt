Sweet fall, come and take me away from this pain
Towards the dark womb of winter

Sweet fall, come and take me away from this pain
Towards the dark womb of winter
Beautiful fall, kill the light of summer
And bless us with your shades

Sweet fall, chase the sun away
And lay down the veil of leaves

Sweet fall, chase the sun away
And lay down the veil of leaves
Beautiful fall, come and take me away from this pain
Towards the dark womb of November

"To them you are the bringer of grief
But you will lead me to hope
Into the arms of winter frost
Will you release me
And silence those fears
I wait for your arrival
And soon it will be too cold for the tears
For the tears"

The great clouds, I welcome your shields
My old friend, will you lay me back to rest

The great clouds, I welcome your shields
My old friend, will you lay me back to rest
I've been suffering so long without you
Come and take me away from this pain
