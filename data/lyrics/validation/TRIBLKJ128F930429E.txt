Oh what a beautiful city
Oh what a beautiful city
Oh what a beautiful city
Twelve gates to the city hallelujah
Oh what a beautiful city
Oh what a beautiful city
Oh what a beautiful city
Twelve gates to the city hallelujah
There's three gates in the east
There's three gates in the west
There's three gates in the north
There's three gates in the south
That makes twelve gates to the city hallelujah
Oh what a beautiful city
Oh what a beautiful city
Oh what a beautiful city
Twelve gates to the city hallelujah
If you see my dear old brother
Won't you do this kind favor for me?
Won't you please tell my brother
To meet me in Galilee
Well there's twelve gates to the city hallelujah
Oh what a beautiful city
Oh what a beautiful city
Oh what a beautiful city
Twelve gates to the city hallelujah
God almighty won't you
Whatcha talking about
Whatcha crying about
Oh what a beautiful city
Oh what a beautiful city
Oh what a beautiful city
Twelve gates to the city hallelujah
