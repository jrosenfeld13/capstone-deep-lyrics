You might have been a villain
With a capital V
You might have had a plane to catch
And left your family

It doesn't matter what you was
It's what you is
And what you is
Is what you are

You might have been a midwife
Trying to help somebody in
You might have been a Cardinal
With an A to Zed of skin

Open up your window...
...honey let me in

You might have been Columbia
Releasing orange 45s
(Hot As Steeeeeeeel)
You might have been the empress bee
In her furry little hive
(Buzz Buzz)

All the other bees:
It doesn't matter what you was
It's what you is
And what you is
Is what you are

Well you've got to come from somewhere
But you don't have to go back there...
...anymore

Hey!

You might have been the police
Knock knock knocking at the door
You might have been a nice young man
On a nice young floor

It doesn't matter what you was
It's what you is
And what you is
Is what you are

One more, yeah

It doesn't matter what you was
Or what you is
And what you is
Is what you are

You might be looking innocent
Mmmm...deep inside you're not
You might be feeling guilty
Just a little not a lot

It doesn't matter what you was
It's what you is
And what you is
Is what you are

Yeah!

Hey...hey, hey
Hey...hey, hey
Hey...hey, hey
Hey, hey
