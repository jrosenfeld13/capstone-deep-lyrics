George

I gave you high steppin' slippers but you still can't move your feat
And it's cold in the morning so I turn away at the heat
You say : 'Faster boy, speed up' - but still I'm much too slow
I feel your innuendo

You got all the answers, least they say you do
But when I start to strut my stuff, you say : 'Hey, time to go'
That ain't what I've been told
Guess I better meet you down the road, down the road

You know sometimes I wanna steal away and stay, yeah
Till my faces touch the ground
My dinner in Chicago, oh my breakfast down the line
If you don't hear from me, girl, I hope you're feelin' fine
'Cause I've been doin' time, hope you're feelin' fine

Call me up, catch a plane, don't think of taking another game
'Cause my regular lady she gets my pocket change

Do you want my every thought ?
Well, come over here and try to get me off
Won't you please me ?

Shake your dignity
Put a little on me
On me, on me, on me
