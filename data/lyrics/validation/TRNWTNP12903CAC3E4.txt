Just give me something to feel
Im waking out of a dream
Never had to feel love
Never had to really know

Just give me some other way
Im holding on to the grave
Never had to realize
Never had a real love

I dont need no one
I dont want no one
I aint got no one

I dont need no one
I dont want no one
I aint got no one

I dont need no one
I dont want no one
I aint got no one

Dont wanna be alone
Dont wanna be alone

Just give me something to pray
The light is slipping away
Never had a real love
Never had to feel alive

I dont need no one
I dont want no one
I aint got no one

I dont need no one
I dont want no one
I aint got no one

I dont need no one
I dont want no one
I aint got no one

Dont wanna be alone

I dont need no one
I dont want no one
I aint got no one

Dont wanna be alone
