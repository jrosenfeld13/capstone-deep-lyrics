A frigid chill licks the night air
As the neon lights cut the sky
In the darkest alleys the silhouettes appear
Beckoning the night
The Darkness calls them out
Stalking the street on a psychotic roundabout
No religions here, no cross to bear, no shelter from the beast
They lived the hard life
Scratched to survive
They come out at night
On your fears they feast
Better run and hide
Beware of the FREAKS!
Like fallen angels about to die
Demented delinquents on a one way ride
A figurehead, degenerate
From the bowels of the east
They took the hard life
He kills to sirvive
They come out at night
On your fears they feast
Better run and hide
Beware of the FREAKS!
Beware of the Freaks ... they're coming to get ya!
