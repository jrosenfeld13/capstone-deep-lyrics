Betrayal - Is it what you want
Deceit - Is all you will get
Hate - Is your only weapon

I can believe in you
When all I know and feel is true
Something is here it lies within
There is life without an end

I can't believe in nothing
Now I have seen it in you
I can't believe in nothing
Now I have seen

The truth - Was enough to make me
Revenge - I will not weaken
Sorrow - Is all you will get

Tormented minds that see as one
A broken heart
A broken dream
The end is here it is nearing fast
It's up to you
It's up to you

I can believe in you
When all I know and feel is true
Something is here it lies within
There is life without an end

I can't believe in nothing
Now I have seen it in you
I can't believe in nothing
Now I have seen it all
