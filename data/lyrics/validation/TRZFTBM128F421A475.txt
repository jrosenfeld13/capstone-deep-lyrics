You never told me that you didn't like my face
You never told me, so how could I've known
How could I've known

I saw you yesterday down at the bar
I smiled and said Hello and how you are
You didn't say a word, just ran away- ran away
I was completely surprized, I could not understand

You never told me...

I found you on the outside, tears in your eyes
And as you saw me coming you tried to hide
But I came after you and finally- finally
I got you in my arms and never let you go

You never told me that you were in love with me
You never told me, so ho could I've known
