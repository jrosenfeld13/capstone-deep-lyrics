You're in denial, you're in denial
And I know
Well what's my name, well what's my name ?
I don't know

Baby if you telephone
Maybe I can meet you in the morning
Call me if you're on your own
And maybe I can meet you in the morning

You're in denial, you're in denial
And I know
Well what's my name, well what's my name?
I don't know

Baby if you telephone
Maybe I can meet you in the morning
Call me if you're on your own
And maybe I can meet you in the morning

Mornings eleven, the feelings are severed
I can't feel anything at all
But I would die for you
Oh I would die for you

All that I've ever seen
All that I've ever been
All that I've ever was
I would die for you
Oh I would die for you

I had it all
But I never thought I did
No, no, no, no, I never thought I did
I had it all
But I never thought I did
No, no, no, no I never thought I did

You're in denial, you're in denial
And I know
Well whats my name, well whats my name
I don't know

Baby if you telephone
Maybe I can meet you in the morning
Call me if you're on your own
And maybe I can meet you in the morning

Die for you
Die for you

I had it all
But I never thought I did
No, no, no, no, I never thought I did
I had it all
But I never thought I did
No, no, no, no I never thought I did

I had it all
