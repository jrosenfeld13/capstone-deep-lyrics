What's this again
I've heard this so many times
You're scared
I'm tired
I can't reach in and find a way
To say this is the last time
This is the last time
This is the last time

You send me over and under
Over and under
Over and under
You send me over and under
Over and under
Over and under

I've always helped you
I've always listened
Your words repeating
Stagnant and distant
Now we are stuck
Right where we started
Damage is done
This is the last time
This is the last time

It's gone too long
Why don't we stop
We can't go on
We've hit the end

You send me over and under
Over and under
Over and under
You send me over and under
Over and under
Over and under
