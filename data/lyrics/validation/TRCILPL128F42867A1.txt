I can't find no inspiration
Nothing that keeps me up at night
I wanna give you satisfaction
So you don't say whats wrong or right

Someone please tell me
Just what is not stickin'

Listen to the sound of the beat not stoppin'
No reaction
No reaction

Lookin' at the chart but nothings toppin'
No reaction
No reaction

Listen to the sound of the reggae droppin'
No reaction
No reaction

Lookin' at the Matts and the Johns not talkin'
No reaction
No reaction

Lookin' at the Matts and the Johns not talkin'
No reaction
No reaction

Lookin' at the Matts and the Johns not talkin'
No reaction
