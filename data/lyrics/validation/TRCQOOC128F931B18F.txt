Good mornin' baby what's the matter
You didn't sleep so well last night
Won't waist your time with idle chatter
Just want to see if you're all right

You're so hard to please
So hard to please
Can't make you happy
So hard to please

I don't mind whilin' away the hours
Just takin' walks and whistlin' tunes
But over your head I see clouds and showers
On this sunny Sunday afternoon

You're so hard to please
So hard to please
Baby tell me what's the matter
So hard to please

I try so hard to make you happy
I'm willin' to go the extra mile
Now I couldn't you drop it all for a minute
And it wouldn't hurt to see you smile

You're so hard to please
So hard to please
Can't make you happy
So hard to please
