Another morning, wide awake
Different day, same mistake
Some nameless stranger lying in my bed
One more case of one more night
Ill have one more so I can fight
That voice of reason weaving through my head
But darling youre the only thing constant on my mind
Do you ever think about me, at least from time to time

Silk flowers forgotten on a lonely windowpane
Dusty, dreaming of the day theyd touch the satin rain
My love is like these roses, dying to be true
Withered, worn and waiting to find my way back to you

I spend my days and what money made
Biding time with wasted ways
Clinging to the same old blues again
All the shoulda beens and the coulda dones
Just loaded questions in a loaded gun
Whats the use in ridiculing words I left unsaid
But darling Im still holding on, a blossom stuck in time
Do I ever cross your memory, like youve been crossing mine

Silk flowers forgotten on a lonely windowpane
Dusty, dreaming of the day theyd touch the satin rain
My love is like these roses, dying to be true
Withered, worn and waiting to find my way back to you

Right or wrong, Im hanging on
Tracing your name in the sky
Counting clouds, crying out
Tears rolling by
By and by

Silk flowers forgotten on a lonely windowpane
Dusty, dreaming of the day theyd touch the satin rain
My love is like these roses, dying to be true
Withered, worn and waiting to find my way back to you
Withered, worn and waiting to find my way back to you
