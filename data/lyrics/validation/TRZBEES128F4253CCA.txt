She says she'll meet me at the square
Outside of intergrill
Where the should-have-beens
Mix with the never-wills
Under a scattered sky
Between a fate and free will
And I look into her eyes her eyes her eyes her eyes her eyes
Are so dilated and still
You're a chemical girl
Let's call this chalice cup
I felt in love with you
As we were coming up
But now that evening is disposed
Along with amourous deceit
Cause you're a lovely girl
But just not for me
