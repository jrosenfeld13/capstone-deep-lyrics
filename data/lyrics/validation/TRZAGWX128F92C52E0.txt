Seven maids in waiting
Brushing your hair
And you'll be milking
Everything that's there

Color me and cover me
Color me in Black
Color me and cover me
Color me in Black

Think of me don't think of you
When you are there
But don't be thinking
Cause I really don't care

Just color me and cover me
Color me in Black
Color me and cover me
Color me in Black

Who'll be left
To come and find me
Who'll be left
To come and find me
I'll be somewhere hiding
