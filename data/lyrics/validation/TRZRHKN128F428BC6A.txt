When someone wants me to listen, I can't
If I'm supposed to do something, I won't
It's hard to tell if I can get along
But I'm not bitter
I'm not bitter
Not at all
Just a lot

I walk around the block to avoid you
And that's when I'm in a social mood
It's just my head that hurts me right now
But I'm not bitter
I'm not bitter
Not at all
Just a lot

I try to think back on the happiness and fun
It doesn't make much sense to blame you
For the wreck my life's become

Bitterness is reserved for stupid people
Not for someone intelligent like me
I don't have time to feel that way
I do things backwards when I say
That I'm not bitter
I'm not bitter
I'm not bitter
I'm not bitter
Not at all
Just a lot
