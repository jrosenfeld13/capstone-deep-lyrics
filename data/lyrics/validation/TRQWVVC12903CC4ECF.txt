From four until late
I was wringing my hands and crying
From four until late
I was wringing my hands and crying
I believe to my soul
That your daddy's Gulfport bound

From Memphis to Norfolk
Is a thirty-six hour ride
From Memphis to Norfolk
Is a thirty-six hour ride
A man is like a prisoner
And he's never satisfied

A woman is like a dresser
Some man's always ramblin' through its drawers
A woman is like a dresser
Some man's always ramblin' through its drawers
It cause so many men wear an apron overhaul

From four until late
She get with a no good bunch and clown
From four until late
She get with a no good bunch and clown
Now she won't do nothin'
But tear a good man's reputation down

When I leave this town
I'm 'onna bid you fare farewell
It's when I leave this town
I'm 'onna bid you fare farewell
And when I return again
You'll have a great long story to tell
