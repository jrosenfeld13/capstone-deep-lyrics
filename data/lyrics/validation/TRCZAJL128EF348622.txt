Only for the wind I lay myself down
Feeling this scarlet scent of death
Under ebony shades I dream of a child
Dancing in heaven, dancing in heaven
I must have seen this face before
A monument of shallow sorrows
Under ebony shades a child now dies
But grievance won't regain
Something grasp for my soul
I think it's god
But my sorrow is dragging me down
Through my sins
Where is god in his heaven?
Why am I a twisted mind?
Now I see the light above
But in darkness I must fall
For my soul you pray at last
Will I find my place?
The stench of sorrow that pierces my flesh
Can never be pure
When the blackness overwhelms me
Where shall I turn?
To run away to never look back
To run away from evil
