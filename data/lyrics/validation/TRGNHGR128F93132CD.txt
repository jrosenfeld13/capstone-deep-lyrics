Travellin' somewhere, could be anywhere
Theres a coldness in the air, but I don't care
We drift deeper, life goes on
We drift deeper, into the sound

Travellin' somewhere, could be anywhere
Theres a coldness in the air, but I don't care
We drift deeper into the sound, life goes on
We drift deeper into the sound, feeling strong

So bring it on, so bring it on
We drift deeper into the sound, life goes on
We drift deeper into the sound, feeling strong
So bring it on, so bring it on
We drift deep

We drift deeper, life goes on
We drift deeper, drift deeper
We drift deeper into the sound, life goes on
We drift deeper into the sound, feeling strong

So bring it on, so bring it on
We drift deeper into the sound, life goes on
We drift deeper into the sound, feeling strong
So bring it on, so bring it on

Embrace me; surround me, as the rush comes
Embrace me; surround me, as the rush comes
Embrace me; surround me, as the rush comes
Embrace me; surround me, as the rush comes
Embrace me; surround me, as the rush comes
Embrace me; surround me, as the rush comes
Embrace me; surround me, as the rush comes
As the rush comes
As the rush comes
As the rush comes
As the rush comes
As the rush comes
