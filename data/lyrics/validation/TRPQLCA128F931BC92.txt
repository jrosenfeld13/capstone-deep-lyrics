You don't want to know
But that won't stop me from showing

For nights I drank too much
And words exchanged in the morning
For always pushing my luck
Expecting you to keep waiting

I want to be faithful
But as far as I can tell
I'm not doing so well thus far
But maybe tomorrow
You'll wake up to find out
If I'm not good enough for now
I'm good enough to wait for you

What have you been told?
What are you so afraid of?
Should I be so bold
And ask where that one came from?

I want to be faithful
But as far as I can tell
I'm not doing so well thus far
But maybe tomorrow
You'll wake up to find out
If I'm not good enough for now
I'm good enough to wait for you

Can I be read my rights
Before you put me on trial
My past offense precedes my name
Your best friend says that I'm leading you astray
But we all like to talk without much to say
You don't have to

I want to be faithful
But as far as I can tell
I'm not doing so well thus far
But maybe tomorrow
You'll wake up to find out
If I'm not good enough for now
I'm good enough to wait for you
