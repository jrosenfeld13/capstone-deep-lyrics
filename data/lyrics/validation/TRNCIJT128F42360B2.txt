I woke up with a headache from the night before
Cause sometimes i drink
I spent the night with my head in a toliet bowl
It's where i like to think

I say cause i don't want no one to take a piece of my heart
I hate to lose all those itty-bitty pieces from my heart
La-la-la-ah-eh-oh

You ever spent all night thinking about your life
Well i suggest you try
Well it's something that you're gonna want to do in the night
Cause i tend to cry

Say cause i don't want no one to take a piece of my heart
I hate to lose all those itty-bitty pieces from my heart
La-la-la-ah-eh-oh

You ever spent all day thinking about the night
It's something that you do
When you're thinking way too much, you're out of sight
What you gonna do

I say cause i don't want no one to take a piece of my heart
I hate to lose all those itty-bitty pieces from my heart
La-la-la-ah-eh-oh
Yeah yeah you
