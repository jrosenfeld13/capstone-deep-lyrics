It's been long enough that I can think of you
It's been long enough that I can speak to you
But I don't really think that you'd want to anymore
Yeah, I could've done much better for you
Yeah, I could've done much better for you
But you could've done much better for me I'm sure

What if we got it all wrong?
What if we got it all wrong?
What if we got it all, what if we got it all wrong?

What if we got it all wrong?
What if we got it all wrong?
What if we got it all, what if we got it all wrong?

So we tried our best, but it wasn't enough
And we tried so hard that we fucked it up
And I understand, yeah I understand it love
It's gotta be hard what you're going through
And i get what you say, but it's what we do
That got us here and i guess what's done is done

What if we got it all wrong?
What if we got it all wrong?
What if we got it all, what if we got it all wrong?

What if we got it all wrong?
What if we got it all wrong?
What if we got it all, what if we got it all wrong?

The days are short and the nights are long
And it's all fucked up but we carry on
Cause there's little else and there's nothing left to do
And i could've done much better for you
Yeah I could've done much better for you
But you could've done much better for me, too

What if we got it all wrong?
What if we got it all wrong?
What if we got it all, what if we got it all wrong?

What if we got it all wrong?
What if we got it all wrong?
What if we got it all, what if we got it all wrong?
