I don't believe that my friends are down, yes, so down
'Cause I see them laughin' and cryin' around
I don't believe that my friends are dead, yes so dead
'Cause I see them jumpin', yes, over my head
I don't believe that my friends are down, yes, so down
'Cause I see them jumpin', yes, over my head
I love my friends, that I think they love my fragment
I be on down, 'cause I'm toiling, my friends are dead
