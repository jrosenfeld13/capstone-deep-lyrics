The leaves lie dead on my bed
From the words you said in my head, in my head

Coast to coast like a ghost
Till I track you down I suppose
Close to close but still far away
I'm the right player out of this move

If you go, if you succeed
I may not live to breathe another day
A happy day I found a place
Where I could stay, I found a way

Ease my owl in the night
You'll come back now and make it alright
Oh if you go, if you succeed
I may not live to breathe another day
Oh I'll be there, I found a place
Where I could stay, I found a way
I know people love exactly how
No surprise in your eyes
And when you ask them what they mean - Goodbye
The only thing is in their eyes

Oh if you go, if you succeed
I may not live to breathe another day
Oh I'll be there, I found a place
Where I could stay, I found a way
