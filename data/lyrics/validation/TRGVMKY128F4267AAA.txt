[Verse 1]
Hear what I'm saying, you're losing control
Can't take the sun from her eyes
She's built for comfort, she ain't no fool
She said, take a look
It's easy tonight

[Chorus]
It's going to be alright
She made me feel alright
Baby baby baby baby, feel alright, wooh
Yeah, it's going to be alright

[Verse 2]
A flaming sky sure makes her look good
You'll put your life on the line
Are you gonna stay, or do you wanna leave
Well hey, come with me
We'll have a good time

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I can't wait
I got to have her now
I can't wait
Well my love is growing stronger yeah
I can't wait
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
It's alright
Baby baby baby baby

[Outro]
She made me feel alright
Yeah, she made me feel alright
Well baby baby baby baby feel alright
Baby baby baby baby feel alright
It's going to be alright
She made me feel alright[x2]
