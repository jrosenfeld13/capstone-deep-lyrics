Last night, what a scene
So cool, a gypsy queen
Some crashed, the talk of the town
So shy, when I'm around

That's right, I'm a ladies' man, yes, I am

Some girls won't let go
Most girls can't say no
First glance, I could see
Your next move was up to me

That's right, I'm a ladies' man, yes I am
Come and get it, I'm all yours tonight
There's no reason to be shy
There's no sittin' wonderin' why

'Cause I'm a ladies' man
Come and get me, I'm all yours tonight, yeah

High-heels, crimson shoes
Slow down, lover's groove
Just right, not too fast
Good times were meant to last

That's why I'm a ladies' man, yes, I am
Come and get it, I'm all yours tonight
There's no need to wonder why
There's no sittin' bein' shy
'Cause I'm a ladies' man
Come and get it, I'm all yours tonight

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm a ladies' man
Come on, girl, I'm a ladies' man
It's alright, I'm a ladies' man
Come and get me, I'm all yours tonight
