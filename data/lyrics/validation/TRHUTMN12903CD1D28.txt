Whoa Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord

She was between 18 and 21
And we had something special going on
But every time I make Judgement to her vicinity
Yeah, yeah

(Someone got their eyes on me)
Whoa Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord
(Someone got their eyes on me)
Getting eyes on me, yeah, yeah
(Someone got their eyes on me)
It's giving me a strain
(Someone got their eyes on me)
Moving through my brain
(Someone got their eyes on me)
Even if I try to screechie
(Someone got their eyes on me)
Getting eyes on me, yeah, yeah

John Public

Slim, black and beautiful
Was her middle name
And the love that was so wonderful
Was this young girl favourite game
But every time that we get started

(Someone got their eyes on me)
It's giving me a strain
(Someone got their eyes on me)
Moving through my brain
(Someone got their eyes on me)
Even if I try to screechie
(Someone got their eyes on me)
Getting eyes on me, yeah, yeah
(Someone got their eyes on me)
Even if I try to screechie
(Someone got their eyes on me)
In every thing I do..
