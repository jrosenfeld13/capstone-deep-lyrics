[Verse 1]
Born on a farm in a transatlantic moonlight
Split like a cord of wood my family broke up
Sold like a piece of steer, a piece of meat, a cow
A breathing piece of shit

[Verse 2]
Picked for my age, for my strength and make up
Called for I was tall, I was big, I could hold up
A tree or a piece of steel I could do
What my fat owner can't

[Chorus]
Ah, future farmers of America
Future farmers of America
Future farmers of America

[Verse 3]
Ah
I'm always watching the way his wife looks me over
I have a sex twice as big as her husband's
If I wasn't so large, so strong, so pale
I'd disappear under a bush

[Verse 4]
Colorless men and ladies of the world unite
Kill your master with one cut of your knife
Kill them during sex, kill them during talk
Kill them whenever you can

[Chorus]
Future farmers of America
Future farmers of America
Future farmers of America

[Verse 5]
These stupid black owners are foreigners to affairs of the heart
Look at me, I'll never own land that I work on
Every one of us here shares a surname
This father must die

[Verse 6]
I was born on the dark cusp of twilight
My father was dark, my mother was light
Look at me, I'm strong
I could crush him in my fist

[Outro]
Ah
I could crush him in my
I could crush him in my
I could crush him in my fist

I could crush him in my
I could crush him in my
I could crush him in my fist

Future farmers of America
I could crush him in my fist
Future farmers of America
I could crush him in my fist
Future farmers of America
I could crush him in my fist
