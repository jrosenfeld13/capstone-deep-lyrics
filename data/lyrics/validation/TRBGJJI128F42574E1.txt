I'm walking along the river
Raindrops fall from the sky
The eagle above never wonders
'bout all the feelings gone by

The flower buds open their hearts
They're begging for water to fall
As they're starting to fill up my senses
I recognize them all

Falling far beyond the horizon
Falling in my and your lane
Falling in fear as the ground comes near
They're falling in the rain
They're falling in the rain

Throstle in the tree can you hear me
Let me hear singing your tune
Stars in the sky let me be part
When we take a dance with the moon

Butterfly open your wings
Woodpecker answer my call
Walking in midst the silence
Where I hear the raindrops fall

Falling far beyond the horizon
Falling in my and your lane
Falling in fear as the ground comes near
They're falling in the rain
They're falling in the rain

In silence, they roam in the grass
In silence, they drop on a stone
In masses, they fall from heaven above
But when they fall they die alone

Falling far beyond the horizon
Falling in my and your lane
Falling in fear as the ground comes near
They're falling in the rain
They're falling in the rain

Falling far beyond the horizon
Falling in my and your lane
Falling in fear as the ground comes near
They're falling in the rain
They're falling in the rain
