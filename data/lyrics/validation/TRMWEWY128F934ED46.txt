Does she remember the 4th of December?
She wants to sacrifice her summer with me
Let's start the car and head for the fun parks
We don't pay admission, we're sneaking in

Match made on a security camera
There's fake stamps on our wrists
When we're on the inside there's a - a gravitron and a waterslide
Like the sign says, too much fun for just one day

To you it might seem trivial
But if I must be a criminal
In comfort I'll find
That she's my partner in crime

Look like a ghost on the rollercoaster
Your fingernail marks are fading on my arm
Yeah we had our ups and downs but when we were upside down
The coins fell from my pockets like silver rain

To you it might seem trivial
But if I must be a criminal
In comfort I'll find
That she's my partner in crime

There's no other place we should be
So from our heads down to our sneakers we're natural born thrill seekers
Her mind is willing but my stomach is weak
Once we got caught and I got angry
I promised myself I'd never be that way again

There's no other place we should be
So where your hand ends my hand starts
We're fugitives in the fun park
Where your hand ends my hand starts
We're fugitives in the fun park
Where your hand starts my hand ends
You promised that we'd always be the best of friends
You said we'd never be the worst of friends
