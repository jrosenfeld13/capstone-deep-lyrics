There comes a time in every man life
When he needs that special someone
And ohh Ive been around the world
Looking for my special someone
I'm singing this one for my self
And I'm asking is anybody here lonely
Maybe one day maybe one day ill be with
You

(chorus)
Is anybody lonely (is anybody lonely)
Are you lonely (cause I'm lonely to)
Maybe one day ill be wit you
Ive been alone for a lone time
Waking up by myself
Cooking my own dinner
Washing my own clothes
Sometimes I lay in the bed at night
And I cry myself to sleep
Asking the lord what I did wrong
I say lord why am I alone
So this one dedicated especially for me is
There any ladies out there lonely
Is there someone for me
Chorus x2
She don't have to be a movie star
She don't have to be a fancy girl
Cause I see a woman for what she is
Inside all I want is a good girl
And I promise I promise I promise
Ill be a real real good man
Ill do all the things to show
How a good man understands
Cause right now I'm lonely lonely
And I'm feeling blue
And if you feel the same way
Maybe the woman can be you
Chorus x2
Lonely yes I am
I need a good woman to live my life wit
Some to hold me whoa
Chorus x2
I need somebody to hold
Somebody to kiss
Somebody to make love to
