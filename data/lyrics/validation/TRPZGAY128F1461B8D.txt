There's a brand-new establishment in town
With a lot of nice looking girls around
They wave you inside for tonight's a surprise
The hostess serves in Pompeii red
And you won't believe how you'll be fed
So make up your mind, tonight is the night - Alright

Come on and join in our party
You'll have the time of your life
Please hurry up we're just starting
We guarantee you
Tonight you'll have the time of your life

Once you're inside it takes your breath
This could be life this could be death
You're welcomed by ladies extraordinaire
Laying down on a velvet padded bench
The treatment is roman, it's not french
We promise a show that's gonna suit you right, all night

Come on and join in our party
You'll have the time of your life
Please hurry up we're just starting
We guarantee you
Tonight you'll see the best show of your life
This mellow light is slowly blinding
What is left of your disdain
In given time you'll end up
Feeling like yourself again

We present you
A blend of sound and light that blows your mind

Very slowly the curtains draw apart
The things that you'll see might stop your heart
You still have the chance to turn around in time
There's one thing you really ought to know
Life's not an everlasting show
Now wouldn't you wish you could be deaf
And blind, tonight

Come on and join in our party
You'll have the time of your life
Please hurry up we're just starting
We guarantee you
Tonight you'll see the best show of your life
(Tonight you'll see your life)

Come on into our party (oooh yeah)
You'll see what life is about
Please find a seat the show is starting
We inform you
Tonight could be the last night of your life
