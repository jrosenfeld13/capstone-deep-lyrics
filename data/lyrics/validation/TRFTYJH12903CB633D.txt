I'm scared when I'm at home, in my apartment on my own
It's changing colours through the day, it don't bother me when I'm OK

But now when all is changed around
I'm buried in the lost and found

I like to watch things on TV and tell your ghost to let me be
I know I can choose a different life and be off with you tonight

But where you are going I cannot follow
I know you hate this but I hold on
To this life that I embrace
Despite amusements that I chase

So I'll see you some day, I'll see you some day, see you some day
