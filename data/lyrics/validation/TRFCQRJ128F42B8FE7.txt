Summer solstice, evening sky
Cheerful nature caught my eye
Sweet surrender, feels so right
Underneath stellar light
Mixed emotions, mind or soul
True endearment, losing control

Stay with me
I need you more than ever
Hold my hand
Stay with me
The summer last forever
Circles in the sand

Mixed emotions, mind or soul
True endearment, losing control
Summer's over, the curtain fell
Ending up in blue hotel

Stay with me
I need you more than ever
Hold my hand
Stay with me
The summer last forever
Circles in the sand
