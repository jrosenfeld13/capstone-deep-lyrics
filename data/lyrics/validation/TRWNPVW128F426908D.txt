[Hook]
It's so good lovin' somebody
When somebody loves you back

[Verse 1]
To be loved and be loved in return
It's the only thing that my heart desires
Just appreciate the little things I do
Oh, you're the one who's got me inspired
Keep on liftin', liftin' me higher

[Hook]
So good, good lovin' somebody
When somebody loves you back
It's so good needin' somebody
When somebody needs you back

[Verse 2]
We can build a world of love, a life of joy
Make our goal each other's happiness
I will do for you anything that I can
Oh, everyday I wanna do a little more
Do a little more, just a little bit more

[Hook]
It's so good lovin' somebody
When somebody loves you back and that's a fact
It's so good wantin' somebody
When somebody wants you back
Said it's so good

[Verse 1]

[Hook]
So good lovin' somebody
When somebody loves you back and that's a fact
It's so good needin' somebody
When somebody needs you back

[Bridge]
Said not 70-30
Not 60-40
Talkin' 'bout a 50-50 love

[Hook]
Said it's so good lovin' somebody
And that somebody loves you back, yeah

[Bridge]
Said now 70-30
Now 60-40
Talkin' 'bout a 50-50 love, yeah

[Hook]
It's so good, good lovin' somebody
When somebody loves you back, yeah
It's so good, good

[Outro]
I'm so glad that there's you
I've experienced over and over again when
I've given 80 percent and she's given 20 percent
Now she's givin' 70 percent and I'm givin' 30

But you just don't know how it feels to have somebody
That you can share your whole life
Somebody that you don't mind talkin' to
Somebody that you don't mind goin' down the middle of the road

I know a lot of guys today they wish they had somebody just like you
I don't know when the last time I told you
But girl, you make me so very happy
I think we've got something that a lot of people don't seem to have
Talkin' 'bout a 50-50 love, yeah
