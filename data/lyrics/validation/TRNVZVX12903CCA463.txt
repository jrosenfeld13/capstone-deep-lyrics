I was there
When I was flesh
As I moved among mankind

Sadistic impulse
Sardonic disdain
Arcane perfector
Corpse herder

Murder God
Flesh-smith
Doom apparatus
Chaos cradle made of flesh

I was there
When I was flesh

I am the first
And by far the worst

I am (the) founding evil
Bearer of all plagues
The Antichrist malefactor
Manifestation of your fears

I can hear them howling
From a thousand gaping wounds
I have ridden Harmageddah
I summoned pestilence to read through your lands

Crawl back into your shit-pit under-scum
Into crippling fear and everlasting suffering
Theres no end to the depth of this perversion
Cling grimly to your rotting remains

I have walked alone through fire lakes
My shadow darkening your world
Through fields of a thousands crucified
Forever perched upon the brink of hell

With serpent mask and angel-hide
On predatory wings I stalk
Filth is clinging to my soul
With neural whips I reign

Sadistic impulse
Sardonic disdain
Arcane perfector
Corpse herder
