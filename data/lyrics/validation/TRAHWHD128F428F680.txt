It started the top
Now it's spiraling down
Works best when it's lost
Digging underground

Never mind it now
We can bring it back
It's total trash
And it's a natural fact that I'm not no cow

It's never the same
It's more than a game
Can't take it away
Can't kill all the shame

It's a guilty man
That increased the crack
It's total trash
Slap 'em on the back with a heavy rock

There it goes again
Magic monkey friend
God, I love the time
That he seems to spend with all the kids in town

It started the top
Now it's spiraling down
Works best when it's lost
Digging underground

Never mind it now
We can bring it back
It's total trash
And it's a natural fact that I'm not no cow
