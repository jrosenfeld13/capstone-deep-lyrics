This song believes you're a miracle
Don't believe in the cynical
And if you can hear it too, you better move along
You see time you feel it slip away
Man, you better get a plan today
Karma coming to get you down
You better jump out of the way

It's gonna be a long, long road
Gonna be a million paths to sow
Gonna be trouble on the way
Gonna get your fair share of the pain
And there's gonna be laughter and joy
Gonna be friends that you're gonna destroy
And there's gonna be family that don't exist
And there's gonna be people that you wished you'd never missed - just like...

Oh, I love the innocent
The way they see things is the end
Oh, I hope you see them too
I'm in danger of flipping my sideline wall
Hoping that you don't hear me fall
'Cos the echo is gonna hit you one day
You'd better jump out of the way, yeah

Gonna be a long, long road
Gonna be a million paths to sow
Gonna be trouble on the way
Gonna get your fair share of the pain
But there's gonna be laughter and joy
Gonna be things that you wanna destroy
There's gonna be family that don't exist
And there's gonna be people that you know you'll never miss -
Just like...

(I must be dreaming) oh just like...

Dream on dreamer, dream on dreamer, dream on dreamer
(I must be dreaming)
Dream on dreamer, dream on dreamer, dream on dreamer
(I must be dreaming)
Dream on dreamer, dream on dreamer, dream on dreamer
(Too busy dreaming)

Dream on dreamer, dream on dreamer, dream on dreamer, dream on dreamer

Dream on dreamer, dream on dreamer, dream on dreamer, dream on dreamer
