When I was a pale and skinny young kind
It didn't make me try but try to keep myself hid
And no one seemed to see me
They all ran to the boys with the boards by the shore with the tan
And the good teeth unlinke me, unlike me

The beach was wide and the sand was hot
I'm a little bit nervous about the trunks my mom bought
The girls in the bikinis
They all ran to the boys with the boards by the shore with the tan
And good teeth unlike me
So I cross my arms around myself and pretend like I don't care
They can run around me...

Now that I'm tall and I've got a girl
I like her pretty much and for a while I still will
She looks good in a bikini
And the boys run by trying to sweat off their guts
And I don't have to worry when they stare at her butt..

I wrap my arms around her and the boys don't even dare..
They can run around me...
