He tries to embrace her
She wants him to race her
He needs a laser
To get it through her skull
(Means and lies and hatreds)?
Tears that fall in sequence
Cold caress in Imprints
Conversation growing dull
Says he's a poet
Loudly protoazoan
And he kisses ass for free
I took a vow of silence
When he tries to talk to me
I just turn on the tv

He tries to impress her
Mentally undress her
It takes more to possess her
But in his pocket lies a hole
He's got a thousand talents
Charisma by the bagfull
Aristocratic parents
A rebel with a heart of gold

Says he's a poet
This time he's gonna blow it
'Cause he's dancing with his... ego
I took a vow of silence
When he reads his words to me
I swallow words like a... Placebo

He's strutting with your flesh mechanic
Gets him in a panic
He's wasting time
'Cause everybody is a star... In his eyes

Careful not to give your favours
To your lonesome fucked-up neighbours
I had one who sent me her heart
In a tupperware container
All the movies in my head
They flicker with my bleeding heart
A careless slipping of the tongue
On just another private part
Blatant search for
Stoned affection
Fights the lust that
Breeds infection
Meet me at the... Intersection
Don't forget your... Fuel injection
He's strutting with your flesh mechanic
Gets him in a panic
He's wasting time
'Cause everybody is a star
In his eyes
You think this love is bona fide
You're being taken for a ride
Wrap your lip around your head
And slowly blow yourself away
