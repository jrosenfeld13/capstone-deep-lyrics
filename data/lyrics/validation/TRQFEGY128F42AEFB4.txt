(Spoken):
The ultimate pleasure's giving pleasure
Yeah, I'm a Taurus...they say that we're patient lovers...Are you a Scorpio, Cancer, Capricorn? On the cusp?

(sing)
If you should feel thirsty, I'll be sure to bring you water
Yes, girl I got candles that will slow burn longer
And I know your favorite love song
And how you like it on repeat
Me, I was born a patient lover
So I'll start with your feet

(chorus)
It would be like
When hearts beat as one
It would feel like
No ordinary kiss
You and I
Now close your eyes
And picture us
Breathing life

Repeat chorus

I'll do my best to inspire you
To dream of us til we meet again
You may even be encouraged
To take a walk so we can love again
The Most High outdid herself when
She created you
And girl I am thankful
For how our love has bloomed

Repeat chorus 4x
