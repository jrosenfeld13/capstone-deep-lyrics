I'm asking everyone around me
How to live my life
I know the answers I keep hearing
But I listen close each time

I'm waiting for something
To click but it don't come
I wish I didn't have to choose
Then there's no one to blame

Help me find my way
'Cause I've been lost since you've been gone
Like the rose you left behind
'Cause I can see the ground
Help me find my way
Help me find my way

There's only so much I'm prepared for
You can't expect me to fly
I've been trying my best to finish
Where you left off

Who am I supposed to trust?
Every smile speaks
I'll have to teach myself
How to live and to learn

Help me find my way
'Cause I've been lost since you've been gone
Like the rose you left behind
'Cause I can see the ground
Help me find my way
Help me find my way

Help me find my way
'Cause I've been lost since you've been gone
Help me find my way
'Cause I've been lost since you've been gone
Like the rose you left behind
'Cause I can see the ground

I need you everyday to tell me what to say
Help me find a way
Just help me find my way
