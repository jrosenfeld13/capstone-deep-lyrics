I searched, I found and I lost love
Now I've started all over
Now not a day goes by when
I'm not sure you're the one

'Cos you give me something baby
It's a feeling I just can't contain
You give me something baby
And it's something I'll never find again

You give me love you give me life
Darlin' what more can I want
I'm never gonna fail in love again
You're givin' me something more and I know
I won't be searching no more
I'm never gonna fall in love again

I wake and feel you by my side
And your touch is so tender
I'm so at home in your caress
In your arms

'Cos you give me something baby
It's a feeling I just can't contain
You give me something baby
And it's something I'll never find again

You give me love you give me life
Darlin' what more can I want
I'm never gonna fail in love again
You're givin' me something more and I know
I won't be searching no more
I'm never gonna fall in love again

'Cos I got you baby, you baby, you
I got you baby, you baby, you
I got you baby, you baby, you
I got you baby, you baby, you

Oh I've found someone
Someone who I can depend on
And it changed my life
Knowing that I can survive

You give me love you give me life
Darlin' what more can I want
I'm never gonna fail in love again
You're givin' me something more and I know
I won't be searching no more
I'm never gonna fall in love again

'Cos I got you baby, you baby, you
I got you baby, you baby, you
I got you baby, you baby, you
I got you baby, you baby, you
