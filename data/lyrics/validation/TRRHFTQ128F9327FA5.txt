I was left on the mountain
The shadows turned to bears
I looked around to where she once was
And all I heard was the wind say
See out past the water
Ain't it nice to see her shine again
So just look out past the shadows
Cause they will always be there my friend
Calling out past the mountains edge
I felt my voice growing faint
There are two paths down this mountain
And the distance ain't my friend
See out past the water
Ain't it nice to see her shine again
So just look out past the shadows
Cause they will always be there my friend
Down this gap, it divides us
The hanging rock, the sun flare
I'm taking the longest route to the bottom
But I know my way around there
See out past the water
Ain't it nice to see her shine again
So just look out past the shadows
Cause they will always be there my friend
See out past the water
Ain't it nice to see her shine again
So just look out past the shadows
Cause they will always be there my friend
