Bound in honour
Men are forcing to
Quitting existence
For everyone's freedom
Missing in action
But no reaction
There is no evidence so they say no crime!
This man left his family behind
He took no dime
He made no sound
And no one heard a cry!
He's bleeding in jail
Waiting for the end
His last fight against insanity
His head full of sorrows
Missing his loved ones
His mind is falling, falling!
It is one life wasted
The spirit lives on
He made us brave
He saved our conscience
One single light can start a burning fire
And some of us might survive!
Give me a sign!
Not for glory
But for justice
Men are fighting
Against oppression
Against dissection
Reclamation cost his life
Evil corruption
System slaves
Some people ask no question
No help for this man, no, cause he died alone unknown
It is one life wasted
The spirit lives on
He made us brave
He saved our conscience
One single light can start a burning fire
And some of us might survive!
Give me a sign!
For all the dreamers
Self esteemers
Give me a sign
Give me a sign
Give me a sign
Torture and death
A normal life is no crime mothaf*cka!
He's bleeding in jail
Waiting for the end
His last fight against insanity
His head full of sorrows
Missing his loved ones
His mind is falling, falling!
For all the dreamers
Self esteemers
It is one life wasted
The spirit lives on
He made us brave
He saved our conscience
One single light can start a burning fire
And some of us might survive!
He's falling, falling, falling down
He's falling, falling, falling to the ground!
