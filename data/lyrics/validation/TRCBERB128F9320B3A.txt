You gotta tear shit down at the boys club
You gotta jerk like you don't even know
You gotta hypnotize your children
You gotta be first on the draw

You gotta burn up your soul
And walk on down that road

You gotta lurch like you don't have a damn thing
You gotta reach a thousand watts
You gotta live to enjoy the black nights
You gotta be first on the draw

You gotta burn up your soul
And walk on down that road

They say that rats ain't got no friends
They say that stink will never end

You gotta pressure it down when you're dancing
For all the minute that you can't get around
Gonna sacrifice my vision
Be first on the draw
