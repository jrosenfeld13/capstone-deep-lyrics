Is it still you and me against the world? All I've got to lose are my teeth
We're gonna throw it down together, tonight
We're gonna burn this town to the ground and laugh over the flames

Collapsible sentiment fills our lives
I've burned pages behind me and mountains before
Watch us break at the waist and bleed from our fingertips...
Nailing our coffins to our outstretched arms

I'm lost in a haze of myself
My memory is too filled with fists
And my hands are too weak from writing down our lives
Here we are...watch us go
Four shots fire out, cold and hollow
And your eyes give in to that shattered glass shine
So I call out and I follow
Passion can't apply when we're so drained and pale
