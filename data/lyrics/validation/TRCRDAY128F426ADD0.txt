I just love my nightmares
I can't wait to sleep
Enjoying all my dreams
Got no regrets

I can be a flash of lightning
Striking down on rocks
Burning down the law
Getting things I never got

Turning the world
Nothing unheard
One night can be more than a day

Just like a black widow
Like a black widow

I can't stand the dreamers
Scared of things that fly
They just have sweet fantasies
And fade and die

Nightmares - are so good, so good
And they always end just when they should

Nightmares are cool, nightmares are cruel
I love the fun and the thrill

Just like a black widow
Like a black widow
Black widow
Just like a black widow

Here comes the morning
And who can deny
Leaving the dream is so hard
I love my nightmares
I await their return
And this time, Im dressed to kill, dressed to kill

Just like a black widow............
