[Verse 1]
Caught off guard
All worked up
The air is as dark and cold as night
Let me go
I'm not done
I swear I'll take just one lifetime and I

[Chorus]
I won't lie
I won't sin
Maybe I don't wanna go
Can't you wait
Maybe I don't wanna go

[Verse 2]
I should have asked
I could have helped
At least a fucking 1,000 times before
Will this offer get me in
Or does this prove that they gave more and I

[Chorus]

[Piano solo]

[Chorus x2]
