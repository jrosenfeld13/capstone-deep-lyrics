I have had my share of pain
Staying here makes me insane
All the nights that I've been through
Thinking how get over you
Here's the end to all your lies
You're a hypocrite goodbye
I no longer need your help
I can stand up for myself

I can I can I can stand for myself
I can I can I can stand for myself
I can I can I can stand for myself

You were always full of greed
You supplied the luxury
But this heart was not impressed
I'll be happy left with less
I'll be fine out on my own
I can face the world alone
Once a trophy on a shelf
Now I stand up for myself

I've got a life to live
I've got to give myself a chance
I'm leaving you behind today

I woke up made up my mind
You're a tragic waste of time
I no longer need your help
I can stand up for myself

I can I can I can stand for myself
I can I can I can stand for myself
I can I can I can stand for myself

You can beg and crawl the floor
I'm still walking out that door
It's pathetic how you try
Makes me laugh to see you cry
Here's the boy that you deceived
See him pack his bags and leave
I no longer need your help
I can stand up for myself

You're so conservative
You pride yourself with tolerance
Still can't accept I walk away
I've got a life to live
I've got to give myself a chance
I'm leaving you behind today

Don't you dare to cause a scene
All those quarrels are routine
I'm as happy as could be
I have walked away I'm free
Here's the end to all your lies
You're a hypocrite goodbye
I no longer need your help
I can stand up for myself

I can I can I can stand for myself
I can stand up for myself
I can I can I can stand for myself
I can I can I can stand for myself
I can stand up for myself
I can I can I can stand for myself
I can I can I can stand for myself
I can stand up for myself
I can I can I can stand for myself
I can I can I can stand for myself
I can stand up for myself
I can I can I can stand for myself
