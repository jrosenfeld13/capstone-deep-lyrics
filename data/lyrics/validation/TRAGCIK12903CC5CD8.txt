In my life something was wrong
In her arms I could be light

Like the breeze that blew the man across
The sea to take a love away

Life becomes laughter and sun
I was having too much fun

Like the breeze that blew the man across
The sea to take a love away
Stop breathing Stop breathing
Stop breathing Stop breathing

I was having too much fun

Like the breeze that blew the man across
The sea to take a love away
