We're the boys of Belfast town
Rantin', roarin', ramblin' 'round
We're Irishmen of high renown
That's the boys of Belfast

We're the boys of Belfast town
Rantin', roarin', ramblin' 'round
We're Irishmen of high renown
That's the boys of Belfast

You will find us anywhere
In the church or on the tare
Brave and bold there's none so rare
That's the boys of Belfast

We're the boys of Belfast town
Rantin', roarin', ramblin' 'round
We're Irishmen of high renown
That's the boys of Belfast

We can fight with sword or pen
We'll never break, we'll never bend
And if we fall we'll rise again
For we're the boys of Belfast

We're the boys of Belfast town
Rantin', roarin', ramblin' 'round
We're Irishmen of high renown
That's the boys of Belfast

When we're back on Paddy's shore
The lassies they'll be sad no more
Tonight we'll make the rafters roar
In the pubs of Belfast

We're the boys of Belfast town
Rantin', roarin', ramblin' 'round
We're Irishmen of high renown
That's the boys of Belfast

We're the boys of Belfast town
Rantin', roarin', ramblin' 'round
We're Irishmen of high renown
That's the boys of Belfast
