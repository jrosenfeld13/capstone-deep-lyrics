It's in my heart. it's all better now. pick myself up off the ground. because i knew i could. and i knew i should. so come on just gather round. cause it's all better now. so stand up tall. cause it's all better now. see it all. it's in my heart. it's all better now. all the angels have come down. to kiss and tell me. to touch and quell me. to hold me to my word. calm me down. sit my ass right back down
