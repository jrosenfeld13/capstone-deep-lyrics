There is no god but god
There is no god but god
There is no god but the one true god
There is no god but the hidden god
There is no god
There is no god
There is no god
There is no god
Allahu akhbar!

In the name of the unmerciful the unbenevolent
In the name of the lord of the worlds
Owner of the day of judgement
Show us the path of those who earn anger
And those who go astray

As for the disbelievers
Whether thou warn them or warn them not
Is all one for them
They believe not
And theirs is an awful doom

Kafir!

O mankind
Worship the god whom thou hast created
Who hast created thee
And those who came before thee
O mankind
Thou sons of simian ancestors
Guard yourself against the fire
Prepared for disbelievers
Whose fuel is of men and stones

There is no god but god
There is no god but god
There is no god but the one true god
There is no god but the hidden god
There is no god
There is no god
There is no god
Allahu akhbar!
