In a library of fools
Where spectators hang their senses
It's alright, it's alright, yeah

In abeyance with the rules
The only sound is from the books they read
It's alright, it's alright, yeah

A tide of emotion that's supposed to show
If you surrender to me

At the tiny corporation
That's made of blood, sweat and tears
It's alright, it's alright, yeah

They cover every complication
That happens every year
And it's alright, it's alright, yeah

A tide of emotion that's supposed to show
If you surrender to me
