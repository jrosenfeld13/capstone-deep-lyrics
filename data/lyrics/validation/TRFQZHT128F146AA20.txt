That wave pulled me into your eyes
Through the greeny gray pebbles
And countless cathedrals arriving
That wave lift me into your mouth
Turning spires and spittle of pearls
To perplex the young diver
I flew down to the bottom of the sea
Where I questioned the fishes all about it
I was in heaven, address, Cloud Eleven
They danced and laughed spelling all I fell into was love
That wave carried me through your hair
Up from suffocate seaweed
The perfumed with cushions cascading
That wave pushed me into your skin
Where I bathed in the promises
Giddy with planets parading
I swam down to the bottom of the sky
Where I questioned the blue birds all about it
I was in heaven, address, Cloud Eleven
They danced and laughed spelling
All I fell into was love that wave
That wave pulled me right overboard
Into permanent morgasm
Emotional action painting
I flew down to the bottom of the sea
Where I questioned the fishes all about it
Well, I was in heaven, address, Cloud Eleven
They danced and laughed spelling all I fell into was love
