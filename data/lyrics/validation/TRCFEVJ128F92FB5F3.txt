Chains of love have tied my heart to you
Chains of love have made me feel so blue
Well now I'm just a prisoner, tell me what are you gonna do
Are you gonna leave me, are you gonna make me cry
Are you gonna love me, are you gonna make me cry
These chains of blues gonna haunt me until the day I die
Well if you're gonna leave me, please won't you set me free
Well if you're gonna leave me, please won't you set me free
I can't stay here with these chains
Unless you gonna stay right here with me
It's three o'clock in the morning, the moon is shining bright
It's three o'clock in the morning, the moon is shining bright
I'm just sittin' here wonderin', where can you be tonight
