See the lightning stars melting over my shoes All I have to do is to get rid of you Oh, Ive taken more than you could ever give!
When I appeared with my great gouts of fear Out of silence she crafted something new to disappear
Oh, what do you do when you just cant take it?!
Weve got bigger things to worry about now anything this world has to offer... I'd give it all
Then comes the fury of the lullaby Its gonna take you away if you cry Oh, what do you do when you just cant take it?!
Id give it all to you... yes I do!
