[Instrumental Intro]

Mamas pack their lunches, kids pack their guns
Wishing it will go away, but nothing's getting done
A shot heard around the world, when a mother's baby dies
We the people point our fingers, blame, and wonder why

Hey, hey, hey!

Face it and fight, or turn high tail and run
'Til it comes back again, just like the rising sun
Say they do "all they can", it's just another lie
The answer's plain to see, nobody wants to try

Hey, hey, hey!

Ooh, there's no recess and no rules in the school of life
If you listen very closely, you'll see what it's like
Have cool, will travel

[Instrumental Break]

Ooh, there's no recess and no rules in the school of life
And if you listen very closely, you'll see what it's like
Tell myself it ain't true, they just cannot see
A grown up or sewn up, the medicine's worse than the disease
I have cool, will travel
Have cool, will travel
Have cool, will travel

[Instrumental Outro]
