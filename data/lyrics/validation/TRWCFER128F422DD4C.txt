He's crawling from the bathroom
He's sinking in the carpet
He's looking out the window
Wishing that he could get outside

Chorus:
He's got a vague feeling that it could have been important
He's got a vague feeling that it could have been all

In the springtime cats have sex
In the springtime rats have sex
In the springtime fish have sex
But Our domestic animal stays very good indeed

He won't make an exhibition
He won't watch your television
He won't drink your new French wine
And he won't steal your convertible razorblades
And he won't care about the stuff you eat
Because he hasn't got time
He's still considering
Still considering

Chorus

Happy animal in the spring
Happy animal in the spring
Domestic animal in the spring
