I know momma loved me
I reckoned that dad
Thought I was a pretty good kid
I've been blamed but I'm not ashed
Of a couple of things I did

I learned the golden rule
Before I started to school
Like ever'y little young'n should do
But what am I worth on God's great earth
If I'm not worth nothing to you

What am I worth here on earth
Darling, If I can't have you
I just can't find no peace of mind
With anything that I do

I don't know why you made me cry
Honey, won't you give me a clue
What am I worth on God's great earth
If I'm not worth nothing to you

Instrumental

I might get sent to be president
Yes, I'm sure I could do it for you
They would feature my face all over the place
For all the good thing I do

I might get my name in the hall of fame
Or even in the book of who's who
But what am I worth on God's great earth
If I'm mot worth anything to you

What am I worth here on earth
Darling, If I can't have you
I just can't find no peace of mind
With anything that I do

I don't know why you made me cry
Honey, won't you give me a clue
What am I worth on God's great earth
If I'm not worth nothing to you...
