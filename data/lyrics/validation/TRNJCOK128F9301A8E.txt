You fed his bod a metal rod
You turned into a fuselage
You took a right on the new highway
And did a waltz on his jelly laze
Rising rising

When your pictures is American icons rising rising
Run to the riches and you tear up your shell ronde creatures
And day-glo kids with your riders on top too riding riding
If you're like me it's not too late

You fantasize about the page
A two-horse carriage garage
Take the reins down the new highway
A culvert down to the ducks and drakes
Rising rising
Looking mighty fake with your dinosaur tailbone
Flizing flizing
Soon you'll go to this killing time
Blondie creature
Multiple gear with his eyes all around you
Rying rying
If you're like me it's not too late
