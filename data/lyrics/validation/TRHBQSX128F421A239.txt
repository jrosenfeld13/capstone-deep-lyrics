Oooohhh-ooohhh-ooohhhh...
Oooohhh-ooohhh...

Lost again, somebody tell me how to get there
'Cause I can't take another hand shake or another blank stare
Thought I knew what I had to do to get through to you
Guess your head is thicker than I thought
You know I am starting to think that it might be you
'Cause I know you've got a lot of things and people you look to
Do you believe that I never see what you're doing to me
I'll keep smiling till the door closes behind me

I know where I wanna go
But I just don't know
No, I just don't know how to get there

I know where I wanna go
But I just don't know
No, I just don't know how to get there

Lost again, somebody tell me how to get there
If I hit another detour I'm afraid that I won't care
Who'd have thought that I'd have bought the expectations
That gold road probably just leads straight to hell
And once I'm there are you gonna care or conveniently look away
I don't think I want us to fall off and die that way
Do you believe that I never see what you're doing to me
I'll keep smiling till the door closes behind me

I know where I wanna go
But I just don't know
No, I just don't know how to get there

I know where I wanna go
But I just don't know
No, I just don't know how to get there

I know where I wanna go
But I just don't know
No, I just don't know how to get there

I know where I wanna go
But I just don't know
No, I just don't know how to get there

Do you (do you)
Do you (do you)
Do you (do you)
Do you (do you)
Do you (do you)
Do you (do you)
Do you (do you)
Do you...tell me if you do!
