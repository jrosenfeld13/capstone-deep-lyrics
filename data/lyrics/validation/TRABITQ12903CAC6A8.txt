All I want, all I need
You hold all these things
In Your hands, oh Lord
I can wish I may, or wish I might
But I won't find it in the stars tonight
It's in Your hands, oh Lord

All I want is You
All I need is You

Chorus
I'm holding on to the center of Your love
Cause everything reminds me of You
I open up, cause Your always enough
All I want is You
All I need is You

Take my heart, take my mind
I want to leave this world behind
I give You everything
You're the reason I'm alive today
I throw my cares away
As I stand to shout and sing

Bridge
You're everything to me
I'm nothing without You
You're everything I love
There's no love without You
And every part of me cries for You
