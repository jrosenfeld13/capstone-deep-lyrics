What The Heck Richard Speck; Eight Nurses You Wrec
( Richard Speck )
Richard Speck stayed in Chicago
He took some pills and drank some alcohol
He tried to wreck nine nurses but one of them got away
He's rotting now in jail, that's the way he's gonna pay
Richard Speck lives, off our taxes he thrives
He strangled and stabbed eight nurses that night
Richard Speck lives, we pay for his meals
Convicted for eight student nurses he killed
What the heck Richard Speck, eight nurses you wrecked
What the heck Richard Speck, eight nurses you wrecked
He tied them up inside of a room
And one by one he causes them much GLOOM
He stabbed and strangled eight nurses but one of them got away
Twelve hundred years in jail, that's the way he's gonna pay
In jail Richard died, no longer alive
And he lived off our taxes several years of his life
Richard Speck lived, we payed for his meals
Convicted for eight student nurses he killed
What the heck Richard Speck, eight nurses you wrecked
What the heck Richard Speck, eight nurses you wrecked
