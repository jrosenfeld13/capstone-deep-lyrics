(OK...1,2,3,4....)
How are you doing tonight?
Pull the blankets tight
The drunks shout outside your window
Light scrapes across your wall
Think of me
It never goes away
Think of me, I know
It never goes away

How are you doing tonight?
I don't wanna fight
Just walked these miles
To be passing by
Just to say
That I'm okay
For you to see the state of me
I know I said
We'd better get home to bed
And I was the one
I always stayed out so late
Always forgiving
My inconsideration
It's a different story
When you can never go home again
I'm home, home again

My hands came back today
Finally set themselves free
No more fists on the end of my arms
Just these hands, trembling
Think of me
It never goes away
Think of me
The way I used to be
I know I said
We'd better get home to bed
And I was the one
I always stayed out so late
Always forgiving
My inconsideration
It's a different story
When you can never go home again
I'm home, home again
