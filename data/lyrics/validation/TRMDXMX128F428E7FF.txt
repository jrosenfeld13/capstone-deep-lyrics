The first Noel the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay

In fields where they
Lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night
That was so deep
Noel, Noel
Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east, beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night
Noel, Noel
Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came
From the country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star
Wherever it went
Noel, Noel
Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
Noel, Noel
Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
Born is the King of Israel
