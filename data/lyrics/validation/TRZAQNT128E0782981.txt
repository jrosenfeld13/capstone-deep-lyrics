Over these green hills
Blue electric light
Always in my blood
Forever in my eyes

Black window space
A basket made of flax
Broken mirror view
Let your eyes relax

Mist
On my glass
Watch it all
Come to pass
Once again
We'll breathe in the view
It's part of me
Part of you

Now my voice won't sing
And my tears won't cry
Your disciple waits
For any good advice

Our place in time
It's not set in stone
And we'll still be here
Where the cows come home

Mist
On the glass
Watch it all
Come to pass
Once again
We'll breathe in the view
It's part of me
Part of you

And it has to be clear
Inside my head
And I'm still in a dream
In a dream that won't end

Once again
We'll breathe in the view
It's part of me
Part of you

Mist
On the glass
Watch it all
Come to pass
Once again
We'll breathe in the view
It's part of me
And part of you

And it has to be clear
It has to be clear
Inside my head
