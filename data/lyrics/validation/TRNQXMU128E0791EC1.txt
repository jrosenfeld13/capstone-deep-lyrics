[Intro]
Butterflies inside...
You give me butterflies inside (x6)

[Verse 1]
All you gotta do is just walk away and pass me by
Don't acknowledge my smile yeah
When I try to say hello to you, yeah
And all you gotta do is not answer my calls when I'm tryna get through
To keep me wondering why and all I can do is sigh
I just wanna touch you

[Chorus]
I just want to touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside
Inside and I...

[Verse 2]
All I gotta say is that I must be dreaming
Can't be real
You're not here with me
I can feel you near to me
So I caress you let you taste us
Just so blissful listen I would give anything babe
Make my dream come true, oh, baby you give me butterflies

[Chorus]
I just wanna touch and kiss
And i wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies
Butterflies inside
You give me butterflies ooh

I just wanna touch and kiss
And i wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies
Butterflies inside
You give me butterflies ooh

[Bridge]
If you will take my hand, baby
I will show you
Guide you to the light babe
If you will be my love
Baby I will love you
Love you till the end of time

[Chorus x3]
Touch and kiss
Said I wish that I could be with you tonight
(Wish I could be with you tonight babe)
You give me butterflies
Inside...
