What is she covering up?
What is she lying about?
Uh oh, she's hesitating
And she's using slow words, I know
But she's moving fast

Why is this happening now
Why does this happen to me
All the time?

Don't give up on me
(Love)
And I won't give up on you
(Love)

Squeeze me, till I can't breathe
And lets just lie here in oblivion
I can't believe in one of us
I can't know how long
This love will last

Stay up in bed with me
Stay up and play with me
All day long

Don't give up on me
(Love)
And I won't give up on you
(Love)
I get to wait for the baby
(Love me girl)

Nothing is wrong, what are you scared of?
Nothing is wrong, what are you scared of?
Nothing is wrong, what are you scared of?
Nothing is wrong, what are you scared of?
Nothing is wrong, what are you scared of?

Squeeze me, till I can't breathe
And let's just lie here in oblivion
I can't believe in one of us
I can't know how long
This love will last

Stay up in bed with me
Stay up and play with me
All day long

Don't give up on me
(Love)
And I won't give up on you
(Love)
I get to wait for the baby
(Love me girl)

Love me girl
