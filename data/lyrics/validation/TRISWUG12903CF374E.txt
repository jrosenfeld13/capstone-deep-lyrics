OOH

Give me that opener, pass me that beer
C'mon move your ass on out of here
Well I guess you know I need some money
But you are just too fat and ugly

C'mon shake
Oop, Well let's shake
C'mon shake
Yeah baby let's shake

(music)

Well you can't dance, can't keep up the beat
Well that's because you got size twelve feet
Well don't make me run, well don't make me blush
You're just that girl I hate to touch

C'mon shake
Ooh baby let's shake
Yeah c'mon shake
Well let's shake

(Bop! We do the bop. Go... Push down. Woo! Yeppy. Yeppy. Yeah... Bla.)

Well every time I see you dance
Hey! Where'd you get those great big pants
Just one ear, well just one eye
Just one glance and I could die

So let's shake
Mmm let's shake
C'mon let's shake
Yeah baby let's shake

(Bop! We do the bop. I really lie. Act proud.)
(music)

Let's shake
Let's shake
Yow let's shake
C'mon baby let's shake
Let's shake!!
