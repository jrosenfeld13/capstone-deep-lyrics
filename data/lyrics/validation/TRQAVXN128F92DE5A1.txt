Life holds no fascination
Without you here with me
Each hour's eternity

And friends are small consolation
Talk doesn't ease the pain
The hurt can't be explained

Only a lonely heart knows
How the memory cuts like a knife
Since you walked out of my life
I'm half crazy day and night

And only a lonely heart knows
How the heartache, it grows and grows
Oh, how long does it take till the heartache goes?
Only a lonely, only a lonely heart knows

Time is a friend and an enemy
In time the hurt might end
Till then the walls close in

I'm so lost, I'm numbed by your leaving me
I sit alone and stare
You don't know till you've been there

And only a lonely heart knows
How the memory cuts like a knife
Since you walked out of my life
I'm half crazy day and night

And only a lonely heart knows
How the heartache, it grows and grows
Oh, how long does it take till the heartache goes?
Only a lonely, only a lonely heart knows

Tell me how long does it take till the heartache goes?
Only a lonely, only a lonely
Yes, only a lonely, only a lonely heart knows
