I used to cry myself to sleep at night
But that was all before she came
I thought love had to hurt to turn out right
But now she's here and it's not the same, just not the same

She fills me up, she gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
She's all I got, she's all I got in this world
But she's all the woman I need, I need, I, I needed

And in the morning when I kiss her eyes
She takes me down and she rocks me slow, yeah
And in the evening when the moon is high
She holds me close and she won't let go, she won't let go

She fills me up, she gives me love
More love than I've ever seen
She's all I got, she's all I got in this world
But she's all the woman that I need, yeah yeah, my need

Yeah yeah and I, and I, and I want the world to know
She fills me up, she gives me love
Bringing me more love than I've ever seen
She's all I've got, she's all I've got in the whole world
But she's all the woman that I need

She fills me up, she's the woman I love, woman I love, woman I love
And I've never, never seen, no way
True Lord, in this world
But she's all the woman that I need

She fills me up
She's in love again
