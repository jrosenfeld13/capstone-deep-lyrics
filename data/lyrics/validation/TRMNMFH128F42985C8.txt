[Chorus]
Attitude
You got some fucking attitude
I can't believe what you said to me
You got some attitude

[Verse 1]
Inside your fetal brain
There's probably a whore
If you don't shut your mouth
You're gonna feel the floor

[Chorus]
Attitude, the one you got, oh baby
Attitude, the one you got, oh baby
Attitude
Attitude

[Verse 2]
Inside your fetal brain
There's probably a whore
If you don't shut your mouth
You're gonna feel the floor

[Chorus]
Attitude
You got some fucking attitude
(Attitude) I can't believe what you said to me
You got some attitude

Attitude
You got some fucking attitude
(Attitude) I can't believe what you said to me
You got some attitude
