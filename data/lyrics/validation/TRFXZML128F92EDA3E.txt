[Verse 1]
Paul and Silas, bound in jail
Had no money for to go their bail
Keep your eyes on the prize, hold on

[Hook x2]
Hold on, (hold on), hold on, (hold on)
Keep your eyes on the prize, hold on

[Verse 2]
Paul and Silas began to shout
Doors popped open, and all walked out
Keep your eyes on the prize, hold on

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Well, the only chains we can stand
Are the chains of hand in hand
Keep your eyes on the prize, hold on

Got my hand on the freedom plow
Wouldn't take nothing for my journey now
Keep your eyes on the prize, hold on!

[Hook x2]

[Interlude]

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
