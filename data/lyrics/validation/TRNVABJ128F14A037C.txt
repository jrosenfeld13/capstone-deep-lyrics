I never thought that Love could be so cruel
I never thought that I could be such a fool
We had it all and then you walked away
And now I am holding out for yesterday
Running around surching loving every night
I am walking through the cold, cold city lights
That's everything that's left for me to do
I guess I never can?t stop loving you
Show me now what you feel for me
Deep inside you can set me free
Take me out of this misery
Come back an stay!
Come back an stay!
Love is a soldier, Love is a soldier
Breaking your heart, breaking you heart
Love is a soldier, Love is a soldier
It?s tearin apart, It?s tearin apart
Love is a soldier, Love is a soldier
Breaking your heart, breaking you heart
Love is a soldier, Love is a soldier
It?s tearin apart, It?s tearin apart
Love is a soldier, Love is a soldier
Breaking your heart, breaking you heart
Love is a soldier, Love is a soldier
It?s tearin apart, Love will tear us apart!

Running around surching loving every night

That's everything that's left for me to do
I guess I never can?t stop loving you
Show me now what you feel for me
Deep inside you can set me free
Take me out of this misery
Come back an stay!
Come back an stay!
Love is a soldier, Love is a soldier
Breaking your heart, breaking you heart
Love is a soldier, Love is a soldier
It?s tearin apart, It?s tearin apart
Love is a soldier, Love is a soldier
Breaking your heart, breaking you heart
Love is a soldier, Love is a soldier
It?s tearin apart, Love will tear us apart!
