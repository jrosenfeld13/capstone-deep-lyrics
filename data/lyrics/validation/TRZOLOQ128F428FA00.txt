Suffocation
Suffocate with no room to breath, to breath

Forgive us for 'now' is too late
This is not an American dream
This is no longer an American dream
This is no longer an American dream (American dream)

We are trying to breath
We are trying to breath underwater
We are trying to breath
We are trying to breath underwater

The few, the proud, no longer sing their song
One nation under God, it's us against the world
One nation under God, it's us against the world
It's us against the world, Us against the world
It's us against the world, Us against the world

Ohhhhh

We've cut the tongue from society
Forcing consumption, never hearing "no"

We've brainwashed our children to believe this is destiny
Spoiled rotten, still counting their 1, 2, 3's
We've brainwashed our children to believe this is destiny
Spoiled rotten, still counting their 1, 2, 3's
Yeaaaaa

Forgive us for 'now' is too late
Forgive us for fueling the flame

This is not an American dream any longer
As we've become spoiled, rotten, counting our 1, 2, 3's

Disease infesting our young
Beauty has become the beast
Beauty has become the beast
Beauty has become the beast
Beauty has become the beast
Beauty has become the beast
