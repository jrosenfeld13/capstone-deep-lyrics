[Verse 1]
One in a million mama that's good enough for me
And you can't make me stay here anyway now that I'm 18
With everything she had in a duffle bag she set out to show the world
She was more then just a homecoming queen and daddy's little girl

In a cloud of dust on a Greyhound bus she crossed the Cook County line
Slept all the way to Nashville, big dreams running through her mind
She said sure as I'm breathing I'm going to be a big someday
Yeah, she was jumping right into the deep end on a leap of sweet blind faith

[Chorus]
It's about hoping
It's about dreaming
It's about never not believing
It's about taking a walk on the wire and never looking down
It's about living instead of dying
It's about spreading your wings and flying
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's all about trying

[Verse 2]
It's been six years since she left home and she hasn't made it big yet
Oh but there's no second guessing baby, shes got no regrets
She still works late shift down at the Greasy Spoon cafe
When she brings you out your milkshake you just might hear her say

[Chorus]

It's not whether you win or lose
It's getting in the game

[Chorus]

It's about hoping
It's about dreaming
It's about never not believing
It's about taking a walk out on the wire and never looking down
It's all about trying
