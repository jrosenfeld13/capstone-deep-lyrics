We live we love we laugh we cry
We dream we build we learn we die
Live
Die

We talk we scream we fight we're sly
We maim we kill we don't care why
Live
Die

Hear the screaming
Watch them weeping
Read the story
Buy the movie
Then taste of ice-cream
And watch them all die

Piranhas, pariahs and self-styled messiahs
Scrabble for airtime on towers of babble
They sell us the truth while they're feeding us lies
They show us the world how they'd like it to be
Through camera eyes

Fire up the towers of babble
Capture the minds of the mindless
Fire up the towers of babble
You don't need to resort to violence

Climb up the towers of babble
Capture the minds of the mindless
Climb up the towers of babble
You don't need to resort to violence

We live we love we laugh we cry

Tear down the towers of babble
Freeing the minds of the mindless
Tear down the towers of babble
Give them the key to independence
