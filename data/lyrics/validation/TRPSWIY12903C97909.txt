[Intro]
When the twilight is gone
And no songbirds are singing
When the twilight is gone
You come into my heart
And here in my heart you will stay
While I pray

[Verse 1]
My prayer
Is to linger with you
At the end of the day
In a dream that's divine

[Verse 2]
My prayer
Is a rapture in blue
With the world far away
And your lips close to mine

[Bridge]
Tonight
While our hearts are aglow
Oh tell me the words
That I'm longing to know

[Verse 3]
My prayer
And the answer you give
May they still be the same
For as long as we live
That you'll always be there
At the end of my prayer
