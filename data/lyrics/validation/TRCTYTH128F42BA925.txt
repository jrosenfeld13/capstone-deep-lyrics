I can't get this taste
Out of my brain
Gemeni you and I make it home

Did you believe a gerald and free
That you would die by my side or all alone

O where there is life
I'll be alright
But dont do anything you wouldn't do

Show me where, it hurts
I'll be there, to ease your pain
I'll be the man to dry your eyes

A bit too cold
A bit too old
Fasion yes, but dont you dress because of me

By my acount, a teenage shout
Pull me back on the wreck where im from

Show me where, it hurts
I'll be there, to ease your pain
I'll be the man to dry your eyes

I wouldn't mind the sunshine
Carmalized for me oh my
I think its time you pull the light
