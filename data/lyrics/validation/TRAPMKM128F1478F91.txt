Yesterday and tomorrow
New born baby, no more sorrow

I feel the charge of shooting stars when I'm near you
Cosmic rays shoot through my body while we play
I'm forever changed when I'm all alone with you

[Chorus:]
I'll never get over the thrill of this love
I'll never get over the thrill of this love
I'll never get over the thrill of this love
I'll never get over the thrill of this love

I felt the shock, my heart stopped... when I saw you
I heard the screams of a new reckoning
From the edge of the bed
And I'm moved when you try to do the things I do

And I can't get enough
I just can't get enough

[Chorus]
Shout it out, I'm so proud I can see myself in your love
Shout it out! Shout it out
Don't know how we ever made it this far without you around
Shout it out! Shout it out

Shout it out, I'm so proud I can see myself in your love
Shout it out! Shout it out
Don't know how we ever made it this far without you around

I can't get enough
I just can't get enough of your love
