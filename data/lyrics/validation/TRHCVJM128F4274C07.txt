[Verse 1]
Tried to write a letter
To tell you how I feel
All I kept on writing
Was slipping on the tears from the day
And I was young and brave
Now all these hotel lobbies
Are filled what's to me?
Lonely midnight drivers
Drifting out to sea, yea
And all those late night lovers
Don't make things better to me

[Chorus]
So let it roll in me
Let it roll in you
Let it roll in me
Let it roll back into when I had you

[Verse 2]
Now I watch the snow come calling
And I celebrate the spring
I feel the falls keep falling
And when the summers come
I will pretend that I don't notice
This is when I notice most of all

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Is all you ever wanted from me
Was the time to understand and
All I ever wanted from you
Was to see me shining for you
And I wish that I could be back
In the day that I could say

[Chorus]
