Anything fades
And withers away
Tomorrow is past
To close to stay
I've never heard that voice before, nevermore
I've been trying to tease you
I've been trying to please you
How can I make your time worthwhile?

Life's to be lived
The road shall be long
Let's sing our fate
A happy song

I wanna be a clown
I wanna be a clown
Fool around
And make you laugh
And make you laugh

Tata, tata, tata, tatada
Tata, tata, tata, tatada

Now what can I do
To catch a smile
Forever young
In sweet desire
It's but a law
We have to break
There must be more ways
We can take
How can I blame you
For I cannot save you
How can I make your time worthwhile?

The bitterest taste
Of the years I waste
Is that I spare my mind
Of what remains

I wanna be a clown
I wanna be a clown
Fool around
And make you laugh
And make you laugh

I wanna be a clown.. oohii
I wanna be a clown.. oohii

I wanna be a clown
I wanna be a clown
Fool around
And make you laugh

Tata, tata, tata, tatada
Clown...
