It's pretty late at night
I travel high with closed eyes
Having lost sense of time
I cannot focus my mind
Beyond the time and space
Comfortably numb and dazed
Don't you wake me my friend
Don't want this journey to end

With the sun in mind
I can ride the tide
Ain't no slave of time
Leaving all behind

Believing just what you see
You may never be free
Should I be dreaming my friend
Don't bother to understand
