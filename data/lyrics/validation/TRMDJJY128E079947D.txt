[Verse 1: Johnny Gill + (New Edition)]
I'm standing here
All alone
This nights about to end
(I'm looking for somebody)
To wil' out with me
Sexually
Come with me, baby
Girl, it's been long
Close the door
Shed your clothes for me nice and slow
Will you dance for me?
Freak for me?
Give it to me
All I wanna know...

[Chorus: New Edition + (Johnny)]
Who's gonna come home with me tonight?
(Will you come home with me tonight)
Who's gonna lay her body next to mine?
(Lay your body down next to mine)
Who's gonna come home with me tonight? (aww baby)
Tell me who, baby (tell me, baby, yeah yeah)
I just wanna know who

[Verse 2: Johnny]
Here's the part where I can make your body start to tremble
(no no no no no)
Girl your body's tight
That's why I decide
To choose you tonight, mmm...
Jump in my bed so I can take you undercover
Making love room to room until the sun's up
Then I'll let you fall asleep naked on me
This is our bedroom scene
Baby baby baby baby baby baby baby...

[Chorus: New Edition + (Johnny)]
Who's gonna come home with me tonight?
(It's alright, will you come home, come home?)
Who's gonna lay her body next to mine?
(Who's gonna give all the love that I need?)
Who's gonna come home with me tonight (One little question...)
Tell me who, baby (Who? Is it you, baby? Is it you, baby?)
I just wanna know who

[Bridge: New Edition + (Johnny)]
Get ready to take my love tonight (Alright)
(See, 'cause I'm gonna take you all the way down tonight)
Get ready for what a man feels like
(See, I want to wrap my arms around you tonight
And I want you to feel my love)
Get ready to taste my love, every drop
'Cause I run deep, so deep so deep inside your love

[Johnny]
I got one question baby
If you're ready to feel it and taste it
Girl, come on and take it

[Chorus: New Edition + (Johnny)]
Who's gonna come home with me tonight (come on come on come on baby)
Who's gonna lay her body next to mine?
(I swear the things I'll do to you)
Who's gonna come home with me tonight
(Nobody else will do to you tonight)
Tell me who, baby (Come on, come on, come on)
I just wanna know who

Who's gonna come home with me tonight?
(It's all about you tonight)
Who's gonna lay her body next to mine?
(All the things that you think that you want
That you think that you need tonight)
Who's gonna come home with me?
(I wanna know tonight, I gotta know tonight, somebody tell me tonight)
Tell me who, baby
I just wanna know who

Ooh sugar, no, no...
