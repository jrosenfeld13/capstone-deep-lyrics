Talk about your peace of mind
The one I found so hard to find
Mosquito stuck in amber mine
Don't want my body trapped in time

As I wait for skies to clear
Don't seem to mind if I shed a tear
From time to time, I'm swallowed whole
And in a wink spat on the floor

Will I follow you home again

How's it feel to disappear
Like seriously, just disappear
And take a stab from papa's spear
Getting drunk on rotten air

Bite my tongue, I taste your blood
Never thought that I could bite hard enough
Eyes of fire in your skull
You've got the kind of eyes that burns goose flesh off

Oh your charm is getting old
This kind of love ain't bought or sold
I know you tried if truth be told
But I still cast you to a bed of coal

Will I follow you home again
Bite my tongue, I taste your blood
Never thought that I could bite hard enough
