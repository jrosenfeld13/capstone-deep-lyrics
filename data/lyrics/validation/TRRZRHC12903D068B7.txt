I don't know what's going on
I don't know what's right or wrong
All my senses turning on
Don't know what I've become

Blaming fingers everywhere
Pretending they all care
Faking sorrow while you're falling
Cause inside they're scared

Empty minds keep on passing by
Lonely eyes going blind

Cold ground
'S causing sad sounds

Angry people's all I see
What a hopeless misery
Fading in the holy thoughts
Pretending to be free

Broken faith is what we're heading for
Soon we'll face another war

Cold ground
'S causing sad sounds, bad signs
Cold ground
'S causing sad sounds
