(Chad Brock/Buddy Brock/Phil Douglas)

Summer's gone, there's a cold chill in the air
But I know, it comes around again next year
The songbirds have all flown south
All I hear is the sound of silence in this house

Her laughter is being heard by someone else
And the good times all went with her when she left
Only the memories have survived
I wonder where love goes when it dies

Is there a place in heaven
For love that's gone to hell
Does it turn to dust, just like us
And live again somewhere else
Oh, there's no doubt spring will bring new life
I wonder where love goes when it dies

Is there a place in heaven
For love that's gone to hell
Does it turn to dust, just like us
And live again somewhere else
Oh, there's no doubt spring will bring new life
I wonder where love goes when it dies, when it dies
