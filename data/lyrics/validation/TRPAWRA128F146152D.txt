I had a chance for glory
Ooh, oh wouldn't tell you no lies
Same end on another story
I, I could have prophesied
I, I'd lose the prize
I'm gonna raid the future
Ooh, oh and I wanna know why
Everything is so temporary
Ooh, those I'll let you know eyes
I, I should have realized
I'm no hero, I won't get the glory
I'm the one who's left behind
I'm no hero, no place in your story
I'm the man who's left behind
I must have been blind
Must have been
I needed understanding
Ooh, oh you didn't sympathies
Left me here, left without a warning
Oh, you left me paralyzed
I, I should have realized
I'm no hero, I won't get the glory
I'm the one who's left behind
I'm no hero, no place in your story
I'm the man who's left behind
I must have been blind
Must have been, oh, so blind ahh, blind
I'm no hero, I won't get the glory
I'm the one who's left behind
I'm no hero, no place in your story
I'm the man who's left behind
I must have been blind, yeah
Must have been blind
Ooh, just must have been blind
I must have been blind
Ooh, just must have been
Just must have been blind
I must have been blind, can't see
Must have been blind
Just must have been blind
Ooh just must have been
Just must have been blind
