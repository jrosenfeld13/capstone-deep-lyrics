[Verse 1:]
Hangin' in the VIP
Saw him comin' to holla at me
A Playboy pique my curiosity
When he asked me if I wanted to trade

I was on my second drink and
Feelin' sexy
Now what is he thinkin'?
Bangin', dancin'
Which way is he swingin'?
What did he want from me?

[Chorus:]
Oh I
Ain't got no hang-ups
Oh I
Come to have fun tonight

Oh I
Might want to check him out
Oh I
As long as he can swing it my way

Oh I
Like his confidence
Oh I
So busy talklin' hit

Oh I
Hope he can handle this
Let's take it to the floor
Spend the whole night
Swingin'

[Verse 2:]
Be bop be bop be bop be ba
If you like swingin'
Get your hands up
Be bop be bop be bop be ba

If you like swingin'
Get your hands up
Be bop be bop be bop be ba

If you like swingin'
Get your hands up
Be bop be bop be bop be ba
If you like swingin'
Get your hands up

Fingers poppin'
Still boppin'
We get tired
But ain't no stoppin'

Come on with it
Sweat keeps droppin'
Rollin' off the side of my face
Dirty dancin'
Huggin' kissin'

All the fun I woulda been missin'
Didn't know he had it like this
And it's so good I want some more

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Don't need a tired cliche
If you wanna make a move my way
So keep them less restrained
It's about what you do
Not what you say

Cat daddy's obsessed
Tryin' to get under my dress
But I'm not imnpressed
Baby boy is dreamin' less
He's plannin' on swingin'
