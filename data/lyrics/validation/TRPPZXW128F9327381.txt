Masses of meat
Serving the fattest beings
Carnivores consume
Just for their pleasure
Eating without knowing
The sickening ways...
The product lived to die to feed
All those selfish needs
New breed of bacteria
Shall rule this place
Viruses transform to kill
The strongest of all
Eating all the living
Even "superior" human race
Tearing apart all we have built
Deserting the woods, decaying cities
Corpses lying on the streets
Dead bodies rot to contaminate
Diseases from the air, water and skin
Butchering every single living thing
Consumed
Contaminated
Inflected and completely destroyed
