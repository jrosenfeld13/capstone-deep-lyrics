Asshole, row your boat ashore
You won't need those paddles anymore
Skyscrapers are descending and becoming level
Gold giants bow in unison
Don't hold your tongue, don't hold your tongue
Just level with me
We'll float these stilts out with these crutches
And make discoveries with free hands
We shook hands, then we locked eyes
But, I could not help but forget
That gold lining in your eye
Oh, you follow signs
Yeah, you were so blind
They're always telling you to, "Hold strong defender, hold strong defender, be that condescending depender"
When I close my eyes, the time still flew by
But, the words stood still in my mind
Don't hold your tongue, don't hold your tongue
Just level with me
