I've got to control my ups and downs
I've got to control your perfect lies
You say that my downs are on the outside
Forced to my skin like clothes

Try to take your love
And throw it back in place
Try to take your love
And throw it back in place

But you are so strong when it all comes down
You dress up shut and throw up
But I keep myself in my state
Yeah I keep myself in my state

Try to take your love
And throw it back in place
Try to take your love
And throw it back in place

She said I'm sorry that you lost your job
But I've been trying this for far too long now
I've been trying this for far too long now
