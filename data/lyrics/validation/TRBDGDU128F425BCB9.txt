I read it in your pigface
I read it in your smile
I read it in your paper
I read it in your lies

You're a waitin' nightmare
And you deliver pain
You're a psychopath and you are
You are insane

Pig machine
Open up your door
Pig machine
Electronic war
Pig machine
Open up your door
You're a pig machine

I came to face your insults
I came to read my rights
I came to see you suffer and I
I came to see your eyes

Don't need the ten commandments
I don't need the law
You are a marionette and you are
You are a whore

Pig machine
Open up your door
Pig machine
Electronic war
Pig machine
Open up your door
You're a pig machine

Your lies; your lies
Your lies are so bizarre (x2)

I am the pig commander
I go for the throat
I use sabotage and I use
I use force

Pig machine
Open up your door
Pig machine
Electronic war
Pig machine
Open up you whore
You're a pig machine
