It's murda, you know when we come
Niggas it's murda, ain't nowhere to hide
It's murda, ain't no where to run
Niggas it's murda, I-N-C is gon ride tonight

[Chink Santana]
I'm from the city where the good die young and
Niggas strugglin, drugs smuglin, youngins and keep the slugs cuplin
Hustlin hard, niggas cussin guard for they scars
To many niggas in the back of them cars
It like a bird dead trapped in them bars
But it ain't no thang, I got cookies change
And fame just a way of making plans
Ho's been hollerin my name (Santana)
I never been fuckin wit no snitches still
Quick wit barettas, wit hammers quick to get wit ya
Now a nigga hit up, clipped up
And real motherfucker know we all about stackin those digits
The reason I spit these lyrics bitches is to bring the word to the district
Who is it?
How to get connected comin from that gritty city
When nothin but a grind, and no time to rhyme
And my nigga D.O. visit
And you don't really wanna fuck wit Chink
And I don't even get a chance to blink
When I catch a lil' third nigga jumpin out the escalade
Iced out wit a black mink (Blingin lingin)
And to my niggas wonderin why they can't find me
And why come by when they come by kid
Cuz I be up in the wide city wit I.G., Biiiitch

You gon get grown now, wit bitches so loud

Heavy hittas, heavin spittin you want us? come get us
Natural born killers, now you feel us girl
Shot is flyin, no autumn ridin, you keep on hidin
Nigga put your time in
D.O. Cannon known for makin it happen
Trucks pull up we pop off boy what's crackin, you heard!
You know my crew it dirty, stay out my bentley shorty

Yeah, nigga watch out murda burner fo'-sho
Wit that New York city ??? out
Gritty ??? ???, semi charged out, remi car swirved
In and out of lanes
So we thuggin and hustlin, pistol lover wit alot of aim
Put it up and pop up your frame
Betta watch the game
Cuz we here to take it, ain't a nigga gon make us get sidetracked
From this paper, we fire gats
Put it in end wit tai cats
And that shit you decribe as rap
Is my life and I'll ride wit that
Mean wit ross wit the baby mack
Bitches be lovin the way we act
In the club when it's crazy packed
From Atlanta to Cacilac
Who the fuck wanna fuck wit that? Hit him a bad position
Where his moma gon see homey spillin blood on the curb
Sayin they last words
The undispuited under dog
And we comin wit all intentions to win and crush em all
If you see I.G. nigga respect the master boss
When we ride (Ain't no where to run, ain't where to hide)
Somebody gotta die *Echo's out*
