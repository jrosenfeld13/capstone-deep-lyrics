Does it bother you, did it not obey you?
Does it anger you, did it not please you?

Does it bother you, did it not consider you?
Is it killing you, did it not care for you?

(I pray) these sores will never heal
Come touch with broken skin
I pray these wounds will never hurt
Come touch this broken skin

Did you want to pull the strings?
Become the master of all things?
And punish this, my gravest sin
Bitter enemy of this, my broken skin

You can never let this go
Your superficial mind torments you so
Bow down and admit defeat
Old, weak and obsolete

(I pray) these sores will never heal
Come touch with broken skin
I pray these wounds will never hurt
Come touch this broken skin

Gone too far, I've gone too far, is this me?
I am not me, am I somebody else?
I am not me, I wanna be myself
