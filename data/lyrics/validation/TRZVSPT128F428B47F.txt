I've been washed out and left to dry
There's nothing left for you to buy
I only want what's dry and smooth
I only like things twice removed

I devoured you before but I've gone sour
You want more, I blame my nerves
I'm a lot but I deserve what I got

So you better hold me at bay
Erase me for another day
And when it's time to send me home
I'll drain your eyes and claim your bones
