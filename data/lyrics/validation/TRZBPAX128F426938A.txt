I was waltzing with my darlin' to the Tennessee waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
I introduced her to my loved one and while they were waltzing
My friend stole my sweet heart from me

I remember the night and the Tennessee waltz
Now I know just how much I have lost
Yes, I lost my little darlin' the night they were playing
The beautiful Tennessee waltz

I remember the night and the Tennessee waltz
Now I know just how much I have lost
Yes, I lost my little darlin' the night they were playing
The beautiful, beautiful Tennessee waltz, Tennessee waltz
