You are my treasure and my darling I possess
The world's greater treasure the treasure of happiness
Your smiles are my pearls and your ruby lips are beyond compare
Your eyes are my diamonds and my gold is the gold in your hair
Earth has its treasure of fabulous wealth untold
And who can measure the treasure the oceans hold
But whether it be underneath the sea or the sky above
There is no treasure like the treasure of your love

There was a time when I thought I could find happiness in silver and gold
And I longed for fame and wordly acclaim
And I've hungered for these things filled my very soul
But then you came along and now I know I was wrong
For in your eyes I can see the greatest treasure in all the world
The treasure of your love for me
Earth has its treasure...
