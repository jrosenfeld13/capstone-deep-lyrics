Lady december my heart is all yours
Beats like a drum
I've never asked you, but do you wear loads
When it goes far below?

You lay down your cloak of snow
And it spreads all over
Lend me you hand and I'll give you a
Rush of the heat

(chorus)
Forgive n' forget
Forgive n' forget

Mission maid sowing her seeds
Working her way through the frost
This she said she does to bring some hope
For the oncoming season (what spring will bring)

She feeds me something that looks really old
But it tastes brand new (sweet cherry wine)
In the back of my head I hear children sing
About forgive n' forget (forgive n' forget)

Forgive n' forget
Forgive n' forget
When the gale wind blows
When the gale wind blows

Ladycember, ladycember, ladycember, ladycember
