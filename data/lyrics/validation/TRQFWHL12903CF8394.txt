I don't think you understand
I'm livin' in a dyin' land
In the basement hellfires fume
Death's sittin' in my livin' room
I try, try, try to make my way
I try, try, try to make my way
Make my way!

Some contition I been in
Vermin underneath my skin
Gonna go meet my old friend
And shake a hand with grief again
I try, try, try to make my way
I try, try, try to make my way
Make my way!

I been walkin' all around this hollow town
I seen people sink on down into the ground
Some folks wonder what lies underneath
Well I seen cannibals that got rotten meat between the teeth
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Gonna make my way
