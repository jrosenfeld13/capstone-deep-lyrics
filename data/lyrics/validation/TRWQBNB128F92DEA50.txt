What if the world was out of trouble
What if the world was out of pain
Would it be a world that's worth living in
Without anything that's worth a thing

What if the world was out of hope
To find a place where you belong
You say to yourself, you never make it that far
That mountain's too high and
The answer is just around the hill

Just around the hill
Take a look from the other side
Suddenly you'll see
There are many ways
Don't go too straight
Just walk around
Walk around that hill

What if the world was out of love
And all that we do, dont mean a thing
You take no chance, no offering
No suffering for anything
You're asking yourself, do I really want it that way
That mountain's too high and
The answer is just around the hill

Just around the hill
Take a look from the other side
Suddenly you'll see
There are many ways
Don't go too straight
Just walk around
Walk around that hill

Just around the hill
Take a look from the other side
Suddenly you'll see
There are many ways
Don't go too straight
Just walk around
Walk around that hill

Walk around that hill

Walk around that hill
