(chorus)
Got demon's chills
Though it's hot as Hell
Should've ignored Pepe's coupon
Should've stuck to Taco Bell

Pepe Gonzalez cooked up some bad food
Pepe Gonzalez didn't wash the dishes
Pepe Gonzalez didn't check the date on the sour cream
These homey little businesses are not what they seem

(repeat chorus)

Should have heeded the warning
Posted by the county on the door
I've been throwing up all morning
My stomach muscles are sore

(repeat chorus x2)
