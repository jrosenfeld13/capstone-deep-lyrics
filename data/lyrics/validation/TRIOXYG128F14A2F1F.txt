Come my love with me
Across the sea
Return to paradise
All in life worthwhile
Is on that isle
Return to paradise

Velvet moon above
Evil turns to love
Love evermore

Come with me and find
Your peace of mind
Return to paradise

Velvet moon above
Evil turns to love
Love evermore

Come with me and find
Your peace of mind
Return to paradise
