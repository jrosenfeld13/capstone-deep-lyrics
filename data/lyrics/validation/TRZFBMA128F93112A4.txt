I run, I run, I run but never get away, away, away
So I run, I run, I run but never get away, away, away
So I run but never get away
So I run but never get away
Chinatown jail break

Sitting in this cell these bars wide open
Stricken by the light, I fear the unspoken
The sun is my hope, my shelter and my guide
But I'd rather choose this lonely cell this hole where I hide
[Incomprehensible]

So I run, I run, I run but never get away, away, away
So I run, I run, I run but never get away, away, away
So I run but never get away
So I run but never get away
Chinatown jail break

The darkness of this hole has its claws in my soul
Who needs the warmth, I choose the cold
My freedom's not what I've conditioned my soul to want
I'm bound beneath the surface, this selfishness I flaunt
He's calling my name yet I choose the same now

So I run, I run, I run but never get away, away, away
So I run, I run, I run but never get away, away, away
So I run but never get away
So I run but never get away
Chinatown jail break
