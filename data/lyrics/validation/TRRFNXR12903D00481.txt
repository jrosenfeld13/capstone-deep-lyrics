So you won't tell me, where you've been up to now
I don't know, they've seen you come and go (oh)
You're well on your way but never leaving the chair
Playing scenes on T.V. screens
Watching widely to glimpse the full view
While the hours have their hands all over you
You say that you see me, well I see you too
I look behind, what do you find, all but an empty room
Scratching the surface and you can't get away
You've travelled far and so far you have nothing to say

[Chorus]
Scratching the surface
You better come up for air
A new experience to get you there
Scratching the surface
You better come up for air
Strapped to the media, a machine to fear
You're onto something then it slips right away
It's in your hand, follow through right in front of you
You say that you hear me, well I hear you too
My secret is no secret, outside of the tube
So you won't tell me, what you've done up to now
You're watching me, I'm watching you decide (oh)
Scratching the surface, you can't get away
You tried so hard, and so far you have nothing to say

[Repeat Chorus]
