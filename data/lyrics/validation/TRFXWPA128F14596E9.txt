She rises for work early each day
She's tough and she's straight and her words never ricochet
The wounds that you gave her she wears like a bouquet
It's crazy, joey, how she loves you come what may
And though you have gone she defends you like a lion
She says you're just going through some kind of phase
Strange talk of deserts, hong kong and red wine
Of kissing the moon in some beat up old plane

Chorus
Joe-joe-joey don't do it
Don't walk out into the night
Mus' ukuthatha ngamawala awuthula-nje
(don't fly off the handle, take it easy)
Joe-joe-joey don't do it
Love can give you wings to fly
Mus' ukuthatha ngamawala awuthula-nje
(don't fly off the handle, take it easy)
Joe-joe-joey don't do it
Awuthulanje

She loves the dreamers, but not the schemers
She loves the contradictions, but not the lies
She says every home ever built was built on tears
And she's not scared of crying but she is of wasted years
So she'll wait like a ship anchored beyond the harbour
And if there is no place to dock she'll head for the sea
And I don't know if you know but there's nothing much harder
Than facing a part of yourself which you know might have been

Chorus
Joe-joe-joey don't do it
Don't walk out into the night
Mus' ukuthatha ngamawala awuthula-nje
(don't fly off the handle, take it easy)
Joe-joe-joey don't do it
It'll be different in the morning light
Mus' ukuthatha ngamawala awuthula-nje
(don't fly off the handle, take it easy)
Joe-joe-joey don't do it
Awuthulanje

Just look around
Do you know where you're going
Such a sad seed I see you sowing
There is nothing to be found in the wind that's blowing
Just an empty sound, joey don't do it

Chorus
Joe-joe-joey don't do it
Don't walk out into the night
Mus' ukuthatha ngamawala awuthula-nje
(don't fly off the handle, take it easy)
Joe-joe-joey don't do it
Love can give you wings to fly
Mus' ukuthatha ngamawala awuthula-nje
(don't fly off the handle, take it easy)
Joe-joe-joey don't do it
Awuthula-nje
