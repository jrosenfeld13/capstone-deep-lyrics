[Verse 1]
Goodbye sorrow, hello tomorrow
Oh, let's dance again
While we're waiting for this plane to come in
And think of life and love again

[Chorus]
When it comes to life and love, darling you can count on me
Well, you got the combination, baby you got the key
When it comes to lovin' you, you can always count on me
When it comes to life and love, baby it will always be

[Verse 2]
Well, hello sunshine, goodbye rain
Well, I can't stop thinking about you again
Well, the strong man or a weak man, it's all the very same
When a woman takes a man inside the fire and flame

[Chorus]
When it comes to life and love, baby you can count on me
Well, you got the combination, baby you got the key
On the way to heaven's door, I love you more and more
When it comes to life and love, baby it will always be

[Bridge]
With all his gold and bracelets
And diamond rings
The matador has its problems
If he does the wrong thing in the ring

[Chorus]
But when it comes to life and love, baby you can count on me
Well you got the combination, baby you got the key
On the way to heaven's door, I'm gonna love you more and more
When it comes to life and love, baby it's you and me
Baby it will always be
