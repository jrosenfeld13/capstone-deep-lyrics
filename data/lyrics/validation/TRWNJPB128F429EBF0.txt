I don't want to breathe if I can't breathe here next to you
I am a middle-aged photographer with nothing left to shoot
I'm going to wipe away the dirt from all these dirty city blues
I'm going to try now
I'll try now not to lose

If the microphone is broken I will scream in the street
I will love you like the woodpecker can only love the tree
I feel the wasted afternoon trying to clamp its teeth in me
I'm going to try now
I'll try now to be free

Counting backwards from thirty to one
Everything looks perfect in the sun
I can't let you turn away and run

Oh come on now
Come on
Baby come on now

I see you sitting on the dock
So young and so carefree
Wrapped up in some summer story
Water covering your feet
Inside a time when I knew you
The same as you knew me
I'm going to try now
I'll try now to believe

I'll try now to believe
I'll try now to believe
I'll try now to believe
