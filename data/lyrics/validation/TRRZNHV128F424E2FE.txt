[Verse 1]
If I had just one tear running down your cheek
Maybe I could cope maybe I'd get some sleep
If I had just one moment at your expense
Maybe all my misery would be well spent

[Chorus]
Yeah....could you cry a little?
Lie just a little
Pretend that you're feeling a little more pain
I gave now I'm wanting
Something in return
So cry just a little for me

[Verse 2]
If your love could be caged
Honey I would hold the key
And conceal it underneath
The pile of lies you handed me
And you'd hunt those lies
They'd be all you'd ever find
And that'd be all you'd have to know
For me to be fine

[Chorus]
Yeah....can you cry a little?
Die just a little
And baby I would feel just a little less pain
I gave now I'm wanting
Something in return
So cry just a little for me

[Bridge]
Give it up baby
I hear you're doing fine
Nothing's going save me
I can see it it your eyes
Some kind of heartache
Honey, give it a try
I don't want pity
I just want what is mine

[Chorus]
Yeah....could you cry a little?
Lie just a little
Pretend that you're feeling a little more pain
I gave now I'm wanting
Something in return
So cry just a little for me

[Outro]
Yeah...cry just a little for me
Woo ooh, could you cry a little for me?
Yeah, yeah
