On a midnight voyage
One that has no ending
And it's sending me for things that I need

Far away from shore
Further than I've been before
But I feel the strain of the new sea

Dreams come and go and I sift through them
Love starts to grow from the thoughts that I find within them

On a midnight voyage
Searching for my pleasure
Reaching with my mind for something I've dreamed

Loves come and go and I dream through them
Dreams start to flow from the love that I find within them

On a midnight voyage
One that has no ending
And it's sending me right into my mind

On...

(John)
Uh, coming back through the earphones, can you turn the earphones off, please?
Turn your television set down, please
(Michelle)
And turn the air conditioning off
(John)
You can walk around the block twice
Three...

On...

(John)
You were late coming in
(Michelle)
I... was right with you
(John)
...sorry, my mistake
(Michelle)
Two... three... four...
(John)
Alright, you ready? One... two... three...

On a midnight voyage

(John)
You got it
(Cass)
You like that, Lou?

Come on, let's take a midnight voyage
Let me take you on a little trip
Come on, come on
Wah wah wah-oo, come on

Would you dare to take a little journey?
All aboard, all ashore
At your leisure, take a pleasure trip
I'm sure, you're sure
Everybody needs a pleasure trip
My friend, my friend
