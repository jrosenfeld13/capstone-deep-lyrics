The wages of sin is death
The gift of Jah is eternal life

In dis trial and tribulation
You must get a fight from the Babylonians
Who don't wanna see you do right

And it's hard to be good
So little children, be good on your life

I will praise to you, Jah, with all my heart
I will ever praise thee continually
It was the same say to ask
Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain tings?
It was the same false kings that set themselves
And the false rulers took counsel together
'Gainst His Imperial Majesty in PerIlie I Selassie I
Said, herein stands appointed to rule on earth just now
Jah came to break downpression, to set I n I the captive free
To drive away transgressors and to rule Iquality
Equal rights and justice stands for I n I all
To know, to know that all they that loveth Satan's kingdom must fall
Let hands and heart be pure and clean
To rally round the red, the gold and the green
And it's an art of God to be pure and clean, as I would say
To rally around the children Mount Zion I
With His Imperial Majesty ImperIlie I Selassie I
Whom they persecute today, as I would say
Yeah, Almighty God and King, as I would tell you
Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jahovah Jah Rastafari
Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jahoushah
Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords
Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, the Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah
Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah
Mark ye the bulwarks alone in his palaces
Jah shall break the ships of Tarshish with an east wind
Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, Jah, a Revelation!
All nations bow
And den the unfold in iration stand and de wicked that a fall
And only the fittest of the fittest of the fittest of the fittest of the
Fittest shall stand
So every day stand for the every day people, and I tell you
