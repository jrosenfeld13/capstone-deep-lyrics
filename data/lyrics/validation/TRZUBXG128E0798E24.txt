God ain't in my kitchen, and god ain't in my room
God ain't anywhere iv'e been
I'll tell yea, i think we're through

Ain't over here, ain't over there
Where...my gonna find that man

He can be found, he can be found
He might be over there
He might be underground

God ain't in my kitchen, and god ain't in my room
God ain't anywhere iv'e been
I'll tell yea, i think we're through

I looked over here
I looked over there
I can't find that man

Ring after six
Ring after six
He might be in
He might be under the ground

(Instumental)

Look over there
Look over here (with echo)
I can't find that man

He can be found
He can be found (with echo)
He might be over there
He might be underground

God ain't in my kitchen, and god ain't in my room
I'm gonna find that man if it takes all night
I'm gonna leave no stone unturned

Ain't over here, ain't over there, i can't find that man
I looked around, he can be found, he might be over there, i think he's underground

God ain't in my kitchen, and god ain't in my room (talked)
God ain't anywhere iv'e been, i think we're through (talked)

Ain't over here, ain't over there (with echo), tell me where I'll find that man
I looked around, ring after six (with echo), he might be in real late

God ain't in my kitchen, and god ain't in my ro-oo-oom
God ain't in the lampshade, i think we're safe
