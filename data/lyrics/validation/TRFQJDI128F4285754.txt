I dont wanna hear you say you're sorry
I dont wanna hear you say we can start all over again
I think you must think that I am stupid
Well, I might be stupid for the rest of my life
But I'll never be stupid to you again
I just want it all to go away
Yeah, Just go away
Yeah

{chorus}
I can see the light above me
I hear the sound of a brand new song
I don't wanna hear your preaches
Because I know what's right
I know what's wrong
I can see the light above me
I hear the sound of a brand new day
I'm not gonna settle for less
And I don't think things are ever gonna change
I just want it all to go away

I don't wanna hear about your damage
I don't wanna hear you say that you think I'm damaged too
Because I know you know that the damage in me
Is from the horrible things you say and do
I know that the damage in me comes from the damage in you
I just want it all to go away

{chorus}

Yeah, Just go away
Yeah, I don't wanna talk about it
I don't wanna hear your lies
I don't wanna talk about it
And I dont understand why you just do not realize

I don't wanna hear you say you're sorry
No, I don't wanna hear you say we can start all over again

Whoa!!

I can see the light above me
I hear the sound of a brand new song
And I don't wanna know your reasons
Cause I know what's right
I know what's wrong
I can see the light above me
I hear the sound of a brand new day
I can picture the lives without you
And I don't think things are ever gonna change
I just want it all to go away

I can see the light above me
Hear the sound of a brand new song
I don't wanna know your reasons
Cause I know what's right
I know what's wrong
