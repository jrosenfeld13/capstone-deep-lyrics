How can I make this a metaphor
For how you spit on this, for how you make me feel?
And yeah, your sorry gives as far as sorry gets
The riff is in, the riff is out again

I can't allow it, it's taking me over
I'm just not feeling the same
Shooting from the hip
Not really what I had on my side

So how can I make this a metaphor
For how I create this and how you criticize?
I'd like to spit it, spit it right at your face
But you can wipe it off, and that's not good enough

I can't allow it, it's taking me over
I'm just not feeling the same
Shooting from the hip
Not really what I had on my side

I can't allow it
I'm second guessing
I can't allow it
I'm tired of guessing
