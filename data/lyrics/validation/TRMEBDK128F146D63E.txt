I don't know why
I got it so bad
But somehow I find
Out of the fry pan
And into the fire
We're at it sooner
Buried our souls
Out of our headset
Ready to go

Slippin' and slide
I'm out of control
Crying'll hide my
Head in a hole
There's something about you I got to know

What I wanna know

Are you the one?
Are you the one?
Are you the -

Place to be found
Leavin' behind the noisy crowds
It's been a while since
You've come around
So let's make it worth the

Lights and the sounds
Pills and the spills
The drinks and the shouts!
It's turning out fine girl
What it's all about
There's just one more thing
I gotta find out
Before we go too far

What I wanna know
What I wanna know
What I wanna know is
(Whoa) Are you the one?
Are you the one?
Are you the one?
Are you the one?
Are you the one?
Are you the one?
Are you the one?
Are you the -
