Face to the ground
I'm not proud
Of all you must see
When you look at me
I tremble I thirst
As you wash the dirt
The dirt from my feet
And I see my need for thee

Chorus:
You lift me up
Holy One, Holy One
When I but come
Your enough, your enough
You fill me up
With your love, with your love
To you I run
Holy One, Holy One

All of the noise fades away
Like all of the fear
When your voice I hear
Your beckoning me
To come and just be
A child at your feet
Seeing my need for thee

Chorus

Your enough to satisfy
When the the world has left me only dry
Enough to save my life
When the world has left me here to die

Chorus
