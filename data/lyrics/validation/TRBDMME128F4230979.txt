Keaggy-Nichols

It was a question of proper perspective
Conjecture, simplified illusion
From your vantage point, you're taking advantage of the obvious conclusion

Hey, I'm gonna get you now, yes, I'm gonna get you now
I'm gonna get you now, hey, I'm gonna get you now

Just a matter of mistaken identity
Of the mad or the merely mistaken
But when the truth comes out and the facts roll in
Will the innocent be really forsaken ?

I'm gonna get you now, I'm gonna get you now
Listen, I'm gonna get you now, ooh, I'm gonna get you now

Now that you are seventeen
You are quite a beauty queen
Can you still remember when
You were on your daddy's knee ?
Sometime, anytime, it can do a person well
To recall, bring to mind love
You shared and you felt sometimes

Looking about, see where you stand on shaky ground
I'm speaking out loud, speaking out loud, you don't understand
Moving around, moving around, you get nowhere
You're sadly mistaken, I truly care

I'm gonna get you now, hey, I'm gonna get you now
Oh, I'm gonna get you now, well, I'm gonna get you now

Poetic pages, lyrical phrases
Prophetic sages still speaking from the past
Another analogy an unchained melody
One more apology for not keeping to the task, yeah

I'm gonna get you now, I'm gonna get you now
I'm gonna get you now, yeah, I'm gonna get you now

I'm gonna get you now, I'm gonna get you now
I'm gonna get you now, yeah, I'm gonna get you now
