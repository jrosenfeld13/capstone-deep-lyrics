(J.J. Cale)

Down the road, and up the hill
Round the bend, and behind the mill
When just a kid i used to go
To a place called shady grove
That is where i first met her
She changed my life with one just one word
She called it love but i don't know
I call it goin' down to shady grove

Shady grove, shady grove
In the middle of shady grove

Sometimes we'd steal away at night
All the same the feel was right
There was no city, there was no town
'cause shady grove was all around
We'd just lay down look up and see
The vast expanse of the old, old tree
When our love had turned to lust
Shady grove would cover us

Shady grove, shady grove
In the middle of shady grove

No one would ever come by
We were young and very shy
It seemed to wrap around us both
The place we called shady grove
Not long ago to my surprise
I seemed to have to go back
I went back to that same old spot
The trees were gone - it's a parking lot

Shady grove, shady grove
In the middle of shady grove
