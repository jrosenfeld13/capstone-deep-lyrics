Why must all people (Why?)
Keep on shooting and robbing
Why must must all people (Why?)
Keep on killing and fighting
No I, I and I would never try
Listen no, not I, I and I would never try

And why must the rich man (Why?)
Keep on hoarding all the money
And why must this poor man, (Why?)
My living it ain't very funny
No I, I and I will would never try
Listen no, not I, I and I would never
Try to live that way!

No, not I, I and I would never try
No, not I, I and I would never
And what did Jah show dem
I and I survive
They tried to stop this nation but
I and I survive
To chant down creation
I and I survive
An Israeli nation
I and I

Try to live that way!

So why must I and I
Want each way
Why, oh why
And why must I and I
Want each way
No I, not I, I and I will never try
Listen no, not I, I and I will never try

Without any money
And I survive
Without any food to eat
I and I survive
