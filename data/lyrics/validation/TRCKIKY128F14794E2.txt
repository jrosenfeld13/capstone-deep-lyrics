So let's not even try, you're right
Let's ball it up and throw it out the window
It's becoming all so clear in my mind
I've thought this thing through more like once or twice
I feel that this is my last request to you

Hold your breath, bottle it up and save it for the next one
It's safe to say we've been riding this all night
None of this will ever change your mind
It's never safe to rely on borrowed time
Now we're both undone and it's time to open up your eyes

[Chorus]
Consequence, it's our need in times like this
Feeling free is our modern disease
You're a classic disaster with a knack for losing your exterior
I'm so sick from staring at the mirror

This all needs a break from you
And I am used to this

I fear that I am just an end
So you'll play the mistaken
And I'll play the victim in our screenplay of desire
And I'm still writing the letters I'll never send

Running in circles I can't forget how many times
I've played this in my mind
Feeling free
Feeling free

[Chorus]
Consequence, it's our need in times like this
Feeling free is our modern disease
You're a classic disaster with a knack for losing your exterior
I'm so sick from staring at the mirror

This is my panic
This is my call to arms
This is my panic
This is my call to arms
