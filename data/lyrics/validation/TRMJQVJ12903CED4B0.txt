This is the story of a starry night
The faded glory of a new delight
One breathless meeting
Two lips repeating

Three precious words that were sweet but fleeting...
When stars are bright my heart keeps wondering why
Our first "goodnight" became our last goodbye
I pray that someday

Love will in some way
Bring back the story of a starry night...
