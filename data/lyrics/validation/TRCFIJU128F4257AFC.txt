Pain over my soul, another morning gleams outside the world
A new day's dew moves in, what do I breathe? What paralyses me?

As I inhale the cold air from the world's lung
I cast my being far away from me
In a crystal sphere on the ground I see my life
On my knees I kiss the death with all her beauty

In the frosty beginning of the autumn's dawn
When nature dies away from earth
White fog above the meadows is the border behind my eyes
Let me know that your downfall is my birth

Grey light shines through dead trees
Takes away the brown leaves in the end
My mother's garden sleeps its lust away
Her will lies motionless in my hands
