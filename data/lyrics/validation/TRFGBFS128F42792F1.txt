You've got a cardboard house
Live there all the time
Keep your memories tied with string
The face that many once-adored
Twenty years gone maybe more
Somewhere you lost your dream
Mama watched your every move
But now you're all alone
She's been gone for awhile
Daddy left some time ago
Fading years pass too slow
He's the only one, could make you smile

--oh, you're still crying--

Big city bound
Gonna make your mark
Read your name in the lights
All the ads and people say
Beauty lets you get your way
Tried your best to prove them right
But living on the streets ain't bad
Sad people make you glad
Pardon me, could you spare some change?

--oh, you're still crying--

Street corner girl
Watch the crowd go by
Fill your tin can with life
Summer days tend to slip away
Like your men you couldn't make them stay
Hard to choose, whiskey or a wife
Sometimes you wonder where's the end
Where you goin' where you been?
Happiness seems so hard to win
Most never care to find
Della Brown sees it all the time
Looking for that man
To make her smile again
