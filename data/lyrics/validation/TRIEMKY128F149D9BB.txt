George Jones & Tammy Wynette
(Both)
Will you travel down this road with me
Help me be the one I want to be
Help me see the thing I long to see
Will you travel down this road with me?
(Tammy)
Lifes a journey full of dreams
Hopes and possabilities
One of my dreams will come true
If I'm walkin' next to you
(Both)
Will you travel down this road with me
Help me be the one I want to be
Help me see the thing I long to see
Will you travel down this road with me?
--- Instrumental ---
(Tammy)
Many rivers we will cross
Many miles we will walk
Sharing laughter, sharing tears
Buildin' memories through the years
(Both)
Will you travel down this road with me
Help me be the one I want to be
Help me see the thing I long to see
Will you travel down this road with me?
Will you travel down this road with me
Help me be the one I want to be
Help me see the thing I long to see
Will you travel down this road with me?
Will you travel down this road with me?...
