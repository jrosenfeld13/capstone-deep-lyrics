Leaving his dreams and family
Leaving the life behind
Searching his will and
Searching his hope
Searching the peace of mind

Off to the valley
Off to the shore
Off to the seven seas
Wandering man and
Wandering soul
Wander in land of dreams

Now long and dark is the road
And heavy is the load
And you're about to fall
Into emptiness, your
Eyes are losing the light!

Take me into your arms
Take away
Take me with thee and flee
Calm restless heart and
Calm sirens call
Calm me before I fall!

Aching in me and
Ache in my veins
Ache from the venom sweet
Forgive me my love
I'm already lost
No more for you to keep

Now long and dark is the road
And heavy is the load
And you're about to fall
Into emptiness, your
Eyes are losing the light!
