Pushed me off the dirty floor
You watched as my head hit the floor
You watched as i rolled round and round
You watched as i came tumbling down
You watched as i rolled down the stairs
You never wished me - fare thee well!
You watched as i got on my feet
I ran towards her and she started to plead, no!

Ain't got time for what you feel
Ain't got time for what you feel
Ain't got time for what you feel
Ain't got time for what you feel

You did it again
You did it again
You did it again and again and again, ho, ho!

Far below original sin
Far below the state i'm in
Far below malicious crimes
Far below her for the time
Far below
Far below
Far below is the place you'll go, ho!

Ain't got time for what you feel
Ain't got time for what you feel
Ain't got time for what you feel
Ain't got time for what you feel

You did it again
You did it again
You did it again and again and again, ho, ho!

Oh went through the window, quiet as a mouse
No sound was stirring throughout the house
I'd heard a noise that made me startle
But i kept on walking down the corridor
Yes the corridor
Yes the corridor
And there you were with a man once more, no!

Ain't got time for what you feel
Ain't got time for what you feel
Ain't got time for what you feel
Ain't got time for what you feel

You did it again
You did it again
You did it again and again and again
You did it again
You did it again
You did it again and again and again, ho, ho!
