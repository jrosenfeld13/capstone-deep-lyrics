Rushing, ducking, hunting for something
Quit flaunting, everybody hustling
Everybody bought it from something
Everybody judging
I'm sick of a thing called pretending... that you know where you're heading
Tell me again, keep it kept in
All I wanted was your blessing
So I'm sorry, you can't tell me nothing
When I see it in your eyes your bluffing
And all I asked for was taken away!
Gotta get it out, learn to defend it
Gotta get it out, learn to accept it
Gotta get it out
Gotta get it out
Gotta get it out
Never been beaten or defeated
Keeping the pin of a meter
Crossing the line, I'ma listen
Yo world you can keep it!
(I've got reasons demons)
Bashes, turn them into ashes
And never find a fear in the matches
You'll never sleep until you reach it
With the writings on the wall
(just read it)
So I can say that I beat it, stop stressing
Growing on myself's just mentions
And I'm betting this direction's trying to smash into me!!!
Gotta get it out, learn to defend it
Gotta get it out, learn to accept it
Gotta get it out
Gotta get it out
Gotta get it out
