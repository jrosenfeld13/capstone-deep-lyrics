Baby, please
Won't you just take a minute and slow it down
There ain't no use in getting all worked up
It's just a bump in the road
We're gonna work it out (work it out, work it out, work it out)
We got a choice
We could save something special or let it go
Or walk away from what we know is real
Got a mighty love
Gonna fight for love
Ain't gonna let you shut it down
Because I'm
All fired up - Baby, 'cause I'm
All fired up - Yeah, you know I'm
All fired up for love - Baby, now I'm
All fired up
Doot doot doot
Help me please
Gotta see what's in front of or set it free
And use the moment to express yourself
Yes, we've just got caught up
In the game of love (game of love, game of love, game of love)
Take a look
'Cause we just turned the page in the lover's book
And we can't quit because we're half way there
Gotta try for love (try for love)
Gotta fight for love (fight for love)
We gotta build this thing to last
Because I'm
All fired up - Baby, yeah I'm
All fired up - Watch me, see I'm
All fired up for love - Baby, yeah I'm
All fired up - Yeah, you know I'm
All fired up - Baby, Yeah, I'm
All fired up - Watch me, see I'm
All fired up for love - Baby, yeah, I'm all! All!
All fired up
Gotta try for love (try for love)
Gotta fight for love (fight for love)
We gotta build this thing to last
Because I'm
All fired up - Baby, yeah I'm
All fired up - Watch me, see I'm
All fired up for love - Baby, yeah I'm
Doot doot doot
