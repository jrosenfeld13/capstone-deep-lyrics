Dreams at home not waking creeping down inside the quiet urns listen to the sound crashing down crashing into it the needle is warm in the arm throat burns illusion pain walk out in the street see the vacant eyes dreaming of the dream unbroken economic repression plays a part i wonder what i'm going through pain wasted away island body on a darkened see to avoid chattering taped tape taping human muttering warning flicker lights the candle burns inside a pain that never dies crawls up the back and waits for the lies tall climb edges edges exhausts no night climbing higher crawls wicked wire cut throat explodes singing of the the vein no desire great fate human heart explodes attacking pointed sticks in sores the arms wheres the warning warning shot the lights out where's the warning needle is warm in the arm travels to the heart human heart flags the blood a halo of fire scarring made of flame the flower flavor find its worth calls the tripping strings supporting the game of life the pain broken chair that horror tray of fear where's the warning warning killing me aching human heart except my patience is giving up on me river of track mark volcano upon the arm open sores allowing ants to crawl in and i wonder if i missed the warning missed the warning casting away varnish crack ants symbolize decay missed the warning missed the vein reaching out crying for where is the warning heart exploding human heart attack
