[Verse 1]
Yesterday was the first time
That I didn't hear from you
Almost felt like the world had ended
What was I to do?

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the one for me
And only you can be my love fantasy
You lift me up higher, you're who I desire
I just love what you do to me
And oh, don't leave me waiting too long
Come by and...

[Chorus]
See me
You need love, baby
I need love, baby
See me
Hurry, baby

[Verse 2]
I can't hide my emotions
It never turns out right
And without you there was no one
To get me through the night
Well, I had never cried so much
For anybody else's touch
I even scared myself, ooh
What a way to spend my time
Hopin' for even one line
From you and no one else

[Pre-Chorus]
I really need you here with me
See, all these lonely nights keep
Messin' with my mind
I'm so satisfied I asked you to come on by 'cause
I know soon you'll be by my side
And, oh, you won't keep me waiting too long
When you come by to...

[Chorus]
See me
You need love, baby
I need love, baby
See me
Hurry, baby, yeah

[Bridge]
Come to me, girl
My whole world is empty and sad without you
Come back, baby, hold me, yeah

You need love, baby
I need love, baby, baby
You need love, baby
I need love, baby, baby

See me
Ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the one for me
And only you can be my love fantasy
You lift me up higher, you're who I desire
I just love what you do to me
Oh, don't leave me waiting too long
Come 'round and...

[Chorus]
See me
See me, yeah
See me
Love me, baby
See me
You need love, baby
I need love, baby
See me
You need love, baby
See me
See me
