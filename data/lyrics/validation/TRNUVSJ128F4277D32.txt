Who's got some famous last words?
Like i never said 'i'd be here'
You can stick around now
Put your head back in your seat now
There's no signs that you'll ever be free
From a danger that's a certainty
Engines bust, planes are falling
What must i be facing?
Step inside for a ride
Fly there inside, gave your life
This is not, what i'd like
Wear your lifevest
