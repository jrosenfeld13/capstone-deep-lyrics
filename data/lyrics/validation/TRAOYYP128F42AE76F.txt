This is the sound of a dropping bomb

After years are we still all content
With being pawns in war game chess?
Shuffled by King George and his English Queen
On a board of autocracy

As fundamentalist citing stories and fables
Of whose god is more righteously skilled
In whose gods' honor that we are all killed...

A dead ringer for Armageddon
Dead ringer dead!
A dead ringer for Armageddon, yeah
Dead ringer dead!
A dead ringer for Armageddon
Dead ringer dead!
This State Funeral, we do not mourn

And still the wicked sleep
And dream of endless years of tyranny
Passed on by incestuous means
Skull and Bone, Freemason reigns

A dead ringer for Armageddon
Dead ringer dead!
A dead ringer for Armageddon, yeah
Dead ringer dead!
A dead ringer for Armageddon
Dead ringer dead!
This State Funeral, we do not mourn

Destroy all adversary - free yourself
Erase the common enemy - free yourself
Extinguishing the quarry - free yourself
Through the smoke screen we seek out justice...
