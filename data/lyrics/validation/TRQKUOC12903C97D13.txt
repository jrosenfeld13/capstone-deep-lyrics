[Verse 1]
Without love
Without hate
Without anyone who I even allowed
To find out all of the little things
I've been thinking

[Chorus]
It's too easy for folks to get by
There's no reason for someone to try
To put walls around our misery
And gently emasculate me

[Verse 2]
You were seen
On your knees
Breaking what was already half destroyed
Like your love and all of the pretty things
That went with it

[Chorus]
Spent all this time chasing happy
But happy is boring to me
So put walls around our misery
And gently emasculate me

[Chorus]
Spent all this time chasing happy
But happy is boring to me
So put walls around our misery
And gently emasculate me
