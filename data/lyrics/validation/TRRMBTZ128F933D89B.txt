[**feat. Travis McCoy]

[Verse 1:]
They look at me, laugh because I'm different
I laugh cause they're all the same
Stuck inside the box
While I'm running circles around the game
They're cold, I'm hot
And I know who I am
Everyone sits down, I stand up
They might walk but I'm gonna' strut
They fit in, I stand out
Even if I have to shout
I know, I know, I'm not the same
You say yes and I say
No, no, no

[Chorus:]
Don't care what they say
I do things differently
A weirdo no cliche'
I do things differently
I guess they don't get me
I do things differently
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I do things differently

[Verse 2:]
Put this on the record, literally
I won't stand in a picture perfect shadow of someone
I don't wanna be
And I'm not sorry at all, but that's just me
You keep it neat and tidy
I colour outside the lines
I'm ahead of the game
Turn around they far behind
And I know, I know I'm not the same
You say yes and I say
No ,no, no

[Chorus:]
Don't care what they say
I do things differently
A weirdo no cliche'
I do things differently
I guess they don't get me
I do things differently
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I do things differently
Don't care what they say
I do things differently
A weirdo no cliche'
I do things differently
I guess they don't get me
I do things differently
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I do things differently

[Bridge:]
I do, I do it
I do it, do it, do it different
Like, I do, I do it
I do it
[Travis McCoy:]
T- T T Travie
Let me see how can I put this to you simply
I'm the epitome of everything that you pretend to be
Oh Cassie they so pretentious
They really push my buttons
Now you want plus two on the guest list
We better tell em something
Got to get it off my chest
Like a bench press the goal is to take control never to impress
We are not like you
I do it, do it, do it, do it different like
We are on some other ....
I do it, do it, do it, do it different
3, 2, 1 all systems go
Think they ready, (uh-uh) ready,(uh-uh) (no!)
No no no
