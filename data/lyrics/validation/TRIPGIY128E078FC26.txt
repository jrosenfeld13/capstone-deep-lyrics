Setting up my battlements
Waiting for the guilt to come
Like armies have intent
Turning me to face someone
Who looks a million loving nights
And every stolen glance pulls me in deeper

Lay off my back and look at stars
Think of all the love we gave
He writes it down for me
But ive already turned the page
And i feel the ground beneath me give
Close around my eyes and i am sleepy

Where in my life did this begin
What happens now
If i admit

Im tempted by your touch
Im tempted by your moves
I dont know where to look
Dont wanna have to choose
Coz im tempted and i know
Where this is leading to
If i surrender now
If i give in to you
Give in to youuuu
Give in to youuuu

Like water through my hands
Your propositions come
Hes writing in the sand
Im staring at the sun

And promises and memories
All dance before my eyes
But have no meaning

Where in my life
Is this gona end?
Where do we go
If i admit

Im tempted by your touch
Im tempted by your moves
I dont know where to look
Dont wanna have to choose
Coz im tempted and i know
What this is leading to
If i surrender now
If i give in to you
Give in to youuuu
Give in to youuuu

I dont wana hear the question
Im scared of my confession
Ill save it for another day
Ohhh
Can't even deal with maybe
Coz nothings gona save me
Ever hear me say
That im tempted

Im tempted by your touch
Im tempted by your moves
I dont know where to look
Dont wanna have to choose
Coz im tempted and i know
What this is leading to
If i surrender now
If i give in to you
Give in to youuuu
Give in yo youuuu
