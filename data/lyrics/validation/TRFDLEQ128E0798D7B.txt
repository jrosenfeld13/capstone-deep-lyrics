I stand in the center
With you around me like a circle
Hating me because I reject you
You reach out to touch me
Reach for the last survivor
Keep your frozen tears I reject you

One day I'll break the circle
Can't hold me back forever
I'll always be the rejector

One day I'll break the circle
Can't hold me back forever
I'll always be the rejector

I'll be your bad man
You think I'm just a madman
You think that I'm just a loser
Don't think I'm under
Don't think the fight is over
Just because you've gone against a loner

One day I'll break the circle
Can't hold me back forever
I'll always be the rejector

One day I'll break the circle
Can't hold me back forever
I'll always be the rejector

I'll be your bad man
You think I'm just a madman
You think that I'm just a loser, no, no, no
Don't think I'm under
Don't think the fight is over
Just because you've gone against a loner

One day I'll break the circle
Can't hold me back forever
I'll always be the rejector

One day I'll break the circle
Can't hold me back forever
I'll always be the rejector

One day I'll break the circle
Can't hold me back forever
I'll always be the rejector

One day I'll break the circle
Can't hold me back forever
I'll always be the rejector
