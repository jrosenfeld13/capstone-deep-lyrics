Mother's spinning in her grave 'cause she can't save

Mother's spinning in her grave 'cause she can't save
You wouldn't leave it alone
Mother's spinning in her grave 'cause she can't save
You couldn't leave it alone

Glass cuts up your hide
Black mark on your soul
Burning up your life
Feed the glass dick jones

Mother's spinning in her grave 'cause she can't tame
You need to be the dog
Mother's spinning in her grave 'cause she can't save
The you that's already gone

Glass cuts up your hide
Black mark on your soul
Burning up your life
Feed the glass dick jones

Mother's spinning in her grave 'cause she can't save
You wouldn't leave it alone
Mother's spinning in her grave 'cause she can't tame
You need to be the dog

Glass cuts up your hide
Black mark on your soul
Burning up your life
Feed the glass dick jones
