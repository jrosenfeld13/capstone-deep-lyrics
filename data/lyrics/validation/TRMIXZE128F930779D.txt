Don't do it darlin'
Don't you dare look in there
You said you didn't want to see me
But you've been lookin' for me everywhere
And you know that you're gonna find me
If you keep on drinkin' fast
Cause honey I'm right there waitin' on you
At the bottom of your glass

And here I am
Here I am
In the bourbon and the water
That burn you just like a brand
Here I am

It ain't workin' darlin'
Hard as you may try
You keep hearin' the words you told me
In everyone's goodbye
And you know that you're just one step
From another one being gone
I know I've seen 'em all unravel
I've been watchin' it all along

And here I am
Here I am
In every lie you're hearin'
That burn you just like a brand
Here I am

And honey, I got over you passin' me over
A long time ago
And my pride was stronger when I was younger
Now I'd rather have you to know

That here I am
Here I am
I still carry a flame for you
Burnin' me like a brand
Here I am
