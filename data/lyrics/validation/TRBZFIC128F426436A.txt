Your smile was so disarming
You'd better mind your own affair
Picking up the pieces
Of a life that shone in tatters
You're gonna come back if you dare

Chorus ~
Ain't it always the way
You get just one chance
Ain't it always the way
Ain't it always the way

You'd better learn to mind your business
Watch out for your own
Sail your boat on placid bays
You'd better learn to keep the big ship
On the straight and narrow
Let the first mate cast away

Chorus

And then along comes the day
And then along comes the day

Be a winner
A dead ringer for the truth
Will the circle be unbroken
Be a master of your destiny
This is not a joke

Chorus

Always the way
