How do you live cold
Before you're young
You're so old

You're born and then you die
You're born and then you die
And you are born

Past the city and the thieves
Past the wolverines and trees
Until the sunrise
In the electrical storm

Last night with you
When we turned blue
I saw right through
When we turned blue

I can see you now
You are me
Anyhow

You're born and then you die
You're born and then you die
And you are born

Past the city and the thieves
Past the wolverines and trees
Until the sunrise
In the electrical storm

In the sunrise
In the sunrise
And we are born
In the electrical storm

In the sunrise
In the sunrise
And we are born
In the electrical storm

Last night with you
When we turned blue
Were you untrue
When we turned blue
When we turned blue
