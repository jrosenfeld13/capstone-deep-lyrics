"Hey, I hit town without a clue
Minding my business like I always do
Just my luck I ran smack into you

And I never could've known it would be like this
You got the kind of charm that I can't resist
I figure what's the harm in a little bitty kiss or two

But I fell in love
(Whatcha wanna do that for)
Oh I fell in love
(Whatcha wanna do that for)
I fell in love

Took me by surprise, put me on the floor
Right between the eyes with a two by four
Just a little taste and
I fell in love

I was doing fine out on my own
Never sitting home by the telephone
I couldn't complain that I didn't have much to do
I was a two fisted woman looking for a fight
Had a boy on my left, a boy on the right
But you burned me up like a chicken at a barbeque

But I fell in love
(Whatcha wanna do that for)
Oh I fell in love
(Whatcha wanna do that for)
I fell in love

Didn't see it coming into view
I was overwhelmed and overdue
I ain't gonna sweat it
I fell in love

But I fell in love
(Whatcha wanna do that for)
Oh I fell in love
(Whatcha wanna do that for)
I fell in love

Caught me on the blind side unaware
I may be a fool but I don't care
I never knew what hit me
I fell in love

But I fell in love
(Whatcha wanna do that for)
Oh I fell in love
(Whatcha wanna do that for)
I fell in love

Trying to visualize what's wrong with me
Got me hypnotized, I cannot see
Boy you really got me
I fell in love
I fell in love
I fell in love
Oh I fell in love"
