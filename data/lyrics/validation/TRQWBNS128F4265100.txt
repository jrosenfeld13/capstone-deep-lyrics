Six o'clock in the morning
My head is ready to explode
I can't believe I made it home alive
I don't remember where I went or
What I was drinking
I know it made me sick
And I'm not denying
That I get this way
When I try to get over you
I get this way
When I try to get over you

Sometimes it hurts so much
To lose the one you love
Sometimes it hurts so much
To lose the one you love

I tried so hard to hate you
But it only makes things worse
I only end up hating myself
And as my hatred grows
So do the lies
It's hard to face the truth sometimes
God I feel so useless
God I hate myself
When I try to get over you
I hate myself
Will I ever get over you?

Sometimes it hurts so much
To lose the one you love
Sometimes it hurts so much
To lose the one you love

And after all this time you'd think I'd understand the way you feel
But no
I only think about myself
And it's driving you away
I always knew it would one day

Sometimes it hurts so much
To lose the one you love
Sometimes it hurts so much
To lose the one you love
Sometimes it hurts so much
To lose the one you love
Sometimes it hurts so much
To lose the one you love
