The general screams
As he's torn out of his dreams
Now something's gone terribly wrong
The enemy looms on the battlefield
But his entire army's gone
The gatekeeper chews down his nails
Now he's startin' upon the bone
Sturdy foundation all flows like blood
And it feels so all alone
I watch him as he fumbles with his bullets and his gun
I lean down to his ear
Wrap my hands down around his fear
And I tell him, whisper, run run run

Oh, little ones
The fun has just begun
Oh, little ones
The fun has just begun

Long white carpet slung over the clouds
Where the angels, tight knit, form to pass rumblin' crowds
Feeding coal dust down to the earth
Just howlin' at the moon
As they cry out for Jesus
'Cause they know
They know he'll be here soon

(Chorus)

So that's the thing about the state we are in
Lookin' for Jesus in the lost-and-found bin
No one's got time
To pick him up
Sayin'
"Sometimes babies die man, life's just rough"

(Chorus x2)
