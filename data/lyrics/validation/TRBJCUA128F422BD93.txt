Oh my darling we're meadowing now
Oh love is bold in the cricketing fields
And a sly part of night gets down to get up
Oh bright light sing me a song, on and on

Oh, de da
Oh, I know

Oh my love this is our town
Where gray cloud wander over heaven and ground
Oh, my love it's difficult times
Mistakes I've made escape like birds from a line, on and on

Oh, thinking of heaven, oh thinking it's night
Oh, thinking of heaven, oh maybe next time

Oh thinking of heaven, oh thinking it's night
Oh, thinking of heaven, oh maybe next time, next life down the road
