Right behind the perfect face
There's someone who keeps secrets hidden
We think I don't wanna know
Reasons why you're crashin' over me
I don't look back
Darlin' so it goes
But I regret
That we couldn't make it rain
And all our dreams were left to dry
Can't make it rain
There's not one cloud left in the sky
So you said you'd try
We bled, we cried
We couldn't make it rain
We had everything to live for
Even if we didn't understand
The game of give and take
Was more than just the sum of what we made
The most of time
So we'll move on
And leave it all behind
'Cause we couldn't make it rain
And all our dreams were left to dry
Can't make it rain
There's not one cloud left in the sky
So you said you'd try
We've bled, we've cried
We couldn't make it rain
Now I can't help thinkin' about
Places we would go
But I won't be alone
No more
But this fault won't be mine
Everything is gone
Make it rain
And our dreams were left to dry
Can't make it rain
There's not one cloud left in the sky
So make it rain
All our dreams were left to dry
Can't make it rain
There's not one cloud left in the sky
So you said you'd try
We bled, we cried
You said you'd try
We bled, we've cried
We've cried
