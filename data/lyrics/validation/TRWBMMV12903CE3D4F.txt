Slam the door and turn the key
Punch the dash, red light on empty
Why stop, lets take it slow
I wanna get you to go

Pop the lock and fill the tank
Trade it in for the newest make
Why stop, seen engines blow
I wanna get you to go

Get you to go
Get you to go
Get you to go
Get you to go

The street curves around your bend
Hold tight, here where it all ends
Why stop, when I in tow
I wanna get you to go

Kill the lights, drive to the clouds
So gone we cannot come down
Why stop, are we getting low?
I wanna get you to go

Time, time flying by
With you at my side, I won ever come down
Time, time flying by
With you at my side, I won ever come down
Time, time flying by
With you at my side, I won ever come down

Pump the break, it over now
Fill it up for another round
Why stop, lets take it slow
I wanna get you to go

Straight ahead, is where we land
This is all according to plan
Why stop are we getting low?
I wanna get you to go

So gone
