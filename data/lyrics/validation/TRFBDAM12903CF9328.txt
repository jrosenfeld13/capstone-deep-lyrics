I'm running through these fields again
Black my mind, let's go inside
I'm doing this to feel again
Swallow time, I'm alive
Sing to me the astral song
Lead me through the snow
It's cold, i know
But I want to go
So lead me so, so lead me, so

In the moonlight
With the plantlife
I held my breath under the stream of thought

Smoke transforms the earth tonight
And it paints my life, and all is white
He is there in candy stripes
And we go for miles, with static smiles
Space is but a pinwheel's flight
On a screen i see, its symmetry
Bliss will eat my dreams tonight
I'm outlines, aware
Of all my seams
A wire-frame
A conscious dream, a conscious dream

In the moonlight
With the plant life
I held my breath under the stream of thought

I am here, in the water
And i remember, i'm alone
I am here, in the water
And i remember, i'm alone

(i will come down now)
