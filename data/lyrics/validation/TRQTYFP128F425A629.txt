Gotta get back
Gotta figure out a way
I'm losing
My senses to you

Where'd it go
The bluebird I should follow
Back home?
But where is home?

Guess it won't amount to much
Won't be long before I crush
I'll stand in line

[Chorus]
Don't believe a thing they say, today
Seems we all get lost amongst
The pigeons and the crumbs

All alone
But I'm in a crowded room
I'm sinking
In quicksand tonight

You pick me up, and I shine across the sky
'Till morning
Then you colour me in

Guess it won't amount to much
Seems to me I've lost my touch
I'm back in line

[Chorus]
Don't believe a thing they say, today
Turn around and walk away
Everything will go your way, I pray
Seems we all get lost amongst
The pigeons and the crumbs

Don't believe a thing they say, today
Turn around and walk away
Everything will go your way, I pray
Seems we all get lost amongst
The pigeons and the crumbs

Don't believe a thing they say, today
Turn around and walk away
Everything will go your way, I pray
Seems we all get lost amongst
The pigeons and the crumbs
