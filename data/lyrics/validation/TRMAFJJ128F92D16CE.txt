[Intro]
It's been a long time

It's been a long time

It's been a long time
It's been a long time
It's been a long time
It's been a long time
It's been a long time
It's been a long time
It's been a long time
It's been a long time

[Chorus]
It's been a long time coming
But I like what I hear from the tsss to the bass
It's been a long time coming
But I like what I hear from the tsss to the bass
It's been a long time coming
But I like what I hear from the tsss to the bass
It's been a long time coming
But I like what I hear from the tsss to the bass, bass, bass...

[Hook]
It's the key to my soul
I won't let no one take it away

[Chorus]
It's been a long time coming
But I like what I hear from the tsss to the bass

It's been a long time coming
But I like what I hear from the tsss to the bass

[Outro]
It's the key to my soul
I won't let no one take it away
