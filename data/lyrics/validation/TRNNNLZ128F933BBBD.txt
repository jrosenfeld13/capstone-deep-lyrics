[Verse 1]
I'm just thinking about that time when I met you
But now I'm thinking about how I can forget you
You had my heart from the start, but it faded
I needed space for someone else
I had to leave you just to realize that I miss you
Now I don't know what I did

[Chorus]
I'm running around, baby
I'm running around without you, baby
I'm running around all over town
But I look everywhere and no one compares
Because nothing's as good if I'm without you

[Verse 2]
I'm hoping that you try to forgive me
Maybe we can fall in love again completely
You had my heart, don't you ever forget that
I'm coming back for it, I promise you
I had to leave you just to realize that I need you
Now I'm changing, I can't take this

[Chorus]
I'm running around, baby
I'm running around without you, baby
I'm running around all over town
But I look everywhere and no one compares
Because nothing's as good if I'm without you

[Bridge]
Do you think that I could have one more try
I promise you that I will always stand by you
Cause I am through with

[Chorus]
I'm running around, baby
I'm running around without you, baby
I'm running around all over town
But I look everywhere and no one compares
Because nothing's as good if I'm without you
Running around baby
I'm running around without you baby
I'm running around got my feet on the ground
And I'm missing your face, I'm going insane
Because nothing's as good if I'm without you

[Chorus]
I'm running around, baby
I'm running around without you, baby
I'm running around all over town
But I look everywhere and no one compares
Because nothing's as good if I'm without you
