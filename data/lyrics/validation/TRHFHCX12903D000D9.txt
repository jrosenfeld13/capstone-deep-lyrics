They say the city never sleeps
But I still feel alone before the dawn
Between success and human sacrifice
A fine line not meant for man or god

And there's tension in the air, cut without a reason
A mirroman hanging from the ceiling
My own reflection tells me don't look down
And I've been hanging on for a bit too long

'Cause I'm drawn to this feeling
Like a fly to a light bulb
A fool to the ages caught in a cruel sun
I'm drawn to this feeling like a fly to a light bulb

And I've been hanging on just a bit too long

They say that everybody's got a right
I feel so lost, they must be wrong
Between the morning and her sleeping eyes
I'm dancing blindly through the smog

'Cause I'm drawn to this feeling
Like a fly to a light bulb
A fool of the ages caught in a cruel sun
I'm drawn to this feeling like a fly to a light bulb

And I've been hanging on just a bit too long
