Lost army
Aren't you glad we had enough too?
Lost army
Prisoner in the ends of the sea
It goes on
You dont understand or see me
It goes on
You don't move
    

La vida
Slaughtered, lying in half now
La vida
Soldiers
Are you done now facing things?
Generals
Are you done?
Move

Lost army (passing, yelling, passing by me)
Just love
Its love we seek
Lost army (passing, yelling, passing by me)
It goes on
You dont understand or see me
It goes on
You don't move
    

Lost army
We love
We love
We love too
