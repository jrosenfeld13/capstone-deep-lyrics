Way out there in the wilderness of love and pain
Under the gentle arches we rode the silver streets
Couldn't see a difference between gold or wooden cross
Could never see where we're falling came in to love
Hounded by love
Hounded by the very thing you dreamed up
Chased inside the walls you tried to breach
Sent crashing to your knees
Only tender love
Understood the need you need with
Understood the time it took
To take you where nothing ever was
Never was there once nothing and everything once was
Not dead but still and ready to be born anew
Looking back now it all seems so clear
Like staring so long unseeing for someone to light inside a
Darkened room
Try your tender love
Push you back till there's nowhere left
Nowhere to feel nothing anymore
Nothing that will comfort you more
More than tender love
Understands the need you need with
Understand the time it takes
To hold and have a love again
More than tender love
Understands the need you need with
Understand the time it takes
To hold and have love
Then try your tender love
Push it till there's nothing left
Nowhere to feel nothing anymore
Nothing that will comfort you more
Then hounded by love
Hounded by the very thing you dreamed up
Chased inside the walls you tried to breach
Sent crashing to your knees
Then only tender love
Understood the need you need with
Understood the time it took
To take you where nothing ever was
