"I want to kill everyone, Satan is good, Satan is our pal..."

Seething, inbreeding, ignorant, believing liars...salvage
Seething, inbreeding the fear of independance
Inbreeding, feeding a cult of false reverance
Anything we've conceived is everything but pure
Tainted by a conscience that's groping for a cure
Spiritual salvage, we claw for what we can
Look above to man-made hope to perish in the end
Anything that we've conceived is everything but pure...
Mindless beliefs, fat fucks led like pigs to the slaughter
Misues free will and cry for all man's sin
Forfeit all hope, in god we trust to take it away
Salvage what's left, truth defies definition
Within blasphemy exists the voice of reason
Following through these lies of misdirection
My command of hate cannot be extinguished, deny my prophecy?
You place your death in fiction!
Anything we've conceived is everything but pure
Tainted by a conscience that's groping for a cure
Spiritual salvage, we claw for what we can
Look above to man-made hope to perish in the end
Real truth lies beyond reason, we will never understand
