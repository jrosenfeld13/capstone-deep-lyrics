This could last all day
It's heaven when you hold me
Maybe fall like rain all around me
Heaven when you hold me
I am alive

I'm not asking Lay me down
You're not saying In your arms
I'm not asking for much Let me stay
To believe in In your arms
You're not leaving
I'm not staying

This could last all day
You know that I am
Painted when you touch me
Heaven when you hold me
Open my eyes
Inside, I'm a lot like you

I'm not asking Lay me down
You're not saying In your arms
I'm not asking for much Next to your beautiful skin
To believe in I can feel it
You're not leaving In your arms
Wish I was staying

Close my eyes, so I can see
Your love, the light that shines on

Oh, how you take my breath away
When you fall like rain and surround me

Baby, don't let go
Spirit, don't let go
Let me stay in your arms
I'm not asking for much
But to lay me down
Why don't you set me down
Let me hide in your arms
Let me breathe, close my eyes
Let me see, pour your love on me
Oh, how you take my breath away
