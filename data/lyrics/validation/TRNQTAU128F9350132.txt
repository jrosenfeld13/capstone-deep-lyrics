Ah let's take a look inside your soul
Can you imagine what really is the goal?
Ah you spit at me and you say NO!
This is reality and not a TV show

Oh will it give us a liberation?
From separation of human nation
I can imagine what you think
Everything's forgiven with nearly just a blink

In which language shall we pray our Lord
To come and throw your prejudices over board
And then rather look inside your heart
And feel, surreal, say, one - two - three - four

Dab - da - da - dab -... da - dab - dab - dab - hey!
Dab - da - da - dab -... da - dada - dab - da - dab - ho!
Dab - da - da - dab -... da - dab - dab - dab - hey!
Dab - da - da - dada - da - dada - da - da - da

The 89ers are back with that punk!

Hey! - Ho!

Let's take a look inside your soul
Can you imagine what really is the goal?
Ah you spit at me and you say NO!
This is reality and not a TV show

Oh will it give us a liberation?
From separation of human nation
I can imagine what you think
Everything's forgiven with nearly just a blink

In which language shall we pray our Lord
To come and throw your prejudices over board
And then rather look inside your heart
And feel, surreal, say, one - two - three - four

Dab - da - da - dab -... da - dab - dab - dab - Hey
Dab - da - da - dab -... da - dada - dab - da - dab - Ho
Dab - da - da - dab -... da - dab - dab - dab - Hey
Dab - da - da - dada - da - dada - da - da - dab

Let's get ready!

In which language shall we pray our Lord
So come and throw your prejudices over board
And then rather look inside your heart
And feel, surreal, say, one - two - three - four
