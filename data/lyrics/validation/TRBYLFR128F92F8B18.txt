This distant light, helps to remind me
So it keeps me in check but not all of the time
It goes straight to the nerve at the back of my mind
And it helps me retain what I openly give to you
For safekeeping

Chorus:
Its only safekeeping now
I will refrain from the words that I say to you
Thats if you want me to my dear
Cos were only safekeeping now
I will return all the words that I took from you
And I broke in two these things that help me

These words collide, help to decide me
So they keep me awake but not all of the time
They go straight to the place in the back of my mind
And I never forget what I openly take from you
For safekeeping

(Chorus)
Keep it in mind with her all of this time
With the safety in words that we choose to entwine
Pull at the ends and youll see them unwind
They are softly spoken
Keep me in check but not all of the time
Give me a space and just let me decide
How can you forget when I openly cry
It is for safekeeping

I could pretend as I swallow my pride
Because its perfectly clear, are you reading the signs?
So must I repeat for the millionth time
It is for safekeeping?

Its just for safekeeping now
I will refrain for the words that I say to you
Thats if you want me to my dear
Cos were just for safekeeping now
I will return all the words that I took from you
And I broke in two these things that help me
