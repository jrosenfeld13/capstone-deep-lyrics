A little bit later on
A little bit later on
Just wait and you'll see
How lonely you'll be
A little bit later on

Just wait till you start missin'
My huggin' and my kissin'
Now, baby, better listen
You'll be cryin', boo, hoo, hoo

A little bit later on
You're gonna wake up some day
And open your eyes
To a great big surprise, baby

Don't forget it
You'll regret it
After I'm gone

You'd better think twice
It won't be so nice
A little bit later on

Oh, a little bit later on
Say you're gonna wake up some day
And open your eyes
To a great big surprise, my baby

Don't forget it
You'll regret it
After I'm gone

You'd better think twice
It won't be so nice
A little bit later on
