[Intro]
When dawn breaks see it in your eyes
They see straight superheroes disguise [x4]

[Chorus]
You can go to sleep now baby
I got the world outside
You can go to sleep now girl
I got the world outside [x3]

I'm asleep and see I don't know, don't like [x3]

[Chorus]
You can go to sleep now baby
I got the world outside
You can go to sleep now girl
I got the world outside [x2]

[Outro]
Because I'm sleeping, but you're still awake
Because I'm sleeping, but you're still awake
Because I'm sleeping, but you're still awake
Because I'm sleeping, but you're still awake
I'm sleeping, but you're still awake
