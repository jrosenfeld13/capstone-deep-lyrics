When you're at the movie
Don't pretend you're groovy
Don't be swayed and shell shocked
Hinder here the band out
There is only waving
Men's are misbehaving
Jackie's on the craving
Rabbits on the raving
Their on the way with a tooth force
Hella frat while the cats gone
Zelda waves from the backseat
Hello hello
Zelda lays up the track sheet
Hello hello

Stand outside the door frame
Enter at your own game
Horse is trapped and ignorant
Of course, you'll won't get in here
Zelda is only waving
Doesn't worth your saving
Mine is trapped in a cave in
Monday feels like a slave in
Zelda is waving with her two hands
Freddy's is making up a new band
Zelda waves from the backseat
Hello hello
Zelda lays up the track sheet

Hello hello

I can't explain
Again and again
Ain't you afraid
Again and again

Zelda waves from the backseat
Hello hello
Zelda lays up the track sheet
Hello hello

When we meet with a genius
You know he's never really seen us
He's come back to brandy
Well that's very handy
Zelda's on the way man
To raise his kids, it's just amazing
Keith has joined the navy
Roger's little baby
Zelda screams not to touch her
But one day someone will f**k her
Zelda waves from the backseat
Hello hello
Zelda lays up the track sheet
Hello hello
