Me and my baby, we had a big fight
We ended our romance the same night
In an angry mood, he walked out the door
I said this song's going to an Aretha Franklin show

Hey, Aretha, sing one for me
Let him know our life's in misery
Will you sing a song that will touch his heart
And make him sorry that we are apart

I don't know if taking requests is part of your show
Do me this favour and I'll love you forever
Many romances have been saved by your sound
You've touched so many lovers, so many times

Yes, Aretha, sing one for me
Let him know our life's in misery
Will you sing a song that will touch his heart?
And make him sorry that we are apart

"Think", "Respect", "Call Me", "A Bridge Over Troubled Waters"
And "I Can't See Myself Leaving You"

Hey, Aretha, sing one for me
Let him know I'm as miserable as a woman can be
Sing a song that will touch his heart
So he'll be sorry that we are apart

"Think", "Respect", "Call Me", "I Never Loved a Man Like I Love You"
And "I Can't See Myself Leaving You"
