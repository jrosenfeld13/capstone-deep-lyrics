[Verse 1]
Ungrateful little motherfuck, boredom tuck
Beat you up with bedrooms of ice
I see you've got another one almost done
Bet you think that you wished twice
I see you standing over there, underwear
The milk is going to bring you a fight
Ungrateful little motherfuck, built you up
A brand new breakthrough device

[Verse 2]
Heard about your almost-kin touching skin
And leaving pictures out of the book
I thought that all the should've beens might've hid
Beneath all that they took
Never said I was the man who held the tan
And breathed while we violently shook
Ungrateful little motherfuck, boredom tuck
Up all that we could

[Verse 3]
But buildings have another tease, try to please
Leaving all the press pulled apart
Oh, I feel you like an evil wind, sucka twin
Dying for the "never" of stop
What, you going to seal this with all that's missed?
Oh, I think you're pulling my heart
Ungrateful little motherfuck, horror tucked
Up what you never have thought
If I see you with a cracked up kid who never wins
Dying for the little you've got
If I see you with a cracked up kid, double kick
Down to the floor of the rot
