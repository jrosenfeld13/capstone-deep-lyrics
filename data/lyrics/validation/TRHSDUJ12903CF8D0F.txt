Katie feels a snap and switches off the tap
Walks out to fetch the shotgun from the shed
Feels just a little rush and climbs into the car
Slow down a moment
Drives out along the lane and calmly into town
Stops to let the music come around
Walks down to the bank and draws a quiet breath
Slow down a moment
Switch on, all's fine, burn out, on fire
Stitched tight, beautiful and light
Lights a cigarette, climbs the marble stairs
And waves the gun around to paint a meaning
Money comes like rain, feel this easy feeling
She drives the car away and laughs and smiles
Stops to count the notes out for a while
And when she's done, drives on for a sunrise
