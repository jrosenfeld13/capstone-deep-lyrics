I was bored last night
Went to bed
And I'm still sleeping after dawn
Oh ya
Oh ya and you're still around
Back then I insisted
Leave me here I want you gone
Oh ya
Oh ya but you're still around

Well you've heard it all before
And you're not that bright
Let me help you out the door that's right

Oh let me help you
Help to get it right
You know if we help each other
We're bound to be alright

I'd like to thank you dear
For your support and always being there for me
But please oh please
Won't you let me be
And since you can't acknowledge my appall
To this devotion ya
Oh ya it's crystal clear to me

Sure you've seen it all before
But you're not that bright
