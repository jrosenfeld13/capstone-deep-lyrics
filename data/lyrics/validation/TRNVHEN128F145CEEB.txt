Good evening Memphis
How are we doing
Let's do it

Forgot my six-string razor and I hit the sky
Halfway to Memphis before I realised
Hey, I rang the information, my axe was cold
They said "she rides the train down to Oreole"

Well it's a mighty long way down the dusty trail
And the sun burns hot on the cold steel rail
And I look like a bum and I crawl like a snail
All the way from Memphis

I got to Oreole, you know, it took a month
And there was my guitar, electric junk
Some dude said "rock'n'rollers, you're all the same
Man that's your instrument" I felt so ashamed

Now it's a mighty long way down rock'n'roll
Through the Bradford Cities and the Oreoles
And you look like a star but you're still on the dole
All the way from Memphis

"Of course we weren't always superstars
There was a time when we were just ordinary commoners just like you"

Thank you Mr Hoople

Well it's a mighty long way down rock'n'roll
From the Liverpool Docks to the Hollywood Bowl
And you climb up the mountains and you fall down the holes
All the way from Memphis

Well it's a mighty long way down rock'n'roll
And your name gets hot and your heart grows cold
And you've got to stay a young man, you can never get old
All the way from Memphis

Well it's a mighty long way down rock'n'roll
From the Bradford Cities and the Oreole
And you look like a star but you're still on parole

All the way from Memphis
All the way from Memphis
All the way from Memphis (all the way from memphis)
All the way from Memphis

Thank you and goodnight
