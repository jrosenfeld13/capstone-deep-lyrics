What about me?
What about me?

You stepped into my life
Doing things to me
That I can't explain
Think twice, Baby
This ain't no game!
If you can't commit
Totally and not just a little bit
Why do you keep me hanging on
So long?

What about me?
Do you really wanna hurt me, baby?
Tell me now:
What about me?
Do you wanna break my heart to pieces?
I gotta know:
What about me?
What about me?

You taught me what it means
To walk along the lonely street
Of dreams
But I can't take it, take it no more!
Oh, baby
Now it's up to you
If you keep me standing like
A fool
I gotta take my pride and go
I'll go

What about me?
Do you really wanna hurt me, baby?
Tell me now:
What about me?
Do you wanna break my heart to pieces?
I gotta know:
What about me?
What about me?

You stepped into my life
Doing things to me
That I can't explain
Think twice, Baby
This ain't no game!

What about me?
Do you really wanna hurt me, baby?
Tell me now:
What about me?
Do you wanna break my heart to pieces?
I gotta know:
What about me?
What about me?
