My ghost is everywhere here
It hangs on every tree
Lingering with every flower and leaf
Smell of scent, and sight and sound
These are calling cards of other times

Familiar days and forgotten phases
Like water trickle down, down, down
Time is an ocean, and I'm set to swim
And I'm tumbled by her

Circle around the sun, turn, turn, turn
One day my turn will come
I'm stretched by time and torn by fate
I'm held together by the flesh of faith

Pushing up, I hope for the sun
But I'll take the rain with what all it comes
I walk: my feet roll, my arms sway to and fro
Who am I to try to guide my life?

Like the tribes that came before us
And all the kings and queens
And our ancestors through the centuries
Through the birth of a child
I return the gift that was given me
The wind on the skin, and the pull of gravity

Circle around the sun, turn, turn, turn
One day my turn will come
I'm living every minute and dying every day
I hope my heart is in the right place
