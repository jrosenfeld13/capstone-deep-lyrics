[Verse 1]
Better than watching Geller bending silver spoons
Better than witnessing new born nebulas in bloom
She who sees from up high smiles and surely sings
Perspective pries your once weighty eyes and it gives you wings

[Pre-Chorus]
I haven't felt the way I feel today
In so long it's hard for me to specify
I'm beginning to notice
How much this feels like a waking limb
Pins and needles, nice to know you

[Chorus]
Goodbye, nice to know you
Goodbye, nice to know you
Goodbye, nice to know you
Goodbye, nice to know you
To know you

[Verse 2]
Deeper than the deepest Cousteau would ever go
And higher than the heights of what we often think we know
Blessed she who clearly sees the wood for the trees
To obtain a 'bird's eye' is to turn a blizzard into a breeze

[Pre-Chorus]
I haven't felt the way I feel today
In so long it's hard for me to specify
I'm beginning to notice
How much this feels like a waking limb
Pins and needles, nice to know you

[Chorus]
Goodbye, nice to know you
Goodbye, nice to know you
Goodbye, nice to know you
Goodbye, nice to know you
To know you

[Bridge]
So could it be that it has been there all along?

[Pre-Chorus]
I haven't felt the way I feel today
In so long it's hard for me to specify
I'm beginning to notice
How much this feels like a waking limb
Pins and needles, nice to know you

[Chorus]
Goodbye, nice to know you
Goodbye, nice to know you
Goodbye, nice to know you
Goodbye, nice to know you
To know you
