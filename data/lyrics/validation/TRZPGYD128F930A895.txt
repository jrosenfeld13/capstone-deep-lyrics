The order is for murder
And we've been there before
The men in black are coming back
To serve the killing floor
No pity, no surrender

We take no prisoners
We spare no brave defender
No mercy, no quarter here

The killers
Will show you flame and sword
We are the killers
Enough to make your backbone shake
The killers
Enough to make
Your stupid faces quiver
And the killers long to take your life

The sun beats down like thunder
We ride to meet the foe
The clash of steel and leather
The only song we know
No pardon, no quarter

We own to no compassion
We glory in the slaughter
No mercy, we fetch your death

The killers
We are the ones foretold
We are the killers
We do not yearn for gold
We are the killers
We know the wrath of battle
We are killers
And the killers will destroy your life

The Devil rides to glory
We hasten by his side
A legendary story
Told by fireside
No quarter, let all hope fade

We glory in the slaughter
Our badge the ace of spades
No mercy, we bring the sword

The killers
We murder you in battle
We are killers
We ride you down like cattle
We are killers
We fight our way to legend
We are killers
And the killers love to see you die

Killers
We kill you till you die
We are the killers
We hold our banners high
We are the killers
We hang you out to die
We are the killers
And all we bring is death to life
