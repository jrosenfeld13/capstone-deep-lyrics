Teacher
Bring me to heaven
Or leave me alone
Why make me work so hard
When you know I work slow
Don't make us watch you scrape
More powder on the walls
Show us a laser
Take us to space
Or let us go
We got violent games on pause at home

You've seen this angst take shape
Don't hide those guilty eyes
You gave us guns for toys
We trained with cross hair scopes
Then in the name of peace we make war

Sergeant
I don't remember how you said to deal with guilt
I'm haunted by families grieving
Even soldiers kids
Is it god against god
And the pawns are people?
If they're both the same god
Then the battle's over
Details

Preacher
Am I gonna make it?
Am I going up?
Am I forgiven for the humans I dropped
It's not like a game once the guilt piles up
If I knew what I know now
It's easy to say I wouldn't go
I had violent games on pause at home

You know how hate takes shape
Don't hide those guilty eyes
You gave us guns for toys
Imposed beliefs then pride
We were taught that god prefers the USA
Just like the billboard sign -"this is god's country"
If it's true that god roots for the USA
Is every bomb we drop in god's name?
