[Verse]
Scratch card glory or waist-low pleasure?
Black eyes, nose bleeds, don't look back now
My white abode, do you remember my white abode?
But it's such a thrill, just to find out...

[Chorus]
Sorry, youre not a winner
With the air so cold and a mind so bitter
What have you got to lose but false intentions
And a life so pretentious?

[Verse]
Scratch card glory or waist-low pleasure?
Black eyes nose, bleeds, don' t look back now
My white abode, do you remember my white abode?
But it's such a thrill, just to find out...

[Chorus]
Sorry, youre not a winner
With the air so cold and a mind so bitter
What have you got to lose but false intentions
And a life so pretentious?

[Verse]
Scratch card glory or waist-low pleasure?
Black eyes, nose bleeds, dont look back now
My white abode, do you remember?
I sweat, I ache

[Chorus]
Sorry, youre not a winner
With the air so cold and a mind so bitter
What have you got to lose
But false intentions and a life so pretentious?

[Bridge]
What? What? What?
Goodbye, your world is...
