[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
No, this isn't what I wanted
I never thought it'd come this far
Thinking back to where we started
And how we lost all that we are

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
We were young and times were easy
But I could see it's not the same
I'm standing here, but you don't see me
Give it all for that to change
I don't want to lose her
Don't want to let her go

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Nick Jonas]
Standing out in the rain
Need to know if it's over
'Cause I would leave you alone
I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold her
Like I did before the storm
Yeah-ah-ah
Before the storm

[Verse 3: Miley Cyrus & Nick Jonas]
With every strike of lightning
Comes a memory that lasts
Not a word is left unspoken
As the thunder starts to crash
Maybe I should give up

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Nick Jonas]
Standing out in the rain
Need to know if it's over
'Cause I would leave you alone
I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold her
Like I did before the storm

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus & Nick Jonas]
I'm trying to keep the lights from going out
And the clouds from ripping out my broken heart
They always say a heart is not a home
Without the one who gets you through the storm

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Nick Jonas]
Standing out in the rain
Knowing that it's really over
Please don't leave me alone
I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold you
Like I did before the storm

[Outro]
Yeah
Like I did before the storm
