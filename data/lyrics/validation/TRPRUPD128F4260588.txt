He sees the flames in her tears
Sketching on her skin and he knows
That it's come to an end
And it's no point pretending it's not

And it's a long way down, a long way down from here
And it's a long way down, a long way down from here

So she smashes the glass
And there's blood on her hands and her skirt
There's the wind and a sun
A fresh air in her lungs once again

And it's a long way down, a long way down from here
And it's a long way down, a long way down from here

So he closes his eyes
And thinks 'Maybe I'll be surprised if I do
I just might fall into another realm
And make another home there with you'

And it's a long way down, a long way down from here
And it's a long way down, a long way down from here

It's best not to think about it
Just put your arms around me

It's best not to think about it
Just put your arms around me

It's best not to think about it
Just put your arms around me, oh
