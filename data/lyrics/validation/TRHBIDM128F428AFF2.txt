He'll pick a moment, he'll take a chance
He'll invite us all to a fatal dance
Such a man and such a mess
It's not an easy guess
I know that look, I know that face
I'd better get ready to hunt and trace
Bit by bit and on and on
And then he's gone

OH LORD! WHEN? HOW?
Such a major mess
It's not an easy guess

For a second or two he might appear
It takes a second or less and he'll disappear
Such a man and such a mess
It's not an easy guess
