Love's fever comin' on strong
I don't want the fire without the flame, no
Mother Nature gave me two hands to hold you
I'm not talkin' pressures or material gains

But M O N E Y never did a thing for L O V I N
I'll never understand what people's heads are in
Ask me what I need

I need your lovin' and that's the bottom line
I need your lovin' or just a little time
I need your lovin' and that's the bottom line
I need your lovin' or just a little time, this will do

Just a little lovin', this will do
Just a little lovin' this will do
Just a little lovin' this will do
Just a little lovin', me and you

Love's comin', so glad you're mine
I don't want your rhythm without your rhyme, no
Easy feelin', your love keeps getting better
Say you'll leave me never and together we'll fly

'Cause M O N E Y never did a thing for L O V I N
I feel it in my bones that you and I can win
Ask me what I need

I need your lovin' and that's the bottom line
I need your lovin' or just a little time
I need your lovin' and that's the bottom line
I need your lovin' or just a little time, this will do

Just a little lovin' this will do
Just a little lovin' this will do
Just a little lovin' this will do
Just a little lovin', me and you

L O V I N, I need your lovin
Just a little lovin', this will do
L O V I N, I need your lovin
Just a little lovin', this will do

'Cause M O N E Y never did a thing for L O V I N
I feel it in my third eye, love will never end, oh
Ask me what I need

I need your lovin' and that's the bottom line
I need your lovin' or just a little time
I need your lovin' and that's the bottom line
I need your lovin' or just a little time

I need your lovin', yeah
I need your lovin' or just a little time
I need your lovin' and that's the bottom line
I need your lovin' or just a little time, this will do

Just a little lovin', this will do
Just a little lovin', me and you
Just a little lovin', this will do
Just a little lovin', me and you

L O V I N, I need your lovin
Just a little lovin', this will do
L O V I N, I need your lovin
Just a little lovin', this will do

I need your lovin, I need your lovin
Just a little lovin', this will do
Just a little lovin', this will do
Just a little lovin', me and you

L O V I N, my baby love me
And I love my baby back
Is there enough love?
