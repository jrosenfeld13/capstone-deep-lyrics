I know I've been foolin' myself too long
I'm never right but always wrong
Goodbye, baby, so long

You know, you never let this thing catch on
You never let me be that strong
Goodbye, baby, so long

There was a cold wind blowing on the night we met
The leaves fell from the trees
You made a lot of promises I ain't seen yet
I ain't gonna ask you please

You know, none of us are gonna cry
It wasn't even worth the try
So long, baby, goodbye

There was a cold wind blowin' on the night we met
The windows were rolled up tight
We both asked for something we could never get
Now I'll do the thing that's right

You know, none of us are gonna cry
It wasn't even worth a try
So long, baby, goodbye
