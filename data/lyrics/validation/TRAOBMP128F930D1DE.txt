Everyone says that anyones better than you
You died in my dreams and
I don't know what to do
When the lights are down I forget about everything
When the blinds are drawn I internalize everything
And it gets me down
Everyone says that anyone's better than you
I'm stuck in a room and I haven't really got a clue
I don't believe it's true
I just wanted you
When the lights are down I forget about everything
When the blinds are drawn I internalize everything
And it gets me down
