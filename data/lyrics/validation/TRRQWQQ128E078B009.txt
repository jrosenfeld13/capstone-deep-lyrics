So here we are now, again
I'm getting sick of this again
Getting sick of all this waiting
To be perfect, and good
And I'm scared of all my friends
We're all not calling

All our hopes and all our fears
Letting go is love
Hope we don't choke
Hope we don't die
Hope we all feel alright
Feel alright

Falling, is supposed to be so fun
But all I get is sick and numb
I'm barely breathing
When all my fears descend
But I'm not fallen
I'm not dead

All our hopes and all our fears
Letting go is love
Hope we don't choke
Hope we don't die
Hope we all feel alright
Feel alright

We are all so brave
We are all so scared
We are all afraid
We're all not fallen
All not dead

All our hopes and all our fears
Letting go is love
Hope we don't choke
Hope we don't die
Hope we all

I said
All our hopes and all our fears
Letting go is love
Hope we don't choke
Hope we don't die
Hope we all feel alright
Feel alright
Feel all, feel alright
