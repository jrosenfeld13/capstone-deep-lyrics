Where are we? First and last
Bound together in our past
Much too cruel, much too fast
Much too quick to anger

I suppose years ago, years ago
I might have known
I suppose years ago

Traps lay bare in my face
Set to keep me in my place
Waved goodbye to the child
And life it seems it's colder

I suppose years ago, years ago
I might have known
I suppose years ago

(Yes, but what are you saying?)
Please leave my mind intact
(Yes, but what do you mean?)
As I slowly grow older

Where are we each and all?
Creatures run and creatures crawl
Where are we each and all?
Creatures run and creatures crawl
Where are we each and all?
Creatures run and creatures crawl
Spinning here on this ball
Creatures run and creatures crawl

I suppose, years ago, years ago
I might have known
I suppose, years ago, years ago
I might have known

As I slowly grow older
