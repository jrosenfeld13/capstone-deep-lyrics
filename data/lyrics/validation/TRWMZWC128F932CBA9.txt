Born into wanting more then we could ever afford and we are sucked in and we are held down on our knees stuck in slow decay

This is a mockery
A free market fallacy

Don't read just sign here time and time again a debt based fantasy of life without with outs

Your value is greater when you cannot stop

Prisons we build for ourselves

As small as your own home and as large as the world tear it down

Break the spell the key is to destroy it must be paid in full. If we don't realize post-haste then we're fucked and our debts will be our lives
