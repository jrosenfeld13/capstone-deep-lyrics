Hide your heart from sight
Lock your dreams at night
It could happen to you
Don't count stars
Or you might stumble
For someone will drop a sigh
And down you'll tumble
Keep an eye on spring
Run when church bells ring
It could happen to you
All I did was wonder
How your arms would be
And it happened to me
Hide your heart from sight
Lock up your dreams at night
It could happen
It could happen to you
Don't count stars, don't count stars
Or you may stumble
For someone will drop a sigh
And down you'll tumble
Keep an eye on spring
Run when church bells ring
It could happen
It could happen to you
All I did was wonder
How your arms could be
And it happened to me
And it happened
And it happened
And it happened to me
