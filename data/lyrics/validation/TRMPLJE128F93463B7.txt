In the misty moonlight
By the flickering firelight
Any place is alright
As long as I'm with you

In a far away land
By the shifting sea sand
With your hand in my hand
I won't be blue

Way up on the mountains
Or way down in the valley
I know I'll be happy
Any place anywhere
I don't care

In the misty moonlight
By the flickering firelight
Any place is alright
As long as you are there

Even in a far away land
By the shifting sea sand
With your hands in my hand
As long as you are there

Hey Hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
I'll be alright
If you'll be there
Say hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Will you be there
Tell me will you be there
Say yeah
Yeah
