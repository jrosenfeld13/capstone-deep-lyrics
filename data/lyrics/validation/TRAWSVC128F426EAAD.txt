[Verse 1:]
Aboard a train, I met a dame
She was a hipster
Man a real gone dame
She wasn't pretty
For New York City
As we strut down on that Ol' Fairlane
With a heave and a ho
Well, I just couldn't let her go
Get along
Sweet little woman, get along
On your way, get along
Sweet little woman, get along on your way
With a heave and a ho
Well, I just couldn't let her go

[Chorus:]
The train kept a rollin' all night long[x4]
With a heave and a ho
I just couldn't let her go

[Verse 2:]
I made a stop 'round Albuquerque
She must'a thought, I was real gone jerk
Got off the train at El Paso
A' looking so good I couldn't let her go
Get along
Sweet little woman, get along

[Chorus]
