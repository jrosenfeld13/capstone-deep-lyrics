[Verse 1]
I been thinking bout this all day long
Can't believe how I'm gone
And my mind's blown off of you
I'm anticipating (oh)
When you're coming home (oh)
See, tonight we're 'bout to try out something new

[Pre-Chorus]
(Something sexy baby)
I was thinking role play if you're ready, boy get ready
(Let's see you be Denzel)
It's your training day
Boy, come and get me
Sre you with me

[Chorus]
Let's keep the lights on cause tonight I wanna watch you perform
(Watch ya perform, let me see whatcha got for yo girl now baby)
When I turn you on, you steal the show
Boy, you should get an award
(As a matter a fact boy, ya' know that I do)
I nominate you
Can't no other brother put that thing down like you do
Ain't no other way to say it baby, you're the truth
Keep doing what you do
I'm nominating you
I nominate you
For the best kissing and love scene
For the best sequel that I've seen
You know what I mean boy, you're the truth
Keep doing what you do
I'm nominating you

[Verse 2]
Boy, you keep my attention
You make me stay tuned
And now all I ever wanna do is keep on watching you
I like how ya do it
When you make it move
You make my body react
Wanna run it back
One on one with you

[Pre-Chorus]
(When we're alone)
The only sound you'll hear is me saying ooooh, oooh
(Won't be talking, no more)
Only love making from there boy, that's the rules

[Chorus]
Let's keep the lights on cause tonight I wanna watch you perform
(Watch ya perform, let me see whatcha got for yo girl now baby)
When I turn you on, you steal the show
Boy, you should get an award
(As a matter a fact boy, ya' know that I do)
I nominate you
Can't no other brother put that thing down like you do
Ain't no other way to say it baby, you're the truth
Keep doing what you do
I'm nominating you
I nominate you
For the best kissing and love scene
For the best sequel that I've seen
You know what I mean boy, you're the truth
Keep doing what you do
I'm nominating you

[Outro]
He keeps it real with me he ain't gotta front man
Don't need no body double he does his own stunts man
Scream action in the bedroom
And he keeps jumping
Soon as I yell cut
He wraps it up
And there's no...
