[Verse 1]
The opportunity's taking me over
I'm going to put on a mask
I've got to be outrageous for my fans
I am not going to waste this moment
Because these moments don't last
So tonight I will shake it and show my ass

[Chorus]
Flash
Makes me feel good
Feel like a queen
And it gives me all the panache
That I want
That I need
And it'll all be over in a flash

[Verse 2]
Roll out the carpet give me some exposure
Because soon I'll be the past
But anyway I came here to tell you about my plans
Well
Let's keep this moving while people still notice
Because my time's going fast
And when it's over, it's over
Because I've got no class
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus] [x4]
