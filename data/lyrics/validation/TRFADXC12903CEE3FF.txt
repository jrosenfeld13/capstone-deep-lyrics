"The gods are great, I am the greatest"
Mother of earth, mother of all
Father of air, father of all
Brother in flames
Sister of seas
Gods of my world, behold...
Flame my desire
To grow and to breed
The wisdom I need

Gather in the storms asunder
Condone the cosmic hibernation
Steam of rivers, the hive of oceans
Praise the father's of all significance
The reckless burden of existence
I ace the rise of the furious
The amend forces
The amend course

Gods of my world, behold...
Pour rain on the fire
The fire that burns
The day of my birth

Gods of my world, behold...
Flame my desire
To grow and to breed
The wisdom I need

Gather in the storms asunder
Condone the cosmic hibernation
Steam of rivers, the hive of oceans

Recollection, my soul connection
The thrive of reflection, affection

Forever you'll be the tongue of mine
Through time and existence
By instincts divine

Forever you'll be the sight of mine
Through time and existence
By visions divine
