Trust me to open my mouth now everybody knows
Trust me now I've let you down I'm a big mouth I suppose

This was our secret our meetings were so discreet
I promised to keep it from the ears out on the street
This was our secret we were having an affair
I couldn't keep it now the secret's everywhere

Trust me to open my mouth now everybody knows
Trust me now I've let you down I'm a big mouth I suppose

One cup runneth over loosening a jaw
Trust me to open my mouth it's not a secret anymore
We had a secret what a terrible thing to do
I couldn't see it I was so in love
So in love with you

Trust me to open my mouth now everybody knows
Trust me now I've let you down I'm a big mouth I suppose

I need a gobstopper to keep my trap shut
Should have kept my nose clean
Why's it me that gets the bad luck?

Trust me to open my mouth now everybody knows
Trust me now I've let you down I'm a big mouth I suppose
