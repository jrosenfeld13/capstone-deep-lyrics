There is a place within all of us
It is sacred, so free of judgment
And this is yours to share with who you wish
This is your sanctuary, sanctuary
There is no boundary, no rule to adhere
There is love, there is hate
There is want, there is need
There is greed
You can laugh, you can cry
For you are free on the inside
This is your sanctuary, sanctuary
Take this light, hold it high, feel it shine
I know now that here inside this is mine, this is yours
This is your sanctuary
