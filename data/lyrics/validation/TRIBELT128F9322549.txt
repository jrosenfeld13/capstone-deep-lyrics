Verse 1:
I'm looking at you while your sleeping here beside me
Oh, mere words can't explain the love I have inside
It's more than just a physical thing, I know
It's something like a spiritual connection
I feel it in my soul heart and mind

The sweetest thing is what you are
From you, I'll never be too far
Please say forever you will stay beside me

Chorus:
You're my past, my future
My all, my everything
My six in the morning when the clock rings
And I open up my eyes to a new day
My Laughs, my frowns
My ups, My downs
It's a feeling that you get when you know that somethings true
When I think of love I think of you

Verse 2:
You're beautiful like the colours of the rainbow
Warm hearted like the rays of the sun on summer days
All I got to do is look into your eyes to lose myself
You're the substance of my dreams, epitomy of women
The only one I truly call mine

The sweetest thing is what you are
From you, I'll never be too far
Please say forever you will stay beside me

Chorus:
You're my past, my future
My all, my everything
My six in the morning when the clock rings
And I open up my eyes to a new day
My Laughs, my frowns
My ups, My downs
It's a feeling that you get when you know that somethings true
When I think of love I think of you

Oohh when I think of love I think of you
Baby I love you, baby I need you
