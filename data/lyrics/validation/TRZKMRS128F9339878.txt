They say for every boy and girl
There's just one love in this whole world
And I know I've found mine

The heavenly touch of your embrace
Tells me no one could take your place
Ever in my heart

Young love, first love
Filled with deep devotion
Young love, our love
We share with deep emotion

Just one kiss from your sweet lips
Will tell me that our love is real
And I can feel that it's true

For we will vow to one another
There will never be another
Love for you or for me

Young love, first love
Filled with deep devotion
Young love, our love
We share with deep emotion

Young love, first love
Filled with deep devotion
Young love, first love
Filled with deep devotion
