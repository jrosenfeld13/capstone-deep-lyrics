Here's a message from Radio City
The night is cold and I am alone out here
While you're driving along on a one lane road
My signal is fading, as far as your wheels can go

Here a little bit, just a little bit
You know heaven can wait for me

I'm the ghost in your headlights
If you look in the moonlight
You'll see that I'm out there
My eyes are burning
I breathe in the air that is turning around you

Here a little bit, just a little bit
You know heaven can wait for me

Here's a message from Radio City
I'm not ready for you to forget me
I'm racing the miles inbetween us
But how can I reach you when you don't recieve me

Here a little bit, just a little bit
You know heaven can wait for me
