If you're like me, then you know me
Oh, you know me, yeah, you know me
[x2]

Paid rent 4 weeks delayed
Fucked up in a 3-point turn
Can't give two shits these days
Packed one more bag, no return
Love that song the deejays hate
Fell asleep at the crack of dawn
Found the world in an awful state
No one, no one to depend upon
Fell asleep in the 5-1-0
Woke up in the 8-1-8
Nyquil at SFO, caffeine, caffeine at JFK

If I'm the sum of all my friends
Then all my friends are some of me
And if you're some way just like them
Then I am you to some degree

If you're like me, then you know me
Oh, you know me, yeah, you know me
[x2]

Life kills rebels, death gets the rest
So don't deny me your company
Let's just drive fast, let's drive west

Woke up in a bucket seat
Moved back in with the folks
Hung up after the beep. OD, OD'ed on Diet Cokes
Hit mute on the president
Stayed home dressed to the nines
Machine stole my 25 cent
Just can't, can't sing inside the lines
Sleepless in the 5-0-9
Touched down in plus 4-4
Breakfast Sunset and Vine
Supper off Place de la Concorde

If I'm the sum of all my friends
Then all my friends are some of me
And if you're some way just like them
Then I am you to some degree

If you're like me, then you know me
Oh, you know me, yeah, you know me
[x2]

(You don't know me.)
