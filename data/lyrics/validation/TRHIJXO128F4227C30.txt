I promised you the world again
Everything within my hands
All the riches one could dream
They will come from me

I hoped that you could understand
That this is not what I had planned
Please don't worry now
It will turn around

Cause I need more time
Just a few more months and we'll be fine
So say what's on your mind
Cause I can't figure out just what's inside

I hoped that you could understand
That this is not what I had planned
Please don't worry now
It will turn around

Cause I need more time
Just a few more months and we'll be fine
So say what's on your mind
Cause I can't figure out just what's inside
So say alright
Cause I know we can make it if we try
Cause I need more time
Just a few more months and we'll be fine

We're off to new lands
So hold on to my hands
It's gonna be alright
It's a whole lot brighter
So stand by the fire
It's gonna be alright
Yeah, the road gets harder
But it's not much farther
It's gonna be alright
You know that it ain't easy
Please believe me
It's gonna be alright

Please don't worry now
It will turn around

Cause I need more time
Just a few more months and we'll be fine
So say what's on your mind
Cause I can't figure out just what's inside
So say alright
Cause I know we can make it if we try
Cause I need more time
Just a few more months and we'll be fine
