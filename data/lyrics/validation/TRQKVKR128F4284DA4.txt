They said the surface was suffocating
They said the distance wasn't worth the waiting
They said the pressure could crush the spirit of a man
But none of them see the heavens
From the place where I stand

She is the brightest star that's in the sky
She is the reason every astronaut would fly
I see the lighting clouds of white on cobalt fields of blue
And I close my eyes and sigh
I can't believe it's true

The moon is burning bright
I saw her face tonight
I touched the seamless beauty with my hands
I'm never going back again

They said I'm foolish
Fleeting hopes in borrowed dreams
They said forget her
The moon is far beyond your reach
I would run out of fuel long before I'd ever land
But none of them can see this world
From the place where I stand
