Watch out for your friends
They may lose in the end
Sometimes they'll try to make you sin
But what is a man without a friend?
We all live within this game
The word "excuse" has many names
Where true friends really come
You can't afford to lose one

If all me where truly brothers
Why then, do we hurt one another?
Love and peace from ocean to ocean
Somebody please, second my emotion

All men where born to be free, yeah
What about you, and what about me?
This world is filled with hate
There's nothing left
If you enslave me, you'll never rescue yourself

Well, jealousy as I recall
Has always been man's hardest fault
To conquer fear, oh that's quite a quest
Until we do never rest
A child was born yesterday
Nothing but an innocent babe
Someone scored a bit of seed
How could he grow, but a bit of weed

Society, how can you teach (I wanna know)
If you don't practice what you preach?
All men where born to be free, yeah

If all me where truly brothers
Why then, do we hurt one another?
Love and peace from ocean to ocean
Somebody please, second my emotion

All men where born to be free, yeah
What about you, and what about me
This world is filled with hate
There's nothing left
If you enslave me, you'll only hurt yourself

Hey you, over there
I want to know why are you there
With all your riches
And your fancy things, can you tell me
How many friends can you truly say you have?
