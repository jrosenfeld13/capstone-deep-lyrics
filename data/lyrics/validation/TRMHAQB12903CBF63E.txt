Train the fools in politics to placate the fortunate
Apologies for you -- our gift of unglues
Short of shallow thinking, our leaking ship is sinking
Precious few survive, Humpty dumpty finance

Wall street suit n ties weave corporate lies
Aig the crime -- bailout corrupt lies?

Look at all this run around, blaming one another
Point the finger, stuff your pockets
Wink at one another
Rub your cocks with sweat
From backs the working stiffs blue collar
Think of your mistakes
As you fall and break your crown
