He walked these tracks and never looked around
He bums what he can get in any town
He's grown content to live on charity
I've been down so long it looks like up to me

I make excuses when I read the news
On the side of some ole dirty train
He's conjures up a taste of fantasy
I've been down so long it looks like up to me

I've been down so long it looks like up to me
Well, I pushed him off the ladder of success
That's true
But down here on the bottom I get rest

He's saved his thoughts to buy a memory

I've been down so long it looks like up to me
Ahhhh

I put my finger in his mind's eye
And I've given him a reason now to cry
I put his song of life in the wrong key
I've been down so long it looks like up to me

Yeah, he's been down so long it looks like up to me
Poor Lee, I wish you would come up here Lee, you're breaking my heart down there
I wish you would tell this story to everybody
Listen to him crying down there
You keep secrets
Poor Lee
You've hurt me
I'm sorry
I'll never forget
Haahhhh
I'm a poor sport
Hahhhh
