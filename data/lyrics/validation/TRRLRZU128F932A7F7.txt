Cracking up, I'm getting ready to go
Had enough, I can't take any more
No pills that I can take
This is too real and there ain't no escape

It scare the daylights
It make a nightmare
I'm tense and I'm nervous
Everybody all around me
Shakin' hands and sayin' howdie

I don't think it's funny no more

Cracking up, Like a worn out shoe
Ain't wet, but the world leakin' through
I'd run, but I find no pace
I laugh, but it's wrecking me
Wrecking me

It make a shiver, it make a shake
It make a monster, just like an earthquake
Everybody havin' fun
I don't know how they can carry on

'Cause I don't think it's funny no more

At dead of night time, at crack of dawn
It comes upon me without warning
If I were a gunman I would shoot
I'd tear the hair out by the root
I'd make a knife out of a notion
All at sea in an ocean of a emotion

I don't think it's funny no more
I don't think it's funny no more
Cracking up

I don't think it's funny no more
Cracking up
I don't think it's funny no more
Cracking up
I don't think it's funny no more
Cracking up
I don't think it's funny no more
Cracking up
