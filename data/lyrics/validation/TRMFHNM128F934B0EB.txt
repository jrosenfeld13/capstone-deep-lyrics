[Verse 1]
I'm growing nervous with the Helium Creed
They don't deserve us 'cause they won't buy our speed
But when I take it why do my eardrums bleed?
I'm growing nervous with the Helium Creed

I'm growing nervous with the Helium Creed
I'm growing nervous, I'm growing nervous
I'm growing nervous, (babbling)

[Chorus]
Helium Creed
Helium Creed
Helium Creed
Ha ha ha
Helium Creed
Creed
Creed
Ha ha ha

[Verse 2]
I'm growing nervous with the Helium Creed
Feeling the fear with all the fill of my feed
I bear the bricks that break the blocks of the breed
And grasp at green grass with the girth of my greed

I'm feeling nervous with the Helium Creed
I don't deserve this with the Helium Creed
I'm growing nervous, I'm growing nervous
I'm growing nervous, I'm growing nervous

[Chorus]
Helium Creed
Helium Creed
Helium Creed
