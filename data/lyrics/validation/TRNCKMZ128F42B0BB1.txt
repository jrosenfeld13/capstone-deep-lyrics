He wrote a song six years ago while playing in a wedding band

[George]
The word got out and suddenly his band was super in demand

[Impersonator 0]
People call him the wedding singer
He sang at weddings and soon the name was out

[Holly]
But he got dumped by his fiance and then...
He just snapped
He just snapped
He just snapped
He just snapped
He just snapped

[Impersonator 1]
He met a girl named Julia
Who saved him from his tale of woe

{Impersonator 2]
*speaks Filipino*

[Sammy]
For those of you who speak Filipino, you know that things ended up the way they should

[Impersonator 3]
That's the way that the story ends

[Rosie]
Care to dance?

[Impersonator 3]
Yes I would come on granny show me what you're made of

[Master Of Ceremony]
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. and Mrs. Robbie Hart!

[Robbie & Julia]
If I told you what I'm feeling now inside
You'd be certain there's not a single thing that we should hide
If I hold you...there's one problem you should know...
If I hold you... I might not ever let you go

*All*
Never let you go...
Never let you go...

[Robbie]
So when it's your wedding day
And my music starts to play
I can guarantee that

[ALL]
Oh oh ohhhhhhhhh
Woo oh-oh

*all*
LOVE WILL ALWAYS FIND YOU!

[Robbie]
Yeah when it's your wedding day
All the problems melt away
If you count on me
Cuz love is what...
Yes, love is what...
[all]
Oh oh ohhhhhhhhhh
Woo oh-oh


[Robbie-spoken]

[Julia-spoken]

*ALL*
*I DOOOOOOOOO....*

Love is what I DOOOOOOOOOO....
