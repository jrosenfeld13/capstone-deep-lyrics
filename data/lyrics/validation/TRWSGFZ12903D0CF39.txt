So you're done with dealing
Yeah, so you don't say?
Caught in the river
The dam is broke
But you just want to stay

Oh, we all got our reasons
Oh, a story to tell
Oh, you can look but you won't find it here, child
Oh, no you won't
Oh, nothings left but blood in the wall

You've been gone for so long now
Save your pity, so thats what you say
You were never caught in the river
You broke the dam
It's where you want to stay

Oh, we all got our reasons
Oh, a story to tell
Oh, you can look but you won't find it here, child
Oh, no you won't
Oh, nothings left but blood in the wall

So you're done with dealing
Yeah, so you don't say?
