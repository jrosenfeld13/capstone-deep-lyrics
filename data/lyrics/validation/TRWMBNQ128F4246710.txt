The instinctive hope faded, all causes lost
Repeated fatalities erased all sense of will
Nothing pleased me, I longed for loneliness
Alone with my visionary dreams of darkness

Surrounded by failure, my mind bleeds with bitterness
I'm let down by life, how can I go on

All my thoughts gathered, I concentrate on dying
Impure speculations rise within to dominate

These thoughts are suicidal breeding on deep depression
I'm ruled by this wicked urge to perish, end this living lie

Convinced I want to die, I put my theory in practice
Convinced, I put my theory in practice

Crossing the border between present and non-existent

Plunging into an eerie abstract dimension
Though I'm carnally gone, depression remains
Let down by life and deceived by death
I can't free my soul from the failures

Out of reach from myself, cannot touch, no longer feel
Arguments for the cosmic creation
Pathetic, end this living lie

Convinced I want to die, I put my theory in practice
Convinced, I put my theory in practice
