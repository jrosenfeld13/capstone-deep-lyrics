[Verse 1]
There's lightning flashing in my mirror
Thunders' rolling up behind
Big grey clouds are full of [?]
Full of tears to make me blind
I can't let his memory catch me
I can't stop to cry alone
I'm just running down a highway
One jump ahead of the storm

[Chorus]
One jump ahead of the crying
One jump ahead of his cold, deceiving eyes
One jump ahead of his lying
One jump ahead of the storm

[Verse 2]
One day I looked on the horizon
I saw his love just wouldn't last
Before my mind was torn to pieces
I had to leave and get out fast
And so I slicked out of his power
I saw my chance and got me gone
Before the rain could start to falling
One jump ahead of the storm

[Chorus]
One jump ahead of the crying
One jump ahead of his cold, deceiving arms
One jump ahead of his lying
One jump ahead of the storm

One jump ahead of the storm
One jump ahead of the storm
One jump ahead of the storm
One jump ahead of the storm
One jump ahead of the storm
One jump ahead of the storm
