So long, goodbye. I never cried that much for you
But that's a lie, just like the book youe seeing through
You don't know why you hate the human things you do
But when you die, lover you'll be sorry, sorry
Cuz when you die - what if you don't fly?
Your righteous life has only been
A stiffled chance to find out what that thing was for
So take a chance - you don't convince me anymore
You need a screw, you need to cast away your blinds
Cuz when I blew all the elation wasn't mine
And when you find oh yeah God was in your mind
Your righteous life has only been
A righteous lie, oh yeah, open up your eyes
