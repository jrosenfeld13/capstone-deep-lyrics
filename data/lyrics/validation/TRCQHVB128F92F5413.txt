Go Gos
Vacation
Get Up And Go
(Charlotte Caffey/Jane Wiedlin)

If you get up and walk away
Leave the past behind
Go ahead and take a ride
No telling what you'll find

The words you say don't mean a thng
They fly right by my eyes
Lokin the mirror don't look at me
Maybe then you'll realize

CHORUS
So get up and go
If you're so tired of moving slow

I was on the inside
Looking out for you
But you're the one to make the change
There's nothing I can do

Now's the time for you to move
Actions shout out loud
So cut the talk and move your feet
Cuz words get lost in crowds

CHORUS

Quit talking
Start walking now
