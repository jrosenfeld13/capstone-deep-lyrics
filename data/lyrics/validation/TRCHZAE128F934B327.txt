When the stars are right and you're alone
Take a journey, lock the world tight
Out of your mind
The hall beckons your presence, the doors
Open wide you're to decide to turn back
Deep the bowels of this black abyss
Compelled I just can't resist it, take me

Take me away take me away
I wanna know what's deep within
Take me away

Drawing near someone passes through me
A silent entity never looking back I won't dare
Evil eyes staring through he walls of stone
As I feared I travel not alone
Laughter's echoes with the blatant wind
I have passed the threshold deep within me

A voice of thunder said turn back
Tabernacle is forbidden
No mortal dares to enter here
I want to know

Flame is burning center of a fountain yearning, waters
Spring eternal, spiritual water physical fire
Above center is sky, cold neverness
Just vastness filled with stars upon stars
In the four corners of life are the golden mirrors
Reflecting what you are and what you are to be

In the first is a young boy white dove in
His hand, in the second is a warrior in armor
In the third is the old man gold watch
In his hand fourth and last
No reflection at all
No reflection at all
No reflection at all

Waters rise toward physical fire, voice says
Tabernacle is forbidden never looking back I don't dare
If the water touches the flame
Forever in darkness yes I'll remain
White dove flies from the young boys hand
Through the mirror of the old man, only way out
