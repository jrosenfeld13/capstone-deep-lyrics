I heard this afternoon
From the neighborhood slut, Claudine
She said Oliver is leaving soon
So we can make a scene

We're gonna have fun
Oliver's house
Make a lot of white noise
Fun, Oliver's house
Play with the white boys

Last June, Oliver threw a party 4 his girl, Louise
She got drunk
And called me a bitch
Just cuz I kissed him

[Repeat x2]
Fun
Oliver's house

Oliver's got a swimming pool piano in his bathroom
We took turns throwing down
We took turns throwing up

Gonna have fun
Oliver's house
Make a lot of white noise
Fun, Oliver's house
Play with the white boys

Fun, Oliver's house
Make a lot of white noise
Fun, Oliver's house
Play with the white boys

U should see his mother's room
She's got so many fine clothes
Oliver
He dressed me up
And then he undressed me slowly

Oliver is so weird
But he knows how 2 play guitar
I'm a sucker 4 a major chord
A ride in an open car

We're gonna have fun
Oliver's house

[Repeat x3]
Fun, Oliver's house
We're gonna have fun

[Repeat x27]
Fun
