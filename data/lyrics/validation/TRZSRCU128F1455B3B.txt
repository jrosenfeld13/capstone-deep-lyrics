Making like a Romeo, making on a Juliet (she said)
Maybe you're a Montague, maybe you're a Capulet
Maybe you don't trust me yet, let me light your cigarette
Be you shark, be you jet, never forget that

Love conquers all
Love conquers all
When Bogart saw Bacall
He knew that love conquers all
(Woah) It's only love, yeah
Love conquers all
(Woah) It's only love, yeah
Love conquers all

Making life a monument, making love a strategy (she said)
Baby, you're so confident, why the hell you asking me
Savages from hostile tribes, slug it out on alibies
All for love, all just lies, open those eyes (sing)

Love conquers all (L-O-V-E love)
Love conquers all (L-O-V-E love)
When hate is strong, and fear stands tall
Love conquers all (L-O-V-E love)
(Woah) It's only love, yeah
Love conquers all
(Woah) It's only love, yeah
Love conquers all (yeah)

Anyone who loves you, anyone who breaks your heart
Anyone who makes you feel this way
Feelings deep enough to swim in, back stroke, or crawl
It's just the beginning, love conquers all

Love conquers all (L-O-V-E love)
Love conquers all (L-O-V-E love)
You can beg, steal or crawl (L-O-V-E love)
But love conquers all (L-O-V-E love)

When hate is strong, and fear stands tall
Love conquers all

(L-O-V-E, L-O-V-E, love conquers all)
Woah (L-O-V-E, L-O-V-E, love conquers all)
Woah, L-O-V-E
(L-O-V-E, L-O-V-E, love conquers all)
