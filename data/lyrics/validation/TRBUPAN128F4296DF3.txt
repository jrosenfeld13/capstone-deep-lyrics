Here I am driving around at 3 am
Looking for people I don't know

They said "party at 1:32"
And I said "yeah, I wanna go"
Because the night is still young
And the bed is just cold
And I'm tired of spending time all alone

Well I'm driving around and I can't find nothing
Maybe she said 1:36 or something
I don't want to give up and go home
At 1:32 they turned out the light
Maybe I didn't get the address right
But if I go home now I'll never know

Because the night is still young
And the bed is just cold
And I'm tired of hanging around all alone

Well the party's getting mellow at 5 am
That's when the dreamy things happen
A green and purple fog begins to glow
When you're tired tired and you can't talk straight
That's the way I wanna communicate
'Cause then a certain feeling starts to show

And the night is still young
And the bed is still cold
And I'm tired of hanging around all alone
