Never will forget that day
When they had me in Parchman Jail
Would no one even come and go my bail
I wonder how long
Before I can change my clothes?
I wonder how long
'Fore I can change my clothes?

So many days I would be sittin' down
I would be sittin' down lookin' down on my clothes
I wonder how long
Before I can change my clothes?
I wonder how long
'Fore I can change my clothes

So many days when the day would be cold
They would car' me out in the rain and cold
I wonder how long
Before I can change my clothes?
I wonder how long
'Fore I can change my clothes?

So many days when the day would be cold

You can stand and look at these convict toes
I wonder how long
Before I can change my clothes?
I wonder how long
'Fore I can change my clothes?

So many days I would be
Walkin' down the road
I can hardly walk for lookin' down on my clothes
I wonder how long
Before I can change my clothes?
I wonder how long
'Fore I can change my clothes

Never will forget that day
When they taken my clothes
Taken my citizen's clothes
And throwed them away
Wonder how long
Before I can change my clothes?
I wonder how long
'Fore I can change my clothes
