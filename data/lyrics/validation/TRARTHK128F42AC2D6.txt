[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Melt in the sun, melt in the sun
Who wants to come with me and melt in the sun
Hide in the sky, hide in the sky
Who wants to come with me and hide in the sky

[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
You and me should go outside and beat them, beat them, beat them, beat them, beat them beat them
All pathetic flag waving ignorant geeks and we'll eat them eat them eat them eat them eat them eat them

[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Come join the cause, come join the cause
Who wants to come with me and come join the cause
Hide in the sky, hide in the sky
Who wants to come with me and hide in the sky

[Chorus: Serj Tankian & Daron Malakian]
You and me should go outside and beat them, beat them, beat them, beat them, beat them beat them
All pathetic flag waving ignorant geeks and we'll eat them eat them eat them eat them eat them eat them
You and me should go outside and beat them, beat them, beat them, beat them, beat them beat them
All pathetic flag waving ignorant geeks and we'll eat them eat them eat them eat them eat them eat them

[Bridge: Serj Tankian]
Realise you're blind
And we're out of time
It'll show your mind

[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Melt in the sun, melt in the sun
Who wants to come with me and melt in the sun
Hide in the sky, hide in the sky
Who wants to come with me and hide in the sky

[Chorus: Serj Tankian and Daron Malakian]
You and me should go outside and beat them, beat them, beat them, beat them, beat them beat them
All pathetic flag waving ignorant geeks and we'll eat them eat them eat them eat them eat them eat them
You and me should go outside and beat them, beat them, beat them, beat them, beat them beat them
All pathetic flag waving ignorant geeks and we'll eat them eat them eat them eat them eat them eat them eat them eat them eat them...

[Outro: Daron Malakian and Serj Tankian]
It'll show your mind
That you have a mind
