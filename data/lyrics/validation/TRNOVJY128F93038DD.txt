Sittin in a hotel miles from nowhere
Thought that this would be my happiness
I look at the phone and pick it up
For the millionth time I put it down again

I know I let you go
And I've got no right to know

[Chorus:]
Do you ever get lonely baby
Don't you ever get tired of living that way
Don't you ever wonder whether there's a better life
Out there yeah
Do you ever think about what we had
And how you'd give anything to get it back
Do you ever think you'll never love that way again

Wonder and if only
Do you ever get lonely

I look around the room and wonder
When it was and how my life has changed
I'm surrounded by a million so called friends
And I don't even know their names

When all of your love is gone
And you you feel like you don't belong
Oh tell me

[Chorus:]
I know that this world has changed us
Now we're nothing more than strangers
But do you think about me ever
Do you think we belong together

[Chorus:]
Do you ever miss me
Wishing you could kiss me
If only you could hold me
Do you ever get lonely
Like me....
