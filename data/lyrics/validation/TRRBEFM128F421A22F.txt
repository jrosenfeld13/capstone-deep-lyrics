It's morning two and you haven't called me
It's like a thorn burning in my side
Open the blinds, but something is different, can't put my finger on it
The bright clean air makes me wanna hide

'Cause now, oh now, this is how it ends
Based on promises that we'll still be friends

But ba da, ba da, ba ba, ba da, I know it'll never be the same
Ba da, ba da, ba ba, ba da, now it's all been broken
Ba da, ba da, ba ba, ba da, I know it'll never be the same
Ba da, ba da, ba ba, ba da, you know I'd still do anything for you

Where is the day you used to inspire me
Where is the time I used to depend
On the relief of your anchor I thought I'd never need
Now that it's gone, will I slip away

So now, oh now, this is how it ends
Based on promises that we'll still be friends

But ba da, ba da, ba ba, ba da, I know it'll never be the same
Ba da, ba da, ba ba, ba da, now it's all been broken
Ba da, ba da, ba ba, ba da, I know it'll never be the same
Ba da, ba da, ba ba, ba da, you know I'd still do anything

This is only a letter
Jumbled words, no false pretense
And it's not a true confession
'Cause you've cost me much more than you'll ever guess
But I'm not your fallen hero
Someone who came to your defense
And when it's all done and over
I'll make it, I'll make it, I'll make it, I'll make it make sense

No, it'll never be...
No, it'll never be...
No, it'll never be...
No, it'll never be...

Ba da, ba da, ba ba, ba da, I know it'll never be the same
Ba da, ba da, ba ba, ba da, now it's all been broken
Ba da, ba da, ba ba, ba da, I know it'll never be the same
Ba da, ba da, ba ba, ba da, you know I'd throw it all away...
