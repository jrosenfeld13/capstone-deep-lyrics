[Verse 1]
Girl, you tell me I'm your only fellow
But I've seen you out with other guys
I've seen you kissing them too, you laughed and said it wasn't true
Cause you know where my weakness lies

[Chorus]
Girl, yeah you can always get through to me
No matter how much wrong you do to me
I'm helpless, ain't nothing I can do
Cause you know my weakness is you

[Verse 2]
I built a wall around my heart
When you left me for that other man
But brick by brick, girl, you tore it down
And I found myself loving you again

[Chorus]
Somehow you always get through to me
No matter how much wrong you do to me
I'm helpless, ain't nothing I can do
Cause you know my weakness is

[Bridge]
And I'm just your fool
Baby, baby, baby
I said the next time you knocked on my door
I rehearsed and planned to send you away
But the words I rehearsed came out in reverse
Instead of sending you away, I begged you to stay

[Chorus]
Girl, you know you can always get through to me
No matter how much wrong you do to me
I'm helpless, ain't nothing I can do
Cause you know my weakness is my, my baby
Oh no you can always get through to me
No matter how much wrong you do to me
I'm helpless, ain't nothing I can do
Cause you know my my my my my my my
Girl, you know you can always get through to me
No matter how much wrong you do to me
I tell you I'm helpless...
