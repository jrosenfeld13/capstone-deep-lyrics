Close your eyes
Close the door
You don't have to worry anymore
I'll be your baby tonight

Shut the light
Shut the shade
You don't have to be afraid
I'll be your baby tonight

Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away
We're gonna forget it
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon
But we're gonna let it
You won't regret it

Kick your shoes off
Do not fear
Bring that bottle over here
I'll be your baby tonight
