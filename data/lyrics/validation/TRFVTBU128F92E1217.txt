Everybody now....

Everybody has a part to play
And all of us make one
Work together it'll be okay
That's the way that it's done....

Realizing that it's more than you
And it's more than me
Hand in hand you know that we can't lose
We can do anything....

Oh....
When it's all of us, any dream is reachable
Oh....
And we're stronger because we know....

We're gettin' it right
All together
There's nothing we can't do
We're gettin' it right
Makin' it better
It's a beautiful world, too
Oh....celebrate again
'Cause we're livin' in harmony
We're gettin' it right
We're gettin' it right....

We can make it standing side by side
That's where we belong
Everything is gonna turn out right
Together we can't go wrong....

Oh....
When it's all of us, any dream is reachable
Oh....
And we're stronger because we know....

We're gettin' it right
All together
There's nothing we can't do
We're gettin' it right
Makin' it better
It's a beautiful world, too
Oh....celebrate again
'Cause we're livin' in harmony
We're gettin' it right....

And you're right here with me
