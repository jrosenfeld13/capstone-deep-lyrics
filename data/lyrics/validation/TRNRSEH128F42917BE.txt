Park the car, make it quick
Wonderful, haggard girl
Pale in spite Scandinavian sun
Freckled arms, freckled face
Grass stained jeans, bruised knees
Delicate with sneakers on
Anywhere, anytime
Anywhere, anytime
Anywhere, anytime
We'll be there
Long before the others will
Undressed now, hidden in bush
Scotch tight skin round vertebrae
Clinging on to velvet leaves
Finished now, jump back in
Red hot seat burns through skirt
Just a kiss and we're on our way
Anywhere, anytime
Anywhere, anytime
Anywhere, anytime
We'll be there
Long before the others will
Finished now, jump back in
Red hot seat burns through skirt
Just a kiss and we're on our way
Anywhere, anytime
Anywhere, anytime
Anywhere, anytime
We'll be there
Long before the others will
