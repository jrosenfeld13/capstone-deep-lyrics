(m. riperton r. rudolph)

Everytime he comes around I feel like I'm on fire
When he looks into my eyes and sees down to my soul
It's so hard for me to tell if this is just desire
Or the love I need to make my spirit whole
How am I to know?

Now I ain't lookin' for a man to hold me for an hour
I ain't lookin' for a man to love me for a day
Every time he comes around I get the funny feelin'
What I'm looking for don't matter anyway
Hey, it don't matter anyway

'cause every since I was a child
I dreamed about my baby's smile
It scares me so to say
I wanna be with him in the worst darn way

Cause every time he comes around I feel like I'm on fire
When he whispers in my ear I start to lose control
Still it's so hard for me to tell if this is just desire
Or the love I need to make my spirit whole
How am I to know?

Cause every since I was a child
I dreamed about my baby's smile
It scares me so to say
I wanna be with him in the worst darn way

Cause every time he comes around I feel like I'm on fire
Mmmm, I lose control
Still it's so hard for me to tell if this is just desire
Or the love I need to make my spirit whole
