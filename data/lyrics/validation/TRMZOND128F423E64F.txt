Spring isn't shy here
It's sunny and green
Back to a room
Between
Somewhere and nowhere
I love to be
So i lay down and wonder:
If you ever think of me

See many faces
With no names
Eat local dishes
From somewhere nowhere
I'm lost and free
So i think and i wonder
If you ever think of me

Cause you and i
Are never under the same sky

Every day
And every night
I say hello
I mean goodbye
From somwhere nowhere
So i sing and i wonder
If you ever think of me

Cause you and i
Are never under the same sky

Days go by
Dreams turn gray
Sooner or later
We all run away
Somewhere nowhere
We'll always be
And with our wings on the doorway
About to break free
I'll stop and i'll wonder
If you ever think of me
