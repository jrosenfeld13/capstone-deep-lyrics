Fading light, broken hearts, I left them all behind
Turned to stone, I choose to roam the wild world
Broken dreams, pools of tears, nothing do they mean
Came the night, to pay the price of love

[Chorus:]
I see the faces in the fire, still burning
I feel the hunger of the flame, reaching to me
I see the faces in the fire, I'm learning
I'm just a fool in Paradise, (in love) and I'll never get free

I turned away so long ago, looking for the change
My promises, they rode upon the wind
Came the night the air was cold, with a flood of memories
Coming back to haunt my empty soul

(8 counts - top of 3rd bar)

[Chorus]
