It doesn't matter if it's day or night
Cause when the evil comes it won't need no light
It might not be what you expect to see

No difference if it's rain or shine
If you don't run your life ain't worth a dime
You've got to find a way to dissappear

Good and bad so close together
If they catch you it's now or never
Better listen closely now
Here's my advise

Don't you believe a stranger
He might just take your life
He's gonna be much stronger
You'd better run and hide

Don't you believe a stranger
Cause you're not supposed to do
You can't relate to danger
Try to escape

If you keep standing in the danger zone
They' ll gonna catch ya 'til you're chilled to the bone
There is is hardly nothing they have to fear

You better try to keep the distance
Otherwise they might break your resistence
You could be the next one in the line

Good and bad so close together
If they catch you it's now or never
Better listen closely now
Here's my advise

Don't you believe a stranger......
