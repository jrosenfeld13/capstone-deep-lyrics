I'm tired of living alone
I've just discovered alone
I feel uncovered with you
I feel right here
I'm kind of silly I know
I'm not your lover although
I shouldn't bother
I fall for the deep clear

Eyes blue
And you know
I'm in line with you here

I've tried to give you enough
I learned from living it rough
I think I know when I must
Make myself clear
I'm tired of living alone
And I've discovered alone
When I'm uncovered with you
I feel right here

Can't you see
I can fly
But I'm not free

Careful you
All alone
In the clear blue clear

And if you see
I can fly
But I'm not free

It's kind of silly I know
I'm not your lover although
I shouldn't bother
I fall for the deep clear

I can fly through the clear blue

Carefree
Dry my eyes in a cool breeze
Can't you see I've a soul too
I suppose I really love you will
I'm in love with a lie still
And carefree
I can fly but I'm not free here
I can fly but I'm not free
