[Verse 1]
Loretta you know I love you so
But your daddy said I'd best not come around
But meet me here again tonight
We'll leave behind this deep dark hollow road

[Verse 2]
Loretta let's leave this minin' town
Can't stand the thoughts of darkness underground
Coal dust ashes everywhere
We need pure free honeysuckle mountain air

[Chorus]
Deep dark hollow, where the sun's afraid to shine
Your daddy owns this hollow from the top of the mountain to the bottom of the deep dark mine
Where the mud runs deep along the road
After haulin' off Kentucky load by load

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Lorette let's hit the road tonight
Bring along your pretty [?] shoes and your Sunday clothes
Make sure your daddy doesn't know
When we leave behind this deep dark hollow road

[Chorus]
Deep dark hollow, where the sun's afraid to shine
Your daddy owns this hollow from the top of the mountain to the bottom of the deep dark mine
Where the mud runs deep along the road
After haulin' off Kentucky load by load

[Outro]
Where the mud runs deep along the road
Been haulin' off Kentucky load by load
