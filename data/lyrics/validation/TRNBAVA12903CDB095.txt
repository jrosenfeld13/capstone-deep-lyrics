Independence, terrorism
A hail of pebbles and stones
Poverty and racism
The wheel of conflict rolls on

Dictatorship, fanaticism
The battle lines drawn in mind and soil
A drop of fucking human blood
For every gallon of oil

Hightech death and Disneyland
Censorship and Jesus Christ
Dual moraled Uncle Sam
World police and fucking apple pie

The crescent and the endless
Ever changing dunes
The sun and precious black gold
A different culture language
Creed and tune
A different God I have been told

Pushed into corners hunted down
Observed, surveyed and chained
Religious fundamentalism
Prosper as preassure is sustained

Hightech death and Disneyland
Censorship and Jesus Christ
Dual moraled Uncle Sam
World police and fucking apple pie
