After all this time
You think somebody might of learned
Their lesson
After everything is gone then
What you gonna do
You think you might want to hold back
You think you might want to give back
You think you might want to turn back
Somehow things must change
And it's got to be for the better
Someday soon will bring
Peace and love to share
With your brother
You think it might be too hard
You think it might be too far
You think it might take too long
Chorus
Situation's critical
In your life
Situation's critical
In your life
In your life
You might not ever think that
What you do makes a difference
But if you'd only try
You might save someone's life
So what you gonna do
It's always up to you but
Don't don't don't you give up
Don't don't don't you give up
Don't don't don't you give up
'cause when you think about it
You got to give it all you've got to give
You got to get back in and try it again
'cause that's the only way to make it today
Chorus
