Warm black asphalt
South of nowhere
I'm going there under a dirty cotton sky
When the rain comes round
I roll my window down
I lift my face to heaven
And wash these tears from my eyes

I'm just looking for some inspiration
I'm looking for something to rock my soul
I'm looking for a brand new destination
I'm looking for Elvis down a Memphis road
I'm looking for Elvis

I remember...
All those Septembers
The pledges of allegiance
The prayers of trust
I slept on those beds of hope and promise
Woke up choking on cheap paint and carnival dust

So where are you now
With all those illusions
Fallen dreams and charity
If faith restores you
And truth delivers
Then don't tell me that I'm standing
When I'm on my knees

I'm just looking for some inspiration
I'm looking for something to rock my soul
I'm looking for a brand new destination
I'm looking for Elvis down a Memphis road
I'm looking for Elvis
I'm looking for Elvis down a Memphis road
I'm looking for Elvis

You've got to give yourself over now
Roll like a river stone
There's mud in the water
There's gravel in the dust

You've got to work a little harder
Sing a little stronger
Stand up and deliver
If you want my trust

West of Babylon
East of Eden
I'm breathing in these winds of change
I'm going to rise up from these ashes
Gonna rise up and find the truth again

I'm just looking for some inspiration
I'm looking for love to soothe my soul
I'm at the crossroads of my destination and
I'm looking for Elvis down a Memphis road
I'm looking for Elvis
I'm looking for Elvis down a Memphis road
I'm looking for Elvis
