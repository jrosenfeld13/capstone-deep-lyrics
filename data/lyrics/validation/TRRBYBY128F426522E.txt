And when I die and when I'm dead, dead and gone
There'll be one child born and a world to carry on, to carry on

I'm not scared of dying and I don't really care
If it's peace you find in dying, well, then let the time be near
If it's peace you find in dying, when dying time is here
Just bundle up my coffin cause it's cold way down there
I hear that's it's cold way down there, yeah, crazy cold way down there
And when I die and when I'm gone
There'll be one child born and a world to carry on, to carry on

My troubles are many, they're as deep as a well
I can swear there ain't no heaven but I pray there ain't no hell
Swear there ain't no heaven and pray there ain't no hell
But I'll never know by living, only my dying will tell
Only my dying will tell, yeah, only my dying will tell
And when I die and when I'm gone
There'll be one child born and a world to carry on, to carry on

Give me my freedom for as long as I be. All I ask of living is to have no chains on me
All I ask of living is to have no chains on me
And all I ask of dying is to go naturally, only want to go naturally
Don't want to go by the devil, don't want to go by the demon
Don't want to go by Satan, don't want to die uneasy, just let me go naturally
And when I die and when I'm gone, there'll be one child born, there'll be one child born
When I die, there'll be one child born. When I die, there'll be one child born
When I die, there'll be one child born. When I die, there'll be one child born
