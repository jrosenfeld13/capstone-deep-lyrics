I am not here
I think I've never
Been here at all
Or ever will
I feel like a place
Where no one goes anymore
Why can't you see
That everythings broken
And why can't you see
That my lifes turned grey
I can't believe
In anything sacred
When I don't believe
That I am real

I need someone to
Break the silence
Screaming in my head
And in my soul

It seems so bizarre
But none of this matters
Thoughts disappear
And hopes have died
But now I am safe
Nothing can hurt me here
Why can't you see
My need for forgiveness
The truth and the lies
So confused as one
I can't believe
In anything sacred
When I don't believe
In anything

I need someone to
Break the silence
Screaming in my head
And in my soul

I am alone
Locked in my memories
There's nowhere left
For me to hide
But I am not real
I've made all I am
With lies
Why does it seem
That everythings different
And why does it seem
That only you are real
I don't believe
In anything sacred
So why do I feel
So damn alone

I need someone to
Break the silence
Need someone to
Break the silence
I need someone to
Break the silence
Screaming in my head
And in my soul
