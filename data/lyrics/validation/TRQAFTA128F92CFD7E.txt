I wound up on the wrong end of this town
Underneath a pale moon frowning down
I must have done somebody wrong
Should I turn back or should I go on?
I just don't know, but it's time to make up my mind
You've always been a precious little doll
I won't be there to break your hardest fall
You're saying that you wanna go home
So let me help you on with your coat
But you don't know, but it's time to make up your mind

(chorus)
The night is gone, the dawn has come, you wonder if you can face the sun, you wonder why your love is so far away
To just move on you've tried to run, you wonder if you're the only one, you wonder why you went so far astray
Your world is changing, summer is moving on
A lifetime waiting now it won't be long
I never meant to do you no harm
Should I turn back or should I go on?
I just don't know, but it's time to make up my mind

(chorus)
