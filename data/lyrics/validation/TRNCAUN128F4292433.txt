(Tim Johnson/David Malloy/Kim Williams)

You can fill your local honky-tonk with every guy in town
Tell the bartender to set 'em up, free drinks all around
Pump the jukebox full of quarters and let that music roar
And watch the boys standing there, staring at the door

'Cause it ain't a party 'till the girls arrive
When that curtain hits the air the dance floor comes alive
Let's get it started, make it last all night
Boys don't you know it ain't a party 'till the girls arrive

So hang out with your buddies, play a thousand games of pool
Pretend you're having lots of fun, but who are you trying to fool
You're waiting for the moment the girls start walking in
They get there and you're ready, the good times will begin

'Cause it ain't a party 'till the girls arrive
When that curtain hits the air the dance floor comes alive
Let's get it started, make it last all night
Boys don't you know it ain't a party 'till the girls arrive

'Cause it ain't a party 'till the girls arrive
When that curtain hits the air the dance floor comes alive
Let's get it started, make it last all night
Boys don't you know it ain't a party 'till the girls arrive

Yeah boys don't you know it ain't a party, yeah 'till the girls arrive
It ain't a party, yeah!
