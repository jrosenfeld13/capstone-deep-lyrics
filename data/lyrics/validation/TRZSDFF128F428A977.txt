Walk on, walk on, walk on, I walk on
I'm gonna keep on walkin', till I find my way back home

Well, you might gets worried, when your shoes get bend
You don't know where you goin', but you do know where you been

I see so many people happy, I can't get used to happiness
Maybe it is true, happiness is not for me, I guess

Well, the world is too high, highways are too long
No need of us bein' together, we can't get along

One more time, now, I'm gonna keep on walkin', till I find my way back home
Walk a little further, one more time, now
I'm gonna keep on walkin', till I find my way back home
Let's walk together, now
I'm gonna keep on walkin', till I find my way back home
Hey, walk on
