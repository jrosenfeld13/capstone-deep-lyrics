I hang glass from the wall, it makes my life seem big
Mirrors hang from my wall, to make my world seem big

You forced me to do things I wasn't aware of
And this is our secret and everyone does this
My future is written in closed circuit evidence
Me and my self-denial will keep you from justice and free

I wriggle and squirm as you try to convince me
And everyone stares, they know what I've been up to
The pressure engulfing me, memories orbiting me
Fits epiletic in waves leaping over me

No contact of flesh and no tongues and no touching
No fear of disease and I can't take my clothes off
I want to get fucked like a whore in a porno, it's me
Don't tell anybody, it's our dirty secret, it's me

I will protect you and shield you, prevent you from danger
You've intruded and taken away all my sweetness
But somehow these mirrors they make my existence seem bigger
Somehow these mirrors they make my existence seem bigger
