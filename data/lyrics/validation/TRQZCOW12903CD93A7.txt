Dappled in blue like a midnight moon
Over the mountain
And God we would ride down the steepest side
To the beat of a lone drum

Never knew what we got into
Always the running
Now we find that theres all the signs
Change is a-coming
Now it seems it was history
Thoughts from a past life
Now it seems only memories
Life making fast time

Come on along
And it wont take long
Those were the last words
Lay in the trees where youll always be
Over the pasture

Never knew what we got into
Always the running
Now we find that theres all the signs
Change is a-coming
Now it seems it was history
Thoughts from a past life
So it seems it was memories
Life making fast time
Now it seems only history
Thoughts from a past life
So it seems it was memories
Life making fast time

Dappled in blue like a midnight moon
Never knew what we got into
(Change is a-coming)

Now it seems only history
Thoughts from a past life
So it seems only memories
Life making fast time
