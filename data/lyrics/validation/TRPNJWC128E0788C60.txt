It's my vision
A total one
Encompassing
The only one
A world complete
That's all my own
Exactly as
As it should be, oh

I lost myself (I lost myself)
I lost myself (I lost myself)
You can't see how
Because I am just a cloud (a cloud)

Everything adds up to a truth
Maybe now, I can know me too
I have you now
Where you should be
You are mine now
But I lost me, I'm a cloud

I lost myself (I lost myself)
I lost myself (I lost myself)
You can't see how
Because I am just a cloud (a cloud)

I lost myself (I lost myself)
Because, because
I lost myself (I lost myself)
You can't see how (You can't see how)
Because I am just a cloud (a cloud)

Resplendent dream it overtook me
I had no choice but build it
I made it all
I built it up
I built it up (I lost myself)
I built it up (I lost myself)
Up...

I lost myself (I lost myself)
Because, because
Because I am just a (I lost myself)
I lost myself (I lost myself)
You can't see how (You can't see how)
Because I am just a cloud

A cloud
A cloud
A cloud

I lost myself
I lost myself
You can't see how
I lost myself
I lost myself
Because I am just a..
