Is this what you want?
It's eight o'clock
I'm nodding off

Starlight is stealing my heart tonight
Bar fight but I won't be there
And I've tried all this before

You swing and you miss and I miss the way things used to be
Late night and you're driving me crazy
Wait 'till you find this ain't the life you want to lead

Regular
Every night
Regular
But I won't fight you
What if I don't care?
What if I don't care?
What if I don't care?

Wait 'till you find this ain't the life you want to lead
Wait 'till you find

Regular
Every night
Regular
But I won't fight you
