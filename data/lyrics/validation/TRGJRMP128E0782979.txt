Day
Has begun
And I stumble
To the front
There's no
Real control
Of a random
Event

And I will take my chances
'Cos anything can happen
I don't believe it's over
'Cos anything can happen

I could never
Give it up
I could never relent
And I can't
Wait to see
What will happen
To me next

I will take my chances
'Cos anything can happen
I don't believe it's over
'Cos anything can happen

It doesn't matter
What we did wrong
Makes no difference
To me
I see the light in your eyes
And you're dancing free

And I'm coming down today
To gather in the pieces
Give in to the mystery

And I will take my chances
'Cos anything can happen
Don't believe it's over
'Cos anything can happen

One day, I
Someday, I

Anything can happen
Yeah, anything can happen

I will make it shine
I will make it rain sometime
