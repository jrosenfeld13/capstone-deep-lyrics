I was under the impression that everything was cool
I get the feeling now I'm played for a fool
So it's like that, so it's like that
How easy it is - you break my heart again

There's a train that's runnin' and I'm tied to the tracks
The things you say it's too late to take them back
So it's like that, so it's like that
How easy it is - you break my heart again
Oh yeah...

You took my best possession to the corner to hock it
I keep on feelin' your hands are in my pocket
So it's like that, so it's like that
How easy it is - you break my heart again
So it's like that, so it's like that
How easy it is - you break my heart again
Oh yeah...
