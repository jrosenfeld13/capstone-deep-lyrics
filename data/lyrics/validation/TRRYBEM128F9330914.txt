Woman, sensuous woman
You control the world Im living in
Woman, sensuous woman
Release my body and let me live again
Step by step you taught me easy lovin
Night by night you caught me in your web
My self control was overruled by passion
Now I couldnt see the heartache up ahead
Woman, sensuous woman
You control the world Im living in
Woman, sensuous woman
Release my body and let me live again
Someone true is waiting I should be with her
And she dont know I crave your ecstasy
But many hearts will break if I dont conquer
This lustful spell youve cast over me
