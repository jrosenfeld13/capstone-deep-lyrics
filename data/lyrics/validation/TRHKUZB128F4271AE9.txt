(Verse):
Why am I sitting alone tonight
When I could be out where the lights are bright?
It's all because of Jim, It's all because of Jim
Why am i wasting these precios years?
Why am I crying these bitter tears?
It's all because of Jim, It's all because of Jim

(Chorus):
Jim doesn't ever bring me pretty flowers
Jim never tries to cheer my lonely hours
Don't know why I'm so crazy for Jim
Jim never tells me I'm his hearts desire
I never seem to set his love afire
Gone are the years I've wasted on him
Sometimes when I get feeling low
I say "Let's call it quits."
Then I hang on and let him go
Breaking my heart in bits
Some day I know tht Jim will up and leave me
But even if he does you can believe me
I'll go on carrying the torch for Jim
