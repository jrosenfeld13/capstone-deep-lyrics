[Verse 1:]
So clean, chumps might run up but I keep a four-fifth
Tucked under the button-up
Nigga what I ain't feelin ya, haters
Four inch blade in the shoe, you can call them killa gators
Keep your favors,  I'm getting paper
Stones on my watch look like Life Savers (Bling!)
Grown up man, but I'm still hood with it
I'm thrown this shit up if it's got juice in it
I'll pass it up if Brew Brews hit it, now I lined, still banged, bruce bruce hit it
Now I use to bang cock in my main drop, now I bang cock in Bangkok
A grown man on account of them freaks so I treat myself to a count of them freaks
(YEE YEE YEE!)
I get my grown man on, no lights, pants on,  my grown man on


[Chorus:]
I get my grown man on
White collar with a button-up my grown man on
I might two step with my grown man on
I'm so fresh to death with my grown man on
YEE YEE YEE!
Let's get this started
All day let's get this started
All night let's get this money
(Grown man) let's get this on it


[Verse 2:]
Yeah, no Timmy shoes tonight I rock the reptiles with the button-up on
Fresh cuff links and the blue diamonds
Hella blue jean jeans with the gleam shine-ons
And I park the old school at the house, jump in the scraper
With the butter guts and the roof, I'm so gangster
I'm so grown man on I'm even rocking dreads, braided back, no band, no cap
Fresh line razor blade sharp like that
Smellin' like cologne and a purple grape bat
Sippin' Remy Martin with my pinky up toasting to gangsterhood
Sorry they ain't search me I'm too good for my gangster
I ain't tryna buy at the bar, no sir
Went adios motherfuck for her
Man I'm conversatin', tryna see if I can get in them jeans I took her arm and it was like she tryna do the same thing

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3:]
Yeah Hoodstarz pop bottles crush grapes, Remy Martin at the bar no chase
Two step witcha main thang, don't hate
If I get her in the van its a wrap, don't wait
Go dummy I scrape
She love it when my dreadlocks shake in the parking lot and two check scrape
First she told me she was feelin' Band Aide but she love my deep dark skin so ya boy check face
Let ya boy check face, Scoot let me take yo place
Jump in the guns and skate, swang her away
Dirty Harry beat don't play
Dome she can make my day, hahaha
Here what I say: let's make that hoodstar cake, roll the candle get cream in your face (Cream in ya face)
I gets my grown man on, thang long for your chick
Get my grown man dome

[Chorus x2]
