You...
My phone's not ringin'
My doorbell isn't singin'
My bed is empty
I'm fragile, all I do is cry
Because you left me
And you didn't even want me
I'm lost and lonely
Can't live without you

You
Every beat of my heart
Every day of my life
Every thought on my mind
Every second every moment you
Every still of the night
Every wrong that was right
Every dream I denied
Every second every moment you
Every beat of my heart
Every day of my life
Every thought on my mind
Every second every moment you
Every tear that I cry
Every hope in my mind
Every fear that I hide
Every second every moment you

Every second every moment you
Every second every moment you
Every second every moment you

I'm hearin' footsteps
Outside my door I get up
A voice is hummin'
A tune it's soundin' like goodbye
I know I'll find you
No matter where you're hidin'
And so I wish for
A chance to find you

You
Every beat of my heart
Every day of my life
Every thought on my mind
Every second every moment you
Every still of the night
Every wrong that was right
Every dream I denied
Every second every moment you
Every beat of my heart
Every day of my life
Every thought on my mind
Every second every moment you
Every tear that I cry
Every hope in my mind
Every fear that I hide
Every second every moment you

Every second every moment you
Every second every moment you
Every second every moment you

You...

You
Every beat of my heart
Every day of my life
Every thought on my mind
Every second every moment you
Every still of the night
Every wrong that was right
Every dream I denied
Every second every moment you
Every beat of my heart
Every day of my life
Every thought on my mind
Every second every moment you
Every tear that I cry
Every hope in my mind
Every fear that I hide
Every second every moment you

Every second every moment you
Every second every moment you
Every second every moment you

You
