[Verse 1]
I am afraid of you now
Now that you left me
Nothing to say
Not much now
Now that you left me

[Chorus 1]
Now that you left me
Now that you left me

[Verse 2]
Just for how long did you know
Before you left me?
Nothing to do
It's up to you
To use it against me

[Chorus 2]
Use it against me
Now that you left me

[Verse 3]
You are ahead of me now
Because you left me
Words that I said
All yours now
Use it against me

[Chorus 3]
You have erased me
Now that you left me

[Outro]
I'll be gone, I'll be gone
I'll be gone, I'll be gone
I'll be gone, I'll be gone
I'll be gone, I'll be gone
