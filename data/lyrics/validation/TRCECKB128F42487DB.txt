Tipitina tra la la la
Tipitina tra la la la
Tipitina, oola malla walla dalla*
Won't you tra la, 'tina

Hey Roberta, oh Roberta!
Can you hear me callin' you
You are three times seven, baby
And you know what you want to do

Hey now boy, we're going down on the cow-wa
We're sure gone have a good time
We gonna tralla hoola malla walla
With a belly full of wine

* Means "little mama wants a dollar."
