[Verse 1]
White bird in a golden cage
On a winter's day, in the rain
White bird in a golden cage
Alone

The leaves blow across the long black road
To the darkened sky, in its rage
But the white bird just sits in her cage
Unknown

White bird must fly, or she will die

White bird dreams of the aspen trees
With their dying leaves turning gold
But the white bird just sits in her cage
Growing old

White bird must fly, or she will die [x2]

The sunsets come, the sunsets go
The clouds roll by, the Earth turns slow
The young bird's eyes do always glow

She must fly [x3]

[Verse 1]

White bird must fly, or she will die [x3]
White bird must fly
