I kick you like a dog that never gets fed
Kick you like a dog that never gets fed
I trust you with my words like you're my friend

I've got so much
Stowed away down there
I've got so much
Stowed away down there

You were all for what I had like it's worth something
All for what I had like it's worth something
You lean into me 'cause you know that you can

Keys out, lights on
No one waiting
Keys out, lights on
No one waiting

Now I give you my lies, all smudged with ink
Give you my lies all smuged with ink
You see right through because I am nothing

No more questions
I surrender
No more questions
I surrender
