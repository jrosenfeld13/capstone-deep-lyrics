You cheated me and made me lonely
I tried to be your very own
There'll be a day you'll want me only
But when I leave, I'll be a long time gone
Be a long time gone
Be a long time gone
Yes, when I leave, I'll be a long time gone

You're gonna be sad, you're gonna be weepin'
You're gonna be blue and all alone
You'll regret the day you seen me leavin'
'Cause when I leave, I'll be a long time gone
Be a long time gone
Be a long time gone
Yes, when I leave, I'll be a long time gone

You'll see my face through tears and sorrow
You'll miss the love you called your own
Baby, there'll be no tomorrow
'Cause when I leave, I'll be a long time gone
Be a long time gone
Be a long time gone
Yes, when I leave, I'll be a long time gone
