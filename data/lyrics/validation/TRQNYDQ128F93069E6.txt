Faraway voice
We can hear you whoo voice
What's it like to be heard
But from you not a word
Are you over those hills
Do you still hum the old melodies
Do you wish people listened
Over here with me

Faraway voice
What I would give
What I would give to hear that voice
What's it like to breath
My ears deceive me voice

And I will walk with you on a summer's day
And I will talk to you
Though you're faraway
And we'll sing through the years
Are you over those hills
Do you still hum the old melodies
Do you wish people listened
Over here with me
