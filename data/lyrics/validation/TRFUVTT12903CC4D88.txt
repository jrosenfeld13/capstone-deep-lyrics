Well I'm a east coast walkin'
Travelin', a talkin'
With a priority message today
Don't let your blind faith
Leave ya
Tomorrow may need ya
Just come on won't ya
Sing it with me

Chorus

Oh, can you feel the power
Within your soul
Ya got it
Got it, got
Can ya feel the power, yeah
Can you feel the power
Within your soul

Chorus

Love is God
God is love
Love is God

Well I'm a east coast, west coast
It don't matter to me
We've been to both sides
And everything in between
Oklahoma City born
With many places to go
We got a lotta things to say
So many seeds to sow

Chorus

Come on and say I
Say I know
Say I know
We can work it out

Say we
Say we know
Say we know
You can work it out

Our love is starin'a revolution
My love is startin' a revolution
Your love is startin' a revolution
Out love is startin' a revolution

Our love is startin' a revolution
Our love is startin' a revolution
Ah you got, got
To live
Our love is startin' a revolution
Your love is startin' a revolution
Out love is startin' a revolution
Our love is startin' a revolution

Got it
Can you feel the power now
Can you feel the power
Within your soul

Love is God
God is love
Love is God
God is love

Chorus
