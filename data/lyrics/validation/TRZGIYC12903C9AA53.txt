Hey, Back to back, ha ha ha ha, hey, belly to belly
Yes my friends
Hey, Back to back, ha ha ha ha, hey, belly to belly

It was a zombie jamboree
Took place in the New York cemetery
Oh, it was a zombie jamboree
Took place in the New York cemetery

Zombies from all parts of the island
Some of them are great Calypsonians
Since the season was carnival
They got together in bacchanal
And they were singing

Back to back, ghoul, belly to belly
Well, I don't give a damn 'cause I'm stone dead already
Back to back, oh oh oh, belly to belly
It's a zombie jamboree

One female zombie she wouldn't behave
See how's she's dancing out of the grave
In one hand she's holding a quart of rum
The other hand is knocking a conga drum

You know the lead singer starts to make his rhyme
While the other zombie is rockin' in time
One bystander, he had this to say
"It was a trip to see the zombies break away"
Shah! And they were singing

Back to back, mon, belly to belly
Well, I don't give a damn 'cause I'm stone dead already
Back to back, oh, belly to belly
It's a zombie jamboree

And they were singing
Back to back, mon, belly to belly
Well, I don't give a damn 'cause I'm stone dead already
Oh, back to back, oh oh oh, belly to belly
It's a zombie jamboree

Hey hey, back to back, everyone we sing, back to back
And belly to belly then back to back
One two three four

Hey, what a zombie jamboree
From Times Square to the Statue of Liberty
Uptown, downtown zombie jamboree
Whoa whoa whoa, yeah yeah

There's a high-wire zombie 'tween the World Trades
A King Kong zombie on the Empire State
But the biggest zombies Tokyo to Rome
The zombies who call the city home

Hah, what they do, huh

Back to back, ghoul, belly to belly
Well, I don't give a damn 'cause I'm stone dead already
Back to back, oh oh oh, belly to belly
It's a zombie jamboree

And they were singing
Back to back, mon, belly to belly
But I don't give a damn 'cause I'm stone dead already
Back to back, ha ha, belly to belly
It's a zombie jamboree

I need the chorus
Back to back, ghoul, belly to belly
Well, I don't give a damn 'cause I'm stone dead already, yeah
Back to back, mon, belly to belly
It's a zombie jamboree

Back to back, hey
Back to back, mon, belly to belly
Well, I don't give a damn 'cause I'm stone dead already
Back to back, ha, belly to belly
It's a zombie jamboree

Sing the chorus
Back to back, whoah, belly to belly
Well, I don't give a damn 'cause I'm stone dead already
Back to back, ha ha, belly to belly
It's a zombie jamboree

Do the limbo
Back to back to back to back to belly
I don't give a damn 'cause I'm stone dead already
Back to back, mon, belly to belly
It's a zombie jamboree

One more time, yeah
Back to back, belly to belly
Well, I don't give a damn 'cause I'm stone dead already, yeah
Back to back, mon, belly to belly
It's a zombie jamboree
