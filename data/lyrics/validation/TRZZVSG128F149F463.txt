If ever -- you want to lie down and talk things over with me
Just come knocking my front door
If ever, pretty little quim-quaker baby
You want to lie down and munch a bit on my pearly, pink, petulent, pullulating, prostatially barfing, semen canal

Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knocking
At my front door

Rapunzel -- let down your fair gold hair
To touch my body that's moanin' and groanin' on the ground
Fair locks on your pretty, pretty, pretty breasts
Makes my inner frame lights to light up like lanterns hanging in the sea
Oh baby, roll over

Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock,knock, knock, knock, knock, knocking
At my front door

Orient flower -- If ever you want a pink color
Tenderly, tenderly termulate [?] you
To pollinate your pretty cotillions

Hey, little pants down baby
You don't have to call or write or leave messages in the taxi-cabs of absolute reality

Oh, ...less and timeless ...less ... [?]
Oh, I fall down upon the ... [?]

Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock,knock, knock, knock, knock, knocking
At my front door

Oh, tongue me my darling of the universe
Without you I'm doing deep knee bends in the void
Then you're fucking in the ... [?]
Without you I'm standing in the cemetery wall
I feel like a mahogany banana turning into shop class lazy [?]
Don't make me spin my luck for the cheerleaders Saturday night at the football field
Don't make me ... [?]
Uh, oh
Uh, uh, oh
