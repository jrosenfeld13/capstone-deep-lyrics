[Intro: O.N.E.]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
O.N.E., New Boyz
No more

[Verse 1: Ben J]
So what you sayin' is my ego's to big to admit that I messed up?
Man why you always trippin'?
Fuck it, I messed up, I'm sorry, not simpin'
Nah scratch that I meant it
I'm tired of this lyin', this cheatin', cryin', the difference
What you tryna make? And I can't be mad at that
I was blind to the fact that you always had my back
And I noticed that after I saw you cryin'
The old me is dead now have a moment of silence

[Chorus: O.N.E.]
We fuss, we fight, we cry
And I ain't trynna hurt you no more
We fight, we cry
And I ain't trynna hurt you no more
And I ain't trynna hurt you no more
And I ain't trynna hurt you no more
And I ain't trynna hurt you no more
Girl I ain't trynna hurt you no more

[Verse 2: Legacy]
It kinda sorta somewhat seem like every single night
Your an inch closer to leavin' after every single fight
I keep screamin' what I'm thinkin' without ever thinkin' twice
'Bout the reason why I argue when I barely think I'm right
She always mentionin' how she so sick of my inconsiderence
Like christmas when I ditched her then I kicked it with a different chick
I pictured if this situation switched I'd loose it
Apologizes is to repetitive I'ma just prove it

[Chorus: O.N.E.]
We fuss, we fight, we cry
And I ain't trynna hurt you no more
We fight, we cry
And I ain't trynna hurt you no more
And I ain't trynna hurt you no more
And I ain't trynna hurt you no more
And I ain't trynna hurt you no more
Girl I ain't trynna hurt you no more

[Verse 3: O.N.E.]
I ain't trynna hurt ya
I just wanna love you girl
You get bad sometimes but you still my baby
Why you wanna walk out the door and give up everything that we've been fightin' for
Whoa! See I promise this time I'ma change girl
No more lies, no more cheatin', no more games girl
I'm just trynna be the one for you
And I'm doin' it all for you
Give me one more chance
Let me be the man
I could be the one you need
I don't know what I would do with out you girl I'm incomplete

[Chorus: O.N.E.]
We fuss, we fight, we cry
And I ain't trynna hurt you no more
We fight, we cry
And I ain't trynna hurt you no more
And I ain't trynna hurt you no more
And I ain't trynna hurt you no more
And I ain't trynna hurt you no more
Girl I ain't trynna hurt you no more
