I have an eye on your back, so
No need to run against me
Don't fight against me, you, you don't want me to be close anymore
Not anymore, you get around
So let me heal you, cure you, heal you

I will never need to wish to be part of me
What you call your future
No, see me interfere, watch me being your fear
You get bored, bored, I'm waiting for the last breath
I'm waiting for the last breath, for the last breath

I'm with you, you'd better learn to deal with me
Coming closer when refusing what I am
I'm with you
I'm with you, you'd better learn to deal with me
Coming closer when refusing what I am
I come along with you

See how long you can hold you breath now
Let me see, determine wrong from right - you're forced
Into a shaking world - you're plunged

See me interfere, watch me being your fear, feel me interfere

I'm with you, you'd better learn to deal with me
Coming closer when refusing what I am
I'm with you
I'm with you, you'd better learn to deal with me
Coming closer when refusing what I am
I come along with you

Before your heart stand still, and leaves you breathless
Leave your fears away
Before your heart stand still
Leave your fears away, away

Fear will touch you anyway
Before you're connected, in touch, before becoming one of them
Remember you were about to cut the links
As you were about to get out, you suddenly asked for more

I, I have an eye on your back, so
No need to run against me, don't fight against me, you
You don't want me to be close anymore
Not anymore, you get bored, before becoming one of them
Remember you weer about to cut the links
Before you're connected, before becoming one of those that failed

I'm with you, you'd better learn to deal with me
Coming closer when refusing what I am
I'm with you
I'm with you, you'd better learn to deal with me
Coming closer when refusing what I am
I come along with you

Before your heart stand still
And leaves you breathless
Leave your fears away
Before your heart stand still, leave your fears away
Before your heart stand still
Leave your fears away, before your heart stand still
Leave your fears away
