(dada da da...)

Color my eyes with the blue of the sky
Come on in unwrap the world [of all of this]

Tear the ways we've to melt the harmony
Come on in and wake me on broad day i will miss

And could you just hold that thought
And forcefully remove yourself
And will you just take it on more
[*** in the] wills of our souls who cannot stay

Dada da da...

And could you just hold that thought
(and for us believe remove yourself)
(and for us believe remove yourself)

And will you just take it on more
[*** in the] wills of our souls who cannot stay

Trace one of the lights that lie before you
A steady hand [that ***]

[watch the dead shine] and smiling on you
Inspiration only hides behind the dust

And could you just...

Dada da da...

(and for us believe remove yourself)
(color my eyes with the blue of the sky)

(dada da da...)

Dada da da...
