Nocturnal demon of hate
Searching for his next prey
Predator with no remorse
Cannibalistic killing machine

Attacking with demise, something to realize
Stripped of your life, you'll see, that it's too late
To save your fate, trembling of what's to come
He'll testify, then crucify, as you die in vain

Eyes torn from their sockets
Talons piercing the flesh
Epidermic layers torn from my chest
Fear logged in your larynx
Screams of torment trapped inside
As you are left, left to die

Bodies lie on the ground
Victims of his killing spree

Left here to die, to signify his wrath of abolishment
Corpses that lie, intensify the way that you die
Rotting flesh prevails, blood begins to hail from the sky above
Masses of remains left here to lay before his alter
