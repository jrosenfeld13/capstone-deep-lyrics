I like your hair much better that way
When it hangs out front, it hangs out front
With tilted head like a listener
I'm just thinking about the red dress
I like the red dress

I'm on my way, I'm on my way, I'm on my way
From coast to coast, I'm chilly, most I'm chill
I never knew the way to Pasadena
But now I know, and now I know and I am grateful

You say you'll burn this city down
With stars and stripes, I've got the stars and stripes
And ask if I'll move out west with you
But I'm still thinking about the red dress
I like the red dress

I like the red dress
I like the red dress
I like the red dress
I like the red dress

I'm on my way, I'm on my way, I'm on my way
From coast to coast, I'm chilly, most I'm chill
I never knew the way to Pasadena
But now I know, and now I know and I am grateful

Coast to coast and in too deep
Saving our secret for the weekends
Which I can't remember
Motel walls and in disguise
Telephone calls with no reply
With drink, I see things better

I'll see you around
We'll bring the house down
We'll bring the house down

I like the red dress
I like the red dress
I like the red dress
I like the red dress
