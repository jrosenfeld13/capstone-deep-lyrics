[Verse 1]
I'm sitting here on my own
Haven't seen you in a long, long time
This waiting's getting old
As I sit here I sing to myself
A little tune that helps (sometimes)
To pass the time
And this is how it goes
This is how it goes
This is how it goes

[Chorus]
Ooh waa ooh waa ooh hoo hoo
Ooh waa ooh waa ooh
Ooh waa ooh waa ooh hoo hoo (x3)

[Verse 2]
Still sitting here on my own
Music's running through my head
Changes all the time
Just remember sing between the lines
That little tune that helps the quiet moments
To pass the time
And this is how it goes
This is how it goes

[Outro (Chorus)]
Ooh waa ooh waa ooh hoo hoo
Ooh waa ooh waa ooh
Ooh waa ooh waa ooh hoo hoo (x3)
