Good Thing
Julio's Rainbow
(Trnqvist/Esbjrn Svensson)
Oh yes it rains and yet the sun shines through
And there's a rainbow sparkling next to you
You turn your head and you try to see it
But you don't see what I do
I see the ladies watching where they tread
Holding umbrellas high above their heads
In slowmotion I saw you were smiling
Was it something I said?
In another time we might just watch the boaters passing
I'd keep you in the corner of my eye
In another place we might be laughing
And I'd know how to try
We better leave I'll just finish my coffee
And now the sun is gone, it simply pours
There's no rainbow, there is no excuse to hold on anymore
In another time we might just watch the boaters passing
I'd keep you in the corner of my eye
In another place we might be laughing
And I'd know how to try
So there it is, and though I really want
You to remain in sight, I look away
Just to see if somewhere there is a sunbeam
If there is a sunbeam, a rainbow is coming our way
