I wanna be the American dream
But I need you right next to me
If I'm ever gonna feel free

Will you stay awake all night with me?
We can fall asleep tomorrow
Will you hang on to every word I speak
From now on?

Because I wanna be the American dream
But I need you right next to me
If I'm ever gonna feel free

You know when you're good
And you know when you're not
And right now baby
I am near the top
You won't be seeing much of me
This coming year
But I'll check back up on you
If you wait here

But every time you leave me
I swear to god it gets much worse
When I lean in you'll say goodbye
I bet I'll choke on my damn words
As if they're ever really worth singing

I wanna be the American dream
But I need you right next to me
If I'm ever gonna feel free

I wanna be the American dream (woah oh oh)
But I need you right next to me (woah oh oh)
If I'm ever gonna feel free (woah oh oh)

Oh, I'm never gonna be free
