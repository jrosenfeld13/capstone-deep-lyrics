When you say you'll call, I really know you won't
I'm really getting tired of waiting by the phone
You didn't even show up when I put you on the list
I could've sold your ticket, and it makes me really pissed

You're all talk
You're all talk
Everybody knows you're all talk
You're all talk
You're all talk
Everybody knows you're all talk

I don't wanna have to make excuses for you
Because you didn't do the things you said you'd do
You really have a problem. I think you need a shrink
'Cause when you blow me off, I think it really fucking stinks

You're all talk
You're all talk
Everybody knows you're all talk
You're all talk
You're all talk
Everybody knows you're all talk

I hope you don't expect for me to wait around for you
Because of how bust you got, and I've got better things to do

Last night you said you'd call, but you blew me off again
How do you expect to have me still as a friend?
I don't wanna hear those stupid lies you tell
As far as I'm concerned, baby, you can go to hell

You're all talk
You're all talk
Everybody knows you're all talk
You're all talk
You're all talk
Everybody knows you're all talk

You're all talk
You're all talk
Everybody knows you're all talk
You're all talk
You're all talk
Everybody knows you're all talk
