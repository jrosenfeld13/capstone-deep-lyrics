Bottoms up to people sit you down
Enjoy your living with the people sit you down
Singing bottoms up to people sit you down
Enjoy your living with the people sit you down

Take your mind off all your heartaches
And you'll find they're good as gone
Now the ball is on the uptake
Join the world and be as one

Bottoms up to people sit you down...

Tho' your mind is in the dog house
'Cos your wife has thrown you out
Don't be acting like a bog mouse
Take your lead off
Move about

Bottoms up to people sit you down...

Take your mind off all your heartaches
And you'll find they're good as gone
Now the ball is on the uptake
Join the world and be as one

Bottoms up to people sit you down...
