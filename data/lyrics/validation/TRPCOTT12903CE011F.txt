Last time you're coming my way
Trains always run by the right side
Last chance or you set your feet down
This time it's a matter of homebound

You can make me walk for miles
And I can make you dance for days
We'll end up exhausted, end up exhausted
Hang on hang on hang on hang on
This living kills

It sticks upon your face
This daily need for a hot time
This time I pushed you too far
And now I feel like a nude mime

You can make me walk for miles
And I can make you dance for days
We'll end up exhausted, end up exhausted
Hang on hang on hang on hang on
This living kills

You can make me walk for miles
And I can make you dance for days
But now my legs are tired
And your feet don't want to swing
Only barely in motion with the music sounding
This living kills
