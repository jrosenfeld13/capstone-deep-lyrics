[Verse 1]
Here come broken bones!
Where's your sticks and stones?
(What'd you use to hurt me?)
Something you should know!
Cannot take no more!
Time to settle scores!
Feel the rage and fury!
(Blood I'll make it pour!)

[Pre-Chorus]
Hypocrisy from jealousy
Hypocrisy from jealousy

[Chorus]
Lies you spit are harmless to me!
Your spite! Your greed! Your envy!
Why do you stoop so low?
Am I the last to know?
Lies you spit are harmless to me!
Your spite! Your greed! Your envy!
Why do you stoop so low?
Am I the last to know?

[Verse 2]
Where's your big mouth now?
Hope you're fucking proud!
(Do you like your bruises?)
Now you make no sound!
Was your lesson learned?
How the tables turn!
(What were your intentions?)
To hell with you! Now burn!

[Pre-Chorus]
Hypocrisy from jealousy
Hypocrisy from jealousy

[Chorus]
Lies you spit are harmless to me!
Your spite! Your greed! Your envy!
Why do you stoop so low?
Am I the last to know?
Lies you spit are harmless to me!
Your spite! Your greed! Your envy!
Why do you stoop so low?
Am I the last to know?

[Bridge]
Am I the last to know?
Am I the last to know?

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Hypocrisy from jealousy
Hypocrisy from jealousy

[Chorus]
Lies you spit are harmless to me!
Your spite! Your greed! Your envy!
Why do you stoop so low?
Am I the last to know?
Lies you spit are harmless to me!
Your spite! Your greed! Your envy!
Why do you stoop so low?
Am I the last to know?
