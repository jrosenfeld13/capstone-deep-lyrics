I thought about what you said
And I'm not sorry for a thing
You do not understand this
Or what it means to me
Cannot discard this as emotion
This is more than another passing stage
You'll have to prove it's just opinion
In defense of everything, this is my everything
Could it be that you have stumbled?
Tripped and fallen over something more than faith?

Could you prove yourself?
This is a matter of life and death
Would you step up to the line?
But please don't just talk this time
What would you ask of me?
What would you ask of me?
It's time to step up to the line
Action begs reaction

What is left to be said?
Anything less has all been done before
To put to rest what you've been wondering
If you could take my life
Would you still ask for more?

I thought about what you said
Something occurred to me
You wouldn't ask me to turn my back on anything
If you believed that I believe
Truth is I would love to show you
Take "faith and works" to another, higher stage
So there is little time for words you've heard
Life and death are only steps
I'm not afraid of what comes next
What is enough, in your opinion?
Perhaps my death would bring some substance to my claims

Could you prove yourself?
This is a matter of life and death
Would you step up to the line?
But please don't just talk this time
What would you ask of me?
What would you ask of me?
It's time to step up to the line
Action begs reaction

What is left to be said?
Anything less has all been done before
To put to rest what you've been wondering
If you could take my life
Would you still ask for more?

Vanity of vanities, this
Life, love, art, and sex
Each breath you breathe is
Grasping at the wind

He is my everything

We cannot both be right
About right and wrong
And God and man
Right and wrong and God and man

I want what you ask of me this time
Please step up to the line
He's my everything
Action begs reaction

What is left to be said?
Anything less has all been done before
So put to rest your wondering
If you could take my life
You'd still ask for more
