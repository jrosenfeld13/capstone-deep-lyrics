They say the city is so mean
And the suburbs
So very clean
We're dodging bullets
In the streets
Or blocking brain
Washing techniques

I'm back on track
Thought I was a goner
But it wasn't meant to be
I'm right on target (prelude to riot)
Now there's no stoppin' me

They might shoot you
Full of holes
But sometimes they
Want your soul
Suburban commandos
Full of ammo
Down in flames
Too hot to handle

I'm back on track
Thought I was a goner
But it wasn't meant to be
I'm right on target (prelude to riot)
Now there's no stoppin' me

Up against the wall mother-fucker
It's social punks out
On parade
Wait till tomorrow
And see who's still
Left standing
It high society's
Low-life's full of rage

I'm back on track
Thought I was a goner
But it wasn't meant to be
I'm right on target (prelude to riot)
Now there's no stoppin' me
