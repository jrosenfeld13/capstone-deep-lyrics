[Intro]
Notnice again
One ya get 10 out of 10
Some boy gwan like dem a friend...
Man done know a hypocrite dem
But, Notnice
Badmind everything inna dem
Be careful of who you call friend
'Cause some of dem a link, Bigga Ford, dem a mock shield friend
Watch what you talk 'round dem

[Chorus]
Some of dem a informer
How you do it?
Everything you see you waan fi speak
When you come pon the corner, anything you hear we speak...
No bring it and go chat it when you leave
Mi say, dutty informer

Everything you see you waan fi speak
When you come pon the corner, anything you hear we speak...
No bring it and go chat it when you leave

Then Notnice, man a juggle fi mi dream
Spend a couple dollar bagga Hustle fi the cream
