Oh wishing well
Don't you find that life is but a blur now?
Goodbye good times
Good times are gone
If I wait around a day or so
I'll catch a glimpse and let it go
Nevermind the good good times
Cause I'm out of dimes
I gave the gold to so and so
Cause I just wanna take
Just take it slow
Oh wishing well
Don't you find that life is but a blur now?
Whoa oh, so long ago
I took a road that led right to
A dream that wasn't true
And now I wish to be you
Hello heartache
Heartache is here
Most of me was left behind
And everyday was right on time
Never got to play my solo
Yeah, Counting Crows are on the radio
But no one ever heard from Mr. Jones
Yeah, Oh wishing well
Don't you find that life is but a blur now?
So long ago
I took the road that led right to
A dream that wasn't true
And now I wish to be you
Oh, to be you
Did you forget me again?
Why are you so mean?
I'm just trying to buy a dream
So I take a trip to the wishing well
To throw away another heart
Or maybe I'll just jump right in
To where the wishes dwell
And put 'em away in my pocket
They arn't going nowhere
They arn't going nowhere
They arn't going anywhere
Oh wishing well
Don't you find that life is but a blur now?
So long ago
I took the road that led right to
A dream that wasn't true
But I never know what tomorrow holds
Do you?
Maybe wishes still come true
Yeah, maybe wishes still come true
