You know, I try so hard but I think you don't see me

Because I'm moving so fast, we call it rock 'n' rollin'
My weapon seems useless cause you're on to me
You are impossible to read, you're always straight controllin'

Oh, oh, oh Miss Alissa
Oh, oh, oh Miss Alissa
Oh, oh, oh Miss Alissa
Gonna do a voodoo dance until you feel my power now

You know I feel so smooth, I'm always struttin' when in motion
Make the little girls dance cause I'm rock 'n' rollin'
It really doesn't matter that you're hard to please
Cause when you give me your smile, I'm yours for straight controllin'

Oh, oh, oh Miss Alissa
Oh, oh, oh Miss Alissa
Oh, oh, oh Miss Alissa
Gonna do a voodoo dance until you feel my power now

You know, I try so hard but I think you don't see
Because I'm moving so fast, we call it rock 'n' rollin'
My weapon seems useless cause you're on to me
You are impossible to read, you're always straight controllin'

Oh, oh, oh Miss Alissa
Oh, oh, oh Miss Alissa
Oh, oh, oh Miss Alissa
Gonna do a voodoo dance until you feel my power now

Oh, oh, oh Miss Alissa
Oh, oh, oh Miss Alissa
Oh, oh, oh Miss Alissa
Oh, oh, oh Miss Alissa
Oh, oh, oh Miss Alissa
Gonna do a voodoo dance until you feel my power now
You gonna feel my power
