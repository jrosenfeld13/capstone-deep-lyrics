Sundown Friday, twilight in the big town
Party people getting ready now
Somewhere baby I know you're waiting
Citys vibrating

The city's in a heatwave Praying for
A sunshade hoping that the evening
Will chill down the streets
And I'm a little hot too cause
I can only think of you
Hoping that tonight you'll Find out what I like

Refrain:
Sundown Friday, twilight in the big town
Party people getting ready now (ready now)
Somewhere baby I know you're waiting
Citys vibrating Sundow air gets cooler but my heart
Pounds loud and fast I'm getting ready now (I
Gettin'ready)
Somewhere baby I know you're waiting city's vibrating

I don't know if you've seen me, Don't know if you are
Dreaming hoping for someone who can show you who You
Are
Tonight I' gonna find you fly on a breeze and Blind you
Take you from clubland and send us to the stars

Refrain:
Sundown Friday,twilight in the big town (big towns)
Party people getting ready now ( gettin' ready know)
Somewhere baby I know you're waiting
Citys vibrating Sundow air gets cooler but my heart
Pounds loud and fast I'm getting ready now (ready know)
Somewhere baby I know you're waiting city's vibrating

Sundown Friday, twilight in the big town (big town)
Party people getting ready now (you ready know)

Citys vibrating Sundow air gets cooler but my heart
Pounds loud and fast I'm getting ready now (they
