Stay away from me
Cause I can't help you
Don't make me stay
To watch you turn blue
So many things
That you have said
We might have thought
You could have been dead
I can see you look to me
Tell me what the hell you think I'm supposed to be

Playground, don't want to let it bring you down
Playground, don't want to let it bring you down

Numbered days I see
You need to get through
If we thought differently
Then I could help you

Now you're on the floor
And I can't help you
Hope you got some more
A living statue

Playground don't want to let it bring you down
Playground, don't want to let it bring you down
