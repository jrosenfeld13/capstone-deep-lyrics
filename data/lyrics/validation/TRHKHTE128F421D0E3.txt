You never told me 'bout the belle and ball
We built the tree-house and forgot what it was
It left me feeling numb
And all the stories that you painted for me
Blue crayon dreams that no one ever would see
They vanished in the wind

And you would put it away
The glass, away to stay

Won't you strip / I can't / oh / breath your / to / day / stay
Reflections were untold
Of your lip / I can't / oh / breath / to / you / lay / say
Reflections were untold and to say
Reflections were untold
The magpie stole our gold
Won't you strip / I can't / oh / breath your / to / day / stay
Reflections were untold
Of your lip / I can't / oh / breath / to / you / lay / say
Reflections were untold and to say
Reflections were untold
Blue crayon dreams that no one ever would see

Death for us won't make me stay
Death won't make me to say
It's you

(Death for us won't make me stay)
And all the playmates you were keeping from me
(Death won't make me)
Ripped out the pages in your third diary (to say)
A hidden dream won't fly (It's you)

And you would put it away
The glass, away to stay

Won't you strip / I can't / oh / breath your / to / day / stay
Reflections were untold
Of your lip / I can't / oh / breath / to / you / lay / say
Reflections were untold and to say
Reflections were untold
The magpie stole our gold
Won't you strip / I can't / oh / breath your / to / day / stay
Reflections were untold
Of your lip / I can't / oh / breath / to / you / lay / say
Reflections were untold and to say
Reflections were untold
Blue crayon dreams that no one ever would see

Death for us won't make me stay
Death won't make me (to say) to say (to lay)
It's you

(Death for us won't make me stay)
You teached me how to practice hide and seek
I told you secrets that we promised to keep
(Death won't make me, to say, to say, to lay)
But it was not enough (It's you)

(Death for us won't make me stay)
The toy box then tried to reveal its truth
Did not hold anything but spottened youth
(Death won't make me, to say, to say, to lay)
My hate-machine could cry
