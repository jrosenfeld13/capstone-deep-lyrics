He was my younger son
Always on my mind
I never found the time

I'll go with the family tide
Always on the run
All that's said is done

My love is never gone
It won't go away
It's not time's to take

Every transition would field some heartache
There's no conclusion to your only born son

Oh, so how do I who've always known
Oh, next season we'd be on our own
Oh, I'm gettin' high without the hope
