Take a deep breath and prepare for a rainy day
Feel the cold wind blow as it carries you away
Every last word getting hard and harder to say
You and I always knew I'd never stay

Hey little girl i can't see the way your eyes are watching
My heart is breaking
Hey little girl nothing's gonna hurt me more than leaving

Let the rain fall let the wind blow out the flame
Gonna feel so small in the moonlight calling away
Crying my dreams though we'll never be the same
This chance may not ever go again

Ooohhh oohhhh

Take a deep breath and prepare for a rainy day
Feel the cold wind blow as it carries you away
Every last word getting hard and parting to say
You and I always knew I'd never stay
