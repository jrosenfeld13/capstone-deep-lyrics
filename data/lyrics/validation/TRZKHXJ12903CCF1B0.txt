There is a road that leads to Valhalla
Where only the chosen are allowed
There is a boy with the dream of Valhalla
A place in the land of the gods
Cause in their home where the fire burns forever
The life goes on for those who tell in battle
The gods will wake him the moment he falls in the fight
Cause he'll rise when the sun goes down

He raised high his sword
As he cried out Valhalla
His dream has become reality
Tonight he will ride on the road to Valhalla
Chosen to feast with the gods

Cause in their home where the fire burns forever
The life goes on for the mighty young (viking)
The journey has finally come to and end for the boy
He has risen as the bravest of them all

Valhalla oh I hail you
You mighty home upon this lake
Valhalla oh you came true
(and I'll now) forever reign
