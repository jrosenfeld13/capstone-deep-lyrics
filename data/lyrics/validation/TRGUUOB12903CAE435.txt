On the last naked day of winter
On the eve of a fateful thaw
I was imprisoned in frozen pieces
Of heart-broken laws
Then down fell an angel renegade
Her halo read "Morning Star"
Wounded by the doom of a comet tail
She was sealed with a scar
Then a sweet lightning struck
And the earth opened us
Like spring buds
Why she ever fled heaven
And why I would hibernate
Answers why we would meet here
To equal our altered states
Then a sweet lightning struck
And the earth opened us
Like spring buds
With a sacred heart-shared rhythm
We blossom through the spring
Star of the Morning shines now
On her own two wings
Then a sweet lightning struck
And the earth opened us
Like spring buds
