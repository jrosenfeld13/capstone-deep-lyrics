It's crazy but I'm frightened by the sound of the telephone, oh yeah
I'm worried that the caller might have awful news, oh my
Who knows these days where on earth the money goes, oh yeah
No doubt we could put it to a better use, oh my

You keep insisting that nobody showed you how to keep relationships, oh yeah
Your daddy made a real good try, oh my
You said you knew all along we could work it out, oh yeah
Do you have to make a fuss everytime we fly

Ooh I'm looking for clues

I'll have to make an effort now just to be serious, oh yeah
Nobody's gonna give you the benefit of the doubt, oh my
Everytime I pick a paper up it's harder to believe the news, oh yeah
I'm gonna have to shake it up and twist and shout, oh my

You can't do nothing that you don't put your mind to, oh yeah
I suspected all along you were a dream come true, oh my
I'm never in the dark 'cause my heart keeps me well informed, oh yeah
I'm convinced that there's a way of getting through to you

Ooh I'm looking for clues

It's crazy but I'm frightened by the sound of relationships, oh yeah
I swear we could put it to a better use, oh my
Do hurry baby you've forgotten how to catch a night groove, oh yeah
You told all the callers you were not amused

Ooh I'm looking for clues

You keep insisting that nobody showed you how to use a telephone, oh yeah
Nobody's gonna give you a second chance, oh my
I don't have to make an effort now to find out where the money goes, oh yeah
Do you have to make a fuss everytime we dance

Ooh I'm looking for clues
Do ya do ya do ya do ya
Ooh I'm looking for clues
Ooh I'm looking for clues
Ooh I'm looking for clues
