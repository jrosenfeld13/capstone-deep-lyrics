(Off shore) Either sink or swim
(I saw) What kind of boat I'm in
(Much more) Although I can't forget you
The light is growing dim

Feet are falling on foreign ground
Luck in short supply
I feel like Crusoe before him found
All gone pass me by
I walk on beach, I sleep on sand, I walk in water
Salty sea got a hold on me
Daylight come, be it now or never

Lost on some horizon
No man is an island
(No man is an island)
(No man is an island)

(Jackdaw) He don't bother me
(Wild boar) He keep me company
(Panther) My only consolation
In my calamity

Lady Luck or Lady Death must pass this shore some day
I hope she's coming, I ain't seen her yet
Come to take my soul away
Light my fire on the top of hill
So all the ships can see that I'm a prisoner here
And come before I disappear

Lost on some horizon
No man is an island
Banished here to prolong my silence
No man is an island
(No man is an island)
(No man is an island)
(No man is an island)
(No man is an island)

(INSTRUMENTAL MIDDLE BREAK)

(No man is an island)
(No man is an island)
(No man is an island)
(No man is an island)
(No man is an island)
(No man is an island)
(No man is an island)
