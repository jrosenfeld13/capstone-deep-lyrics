"He went to hell
Everybody ends up dead
It's just a matter of when"

Prevail!

Trapped in a web of lies
I'll never see the truth
When it stares me in the eyes
Damn, the ones who betray
Every single chance
That I give every day
Break, all the chains that bind
All these pains are lost in the cries
Break everything that will come
The chance to over come

Never seen the face of defeat
Never felt the cries of the weak
Never once thought of surrender
This heart is somber
I will rise 'till the end
Sever the souls that bled
I will be discourage
And turn it into rage

Prevail, the time has come
Crush the enemy, one by one
Prevail, like a venomous snake
Ready to strike and dominate
Prevail, we conquer as one
Pound the enemy, 'till it's done
Prevail!

What doesn't kill you
Makes you stronger
And bitter
What has to be
To get done quicker
And faster

I'll turn these tables around
And wait to break you down

(?)Embrace my wounded feel
This day we'll sign a deal

Trapped in a web of lies
I'll never see the truth
When it stares me in the eyes
Damn, the ones who betray
Every single chance
That I give every day
Break, all the chains that bind
All these pains are lost in the cries
Break everything that will come
The chance to over come

Never seen the face of defeat
Never felt the cries of the weak
Never once thought of surrender
This heart is somber
I will rise 'till the end
Sever the souls that bled
I will be discourage
And turn it into rage

Prevail, the time has come
Crush the enemy, one by one
Prevail, like a venomous snake
Ready to strike and dominate
Prevail, we conquer as one
Pound the enemy, 'till it's done
Prevail!

"I've waited all my life for this
The moment I break the silence
The moment I break the fucking silence
