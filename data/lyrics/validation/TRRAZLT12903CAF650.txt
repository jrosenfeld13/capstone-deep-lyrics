Why, why you?
Some children playing on a sweetful day
It took me back to an innocent place
Always felt children running round me

Life interrupted crying eyes I can't see
All I ever wanted was to share my day
At least until the sun went down
And led to a different place

Girl I never had a clue that you'd taken away
No one to count girl life with
You ain't here no more, I still can't believe it's true
Girl, I will never stop loving you
(Loving you)

No other woman can replace the feelings I feel for you
Girl, I will never stop loving you, loving you
It makes me want to take a break and walk away from life
Girl, I will never stop loving you
(Loving you)

It's been so hard not to think about us
Just holding hands is like deep cut
