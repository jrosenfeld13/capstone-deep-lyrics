Hey hey my friend
You're upside down again
My my your hair's a mess
Now it's anybody's guess
Funny how life can be a desperation
You don't have to go for that
Hey hey my friend
Whose hands are on the wheel
Are they taking you for a ride
Or are you just too numb to feel
The knives in your back
The thorn in your side
You don't have to go for that

There's a school of thought
There's a bull in a china shop
There's a bird in a cage
There's a penny that wants to drop
Is this what you want?
Hey hey my friend guess
I'll be seeing you round now
When it happens again
When you feel it drag you down
You don't have to swallow it everytime
You don't have to go for that
