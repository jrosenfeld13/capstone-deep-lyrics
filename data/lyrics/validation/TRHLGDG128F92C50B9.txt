When Marilyn Monroe woke up in heave
She had everything she'd need
For the perfect day, the perfect man takes her walking
Where no-one can stare
She goes shopping and finds the
Perfect clothes to wear for the perfect sleep
But down here
We're dreaming of cures, and drinking well tonight
Forgetting all our sorrows
Put away or fights
Until tomorrow comes around
We sit in the pub waiting for the clubs to open
We will be safe tonight and not wake up next to strangers
Thinking I killed the one I loved
He's drinking slowly, he's got a hangover
And a smoked up chest that's
Too too too tight
I dream on...
Imagine what could happen after this drink I'm wearing wings
Join Lauren Bacall float up to heaven's gate
Wearing danger smiles. She'll meet with the stars
They'll break down doors
Those shining pearls float off in space
I'm raving beautifully
When Marilyn Monroe woke up in heaven
She had everything I'd need
When I go to heaven and stand shivering before this god
I'll try some complaining, "why that little tiny trick?"
Give me the pearls of love
Of wisdom and of smiles
Give me another chance
A beautiful set of wings in Heaven
When I wake up in heaven
