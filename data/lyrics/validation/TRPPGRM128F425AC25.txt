I'd like to feel like I am doing fine
Like to feel like I am doing fine
Oh no no...
I'd like to feel like I am doing fine
Like to feel like I am doing fine

More than two minutes after I come

Nothing to seek
Nothing to prove
Don't even need to goof
To keep up the party

Don't make me move
Don't pull away
Hang on by a fingernail
Or you will be deported

This is the best
This is the taste
Is it anything but a test
I keep thinking about it

Give it a rest
Forget the haste
It's a brilliant time to waste
And to stay undecided

I'd like to feel like I am doing fine
Like to feel like I am doing fine
Oh no no...
I'd like to feel like I am doing fine
Like to feel like I am doing fine

More than two minutes after I come

Time is a pest
Ready to doom
The equilibrium
Between the mind and the body

I feel my flesh
Turn into clay
Ignoring that far away
There is a new horizon

Losing the point
Dropping the ball
Tonight I 've seen it all
I am not excited

A bunker is built
Under the sheets
A habitat that I need
So safe inside it

Two minutes of peace
Don't make a day
My hair must be turning grey
From all that thinking about it

It is unwise to tip the scales
I know
And celibacy is just too hard on the soul
