[Chorus]
No fear, no shame
You don't have to worry 'bout a thang
(You don't worry, baby)
No fear, no shame
You don't have to worry 'bout a thang

[Verse 1: Cindy Herron]
Makes no difference
Near or far, baby
It's you I love no matter where you are
My dedication will never die
I'm always faithful 'til you break my heart
You don't have to keep seaching for dishonesty
It's always safer to let your love flow
I can guarantee
There's no need for doubting me
There is no other that's worth the trouble

[Chorus]
No fear, no shame
You don't have to worry 'bout a thang
(Oh, you don't worry, baby)
No fear, no shame
You don't have to worry 'bout a thang

[Verse 2: Cindy]
There's no reasoning for your dismay
Our love's been good up to this very day
No time for wondering
It takes away
From the time we have to share together
You can best believe
No one can just come between
Me and you and what we built together
I guess in time we'll see where our dedication leads
And in the end I know I'll be there for you

[Chorus]
No fear, no shame
You don't have to worry 'bout a thang
(You don't worry, baby)
No fear, no shame
You don't have to worry 'bout a thang

[Bridge]
(Don't you worry, don't you worry, worry...)
I can guarantee there's no need for doubting me
No time for wondering
You can count me

[Chorus]
No fear, no shame
You don't have to worry 'bout a thang
(I would never cheat on you)
No fear, no shame
You don't have to worry 'bout a thang
(You don't have to worry 'bout a thang)
No fear, no shame
You don't have to worry 'bout a thang
(I love you, baby)
No fear, no shame
You don't have to worry 'bout a thang
