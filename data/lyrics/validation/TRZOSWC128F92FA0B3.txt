It's been long long time in darkness
Oh baby, heaven turned to hell
I've cried a million tears
A million times in
Heartbreak hotel

And after all these years of loneliness
There must be a ray of light
A little melody that fills the silence
A dreamless lullaby

It goes
Ladida
It goes around the world, around the
Ladida
And everybody's singing like this
Ladida
A million miles away from home
Ladidadida
One more time it's ladida
It goes around the world, around the
Ladida
And everybody's singing like this
Ladida
A million miles away from home
Ladidadida

I've been waiting almost every day
For this melody
I've been waiting for a lifetime baby
Endlessly
I've been waiting waiting all my life for this
Magic melody
And if you hear me now from outer space babe
Come and sing with me

It goes
Ladida
It goes around the world, around the
Ladida
And everybody's singing like this
Ladida
A million miles away from home
Ladidadida
One more time it's ladida
It goes around the world, around the
Ladida
And everybody's singing like this
Ladida
A million miles away from home
Ladidadida
