I love you with a fever
I love you like a fire
Everything is burning
With the flames of my desire
Flames, love in flames
I'm in flames, love in flames

I love you like the movies
I love you like the TVlove you when you're classy
And I love you when you're sleazy
Flames, love in flames
I'm in flames, love in flames

Only the ash remains
Everything's up in flames

I want to be your camera
I want to be your dancer
I want to be your question
And I want to be your answer
Flames, love in flames
I'm in flames, love in flames

I want to be your mystic
I want to be your gypsy
I want to be your target
Anytime you want to hit me
Flames, love in flames
I'm in flames, love in flames

Only the ash remains
Everything's up in flames

And there's nothing in the world that can cure the fever
And there's nothing I can do to put out the fire
And there's nothing I can take that could take me higher
Cause you're my flame, you're my hot desire
You're my flame, you're my hot desire
You're my flame, you're my hot desire

Oh heartburn
Oh heartburn
Oh heartburn
Oh heartburn
Oh heartburn
