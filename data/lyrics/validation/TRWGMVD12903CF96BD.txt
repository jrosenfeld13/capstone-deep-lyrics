There's an aura around you
I'm captivated by your eyes
I can't believe that I've found you
Why am I so starry eyed?

I once lived with honor
Followed codes of chivalry
But I can't help but falter
Under the spell of Annowre

Oh- this love's not for real
The emotions I feel
Oh- stronger than tempered steel
Can't you see how I feel?

Where did you come from?
What's your name?
Is it all a game?
You ignite men's hearts aflame
To burn for you in vain

Like a magnet you draw me
Like a spider to the fly
An empty heart is so easy
To seduce and hypnotize

Oh- is this my destiny?
A lock without a key
No- this nightmare is no dream
Have I lost reality?

Where did I come from?
What's my name?
Nothing seems the same
You ignite my heart aflame
To burn for you in vain

And the ones who let their hearts rule their minds
Will burn their bridges when they've crossed
And leave the world behind...
Leave it all behind

No- this loves not for real
The emotions I feel
No- can I break this spell?
Only time will tell
