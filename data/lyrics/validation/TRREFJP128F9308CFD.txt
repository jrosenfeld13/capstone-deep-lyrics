The whole towns slippin down a hill
Like the spine of something dead
Slide in shadow cobble-creep
Burn your mark and leave

The trench conventions yellow eyes
Follow her the local flower
The girls a priest (to me at least)
Since baptism peroxide

And fear is not respect. Correct
But it's the best you're gonna get
Sharp blow to the bridge of the nose
Sharp blow and anything goes
