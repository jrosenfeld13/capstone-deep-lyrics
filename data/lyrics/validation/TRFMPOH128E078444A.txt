Has there ever come a time, when you fell real nice
And you want to let someone know that you really appreciate them?
All you have to do is moan a little bit for me
It goes something like this
Ooooh, ooooho, oooooh, oooooho
You see, no time for wasting, baby
We're gone all through those moves
I'm offering satisfaction, darling
Girl, I'm giving you all my love
Anytime is the right time, baby
Come on and, take my heart
It's all yours if you want it, baby
My heart is tearing all apart, I say
Ooooh (you can have it)
Yeah (if you want it)
Come and get it, baby
But if you want it (you can have it)
Come and get it, girl, yeah (if you want it), yeah
See darling - there's no time for wasting, baby
Come on please, make up your mind
Good loving is so pleasing, baby
Girl, I'm giving you all my time
You can have it if you want it
Just come and get it, and, baby, it's yours, yeah
I've got it to give and if you want it
I know that you're gonna love it, so come on, girl
Oh, I knew you'd like it
Oh baby, you got me saying something like
Oooooh, ooooho
One night while I was sleeping, baby
Had a dream of you and I
Found myself asking you, baby
Take my hand and be my wife
There's no time for wasting, baby
Cause we've gone all through these moves
Cause I'm offering satisfaction, darling
Girl, I'm giving you all my love
You can have it, yeah, if you want it
You can have it (baby, you really want my loving)
If you want it (it's all yours, baby)
You can have it any time of the day if you want it
Don't matter what place it is, baby, you can get it, baby
You can have it (come on, girl, and get it)
If you want it you can have it
(cause I will make you feel alright)
If you want it (can't you tell that)
You can have it (take my heart)
If you want it (come on, darling)
You can have it (take my heart)
If you want it (satisfaction guaranteed)
You can have it (take my heart)
If you want it you can have it (take my heart)
If you want it
