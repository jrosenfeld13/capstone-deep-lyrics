How Much Is That Hound Dog In The Winder
I do hope that fleabag's for sale
How Much Is That Hound Dog In The Winder
The one with the long mangy tail

I'll give you two-bits for that hound dog
The one with the sad achin' heart
Fer he looks so much like my girl friend
I can't hardly tell 'em apart


Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh

What kind of a dog is that
That is a hot-dog Homer
Boy you sure mustard that up

I must take a trip to Louisianer
Leave her and that hound dog alone
While I'm eatin' shrimp and jamboliar
They'll be home a-gnawin' a bone

I don't want a monkey or a baboon
I don't want a muley old cow
I don't want a crappie or a catfish
A catfish could never me-ow

How Much Is That Hound Dog In The Winder
With the basketball nose on his face
You know what a basketball nose is
It dribbles all over the place
