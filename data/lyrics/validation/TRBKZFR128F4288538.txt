[Chorus]
You've been wrong for so long
And I can't take the pain you bring me
No more
You've been wrong for so long
And I can't take the pain you bring me
No more

[Verse 1]
Friday night, it's 10:15
You're working late, am I naive
To believe that it's true
Finally I've realized
Your lies have opened up my eyes
This love affair, now it's over, over

[Chorus]
You've been wrong for so long
And I can't take the pain you bring me
No more
You've been wrong for so long
And I can't take the pain you bring me
No more

[Verse 2]
Here we go, over again
Ya got me hangin' on a limb
I recommend that you leave
What do I do
What do U say
When I love you
And you don't feel the same
Don't wanna play no more games
I don't wanna play it now

[Chorus]
You've been wrong for so long
And I can't take the pain you bring me
No more
You've been wrong for so long
And I can't take the pain you bring me
No more

[Bridge]
Baby, won't you
Stop, look, listen to my heart
It's crying for you
Stop, look, listen to my heart
It's falling for you
Stop, look, listen to my heart
It's calling for you
Stop, look, listen to my heart
It's finally over you

[Chorus]
You've been wrong for so long
And I can't take the pain you bring me
No more
You've been wrong for so long
And I can't take the pain you bring me
No more
