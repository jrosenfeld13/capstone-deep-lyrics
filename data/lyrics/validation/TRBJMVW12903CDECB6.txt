In a free land, we watch our victories
Killing our annoyances as the troops march away
We talk of no more, for there's a price to pay
In a free land, children starve and are beaten to death
We rape when we feel, and we take no shit
In decisive calm, mediated for viewing pleasure
We cherish revenge to the sound of war
This is not make believe
This is so fucking real
Dead mothers still there, dead brothers still there, dead children still there
Now do you believe?
In a course of annihilation, in a fervor of terror to take control of who we are
Death by design, a plan of war
This is not make believe, this is so fucking real
This is war
