Our love is a weapon of mass destruction
Destruction
Cut deep into my skin
It's the only way that you can get in from now on
From now on
Well, what don't you know?

Four years to the sea and i've seen you choking in my dreams
Too little, too late, too late to love
Well, what don't you know?

Our love is a weapon of mass
D-E-S-T-R-U-C-T-I-O-N
It's too late for me to forgive and forget
Now it's revenge!
[?]

Four years to the sea and I've seen you choking in my dreams
Too little, too late, too late to love
It's you, you, you, you, you, you, you!

Well, what don't you know?
Four years till one day, i've seen the truth in my dreams
It's too late to love, too late to love
