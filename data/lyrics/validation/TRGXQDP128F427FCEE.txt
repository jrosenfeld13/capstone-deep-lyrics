I feel it too
Try not to talk
Try not to think of why we're here
You guide me, hit me
Somewhere inside of me

And no one here
To verify
No camera shooting what your eyes say
This way i might forget about today

Oooh how, good how
Wonderful it is
It almost makes me wanna think
There is a reason for all this

I used to be a disbeliever
Love was unreal
Just like moviestars
And crashing cars
And shooting stars
And Star Wars
But it's true

Oooh how, good how
How wonderful it is
It almost makes me wanna think
There is a reason for all this
