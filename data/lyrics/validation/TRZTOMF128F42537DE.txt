They say our glory years have come and gone
But what do they know, them fuckin' cunts
Things will never be like they were before
That's what they say as they walk out the door
But the young ones
We shoot straight from the heart
We're gonna finish what we start
We're gonna unify
Punks and skins never say die

[Chorus:]
Punks and skins wear boots and braces
Punks and skins wear angry faces
Punks and skins ain't gonna fight
Punks and skins never say die
The time to have fun has come at last
No more fightin', what a fuckin' blast
If you don't hate me, I won't hate you
Cuz we're both the same, me and you
When the nazis come, we're gonna fight
You and me, standing side by side
We're gonna unify
Punks and skins never say die

[Chorus]
