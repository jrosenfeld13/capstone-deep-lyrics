Suddenly came from somewhere
A threatening storm of dreadful fear
This slowly rising became fast
More critical and dangerous

It filled the air with dust and dirt
And swallowed the light from the earth
The sky stands under burning fires
Spread the age of dark empires

See the tears in my eyes
Take a look to the skies
There's nothing to prevent
We are waiting for the end
Our world is dying
Mother earth is crying
There's nothing to prevent
We are waiting for the end

Devastated landscapes everywhere
Breathe contaminated air
Feel and taste the acid rain
Falling down, increasing pain

Last days of the whole mankind
Senseless race against the time
In a world without a chance
Where nothing still remains
