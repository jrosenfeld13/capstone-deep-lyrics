To all that's heeding the call
To the freaks that crawl
Into sight when the night falls
Going out to you
It's a shout to do that do
'Til you cant do it any more

I believe it's a good time calling
I believe it's a good time calling
I believe that they're calling out
Specifically for me

Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go

You're getting by
You're weak, too shy to speak
Too high for sleeping
It's time to lose your mind
You'd better get out now
If you're thinking of leaving

I believe it's a good time calling
I believe it's a good time calling
And I'll dance like Jack Palance
With every chance I get

Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go

Why don't you just climb on?
Why don't you just climb on?
Why don't you just climb on?
Why don't you just climb on?
Why don't you just climb on?
Why don't you just climb on?
Why don't you just climb on?
Why don't you just climb on?
Why don't you just climb

Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
