I knew my youth couldn't last forever
I knew some chords so I got the band together
Sick of sleeping and beating up my mother
Forget those luxuries, I've got myself another buzz

Now you don't see me, now you do
Pretty soon now you're going to see what punks can do

I stole some tunes from the radio
I lost my nerve but it didn't show
I found some friends with a little faith
Less money and no taste

Now you don't see me, now you do
Pretty soon now you're going to see what punks can do

But you've got to work at it
What a drag
You've got to work, work, work, work
You can't lag behind

I want to get this gig over, and I don't want to see it again
But I don't want to go until it's over, and I don't want to die in pain

I know my youth can't last forever
I'll sing the words until I can't keep the band together no more
Oh, to do the quickstep on a Saturday night
And hunt like a brave man with a flashlight

Now you don't see me, now you do
Pretty soon now you're going to see what punks can do
