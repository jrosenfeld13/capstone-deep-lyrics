See it comin', double trouble

I was getting worried, every hair was out of place
And the sun was setting early, I was heading for the race
But I guess I lied and I said I didn't care
When all that I want is to turn around and find you there

Got to keep it all inside, never ever let it show
'Cause they say it's dirty and that you should never know
But I think you know 'cause I see it in your eyes
You can understand the motive 'cause you're driven by the same desire

And they call it double trouble
Yeah, I know it's double trouble
See it comin', double trouble

It will find me, double trouble
Got to fight it, double trouble
'Cause I know it's double trouble

We meet and it's so complete
Am I dreaming again, always doing what is wrong
And it's such a fight when we gotta say goodnight
'Cause I know I got the power if I wanna let it flow

Well, I feel a little weak in my body, in my soul
Can I stay in the shade or just let it go
But I think you know that it's pretty hard to hide
You can understand the struggle, it's the same denial

And they call it double trouble
Yeah, I know it's double trouble
See it comin', double trouble

It will find me, double trouble
Got to fight it, double trouble
'Cause I know it's double trouble

So I'm always hanging on
Closing my mouth
I don't know
Something, someone, somewhere, somehow

I'm always hanging on, now

And they call it double trouble
Yeah, I know it's double trouble
See it comin', double trouble

It will find me, double trouble
Got to fight it, double trouble
'Cause I know it's double trouble

And they call it double trouble
Yeah, I know it's double trouble
See it comin', double trouble

It will find me, double trouble
Got to fight it, double trouble
'Cause I know it's double trouble
