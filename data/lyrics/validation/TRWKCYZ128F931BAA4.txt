Don't take me for granted, don't take me for granted
Hey boyfriend, I'm with you
I'm right at your side wherever you want to go in life boy
I'm ready to go, I'll take the ride whenever you need my loving
It'll be reserved for you anytime there's a whole

I'll be the fountain that fills you up but just..
Don't take me for granted
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you
Make time for love and so will I
I really wanna make this work
I wanna see it through
Forget me not, or I'll say goodbye
