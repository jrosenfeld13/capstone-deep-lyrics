Mescaline in the sun
You try so hard, to find someone
I used to be a hero
Blood on my saddle
Fight in every battle
I used to be alone

You shoot up
Then you go to class
It's funny how nobody asks
'Cause all your teachers love you
Everybody loves you
Everybody loves you the same way that I do
What a wonderful world we live in

You're a love disaster, your heart beats faster, when it's with mine
You're a likely story, morning glory on the vine

There are holy ghosts pushing past the tide
They let me know, every time you cry
You're burning in some back seat, burning in some room
Burning is the one thing that you should know how to do

But I can't put out a fire when it looks like you
You didn't do the same when I asked you to
What a wonderful world we live in

You're a love disaster, your heart beats faster, when it's with mine
You're a likely story, morning glory on the vine
