The spirit of the people
The spirit of the people
The spirit of the people
The rhythm has begun ...

Old men with their protocol
Lead us off to war
Sometimes we don't even know
What we're fighting for
Marching to the beat of their drum

Leaders we no longer trust
Told too many lies
The promises they made to us
Were never realised
Hear me now the chant has begun

Nowhere left to turn
No-one left to turn to
Voices raised in anger
They don't have the answer
Our whole world's in danger

Oil slicks on the ebbing tide
Progress out of hand
Blind men choke on swallowed pride
Heads down in the sand
Don't wanna see the damage they've done

Trees destroyed by acid rain
Falling from the skies
When our children place the blame
Who will tell them why
Hear me now the chant has begun

Why is love so rare
All this talk of warfare
Voices raised in anger
They don't have an answer
Pass the word along
We can wait no longer
Too much blind destruction
Follow love's instructions
Now the chant has begun

(chant)

Make your choice there's no escape
Add your voice, the chant has begun
