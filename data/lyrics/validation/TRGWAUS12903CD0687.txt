I remember a boy in his back yard
And all the games he used to play
Looking for armies to conquer
And dragons to slay
Fearlessly seeking adventure
Riding a make-believe steed
Swearing to all on his honor
To be all he can be, 'cause...

Chorus:
A brave soul fights the good fight
Defending his castle with all of his might
It's an age-old story of life, there are those
Depending on one brave soul

The day finally came when the soldier
Set out to take on the world
Armed with the heart of a warrior
With his flag unfurled
But real life was not like the back yard
Now enemies are hard to define
The difference between good and evil
Is a very fine line, but...

(Chorus)
Now I'm behind the wheel of my Chrysler
At the end of my daily war
I pull in the drive and I wonder
What's it all for
Then I see a boy in the back yard
I smile at the games that he plays
He's counting on me to defend him
When there are dragons to slay

And a brave soul does all he can
And that makes a hero from an everyday man
He holds it all in his hands
Now I finally know that I am

(Chorus)
I remember a boy in his back yard
And all the games he used to play
