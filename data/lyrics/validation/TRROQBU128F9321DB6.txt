Dave Alvin
(Blue Horn Toad Music, BMI)

Well when I was a young boy
I used to slip away
Down to the ashgrove
To hear the old blues men play
There was Big Joe and Lightnin'
And Reverend Gary too
Well I'd sit and stare and dream
Of doin' what they could do

Well it's been thirty years since the ashgrove burned down
And I'm out on this highway travelin' town to town
Tryin' to make a livin'
