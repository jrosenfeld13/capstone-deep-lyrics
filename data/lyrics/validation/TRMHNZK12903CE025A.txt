[Intro]
Hey!

[Verse 1]
I've got a pocket full of pretty green
I'm gonna put it in the fruit machine
I'm gonna put it in the jukebox
It's gonna play all the records in the hit parade

[Verse 2]
I've got a pocket full of pretty green
I'm gonna give it to the man behind the counter
He's gonna give me food and water
I'm gonna eat that and look for more

[Chorus]
This is the pretty green, this is society
You can't do nothing unless it's in the pocket, oh no

[Verse 1]
I've got a pocket full of pretty green
I'm gonna give it to the fruit machine
I'm gonna put it in the jukebox
It's gonna play all the records in the hit parade

[Chorus]
This is the pretty green, this is society
You can't do nothing unless it's in the pocket, oh no


And they didn't teach me that in school
It's something that I learnt on my own
That power is measured by the pound or the fist
It's as clear as this

Hey, P R E double T Y G R double E N
P R E double T Y G R double E N
P R E double T Y G R double E N
P R E double T Y G R double E N

[Verse 1]
I've got a pocket full of pretty green
I'm gonna put it in the fruit machine
I'm gonna put it in the jukebox
It's gonna play all the records in the hit parade

[Verse 2]
I've got a pocket full of pretty green
I'm gonna give it to the man behind the counter
He's gonna give me food and water
I'm gonna eat that and look for more

[Chorus]
This is the pretty green, this is society
You can't do nothing unless it's in the pocket, oh no

[Outro]
I've got a pocket full of pretty green
Alright
Alright, already
