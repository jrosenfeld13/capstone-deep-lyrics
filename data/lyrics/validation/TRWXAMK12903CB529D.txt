We shoot power to your heart
A mighty thunderbolt
We charge all batteries
We save your soul
We don't know when we're licked
But we turn lead into gold
We know alchemy
We bring you rock 'n' roll

We are the ones you love
Or we're the ones you hate
We are the ones always
Too early or too late
We are the first and
We still might be the last
We are Motrhead
Born to kick your ass

We bring the firestorm
To brighten up your life
We mend all broken hearts
We cure all pain
We bring you attitude
And razor teeth to bite
We bring machine gun law and
We're the ones to blame

We are the ones you need
The ones that you despise
We are the ones who wanna
Poke you in the eye
We are the future, baby
Used to be the past
We are Motrhead
And we don't have no class

We bring you UFOs, saucers in the sky
We shoot you full of noise
We aim to kill
We burn like motherfuckers
Spit right in your eye
We fight authority, we glorify free will

We are the ones you heard of
But you never heard
We are electric prophets
Here to twist the world
We are the flame at night
The fire in the trash
We are Motrhead
We are Motrhead

We are Motrhead
We are Motrhead
We are Motrhead
We are Motrhead
