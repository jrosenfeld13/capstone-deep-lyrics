I hate your can't stand your holding back but
I wanna say much more. Every day gets worse
Can't take this we made this it's been a long time
I'm running out of patience. Watch those evil words

Don't slow down don't go down you should learn how
To take it to the last round. Think of circumstance

Everyones opinions matter more than your words of wisdom
Give it one more chance
Now you know this is your life and it's so beautiful but pitiful
It's typical and
Now you know this is your life and it's so beautiful but pitiful
It's typical and it's all yours

It's not fair you don't care sometimes I wish we never made it here
Don't mean what you say
Use your voice make some noise it's on the table so you better make
The right choice. Can't have it your way

Now you know this is your life and it's so beautiful but pitiful
It's typical
Now you know this is your life and it's so beautiful but pitiful
It's typical and it's all yours

Now you know this is your life and it's so beautiful but pitiful
It's typical and
Now you know this is your life and it's so beautiful but pitiful
It's typical and it's all yours
