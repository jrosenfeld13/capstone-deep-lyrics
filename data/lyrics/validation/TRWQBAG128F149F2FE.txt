[Verse 1]

It ain't about the tea and biscuits, I'm one of those English misfits
I don't drink tea, I drink spirits and I talk a lot of slang in my lyrics
These goes a horse, horses for courses, nah more like corpses on corners
And Staffordshire Bull Terriers and late night crawlers
Police carry guns not truncheons, make your own assumptions
London ain't all crumpets and trumpets, it's one big slum pit

[Pre-Chorus]

We ain't all posh like the Queen, we ain't all squeaky clean
Now do the Tony Blair, throw your hands in the air now everywhere
We ain't all squeaky clean, we ain't all posh like the Queen
Now do the Tony Blair, throw your hands in the air now everywhere

[Chorus]

This is the picture, I painted my low down
This my London that I call my home town
It's where I'm living and this is my low down
This is my England I'm letting you know now

[Verse 2]

No I don't watch the Antiques Roadshow, I'd rather listen Run the Road
And smoke someone's fresh homegrown
And not get bloated on a plate of scones
Cricket, bowls, croquet, nah PS2 all the way, in an English council apartment
No we don't all wear bowler hats and hire servants
More like 24 hour surveillance and dog shit on the pavement

[Pre-Chorus]

We ain't all posh like the Queen, we ain't all squeaky clean
Now do the Tony Blair, throw your hands in the air now everywhere
We ain't all squeaky clean, we ain't all posh like the Queen
Now do the Tony Blair, throw your hands in the air now everywhere

[Chorus]

This is the picture I painted my low down
This my London that I call my home town
It's where I'm living and this is my low down
This is my England I'm letting you know now

[Verse 3]

Big up Oliver Twist, showin' us the nitty gritty of what London really is
It ain't all pretty, deal with the realness
It's all gritty, deal with the realness
Ohh the changing of the Queen's guard
That's nothing for me to march out of my house fo'
Tra la la, I'd rather sit on my arse
And have a glass of Chardonnay, nah
We ain't all Briget Jones clones, who say pardon me
More like what's gwanin mate, you get me?
Now I can select a few, paper people like to reject all my views
Well I'm letting you know the news and
Well, this is the straight up truth

[Pre-Chorus x4]

[Chorus x2]

[Outro]
