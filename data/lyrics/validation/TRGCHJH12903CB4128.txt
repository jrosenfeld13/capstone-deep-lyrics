In Autumn leaves won't leave the trees
In Winter sun will always shine
In Spring the flowers will bloom with ease
In Summer birds will fill the skies

Say
There's something beautiful around the corner
Say
There's something going on between my feet

Though other ?? should wilt and fade
A strange and suddenly they grew
Love itself will grow again
Blossoming out into the blue

Say
There's something beautiful around the corner
Say
There's something going on between my feet

Say
There's something beautiful around the corner
Say
There's something going on between my feet

In Autumn leaves won't leave the trees
In Spring the flowers will bloom with ease
In Summer birds will fill the skies
