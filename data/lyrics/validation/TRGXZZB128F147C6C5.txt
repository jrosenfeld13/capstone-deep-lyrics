Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye
Don't be angry with me should I cry
I'm a fool but I'll love you dear until the day I die
Now and then there's a fool such as I

Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through
I'm a fool but I'll love you dear until the day I die
Now and then there's a fool such as I

Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you
