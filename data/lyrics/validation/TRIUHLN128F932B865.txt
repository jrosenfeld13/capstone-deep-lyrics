When I held you last night, I could not believe
That some day not too long off I would have to leave
But I can't tell you what you'll always mean to me
There's things you just can't say, and apparently just can't see

But I know that sooner or later, we'll be together
Everything can't keep going wrong forever
Well I don't know what you want and what I want and whatever
But things have been worse, but things could be better

Maybe you can't be the girl I want you to
Maybe you don't understand yourself, but see, I do
So maybe there's an answer -- I'm asking you

There's so many things that I can't keep a perspective
I'm losing sight of the primary objective
I want to say "to heck with it," things are getting hectic
But every now and then there's that glimmer of perfection
But all the time I don't know what's good for me
Or which way to go
And I told myself I didn't care about that
But I cut myself in half

There's a time for changing, and for letting go
I can't save the future now, but let me know

Where I think I'm going, what I've left behind
What I look forward to knowing, what I hope to find
All leads back to one place, straight into your arms
I can't be complete unless I know where you are
