On desolate shores sitting all alone my jewelled cup had once been overflowing now emptied your poison takes
My life the emerald has now turned to stone our castles have overgrown Sea Princess take my hand once more
Carry me to dark emerald lands of loss so i may forget the priceless jewels Lulled into a deep mysterious sleep
Sights of lost love and glimmering hope here my emotions have diverged to gather the flowers of youth Sea
Princess you've awoken my dormant passion your bare hands undress me not like before O minstrel serenade me
With your lute entrance me with your distant sounds the only thing to touch me now would be the icicles from
Your heart wandering through the wild and rich fields feeling now as one forever who knew such beauty could
Grow in such a barren cold place Sea Princess I bestow this emerald covet and cover with all your seas
