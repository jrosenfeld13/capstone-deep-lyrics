Young girl so sweet
And once so innocent
Your life so brutal
True emotions suppressed
You scream , but he won't
Hear a word till
He's had his away
Victim of the cruelest
Kind of love

Against his urges there's
No defence
The one who gave you life
Stole your innocence
You want to be at any cost
But you're chained by the shame
And everything seems to be lost

[Chorus]
Bringer of torture

You're not afraid of dying
Nothing could be worse
Than this life
You're terrified of the pain
The pain that returns
With the night

[Chorus REPEATS]
Insanity and terror
Hand and hand
Till childhood dreams
Comes to an end
The situation, so vile and insane
Will never be over
He's coming back again
Again and again
