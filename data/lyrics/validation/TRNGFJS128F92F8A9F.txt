How can I love you boy when you don't even love yourself?
I'm useless now as I have always been
Just like some worthless love song dying on the radio
We talk in circles 'til we don't know what we mean

No happy ever after, no big dark man
Ain't no perfect situation, can't you understand

Loving you is some strange voodoo
Loving you is some strange voodoo

How can I help you boy when I can barely help myself?
I'm useless now as I have always been
Your lying eyes, your thieving hands, you're such a rogue at times
But you will always be a part of me

No happy ever after, no big dark man
Ain't no perfect situation, ain't no master plan

Loving you is some strange voodoo
Loving you I keep loving you yes I do
Loving you is some strange voodoo
Loving you is some strange voodoo

No happy ever after, no big dark man, no
Ain't no perfect situation, can't you understand

Loving you is some strange voodoo
Loving you I keep loving you yes I do
Loving you is some strange voodoo
Loving you is some strange voodoo

Loving you
Loving you
Loving you
