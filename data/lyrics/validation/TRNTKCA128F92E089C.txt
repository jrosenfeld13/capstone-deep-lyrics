I'm just staring at the moon like it was yesterday
See my face reflected in the lights, in the window
In the window pane, trees outside are still
I take a sleeping pill and feel a little less pain
You're just sitting in the sun watching the boats go by
Boats chained to the pier
In the window of the boat there's a picture
Of your family younger than their years
Well, I saw our time come
And I saw our time go
Like a fog in the light
And on the blackening ocean side
Ooh, it doesn't feel like yesterday
Ooh, it doesn't feel like yesterday
Ooh, it doesn't feel like yesterday
Ooh, it doesn't feel like yesterday
But it's yesterday, oh like yesterday
