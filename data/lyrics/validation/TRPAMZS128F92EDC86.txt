I don't wanna wake up
All day long
I don't wanna wake up

You know those days.when it doesn't matter what you do
It still feels like you're trapped in a room without a view
You're outta luck, lame, dumb and sick
All you have to carry, it's just too big
The burden of the world, it's on your shoulders

I don't wanna wake up
All day long
I don't wanna wake up

You know those dayswhen your heart just skips a beat
One step forward, two steps back but you don't know what it needs
You feel bad, burned, hit and kicked
You're in a warzone that you can't predict
The misery of the world, it's on your shoulders

I don't wanna wake up
All day long
I don't wanna wake up

You know those days.. you feel down and out
You know those days.. you can live without
Expectations you cannot live up to
Here's what I do

I don't wanna wake up
All day long
I don't wanna wake up
I will skip this day right now
