Don't be shy tonight
This is alright
Find a way to play
Over and over again
Don't be shy tonight
This is alright
Find a way to play
Over and over again
Back together when I
Only thought about me and you
We used to make it better
So we now will got a lot to do
Could it be like I really see
You know my baby I'm the one you need
Get into (get into) the right groove
And my dreams now will come true
Don't be shy (be free) tonight (be free)
This is alright (The way you make me feel)
(It's gonna be so real)
Find a way (be free) to play (be free)
Over and over again
(It's gonna be so real)
I feel free, I feel free (4x)
Baby you're so special
There's something 'bout you I don't know
It's a kind of passion
So excite about you need to show
Could it be like I really see
You know my baby I'm the one you need
I'm the only one that you really need
Don't be shy (be free) tonight (be free)
This is alright (What honey s hould I do?)
(I really think of you)
Find a way (be free) to play (be free)
Over and over again
(I really think of you)
I feel free, I feel free (4x)
