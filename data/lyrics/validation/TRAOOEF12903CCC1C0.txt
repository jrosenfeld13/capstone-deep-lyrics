I shiver like a child
I see my life pass before my eyes
I'm crying blood
I shout out loud
I'm just a man among the crowd

I'll cut my hair, I'll find a job
I'll do anything to conceal my scrubs
But I can't believe it, it isn't me
I don't know who I'm trying to be

Turn 27, Rock 'n' roll heaven
24-7, Rock 'n' roll heaven

I don't wanna do these grown up things
I'll point my finger at queens and kings
I wanna play dumb
I wanna be a fool
Don't wanna have to keep my cool

Turn 27, Rock 'n' roll heaven
24-7, Rock 'n' roll heaven

My love is on the other side
Sweet angels lift me high into the sky
I've never been so close to the sun
Clouds are saving me
I enter the door
It's free

Turn 27, Rock 'n' roll heaven
24-7, Rock 'n' roll heaven

Turn 27, Rock 'n' roll heaven
24-7, Rock 'n' roll heaven
It's rock n roll

You are my heroes you are my friends
I come to see you once again
I'm going cold I'm going blind
I think I have to leave my mind
