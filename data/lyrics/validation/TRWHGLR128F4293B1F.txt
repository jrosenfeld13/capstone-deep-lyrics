Trapped in the heat of the sun
There's only pain and disorder
Now that my nightmare's begun
Time's standing still on the run

Crime pays it's too late

I'm burning in flames
I'm here to acclaim
Set my destiny
My wishing well
I'm burning in flames
I'm here to acclaim
Call me the game
The sea of flames

We try to escape from the warzone
On our way back to paradise
We've travelled the seven seas
Fighting the enemy's lines

Crime pays it's too late

I'm burning in flames
I'm here to acclaim
Set my destiny
My wishing well
I'm burning in flames
I'm here to acclaim
Call me the game
The sea of flames
