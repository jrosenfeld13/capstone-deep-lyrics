You better stop, better run away
You better listen to what I have to say
I'll keep you hang'in on the line
With just one kiss i willl blow your mind

Your desperation makes you feel insane
Fever running high you will never be the same

Chorus
Don't you treat me bad
Don't you make me sad
Our love could be deep as the ocean
If you can't be true I got news for you
Just remember I can be poison

Some people say that I'm hard to tame
They know that trouble is my middle name
Too dangerous what you want from me
This chemistry in my body

I've got you scared and now you're running blind
Don't make me mad cause you know I won't be kind oh so kind

Chorus (2x)

Dont give me empty reasons
Cause I don't want your lies
Don't think you can deceive
This poison deep inside

Chorus
