My momma don't told me
When I was in pigtails
My momma don't told me, hon
A man's gonna sweet talk
And he will give you the big eye
But when that sweet talking's done

A man is a two-faced, a worrisome thing
Who'll leave you to sing the blues in the night

Now the rain's are fallin'
I hear the trains are callin', hooey
My momma don't told me
Hear that lonesome whistle
A blowing across the trestle, hoo hooey

My momma don't told me, a hooey, a hooey
Old clickety clack is echoing back the blues in the night

The evenin' breeze will start the trees to cryin'
And the moon will hot its light
When you get the blues in the night

Oh, take my word the Mockingbird
Who'll sing the saddest kind of song
He knows things are wrong
And he's right

From Natchez to Mobile
From Memphis to St. Joe
Wherever the four winds blow
I've been to some big towns
I've heard me some big talk
But there is one thing I know

A man is a two faced, a worrisome thing
Who'll leave you to sing the blues in the night

My momma don't told me there's blues in the night
