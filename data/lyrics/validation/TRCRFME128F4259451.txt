Want to know a secret, most people are that bad
Compassion leads to many lies and trying to apply it will just drive you mad
It's only destiny calling with the usual show
Get out while you've got time, make up your heart and find the kind of folk who really love

You want to know how to tell them apart
You want to know how to feel in your heart
Too bad for you that they don't do a five day course in caring you could play the part
You're still searching for the ones who were near
You're still itching for that great panacea
But first you got to be alone and think what kept your friends contented all those years

Something about their eyes
I thought you couid tell by now
Remote control, off and jump now
Remote control, pull out the wires
Remote control, off and jump now
Remote control, pull out the wires
