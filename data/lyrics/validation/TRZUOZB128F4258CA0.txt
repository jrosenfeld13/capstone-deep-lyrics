Can you feel me?
They're watching me stare
Can you hear me?
With that noise filling everywhere

Work hard, play harder
Think fast, move faster
To make everything
To make everything
To make everything seem alright

You'll keep one eye shut
To make everything
To make everything
To make everything seem alright

I'll keep one eye shut
To make everything
To make everything
To make everything seem alright

Can you sense me?
My head's spinning round
Can you reach me?
But I keep my feet on the ground

Work hard, play harder
Think fast, move faster
To make everything
To make everything
To make everything seem alright

You must keep one eye shut
To make everything
To make everything
To make everything seem alright

You must keep one eye shut
To make everything
To make everything
To make everything seem alright

You must keep one eye shut
You must keep one eye shut
You must keep one eye shut

One eye shut
One eye shut
One eye shut
