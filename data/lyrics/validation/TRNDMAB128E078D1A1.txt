Lord! Oh, yeah
When you need a friend through thick and thin
Don't look to those above you
When you're down and out, ain't no doubt
Nobody wants you

But you're rock candy baby
Hard, sweet and sticky
Rock candy baby
Hard, sweet and sticky

When you're seventeen reachin' for your dreams
Don't let no one reach it for you
Pull up your pants
Stretch out take a chance
If it can be done, you can do it
