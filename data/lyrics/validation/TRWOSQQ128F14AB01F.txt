Everlasting God the years go by but you're unchanging
In this fragile world You are the only firm foundation
Always loving, always true
Always merciful and good, so good

Uncreated one You have no end and no beginning
Earthly powers fade but there is no end to Your kingdom
Always loving, always true
Always merciful and good, so good
Yesterday today and forever
You are the same, You never change
Yesterday today and forever
You are faithful and we will trust in You
Yesterday today and forever
You are the same, You never change
Yesterday today and forever
You are faithful and we will trust in You
Yahweh, God unchanging
Yahweh, firm foundation
