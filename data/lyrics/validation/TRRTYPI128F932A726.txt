I cannot sleep
I cannot breath
The air is gone

All i can see
Is you, is you

So time passes and i wait
Nothing comes to take me from this

I don't believe so
I ask so, I ask

When tomorrow comes again
Will I fall
Will I face this world again
Will the day by brighter than it was before

When tomorrow comes again
Will It last
Will we stand on our own again
I can't believe that we still can
Its time to say goodbye and just move on

The fall's open me
Thought focus
Lost in memory
To blind to see
The truth in you
Another sense of light
I'll just close my eyes
Until the sun shines down on me

When tomorrow comes again
Will I fall
Will I face this world again
Will the day by brighter than it was before

When tomorrow comes again
Will It last
Will we stand on our own again
I can't believe that we still can
Its time to say goodbye and just move on
