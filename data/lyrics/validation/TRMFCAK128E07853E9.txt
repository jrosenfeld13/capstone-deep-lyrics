I know you heard about the Winans see
We're a Godly dynasty
Serving G O D
Next in line is me
Not the X but next generation of several men of God
Taking it to another level
Devil what's up? Is this a joke or what?
Steady hoping you can crack open the Coconut
You can't see us, we're covered by the blood
And we're just chips off the old block
Representing Jesus
Hey, Phase 2 who we gonna give the praise to Jesus
Plus thank Him for the ones who raised you
I'm Marvin Jr. some say the second and I'm respecting
My Daddy for the pastor of perfecting
He taught me to be holy and guard against the levin
Can't wait to go to heaven saved since I was seven
Doing what Jesus would do, not what everyone does
I'm sanctified and I'm still have fun ''cause
I'm Carvin son of Carvin
Twin brother of Uncle Marvin
I'm saved and tall and dark skin
Taking heed to words from the wise
Chumping humble pies and never compromise
Saying God is tops yo props go to pops thou
He brought me up in church through a legacy of gospel
Surrounded by a course of saints that came before us
Back to Grandpa David and Delores
Then they had children keeping the holy cycle
To David, Ronald, then the twins and Michael to Daniel, BeBe
CeCe, Angie and Debbie let me praise God 'cause my whole family
Is set free hallelujah I'm buzzin' two short of a dozen sibling singing for God
Now it's me and my cousin, what in the world would we end for
Let's make it ten more
Following examples of our mentor
What's up with you, What! What about you? Who Me?
I thought you knew, Carvin Jr. is a Winans too
What! What about you, the legacy ain't through, say what!
'Cause you know that I'm a Winans too
What! What about you? Who me? I thought you knew, Coconut is a Winans too
What! What about you? The legacy ain't through, 'cause you know I'm a Winans too
Follow you as you follow God you that I'm a Winans
You know that I'm a Winans, so what about you
Phase 2
Follow you as you follow God you know that I'm a Winans
You know that I'm a Winans, so what about you
Phase 2
Phase 2 coming back at you we young but never last stature
On a fat track I think that ate a fat batch of
Cookies rookies flowing to a beat that ain't starving
I'm Juan second son of Carvin a tight beat to excite peeps
Unlike a sleeping pill young teenage Christians we gots to keep it real
I'm not deranged don't think it's strange 'cause we're the
Winans but still it's time to make that change
Flip flop gospel R&B dipped and hip hop us copy-cattin' y'all
Will be a trip pop I learn from them but why would I pretned to
Be any one else when I got my own identity, buch respect to the
Winans and BeBe and CeCe, but we are Phase 2 gots to be me
God called us to reach a whole 'nother day and time
Passing the mic to Mike I'll relay the rhyme
We're grooving so keep it moving
Yo we will not cease
Yo I'm Mike son of Mike last and not least
Heads boopin' fingers poppin' like hot grease
We jammin' and we got Jesus so we got peace
See I believe God's word and I never doubted
Walk it out saints shout and the devil pouted
Hell is crowded full of people that's 'bout it, 'bout it
But I strive to be God's man and proud about it
Hands in the air for Jesus my price payer
I'm not player but I'm a prayer
And ladies I'm just the type of guy to warn my dates
Don't think we're gonna mate
'Cause I don't fornicate
That's how we do Lord always givin' You praise
Straight from the Winans same God new phase
And ever since I was sucking on my baby bottle
You were the model I wanna follow
What's up with you, What! What about you? Who me?
I thought you knew, what Mike Jr. is a Winans too
What! What about you. Who me? I thought you knew
Juanie Juan is a Winans too. What! What about you?
The legacy ain't through, 'cause you know that I'm a Winans too
You know that I'm a Winans, you know that I'm a Winans
You know that I'm a Winans, you know that I'm a Winans
