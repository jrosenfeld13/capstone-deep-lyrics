Let's rock, let's rock!
C'mon everybody, let's rock!

Well I come from a place called New York City
Where the fellas are fly and the girls are pretty

Let's rock, let's rock!
C'mon everybody, let's rock!

My name is Smiley and I just want to say
That I could rap non-stop to the break of day

Let's rock, let's rock!
C'mon everybody, let's rock!

Throw your hands up in the air
Everybody shake your derriere
If you're feeling good and you want to rock
Somebody say oh yeah (Oh yeah!)
Oh yeah (Oh yeah!)
Let's go to work
Through rain, through shine, through sleet or snow
(It's Smiley, ho! in stereo!)
Cause I make the people freak to the funky beat
I got a danger voice to make ya move you feet
I got vicious rhymes to get ya out your seat
And keep ya movin' while I'm groovin' to the funky beat
Feet-feet-funk-funky beat
(Feet-feet-funk-funky beat)
(Smiley! rock the house)
(Freak for me one time, turn it out!)

Just gather around, it's time to begin
Open up your minds and let me in
Because I've been on since the day of my birth
They sent me from heaven to rock the Earth
When I was born the Lord looked down
Said a girl like me would never be found
And then he gave me a jazzy voice
So wherever I'm heard I'll be the only choice
To rock that body from east to west
Cause I'm the girl MC with the most finesse
(Smiley rocks the best, north to south, east to west!)

Ho-ho!
Ho-ho!
Ho-ho!

Here's Smiley!

Well if you come a little closer I sure can tell
That I'm the girl that rocks so well
With my sexy voice and my devilish rhymes
They're guaranteed for a good time
(Smiley!) Yeah, that's my name
Destined for [?], fortune and fame
(Smiley! Yeah that's our choice!)
The one with the sexy, devilish voice

When I get on the mic I make the people feel good
Because I do it just like an MC should
You start to clap your hands whenever I speak
Moving your body to my funky beat
I rock on the mic so viciously
Everybody knows lady Smiley
I'm the one MC that make the people dance
I use my voice and put ya in a trance
Soon you'll start to lose control
Of your mind, your body and your soul
You can rock if you get on the floor
So c'mon everybody what you waitin' for
Let's rock, let's rock
C'mon everybody, let's rock

(Let's rock! let's rock!)
(C'mon everybody, let's rock!)

Let's rock, let's rock
C'mon everybody, let's rock

(Let's rock! let's rock!)
(C'mon everybody, let's rock!)

Just work that body, work-work your body
(Work that body, work-work your body!)

Move that body, move-move your body
(Move that body, move-move your body!)

Let's go to work!
(Let's go to work!)

Let's go to work!
(Let's go bezerk!)

If you're feeling good and you're all on [?]
Somebody say hooo! (Hoooo!)
Hooo! (Hoooo!)
