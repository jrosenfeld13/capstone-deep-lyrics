I could you feel you
You were there
And I could hold you
But you're not there
I, I'm gonna wait
I, I'm gonna wait
And I'm gonna wait

I just want you to know
I want you to know
All that I have is
All that I forgot to say
I want you to know
I didn't go
All that I have is
All that made you run away

I could see you
You were there
And I could hear you
But you're not there
I, I'm gonna wait
I, I'm gonna wait
And I'm gonna wait

I just want you to know
I want you to know
All that I have is
All that I forgot to say
I want you to know
I didn't go
All that I have is
All that made you run away

IIII'm gonna wait
II'm gonna wait
I just want you to know
I want you to know
All that I have is
All that I forgot to say
I want you to know
I didn't go
All that I have is
All that made you run away
All that made you run away
