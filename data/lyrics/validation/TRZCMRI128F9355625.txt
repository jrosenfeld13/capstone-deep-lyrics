Im moving on; plowing through
A violent landscape
Candlelight, oh, Devil Bride
Crisp until you break
Well I give so the ranks in fear [?]
You could not mystify
Limb by limb Ill feed you in
I, the Serpent in the Tide
From haunted dreams her bloke did speak
"To expand is to slay!"
A tunnel to infinity, dazzling all the way
Radiant matters bouncing out; thunder purified
Truer than sides, sees the lie
Laughter in the sky
Theres a cry ringing out oer land and sea
Star-crossed our weary hearts
Absorbed for light, he set us free
Walk so weak, too stoned to speak
I keep it to myself
Dont fuck with me, Im hovering
Im higher than hell
