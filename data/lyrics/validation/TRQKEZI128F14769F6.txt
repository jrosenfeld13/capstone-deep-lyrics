Come one, come all, to see the persecution of man
The end of the world is now, so take your stand
Don't hesitate in chance you might be too late
The coming of the Lord will determine your fate
The revolution has begun
The time to give your life has come
Christ awaits you with open arms
So open your heart to Him
Blood has been spilled, a prophecy fulfilled
The Lord is coming down. our future is revealed
The time to change is now
The book has been wrote so come on
Hurting people, and jump on the gospel boat
You've given your life to Christ
For He had paid the price
Crucified for you, salvation comin' through
Heavens opened up, the skies are lookin' blue
Jesus Christ, the Lord, means eternal life for you
