Spread your wings, I'm all set
Trans Atlantic westbound jet
Heading out to JFK
I'll play my guitar along the way

It's the only thing I can do
Stick with me and we'll see it through
Make the most, without delay
I'm gone tomorrow but here today

Travel through the nation
In need of stimulation, Oh yeah
Travel through the nation
In search of situations, yeah

Boogaloo well walk on through
My prescription's good for you
Be my guest and fly with me
It's a way of life, a high for free

Travel through the nation
In need of stimulation, Oh yeah
Travel through the nation
In search of situations, yeah
