[Verse:]
I lose my blues, honey, when I'm with you
No one else can do you're in my heart to stay
But when I'm gone, and I'm all alone
I'll be singing this song I wanna be with you, always
I'd be happy, dearest, if you could only be here
And always be nearer, forever and a day
Then we'd travel far, we'd be some big shinin' star
Just you and my guitar and stay there, sweetheart for always
I hope you feel the same, you really want my name
Well, you'll be the one who's to blame
If it works out wrong that day
Cause my love is true, my love is only for you
I'll never be blue, if I can be with you, always
