Love hurts, love scars, love wounds and mars
Any heart not tough or strong enough
To take a lot of pain, take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud holds a lot of rain
Love hurts, mmm, mmm, love hurts
I'm young I know but even so
I know a thing or two I learned from you
I really learned a lot, really learned a lot
Love is like a stove burns you when it's hot
Love hurts, mmm, mmm, love hurts
Some fools think of happiness
Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess
But they're not fooling me
I know it isn't true, know it isn't true
Love is just a lie made to make you blue
Love hurts, mmm, mmm, love hurts

Love hurts, love scars, love wounds and mars
Any heart not tough or strong enough
To take a lot of pain, take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud holds a lot of rain
Love hurts, mmm, mmm, love hurts

I'm young I know but even so
I know a thing or two I learned from you
I really learned a lot, really learned a lot
Love is like a stove burns you when it's hot
Love hurts, mmm, mmm, love hurts

Some fools think of happiness
Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess
But they're not fooling me
I know it isn't true, know it isn't true
Love is just a lie made to make you blue
Love hurts, mmm, mmm, love hurts...
