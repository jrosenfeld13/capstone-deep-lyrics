Be like that
Why can't we, you and me, we just
Be like that
More than friends, more than we've ever been
Be like that
Stop! (Stop.. Stop)

Been feelin' this feelin'
Since we've been healin', I won't lie
Caught up in good, as it should
As blessed all of my pride
Keep up the heads and the moment be there
I won't blush
Can't keep this secret much longer
When it's you that I want (Hey, hoah)
Can't keep my eyes off ya (Hey, hoah)
Can't keep my mind off of ya
I can't keep this love all to myself (Hey, hoah)
Can this be right? (Hey, hoah)
Can it be all night?
Tell me what you wanna do
'Cause I'm trying to deal with you

[Chorus:]
Be like that
Why can't we, you and me, we just
Be like that
More than friends, more than we've ever been
Be like that
Stop the shyness, the frontin' and it's all about lovin' you
Be like that
Why can't we, you and me, be like that

You act like you don't know
What's going on
To thinkin' of a girl could be
'Cause that's where you're wrong
It's me, it's me
Oh, it's always been me
I've been feelin' you from the dark
I just want us to be more (Hey, hoah)
Can't keep my eyes off ya (Hey, hoah)
Can't keep my mind off of ya
I can't keep this love all to myself (Hey, hoah)
Can this be right? (Hey, hoah)
Can it be all night?
Tell me what you wanna do
'Cause I'm trying to get with you

[Repeat Chorus x2]
Maybe you're wrong
For comin' on so strong
But the love we had as friends has really grown
Everything I can want you
Bring to my life
Happiness, peacefulness, joyfulness

[Repeat Chorus x3]
