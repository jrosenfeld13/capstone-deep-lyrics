Trading pieces from a suitcase on a bench
Customers turned on by the horrific stench
Packages, boxes, filled with bits
Tightly packed jars with lids
A torso a fiver, heads are ten
Severed, sawn bodies which once were men
The smell of rot, a potent stench
As I lay them on the bench

Limb by limb by
Limb by limb
As I lay on the bench
Bits and pieces all
Different races
Customers turned on by
The horrific stench
I like what Jeffrey Dahmer did
I like what Jeffrey Dahmer did
Limb by limb by
Limb by limb
Bits and pieces
Stewed in faeces
As I lay them on the bench

I like what Jeffrey Dahmer did
I like what Jeffrey Dahmer did
Limb by limb by
Limb by limb
Bits and pieces
Covered in faeces
As I lay them on the bench

Severed, sawn and sold as porn
Severed, sawn
Severed, sawn and sold as porn
