I would love to
Sing a song for you
That no one's heard
I would do my best
Pour out my heart
Hope you love every word

[bridge 1]
But simple words
And simple chords
Simply- fall short
Maybe we got it all wrong
We got it all wrong

[Chorus]
Maybe Worship is more
About reaching out
Than reaching up
And loving you
Is why we do it, we show others love
Maybe we've been missing, the point all along
Worship comes from
The singer not the song
(It's not the song no)

[verse 2]
I am afraid
Your heart would break
If you only knew
How we abused grace
And reduced praise
To a beat, and a tune

[bridge 2]
O Jesus, please forgive us for our fear, we have made
Worshiped you for so long we got It all wrong

[Chorus]
Maybe Worship is more
About reaching out
Than reaching up
And loving you
Is why we do it, we show others love
Maybe we've been missing, the point all along
Worship comes from
The singer not the song
(It's not the song no)

[verse 3]
You have all songs
Wonderful songs
They are worthless alone
It takes life to worship you
I want my life to worship you-

[Chorus]
Because Worship is more
About reaching out
Than reaching up
And loving you
Is why we do it, we show others love
Maybe we've been missing, the point all along
Worship comes from
The singer
Not the song

It's not the song no

It's more than a song no, it's so much more
