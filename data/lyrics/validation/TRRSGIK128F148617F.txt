(M. Crenshaw)

I went to a party last night
It was dullsville
'till I caught sight of Yvonne
Mmm, Yvonne, yeah
The girl by the window, Yvonne
Well she looked into my eyes
Turned me inside out
It was bad, bad desire
And I had to shout for Yvonne
Aw, Yvonne, ooh yeah
The girl by the window, Yvonne
Well Yvonne
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
You're fine, and beautiful too, yeah
And I want to love you a little while
Yeah you know I do
I mean I want to take you to my room
Where I can hold you near
She says 'All right' and I'm still here
With Yvonne, oh Yvonne
Mmm, the girl by the window, Yvonne
Well Yvonne
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
By you, is where I want to be, ooh wee
And just to love you a little while
And how you thrill me
Yes, I've got to take you to my room
Where I can hold you near
She says 'all right' and I'm still here
With Yvonne, mmm Yvonne say now now
The girl by the window, Yvonne
Well Yvonne
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Never let go, and just hold me tight
'Cause I want to love you a little while
And baby it's all, all right, oh yeah yeah!
I tell you Yvonne
I get dizzy in the head
Start thinking 'bout Yvonne
Come on, come on
The girl by the window
Yvonne, Yvonne, Yvonne
Sweet little girl by the window, Yvonne
Yeah, yeah, won't you take my love baby?
Come on, I said won't you take my love sweet baby?
Come on, my Yvonne
