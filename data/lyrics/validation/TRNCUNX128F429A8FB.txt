Pressure the impact no time to react destitution after the fact
Try to keep the tensions in tact a generations putrid attack

Treason and velvet
Maimed by affection
Treason and velvet
A scarelet infection

Principles of power which character assassins speak
Crafting plans to devour the bleeding hearts of the meek
And victims wait with you in mind
The victims kill to save your kind

Treason and velvet
Maimed by affection
Treason and velvet
A scarelet infection

We consume we contrive
All but strangle to survive
The solemn faces locked inside
The bastard self from which we hide
Tongue in cheek tied and twined
Rape the cause a bondage bind
