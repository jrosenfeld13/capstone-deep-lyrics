[Intro: Katie Holmes & Craig David]
Hey baby
Oh tell me Craig
Why do u wanna play these games with me
I thought u always wanted to be with me

Well at first girl i wanted to
But things have changed between me and you
Thats why i dont know what im gonna do

[Verse 1:]
Lately... you say i've been acting kinda strangely
Like i don't love you no more
You say call me...but i just can't explain its all so crazy
Between me and you baby, oh-oh

And even though at first you meant the world to me (world to me)
The time has come to spread my wings and be set free (be set free)
So i can figure out a place where i belong (i belong)
To find my way home now that love has gone (girl, now the love has gone)

So baby saying...

[Hook 1:]
Why don't you call me no more
It was every night you were calling me before
Given half a chance you'd be knocking at my door
So tell me what's changed (baby tell me what's changed)
Why don't you give me some time
Tell me coz i can't get you out of my mind
Right up until now we been doing just fine
So tell me what's changed (baby tell me what's changed)

[Verse 2:]
Baby...since we met i've treat you like a lady
But now i don't know what to do
I think maybe...it's just time my well for you has run empty
What am i gonna do baby oh-oh

And even though at first you made me so happy
My love for you has changed so put the blame on me
Under pressure it's too hard for me to stay
And i feel so guilty when you page me everyday
With a...

[Hook 2:]
Why won't you answer my page
It was you who said things were never gonna change
And it seems like lately you're acting kinda strange
So tell me what's changed (baby tell me what's changed)
Why can't you even pass by
Spend some of your time even just to say hi
You're not the type of guy who would make a girl cry
So tell me what's changed (tell me what's changed)

[Bridge:]
Girl i know, it seems like i don't care (i don't care)
After all the things we used to share (used to share)
Now i know that it feels like i've done you wrong
But the pain will heal the sooner that i'm gone (im gone, im gone)

[Hook 1:]
Why don't you call me no more
It was every night you were calling me before
Given half a chance you'd be knocking at my door
So tell me what's changed (baby tell me what's changed)
Why don't you give me some time
Tell me cus i can't get you out of my mind
Right up until now we been doing just fine
So tell me what's changed (baby tell me what's changed)

[Hook 2:]
Why won't you answer my page
It was you who said things were never gonna change
And it seems like lately you been acting kinda strange
So tell me what's changed (baby tell me what's changed)
Why can't you even pass by
Spend some of your time even just to say hi
You're not the type of guy who would make a girl cry
So tell me what's changed (tell me what's changed)

[Outro:]
Girl, i never meant to make you cry
Girl it's so hard to find the words to say
Though i never wanted girl to hurt you
Oh-oh girl please believe me
