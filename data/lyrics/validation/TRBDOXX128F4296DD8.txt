I drive all over town to the bars without a name
And it feels like Memphis after Elvis there's nothing going on
When you get to the top does it all work out?
You wanna start again with hope in your heart [Incomprehensible]

God bless you kid
And everything you did, yeah
God bless you kid
And everything you did, yeah

The boys all dressed in blue and the girls get dressed in white
The fire engines, the TV stations still tumble through the night
Go to bed, go to sleep with our ordinary lives
It's the same old, same old scene

God bless you kid
And everything you did, yeah
God bless you kid
And everything you did
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

God bless you kid
And everything you did, yeah
God bless you kid
And everything you did, yeah

Never grew up, I never grew down, yeah
I never grew up, I never grew down, yeah
I never grew up, I never grew down, yeah
I never grew up, I never grew down

God bless me kid
God bless me too

It feels like Memphis after Elvis
The kiss, the promise, kiss
I never grew up, I never grew down, yeah
God bless you kid

God bless you kid
God bless you kid
God bless you kid
