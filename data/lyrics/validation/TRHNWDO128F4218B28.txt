Hatred I can't stand it anymore
The color of our skin we must ignore
Do you feel the pain or see the hurt
Or do you let it pass right by instead?

(Chorus)
This fighting, dividing, y'know we'll only lose (x2)
How come we can stand for such a crime
Racial hate, a real sign of the times
We've gotta raise our voice, begin the fight
And equal world held high is in our sight

(Repeat Chorus)
Is this prejudice a way of life, tell me!
Do you wanna be just like your friends, pressure!
Is it 'cos you just jumped by someone, is it?
You're condemning those who choose to live, unfair!
