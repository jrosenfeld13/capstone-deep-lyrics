XTC OVERDRIVE
Prowling til' end of time, hey
Lotta women on the line

Drinkin' in overtime
Crashdet state of mind, hey
Gotta live it, ride the night

Gotta love whatcha doin' here
Cross the line til' you get yer share
You paid the price but it ain't that fair

Blasting out all our vibes
We are the future tribe
A ray of light, flashing in yer eyez
Passion of antichrist
Bursting in flames tonight
A way of life, pissing on yer lies

XTC OVERLOAD
Draining the scum of soul, hey
Gotta set it off to blow

Follow the wikked art
Tattoed inside my heart, pray
That I'll make it through the day

Gotta love whatcha doin' here
Cross the line til' you get yer share
You paid the price but it ain't that fair

Blasting out all our vibes
We are the future tribe
A ray of light, flashing in yer eyez
Passion of antichrist
Bursting in flames tonight
A way of life, pissing on yer lies

Get it on
Ow, better make it loud

Blasting out all our vibes
We are the future tribe
A ray of light, flashing in yer eyez
Passion of antichrist
Bursting in flames tonight
A way of life, pissing on yer lies
