[Verse]
Love is the egg, see
And it was born in a cloud with silver lining
Uh-huh
But it broke
I mean it hatched on the ground so time flew right by me
And voila

[Hook]
I know you thought that life was gonna be easy when you didn't call
You found out you were wrong
See, I know you thought your life was gonna be easy
You thought you had it all
But you found out you were wrong

See, maybe, there was something wrong, and you were telling me no wrong
See, maybe, the laugh's on me, and life was telling me a joke

[Verse]
Somethings's yours
And you let it go
If it comes back to you
It was yours all along

Well, I let you go, along with those lies from you
I wouldn't want those lies anew
Did the lies just get gone

[Hook]
I know you thought that life was gonna be easy when you didn't call
You found out you were wrong
See, I know you thought your life was gonna be easy
You thought you had it all
But you found out you were wrong

See, maybe, there was something wrong, and you were telling me no wrong
See, maybe, the laugh's on me, and life was telling me a joke

[Pharrell, speaking]
Hold it now
How do you feel right now
Yeah me too
Hey Yeah
Oh, babe!

Hold it now
You all right
See, do you remember what it's like to wake up in her love nest
(get it, love nest)
And now she's gone - gone, gone, gone

At which point you realize life is but a joke, and the laugh's on you
That's funny, Right?
Babe!
