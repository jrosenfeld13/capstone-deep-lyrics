Blindness as we consider our fate
Within our mortal wake
The will of one astray
To prevail my sins
At God's gate

Digress as we consider and fail
Forlorn this empty cage
As treachery invades
You consider the tears
And disengage

Tear me down and break me - I remain

I've never seen the love and confidence
To believe the faith and never speak again

Forever seething throes of opulence
To release the pain and never breathe again
Can you release the pain and never speak again
At God's gate

Tear me down and break me - I remain
