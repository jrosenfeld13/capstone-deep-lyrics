Rolled for a chance
Taking back
Earned my wings
Solid ground
Never fall
Fueled by strength
Scale the walls
Fearless fire, focused mind
Clear a way
Synchronize your soul and mind
Rising high
Feel the life
Grabbing on
Vision clears
A great escape
Claims our senses
Stride or fall
Cleanse to grow
Fight for all
Brick foundation
Play your own
Skill to gain
Own the strain
Lease your future hold
Future hold
Undying will
Silence all
Strife the odds
Overcome
Brave return
Crush rivalry
Breathe in thought
See an end
Tooth and nail
Seize, maintain control
Stride or fall
Cleanse to grow
Fight for all
Brick foundation
Play your own
Skill to gain
Own the strain
Lease your future hold
I never will kneel
I won't let go
Never chained or slowed
By a lack of drive or strength
Filled in soul
An everlasting flame I bring
Clash, combine
Defending my integrity
Shine
Foresee
A child born
Who thirsts to grow
Forever soar, sees
Perceptive judge of barren truth
A guided hand
Hold a vital force of life's desire
Flare the sky
Essential find
Fistic vein
The fuse that binds
Flare the sky
Essential find
Fistic vein
The fuse that binds
Sear the fuse
Fistic vein binds
A nature find
Brilliant sky I find
No other way
To build
Foundation
Forever soar, sees
Perceptive judge of barren truth
A guided hand
Hold a vital force of life's desire
Time, time is stalking you
Time is stalking you
The time is stalking you
Time is stalking you
