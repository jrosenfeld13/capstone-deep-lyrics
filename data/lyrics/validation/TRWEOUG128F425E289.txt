Long Way to Love (4:55)
D. Davidson

I see the love deep in your eyes
You let the love, grow in my mind

In the morning sun, I see your face
I can feel your love and your embrace

You fell in love right from the start
It has to last from falling apart

Repeat bridge

Long way, long way to love
Long way, long way to love

Your fires kept warm in my heart
You fed the flame from going out

Bridge, chorus, lead, chorus out
