I know you're married
(I just want to steal your heart away)
I know he loves you
(I just want to steal your heart away)
I know you're locked inside the vows that you have said
You don't need guys like me to try and turn your head
I know you're married
But I just want to steal your heart away

I know you're happy
(I just want to steal your heart away)
You don't look lonely
(I just want to steal your heart away)
I know you think that you've got promises to keep
You don't need guys like me to knock you off your feet
I know you're married
But I just want to steal your heart away

I know you fit my plans like my hand fits this glove
I plan to make my stand, so I can have your love
I know you're married
I know you're married
I know you're married
But I just want to steal your heart away

I don't believe you'll likely cast a role tonight
I know you don't believe that you could tell a lie
I know you tell yourself that you found love so fine
That you think no one else could ever change your mind
I know you're married
I know you're married
I know you're married
But I just want to steal your heart away
Hey I just want to steal your heart away
Hey I just want to steal your heart away
