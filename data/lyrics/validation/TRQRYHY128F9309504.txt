[Verse]
At 5:20 AM my alarm clock attacks, that...
{beep beep, beep] seeps in all the cracks
And the crevice that fucking clock is a menace
Barely form a sentence, drink coffee like Dennis
Just to stay alert so I don't get hurt
By spilling a bowl of hot grease all on my shirt
Or dipping down into the sink to fill a pail
And having a fork jab up under my nail
But gotta get my mail, cook bacon till it's crispy
Fighting off some lonely old resident trying to kiss me
You don't ever wanna leave your parents under the care
Under these, nursing homes and that's something I swear
Unless you hate your mom, want her to suffer
Then I'll be the sucker who has to cook her supper
Let's hope she don't give a shit about nutrition
Not the mission, part of the meal that is missing
And it's nasty if you lack teeth and can't eat
Everyday mash potatoes and puree meat
With all these diets, not much time for a break
This health care business don't give it take
Kitchen full of middle age immigrant ladies
Been doing the same dishes they've been doing since the 80's
And they're there now busting their ass as I write this
With problems at home, carpal tunnel and arthritis
So I hide some food on the side
Quietly tell 'em where it's at and then I slide
Get back to the egg salad, cooking the soup
For money, I jump through a fiery hoop
And some times I get burned, it's not worth what I earn
This job is in session and at 2:00 it ain't adjourned
It crawls on my back and I take this shit home
I can't shake it off it never leave me alone
This fucking job
Ooooh, I hate this fucking job

[Hook]
I work 6:00 to 2:00 and it conflict with what I do
You know, to see this hip hop come through
Spend more time with the lady I love
I don't wanna punch no clock, but who does?
To get my rest be in bed by nine
But my brain is working overtime, wanna write a rhyme
Dream of making money, doing what I love
I don't wanna punch no fucking clock but who does?
