I got my ass in trouble again
Same old ball, same old chain
I've got no manners and it ain't okay
Every night I wind up in jail
In jail
In jail

My life is a shameless burning flame
Livin' by the good book ain't my game
I get my kix in another way
Fuelled by liquid energy

I don't care anyway
So beware, and obey
I'm your hazard, I'm the lord of disarray

Break it off
When they're coming down the line
It can't go wrong
It's the same old narrow road that we all know

They say I'm one big tradegy
Every move I take is a felony
All they care about is why
I don't wanna please sucha hostile crowd

I don't care anyway
So beware, and obey
I'm your hazard, I'm the lord of disarray

Break it off
When they're coming down the line
It can't go wrong
It's the same old narrow road that we all know

You're the best man in the world, you don't belong
Born to bring alive this buried song
For so long
I'm being out of control
Walkin' along with my fist in the air now

Break it off while they're coming down the line
Then it can't go wrong
Break it off while they're coming down the line
No they can't go on

I'm a rebel
I'm a hazard
I'm a bastard
I'm a liar full of shit
I'm a cunt
I'm a fucker
I'm yer lover
I'm a loser and abuser
I'm an asskickin'
Dirtiest of all fukkers walking on yer face
I'm your muthafukkin reeeeeeeeetard

For so long
I'm being out of control
Walkin' along with my fist in the air now
