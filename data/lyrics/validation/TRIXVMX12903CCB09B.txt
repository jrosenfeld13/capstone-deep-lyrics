I don't want to hear it, there's nothing left to talk about
Get along, get along, get out
Get along, get along, get out of here

Well I give and you take, I think I made one big mistake
Now get along, get along, get out
Get along, get along, get out of here
Get along, get along, get out
Get along, get along, get out of here

Because I've put up with you for too long
I thought I could stick with you but I was wrong

Well I might be thick skinned, but I find your presence sickening
Now get along, get along, get out
Get along, get along, get out of here
Get along, get along, get out
Get along, get along, get out of here

Because I've put up with you for too long
I thought I could stick with you but I was wrong

And there's nothing left I want to say
There's nothing left I want to say
There's nothing left I want to say
There's nothing left I want to say

Except I've put up with you for too long
I thought I could stick with you but I was wrong

And there's nothing left I want to say
There's nothing left I want to say
There's nothing left I want to say
There's nothing left I want to say
