My mind is wide asleep
My conscience keep awake
The promises I deep
Are not the ones I make
I count the costant causes
I lost count of regrets
A surplus of good intentions don't
Provide me with content
All I want is just a little content

I choose the beaten path

I've been to where it leads
Why I keep coming back
A mistery to me
I found what I've been seeking
It's too late for me to care
My inspiration's leaking
From a hole I can't repair
Maybe I just don't want it repaired
