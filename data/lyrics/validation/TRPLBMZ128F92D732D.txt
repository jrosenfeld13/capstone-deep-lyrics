You and I are are two of a kind
Two restless spirits of the same mind
We know the risks and yet we stay
We're brave or crazy or stubborn that way

You live your life
In the shadow of a whirlwind
It might just come back again
I'll hold on to you
You hold on to me
And we'll stand our ground on Tornado Alley

The old ones talk about the one in '43
It blew through town unexpectedly
A little girl was found cryin' down by the mill run
And to this day nobody knows where she came from

You live your life
In the shadow of a whirlwind
It might just come back again
I'll hold on to you
You hold on to me
And we'll stand our ground on Tornado Alley

Now everyone's got some story of narrow escape
Won by luck, fate or grace
You can run for cover, but you cannot hide
The only safe place is the one that you hold inside

It's a misfit, a wild card, it's living in your backyard
It hears no voice but its ownYou live your life
In the shadow of a whirlwind
It might just come back again
I'll hold on to you
You hold on to me
And we'll stand our ground on Tornado Alley
There's just some things you just can't tame
Some mysteries you'll never call by name
