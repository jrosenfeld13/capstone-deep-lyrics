The More That I Know

OOwoo

Time passes and I wonder why
Some will live while others die
Sadness seems a lullaby
To love

[...] with swollen eyes
While mothers weep and father try
To disguise the precious life
Is gone for good

Come for the good of you and me
For freedom, peace and security
And liberty is only free to be afraid

Afraid of the news in the morning post
Someone elses holy ghost
Becoming what I fear the most
What can be done

The more that I know
Where ever I go
I wanne be close to you
The moment you sing
The more that that I bring
That I can be close to you
The more that I know
The more that I know

Walking through the afternoon
Listening to the month of june is
Sunlight turns to cooler moon and
Cricket songs

Songs that speak of times forgotten
Rhymes of rotten fruit
Returning to the earth
The breath of life that she once gave

Gave to give and take away
Everytime I learn a name
My worries down upon the shoulders
Of the whispering wind

Wind that touches everything
And everything it touches sings and dances
Chances seem to fade and reappear

The more that I know
Where ever I go
I wanne be close to you
The moment you sing
The more that that I bring
That I can be close to you

Why must the innocence suffer so
From when this evil arrives
Who is this [...] ?
[...] disguise
Maybe god and the devil are one
Just like the earth and the sky
Maybe I'm living too close to the sun
Maybe it has all been lies
It has all been lies

The more that I know
Where ever I go
I wanna be close to you
The moment you sing
The more that I bring
That I can be close to you
I can be I can be I can be
Close
The more that I know
