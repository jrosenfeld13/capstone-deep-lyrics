"Guy got out of prison right. He started uh... he started doing uh... he started doing an order of things you know... putting things in order. The spirit, atmosphere, water, trees, wildlife. And in putting this in order he came across some people who didn't want things put in order. That they wanted deception. And that they fed... on lies. That they sold and bought deciet, treachery... and that was they're business. They're business was war... they're business was... uhm... destroying other peoples lives... and they lived on the blood of children

Now this man who... tried to put some order into it... who was pushed off into a world war. Because you learn if you are a man of the mind and you think... long enough... you come to the same conclusions that... the only way to put order into the world... or anything as far as I'm concerned... you must take control of it. If you want to fix a car you have to have the car to fix it... if you want to fix the world you have to have control of the world to fix it. You can't by stop cutting the trees down in Georgia... and not stop cutting the trees down in Maine. You can't stop cutting the rainforest in Brazil... and not stop cutting the rainforest in Oregon state. You've got to stop cutting the trees down... period. Theres no slack... there's no inbetween... there's no controversy... there's no attitude towards it... you must stop cutting the trees down or we're all going to die

So... survival is the center in the vortex of justice, law... rules and regulations are made to... serve... mankind... to serve... survival. So to serve survival we must start... all... over. And take stock on... all the graveyards... look at why we've been fighting... all these years what have we beens struggling for... they'll always cover it up. They'll never let us know. Cover it up with all kinds of confusion... and never let the... children... know... whats really going on. They just buy and sell their blood... and... now its come to the generation of children whos like the man said... if you cut those trees... your children are not going to survive. And the man said...I'll...let them worry about that... I need the money now... but that... now... is dead... that now doesn't mean anything... that now is ran out of money... the reality of mankind is that we are... the children."
