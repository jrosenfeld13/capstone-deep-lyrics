Try hard
Try hard to care
Give a little laughter
And take a bigger share

You really don't need no
You really don't need sympathy
Forever in danger
Whatever we see

Know why
Know where and when
Give into the same cause
And talk I with the right men

You really don't need no
You really don't need sympathy
Forever in danger
Whatever we see

Take time
Time to compare
Live a newer lifestyle
And travel everywhere
