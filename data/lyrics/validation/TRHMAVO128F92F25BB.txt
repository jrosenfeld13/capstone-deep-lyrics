She looked amazing, a fresh cut green
I felt like the skater on the prep scene
Your big blue eyes, they knock the sides out

I think of heaven and I think of Hell
So I don't want to know you
I wanna know myself

These drinks can usually help me settle down
But they're not working and I've lost count
Of the times you sought a fight
Scraped my insides dry

I think of heaven and I think of hell
So I don't want to know you
I wanna know myself

Well, we're all but grown
And we're all but fine
Here's the last goodbye

Something that you want
Something that you need
It's not me

I think of heaven and I think of hell
So I don't want to know you
I wanna know myself
