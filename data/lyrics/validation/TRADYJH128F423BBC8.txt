Rebirth, what the fuck did you think you would see
A burnt out complexion staring at me
Rebirth of tragedy
You've been tripping, I've been growing
Deeper inside i feel like this in me
I've lived it, I've been it
The addict you've become
So what you got for me
Scraping the plate
I always knew you'd come
I always knew you'd fall on down
Collision of the blue lights the drag
Deeper comes the ring in my eyes
I think I'm seeping out of my skin
You know it's all a part of my head
Came down, you came down
Scraping the plate
Rebirth of tragedy
The mouths move wtih no voices
I smeared your face again
My face against the wall
I've been coming far too close
So what you got for me
Scraping the plate
I always knew you'd fall..
Down
