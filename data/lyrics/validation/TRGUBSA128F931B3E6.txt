Break down the walls of forever
Pull down hard on the lever
Let them know that you can turn the key
Though they try to hold us down
Turn it up, that chainsaw sound
I just love to see my parents flee

So you see that they're all going nowhere
Everybody's staring into space
Start the fire
Bring down the hammer
Start start the fire
Burning on forever

Now I see the storm clouds a coming
Can you feel the juice, it's a hummin'
Feed the power cables into me

Like a ship that's built for destruction
I'm a metal man of construction
And I'll fire my cannons, one by one

So you see that they're all going nowhere
Everybody's staring into space
Start the fire
Bring down the hammer
Start start the fire
Burning on forever

So you see that they're all going nowhere
Everybody's staring into space
Start the fire
Bring down the hammer
Start start the fire
Burning on forever
