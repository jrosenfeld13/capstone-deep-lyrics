[Verse 1]
I must look just like a fool here
In the middle of the road
Standing there in your rear view
And getting soaked to the bone
This land is flat as it is mean
A man can see for a hundred miles
So I'm still praying I might see
The glow of a brake light

[Chorus 1]
But your wheels just turn
Down the road ahead
If it hurts at all
You ain't showed it yet
I keep a looking for
The slightest sign that you might miss
What you left behind
I know there's nothing stopping you now
But I'd settle for a slowdown

[Verse 2]
I held on longer than I should
Believing you might change your mind
And those bright lights of Hollywood
Would fade in time

[Chorus 1]

But your wheels just turn
Down the road ahead
If it hurts at all
You ain't showed it yet
You're just a tiny dot on that horizon line
Come on tap those brakes
Baby just one time
I know there's nothing stopping you now
I'm not asking you to turn back around

[Outro]
I'd settle for a slowdown
Come on just slow down
I'd settle for a slow down
