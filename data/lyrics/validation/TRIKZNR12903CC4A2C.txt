I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
Time don't matter to me
'Cause I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
And there's no place I want to be

I got heartaches in my pocket
I got echoes in my head
And all that I keep hearing
Are the cruel, cruel things that you said

(Chorus)

I've got bruises on my memory
I've got tear stains on my hands
And in the mirror there's a vision
Of what used to be a man

(Chorus x2)

I'm a thousand miles from nowhere

I'm a thousand miles from nowhere
