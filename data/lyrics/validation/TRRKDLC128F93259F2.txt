I had some fun with the wildest of friends
They took me to the park and they threw me away in the fens
I wandered all night my hand held like a gun
I wandered 'til I found the light from the city of fun

And this "don't know mind" I give
To this horrid pilgrimage
We go marching by twos
And our horses run loose
And we can't go back
That's a natural fact
I see their silver faces
Following us in the sky

The town's people gathered around the square
To see the tightrope walker fight the bear
I am the bear with the dullest of claws
Made to fight this life on a rope of meaningless laws

And this "don't know mind" I give
To this life's pilgrimage
We go marching by twos
And our horses run loose
And we can't go back
That's a natural fact
I see their silver faces
Following us in the sky..
