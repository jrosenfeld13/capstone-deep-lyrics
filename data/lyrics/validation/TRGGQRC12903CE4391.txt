[Verse 1]
Bands with managers are going places
Bands with messy hair and smooth white faces

[Chorus]
But you don't believe when I say that it won't be alright
Alright
Alright

[Verse 2]
Vans with 15 passengers are rolling over
But I trust T. William Walsh and I'm not afraid to die

[Chorus]
But you don't believe when I say that it won't be alright
Alright
Alright

That it won't be alright
Alright
Alright

Cause it won't be alright
Alright
Alright
