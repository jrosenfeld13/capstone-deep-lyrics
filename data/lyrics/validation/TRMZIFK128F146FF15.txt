[Verse 1: Andy Sturmer]
I hope you remember me, I was your daddy once
Wearing the sailor cap, dirty nails
To you I'm just a picture on your mother's mantelpiece
Who chose to fight the good fight in time to fail

[Chorus]
Into battle
And in your shadow your daddy loves you still
Yes I do

[Verse 2: Andy Sturmer]
I never thought it'd be so hard to see you grow so fast
And turn into the man I used to be
But I hope you have more sense than I in matters such as these
Medals don't mean shit when a family is lost at sea, yeah

[Chorus]
Into battle
And in your shadow your daddy loves you still
Yes he does, yes he does

[Chorus]
Into battle
And in your shadow your daddy loves you still
Yes he does, yeah, yes he does

[Bridge]
I save every moment I've reached out and almost touched you
But they all fade away, must be a bad memory

[Harmonica solo]

[Chorus]
Into battle
And in your shadow your daddy loves you still
Yes he does, yes he does

[Chorus / Outro]
Into battle
And in your shadow your daddy loves you still
Yes he does, yeah, yes he does
Yes he does
