I'm always on your side
Every time you decide to hide
And i am careful with my steps
Never make a move i will regret

And i'm stuck on this crowded train
Carry the world..in pain
Yea
And i'm stuck on this crowded train
Going down,going down..down

I'm boxing shadows again
And ill always be somebody's friend
That's what scares me the most
Loving what will remain i suppose

And i'm stuck on this crowded train
Carry the world..in pain
Yea
And im stuck on this crowded train
Going down,going down..down

Ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh

If i forget your face
In between these busy days
What will become of me
What will become of me

And im stuck on this crowded train
Carry the world..in pain
Yea
And im stuck on this crowded train
Going down,going down..down
