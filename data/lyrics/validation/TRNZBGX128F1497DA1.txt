She worked in my postoffice
In my zip code, in my postal area
I don't think I should reveal her name
She'll remain anonymous, but we can call her Maria
I met her at university
She stared at me, I stared right back at her
We went out for a coffee or two
It all felt new, I can tell you
But she turned out to be a psychogirl

They all fall for me psychogirls
They are drawn to me, mysteriously
I don't know why
Just turn around now psychogirl
I can't be your guy, I can't dry your tears from your eyes

She sent me an SMS
But it felt more like an SOS, a cry for help
I know your life has been a mess
You cried yourself to sleep as a child
In your mommy's dress and your summerdress
But stop following me psychogirl
I have enough problems to deal with on my own
Just turn around now psychogirl
Your eyes are like knives, cutting into my bones
And if I'd be your psychologist, who would be the psychologist's psychologist?
If I'd be your psychologist, who would be the psychologist's psychologist?
If I'd be your psychologist, who would be the psychologist's psychologist?
