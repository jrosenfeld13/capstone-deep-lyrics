In the night, in the night
In the night, ooh Lord, in the night
In the wee, wee hour, dreamin' night and day

Now, all them girls got sex appeal
Oh, really get to rockin', it's a real good deal
In the night, hey, in the night
In the wee, wee hours dreamin' night and day

It gettin' noon and we gettin' real frisky
Where all of us start gettin' high on whiskey
In the night, oh Lord, in the night
In the wee, wee hour dreamin' night and day

In the night, in the night
In the night, ooh Lord, in the night
In the wee, wee hour dreamin' night and day
