This world may tell me not to turn it all away
It's the last thing I need
'Cause you're better anyway
Take it from me
I don't want these things that I'm giving up
I don't know
I just don't want to hear that I told you so
And you're not who I've heard about
But you're so what I need
Anmd you're not who I've figured out
It's just my first time falling
And I'm finishing all the way
And you're all that I will need
'Cause you're better anyway
You take it from me
Because I've seen things that you've taught about
I don't know
It's the last thing that I would ever have known
Sometimes I feel like I'm alive
And you love and you love and you do it so well
And I can't even come to convince myself
