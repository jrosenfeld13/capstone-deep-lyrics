[Intro]
Hey, hey, hey ,hey
Ohhh

[Verse 1]
Won't you come see about me?
I'll be alone, dancing you know it baby
Tell me your troubles and doubts
Giving me everything inside and out and
Love's strange so real in the dark
Think of the tender things that we were working on
Slow change may pull us apart
When the light gets into your heart, baby

[Chorus]
Don't You Forget About Me
Don't Don't Don't Don't
Don't You Forget About Me

[Verse 2]
Will you stand above me? (above me)
Look my way, never love me (love me)
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling
Down, down, down
Will you recognize me? (recognize me)
Call my name or walk on by (walk on by)
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling
Down, down, down, down

[Bridge]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Ohhhh

[Verse 3]
Don't you try to pretend
It's my feeling we'll win in the end
I won't harm you or touch your defenses
Vanity and security
Don't you forget about me
I'll be alone, dancing you know it baby
Going to take you apart
I'll put us back together at heart, baby

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
As you walk on by
Will you call my name?
I Will walk away
Or will you walk away? (Will you walk away)
Will you walk on by? (Will you walk on by)
Come on call my name (Call my name)
Will you call my name?

[Outro]
1..2.. , 1..2..3..go!!
La la la la la
La la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
Ohhh
Will You walk away
