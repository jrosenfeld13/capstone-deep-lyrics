[Verse 1]
Can't you see, that I'm sick of this
Chances are, you're oblivious
To how I feel, sitting on your throne
And I'm sure that I'm not alone... not alone... not alone

[Chorus]
Tell me please
Who the fuck did you want me to be
Was it something that I couldn't see
Never knew this would be so political
And please
I'm still wearing this miserable skin
And it's starting to tear from within
But it's obvious that doesn't bother you
So Please

[Verse 2]
I didn't think, that you'd sell me out
Now I know, what you're all about
You might feel, in control of things
But you're not, holding all the strings... all the strings... all the strings

[Chorus]
Tell me please
Who the fuck did you want me to be
Was it something that I couldn't see
Never knew this would be so political
And please
I'm still wearing this miserable skin
And it's starting to tear from within
But it's obvious that doesn't matter to you

[Bridge]
I've swallowed all your answers
I've swallowed all my pride
You've used up all your chances
Can't keep this all inside

[Chorus]
Tell me please
Who the fuck did you want me to be
Was it something that I couldn't see
Never knew this would be so political
And please
I'm still wearing this miserable skin
And it's starting to tear from within
But it's obvious that doesn't bother you

[Verse 3]
So please
Don't keep telling me that it's OK
I don't buy all the shit that you say
And quite honestly I'm fucking sick of it
So please
If I cut off this nose from my face
Then I wouldn't feel so out of place
But it still wouldn't be quite enough for you
So please
