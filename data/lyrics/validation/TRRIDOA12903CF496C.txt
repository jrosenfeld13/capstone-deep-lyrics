Well, it looks like he's doin' what I didn't do
Givin' you love and money too, it's over
Where do I go from here
Well, I appreciate the nice goodbye
Not even a letter so that I
Could fool myself into thinkin' that you really cared
I tried to give you everything you wanted
But it looks like I got burried by the flame I started

Money can't buy the love we had
You can't do a thing for a love gone bad
But it cost me everything that I ever had
And even money can't buy back the love we had

Now there's nobody left for me to blame
If I could do it over I'd do it the same
I gave you my very best
You said you'd love me through thick and thin
But when one heart lies the other can't win for losin'
Where do I go from here

Money can't buy the love we had
You can't do a thing for a love gone bad
But it cost me everything that I ever had
And even money can't buy back the love we had

Even money can't buy back the love we had
