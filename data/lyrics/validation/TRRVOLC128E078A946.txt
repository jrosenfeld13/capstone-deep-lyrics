Ride into the sun with me
And give it all away for free
Ride into the sun with me
And I'll show you all there is to see

We could cross a million miles
And make it through the open wide
And if it was the end of time
You could make it as a friend of mine

You could make it as a friend of mine
And while we travel trough the open wide
We could forget all that we've left behind

You could do it as a friend for life
And if we make it through a thousand skies
Then we could forget all that we've left behind

As we ride into a newborn sun
As we ride into a newborn sun
