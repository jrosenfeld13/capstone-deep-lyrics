Mmm, baby
When my way was dark and weary
Into my life, you came
You brought me the kind of loving, baby
That words could never, never explain

Oh, your sweet conversation
I began to see the light
We got the kind of relation
That's what makes everything all right

And that's what keeps me hanging on
Oh, baby, without your loving, I can't go on
Cause it keeps me hanging on
Oh, baby, without your loving, I can't go on

Mmm, baby
I don't know why life has to be this way

I remember when I was feeling down and out
Had no one to sit down and talk to me
I rush over to the telephone, baby
I knew you would be waiting patiently

Oh, your sweet conversation
I know you would comfort me
And give no hesitation
With me is where you will be

And that's what keeps me hanging on
Oh, baby, without your loving, I can't go on
Cause it keeps me hanging on
Oh, baby, without your loving, I can't go on

Now, baby, please
Sit down and let me talk to you
Don't do it, don't do T.D. like this, baby
I love you

And your love, your love
Your love, your sweet love

It keeps me hanging on
Oh, baby, without your loving, I can't go on
Cause it keeps me hanging on
Oh, baby, without your loving, I can't go on

Now, baby, I know I told you this
Many, many, many times before
But I'm-a tell you again
I love you, I need you

Mama, mama, mama, mama
Please listen to me...
