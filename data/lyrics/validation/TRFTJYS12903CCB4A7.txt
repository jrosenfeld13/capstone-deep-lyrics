If I could only turn back time
To the days when you were mine
I'd wrap you up with these two arms
And never let you go

I'd say the things I didn't say
The words that might have made you stay
I'd build my world around you, not me

I was always somewhere else
Thinkin' only of myself
Livin' just to chase a dream
A dream that was a doubt

I should've seen the warnin' signs
I never paid 'em any mind
Everybody saw it comin', not me

I kept reachin' for the stars and shootin' for the moon
When all along I had them in my hand
Little did I know how fast my world could slip away
It took losin' you for me to understand

That all you ever wanted was
Just to be a step above
All the things that stood between
The love we should have had

I can't say that I blame you now
For holdin' on to what you've found
I guess I'm why you're with him now
I guess I'm why you're with him, not me
