Two old friends of mine
I saw them only yesterday
They where there but I
Got the feeling they had gone away
Gone away from each other
But I was alone killing time
A stranger in the silence of their company

Two old friends of mine
Is this all life has left of you?
Who took the laughter, the times?
We said what we were gonna do
When we were grown and ready
To take on the world with a song
And now the tune is one
You cant remember

Who lost the reason for being together?
Who says the money wont go round?
Once it was love
And well live on a shoestring
But they dont give no mortgage
On a castle in the air

Two old friends of mine
A dripping tap
And a broken old chair
And if I read between the lines
Someones lonely, someone doesnt care
If its all gone by tomorrow
For tomorrows been and gone
Like a bird that has no home
