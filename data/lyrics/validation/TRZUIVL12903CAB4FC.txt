Standing in the corner
You've closed my mind
Your soul is dead
And your heart is blind...
Ears closed for reason and eyes turned away

Your blood is boiling inside of me
Time to be what I meant to be
You will to set me free
I'm falling, I'm searching
Your wind is carrying me in the sky
I feel your love and I just cry
Rain is pouring all over you
I am your sea, I am your sky

Your dream of perfection
Becomes my reality...
The price for posession was so low
How could I disagree...
Speaking of roses, yet breathing decay

Your blood is boiling inside of me
Time to be what I meant to be
You will to set me free
I'm falling, I'm searching
Your wind is carrying me in the sky
I feel your love and I just cry
Rain is pouring all over you
I am your sea, I am your sky
