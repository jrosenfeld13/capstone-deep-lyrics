Come sta, la luna, come sta
Come sta, la luna, come sta

I am not fighting, but I'm the night
I am not dying and I'm not hurt
I am the right or the wrong, your hope
I am the dancer on the tender road

I am the water and how I can flow

I have ambition to that
I'm not falling you know
I sound like singing the flow
I am the dancer on the tender road

Come sta, la luna
And why don't you call me sta?
Flowing over Babaluma
Become your friend
You can do it alone
And you don't have to pay
And if you don't free your window
There is nothing to shame

But I don't play easy
It's secret, the truth
I was fading in water
There is nothing but you
You can look through the wall
You just smile for sure
She comes in white flowers
And there's no way to go

Come sta, la luna, come sta
Come sta, la luna, come sta

It's never heard
Speak through the voice of the water
Stretch the curse before
While you can think and be different
The foe of your brothers
Be the king of the rain
While youll be playing'
Full from the strain pool

Come sta, la luna
And why don't you call me sta?
Flowing over Babaluma
Become your friend
You can do it while you run
Play alone in the light
And you freeze so gently
There is my own into matter

La, la, la luna
La, la, la luna, na, na
Flowing over Babaluma
Become your friend

Come sta
