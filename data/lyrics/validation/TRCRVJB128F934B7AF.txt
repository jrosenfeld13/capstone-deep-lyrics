Follow the way til' you reach your dreams
You keep on movin'
Never give up the belief
Let the good times roll
You know
Stay true to yourself anytime
And you will get the dream
You've always reached for
Take all your chances, don't give up
Never let a good thing slip away

Don't stop believing
Stand for what you believe
Don't stop believing

You better listen to your inner voice
Don't ever look back
Never say your fate is sealed
You've got it in your hands
You know
Let it out and live your dreams
And you will get the things you always wanted
Believe in yourself, break the chains
Never fight the fire in your soul
