People sing about this world they hate
But I would live forever, my life's great

Although at times my life is very strange
Nothing will remain it will all change

But people who are dead and are no more
Can look ahead and see what we're in for
They've seen the ways the means
The times we've tried
Before they could have helped
They've gone and died

This world will never suit every man
You go out and do the best you can

They all know what the future holds in store
But we'll never know until we're no more
