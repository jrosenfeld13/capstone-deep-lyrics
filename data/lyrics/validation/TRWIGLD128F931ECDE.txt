Im, wasting my time
Telling you why ive been so frustrated
You, you always knew, i was the end
Now, now i must say
Its in the way, ive been tempted baby
You, you always knew i would bend
I can't deny
The reason why
You got my cryin baby
Im fooling no one but myself
Now that you're gone
Am im alone
I found the answer baby
Ill keep my anguish to myself
Im angled up
Woven in knots
That you're spinning baby
You, you spun the web
Where i await
When we are alon
I always know that my mind is made up
Biding my time, risking my fate
