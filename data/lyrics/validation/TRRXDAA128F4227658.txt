Nothing's Going to Happen
Maybe all the aunts in the world
Will sip sweetly
At their cups of tea
And almost say one word
Of anything but what they've learnt
From all the uncles
Who raise horses laughs
And hopeful stiff pricks in the general direction
Of anywhere but home

Nothing's Going to Happen(x2)

Maybe all the children in small rooms
Will fall silent
At a wall or window
And forget to breathe
For just one minute
Because of some beauty
That has not been altered, damned or pointed out
By the clumsy dark oafs that train them

Nothing's Going to Happen (x2)

Then again
All the time
Every minute
Neverending
Unrelenting
All around us
Without pausing
Endless endless
All pervading
Movement motion
This way that way
Ticktock
Freefall
Love love kiss kiss
Me me do be
Is
