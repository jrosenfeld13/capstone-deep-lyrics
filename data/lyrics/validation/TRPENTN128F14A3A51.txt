When I'm walking hand in hand with you
I've got my yellow parasol, rivits colored blue
Shiny patent leather shoes, brand new
Nothing but my Sunday best for you
Oh its such a pleasure
I can hardly speak
Each day is a treasure
Its Sunday every day of the week
I will give you all of my love, so true
Nothing but my Sunday best will do
Nothing but my Sunday best for you
Oh its such a pleasure
I can hardly speak
Each day is treasure
Its Sunday every day of the week
I will give you all of my love, so true
Nothing but my Sunday best will do
Nothing but my Sunday best for you
