In the town of Louisville
Lived a man they call Big Bad Bill
I want to tell ya, he sure was tough
He certainly did strut their stuff

He had folks scared to death
When he walked by they held their breath
He was a fighting man, sure enough

Now Bill took himself a wife, he has to lead a different life
Big Bad Bill is Sweet William now

Married life has changed him some how
He's a man that they all used to fear
Now the people call him sweet papa Willie dear
Stronger than Samson I declare
'Till a hot head mama bobbed his hair

Big Bad Bill don't fight anymore
He wash his dishes and he mobs up the floor
He used to spend his evenings looking for a fight
Now he's got to see his mama every night
Big Bad Bill is Sweet William now

Big Bad Bill don't fight anymore
He wash his dishes and he mobs up the floor
He used to spend his evenings looking for a fight
Now he's got to see his mama every night
Big Bad Bill is Sweet William now
