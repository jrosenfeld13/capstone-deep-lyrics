I found the love but it didn't last
Wonderful days belong to the past
I don't know where I stand, what I'm to do
I try to forget and I found someone new

So I prayed on my knees to the heaven above
Send me somebody, please, someone to love
Led them into my story, give me your hand
Don't let me down with a heart to be damned

I found the love but it didn't last
Wonderful days belong to the past
I don't know where I stand, what I'm to do
I try to forget and I found someone new

So I prayed on my knees to the heaven above
Send me somebody, please, someone to love
Led them into my story, give me your hand
Don't let me down with a heart to be damned

(Here we go again!)
(Here we go again)

I found the love but it didn't last
Wonderful days belong to the past
I don't know where I stand, what I'm to do
I try to forget and I found someone new

So I prayed on my knees to the heaven above
Send me somebody, please, someone to love
Led them into my story, give me your hand
Don't let me down with a heart to be damned
