Album : For God's Sake Give More Power To The People (1971)

There's something that I want to give you

I'm gonna give you a five pound box of love
With a million dollar bill on top (Million dollar bill on top)
Diamonds on every corner
And a big black pearl for a lock

Use my heart for a key
I want to pay you back (I want to pay you back)
I want to pay you back for loving me
Pay you back for loving me

Gonna give you a cloud of love to sleep on (I want to pay you back)
A determined man to rely on
Love around every corner (I want to pay you back)
Or wherever you might be

Hold you tight, but tenderly (Hold you tight but tender)
I want to pay you back (I want to pay you back)
I want to pay you back for loving me, me, me, me

What's the use in denying it, baby
What's the use in us fighting it, baby
What's the use in turning away
When we could be happy each and every day, day, day, day

I want to pay you back(7x)

Oh, I see heaven when we look into the mirror
And an angel when you're asleep
Bright sunshine in the morning (Bright sunshine)
Though it may be raining in the street

And now I'm gonna even the score
I want to pay you back (I want to pay you back)
I want to pay you back for loving me
Pay you back for loving me

I want to pay you back
I want to pay you back for loving me
I want to pay you back
I want to pay you back for loving me, me

I want to pay you back (I want to pay you back)
I want to pay you back for loving me
I want to pay you back (I want to pay you back)
I want to pay you back for loving me, me

I want to pay you back (I want to pay you back)
I want to pay you back for loving me
I want to pay you back (I want to pay you back)
I want to pay you back for loving me, me, me, me

I want to pay you back (I-I want to pay you back) (8x)
I want to pay you back
