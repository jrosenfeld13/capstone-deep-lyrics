The Way They look at you is wrong
They was they don't understand
It's not right to judge you now but
You'll get used to this somehow

Disconnect the leash
It won't be long until you play the game
And decide if you belong on your own

You're not like them
Your mind is opened
Not all they ask of you
Is what you know to be truth
To see beyond what they expect
To live without any regrets
On you own

Did I force this onto you?
Is this a curse or a gift?
To see beyond what they expect
To live without any regrets
