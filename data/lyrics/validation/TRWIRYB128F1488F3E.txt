Thunder and lightning down on the beach

Me and my boyfriend got five cents each
Got to learn to keep moving on

Got to learn to keep grooving on
Got to learn to keep moving on

Got to learn to keep grooving on

Red wine and whisky all the time
We had a lot of money but we blew it down the line
We'd love to take you out tonight but we haven't got a dime
Red wine and whisky all the time - all the time

We used to ride in style in our rented car
Now all we do is hand out down at the bar
Got to learn to keep moving on

Got to learn to keep grooving on
Got to learn to keep moving on

Got to learn to keep grooving on

Red wine and whisky
All the time. . . 
Red wine and whisky
