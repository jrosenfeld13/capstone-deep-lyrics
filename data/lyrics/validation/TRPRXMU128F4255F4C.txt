It's Russian roulette with no luck
You can kiss it good-bye there's no such thing as sympathy
When the disease is entering
At first glance your instinct says this stranger's a little dangerous
The cat was killed from curious thrills
Now Christ has left the manger

The taste is so divine
So divine
A chemical come alive
Come alive

Welcome to your vice
Good luck with life
Cause you can't, you can't, you can't kill me that easily

It's so nice to meet you
It's so nice to know you
Now that your guards down let me show you
Superior rights from initial highs have now come back to haunt you
Your craving's beg the strangers hands for a taste that's so familiar

The taste is so divine
So divine
A chemical come alive
Come alive

Welcome to your vice
Good luck with life
Cause you can't, you can't, you can't kill me that easily
What will you decide when you're out of time?
Cause you can't, you can't, you can't kill me that easily

The battle you picked was so one sided
Now depending on me the one you invited
Beg, plead, scream
For redemption, for forgiveness
Beg, plead, scream
Sorry I'm not listening

Welcome to your vice
Good luck with life
Cause you can't, you can't, you can't kill me that easily
What will you decide when you're out of time?
Cause you can't, you can't, you can't kill me that easily
