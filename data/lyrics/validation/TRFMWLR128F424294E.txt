Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike
He's down on his luck
It's tough, so tough
Gina works the diner all day
Working for her man, she brings home her pay
For love, for love

She says we've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot
For love, we'll give it a shot

Whooah, we're half way there
Whooah, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Whooah, livin' on a prayer

Whooah, we're half way there
Whooah, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Whooah, livin' on a prayer

Tommy's got his six string in hock
Now he's holding in
What he used to make it talk
So tough, it's tough
Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night
Tommy whispers
Baby it's okay, someday

We've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot
For love, we'll give it a shot

Whooah, we're half way there
Whooah, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Whooah, livin' on a prayer

Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Whooah, livin' on a prayer

Livin' on a prayer

We've got to hold on ready or not
You live for the fight when it's all that you've got

Whooah, we're half way there
Whooah, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Whooah, livin' on a prayer
