Your debt's escalating
Whisper no regrets
Run your mouth in circles
You're chewing, chewing the flesh

Your talk is cheap and it's going nowhere
Think you're out changing the world
Choking on each word you spit

Those basement dwelling days are so far from me
Moving mountains in your head
Buying into all that's said

Dive, sink, drown
Caught up in this lie
Dive, sink, drown
Caught up in this life outside your own

Your talk is cheap and it's going nowhere
Think you're out changing the world
Choking on each word you spit

Convinced of your false visions
You're the sucker
KEEP TALKING
Keep talking away
KEEP TALKING

Cashing in all your petty words
It's so far from me
Living like you're dead
