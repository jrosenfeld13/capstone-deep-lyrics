In a little while people and places
Will be so far behind out of my body
In a little while I will play aces
And raise my glass in an act of defiance
But until then I'll scream until I'm hollow
I'll carve it in my skin, I save it for tomorrow
I'm gonna bang my drum
I'm gonna make it come, yeah
I'm gonna bring it on
It's a heart attack, a heart attack
I'm bringing it, bringing it back
I'm bringing it back to me
In a little while it will be perfect
I'll have a perfect style, soon you will see
Not a cloud in sight, no cumulus nimbus
Just ninety three percent degrees humidity
But until then I'll scream until I'm hollow
I'll carve it in my skin, I save it for tomorrow
I'm gonna bang my drum
I'm gonna make it come, yeah
I'm gonna bring it on
It's a heart attack a heart attack
I'm bringing it, bringing it back
I'm bringing it back
I'm gonna bring it on in just a little while
I'll make the good things come
I'm gonna bang my drum
I'm gonna make it come, yeah
I'm gonna bring it on
It's a heart attack, a heart attack
I'm bringing it, bringing it back
I'm bringing it back
I'm gonna bang my drum
I'm gonna make it come, yeah
I'm gonna bring it on
It's a heart attack, a heart attack
I'm bringing it, bringing it back
I'm bringing it back to me
To me, to me
I'm out of my body
I'm out of my body
I'm out of my body
I'm out of my body
