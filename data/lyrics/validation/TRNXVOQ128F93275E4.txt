Evil thoughts & blue minds
Leave the cynics all far behind
If life is good, well, then it's OK
Don't try to fix a thing that isn't broke
Hiding in the basement
Try to block my mind
How can people still believe
In a world that isn't kind?
Maybe I don't fit too well
But don't throw it in my face........

You know me, I'm a walking inconsistency
I'm so hard to please
I look twice at anything that's placed in front of me
That's why it's hard to understand
How you can take me the way I am
And not even change my attitude
But I'll try to change, if you want me to

De Diva, De Diva in denial;
Watch me going down in style

You know me, well, at least you're spending time with me
I seem so carefree
But I'm chained, restrained, by all those memories
Some say that I'm swell at first
Then one day they turn around & curse
And treat me like I don't belong
But somehow, that just made me strong
And I push too hard, I push too soon
And I live it out on a paper moon
Then you take me in, when I've had enough
Ain't that what they call love?

De Diva, De Diva in denial;
Watch me going down in style

That's why it's hard to understand
Why you can take me the way I am
And not even change my attitude
But I'll try to change, if you want me to
And I push too hard, I push too soon
And I live it out on a paper moon
Will you take me in, when I've had enough
Ain't that what they call love?
