Babe just as sure as a blackbird, flies in the skies above
Bet your life ain't worth living babe, if you ain't with the one you love
My baby tried to do me, like the tadpole do the trout
That's getting me out in the deep water baby, then she walks on out
Mmm good Lordy, send me an angel down
Son I can't spare you no angel, but I'll send you a teasing brown
I don't think, no woman in this whole round world do right
If they be good all day, they will do wrong at night
Baby you know it may be my last time, rider you sure don't know
It may be my last time baby, knocking on your door
