[Verse 1]
At first flash of Eden
We race down to the sea
Standing there on freedom's shore

[Chorus 1]
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun

[Chorus 2]
Can you feel it
Now that Spring has come
That it's time to live in the scattered sun

[Bridge]
Waiting for the sun
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Waiting for you to come along
Waiting for you to hear my song
Waiting for you to come along
Waiting for you to tell me what went wrong
This is the strangest life I've ever known

[Chorus 2]
Can you feel it
Now that Spring has come
That it's time to live in the scattered sun

[Chorus 1]
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun
