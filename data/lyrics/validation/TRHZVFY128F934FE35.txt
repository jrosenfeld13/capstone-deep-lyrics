[Producer(s): Charlemagne]
[Sample (Melody): Erykah Badu - On & On]

[Verse 1: A-Butta]
Ayyo, I had the illest
Dream last night that I was smoking an L.  My eyes
Was lit up, but no one could tell.  Yo, on the low
I was open as hell.  I hear a voice in my ear, saying
A, yeah, what should I do?  Im conversating in
The rear, getting high with the crew, checking this trick that
I knew, sitting down on the couch, shes chilling out.  Im in
The house, plus Im bout to stick my dick in her mouth
(No question, no doubt) Yo, I said
Youre cold, want to be with meits true
If you didnt, then I wouldnt be next to you
Baby girl, uh, youre looking all sexual
Its the truth, boo.  I want to have sex with you.  Were raw-
-dogging it up in the piece, fucking to beats made
By Charlemagne, under the sheetswhat a relief.  Shorty
Smiles, sucking me while shes puffing a leaf
Sweet thing, bust a nut in your cheeks.  Blunted for weeks, cant
Get enough of these freaks, weed, liquor, and rhymes
Puffing a nickel while Im fucking a dime some of the time
Secondhand smoke is better than sex, but, just then, I woke
Upwhat?!?  Nevertheless, we keep it moving, yall

Ayyo
Get lifted off the secondhand smokeI quote
(Oh my, my, my) Ayyo
Get lifted off the secondhand smokeI quote
(Im feeling high)

[Verse 2: L-Swift]
Ayyo
I woke up in the morning, saw a Dutchy on the dresser
Honey asking, Why you dont want to touch me?  I undressed her
Finessed her the Natural Elements way
If I dont got my Dutchy, Ima have a celibate day
Felting away like it was mandatory.  Im in a cypher
With my niggas, and a cloud of smoke stand before me, so hand
A 40 to the right and pass the trees on the left
Shorty Im tonguing smell the weed on my breath.  She tied me to the bed
And squeezed on my chest.  I guess the second hand is in her
So call him up and tell her man, Forget her, stand or deliver
No telegrams or pictures.  L in my hand with liquor
Elements plans is bigger.  Cant stand a nigga
Who be hogging the smokes.  If you a candidate, were locking
The votes.  Even stay high when my pockets is broke.  How could
I [?]?  Too many trips to be made.  Come to a show, you [?]
Like we see a spliff on a stage.  Ill blaze it up so yall could

[Verse 3: Mr. Voodoo]
Uh, I was grown in
Exotic lands where waters hitting slow, tropical plant
Pure as the dripping snow, hitting hoes, or, rather, when hoes
Hit me, theyre hooked-over.  See, I produce like your grocer
Lyrics is coka.  Dont fuck with me if you aint a chain-smoker
Bitches is strongerfull-fledged player chop game cause
My tongues a single-edge razor, cost of sexual favors
Niggas scream, Flavors, got the trees in, trying be in
Eden.  Every corner, I be there.  See here, if crack
Kills, Ima craft krills with West Indian Archie math
Skills til I feel the blue top cap spills
Even if I have to clap wheels, let the record stand
I got the whole city high off the secondhand
