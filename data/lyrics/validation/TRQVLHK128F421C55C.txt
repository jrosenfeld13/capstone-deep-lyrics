In the dawning hour, break of day
Strikes an old church tower, a mile away
We'll be mining tears from a stone

From a stone
From a stone
Tears from a stone, yeah

As the morning daylight enters here
We'll be adding curses to a prayer
Taking notes down as we go along
Yeah, we'll be mining tears from a stone

From a stone
From a stone
Tears from a stone

You shoot the blame out like a star
That never asked us who we are
You shoot a wish out to the sky
It never asked us where we hide
Yeah, where we hide

From a stone
Tears from a stone
Tears from a stone
