That's life, that's what all the people say
Your riding high in April, shot down in May
But I know I'm gonna change that tune
When I'm back on top, back on top in June
I said that's life, and as funny as it may seem
Some people get their kicks stomping on a dream
But I don't let it, let it get me down
'Cause this fine old world it keep spining round

I've been a puppet, a pauper
A pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down
Over and out, I know a thing
Each time I find myself
Lying flat on my face
Well I pick myself up
And get back in the race

That's life (that's life)
I tell ya, I can't deny it
I thought I cuting out
But my heart just ain't gonna buy it
And if I didn't think
It was worth one single trial
Well I'd jump right on that big bird
And I'd fly

I've been a puppet, a pauper
A pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
I've been up and down
Over and out, I know a thing
Each time I find myself
Laying flat on my face
Well I pick myself up again
And get back in the race

That's life (that's life)
That's life and woah, I can't deny it, no
I thought I quiting babe
But my heart just ain't gonna buy it
And if there nothing shaking, come this year
I'm gonna role myself up in a big ball
And die
My my
