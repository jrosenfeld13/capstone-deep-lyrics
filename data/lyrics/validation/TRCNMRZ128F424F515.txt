She was a captive of his crimes
Another passport to paradise
Oh, she was a child in disguise
Another daughter he would sacrifice, no

She never knew her father's name
Never knew her mother's face
Another orphan on the streets
Kidnapped without a trace

She never saw the midday sun
Only felt the midnight shame
He bought and sold her innocence
Like a pony on display

Her world went underground
Can anybody save her?
Another deal keeps going down

S.O.S., S.O.S. in America
Can anybody hear her?
S.O.S., S.O.S. in America

Mercy for the maidens
So desperate and so young
Their sexual transactions
All have left their souls undone

Their worlds went underground
Can anybody save them?
Another deal keeps going down

S.O.S., S.O.S. in America
Can anybody hear her?
S.O.S., S.O.S. in America
S.O.S., S.O.S
'Cause she's calling out for you
You know that she's in America

Her world went underground
Can anybody save her?
Another deal keeps going down

S.O.S., S.O.S. in America
Can anybody hear her?
S.O.S., S.O.S. in America
Can anybody hear her?
S.O.S., S.O.S
'Cause she's calling out for you
You know that she's in America

S.O.S. in America
Can anybody hear her?
S.O.S., S.O.S. in America
Can anybody hear her?
S.O.S., S.O.S
'Cause she's calling out for you
You know that she's in America
