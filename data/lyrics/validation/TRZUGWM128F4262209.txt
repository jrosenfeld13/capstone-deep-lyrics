I say a little dab'll do you come
And let me drop it to ya, yeah

You heard my prayers
When I was alone (shoop-shoo-wah)

Sentenced to have all your sweet warm lovin'

I'd have my freedom with
No joy only pain (shoop-shoo-wah)
Incarcerated in this prison of love (shoop-shoo-wah)
I'd be lost without you because
You mean so much
You and I sitting under a tree
I singing I love you and you love we
