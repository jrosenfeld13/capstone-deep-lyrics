Lully, lullay, thou little tiny child
By, by, lully, lullay, thou little tiny child
By, by, lully, lullay

O! Sisters too
How may we do
For to preserve this day
This pore yongling
For whom we do singe
"By, by, lully, lullay"?

Herod, the king
In his raging
Charged he hath this day
His men of might
In his owne sight
All yonge children to slay

That wo is me
Pore child for thee
And ever morne and may
For thy parting
Nether say nor sing
"By, by, lully, lullay"
