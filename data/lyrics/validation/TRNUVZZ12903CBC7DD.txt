Secret shapes are wandering like a ghost with silent wings
Through the night
In search of light
Laughing gnomes and demons are telling me that I'll go far
This ghostly night
In search of light

Walking to heaven with lust and hate
Walking to heaven to feel the fate
Oh what forces me so tough
To hurt the woman that I love

Secret shapes show the way to fame and cash
It's time to pay
This sinful night
In search of light
Obsession don't release my mind
I know this greed is my decline
This ghostly night
In search of light

Walking to heaven with lust and hate
Walking to heaven to feel the fate
Oh what forces me so tough
To hurt the woman that I love
