[Verse]
The lips that slip
Are the lips that press
And the lips that leak
Seem to know you best
I put bodies in motion
Keep this skin out in the open
Liars turn me on

[Pre- Chorus]
Bedspread Bandit since '89
You wear your heart on your sleeve
I threw mine to the sky

[Chorus]
Bounce, Bounce, Baby, Bounce back to me
You don't need this
Bounce, Bounce, Baby, Bounce back to me
You don't need this
This is it, call it quits with honesty
You don't need him
Every word is a curse let loose on me
Your mouth, it moves but fails to speak
And when you use your lips they better be on me

[Verse 2]
The lies that tied
Your tongue in knots
Are the words that grew
To hit my spots
So filthy, dialed desire
Swallowed pride but spit out fire
Liars turn me on

[Pre Chorus ]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Bounce, Bounce, Baby x4

[Verse 3 ]
So filthy, dialed desire
Swallowed pride but spit out fire
Liars turn me on

[Chorus]
