Well folks I am a very lucky fella
I uh am very blessed because I get to travel and make music with
Uh three of the best guys in the business, ladies and gentleman
Not only are they, not only are they fantastic musicians
But they're just great human beings above everything else
On the bass over here Mr. Aden Bubeck
In the back on the drums, Mr. Jeff Howell
And on the guitar over here Mr. Dale Clark, ladies and gentleman
Now this next song is about and old guy who does something very foolish
