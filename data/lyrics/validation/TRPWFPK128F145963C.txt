[Chorus]
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Because here's not here with me

[Verse]
Hey, window pane
Do you remember
How sweet it used to be?
When we were together
Everything was so grand
Now that we've parted
There's one sound that I just can't stand

[Chorus]
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Because here's not here with me

When we were together
Everything was so grand
Now that we've parted
There's one sound that I just can't stand
I can't stand the rain, can't stand the rain

[Chorus]
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Because here's not here with me

When we were together
Everything was so grand
Now that we've parted
There's one sound that I just can't stand

[Chorus]
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
It just keeps on holding me
Get off of my window
Because here's not here with me
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
