[Verse 1]
She was aware of her insecurities as she took the stage
She was convinced if she got up there that she'd be discovered someday
So she belted it
She hit the high notes fearlessly
Oh she melted them, as she brought them to their feet

[Chorus]
She was a big star at Banana Joe's bar where
She sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are it feels good in the hot spotlight
She was a big star

[Verse 2]
She made the local cable shows where the camera fell in love with her face
After a couple of weekends the groupies were crawling all over the place
She signed autographs like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt
And in the aftermath, that small time town was hers

[Verse 3]
She doesn't care anymore that her high school girlfriends cut her down
They only thought she entertains is where they are and where she is now
All her old neighbors swear their certain she slept her way to the top
She knows you don't get where you are going unless you got something they have not got

[Outro]
So she sings tonight to 20,000 plus and the young girls scream out loud
Man that could be us
She's a big star as she eats caviar just before she performs every night
She says if you work hard to get where you are it feels good in the hot spotlight
She's a big star
She's a big star
