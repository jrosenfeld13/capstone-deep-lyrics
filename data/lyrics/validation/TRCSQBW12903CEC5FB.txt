[Verse 1]
Blackbird sitting on an open gate
Cattle out walking the plains
West wind blowing waist-high wheat
Sideways in the rain
Bloodhounds spent, can't get no trail
There ain't no sign of man
Wanna get ourselves on the straight and the narrow
Gonna need a better plan

[Chorus 1]
Oh roll your sleeves up
Hold back the dam
Now fill these bags with sand
Every young boy, woman, and every man
Has got to lend a hand

[Verse 2]
It ain't no wives tale, it ain't no fable
Payback is coming around
The hourglass is sitting there on the table
Filled on both sides now
The work is potluck, grab a hatchet
Now wear any glove that fits
You can't take a punch, well you might as well quit
Won't matter how hard you hit

[Chorus 2]
Roll your sleeves up
Shovel the land
Rise up and learn how to stand
Now you're a toothless woman or a one-armed man
You too got to lend a hand

[Verse 3]
We're losing daylight, you've got to be swift
You ain't got brains, then you can lift
Now be an optimist, see the glass half full
You don't got to like what you've got in it
Now when your father gets home
Gonna turn on the lights
We're up to our throats in knives
Now his eyes will flash and his teeth will grind
He'll say: "You're on your own, look alive"
Suppose I quit you, my wayward tribe
Whatever would you do?
Now take me to Hades or take me to Memphis
Just don't take me for one of you

[Chorus 3]
Now roll your sleeves up
The fat lady sang
Now grab your buckets and cans
Come over the border
Your papers in order
You too got to lend a hand

[Chorus 1, Reprise]
Now roll your sleeves up
I'll hold back the dam
I'll fill these bags with sand
Every young boy, woman, every tired old man
You too got to lend a hand
