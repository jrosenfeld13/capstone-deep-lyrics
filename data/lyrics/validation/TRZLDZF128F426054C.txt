Alright!

A cold, cold darkness
And past confusion
Is quickly calling
Yeah, all of my illusions

Now won't somebody
Tell me what's wrong
Tell me what's wrong with me

From within
The magic madness
I could feel deep in my heart
A little bit of gladness

Now won't somebody
Tell me what's wrong
Tell me what's wrong with me

Won't somebody
Tell me what's wrong
I been searchin'
Searchin' so long
Oh, won't somebody
Oh, won't somebody
Tell me what's wrong with me

Alright!

Won't somebody
Tell me what's wrong
I been searchin'
Whoa so goddamn long
Oh, won't somebody
Oh, won't somebody
Tell me what's wrong with me

And then from out
Of a mystic dream
There came an angel
She spread her wings

Now don't nobody
Tell me what's wrong
Tell me what's wrong with me
