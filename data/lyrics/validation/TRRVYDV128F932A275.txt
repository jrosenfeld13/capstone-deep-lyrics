Captain says i'm going far
War games get me hard
My country will be proud
Of a man like me
Didn't you see the ads
It's the skills i need
Human target practice for fun
Doesn't matter if i kill someone
I need an authority figure
I can't control myself
I need some rules to live by
I need a babysitter 24 hours a day
I could use some discipline
