When I met that girl you know I think I lost my mind
She was hangin after class I didnt want to waste no time
Cool, calm, and collected I went up to talk to her
Before I even knew it I had got her name and number
I dont know how things go this way
But Im hoping that shell be mine someday
Cause you know what you do to me baby
Im breaking all the rules and going crazy
You know what you do to me baby
Im falling for you, so Im hoping that youll stay around
Every time I wake you know shes always on my mind
I cant help but wonder what shes thinking at the same time
All these thoughts and feeling yeah they really make me shake
Theres a reason for this love and Im hoping that its fate
We could walk hand in hand
I hoping that youll understand
You know Im only thinking of you
You got me running around in my head
Thinking of the things I said
You say you dont know, but I say its true
