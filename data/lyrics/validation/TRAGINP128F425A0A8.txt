[Intro]
Oooohhh yeahhhh
I would be your man, you would be my girl
I believe, I do

[Hook 1]
If there's any justice in the world
I would be your man
You would be my girl, oh yeah
If i found you first you know it's true
He would be alone
I would be with you

[Bridge 1]
When you decide, don't let me down
Coz there's nothing to be certain in my life
And you've seen a thousand times
There's not much justice in the world

[Hook 2]
If there's any justice in your heart
You love pity it changed
Ease it into heart
Oh no
Why don't you remember how it feels
Not to give a damn
For anyone but me

[Bridge 2]
I can't believe you'd be deceived
Changing memories from truth to fantasy
When there's nothing left but tears
And there's not much justice in the world

[Middle 8]
Just because he's wrapped around your finger
Don't fool yourself with dreams that might appear
If in time you'll stop and trust your feelings
The truth is out there somewhere
It's blowing in the wind

[Hook 1]
If there's any justice in the world
I would be your man
You would be my girl
Oh yeah
If I'd found you first you know its true
He would be alone
I would be with you

[Bridge 1]
If I should lose you girl you know
That there's not much justice in the world

[Outro]
If there's any justice in the world
You're gonna be my baby
You're gonna be my baby
You're gonna be my baby!
