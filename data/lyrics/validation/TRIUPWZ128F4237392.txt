My luck's pushed too far
Get wrecked in some bar
Well i've lost it
My foot's on a nail

The dark winter snows bright
Please stay here tonight
Well i'll cry my face
Straight through my pillow

Some things last forever
Why can't this last forever
Nothing lasts forever
I hope this lasts forever, oh

More sex
More goodbyes
I love you and I
Won't let myself let you go

Some things last forever
Why can't this last forever?
Nothing lasts forever
I hope this lasts forever, oh
