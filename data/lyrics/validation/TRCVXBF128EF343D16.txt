This is the story of a reoccuring dream
Some other images cut inbetween
Endlessly seeking for identitiy
Of what there is and what there seems to be
Do I am just what I recall
Do I own waht belongs to all
A sunken ship that carries jewelry and gold
I'd love to get it but the water is much to cold

I'm going down through a poke in my vein
I'm moving up to where i'm going insane
Caught in the middle for it's too high a stake
I'm popping out of my rebirthday cake
I'm shooting up through a whole in my head
See me falling through the safety net
No boundaries no strings attached
I am free so don't you mess with me

Sing a loud song
And draw a few lines
The world is a mess
And I feel fine
Tell a crude joke
About the sign of the times
Have faith and you can sleep with snakes

A sunken ship that carries jewelry and gold
I'd love to get it but the water is much to cold
Stuck in the middle I can barely move
I feel my feet are marching to the good groove
I hear my heart is pounding on the right spot
Hell i'm free so don't you mess with me

Sing a loud song
And draw a few lines
The world is a mess
And I feel fine
Tell a crude joke
About the sign of the times
Have faith and you can sleep with snakes
