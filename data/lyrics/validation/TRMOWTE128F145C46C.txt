How could you love someone like me?
What have I done for you?
All of the times Ie turned my back
Things I did not think through
But you still care for me in spite of what youe seen
You she'd your blood for me even though I do not deserve your grace
Youe shown your faithfulness
Please help me do the same
I am so thankful for my life
I could not ask for more
I don want to just take up space
Ie already wasted so much time
You she'd your blood for me even though I do not deserve your grace
Youe shown your faithfulness
Please help me do the same
