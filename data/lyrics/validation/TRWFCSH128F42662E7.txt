I watched her pack her worn out suitcase
Like so many times before
Her voice still echoes down the hallway
I wont be coming back no more
Five nights a week I kept her happy
We lived in perfect harmony
But our trouble starts on Friday
That feeling takes control of me
Its that Friday night feeling
That I cant seem to control
Pretty ladies and sweet music
Its down deep in my soul
And this feeling wont leave me
Till Sunday morning comes
Oh this Friday night feeling
It wont let me go home
I just stopped in to cash my paycheck
Thought I drink one then go home
Then I saw that good looking lady
Setting at the bar alone
Well she had that look of needing someone
Felt that feeling coming on strong
Oh this Friday night feeling
Just wont let me go home
