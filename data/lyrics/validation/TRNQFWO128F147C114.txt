Good Lord, just let me live 'til tomorrow
I'm gonna send you another prayer
This is taped
Yes, 'til tomorrow
This black man gonna send you another prayer
You know, sometimes I begin to wonder
What in the world am I doin' over here?
You don't love me no more, baby
And I can't see the reason why
You don't love me no more, baby
Po' Lightnin' can't see the reason why
You know, I never told you no story
If you don't understand that
And I never have told you a lie
Yeah, the birds was singin'
And the wind begin to blow
Yeah, the birds was singin'
You know, the wind begin to blow
You know when a pigeon joined in and went to singin'
I never heard such a sweet voice before
You know a pigeon mean more than one that fly in the air?
It can be a stool pigeon, you know that's, you know what that is?
One that sit on a stool and pimp to the law
That is a pigeon
I want everybody understand me so they know
I just done give up and I ain't gonna try
To live they life no more
No, no more
You know, I ain't gonna find no heaven here
Now, no place on earth I go
