[Intro]
1, 2, a-1, 2, 3, 4

[Verse 1]
Ten years old
Anything goes
All you ever knew was a bullshit phone
Now you're on the bells
You're yacking in the booths
But where you supposed to go?
Well, I just don't know, so...

[Chorus]
Get off the phone
There's nobody home
Get off the phone
'Cause I don't want you
'Cause I don't want you

[Verse 2]
What's that ringing sound?
Everything keeps going 'round and 'round
Calling everybody and their mother too
But don't call me 'cause I just left you, so...

[Chorus]
Get off the phone
There's nobody home
Get off the phone
'Cause I don't want you
'Cause I don't want you

[Verse 3]
You hung up on love when I called that night
You hung up on the bells at the ringside fights
You hung up on your heart
You hung up on the world
Now you hung yourself on the telephone pole, so...

[Chorus]
Get off the phone
There's nobody home
Get off the phone
'Cause I don't want you
'Cause I don't want you

[Bridge]
I don't care what you wear
You ain't gonna go nowhere

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Get off the phone
There's nobody home
Get off the phone
'Cause I don't want you
'Cause I don't want you

[Outro]
'Cause I don't want you
'Cause I don't want you
'Cause I don't want you
