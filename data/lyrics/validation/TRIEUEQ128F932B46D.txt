Gimme a break, a 2nd chance for heaven's sake
Director's cut, alternate take and I
Won't mess up any lines, you'll see
I want a happy end to this movie
I'm not a fan anymore of tragedy

Where I just walk away
I'll find someone else
And I'll tell myself
I'll remain content for all my life which
I can guess that, I'll contend that it won't be long

Our friends will say
That our film, while okay
Wasn't safe, was too strange, difficult to talk about

Lord knows I've found
Try to block the critics sound
Words from their throats turn to ghosts and hover round whispering

They say just walk away
Go find someone else
And then tell yourself
That you'll be content for all your life
Which I can guess that, I'll contend that it won't be long

Just walk away
I'll find someone else
And then I'll tell myself I'll remain content for all my life
Which I can tell, I can tell, I can tell
It's a shame
It's all wrong
I'll puzzle over the end all my life
Which I can guess that, and I'll contend that it won't be ling
No it won't be long
