[Verse 1]
They wanted me here just to show you my face
But when it comes to the crunch, I just hide in disgrace
You were calling me mad but I know you're the same
'Cause you gotta be seen to be playing the game
Yes, you gotta be seen to be playing the game
Yes, we gotta be seen to be playing the game

[Chorus]
It ain't gonna hurt now if you open up your eyes
You're making it worse now every time you criticize
I'm under your curse now, but I call it compromise
I thought that you were wise, but you were otherwise

[Verse 2]
A specimen like you I would love to obtain
I asked a tedious guy if he'd tell me your name
I'd love to impress you with a back somersault
I wanna take up your love, but it's locked in a vault
I wanna take up your love, but it's locked in a vault

[Chorus]
It ain't gonna hurt now if you open up your eyes
You're making it worse now every time you criticize
I'm under your curse now, but I call it compromise
I thought that you were wise, but you were otherwise

[Verse 3]
When I open my mouth, I'm so brutally honest
And I can't expect that kind of love from you
When you open your mouth, your teeth are beautifully polished
And I can't extract the pain you're going through
No, I can't explain the pain you're going through

[Pre-Chorus]
It ain't gonna hurt now if you open up your eyes
You're making it worse now every time you womanize
I'm under your curse now, but I call it compromise
I'm under your curse, oh, oh

[Chorus]
It ain't gonna hurt now if you open up your eyes
You're making it worse now every time you criticize
I'm under your curse now, but I call it compromise
I thought that you were wise, but you were otherwise
