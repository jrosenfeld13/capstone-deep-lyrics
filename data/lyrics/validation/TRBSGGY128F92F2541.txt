I was causing a riot down my local High St
I'm running away and getting chased by the police
They're getting closer, I can't get away
They got me, they nicked me, I'm going away

I was nicked in a riot
They got me, nicked me, I'm going away
I was in a riot against the people
Against the people I hate

In for a Riot

I was in a riot against the people I hate
You are nothing great
Why do you act that way
You know we're nothing at the end of the day

In for a Riot
Against the people I hate

They asked me the questions, I sat in my cell
I was in there for days, it was nothing but hell
They took me inside for half of one week
When I got out I shouted What a fucking cheat
