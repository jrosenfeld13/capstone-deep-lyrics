Love is not a place, to come and go as we please
It's a house we enter in, and then commit to never leave
So lock the door behind you, throw away the key
Well work it out together, let it bring us to our knees

Coro: Love is a shelter in a raging storm;
Love is a peace in a middle of a war, and if we try to leave may God send angels to guard the door
No, love is not a fight, but it's something worth fighting for

To some love is a word that they can fall into
But when theyre falling out, keeping their word is hard to do

Coro: Love is a shelter in a raging storm;
Love is peace in a middle of a war, but if we try to leave may God send angels to guard the door
No, love is not a fight, but is something worth fighting for

Ponte: Love will come to save us, if well only call
He will ask nothing from us, but demand we give our all

Coro: Love is a shelter in a raging storm;
Love is a peace in a middle of a war, and if we try to leave may God send angels to guard the door
No, love is not a fight, but is something worth fighting for
I will fight for you!

Would you fight for me?

Its worth fighting for
