[Verse 1]
Dinner at eight, that sounds fine
I suppose that means you'll turn up 'round nine
Bought a bunch of flowers, just for her
She says the burden's on the receiver
I opened the door and you walked in
The scent of wild jasmine
The room seemed to freeze in time
My regular table will be just fine

[Hook/Pre-Chorus]
Radiant and elegant, you might be
But your concentration is so go-lightly
Both of your eyes reflecting the moon
You really think you own the room

[Chorus]
So what game shall we play today?
How about the one where you don't get your way
But even if you do, that's okay
So what game shall we play today?
How about the one where you don't get your way
But even if you do, that's okay

[Verse 2]
Try to pick it up, reading the signs
It's turning out to be a real good time
And who'd have thought that entertainment
Lies in the winter of your discontent
Now, sit at the table, face to face
Queen takes pawn, check or checkmate
I feel your foot brush against my leg
I'm not that easily led

[Hook/Pre-Chorus]
You flutter your eyes and you toss your hair
I have to say that it is kind of unfair
Let me tell you baby now what's in store
You win the battle, but I'll win the war

[Chorus]
So what game shall we play today?
How about the one where you don't get your way
But even if you do, that's okay
So what game shall we play today?
How about the one where you don't get your way
But even if you do, that's okay

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3/Pre-Chorus]
This has been fun, I suppose
Although my feelings are all juxtaposed
But truth be told, I'm as fickle as hell
But gentlemen never kiss and tell

[Chorus/Outro]
So what game shall we play today?
How about the one where you don't get your way
But even if you do, that's okay
So what game shall we play today?
How about the one where you don't get your way
But even if you do, that's okay
