It's a pointless, small place on a map in outer space
Every second, everyday you're gone
I've got a job that I can't keep working on
Yeah

I think you are so anointed
That's why you get so disappointed
I swear you are so important
Nothing you do is pointless
Yeah

There is no modern mystery
No mystic chords of memory
There is no modern mystery
We're making up our history

Woah-oowoah, Woah-oowoah, Woah-oowoah, Woah-oowoah
Woah-oowoah, Woah-oowoah, Woah-oowoah, Woah-oowoah

And I'm so glad I don't hear you say no
I'm so glad I dont hear you say no

You could really put me in my place
On a map in outerspace
You've got a real cool constitution, and it's a come on
But it's not an illusion
Yeah

There is no modern mystery
No mystic chords of memory
There is no modern mystery
We're making up our history

There is no modern mystery, (Oooh)
No mystic chords of memory. (Oooh)
There is no modern mystery, (Oooh)
We're making up our history. (Oooh)

There is no modern mystery
No in-between ancestry
I didn't mean to hurt ya
Thought I was done
But I heard ya

There is no modern mystery, (Oooh)
No mystic chords of memory. (Oooh)
There is no modern mystery, (Oooh)
We're making up our history. (Oooh)

Woah-oowoah, Woah-oowoah, Woah-oowoah, Woah-oowoah
Woah-oowoah, Woah-oowoah, Woah-oowoah, Woah-oowoah, Woah-oowoah

And we may fight with each others shadows
But I'm so glad I don't hear you say no
Yeah, I'm so glad I don't here you say no
I'm so glad I don't hear you say no
