Becky said she wouldn't fuck wit me cause I'm a scholar
Joanin' on my duck head, cats with starch collars
Now she rob my jack-jet, it's from my Alma Mater
Since I got they coke wet bitch, guns nigga holla
Straight from Bucks County, she says her sister's so simple
Precisely why state cops should bear instrumentals
Reppin' love since she moved off campus at temple
Look, Britney Spears, oops! Nutted on your dimple
Poppy pop these, you can't pass for Puerto Rican
Pop these nuts, don't touch my damn Vico
Spank got the alphabet, any letter of your liking
The Os, the Ks, the Js, and age and weight, please no fighting

[Hook]
Coke and wet, bitch, guns, nigga holla
Coke and wet, bitch, guns, nigga holla
Coke and wet, bitch, guns, nigga holla
Coke and wet, bitch, guns, nigga holla

Hemp hackey-sacking motherfuckers pulled the competition
Fuckin' wit my scrilla
Now I'm trying to figure how to make these sacks bigger
Becky got that ditch-ass connect
But they know from pulling triggers-I'm warring bitch
I ain't fuckin' wit them niggas
I'll just cook a score of crack
Flip a pin into D.C. in the '80s with the blacks
So just walk full of j-do, pimps and crackwhore Japs
That's big money stack
That's Cum Laude stack
That's Wall Street, Donald Trump, bass grilla stack
Beat, more on the mat
Finna forty nightly slumping garish
Bumping to the Ruba and I'm skeeted off that doigt

[Hook]
