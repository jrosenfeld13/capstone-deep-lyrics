Too much and it makes me crazy
Not enough and it makes me lazy
Too much makes me lazy
Not enough and it makes me crazy

Time stops just for a moment
And then again it's only an instant
Time stops just for an instant
And then again it's only a moment

They always keep themselves clean
They always keep themselves clean
They always keep themselves clean
They always keep themselves clean
They always keep themselves clean
Clean

Know what I mean?
(Know what I mean?)
I wish that this feeling
Would go away

They're gonna get you sooner or later
These tigers made of paper
Don't pay now, you have to pay later
Confronting tigers made of paper

They always keep themselves clean
Yeah, they always keep themselves clean
They always keep themselves clean
They always keep themselves clean
They always keep themselves clean
Clean

I can't shake this feeling
I, I can't shake this feeling
No, I can't shake this feeling
Feeling
How do you feel?
