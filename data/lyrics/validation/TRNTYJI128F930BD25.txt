I took the chance when the time came
But i chose the wrong one, wrong one
I only play in the short game
Never for the long run, long run
You know whats wrong and know it
Theres no doubt about it
I forgoten how i never live without it
Feeling breaking down but i just think about it
I just think about it, i just think about it
I just think about it, i just think..
I get it, when i want it
And i do it, all the time
(x2)
I lose myself in the night time
Calling out to no one, no one
I wait around for the right time
But i know it won't come, won't come
Still i wanna know but never ask about it
Will i let it go and, just forget about it?
??? never live without it
I try to stop x3
But i can't get it off my mind
I get it, when i want it
And i do it, all the time
(x2)
I just think about it
