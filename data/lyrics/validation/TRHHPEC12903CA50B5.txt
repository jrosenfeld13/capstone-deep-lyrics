[Chorus]
Farewell, Royal High School
We'll remember you
Dear alma mater
We're steadfast, loyal, and true

[Verse 1]
As we go onward
In the lives we lead
Your light will guide us
Your motto is our creed

[Verse 2]
We will look back fondly
At your ivy walls
Recalling precious moments
Within your hallowed halls

[Chorus]
