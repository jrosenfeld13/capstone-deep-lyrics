Your feet don't move without the base

The crowd don't move without the dj

Hit the floor like an earthquake

You wanna make my body melt

Raise it up to the bar like you in first place

One shot, 2 shots, 3 shots, to face

Wait, you know I like it when you take that there

Driving a mercedes, tell her shookin for the ladies

Your body 50 crazy, bottles poppin on dizzy

I'ma make your body dizzy, you know you gonn keep me busy

Champagne, fizzy, bizy, I put my television baby

Alawar, we are heads that hold the bar

Get your ass up, out to see

I wanna see you in vip, so you can touch the stars

Private plane into spain, let the money rain

Touch the stars, touch the stars

Private plane into spain, let the money rain

Touch the stars, touch the stars

We taking this club, all the way to the stars

Straight to mars, fuck the spaceships

We the flying cars

Open bars, girls go crazy, they know who we are

Warrup sweetheart, wanna go back and play hotel sesaw

Wanna go back and play hotel sesaw, hotel sesaw

Don't stop baby, I already know what you came here for

You came here for

Alawar, we are heads that hold the bar

Get your ass up, out to see

I wanna see you in vip, so you can touch the stars

Private plane into spain, let the money rain

You wanna make my body numb

Fill my cup, turn me sideways

One shot, 2 shots, 3 shots, to face
