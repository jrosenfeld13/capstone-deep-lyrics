You never fucking cared
So don't act like you were ever there
I'm so sick of hearing your fucking voice
Desperate words and petty fights
Your breaking hearts on borrowed time
Just to sew the perfect life
I've sat by and watched you change too many fucking times

As I glance back, through our numbered days it used to mean so much
It's just another memory
As I glance back, through our numbered days it used to mean so much
It's just another past mistake

I wanna forget. x3

You never fucking cared
So don't act like you were ever there
I'm so sick of hearing your fucking voice
Desperate words and petty fights

Every time I asked for help
You tried to find another way out
Through the black and blues of our numbered days
I barely spoke your fucking name
