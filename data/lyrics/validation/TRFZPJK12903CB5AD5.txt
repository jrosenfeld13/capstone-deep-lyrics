Well the good ways down the railroad track there was a little old rundown shack
And in it lived a man I'd never seen
Folks said he was a mean and vicious man and you better not set foot on his land
But I didn't think nobody could be that mean
So I took me a walking down the railroad track
I was gonna go down to that little old shack
And just find out if all them things I heard was true
There was a big black dog a lying in the yard
And he growled at me and I swallowed hard
And I heard somebody say well who are you
Oh there he stood in the door of his shack
With beer in his hand and with hair long and black
He was the biggest man I'd ever seen
When he spoke his voice was low and mean
But he just didn't frighten me cause somehow I just knew he wasn't mean
He said what you doing snoopin' round my place and I saw a smile come across his face
So I smiled back and I told him who I was
He said come on in and pull you up a chair
You might as well cause you're already here and he said you call me Joshua
Joshua Joshua what you doing living all alone
Joshua Joshua ain't you got nobody to call your own

We talked till the sun went out of sight
And we was still talkin' when it turned daylight
Cause there was just so much we had to say
Now I'd spend my life in an orphan's home and just like him I was all alone
So I said yeah when he asked me if I'd stay
Well we grew closer as time went on and that little old shack was a happy home
And we just couldn't help but fall in love
And that big black dog and that little old shack
A sittin' down there by the railroad track
Was plenty good enough for me and Joshua
Joshua Joshua why you're just what I been looking for
Joshua Joshua we ain't gonna be lonely anymore (yodel)
(It just sounds like Dolly doesn't it)
It's just story of me and Joshua real love story me and Joshua me and Joshua
