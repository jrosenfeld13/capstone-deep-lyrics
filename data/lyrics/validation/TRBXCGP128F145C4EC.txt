You never will be mine, you never will be mine
You never will be mine, you never will be

When I get left alone, the streets offer me a home
So many times I've tried to reach for the truth inside
Each time you close the door, I think I need you more and more
Just give me the time of day, I'll make your hopes and dreams fall away
I'll make your hopes and dreams fall away

You never will be mine, you never will be mine
You never will be mine, you never will be

Your skin it just drives me mad, oh God I want you so bad
Wanna kiss your red hot lips, push myself against your hips
Take me baby in your arms, safe from all the damage, love and harm
Tie me up and don't let me go, then fuck me nice and slow
Then fuck me nice and slow, 'til I just can't take anymore
'Til I can't take it anymore
