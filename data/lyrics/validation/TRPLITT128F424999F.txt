[Verse 1]
Was Riding along side the highway
Rolling up the country side
Thinking I'm the devil's heat wave
What you burn in your crazy mind?
Saw a slight distraction standing by the road
She was smiling there, yellow in her hair
Do you want to, I was thinking
Would you care

[Chorus]
Sweet Hitch-a-Hiker
We could make music at the Greasy King
Sweet Hitch-a-Hiker
Won't you ride on my fast machine?

[Verse 2]
Cruising on thru the junction
I'm flying 'bout the speed of sound
Noticing peculiar function
I ain't no roller coaster show me down
I turned away to see her
Woa! she caught my eye
But I was rolling down, moving too fast
Do you want to
She was thinking can it last

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Was busted up along the highway
I'm the saddest riding fool alive
Wondering if you're going in my way
Won't you give a poor boy a ride?
Here she comes a riding
Lord, She's flying high
But she was rolling down, moving too fast
Do you wan to
She was thinking can I last

[Chorus][3x]
