Listening like you did before
Now you're listening no more
See that girl, she's the one I want
To be holding, holding me close

I say, you say, weren't you listening
Now it's too late
You're not listening
I say, you say, weren't you listening
Now it's too late
You're not listening

I've said it all before
So many words, but you just close the door
Did you notice the changes in me
But now it's too late to see

I say, you say, weren't you listening
Now it's too late
You're not listening
I say, you say, weren't you listening
Now it's too late
You're not listening

I hope you understand the feeling of freedom I demand

I say, you say, weren't you listening
Now it's too late
You're not listening
I say, you say, weren't you listening
Now it's too late
You're not listening
