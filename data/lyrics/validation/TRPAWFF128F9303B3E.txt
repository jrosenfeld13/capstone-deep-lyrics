Verse 1
Lately I've been feeling strange
Deep down inside
Something kinda hard to explain
Like butterflies
Suddenly I'm only longing for the hot stuff
Something inside me tells me this is real
Now I've got the vibe tell me that's the same way you feel for me

[Chorus]
So baby can you fix me
Cause my fever
Is only getting stronger
It's burning like a fire
Baby let's rock the night away

So baby can you fix me
Cause my body
Suffers from my hunger
A superstrong desire
Baby let's rock the night away

[Verse 2]
Sitting by the telephone
Hoping that you will call
My friends say that I'm crazy that I'm
Just wasting my time
But you turn me on
Got me longing for the hot stuff
Something inside me tells me this is real
Now I've got the vibe tell me that's the same way you feel for me
Ow-oooh yeah ih yeah

[Chorus]
So baby can you fix me
Cause my fever
Is only getting stronger
It's burning like a fire
Baby lets rock the night away
(let's rock the night away)

So baby can you fix me
Cause my body
Suffers from my hunger
A superstrong desire
Baby let's rock the night away

[Bridge]
I'm over the top with you baby
Whoo oow yeah
I'm loosing my mind can't you see
What u mean to me
Eeh yeah ih yeah i yeaaaaaaaaah
You got me goin crazy
Crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy

[Chorus]
So baby can you fix me
Cause my fever
Is only getting stronger(is only getting stronger)
It's burning like a fire
Baby let's rock the night away(let's rock the night away)

So baby can you fix me
Cause my body
Suffers from my hunger
A superstrong desire
Baby let's rock the night away
Let's rock the night away
