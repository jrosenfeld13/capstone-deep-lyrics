Getting over you
Was the hardest thing I ever had to do
I'd cry myself to sleep at night
Although I smiled, it's what I used to do
To make it easier
I wonder where you are and who you're with
And if you love them too
Sometimes I wish I knew
I know deep down the truth would break your heart
I still miss you

Sometimes I do
Sometimes I do

Won't you come back to me
Because I want to be
The one who you're with
Won't you come back to me
Because I want to be
The one who you're with

We've been over years
And I have no more tears left for you
I think I'm over you
But still, I think of all the times
That I spent in your arms
Under the stars
We both thought it would never end
I thought my heart would never mend
But oh, how we've changed
And even though we don't speak anymore
I still miss you

Sometimes I do
Sometimes I do

Won't you come back to me
Because I want to be
The one who you're with
(x4)
Who you're with
