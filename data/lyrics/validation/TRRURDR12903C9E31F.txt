God sent His son and they called Him Jesus
He came to love, heal and forgive
He lived and He died to buy my pardon
An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives

Because He lives I can face tomorrow
Because He lives all fear is gone
Because I know He holds the future
My life is worth a living just because He lives

Then one day I'm gonna cross that river
I'm gonna fight life's final, life's final war with pain
And then as death someday gives way to victory
I'm gonna see those lights of glory and know that my Savior reigns

Because He lives I can face tomorrow
Because He lives all fear is gone
Because I know He holds the future
My life is worth a living just because He lives
My life is worth a living just because He lives
