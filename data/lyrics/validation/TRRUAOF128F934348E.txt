Give me a call when yer strung out or when you're bored
Been so long and heavy but now you think I'm ready
Lean on me, lean on me, give it a try, it won't hurt
Leave it with the papers and the capers and the dirt

Had a friend who died today, got a long distance call
Who knows what or when or how but what I'd do to see his face now
Lean on me, lean on me, wham bam, Doug Sahm
Get my brains from a garden plant

You ain't got the truth in the line
Stick with the ones who never, get put out by the fire

I never was one for pictures, yeah, you could hang up on the wall
Start 'em up here in my head, wait for them to fall
Let's go get wrong, real real gone
Raise a toast to the Polaroid ghost and let some water fall

You ain't got the truth in the line
Stick with the ones who never, get put out by the fire
