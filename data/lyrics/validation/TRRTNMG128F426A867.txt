Voices in the dead of night
Whisper words of loneliness
It's true
Footsteps echo down the hall
Comin' ever closer to you
It's not fair for mortal man
To put up with this pain
I'm goin' through

You should be happy
Now you're on your own
You should be happy
Now you're on your own

If I could walk through that door
I'd leave behind these broken memories
Trapped inside this empty room
Despiration's closing in on me
If I had your heart of stone
I could break these chains
And I'd be free

You should be happy
Now you're on your own
You should be happy
Now you're on your own

I could be happy
I could be happy, someday
If you would have tried
If you hadn't lied
We'd never be alone again

Happy
Now you're on your own
Happy
Yes, you're on your own
You should be
Happy
Now you're on your own
Happy
Oh yes, you're on your own
But, now I'm
Happy
Now I'm on my own
Happy
