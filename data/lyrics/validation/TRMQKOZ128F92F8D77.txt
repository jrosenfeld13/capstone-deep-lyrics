Marmalade, sunny days
Drugs make me want to sit next to you
Doctors floating to and fro
Silverfish is on the go

I'm in rapture, I'm in deep
All I want to do is sleep
Sky enclose me
I'm going down

Marmalade, marmalade
Don't try to find me
Don't try to pull me out, my marmalade
Marmalade, marmalade
Make me so happy
Make me forget my name, my marmalade

Duck pond memories
Pass me by
Paddleboats and cherry pie
Wet eyelashes
Look inside
Droplets gather in your eye

Days and hours melt away
Dolly says "I'm here to stay"
It's hard to care
The mist comes down

Marmalade, marmalade
Tell me a story
Help me forget I'm gone, my marmalade
Marmalade, marmalade
Hide me somewhere
Carry me out of here, my marmalade

Marmalade, marmalade
You're the devil
You're half empty now, my marmalade
My marmalade
