When we were on the river two sides formed a shore
And it was time to choose one or the other
Hoping my wooden paddle wouldn't fail...

When you get into the boat
The current takes you for a ride
But if the boat has no float
Can't get to the other side

And it was time to choose one or the other
Hoping my wooden paddle wouldn't fail
