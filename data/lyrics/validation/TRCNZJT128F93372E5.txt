Spoken:
"House in the Country," take one

No need to worry
Folks in a hurry
Leave them behind you
No one can find you
House in the country
House in the country

All the relaxin'
Will soon fill the cracks in
Good for your head too
If you are led to
House in the country
House in the country
Green surrounding
Love abounding
You won't find a manhole there

Yes, yes I need you
Come let me feed you
I've never tried to
Come let me hide you
House in the country
House in the country

I have never brought anybody there
Bring your own chair to sleep in
When we arrive, after the drive
Then you can shower, and talk for an hour
Then sleep in your chair

Sleep on the floor there
Don't ask for more there
Sun wakes you up too
Glad you came up to
House in the country
House in the country

La la la la la
House in the country
House in the country
House in the country
House in the country
