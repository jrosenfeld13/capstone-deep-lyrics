Lord will you tell me why the river ran dry
Please Lord tell me won't you just say why
Used to catch catfish right over there
Right over there 'fore the river ran bare
Won't you tell me why
Luck is not my friend
Went to church sometimes
Tried hard not to sin
Lord will you tell me why the river ran dry
Please Lord tell me won't you just say why
Lord won't you tell me why my baby had to go
Please Lord tell me won't you let me know
Used to say she loved me every night and everyday
Why'd she have to pack it up and move away
Won't you tell me why
She just got annoyed
I had to quit my job
Temporarily unemployed
Lord won't you tell me why my baby had to go
Please Lord tell me won't you let me know
Lord will you tell me why the river ran dry
Please Lord tell me won't you just say why
Used to catch catfish right over there
Right over there 'fore the river ran bare
Won't you tell me why
Luck is not my friend
Went to church sometimes
Tried hard not to sin
Lord will you tell me why the river ran dry
Please Lord tell me won't you just say why
