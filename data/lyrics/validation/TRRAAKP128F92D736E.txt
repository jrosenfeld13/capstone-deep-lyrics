(Wayne Taylor/Forty WAT Music, BMI)
You keep saying things I don't understand
I try real hard to never let it show
Your sophisticated ways have left me in a daze
I guess I'm just another gravel in the road
My friends all tried to tell me when I met you
You're needn't think you'll ever keep that girl
They said your high-class taste would lay my
Life to waste
And I'd never be accepted in your world
I've started to believe what they've been saying
It's becoming clear our feelings
Aren't the same
You keep trying to change me
From what I choose to be
But you gotta know that
I don't play that game
