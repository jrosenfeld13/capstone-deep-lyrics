Hey pussycat
What's going down

Whatever happened to saturday night
When you dressed up sharp and you felt all right
It don't seem the same since cosmic light
Came into my life, I thought I was divine, wo wo

I used to go for a ride with a chick who'd go
And listen to the music on the radio
A saxophone was blowing on a rock'n'roll show
We climbed in the back seat, and really had a good time

Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock and roll

My head was swimming from the perfume I smelled
My hands kind of fumbled with her white plastic belt
I'd taste her baby pink lipstick and that's when I'd melt
She'd whisper in my ear tonight she really was mine

Get back in front, put some hair oil on
Buddy Holly was singing his very last song (bop sho wop)
With your arms around your girl you'd try to sing along (bop sho wop)
It felt pretty good (bop sho wop) because you'd really had a good time

Hot patootie, bless my soul (yeah yeah) I really love that rock and roll (rock and roll)
Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul (I really love) I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock and roll

Hey

Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that
Hot patootie, bless my soul (I really love) I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that (yeah yeah yeah)
Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock and roll (I really love that)
Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock and roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock and rock and rock and roll
Hot patootie!
