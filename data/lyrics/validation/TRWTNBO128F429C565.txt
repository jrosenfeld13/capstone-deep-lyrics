Lightning strikes me down
I'm on my knees
I can't write it out, but I'll show you what I mean
And the words, they will drip down the side of your cheeks
And I'm able to read them when they spell out
"Let's just be friends"
Four simple words that
We keep on ignoring again and again
(As if we never even meant it)

Baby, let's leave them all for dead
All those thoughts inside your head can be reality
So let yourself believe

My life is a cross of a fire and a stampede
I burn inside, you still run after me
Yeah, we'll find out how it feels to burn alive
Oh, you and me, girl
Let's set ourselves on fire
(As if we never even meant it)

Baby, let's leave them all for dead
All those thoughts inside your head can be reality
So let yourself believe

Oh yeah, we don't care who finds out
Tonight is all that matters right now
Let's go once more down to the dance floor
Make me sell my soul for more

(Even when we fall asleep together)

Baby, let's leave them all for dead
All those thoughts inside your head can be reality
So let yourself believe
I feel your body radiate in the lightning we create
So let yourself believe

Oh yeah, we don't care who finds out
Tonight is all that matters right now
Let's go once more down to the dance floor
Make me sell my soul for more
