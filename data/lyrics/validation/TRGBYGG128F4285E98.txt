Sadness into all my flesh
Into this grey sky and around my body
Walking through the obscurity
In this dark forest I will free myself

Into myself no atmosphere
Sadness I find in my soul
I'm alone against my useless tears
Forever and ever again

Grey, this is the mist day
I feel the sorrow deep in my subconscious
