Whether you are here or yonder
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander
I'm growing fonder, of you!

Even though your friends forsake you
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you
And give you the break you need!

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find, you're on my mind
More than you know!

Whether you're right
Whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
I need you so, more than you'll ever know!

Loving you the way that I do
There's nothin' I can do about it
Loving may be all that you can give
But honey I can't live without it!

Hmmm . . . Oh, how I'd cry
Oh, how I'd cry
If you got tired and said goodbye
More than I'd show
More than you'd ever know!
