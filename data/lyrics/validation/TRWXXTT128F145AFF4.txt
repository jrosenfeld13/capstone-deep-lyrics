How time lfies when you're biting your lip 'til it hurts
Going over and over the same old things in your mind, oh my
Hours gone by and hours yet to go
Just what I'm waiting for, I don't really know
But then there's you

You know what's going on
You know what's taking place
It's only me that's lost in space

Spin me around yes, give me more of your lies
Give me the gospel according to you
And that's fine by me
I'm sure that I'm wrong and all is not what it seems
But a hundred to one says you
Give the same old lines to me
But then that's you

You know what's going on...

In every good story there's always a twist in the tale
So there's a note on your door that I really feel sure
Will make your face go pale

You know what's going on...
