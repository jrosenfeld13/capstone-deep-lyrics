Woke up on smoke and flames
Eye to eye with a stranger
5000 photographs - saw them burnt up in anger

Am I asleep still?
Tell Me I could have been
Don't let it tear us apart again limb from limb
Please let me in

But I don't want to look at you this way
I'm staring through your window
I don't want to think of you this way
I'm begging baby

Let me in
Baby just let me in
I'm begging at your door
Just let me in
Just let me in

I drank the wine of youth
Ended up in a coma
Your wicked silver tongue
No wonder nobody told you

That I'm awake now
First time I've ever been
Able to see what I should have been way back when
You let me in

But I don't want to look at you this way
I'm staring through your window
I don't want to think of you this way
I'm begging baby

Let me in
Baby just let me in
I'm begging at your door
Just let me in
Just let me in

This white flag waving just won't end up saving us
This is farewell unless somehow you let me in

But I don't want to look at you this way
I'm staring through your window
I don't want to think of you this way
I'm screaming baby

Let me in
Baby just let me in
I'm screaming at your door
Just let me in
Just let me in

This white flag waving just won't end up saving us
This is farewell unless somehow you let me in
