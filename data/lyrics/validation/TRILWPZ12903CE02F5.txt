My heart lies deep, buried in cobwebs
My mind grows weak, conjuring nonsense
Confide, tell me what you don't trust
This soul will hold onto nothing
Every day I spend on trial
To avoid what scares me the most
Although I try, I cannot relate
To most anyone or to most anything
My ears burn hot, your friend is a suspect
Paranoid of what the people are saying
Replied to the message I believed in
This body holds a chemical process
Every day I spend on trial
To avoid what scares me the most
Although I try, I cannot relate
To most anyone or to most anything
My heart lies deep, out of reach
Out of reach, out of reach
My mind grows weak, for weeks
For weeks, for weeks
My heart lies deep, buried in cobwebs...
