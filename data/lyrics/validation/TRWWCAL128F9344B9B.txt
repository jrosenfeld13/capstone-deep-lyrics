You (x3)

You
Every time you go
You leave my heart alone
I flow in the darkness

You
Every time I'm there
You fill my body with care
I flooow

You
Every time you go (x2)

I flow
I flow in the darkness (x2)

You created darkness
It covers me at night
You created coldness
It shivers me inside (x2)

Darkness
Coldness
You
Darkness
You
Coldness

In the darkness (x6)

I flow
In the darkness

I flow
I flow in the darkness

In the darkness (x3)
I flow in the darkness
