Baby let's cruise, away from here
Don't be confused baby, the way is clear
And if you want it you got it forever
Just for a one night stand in bed
Let the music take your mind
And, just release and you would find

We gonna fly away, plan to go my way
I love it when we're cruising together
Music was made for love, cruising is made for love
I love it when we're cruising together

Baby tonight belongs to us
Everything's right, do what you must
And inch by inch we get closer and closer oh
Every little part is in touch
Oh baby, baby oh
Let the music take your mind
Just release and you would find, baby
I love it I love it

[Chorus]
We gonna fly away, plan to go my way
I love it when we're cruising together
Music was made for love, cruising is made for love
I love it when we're cruising together

Oh oh, cruise for me babe

Oh baby let's cruise
Let's flow, let's glide
Oh let's open up, and go inside
And if you want it you got it forever
I can just stay there inside you
And love you baby, oh
Let the music take your mind
Just release and you would find, baby

[Chorus]
Oh, we gonna fly

[Chorus]
