I dont accept your way of life
And dont accept your political sight
I dont accept your contradiction
Dont wanna know what you think

[Chorus]
Ill slander you
And hush you up
Destroy your identity
Until youll be only a lie

I dont accept your opinions
And dont accept freedom of speech
I dont accept your sexuality
Dont wanna hear what you say

[Chorus]
I dont accept your individuality
And dont accept the music you like
I dont accept your nationality
And exterminate disliked races

[Chorus]
I dont accept your property
And dont accept human rights
I dont accept that you love my sister
So youll die

[Chorus]
I dont accept the colour of your clothes
And dont accept your corpulence
I dont accept that you will survive
In my war of nerves

[Chorus]
