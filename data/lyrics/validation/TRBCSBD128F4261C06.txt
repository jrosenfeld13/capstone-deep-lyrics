Sapped and stupid
I lie upon the stones and I swoons
The darling little dandelions have done their thing
And changed from suns into moons
Dragons roam the shopping malls
I hear they're gonna eat our guts
If I had the strength I might pick up my sword
And make some attempt to resist

Get ready to shield yourself
Grab your sap and your heaters
Get ready to shield yourself
On the night of the lotus eaters

Mmmmm, don't you love me baby
Mmmmm, and don't you love my baby anymore

They gilded my scales, they fish-bowled me
And they toured me round the old aquariums
They come in their hordes to tap at the glass
The philistines and the barbarians
I like floating here, it's nice
They've hung seaweed around my hips
And I do the hula for the hungry ones
And the lames all throw me tips

Get ready to shield yourself
Grab your sap and your heaters
Get ready to shield yourself
On the night of the lotus eaters

Mmmmm, don't you love me baby
Mmmmm, and don't you love me my baby anymore

Get ready to shield yourself
From our catastrophic leaders
Get ready to shield yourself
Grab your sap and your heaters
On the night of the lotus eaters

Now hit the streets
Now hit the streets
