[Verse 1]
I'll bet two years, I'll bet one year
I'll bet those years you won't be here
I guess I'll keep, I guess you'll keep every memory
Sadly we may never be
I'll bet my tears, I'll bet your tears
I'll bet those tears over time could disappear

[Pre-Chorus]
Wait a minute, I have more to say
And I care if you're listening to me

[Chorus]
I need you more than you'll ever know
Still do, willing to let it show
I need a minute just to get you
I feel like I might be getting through
Come over and say nothing
Silence is everything

[Bridge]
I know, I know (I know, I know)
Feelings can show (oh)
If you let go
It must told (must be told)
That I've got a hold (oh)
On what we used to have

[Verse 2]
I will forgive if you forget all the things we said
Let's accept it

[Chorus]
I need you more than you'll ever know
Still do, willing to let it show
I need a minute just to get you
I feel like I might be getting through
Come over and say nothing
Silence is everything
