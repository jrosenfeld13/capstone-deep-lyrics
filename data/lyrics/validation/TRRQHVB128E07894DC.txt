Frustration, twisted point of view
Suicide, caused by those who follow
Denial to obey the given rules
Anarchy, proven ways to start a war
Taking atvantage of the weak
Waiting for time that will not heal
Incoherrance comnsumes your mind
Your dreams and nightmares will become alive
Fall to me endlessly
World in hand, take your land
Lunatic, blood line black
Racist pig, you attack
Frustration...
...start a war
No control, take your soul
Full of sin, you begin
To lose your faith in God
Fall to me...
...you attack
Taking advantage...
...will become alive
