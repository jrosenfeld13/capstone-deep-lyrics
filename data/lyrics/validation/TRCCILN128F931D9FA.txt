The truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth
The truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth
So help me, truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth
The truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth

Through the blacked out windows of the police van
You can see your last flash moments as a free man
What did they expect you to say
When you was hoping it would go away?

The truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth
The truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth
So help me, truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth
The truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth

Got involved by mischance, ended up in grief
Cleared out the house then phoned up your brief
All this stress is making me ill
I've had enough so do what you will

In your dreams in your fantasy
The Judge and Jury and the Court agree
You should go free
You should go free...

In your slumbers it may be so
But if you don't tell them what they wanna know
Wanna know
What they want to know...

The truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth
The truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth
So help me, truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth
The truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth

As the gates slams behind you in the red light glare
You'll be asking yourself if you really dare
Still in truth you can't say nothing at all
You rack your mind, but still can't recall

The truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth
The truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth
So help me, truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth
The truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth

In the blue flames that burn all night
They expect you to put up a fight
Put up a fight
Or be polite...

With circumstances well in remand
If you don't give them what they demand
What they demand
What they demand...

The truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth
The truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth
So help me, truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth
The truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth
So help me, truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth
The truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth
So help me, truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth
The truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth
So help me, truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth
The truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth

The truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth
The truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth
The truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth
The truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth

The whole truth
The whole truth
The whole truth...
