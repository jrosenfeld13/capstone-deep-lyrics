We'll find each other where we promised
Where the tide is low for man and spirits
I put aside the yearning of my voice when I was young
We'll find each other where we promised

Even until the darkest hour
When the lives we left are gone forever
We hover on the crosswinds
There is time to meet again
Even until the darkest hour

We'll find each other where we promised
We'll find each other where we promised
