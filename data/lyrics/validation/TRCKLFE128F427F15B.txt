Made a steeple with your fingers
Made a cradle with a piece of string
Made a snowman, made a treehouse
Made a game of everything

But when you, when you grew up
You grew up and forgot what's real
What's precious, not precocious
How being in love with life feels

If I so little deserve you
Then why have you stayed for so long?
If I so little deserve you
Then why have you not gone?

Made the girls swoom without thinking
Made this girl begin to wonder why
Made me flowers from crepe paper
I was charmed there for a while

But when you, when you grew up
You grew up and forgot what's true
What's nice, not nauseating
How you once felt how I feel for you

If I so little deserve you
Then why have you stayed for so long?
If I so little deserve you
Then why have you not gone?

'Cause you may be grown up
And you may be cool
But I may be anything, anything but cruel
So don't ever ask me
Just what you should say
'Cause you could say anything, anything, anything

If I so little deserve you
Then why have you stayed for so long?
If I so little deserve you
Then why have you not gone?
