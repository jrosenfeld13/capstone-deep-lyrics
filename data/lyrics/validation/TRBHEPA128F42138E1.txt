Oh no, don't take
This is our last order
Last order

If you're (physical youth)
You say you're moving youth
So why don't you feel?
So why don't you feel the beat
Say how you could!

Give me...
Another one
My old regrets
Can't stay always (alone)
You feel the beat

This is...
One day the grounds will sway
Divine body, look right!
This is...

Give me another one
And take my old regrets
Can't stay always alone
Why don't you feel the beat?
Oh, why don't you feel the beat?
