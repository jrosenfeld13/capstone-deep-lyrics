Don't shoot ...tough guy
I surrender
Fortune...trouble
Come whatever
Rock me...hard times
Take me over
Drive me
Crazy
I can't remember
I m gonna ask
One more time
I'm gonna ask
One more time

Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?

Heartbeat...tick tock
Like forever
Love me rougher
Understanding is overrated
So take me lover
I'm gonna ask
One more time
I'm gonna ask
One more time
I'm gonna ask
One more time

Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love?
