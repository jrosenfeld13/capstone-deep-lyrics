I always wonder where your mind is
And don't you think that you've got the time
I see you floating down this river
And don't you think that you could be mine?

Na na na na please be mine woah oh oh

You make me feel like a broken pinwheel
And don't you think that we could make it shine?
Even after all my cold desperation
And don't you think that you could be mine?

Na na na na please be mine woah oh oh
