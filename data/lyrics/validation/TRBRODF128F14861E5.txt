Sometimes I get so lonely
I feel like I could cry
Since I saw you with that man this morning
Well I feel like I could die

Why, why, why did you leave me this way?
You know you left me alone and so empty, baby
It's been so lonesome since you went away

Now i'm standing by my window
I decided what I will do
I will never tell anybody
How much I love you

Why, why, why did you leave me this way?
You know you left me alone and so empty, baby
It's been so lonesome since you went away

Now I'm sitting writing this letter
Stained with the tears from my eye
It says Goodbye, darling I love you
But you left me why, oh, why?

Why, why, why did you leave me this way?
Why?
You know you left me alone and so empty, baby
It's been so lonesome since you went away
