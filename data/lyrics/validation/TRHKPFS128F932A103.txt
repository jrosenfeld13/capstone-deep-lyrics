Your burning eyes
Force me to the ground
You're telling lies
Madness is in your words
Your poisoned smile
The gate to my desires
Your pale white skin
I wanne taste your sweat

You are the perfect lie
You're so unreal
You are the perfect lie
You are so real

I don't want your body
I want your mind
I don't want to sleep with you
I want your soul
I don't want to be your toy
I want your love
Your are not made for me
I want your death

Nothing behind your mask
Nothing but a little girl
Nothing that you can hide
Not for me
