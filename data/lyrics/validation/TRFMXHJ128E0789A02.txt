[Verse 1]
Show me the road and I will find my own
You build your bridges and I'll burn 'em down
So far away and all alone I roam
I'll take my chances in the here and now

[Pre-Chorus]
And all you wonder is who's for sale
Well, you won't know now and I won't tell
You're always hiding, throwing up your hands
While heroes ride again

[Chorus]
And God only knows all the places I've been
But I love this life that I'm living in
I won't look back to regret yesterday
We're not handed tomorrow, so I'll live for today

[Verse 2]
Another day and yet another's done
Spending a life living within' the past
I'll take the chance before the chance has gone
You never know when it'll be your last

[Pre-Chorus]
And all you wonder is who's for sale
Well, you won't know now and I won't tell
You're always hiding, throwing up your hands
While heroes ride again

[Chorus]
And God only knows all the places I've been
But I love this life that I'm living in
I won't look back to regret yesterday
We're not handed tomorrow, so I'll live for today

[Bridge]
We'll know when we run out of time
Until it's all over with
And there'll be no where to run
We'll never say it but we're over out heads
And we're drowning inside with all the things we've said

[Chorus]
And God only knows all the places I've been
But I love this life that I'm living in
I won't look back to regret yesterday
We're not handed tomorrow, so I'll live for today
And God only knows all the places I've been
But I love this life that I'm living in
I won't look back to regret yesterday
We're not handed tomorrow, so I'll live for today
