My heart belongs to you
You're the happiness I know I can depend on
Been there for me when things go wrong
There's a river full of love I can rely on

You and I have faced troubled times before
Because of you I live needing nothing more
Where you are my heart isn't very far
So promise me now we'll always be forever

Everyday I wake and every night I dream of
One thing in life I'm sure of
You are the love of my life
Never should there be one moment lived without you
Nothing I'd change about you
You are the love of my life

My life is who you are
All I want to do is simply rest in your arms
You chase away this loneliness
In the middle of the storm I'm lost in heaven

You and I have come through the rains before
Because of you I live wanting nothing more
Where you are my heart can't be very far
So promise me now we'll always be forever

Everyday I wake and every night I dream of
One thing in life I'm sure of
You are the love of my life
Never should there be one moment lived without you
Nothing I'd change about you
You are the love of my life

You're the summer breeze and yes my inspiration
Song I sing, my salvation, you are the love of my life
Trust me when I say that I can't live without you
You're in my heart, now that we are, forever we'll be

Everyday I wake and every night I dream of
One thing in life I'm sure of
You are the love of my life
Never should there be one moment lived without you
Nothing I'd change about you
You are the love of my life
