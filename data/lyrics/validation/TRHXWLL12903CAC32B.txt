Can you see the air change?
Can you see when a heart breaks?
I know that both do happen
But all I want is faith

'Cause I can feel this
And so much so I believe it
But still there is a struggle
And all I want is faith

And I believe I'll move the mountains
I think
Or maybe I'll drown in the sea

Keep holding on
All I got is holding onto these roses
The thorns will keep on digging
But my soul believes, please

So here I breathe in oxygen I cannot see
The oxygen that keeps me alive and wary
Oh, yes I do perceive

That like the birds find
Provision and sanctuary
You do this even more so for me
But all I want is faith

And I believe I'll move the mountains
I think
Or maybe I'll drown in the sea

Keep holding on
All I got is holding on these roses
The thorns will keep on digging
But my soul believes

Places, seasons, millions of pieces
Together and all alone
Needing, repeating, living and bleeding
Lost in the cohesion

Stagnant or will I run?
Give up or will I run
Into arms that are open?

Get rid of all the fear
I know that you are here

Keep holding on
All I got is holding on these roses
The thorns will keep on digging
But my soul believes, I see

And it's reminding me
That the thorns you wear
Is love that we must share
