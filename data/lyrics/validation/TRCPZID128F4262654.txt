(Written by: S. Blosl & W. Dane)

An army of vengeance invading from the sky
Hot wings of iron pierce into the night
Slaughtering the lost souls, the fruit of evil's womb
Their heathen ways have sealed their door

Echoing across the distant skies
The shout is heard battle angels cry
You'll all fall on your knees, and hail to our dawn
Crawl on your knees, the slaughter is on

The battle is raging, attack formation set
Hot blood flows through the streets, their pact is kept
To rape and kill the martyr, who dwells within this shrine
They did not heed the warning signs

Descending from the clouds they hunt you still
Battle angels kill your forces of will
You'll all fall on your knees, and hail to the our dawn
Crawl on your knees, the slaughter is on

Fall on your knees and hail to the our dawn
Crawl on your knees, the slaughter is on

Slaughter
