[Verse 1: Konan]
This year it's all about the timing
Got everybody talking 'bout the signing
While I'm here thinking 'bout the pressure
But I guess pressure makes diamonds
Mum used to pray that I stopped banging
MOBOs, now the woman won't stop bragging
I know they hated that we're shining
But we don't tuck our chains unless we fighting
Thinking back on how it felt
When you're always hearing no you start to doubt yourself
It's even harder when there ain't nobody round to help
Feeling lost, but that's when I really found myself
On Karl's grave, I swear I never let that stop me
If time is money, tell them watch me
My mum's heart broke when they got Karl
Imagine if they would have got me, imagine

[Hook: Mica Jazelle]
They say you've been drifting away from me
Drifting away from me
They say you've been drifting away from me
Drifting away from me, drifting away

[Verse 2: Krept]
Pound for pound, you out of your depth
I just got mummy out of her debt
The money only gonna make me worse
The cheques looking like a date of birth
It's mad how Kone lost it all and got it back up
Still ended up ballin', you rappers playing catch up
Don't stamp me those bottles boy, it might fuckin' stack up
All you niggas lying, so I'ma murder Mufasa
Bracka, bracka, I'ma murder a rapper
For saying they're the best, what the fuck, are we dead?
Top of the rap game last time I checked
Now you can smell money on us, we've been counting them cents
Used to pay for Nike, now Nike pay for us
Yeah I can afford a maid now but I still ain't made enough
Get a million and up, I probably still wouldn't rest
How are you the best dog if you up against the vets?

[Hook: Mica Jazelle]
They say you've been drifting away from me
Drifting away from me
They say you've been drifting away from me
Drifting away from me, drifting away
Drifting away, drifting away
They say that you've been drifting away from me
Drifting away from me
They say you've been drifting away from me
Drifting away from me, drifting away
