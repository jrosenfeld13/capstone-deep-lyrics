I'm going out tonight
I don't know if I'll be alright
Everyone wants to hurt me
Baby danger in the city

I have to carry a knife
Because there's people threatening my life
I can't dress just the way I want
I'm being chased by the National Front

Concrete jungle, animals are after me
Concrete jungle, it ain't safe on the streets
Concrete jungle, glad I got my mates with me

I won't fight for a cause
Don't want to change the law
Leave me alone, just leave me alone
I want to get out on my own

I'm walking home tonight
I only walk where there's lots of lights
In the alleys and the doorways
Some throw a bottle right in your face

Concrete jungle, animals are after me
Concrete jungle, it ain't safe on the streets
Concrete jungle, glad I got my mates with me

I'm walking home tonight
I only walk where there's lots of lights
In the alleys and the doorways
Some throw a bottle right in your face

I won't fight for a cause
I don't want to change the law
Leave me alone, just leave me alone
I want to get out on my own

Concrete jungle, animals are after me
Concrete jungle, it ain't safe on the streets
Concrete jungle, glad I got my mates with me
