I Want
To feel your body close
And I want to Hear every Breath and
Every word every waking moment
I dream of you

I want you
To love me like I've never felt love before
Warm me, hold me and
I want you
To take me to your secret place
Beneath the brazen skies
Under the Harvest Moon

Come inside my dream cave
Come inside my rainbow shell
Come inside my dream cave
And I will show you

We bathe in Shadows
Chocolate kisses linger
The air is heavy and sweet
In this luscious tangle
In this luscious tangle of oblivion

Come inside my dream cave
Come inside my rainbow shell
Come inside my dream cave
And I will show you

Come inside my dream cave
Come inside my rainbow shell
Come inside my dream cave
And I will show you
