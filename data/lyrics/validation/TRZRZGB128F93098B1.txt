Senses fail
And we know why
Indifference slides
From every corner
But I just want
To be with you
The silent screams
Above each other

It's a good thing
Such a good thing
To do
To do

While governments gain
All money can buy
Trash means cash
In any country
But I just want
To be with you
Our flesh feels fresh
And that's the beauty

It's a good thing
Such a good thing
We do
We do

It's a good thing
Such a good thing
We do
