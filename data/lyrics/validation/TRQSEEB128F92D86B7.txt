[Verse 1: Jeremy]
It's not the pale moon that excites me - give us a drink
That thrills and delights me
Ooh, no
It's just the nearness of you

It's not your sweet conversation
That brings this sensation
Oh, no
It's just the nearness of you, darling

[Verse 2: Chad]
When you're in my arms (when you're in my arms)
And I feel you so close to me (And I feel you so close to me)
And my wildest dreams (My wildest dreams)
Come true (My wildest dreams come true, darling)

[Verse 3: Jeremy and Chad]
I need no soft lights to enchant me
If you'll only grant me the right
To hold you ever so tight

The nearness of you
