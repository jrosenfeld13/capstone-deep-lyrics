It may be a phone call late at night
That wakes my heart and brings me to my knees
It could be the hurt that's in your eyes
That shakes my soul from all complacency
But, oh, I want you to know
That I will be the one who prays for you

It may be the presence of your past
That haunts your very will to just believe
It may seem the weight of all the world
Has crushed your dreams and laid them at your feet
But, oh, I want you to know
That I will be a friend to see you through

For I will walk the extra mile
When the road ahead seems long
I will share those lonely silent nights
That pass without a song
Knowing that the darkness
Is but for a little while
For you, my friend, I will walk
I will walk the extra mile

It may be the mention of your name
That brings a smile into my busy day
It could be a place we've been before
That echoes all the tender words you'd say
But, oh, I want you to know
That I have never had a friend like you, like you

And I will walk the extra mile
When the road ahead seems long
I will share those lonely silent nights
That pass without a song
Knowing that the darkness
Is but for a little while
For you, my friend, I will walk
I will walk the extra mile

And though the miles create a distance
That keeps us worlds apart
There's a road you walk each day
That travels through my heart

And I will walk the extra mile
When the road ahead seems long
I will share those lonely silent nights
That pass without a song
Knowing that the darkness
Is but for a little while
For you, my friend, I will walk
I will walk the extra mile

For you, my friend, I will walk
I will walk the extra mile
