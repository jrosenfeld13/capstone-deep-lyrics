Another face
Just like hers
She won't hold back
Without you

The sun will find you
Underneath your skin
You can't hide it
And I'll be there
Waiting for you now
Go on

Her perfect eyes are bleeding
Her mind so dead she can't take it
Can't take the world
It's too heavy

The sun will find you
Underneath your skin
You can't hide it
And I'll be there
Waiting for you now
Go on

And under the mess
You're working against me
You're wishing you're dead
But I will amend you
And you won't forget
You won't forget me
And wash out your hands
It's time to come it
