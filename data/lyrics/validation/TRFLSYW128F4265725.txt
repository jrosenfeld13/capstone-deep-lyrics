[Intro: Adrienne]
This ain't no maybe, baby
Oh no

[Verse: Kiely]
Today is my day that I know fo sho
Gotta speak first, gotta let you know
In case you're wondering if I'm available
If you think that I am, I am and if
Something's on your mind, you should let it off
I got time, maybe we should talk
It's no coincidence when you're caught off guard
Me and you supposed to be, baby

[Chorus: 3LW]
I ain't trippin on your car or where you live
It don't matter if your broke, we'll be struggling
What I'm saying is that I will be your baby
This ain't no maybe
Ain't tryna get my thoughts all in your way
I don't even want your Chipers
(You're the one I wanna kick it wit)
This ain't no maybe, is you feeling me

[Verse: Adrienne]
You'll have to pardon if I come on strong
It's just that you got everything I want
It's your character, the way you be
It's so intriguing to me ,baby
I like your braids and your thug appeal
Keep it real
How's about me and you on the low? What the deal?
Baby, in case you haven't noticed
Without you, boy, I'm so hopeless

[Chorus: 3LW]
I ain't trippin on your car or where you live
It don't matter if your broke, we'll be struggling
What I'm saying is that I will be your baby
This ain't no maybe
Ain't tryna get my thoughts all in your way
I don't even want your Chipers
You're the one I wanna kick it wit
This ain't no maybe, is you feeling me

[Bridge: 3LW]
You make me weak in the knees
I can't sleep, I can't eat
I can't even think, baby
Can't even concentrate
I can't even think straight
See you need a lady
Hey, boy, I wanna be your lady
Let me be your baby
I know that I'm the one for you
Boy, don't you know

[Chorus: 3LW]
I ain't trippin on your car or where you live
It don't matter if your broke, we'll be struggling
What I'm saying is that I will be your, baby
This ain't no maybe
Ain't tryna get my thoughts all in your way
I don't even want your Chipers
(You're the one I wanna kick it wit)
This ain't no maybe, is you feeling me

[Bridge 2/Outro: 3LW]
I wanna be your lady
No actin shady
And I put that on everything
I wanna be your lady
No actin shady 'cause I'm your, baby
And I put that on everything, everything
