Well, I've seen you before
On the discoteque floor
You were driving me out of my mind
Oh, but I could have sworn
That I saw something more
In your eyes

Oh though you were surrounded
By beauty unbounded
Your glance is intended for me
And though I tried to hide it
I found myself lookin' to see

So, then you took your chances
You made your advances
Your touch took my breath away
But when you said hello
Are you ready to go
Well, I had just one thing to say

If you can't give me love
Honey, that ain't enough
Let me go look for somebody else
If you can't give me feelings
With old fashioned meanings
Then just stay in love with yourself

If you can't give me love (love) [x5]

Well, you may be the king
Of this discoteque thing
But honey, I ain't looking for that
What I need is a man
Not some so called aristocrat

Oh if only you'd waited
Or just hesitated
Oh maybe just asked me to dance
But you really don't know
Why I don't wanna go
And baby, that's why we don't stand a chance

So if you can't give me love
Honey, that ain't enough
Let me go look for somebody else
If you can't give me feelings
With old fashioned meanings
Then just stay in love with yourself

If you can't give me love (love) [x5]

Oh, if you can't give me love
Honey, that ain't enough
Let me go look for somebody else
And if you can't give me feelings
With old fashioned meanings
Then just stay in love with yourself

If you can't give me love
Honey, that ain't enough
Let me go look for somebody else
If you can't give me feelings
With old fashioned meanings
Then just stay in love with yourself

If you can't give me love (love) [x8]

Give me love [x4]
(Love) [x4]

Na na na na na love (love) [x2]
