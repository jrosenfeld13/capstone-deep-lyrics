[Verse 1]
From the mystic dreams of nighttime
I saw the clarity of my days
From the shades of longing
Looked for the familiar glow
The death of my wife's slayer
Brought no comfort to me
Now a shape for loneliness
For a dream

[Chorus 1]
A queen of gold I made
A silver bride I built
From the northern summer nights
From the winter moon
Responded not my girl
No beating heart I felt
I brought no sighs to the silver lips
No warmth from the gold

[Verse 2]
Within my heart a flame of desires
Provoked the power of my will
Forced into silvery shape
A golden queen for me
I made our bed under the stars
Covers a-plenty, bear skin hides
Stroked the arc of golden curves
Kissed the lips of silver

[Chorus 1]
A queen of gold I made
A silver bride I built
From the northern summer nights
From the winter moon
Responded not my girl
No beating heart I felt
I brought no sighs to the silver lips
No warmth from the gold

[Chorus 2]
(Queen of gold) I made her
(Silver bride) I built her
(Queen of gold) No warmth
(Silver bride) No love
(Queen of gold) I made her
(Silver bride) I built her
(Queen of gold) No warmth
(Silver bride) No life
