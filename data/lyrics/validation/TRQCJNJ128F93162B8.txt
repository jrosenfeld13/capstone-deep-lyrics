How about my first
Next to your last
Boy i couldn't have done no better
I could dance with you forever
And ever
Baby i don't want to let this go
In your arms is where i feel secure
Oh my heart has never been this sure
Not ever

I've waited forever
For you to love me like i love you
Now that we're together (oh)
All i want is for you

To love me love me
Like you know i love you
Want me, want me
Like you know i want you
Love me, love me
Love me like i love you
Love me like i love you
Love me, love me, like you know i love you
Want me, want me like you know you want to
Love me love me
Love me like i love
Love me like i love

I held my breath
Til i turned blue waiting on you
Had my friends even my family call me a fool (called me a fool)
Cause they don't the eyes to see you for you i saw through
And if it looks so bad
And it hurts so bad
Why's it feel so good?

I've waited forever (oh)
For you to love me like i love you
Now that we're together (oh)
All i want is for you

To love me, love me
Like you know i love you
Want me, want me
Like you know i want you
Love me, love me
Love me like i love you
Love me like i love you
Love me, love me, like you know i love you
Want me, want me like you know you want to
Love me love me
Love me like i love
Love me like i love

Have so much that i want to say
But sometimes words, they get in the way
I don't want to play these games no more (games no more)
Cause i can be your bonnie
If you can be my clyde
Make this last forever cause i'm down for the ride
And even if we fall
I'd rather risk it all
Than say that we never tried

I've waited forever
For you to love me like i love you
Now that we're together (oh)
All i want is for you

To love me love me
Like you know i love you
Want me, want me
Like you know i want you
Love me, love me
Love me like i love you
Love me like i love you
Love me, love me, like you know i love you
Want me, want me like you know you want to
Love me love me
Love me like i love you
Love me like i love you

Oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohh ohh ohh

Love me
Love me like i love you
