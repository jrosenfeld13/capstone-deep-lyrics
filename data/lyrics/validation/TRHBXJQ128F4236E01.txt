Blood flows nerves fire
Lungs take breath yet to expire
Eyes see yet vision is lost
Turmoil soil is tossed

Fooling yourself again
Your soul never ends
Death is inevitable
Clutch your crucible

Hollowed
Dead inside
[x2]

Brain winds down slow
Eyes long since shot
No more life flows
To late mistrust

Why do you suffer
Is so feeble
Seems so impossible
Religion will fall

After death this is your question
Confrontation of your life's end
Horror only thing you find
It was all just lies
Dead inside Hollowwww!!!

After death this is your question
Confrontation of your life's end
Horror only thing you find
It was just lies

Why do your knuckles cling
To such a feeble dream
Seems so impossible
Religion will fall

No wings on your back
Claws dig at your mind
Surrounded with black
Force fed a lie
