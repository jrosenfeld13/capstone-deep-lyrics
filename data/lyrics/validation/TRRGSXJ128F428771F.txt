'Cause I'm sick and tired of running 'round
With all sorts of women, yeah
I just want to settle down with you and only you
I don't wanna be caught out there
With all of those women, no
But I need, I need you to show me your love
(Show me)
Show me
Show me
Show me
Show me
It don't matter if you're gay or live
(Show me)
And it don't matter if you give that a fight
(Show me)
You wear a blue jeans or wearing a dress
(Show me)
I just need to know, right here, right now
(Show me)
Just show me your love
(Show me)
(Show me)
(Show me)
(Show me)
Show me
Show me
I remember days when I used to sit home by myself
Waiting for the phone to ring
Raise your hands, you know what I mean
Just raise your hands and you'll know what I mean, just like that
You see I don't care who's watching us baby
(Show me)
I don't care who's looking, no, no
(Show me)
Because I'm always the last to see the light
(Show me)
You and me together for the very first time
(Show me)
And this is my life, no it's not
Under the bright light
And Lord, it may seem a little bricky
But I'm sure you'll get it too sooner or later, you will
(Show me)
Show me your love
(Show me)
Show me your love
(Show me)
Yeah

Right here, right now
Right here on this floor, oh baby
You see love is like a stereo
You gotta turn it up sometimes for one to hear
Put a little bass in it baby so I can feel
Love will count down, boom, boom, boom, oh yeah
(Show me your love)
Show me, show me
Show me, show me
(Show me your love)
