I roll and I tumble
I cried the whole night long
Yes, I roll and I tumble
I cried the whole night long
I got up this morning
Feeling that something going on wrong
Well now want you to love me baby
Or please let me be
Yes, love me baby
Or please let me be
If you don't like my peaches
Please don't shake my tree
Well, I want you to love me baby
And come on and say you'll be mine
I want you to love me baby
Come and say you'll be mine
If you don't like my potatoes
Please don't dig up my vine
