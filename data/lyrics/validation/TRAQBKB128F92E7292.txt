[Verse 1]
My love she takes a needle and a thread
With a box of cloth she keeps under the bed
And she makes a form where there was none
A house, a square, a star, a moon, a sun
She sews the world with love

[Verse 2]
We sleep beneath a comforter she made
From some old faded jeans of mine she saved
And it warms us on a winter night
And cheers us in the summer light because
Because she sews the world with love

[Bridge]
And if she ever leaves me it'll be her final rest
I'll spend my days knowing that I have loved the best
And if I go before her and leave this world below
I leave my music for posterity
But my love will get my clothes

[Verse 4]
We made a child in the first part of the year
And on a singer's pay we've had our share of fear
We will wrap the babe in swaddling clothes
With quilts and shirts and pants and hats she sews
Oh she sews the world with love

[Outro]
My love she takes a needle and a thread
