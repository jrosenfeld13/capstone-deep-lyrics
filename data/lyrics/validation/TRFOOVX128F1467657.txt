As I wander at the bottom of the sand
The fish tonight swim in melody
Oh these people, we've got to love these people
Cause if we don't they will go away..away

Tell everyone don't be afraid to die
Tell everyone don't be afraid to die
We watch them
We watch them

Tell everyone don't be afraid to die
Tell everyone don't be afraid to die
We watch them
We watch them
