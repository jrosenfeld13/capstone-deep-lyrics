I fell in love with you body and soul
My hands feel sticky and my head's ice cold
My shiver tastes sour and my salt tastes sweet
I wanna lay down but i just can't sleep

It's your voodoo workin
It's your voodoo workin
Round and round same old thing
Heartache misery trouble and pain

It's your voodoo workin
Yeah it's your voodoo workin
Voodoo workin and i can't get enough

Oh.. mmmmm..

Slow down baby yeah
You're goin too fast
Your love is voodoo and
I just can't last
I cried last night and the night before
20 long hours and my eyes are sore

It's your voodoo workin
Yeah it's your voodoo workin
Voodoo workin and i can't get enough
