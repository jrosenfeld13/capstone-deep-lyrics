[Verse 1]
I am a little tin soldier
That wants to jump into your fire
You are a look in your eye
A dream passing by in the sky

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I don't understand
And all I need is treat me like a man
'Cause I ain't no child
Take me like I am

[Chorus]
I got to know that I belong to you
Do anything that you want me to
Sing any song that you want me to sing to you

[Bridge]
I don't need no aggravation
I just got to make you
I just got to make you my occupation

[Chorus]
I got to know that I belong to you
Do anything that you want to do
Sing any song that you want me to sing to you

[Verse 2]
All I need is your whispered hello
Smiles melting the snow nothing heard
Your eyes are deeper than time
Say a love that won't rhyme without words

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So now I've lost my way
I need help to show me things to say
Give me your love before mine fades away

[Chorus]
I got to know that I belong to you
Do anything that you want to do
Sing any song that you want me to sing to you

[Outro]
Oh no no
I just want some reaction
Someone to give me satisfaction
All I want to do is stick with you
'Cause I love you
