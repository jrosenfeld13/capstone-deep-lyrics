Here's to the maker
The film double taker
The illusion type faker
Guaranteed shaker
Paravision viewer

Or it just may seem
Lost the real scope of life
The hope of life
To cope with life
And found it on the screen

And how many times have we heard that line do you think
I'm blind to trade my mind for what you call fine
Never in my time I'm not in your movie

Hey, what can it be on the big white screen
Hey how can you see youre living in 3D

I guess you think you're at the movies somewhere
Stale popcorn don't you stand in your chair stale popcorn
Don't you stand in you chair

A child is influenced by the make believe
To take advantage of this truth is cold hearted sin
So I say to youth right now
Don't sway to the unjust
No matter what they say
Never give in
