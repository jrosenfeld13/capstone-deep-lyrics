Bombing red cross is a crime
Killing sick is not desired
Slaughter is the name of the game
Winning (is) based on the casualties
War is not a crime, but people die
Murdering heroes are praised nationalwide
Arrogance of the armies
Ignorance of living beings
Countries declare a war
Poorest fight the other poor
War is not a crime, but people still die
Murdering heroes praised nationalwide
Rise Of War
Who creates the laws for the wars?
Who made human kind so raw?
How measure the war crimes?
When do we learn to live civilized lives?
Torture is unhuman
Genocide, highest of crimes
Murder in the name of your laws
