Your false laughter echoes
Live cleverly at the utmost
In other words, you should die

I am never satisfied Your false laughter echoes
Live cleverly at the utmost In other words, you should die
Get it warped and twisted, all burned to ashes
Have everything destroyed here
Abandon a pride
Just spit it out
You'll be better off
The truth is crushed
I am never satisfied All is coaxed for a lie
The sky cries
"Can you compensate for my cry?"
It's a merciless wish
The red fruit devoured to the marrow of the bone
Betrayal
Hatred
Chaos
Despair
Sorrow
Rage
Burned in me
Can't let go
Can't take it
Can't break it
Can't lose it
Can't crush it
Can't shred it
The sky cries
"Can you compensate for my cry?"
The cruel reality is, that it's a transitory, foolish
Ignominious and rotten world
In memory, there is that pain we suffered in countless millions
I know it I understand it
That the future just holds darkness
