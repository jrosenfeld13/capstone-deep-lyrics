I realize now
I can't get you back
I pushed you too far away
You're too strong to be led on
And now I know the face
That will haunt me forever
Oh, what have I done
Oh, what have I done

Just please, please promise me
Somewhere dark, deep in your heart
You keep a tiny place for me
Where no one new can reach
Just promise me
Somewhere dark, deep in your heart
You keep a tiny place for me
Where no one else can reach

Promise me
Promise me now
X2

Promise me
