[Verse 1]
Shameless sea
Aimlessly so blue
Midnight-moon shines for you

[Verse 2]
Still, marooned
Silence drifting through
Nowhere to choose
Just blue

[Verse 3]
Ceaselessly
Star-crossed you and me
Save our souls
We'll be forever blue

[Bridge]
Waves roll
Lift us in blue
Drift us
Seep right through
And colour us blue

[Verse 4]
Wait for me
Shameless you, the sea
Soon, the blue
So soon
