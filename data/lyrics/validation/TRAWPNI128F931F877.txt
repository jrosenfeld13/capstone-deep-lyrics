Trouble with girls like you is your so awfully hard to say no to
It's high time that somebody did
So I guess I'm saying no now, I'm amazed that I even know how
I'm shaking just like a kid

You're prettier still than a siren
I'd tell you my name if I had one
The last thing I need is another girlfriend
Two's enough for me, two's enough and you would make three

The trouble with being in love is it's so awfully hard to get out of
You might as well be in jail
The sky's all purple tonight, I'm soaking up the sodium light
Everything is for sale

You're prettier still than an ocean
You'll be better off in the long run
Oh, last thing I need is another girlfriend
Two's enough for me, two's enough and you would make three

Last thing I need, last thing I
Last thing I need, last thing I
Last thing I need, last thing I need
