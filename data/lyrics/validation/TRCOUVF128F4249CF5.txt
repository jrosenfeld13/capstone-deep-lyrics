Did I say I wouldn't be hurt if our love just didn't work?
Did I say that I'd be okay if you said good-bye?
And did I promise you
I could take it if we were through
And forget about these feelings inside?

Baby I lied
When I told you I could walk away
Baby I lied
And forget about the love we made

I swear on my heart
I was telling the truth at the time
Baby I lied
Baby I lied

And did I ever tell myself
I could always find someone else?
Did I say if you left today it'd be no surprise?
Did I ever leave any doubt
I could hold up if you walked out?
I know I told you that I could survive

Baby I lied
When I told you I could walk away
Baby I lied
And forget about the love we made
I swear on my heart
I was telling the truth at the time
Baby I lied
Baby I lied

And now that I can see you walking out of my life
Saying good-bye
I realize
Baby, baby, baby
