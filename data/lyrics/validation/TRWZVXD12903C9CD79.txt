You've been around the block
You've been branded in scarlet
Cigarette burns on your arms
Self-infliction, escape the harm

I can see you touch yourself
Dealing with the cards you're dealt
But you don't have to run away
You don't have to be afraid

Show me how to rise
(When life is kicking you, kick back, don't be a victim of)
Rise above
(The mistakes that were made when you were growing up)

Show me how to rise
(A young child not taught to be an adult)
Remember how to love
(Raise your arms, you're free, don't have to give it up)

Yourself

In the corner, fetal pose
Many friends, but no one knows
Scars imprinted on your life
So your tongue you have to bite

How long will you be this way
With your dual identity
Healing happens with release
Time to stop the wrist that bleeds

Show me how to rise
(When life is kicking you, kick back, don't be a victim of)
Rise above
(The mistakes that were made when you were growing up)
