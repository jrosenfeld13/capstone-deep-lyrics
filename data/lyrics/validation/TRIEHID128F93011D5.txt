Got to find another way out
Another meaning in the little things
Cos in your head everything is crucial
But everything was crucial before you came

Got to find another way out
Another meaning in the little things
Cos in your head everything is crucial
But everything was crucial before you came

You say you're having little heart attacks

If any face, if any gesture
If any one can make you feel a wretch
Go keep on fighting everything you're fighting
Though everyone you're fighting will always be your foe

You say you're having little heart attacks
You say you're having little heart attacks
You know it's meaningless
You're not so shallow
Look at me:
I'm living with the leftovers you left for me

If you don't mind I'll find the way out
I know the meaning in the little things
Cos in my head everything is trivial
Everything is trivial since the day you came

You say you're having little heart attacks
You say you're having little heart attacks
But know it's meaningless
You're not so shallow
Look at me:
I'm living with the leftovers you left for me

Got to find a reason, a reason to forget
Just my bloody luck that you have bust your head
Why the hell I'm singing whatever that I sing
You need to find a way out, you can go through me
Got to find a reason, a reason to forget
Just my bloody luck that you have bust your head
Why the hell I'm singing whatever that I sing
You need to find a reason and the reason's me
