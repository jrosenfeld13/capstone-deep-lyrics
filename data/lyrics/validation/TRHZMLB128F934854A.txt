[Intro: Spoken]
But we're not singing, we're just dancing
Oh, yeah
No, I dont like this one

[Chorus]
People will always call you young
Believing in things that cant be done
People will always call you young
Believing in things that cant be done
People will always call you young
Believing in things that cant be done
People will always call you young
Believing in things that cant be done
People will always call you young
Believing in things that cant be done
People will always call you young
Believing in things that cant be done
People will always call you young
Believing in things that cant be done
People will always call you young
Believing in things that cant be done

[Verse 1]
Last chance saloon at the quarter past the hour
In a hole 'round the corner called the Hunter's Half Moon
There's a struggle for the power of a band and a wagon
A friend that fell off down in Puerto Bans
Near fluent in Italian, a Spanish Brad Stallion
Fought with the courage of a hundred lost galleons
Sank to the bottom of a foreigner's shore
Wind down with Valium and walk to the store

[Chorus]
People will always call you young
Believing in things that cant be done
People will always call you young
Believing in things that cant be done
People will always call you young
Believing in things that cant be done
People will always call you young
Believing in things that cant be done

[Verse 2]
It's the middle of September, I was sitting with a member
Of a band, full of brandy, crew out in the Bush
We're 'bout to play a show and we're hyping their records
That well probably sample, tighten up 'cause they're loose
Its a sing-a-long a sing-song, down an alley ding-dong
Drinking a Berocca, banana-na juice
Im about to go home, Cal, gotta see my friends now
Gotta hang up all my travelling shoes

[Hook]
Running is all that I've got
I feel found in a town when I'm feeling lost
As soon as a girl that I trust
Comes flaunts it around 'til she throws me down
Running is all that I've got
I feel found in a town when I'm feeling lost
As soon as a girl that I trust
Comes flaunts it around 'til she throws me down
Running is all that I've got
I feel found in a town when I'm feeling lost
As soon as a girl that I trust
Comes flaunts it around 'til she throws me down

[Chorus]
People will always call you young
Believing in things that cant be done
People will always call you young
Believing in things that cant be done
People will always call you young
Believing in things that cant be done

[Outro]
Well I say fuck 'em
