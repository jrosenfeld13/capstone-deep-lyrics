Blessed Be The one
The Most Ancient one
Blessed be the one
Who was here before and after remain
Blessed be the meekness of the flesh
I watch as it withers and dies

Come with storm
And blow the flesh from this earth
Come with flood
And wash away the flesh from this earth

The mighty of this world
With the mighty of the flesh
But that of flesh
Is crushed by that of the mountain
For it is written that
The future of flesh is dust
You are but a shell
Your wine something unseen

Come with fire
And burn the flesh of the earth
Make the earth upheaval
May it swallow up the flesh of this earth

Your dreams
Mundane delusions of Malkuth
My dreams
The continuum force that devours all things
Dreams
That eat the flesh and drink the blood
Uruku, my brothers
It is your time to feed

Your will
Empty promises you can't fulfill
My will
Brings avalanches of abundance
Power
Of the Gods circulate within my veins
I lie in wait, wait
Being that erodes all things

Blessed be the ones
The most ancient ones
Blessed be the one
Who was here before and after remain
Blessed be the meekness of the flesh
I watch as it withers and dies

Come with storm
And blow the flesh from this earth
Come with flood
And wash away the flesh
Come with fire
And burn the flesh of this earth
Make the earth upheaval
May it swallow up the flesh of this earth
