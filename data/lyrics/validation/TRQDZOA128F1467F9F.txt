My life is a stereo
How loud does it go
What songs do I know
And what ever happened to my plans
What ever happened to life I thought I'd have

My life is a stereo
Kind of cheaply made though
How bad does it show
What ever did become of all my friends
What ever happened to the likes of all of them

My life is a stereo
Turn me on and let's go
Turn me up louder
I'll scream as loud and clear as I can scream
If you like what you're hearing please hang on to me

I like being here and I'm all hooked up wrong
Hang on to me though I'm one of a million
Please hang on to me

My life is a stereo
Out of phase but you know
Sixty cycles humming
And what ever happened to my friends
What ever happened to the likes of all of them

I like being here and I'm all hooked up wrong
Hang on to me though I'm one of a million
Please hang on to me

And my lights are like candles
I'm so afraid of new technology
I'm in the race and I don't to be
I'm so afraid of what's to come to be
I'm in the race and I don't to be

Life ends in stereo
Pack me up and let's go
Put me anywhere
Please don't think of leaving me behind
Whatever happens to you I'll get on just fine

One of a million
