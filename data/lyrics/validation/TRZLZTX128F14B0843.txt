And will the world see the blind lead the blind
Control their own paths and seek to find
Burden to hold cause of resistance
Weakness revealed turns into failures
Hope is dismissed pushed out from culture
But can the truth speak our sights set high
But is that truth or our demise
Look up
The source
Dismiss
But before, but before
I'm filled I'm filled
Seek see bleed
That weakness focused left to rely
Relies on words spoke is life inside
Reveal
Pure
My savior
Prevails
Seek see bleed prevails
