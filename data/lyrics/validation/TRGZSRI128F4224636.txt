[Aubrey]
This is dedicated to you...

Crossing paths, I saw the past
Realized how good it was

[Shannon]
The smell of your scent, feel of your touch
Memory had me gone

[D. Woods]
But you're with her and not with me now
And I wonder if you think of me, how

[Dawn]
I think of you when I'm lying in bed
And the image of you loving her plays in my head

[Danity Kane]
You messed up and you lost a real good thing
And now you're asking why

You messed up and you lost a real good thing
And now you're asking why

You messed up and you lost a real good thing
And now you're asking why

You messed up and you lost a real good thing
And now you're asking why
