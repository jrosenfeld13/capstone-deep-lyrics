[Intro]
On
Sailing on
To our fate
To India

[Verse 1]
Above the seas, with the wind, we are flying high
Our wings are sails and our trail means no second try

[Pre-Chorus]
Gold and silver, the future will be
When we are at the aim

[Chorus]
Forward
We sail into the unknown
We have no fear, we're sacred
We're going to where no one has gone before
Keep on till we have reached the sunset
There will be no withdrawal
We're heading for the the treasures of India

[Verse 2]
Stars show the way through the night, we don't look behind
Water supply's getting low but we're strong in mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Power and glory will come to us all
When we are at the aim

[Chorus]
Forward
We sail into the unknown
We have no fear, we're sacred
We're going to where no one has gone before
Keep on till we have reached the sunset
There will be no withdrawal
We're heading for the the treasures of India

[Bridge]
Once there was a vision to find a new land behind the horizon
When we chased the sun, a whole new world was born

[Pre-Chorus]
My dearest wishes, they will be fulfilled
When we have reached our destination

[Chorus]
Forward
We sail into the unknown
We have no fear, we're sacred
We're going to where no one has gone before
Keep on till we have reached the sunset
There will be no withdrawal
We're heading for the the treasures of India

[Outro]
On
Sailing on
To our fate
Sailing on

On
Sailing on
To our fate
Sailing on
