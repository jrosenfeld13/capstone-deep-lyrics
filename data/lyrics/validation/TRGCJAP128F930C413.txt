When the skies are wounded
And a beacon's ceased to shine
When dusk is coming all too soon

When we sometimes slip along the way
When we're haunted by a word we should have said
And all the things we should have done

There's a place to lay your head between the sun and moon
Deep within the mind and underneath the skin
Deep within the breath, behind a wakeful eye

Far beyond the sacred ground of an island in the stream
Riding the sea, riding the sea
Toward a secret place where our shadows sleep

When we're hurt, when we freeze
When we get lost on hopeless seas
When all our feelings seem to starve

When there's nothing left to rely on
When we doubt, when we deny
The pulse of sunlight in the ice

There's a place to lay your head between the sea and sky
Deep within the mind and underneath the skin
Deep within the breath, behind a wakeful eye

Floating on a lunar sea of timeless memory
Riding the waves, riding the waves
Deep inside a precious place where our shadows sleep

We stood like statues
In a wall of salt
Unmoved and lost for words
Never to forget

Clouds were drifting floats
On endless midnight waves
We were strangers in the night

There's a place to lay your head between the sea and sky
Deep within the mind and underneath the skin
Deep within the breath, behind a wakeful eye

Floating on a lunar sea of timeless memory
Riding the waves, riding the waves
Deep inside a precious place where our shadows sleep
