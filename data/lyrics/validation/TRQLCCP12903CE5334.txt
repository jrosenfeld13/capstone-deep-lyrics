So tell me pretty baby, are you still talking bout yourself
You're such a non-conformist, just like everybody else
And if you had a heart, tell me would you use it
And if you had a thought, I think you'd confuse it
And if you understood exactly what I'm saying
Would you have the common sense to
Kiss My Ass
Cause I am right
I am right
I am right
I am right

I'd like to take your ego and crush it into a little ball
And then I'd take my baseball bat and knock it over the centerfield wall
Cause if you had a soul, I think you would sell it
And if you had a life, you'd serve your time in hell
Justice can be sweet, power is corrupting
So it would be my pleasure to have you
Kiss My Ass
Cause I am right
I am right
I am right
I am right

And if there was a god, I think she'd give her blessings
To every dirty deed, I would be confessing
So before I knock on heaven's door please grant my last request
Would you be so kind as to
Kiss My Ass
Cause I am right
I am right
I am right
I am right
