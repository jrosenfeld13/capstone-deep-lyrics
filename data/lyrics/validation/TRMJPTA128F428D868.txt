[Intro]
In a world like today
It's a rare occasion to be able to see young mothers
Like the ones that were around when I grew up
But they live on in memory to quite a few of us
And this song is dedicated to those who cherish that memory

[Verse 1]
Early one Sunday morning
Breakfast was on the table
There was no time to eat
She said to me
"Boy, hurry to Sunday school"
Filled with her load of glory
We learned the holy story
She'll always have her dreams
Despite the things
This troubled world can bring

[Chorus]
Oh, Sadie
Don't you know we love you
Sweet Sadie
Place no one above you
Sweet Sadie (well, well, well)
Living in the past
Some times it seems so funny
But no money will turn your life around

[Verse 2]
Sweeter than cotton candy
Stronger than papa's old brandy
Always that needed smile
Once in awhile
She would break down and cry
Sometimes she'd be so happy
Just being with us and daddy
Standing the worst of times
Breaking the binds
With just a simple song

[Chorus]
Oh, Sadie (oh, Sadie, baby)
Don't you know we love you
(She'll love us all in a special way)
Sweet Sadie (well, well, well)
Place no one above you
Sweet Sadie (sweet Sadie livin' in the past)
Living in the past
Oh, she's never sinnin'
In love she's always winnin, yeah

Sadie (My, my, my, my, my)
Don't you know we love you
(I love you, mama)
Sweet Sadie
Place no one above you (I just can't forget)
Sweet Sadie (how you gave me love, oh, Lord)
Living in the past
If there's a heaven up above
I know she's teaching angels how to love

Sadie (It's a mean world without you)
Don't you know we love you
Sweet Sadie (all the love you showed)
Place no one above you (oh, I could never, ever doubt her lovely word)

Sweet Sadie
Living in the past
Ain't it funny that in the end it's not money
It's just the love you gave us all
