[Intro]
First of all, you gotta understand
This album is not about
Me trying to show somebody I can do Reggae music
Or I'm Reggae or anything like that
This song is about is about reaching the masses
You know what I sayin?
As a matter of fact
The whole MVProject is really about
It's not about R. Kelly shinin'
It's about me shinin' the light
On my people in Jamaica with my music
'Cause I got fans there and they love me
You know what I mean?

[Verse 1]
Don't like confrontation
Don't like inconsideration
Don't like false accusations
Can't stand victimization
Don't like starvation
Oh, I never liked discrimination
It's not all about separation
It's about healing the nations

[Chorus]
I like love
I'm all about that thing called love
Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love
I like love
I'm all about that thing called love
Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love
I like love
I'm all about that thing called love
Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love
I like love
I'm all about that thing called love
Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love

[Verse 2]
I don't like aggravation
Don't like humiliation
And I can't stand defamation
And I really don't like temptation
Don't like exploitation
I don't like decimation
It's not about tribulations
It's all about salvation

[Chorus]
I like love
I'm all about that thing called love
Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love
I like love
I'm all about that thing called love
Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love
I like love
I'm all about that thing called love
Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love
I like love
I'm all about that thing called love
Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love

[Bridge]
It's all about love
No matter where I go there's this one thing I know, yeah
It's all about love
City to city when I'm up in the club, yeah
It's all about love
Oh block to block, all around the world, holla
It's all about love
And if you feel me, real people, then put your hands up

[Chorus]
I like love
I'm all about that thing called love
Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love
I like love
I'm all about that thing called love
Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love
I like love
I'm all about that thing called love
Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love
I like love
I'm all about that thing called love
Throw your hands up if you know about that thing called love

[Outro]
Yeah, I hope y'all understand, you know what I'm sayin'
Because there's people out there that
You know, fans out there that'll probably never get to see me
I'll probably never get to see them
But I want them to know that I love 'em
I appreciate them for supporting R. Kelly, you know what I'm sayin'
In different countries, all different cultures, the world
Y'all made me who I am
And I just wanna take this song to say "thank you"
God bless you and your families
Peace
