(Deana Carter/Matraca Berg)

I took your picture off the shelf
Sat down and had myself a good cry
Wrote your number on a bathroom wall
Let somebody else take the fall this time (it's a long way down)
'Cause you wouldn't know a good thing
If it knocked you down, well that ain't my problem now

'Cause I like the way it feels
When I'm making tracks, I'm shooting for the moon
With the sky underneath my wheels
I'm riding on a goodbye train

I'd be better off to try my luck
With somebody who's strong enough to love me (yeah, yeah)
When I look at what I left behind
Freedom looks like a friends of mine, baby (baby)
Ain't nothing like a good change
And it's coming around, yeah
I'm coming around

'Cause I like the way it feels
When I'm making tracks, I'm shooting for the moon
With the sky underneath my wheels
I'm riding on a goodbye train
