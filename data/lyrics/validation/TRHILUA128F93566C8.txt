[Verse 1: Akin]
I heard Akin got the fiends copping real hop and been rocking
Shit hot since Kane, Rakim, Big, Pac and Reebok and
Rob Base's Takes Two.  Strikes hit in Beirut
Crackers in the White House and weak rap that make you
Recognize finally just why y'all rewinding me
Like Cube in the tape deckbet thats what the CYNEll be
Hardcore sonically, circa 80-now shit
All I see: suckand fuck it.  I renounce this
Eight-man, hip hop gorilla, all-monkey type
Shits surrealfor real, Im living in a twilight
Catch me if you can cause, man, Im time bandit
Trapped in Jim Crow South with John Landis
Peace-love nigga, but damn.  I can't stand this
I'd rather talk race, war, sexthats quite candid
Cool nigga who figured Id be the new nigga
No shame or guilt, though.  Casanova thrillmo'
Ladies with they legs widegoodbye to dildos
Yeah, goodbye to dildos

[Hook: Akin]
So what you want?  That music that bump?  Then give it up
For these two niggas at work and bet it up, fucka
Live on the setthats us.  Elephant stomp
You little earthling chump.  And keep it moving like
Them boys dont know how to stop.  So call the cop
Cause a New World Orderwe are
Elephant Rome

[Verse 2: Cise Star]
Spark radiant, shine summer fire that works wonders
He ice-glass prism in the sun that blinds others
The serpent and the rainbowhe bright like Day-Glo
Colors within the black light a price to pay, though
Hes still like three assassinsstance of a dragon
With eyes of brown fire, he breathes with a passion
Deeper than coal minesmy mind is disaster
Fuck up shit like FEMAno help for you bastards
Loves to pick fights with third world regimes
Adult Swim through wet dreams.  Final Fantasy king
Pilot without a jet jet-set, so whos next?
Aviator with legal papers, walking the lineyes, yes
So what's the reason?  Its the focus and thesis
Creativity my deityI worship uniqueness
Searching for peace tearing me into pieces
Its smoke and mirrorsdont fall for cheap tricks

[Hook: Akin]

[Verse 3: Akin]
To my family, I drift apart.  Cant blame it on the art
This music I made my love.  I chose the life.  I was
A schoolboy, big dreaming.  Nave youth gleaming
In me was old souls.  They begged to scroll poems
Inspired by Nasir Jones to write the life unknown
Break from robotic life.  Plus, I'm aquatic type
Free as spring water.  Its like I gotta prove self
So I sing harder.  Hoping Im understood
My time like see-saw.  Paradise
Slice night today and bring war.  Reality.  Therefore
Apologies will go to
Ife, Moji, and Kemi, hug my nephew
Its been a minute
Damn, Rashid Lynns pen handed me ammo
To break out the jungle.  RumbleIm now Rambo
Rounds on my waistlineshoulder kids, scramble
Quick for the fix while you trap stars ramble
On your big yacht, big chainkill sambo
Yall awaited hip hop emancipated
MTV wack rap crack sedated
The souls of black folk sold for gold-plated
Ornament.  Man, peace hip hop belated
Peace hip hop belated
