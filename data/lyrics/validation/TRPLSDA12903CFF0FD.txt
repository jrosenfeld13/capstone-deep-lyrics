Genocide of human kind
To procreate your stinking life
Petrified you watch them die
Unholy terror we apply

Dog

Far from life known to you
Journey into the unknown
Still alive you watch them die
Your holy terror we deny

Closer to the truth
Further from your god

As I walk the shadows
In the valley of death
I shall fear no evil
'Cause evil walks by my side

Genocide of human kind
To procreate your stinking life
Petrified you watch them die
Unholy terror we apply

Closer to the truth
Further from your god
