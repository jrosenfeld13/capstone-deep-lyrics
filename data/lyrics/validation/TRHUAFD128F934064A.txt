Ride rangeland rebel
Ride over the land
Ride to beat the devil
Ride for your own brand
Ride for your own brand

I'm a rangeland rebel
Riding for the lead
I ride to beat the devil
Beat the devil stampede
Beat the devil stampede

Now gather 'round cowboys
Saddle up a good horse
And ride for your land
Or it'll be a golf course
Before they tear down the mountains
And cover the trail
You won't find the bean counters
When the banks start to fail

Ride rangeland rebel
Ride to beat the devil

Dark riders are coming
By the rustlers moon
While the wannabes watch cowboy cartoons
As they're subdividing ranch to ranchette
Some humans are residing with a hangman of death

Ride rangeland rebel
Ride to beat the devil

Ride rangeland rebel
Ride over the land
Ride to beat the devil
Ride for your own brand
Ride for your own brand

I'm a rangeland rebel
Riding for the lead
Try to beat the devil
Beat the devil stampede
Beat the devil stampede

In a high rise in Denver, there's a CEO
Can't wait for the winter
Take your water for snow
He'll charge you for water
He'll charge you for air
Cheat his own son and daughter
For his insider share

Ride rangeland rebel
Ride to beat the devil

You might wake up one morning
And get a big shock
To see the name Ted and Jane on your neighbor's mailbox
But it ain't Ted and Jane's fault
It's the ones who sell out
Put the money in the bank vault
Before they get the hell out

Ride rangeland rebel
Ride to beat the devil

Ride rangeland rebel
Ride over the land
Ride to beat the devil
Ride for your own brand
Ride for your own brand

I'm a rangeland rebel
Riding for the lead
Ride to beat the devil
Beat the devil stampede
Beat the devil stampede

I'm a rangeland rebel
Riding over the land
Ride to beat the devil
Ridin' for my own brand

Ride rangeland rebel
Ride to beat the devil
Ride rangeland rebel
Ride to beat the devil

Save the American cowboy
You better do it now

Ride rangeland rebel
