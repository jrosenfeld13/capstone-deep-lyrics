Like down in ? man oh man
Things be getting stupid
Took everything
Smoked it, looped it
Hundred people speaking
At a hundred miles an hour
At the room at the top
We nearly jumped to the tower
Scenes changing
Nanosecond after nano
We were in a time machine playing the piano
Colors pouring from our heads into the atmosphere
They were going everywhere
Getting there without a care
I swear we weren't enjoying it
See it was out of control man
We were destroying it
I swear we weren't enjoying it
See it was out of control man
We were destroying it
We'll end this demolition with precision
With no more collision
This time we be on our own mission
See we the man
Yeah, got rid of the other kids
And just about only we can live the way we live
We'll take you to the max
Plus a tax and jacks(?)
I'll be back with an ? means you can laugh

Soup or No Soup
Sing your own halleluyah
(Halleluyah)
Soup or No Soup
Sing your own halleluyah
(Halleluyah)
Soup or No Soup
Sing your own halleluyah
(Halleluyah)
Soup or No Soup
Sing your own
(Halleluyah)

Flicking out my blue tounge and catchin' flies
See i was mesmorized by the alphabet
A surprise
So many stories
So enticing
It's like i got out my scizzors
Cut em out like ?
We got out my scizzors
Cut em out like ?
We tend to be more polaroid than paranoid
Tend not to follow decoys
We living in an episoid
Dazed and confused
Came to do anything thats there
Like Peter Selles man
We just like being there
So bring it on
Everything you speak of
There ain't nothing that we gonna keep off
Couting like ?
? ? ?
We drove to San Fransisco in go-karts
More flesh than golden
? ? ?
? ? ?
But by the evening we were off again
Lost again
Stuck on a ship a rasta man

Soup or No Soup
Sing your own halleluyah
(Halleluyah)
Soup or No Soup
Sing your own halleluyah
(Halleluyah)
Soup or No Soup
Sing your own halleluyah
(Halleluyah)
Soup or No Soup
Sing your own
(Halleluyah)

I hear my girlfriend
Is my girlfriend and earthling?
Are we rehersing?
Oh man
Could this be the worst thing?
Was it the time that we played the vegas circuit?
I got all shook up
Yo man, it wasn't worth it
I played a litle black jack in the casino
The man dealing cards, looked like Brian Eno
I ran to tell my bad-bone crew
But by time i got upstairs
They had vacated the room
My newspaper curled across the floor
Dived through the window couldn't take it no more
I pondered for a while in the pain of his torture
Then i ran a bath with the warm water
Saying things like "yeah yeah, fine fine we know"
But time don't go slow when you are living in a peep show
Oh yeah, we know

Soup or No Soup
Sing your own halleluyah
(Halleluyah)
Soup or No Soup
Sing your own halleluyah
(Halleluyah)
Soup or No Soup
Sing your own halleluyah
(Halleluyah)
Soup or No Soup
Sing your own
(Halleluyah)

N.A.D is eating concrete with his teeth
Fucking up the street yet he's having a good week
I drinks a dragon and starts braggin' like im crazy large
So mad drunk, even i dont know where I are
I think im in an aerosol canister
We be dem cowboys falling over banisters
Starting them bar-room brawls
The harder them come, the harder them fall
See just like the movies man
We be like zooming man
We in the room and our microphones be booming
We be tuning
Looking at a loon and swooning
Oh man! i'm even talking to the birds
There's a girl in high-heels standing on my wheels of steel
Saying something about "life can be so real"
She's spinning on a 45
I switch to overdrive
And watch her do a stage dive

(She's got a beautiful smile on her face now
Look at that halleluyah!)

Soup or No Soup
Sing your own halleluyah
(Halleluyah)
Soup or No Soup
Sing your own halleluyah
(Halleluyah)
Soup or No Soup
Sing your own halleluyah
(Halleluyah)
Soup or No Soup
Sing your own
(Halleluyah)
