It's such a pretty world today look at the sunshine
And every day's the same since I met you
It's such a pretty world today knowing that you're mine
And happinsess is being close to you

And though the rain may fall my skies will all be blue
If I look close enough the sun will come shining through
It's such a pretty world today look at the sunshine
Today and every day since I met you
[ steel + guitar ]
It's such a pretty world today...
And though the rain may fall...
