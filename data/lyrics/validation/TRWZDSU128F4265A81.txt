Park Lane Green it`s saturday night
West End Central flashing lights
We`ve come to dance the night away
U.V. dry ice and DJ
Speaker pump that devil sound
Everybody`s getting down
Moonwalk over to the gents
Exit Zombie money spent
Speaker pump that devil sound
Everybody`s getting down
Moonwalk over to the gents
Exit Zombie money spent
Turnstile toilets I joined the queue
Drinks at the bar drugs in the loo
I entered Jekyll and came out Hyde
Mister Chevignons inside
Bouncers Bimbos Lager louts
Zombie dancefloor bugging out
Ball outside the night is still
Smiley moves in for the kill
Bouncers Bimbos Lager louts
Zombie dancefloor bugging out
Ball outside the night is still
Smiley moves in for the kill
Cops and dogs in transit vans
At 4 o`clock we raid clubland
T for Tango through the door
First us two and then you four
West End Central flashing lights
Park Lane Green it`s saturday night
We`ve come to dance the night away
U.V. dry ice and DJ
Speaker pump that devil sound
Everybody`s getting down
Moonwalk over to the gents
Exit Zombie money spent
