See you at a midnight dance
You give me every chance
I should quit, I'm only foolin.'
You will be my precious ruin if I take
One step closer
It's forbidden, I can see
So why were you made for me?
In dreams I'd trade it all
Just to wake, afraid to fall
One step closer
You know me better than I know myself
Still, you keep me on the shelf
Watch you sleeping, watch you wake
Don't know how I can take
One step closer
