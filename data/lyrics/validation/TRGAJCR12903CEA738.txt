I'm breathing, I feel my heart beat
But its been a while, since I've been alive
A new day, I feel a summer breeze
I will let it take me, Wherever it may please

Breaking the promises I've made
Cause I dont thrist for more
Dont hunger like before

I can't pretend another day
I'm not sure no more
That we were fine before?

I'm sorry
I hate to let you down
I know I promised that I'd always be around...

A new day, a chance to start anew
I will try and move on
But I'll remember you
Dont think I can forget
Only I might regret

Breaking the promises I've made
Cause I dont thrist for more
Dont hunger like before

I can't pretend another day
I'm not sure no more
That we were fine before?
