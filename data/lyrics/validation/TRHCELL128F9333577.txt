[Verse 1]
Press here for oxygen
Provided with good intent
Defy inhibition with simple submission of guilt
And a slap on the hand
Put on your high stakes clothes
Pretend that no one knows
That you've got a head on those shoulders

[Chorus]
Talk to me when I'm fast asleep
About the things that you did for me
Here I go

[Verse 2]
Forget the world outside
In search of better lives
Buy three dollar curtains
Slack off and steal cable and binge 'til the end of all time
Put on your business clothes
Pretend that no one knows
That I'm still the burden you shoulder

[Chorus]
Talk to me when I'm rolling deep
About the mess that I've made
Here I go

[Bridge]
Oh God, please bring me down slowly
Oh God, please bring me down slowly

[Chorus]
Talk to me when I'm fast asleep
About the things we could have been
Oh god please bring me down slowly
'Cause I can't take it anymore
