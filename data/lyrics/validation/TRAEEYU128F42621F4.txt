Living day by day. nothing gone my way. fuck your answers, i didn't ask. your the one with the past. better to die than live a fucking lie. tried a life, don't seem right. you're the one who wants to fight. reasons why, its better to die. nothing to gain, nothing to lose. i'm sick inside, i'm sick of you. its better you die than live a fucking lie
