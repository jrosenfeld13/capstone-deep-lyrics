And he opened his mouth in blasphemy deluding their designated god
His men and women all carry a sacrament of his number
These followers with their morality of conscionable age have left behind
The sign of the cross and redemption
They have mindlessly chosen the path of social standards
The path of conformity, with the mark of eternal damnation
"Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb
For the great day of their wrath has come!"
The sixth forewarning trumpet sirens
Following the demonic armies that surface from the open wounds of earth
They march toward bloodshed and warfare against humanity
The limbs and remains from the carcass of man extend across open land
These once depleted seas and rivers now flourish
With vital fluids and the bones of conforming followers
Future existent worlds coalesce into one
