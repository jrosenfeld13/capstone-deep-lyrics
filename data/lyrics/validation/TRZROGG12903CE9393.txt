All we are is all that love brings
We spin as the highest star spins
We get hearts on fire and in love
Sometimes we're too blind to see

And I know now that love sometimes stings
When you're waiting for a telephone ring
And you feel like a lone star spinning
That you might as well give up burning

Don't ask me if I'm still in love
I'm hit by this love song I sing
'Cause you made me feel such a long way away
I know now that love sometimes stings
I've waited for your telephone ring
And you made me feel such a long way away

And all we are is all that love brings
We spin as the highest star spins
We get hearts on fire and in love
And sometimes we're too blind to see

Don't ask me if I'm still in love
I'm hit by this love song I sing
'Cause you made me feel such a long way away
I know now that love sometimes stings
I've waited for your telephone ring
And you made me feel such a long way away
