[Gene Ween]

I'm going crazy
Tryin' to keep you sane
Taking my prescriptions
And forging my name

I was happy this morning
You finally got yourself dressed
Eating raw bacon
It's okay I was still impressed

I love you
Even if you don't
You've got your knife up to my throat
Why do you wanna see me bleed?

Rootin' through the garbage
For treasures in the trash pile
Seeing my expression
Will always make you smile

Please don't touch my phone book
My friends are getting pissed off
You wake 'em in the morning
Acting like a jerk-off

I love you
Even if you don't
You've got your knife up to my throat
Why do you wanna see me bleed?

I love you
Even if you don't
You've got your knife up to my throat
Why do you wanna see me bleed?

I love you
Even if you don't
You've got your knife up to my throat
Why do you wanna see me bleed?

Oooh yeah yeah
