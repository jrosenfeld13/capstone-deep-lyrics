Nothing?
Nothing!

Looking back to the past
Predictions of the end
Unseen ultraviolet rays
Are beating on my head
Nuclear threat - wanna bet? - will be our demise
The day will come when we look to apocalyptic skies

When the news had spread
Soon we'd all be dead
Well it just blew our minds
No one could have guessed
Our worst fears at best
Figments of our time

So it seems that our dreams
Will never come to be
How could such a stupid thing destroy humanity?
A few weeks until extinction, there's nothing we can do
A message sent to other worlds will say:
"It was just the flu"

There's no lesson to be learned
There's no-one left to learn it
