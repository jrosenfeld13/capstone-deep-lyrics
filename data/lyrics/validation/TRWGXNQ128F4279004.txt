There's a handy little firm at the game today
Having a laugh for causing trouble on way
Rucking on the terraces bundles in the street
Fighting for glory in half lit streets
Gonna take away my Id card
But you'll never get me at Scotland Yard

Saturday's Saturday's heroes
Saturday's Saturday's heroes

It's gonna go off in the centre of town
Were the boys know noone shoves you a around
Pulling down fences smashing up bars
Putting out books through brand newcars
Sagostar burst it won't let Tesco
But they never get me on video

Saturday's Saturday's heroes
