[Verse 1]
Completely awake in the back of the car
I don't drift anymore
All's come into place
And I unlock the door
If you have to warm up you can go back inside
But I'm not going to follow forward
I've come to prefer
Sleeping outdoors

[Chorus]
Upstairs and downstairs
And outside on the roof
Small stars and steel bars
Say the ghosts up in the attic tell the truth

[Verse 2]
Standing on shingles at night
Can't you see that there's a reason?
The plans aren't on the ground
They're high and hanging down
Well once I remember the words
We can climb down from the rooftop
I swear that I heard it right here
Invasively clear

[Chorus]
But I was upstairs and downstairs
And outside on the roof
Small stars and steel bars
Say the ghosts up in the attic tell the truth
