So she lay down on the floor
Couldn't stand it anymore
She said so
Another planet for the girl
Another boy against the world
Who almost prayed

And when she says
I want you, boy
Don't lose your head
It couldn't possibly be true

She's the impossible girl
Girl impossible

Bloody Monday afternoon
You want to blame it on the moon
But she says "No, no"
Because there isn't any fair
Because there is no antidote
To her

She calls collect
You cancel everything and yet
Friday she's not there

She's the impossible girl
Girl impossible

She's impossibly beautiful
And she's impossibly something else
Is that her lipstick on your shirt?
Hell, your so mannish, it must hurt

..Another planet for the girl
Another boy against the world

Who almost said
I think I fell in love with you
And then again, my friend
It couldn't possibly be true

She's the impossible girl
Girl impossible
Absolutely sweet impossible girl

Another planet for the girl
Another boy against the world
