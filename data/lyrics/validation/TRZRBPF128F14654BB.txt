(Mr and Mrs Solanas) Cordially request the pleasure of your company
To celebrate their marriage
(Mr and Mrs Solanas) Would like to say you're gathered here today
To pay for your lives, lived in fear and in pain

They carried the artist to the hospital; he was still breathing
I proposed to the assassin almost immediately

(Mr and Mrs Solanas) Request the company of Guy Debord
Michele Bernstein, Raoul Vaneigem
(Mr and Mrs Solanas) R.S.V.P Solanas, star in our wedding video
We dare you to show us your stigmatas

(Mr and Mrs Solanas request the company of...)
Errand boy in high society
Cacographers to the gliterati
Mother, father, thank you for attending
Drink to our happiness, toast our wedding
Folk singers preaching accidental murder
Taunting this gathering of Judas collaborators
Brothers, Sisters, friends and family
We accept your gifts, we accept your cowry

So let bygones be bygones and come to our wedding
I'm not a twisted sociopath, everybody's forgiven

(Mr and Mrs Solanas) Adopting a sick child
As an art experiment in oil and menstrual blood
(Mr and Mrs Solanas) Educate the child in matters of perceived wisdom
Good taste and love

It's unhealthy to be spiteful, it's good to be wise
Always the bridegroom, Always the bride

(Mr and Mrs Solanas) Insist that you attend the brunch meeting of this society
For cutting up marriage
(Mr and Mrs Solanas) Enclose a wedding list
So be tolerant, be persistent, don't give in

(Mr and Mrs Solanas) And try developing thick skin
(Mr and Mrs Solanas)
(Mr and Mrs Solanas)
