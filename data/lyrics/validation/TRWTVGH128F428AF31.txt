You say she wounded your heart
And it's too tender to touch
Oh, baby I know
Words can be sharper than knives
And they can cut just as much
Oh, baby I know
Just like you I've cried alone in the dark
Know how it feels when your love's ripped apart
Jagged hearts are so
Hard to heal I know
Feels like it's gonna go on like this forever
Jagged hearts can mend
Scars can heal and then
It's so amazing when jagged hearts fit together
You feel the ghost of her kiss lingering on your lips
Oh, baby I know
Come lay your troubles to rest
And let me help you forget
'Cause baby I know
Know what it's like when you need to be loved
But it's hard to feel when you're feelin' so good
Jagged hearts are so
Hard to heal I know
Feels like it's gonna go on like this forever
Jagged hearts can mend
Scars can heal and then
It's so amazing when jagged hearts fit together
You can't even tell where we were broken
When we hold each other close
When the pieces fit you know it's
Jagged hearts are so
Hard to heal I know
Feels like it's gonna go on like this forever
Jagged hearts can mend
Scars can heal and then
It's so amazing when jagged hearts fit together
Together
Together
Jagged hearts are so
Hard to heal I know
Feels like it's gonna go on like this forever
Jagged hearts can mend
Scars can heal and then
It's so amazing when jagged hearts fit together
