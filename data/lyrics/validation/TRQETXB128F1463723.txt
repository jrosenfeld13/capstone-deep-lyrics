[Chorus][x2]
Get up, get your man a bottle of red wine
Get up, get your man a bottle of red wine
I can't get up out of bed
With this crazy feeling in my head
Get up, get your man a bottle of red wine

[Verse]
I went to an all-night get-together
And everyone I knew was there
Had the love that would last forever
Everywhere I looked, I saw you standing there

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I said get up right now, oh oh
I said get up right now
Feel so bad this morning, got a terrible headache in my head
Do me a favor, baby, do me a favor please
Please get up, get your man a bottle of red wine
Get up, get up, get your man a big big bottle of red wine
