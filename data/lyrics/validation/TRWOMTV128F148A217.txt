It's the ending of my day
No one left to say goodbye to
Except you: Piano
You're not listenin' anyway
You're not even try to
But here's one for you, Piano:

Seems like it always comes down to me
Spinnin' my piano stool
While you just sit there, grinnin' like a fool

One last song I gotta play
Don't want to keep you up all night though
I make it mezzo piano

Kinda tired in my own way
Tryin' to keep my self upright though:
Just like you, Piano
Just keep smilin' and I'll play this tune for you
Just keep smiling and we'll pull each other through

Softly
We'll play our folding music and we'll fade:
Fade away...
