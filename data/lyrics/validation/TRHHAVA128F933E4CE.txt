Hey you and will you realize
You're about to lose the green eyes
You take her for granted
Now she's tired of the chains

She gives you clues, you're clueless
Tell me why do you do this
You're so bored, she's out the door
You'll never be the same

But I know that you feel so invincible
But you're breaking down tonight

And this is how to lose a girl
This is how you're all lonely
This is how to fall to pieces
This is how to lose it all
And this is how to lose
This is how to pull the best thing in your world
And this is how to lose a girl

You don't know what romance is
Too bad, no second chances
Move on, the moment's gone
There's no one else to play

One day she'll hit the highway
And find me, cause I've been waiting
Right here and I'll wipe her tears
And steal her heart away
I know that you feel so invincible
But you're breaking down tonight

And this is how to lose a girl
This is how you're all lonely
This is how to fall to pieces
This is how to lose it all
This is how to lose a girl
This is how to pull the best thing in your world
And this is how to lose a girl

You ignore her
(Now I'm with her)
And was it worth it
(You deserve it)
And now it's over
(Now he's lost the girl)

Hey you and will you realize
You've lost those perfect green eyes

And this is how to lose a girl
And this is how you're all lonely
This is how to fall to pieces
This is how to lose it all
This is how to lose a girl
This is how to pull the best thing in your world
And this is how to lose a girl
