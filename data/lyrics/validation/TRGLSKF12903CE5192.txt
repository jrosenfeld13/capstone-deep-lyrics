I used to pray, pray to god
Why don't you send me what I ask?

And then she came right out of nowhere
Was like a one in a million chance

She can make it hard for me
She can't make it fair

Though I tried to find a reason
It's not there

She'd be an angel
Straight from heaven
She'd give me all that I demand

And then she changed without a reason
She's someone I just could not understand

Now I know
She can make it hard for me
She can't make it fair

Though I tried to find a reason
It's not there

**********

Why can't I take the half I love
Take it whole, then divide

But now the door is closed behind me
And I will never go back inside

Now I know
She can make it hard for me
She can't make it fair

Though I tried to find a reason
It's not there.....
There.....

She can make it hard for me
She can't make it fair

Though I tried to find a reason
It's not there

She can make it hard for me
She can't make it fair

Though I tried to find a reason
It's not there (x 15 and some)
