I'm gonna follow you
Even when out of sight
Stay here - here in my arms
All the time

I'm gonna follow you
Track you down
Get to You
Whatever the way
I will follow you

Everything's gonna fall
And the seas overflow, yeah
Mountains will crumble down
To the sea

Back in the future
My sweet fatal destiny
Whatever the price
I'll still follow you

Everywhere you go, baby
You know I will follow (I will follow)
Everywhere you go, baby
You know I will follow (I will follow)
I will follow
Follow you, yeah
I will follow
Follow you, yeah
