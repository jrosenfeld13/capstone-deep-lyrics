Perrett

Came round to see me one Saturday morning
I fell outta bed, yawning
They said "we've got reason to believe
And we're gonna take you with us when we leave"

I thought things like this don't happen in real life
Don't ever want you to come over again
Don't feel too good this morning
Here I am sitting in the charge room

Driving through New Cross on the way to town
I had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
Turn around the corner and what d'you think I see?
Sergeant Clark of the SPG

I'm thinking things like this don't happen in real life
Don't ever want it to happen again
Don't feel too good this morning
Here I am sitting in the charge room

I read the police statements, why can't you tell the truth?
What have I ever done to you?
Went before the magistrate, he adjourned the case
And I still don't know what evils I might face

Things like this don't happen in real life
When will it, when will it, will it all end?
Don't feel too good this morning
Here I am sitting in the charge room

That's all I've got to say to you
That's all I've got to say to you, you, you
That's all I've got to say to you, leave me alone
That's all I've got to say to you
Leave me alone, leave me alone
That's all I've got to say to you
Can't you leave me alone?
Leave me alone
That's all I've got to say to you
