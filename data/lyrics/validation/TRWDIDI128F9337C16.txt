Play me a sad song
'Cause that's what I want to hear
I want you to make me cry
I want to remember the places that we left
Lost to the mists of time

I know that you'll go soon
You'll find out so take me with you always
I know that you'll go soon
You'll find out so take me with you always

On buses that move through the night
We sleep on and on
We got off at Memphis
Black-top heat will make us thirsty
We'll never get sick anymore
I know that you'll go soon
You'll find out so take me with you always
I know that you'll go soon
You'll find out so take me with you always
Play me a sad song
'Cause that's what I want to hear
I want you to make me cry
I want to remember the places that we left
Lost to the mists of time
