[verse]
I'm sitting on the edge of the water
Contemplating my strange life
The sun starts to fall into the ground
A breeze picks up off the waves
And everything is fine

[bridge]
Let go of all of your pain

[verse]
I know that I am not alone
Everyone makes mistakes and starts to learn with time
I am content with who I am
There's nothing more I need to say
I'm happy with my life

[Chorus x 2]
Let go of all of your pain
Let go of all of your pain
Let go and you'll escape
You'll be happy with yourself
Let go of all of your pain

[bridge x 3]
Let go
Let go
And release all this pain

[outro]
Let go
Let go
Of all of the pain
