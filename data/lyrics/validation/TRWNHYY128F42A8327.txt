You know you're going to the dance tonight, my dear
'Cause I'm working you're going with the boy I hear
I won't be able to dance with you
But I'll know every little thing you do

I'm on spotlight, baby
I'm working on spotlight, baby

I can see you moving like a candle flickering bright
In my eyes I see you, in my mind it doesn't seem right
I may never be right for you
But every thing I do, I do for you

I'm on the spotlight, baby
I'm working on the spotlight, baby

I'm on the spotlight, baby
I'm working on the spotlight, baby

You know you're going to the dance tonight, my dear
'Cause I'm working you're going with the boy I hear
I won't be able to dance with you
But I'll know every little thing you do

I'm on the spotlight, baby
I'm working on the spotlight, baby
I'm on the spotlight, baby
I'm working on the spotlight, baby
I'm on the spotlight, baby
I'm working on the spotlight, baby
I'm on the spotlight, baby
I'm working on the spotlight, baby...
