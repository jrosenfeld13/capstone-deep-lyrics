Winter's in you

It sneaks out your mouth

Like the snake spits poison

You decide what comes out

There's ice on the path

To your dangerous house

Your heart plays the owl

Mine plays the mouse

Your heart beats cold

And holds

The night shines red

Against the light

It's a matter of time

'Til time's not the matter

'Til all of us mad hatters

Decide to wear our hair when we go

Out there...

It's fine in passing

When it comes with the rest

Yours lasts all year

The winds howl in your chest

Frost makes bones brittle

And soon you will break

And hiss your last curse

When there's no love left to take

Your heart beats cold

And holds

The night shines red

Against the light

It's a matter of time

'Til time's not the matter

'Til all of us mad hatters

Decide to wear our hair when we go

Out there...
