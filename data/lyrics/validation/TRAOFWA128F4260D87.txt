Well everybody's got opinion thats loud and unbending
I spend my time healing and mending together
Its a question of whether live positive, well I give
P-Nut joins our back, must be arthritic
Tim is from the 70s and so we live it
SA has the wisdom of a Noble Laureate
Im down for our days of glory
Its easy to do when youre up with Sexton
A rythmatic genius turnin' up the next one
Would you know, you're a bro I flow in that circumstance
Youll get your chance

Because payback is a motherfuckin' mission
To the sharp-ass rocks slippin' on us but we rock
It comes to writing on us derision
Sendin' you a voice now we're sending you a vision

And those who fought me, they say they taught me everything I know
I go aww, when I hear that, that chit, that chat, bullshit
So sick of me knowing everything, saying

In your face, that's right
And it feels so good
In your face, yeah
And it feels so good

Go Ese
Trip this get up on the tipness
Dont sweat or let it set once you grab it
Come and get some to have and to flaunt
Know about it know I got the news if you want
I pocket I lock it I sock it your mind I rock it
Shell shocked it maybe I groove dammit I know it
F up the truth thats how I show it
In the half light Ese sounds Nicks a night light
Im rappin hes snappin on
Something you might like now
Dont frown if I chose to
Cut it up brothers you cant take it with you
Just take a moment to have a fit once in a while
I do it daily and like it but thats my style, here I go

In your face, that's right
And it feels so good
In your face, yeah
And it feels so good

Won't you warm the mic, Nicholas
Can't get with this, my stream of consciousness is a sea
Much like Bukowski with a rage
Speaking to the page beasts in the cage
Jumping off the stage, diving
Thriving, striving, for a better day SA
Beat back by flesh shattered doors
Bragging fists to the sky youre feelin high
Yes to live and die

Just take a moment to have a fit once in a while
I do it daily and like it but thats my style, here I go
In your face
Feels so good
In your face
Feels so good
