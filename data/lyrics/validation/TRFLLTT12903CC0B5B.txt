Get out my life woman
You don't love me no more
Get out my life woman
You don't love me no more
Get out my life woman
You don't love me no more

Get out my eyes teardrops
I got to see my way around
Get out my eyes teardrops
I got to see my way around
Get out my eyes teardrops
I got to see my way around

Get off my ladder, woman
I got to climb up to the top
Get off my ladder, woman
I got to climb up to the top
Get off my ladder, woman
I got to climb up to the top

Get out the way, woman
I got to be movin' on
Get out the way, woman
I got to be movin' on
Get out the way, woman
I got to be movin' on
