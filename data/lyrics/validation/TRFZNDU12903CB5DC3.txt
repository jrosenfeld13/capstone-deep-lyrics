Lay down boys, and take a little nap
Snow knee-deep in Cumberland Gap

Cumberland Gap's a devil of a place
Couldn't find water to wash my face

Me an' my wife an' my wife's pap
Walked all the way from Cumberland Gap

Pretty little girl, if you don't care
I'll leave my demijohn a-sittin' right there

If it ain't here when I get back
I'll raise hell in Cumberland Gap

Lay down boys, and take a little rest
We'll all wake up in a whippoorwill's nest
