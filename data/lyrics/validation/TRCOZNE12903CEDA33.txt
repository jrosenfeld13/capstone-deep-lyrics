Sun was out
The fish were swimming
In choke polluted water
All the fishes
Dying from them toxic
Seebees dumpin in our stream
But we didn't give a fuck
Ya know we had some
Cheap american brews
Ya know some nice hot dogs
Figured ya know...get out the
Little transistor radio
Sit back relax have a nice
Little summer barbecue

It's a beautiful
What a beautiful
It's a beautiful
Beautiful day
FOR A BARBECUE!

Well uh
We uh sat back
And down and looked into the air
All the sudden
Said, WHAT'S THAT IN THE SKY?
Is it a bird or a plane!?

Steaks are done come and get em
No one miss a barbeque
Big fat sow sizzling and dripping
Archie meyer-we thank you!
For a beautiful
It's a beautiful
It's a beautiful-beautiful day!
It's a beautiful
It's a beautiful
It's a beautiful-beautiful day!

For a barbecue!
This time the hot dogs is you
Oh wow man, that makes me think of karma

Well as those first bombs start dropping
We wondered, where the hell is that transistor radio!
You know, turn on what the newsman has to say
About one of those a-rab countries talkin 'bout a
FAILED NEGOTIATION?!

It's a beautiful
It's a beautiful
It's a beautiful-beautiful day!

For a barbecue!
