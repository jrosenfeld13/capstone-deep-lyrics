I buy her all the right clothes and pretty jewels to wear
My friends say she's a dumb blonde but they don't know she dyes her hair
She thinks the fighting in Central America's easily solved
But what to wear to Bel Air premieres is a problem she could never resolve

[Chorus]
She's an airhead
Stungun and mace, Kharmann Ghia plates say "Lost in Space"
She's an airhead
Thousands in trust, cusp aquarius, get serious
She's an airhead
Tinted contacts don't change the fact that black is black
She's an airhead
And while I'm impressed with the length of those legs
She's not an intellectual giant

She'd like to model, or maybe act, or start a magazine
Before she signs any big contracts, she better learn to read
But in her dreams she's the queen of the fashion regime

You ask me do I love you, does the Pope live in the woods? Quod
Erat Demonstrandum, baby. ("Ooh, you speak french")

[Chorus]
She's an airhead
Stungun and mace, Kharmann Ghia plates say "Lost in Space"
She's an airhead
Thousands in trust, cusp aquarius, get serious
She's an airhead
And while I'm impressed with the size of that chest
She's not an intellectual giant

Sweet and low and oh-so, little Ms. Dora Jarre
Safe sex and fishnets and could you walk me to my car, pa
She's losing faith in a world that is out of control
So she's gonna nix politics, she's taking up volleyball
Volleyball, why?

Cause she's an airhead
Stungun and mace, Kharmann Ghia plates say "Lost in Space"
She's an airhead
Thousands in trust, cusp aquarius - get serious
She's an airhead
And now the time's come for the end of my song
Don't get me wrong

If she's an airhead, it has to be said
It was men made her that way
It was us made her that way
It was us made her that way

Oh airhead
