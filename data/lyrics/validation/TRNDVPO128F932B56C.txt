(Summer love)
Ooh from the moment the sun comes out
You are on my mind
(Oh summer love, summer love)
I tried to forget
But nothing comes of this
Every time I close my eyes
I can still feel your kiss
I push you from my mind
But then you creep back on
People make it seem
Loving you is a sin
(You say)
That its all gone
(Saying it's all gone)
(But baby)
You are wrong
(Baby. you are wrong)
(This love)
Is way too strong
(Love is way too strong)
Can't let you go
My summer love, oh
Summer love, oh
Summer love, oh
Summer love, oh
And maybe they are right
I'm a fool for giving in
But I miss you, baby
When you're not here
(When you're not here)
I trusted you cause you made me
And I thought when I feel (Coin yeah)
You'd save me, baby
(*Repeat)
(*Repeat 2 times with ad lib)
Break it
Break it down
Break it down, coin
They say that you're no good
But you're my summer love. you are
(You say) That it's all gone
(Saying it's all gone)
(But baby)
How wrong you are
(Baby, you are wrong)
(This love)
Is way too strong
(Love is way too strong)
And now I can't let you go
(** Repeat to end with following)
Ooh summer love, summer love
Summer lover, summer lover
Baby, baby, don't want to say goodbye
Baby, stay by my side, baby
Take me and hold me
Take me, baby, take me, baby Ooh my love, my love
