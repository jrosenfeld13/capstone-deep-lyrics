I know everything you're doin baby
And I know every game you're runnin
You must think that I am blind
Cause it's right before my eyes
So don't get it twisted baby

Don't say that I got it wrong
Cause there's just no way out for you this time
And don't say that our love is strong
Cause we both know you want to crawl
Back under the rock you came from
And hide away

I'm telling you got it twisted baby
Cause you're not the one who I'll be missin
I'm not broken up this time
Got another one in mind
So don't get it twisted baby

See I'm not just gonna sit and take this lady
And I'm not gonna let you play me
So don't even try and fight
Cause you're gonna only lose tonight
So don't get it twisted baby

It won't be too long
Till you're wonderin'
How you got yourself left behind
It won't be too long
Till I'm watching you crawl
Back under the rock you came from
To hide away

You know it's time for me to rearrange
What was between you and I
So don't think that you can just
Play your lies away
I've thrown your love away
