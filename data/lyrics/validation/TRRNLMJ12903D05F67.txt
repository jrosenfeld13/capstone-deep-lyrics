My soul is a desert
When nothing is comfort
Sheltered from chaos
And sheltered from you

Can't feel you anymore
Don't need you anymore
Don't believe you anymore
I don't need you anymore

Enough with temptations
Illusions are evil
We exist in confusion
Soulless and vain

Can't feel you anymore
Don't need you anymore
Don't believe you anymore
I don't need you anymore

It's broken me down now
This hurts and it's hopeless
Can't look to the future
The window is stained

Can't feel you anymore
Don't need you anymore
Don't believe you anymore
I don't need you anymore

I don't need you anymore, I don't need you anymore
I don't need you anymore, I don't need you anymore
