At every bus stop, city streets and on the rooftop
Selling things you've already got, but I can't say "no"
Rubbish tips, filled up with last year's hits
Was on top but now in the pits, and that's how it goes

Throw it away when you're done
Throw it away when you're done
Throw it away and go and get a new one

I'm not too blind to see, they put a spell on me
Somebody call the doctor quick, is it me or the world that's sick?
My soul just went on sale, and everything must go

Got a little but you want a lot
You either have it or haven't got
So don't be stopping or you'll fall and drop
So don't let go

So I make my cash, spend it all on soon-to-be trash
Before I know I got quite a stash and it's starting to grow

Throw it away when you're done
Throw it away when you're done
Throw it away and go and get a new one

I'm not too blind to see, they put a spell on me
Somebody call the doctor quick, is it me or the world that's sick?
My soul just went on sale, and everything must go
C'mon it's time to throwitaway
