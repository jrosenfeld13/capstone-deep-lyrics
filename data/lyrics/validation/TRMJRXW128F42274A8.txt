Oh, don't you want to go
Oh, to the time when we were bored and happy
Oh, don't you want to go
To the time when all the plans we'd make were laws we had yet to break

Hold on, hold on to that beautiful mess, when we still loved us
Hold on, so long

Oh, don't you want to go
Oh, to the time when we were older and surer
Oh, don't you want to go
To the time when all the plans we'd make were laws we had yet to break
