My baby a kind hearted woman
So lovely and so sweet she's so kind
Yeah she's a kind hearted woman
So lovely and so sweet she's so kind

She's got such a cool disposition
She just makes me love her all the time
She got me doin' things
Peoples I just can't sleep at night

She got me doin' things
You know boys I just can't sleep at night
I don't eat my breakfast in the mornin'
And my teeth and tongue begin to fight

Yes, she's 41 through the shoulders
29 in the waist

I'll never find another woman
To take my baby's place

She's so lovin'
She's so sweet she's so kind
She's got such a cool disposition
Makes me love her all the time
