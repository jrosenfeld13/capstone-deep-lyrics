[Verse 1]
I can't imagine how hard it must be to be you
Adopting all your history it's hard being me too
Are your secrets where you left them?
Because now your ghosts are mine as well
I think it's time I met them and I think it's time you tell
And you should have told me when you met me all these things I should know
And I should have asked we should have talked about this so long ago

[Pre-Chorus]
It's not fair, it's not fair, you don't need me here
Oh, how's this happening to me? It feels so lonely here

[Chorus]
We are in a mess, a danger zone
What will happen next? You never know
We are in a mess, a danger zone
What will happen next? You never know

[Verse 2]
Now we share the closet, now you've let me come inside
And now you're finally undressing and I feel like I might die
The damage is infectious, the confession is too late
And how can I accept this? How is this happening to me?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's not fair, it's not fair, help me come up for air
Oh, how's this happening to me? It feels so lonely here

[Chorus]
We are in a mess, a danger zone
What will happen next? You never know
We are in a mess, a danger zone
What will happen next? You never know
You never know
You never know

[Spoken Interlude]
All your secrets
All your lies
All of it

[Chorus]
We are in a mess, a danger zone
What will happen next? You never know
We are in a mess, a danger zone
What will happen next? You never know
We are in a mess, a danger zone
What will happen next? You never know
We are in a mess, a danger zone
What will happen next? You never know

[Outro]
How could this be happening to me?
