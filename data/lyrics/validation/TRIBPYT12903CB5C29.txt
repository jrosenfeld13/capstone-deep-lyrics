And I'm waiting for the day
I know you've got your part
And I'm waiting for the day
I know you'll have the heart

And I'm hoping that you'll say
That you loved me all this time
But it turns out just the same
And you break apart the things I find

Hold On, what did you say that for?
Hold On, what did you say that for?
Hold On, what do you take me for?
Hold On, what did you say that for?

And I'm waiting for the day
Inside my mother's clothing store
And I'm waiting for the day
What am I waiting for?

Hold On, what did you say that for?
Hold On, what did you say that for?
Hold On, what do you take me for?
Hold On, what did you say that for?

Hold On, what did you say that for?
Hold On, what did you say that for?
Hold On, what do you take me for?
Hold On, what did you say that for?
