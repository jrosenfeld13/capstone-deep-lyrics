This little one tries as hard as she can
Do anything just so she could fit in
She wants a friend so bad she'll do whatever they tell her
To make them smile she would misbehave
But all the while they would laugh in her face
She begins to cry because she thought that they liked her

Even though you feel all alone
It can't rain everyday
It don't rain forever
Your sunshine may be gone but i know
It can't rain everyday
It don't rain forever

He works hard everyday of his life
For his son on the way and his beautiful wife
But today he got a call from his job they got something to tell him
They laid him off now he's out on the streets
He's got to do what it takes so his family can eat
He can't even look at his wife because he feels like he failed them

[Chorus]
Rain down! rain down! rain down! so let it rain down!
Rain down! rain down! rain down on me now!

A young lady's been lost for awhile
But that's ok now she's having a child
She finally got what she wants. she's got someone who loves her
But this morning she woke up in pain
Nobody had to tell her because she knew right away
So she started to cry because she won't be a mother

[Chorus]
Rain down! rain down! rain down! rain down on me!
Rain down! rain down! rain down!
