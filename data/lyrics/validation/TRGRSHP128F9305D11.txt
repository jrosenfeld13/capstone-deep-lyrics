For so long
I have been so alone
Since you went away
For so long
I have been so alone
Since you went away
My life has change
You told me
Told me that I am not
The one you wanna hold
Near your heart
But how can it be so
You know yet at all
Always remember when we feel in love
Nothing kept us apart no

Oh saturday night
My heart was running in to love at first sight
You turn me round
You made me weaker
Oh what a saturday night
Whoh oh oh
What a saturday night
We walk together and I held you so tight
You said that this would last forever
Oh what a saturday night

The time came
The time for me to realise
I had to let you go
But my heart said no no
But how can it be so
You know yet at all
Always remember when we feel in love
Nothing kept us apart no

Oh saturday night
My heart was running in to love at first sight
You turn me round
You made me weaker
Oh what a saturday night
Whoh oh oh
What a saturday night
We walk together and I held you so tight
You said that this would last forever
Oh what a saturday night

How love can turn you round and round
But I know some day
Love will find a way

Ohhh

Saturday night
My heart was running in to love at first sight
You turn me round
You made me weaker
Oh what a saturday night
Whoh oh oh
What a saturday night
We walk together and I held you so tight
You said that this would last forever
Oh what a saturday night

Ohhh...

What a saturday night
Oh what a saturday night
