[Verse 1]
I'm a cold heartbreaker, fit to burn
And I'll rip your heart in two
And I'll leave you lying on the bed
I'll be out the door before you wake
It's nothing new to you
'Cause I think we've seen that movie, too

[Chorus]
'Cause you could be mine
But you're way out of line
With your bitch slap rapping and your cocaine tongue
You get nothing done
I said, you could be mine

[Verse 2]
Now, holidays come, and then they go
It's nothing new, today
Collect another memory
When I come home, late at night
Don't ask me where I've been
Just count your stars I'm home again

[Chorus]
'Cause you could be mine
But you're way out of line
With your bitch slap rapping and your cocaine tongue
You get nothing done
I said, you could be mine

You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine, mine, mine ,mine

[Bridge]
You've gone sketching too many times
Why don't you give it a rest?
Why must you find another reason to cry?

[Solo]

[Bridge 2]
Well, you're breaking down my back and I've been racking out my brain
It don't matter how we make it, 'cause it always ends the same
You can push it for more mileage, but your flaps are wearing thin
And I could sleep on it until morning, but this nightmare never ends
Don't forget to call my lawyers with ridiculous demands
An' you can take the pity so far, but it's more than I can stand
Cause this couch-trip's getting older
Tell me how long has it been?
'Cause 5 years is forever, and you haven't grown up yet

[Chorus]
You could be mine
But you're way out of line
With your bitch slap rappin' and your cocaine tongue
You get nothing done
I said, you could be mine
You should be
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
Yeah
