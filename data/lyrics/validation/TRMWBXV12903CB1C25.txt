[Verse 1]
I love a lassie, a bonnie Hieland lassie
Could you see her you would fancy her as well, haha
I met her in September, popped the question in November
I'll soon ha'e her all to myself
Her faither has consented, I'm feelin' quite contented
I've been and sealed the bargain wi' a kiss
I sit and weary, weary, when I think about my dearie
And you'll always hear me singing this

[Chorus]
I love a lassie, a bonnie, bonnie lassie
She's as pure as the lily in the dell
She's as sweet as the heather
The bonnie purple heather
Mary, ma Scotch bluebell

I love a lassie, a bonnie, bonnie lassie
She's as pure as the lily in the dell
She's as sweet as the heather
The bonnie purple heather
Mary, ma Scotch bluebell

[Verse 2]
I love a lassie, a bonnie Hieland lassie
She can warble like the mavis in the dell
She's an angel ev'ry Sunday, but a jolly lass on Monday
She's as modest as her namesake the bluebell
She's nice and neat and tidy and I meet her ev'ry Friday
That's a very special nicht I wouldn't miss!
I'm enchanted, I'm enraptured since ma heart the darlin' captured
She's just intoxicated me with bliss

[Chorus]
I love a lassie, a bonnie, bonnie lassie
She's as pure as the lily in the dell
She's as sweet as the heather
The bonnie purple heather
Mary, ma Scotch bluebell

I love a lassie, a bonnie, bonnie lassie
She's as pure as the lily in the dell
She's as sweet as the heather
The bonnie purple heather
Mary, ma Scotch bluebell

[Verse 3]
I love a lassie, a bonnie Hieland lassie
I could sit and let her tease me for a week
And the way she keeps behavin', why, I never pay for shavin'
For she'll rub my whiskers clean off with her cheek!
In the gloamin' wi' my beauty, wi' my bonnie tutti-frutti-hooty
I like to wander by her side
She's my diamond, she's my ruby, she's my bonnie wee jujube
And if she were here I'd revel in the pride

[Chorus]
I love a lassie, a bonnie, bonnie lassie
She's as pure as the lily in the dell
She's as sweet as the heather
The bonnie purple heather
Mary, ma Scotch bluebell

I love a lassie, a bonnie, bonnie lassie
She's as pure as the lily in the dell
She's as sweet as the heather
The bonnie purple heather
Mary, ma Scotch bluebell
Haha! Mary, ma Scotch bluebell!
