Do you know what you're fighting for?
Have you the burn of the aching for
Something different, something spiritually
Understood in every way

Hard face, no shine
Hard heart with a narrow mind
Blank and shallow, lacking color
Lacking faith that there is another
Way to live, way to breathe
A way to walk, a way to see
Not in alliance, but in defiance
Of the hatred we're taught to breed

I see a clear line drawn
A generation that's gone wrong

Have you found what you're looking for?
Have you the burn or the lack thereof
For something different, something you're meant to be?
Do you know what you're looking for?

I see a clear line drawn
A generation that's gone wrong
I see a back that's turned
To what we're searching for

What you're taught and what we're beckoned to
Is not absolute, so why follow what we don't know?
You are your own, weighted and balancing
Judgement of truth when the ego has been let go
