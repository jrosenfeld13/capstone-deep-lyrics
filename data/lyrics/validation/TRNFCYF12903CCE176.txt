Blossom, routinely;
Blossom, without habit...

So as
The violins trill
Embellishes a melody
Without touching it

He gave (a)
Date to the world
And every year he respects it

He respects it as he
Blossoms
On an effort, masking it by grace

And now your pledge
Is in my
Olfaction
This is the difference:
Perfume flies (away)
While the smell
Endures...

(Theres) no time for describing
Now its time to feel
Thanks
For being on time
To fill, to soak
My earth of yourself

As families do
With (their) dresses
Fill my earth of yourself!

A flower for my
Land
