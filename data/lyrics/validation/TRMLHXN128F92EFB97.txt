Kill that romantic
A perfect end to a perfect criminal
Go on pretending
You think you know everything anyway
A drink for your troubles
A drug to numb the pain away
We love like devils
Your view is all so alien
Oh, let's go to the music show
Where the lovers all dance to the song we wrote
I swear it moved me, moved me
I swear it moved me, moved me
Let's go to the music show
Where the lovers all dance to the song we wrote
I swear it moved me, moved me
I swear it moved me, moved me

Your ship is sinking
Faster than the sun will rise
Your ship is sinking
Faster than the sun will rise
