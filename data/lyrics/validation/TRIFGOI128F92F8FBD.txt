I'm seeking everyday
Looking at the sky
Ever wondering why
I dream my dream's away
And I'm living for today
In my mind's eye

Things are clearer than before
Showing me the way
Asking me to stay
I'll never close the door
To all this things and more
In my mind's eye

Everybody I know
Saids I've changed
Laughing behind their hands
I thing their strange

People running everywhere
Running through my life
I couldn't give a care
Because I couldn't see
All that I can see
In my mind's eye

In my mind's eye
