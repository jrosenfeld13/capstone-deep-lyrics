Dead Eyes in hollow shells
A distant rumbling in this hell
Clinging to existence, infected lives
Fungus of humanity in decay thrives
How morbid you are in total failure
A leading star; but also descending
Formless, disengaged and mordant in reason
(by all means) vindicate your action
But we see your ending
Isolated and dead congregation
No longer in exile or hibernation
An epach is over, rejoice, rejoice!
Prepare for a head count of our enemies loss
No room for believers or erratic behavior
Rid the world of this pestilent plague
In times of enlightment they've been outspoken
You have conquered the throne of damnation
All there is to inherit; a worlds demise
You have conquered the throne of damnation
Crown yourself king of everything despised
Throne of damnation
Souls of damnation
