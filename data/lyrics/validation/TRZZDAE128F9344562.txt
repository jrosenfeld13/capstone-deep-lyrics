I, I walked along
And I wound my way round
I, I saw a light
Shining bright
I, I'm not sure
Is it too late to call?
So I keep my eyes
To the floor
Oh I, I can't carry
This load anymore
Oh I'm so afraid
To call on your door
Feeling so alone
Along a lonely road
Feeling so alone
Well I'm comin' back
I, walked along
The water's edge
I, saw my reflection
Stare back
I, don't know
Where I'm going
But I know
Where I've been
Some days I don't fit
In my own skin
Oh I, I can't carry
This load anymore
Oh I'm, so afraid
To call on your door
Oh I, can't carry
This load anymore
Oh I, I'm comin' back
Comin' back
