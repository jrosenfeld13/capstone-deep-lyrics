Land of anger
I didn't ask to be born
Sadness, sorrow
Everything so alone

Laboratory sickness
Infects humanity
No hope for cure
Die by technology

A world full of shit coming down
Tribal violence everywhere
Life in the age of terrorism
We spit in your other face

War of races
World without intelligence
A place consumed by time
End of it all

We're born
With pain
No more
We're dead
Embryonic cells

Corrosion inside - we feel
Condemned future - we see
Emptiness calls - we hear
Final premonition - the truth

Land of anger
I didn't ask to be born
Sadness, sorrow
Everything so alone

Laboratory sickness
Infects humanity
No hope for cure
Die by technology

We're born with pain
Suffer remains
We're born with pain
Suffer remains
We're dead
