Down in the lowlands
Won't you save me?
Save me
Hear my cry, oh
Won't you save me?
Save me

The water is up to my neck; I'm sinking in the deep
There is no foothold to be found anywhere
I'm very worn out from calling for help
My throat is hoarse, and dry as a bone
My eyes, they fail me from looking for you
Are you looking for me?

Down in the lowlands, where the water is deep
Hear my cry, hear my shout
Save me, save me
Down in the lowlands, where the water is deep
Hear my cry, hear my shout
Save me, save me

Could this be it?
Could I be drowning?
Have I failed to be heard by the only one who can save me? (save me, save me)
Show me some mercy, and touch me again
Please lift me up above where I am

My eyes, they fail me from looking for you
My eyes, they fail me from looking for you
Are you looking for me?

'Cause I'm down in the lowlands, where the water is deep
Hear my cry, hear my shout
Save me, save me
Down in the lowlands, where the water is deep
Hear my cry, hear my shout?
Save me, save me
Down in the lowlands, where the water is deep
Won't you hear my cry and hear my shout?
Save me, save me

My eyes, they fail me from looking for you
My eyes, they fail me from looking for you
Are you looking for me?

Down in the lowlands, where the water is deep
Hear my cry, hear my shout
Save me, save me
Down in the lowlands, where the water is deep
Hear my cry, hear my shout
Save me, save me
Down in the lowlands, where the water is deep
Won't you hear my cry, and hear my shout
Save me, save me
Down in the lowlands, where the water is deep
Hear my cry, hear my shout
Save me, save me

Show me mercy, Lord, (save me)
Touch me where I am
Show me mercy, Lord, (save me)
Touch me where I am
Oh won't you show me mercy?
Show me mercy, Lord
Lift me up, and lift me out from where I stand
