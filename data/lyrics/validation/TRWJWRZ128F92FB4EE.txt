She moves and speaks with so much grace and poise
It's as if she's on stage
She flirts like crazy and really enjoys it
Should never ask her age

She always carries her iBook but she
Never seems to work
Things aren't always that clear cut, she
Tells you when to smirk

Now you want her even though
She's obviously not your style
Everybody wants to know
The girl with the curious smile

When she invites you to stay
That's your signal to go
You don't wanna hear what I say
But believe me, I know

Now you want her even though
She's obviously not your style
Everybody wants to know
The girl with the curious smile
