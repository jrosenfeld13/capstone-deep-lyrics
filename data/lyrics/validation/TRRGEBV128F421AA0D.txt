[Verse 1]
Violet softly stirring morning-time
Then the edge of evening too
Blaze a blanket out across the sky
Covering everything within her view

[Verse 2]
Violet raise from your [?] first appear
Makes me wanna see you more
Orange and purple clouds will hold you near
When you have to leave just like before

[Chorus]
Catching those waves to come
Until they're all gone
What's the sun been trying to do?
I'll stay and talk awhile
After [?]
Before you turn back into blue

[Verse 3]
Violet, your vibration feels
Like a touch that I once knew
They say that you're the highest light of all
And you get to be a flower too

[Chorus]
Catching those waves to come
Until they're all gone
What's the sun been trying to do?
I'll stay and talk awhile
After [?]
Before you turn back into blue
