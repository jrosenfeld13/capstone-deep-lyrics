It's time to pack up all the dreams and walk away
No matter what our hearts might say
Now we know we're at the end of a love so it's foolish to pretend why try
We cried clinging to each other tenderly we were the best that we could be
Through the sweet and gentle years and now after all these tears we cried
Love knows we tried
Love knows we tried we gave it all we had and more
Love knows we tried we've got the memory and someday we may see
Goodbye doesn't mean we really didn't try so you can hold your head up high
And as I walk away from you knowing well we did all that we could do inside
Love knows we tried
Oh love knows we tried...
Love knows we tried love knows we tried
