Ooh, a storm is threat'ning
My very life today
If I don't get some shelter
Ooh yeah, I'm gonna fade away

War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away

Ooh, see the fire is sweeping
Our very street today
Burns like a red coal carpet
Mad bull lost your way

War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away

[Guitar Solo]

Rape, murder!
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
Rape, murder!
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
Rape, murder!
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away

Mmm, the floods is threat'ning
My very life today
Gimme, gimme shelter
Or I'm going to fade away

War, children
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away
It's just a shot away

I tell you love, sister
It's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away, (kiss away kiss away)
