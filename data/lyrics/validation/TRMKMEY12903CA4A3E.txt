[Intro]
Hello? - Remember me? - Who's there? - I got your number!
Oh no no! - I'm back to haunt you! - No stay away!

[Verse 1]
It's Friday night so creepy outside
It's thundering and lightning
There's nobody home cuz I'm all alone
It's scary and it's frightening
The sound of shoes
A shadow that moves
Something odd is tick-tock-ticking
Someone's in here I'm so full of fear
The telephone is ringing!

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I can see you - Oh no please no
Now I can touch you - Oh god please don't
I'm right here now - Oh please tell me where
Hahahahahaha - I'm in a nightmare
You better run I'm back to hunt you down

[Chorus]
Halloween in the dead of the night hear me scream
I'm coming, I'm coming
Halloween is the fear that I fight in my dreams
Keep running, Keep running
Just keep running, oh keep on running girl, just keep running

[Verse 2]
Hell broke out this Friday night, zombies passing deadly
My candyman from bounty land is coming here to get me!

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I can see you - Oh no please no
Now I can touch you - Oh god please don't
I'm right here now - Oh please tell me where
Hahahahahaha - I'm in a nightmare
You better run I'm back to hunt you down

[Chorus]
Halloween in the dead of the night hear me scream
I'm coming I'm coming
Halloween is the fear that I fight in my dreams
Keep running Keep running
Just keep running, keep on running girl, just keep running

[Bridge]
Squeaking and Creaking I move silent in the night hahaha
Could be the boy next door you'll never guess my disguise
Chains and children fight
Pumpkin and candlelight
You might be the chosen one at junior high tonight!

[Chorus]
Halloween in the dead of the night hear me scream
I'm coming I'm coming
Halloween is the fear that I fight in my dreams
Keep running Keep running
Halloweeennnn
Just keep running, oh keep on running girl, just keep running
