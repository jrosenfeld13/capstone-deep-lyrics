Down boy
Gotta Keep down boy
Gotta keep u down if u want me with u
(repeat)

I'm the one that you would die for
The one you long to touch
The one you live a lie for
I know this much

The more you see, the more you want
The more you taste, it just gets better
The more you get, the more you like it
Don't go too far, I won't let you

(Chorus)
Down boy
Won't you bring me down boy
Gotta keep you down
If you want me with you
Down boy
Won't you bring me down boy
Gotta keep you down
Some things I just won't do

Down boy
Won't you bring me down boy
Gotta keep you down
If you want me with you
Down boy
Won't you bring me down boy
Gotta keep you down
Some things I just won't do

Do anything to please me
I got you where I want
I know how much you need me
Just wanna get it on

The more you see, the more you want
The more you taste, it just gets better
The more you get, the more you like it
Don't go too far, I won't let you

(Chorus)
Down boy
Won't you bring me down boy
Gotta keep you down
If you want me with you
Down boy
Won't you bring me down boy
Gotta keep you down
Some things I just won't do

Down boy
Won't you bring me down boy
Gotta keep you down
If you want me with you
Down boy
Won't you bring me down boy
Gotta keep you down
Some things I just won't do

Gotta keep you down
Gotta keep you down
Gotta keep you down
Some things I just won't do
Some things I just won't do
Some things I just won't do
Some things I just won't do

The more you see, the more you want
The more you taste, it just gets better
The more you get, the more you like it
Don't go too far, I won't let you

*(Chorus repeat 2x)
Down boy
Won't you bring me down boy
Gotta keep you down
If you want me with you
Down boy
Won't you bring me down boy
Gotta keep you down
Some things I just won't do*
