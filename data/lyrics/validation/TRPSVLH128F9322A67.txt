Walkin' down a city street
Hands stuffed deep in my coat
Collar turned up, against a stiff wind
I'm soon to ford your moat
I'm used to wind whippin' in my face
No tears fall from my eye
Place your obstacles wherever, babe
I'll kick 'em out within stride

I'm workin' on you
I'm workin' on you
I won't rest 'till I'm through
I'm workin' on you

Deception is such a dangerous game
And you're so big on surprise
But it's best to know with whom you roll
Before you go dealin' up lies

Push back, baby
Push back, baby
C'mon try
Gimme some friction
Faster now
Slicken my rise

Push back, baby
Push back, baby
C'mon try
Gimme some friction
Faster now
Slicken my rise

I'm workin' on you
I'm workin' on you
I won't rest 'till I'm through
I'm workin' on you
I'm workin' on you
I'm workin' on you
I'm workin' on you
I won't rest 'till I'm through
I'm workin' on you
I'm workin' on you
