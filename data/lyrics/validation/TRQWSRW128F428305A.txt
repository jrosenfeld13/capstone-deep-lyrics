Crazy, wake up
Outside the signs are pointing east
And she's drifting away
She takes her heartbreak to go
She knows I'll understand
No change of plan

Her love was already gone
Before we came undone
She runs like rivers and rain
I looked away on a day like today...

Easy, distance
She plays it cool inside she's hoping
Love will be there
Afraid this road never ends
She pretends to like to this way
I can't make her stay

Her love was already gone
Before we came undone
She runs like rivers and rain
I'll never be the same
Her love was already gone
I looked away on a day like today...

But something's telling me
That you want me to say
Just stay
But I'm broken
We're just the same you know
We're letting it go

Crazy, wake up
Inside the signs are pointing west
And I'm driving away

I take my heartbreak to go
'Cause I know
She won't look back
No change of plan

Our love was already gone
Before we came undone
We run like rivers and rain
We'll never be the same
Our love was already gone
Before we came undone
We run like rivers and rain
We looked away on a day like today...
