My revelation
Who are the bands
Where are the bands
Who's able to make believe
Go with the gang
Hiding the slang
Spreading the old disease
You look the same yeah
You all look the same
My revelation
You've got the face baby
I've got the taste
The feeling is good and healthy
I know you could attract me instead
You attack me I'm trapped in a taxi
