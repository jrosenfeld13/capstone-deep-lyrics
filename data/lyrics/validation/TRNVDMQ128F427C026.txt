She was the one they turned to
When all else had seemed to fail
She was the one who listened
Who gave herself up through it all

Only so much someone can take
Propping up another's dreams
To reach such fame in the eyes of your friends
Surely you were misunderstood

All those secret moments alone
Where you wondered just who you were
All the love you gave seemed from somewhere else
Something learnt, but never real

Letters from sunken, poor lost souls
Who'd misread the look in your eyes
Taking a shot in the dark at your love
Woman you can leave them all behind

Now your pushing yourself even further
Found the strength to aim for higher ground

You are your mother
Your father
Your sister
Your brother
All of them are with you inside

She was the one they turned to
When they needed a woman's voice
She was the one who listened
And gave out the gentle advice

When could you break from the image?
Put aside the perfect face?
Be wrong, be rude, be nasty and cold
Start putting people in their place

Back to the woods where your brother played
Back to the promises your mother made
Back to the room where your sister stayed
Back to the year when you felt the change

You carried weights not all could see
But you put them down and you danced with me
Danced in the summer Danced in the rain
Danced away the past Danced away the pain

Out in the country we stood as the lightening cracked
You told me you had to go on alone and not come back

You are your mother
Your father
Your sister
Your brother
All of them are with you inside
They will never, never, never forget you no they'll never, never, never forget you

When I met you
That night
You were falling down
Desperately searching
For a loving sound
With perfect
Strangers
In an unknown town
We fell in together
Until morning
Came
We looked harder
Together
Look at what we
Found!
Now we are over
We are stronger
Even though we are apart
