Love is but a song we sing
And fear's the way we die
You can make the mountains ring
Or hear the angels cry
Though the dove is on the wing
You need not know why

Come on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Love one another right now

Some will come and some will go
This will surely pass
When the one who left us here
Returns for us at last
We are but a moment's sunlight
Fading in the grass

Come on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Love one another right now

If you hear the song we sing
You will understand
You hold the key to love and fear
It's in your trembling hand
One key unlocks them both you know
It's at your command

Come on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Love one another right now
Love one another right now
Love one another right now
