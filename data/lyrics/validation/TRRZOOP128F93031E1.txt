This slab of stone
Stares at me
So seriously and yet I'm Laughing
The grass was soft
And so I sat and painted what I'd been looking at
Now starring in the tragedy
Playing twice a day since its opening
If movements we made fascinating
Hide our hearts incinerating
The final days
Whose book of lust?
Who found sin when they were looking for fun
The visions of
Your violet eyes
So haunted and yet I'm not afraid
Though I feel so weak I must remain

On the stage of my tragic vaudeville
Love come quickly don't fade away

On the stage of my tragic vaudeville
Maddness is the cure as we fade to gray

This slab of stone
Stares at me
So seriously and yet I'm Laughing
A face whose name I can't replace
Steps I can't retrace
Now starring in the tragedy
Playing every night since its opening
And on stage the violence, greed
My obsessive roots drink deep

On the stage of my tragic vaudeville
Love come quickly don't fade away
On the stage of my tragic vaudeville
Maddness is the cure as we fade to gray
