When everything is lost (peel it all away)
Haunting us with questions (asking)
Will we...
Ever find the smile inside (no), is it hidden
Behind the sweating eyes (bleeding)
Dead inside a scream that's pouring from me

I'm planted in this skin, (constricting and pulling me)
This dirty filthy skin(rancid and stinging me)
I burn behind the walls,(that have become my world)
The bearer of a gift, fuck your gift

Truth does not exist
But the lies do......

They're buried in the skin

Evolved

Perversion of a truth I'm stuck there
(inside of lies buried in me, why)
Alone
Born into a world never asked to be here
(try to forget truth doesn't exist, truth)
(it doesn't exist, it doesn't exist, truth)
Daath......

Always inside a tragedy (things never seem to go away)
A room that I remember, (portraits I carry)
Try letting go of this space (bad habits can't kick me)
The fool that fell from heaven, heaven...

Perversion of a truth I'm stuck there
(inside of lies buried in me, why)
Alone
Born into a world never asked to be here
(try to forget truth doesn't exist, truth)
(it doesn't exist, it doesn't exist, truth)

Maybe we're all the children of a star
Misguided in direction, our misdirection
Pardon me while I pray for light

I'm not the only one
That walks between the rain, there are many
I'm not the only one
When everything is lost that doesn't surrender

Perversion of a truth
I'm stuck there (inside of lies buried in me, why)
Alone
Blind walking through a world
I never asked to be here

Versions of the truth...
I'm not the only one...
Lies!
