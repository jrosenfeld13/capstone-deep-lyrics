Working all day and the sun don't shine
Trying to get by and I'm just killing time
I feel the rain fall the whole night through
Far away from you California blue

California blue dreaming all alone
Nothing else to do California blue
Everyday I pray I'll be on my way
Saving love for you California blue

One sunny day, I'll get back again
Somehow, someway but I don't know when
California blue, California blue

Living my life with you on my mind
Thinking of things that I left far behind
It's been so long doing all I can do
To get back to you California blue

California blue
(California blue)
Dreaming all alone
(California blue)

Nothing else to do
(California blue)
California blue
Everyday I pray I'll be on my way
Saving love for you California blue

One sunny day I'll get back again
Somehow, someway but I don't know when
California blue, California blue

Still missing you California blue
Still missing you California blue
Still missing you California blue
