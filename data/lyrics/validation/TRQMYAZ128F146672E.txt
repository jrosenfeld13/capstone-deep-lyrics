Take me, you're the only one that I wanna know
And I promise you, girl I promise
To love you as if your heart were my own
And we're not alone no not anymore

I can't believe that I found you
I can't believe that you're here
After all that we've been through to have you so near
And to hold you so close
I can't believe I still need you
And that you feel the same
After all that we've been through
I know it's a shame to throw it away

Chorus
Take me, you're the only one that I wanna know
You're the only one, and I promise you, I promise
To love you as if your heart were my own
And we're not alone no not anymore

To remember and cherish the things
Recollect, and reflect all our dreams
Spend a lifetime if needed to see
Everything that we know we can be

Chorus
Take me, you're the only one that I wanna know
And I promise you girl, I promise
To love you as if your heart were my own
And we're not alone no not anymore

Look back with sweet, so sweet emotions
Look back with no regrets
Take a real hard look and tell me
Tell me if, we, we can forget
'Cause I know that we can
And that you'll see things my way
And that we'll come to terms
And I know that there's still
So much we can learn
So much we can learn

Chorus
Take me, you're the only one that I wanna know
You are the only one, you're the only one
That I want to love
Love you as if your heart were my own
And we're not alone no not anymore
Take me, you're the only one that I wanna know
Baby, baby yeah
Love you as if your heart were my own
Heart were my own 'cause we're not alone no
Take me, you're the only one that I wanna know
And I promise you, girl I promise
To love you as if your heart were my own
Take me, you're the only one that I wanna know
Baby don't you know
Love you as if your heart were my own
Heart my own
