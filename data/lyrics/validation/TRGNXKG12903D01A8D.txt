Pull these scars off my eyes
Lost from the world
A child searching for her dad

You left me there alone
With hime to rape my world
And I lived through the years a girl
Pleading why

In my dreams last night I saw your face
You held me and washed away my tears
Then I woke to realize you're gone
I'm drowning in solitude again

I thank God for my mother's love
Through years of broken innocence
She carried me through the light

In my dreams last night I saw your face
You held me and washed away my tears

Then I woke to realize you're gone
I'm drowning in solitude again

When you realize that fate is gone
Just look at me and say goodbye
So tell me how you fell
So tell me how

As these years and time go racing by
I'm drowning in solitude again

No, this won't kill me
No, this won't kill me
No, this won't kill me
No, this won't kill me

In my dreams last night I saw your face
You held me and washed away my tears
Then I woke to realize you're gone
I'm drowning in solitude again

This won't kill me
This won't kill me
This won't kill me
This won't
