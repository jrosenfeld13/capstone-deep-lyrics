I can hear him in my head
I can feel him near my bed
I can see his face
In the blood on my hands

He has devoured my soul
He can see through my world
He can speak from my mouth
He can kiss with my tongue

[Chorus]
He, who is legion
Has taken over me
He, who is legion
Has sent my soul to sleep

I can see him in my dreams
I can hear the screams
And I can feel their anguish
And the taste of their tears

He is using my body as his
He is mating, he is killing
He is living through me
And I am not here anymore
