[Verse 1: Rodney P]
Crack heads!
I know this kid named Blue
Average kid, never really too bad
Who never knew his dad
But got respect for his mother and little bredder
He's also got a sister
He's 14, she's 19 and treats him mean
But that's sisters
Anyway, come listen this tale
Will this kid Blue go straight from school to jail?
Starting out small
Got his little weed fi sell
Got his little hustle
Really don't need no details
Young black male, living out the stereotype
Love fi chat mics like hot cars and fast bikes
Yo, he's just a shorty where the man dem booze
Stuff a real, nuff of them yoots don't have no use
But not Blue, Blue's wise, he keep his eyes on the books
But love crooks and never been afraid of the jooks
Life's cold, so he knows how fi roll and throw hooks
And he pretty so the gal dems always sweating his looks

[Chorus: Rodney P]
And he's future
For real
We have fi boost dem yoot yeah
The future
For real
We have fi boost dem yoot yeah
If we do
When they're grown build a world to suit you
If we don't
When they're grown take a gun come shoot you
Ah the future
For real
We have fi boost dem yoot yah
Read a book
Read Malcolm or Martin Luther
Read Marcus, don't let them boy dem come confuse you
I don't want fi hear the story how police come shoot you
Yeah, the future

[Verse 2: Rodney P]
Now Blue's just a yoot
They call youse man dem
He's with his friends
Talking about when his whip is a Benz
Now yo
Coulda end up runnin' IBM
Or then again probably end up running crack on the ends
Now yo
Used to aspire for the best they know
All they know is drugs make dough
You know where that go
More fire, more blood spilling
And more sinning, more illing
More ice grilling
But Blue's billing
God willing
I'm a watch him
I ain't his daddy I can't stop him
But I'm a watch him
If he sends for me I got him
Right now he's running the road
I know he's shotting
Trying to get his little money
Trying to come up off the bottom
Yo, whatever's gwanning is inner
If that yoot dem turn to crime the kingpin ups [?]
I know he's sinning, but he ain't a villain
If that yoot turn a villain
More worries again

[Chorus: Rodney P]
And he's future
For real
We have fi boost dem yoot yeah
The future
For real
We have fi boost dem yoot yeah
If we do
When they're grown build a world to suit you
If we don't
When they're grown take a gun come shoot you
Ah the future
For real
We have fi boost dem yoot yah
Read a book
Read Malcolm or Martin Luther
Read Marcus, don't let them boy dem come confuse you
I don't want fi hear the story how police come shoot you
Yeah, the future

[Verse 3: Rodney P]
I heard somebody say the good die young
Blue's daddy done dead
Yes, he's a good guy, son
At twenty-one, in the party took a knife to the lung
Now there's Blue, the young gun who carried ice for fun
He ain't no fool
Just don't like school
Sell weed
But don't smoke weed 'cause that ain't cool
Known for hustle man at money and can shark at pool
If you ask him he's gone tell you
Said 'Arsenal rule,' for real
In a deal, little man, just a yoot's out the ghetto
Who's trying to make grands
Trying to make plans
For some money to hold
Coulda either run the world or run the road


[Chorus: Rodney P]
And he's future
For real
We have fi boost dem yoot yeah
The future
For real
We have fi boost dem yoot yeah
If we do
When they're grown build a world to suit ya
If we don't
When they're grown take a gun come shoot ya
Ah the future
For real
We have fi boost dem yoot yah
Read a book
Read Malcolm or Martin Luther
Read Marcus, don't let them boy dem come confuse ya
I don't want fi hear the story how police come shoot ya
Yeah the future

[Skit]
We have to boost dem yoot yeah
Big up dem man dem
