Standing, waiting for a man to show
Wide eyed, one eye fixed on the door
This waiting's killing me
It's wearing me down
Day in, day out
My feet are burning holes in the ground

Darkness, warmer than a bedroom floor
Want someone to hold me close forever more
I'm a sleeping dog
But you can't tell
When I'm on the prowl
You better run like hell

You know it makes sense
Don't even think about it
Life and death
Are things you just do when you're born

CHORUS
Say fear's a man's best friend
Say fear's a man's best friend
Say fear's a man's best friend
You add it up, it brings you down
You add it up, it brings you down

Home is leaving like a man on the run
Trains leading nowhere, where to my son?
We're already dead
But not yet in the ground
Come on, shake my helping hand I'll show you around

You know it makes sense
Don't even think about it
Life and death
Are things you just do when you're born

CHORUS

Say fear's a man's best friend
