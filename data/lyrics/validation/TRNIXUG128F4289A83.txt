Hey, little one don't you cry
You must be brave, so dry your eyes
You know tomorrow will find me gone
Because the wild leads me on
Peace of mind is hard to find
Lots of worries in this heart of mine
Why do I wander so endlessly
And leave the girl, the girl that loves me
It's all right, it's all right
It's all right, I'll be back someday
Over the hill by the setting sun
My love goes back to my little one
Bless and keep her, oh Lord, above
And send to her all my love
And carry me, oh, lonesome train
Over these hills back to my love again
This will be my last time to roam
And down in that valley that's where we'll build our home
Just in time to be too late
My little one got married today
Carry me, oh, lonesome train
Behind these hills to hide my shame
It's all right, it's all right
It's all right, I'll be on my way...
