I will design a town in the image of your face
Round the wrinkles of your eyes my footsteps you can trace
We could promenade down infra-nasel depression
The streets of your hands will never feel a recession

It's a secular day and it will be even better tomorrow
It's the first day of the intergrated transport hub
Let us celebrate this monumental progress
We have reduced emmisions by 75%

By the speed of light the ??? will get ??? (beep)
