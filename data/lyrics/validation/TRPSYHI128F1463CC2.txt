[Verse 1]
There you were last night
Sitting close to her by candlelight
I couldn't let you see my crying eyes
But I wanted so bad to run to you
How could you find someone in just so little time?
We said we'd be friends maybe one day
Give us one more try
I can't understand, it happened so fast
Six months have passed
Now suddenly you've gotten over me

[Chorus]
It hurts when I thought I had gotten over you
It hurts when together forever won't come true
It hurts when one broken heart is how it ends
'Cause it hurts to know that you are in love again

[Verse 2]
I'm trying so hard not to care
But you're happy now and it's not fair
Just when I thought that I was getting strong
I see you with her
I was wrong
Now I can pretend that losing you
Didn't mean a thing
And I can deny that
This whole thing's not happening
To hold it inside
It's killing me
It's hurting me
If you could only see

[Chorus]
It hurts when I thought I had gotten over you
It hurts when together forever won't come true
It hurts when one broken heart is how it ends
'Cause it hurts to know that you are in love again

La-la-la-la
Ohh

[Chorus]
It hurts when I thought I had gotten over you
It hurts when together forever won't come true
It hurts when one broken heart is how it ends
'Cause it hurts to know that you are in love again
