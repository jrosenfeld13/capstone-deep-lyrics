[Verse 1: Royksopp]
In the dead of the night you seem closer to me
The next day I wake up and know how unreal it is
Feeling so tense like I'm caught in a corner
You can't speak but I hear you calling
I come back for you

[Verse 2: Royksopp]
I've been dead to the world and I've chosen to be
Inside under pillows with marvels and wonders
Sedating my will to exist in the open
I don't move but I keep on moving
I'm only with you
