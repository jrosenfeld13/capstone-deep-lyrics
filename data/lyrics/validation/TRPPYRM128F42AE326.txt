It's a clinic, and I'm in it
Is it a race, am I winning
And I can't hide, from what's inside
Is it the end, is it the beginning

I'm not afraid to run
I'm not afraid to fly - with you
Never giving up
I'm never gonna quit it, 'cause I like the way I'm living
Never gonna quit
Life in a coma - let me out
Living life in a coma - let me out

It's a clinic, I admit it
This is my life, never quit it

I build a wall just to watch it fall
Knocked to my knees, I begin to crawl
I feel the building of this anger, it's rising up

I'm not afraid to run
I'm not afraid to fly - with you
Never giving up
I'm never gonna quit it, 'cause I like the way I'm living
Never gonna quit
Life in a coma - let me out
Living life in a coma - let me out

Life in a coma - let me out
Living life in a coma - let me out

I'm not afraid to run
I'm not afraid to fly - with you
Never giving up
I'm never gonna quit it, 'cause I like the way I'm living
Never gonna quit
Life in a coma
Living life in a coma - let me out

Living life in a coma - let me out
Living life in a coma - let me out

Come let me out
Come let me out
Come let me out
Out, out, out, out, out
