You could get her just for a smile
You could buy her just for some compliments
But behind her make-up you still find a broken child

She, so far

She only finds herself with somebody in her arms
She is a plastic doll, that's all, that's her, that's all

You might want her just for a night
She might hold you as long as possible
She covers her emptiness with cold and hollow eyes
You won't survive her lies

She, so far

So beware...
When will she break, when will she break the circle
So beware
