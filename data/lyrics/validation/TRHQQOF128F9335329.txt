I go to the hilt, full throttle full on
Tilt the bottle and I take it strong
Come a little closer, can you hear my thong
What's the matter, boy, see something wrong?
Take my pulse and add insult
Smoke a little cigarette and join my cult
I get results, do a somer-somersault
Think you got the combination?
Crack that vault
No boast, just coast
I'm the virus you're the host

Relax
Slip in the cracks
I'll take you to another place
We're makin' contact
Relax
Slip in the cracks
I'll take you to another place
You'll never wanna come ba-a-ack

I'm the real scene these velveteen
Just press start on my main machine
Sight unseen, another Halloween
Strike sixteen on my mons so clean [?]

Bam, bam, bam is how the party began
Wham, wham, wham is how I parted the dam
Takin' a stand, bringin' the glam, shazam
Come on wonder woman
Ground floor, French door
Want more? What you runnin' for?

Relax
Slip in the cracks
I'll take you to another place
We're makin' contact
Relax
Slip in the cracks
I'll take you to another place
You'll never wanna come ba-a-ack

Ooh
Try a little harder
Ooh
Try a little harder
Ooh
Try a little harder
Ooh
Try a little harder

Sweet sweat gland come and take my hand
Sink in the sand to my holy land
Bring on the chaos, and sauce galore
I pour it on thick then I'll pour you some more

Bam, bam, bam is how the party began
Wham, wham, wham is how I parted the dam
Takin' a stand, bringin' the glam, shazam
Come on wonder woman

Relax
Slip in the cracks
I'll take you to another place
We're makin' contact
Relax
Slip in the cracks
I'll take you to another place
You'll never wanna come ba-a-ack
