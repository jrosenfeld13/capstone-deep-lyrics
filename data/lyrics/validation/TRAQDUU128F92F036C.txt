[Verse 1]
I wish you well
I hope you survive
I hope you live, oh baby, so I can watch you cry
Cause I know in time you'll see what you did to me
And you'll come running back

[Chorus]
I'm gonna rain on your parade
No, I won't take it again
And I'll keep raining, raining, raining over you
I'm gonna rain on your parade
No, I won't take it again
And I'll keep raining, raining, raining over you

[Verse 2]
I pity the fools who bathe in you
Cause I know someday now, they'll see your colours too
And if you see a smile, besides my face, no I'm doing good now
Since you've been erased
Cause I know in time you'll see what you did to me
And you'll come running back

[Chorus]
I'm gonna rain on your parade
No, I won't take it again
And I'll keep raining, raining, raining over you
I'm gonna rain on your parade
No, I won't take it again
And I'll keep raining, raining, raining over you
I'm gonna rain on your parade
No, I won't take it again
And I'll keep raining, raining, raining over you
I'm gonna rain on your parade
No, I won't take it again
And I'll keep raining, raining, raining over you
I'm gonna rain on your parade
No, I won't take it again
And I'll keep raining, raining, raining over you
I'm gonna rain on your parade
No, I won't take it again
And I'll keep raining, raining, raining over you
