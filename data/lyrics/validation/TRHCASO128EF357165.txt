You're like a breath of fresh air
Everytime I'm 'round you
You take away all my despair

Anytime I'm feelin' down or blue
Baby, all I got to do is think about you

You're like the gentle kiss of the rain
Everytime I'm with you
You wash away all my pain

Anytime I'm feelin' down or blue
Honey, all I got to do is think about you

I would do anything
I would do everything
I would do anything just to be with you
I would go anywhere just to know you You were there
I would go anywhere just to be with you

You're like the spark of the fire
You can do long my, my desire

Anytime time I'm feeling down or blue
Honey, all I got to do is think about you
If I'm feeling down or blue
I think about you
I think about you

Don't you know, don't you know
I'm thinking about you
Don't you know, don't you know
I think about you
