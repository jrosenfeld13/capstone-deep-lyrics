[Verse 1]
I praise the day that we came closer
The day that send us on a roller coaster
A lovely day that I would never forget, never forget
You sat beside me and kissed me softly
Was it a dream or pure reality
You made me feel like a fool on a joyride

[Chorus 1]
Those were the times
The times we felt so free and young
Wild at heart
Sharing joys, sorrows and fun
Uh, let your heart dance

[Verse 2]
We have had lots of odds and muddles
Lots of people we got in trouble with
Walking proud with polished boots, shaven heads, Sherman shirts
You were my love the one in a million
You were the one I walked trough thick and thin
And more than once you prove your love just to me, just to me

[Chorus 1]
As fate would have it
Those rollicking times faded out
Holding to your love
Having lost all of my stout
Uh, let your heart dance

[Chorus 2]
Those were the times
The times we felt so free and young
Wild at heart
Sharing joys, sorrows and fun
Uh, let your heart dance
