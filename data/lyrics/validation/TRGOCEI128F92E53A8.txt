1, 2, 3, 4... Do it now, do it now...

Day starts with a blast of feedback
Still spinning from the night that we had
In the mirror where I brush my teeth at
Theres three more heads, and they watching me back
Read the bread while I toast my pay check
Weather girl said grey's a safe bet
Phone ringing an I refuse to take it
Wanna play dead but I'm on the dayshift
Stepping out on to the weekly rota
On the cheap share a seat with Olga
Train driver said it ain't a joke but
We're gonna be stuck till I fix the motta
Half hour in-between the stations
Start jogging when I hit the pavement
Ran straight into a situation
Cop says stop cause I ain't Caucasian
Whole hour on the explanation
Missed the bus and the cab was ancient
Im really now in a situation
When I return to my destination
I get told to collect my payment
Clear the desk quick make it vacant
Now if I ever needed inspiration
Right about now where I lose my patience
If I ever needed inspiration
Right about here's where I lose my patience
Do it now, do it now

Dont make you feel like madder, madder, madder
This one day bum bum bum, bummer, bummer, bummer
Dont make you feel like madder, madder, madder
This one day bam bam bam, bammer, slammer, jammer
This makes you feel like madder, madder, madder
This one day bam bam bam, bammer, bammer, bammer
Dont make you feel like madder, madder, madder
This one day bam bam bam, bammer, slammer, jammer
This want to make you feel

1, 2, 3, 4... Always said I want a new agenda
Do it now while I still remember
Small fish in a mixin blenda
All the bets set on the next offenda
I had enough being nice and anxious
I keep sweet all the trendy bankers
Im looking more than the war the pension
Under attack of the apprehension
Im too transformed to lose the motion
I might shout now out and open
All the hanging on the years of hoping
The same things now feel provoking
So hot that the tears are smoking
Watch now my might just crunch the whole thing
Watch now my might just crunch the whole thing
Now if I ever needed inspiration
Right about heres where I lose my patience
Now if I ever needed inspiration
Right about heres where I lose my patience
Do it now, do it now

Dont make you feel like madder, madder, madder
This one day bum bum bum, bummer, bummer, bummer
Dont make you feel like madder, madder, madder
This one day bam bam bam, bammer, slammer, jammer
This makes you feel like madder, madder, madder
This one day bam bam bam, bammer, bammer, bammer
Dont make you feel like madder, madder, madder
This one day bam bam bam, bammer, slammer, jammer
This want to make you feel

If I ever needed inspiration
Right about here's where I lose my patience
If I ever needed inspiration
Right about here's where I lose my patience

Don't make you fell like, don't make you fell like
Madder, madder, madder... Do it now, do it now

If I ever needed inspiration
Right about here's where I lose my patience
If I ever needed inspiration
Right about here's where I lose my patience
Do it now, do it now

Dont make you feel like madder, madder, madder
This one day bum bum bum, bummer, bummer, bummer
Dont make you feel like madder, madder, madder
This one day bam bam bam, bammer, slammer, jammer
This makes you feel like madder, madder, madder
This one day bam bam bam, bammer, bammer, bammer
Don't make you feel like madder, do it now
