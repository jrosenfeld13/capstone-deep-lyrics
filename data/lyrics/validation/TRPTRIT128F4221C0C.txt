Off the list her respect's now running out
Trying to forget things really haven't mattered at all
On a plane they will learn, I will get the fuck out
Leave this city and this earth through a shattering wall
And wouldn't it be great as though we were never meant to be alone
And you'd appreciate these things

We would go to the park just hanging out
Talk about things that really didn't matter a lot
And I would wait for that part when you'd prove to me
Well I'm still listening
To you it didn't matter at all

I was out late, long enough to really think things over well
And I came down to one conclusion
It would be best if I just backed out
Make you happy, ease this tension while you figure things out
And in a later point in time you'd see
Just what you mean to me
You'd see it really mattered a lot
