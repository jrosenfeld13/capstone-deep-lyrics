Come into my dream
Come into my dream
Come into my dream

Come into my dream
Let me show you where I been
It's you and me I've seen
Let me tell you what I mean

In the deep blue sky
There were rainbows in deny
You and me could fly
And the ocean shines so bright
(And the ocean shines so bright)

Come into my dream
Let me show you where I been
It's you and me I've seen
Let me tell you what I mean
