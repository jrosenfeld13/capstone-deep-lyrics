[Intro: Travie McCoy]
See, here's the thing

[Hook: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off (so sexy)
We have to party all night
We have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh no no no

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
Excuse me miss
I couldn't help but to notice how alone you are
I dig your attitude and how you're actin' like you own the bar
Got me flashin' keys and I don't even own a car
Front like you ain't feelin' my charm because I know you are
I'm tryin' to see how your lips feel
I'm sorry my name is Travie and I'm pretty much a big deal
Oh, you never heard of me, hmmmm
That sounds absurd to me
The way you stole my attention was flat out burglary
What do you say let's exit stage left so me and you could possibly
Reconvene and play some naked peek-a-boo
'Cause after all the blouse you're wearing is kind of see through
And its obvious I'm heading wherever you're leading me to
Such an angel with a devilish angle and quite the certified sweet talker
And you're buying every line of it girl
And I don't really blame you
If I was in your shoes, I'll probably do the same too

[Hook: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off (so sexy)
We have to party all night
We have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh no no no

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
Now here's another barn burner for the slow learners
Put your helmets on and take a seat on the short bus
Next stop, right around the corner from your mom and them
No turning back so you better buckle up
Shit, don't be concerned with mine
I be like a speak'n'spell the way I got you learnin' my lines, fine
Pull the string replay that shit
Change my name to 'Did He Really Just Say that Shit?' (Yep)
I'll take a mile if you let me
Six-five, 200 plus and so sexy
My legs goin' numb from keepin' my phone on vibrate
To hide the fact your girlfriend keeps textin' me
And I've been trying to never mind it man
But every time I get a new number she finds it, damn
And you thought you had it sewn up
Until right around amazing o'clock when I shown up

[Hook: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off (so sexy)
We have to party all night
We have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh no no no

[Bridge: Travie McCoy]
We got chicks
All hot chicks
Indie Rock chicks and Hip Hop chicks
Thin chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
We got chicks
All hot chicks
Indie Rock chicks and Hip Hop chicks
Thin chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks

[Verse 3: Travie McCoy]
Good grief girl you're giving me goosebumps
Standin' there in your underwear and new pumps
It's like the more time we waste the less time I get to taste you
Honestly I can easily replace you
It's not a scam girl
That's how I am girl
Peter Pan I'm a sucker for Smucker's jam girl
Its clear I'm only here for good clean fun
Shut up and kiss me like the antidote is under my tongue

[Hook: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
We have to party all night
We have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh no no no
We have to take our clothes off (so sexy)
We have to party all night
We have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh no no no

[Bridge: Travie McCoy]
We got chicks
All hot chicks
Indie Rock chicks and Hip Hop chicks
Thin chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
We got chicks
All hot chicks
Indie Rock chicks and Hip Hop chicks
Thin chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
