Snow's coming down
In holiday sound
Tie me ribbons all over the ground
Warming the night
We're feeling alright
Cover clever and bundle up tight

(chorus)
We'll go outside
It's cold outside
We'll build a snow man
We'll go outside and build a new snowman
Just look at the tree
It's shining on me
Stars are hidden but seem to agree
Friends are all here
"and how are you dear"?
Hugs and kisses up to my ears

(chorus)
All the right reasons
Holiday season's here
All but one reason
Holiday season's dear
Fa- la- la- la
We'll go outside
It's cold outside
We've gotta go man
We'll go outside and build a new snowman
