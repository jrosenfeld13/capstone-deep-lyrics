Something just a while ago told me I should go
Never thought it would have come to this
Didn't see his fist, must've missed
Drinkin' all night well that twat was pissed
And I know, it's not gonna be O. K
One for the road, til I get back home
All I hear is my friends saying 'one more beer'
Then I head back to my place
I was drunk and had some cuts and bumps
10 if them and 2 of us let's go
Why is it when I feel so alive
I'm the one that's always gotta fuckin' drive
Not a guy who can just have one
What's the point in that and where's the fun?
After 6 I'm up to my normal tricks
Saying that I've lost my keys
So I beg you please
Buy a drink for me
And one for the trip back home
