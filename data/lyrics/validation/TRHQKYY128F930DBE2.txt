What wondrous love is this O my soul O my soul
What wondrous love is this O my soul
What wondrous love is this that caused the Lord of bliss
To bear the dreadful curse for my soul for my soul
To bear the dreadful curse for my soul

When I was sinking down, sinking down, sinking down
When I was sinking down, sinking down
When I was sinking down beneath Gods righteous frown
Christ laid aside His crown for my soul for my soul
Christ laid aside His crown for my soul

To God and to the Lamb I will sing, I will sing
To God and to the Lamb I will sing
To God and to the Lamb who is the great I Am
While millions join the theme I will sing

And when from death Im free Ill sing on Ill sing on
And when from death Im free Ill sing on
And when from death Im free Ill sing and joyful be
And through eternity Ill sing on, Ill sing on
And through eternity Ill sing on
