Babyraper!

[Verse 1]
Babyraper, sperm creator
I'm just a hulking, brutish masturbator
Babyraper, emasculator, yeah yeah
Fleshy flap valve navigator

Ohhh...

[Verse 2]
Never leave me, Babyraper
Melted cum ejaculator
Spackled filth evaporator, yeah yeah
High colonic spackulator

Ay! Ay! Ay!
I'm the Babyraper
The Babyraper

[Bridge]
My quest for sex consumes all my life
Being a god I do what I like
I know it hurts you when I fuck a child
Consumed with cumming, I've simply gone wild
Drinking and drowning in lakes full of lust
I'll still jerk off even when I cum dust

My sex is my hatred, my penis, a tool
My balls are imploding, I'm playing the fool
My butt crack is folding, the crap that it's holding
Heap it all over the stool
Ohh, the Babyraper
Ahh!

[Verse 3]
I'm the fucking Babyraper
I'm the guy who stiffed the waiter
Mangled pubic flagellator
Turgid bowel exaggerator

I'm just a fleshy flap-valved gladiator
Gladiator, gladiator, yeah
