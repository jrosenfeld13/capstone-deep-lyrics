Bring me back something
Bring me back something
All I have is time like an echo in a tin
Oh, bring me back something
While the garden grows
Remind me where it is
Remind me where it is
Remind me where it is, for my mind is like a sieve
Oh, remind me where it is
While the garden grows

I'm growing a dozen roses
Roses are all I hear
I've only one winter coat and
I'm one step behind you dear
I'm one step behind you dear

Wild were we then
Wild were we then
Wild was my mind
Oh, when you were looking in one me!
Wild were we then
Like the garden grows

I'm growing a dozen roses
Roses are all I hear
I've only one winter coat and
I'm one step behind you dear
I'm one step behind you dear
