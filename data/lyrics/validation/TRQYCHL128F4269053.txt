We first met in the winter
Said 'let's give it a try'
I swallowed my fears
A couple of years
Just living a lie
I'd just come from the country
Wide-eyed and naive
I signed on the line
I signed a long time
Now you won't let me leave... but you

Don't take no for an answer
Don't take no for an answer
Don't take no for an answer
When you've nothing to lose... no you
Don't take no for an answer
Don't take no for an answer
Don't take no for an answer
Put yourself in my shoes

I don't want any trouble
I ain't after a fight
But well-respected man
Please understand, man
You're standing in my light
No use sticking together
I've gotta get out and get off
I offered you a slice
You told me no dice
Cos you wanted the lot... but you

Don't take no for an answer
Don't take no for an answer
Don't take no for an answer
When you've nothing to lose... no you
Don't take no for an answer
Don't take no for an answer
Don't take no for an answer
Put yourself in my shoes
