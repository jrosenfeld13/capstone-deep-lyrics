[Verse 1: Hayley Williams]
When we get home, I know we won't be home at all
This place we live, it is not where we belong
And I miss who we were and the town we could call our own
Going back to get away after everything has changed
Everything has changed

[Chorus: Hayley Williams & Josh Farro]
Could you remind me of a time when we were so alive?
(Everything has changed)
Do you remember that? Do you remember that?
(Everything has changed)
Could you help me push aside all that I have left behind?
(Everything has changed)
Do you remember that? Do you remember that?

[Verse 2: Hayley Williams]
So, we stand here now and no one knows us at all
I won't get used to this, I won't get used to being gone
And going back won't feel the same if we aren't staying
And going back to get away after everything has changed
Everything has changed

[Bridge: Hayley Williams]
It's taking up our time again
Go back, we can't go back at all
It's taking up our time again
Go back, we can't go back at all

[Outro: Hayley Williams & Josh Farro]
It's taking up our time
Cause you remind me of a time when we were so alive
Do you remember that
Do you remember that
