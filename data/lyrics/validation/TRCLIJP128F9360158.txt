Music: Jones

Jakob's got a ladder
Climbs up to the sun
Once you get to the top of it
You're going to be someone

Now I've got a ladder
And it climbs up to the sky
Once I get to the top of it
I'm gonna be good and high

Don't believe in ladders
Heaven ain't in the sky
But once you get to the top
Look out kid

(chorus):
Jakob keep climbing someday
You're gonna get to the top you see
You're living your life on Earth
In a state of rebirth
The work is done and time will tell
If you're living in Hell
This world is a heaven to me

Sharon's got a rose
Redder than her lipstick
Says, "Brother can you spare a dime?"
And then I give it to her quick

Now I've got a rose
But the wine is dirty red
Drink enough for the both of us
In the morning I might be dead

Don't believe in roses
Heaven ain't in the sky
But once you get to the top
Look out kid

(chorus)
Joseph's got a coat
Covers up the back seat
Takes a hit of his smoke
Then he says he can't see straight
No, No

I've got a vision
Colors too bold to call
Big enough for the both of us
Big enough for us all

Don't believe in visions
Zion ain't in the sky
But once you get to the top
Look out kid

(chorus)
