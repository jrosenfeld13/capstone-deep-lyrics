When you run about
Without precautions
You'll get diseased
And need abortions
And up till now
No vaccination
Can give you back your reputation
We want
We want your body
We want
We want your body
We want
We want your body (repeat)

Cathy go home
Without your daughter
In a welfare state
She'll be well looked after
And it's easy now
This other person
Is off your back not a burden

We want
We want your body
We want
We want your body
We want
We want your body (repeat)
