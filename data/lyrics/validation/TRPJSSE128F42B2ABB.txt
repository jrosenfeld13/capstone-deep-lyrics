Hangtime is partner after meal time
It's a bonus the three of them rhyme
Takes life, tony looks at me like...
Puts them is a sick cum and call it slime
Milli, bad Milli is not your special friend
Milli oh Milli you're better than brown bread

The dreams playing on a bench hook
Jake robbers chasing with the right a hook
Very special, oh pretty special
Zac attack sack is back, kick his shanny off the crack!

You're such a clumsy lover
You're such a clumsy lover
You're such a clumsy lover she said
You're such a clumsy lover
You're such a clumsy lover
You're such a clumsy lover she said

And then she said...
Hah ha hah
Hah ha hah
Hah ha hah hah ha!
Hah ha hah
Hah ha hah
Hah ha hah hah ha!
