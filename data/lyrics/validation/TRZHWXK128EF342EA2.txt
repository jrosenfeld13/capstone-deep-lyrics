I love the east, I love the west
And north and south, they're both the best
But I'll only go there as a guest
'Cause I love being here with you

I love the sea, I love the shore
I love the rocks and what is more?
With you they'd never be a bore
'Cause I love being here with you

Singin' in the shower, laughin' by the hour
Life is such a crazy game
Love all kinds of weather, as long as we're together
I love that when you say my name

I like to dine and fine cuisine
And candle light, I like the scene
But baby, if you know just what I mean
I love being here with you

I like to dance by Fred Astaire
George Clooney's eyes, Bruce Willis's hair
But I think to tell you it's only fair
Oh baby, I love being here with you

And Cary Grant, just make my day
His utter charm takes me away
But don't get me wrong, how do you say
I love being here with you

Oh, Basie's band's clingin', I like Diana singin'
But there's something else, you know
They know how to say it, they ain't know how to play it
They wind it up and let it go

I love the thrill of New York shows
I'd love to kiss Leonardo's nose
But I'd like to say before I close
I love being here with you 2x
