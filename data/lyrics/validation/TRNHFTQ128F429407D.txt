Burning everything I'm learning
Light a match 'cause I don't get it yet
Shake out the mistakes that I've made
Swallow them down
Is it more than I can take

When you call my name
To walk on water

'Cause you are the waves that I feel when I'm sinking
And you are the storms that I feel when I'm dying
And you are God, you are God
And I know, I know, I know, I know
That you are God, you are God
And I know, I know

I see you there standing on the shoreline
Watching me out here as I'm taking on the storm
And I want you
And I need you
And do you hear me
Because I hear you

When you call my name
To walk on water

'Cause you are the waves that I feel when I'm sinking
And you are the storms that I feel when I'm dying
And you are God, you are God
And I know, I know, I know, I know
That you are God, you are God
And I know, I know

I feel you touching me
I feel you touching me
I feel you touching me
Is there anything else to believe?
'Cause I feel you touching me
I feel you touching me
I feel you touching me
I feel you touching me

'Cause you are the waves that I feel when I'm sinking
And you are the storms that I feel when I'm dying
And you are God, you are God
And I know, I know, I know, I know
That you are God, you are God
And I know

That you are the waves that I feel when I'm sinking
And you are the storms that I feel when I'm dying
And you are God, you are God
And I know, I know, I know, I know
That you are God, you are God
