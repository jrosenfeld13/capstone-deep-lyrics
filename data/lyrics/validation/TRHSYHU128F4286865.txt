[Lady Talking]

[Verse 1]
I been all around the world what did I see?
The whole crowd lookin' at me
The real nigga, ill nigga, slide through pezzy as fuck
New kicks, fresh face, I know u wonderin' "Who the fuck is this?
Lookin' like I had plenty of beauty sleep, ya'll lookin' tired
This atmosphere got me feelin' weird, it's like I'm wired
So many stars, so many hoes, so many niggas tryna
Live the life of these rich niggas
Renegade ways keep me from the path of snakes
Though we cross paths, only when it's math to make
We say a prayer, I got it wrote on my hand
But I'm not broke I got bread, sand blows in the wind
Casino chips stack trick dice is tucked in
I forgot to call, too many emotions turned to a Coogi night
Miscommunications I had plenty fights
But sort it out with my nig' cause I got love for him
A deep breath, a long thought with my eyes shut
It's the drugs for them but it's the vibes that I feel when I slide up

[Chorus]
Aye yo, the sun shines on the strip
But at night the bright lights will have it bright enough
Picture this, a million stalls, I got brand new kicks
The world is ours you understand that huh?
Sometimes I get too deep
Aye yo the Husalah shines on the street
But at night the bright lights will have it bright enough
Picture this a million stalls, I got brand new kicks
The world is ours you understand it huh?
Sometimes I get too deep
Aye yo the Husalah shines on the street

[Verse 2]
Lost souls with nowhere to go, money mislead her dose
But slick game is what mislead the hoes
I know I'm young but I got deeper thoughts
And most can't see at all
Get out the way when death creep across, that's real
I'm like priest but in the now time 'cause I'm ill
Used to only coke hustle, now I really like to build
Niggas feel stupid 'cause the Husalah's on a level
Bismillah, Islamic rebel, peep that nigga chain
I'm back to back with the Coogi niggas
Told her my name she call me Gucci nigga, she stayed
But I ain't plug her though, I just met her
What the fuck I wanna fuck her fo'? Nigga, you stupid
I lay my head and close my eyes and I think of life
Of how it used to be and how it is at night
I never wondered how I didn't die and survive
Inccidents when bullets fly and cars riding bye
Long as I live I'm a keep it right
When it get cold I use the pistol to heat up this life
Speed up this life, fuck that slow lane, no progress
Nigga you grown, at 14 we had that thought process
But that ain't it a lot of chicks will call a nigga young
I beg of mercy to Allah for all the shit I've done
I pushed poison, slingin' coke with bullets in my coat
With a gun around it, shot up the party while the shit was crowded
And that was never over cream, probably for the fame
A young nigga on the scene, reppin' his name
The new king like Softkay but I'ma try to live
But if I don't that's just how it is
You can't always win
(life my nigg)

[Chorus]
Aye yo, the sun shines on the strip
But at night the bright lights will have it bright enough
Picture this, a million stalls, I got brand new kicks
The world is ours you understand that huh?
Sometimes I get too deep
Aye yo the Husalah shines on the street
But at night the bright lights will have it bright enough
Picture this a million stalls, I got brand new kicks
The world is ours you understand it huh?
Sometimes I get too deep
Aye yo the Husalah shines on the street (on the street)

[Verse 3]
If it wasn't for the love of my mother
I probably woulda never felt love
My first love was the streets, now my heart is cold
And all the queens I've been involved with, there you go
They said a nigga was emotionless
I used to chief, loungin' out, gettin' ripped, layin' motionless
I flow to this for a reason, try to see my thoughts
It's right between the rhymes and right next to the knock
Close ya eyes for real, nigga, let's hit this block
I'm serious as hell like the flame out a chop'
For you to get it like you want it you gotta see this shit or sell your soul
But if you don't wanna sell your soul it's better to keep this shit
As we walk up this strip it's like pure life, uncut, 100%
As we walk up this strip it's like pure life, uncut, 100%
This this the life of a nigga tryna make it right
For my niggas livng they life in the projects
This this the life of a nigga tryna make it right
For my niggas livng they life in the projects
This this the life of a nigga tryna make it right
For my niggas livng they life in the projects
This this the life of a nigga tryna make it right
For my niggas livng they life in the projects

You know what I mean? From the projects to Vegas
And anywhere in between you know? You know all that flossin' and glistenin' niggas dig that shit man. It's kind of like, you know put this shit in perspective man for what it's really worth. You know? I'm just sayin' though, you know? I'm just saying...get high...
