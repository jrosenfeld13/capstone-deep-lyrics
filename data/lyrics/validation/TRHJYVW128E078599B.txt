Boy we spend so much time
Working for what we want in life
Anybody dedicated to something has
Got to stress out even just a little bit

I know it's far much more sometimes
Lately you've had to draw the line
Between the good and the bad
What you focus most on in your life
Take your time

Take a second to appreciate this time
That was new when you woke up this morning
No doubt, this is what tonight is suppose to be about

Take a second to appreciate this time
T's all up to you, to see the soul through brand new eyes
Stick with me baby and you'll realise

It's your love that makes me sing
Time to say thank you for the little things
So anybody looking, they can see your shine
But they are mine, writing on the line babe
I respect you, 'cause you've got a principle??
Unlike most of us, I can ???????
But even all of the baddest of the beauty queens
???????? all my dreams
Couldn't shine a light babe

Take a second to appreciate this time
That was new when you woke up this morning
No doubt, this is what tonight is suppose to be about

Take a second to appreciate this time
It's all up to you, to see the soul through brand new eyes
Stick with me baby and you'll realise
