Hey Ol' Lady let's go
To the Motel Cowboy Show
We'll drink and dance
There's no place else to go
We'll stay out all night long
We'll toast the break of dawn
Hey Ol' Lady let's go
To the Motel Cowboy Show

Well they rolled one for the road
Put on the same dirty ol' clothes
Down the trail they rode
To the Motel Cowboy Show
Well they parked at the end of the line
Underneath the cold beer sign
It's a long long way to ride
Without your whiskey and your wine
Something stronger would be fine
Something stronger would be fine

I said Hey Ol' Lady lets go
To the Motel Cowboy Show
We'll drink and dance
There's no place else to go
We'll hang out all night long
We'll toast the break of dawn
Hey Ol' Lady let's go
To the Motel Cowboy Show

Well they walked through the swingin' doors
Through the sawdust on the floor
Everybody was ready to go
At the Motel Cowboy Show

Well they've been all over the land
Not bad for a honky tonk band
Well it's a long hard hill to climb
When you're so far ahead of time
And you've never seen a dime
You're so far ahead of your time

Hey Ol' Lady lets go
To the Motel Cowboy Show
It's late but there ain't nowhere else to go
We'll hang out all night long
We'll toast the break of dawn
Hey Ol' Lady let's go
To the Motel Cowboy Show

Well the doses soon kicked in
And the fun would soon begin
The fun would soon begin

And the world did a great big spin
Ooooh baby it's fun
It ain't no sin

I know you well
You don't remember
We partied way back in November
Of '72 or was it '73
I know you well
You don't remember me

All the faces changed
And the room went round
What a mystic place
What a mystic sound

Well they rolled one for the road
And they candied up their nose
Down the trail they rode
To the Motel Cowboy Show

Hey Ol' Lady let's go
To the Motel Cowboy Show
We'll drink and dance
There's no place else to go
The boys are in their prime
We'll see 'em one more time

Hey Ol' Lady let's go
To the Motel Cowboy Show
