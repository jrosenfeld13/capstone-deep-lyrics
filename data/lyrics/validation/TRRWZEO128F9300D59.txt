I won't be taken...
But I'd give it all to you...
Time heals all wounds....
But I can say this, there's got to be a better way, you can change things on your own
Broken home, your not alone, so now cast the first stone...

And now it feels like, I'm under pressure, (take my life)
Breathing in the last breath of my life
And now all by myself, its unconditional, (take my life)
Breathing in the last breath of my life

One more reason...
You'll never leave this place....
I feel this way....
We'll beat this face to face...There's got to be a better way, you can change things on your own. Broken home, your not alone, so now cast the first stone...

And now it feels like, I'm under pressure, (take my life)
Breathing in the last breath of my life
And now all by myself, its unconditional, (take my life)
Breathing in the last breath of my life

We pray to change our life (but that won't make it right) to take away these lies
(with my last breath)
We pray to change our life (but that won't make it right) to take away these lies
(with my last breath)

You'll never take my life....

And now it feels like, I'm under pressure, (take my life)
Breathing in the last breath of my life
And now all by myself, its unconditional, (take my life)
Breathing in the last breath of my life

Till I Die.....Till I Die....Never take my life.... Take my life!!!
