Love surround me with all your reach
Now while we're here alone
Now our bodies are ocean and beach
Blessings of waves and stones

Floating a lonely sound
You found me
And now that the tide is finally down
Surround me
Surround me
Surround me

And love move for me
Flow beneath the sky
Shadows and silver cross your face
Pools of moon at night

Weak from standing on sandy ground
You found me
And now that I've finally fallen down
Surround me
Surround me
Surround me

Love surround me while you can
Until these waves grow cold
I've gone to leap, cannot stand
I burned before I froze

Running to save my life
Believing you
Now in the heat of this dreadful dry
I'm needing you
Surround me
Surround me
Surround me
