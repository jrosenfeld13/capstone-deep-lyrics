Bam bam bam my sweet
You can sip it through a straw;you can throw it back deep
Just don't be hesitatin', waitin' for it

Cause in an ideal world they'll be comin' for you
Could be tokin' on the bale, could be sniffin' out clues
Better stake your fakin' reputation on it

Do it!
Do it!
Do it!
Just do it!
Do it!

In a Tax-free zone, down a tin can alley
There's a slipper-girl and man name Sally
They were talk-talk-talkin' 'bout a clever little coffin nail

Seems, down at the docks the intended lies awaitin'
And the privlaged information's gonna get wet too
You can't be too careful when it comes to being careful

Do it!
Do it!
Do it!
Just do it!

Do it!

There's a man in my street keeps a flock of gray doves
And he's set in his ways, wearin Everlast gloves
His opinion can be beat when the push becomes a shove

Says he doesn't give a monkey 'bout the youth of the day
They should all drop dead, should be taken away
Put somewhere cold and all be made to stay

Do it!
Do it!
Do it!
Just do it!

Do it!
Do it!
Do it!
Do it!
Just do it!

Bag it up!
Bag it up!
Bag it up!
Just do it!

Bag it up!
Bag it up!
Bag it up!
Just do it!

Bag it up!
Bag it up!
Bag it up!
Just do it!

Do it!
