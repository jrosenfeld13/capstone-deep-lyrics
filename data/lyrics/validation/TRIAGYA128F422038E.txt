And at sunrise
And at sunset
But when night falls
But the music

And at sunrise
And at sunset
But when night falls
But the music

Cascades of color, slip right through your hands
Your castle's in the clouds, turn back into sand
You'll find your swept away with no helping hand
The music is your beacon back to dry land

And at sunrise
And at sunset
But when night falls
But the music

Cascades of color, slip right through your hands
Your castle's in the clouds, turn back into sand
You'll find your swept away with no helping hand
The music is your beacon back to dry land

Oh, the music, now this is why I sing
Oh, the music, my sunrise
And this is why we sing
Bring it back on home
