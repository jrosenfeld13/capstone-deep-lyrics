Now some people call me
The R&B, hippie, neo soul, rockstar
And others they call me
Mr. Grammy nominated, BET award winning

The hustler, hustler, Radio Raheem, Raheem
Mr. DeVaughn, even confused it with Devine
But baby, you can just call me, Mr. Right

Hold up, let me stop you there before you go further

I'm a player, I'm a flirt, a heart breaker, even worse
Don't you date him, you'll get hurt

I'm all cleaned up and ready for love
Don't stop before we start it
Baby, let me show you where my heart is

If you let me be your Mr. Right
I will turn into your Mr. Right now
Let me be the one to treat you right
Girl, I promise I won't let you down

Let me be your Mr. Right, right now
I'ma be your Mr. Right, right now

Now wait, you don't have to worry 'bout yesterday
'Cause everything's subjected to change
See I been there, done that
I changed up my act, I ain't goin' back

Oh girl, yes, I did my dirt but
But, but, I done cleaned the old me up
Don't stop before we start it

If you let me be your Mr. Right

Let me be the one to treat you right

Wet you with my kisses

For every new tomorrow
Season after season
I can't think of a better reason
To wanna be a changed man
