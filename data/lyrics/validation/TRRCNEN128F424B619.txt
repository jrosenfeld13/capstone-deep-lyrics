I've got a fear - it's words I fear
Words can be worse than they appear
A word's a bullet piercing me
Text vitriol potentially
I am so scared I'm unprepared to face the language I have heard
I take offence, context is weaning
In spite of the actual meaning

I've got a fear - it's words I fear
Words that I read, words that I hear
I'm scared to lose, I'm scared to win
Words are a shell and what's within?
Must not offend, must not insult
(Disfiguring the end result)
I make words iconography - the word 'sex' is pornography

I've got a fear of words
ABCDEFG wherein lies the pornography
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
