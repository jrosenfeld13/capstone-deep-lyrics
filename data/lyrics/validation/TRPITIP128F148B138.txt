You are a walking contradiction
You speak with false intentions but I know what you really want from me

You're gonna make me flip this switch, I'm gonna make you my bitch
Now I understand all of the lies you hide and you're gonna make me flip this switch
I'm gonna make you my bitch, but now I understand this

Take your insecurities out on me while I destroy you
Realize that you should never test me

You're gonna make me flip this switch, I'm gonna make you my bitch
Now I understand all of the lies you hide and you're gonna make me flip this switch
I'm gonna make you my bitch, but now I understand this

Lie - don't lie, x3
X2
I will never break (don't lie), x3
I will never break

Now you're gonna make me flip this switch, I'm gonna make you my bitch
Now I understand all of the lies you hide and you're gonna make me flip this switch
I'm gonna make you my bitch, but now I understand this

I understand you

You're gonna make me flip this switch, I'm gonna make you my bitch
Now I understand all of the lies you hide and you're gonna make me flip this switch
I'm gonna make you my bitch, but now I understand this
