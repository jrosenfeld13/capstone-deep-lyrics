Verse 1:
I've seen the rest before
And I've settled for less before
An offer so much more
Has been knocking upon my door
Don't hesitate or so I've heard that
Eventually you'll quit waiting for me
Since I know we both belong in arms in crazy love
I gotta open up before you leave

Chorus:
Baby it's time to get up on track
And give it all back to you
I know you really love me
You're always there for me
Baby it's time to get up on track
And give it all back to you
I could lose you forever
And it's now or never

Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no

Verse 2:
We spend the entire day
How you always knew what to say, ooh
You never asked to stay and I can't believe I couldn't see
Gotta open up before you leave me lonely

Chorus:
Baby it's time to get up on track
And give it all back to you
I know you really love me
You're always there for me
Baby it's time to get up on track
And give it all back to you
I could lose you forever
It's now or never

Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
Now or never
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no

Bridge:
I know we both belong in arms
I know it's crazy love
I know we both belong in arms
I know it's crazy love, it's crazy love

Chorus:
Baby it's time to get up on track
And give it all back to you
I know you really love me
You're always there for me
Baby it's time to get up on track
And give it all back to you
I could lose you forever
It's now or never

Baby it's time to get up on track
And give it all back to you
I know you really love me
You're always there for me
Baby it's time to get up on track
And give it all back to you
I could lose you forever
It's now or never

Bridge:
I know we both belong in arms
I know it's crazy love
I know we both belong in arms
I know it's crazy love, it's crazy love
