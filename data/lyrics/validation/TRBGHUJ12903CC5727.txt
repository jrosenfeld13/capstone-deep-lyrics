Damage is what you and I will find

I sense
You're running out of time
Fragments that you walk on
Craving for a little peace of mind
And I sense
You're running out of time
Fight the tears and walk on
Damage is what you and I will find

Faster then pain
I'll get you out of here
And you won't be back again
All they will find
Is a tiny hole
Black and beautiful

You were the artist but you're dead
And I have no clue
Did you worship moon or sun?
We tried to kill the pilot, too
But we failed
And now the pieces live on

I sense
You're running out of time
Fragments that you walk on
Craving for a little peace of mind
And I sense
You're running out of time
Fight the tears and walk on
Damage is what you and I will find

I sense
You're running out of time
Fragments that you stalk on
You're craving for a little peace of mind
And I sense
You're running out of time
Fight the tears, don't walk on
Damage is what you and I will find

The blast was a mouthful
Echo ringing in the head
(You were the artist but I
Think that you are dead)
Faster than pain
I am a bullet
On my way into your brain
