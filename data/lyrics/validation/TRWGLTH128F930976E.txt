Howling at the fullmoon
In this intense midwinternight
Behold the masters of wilderness
Hearken to how they hold the woods in fright

See the silhouettes in the moon
On the mountaincrest they stand proud
Stormwinds and pouring rain
Hardens the fur grey
Picking up the scent
To hunt the fleeing prey

Masters of Wilderness
Masters of Wilderness

The mighty wolfpack hunts the land
For flesh and satisfaction
Feasting on raw meat with bloody jaws
Tearing the prey open in total desperation
