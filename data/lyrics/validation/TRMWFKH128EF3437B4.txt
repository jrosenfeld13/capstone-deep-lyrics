First gear OW!
First gear OH!
First gear don't you get me down, nuh-uh
I'm overlord in a my-m-my-m M-Mustang Ford OW!

Can I ask you a question?
Can I bear the reply?
First gear... second chance...
It's the third time's charm for new romance, oh...
I wanna brake it with you

Hey, does it feel alright now?
Hey, does it look good too?
Hey, does it feel alright and does it look good--good to you?

OH... First gear... I feel alright, I say all my friends gonna right tonight
Headlights... can't you see that it's all green lights for you and me?
I'm fired up... the engine is ruinning
All my charm and all my cunning GIRL... I wanna brake it with you

Hey, does it feel alright now?
Hey, does it look good too?
Hey, does it feel alright and does it look good... good to you?
