Lying there with my back on a rack
Hole in the corner, my head in a sack
Flat on my back, neck on a block

One sharp knife buried in my wife

Lying there with a ring on her finger
Dying to tell me of her competent lover
If she gives me kisses, chains and three wishes

One sharp knife buried in my wife

She screams and she whores
While unjarring doors
Late last night in the middle of the night
She took the kitchen knife
Kitchen yellow knife
Buried in my wife, buried in my wife

Opened her mouth with a razor blade
Fighting and scratching in a blood red rage
She gives me kisses, my knife never misses

One sharp knife buried in my wife
