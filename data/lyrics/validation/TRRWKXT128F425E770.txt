Open highway it's just me and this empty road ahead
Thinking of life, thinking of home
Our destination seems so far
I hope we never get there

It's times likes these, the little things
Capture this moment in time
Everyone's asleep they're dreaming deep
This music it drives me farther

Cool night breeze the sky is clear
The moon shines light upon this road
Wyoming skyline, mountains fly by
This time is ours
How I feel so blessed

It's times likes these the little things
Capture this moment in time
Everyone's asleep they're dreaming deep
This music it drives me farther

Open highway it's just me and this empty road ahead
