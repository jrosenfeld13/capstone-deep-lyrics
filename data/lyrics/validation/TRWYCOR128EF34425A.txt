[Chorus 1]
I don't mind falling down to try again
'Cause when I get back up on my feet
I make the music stop
So hear me now
Every bridge you cross is burning down
Don't fail me now
Every bridge you cross is burning
(one, two, three, go!)

[Chorus 2]
Brothers, we waited forever
Sisters, come on let's get it together
Brothers, sisters, listen up
Got to little secret that they're never going to stop us
Oh, we'll burn them down

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse]
We can't waste the time we're given now
All bets are off, we're turning this around
'Cause I can smell a rat from miles, miles away, miles away
And I'm ready for it
Awww dip I used that line, line, line again

[Chorus 3] [x3]
Brothers, sisters, listen up
Gotta little secret that they're never going to stop us

[Outro]
Oh, we'll burn them down
