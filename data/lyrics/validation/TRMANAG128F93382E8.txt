With a Vampyre's kiss, I've got a Vampyre's heart
Now I don't roll out of bed till after dark
See my teeth so sharp, and my blood so stale
You know I could drink the world and never get my fill

And when I come, I will come on like a dream
With a crimson moon a shining down upon my Devil's ring

You see it ain't my fault that I am this way
Just a crying in my box for I miss the day
Lord what I would give for just one drop of red
Now the dew is on the grass and I am late for bed

And when I come, I will come on like a dream
With a crimson moon a shining down upon my Devil's ring
