I was at the kind of party where I said I wouldn't go
Look at Vanessa putting on that nasty show
Her look's my language, it fits like piece and carrots
But she prefers to go home with the faggats

It's a bad year for rock 'n' roll
It's a bad year for rock 'n' roll
It's a really bad town for rock 'n' roll

I parked my Volvo horse across the boulevard
And I started singing opera in a karaoke bar
It's a strange town and I can't find my place
What a man has to do to get a decent blow-job these days

It's a bad year for rock 'n' roll
It's a bad bad year for rock 'n' roll
It's a really bad town for rock 'n' roll

Doesn't anybody know how that feels

If my brother's is out on a date, I sit home to masturbate
I switch on MTV and hocus-pocus
An erection in my pants and it ain't got a purpose
I'm switching to the other channels and I don't know which one to focus

It's a bad year for rock 'n' roll
It's a bad bad year for rock 'n' roll
It's a really bad town for rock 'n' roll

Doesn't anybody know how that feels
Doesn't anybody have rock 'n' roll dreams

It's a bad year for rock 'n' roll
It's a bad bad year for rock 'n' roll
It's a realy bad town for rock 'n' roll
