[Verse 1]
Mind, of destructive taste
I choose to stroll amongst the waste
That was your heart lost in the dark
Call off the chase

Walls of thought, strong and high
As my castle crumbles with time
I think of you, oh, yes I do
Such a crime

[Chorus]
You opened fire and your mark was true
You opened fire aim my smiling skull at you
You opened fire
I live tomorrow, you I'll not follow
As you wallow in a sea of sorrow

[Verse 2]
Lines cut across my face
Why you laugh at my disgrace
I'll never know how far to go
To reach that place

[Chorus x2]
You opened fire and your mark was true
You opened fire aim my smiling skull at you
You opened fire
I live tomorrow, you I'll not follow
As you wallow in a sea of sorrow

[Outro]
I live tomorrow, you do not follow
As you wallow in a sea of sorrow
I live tomorrow, you do not follow
As you wallow in a sea of sorrow
I live tomorrow, you do not follow
As you wallow in a sea of sorrow
I live tomorrow, you do not follow
As you wallow in a sea of sorrow
