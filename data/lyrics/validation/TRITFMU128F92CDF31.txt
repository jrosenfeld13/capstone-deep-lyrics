As I went out on a bright morning
To take a pleasant walk
I sat down beside an old stone wall
Just to hear two lovers talk
For to hear two lovers talk, my love
To hear what thay might say
So I might learn a little more, love
Before I go away

Chorus:
P stands for Paddy, I suppose
J for my love John
W stands for false William O
But Johnny is the fairest man
"Johnny is the fairest man," she said
"Johnny is the fairest man
I don't care what anybody says
For Johnny is the fairest man."
Well come on sit beside me, love
Beside me on the green
It's a long three quarters of a year or more
Since together we have been
Since together we have been, my dear
Together we have been
It's a long three quarters of a year or more
Since together we have been
Oh I'll not sit beside you, love
Now or any other time
For I hear you love another little lass
And your heart's no longer mine
"And your heart's no longer mine" she said
"Your heart's no longer mine
I don't cara what anybody says
Your heart's no longer mine."
Chorus
So I will climb a high, high tree
And rob the wild Bird's nest
Back I'll bring what I find there
To the girl I love the best
"To the girl I love the best," he said
"The girl I love best
Back I'll bring what I find there
To the girl I love the best."
Chorus
