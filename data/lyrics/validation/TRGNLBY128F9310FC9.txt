[Verse 1]
Wish I could explain exactly how I feel
In my heart, my head, my body
When you're near
I wish I knew which words to say
When you call my name and I begin to stutter
Wish I knew what I could do to make you fall for me

[Hook]
Cause I, I have been waiting all my life
For someone to come and put things right
Never knew who she was
Never knew what she looked like
'Til now
Everyone said that I would know
When she appears it's gonna show
And now you are here and from where I'm standing
You look like her

[Verse 2]
Everybody needs somebody to see them through
I've been around the world
But baby, here are you
And it's not fair for all these years
I've been right here and only now I find you
Wish I knew what I could do to make you fall for me

[Hook]2
