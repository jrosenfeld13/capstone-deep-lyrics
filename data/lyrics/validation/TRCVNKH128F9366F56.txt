It's a long way back to reality
She puts another Brick in the wall of shame she made so long ago
Trying to figure out where things went wrong
Searching through all the lies she told
Somehow she missed out on all the things that she needed
Most days spent wondering why this life is so cold and nothing ever changes

Screaming for attention, watch the sun steal
Yesterday
Hiding all emotion far away

Trying to find his self confidence
Another broken heart behind the painless smile that he shows Reminded that yesterday is so far gone

And tomorrow is still a miracle
Somehow he missed out on all the things he needed
Most days spent wondering why this life is so cruel.... and nothing ever changes

Tomorrow's still a miracle
