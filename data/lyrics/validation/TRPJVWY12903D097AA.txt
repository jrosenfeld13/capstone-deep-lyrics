[Verse 1:]
Honey, honey
Alright
And I always see you 'round some days are you blind
I moved to ask her mama if she did the women stand in line
Sick boy, sick boy, going 'round remember who's in prayer
Baby, wants to take you out with me
If I'm on my death, my death trip
If I'm on my death, if I'm on my death trip
I never knew you ever made once I care for you
Honey, come and be my enemy so I can love you true
Sick boy, sick boy, baby, now learning to be cruel
Baby, with me in the heat turn me loose on you
Loose on you, honey, loose on you
Honey, loose on you, honey, loose on you

[Chorus:][x2]
All night, all night, loose on you all night
All night, loose on you

[Verse 2:]
Say I give you, you give me
Honey, we are going down in history
Say I give you, you give me
Honey, we are going down in history
Going down, going down, going down[x]2
Don't bite cool bite my lips
See me through on my death trip
You must sink, keep me same

[Outro:]
Keep me, save me, everything
Save me, save me, save me, save me, save me[x4]
I say I'll stick you, you stick me[x2]
Say I bit you, you bit me
I bit you, you bit me
