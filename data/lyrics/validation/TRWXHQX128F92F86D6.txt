Iron curtain crumbling
Warlords increasing
Brothers are clashing
Fire bombs are falling
Far and near places
Religions and races
All the world braces
Has hope left no traces

Chorus:
Be not alarmed
At rumors of war
Be not alarmed
At whats in store
Be not alarmed
At demons roar
Jesus is coming
That war be no more

Powers are scheming
False prophets teaching
The battle is raging
Evil increasing
Legions are swarming
Love is expiring
Saints must be praying
With faith enduring

Be not alarmed
At rumors of war
Be not alarmed
At whats in store
Be not alarmed
At demons roar
Jesus is coming
Peace Hell restore

(Reading from Matthew)

Be not alarmed
At rumors of war
Be not alarmed
At whats in store
Be not alarmed
At demons roar
Jesus is coming
Peace Hell restore

Be not alarmed
At rumors of war
Be not alarmed
At whats in store
Be not alarmed
At demons roar
Jesus is coming
That war be no more...
