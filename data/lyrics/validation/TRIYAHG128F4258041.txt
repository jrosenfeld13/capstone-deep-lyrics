Can you feel me coming
Open the door it's only me
I have that desperate feeling
Trouble is where I'm going to be

I know you hear me knocking
So open the door and set me free

If there's a kingdom behind it all
Is there a God that loves us all
Do we believe in love at all
I'm still pretending I'm not a fool

So in your infinite wisdom
Show me how this life should be
All your love and glory
Doesn't mean that much to me

If there's a kingdom behind it all
Is there a God that loves us all
Do we believe in love at all
I'm still pretending I'm not a fool
