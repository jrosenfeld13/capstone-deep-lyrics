(M. Gray, N. MacDonald)
The sands of time slip away, the pages turn day by day
And every night I pray for you, your guiding light sees me through
Love lasts forever, it never ends, one day in heaven we'll meet again

Chorus:
On the wings of an angel, you will fly
The tears of a nation, we hear them cry
The words that you gave us still carry on
And a new generation will sing your song
On the wings of an angel
You're in my heart and in my soul, emotions I just can't control
Memories will never die, the fire still burns, it keeps you alive, you alive
Love lasts forever, it never ends, one day in heaven we'll meet again

(chorus)
(Sing your song), sing your song (sing your song)
Oh Lord (sing your song), will sing your song
Will sing your song
(Solo)
On the wings of an angel
On the wings of an angel
