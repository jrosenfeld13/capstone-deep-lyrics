Well just because I?m in my teens
And I still go to school
Don?t think that I dream childish dreams
I?m nobody?s fool
Don?t mother me that makes me wild
And please don?t treat me like a child

It?s often said that youngsters should be seen and not be heard
But I want you to realize
That?s quite absurd
Don?t wanna be so meek and mild
So please don?t treat me like a child

Gonna be my own adviser
Cause my mind?s my own
Then I will be much the wiser
My own point of view has got to be known

The best years of my life I know are those when I am young
And since I?m sure that this is so

Gonna have my fun
So if I feel like running wild
Well please don?t treat me like a child

Gonna be my own adviser
Cause my mind?s my own
Then I will be much the wiser
My own point of view has got to be known

The best years of my life I know are those when I am young
And since I?m sure that this is so
Gonna have my fun
So if I feel like running wild
Well please don?t treat me like a child

Don?t ever treat me like a child
