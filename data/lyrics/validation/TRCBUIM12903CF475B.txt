Ive got a feeling
With the wrong people
And I can't control my thoughts

I wish that I could sleep
And just get this over with
This is only high school bullshit

I just want to feel

I was warned
Absolutely numb
No good around people
Everyone knows and watches me

How did I get here tonight?
What am I doing here?
How did I reach this state?
How did I lose my sight?

Im lost, Im freaking
And everybody knows, everyone's watching

So here's all my hopes and aspirations
Nothing but puke
God, I'm so lonely

(?)

How could I be such a stupid bastard?
Ah, you dumb bugger!

I just want to feel
