I loved you, before I knew you lied
I've always been right here
So, don't you try to deny
I've been right by your side

Then you started to tell the truth
About all the girls you knew
I was already over heels for you
I just don't know what to do

Oh, I, I try but I can't shake you
Oh, I, I'm in love with you. I'm in love with you

Leave me alone, stay out late, but don't even call
As long as you come home
Tell me you love me, when you don't at all
As long as you come home
Say you were, when you wasn't hangin' out with your boys
As long as you come home
Boy, you do, you will, you won't, or you don't
As long as you come home

Come tell me all of those sweet lies
You used to whisper in my ear
I don't wanna fight
I just want you near

Don't need my girls telling me
How stupid I am
Want everybody just to let me be
I'm staying with my man

Oh, I, I try but I can't shake you
Oh, I, I'm in love with you. I'm in love with you

Leave me alone, stay out late, but don't even call
As long as you come home
Tell me you love me, when you don't at all
As long as you come home
Say you were, when you wasn't hangin' out with your boys
As long as you come home
Boy, you do, you will, you won't, or you don't
As long as you come home

(whispering)
Come home, come home, come home
Come home, as long as you come home
I love you
I wish that you could give up those streets...
