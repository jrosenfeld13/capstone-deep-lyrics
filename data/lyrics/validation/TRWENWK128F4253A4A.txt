This dream
I cannot shake
Of a place
A very special place
Where you
Are there with me
And we are free
And we are laughing, laughing
('cause there's)

Love
Love that will not end
Hope that will not dim
Words that don't condemn
I call this my Heaven
Mercy lights the sky
Hearts don't have to hide
Tears have all run dry
I call this my Heaven

Some days
I cannot bear
To see how
We hurt each other
My eyes
I shut them tight
And dream about the light
The light
The very special light
(where there's)

Love
Love that will not end
Hope that will not dim
Words that don't condemn
I call this my Heaven
Mercy lights the sky
Hearts don't have to hide
Tears have all run dry I call this my Heaven
I call this my Heaven

I see us...
We are laughing, dancing
We're not afraid
I see us...
We are singing
Our freedom

To the One who made
It so...
Surely that is Heaven
Heaven
Heaven
When I look there
When I look, I see

Love
Love that will not end
Hope that will not dim
Words that don't condemn
I call this my Heaven
Mercy lights the sky
Hearts don't have to hide
Tears have all run dry
I call this my Heaven
(repeat)
