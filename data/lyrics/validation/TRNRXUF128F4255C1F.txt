If you give me the gun
Well I'll shoot myself in the foot
And I want to be different this time
But I know that I won't
So I need a friend
To get me on my feet again
Yeah
I need a friend
This time
Hard working and underslept
But lazy at heart
Everything that you know you want
Seems like no big deal when it starts
So come take my hand my dear
Show me where I should draw the line
Cuz I need a friend
This time
That's why I need a friend
To get me on my feet again
I need a friend
To get me on my feet again
Yeah
I need a friend
This time
To all my brothers before me
Well I can't let you down
But I need you to push me baby
To stop screwing around
Cuz I need a friend
To get me on my feet again
Yeah
I need a friend
This time
