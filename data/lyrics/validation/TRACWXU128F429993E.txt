You could've been all right
You could've been here tonight
You could've been sweet as wine
You could've been a lady

You could've been all right
You could've been here tonight
You could've been sweet as wine
You could've been a lady

They all love you, you're a good girl
When you awake you'll find another man
Lying beside you
They all need you, they all want you
Well, I'll be surprised if you realised
Where you're going to

You could've been all right
You could've been here tonight
You could've been sweet as wine
You could've been a lady ....

If I tell you where you're going to
You'd laugh in my face, I'm out of place
Mind your business
They all want you to make love to
Well, I'll be surprised if you realised
Where you're going to

You could've been all right
You could've been here tonight
You could've been sweet as wine
You could've been a lady ....

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na ....

All right
You could've been here tonight
You could've been sweet as wine
You could've been a lady
