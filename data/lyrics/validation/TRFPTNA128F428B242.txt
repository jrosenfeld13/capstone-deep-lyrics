Paroles de la chanson This Land Is Your Land :
This land is your land
This land is my land
From the coast of Cornwall
To the Scottish Highlands
From the sacred forests
To the holy islands
This land was made for you and me

As I walked out through
The homeless counties
The traffic raging
Raging all around me
I closed my eyes and
Dreamed how it could be
This land was made for you and me

This land is your land
This land is my land
From the coast of Cornwall
To the Scottish Highlands
From the sacred forests
To the holy islands
This land was made for you and me

So I am going
No one can stop me
Where the wild flowers growing
Clean rivers flowing
Fresh winds are blowing
And the tall trees whispering
This land was made for you and me

This land is your land
This land is my land
From the coast of Cornwall
To the Scottish Highlands
From the sacred forests
To the holy islands
This land was made for you and me

I saw a sign there
When I was walking
And on the sign it
Said "No Trespassing"
But on the other side
It didn't say nothing
This side was made for you and me

This land is your land
This land is my land
From the coast of Cornwall
To the Scottish Highlands
From the sacred forests
To the holy islands
This land was made for you and me

As the clouds went rolling
And the church bells ringing
I heard the songs that
The birds were singing
As night came falling
They went on calling
This land was made for you and me

This land is your land
This land is my land
From the coast of Cornwall
To the Scottish Highlands
From the sacred forests
To the holy islands
This land was made for you and me

From the teaming city
I made my escape
To find my place in
The mystic landscape
I'm not the first here
Nor am I the last here
This land was made for you and me

This land is your land
This land is my land
From the coast of Cornwall
To the Scottish Highlands
From the sacred forests
To the holy islands
This land was made for you and me

This land is your land
This land is my land
From the coast of Cornwall
To the Scottish Highlands
From the sacred forests
To the holy islands
This land was made for you and me

This land is your land
This land is my land
From the coast of Cornwall
To the Scottish Highlands
From the sacred forests
To the holy islands
This land was made for you and me

This land is your land...
