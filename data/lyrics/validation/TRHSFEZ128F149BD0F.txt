There comes a time
In everyman's life where he's got to face
The truth no matter what
We are coming to you father
With our sins and everything
To thank you

Those that smoke marijuana
Wanna thank you father
For making it grow internationally
They wanna thank you lord
Even though police cut it down
Sometimes they burn it down
But it grows again
Thank you father

Chorus
We wanna thank you father
For everything you've given us

Nations that oppress other nations
Wanna thank you father
Even though it's painful to be oppressed
But they thank you...
For making them strong

Politicians thank you father
For making them to be able
To lie with a straight face
While the nation cries
They wanna thank you lord

Repeat chorus till fade
