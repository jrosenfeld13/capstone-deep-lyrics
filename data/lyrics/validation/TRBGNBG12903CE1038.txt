Thugs and badmen
Punks and lifers
Fucked up interns
Pigs and snitches

Rest your weary heads, all is well

You won't be strip-searched, torn up tonight
You won't be cut up, bleeding tonight
You won't be strung out, cold, shaking to your bones
Wishing you were anywhere else but right here
So dream on

Thieves and muggers
Tricks and hustlers
Cheats and traitors
Scum and low-lives

Rest your weary heads, all is well

You won't be sad or broken tonight
You won't be squealed on, ripped up tonight
You won't be back-stabbed, double cross, face down
Teeth knocked out, lying in a gutter somewhere
So dream on

Freaks and junkies
Fakes and phonies
Drunks and cowards
Manic preachers

Rest your weary heads, all is well

You won't be pushed or messed with tonight
You won't be lied to, ruffed up tonight
You won't be insane, paranoid, obsessed
Aimlessly wandering through the dark night
So dream on
