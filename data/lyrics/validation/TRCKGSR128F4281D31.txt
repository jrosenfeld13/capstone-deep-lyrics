I'm fine from within
Just better without
This noose around my neck
Is counting me out

Whenever I run
My beautiful sin
Is calling outside
And it's that that reminds me of you

Now our every last effort tried
So far has been denied
It's easy to cry for love
Far harder to try

There goes my guiding light
Farewell my guiding light

I fought my way in
But can't find a way out
Of this weightless regret
Surrounding me now

And whenever I run
Some beautiful sin
Is calling outside
And it's that that reminds me of you

Now our every last effort tried
So far has been denied
It's easy to cry for love
Far harder to try

There goes my guiding light
Farewell my guiding light
