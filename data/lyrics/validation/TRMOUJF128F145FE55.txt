Standing there looking like a star
I knew that you were sure to go far
Now I know youve got no time for me
You took my loving and you want to be free

Keep on pushin on looking for fame
Keep on pushin on Baby Jane

When you walk onto the stage
No-one would ever guess your age
But when you wake in the morning sun
You cant hide those lines from no-one

Keep on pushin on looking for fame
Keep on pushin on Baby Jane

Wholl be there when the fame has passed
Which one of your friends will be last
Ill be there right to the end
Ill be your man, your lover, your friend

Keep on pushin on looking for fame
Keep on pushin on Baby Jane
