Coming like a nightmare word like Im gonna go for it
Fuckin around what ya got to show for it?
Let it be known that Im in the zone
And whatever I need I just pick up the phone
Cuz Im true with it and youre new with it
I just swing the thing and then Im through with it
I dont need friends to act like foes
Cuz Im Nick Hexum the one who knows
About things
Cuz it takes two and we swings better than you
Then its time for the dub so we roll out the club
And you know just what I do
Im hitting in the freak mode
Puttin on a load sippin on a guinny
Then lo and behold on a vision from bottom to top
And I just cant stop
311 show them the air is rarified
But you dont give a damn cuz the groove is hellafied
Grew up punk, listening to funk
Im a hyper type of fella that does not touch junk

Youre the back of the pack and the bottom of the stack
Thats what you get when youre steady talkin shit
Not goin for self that shit is on the shelf
Its 95 and we go for the hive

Listen up this youre gonna bump to this
And if Im feelin mean Im gonna clutch my fist
Now when I say mean, I mean Im gonna rock it
Youre gonna find out kid Im bout to shock it
When Im on Im gone I hear the beat that spawns
The way we freak it and we kick up a storm
The day we turn to pop the show will stop
So feel the beat and get lost now
Back to part 2 the hard way we play
Sublime on time to all the fans Im SA
And if you dont know I say check the show
Do what you got to on the dance floor
Some say the style is wack but I say fuck that
Get the hell back and watch us rock the set
We cast the mold bust it cold explode
Mega trend-setters known around the globe
Friends takin you where you never been
We done what we wanted craftin poems
You can rock there is a glow around you
Lose control holmes just like we do
Hard to obtain brotha whats my name
Mad to find unlike ya mamma and your masquerade
I drive a mach-1 no dashboard Jesus
I hear voices say thats Doug Martinez

Youre all up in my mix like fuckin betty crocker
You think youre playing me but actually youre a jocker
You bad mouth me bitch man you givin me juice
It ain't nothin but a party everybody get loose
Notice what I dont do when stress steps to me
Whatever your complaint so sue me
I say fuck the naysayers and keep goin
Gotta do what I gotta do to get the people glowin
So let everybody gather the more the better
I represent the traveler him hes a shredder

At ease with yourself and dont try to please me
Im just here today then quickly Im out
On the town one light Im a glow worm
For several hours wiggle jiggle like Im a huge sperm
Cant appreciate a brothers love of funky music
You think Im a silly rabbit cuz my style has tricks
Of the way I feel now I just got to rock
The music be poppin through me like electric shocks
I think and blink and I wink but that shits not tiny
Cuz in a blink of an eyelash you will not find me
Youre the back of the pack and the bottom of the stack
Thats what you get when youre steady talkin shit
Not goin for self that shit is on the shelf
Cuz its 95 and we go for the hive
