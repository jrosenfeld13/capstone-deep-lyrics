Hide the truth away for now but not for very long
Knowing what is right for all but still do what is wrong
No knife no rope or handgun but a criminal as well
Peace of mind for future time is what they try to sell
Behind your big black knowing desk
Divine daytime t.v. hiding all the truth from all
With no integrity
No kife no rope or handgun but a criminal as well
Peace of mind for future time is what htey try to sell
God needs some donations I guess he's got to pay his rent
Old lady stands at a mailbox with a social secruity check
Send him all your money to keep his program on
So tomorrow he can tell you that all you do is wrong
