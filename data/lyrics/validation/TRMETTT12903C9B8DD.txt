What if I was in your dream?*
Maybe you'd believe
Maybe it would be real to me
Crawl
All these miniaturized fantasies when you deserve it all
And I'd wait but youd make me wait just grab your hand and say
I don't mind if I have to sit and wait
Cut diamonds on my teeth
Skin off my taint
Feels good so much the soul flows like I said we flow
I don't mind
I don't mind when you turn and walk away
Myself is out of control
Myself is out of control
Witness what no one sees
Your laziness as you fall apart on the sidelines
As the rain will fall on power lines
This Freaking out and disposing
And I think I witness miracles from sipping on your potion
The words are garbled like alphabet soup
Served by an image of your mother dressed in last night's clothes
Covered in a big wet smile
I don't mind
I don't mind when you turn and walk away
Myself is out of control
Myself is out of control
Insane with your brain
God knows all facts in your brain
Search through the tired and mended scene
All your body falls absentee
Myself is out of control
Myself is out of control
Myself is out of control
Myself is out of control
