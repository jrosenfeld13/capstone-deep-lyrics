On the inside
Of you and i
Burning out our true desires
With spit and fire

Open up your chest
Put my hand inside
It's dishwater warm
Smooth as porcelain
And it flakes away like red rust

Take those lazy drugs away
Turn to me instead
I'm dishwater warm
Smooth as porelain
And i'll flake away like red rust

Everything expires
Tonight there's no denying
Even you and i will die
So why are we hesitating?

Knowing that you've opened up
Yourself to me is no victory
But a consolation prize will suffice tonight

Everything expires
Tonight there's no denying
Maybe you and i should try
All the things
We are too scared to try
