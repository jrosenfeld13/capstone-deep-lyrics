Is seventeen so far away from here
At twenty-one I live a different life
I never dreamed I could
And as I pick up pieces I can't let go
Of that old never-ending nightmare

I remember times when sky's were grey
Innocence ran through our bones
You and I had much to say
I know you'll take me home
Again...

Last night those cops came to arrest you
What'd you do this time
Was is far from home
Well I've seen you twice in the last ten months
Now your gone again
So far from home

I remember times when sky's were grey
Innocence ran through our bones
You and I had much to say
I know you'll take me home
Again...

I have found life
And took the time to
Never fear and sing for death
I'm not a victim
Your not the answer
I can't control
My own life

The earth turns but we don't feel it move
I've found a better life I'll promise you
