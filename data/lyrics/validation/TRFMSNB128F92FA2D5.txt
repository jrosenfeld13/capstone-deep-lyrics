Worked two jobs everyday
Never had no fun
You really did rack up the pay but now your
Days are done
Saving for the times ahead
Never got that far
Oh a heart attack has left you dead
Now you cant save no more

Rich man in the graveyard
Workin like a slave
Now in the end whats evil Lord
How much did you save?

Worked your fingers to the bone
Never took a wife
You and your money were alone
On the last day of your life
Didnt smoke, didnt drink
Work on isnt hard
You just never had the time to think
Took me quite off guard

Life is precious
Life is short
You did what you thought best
You just never got to use your heart
For it laid you to rest
