Step 1... Step off to the dance floor
Step 1... Step off to the dance floor
Push (hey) ((push up on it))

Every time u get some
People wanna take it back
They rather see u on the run

Change up like a sock
Every time they try 2 clock u
Tick more than they tock

[Chorus]
Push i push
Don't let them pull u down, yeah

Until u get 2 higher ground
Push
U're never 2 young, never 2 old
Push
Don't stop until u go

[Verse 2]
Did u ever stop 2 wonder
Why u put another down?
No man should asunder
The joy that another man found
Maybe About the business u was worried
Wasn't ever filed in your name
Maybe the cartridge u was playing
Don't fit in your video game

[Chorus]

Don't let them pull u down
Push i push
Until u get 2 higher ground

[Tony M.]
I push for a beat that is greasy
I'll dis a beat if it teases
Mark this down as i state it...
I like my funk concentrated
The pop seem, hmmm, a little overrated
U sure can tell where we're stepping
There's some grease on the stage
Ooops, i just stepped in it... (push)
Circling as we slide
The full stride for the ride
On a watered-down tip
We could never get by (push)
Fellas... (get on the mike)
Check it out, here's what u gotta do (push)
Gotta step in the room with the mood
Never juicing yourself
Just a confident attitude (push)
Believe me, u will get busy
Your mouth'll drop open
[As u watch the slimmies funking] (push)
But u don't want the one who's jocking
Cause it's all about the clocking (push)
Step 1, step off 2 the dance floor (push up on it)
There ya go, y'all, yeah (push)

(1...Eno... 1,2,3) (push, push, push)
Push up on it (get on the mike, woman)

(Get on the mike)
(Prince...)
You don't want me on the mike push up on it

No man, u don't want me on the mike (don't stop until u go)
(Get on the mike) push up on it
(Push)

[Prince]
It's thunder when i'm on the mike (push) i push
Daddy pop's in the house
And you're sure 2 like his diamonds (push) i push
Sure 2 like his pearls
I'm good 2 cream every boy and girl
Cause i'm a stolling
Steady hip-hop rocking rolling (push)
A willing and able horny pony
And i'm pumping them, i'm pumping them, (push)
I'm pump-pump-pump-pump-pumping them
From pakistan 2 poland (push)
Straight into your town
Snatching up kiddies (get on the mike)
Like a circus clown (get on the mike)
(Push)
(Get on the microphone)

[Rosie Gaines]
Well, all u people out there, (push)
You'd better beware
Cause they call me Rosie G
And i just don't care (push)
I like 2 step, all night long
Rapping, hiphoping, and pushing this song
The song gets higher and it sets u on fire (push)
Like the lion in the jungle (get on the mike)
It takes you all higher (push)
My momma said "girl, u know it ain't cool, (get on ...)
Said ya don't wanna play by nobody's rules"
I said "momma chill out, (push)
And give me a break, cause
I know i got just what it takes" (push)
I said "momma don't put me under pressure (get on, get on ...)
I love u and i think you're fresher - push" (push)
Everybody here we go, come on now
A-push if ya wanna push
A-come on, a-come on, a-come, a-come p-p-push it, push (push)
(Push it) (push)
(Push it) (push)
