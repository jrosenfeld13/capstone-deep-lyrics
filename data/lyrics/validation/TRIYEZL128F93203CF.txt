Sometimes we talk, we talk oh so much
Sometimes we talk, we talk so damn much
That we forget why we ever started talking
In the first, the first place

In a land of pirates, I'd be more concerned
With what comes from your mouth and what you believe
So flood your deck with quips fit for royal tea
I bet your ship sinks with the wave of so many

Energy, by nature, perspectives
Divergent views on the surface underneath connected
And what a state we're in when we can't forgive anyone
For the same mistakes we've made ourselves a million

Times before we've become
To place the blame on others'

In a land of pirates, I'd be more concerned
With what comes from your mouth and what you believe
So flood your deck with quips fit for royal tea
I bet your ship sinks with the wave of so many

We have begun to replace wisdom with vanity
And hold others accountable for the coalition of our own feat

In a land of pirates, I'd be more concerned
With what comes from your mouth and what you believe
So flood your deck with quips fit for royal tea
I bet your ship wrecked with the weight of so many

There's a battle in a backyard alley
Brothers fight over almost nothing
These siblings will be sad to find that war is the winner
We keep fighting for position in a human race that never began
Where the start and the end are both made up with same thing
