Just because you left and said goodbye
Do you think that I will sit and cry
Even if my heart should tell me so
Darling, I would rather let you go

Just because you think that you're so smart
Going around and breaking lover's hearts
Before I let this thing happen to me
Darling, I would rather swim the sea

I know you think you're smart
Just going around breaking lover's hearts

Just because I want someone who's kind
With a heart as good and pure as mine
But maybe I am asking far too much
Darling, please don't ever break my heart

I know you think you're smart
Just going around breaking lover's hearts

Just because I want someone who's kind
With a heart as good and pure as mine
But maybe I am asking far too much
Darling, please don't ever break my heart
