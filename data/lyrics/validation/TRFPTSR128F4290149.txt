Look what's been done, John
It's coming out of the east like rain, Johnny
Look what's been done, John
It's coming like a God with no name, Johnny

And I'm out near Santa Fe
Hitching out for the warmer days
I'm all broke up, Johnny
It all just beat me down, beat me down

Look down the line, Johnny
There's flashlights on the back-roads, Johnny
Look down the line, Johnny
Of the American unknown, Johnny

And I'm out here in the desert
All your dreams lie dead in the desert
I'm all torn up, Johnny
It all just beat me down, beat me down

Look at that girl, Johnny
Yellow hair a shine, Indian eyes to see, Johnny
Look at her, Johnny
Her love is like anything to me, Johnny

What slipped so deep into me?
I can never get it out of me
I'm all broke up, Johnny
It all just tore me down
