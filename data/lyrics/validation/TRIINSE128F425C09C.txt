Way out on the ocean
Far beyond the seven seas
There's a tiny little boat
Faith is keeping her afloat
And a tiny little skipper with his worn and tattered coat

You see the law of the ocean
Says that you shall never fail
Use your heart as a rudder
Faith as a compass
And a blanket for a sail

Sleep for the weary
And dreams for us all
Rest your head on a pillow
And I'll tell you a tale
Use your heart as a blanket
And a blanket for a sail

Row, row, row your boat gently through a dream

Way out on the ocean
Far beyond the seven seas
There's a tiny little boat
Faith is keeping her afloat
And a tiny little skipper with his worn and tattered coat

You see the law of the ocean
Says that you shall never fail
Use your heart as a rudder
Faith as a compass
And a blanket for a sail
