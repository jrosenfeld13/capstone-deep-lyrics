L na mara
L na mara n rabharta
Guth na dtonnta a leanadh
Guth na dtonnta a leanfad 
L na mara n lom tr
L na mara n rabharta
L an ghainimh, lom tr
L an ghainimh

(The day of the sea
The day of the sea or of the high tides
To follow the voice of the waves
I would follow the voice of the waves
The day of the sea or the ebb tide
The day of the sea or of the high tides
The day of the sands, the ebb tide
The day of the sands)

Can you feel the river run?
Waves are dancing to the sun
Take the tide and face the sea
And find a way to follow me

Leave the field and leave the fire
And find the flame of your desire
Set your heart on this far shore
And sing your dream to me once more

'S mo laoch mo ghile mear
'S mo Shasar, gile mear
Suan gan san n bhfuair m fin
 chuaigh i gcin mo ghile mear

(He is my hero, my dashing darling
He is my Caesar, dashing darling
Rest or pleasure I did not get
Since he went far away, my darling)

Now the time has come to leave
Keep the flame and still believe
Know that love will shine through darkness
One bright star to light the way

'S mo laoch mo ghile mear
'S mo Shasar, gile mear
Suan gan san n bhfuair m fin
 chuaigh i gcin mo ghile mear

Amhrn na farraige
r ar na seolta
Amhrn na farraige
Ag seoladh na bhfonnta...

(Song of the sea
Gold on the sails
Song of the sea
Sending the melodies...)

Lift your voice and raise the sail
Know that love will never fail
Know that I will sing to you
Each night as I dream of you

'S mo laoch mo ghile mear
'S mo Shasar, gile mear
Suan gan san n bhfuair m fin
 chuaigh i gcin mo ghile mear

Ag seinm na farraige
Ag seinm na farraige
(Playing the sea
Playing the sea)

Seinn... Play...

'S mo laoch mo ghile mear
'S mo Shasar, gile mear
Suan gan san n bhfuair m fin
 chuaigh i gcin mo ghile mear

Gile mear, the wind and sun
The sleep is over, dream is done
To the west where fire sets
To the gile mear, the day begun

'S mo laoch mo ghile mear
'S mo Shasar, gile mear
Suan gan san n bhfuair m fin
 chuaigh i gcin mo ghile mear

'S mo laoch mo ghile mear
'S mo Shasar, gile mear
Suan gan san n bhfuair m fin
 chuaigh i gcin mo ghile mear

 chuaigh i gcin mo ghile mear
(Since he went far away, my darling)

Amhrn na farraige
r ar na seolta
Ag seoladh na bhfonnta
(Song of the sea
Gold on the sails
Sending the melodies)
