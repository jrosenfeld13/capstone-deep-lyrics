[Verse 1]
I've been in a rut
Back and forth enough
Heart like a wheel
Without you around
So uncomfortable is how it feels
Every time you're near
Trouble disappears under the ground
But when you go too far
Silver clouds will start hanging around
And I know why

[Chorus]
Tried to run
But I keep on coming back full circle
And I can't jump the track
Can't let you go, oh, oh, oh
Tied to one
So I keep on coming back full circle
'Cause I know you'll come around, you'll come around

[Verse 2]
Skipping down a broken path
How long can I last?
Please let me know
Where's the finish line?
'Cause I've got to find somewhere to go
I don't want to hear people interfere
What do they know?
What I feel inside when I'm up all night
Needing you home?
I don't know why

[Chorus]
Tried to run
But I keep on coming back full circle
And I can't jump the track
Can't let you go, oh, oh, oh
Tied to one
So I keep on coming back full circle
'Cause I know you'll come around, you'll come around
'Cause I know you'll come around, you'll come around

[Bridge]
I'll keep on running 'til we meet in the middle
I'll put pride aside, and I'll give just a little
There's miles to go, but we both know that we'll make it
And I know why

[Chorus]
Tried to run
But I keep on coming back full circle
And I can't jump the track
Can't let you go, oh, oh, oh
Tied to one
So I keep on coming back full circle
'Cause I know you'll come around, you'll come around

[Outro]
I know you'll come around
You'll come around
Yeah, I know you'll come around
You'll come around
