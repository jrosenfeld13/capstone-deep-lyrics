The sweeter he is
(The longer the pain is gonna last)

I didn't ask to fall in love with you
But you were so sweet
Tell me what else could I do?

But one day you said
You didn't want me no more
(Oh,yes, you did)
And my heart's still aching
From this terrible blow

The sweeter he is
The longer the pain is gonna last
(Oh, yes, it will)

In your own way
You made me feel like a queen
You built me up so high
(Oh, yes, you did)
Oh, I gave you my everything

Oh, but one day
You took your good love away
(Oh, yeah)
And oh, that's why I'm here
Suffering, suffering today

The sweeter he is
The longer the pain is gonna last
(Oh, yes, it will)
The sweeter he is
The longer the pain is gonna last
(Oh, yes, it will)
