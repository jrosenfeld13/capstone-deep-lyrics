In this dirty old part of the city
Where the sun refused to shine
People tell me there ain't no use in lyin'

My little girl you're so young and pretty
And one thing I know is true
You'll be dead before your time is through

See my daddy in bed,he's dyin'
You know his hair is turning gray
He's been workin' and slavin' his life away

We gotta work
Work
We gotta work
Work
Work
Work
Work

We gotta get out of this place
If it's the last thing we ever do
We gotta get out of this place
Girl there's a better life
For me and you
