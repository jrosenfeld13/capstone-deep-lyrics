I thought that I could forget
And try to tell myself we never met
Though you try, you can't deny
The feeling of your heart
Though you try, you can't deny
A true love when it starts
I guess that I was just a fool

I guess I'll go on loving you
Even though I know our love will never do
Though you try, you can't deny
The feeling of your heart
Though you try, you can't deny
A true love when it starts
I guess that I was just a fool
