Start the car lets make a midnight run
Across the river to South London
To dance to the latest hi-fi sound
Of the bass, guitar and drum

Seekin' out a rhythm that can take the tension off
Steppin' in and out of that crooked crooked beat

Take a piece of cloth, a coin for thirst
For the sweat will start to run
With a cymbal splash, a word of truth
And a rockin' bass and drum

(Chorus)

One by one they come on down
From the tower blocks of my hometown
Steppin' with the rhythm of the musical beat
Drownin' out the pressure of the crooked street

(Chorus)

It has a crooked past this crooked street
Where cars patrol this crooked beat
Badges flash and sirens wail
They'll be takin' one and all to jail

Whooooo
Prance! Prance! You want a law to dance?
Whooooooo

This particular one is a crooked crooked beat

Whaaaa
It's a bird, it's a plane
No, it's a dog (?)

(Chorus)

(Repeat 1st verse)

Seekin' out a rhythm

This particular one is a crooked crooked beat
