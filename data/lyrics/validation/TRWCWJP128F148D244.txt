[Verse 1: Willie Hutch]
Out there, out there, out there, out there, out there
It's so sad, how people won't respect the ways of one another
But pretty soon they're gonna find out
They'll have to learn to love one another
Do do do Dough
Don't you know
Ain't no, hope
You'll be out there, out there, out there
There
Out there
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Out there
You'll be out there, there, out there
Lost

There's no way back
There's no way back
There's no way back
You'll be out there, out there, out there
