Hanging out, down the street
The same old thing we did last week
Not a thing to do, but talk to you

Steal your car, and bring it down
Pick me up, we'll drive around
Wish we had a joint so bad

Bust a street light
Out past midnight

Hanging out, down the street
The same old thing we did last week
Not a thing to do, but talk to you
