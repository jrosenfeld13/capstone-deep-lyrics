In a tiny little house me and my girl
Take a little trip around the world
In the moonlight, in cheap black and white
We love to lay around in bed
Playing tourist in our heads
Travelling light in cheap black and white
Oh how we love to spend the day
Dreaming under skies of gray
Anything we might desire
Comes to us through the wire
See our great leader speaking his mind
Picture postcards for the blind
A beautiful sight in cheap black and white
See kennedy's kids on Hollywood squares
Latest hits and foreign affairs
We grow up tonight in cheap black and white
Oh how we love to spend the day
Dreaming under skies of gray
Lofty goals and cheap desires
Fuel that will cool the fire
This fancy island sure is nice
Seems almost like paradise
Close but not quite
In cheap black and white
In cheap black and white
In cheap black and white
