One thought leads to another
All i have in this life are my brothers
Stuck with me throught thick and thin
I never said we live this life without sin
Born in this world to live like a slave
A one way ticket headed straight to your grave
Got my back cause i got yours
A death grip like a pit bulls jaws
Instant death squad
Always there for you when you needed me
Never turn my back on my family
We would keep it real just to survive
Swarming like killa beez around the hive
Come in full force cause i've got these
If you think a creeping ya best to bring hercules
Don't try to test my crew ain't fake
Outline in chalk it's your body we'll make
IDS IDS
Instant death squad
IDS IDS - don't you ever fuck around
We're one bound by blood
We won't stray from our ways
Stay true till the day we die
Don't fuck around
Never get in our way
I don't care what you say
If you think that you can play you better think again
All this rage i have in my
On your face i'll set it free
You're the next victim to be handled by me
Never get in our way i dont care what you say
If you think that you can play you better think again
All this rage i have in me
On your face i'll set it free
You're the next victim to be handled by me
We're one bound in blood
We won't stray from our ways
Stay true till the day we day
Dont fuck around we'll make you pay
Instant death squad
