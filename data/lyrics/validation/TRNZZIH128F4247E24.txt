Now it's time to walk the line
It's a beauty so pure and so fine
Watch the chumps go floatin' by
Three suckers high in the six-five
I think it's time to meet her
It's so easy to please her
Now we take it all 'til the end of time
She's a ride, she's a sweetie pie
Took a month but now I'm movin'
Back to the world where I belong in
Don't mind the fuzz, we'll burn 'em up
We're so bad when we f*** it up
Rollin' in downtown
To get our kicks underground
She's all mine, she's givin' me sunlight
Feelin' her curves, now I'm livin' the high life
Ain't nothin' gonna stop the rock tonight
I got the rock tonight
Feelin' good it's so right
Ain't nothin' gonna stop the rock tonight
