I don't know what
But I see this more to this
It's not just something in the air

I'l come running to help you out
When your hour of darkness comes
Remember there's a strength inside of us

Are we more than human?
Will we be more than a memory?
Just fragments of a distant stop

Am I more than human
And one day I'll fly away
Maybe I'll go back to where I once came from

Breathing, bleeding
Do I have a choice in it
They can deal some dangerous cards

Who knows what tomorrow brings
Like butterflies in spring
Who rest for a moment
Before they fly into eternity

So we find that human
What is this I feel inside
'Cause one day I may fly away

Sometimes we're more than human
And maybe we'll change one day
Someday...
Someday...
Someday...
Someday...
