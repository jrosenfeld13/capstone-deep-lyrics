Sickly surrender to cola remember machines
Shaky somnambulist, shiver out all your screams
Go to the room with the chair and wait for your life
Scared that the voices I hear may never be mine

Seven December, a paperback letter recalls
You knew such happiness, crashing her loveliness one wedded fall
Cutting through gray where youre holding the pages amazed
Cutting the picture to ribbons in winter parades

Pale new dawn, put something on
Youre thinking faster than I run
Now the more I get connected, the less I know who I am
And it feels like Im the only one

The month has gone rabbits, the winter is taking my life
Am I a passenger passing through scenes in someone else's life?
Cold will outlast me, apartments are castles in space
Warm with the void, holding court in a four poster grave

Pale new dawn put something on
I hate the shape of things to come
Now the more we get connected, the less I know who you are
I don't think you thought that far

They gave you a food stamp
For the air sucking wound in your chest
All the best
All the best

Strange pale fighter, you only grow lighter in time
Willfully silent, declaring yourself with your cold scribbled rhyme
Making her find you beneath all the skin of your mind
Shes digging towards nothing, a hollowed out center in time

Pale new dawn put someone on
I hate the shape of all you want
Now the more you get connected, the less I get who you are
But I dont want to think that hard

Its a lonely way to live
When you take what you give and you dont give in
In a nation of promises
Your anonymous promises
