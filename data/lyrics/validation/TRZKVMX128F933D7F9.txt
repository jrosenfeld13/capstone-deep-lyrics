[Verse 1]
Hold up
Hold on
Don't be scared
You'll never change what's been and gone
May your smile
Shine on
Don't be scared
Your destiny may keep you warm

[Chorus]
'Cause all of the stars have faded away
Just try not to worry
You'll see them someday
Take what you need
And be on your way
And stop crying your heart out

[Verse 2]
Get up
Come on
Why you scared?
You'll never change what's been and gone

[Chorus]
'Cause all of the stars have faded away
Just try not to worry
You'll see them someday
Take what you need
And be on your way
And stop crying your heart out
'Cause all of the stars have faded away
Just try not to worry
You'll see them someday
Take what you need
And be on your way
And stop crying your heart out

[Chorus]
When all of the stars were faded away
Just try not to worry
You'll see us some day
Just take what you need
And be on your way
And stop crying your heart out
Stop crying your heart out
Stop crying your heart out
Stop crying your heart out
