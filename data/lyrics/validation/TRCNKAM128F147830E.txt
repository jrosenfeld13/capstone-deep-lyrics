[Chorus:]
Oh Lolita
Girl ya make it so hot
It's likes I got a fever
Oh Lolita
I think I need ya now
I could tickle your pink
If ya let me get down

I see a dancer by the juke box, drinking sangria
Down in Mexico where the carbo cantina
I said "hey senorita come an dance with me"
If ya haven't got a man that's what I plan to be
Now move a little closer
Put your hands on my body
I'm trapped in the moment, I can hardly breathe
A combination of you plus some melody
Got me feeling like tonight might be meant to be

She looked at me, like I looked at her
Then she licked my lips, I said "it's on for sure"
Now baby don't stop, I'm feeling you
Can't put my finger on one thing
Its everything you do
I say we have a drink or two
Just to set the mood
An head down to the beach on a rendezview
We can dance on the stars
Swing from the moon
From Carbosanlucas all the way to Kankoon

[Chorus:]
Oh Lolita
Girl ya make it so hot
It's likes I got a fever
Oh Lolita
I think I need ya now
I could tickle your pink
If ya let me get down

First I think it's over
Then she does it again
She makes me feel so good
I don't want it to end
An I can't pretend I don't feel the way I do
My eyes used to wander
Now I've only eyes for you
Your a breath of fresh air
A dream come true
I might have come with my friends
But I'm leaving with you
Ain't a doubt in my mind
Its about that time
We head back to my room
An begin to unwind
I can take off your clothes
You can take off mine
I'll stand and deliver
Sending shivers up your spine
There's no need to rush
We can kiss an touch
Rock around the clock
Yeh baby don't stop
Cause you make it so hot
Your mind likes a?? And loves all I got
Is all we got
Is all we need
So you just come with me an see
I could blow your mind or my pretty baby

[Chorus:]
Oh Lolita
Girl ya make it so hot
It's likes I got a fever
Oh Lolita
I think I need ya now
I could tickle your pink
If ya let me get down

[Tc]
Oh Lolita
I can't let you go
We're moving so fast
We can't take it slow
Oh Lolita
I can blow your mind
Why don't you come with me
We could spend some time
Oh Lolita
Won't you come with me
I wanna show you how fun life can be
I wanna show you all the things you've never seen
Grab a hold of my body
Spend the night with me

[Chorus:]
Oh Lolita
Girl ya make it so hot
It's likes I got a fever
Oh Lolita
I think I need ya now
I could tickle your pink
If ya let me get down

[Tc]
Oh Lolita
I can't let you go
We're moving so fast
We can't take it slow
Oh Lolita
I can blow your mind
Why don't you come with me
We could spend some time
Oh Lolita
Won't you come with me
I wanna show you how fun life can be
I wanna show you all the things you've never seen
Grab a hold of my body
Spend the night with me
