[Verse 1]
First to fall over when the atmosphere is less than perfect
Your sensibilities are shaken by the slightest defect
You live you life like a canary in a coalmine
You get so dizzy even walking in a straight line

[Verse 2]
You say you want to spend the winter in Firenza
You're so afraid to catch a dose of influenza
You live your life like a canary in a coalmine
You get so dizzy even walking in a straight line

[Chorus 2]
Canary in a coalmine
Canary in a coalmine
Canary in a coalmine

[Verse 2]
Now if I tell you that you suffer from delusions
You pay your analyst to reach the same conclusions
You live your life like a canary in a coalmine
You get so dizzy even walking in a straight line

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 1]

[Outro]
Canary in a coalmine
