I've tried to let you down so easy
I'd like to still be just a friend
We shared such memories together
But all good things come to an end

And you shouldn't take it so hard
You shouldn't take it so hard
Oh, you shouldn't take it so hard

You shouldn't take it so hard
You shouldn't take it so hard
No, you shouldn't take it so hard

So hard, so hard, hard

You wonder when you're gonna see me
I might just pass this way again
Until then don't you wait up for me
'Cause now I'm getting in the wind

You shouldn't take it so hard
Oh, you shouldn't take it so hard
Oh, you shouldn't take it so hard

You shouldn't take it so hard
Oh, you shouldn't take it so hard
You know, you shouldn't take it so hard

So hard, so hard

Don't you remember what I told you from the start
When people fall in love too much it can cause a broken heart
That won't mend easy but if you just wait sometime
I may come walking to you in the sunshine

You shouldn't take it so hard
You shouldn't take it so hard
No, you shouldn't take it so hard
[unintelligible] a-flowin' and I gotta be a-goin'

You shouldn't take it so hard
You shouldn't take it so hard
You shouldn't take it so hard
