When I was a young man
I found an old dream
Was as battered and worn a one
As you have ever seen

But I made it some new wings
And I painted a nose
And I wished so hard
Up in the air I rose, singing

Carry me, carry me
Carry me above the world
Carry me, carry me, carry me

And I once loved a girl
She was younger than me
Her parents kept her locked up in their life
She was crying at night
She was wishing she could be free

'Course mostly I remember her laughing
Standing there watching us play
For a while there
The music would take her away
And she'd be singing

Carry me, carry me
Carry me above this world
Carry me, carry me, ooh
Carry me above the world

And then there was my mother
She was lying in white sheets there
And she was waiting to die

She said if you'd just reach
Underneath this bed
And untie these weights
I could surely fly

She's still smiling but she's tired
She'd like to hear that last bell ring
You know if she still could she would
Stand up she could sing

Singing carry me, carry me
Carry me above the world
Carry me, carry me, carry me
