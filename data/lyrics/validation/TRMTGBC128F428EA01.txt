Her hair is Harlow gold, her lips sweet surprise
Her hands are never cold, she's got Bette Davis eyes
She'll turn the music on you, you won't have to think twice
She's pure as New York snow, she got Bette Davis eyes

And she'll tease you, she'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious, and she knows just
What it takes to make a crow blush
She got Greta Garbo's standoff sighs, she's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll let you take her home, it works her appetite
She'll lay you on the throne, she got Bette Davis eyes

She'll take a tumble on you, roll you like you were dice
Until you come out blue, she's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll expose you, when she snows you
Hope you're pleased with the crumbs she throws you
She's ferocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a crow blush
All the boys think she's a spy, she's got Bette Davis eyes

And she'll tease you, she'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious, and she knows just
What it takes to make a crow blush
All the boys think she's a spy, she's got Bette Davis eyes
