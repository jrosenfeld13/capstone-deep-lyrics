Someone's taught the cat to moonwalk and it's become a real show-off
The party's already falling apart but we all play along it's rolling on
The host eyeballs the fire alarm. Our welcome's become undone
The party's already falling apart but we all play along it's rolling on

TV's on, volumes down, anchormen guest star on each other's shows
We're listening to field recordings of gleaners singing in some ex-Soviet state
And hope's shadow's shape may change like names
But doing what you want will never pay well

Someone's peanut-buttered the poor cat's paws
I've misunderstood him all along
And hope's shadow's shape may change like names
But doing what you want will never pay well
