You took a silver train
All the way to Maine
On the way to everything
Railroad wings

There's things you don't know you know
I thought anger had told me what to do
With emptiness chasing me
On the border I found you
You should've heard her sing
Railroad wings

This emptiness has followed me like a cold blue sky
And it has not been easy for you
There's things I'll never tell you till the day I die
Things I've done I can never undo
Hiding everything
Railroad wings

All these years along, the lights are growing dim
I hear you sing your song in the next room
And as far as I can tell, most everything means nothing
Except some things that mean everything
Railroad wings
Railroad wings
Railroad wings
Railroad wings
Railroad wings
