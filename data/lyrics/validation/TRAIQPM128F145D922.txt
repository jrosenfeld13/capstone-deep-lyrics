Oh I'd work for you, I'd slave for you
I'd be a beggar or a knave for you! (what is a knave anyway?)
If that isn't love it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along

I'd gladly move the earth for you, (yeah I'm strong baby, plenty strong)
To prove my love and it's worth to you;
If that isn't love it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along

With all the words, dear, at my command
I just can't make you understand;
I'll always love you darling, come what may
My heart is yours, what more can I say? (what do you want me to do, rob a bank?)

(well listen, I tell ya)
I'd sigh for you, yeah, cry for you
I'd tear the stars down from the sky for you!
If that isn't love, well skip it, it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along

I'd sigh for you, die for you
I'd tear the stars down from the sky for you!
If that isn't love, it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along
9yeah, that's the real thing, so help me!)
