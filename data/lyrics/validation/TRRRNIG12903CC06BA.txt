Remember when you were a schoolgirl, schoolgirl
When we played love games like children do
And in some games I used to pull your hair
And other games at your house with no one there

Schoolgirl, schoolgirl - those loveletters that you handed to me
Schoolgirl, schoolgirl - early Mondays and Sundays for tea
I must have been a fool not to fall for you
When you were a schoolgirl

Remember when you were a schoolgirl, schoolgirl
Those holidays when I showed you what I had
Remember when your mother caught us there
My father kept me in for being bad

Schoolgirl, schoolgirl - those loveletters that you handed to me
Schoolgirl, schoolgirl - you were everything a schoolgirl should be
I must have been a fool not to fall for you
When you were a schoolgirl

Schoolgirl, schoolgirl - those loveletters that you handed to me
Schoolgirl, schoolgirl - early Mondays and Sundays for tea
I must have been a fool not to fall for you
When you were a schoolgirl

Remember when you were a schoolgirl
