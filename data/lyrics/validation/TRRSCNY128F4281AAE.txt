I was born secular and inconsolable

I heard that he walked, he walked the earth

God goes where he wants

And who knows where he is not

Not in me

It's the way mothers greet their sons

When it's a moment too late

It's the law of the land

That sometimes the dam just breaks

God works in mysterious ways

And God gives and then he takes

From me
