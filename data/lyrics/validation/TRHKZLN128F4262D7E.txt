This Circus That You Call The Rodeo
You pulled up in that limousine, said
Cowboy let me take you for a ride
It was obvious to me, I was something new that you had never tried
So I gathered up my saddle, took my hat off and I dusted off my clothes;
And crawled in to the back seat of the circus that you call the rodeo

I spent a week in heaven making love and drinking beer right by the pool
Every night a different party, I was fittin' in with all those other fools;
But too much of a good thing ain't no good thing that a cowboy oughta know;
The difference in the new thing at the circus that you call the rodeo

He said, ride cowboy ride, we're bullet proof and almost ten feet tall
I said, maybe you are, but I'm whipped and I can't hardly even ride at all
Ain't there any lettin' go, in this circus that you call the rodeo

I've done a lot of crazy things;
This may not be the worst, but it comes close
I've busted bulls and they've busted me and I've paid the price for everything I rode;
And it breaks my heart to tell you, but I'm leavin' this old dog and pony show;
I've had all that I can handle in this circus that you call the rodeo

You said, ride cowboy ride, we're bullet proof and almost ten feet tall
I said, maybe you are, but I'm whipped and I can't hardly even ride at all
Ain't there any lettin' go, in this circus that you call the rodeo
Ain't there any lettin' go, in this circus that you call the rodeo
Music continues, then fades
