[Verse 1]
Got these feet in these shoes
They walked a mile or two
Got these legs, they've done work
That left them black and blue
Got these hips, they are wide
But they know how to move
Got these hands to lift the weak
Or slap down a racist fool

[Chorus]
Mmm hmm, mmm hmm
This is all I, this is all I got
Mmm hmm, mmm hmm
This is all I, this is all I got

[Verse 2]
Got this place I call my home
But it's no Taj Mahal
Got these pockets, they ain't full grown
But I won't steal from no one
Got this heart, well it's been broke
But it's still beating strong
Got this song, it ain't much
But it helps me carry on

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Got a will that lifts me up
When my body can't
Got a way of getting through
With no helping hand
Got a mind that lends me strength
So I am free to stand
Got a love so deep in me
Can't be stopped by any man

[Chorus]
