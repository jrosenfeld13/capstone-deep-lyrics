Drive, you're not going to be prepared for this
You've left a trail of red and crossed it on your front door
And now I'm here
So you're first on my list of things to do today

Follow me outside and I'll feed those hungry eyes of yours

So bring out the deathcar and we'll drive tonight
You're only making this worse
So bring out the deathcar and we'll sleep tonight
Just say the words and this will all end right now

Let's close the door and start the fun
I really do hope youre comfortable
I strap you down and chose my tool because
First the arms and then the eyes, I'll leave the hands
I know you touch her with them
You make me fucking sick

Swallow your last breath of air, feel your lips grow cold

So bring out the deathcar and we'll drive tonight
You're only making this worse
So bring out the deathcar and we'll sleep tonight
Just say the words and this will all end right now

You drove me to this, how will I ever stop
I'm addicted to kill as much as I am to you

So bring out the deathcar and we'll drive tonight
You're only making this worse
So heres the deathcar and we will feast tonight
Just say the words and this will all end
Now you can see how it feels
