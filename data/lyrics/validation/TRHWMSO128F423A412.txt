[Intro:]
La La, La, La
La, La La, La La
La, La, La, La, La
It's one of those songs
You just gotta, put a name in front of
When you making dedications
And it's gonna say whatever you want
You know what I mean

[Chorus:]
Girl if your in your car, or the crib
Listen, reminence
Know that this song is for you
It's for you, it's, it's for you
And you know who you are, your my heart
I'm missin', been missin' you
Know that this song is for you, oh
It's a way to say "I love you"

[Verse 1:]
Maybe you was out there creepin'
You know, only you know
Or maybe you was doin'
All the things you suppost to do, oh yeah
Either way it goes, this song covers it
Baby you can press play and just walk away
Cause if your tryna get right
Or just saying "I love you"
Love you, I love you

[Chorus:]
Girl if your in your car, or the crib
Listen, reminence, just listen girl
Know that this song is for you
It's for you, it's, it's for you
And you know who you are, your my heart
I'm missin', been missin' you
Know that this song is for you, oh

It's a way to say "I love you-ou-ou"

It's a way to say "I love you"
Way to say "I love you" oh, oh
It's a way to say "I love you-ou-ou"
It's a way to say "I love you-ou-ou"
I love you, yeah
And you know it girl

[Verse 2:]
100 ballons sent to your job today
Later on, when you get home
100 roses leadin' through the doorway
I hope that you like that baby
Girl the waters so hot and ready
I know, I know that, it might not be much
But it means so much
Just a way to say "I love you-ou-ou"

[Chorus:]
Girl if your in your car, or the crib
Listen, reminence
Know that this song is for you
It's for you, it's, it's for you
And you know who you are, your my heart, oh yeah
I'm missin', been missin' you
Know that this song is for you
It's a way to say "I love you"

It's for you
For you, for you
And oh yeah
Way to say "I love you-ou-ou"
And nobody body
Oooohh
Ain't nobody but you
Ain't nobody but you
Ain't no body but you, you, you, you
Ooooh, yeaaah
