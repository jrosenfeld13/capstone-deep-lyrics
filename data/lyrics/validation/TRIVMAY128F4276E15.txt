Sweetness and light, you were right
Summers are getting harder
Days echo by, blood red sky
Chop wood and carry water
We only do what we can and there's a natural plan, you know
I know that you understand cause you're just that kind of man, you know
Oh we try and try
We cry, baby cry
Everybody knows we get nowhere
Again and again forever till the end
Anywhere you go I will go there
Bones in the road getting older
If only it made me smarter
Eyes on the prize, don't think twice
Just chop wood and carry water
Am I still looking for clues
And I just feel so confused, you know
And I am so scared I can't move but there's just one thing to do, you know
Oh we try and try
We cry, baby cry
Everybody knows we get nowhere
Again and again forever till the end
Anywhere you go I will go there
