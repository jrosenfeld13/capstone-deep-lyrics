[Verse 1]
Lately I have been working overtime
You've been taking a class at night
Even though we've got bills still left to pay
I think we should just slip away

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see you in the sun
Sippin' on that Coke and rum
Come on, girl lets take a ride!

[Chorus]
Rolling through the sunshine
You right here by my side
Wind Surfin in the Wind
On a wave that never ends
Ain't no chance of rain
Just good times on the way
Tom Petty on the Radio
Free Fallin' as we go

[Post-Chorus]
We can leave it all behind
Go rolling through the sunshine

[Verse 2]
Grab you sunglasses
I'll grab my guitar
The nearest beach can't be that far
Say goodbye to your stress and your cell phone
We can put the whole world on hold

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see you in the sun
Sippin on that Coke and rum
Come on, girl lets take a ride!

[Chorus]
Go rolling through the sunshine
You right here by my side
Wind Surfin' in the wind
On a wave that never ends
Ain't no chance of rain
Just good times on the way
Tom Petty on the radio
Free Fallin' as we go

[Post-Chorus]
We can leave it all behind
Go rolling through the sunshine

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see you in the sun
Sippin' on that Coke and rum
Come on, girl lets take a ride!

[Chorus]
Rolling through the sunshine
You right here by my side
Wind surfin in the wind
On a wave that never ends
Ain't no chance of rain
Just good times on the way
Tom Petty on the radio
Free Fallin' as we go
We can leave it all behind
