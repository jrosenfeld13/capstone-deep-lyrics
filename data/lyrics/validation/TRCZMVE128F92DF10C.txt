It takes too much to please me
Attached but no real feeling
High fives and corporate anthems
Nothing comes to mind

Kitemarked for true low standards
Where more wants all and no less
Just change with no real progress
Nothing comes to mind
I want higher
Still nothing comes to mind

Give me a low five
Cause i can't help myself
I'm a low five downsize no-one else
Do you love yourself ?

These altered states and egos
Potential less than zero
Found god in san diego
Nothing comes to mind

I half expect to find myself
In full control of nothing else
Last hope but learnt to hope less
Nothing comes to mind
I want higher
Still nothing comes to mind
