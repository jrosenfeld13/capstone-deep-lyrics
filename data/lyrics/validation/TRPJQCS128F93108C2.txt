I bet you think it's the last time
Your head is spinning and you wonder why
He's not missing you
But don't take my word, do what you want to
Chasing a rockstar
But where will you go?
You're chasing him too far
The way you move so slow-woahoh
You swear you're innocent
But I know that you'll regret
Chasing a rockstar now
Get over yourself
You wanna take a chance
But you keep thinking we'll end in romance
He's not missing you
Don't take my word, do what you want to
I guess now it's up to you
Chasing a rockstar
But where will you go?
You're chasing him too far
The way you move so slow-woahoh
You swear you're innocent
But I know that you'll regret
Chasing a rockstar now
Get over yourself
Why can't
You stay
Right where you are
You're losing track of me so let's start this over tonight
Give up your dreams
And say goodbye
Chasing a rockstar
Chasing a rockstar
But where will you go? (where will you go?)
You're chasing him too far
The way you move so slow-woahoh
You swear you're innocent
But I know that you'll regret
Chasing a rockstar now
Get over yourself
Chasing a rockstar
You're chasing a rockstar
Chasing a rockstar now
Get over yourself
Get over yourself
