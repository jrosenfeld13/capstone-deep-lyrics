The world is just a playing field for man
And the blanket sky will cover every last event
From the battles of the ages to the baby sleeping tight
I could sing a rhyme and try to
Find the reasons for each place and time
To wrap the world around my mind, but I know at best...

Words were never meant for
Explaining the mystery of our day
We're so afraid of what's at stake when we die
Still I never wanted to live in such fear of the unknown
Or the reasons for pain in this life

I still wonder what we're doing here
As I stare into the midnight sky, confronted by my fears
Is there something worth redeeming
In this old and tired world?

Or has all been lost
Because every change will have its cost
And I can see, there's still an ember
Left of something good
I know at best...

Words were never meant for
Explaining the mystery of our day
We're so afraid of what's at stake when we die
Still I never wanted to live in such fear of the unknown
Or the reasons for pain in this life

I could sing a rhyme and try to
Find the reasons for each place and time
To wrap the world around my mind
But I'd regret the time poorly spent
Because I know at best...

Words were never meant for
Explaining the mystery of our day
We're so afraid of what's at stake when we die
Still I never wanted to live in such fear of the unknown
Or the reasons for pain in this life
