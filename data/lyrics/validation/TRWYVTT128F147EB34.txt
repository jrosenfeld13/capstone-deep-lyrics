[Chorus:]
Fellas
There's a jealous girl in our town
Ohh, baby
Fellas
There's a jealous girl in our town
Ohh, baby

[Verse 1: Bobby]
I know you feel about
Me and my girl
But I gave you the first chance to
Be in my world

Now you are saying things
To keep us apart
You had the very chance to
Be in my heart

[Hook:]
When I loved you
You didn't love me
Our love had no unity
All you ever told me were lies
It's my girl I know you despise

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 2: Bobby]
Girl I really hope you find another
I just can't take no more
Of you tryin' to be my lover
(Ooh)

You see
I've got what I want
And what I need
So girl
Won't you please try
Just to leave

[Repeat Hook:]

[Repeat Chorus:]

Oooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oo

[Ralph]
There's a jealous girl
In our town
There's a jealous girl
In our town
There's a jealous girl
In our town
There's a jealous girl
In our town

[Bridge: Mike (Ronnie)]
Hey, girl (hey, girl)
Why are you so jealous?
I mean (Why you so jealous?)
You had your chance
If you loved me so much
You wouldn't let me go (let me go)

Face it, girl
It's time for someone else
All those times when
I tried to show you how much I loved you
(All those times I tried to show you how much)
And how much I cared for you (I loved ya)
You never seemed to have the time
(I let go)

Girl, it's hurtin' me
As much as it's hurtin' you
But that's just how life goes
(That's how life goes)

You win some
You lose some
Sweetheart
Point blank
You lost this one

[Ricky]
I just wanna let you know
That it's hurting me so
Girl, I just had to let you go

[Bobby]
There's a jealous girl
In our town
And it's you
Girl it's you

[Ralph]
There's a jealous girl
In our town
There's a jealous girl
In our town
There's a jealous girl
In our town
