If you learn to drive
I can use the train and the bus
When you're mobile, we'll go
Take my toys and your cat with us
We'll leave the violence
We'll have something to do
With a couch-bed in the front room for when we fall out or when our friends come through
It's painting a kitchen that's keeping me going
And we've already named the seeds I'll be sowing
And when they've grown up (that's hoping that I don't shoot blanks), could we move right up north

Find a house near the shores and the banks?
With a big f**k-off telly
A brand new stereo system
We'll meet old friends at funerals
And pretend that we've missed them
And if they were here
They'd say it was shocking to find
We've already named the dog we'll be walking
It's choosing a mattress that's keeping me going
And we've already named the seeds I'll be sowing
