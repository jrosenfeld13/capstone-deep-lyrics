Have you ever had a woman that you didn't deserve?
She's giving all she has but you still don't got the nerve
Settle down, stop running around with her heart, yeah
I should have told her I was trouble right from the start

Why should she wait till tomorrow
When she knows I'm not giving all I've got?
Why do I wait till tomorrow
When I want to be everything she needs today?

I want to be what she needs, oh

I've been wasting my time living fancy free
So many ways to spend my money on things for me
Like big gun and old guitars, nothing too much for me
She waits at home alone where I should be

Why should she wait till tomorrow
When she knows I'm not giving all I've got?
Why do I wait till tomorrow
When I want to be everything she needs today?

I'm gonna find my way, I'm going to tell the truth
Give me the strength to say, I need her always

Will she be here tomorrow
When she knows I'm not giving all I've got?
I'm not gonna wait till tomorrow
I want to be everything she needs

Why should she wait till tomorrow
When she knows I'm not giving all I've got?
Why do I wait till tomorrow
When I want to be everything she needs today?

Give you what you need, yeah
