[Verse]

There is nothing you can do that I have not already done to myself
There is nothing you can do that I have not already done to myself
There is nothing you can DO that I have not happily done to myself
No, there is nothing you can do that I have not already done to myself!

[Hook]

Never wanted to dance with nobody, not you!
Never wanted to dance with nobody, but you-
Never wanted to dance with nobody, but you-
Wouldn't take "no" for an answer, you fucking bitch!

[Bridge]

Be nice!
Be nice to me
Don't let me bleed
Be nice!
Be nice to me
Don't let me go! (don't let me go)
I'm too cool for the second grade!
I'm amazed!
I'm afraid!
I'm too cool for the second grade!
There is nothing!
You can do!
That I have not already done to myself... HEY!

[Verse]

There is nothing you can do that I have not already done to myself
There is nothing you can do that I have not already done to myself
There is nothing you can DO that I have not happily done to myself
No, there is nothing you can do that I have not already done to myself!

[Hook]

Never wanted to dance with nobody, not you!
Never wanted to dance with nobody, but you-
Never wanted to dance with nobody, but you-
Wouldn't take "no" for an answer, you fucking bitch!

[Bridge]

Be nice!
Be nice to me
Don't let me bleed
Be nice!
Be nice to me
Don't let me go! (don't let me go)
I'm too cool for the second grade!
I'm amazed!
I'm afraid!
I'm too cool for the second grade!
There is nothing!
You can do!
That I have not already done to myself...

[Hook]

Never wanted to dance with nobody, but you-
Wouldn't take "no" for an answer, you fucking bitch

Never wanted to dance with nobody, not you
Never wanted to dance with nobody, but you
Never wanted to dance with nobody, but you-
Wouldn't take "no" for an answer, you fucking bitch!
