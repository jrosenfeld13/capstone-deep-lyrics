Roll uptown to midnight
Then roll on downtown till its light
Because tomorrow we may die
Oh but tonight were dancing in the fate light
Dont you
Rob yourself of what youre feeling
Dont rob yourself of all that you could be
Roll hard til midnight
Roll til its light
Come on now

Stay up and make some memories here
With us now
To roll red carpet out with friends
To love and roll on
Our love is so right
I wont waste a minute here tonight
Our love is so right
And tonight my dance is all about you

To midnight love you
Roll on and run the red lights
Game now is keep it tight
How I love her pretty rock and roll kisses
Come on and stay with me
Roll on and run the red lights
Come this love is so right

Stay up and make some memories here
With us now
To roll the red carpet out with friends
To love and roll on
Our love is so right
I can taste were in it here tonight
Our love is so right
And tonight my dance is all about you
Im going crazy and its all cause of you
Its all cause of you
Im going under over you
Over you

This time now is so alive
Everybodys trance dancing tonight
So beautiful and so strange
It was empty till you came
