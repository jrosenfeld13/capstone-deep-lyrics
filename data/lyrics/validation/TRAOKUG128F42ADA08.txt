Everyday is so wonderful
And suddenly it's hard to breathe
Now and then I get in insucure
From all the pain, I'm so ashamed

I am beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful in every single way
Words can't bring me down
So don't you bring me down today

To all of your friends you're delirious
So consumed in all your doom
Trying hard to fill the emptiness
The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone

You are beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring you down
You are beautiful in every single way
Yes words can't bring you down (ohhh noo)
So don't you bring me down today

No matter what we do
(No matter what we do)
No matter what we say
(No matter what we say)
We're the song inside the tune
(We're the song inside the tune, yeaaahhh)
Full of beautiful mistakes
And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go)
The sun will always shine (the sun will always, always shiiiiiiine)
And tomorrow we might wake
On the other side

'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say
Yes words won't bring us down
We are beautiful in every single way
Yes words can't bring us down (ohhh noo)
So don't you bring me down today

Don't you bring me down today

Don't you bring me down... Today
