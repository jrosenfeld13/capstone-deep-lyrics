You wanna see me hang around
Don't bother me
Well, you wanna know if I'll get down
Can't you see

Stick it in (Gene Machine)
Shove it up
Are they still humans?
With brown eyes (Dream Machine)
With brown hair
Created scientifically

You wanna see me hang around
Don't bother me
You wanna know if i get down
Oh, can't you see
Come on open up your eyes
Truth is there to see
There is to be in reality

Gene Machine (Gene Machine)
Are they issues?
Dial-a-gene, buy-a-gene (Dream Machine)
Take a second look did one just pass by way?
Gene Machine (Gene Machine)
Gene Machine (Gene Machine)

You never know one
When you see her
Quite aware
Mistaken identity
Oh, gene machine
Under H.I.M
We pray not take the other
