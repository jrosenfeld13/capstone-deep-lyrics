Feeling the sunlight breaking down our souls
Learning that love will soon be the sign
Promise of new days, and a new day will be born
Feeling the sunlight beating down us all

I will wait
Here inside the stolen one
In love for all
And i cry
For the death of our dove
Another lover paints the sky

Feeling the sunlight breaking down our souls
Learning that love will soon be the sign
Promise of new days, and a new day will be born
Feeling the sunlight beating down us all

I lie awake
Alone with these burning scars
And the sunlight is gone
The stratus
Covers the sky you lie upon
And i can't wait

And we, we could lie there together
And we, we could lie there forever
And we, we could lie there together
And we, we could die there together

Feeling the sunlight breaking down our souls
Learning that love will soon be the sign
Promise of new days, and a new day will be born
Feeling the sunlight beating down us all

The stratus covers us all
