[Verse]
TV dinners there's nothing else to eat
TV dinners they really can't be beat
I like them frozen but you understand
I throw them in and wave them and I'm a brand new man oh yeah!
TV dinners they're going to my head
TV dinners my skin is turning red
Twenty year old turkey in a thirty year old tin
I can't wait until tomorrow and thaw one out again oh yeah!
TV dinners I'm feeling kinda rough
TV dinners this one's kinda tough
I like the enchiladas and the teriyaki too
I even like the chicken if the sauce is not too blue
And they're mine, all mine, oh yeah
And they sure are fine
Got to have them
Give me something now
