You travel through my blood coursing through my veins
And today, the memory like a shadow I can't shake

(French verse)
I confess you've got a hold on me
But I never fall this easily

Your history seems to shroud you like a plague
And you wonder why this thought keeps you awake

I never asked you to step inside my skin
I let you stay here haunting me within

(French verse)
I confess you've got a hold on me
But I never fall this easily

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
