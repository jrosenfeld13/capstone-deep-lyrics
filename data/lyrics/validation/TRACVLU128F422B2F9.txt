Music: Lynch

Morning comes too soon
Another day unfolds and the rains are cold
That fall on you
I wanna tell you
But I can't seem to get it
Can't seem to get it right
Oh, it's killing me
I realize that it cuts me deep inside
When I can feel in my soul
This empty whole you took from me
Cause on and on
You keep tellin' me the things that make you smile
If I could hold you somehow
And show you now
That the tears in vain will never ease the pain

Oh, I, I can only see
As far as you
You're never to far away
Oh my eyes can only see
What I feel for you

I could fly the heavens
Although the distance may be far
I'm just one dream away
And the tears will say
That there's no turning back
Quiet in my thoughts
Safe within myself
I reach out to a time
When you laid by my side
And oh how it felt so right
Don't you even worry now

Through these eyes
