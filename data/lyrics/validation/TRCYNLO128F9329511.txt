I can see you in the darkness
Can look into your mind
You cannot hide yourself
Your whole life from me

Never want to wait for you and
Never want to play your game
Thou must be for your vision and democracy
Never want to wait for you and
Never want to play your game

Would you cry for me?

Things will never change
I can't believe your eyes
I would die for you
Would you cry for me?

Would you cry for me?

Never want to wait for you and
Never want to play your game
Thou must be for your vision and democracy
Never want to wait for you and
Never want to play your game

Would you cry for me?

Never want to wait for you and
Never want to play your game
Thou must be for your vision and democracy
Never want to wait for you and
Never want to play your game

Would you cry for me?

Thou must be for your vision and democracy
