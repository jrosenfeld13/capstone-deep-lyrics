[Verse 1]
Love, barely alive in your arms
Slave
Dreams, taken too far every night
Slave

[Chorus]
Who put on your heart?
Who put on your heart?
Who put on your heart?

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I can't change, no

[Verse 2]
When you're on your own, you can see
Things
Clear, clear as a bell and you're free
Slave

[Chorus]
Who put on your heart?
Who put on your heart?
Who put on your heart?

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I can't change, no

[Bridge]
And my girl, we'll say goodbye
To the things we'll never try

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Who put on your heart?
Who put on your heart?
Who put on your heart?

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I can't change, no

[Outro]
Love, barely alive
Love, barely alive
Love, barely alive
Slave
