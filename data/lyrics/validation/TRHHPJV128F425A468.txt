Last night I dreamt a strange, peculiar dream
A child slept underneath a great bird's wing
Laid on the ground where warmth was found
Until he woke and crawled away on hands and knees

Flying In My Dream

A snake told stories to the child untrue
The child bent down and felt its poison tooth
Started to die, the bird did fly
Swallowed the snake to save the child, and then he died

Flying In My Dream

The dead bird laid, for three whole days
Then spread its wings and flew away

I woke up early while the sun still slept
This strange dream circulating in my head
Stared at the ceiling, pondered its meaning
The dream would not leave me although I left my bed

Flying In My Dream

The dead bird laid, for three whole days
Then spread its wings and flew away

In My Dream
