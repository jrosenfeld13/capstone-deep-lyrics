Your brother was a friend of mine
Nobody but a live wire
Can I sing it out
Can I say it loud
Still looking for that old fire
Tracing the fall of my angel

Catch it in the wind
It's still smoking
Burning up cause your sister is torn
And I'm living in another dimension
What I see is my own invention
Tracing the fall of my angel

At home with my own mutation
Cigarette burns in the subway station
Sometimes I forget they're down there in the walls
Tracing the fall
Of my angel
Catch it in the wind
It's still smoking
Burning up cause
Bour sister is tokin
And I'm living in
Another dimension
What I see is my own invention
Tracing the fall of my angel

Tracing the fall of my angel
Tracing the fall of my angel
Can I find the fire
In me to fight
