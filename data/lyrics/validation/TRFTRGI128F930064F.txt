How many people would you say
That you have met
That are worth a good goddamn?

'Cause I've met too many people
That I'd never like to see again

In all our desperation
To be the same in our differences
You won't last
You won't last
You won't last

In a world that's constantly changing
You can't grab tenaciously to whatever you please
And hope to be happy

Change your clothes every few months
And change your albums when
You need to impress
You need to impress
You need to impress someone

To feel alright
How empty do you have to be
To whore yourself ?

How many people would you say
That you have met
That are worth a good goddamn?

'Cause I've met too many people
That I'd never like to see again

In all our desperation
To be the same in our differences
You won't last
