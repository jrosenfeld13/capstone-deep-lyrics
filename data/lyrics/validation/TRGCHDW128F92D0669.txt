Yeah, ain't that a pity
People ain't that a cryin' shame
Ain't that a pity
I declare it's a cryin' shame
She wait till it got nine below zero
And put me down for another man

I give her all my money
All of my lovin' and everything
All of my money
All of my lovin' and everything
It done got nine below zero
And she done put me down for another man

Nine below zero
The little girl she done put me down
Nine below zero
The little girl she done put me down
She know I don't have nowhere to stay
And I don't have not one dime
