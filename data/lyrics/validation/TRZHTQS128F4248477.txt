In the last days of September
Winds were blowing down our blocks
Knocking down, the dead old trees
Rocking ferries and the docks

Popped a benny, drank some beers
Then pissed off the fucking pier
They cursed the god who made the winds
Of piss drenched shoes and socks

(Chorus)
Lend me this month's rent, my dad just bought a round
You'll get your money right before I leave this town
Lend me this month's rent, I'm working underground
Claiming all my riches, at the lost and found

For a while I was painting houses
In San Francisco coastal lots
In the evening I would drink my wages
On the weekends, down the slots

The bartender raved at me
Over a lousy cup of tea
"You must be a phony drunken poet
'cause I've fucked all the jocks and cops!"

(Chorus)
My dad just needs to get some air
He's underneath the vents
He's begging for a chair and he'll lend me
This month's rent
This month's rent!

My friends are all stoned and booking venues
While I'm lying on the floor
My dad worked for 35 years
I believe I'll work for more

I  caught ___  with a shot
Then I  chased  with what I got
If you are waiting for me
Your ____  the fucking door

(Chorus)
