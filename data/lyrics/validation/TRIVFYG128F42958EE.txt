He tried to look like he had a little bit of money
A grifter with a southern drawl
Well I could tell right away by the the way he was runnin'
That the boy was just a beggin' to crawl
At least a junkie knows what he needs
You get a man all strung out on greed
And he'll give up everything he's got for just one shot of having it all

He took every last cent of his savings
On a trip to the local track
He had a tip from a friend
Bet it all down to win
On a horse named Heart Attack
Well now he ain't no fool, boys, he didn't bet it all
So everything was cool when that horse took a fall
But then he turned around and blew the rest
Trying to win it back

He wanted easy money
It's sad but it's true
Everybody wants the most they can possibly get
For the least they can possibly do
They want that easy money
I don't understand
God they scheme and they plan
But they can't get their hands
On no easy money

Now she'd been watching him from a table
Not too soft but not too tough
Well she figured by the money he'd been throwing around
That he was damned sure good looking enough
So she worked her way over, she shot him a wink
He took his last five bucks, he bought her a drink
By the time they hit the Motel Six
They figured they was in love, love, love, love

She loved that easy money
It's sad but it's true
Everybody wants the most they can possibly get
For the least they can possibly do
They want that easy money
I don't understand
Lord god, they scheme and they plan
But they can't get their hands
On that easy money

It must have been about two weeks later
He got a call from a business friend
Who'd found a sure fire steal of an investment deal
And honey, guess what, he's gonna let both of us in
So they took all her savings out of the bank
And on the way home they stopped to gas up the tank
She stepped in for some ciggs and she never saw the fucker again

He got that easy money
It's sad but it's true
Everybody wants the most they can possibly get
For the least they can possibly do
He thinks it's easy money
He don't understand
If you scheme and you plan
You ain't got your hands
On no easy money
You scheme and you plan
You ain't got your hands
On no easy money
