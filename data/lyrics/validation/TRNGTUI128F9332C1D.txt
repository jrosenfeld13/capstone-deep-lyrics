Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh
Woah-oh-oh

Slapped my face, slammed the door
A dozen roses lay on the floor
I saw her friends and I was told
She blocked my number from her cell phone
You said we were meant to be
Now this obsession is killing me
Until I have a heart attack
Ill keep on trying to win you back

[Pre-Chorus]
Alone at last
I cant wait till were alone at last
All I wanted was a second chance, second chance
To hold you in my arms at last

[Chorus]
Forever, forever
Ill walk a thousand miles
Just to tell her, to tell her
Our love is still alive
And Ill never, Ill never
Ill never let it die
Well, youd better watch your step
Shes a diamond on a landmine

Im not so sure about this word
But she kept calling me insecure
I tried to quit but theres no use
Cause Im addicted to her abuse
Shes in control of everything
Im just a puppet, she pulls my strings
Denying truth, Ill test my fate
And keep on playing this wicked game

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Better watch your step
Shes a diamond on a landmine
Better watch your step
Shes a diamond on a landmine
Waiting to explode

Were dancing on thin ice before
Frozen from the winters cold
And if it were to crack below
Id never let you go

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

You better watch your step
Shes a diamond on a landmine
Better watch your step
Shes a diamond on a landmine
Better not touch
Shes a diamond on a landmine
Better to forget
Shes a diamond on a landmine
Waiting to explode
