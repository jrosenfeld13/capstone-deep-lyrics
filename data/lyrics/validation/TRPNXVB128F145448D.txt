I hang on my computer
Obsessed with late night mails
I press return to sender
And sweep the Holy Grail

The air has gone electric
I feel my legs go weak
Your presence is effective
I start dancing like a freak

O-o-o-oh, do you think I'm looking tragic
O-o-o-oh, 'cause I can't stop this voodoo magic
O-o-o-oh, you have cast a spell on me tonight
Magic, voodoo magic, voodoo magic, voodoo magic

I had a close encounter
The third and last degree
I'm locked inside a spaceship
And you have got the key

You must have been an angel
Who lost the grace of God
Cause I can't help repeating
Your sweet hymn on my ipod

O-o-o-oh, do you think I'm looking tragic
O-o-o-oh, 'cause I can't stop this voodoo magic
O-o-o-oh, you have cast a spell on me tonight
Magic, voodoo magic, voodoo magic, voodoo magic

A dream within a dream
Behind the screen lies another dream
Within a dream
A scene within a scene
Beyond your dream I'm your heroine

O-o-o-oh, do you think I'm looking tragic
O-o-o-oh, 'cause I can't stop this voodoo magic
O-o-o-oh, you have cast a spell on me tonight
Magic, voodoo magic, voodoo magic, voodoo magic
