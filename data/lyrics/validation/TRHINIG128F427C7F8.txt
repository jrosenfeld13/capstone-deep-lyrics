It's a jungle out there
Disorder and confusion everywhere
No one seems to care
Well, I do
Hey, who's in charge here?

It's a jungle out there

Poison in the very air we breathe
You know what's in the water that you drink?
Well, I do, and it's a-ma-zing

People think I'm crazy
Cause I worry all the time
If you paid attention
You'd be worried too

You'd better pay attention
Or this world we love so much
Might just kill you

I could be wrong now
But I don't think so
Cause it's a jungle out there
It's a jungle out there
