Listen

[Intro: Sara Johnston]
This is my special moment in the spotlight
A pretty young thing right here to rock the mic

[Pre-Chorus]
Rock the mic
Like I know you do it, right? Yeah!
Rock the mic like you do it all night!

[Verse 1: James Di Salvio]
Well come on party people with the ha-ha hoo!
We breakin' bum shaking beats for your boog-a-loo
We going to shock your mind with this new deja-vu
And guess what Ruth Buzzie we love you
You see the bran clown taking you down, no frown
I got the foxy uber ladies from the underground
Said you used to be lost but now I'll be found
Like the Puerto Rican passion on the Brooklyn bound
Going uptown, midtown, downtown
Bran Van say: verb to the noun

[Sara Johnston]
This is my special moment to shine in the spotlight
A pretty young thing right here to rock the mic

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
With the old school, new school come on
(bob you head to the mid-school)
With the old school, new school come on
(bob you head to the mid-school)
Old school new school
(Even in-between school
Whatcha gonna do when you get out of law school)
Old school new school
(Even in-between school
Whatcha gonna do when you get out of law school)

[Liquid]
I don't know about touching the mic tonight, the clubs really of packed?

[Sara Johnston]
It's okay, touch the mic

[Liquid]
You sure?

[Sara Johnston]
Yeah, touch it

[Verse 2: Liquid]
Come a little closer try to touch it with desire
This man's on a mission to set this mic on fire
Like a fish on a hook, bird on a wire
Let me stand before the truth girl, fire
Cause, cupid had an arrow for the pharoah, so he shot
Made me want it how I want it but this fire's damn hot
Too hot to hold too damn good to fold
I gotta tell you how I tell you so the truth be told

[Chorus]
For the old school, new school, come on
(bob your head to the mid-school)
It's the old school, new school, come on
(bob your head to the mid-school)

With the old school new school
(Even in-between school
Whatcha gonna do when you get out of law school)
Old school new school
(Even in-between school
Whatcha gonna do when you get out of law school)

[Outro]
My Cart-e-sian quotient of my calibration
Got us qualified for this deviation
As I lose myself in you
Yes I lose myself in you

It's my moment to shine and rock the mic
