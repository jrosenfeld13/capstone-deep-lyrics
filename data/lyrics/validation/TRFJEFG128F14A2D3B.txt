I should've known something was going on
When I saw old Rufus running down the road;
His eyes were burning and his head on fire
He couldn't stop mumbling but I don't know why

I fled the palace and I jumped the wall
Spotlights hit me and I had to fall
The earth was trembling so I had to freeze
And that voodoo woman kept me on my knees

Snake bite love

When she moved to town the moon turned red
Strange things dancing 'round in my head
I'm hearing voices that I can't see
Can anybody tell me what has happened to me

Snake bite love

I don't know how this can be
I got the fever to a hundred and three
Mojo hand and a black cat bone
She's the demon that stole my soul

Snake bite love

I can't take this anymore
I got the fever to a hundred and four
Black cat bone and a mojo hand
She's the demon and I'm her man

Snake bite love
