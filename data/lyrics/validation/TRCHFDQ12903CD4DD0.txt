Leave in an instant
I won't blame you
I guess I would hate me too
It's crazy I know
So you should go
I didn't know what else to do

Admit if you're scared
You so wanna cry
Don't understand
Just how I dared

I did the only thing
The only thing that felt right
To a fucked up mind
You wouldn't understand it
'Cause you're not that kind

Don't be so sad
It makes me feel stupid
Like I really did something bad
It wasn't hard and I didn't think
Oh how low can I sink

Admit if you're scared
You so wanna cry
Don't understand
Just how I dared

I did the only thing
The only thing that felt right
To a fucked up mind
You wouldn't understand it
'Cause you're not that kind

It's too late baby
I can't change a thing
Would you feel better
If I'd smile and sing

I did the only thing
The only thing that felt right
To a fucked up mind
You wouldn't understand it
'Cause you're not that kind

The only thing that felt right
To a fucked up mind
You wouldn't understand it
Because you're not that kind
