Take what you can from me
Rob me of my sanity
Your laws of flesh i've broken
You stifle me, i choke your incision to my brain, i cut and bleed
You wanna except the truth about the great, I Am
First you better except who I Am in the great, I Am
Remember your spiritual life is free and equals freedom
No laws can effectively describe some spiritual regulation
Spiritual regulation (3x)
Legalism (15x)
Getting to the core of this deception
In a rat race full of rejection, you say these laws will give you life
I think life can be found only in Jesus Christ
These laws cause bondage
Slaves to your own sins
Christ is justification
Hold up your end
Crucify your flesh daily, as much as you can
And quanatize, spiritual walk
But you can take up your cross and follow, follow today
