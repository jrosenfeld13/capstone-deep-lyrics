[Verse 1]
Down where this ugly man seeks his sustenance
Down in the blue, midnight flare
A glass hand cuts through the water
Scything into his twisted roots
Then from his eyes
Spring fireflies
Breathing life into a roaring disguise

[Pre-Chorus]
Needles and sins, sins and needles
He's gasping for air
In the wishing well

[Chorus]
Dust to rust, ashes on gashes
Hand around the killing jar
Hand around the killing jar

[Verse 2]
A soft hoodwink of shadows
The size of make-believe
Punching through his spike of rage
A glass hand cuts through the water
Snuffing out the magic fury
Then from inside
Bolt lightning cries
Swiftly crushed
The final, muffled sighs

[Pre-Chorus]
Needles and sins, sins and needles
He's gasping for air
In the wishing well

[Chorus]
Dust to rust, ashes on gashes
Hand around the killing jar
Hand around the killing jar
