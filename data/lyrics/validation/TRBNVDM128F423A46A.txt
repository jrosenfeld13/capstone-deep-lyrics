The ways of your way
I'm lost in disbelief
How can you breathe freely
And look at what you see

The space that you tread
What you do perceive
Your objects of desire
I know they're not for me

Not forgetting all the crimes
Neither nor the lesson
All I can now cry
Your world's not mine
Your world's not mine

I see what I touch
Burn in my own dreams
No feeling for your life
Your world can't be seen
