[Verse 1]
I didn't mean to break your window, I was trying to wake you up
When I saw you out last night, it hit me like a truck
I tried to call all day at work, didn't they give you my fax
And I want my goodbye back

[Chorus]
I had a momentary, temporary, lack of self control
I said this and I said that, I was really on a roll
It's been downhill ever since my good sense jumped the track
And I want my goodbye back

[Verse 2]
My doctor says, "I'm better now" but I still feel the pain
I showed him your picture, he said, "Man, you were insane"
He asked me for your number and now his left eye is black
And I want my goodbye back

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I might have been insensitive but I have learned a lot
I know what I can live without and I know what I ain't got

[Chorus]
