I'm not the kind that walks away
But in my mind I knew this day was done too soon
The spark inside, the lights gone dark
Shimmered and I realise my heart is cold as the moon

It's not the first, it's not the last time
That my heart got broken
My love got turned around
Gotta lift myself to higher ground

After the race is run
I'll be gone, I'll be gone
When all's been said and done
I'll be gone, I'll be gone

After the race is run
I'll be gone, I'll be gone
When all's been said and done
I'll be gone, I'll be gone

We don't have time to contemplate
Just know that I'm not twisting fate by leaving so soon
The spark inside, the lights gone dark
Shimmered and I realise my heart is cold as the moon

It's not the first, it's not the last time
That my heart got broken
My love got turned around
Gotta lift myself to higher ground

After the race is run
I'll be gone, I'll be gone
When all's been said and done
I'll be gone, I'll be gone

Step by step and day by day
I'm thinking 'bout who will win the race
Don't hold your breath, don't waste your time
I won't be waiting at the finish line

Gotta lift myself to higher ground

After the race is run
I'll be gone, I'll be gone
When all's been said and done
I'll be gone, I'll be gone

After the race is run
I'll be gone, I'll be gone
When all's been said and done
I'll be gone, I'll be gone

After the race is run
