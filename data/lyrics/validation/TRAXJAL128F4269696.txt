[Chorus]
If you've got the key, then I've got the door
Let's do what we did, when we did it before
If you've got the time, I've got the wait
Let's do what we did, when we did it all day
You get the glass, I've got the wine
We'll do what we did, when we did it all the time
If you've got the dough, then I've got the heat
We can use my oven, 'till it's warm and sweet
So sweet

[Verse]
I know I'm bold
Coming on like this
But the good things in life, are too good to be missed
Now time is money, and money is sweet
If you're busy baby, we can do it on our feet
We can do it on the floor
We can do it on the stair
We can do it on the couch
We can do it in the air
Oh...

[Chorus]
If you've got the key, then I've got the door
Let's do what we did, when we did it before
If you've got the time, I've got the wait
Let's do what we did, when we did it all day
You get the glass, I've got the wine
We'll do what we did, when we did it all the time
If you've got the dough, then I've got the heat
We can use my oven, 'till it's warm and sweet
So sweet

[Outro]
Oh, the way we did it that day
Oh, the way we did it
We can do it like we did it, the way we did it that day
That sweet, sweet day...
