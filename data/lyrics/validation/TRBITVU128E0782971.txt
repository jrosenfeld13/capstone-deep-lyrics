It was winter on the Mersey
Snow was falling on New York
The boats were coming in from Ireland
A nation drinking round the docks
What do you do when the rain is falling
What do you do when the rain is falling down

Young men were heading back to Europe
Rocking the Reeperbahn at night
We watched the airwaves over Eval
Angels were dancing in the light
What do you do when the sun is sinking
What do you do when the sun is sinking low

The chains, slaves, praise and gospel
Burn like the sun in tortured mouths
A hurricane blew out of Memphis
Revolution in the south
What do you do when the sun is beating
What do you do when the sun is beating down

Spirits drink the milk of nations
Singing freedom and release
Cries of mercy rise like rockets
Trough the paths of the redeemed
What do you do when the guns are turning
What do you do when the guns are turning round

What do you do
Sing a song of the earth
Song the earth
Song the earth

A singer in my bloodstream
Stayed mainline all my life
His voice filled my Atlantic
A Celtic fire, a soul of white
What do you do when your homes are burning
What do you do when your homes are burning down

He wore the beauty of his people
Came to tell it to the world
Human tears, human oceans
The greatest song I've ever heard
What do you do when your hope is raging
What do you do when your hope is raging strong

It was winter on the Mersey
Through the museum on the docks
Through my years, through my failures
To where the white piano stood
What do you do when the rain is falling
What do you do when the rain is falling down

Saw all the singers of the Gaidhealtachd
And all the world could understand
I heard, maybe I'm a dreamer
I was not the only one
What do you do when the song you're singing
What do you do when the song you're singing's gone

What do you do when the song you're singing
What do you do when the song you're singing's gone

Song the earth
Sing a song of the earth
Song the earth

Song the earth
Sing a song of the earth
Song the earth
