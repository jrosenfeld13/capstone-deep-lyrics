There would have been fireworks we said
There would have been fireworks
You only give what you've got
You've only got what you've not yet lost
And I can't sleep again tonight
We had our chance but we ran away
We ran away every time
Every time
Ran away
Every time
Ran away
Every time
So, get me out of here
Where everything is meant to be
And if you're fingers fail
Then you're giving up
They're loving every move you make
And I still don't
But we play it cool
And don't hold on too long
Play it cool
Too long
Play it cool
Too long
Play it cool
Too long
So, get me out of here
Where everything is meant to be
And if your fingers fail
Then you're giving up
And if we go down
We'll go down together
Oh they'll watch us in
Flight
They'll watch us in
Flight
They'll watch us in
Flight
Oh you've gone too far
And oh you've gone too far
There would have been fireworks she said
There would have been fireworks
X14
And if we go down, we'll go down together
