Though I see you every day, I wonder if you know my name
'Cause you're not much good for talking, but you talk such a good game
And would it come around again like circles spin?
And I wonder what I'm gonna do
And I'll go on but not for long
'Cause I'm getting to the end of you
You called me up to say what for
I think that I forgot
Getting up at one, staring at the sun, til you suss out every spot
You're gonna take it one more time, it's just like dying
I wonder when I'm gonna quit
And I'll go on but not for long cause I'm getting to the end of it
I'm getting to the end, but then it starts again
It's the same thing every day
You're gonna take it to the start with a broken heart
And I don't want to see you again this way
