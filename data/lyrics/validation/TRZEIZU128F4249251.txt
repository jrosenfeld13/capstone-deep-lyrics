Days Undercover, All out of sync
Haven't paid the rent, even talkin' in my sleep
My monkey's M.O., is all out of commission
I'm waitin' for a good old fashioned cure for my condition

Cause I'm all out of time
And I'm all out of money
Hangin' Down Incognito
Waitin' for the sun to shine

Counts to the left
Jokers to the right
Countin' on the rest of us
To come and take a bite

But I'll wait it out
Call it superstition
I'll be fine for now
Just reminiscing

Cause I'm all out of time
And I'm all out of money
Hangin' Down Incognito
Waitin' for the sun to shine

I just had to let it go
Took all the pennies I had
Threw 'em in the wishing well
And I wish you well

Days Undercover, All out of sync
Haven't paid the rent, even talkin' in my sleep
My monkey's M.O., is all out of commission
I'm waitin' for a good old fashioned cure for my condition

Cause I'm all out of time
And I'm all out of money
Hangin' Down Incognito
Waitin' for the sun to shine

Cause I'm all out of time
And I'm all out of money
Hangin' Down Incognito
Waitin' for the sun to shine

Me and my amigos, Down Incognito
