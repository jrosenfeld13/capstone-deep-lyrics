Where to land?
Damn the road, fix the rain
My mind is on everything
Shutting down
Coming up

I can't stand on the earth
Lay me down
Curse my luck
My mind is on everything
Shutting down

I'm pure tired
Full of blood
My mind is on everything
Shutting down
I can't stand on the earth
Lay me down
Curse my luck
I'm pure tired
One lick less
I'm pure tired
One lick less
I'm pure tired
One lick less
I'm pure tired
One lick less
