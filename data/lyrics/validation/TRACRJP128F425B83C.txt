Harvest growth to captivate
Liberate your mind
Seek the truth, co-operate
Removal of the grind

Supposition, theorise
Germinate and seed
Draw into aseity
Roaring "We, the freed"

Corpulent authority
Extirpate with law
Given enough rope to hang them
Rutting with their whores

Intersocial involition
Hypocrisy to breed
Power-hungry carry on
Muting we... The... Freed

The Hallucination Contradicts
This Hidden Conspiracy
Trance-like Heresy Commence.....
..... Start drawing towards the free

Exercise the will - We, the freed
Exercise the will - We, the freed
Exercise the will - We, the freed
Exercise the will............

If their heresy is such an illegal offence
Then we'll all be getting stoned in the biblical sense
The process of weeding out has begun
Yet drawing it in is much more fun
Stoned-head at six feet deep
If a joint is not a joint, it's a piece of meat
Or a hinge that could open your mind to see
What we desire, released, be free

We, the freed - Duplicity in mortal world
Decadence to rage - Jocular our moral standarts
Return to stone age - Manifest my definition?
Interpretation keyed? - Sequential our persecution
Sanction we, the freed
