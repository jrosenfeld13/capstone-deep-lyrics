I just can't get over you
Tell me why, is there nothing that I can do

Loving you has changed my life
And given me joy
A world I never knew
And now I'm living aside
But all the hopes and promises you made
Has ended like a rainbow fades away
And though the love I feel for you lives on
Its so hard to be strong

Chorus:
I, I just can't get over you
No matter how hard I try
Tell me why
Is there nothing that I can do
To help me to get over you

Only you can take my world
And turn it around
Somehow the thought of you
Still makes me happy inside
But all the hopes & promises you made
Has ended like a rainbow fades away
And though the love I feel for you lives on
Its so hard to be strong

Chorus (4x)
