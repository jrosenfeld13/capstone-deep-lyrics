No matter what I say or do
You're never satisfied
I've tried to please you too many times
So now I'm leaving you now goodbye

Riding on that midnight train
Lord my head's a hanging low
These awful blues will follow me
Wherever I may go

Why on earth was I ever born
I'll never understand
To fall in love with a girl like you
Who's in love with another man

Riding on that midnight train
Lord my head's a hanging low
These awful blues will follow me
Wherever I may go

You broke a heart that trusted you
Why wasn't it made of stone
You've left my world as black as night
And yet I must travel on

Riding on that midnight train
Lord my head's a hanging low
These awful blues will follow me
Wherever I may go
