[Verse 1]
Shame on you
Seducing everyone
Faded jewel
You diamond in the rough
You don't have to tell me
I know where you've been
Shining once again

Will you do
The thing you've always done
Tell me true
I think you know the one
One that makes me blurry
Colors start to run
Every time I wonder
I go under

[Chorus]
The deeper the blues
The more I see black
Sweeter the bruise the feeling starts coming back
All the deepest blues are black

[Verse 2]
How my mind is spinning
And my head is going numb
Right from the beginning
Our ending had begun
I can be your trouble
Shiver into you
Shaking like the thunder
Sinking under

[Chorus]
The deeper the blues
The more I see black
Sweeter the bruise the feeling starts coming back
All the deepest blues are black

[Bridge]
When it comes closing in
Reject
Cause I gotta move
And the simple things get in the openings
Connect
Become something new
To remove

[Chorus] x2
The deeper the blues
The more I see black
Sweeter the bruise the feeling starts coming back
All the deepest blues are black
