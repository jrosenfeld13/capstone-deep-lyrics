Hey!
What ya wanna do about this thing?
Be careful with that game you're tryin to bring
I'm trying so hard just to ignore
But all of my thoughts just seem to form around you
And the subtleties you start to sling
Like, "I don't care about the songs you sing"
And now I can't take this any more
But I've never seen your type before

Heartbreaker, it just feels like somethings going on
Heartbreaker, it just feels like somethings going on

Baby!
I'm not like the other guys you see
You need to handle me so gently
I'm putting my heart out on the line
To see if the same thing's on your mind

Heartbreaker, it just feels like somethings going on
Heartbreaker, it just feels like somethings going on
(Heartbreaker)
Heartbreaker, it just feels like somethings going on
Heartbreaker, it just feels like somethings going on

You broke my heart, you broke my mind
GIrl, you done broke me down inside
You broke my name, you broke my will
I can't believe I love you still
Can't go back
Can't move on
Any other girl I'd be long gone
Don't know what to do
Can't get over you...
Heartbreaker!
