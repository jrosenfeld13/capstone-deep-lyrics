That look in your eyes
Tells me you can't disguise
Why won't you try to set your tone
Your stuck nowhere
I like to see that you dont care
Doesnt seem like death means much to you
Im sick of listening to you whining

Might be a dream
The set look at the sunset
It could be everything you wanted it to be
Might be a dream
The set look at the sunset
It could be everything you wanted it to be
Might be a dream

I see you everyday wasting your time away
Ill drag you high ill drag you lows
Dont know why you can't see you could have everything
Throw nothing it all ends up to you
Youve always got to keep on trying

Might be a dream
The set look at the sunset
It could be everything you wanted it to be
Might be a dream
The set look at the sunset
It could be everything you wanted it to be
Might be a dream

You know your look at me
All you want it to be
Keep getting closer day by day
Those messages in your head they won't go away
And you dont try your lonely fame

Might be a dream
The set look at the sunset
It could be everything you wanted it to be
Might be a dream
The set look at the sunset
It could be everything you wanted it to be
Might be a dream
Might be a dream
Might be a dream
Might be a dreaaaaaaaaaaam
