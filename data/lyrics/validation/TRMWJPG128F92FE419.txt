I no longer love your mouth
I no longer love your eyes

I no longer love your eyes
I no longer love the color of your sweaters
I no longer love it

I no longer love the color of your sweaters
I no longer love the way you hold your pens
And pencils
I no longer love it

Your mouth. Your eyes
The way you hold your pens and pencils
I no longer love it. I no longer love it
