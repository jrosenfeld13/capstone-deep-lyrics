You don't blow like the breeze you were born to be
You die down in the trees and try to hide
Will you witness the dark
All you need is a spark
A cathedral of torches to light the night

On your mark here I am
I'm your spark
Runaway wind
Run run away wind

You trade your telescope for a keyhole
Make way for the gray that's in your brown
As dreams make way for plans
See ya watch life from the stands
Come on I'll help you burn 'em to the ground

On your mark here I am
I'm your spark
Runaway wind

He sees ya like a river
Deep and silent
And he runs to you like
A shallow noisy stream
I see what you've become and try to hide it
You need someone who sees
What you were born to be

Here I am

You don't. blow like the breeze
You were born to be
You don't know what to do with your life
As day returns to dark
Flame returns to spark
Come on I feel I'm blowing out tonight

I'm your spark here I am
I'm your spark here I am
I'm your spark here I am
On your mark run away wind
Watch you run
Watch you run
Watch you run
