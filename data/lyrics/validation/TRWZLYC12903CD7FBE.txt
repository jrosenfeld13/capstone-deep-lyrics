(Three in the fuckin mornin... yeah)

Brave like an indian the Mohican of his last
No money weed or ass baby no backstage pass
We rondezvous, I'm flippin on my kenneth cole shoes
And some bitches talk too much I'm letten them bitches spread the news
Like channel 4
Why gangsta niggas love to snort blow?
Chewy is the god down here in the 'Moe pina colada
The set done got hotter than a sauna
We break 'em like a puzzle then we gather like pirhanna
I keep my money by my nuts
Dip through the cuts we don't front we at the front and we roll big blunts
Layin pagans down
Just like a bearskin rug
Goin deep into the depths just like a Russian navy sub
On course, rollin with the front lights off... I can smell the gunpowder
Bullets dipped in the sauce
Some jokers floss
Yeah, but [? ] is the impression they've adapted
My steel declare'll spark the flare
The [? ] or the plastic
Burning rubber
Doin doughnuts that the pigs just couldn't eat
They brought the coffee and the cream but all they saw was tire streaks
I'm on the streets
I can feel my mother worry in her sleep
It's 3 a.m
I'm with Sun Kim and we smokin to the beat
It's Nickatina...
Meow Meow Meow Meow
Meow Meow Meow Meow...
I be a suitor, a freeway drivin bay bridge commutor
My roll of decks in full effects has turned into a computer
We got weed, but cheese out all the snitches
We want the money and the women
You can keep them scandelous bitches... for ya self
I make ya put ya mic up on tha shelf, broke ass hoes they want new cothes
Be axin niggas for help, but I can't hear em' but I can hear a needle
Drop on top a pillow
When a clucker fiend here go a sceme, a piece of yellow skittle, a tin shot
Follow me as I parade around the block, blowin wind like a tornado
Dirchargin' like a Glock, steel plated, I usually get an X when I'm rated
Them sucka MC's Them wannabees, they talk when only faded, like the blunt. that once was plump then burned to ashes
I garuntee my third degree is just like twenty lashes, on ya face
I'll one hundred percent represent my race. while them bastards blast that rock n' roll, my niggas crank the bass for tha chamillion
The F finger answer all ya questions, my pitbull alliance no doubt
My only cure is protection stutter steppin
My killer cross ain't false it's been perfected
Baby ya got nice clothes, but I've come to see ya nekked
Like it's ya birthday, like a fiend would say
When they broke and they on the rock
Your conbination has been invaded, your safe has been unlocked
It's Nickatina
[laughter]
Baby just pull ya panties down, all that other shit is um... irrelivant
Meow Meow Meow Meow
[laughter]
Let me hear that
[x3] Meow Meow Meow Meow Meow Meow
[x3] Three Oh clock in the morning...
