[Verse 1]
Oslo in the summertime
Nobody can fall asleep
Staring out the window from my bed
At 4 A.M., the sun is up
Look, the sky is peppered with sea birds
And with crows all cackling

[Verse 2]
Up in treten Heimdalsgate, me and Nina making fun
Of footballers in Rudolf Nilsen Plass
I practice my Norwegian on poor befuddled waitresses
Who shake their heads completely at a loss
Oslo in the summertime
The streets are strangely quiet
Cause everyone's away on holiday

[Verse 3]
Oslo in the summertime
Pakistani children play
Locked inside of the courtyard all day
Pretty people everywhere
Sun-lamp tans and flaxen hair
Just tell the American not to stare
