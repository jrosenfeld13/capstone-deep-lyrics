Are we nothing more than this?
A list of pinnacles achieved
And I forgot the way to my conscience
I will save this, take you home
A chance to leave the past behind
And move toward the future bright

This time it's done a better way
Breathe again this time

Forget the emotional countdown
And try to put together
Just a little bit piece by piece

Are we nothing more than this?
