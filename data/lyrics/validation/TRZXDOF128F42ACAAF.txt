I am in circles, you're a straight line
You are the fix i'd hope to find
And people can be so
All that i want now is not to change
You are the hope you will stay the same
And people can let go

I like to keep your pictures candle lit
I need you to be someone i worship
Might be to hard to handle if you were mine
And that is why i built this shrine

I keep my distance, everything's clear
And there are no words i need to hear
It's better for both of us
And all that i want now is not stray
I need the strength you radiate
It's something i can trust

I like to keep your pictures candle lit
I need you to be someone i worship
Might be to hard to handle if you were mine
And that is why i built this shrine

It's everything i never told you
And i don't ever need to own you
I don't ever want to hold you
Until you die
So don't don't don't

I like to keep your pictures candle lit
I think you could be someone i worship
Might be to hard to handle if you were mine
And that is why i built this shrine

I like to keep your pictures candle lit
I think you could be someone i worship
Might be to hard to handle if you were mine
And that is why i built this shrine
