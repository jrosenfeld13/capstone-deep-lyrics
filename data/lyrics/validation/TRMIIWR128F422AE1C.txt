I'm a drunken hearted man, my life seems so misery
I'm a drunken hearted man, my life seems so misery
And if I could change my way of livin', it would mean so much to me

I been dogged and I been driven, ever since I left my mother's home
I been dogged and I been driven, ever since I left my mother's home
And I can't see the reason why that, I can't leave these no-good women's alone

My father died and left me, my poor mother done the best that she could
My father died and left me, my poor mother done the best that she could
Every man likes that game you call love, but it don't mean no man no good

Now, I'm the drunken hearted man and sin was the cause of it all
(Oh, play 'em now)
I'm a drunken hearted man, and sin was the cause of it all
And the day that you get weak for no-good women, that's the day that you bound to fall
