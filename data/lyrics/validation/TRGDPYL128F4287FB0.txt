Maybe on the street
Maybe on the beach
Maybe I'll see you at the mall
Jesus was right
Yeah, I don't want to fight at all, at all

I want to be alone
I want to be inside my headphones
I skate for transportation
Play guitar for elevation
Into a state of my own

I like distortion when I bar chord
A lonely parking lot when I ride on my board

Maybe on the beach
Maybe on the street
Maybe I'll see you in the hall
I want to be alone

Jesus was right
Yeah, I don't want to fight at all

I want to be alone
I want to be inside my headphones
I skate for transportation
Play guitar for elevation
Into a state of my own

I like distortion when I bar chord
A lonely parking lot when I ride on my board
I like distortion when I bar chord
A lonely parking lot when I ride on my board

I like distortion when I bar chord
A lonely parking lot when I ride on my board
I like distortion when I bar chord
A lonely parking lot when I ride on my board
