I'm on the rocky road
Heading down off the mountain slope
And as my steps echo echo
Louder than before
Another day is done
Say goodbye to the setting sun
See what I found
Turn back to the ground
Just like before

And Hey hey hey hey hey hey
Hey beautiful day, hey beautiful day
Hey hey hey hey
Hey beautiful day, hey beautiful day
When the night feels my song
I'll be home, I'll be home

Into the undergrowth
Twist and turn on a lonely road
In the twilight
The day turns to night
And I'm alone

And when the light has let
I'm not sure of my every step
Follow the wind that pushes me west
Back to my bed

And Hey hey hey hey hey hey
Hey beautiful day, hey beautiful day
Hey hey hey hey
Hey beautiful day, hey beautiful day

When the night feels my song
I'll be home, I'll be home
When the night feels my song
I'll be home, I'll be home
When the night feels my song
I'll be home, I'll be home
