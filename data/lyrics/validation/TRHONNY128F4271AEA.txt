I lock the door and lock my head
And dream of butterflies instead
The beauty of their colored wings
The trees, the grass and pretty things
Imagination fills the void of my existence

Daddy says "I love you girl, it's not your fault
Your mom and me don't get along"
I know he's lying, I know there's no such thing as
Inexplicable I hear, forget, this world in bed
And suddenly the sun comes up
That's when my pets all come alive
They cheer me up and tell me

Everything's alright
Stuffed animals are always right

My favorite song, my favorite show
I wonder if they even know
Or if they care or if they even notice
I am standing there
I want my pets to come alive
And cheer me up and tell me

Everything's alright
Stuffed animals are always right
Everything's alright
Stuffed animals are always right
Alright...

My eyes all red, the baby's wet
And someone has to get that phone
I want my pets to come alive and
Cheer me up and tell me

Alright...

I lock the door and lock my head
And dream of butterflies instead
