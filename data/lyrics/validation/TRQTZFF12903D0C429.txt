Let me be real let me be real
So I can feel, I can feel

What the world won't reveal to me

Just the thoughts in my head, got me thinkin'
Askin' myself oh, what am I living
Thoughts can be such a heavy burden
It's time to tear down these curtains

Let the truth be heard
Give it to me word for word
That's all I really ask for

I can handle it for better or worse
Now tell me what do you live for

Ooh

I want the truth, yeah
So I can feel, yeah

Let me be real let me be real
I want nothing but the truth, yeah
So I can feel I can feel
What the world won't reveal to me

Let me be real let me be real
I want nothing but the truth, yeah
So I can feel I can feel
What the world won't reveal to me
