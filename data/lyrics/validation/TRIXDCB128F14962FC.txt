[Verse 1]
Ah, listen everybody, especially you, girl
Is it right to be left alone
While the one you love is never home?
I love too hard, my friends sometimes say
I believe, I believe that a woman should be loved that way
But it hurts me so inside to see you treat me so unkind
Somebody somewhere tell her it's unfair

[Chorus]
Can I get a witness? (somebody, somebody)
Can I get a witness, yeah (come be my witness)
Somebody (somebody, somebody)
I want a witness (come be my witness)

[Verse 2]
Is it right to be treated so bad
When you give it everything you had?
Even tossed in my sleep
'Cause I haven't seen my baby all week
And you chicks do agree
That is ain't the way love's supposed to be, let me hear you
Let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Up early in the morning with her on my mind
Just to find out all night that I've been cryin'
But I believe, I believe a woman's a man's best friend
So I'm gonna stick by her 'til the very end
She's caused so much misery
I forget how love's supposed to be
Somebody somewhere, tell her it's unfair

[Chorus]
Can I get a witness? Oh, I want a witness
(somebody, somebody)
Somebody (come be my witness)
All right (somebody, somebody)
I really, really need a witness (come be my witness)

[Verse 3]
Everybody knows, especially you girls
A love can be sad, half a love is twice as bad
Now you chicks, you do agree
That this ain't the way love's supposed to be
Let me hear you, let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah
I want a witness (somebody, somebody)
Need right now (come be my witness)
Gotta get it somehow (somebody, somebody)
Oh yeah (come be my witness)
I need a witness, yeah (somebody, somebody)
Give it to me, yeah (come be my witness)
I need a witness now (somebody, somebody)
