He's an innovator
Don't care what you give up
He's one of the ones
You hate that you love but you can't get enough
So Get your head out your ass now
Quit wasting my time
We won't live forever
So make up your mind

Soulcrusher, no other
Soulcrusher don't give a fuck about you

He's the old unforgiver
The cold shoulder giver
He's one of the ones
You hate that you love but you can't get enough
So Get your head out your ass now
Quit wasting my time
We won't live forever
So make up your mind

Soulcrusher, no other
Soulcrusher don't give a fuck about you

Soulcrusher, no other
Soulcrusher don't give a fuck about you

First we live and then we die
Cannot get another try
Every day we lose tonight
Nothing matters if it's right
Can I get another life
Go through and make it right
If I had another one
I don't think I'd give a fuck

So Get your head out your ass now
Quit wasting my time
We won't live forever
So make up your mind

Soulcrusher, no other
Soulcrusher don't give a fuck about you

Soulcrusher, no other
Soulcrusher don't give a fuck
