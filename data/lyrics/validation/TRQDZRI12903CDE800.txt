To walk on the water, to ride on the waves
Requires believers praised by the grace
In social distortion they stood there alone
A spring revolution pushed from the throne
Behind the curtain it's cold
In the bloodless soul
By the walls of control
Live a lie forever
Behind the curtain it's cold
In the bloodless soul
By the walls of control
Live a lie forever
Behind the curtain it's cold
Unholy arrival in iron and steel
The silent beholders down on their knees
Like puppets of Satan, controlling the game
Now this can't be Heaven, this must be Hell
Behind the curtain it's cold
In the bloodless soul
By the walls of control
Live a lie forever
Behind the curtain it's cold
In the bloodless soul
By the walls of control
Live a lie forever
Inside this book I found it
Inside this strange old diary
Old man, I've read your story
The testament of evil
