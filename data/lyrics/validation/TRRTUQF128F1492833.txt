Im hostile, Im hostile, Im hostile, Im hostile
Im hostile, Im hostile, Im hostile

Have you heard about the take-off freak
Just come into town?
Only thing that gets him off is burning people down
Gonna bring that take-off artist down

Dont believe in property, thinks we ought to share
Everywhere he goes he seems to vanish into air
Gonna bring that take-off artist down

Every night hes goin round
Plays his game of lost and found
When I git that take-off clown
Gonna bring that take-off artist down

Gonna do him dirty, I aint gonna stop
Gonna use his brain for my private johnny mop
Aw, gonna bring that take-off artist down

If I get too lazy to pound him into mush
Ill put Drano in his duji, wait for him to rush
Gonna bring him down

Every night hes goin round, round
Playing his game of lost and found
When I git that flower child
Gonna bring that take-off artist down

Gonna make him crawl on his belly like a slug
Pound him into dust, sweep him under the rug
Im gonna bring that take-off artist down

When theres nothing left of him a mortal man can save
Piss on his tombstone, desecrate his grave
Gonna bring that take-off artist down. (Steve: Shut up! I said shut up, man!)

Every night hes goin round, round
Playing his game of lost and found
When I git that take-off clown
I'm gonna bring that take-off artist down
(Steve: Ha ha, you cant talk that way to me!
Im gonna cut your neck off. Shut up man! etc.)

Follow his immortal soul down to the depths of Hell
Watch the devil roast him, cheer each time he yells
Gonna bring that take-off artist down

Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill-kill-kill-kill kill
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill
Gonna bring that take-off artist down
