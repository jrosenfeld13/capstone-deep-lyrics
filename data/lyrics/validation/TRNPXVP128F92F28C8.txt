Go to football, throw a brick
Get no mercy, months in nick
Riot in the ghetto, red alert
Guilty free, innocent hurt

We've been warned of rivers of blood
See the trickle before the flood
Pretend nothing happened, make no fuss
One law for them, one for us

Chorus
One law for them
One law for them
One law for them
And another law for us

One law for them
One law for them
One law for them
And another law for us

No fun, no home, no job, no use
What else is used as an excuse
Families fighting, familes looting
Next there's death, then there's shooting

Chorus

Riots in London, blame Old Bill
We've been lucky no ones killed
Violence on the streets, more to follow
Freedom for those freedom fighters

Chorus
