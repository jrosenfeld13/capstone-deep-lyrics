She's breaking up, she's falling down
She's holding her fists up now
Her eyes meet my face but we don't look the Same
She walks away, on bloody knees
Her swollen face hides her tears
My mind strains for words but my tongue won't obey

You're just a shadow now of the girl I used to know
Your broken song is maimed and slow
You strain your face to bear that smile
Your teeth clenched tightly all the while
And though you search so thoroughly
For some place to put the blame
It only rests on angry shoulders
And you don't look the same
Your pretty face now contorted
Haggard with shame
I try to recognize your anger
I try to recognize your hatred
I try to find some purpose for your pride

So cease your screaming now because your
Voice is worn and hoarse
Your song insinuates divorce
Your poison love I won't pursue
Your not the lover I once knew
And though you speak so firmly of maxims so bold
Your lips mouth words of love
But still your voice is callused and cold
I try to understand what made this mess unfold
I'm sure you couldn't be blamed
Your features haven't changed
And yet I can't Imagine why you don't look the same

And your song of broken trust is grating on my ears
I'm tired of standing passive while you're preying on my fears
I'm tired of trying to fight, I'm tired of taking sides
You say that you're not angry but I see it in your eyes
I'm tired of hearing rumors, I'm tired of hiding shame
I'm tired of pointing fingers and never taking blame
I'm tired of trying to talk I've nothing left to say
I'm tired of going on so I'm going away
