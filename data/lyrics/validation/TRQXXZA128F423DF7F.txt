[Verse 1]
Stuff your sentences into your boring diary
Stuff your senses into the back of your jeans
Take the controls
Grab hold
Get fuckin' ready

Bring your appetite and break sobriety
Stuff your senses into the back of your jeans
Take the controls
Grab hold
Get fuckin' ready

[Hook]
Brace and break the quiet

[Verse 2]
Stuff your sentences into your boring diary
Stuff your senses into the back of your jeans
Take the controls
Grab hold
Get fuckin' ready

Bring your appetite and break sobriety
Stuff your senses into the back of your jeans
Take the controls
Grab hold
Get fuckin' ready

[Hook]
Brace and break the quiet

[Bridge]
You and I have minutes between
We lie but we're still listening
It's too soon, I know
But I can walk slow
It's a couple blocks away

[Verse 3]
Stuff your sentences into your boring diary
Stuff your senses into the back of your jeans
Take the controls
Grab hold
Get fuckin' ready

[Hook]
Brace and break the quiet

[Outro]
We don't have to try
We can turn bad luck into a bad joke
We don't have to sing
We can turn a bad string into a long dream
We don't have to bleed
We can just repeat when we are alone
