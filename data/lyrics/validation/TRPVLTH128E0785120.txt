Love: My angel on silver lines;
So young and so terrified...
Somehow we realized, only the strong survive

Our Doctors say
"You know the drill. This broke heart won't ever heal
She needs drugs, and he needs 'em just as bad."

He said:" Be my love, and race the dream together
Then I'll know they can't tear us apart!"
{Can't tear us apart! Can't tear us apart!}

Careful, for when it was all the rage
We were glass managerie
"Some pills and you'll be fine."
Only the strong survive

But my love, we'll race the dream together
Then I know they can't tear us apart

All my love
The King and Queen together
Now I know they can't tear us apart

They can't tear us apart!
They can't tear us apart!
They can't tear us apart!

They can't tear us apart!
They can't tear us apart!
They can't tear us apart!
