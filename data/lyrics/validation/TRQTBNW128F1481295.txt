It's over, it's over
Twelve days later and I can't start over
I left her, she hates me
We've been friends since 1990
Don't tell me it's over

I need you more than the sun
She's telling me that we're done
I can't believe that it's over
I need you more than the sun
She's telling me that we're done
I can't believe that it's over
I should've known all along

It's over, it's over
Three months later but I can't console her
I'm run down, I'm clinging (?)
Left a message, but her phone's not ringing

It's over, so over
The sun is shining but my heart is sober
Pretending I'm alright
Sleep all day gonna stay up all night
Don't tell me it's over

I need you more than the sun
She's telling me that we're done
I can't believe that it's over
I need you more than the sun
She's telling me that we're done
I can't believe that it's over
I should've known all along
I should've known all along

I need you more than the sun
I need you more than the sun

I need you more than the sun
I need you more than the sun
You're telling me that we're done
I can't believe that it's over
You're telling me that we're done
It's over, it's over, it's over
It's over, it's over, we're done

I need you more than I thought
This past week I learned a lot
And now you tell me it's over
