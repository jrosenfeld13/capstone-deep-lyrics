I used to think that I was strong
I realize now I was wrong
'Cause every time I see your face
My mind becomes an empty space
And with you lying next to me
Feels like I can hardly breathe

I close my eyes
The moment I surrender to you
Let love be blind
Innocent and tenderly true
So lead me through tonight
But please turn out the light
'Cause I'm lost every time I look at you

And in the morning when you go
Wake me gently so I will know
That loving you was not a dream
And whisper what it means to be
Then every moment we're apart
Will be a lifetime to my heart

I close my eyes
The moment I surrender to you
Let love be blind
Innocent and tenderly true
So lead me through tonight
But please, please turn out the light
'Cause I'm lost every time I look at you
I'm lost, every time I look at you

I close my eyes
The moment I surrender to you
Let love be blind
Innocent and tenderly true

I close my eyes
The moment I surrender to you
Let love be blind
Innocent and tenderly true

I close my eyes
