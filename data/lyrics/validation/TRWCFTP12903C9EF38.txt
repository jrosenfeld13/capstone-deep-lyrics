With furious vengeance we will spawn
Possessed or driven, survive till dawn
Malicious anger and king for a day
Extract from the holy land, this nation of decay

Summit of sacrifice, incompetent truth
As in an age of murder, thy kingdom revealed

Summit of sacrifice, incompetent truth
As in an age of murder, thy kingdom revealed

Blessed are those who struggle, trapped in afterlife
Life has been kindly taken, immediately counter strike
With a war between the races, I become the sacrifice
Never to replenish is just a way to die

With furious vengeance, they have spawn
No peaceful tomorrow, you're dead by dawn
Human failure, a dead voice from the grave
Dying for the motherland, the past is here to stay

With furious vengeance we will spawn
Possessed or driven, survive till dawn
Malicious anger and king for a day
Extract from the holy land, this nation of decay

Summit of sacrifice, incompetent truth
As in an age of murder, thy kingdom revealed
Summit of sacrifice, incompetent truth
As in an age of murder, thy kingdom revealed

Shinning trough horror, dominance over the land, in vengeance we are sworn
No peaceful tomorrow, a lasting order, in vengeance we are sworn
For the pride of your nation, the end begins, in vengeance we are sworn

In vengeance we are sworn... in vengeance we are sworn... in vengeance we are sworn...
