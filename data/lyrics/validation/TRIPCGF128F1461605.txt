I'll have a blue
Christmas without you
And I'll be so blue
Just thinking about you
Decorations of red
On a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing dear
If you're not here with me

Then when the Blue
Snowflakes start fallin'
That's when those blue
Memories are calling
You'll be doing all right
With your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas

Decorations of red
On a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing dear
If you're not here with me

Then when the Blue
Snowflakes start fallin'
That's when those blue
Memories are calling
You'll be doing all right
With your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas

But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas...
