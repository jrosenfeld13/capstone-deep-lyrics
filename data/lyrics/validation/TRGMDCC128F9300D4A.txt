We'll meet at three by the sea
Let it flow
Flow
We'll nervously shoot the breeze
Let it flow
We both got nowhere to be
Let it flow
Flow
You make my heart skip a beat
Let it flow

It's like lightning when she smiles
She tastes just like pumpkin pie
Storm clouds have filled the sky
I've arrived when she smiles
I'm on fire

On the outskirts of town
Let it flow
Flow
Lonely lane I sat down
Let it flow
And it was there I found a book bound with leather
Let it flow
In it was the electric love letter
Let it flow

It's like thunder when she cries
I'd die to be by her side
Tonight when we take a ride
We've arrived when she smiles
I'm on fire

We'll meet at three by the sea
Let it flow
We'll nervously shoot the breeze
Let it flow
We both got nowhere to be, man
Let it flow
You make my heart skip a beat
Let it flow
And it was there I found a book bound with leather
Let it flow
In it was written the electric love letter
Let it flow

It's like lightning when she smiles
She tastes just like pumpkin pie
Tonight when we take a ride
I've arrived when she smiles
She's hungry like an only child
But her lipstick really drives me wild
I've arrived when she smiles
I'm on fire
