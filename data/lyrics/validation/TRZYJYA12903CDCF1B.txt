[Verse 1: Amy Lee]
How can you see into my eyes like open doors?
Leadin' you down into my core
Where I've become so numb, without a soul
My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there, and lead it back home

[Hook: Amy Lee & Paul McCoy]
Wake me up!
Wake me up inside!
I can't wake up
Wake me up inside!
Save me!
Call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up!
Bid my blood to run
I can't wake up
Before I come undone
Save me!
Save me from the nothing I've become

[Verse 2: Amy Lee]
Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real
Bring me to life

[Hook: Amy Lee & Paul McCoy]
Wake me up!
Wake me up inside!
I can't wake up
Wake me up inside!
Save me!
Call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up!
Bid my blood to run
I can't wake up
Before I come undone
Save me!
Save me from the nothing I've become

[Bridge: Amy Lee & Paul McCoy]
Bring me to life
I've been livin' a lie, there's nothing inside
Bring me to life

[Interlude: Amy Lee]
Frozen inside, without your touch
Without your love, darling
Only you are the life
Among the dead

[Verse 3: Paul McCoy & Amy Lee]
All this time, I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years it seems
Got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
Don't let me die here
There must be something more
Bring, me, to, life

[Hook: Amy Lee & Paul McCoy]
Wake me up!
Wake me up inside!
I can't wake up
Wake me up inside!
Save me!
Call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up!
Bid my blood to run
I can't wake up
Before I come undone
Save me!
Save me from the nothing I've become

[Outro: Amy Lee & Paul McCoy]
Bring me to life
I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside
Bring me to life
