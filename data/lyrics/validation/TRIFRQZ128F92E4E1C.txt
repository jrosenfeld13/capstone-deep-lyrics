You see it - I'm in it
One man freak show

Walk by me - Excite me
Moving real slow

Can't accept it, a comical parade
Can't accept it, part of the charade

Just hangin' by a thin thread
On borrowed time, think you've got it
The same habits, sure you won't mind

Can't accept it, a comical parade
Can't accept it, part of the charade

You think I don't know
What you're thinking
With my outreached hand
Yeah you think
You're the better man
The look in your eyes
What do you care
Look at all us freaks
Cluttering your city streets

You don't know me
Nor my history
What brought me here
Walk right past me
And avoid me
Drag I'm even there

Can't accept it, it doesn't have to be
Can't accept it, don't want your sympathy

Was tired
Of the fast pace
The direction
Then I landed
Right on my face
Poor perception

Can't accept it, the comical charade
Can't accept it, badly written play

You think I don't know
What you're thinking
Yeah I might look weak
But I'm right where I wanna be
Got my piece of the wall
Got my corner
I don't want bi nire
I'm right where I wanna be

Can't accept this
Your comical parade
Can't accept this
Oh the sweet charade

I know you are thinking
The same thing
Waking everyday
Know the character you play
I left mine
With complete abandon
Don't regret it none
Left my wife
Daughter and my Son

You think I don't know
What you're thinking
With my outreached hands
Do away
With this retched man
The look in your eyes
What do you care
Look at all us freaks
Cluttering
Your city streets
