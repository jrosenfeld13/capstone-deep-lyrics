[Verse 1]
When I was surrounded by the world
You were the only one who came
And you were the only one astounded
Which kept me grounded
As the other girls trashed my very name

[Chorus 1]
Then I looked over just in time to see her smiling back at me
And saying everything's okay
As long as you're inside my blue veins, your blue veins

[Verse 2]
Yeah, and the feeling that you gave me
No matter what I do or where I go it always will remain
And those who would enslave me
To get to me must get past you and will have no luck
'Cause you'll protect me from all pain
It's true, yeah but

[Chorus 2]
The most beautiful, yeah, the most beautiful thing
'Cause anything else can't compare
Must be the blood that's running through your blue veins

[Break]
Your blue veins

[Verse 3]
And I know you won't deceive me
Like the rest and there's nothing you need to explain
You're always the first one to believe me
When I said to you girl, I think it's gonna rain
But I could be wrong

[Chorus 3 - Outro]
Yeah but all of these things, all these things
They're all truly nice but ain't nothing
Ain't nothing compared to the love
That's running through your little blue veins, your blue veins
