Her lips never leave me alone
Her eyes move, they never roam
Her fingers, they've got control
Melting love in a spoon
Kissing stars on the moon

(Gotta get out, I gotta get outta here)
(Gotta get out, I gotta get out)
(Gotta get out, I gotta get out of here)
My baby really loves me, yeah
(Gotta get out, I gotta get out)
(Gotta get out, I gotta get out of here)
My baby really loves me, yeah
(Gotta get out, I gotta get out)
(Gotta get out, I gotta get outta here)
My baby really loves me, yeah
(Gotta get out, I gotta get out)
Now I got a problem

She saved me from life on my own
And stripped away the unknowns
You gave me something to live for
In my skin and my mind
She makes pretty designs

(Gotta get out, I gotta get outta here)
(Gotta get out, I gotta get out)
(Gotta get out, I gotta get out of here)
My baby really loves me, yeah
(Gotta get out, I gotta get out)
(Gotta get out, I gotta get out of here)
My baby really loves me, yeah
(Gotta get out, I gotta get out)
(Gotta get out, I gotta get outta here)
My baby really loves me, yeah
(Gotta get out, I gotta get out)
Now I got a problem

She shines electric light
Sends signs to me at night

(Gotta get out, I gotta get outta here)
(Gotta get out, I gotta get out)
(Gotta get out, I gotta get out of here)
My baby really loves me, yeah, yeah
(Gotta get out, I gotta get out)
(Gotta get out, I gotta get out of here)
My baby really loves me, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Gotta get out, I gotta get out)

There must be a God in the world
To help protect a lost girl
From guys like me
Search and destroy
I'm just a stupid boy

My baby really loves me, yeah (yeah)
My baby really loves me, yeah (yeah, yeah)
My baby really loves me, yeah
My baby really loves me, yeah (yeah)
