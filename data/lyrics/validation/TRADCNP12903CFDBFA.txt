[Verse 1]
You can cry, cry, cry like the rain
Ocean full of tears won't drown the pain
Take all your whiskey, pour it down the drain
Ain't nothing gonna make you feel better
Ooo she's a little heart wrecker
Ooo she's a little heart wrecker
You can beg, beg, beg like a dog
Chase her round the world but she'd still be gone
She did you right once but left you all wrong
Now you're chewing on a Dear John letter
Ooo she's a little heart wrecker

[Chorus]
She takes a big black ball
And a long strong chain
And she lets it fall
Again and again and again and again and again
She's a little heart wrecker

[Verse 2]
Sing, sing, sing a sad song
Honky tonk jukebox playing along
Until your last buddy and your money is gone
But still you can't not remember
So pray, pray, pray like a saint
Promise your Maker all kinds of things
He don't answer but you know He'd say
Son you better just forget her
Ooo she's a little heart wrecker

[Chorus]

[Outro]
She was sweet, sweet, sweeter than wine
Never knew nothing could be so fine
So you took it all out and laid it on the line
Best you ever had only better
Ooo she's a little heart wrecker
Ooo she's a little heart wrecker
Ooo she's a little heart wrecker
