When I look back to that night, I wonder whether
If I had the chance, would I still do the same again?
But I know held in the arms that I remember
I could not avoid dissolving back into a friend

I have no excuse I was so seduced by his charms
Call me gullible but I'd still believe his smiles

Oh I don't know what I'd do
If I saw him again
If I saw him again
If I saw him again
Wrap my arms around him

I still don't believe he meant to treat me badly
He was so confused, he was just trying to act right
With his eyes, he still declare 'I love you madly'
But with words, he lost his chance to keep this girl in sight

I have no excuse I was so seduced by his charms
Call me gullible but I'd still believe his smiles

Oh I don't know what I'd do
If I saw him again
If I saw him again
If I saw him again
Wrap my arms around him

I once said that if saw him I'd send him away
But now I know that, if I saw him, I'd beg him to stay
Oh he was cruel and I'm no fool but I still wish he'd be
Here with me
Close to me

Oh I don't know what I'd do
If I saw him again
If I saw him again
If I saw him again
Wrap my arms around him

Oh I don't know what I'd do
If I saw him again
If I saw him again
If I saw him again
Wrap my arms around him
