I try not to complain but you know me better than that
Everyday gets lost inside of the last
My negativity gets the best of me
This place has lost its purity
I'm empty and I'm drowning
Can't find my way out and don't know when I fell in
This world is like the weight that's dragging me down
Dragging my soul right down to hell
I'm falling I keep falling
Can't stop until I hit
This world is like the weight that's dragging me down
Dragging my soul right down to hell
I'm falling, I keep falling
I hope I smash in the fucking ground
There's no escaping, there's no running away
It kills a piece of your soul more and more everyday
I need forgiveness even t hough I never forgave
I pray and pray it's not too late to pray
