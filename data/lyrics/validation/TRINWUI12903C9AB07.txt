Now the old days are gone
What you gonna do from here
When you find the strength to carry on
Don't you know you got nothing to fear

Flying in the fast lane
And burning down
Turning down the highway to you
Tell you I'd do anything just to be where you are
Your love is the reason I made it this far

Now the young days are going past
Can you make it to the end of the line
Just hold onto your dreams and hope they last
Don't you know you got nothing but time

Flying in the fast lane
And burning down
Turning down the highway to you
I tell you I'd do anything just to be where you are
Your love is the reason I made it this far

Love is the reason
Love is the reason
Love is the reason
Reason
Love is the reason
Love is the reason
Love is the reason
