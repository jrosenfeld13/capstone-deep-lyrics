Their secrets are untouched Oblivious to what you're thinking it's not what matters most Just the views of the ones speaking We can learn a new way to give Where it wouldn't be so hard to give Their stories start with love Build and mold their way around you Turns into your life Ends in better rage Starting off this new day seems so bright Still you grasp your cross and pray to be all right Cause' no matter what, or how they say it's the same old story everyday These sources are unreal They even tell you how to feel the look the act the sound All things sublimnally bound This is not going to that long So please try to lay back and wait The air is tight, I'll hold strong Soon this fight will be over There's no time to evacuate Accepting fate is a choice to asphyxiate A show of hands could stop their plans Things are about to change Would it matter anyway, they say You have a choice it take one voice, to make a difference
