You do not feel
You do not think
You do not love anymore
And you don't see it You only negotiate love moments
It's all neutralized
No more indentity
This story is not for me You people make me sick Gaodless and wicked
Creepy and cold Parts of my memory has been erased
You've destroyed my files
Oh but I'm getting nearer
It's all getting clearer Look for a passage way
Wait for the judgement day
The truth will be told
And my dreams unfold I'll find a way Godless and wicked
Creepy and cold I'm half alive here
But I have no fear
Cause I'll find the light yeah Time to changes
Everything re-arranges
I'm getting ready
At the break of dawn The fight is on Godless and wicked
Creepy and cold
