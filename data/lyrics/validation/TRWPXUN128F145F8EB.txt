Safe, I'm walking out the door
My head's doing somersaults
I don't know if I'm clean
Run, I'm jumping off the fence
I'm halfway to pay the rent
I can't make it out here

Karma makes a home
Sleeping citizens
Come in, lock the door
It's how you play the game

Cross, it's easy when you run
It's always when you find
Half the day has gone by

Karma makes a home
Sleeping citizens
Come in, lock the door
It's how you play the game

Well I've seen my own reflection
Running down off the sidewalk
It's moving faster than the sun can

Karma makes a home
Sleeping citizens
Come in, lock the door
It's how you play the game
