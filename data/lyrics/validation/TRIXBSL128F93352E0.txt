I can't find a better way than to say
Why can't we just drop everything
Start it over, 'cause I know you'll be missing me
You got two problems, one hand in his
And the other is a clenched fist
Soon enough you'll be singing my songs
If he's smart enough he can catch on and move along

I miss the way you move
If there ever was a time to

Swing your hands
Might as well swing your waist
To the bump of the bass
To the bump bump bump
I know you for catching my eye
But can you catch this falling heart in time?
Go ahead girl swing your body into mine

And if you're ready for a good time
And I know you're past due
I've seen the boys you've been through
Don't you roll your eyes girl
You know what you're losing

I miss the way you move
If there ever was a time to

Swing your hands
Might as well swing your waist
To the bump of the bass
To the bump bump bump
I know you for catching my eye
But can you catch this falling heart in time?
Go ahead girl swing your body into mine

You say I'm a low life dirtbag
Can't say I was made for you
You used to never turn your back that's
How I knew you were made for me
And if you promise not to laugh
I miss your laughter
And if you promise not to cry
I miss your comfort

I miss the way you move
If there ever was a time to

Swing your hands
Might as well swing your waist
To the bump of the bass
To the bump bump bump
I know you for catching my eye
But can you catch this falling heart in time?
Go ahead girl swing your body into mine
