He will never be the boy for you
She is not the girl for me
I have never felt sure
Of anyone or anything
As sure as I now feel of you

Here we are and yes together we belong

Together we belong
You and I

I had a friend who treated love
Like a luxury development
On the other side of town
And one day his girl got up
And left and slammed the door
And his fine walls came falling down

But don't be blue he built a fairground there
For you and I to ride

Together we belong
You and I

Love is like a rollercoaster ride
Sometimes scary
Many times we have to pay
We shut our eyes and hold on tight
And hope this rollercoaster knows
This rollercoaster knows its way

And when our ride comes to an end
We'll never part

Together we belong
You and I

I look into your eyes and see myself
Loves surprises never disappear
And if our horse is beaten at the post
Let's hope our luck in love will persevere

Together we belong
You and I

Here we are and yes together we belong

Together we belong
You and I
