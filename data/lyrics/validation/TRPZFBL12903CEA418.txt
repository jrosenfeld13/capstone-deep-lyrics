[Chorus:]
Well, it's hard to love and not be loved
It's hard to please your mind
When you've broken the heart of many a poor boy
But you'll never break this heart of mine
Can't you see that lonesome ship that sails
That sails from shore to shore
If I was on that lonesome ship
I'd sail away no more

[Chorus]
Well I wish I was a pretty little bird
I wish I was a pretty little bee
I wish I was so far away
No more you'd see of me

[Chorus]
The blackest crow that ever flew
Will never turn to white
If you will prove your love to me
I'd turn my day to night

[Chorus]
Oh Lord
No you'll never break this heart of mine
