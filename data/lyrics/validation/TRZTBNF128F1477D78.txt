You gotta have skin
All you really need is skin
Skin's the thing that if you got it outside
It helps keep your insides in

It covers your nose
And it's wrapped around your toes
And inside it you put lemon meringue
And outside ya hang your clothes

Skin is what ya feel at home in
And without it, furthermore
Both your liver and abdomen
Would keep falling on the floor

(And you'd be dressed in your intestine)

A Siamese twin
Needs an extra set of skin
When the doctor knows that you're feeling sick
Where does he stick his needle in?
In the end of your skin

All your friends and all your kinfolks
Whether poor or whether rich
They have all got lots of skin, folks
It's convenient when they itch

(Nothing can match it when ya scratch it)

It fits perfectly
Yours fits you, and mine fits me
When you're sitting down, it folds and looks grand
And then when you stand, it's where it's been
Ain't ya glad you've got skin!

When you were just a little baby, why your skin fit fine
And it still is gonna fit you when you're six foot nine
So whether you're fat, tall, big, small, chubby or thin
Ain't ya glad you've got skin!
