Funkin' it in the ..... house
Now in the almighty sight
Violence is wrong
Don't beat up your girl
An' talk about you're a badman
'cause you're an idiot
You ain't got nothing going on
Nothing going on
You ain't got nothing going on
Hypocricy, racialism, crack heads on the front line
Full of ism and saism
Nar say a ting you know
You nar say a ting - way you ain't got nothing going on
They're talking about the rules and regulations everyday
The earth leaders break them in every way
Economy mash
The pound it crash
The queen and her family. they had to a dash. out the back door
'cause they can't take it no more
An' from they do dat we know tehy idiot fe sure
Nar say a ting
You ain't got nothing going on
D-u-b w-a-r, dat a we yes dat a we
D-u-b w-a-r, dat a we yes dat a we
'cause they talk world peace
But they don't want world peace
All they want is the war to increase
The poor as long as you stay poor
More money the rich
Das how they it for sure
Nar say a ting
You ain't got nothing going on
I am gonna tell the world about you. i am gonna let the people know
Gonna sing it from the hill an' trees
In a da almighty sight
Violence is wrong
