Firstly
We lived in a crater where our eyes glowed
We secrete liters of secrecy
Hello

What do you picture makes a frame
What you do everyday is the same
Turn off the lights and shake your hips
Let's make like a couplet, like 2 pairs of lips

Pop goes the ceiling of routine
Pop goes the feeling of sitting

Blow your head on the turn of the fan
Don't put another down payment on the oil in Iran

Can't you see you've got honorable mention
Can't you see you've got no pension plan?

It's time to decide, we make it or we die

Hey nuclear war, we're in a hotbed of trouble
Make with the penance, or repent on the double
We're going down in smoke and flames
We're going down and there's no one to blame

Keep it cold in a cool dry place
In a tucked away space
Save it with the face

Clean the egg, don't make me beg
Save us
