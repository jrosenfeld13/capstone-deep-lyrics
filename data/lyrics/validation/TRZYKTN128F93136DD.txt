Tell me why is this feeling so right
'Cause I've been waiting
Waiting to hold you all night

Now we're together
I don't want this feeling to ever end
Make this last forever
I don't want this feeling to ever end

You don't know
What you do to me
You don't know
You just don't know

When we're together
Nothing in my life feels better
I want you to know this
Feelings my heart exploding

So baby, it's now or never
We'll be with each other until the end
What we have is something special
We'll be with each other until the end

You don't know
What you do to me
You don't know
You just don't know
