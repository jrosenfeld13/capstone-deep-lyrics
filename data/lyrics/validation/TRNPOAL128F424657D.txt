Life ain't nothing but touching and caring
Having and sharing
So glad I found out
What life's all about

Life ain't nothin' but movin' (movin')
And groovin' (groovin')
Pickin' and choosin' (pickin' and choosin')
And I feel brand new, since I chose you

Life ain't nothing but being with the one you love
Doing things you love to do
There's nothing like knowing that you care for somebody
And somebody cares for you

Then you know that you're winning (winning)
Not losing (losing), jazzin' not bluesin'
So glad I found out
What life's all about

When you're with the one you love
Doing things you love to do
There's nothing like knowing that you care for somebody
And somebody cares for you

Then you know that you're winning (winning)
Not losing (losing), jazzin' not bluesin'
So glad I found out
What life's all about

Life is not about losin' (losin')
Yeah baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, touch me (touch me)
Show me that you care (touch me)
Touch me
Show me that you care
Then I'm winning, not losin'
Jazzin' not bluesin'
So glad I found out
What life's all about (touchin')
Life ain't nothing but movin' (carin')
And groovin' (groovin')
And together choosin'
Baby, baby, please, baby, baby touch me
Show me that you care
Baby, baby, touch me (touch me)
Show me that you care
Ah, touch me (touch me)
Show me that you care
And I'm winnin' not losin'
Jazzin' not bluesin'
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (touchin')
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (and carin')
(touchin' and carin')
(touchin' and carin')
(touchin' and carin')

(touchin' and carin')
(touchin' and carin')
