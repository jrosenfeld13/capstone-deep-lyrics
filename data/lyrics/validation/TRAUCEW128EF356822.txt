[Verse 1]
You and your friends
In boxes of ten
Cool to the touch
You warm me so much
The white to your left
The red to your right
Were all that I'd seen
Till I realized the love that I seek
Lies right in-between

[Chorus]
Ros
I love ya
Especially today
Ros
I love your delicate way

[Verse 2]
The chill in my veins
Relieves me from pain
Again and again
I lose all control
Your taking your toll
And I'm no longer sane
Don't be afraid
The love that I show
Is the love that you made
So don't be afraid
Cause your in control
I'm just your slave

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Don't let him put you down
I won't let him put you down
Cause your as good as the rest
And you're much better dressed
I think pink is my color
I won't drink from no other
Never!

[Outro]
Oh I love ya
Especially today
Especially this way
Oh Rose
I want ya
Believe me this way
Rose
I love your delicate way
