This is not a song about politics
This is not as ong about sex
If you want I'll talk about arrogance
And if you're respectfully dressed
This song is not about old James Dean
'Cause he's mentioned in too many songs already
My friend
This is not a song about animals
This is not a song about trees
There are times when you cannot trust no-one
Tell me why does this have to be
This song is not about rich or poor
It's about how we probably feel insecure
My friend
This is a song
I wrote especially for you
I want to say thankyou for having me too
'Cause I'm glad to be here on this earth
Living out all my dreams to their worth
And most of all I love you all and wish you well
HOPE YOU REALISE MY SOLITUDE A LITTLE
