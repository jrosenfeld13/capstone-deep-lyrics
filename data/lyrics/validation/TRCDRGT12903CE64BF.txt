You've done me wrong for a long, long time
And all you've done still never changed my mind
So please try to love me, oh please, honey, try
My love for you will never die
You've done me wrong for a long, long time
And all you've done still never changed my mind
So please try to love me, oh please, honey, try
My love for you will never die
These flowers grow where I lay and rest
And these colored blossoms, darling, hold to your breast
And darling, I know it's my mind breaking out from inside
My love for you will never die
