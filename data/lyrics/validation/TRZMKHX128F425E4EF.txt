[Verse]
People are puppets held together with string
There's a beautiful sadness that runs through him
As he asked me to pray to the god he doesn't believe in

Time and again boys are raised to be men
Impatient they start, fearful they end
But here was a man mourning tomorrow
He drank, but finally drowned in his sorrow

[Chorus]
He could not break surface tension
He looked in the wrong place for redemption
Don't look at me with those eyes
I tried to unheave the ties
Turn back the time that drew him
But he couldn't be saved
A sadness runs through him, through him

Time and again boys are raised to be men
Impatient they start, fearful at the end
But here was a man mourning tomorrow
Who drank, but finally drowned in his sorrow

[Chorus]

Don't look [x2]
Don't, don't

Don't look at me with those eyes
I tried to unheave the ties
Turn back the time that drew him
But he couldn't be saved
No, he couldn't be saved
A sadness runs through him [x5]
