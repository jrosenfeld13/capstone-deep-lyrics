Shadows they fall
On the stage of your own life
Trailing behind footsteps
There's comfort in ghosts
Who are no longer with you
Hiding behind your steps

I let you down
You've lost your taste
I'm losing ground
I fall from grace
Well just listen
Sometimes

You gotta set free what you love
Just to bring it back
Would you ever lose me?
Would you ever let go for that?
And if the love is real
You gotta let yourself go
Just to bring it back, sometimes
Just to bring it back

Hiding inside my asylum
I'm always hanging on by a thread
I can't expect you to respect me
Until I've learned to respect myself

I let you down
You've lost your taste
I'm losing ground
I fall from grace
Well just listen
Sometimes

You gotta set free what you love
Just to bring it back
Would you ever lose me?
Would you ever let go for that?
And if the love is real
You gotta let yourself go
Just to bring it back, sometimes
Just to bring it back
The love you're bringing back

I let you down
You've lost your taste
I'm losing ground
I fall from grace
Well just listen
Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes

You gotta set free what you love
Just to bring it back
Would you ever lose me?
Would you ever let go for that?
And if the love is real
You gotta let yourself go
Just to bring it back, sometimes
Just to bring it back
The love you're bringing back

You gotta set free what you love
Just to bring it back
Would you ever lose me?
Would you ever let go for that?
And if the love is real
You gotta let yourself go
Just to bring it back, sometimes
Just to bring it back
The love you're bringing back
