I'm not the type to hang around
Chasing shadows
When the sun has gone
Once again I'm leavin'
Mornin' I'll be movin' on

I've made myself a way of life
On tomorrows
Holding something new
Try to understand me
Deep inside I'm much like you

Long as I can touch somebody
Make them laugh instead of cry
Save my tears until tomorrow
I'll pass them by, I've got to try

I've had my share of broken dreams
And I've noticed
That you've had yours too
You should understand me
Deep inside I'm much like you

Long as I can touch somebody
Make them laugh instead of cry
Save my tears until tomorrow
I'll pass them by, I've got to try

I'm not the type to hang around
Chasing shadows
When the sun has gone
Once again I'm leavin'
Mornin' I'll be movin' on
Movin' on
