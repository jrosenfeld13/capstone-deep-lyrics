Everywhere I go I see your face
Looking through your eyes I found my place
The day you came you set the scene for me
You fill my head with colors when I dream
Too much to think about
Too much to think about
All the pretty pictures in their frames
Call to me with words that speak your name
I feel a new sensation happening
You fill me up with all the things I could be
Too much to think about
Too much to think about
When I turn you on you light my way
Fly me high above in your jet plane
The warmth I feel inside always remains
You somehow free my mind
I can't explain
Too much to think about
Too much to think about
Too much to think about
Too much to think about
