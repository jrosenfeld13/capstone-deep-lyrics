I'm happy as the candle on my table
That lights my words
Deserving atleast half the credit
For giving me the chance to edit
Trickled out, articulate my thoughts
And i am thankful for the light
A little warmth, a little incense

And it rains a longer time
And it rains a longer time
And it rains a longer time

I'm happy as the candle on my table
That lights my words
