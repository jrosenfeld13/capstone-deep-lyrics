[Verse 1]
Alright so this is it
I've finally had enough
Of hanging 'round here
Feeling sorry for myself
It's almost been 5 years
Of trying just enough
To keep from feeling
Bad enough about myself
To question what went wrong

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's like I woke up from a dream
Where I was trapped inside a bottle
And part of me had been shot off
And boarded up

[Chorus]
And here I am
All the choices I never make
And the chances I never take
The steps I wish I could retrace

[Pre-Verse]
But I'm not giving up
No, I'm not giving up

[Verse 2]
Until the day
My eyes roll back into my head
Until I choke on my last breath
Until no one remembers
A single goddamn thing
I've ever said or done

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But I woke up from my dream
And I threw away the bottle
And everything I boarded up
Came pouring out then
The sky has never looked so clear
Through bloodshot eyes without the fear
Of letting go
And moving on and walking on my own

[Chorus]
And here I am
All the choices I never make
And the chances I never take
The steps I wish I could retrace

[Bridge]
This is a trap
The life we lead
The life we lead's a lie
We owe ourselves
Much more than what we now accept
Until the day our eyes roll back
Until we choke on our last breath
Until no one remembers (x2)

[Outro](x2)
(Here I am)
All the choices I never make
And the chances I never take
The steps I wish I could retrace
(Here I am)
All the choices I never make (here I am)
And the chances I never take (here I am)
The steps I wish I could retrace
