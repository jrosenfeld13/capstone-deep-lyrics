How do you do?
Im not allowed to fall in love
What can you do
When Fate is playing God?
Loving is denied
But longing is alright

If only I could see that smile
I just want to hear that laughter on my doorstep

How do you do?
I wouldnt mind being introduced to
Someone like you
Its nothing Im used to
I could be seduced so easily
I would be seduced too easily

If only I could see that smile
I just want to hear that laughter on my doorstep
I wouldnt swear but I think
Id really like you there

Id only look
Wouldnt touch

I wouldnt touch Id only look
I wouldnt dream of that much luck
Less is more, but Ill confess
I am an addict, more or less
I quit smoking, eat veggie food
Ive abolished my neggie moods

Im a good good boy
A good good boy
