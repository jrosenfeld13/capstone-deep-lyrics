Oh, whoa, now, can't believe it, i love you, heaven...
Love can knock you out when it first hits you
Listen, i tell ya, you can't really stop it when it starts
You try it... boy, it's great to have someone to talk to
Someone who can listen from the heart
Oh, you're like the calm before the storm
Yeah, you're like the sunlight breaking dawn
You can take the cold and make it warm
I wrote you this song, now, i wrote it for her
I wrote it for love, i called it your song
Now i've got somebody to hold onto
Love was always something out of reach
Yes, a rebel(?)...she appreciates the things that i do
Oh no... now i've got something i'm going to keep
Oh, you're like the calm before the storm
Yeah, you're like the sunlight breaking dawn
You can take the cold and make it warm
I wrote you this song, wonder why we never chatter
Some sweets on the peace
Like the moonlight through the trees
Gets me everything i need
So i wrote you this song, i wrote it for her
I wrote it for love, yes, i called it your song, oh
I want the world to know
I love you, i love you, i love you, i do, yeah
Oh right now, can't get enough, can't get enough
Oh, you're like the calm before the storm
Yeah, you're like the sunlight breaking dawn
You can take the cold and make it warm
I wrote you this song, wonder why we never chatter
Calm before the storm, like the sunlight now breaking dawn
Take the cold to give, it gets so warm
I wrote you this song, now, i wrote it for her
I wrote it for love, i called it your song
