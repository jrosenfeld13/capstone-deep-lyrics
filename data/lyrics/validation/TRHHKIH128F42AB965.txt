I call (summon) you the unborn
The lord of the night
The ruler of the abyss
I call (summon) you through
The silence of the viper
The crying of the dead
The pain of an injured cat!!!
Through the mystic passage
In the land of dead
Trip to another dimension
(Where) meet the kings of elements
(Where) they define the power of gods!!!
(Where) they define the power of gods!!!
"He who once was an outcast
More villainous than divas guts
We appeal to you now
Send the angel of revenge!!!"
Behind the crystal dreams
Where revenge causes victims
Among innocent and guilty
Incorporeal figures
Get out of the shadow
Leading the dance of immortals
Spirits, fires, lightnings!!!
I'm always seeking salvation
Nevertheless I end up
To everlasting isolation
Archetypes of ancient rituals
And mystic, apocryphal knowledge
Belief of some kingdom
Lost in centuries!!!
My eyes never saw
The Promised Land
My look wanders
In dark places, unholy and abyssic!!!!
And when time stops
And the sunbeams
Pass the gates
Of the dark kingdom
Of the folds of the mind
Covered with webs
Then all the beauty
Will overflow
And the hope
Of a suffering world!!!
My eyes never saw
The Promised Land
My look wanders
In dark places, unholy and abyssic!!!!
Send the Angel of Revenge!!!!
