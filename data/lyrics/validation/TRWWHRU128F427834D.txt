Walk on city light
Walk on in the night
Run on down the street
What I got I'm gonna keep

Walk on city lights
Walk on city lights
Oh it's a pity
It's a city

Yes it's the city
That's the pity

Help me in the backside door
I got what I want I need more
Take me to your car
Drag me to your bar
Walk on city lights
Walk on city lights
Oh it's a pity
It's a city

Church steeple grip hold in the city
Neon bright cold night, in the city
Skyscrape break your taken in the city
Dark is the city that's the pity
Church steeple grip on in the city
Neon bright cold night in the city
Skyscrapers their take in the city

Walk

Walk

Walk
Walk
Walk
Walk
Walk

Walk on city light
Walk on in the night
Hold me up on my money
Please don't shoot me honey

Walk on city light, city light
Walk on city light, daylight

Walk, Walk
Walk, Walk

Walk the light, walk on
Walk the light, walk on

Walk, Walk
Walk the light, walk on
Walk the light, walk on

Walk, Walk
Walk the light, walk on
Walk the light, walk on

Walk, Walk
Walk the light, walk on
Walk the light, walk on
