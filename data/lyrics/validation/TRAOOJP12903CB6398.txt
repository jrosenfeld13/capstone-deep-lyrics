And suddenly I felt it all
I disappeared from the world you never fear
I'm waiting for it to explode
I want to see you burn

Suddenly I have a heart
I disappear from the love we never had
Will you ever hit the ground (?)
Or keep it in my mind

'Cause I'm losing my perspective
As I want you all to know
That I'm free from your injections

You'll never see me run again
On the way, on the way to your heart
You'll never see me run again
On the way, on the way to your heart
On the way, on the way, on the way
To your heart

And suddenly you want to be
Suddenly you want to be so true
I don't want to taste your end
I had a different thought inside

And I became the one you dreamed of
In confusion you made me think the same
I couldn't hear, I was lost again
Never thought you'd let me in

But I'm losing my direction
When I try to see you fail
But I'm free from your implosion (?)

And I'm losing my perspective
As I want you all to know
That I'm free from your injections

You'll never see me run again
On the way, on the way to your heart
You'll never see me run again
On the way, on the way to your heart

You'll never see me put you what you would win (?)
You'll never catch me on the way to you
You'll never see me put you what you would win (?)
You'll never catch me on the way to you
To your heart
