I never thought, I never dreamed
That things would get the better of me
But then a shadow crept just behind me

Oh I guess you can't run
Forever on your own
No, no

Tell me, tell me
Will you walk with me
Just for a little while
Until the feeling's gone

Tell me, tell me
Will you walk with me
Just for a little while
Until the feeling's gone

It gets so cruel
It gets so cruel out there in the world outside
When you're standing, just standing on your own
Oh, it seems like every little part of your soul's exposed
And I know out there, no one's on your side

I'm not asking for you to fall in love
For some great romance
Just be with me until the feeling's gone

Tell me, tell me
Will you walk with me
Just for a little while
Until the feeling's gone

Feeling's
Feeling's
Feeling's
Gone
Gone
Gone

Tell me, tell me
Will you walk with me
Just for a little while
Until the feeling's gone

So how about you, my shadow and me
Just us three, just us three
Walking on
