I've Gone Flying, Trying To Reach You
You've Been Hiding, Riding Me To A State Like This

Give Me That Window To
Give Me That Window To
Give Me That Window To The World

We Are Sailing, Flailing Through The Ether
You've Been Trailing, Failing Me With You're
View Of Bliss

Give Me That Window To
Give Me That Window To
Give Me That Window To The World

A Little More Than This
A Little Less Than That
You've Got Magic In Your Hands

A Little More Like This
A Little Less Like That
I've Got Magic In My Hands

You've Conspired, Inspired Me To
Find A Place Like This

Give Me That Window To
Give Me That Window To
Give Me That Window To The World
