Yeah, I gotta admit
It really doesn't seem like it's been this long
But it turned out better than we thought
And they say us proved them wrong
'Cause we have held the promises that we made
The sun - it shines on us
Though people try to throw in shade
But with a son and two daughters later
Seven years deep like Will and Jada
Givin' our praise to the creator
Because I know he's greater than anything
That we could ever do
Ain't none of it would be possible without you

Through love and peace and pain
Yes, we held each other through the pouring rain
We laughed, and we cried; we flied together

So many said we wouldn't make it together
But still we say it's gonna last forever
But everyday we try to make it better
Flyin' over all the stormy weather
You told me you would hold me down
And though I really never show it
I know you love me, and I've always known it
There's nothin' left to prove
There's only one for me
And I'm the one for you

Through love and peace and pain
Yes, we held each other through the pouring rain
We laughed, and we cried; we flied together

Many will come into your life
But one will battle through this life
I found the love of my life, in you
In you
I see the future in your eyes
Stick with me long enough to recognize
Joy laughs and it cries

Through love and peace and pain
Yes, we held each other through the pouring rain
We laughed, we cried, we flied together
Through love and peace and pain
Yes, we held each other through the pouring rain
We laughed, and we cried; we flied together
Through love and peace and pain
Yes, we held each other through the pouring rain
We laughed, and we cried; we flied together
