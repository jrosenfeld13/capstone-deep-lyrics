The insects in my bed
Will get inside my head tonight
And create pulsations
Through my veins and heart
They will be released through my fingers
And into my clothes
And tomorrow night
It will happen again
I'm gonna buy a new mattress
The ants will escape my eyes
The spiders will walk away
And the wasps, they will fly
I will be able to sleep again
I will be able to be with you again
And when I do I have the bestest dreams
About tanks and televisions and football teams
I'm gonna buy a new mattress
The ants will escape my eyes
The spiders will walk away
And the wasps, they will fly
I'm gonna buy a new mattress
The ants will escape my eyes
The spiders will walk away
And the wasps, they will fly
