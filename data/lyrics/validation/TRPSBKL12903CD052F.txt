Everyday, I see your face
Like a prayer, I pray each day
That my heart would be whole
And my soul be filled
And my mind nearing you, with you

With your arms open wide
I can see in my mind
Your letter just waiting for me

I run, I walk, I fly like a bird
(I run, I walk, I fly)
I swim to the sea like a [Incomprehensible]
(I swim to the sea)

But I'm drifting away
Yeah, to the river of life
Oh, to the river of life
You're my river of life

Like a tower, you're my grace
Like a shield, fear every place
Surrounding with angels, the millions above
I stand on the mountain top, you show me your love

The glory around you, is all on my head
Cleanse me from everything I've done
Everything I said

I walk, I run, I swim to the sea
(I walk, I run, I swim)
I fly like a bird, like the eagle with wings
(I fly)

And I fly to your arms, deep down inside
And I fly to your arms 'cos you're my river of life
(My river, my river, my river)
You're the river of life
(My river, my river, my river)

Yeah, I fly to the river
I run to the ocean sea
I know the flowing in me
All the sounds that I hear inside of me

River, yeah
So and I run to the ocean, I circle the sea
To the river of my destiny, to the place where I'll be
Safely in your arms tonight, 'cos you're the river of life
(The river, the river, the river)

Yeah, yeah, river of life
(The river, the river, the river)
To the river of life
(The river, the river, the river)
The river of, the river of, the river of life
(The river, the river)
Yeah, the river of life
(The river, the river, the river)
