...The night is young... time to party down!!!

Another day is over
Another job well done
The air is ull of excitement
And no one's goin' home
Burnin' mesquite on the bar-b-que
Sweet sensimilia's smoke
Gitar playin' tequila moonlite
Give the fire a poke

I'm too wired to sleep tonite
I'm too wired

Grab another bottle
From an empty bus
Meet you by the hotel pool
Come on don't make a fuss!
Sand on my feet... breeze in my face
Shootin' stars in the night
Singin' songs under the moonshine
Keepin' the fire high!!

I'm too wired to sleep tonite
I'm too wired
I'm too wired to sleep tonite
I ain't tired
