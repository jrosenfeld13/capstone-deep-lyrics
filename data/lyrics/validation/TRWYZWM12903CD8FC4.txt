Cow Cow Boogie Lyrics
Artist(Band):Ella Fitzgerald

Out on the plains down near Santa Fe
I met a cowboy ridin' the range one day
And as he jogged along I heard him singin'
A most peculiar cowboy song
It was a ditty, he learned in the city
Comma ti yi yi yeah
Comma ti yippity yi yeah

Now get along, get hip little DOGIES
Get along, better be on your way
Get along, get hip little DOGIES
AND He trucked 'em on down that old fairway
Singin' his Cow Cow Boogie in the strangest way
Comma ti yi yi yeah
Comma ti yippity yi yeah

(Chorus)
Singin' his cowboy songs
He's just too much
He's got a knocked out western accent with a HARLEM touch
He was raised on LOCO WEED
He's what you call a swing half breed
Singin' his Cow Cow Booogie in the strangest way
Comma ti yi yi yeah
Comma ti yippity yi yeah

(CHORUS)
Singin' his cowboy songs
He's just too much
He's got a knocked out western accent with a HARLEM
Touch
THAT CAT was raised on LOCO WEED
JACK, He's what you call a swing half breed
Singin' his Cow Cow BOOGIE in the strangest way
Comma ti yi yi yeah
Comma ti yippity yi yeah
Comma ti yi yi yeah
Comma ti yippity yi yeah
GIT, GIT, GIT ALONG LITTLE DOGIES, YOU BETTER BE ON YOUR WAY
