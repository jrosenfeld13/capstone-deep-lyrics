Dreaming of how life can be
No them and us, just you and me
No rich or poor, no hate or war
Where everybody knows the score

No justice, there's no justice

Dreaming of a brighter day
Where everybody gets a say
Where no one lives out on the streets
And no one has to steal to eat

No justice, there's no justice

Living with reality
No justice in society
A mother cries, a baby die
And politicians tell you lies

No justice, there's no justice
