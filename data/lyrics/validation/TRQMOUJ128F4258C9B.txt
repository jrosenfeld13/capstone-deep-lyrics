I know this will be
Something I remember in my head
(something I remember)
Sharp words push me back
Hanging on to anything I can
(anything I can)

Why do you tell me
Only things I want to hear?
Why don't you tell me
This could just disappear?

At the same time
You keep tracking treasure down
At the same time...

Can't stop myself tonight
I wanna find something I believe
(something I believe)
Open up, take me in
Makes no sense
Help me understand
(help me understand)

Why do you tell me
Only things I want to hear?
Why don't you tell me
This could just disappear?

At the same time
You keep tracking treasure down
At the same time...

You tell me of pirate ships and fairytales
You had me wishing
That everything was real

At the same time
At the same time
You keep tracking treasure down
At the same time
