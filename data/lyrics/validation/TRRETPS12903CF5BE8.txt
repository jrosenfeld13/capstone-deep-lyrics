Now heaven is destroyed
By Satan
He will rule
The promised land
Now your soul will be freed
Through the gate
Find the KEY
To hell
Cross the river
Known as Styx
Charon awaits
In his boat

Now your soul will be freed
Through the gate
Find the seven
Keys to hell
Cross the river
Known as Styx
Kneel befour Lucifer's throne

[Chorus 2 Times]
Jesus wept-Standing in Blood
Praying to die -Standing in Blood
