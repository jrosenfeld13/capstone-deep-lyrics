Right...
Man has the right
To live by his own law
To live in the way
That he wills to do
To work as he will
To play as he will
To rest as he will
To live and die as he will
There is no god but man
There is no god but man
Man has the right
To think what he will
To speak what he will
How he wills to do
To write what he will
To dress how he will
To drink what he will
To live and die how he will
There is no god but man
There is no god but man
Man has the right
To kill those who
Would thwart these rights
There is no god
But man or woman
There is no god
In my sights...in my sights
