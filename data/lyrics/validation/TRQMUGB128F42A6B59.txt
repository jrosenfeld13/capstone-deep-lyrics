How low
Are you willing to go
Before you reach all
Your selfish goals

Punch line after punch line
Leaving us sore
Leaving us sore

Absorbed
In your ill hustling
Feeding a monster
Just feeding a monster

Invasion
After invasion
This means war
This means war

Someday you'll be up to your knees
In the shit you seed
All the gullible
That you mislead
Won't be up for it

Where to
Will you relocate
Now that it's war
Now that it's war
