I'm hanging in the air
No where familiar
My head's up in the clouds
My feet don't touch the ground

So I go sky walking
And I can hear you talking
But you're not saying nothing
Feels like you're playing me

And if you really want me
You've got to reassure me
Don't try and take me for a fool

[Hook]
Girl, you got me walking on a tightrope
Stuck here in the middle and it's no joke
Can't you see I'm falling for you?
I keep falling at your, I keep falling at your feet

I try to keep my balance
Loving you is a challenge
Girl, you're confusing me
I need some stability

I've gotta take this step
Don't want to have regrets
Life has no safety net
So tell me you'll be there

And as you reach out for me
My life flashes before me
I'm holding on don't let me down

[Hook x2]

On this tightrope, tightrope
Said on this tightrope, tightrope
Girl, you got me hanging round
Can't you see I'm falling on my knees?

Baby, please
Can't you see I'm falling on my knees?
Baby, please

[Hook x2]

Baby, I'm down on my knees
Just keep falling at your feet
Said, I'm begging you, begging you, please
I'm down on my, down on my knees, yeah
