I went down in Death Valley
Among the tombstones and dry bones
That's where poor me will be
Lord when I'm dead and gone
Now if I should die
I should die before my time
I want you to bury my body
Down by that Frisco line
Now bury me mama
Low down in the sand
Now bury me mama
Where I won't bother your next old man
Oh bye bye baby
I said goodbye
Death Valley is my home
Mama I want to die
Tell all the women
Please come dressed in red
They going down SixtyOne Highway
That's where the poor boy he fell dead
Wear your patent leather slippers
Mama put out your morning gown
You going to follow poor Crudup
Down to his burying ground
