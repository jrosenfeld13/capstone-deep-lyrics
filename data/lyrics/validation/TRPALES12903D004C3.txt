I can't design, I can't design my life
Decisions can be made in our name, that is the way
And isn't life just sweet?
For the morally bereft on fat seats
And isn't life just sweet?
For the villains of the piece
And isn't life just sweet?
A design for life taken neat
And isn't life just sweet? All of it!

I can smile a while, smile a mile wider than you
Am I world weary? That remains to be seen
Ballet is banned in Turkmenistan
I hold up my hands, I will never understand
And I forgive you. And I believe you
I can't kill you
But I forgive you. And I believe you
But I can't kill you
I forgive you. I believe you
But I can't kill you
