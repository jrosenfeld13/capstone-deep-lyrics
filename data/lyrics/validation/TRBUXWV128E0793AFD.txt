Now that I have found you
In the coolth of your evening smile
The shade of your parasol
And your love flows through me
Though I drink at your pool
I burn for you
I burn for you

You and I are lovers
And nighttime falls around our bed
In peace we sleep entwined
And your love flows through me
Though an ocean soothes me head
I burn for you
I burn for you

Stars will fall from dark skies
As ancient rocks are turning
Quiet fills the room
And your love flows through me

Though I lie here so still
I burn for you
I burn for you
