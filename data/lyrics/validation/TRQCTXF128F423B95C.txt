[Verse 1]
Who are you to put us down
Who are you to cut us down
Who are you to point finger
Who are you to criticize

[Verse 2]
We who are with sacrifice
We who are with blood and fire
We who are from the beginning
We who are 'til the end

[Hook]
Independent
Voice of the voiceless

[Verse 3]
Who are you to criticize
Who are you make up lies
Who are you to pass judgment
Who are you destroy life

[Verse 4]
We who are the voice
We who are of the voiceless
We who are to live and die
We who are
We arise

[Hook]
Independent
Voice of the voiceless

Deus d vida longa aos meus inimigos

Deus d vida longa aos meus inimigos
Para que possam ver de p minha vitria
