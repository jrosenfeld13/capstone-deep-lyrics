Go in peace to love and to serve
And let your ears ring long with what you've heard
And may the bread on your tongue leave a trail of crumbs
To lead the hungry back to the place that you are from

And take to the world this love, this hope and faith
And take to the world this rare, relentless grace
And like the three in one, know you must become
What you wanna save 'cause that's still the way
He takes to the world

So go and go far, take light deep in the dark
Believe what's true He uses all, even you
And may the bread on your tongue leave a trail of crumbs
To lead the hungry back to the place that you are from

Well, and take to the world this love, this hope and faith
And take to the world this rare, relentless grace
And like the three in one, know you must become
What you wanna save 'cause that's still the way
And He takes to the world

Well, and take to the world this love, this hope and faith
And take to the world this rare, relentless grace
And like the three in one, know you must become
What you wanna save 'cause that's still the way
And He takes to the world, He takes to the world
