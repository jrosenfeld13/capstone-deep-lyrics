[Chorus]

As you leave please tip-toe down the backstairs of my life
Down the backstairs of my life

[Verse 1]

Everything is all you ever meant and said to me
Everything you meant to me
Could you live with all the hurt and the pain
And the tears again?
Yesterday could be a song for the years refrain
Think the best of me
I've given all I've been out for
Oh, I've been bought out

[Chorus]

As you leave please tip-toe down the backstairs of my life
Down the backstairs of my life

[Bridge]

When you leave you take all my dreams outside my door
Risk the heart is crying more and more, encore
In the darkness now all I can see is where we've been
Oh, where we've been

[Chorus]

As you leave please tip-toe down the backstairs of my life
Down the backstairs of my life
Down the backstairs of my life
Down the backstairs of my life
The backstairs of my life
