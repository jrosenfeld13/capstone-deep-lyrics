[Intro]
I can't be compromising in my thoughts no more
I can't prevent the times my anger fills my heart
I can't be sympathising with a new lost cause
I feel I've lost my patience with the world and all

[Verse 1]
And all the politicians and their hollow promises
And all the lies, deceit and shame that goes with it
The working man pays everything for their mistakes
And with his life too if there was to be a war

[Chorus]
So we only get one chance
Can we take it?
And we only get one life
Can't exchange it
Can we hold on to what we have?
Don't replace it
The age of innocence is fading like an old dream

[Verse 2]
A life of petty crime gets punished with a holiday
The victims' minds are scarred for life most everyday
Assailants know just how much further they can go
They know the laws are soft, conviction chances low

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You can't protect yourselves, even in your own home
For fear of vigilante cries the victims wipe their eyes
So now the criminals, they laugh right in our face
Judicial system lets them do it, a disgrace

[Verse 3]
Despondent public worries where it all will end
We can't protect ourselves, our kids from the crime trend
We cannot warn each other of evil in our midst
They have more rights than us, you cannot call that just

[Chorus]

The age of innocence is fading like an old dream
