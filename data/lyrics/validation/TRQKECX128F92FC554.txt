Newsreels rattle the Nazi dread
The able bodied have shipped away
Molly McGee gets her tea leaves read
You'll be married in a month they say

These leaves are crazy
Just look at this town there's no men left
Just frail old boys and babies
Talking to teacher in the treble clef

She plants her garden in the spring
She does the winter shoveling
Tokyo Rose is talking on the radio
She says, ?I'm leaving here?, but she don't go

Out of the blue, just passing through
A young flight sergeant on two weeks leave says
"Molly McGee, no one else will do"
And he seals the tea leaf prophecy

Oh, those nights are strong and soft
Private passions and secret storms
Nothing about him ticked her off
And he looks so cute in his uniform

She plants her garden in the spring
He does the winter shoveling
But summer's just a sneeze in a long, long, bad winter cold
Soon she says, "I'm leaving here", but she don't go

Sleep, little darling
This is your happy home
Hiroshima cannot be pardoned
Don't have kids when you get grown

This world is shattered
The wise are mourning, the fools are joking
Oh, what does it matter
The wash needs ironing and the fire needs stoking

She plants her garden in the spring
He does the winter shoveling
Now there's three of them laughing 'round the radio
She says, "I'm leaving here", but she don't go

She plants her garden in the spring
They do the winter shoveling
They sit up late and watch the Johnny Carson Show
She says, "I'm leaving here?, but she don't go, she don't go
