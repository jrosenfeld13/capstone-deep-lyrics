You with the jaundiced eyes
Drunk on your own reflection
Propped up with desks and flags
Eight chairs short of perfection

Lines drawn here, there and everywhere
None of your own volition
Unrecognized, you pace in your shadow
Stripped of all your definition

[Chorus]
Scour the house
Flip the wig
Shake the tree
Scour the house
Flip the wig
Shake the tree
Until your whereabouts are known to me

You've been abused and cheated
Shat on you're beyond defeated
Those who rise stand in your name
Then treat you roughly once they're seated
Your pen in one, sword in the other
Satisfied the blessing is given
In God they trust, only their way--one way
Afraid of the other "isms"

[Chorus]

The grass, it is always greener
Under the western skies
But your Norman Rockwell nation
Is being choked by weeds and vines

Look here the old grey mare
She ain't what she used to be
Look here the old grey mayor
He's all he's cracked up to be

Scour the house, flip the wig, shake the tree
Scour the house, flip the wig, shake the tree
Scour the house, flip the wig, shake the tree
Scour the house, flip the wig, sShake the tree
Until your, until your, until your
Whereabouts are known to me
Your whereabouts are known to me
Your whereabouts are known to me
Your whereabouts are known
Your whereabouts are known
Your whereabouts are known
