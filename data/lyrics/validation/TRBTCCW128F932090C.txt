[Verse 1: Alex Turner]
About as subtle as an earthquake, I know
My mistakes were made for you
And in the back room of a bad dream she came
And whisked me away, enthused
And it's solid as a rock rolling down a hill
The fact is that it probably will hit something
On the hazardous terrain

[Pre-Chorus: Alex Turner]
And we're just following the flock around and in between
Before we smash to smithereens like they were
Then we scramble from the blame

[Chorus: Alex Turner]
And it's the fame that put words in her mouth
She couldn't help but spit 'em out
Innocence and arrogance entwined
In the filthiest of minds

[Verse 2: Alex Turner]
She was bitten on her birthday, and now
A face in the crowd, she's not
And I suspect that now, forever the shape
She came to escape is forgot
And it's a lot to ask her not to sting
And give her less than everything
Around your crooked conscience she will wind

[Pre-Chorus: Alex Turner]
'Cause we're just following the flock around and in between
Before we smash to smithereens like they were
Then we scramble from the blame

[Chorus: Alex Turner]
And it's the fame that put words in her mouth
She couldn't help but spit 'em out
Around your crooked conscious she will wind
And it's a lot to ask her not to sting
And give her less than everything
Innocence and arrogance entwined
