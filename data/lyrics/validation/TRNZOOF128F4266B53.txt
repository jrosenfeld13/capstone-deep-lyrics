[Verse 1]
When I wake up
All I want is for him to take me away
To that incredible comfort zone
Inside that beautiful place

When I need to release tension
So that I can feel brand new
And reach that height
That only one in this whole world can take me to

[Bridge]
All the time I want you, baby
All the time I need you, honey
All the time I gotta have you, sugar
Because I'm addicted
Oh, yeah

All the time I want you, baby
All the time I need you, honey
All the time I gotta have you, sugar
It belongs to me

[Chorus x2]
I'm fanatically addicted, see
The way that he be loving me
It's like a drug
Or some bad habit
Since it's mine
I got to have it

[Verse 2]
Oh it feels like
Like I've never had it right before this
There was so much emotional pain
Nothing positive to gain

But I'm loved, full
And completely now
Not just a physical thang
But it's something spiritual

[Bridge]
All the time I want you, baby
All the time I need you, honey
All the time I gotta have you, sugar
Because I'm addicted
Oh, yeah

All the time I want you, baby
All the time I need you, honey
All the time I gotta have you, sugar
It belongs to me

[Chorus x2]

[Bridge]
I just gotta have it
I'm a fanatic
I just gotta have it
I'm a fanatic
I just gotta have it
I'm a fanatic
I just gotta have it
I'm a fanatic

All the time I want you, baby
All the time I need you, honey
All the time I gotta have you, sugar

[Chorus x4]
