Won't change my world for you...

Waiting in the dark
She's hoping for a call
But he won't be there at all
'Til the morning comes
With a never ending lie
He'll just look her in the eyes
And say their love is still alive
Then she'll turn and run
She says
Is this the way you think we're gonna go?
Just think again I don't wanna know

Easy love
With no meanin'
Oh, easy love
Ah, with no feelin's
Easy love

(Won't change my world)
Waiting for the train
On a cold and windy night
'Cos she's lost the will to fight
But she'll be back again
She cries
One rainy day I was fooled like this before
And anyway I don't need no more

Easy love
With no meanin's
Oh, easy love
Ah, with no feelin's
Easy love

Easy love
Easy love kills words of love
Easy love
Easy love kills words of love
Easy love
Easy love kills words of love
Easy love
Easy love kills words of love
Easy love

Easy love
With no meanin'
Easy love
Ah, with no feelin's
Easy love
With no meanin's
Oh easy love
With no meanin'

Love
