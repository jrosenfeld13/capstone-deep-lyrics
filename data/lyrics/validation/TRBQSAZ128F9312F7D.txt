She wants to glide in a parachute
Paper-thin
She feels so large up there
Looking down at them

Oh, fire up the forgiving
You, are you dead or living?
Another day, another fifteen cents
Where is my tiger, he?s over the fence

You never tell her
What she needs to hear
Just keep her guessing
You fill her up with doubt and fear

Oh, fire up the forgiving
You, are you dead or living?
Another day, another fifteen cents
Where is my tiger, he?s over the fence

You, with your loud pride
Mixed with Haitian rum
You with your sidestepping
The decay of your love
You sit and smoke with a stranger
Don?t stay too long

I know that you said she was crazy
But you needed someone
Oh, fire up the forgiving

You, are you dead or living?
Another day, another fifteen cents
Where is my tiger, he?s over the fence
