[Verse 1]
Mondays are a mystery, Tuesdays are all right
Wednesday's what I'm waiting for, especially the night
Thursdays are a tragedy, by Friday I'm uptight
Saturday I find myself, I'm the mistress of the night

[Bridge]
No stranger to your fantasy, lashings of a recipe
I'm whipping something up that's just for you, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Action's what I'm looking for, action's what I like
You know what my name is, I'm the mistress of the night
Sometimes I dress in black, sometimes I dress in white
Sometimes I dress so wicked, I give myself a fright
No stranger to your fantasy, lashings of a recipe
I'm whipping something up that's just for you, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Lay your body, lay your body, lay your body down
Lay your body, lay your body down
Lay your body, lay your body, lay your body down
Lay your body, lay your body down

[Bridge]
No stranger to your fantasy, lashings of a recipe
I'm whipping something up that's just for you, oh yeah
Oh yeah

Lay, oh lay, oh lay
Your body next to mine

[Verse 3]
Action's what I'm looking for, action's what I like
You know what my name is, I'm the mistress of the night
Sometimes I dress in black, sometimes I dress in white
Sometimes I dress so wicked, I give myself a fright
No stranger to your fantasy, lashings of a recipe
I'm whipping something up that's just for you, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Lay your body, lay your body, lay your body down
Lay your body, lay your body down
Lay your body, lay your body, lay your body down
Lay your body, lay your body down

[Bridge]
No stranger to your fantasy, lashings of a recipe
I'm whipping something up that's just for you, oh yeah
Oh yeah

[Outro]
Lay your body down, I wanna lay your body down
Sometimes I'm dressed in black
Lay your body down, I wanna lay your body down
Sometimes I'm dressed in white
Lay your body down, I wanna lay your body down
Sometimes I wear nothing at all
Lay your body down, I wanna lay your body down
Sometimes I'm dressed in white
Lay your body down, lay your body down
Lay your body down, lay your body down
Lay your body down, lay your body down
Lay your body down, lay your body down
