Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
I was blind, but now I see

T'was grace that told my heart to feel
And grace my fear relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Amazing grace, how sweet that sound
That saved a wretch like me, yeah yeah yeah
I once was lost, but now I'm found
I was blind, but now I can see

Lordy, lordy, lordy
Amazing grace
Lordy, lordy, lordy
Amazing grace
Lordy, lordy, lordy
Oh, amazing grace
