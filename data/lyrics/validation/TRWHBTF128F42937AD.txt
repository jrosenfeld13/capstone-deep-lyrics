This is the land of my sunset
This is my tipsy turvy sky
I hear the soundless singing ocean
And I don't even have to try

Tumble and fumble as it rushes
Rapidly moving in my eyes
Breathe in enough to fell better
Heavenly hurting as I cry

Look at all these, all these reasons and explanations
For damage that I've done
I'm always trying but needing
All I need to be, be the one

I hold the jewel that keeps my body warm

Here are all the, all the these reasons
Reasons to believe what is wrong
And I can't be taken in silence
Can't you be the one, be the one I believe
Here it is going, so uncontrolling
But you know I can't be free

This is the land of my sunset
This is my tipsy turvy sky
I hear the soundless singing ocean
And I don't even have to try

Keeps my body warm
