Too old to die, too young to stay alive
Nothing matters yet I've got my whole life to regret
Just give me time and I'll let life pass me by
And I can close my eyes to opportunity
To responsibility, to what I don't want to see
I'll burn my bridges if I want to
You can't tell me what to do cause I won't listen to you
To anyone, to anything because I know nothing
Twenty-four thousand dollars and four years down the drain
And I'm still working for a slave wage
Oh yes, I know that I'm a worthless piece of shit
That I should get off my ass and start making it
But I'm lazy
I'm a spoiled little brat with a silver spoon that I keep spitting back in your face
I'm your little disgrace that you can smack back in to place
And treat me wrong because I know nothing
How many times will you tell me that I know nothing?
Nothing comforts me
Nothing comes from me and nothing is what will become of me
Now you see
Now you don't and it's better that way
I'd hate to disappoint you for nothing
