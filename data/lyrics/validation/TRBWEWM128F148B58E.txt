We're all on our own
So look at us all
How can we not raise a voice
Against the madness

There isn't the time
To wander or wait
Cause only the young can carry the weight
And face the silence

Do we run, do we stop
Do we lie down? I think not
There's an answer that we've got
We are not helpless, ooh, ooh, ooh

The vision will stand
As blindness will fall
Now we must look for the light
In the darkness

Do we run, do we stop
Do we lie down? I think not
There's an answer that we've got
We are not helpless, no, no, no, oh
