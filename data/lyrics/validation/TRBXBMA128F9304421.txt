One time or another, everyone I've known
Has taken a beating from these sticks and stones
Well, they're words with sharp edges, hurled at the heart
By tongues of fire, they tear you apart

Sticks and stones in condescending tones
Bruise the spirit and break the bones
Read these tombstones, cause of death unknown
Words that kill are sticks and stones

I must admit, my skin is thin
Words like these can make my heart cave in
Well, they tear me apart, they make me feel alone
Would you stop throwing these sticks and stones

Sticks and stones in condescending tones
Bruise my spirit and break my bones
Read these tombstones, cause of death unknown
Words that kill are sticks and stones

Sticks and stones in condescending tones
Bruise my spirit and break my bones
Read these tombstones, cause of death unknown
Words that kill are sticks and stones

Oh, no, sticks and stones are condescending tones
Bruise my spirit and break my bones
Read these tombstones, cause of death unknown
Words that kill are sticks and stones
Words that kill are sticks and stones

One time or another, everyone I've known
Has taken a beating from these sticks and stones
