Come on!

So messed up, I want you here
In my room, I want you here
No we're gonna be face to face
And I lay right down in my favourite place

Now i wanna be your dog
Now i wanna be your dog
Now i wanna be your dog
Now i wanna be your dog

Come on!

And now I'm ready to close my eyes
And now I'm ready to close my mind
Now I'm ready to feel your hand
And lose my heart into burning sand

Now i wanna be your dog
Now i wanna be your dog
Now i wanna be your dog
Now i wanna be your dog
