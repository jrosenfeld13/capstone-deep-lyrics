Livin' in the meadow
The mighty, mighty meadow
With too many people
Suckin' all the water
And my daddy was a farmer
He was a racecar driver
He is a four leaf clover
He is the next messiah

Now he's living in the woods
The dark and dank woods
With a cocktail waitress
Who thinks she's an artist
Take it down to the river
Split it right up the middle
Now it's gonna be trouble
For a pregnant lamb and a con man

Now he's sick in the clink
With his head in the sink
And the tumor gonna make a
Man outta him
Now, my daddy was a chancer
He was a bad-check bouncer
But he beat that cancer
He's a survivor

He's the next messiah
He's the next messiah
He's the next messiah
He's the next messiah

Covering it up
Squeezing it out
Watching it bleed
You're watching it all
Taking it back
She's down on her knees
When did she come to detest you?

Giving it back
Backing you up
Nothing's for free
You're giving it back
For locking you up
Those terrible deeds
When will they come to arrest you?
When did she come to detest you?

When will they come to arrest you?
When did she come to detest you?

I'm gonna give my love to you on a day you gotta bring it back
I'm gonna give my love to you on a day you gotta bring it back
(I want to tell you I love you) I'm gonna give my love to you
(I want to tell you I love you) on a day you gotta bring it back
(I want to tell you I love you) I'm gonna give my love to you
(I want to tell you I love you) on a day you gotta bring it back

I want to tell you I love you
I want to tell you I love you
(I'm gonna go out walking baby) I want to tell you I love you
(Better be here when I get back) I want to tell you I love you
(I'm gonna go out walking baby) I want to tell you I love you
(Better be here when I get back) I want to tell you I love you

I'm gonna give my love to you on a day you gotta bring it back
I'm gonna give my love to you on a day you gotta bring it back
I want to tell you I love you
I want to tell you I love you

He's the next messiah
He's the next messiah
He's the next messiah
He's the next messiah
