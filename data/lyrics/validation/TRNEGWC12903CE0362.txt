The reason why I'm not with you
I thought you didn't want to be with me
I stayed up all last night
Tryin' to figure why you slammed the door on me
And I thought of all the things I might have done last night
Some clumsy thing I didn't do or say just right
I worried myself right into a brand new day
My eyes are heart with tears and I just can't face fate

Tell me reason why you won't explain and I can't guess
Didn't I touch you right or should I talk a little less
Please tell me reason, please tell me reason why

The reason why I'm feelin' bad
I'm thinking that you may be leavin' me
Oh, I spent a lonely night in the kitchen
Tryin' to fight all the tears in me
I'm still at the table as the day unfolds
With a half a cup of coffee that by now is cold
The silence that you answer I don't understand
You know I try to read your face
You know I can

Tell me reason why you won't explain I just can't guess
Didn't I touch you right or should I talk a little less
Please tell me reason, please tell me the reason why
Tell me reason why
Tell me reason why
