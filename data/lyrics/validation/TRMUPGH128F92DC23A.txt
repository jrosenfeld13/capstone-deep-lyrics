There's something that I wanna say
So listen real close
It's about the way I feel inside
For the one I love the most (for the one I love the most oh)
Never even have to say a word
He knows what's on my mind
Got a bit of advice for you
You need to know this friend of mine

Hook:
Need to know, need to know, need to know now
Gotta know, gotta know, gotta know
Need to know, need to know, need to know now
Gotta know, gotta know, gotta know now
You need to know

Need to know, need to know, need to know now
Gotta know, gotta know, gotta know
Need to know, need to know, need to know now
Gotta know, everybody needs to know now

If you're looking for a full time love
With lifetime security
Let me hip you to the Father
Satisfaction guaranteed
To know Him is to love Him
Taste and see the Lord is so right
Like a whole lotta heaven
And a little bit of sweet potato pie

(Repeat Hook)

Bridge:
If you don't know you better ask somebody
Walkin' around like you don't need nobody
It's not a riddle, it ain't hard to figure out
Jesus is the only One you can't live without

Keyboard & drums: Fred Jerkins III
