Let's just today say love lives on
Say that the blacks and blues have faded
Are all gone
I am prepared to bandage over all our lies
But you can't expect a miracle to happen over night

Let's just today say love is war
With each new casualty you
Even out the score
I am the man who held you high when you fell down
Please understand it's hard to take
Another brutal round

And what's to gain for loving her?
Sweet moments saved amongst
The photographs we've stored
And what's to gain for loving her?
He wakes up falling for he's lost his equilibrium
But finds your arms and that's what love is worth

Let's just today say love is all
Say I remember well when we were still in love
You were the one who grew so tired of everything
But somehow I'm supposed to take
The lion's share of blame

And what's to gain for loving her?
Sweet moments saved amongst
The photographs we've stored
And what's to gain for loving her?
Red states and blue states at war for
Independence but within eachother's arms

Their love is growing strong, growing tall
Growing high, high, high
