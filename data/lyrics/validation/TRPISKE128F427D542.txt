Rock, rock, rock, everybody
Roll, roll, roll, everybody
Rock, rock, rock, everybody
Roll, roll, roll, everybody

Rock, rock, rock, everybody
Rock-a-beatin' boogie beat

You take a rock
You take a beat
You take a boogie
You make it sweet

You take a rock-a-beatin' boogie
Rock-a-beatin' boogie beat
Well, the rock-a-beatin' boogie
B-O-O-G-I-E

[Chorus:]
Well, rocking to the rhythm
Of the rock-a-beatin' boogie
Dancing to the rhythm of
The rock-a-beatin' boogie
Shaking to the rhythm of
The rock-a-beatin' boogie
Jumping to the rhythm of
The rock-a-beatin' boogie
Romping to the rhythm of
The rock-a-beatin' boogie
B-O-O-G-I-E

You gotta jump
You gotta jive
You gotta dance
To be alive

You do the rock-a-beatin' boogie
Rock-a-beatin' boogie beat
Oh, rock-a-beatin' boogie
B-O-O-G-I-E

[Repeat Chorus]
Rock, rock, rock, everybody
Roll, roll, roll, everybody
Rock, rock, rock, everybody
Roll, roll, roll, everybody

Rock, rock, rock, everybody
Rock-a-beatin' boogie beat
