Church Lady, can you spare her a song
Cos Glory Halleluiah, aint enough for her wrongs 
Church Lady, can she borrow some time
Cos she needs to sit down and reflect on her behind
She cant see the forest for the trees
She got a child whos only three
And no child is deserving
Of an open door policy

Church Lady, can you talk her some sense
She may be a friend of mine
But her values are worth two cents
Ive tried my point of view
All of her friends have tried it too
So Church Lady, sing her that song, sing her that song

Glory, (Halleluiah) Halleluiah
Let them show you the way
(Let em show you the way)
Glory, (Halleluiah) Halleluiah
Cos Thats already been paved
(Already been paved)
Glory, (Halleluiah) Halleluiah
(Let them show you)
Let them show you the way
(Ya-hay-ya-hay)
Glory, (Halleluiah) Halleluiah
Cos Thats already been paved
(Mm)

Church Lady, can you save her a prayer
She aint been home since last night
And shes got us runnin scared
Church Lady, do you have this emergency light
(Yes I do)
She needs to be safe from herself
Shes got her own way to find
She cant see the forest for the trees
She got a child whos only three
Shes got her head in the clouds
Holding on to some fantasy

Church Lady, you better find her a hymn
Shes going down that road
Shell be early seeing Him
Ive tried my point of view
All of her friends tried it too
So Church Lady, sing her that song, sing her that song

Glory, (Halleluiah) Halleluiah
Let show them you the way
(Let em show you the way)
Glory, (Glory) Halleluiah
Cos Thats already been paved
(Already been paved)
Glory, (Halleluiah) Halleluiah
(Let them show you)
Let them show you the way
(Ya-hay-ya-hay)
Glory, (Halleluiah) Halleluiah
Cos Thats already been paved
(Ya-ya-ya)

Halleluiah, its paved
I tried my point of view
All of her friends tried it too
So Church Lady, sing her that song, sing her that song
Sing her that song, sing her that song
