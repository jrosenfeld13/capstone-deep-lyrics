Well, I would if I could and if I got the chance
Make love to you right after the dance
We'll park by the river underneath the moon
On my old guitar I'll play you a tune

Things will be right and the moon will be bright
And maybe you'll let me hold you tight
Stick around baby and give me the chance
To make love to you right after the dance

--- Instrumental ---

Well, we won't quarrel and we won't fight
And maybe we'll stay out all the night
I'll hug and kiss you if you'll give me the chance
To make love to you right after the dance

We'll bill and coo and pitch a little woo
And maybe you'll say, Oh yes, I do
Well, I'll be the teacher if you'll take a chance
And we'll have call for preacher right after the dance...
