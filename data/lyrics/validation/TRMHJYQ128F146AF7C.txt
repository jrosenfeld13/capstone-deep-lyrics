I'm sleeping in the girls' room, I'm sleeping in the girls' room
I'm sleeping in the sky, I'm sleeping in the water
I'm sleeping in the girls' room, I'm sleeping in the girls' room
I'm sleeping in the girls' room tonight

Here comes Tiffany, my best friend, Tiffany
Wearing a size too small of sweater
Me and Tiffany, dressing up pretty
We love to ride, we love to canter
My best friend Tiffany, she is so popular
We're going from site to site and pool to pool tonight

And we hear Terry say that Trisha's okay, but she ought to learn to shave her bikini line better
And Tauren was born, like her mother in a storm
And Tracey's been away forever

I'm sleeping in the girls' room, I'm sleeping in the girls' room
I'm sleeping in the sky, I'm sleeping in the water
I'm sleeping in the girls' room, I'm sleeping in the girls' room
I'm sleeping in the girls' room tonight
