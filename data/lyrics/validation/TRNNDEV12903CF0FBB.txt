I may have wasted the years
And swallowed my tears, I ride the circle of pain
I live in the warmth of my fears
Drowning my flesh with my poisonous veins

Feel my thoughts, feel my heart and my soul
With sinless eyes, watch as I die

Lost in a world of despair
Itinerant along mortals path
But where ever I roam
My heart will still go on

Swept away with the mortal tide
Along the holes in your soul
The son that so faithfully died
Left scars, the seed of failure

Feel my thoughts, feel my heart and my soul
With sinless eyes, watch as I die

Views from sinless eyes staring at sinful lives
Judging by fate, you are cheating my hate

As I die in emptiness
I leave my sorrows behind
I will enter, death's embrace
And into my father's grace
