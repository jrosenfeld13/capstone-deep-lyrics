Stay Calm
This Generation's a nervous one and they kill
All they fear
But they fear it all
So they take the bait
So disappear with me
The Captain has fell asleep hours ago
And they curse his name
Because he fell asleep in the halls of the famed
Wasting time
As our hands move
Across the earth with such finesse
It's all I fear but she gives me rest
Bear with me
Stay with me
Or (stay) afraid
(stay) afraid
(stay) afraid

This is the plague
We have always begged
To see find death

Violence by default
It's the s-s-s-stage we play

Bear with me
This Generation's a nervous one and they fear
They fear
They kill it all so take it back

Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay calm, stay calm
(stay calm)
Stay calm, stay calm
(stay calm)
Stay calm, stay calm
(stay calm)
Stay
(stay calm)

The body's not what we lack
The body's not what we lack
The body's not what we lack
The body's not what we lack
