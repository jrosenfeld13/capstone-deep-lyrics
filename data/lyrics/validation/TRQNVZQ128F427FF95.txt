I ain't falling in love with you tonight
Yes Ma'am, you heard me right
A soft place to fall when it's cold is always nice
But I ain't falling in love with you tonight

How many times have we gone this route?
To be honest I've lost count
I've been thinking and I think I'm drawing the line
I ain't falling in love with you tonight

This old town's been all we've known
Everybody else has all moved on
Let's be honest now, convenience has had its price
I ain't falling in love with you tonight

Well, let's face it we ain't kids no more
Old Father Time's been keeping score
Me and you, we've had ourselves some times
I ain't falling in love with you tonight

Yes, I'll give you a ride home
Yes, I'll walk you to your door
Now finish your beer but get that look out of your eyes
I ain't falling in love with you tonight

Quick now, you go on in
It's cold in this midnight wind
Let's part ways while my resolve is high
I ain't falling in love with you tonight

I know it's late now, pardon the call
But did I leave my coat in your hall?
Well, I'm gonna come look for it right now if that's all right
But I ain't falling in love with you tonight
