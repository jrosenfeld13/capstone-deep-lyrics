Girl, you're putting me through hell
'Cause it's so hard for me to tell
If you're falling for this spell I'm casting

Girl, you have got to see
That you and I were meant to be
Surely, you can see why the hell I'm asking

Do you want it?

Girl, you were my dance floor lover last night
Then I turned around and you were out of sight
I don't mean that you were looking alright (even though you were)
I mean that literally, I did not see you

Tell me what you are trying to prove
I can't believe you are resisting my moves
Come on, girl, let me put my tongue in your groove
And be your lover under the covers (in the bedroom)

Do you want it?
Oh yeah
Do you want it?
Oh yeah
Do you want it?
Oh yeah
The sex I mean
No
