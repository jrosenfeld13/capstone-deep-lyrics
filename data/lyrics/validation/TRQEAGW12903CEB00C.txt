I went out jumping fences
So that I could test the symmetry
Feeling not unlike the boy who climbed the stairs
To someone-else's birthday party

What you doing with him?
And what you doing with the lights out?

So I went down into the town
In order to explore the city centre
And I found this guy who tried to tie
The two cathedrals together

He tied them spire to spire
The pigeon balanced on the wire

I whooped (woo!)
And I shouted (yo ho ho!)
To celebrate the sunrise
Of the city I had doubted
Something made me think of you
How I ducked out of your future
To realign my fortune

I asked for a second chance
Had to go back to my hometown to try and catch my balance
I asked of your plans next year
Thinking things would be more simple without you living here

Give me balance and symmetry
