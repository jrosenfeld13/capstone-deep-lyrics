I hope I live to see the day
That the world forgives me
You can't pretend that you're OK
With an open bottle of pills and fame

The people that can't stand you
Only win if you hate them too
I'm the king of mystery
You're Up against me

Up against me tearing harder from inside the crowd
Up against me now

I hope I live before I die
No giving up before I try
