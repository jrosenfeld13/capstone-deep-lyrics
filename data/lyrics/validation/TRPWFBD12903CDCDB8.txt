My enemies turn back, they
Stumble and perish before you
For you have upheld my right and my cause
You have sat on your throne judging righteously
You have rebuked the nations
And destroyed the wicked
You bottled out their name forever
Endless ruin has overtaken the enemy
You have uprooted their cities
Even the memory of them has perished
The Lord reigns forever
