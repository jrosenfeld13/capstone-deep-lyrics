Someti-imes in the mor-ornin'
When shadows are deep
I lie here beside you
Just watching you sleep
And sometimes I whisper
What I'm thinking of
My cup runneth o-over
With love...

Someti-imes in the evenin'
When you do not see
I study the small things
You do constantly
I memorise moments
That I'm fondest of
My cup runneth o-over
With love...

In only a moment
We both will be old
We won't even notice
The world turning cold
And so, in this moment
With sunlight above
My cup runneth o-over
With love...
With love...
With love...
With lo-ove...
