Words trip from my tongue
Saying, "be strong, always be strong"
Scenes flash past my eyes
Telling me here is where I belong

And if you believe what I believe
Then we're home, yeah, we're home

I should have seen it coming
I could have worked it out
Your feminine mentality
Reveals the things I cannot see
I should have seen it coming
I could have worked it out
The danger signs have left my mind
It's way beyond a shadow of a doubt

So it won't be long
Stay with me now, this can't be wrong
It's our right to fly to the stars
Just for one night this world is ours

And if you believe what I believe
Then we're home, yeah, we're home

I should have seen it coming
I could have worked it out
Your feminine mentality
Reveals the things I could not see
I should have seen it coming
I could have worked it out
The danger signs have left my mind
It's way beyond a shadow of a doubt

I should have seen it coming
I could have worked it out
Your feminine mentality
Reveals the things I cannot see
I should have seen it coming
I could have worked it out
The danger signs have left my mind
It's way beyond a shadow of a doubt

I should have seen it coming
And I could have worked it out
Your feminine mentality
Reveals the things I could not see
I should have seen it coming
I could have worked it out
The danger signs have left my mind
It's way beyond a shadow of a doubt
