I feel the need to be naked with you
(the need to be naked with you)
I feel the need to be naked with you
(the need to be naked with you)

Who can explain the forces of nature
Why do opposites attract?
Aren't we just animals after all?
At night when sky is black
I want you so bad it's the craziest feeling i ever had

(chorus)
I feel the need to be naked with you
(the need to be naked with you)
I feel the need to be naked with you
(the need to be naked with you)
Take off my pants
My shirt*
My socks and my shoes
I need to be naked with you
(i need to be naked with you)

If you dont want me i'll be devastated
I'm so much in love with you
Waiting not knowing, baby i hid it
Tell me what you want me to
I want you so much that i live and i breathe only for your touch

(chorus)
All these clothe just come between us
Lets go where no one can see us
My skin, my lips, need to meet your fingertips

(chorus)
