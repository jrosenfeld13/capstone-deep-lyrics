(I touch the world as never seen before)

As the light goes down and the curtain falls
I make my way back to the catacombs and call
Go to the motions until they grate
How I long to be back in that place
If only for another moon, another sun, another play

As the hum dies down and the pieces fall
I realize there's nothing left for me at all
How I long to be back in that place
If only for another moon, another sun, another play

But it's not to be

(As much as I'd like to
Get it all out and let the credits roll
I can't shake my persona, I can't let it go)

Oh, I would give up everything that I know just to belong
How I long
How I long to be back in that place if only for another moon
Another sun, another day
That doesn't seem to feel like a waste
