[Intro:]
It's your birthday
You don't have to do nothing

[Verse: Kelly]
The time has come and its finally here
Have a candle lit dinner
Or just settle down, my dear
Whatever you like, boy
Its all up to you
We could celebrate, baby
'Cause-

[Refrain:]
It's your birthday

[Verse: Beyonce]
Now close your eyes, baby
And listen to the melody
Anything you want, my sweet
Just ask me
It's the day for us to share
So leave your problems up to me
Let's start you and me
And make this day history

[Chorus:]
It's your birthday (we could spend time together)
We gon' celebrate (you and me)
It's your birthday (so baby blow out the candles)
We gon' celebrate (you know)
It's your birthday

[Verse: Kelly]
I'm sending out invitations
To let all your friends know that (it's your birthday)
But all that I really wanna do
Is wrap you up and get in the groove
And keep you all to myself

[Verse: Beyonce]
Now the mood is right now
And you don't have to fantasize
All your dreams could come true
But it's up to you
If you can't decide, boy
Just give me all your mind
(I've got a surprise)
A present that you'll like

[Chorus and Refrain Mixed While:]

We're gonna celebrate this evening
So blow out the candles, cause

[Chorus and Refrain Mixed:]

[Break: LaTavia:]
Happy Birthday, baby

[Chorus:]
It's your birthday together
We gon' celebrate
It's your birthday
We gon' celebrate
It's your birthday
