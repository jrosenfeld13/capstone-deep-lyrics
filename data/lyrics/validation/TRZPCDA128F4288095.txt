Gotta stop now, ya get me so down
This feeling still in everyone
It's cheating ourself, gotta stop now
When you do it all this way
I've always said it's easy that way
It's easy to manipulate
And take me to war
Squirrel it away when you wake up cold and alive
You go

Butt out
Thought I had it down now
This is what I asked for
Get out
Go out
Get down now
But I'm not you so let it go

I hurried again to see if you grin
A second look is all I ask for
Nothing's wrong, when nothing's so bad
This offence is all you live for
You're so down, you make me slow down
When I forgot you're just that way
You thought you're so bad, turn me away
I know why cuz when they wanted pictures of you
Guy in his van, took you to hell and was all the rage and
I was let down, cuz people go down
Feel myself for more of the same
And now

Butt out
Thought I had it down now
This is what I asked for
Get out
Go out
Get down now
But I'm not you so let it go

Butt out
Thought I had it down now
This is what I asked for
Get out
Go out
Get down now
But I'm not you so let it go

And I waited till today to tell you gather round to get it all
And I waited so alone with nothin you get by with nothin
And I waited till tonight to tell you gather around to get more
And I waited so alone with nothin you get by with nothin

And I waited till tonight to tell you gather round to get it all
And I waited so alone with nothin you get by with nothin
And I waited all alone to tell you gather around to get more
And I waited till so alone with nothin you get by with nothin
