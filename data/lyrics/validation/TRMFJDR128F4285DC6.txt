We purge your words of wisdom
With darkness at our side
Burning down your kingdom
To honour those who died

We never remain silent
When we're ordered to
We'll always be outspoken
In everything we do

With a thousand voices
We cry out our tears
Our solitude and anger
Our hopes and fears

Our open hearts bear wisdom
For everyone to see
To be a guiding light
For those in misery

We will wage this war forever
On each and every battleground
With every word and song
With every move and sound

For a thousand years from now
Our souls will echo on
In your hearts and minds
Although we are gone
