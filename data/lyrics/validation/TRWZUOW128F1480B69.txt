Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Memories, sweet memories
Lost in these memories
Lost I should stay

Days, brilliant days
Love filled these brilliant days
These days are foregone
Alone, alone I pray

Love that was wonderful
Love nobody knows
My head it cries from wall to wall
My heart will scream down down I fall

My heart, down I fall, down I fall
