Can you tell me where you are?
I'm searching you, but I can't find you - nowhere
When I look up to the sky
The moon is telling me
One day you will be mine

So just send me, a heavenly sign of love
No don't worry, I'll receive it from above
You just send me, you're heavenly sign of love
I wait all over, till you be my prince of love
