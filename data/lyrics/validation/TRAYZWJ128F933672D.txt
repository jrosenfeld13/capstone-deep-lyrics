Morning light
Silken dream to flight
As the darkness gave way to dawn
You've survived
Now your moment has arrived
Now your dream has finally been born

Black Butterfly
Sailed across the waters
Tell your sons and daughters
What the struggle brings
Black Butterfly
Set the skies on fire
Rise up even higher
So the ageless winds of time can catch your wings

Ooh...ooh

While you slept
The promise was unkept
But your faith was as sure as the stars
Now you're free
And the world has come to see
Just how proud and beautiful you are

Black Butterfly
Sailed across the waters
Tell your sons and daughters
What the struggle brings
Black Butterfly
Set the skies on fire
Rise up even higher
So the ageless winds of time can catch your wings

Let the current lift your heart
And send it soaring
Write the timeless message clear across the sky
So that all of can read it
And remember when we need it
That a dream conceived in truth can never die
Butterfly

Cause now that you're free
And the world has come to see
Just how proud and beautiful you are

Black Butterfly
Sailed across the waters
Tell your sons and daughters
What the struggle brings
Black Butterfly
Set the skies on fire
Rise up even higher
So the ageless winds of time can catch your wings

Fly
Butterfly
Yeah, yeah, yes
Fly
