So close to
No one that
You care for
Cuz you dont care
It's not worth it
You can't think straight
So take your pill
And stop whining

So close your eyes
And think of your life
Behind the wall
Of innocence lost
Think of family
And think of your friends
Think of memories
These thoughts will be gone when you're dead
... dead

Always feel
Discomfort
Always feel alone well who cares about it
Can't find one
Good reason
To stay here
So stop whining

So close your eyes
And think of your life
Behind the wall
Of innocence lost
Think of family
And think of your friends
Think of memories
These thoughts will be gone

If you really did want to end your life
You'd be gone by now

It's just a cop out you can't pull through
You don't know what to do

You analyze it
But you can't see straight
You dont know what to think
Don't blame your shit on me
It's getting older as days
Just keep on passing by
Leave me alone

So close your eyes
And think of your life
Behind the wall
Of innocence lost
Think of family
And think of your friends
Think of memories
These thoughts will be gone when you're dead
... dead
