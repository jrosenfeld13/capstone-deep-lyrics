[King Kobra / H. Banger / Proffer]

Full moon in July
As I remember, it was an ordinary night
Feelin' good and ridin' high
I saw you dancin' in the spotlight
It was then I lost my self control
You stole my soul from me

[Chorus:]
I'm flirting with temptation
Coming close to complication now
Dancing with desire
You practice sweet seduction
And I'll follow your instruction now
Hangin' on the wire
Dancing with desire

I make my own rules
No chains on me, independence is my style
But tonight I'll be your fool
And any fool could see why
Cause when you come on like the demon wind
I've got to begin, with you

[Chorus]
[Solo]

Cause when you come on like the demon wind
I have got to, got to begin, with you

[Chorus]
