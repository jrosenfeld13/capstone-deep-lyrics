Well I've been saving for a custom van
And I've been playing in a cover band
And my baby doesn't understand
Why I never turned from boy to man

I got it made
I got it down
I am the king
Of this island town
I'm on my own
I'm my way

Down Utopia
Utopia Parkway

And while I'm waiting for my time to come (waiting for my time to come)
I'm gonna get a little shopping done (get a little shopping done)
I'll get some paper and a staple gun (staple gun)
And put my name in front of everyone

I got it made
I got it down
I am the king
Of this God damn town
I'm on my own
I'm my way

Down Utopia
Utopia Parkway

Gonna let my hair grow down my back
Gonna brace myself for the big attack
And they'll never know what hit them when it comes
