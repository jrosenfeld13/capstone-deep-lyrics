East of the sun and west of the moon
We'll build a dream house of love dear
Near to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night
We'll live in a heavenly way dear
Living and loving in pale moonlight

Just you and I, forever and a day
Love will not die; we'll keep it that way
Up above the stars we'll find a harmony of life to a lovely tune
East of the sun and west of the moon dear
East of the sun and west of the moon

East of the sun and west of the moon
We'll build a dream house of love dear
Near to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night
We'll live in a heavenly way dear
Living and loving in pale moonlight

Just you and I, forever and a day
Love will not die; we'll keep it that way
Up above the stars we'll find a harmony of life to a lovely tune
East of the sun and west of the moon dear
East of the sun and west of the moon
West of the moon
Of the moon
