In a back-street club in town he goes to taste desire
Waiting for the meat, the lust burns in him like fire
Flames flicker in those empty eyes
Lips twisted with a sensual smile
Promising you a real good time if you'll join him for a while

Condemned by innocence
Wipe away those tears, he'll chase you forever (2x)
If you dare escape

Thrill Thrill Thrill Killer An agonizing way to be
Thrill Thrill Thrill Killer Enter in and you will see

He says that his mother never showed him love
And no one there to hold him in the dead of night
The only love he feels is pain that he suffers
The only truth he knows is lies, damned lies!

Thrill Thrill Thrill Killer An agonizing way to be
Thrill Thrill Thrill Killer Enter in and you will see
Thrill Thrill Thrill Killer If you wanna stay alive
Thrill Thrill Thrill Killer Have an instinct to survive

Condemned by innocence Wipe away those tears, he'll chase you forever (2x)
If you dare escape, he'll chase you forever

In a back-street club in town he goes to taste desire
Waiting for the meat, the lust burns in him like fire
Flames flicker in those empty eyes
Lips twisted with a sensual smile
Promising you a real good time if you'll join him for a while
She could be his meat if she did not know his face
I sit watching him looking for some new bait
Reflections in the mirror, eye contact
Worried that she's gonna be attacked
She smiles with anger in her eyes And kisses his disguise

Condemned by innocence Wipe away those tears, he'll chase you forever (2x) If you dare escape

Condemned by innocence Wipe away those tears, he'll chase you forever (2x) If you dare escape, he'll chase you forever
