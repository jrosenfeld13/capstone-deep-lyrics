Everywhere I go
I take a little piece of you
I collect, I reject
Photographs I took of you

Towns that I passed through
Ive got to have a memory
Or I have never been there
I have never had you, I have never had you (had you, had you)

I cant remember
Give me a reminder
I collect, I reject
Memorabilia
Memorabilia

I like little bits of glassware
Ashtrays with inscriptions
Plastic things on pencils
Bits of mass production
Postcards, pretty pictures
Little bits of plastic
Covering up the bedroom
To show you Ive been there
To show you Ive been there

Keychains and snowstorms
Keychains and snowstorms
Give me a reminder, give me a reminder
Give me a reminder, give me a reminder(I collect, I reject)
Memorabilia(Keychains and snowstorms)

I cant remember, give me a reminder
I collect, I reject(I cant remember, give me a reminder)

Photographs I took of you
Towns that I passed through
Ive got to have a memory
Or I have never been there
I have never had you, I have never had you (had you, had you)
I cant remember
Give me a reminder
I collect, I reject

Castanets, mantillas
Torremolinos
Castanets and plastic men

I collect, I reject
