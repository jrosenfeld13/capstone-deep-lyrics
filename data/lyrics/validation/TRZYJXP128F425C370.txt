Please come walk with me
And we will walk forever
Come and touch my skin
You control my shiver

Feel Sunny Day
Believe your time has come today
Throw in your prime
And know its here
To Stay

I have seen days
When your smile goes on forever
You light up the room
In the deepest darkest weather

Feel Sunny Day
Believe your time has come today
Throw in your prime
And know its here
To Stay

Be free to see
Your smile soft sway
Im sure you want this day

Believe your time has come today
Throw in your prime
And know its here
To Stay

Be free to see
Your smile soft sway
Im sure you want this day
