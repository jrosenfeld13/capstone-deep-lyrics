We all know she's not alone
That doesn't mean she's not lonely
We said goodbye I felt sick inside
Leaning on a rail I watched her as she shied away

To our passion her defences held no ground
But by the light of morning kisses
I could see her face turn down
Love ain't what you're used to when you're used to being alone
The curtain is parted
You see that your emotions have grown away

Turn it around what could it be?
She lifts her eyes and smiles at me
Tasting the moment I say, could we just
Take a walk
Out through the yard
And wander through the trees
Sometime
Just you and me
Sometime

Wander through the trees
Sometime
Just you and me
Sometime soon
