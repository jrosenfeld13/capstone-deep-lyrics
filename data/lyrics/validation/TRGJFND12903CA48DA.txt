Verse 1:
Yo, good over evil
Me tell dem sey i neva go deh
Man have right, mi tell dem seh a jah in flesh
Black people, babylon unnu done haffi left
Dem talk yah have di whole dem a fret

Chorus:
I swear, that i will never switch
I swear, i keep on giving u songs like this
I swear, that i will never hitch
To defend poor people,one a mi greatest wish

Verse 2:
Yo give i strengh to jah, so i could go through
Never praise no one, like i praise you
You put the strengh in me
I got the faith in you
Anything dem it out, it will get
Gimmie some space, gimmie some room
Let my people come through
Nuff a pretender, nuff a dem is not true
Where were they, when friends we view
Rasta far i died over you

Chorus

Verse 3:
I see the wicked, dem watching and dem peeking
Turn off the pipe, cas the water is leaking
Theres no time for us to get weaking
Rasta far i loving will be seeking
Yu see a babylon flesh dem seeking
From jah jah pickney yu bown to get beating
To the, dem will be reaching
Mad people, need to be feeding
