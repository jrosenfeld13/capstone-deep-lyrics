Like a frozen daughter
To a man who likes to say
You were no good, no
With your blue eyes staring
In a distant far from life
You will loose it, loose it now

Could we save your life this time?
I could hold your hand tight
Rescue the life we had
Would you run from me this time?
Even if I loved you?
Leaving it all behind?

Come talk to me (talk to me, talk to me)
Come talk to me
Come talk to me (talk to me, talk to me)
Come talk to me (talk to me, talk to me)
In the air a thousand
At least a thousand feet up high
Come talk to me (talk to me, talk to me)
I face this
Come talk to me (talk to me, talk to me)
We will never follow
We will never see what love is
Come talk to me (talk to me, talk to me)
I'll leave this, we will die

Come talk to me (talk to me, talk to me)
Can I feel you up this time?
I could eat your heart out
Eat you like you ate me
Can you stay still here one time?
Even if I forced you?
See if my eyes can bleed

Come talk to me (talk to me, talk to me)
Come talk to me
Come talk to me (talk to me, talk to me)
Come talk to me (talk to me, talk to me)
Come talk to me (talk to me, talk to me)
Come talk to me (talk to me, talk to me)
