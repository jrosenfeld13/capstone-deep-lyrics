Ohhhh, Mmmmm, Mmm

So many words i'd like to say to you
So many things i'd like to do for you
I count the seconds till your back by my side
The flame only burns when you're here in my life
You're the only one for me

Please tell me how i'll ever get over you
Though i know you're gone can't believe that it's true
Please tell me how to ever stop wanting you
(With every beat of my heart)
With every beat of my heart
I'll be waiting for you

Time after time, my every thought is you
Day after day, i wanna be with you
Open your heart and i'm sure that you'll see
No words can express what you mean to me
Baby you're my destiny

Please tell me how i'll ever get over you
Though i know you're gone can't believe that it's true
Please tell me how to ever stop wanting you
(With every beat of my heart)
With every beat of my heart
I'll be waiting for you

Waiting for the day when you come back in my life
I'm waiting for the day when all that's wrong is right
And i'm praying for the a time when you are here in my arms
Hold you tight all day and all night

Please tell me how i'll ever get over you
Though i know you're gone can't believe that it's true
Please tell me how to ever stop wanting you
(With every beat of my heart)
With every beat of my heart
I'll be waiting for you

Please tell me how i'll ever get over you
Though i know you're gone can't believe that it's true
Please tell me how to ever stop wanting you
(With every beat of my heart)
With every beat of my heart
I'll be waiting for you

Oh Yeah
Though i know you're gone can't believe that it's true

Oh Yeah
Every beat of my heart
I'll be waiting for you

Please tell me how i'll ever get over you
