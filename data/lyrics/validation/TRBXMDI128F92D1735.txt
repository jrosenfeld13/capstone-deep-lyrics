There used to be time in my life when we were lovers
And we shared this apartment together just us two
I think of how we planned to get married
Saying Love how I used to know you well
Whoa Oh I can't stand this living all alone
Whoa Oh I can't stand this living all alone
Oh No No No Whoa

Now I live a single life and I find it's another world
I'm not even the same I'm a different girl
Yesterday I was somebody's baby
Now today I'm a woman on my own
Whoa Oh I can't stand this living all alone
Whoa Oh I can't stand this living all alone

It feels good to have somebody hold you tight
It feels good to have somebody love you right
Who would end all my long and lonely nights?
Whoa Oh I can't stand this living all alone
Whoa Oh I can't stand this living all alone
Whoa Oh I can't stand this living all, oouuu all alone

Oh, I don't want to be alone
Oh weeee aaaaaa
Oh I don't want to be alone
We used to be such lovers
We used to care for one another
Aaaaaaaa aaaa aaaa aaaa
I don't want to be, I don't want to be alone
No no, No no
No Oooooooooo No
I don't want to be alone
No No No
Need ya, Love ya
Come back to me oooohhhh
I love you
Oh please, please come back to me baby
Ooooouuu Yeah
I can't stand to be alone
I can't stand it
Don't want to be alone
