I woke up this morning, my baby was gone
Woke up this morning, my baby was gone
I've feel so bad, I'm all alone

I ain't got nobody, stayn' home with me
I ain't got nobody, stayn' home with me
My baby she's gone, I'm in misery

Well baby, I'm all alone
Yes baby, I'm all alone
I ain't had no lovin', since my baby's been gone
All right

Oh baby, I'm all alone
Oh baby, I'm all alone
My baby she's gone, I'm in misery

Oh baby, come on stay with me
Oh baby, come on stay with me
My baby she's gone, I'm in misery

Oh baby, I'm all alone
Oh baby, I'm all alone
I ain't had no lovin', since my baby's been gone
