[Verse 1]
I am driving in my car up highway one
I left LA without telling anyone
There were people who needed something from me
But I am sure theyll get along fine on their own

[Chorus]
Oh this state of ecstasy
Nothing but road could ever give to me
This liberty wind in my face
And Im giggling again for no reason

[Verse 2]
I am dancing with my friends in elation
Weve taken adventures to new levels of fun
I can feel the bones are smiling in my body
I can see the meltings of inhibition

[Chorus]
Oh this state of ecstasy
Nothing but road could ever give to me
This liberty wind in my face
And Im giggling again for no reason

[Verse 3]
Im reeling jubilation
Triumphant in delight
I am at home in this high five
And Im smiling for no reason
I am sitting at the set of cali sun
Weve gotten quiet for its last precious seconds
I can feel the salt of the sea on my skin
And we still hear the echoes of abandon

[Chorus]
Oh this state of ecstasy
Nothing but road could ever give to me
This liberty wind in my face
And Im giggling again for no reason
