Ugh
Flow gifted like the honor roll
In crunch time I deliver like dominoes
A different freak for every day I got all kinda hoes
I slide 'em dick and get the f*** I never mind them hoes
But never mind them hoes
I got all kinda flows
I switch 'em up so quick as f*** I gotta timeless flow
Young animal
Punishin' the Pro Tools
Eatin' this beat up like soul food you n****s old news

Now ain't you tired of sayin' the same s*** everyday
I mean the same s*** Ashley n' Mary Kate
Sometimes I wish that I was blind like Mr. Ray
How come you talkin' out yo a** but ain't got s*** to say
I spend my money like my time I ain't got it to waste
Man I'm so fast feel like I'm racin' in a different race
Too much champagne now watch me spit it in them b****es face
Tomorrow mornin' I cud tell you how them b****es taste

This rap s*** is our house you n****s just visitin'
Young money wolverines b**** no (Michigan)
I get in them hoes and reel' em in like fishermen
And throw they a** in the truck and we rose like Michelins
All hail the kings, crowns glistenin'
I stunt hard as I f*** cause I ain't gettin' a chance to live again
Focused is what you better get boy we on that better s***
All bosses no executives you just repetitive

Now ain't you tired of sayin' the same s*** everyday
I mean the same s*** Ashley n' Mary Kate
Sometimes I wish that I was blind like Mr. Ray
How come you talkin' out yo a** but ain't got s*** to say
I spend my money like my time I ain't got it to waste
Man I'm so fast feel like I'm racin' in a different race
Too much champagne now watch me spit it in them b****es face
Tomorrow mornin' I cud tell you how them b****es taste

B**** we ballin'
Tired of da same s***
I need a different toilet
OK lemme pick my target
Pick 'em off now come pick 'em up
Big dog I don't bark I buck
Tell dem b****es I don't talk I f***
Tell dem n****s I don't walk I run dis s***
I come to punish s***
And I bet they won't be flushin' dis young money s***
We on sum otha' s***
They on the same s***
B**** I'm Mack Maine, I'm Mack Maine b****!

Now ain't you tired of sayin' the same s*** everyday
I mean the same s*** Ashley n' Mary Kate
Sometimes I wish that I go blind like Mr. ray
How come you talkin' out yo a** n' ain't got s*** to say
Young tune motherf***er no anime
Doctor carter motherf***er come to amputate
Cash money too much money to calculate
Young money that new s*** in ya face
I spend my money like my time I ain't got it to waste
Man I'm so fast feel like I'm racin' in a different race
Too much champagne now watch me spit it in them b****es face
Tomorrow mornin' I cud tell you how them b****es taste
Gimme the beat n' I'm a beat the beat like anime
What the f*** you thought you know I keep the heat like Saint-Tropez
Cash money too much money to calculate
Young money that new s*** on ya face
