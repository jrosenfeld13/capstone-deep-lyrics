The believers are naive
Faith will only lead you astray
Standing on the brink of total destruction
With failure at our side and disappointment in our looks
The coffin nailed shut
Now you must think of all you've taken for granted
And what you'll miss when your heart stops
Now you're the victim
Writing your own obituary
Scarred for your trespass
The bullets that you've dodged all these years
Are turning and coming your way
In this the age of the weak and vulnerable
We stand for the always reckless
Cursed by fate
Guided by misfortune
And well act without hesitation
To black the eyes of faith
Driven by disgust and resentment
Because we're always
Cursed by fate
Guided by misfortune
