Promise that you always will
Candle lit on a window sill
You know I'll be comin home

You know I never wanted to go away
What am I supposed to say
When I hear the sounds of the trumpets call?
Who says...

All is -(All is)- Fair in -(Fair in)-
All is fair in love and war
All is -(All is)- Fair in -(Fair in)-
All is fair in love and war

I have your pictures kept close to my heart
Letters all but fall apart
Each night I read them over again

You know I never wanted to go away
What am I supposed to say
When I hear the sounds of the trumpets call?
Who says...

All is -(All is)- Fair in -(Fair in)-
All is fair in love and war
All is -(All is)- Fair in -(Fair in)-
All is fair in love and war
No, I never wanted to go away
I swear, I swear... It's war

All is fair in love and war...
All is fair in love and war...
All is -(All is)- Fair in -(Fair in)-
All is fair in love and war
All is -(All is)- Fair in -(Fair in)-
All is fair in love and war

All is fair, all is fair
All is fair in love and war
All is fair, all is fair
All is fair in love and war
