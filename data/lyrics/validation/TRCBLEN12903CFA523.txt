I am, I am, what I am, what I am, what I am, what I am, I'll be, I'll be
I am, I am, what I am, what I am, for the rights, for the rights, of man, hey

People have the right to be just who they are
People have the right to share all of their love
People have the right to share just what they give
The right to their free will

I did not choose the way I am, I did not choose the way I am
I said I am what I am, This is my fellow man
I did not choose the way I a-a-am, I did not choose the way I am
I said I am what I a-a-am, Please try to understand
I did not choose the way I a-a-am, I did not choose the way I am
I said I am what I a-a-am, I am just a man

I am, I am, what I am, what I am, for the rights, for the rights, of man, listen here

People have the right, regardless of their skin
People have the right to let God's love come in
People have the right to truly be yourfriend
To love is not a sin
