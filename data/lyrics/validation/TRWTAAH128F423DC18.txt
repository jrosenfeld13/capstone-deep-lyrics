[Verse 1]
They saw you today as you were leaving
And they run to hunt you down
Dogs lead the chase as you are bleeding
They run to hunt you down

[Chorus]
Your narrow escape
Has wiped the smile right from your face
Those starved dogs howling
Run to hunt you down

[Verse 2]
You smile as you look in the mirror
Tears have left your eyes
Your face has a different exterior
Permanent disguise

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I said run just to hunt you down
Right now, right now, right now, right now
