She was the sunlight, I was the storm
We lit up the sky above
She set me on fire, like no woman born
Blinded me with her love

We were inseparable, joined at the heart
Taking on the world, racing with the dark

Then suddenly
She vanished in the night
Without a trace

She's gone (she left with the song)
And all the love, I counted on
She's gone, and heaven is hiding their angels
She was my angel
And she's gone

Sometimes the rain clouds cover the sun
And block out the light of day
All of the music, all of the joy
Is missing along the way

Where does the feeling go when it is gone
What changed to make the difference, how could it all
Go wrong

When suddenly
She vanished in the night
Without a trace

She's gone (she left with the song)
And all the love, I counted on
She's gone, and heaven is hiding their angels
She was my angel
And she's gone

Is she wearing that sundress that goes with her eyes
Is she starting to undress to rest for the night
I still love her, I still need her
I'll be watching and waiting the rest of my life

She's gone
And all the love, I counted on
She's gone, and heaven is hiding their angels
She's gone
And all the love, I counted on
She's gone, and heaven is hiding their angels
She was my angel
And she's gone

She's gone
