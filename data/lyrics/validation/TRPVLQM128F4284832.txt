Chorus:
There's a weight over me today
Something I have to say
Love you too much to leave
Don't like you enough to stay

My heads in a mess and I'm stressed
But I guess it's a test
In the quest for happiness
And the rest of that mess
So I best just acquiesce
Even though I've grown tired of you

And that ain't meant to sound spiteful
I just try to be insightful
When I write all my emotions
In the night all the stuff I try to fight
Will just come out and the sad fact is I'm so tired of you

Love, it's a weird thing ain't it?
There's no way to explain it
But I swear as well as pain
There should be joy but we sustain
The same level of mundane
And it's numbing me through

I often wonder if I'd miss you
And have the urge to kiss you
If an issue was to hit through
To this heart that now feels disused
And said issue was too big to just ignore
And I walked out on you

The chances are I'd fall apart
And suffer seizures of the heart
As my chest begins to smart
The very second have to part
I want to go back to the start
But then again maybe I just feel new
Maybe I'd get my life on track
And start to focus my attack
On all the things my life just lacks
And start to claw my passion back
Instead of living like a hack
Half committed half relaxed
I'd have nothing to lose

Chorus (x2)

I guess lately I've had too much time to think
And yeah way too much drink
When paper meets the ink
Over-thinking is the chink in my armour
That's just what I do
And I've always been that way
Forever questioning each day
And every plea that's made
That maybe when I lay
My busy mind will make me prove
By finding problems and reasons
That might not even be true

See we got together so young
Before our real lives had begun
But flowers don't grow up as one
Each finds its own route to the sun
And that's exactly what we've done
We've grown up separately too
And for a few years now it's been the problem
And these realisations, I wish that I could stop them
But I've realised that love is all we have in common
And deep down you know that's true

But then surely that I'm still in love with you
Means there's something we can do
To get us through and to pursue
A brand new point of view
On how this gap grew, between me and you

So there's a weight over me and I'd hate to have to leave
But in fate I don't believe and the state of you and me
Isn't great as you can see
So I'll keep thinking this through

Chorus (x3)
