There's a woman that you ought to know
And she's coming, singing soft and low
Singing rock and roll, she's a joy to know

'Neath the shadow of a soothing hand
I am free there, just to make my plans
Dream of faraway lands, anything close at hand

And she will follow me why, do you know
Familiar places she's been by, that I know
Could it be, she don't have to try

And tomorrow, she's a friend of mine
And the sorrow, I see her face is lined
She's no longer blind, she's just hard to find
