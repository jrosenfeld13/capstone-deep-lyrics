The clan is marching up and down the street
Speaking out from under a sheet
They say they're saving their neighborhood
They really believe they're doing good

Are they working harder at what we think is
Wrong
Than we are at what we know is right

Beastie Boys got a number one
They just say it's harmless fun
And while they're rapping to the bank
Dissension runs through the family ranks

Are they working harder at what we think is
Wrong
Than we are at what we know is right
Sold out  they might be sold out to sin
Sold out  gotta take a look inside what do
You see
Are you and me... more sold out to Him

Met a devil woman just the other day
"divide the home" is what she prayed
Even read the Bible in front of me
Said "you got to know your enemy"
Are we gonna sit back and let them take
Control
When we've got His power in our soul

Sold out  they might be sold out to sin
Sold out  gotta take a look inside what do
You see
Are you and me... more sold out to Him

We're not gonna sit back and let them take
Control
When we've got His power in our soul
