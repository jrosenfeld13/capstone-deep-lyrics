I sit and watch you sleep, as you dream your dangerous dreams
I feel the healing heat, as the inner voices scream

Your pain is mine, my blood is yours, I feel so helpless just watching you

This is the power over me, I'm rendered helpless, you've got me on my knees
You have the power over me, nothing is certain, I wait for recovery

They say it's always the same, two steps forward one step back
Whatever he arranges, we must do the best we can

Your pain is mine, my blood is yours, can you hear me, I'm calling you

You have the power over me, I'm rendered helpless, you've got me on my knees
You have the power over me, nothing is certain, I wait for recovery

I'm prayin' on my knees

(Solo)

You have the power over me, I'm rendered helpless, you've got me on my knees
You have the power over me, nothing is certain, I wait for recovery
Look at the power over me, I'm rendered helpless, you've got me on my knees
