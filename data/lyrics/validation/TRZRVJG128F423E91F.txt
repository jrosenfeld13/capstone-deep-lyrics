[Verse 1]
Trouble is her only friend and he's back again
Makes her body older than it really is
She says it's high time she went away
No one's got much to say in this town
Trouble is the only way is down
Down, down

[Chorus]
As strong as you were, tender you go
I'm watching you breathing for the last time
A song for your heart, but when it is quiet
I know what it means and I'll carry you home
I'll carry you home

[Verse 2]
If she had wings she would fly away
And another day God will give her some
Trouble is the only way is down
Down, down

[Chorus]
As strong as you were, tender you go
I'm watching you breathing for the last time
A song for your heart, but when it is quiet
I know what it means and I'll carry you home
I'll carry you home

[Verse 3]
And they were all born pretty in New York City tonight
And someone's little girl was taken from the world tonight
Under the Stars and Stripes

[Chorus]
As strong as you were, tender you go
I'm watching you breathing for the last time
A song for your heart, but when it is quiet
I know what it means and I'll carry you home
I'll carry you home
