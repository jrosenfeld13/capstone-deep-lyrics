[Intro]
Rock!

[Verse 1]
She works at Hot Topic
His heart: microscopic
She thinks that it's love
But to him, it's sex
He listens to emo
But Fat Mike's his hero
His bank account's zero
What comes next?

[Pre-Chorus]
Same song; different Chorus

[Chorus]
It's stupid, contagious
To be broke and famous
Can someone please save us
From Punk Rock 101?
My Dickies, your sweatpants
My spiked hair, your new Vans
Let's throw up our rock hands
For Punk Rock 101!

[Verse 2]
She bought him a skateboard
A rail-slide, his knee tore
He traded it for drums at the local pawn shop
She left him for staring
At girls and not caring
When she cried 'cause she thought Bon Jovi broke up

[Pre-Chorus]
Same song; second Chorus

[Chorus]
It's stupid, contagious
To be broke and famous
Can someone please save us
From Punk Rock 101?
My Dickies, your sweatpants
My spiked hair, your new Vans
Let's throw up our rock hands
For Punk Rock 101!

[Bridge]
Don't forget the delay
On the very last word
Seven years later
He works as a waiter
She married a trucker
And he's never there
The story never changes
Just the names and faces
Like Tommy and Gina
They're living on a prayer

(Did you just say that?)
I said it

[Chorus]
It's stupid, contagious
To be broke and famous
Can someone please save us
From Punk Rock 101?
My Dickies, your sweatpants
My spiked hair, your new Vans
Let's throw up our rock hands
For Punk Rock 101!

[Outro]
It's stupid, contagious
To be broke and famous
Can someone please save us
From Punk Rock 101?
My Dickies, your sweatpants
My spiked hair, your new Vans
Let's throw up our rock hands
For Punk Rock 101!
It's stupid, contagious (same song, different chorus)
To be broke and famous
Can someone please save us (same song, different chorus)
From Punk Rock 101?
My Dickies, your rock hands (same song, different chorus)
My spiked hair, your new Vans
Let's shoplift some sweatpants (same song, different chorus)
For Punk Rock 101!
