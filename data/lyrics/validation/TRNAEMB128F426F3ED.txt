[Verse 1]
Dear mother, can you hear me whining?
It's been three whole weeks
Since that I have left your home
This sudden fear has left me trembling
Cause now it seems that I am out here on my own
And I'm feeling so alone

[Chorus]
Pay attention to the cracked streets
And the broken homes
Some call it the slums, some call it nice
I want to take you through a wasteland
I like to call my home
Welcome To Paradise

[Verse 2]
A gunshot rings out at the station
Another urchin snaps and left dead on his own
It makes me wonder why I'm still here
For some strange reason it's now
Feeling like my home
And I'm never gonna go!

[Chorus]
Pay attention to the cracked streets
And the broken homes
Some call it the slums, some call it nice
I want to take you through a wasteland
I like to call my home
Welcome To Paradise

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Dear mother, can you hear me laughing?
It's been 6 whole months since
Since that I have left your home
It makes me wonder why I'm still here
For some strange reason it's now
Feeling like my home
And I'm never gonna go!

[Chorus]
Pay attention to the cracked streets
And the broken homes
Some call it the slums, some call it nice
I want to take you through a wasteland
I like to call my home
Welcome To Paradise
Aw, Paradise
