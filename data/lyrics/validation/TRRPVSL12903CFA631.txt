I'm never satisfied, dirty soul don't clear my eyes
You never lose control, can't pay the toll
You got me in your black claw, think I feel it , don't no more
Break away and taste the pain, shooting an empty vein

You lie - never see it through
Clear my eyes before we lose control
Make me - sick to look at you
Slowly sinking through a big black hole

Jaded dawn and dying sun, burnt out by what I've done
Blind by dirty addiction, going down the deed is done
Feel my dying death wish, wash your face in my abyss
& I don't feel the pain, cutting an empty vein.....

You lie - never see it through

Clear my eyes before we lose control
Make me - sick to look at you
Slowly sinking through a big black hole

Sweat and dreams life laid bare, lick my tears and drink my fear
Can't contain what lies inside, touch my core and lie beside
Clear my eyes and start again, draining my empty vein

Make me - sick to look at you
Slowly sinking through a big black hole
You lie - never see it through
Clear my eyes before we lose control
