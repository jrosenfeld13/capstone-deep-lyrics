[Verse 1]
I need new feet, these are all worn out
I need a new head 'cause I'm all strung out
I pull my hair, I scream and shout to no one
I need to find a way to spend my time
So you're not always on my mind
I talk too fast, I walk the line, I'm frozen

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I'm trying to keep it together
It's not getting better
I'm falling faster, I'm walking on the ashes

[Chorus]
One more time, I'll say goodbye
But I can't move on
I'm going in circles, going down
Take these dreams, 'cause they're killing me
Hanging by a thread
And I don't know how to get unaddicted

[Verse 2]
I need your air, can I breathe you in?
Well you're my light, my prayer, my sin
I'm going down, I'm sinking into nowhere
I'm everything I don't want to be
I waste my nights thinking you're thinking of me
I draw this line, I still unwind, it's poison

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I'm dying, I just need a savior
Chaotic behavior
I'm my own traitor, I'm sinking like a stone

[Chorus]
One more time, I'll say goodbye
But I can't move on
I'm going in circles, going down
Take these dreams, 'cause they're killing me
Hanging by a thread
And I don't know how to get unaddicted

[Bridge]
You're my judge, you're my favorite thing
You're the only song that I wanna sing
Can I be your number one failure?
Your little piece of insane?
Just like a habit that I can't break
Easy to say I learned my mistakes
But I just keep making 'em
Over and over again

[Breakdown]
One more time, I'll say goodbye
But I can't move on
I'm going in circles, going down

[Chorus]
One more time, I'll say goodbye
But I can't move on
I'm going in circles, going down
Take these dreams, 'cause they're killing me
Hanging by a thread
And I don't know how to get unaddicted
