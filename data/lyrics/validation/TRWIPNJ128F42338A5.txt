I was on an all-time low
Didn't know
Couldn't tell why
Until she told me so
With a tender kiss
She made me fly
From the abyss
Now I'm on a high

I'm on a high and I can't stop rolling, my heart is open
Yeah I'm doing it solo
I'm on a high and this is my time, our time, I'm on a high
And I can't stop rolling

Dirty minds
Just entwined
There's lots o' freedom
Down below
We got plans
We got our friends
And lots a of free time
For us to blow
And lots o' of free time
For us to blow
And lots of free time
For us to blow
