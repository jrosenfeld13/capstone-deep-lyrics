Blue hotel
On a lonely highway
Blue hotel
Life don't work out my way

Blue hotel
On a lonely highway
Blue hotel
Life don't work out my way

I wait alone each lonely night

Blue hotel
Blue hotel

Blue hotel
Every room is lonely
Blue hotel
I was waiting only

The night and the life of her lonely dream

Blue hotel
Blue hotel

Blue hotel
On a lonely highway
Blue hotel
Life don't work out my way

I wait alone each lonely night

Blue hotel
