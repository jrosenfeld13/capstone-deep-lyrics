Acid reflux has got me now

It wasn't even my birthday
Acid reflux has got me now

The red sauce to bring me smiles gotta go
The beer that I can chew on gotta go
The spices to tingle my senses gotta go

Who's paying for their sins? me

The vegetables to keep me healthy gotta go
Coffee to keep me movin' gotta go

Paul had his humbler, this is mine
It's a gift in an ugly wrapper
Once again it's preparation
For what? I don't know, something special

Bubbles in my tummy
We need to learn how to chew our food
We need to learn how to take care
Bubbles in the tummy
"And at such a young age"...I've heard
