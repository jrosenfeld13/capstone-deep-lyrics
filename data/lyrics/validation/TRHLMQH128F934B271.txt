Holy Maria, God's delight, destined to bring his only son
But I am the servant of Sodom and I discovered her secret desires
In the dead of the night she slips away, tired of Josef - the miserable fuck
She knows I am always there, so satisfy her needs...

A bastard son will be born, arisen from my demon seed
A divine assasination by Gods guardian angels
But the angels fear to come near, they'd vanish in flames and they know...
Until they hunt me down, I ruin God's master plan

Copulating Maria

She looks at me with her eyes full of desire
I smell the perfume of her flesh as she's undressed
I feel her body tremble as I touch her breasts

Copulating Maria

The silver light shines on her maiden's pride
Under a silver moon , in a silent night
Under a silver moon , Our love never dies

Josef screams in anger when he discovers her being pregnant
How could it happen? I don't know how to fuck!
It's a gift from god, it must be
