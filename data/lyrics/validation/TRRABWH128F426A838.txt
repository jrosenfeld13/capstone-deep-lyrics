Claiming he's an innocent soul
Son of a silent force
Under pressure but all so cold
I better light the torch

Cause he's able to do it again
Degrade and suffocate
Getting the useful support
From his passive friends

How can you just proceed
You little callous fuck
You just walk the streets
Like a not knowing breed

Give me a sign and I'll do just
What I'm thinking right away
How can she ever forget
So suffer and start to regret
It will come around cause you know
That she'll be thinking of you
I feel so powerless
Can't face my hollowness

You've had your time
Gonna walk that line
Like a living travesty
Endlessly bound to your sins

I'll hunt you down in time
You're just a feeble swine
How can I compromise
When all you do is deny

Give me a sign and I'll do just
What I'm thinking right away
How can she ever forget
So suffer and start to regret
It will come around cause you know
That she'll be thinking of you
I feel so powerless
Can't face my hollowness

This pain will last forever
Never growing old
(Never growing old)
Nobody will ever answer
How you can be so cold

Give me a sign and I'll do just
What I'm thinking right away
How can she ever forget
So suffer and start to regret
It will come around cause you know
That she'll be thinking of you
I feel so powerless
Can't face my hollowness
