If I'd been written about since the day that I was born
Every page of the last six months I'd rip them out with scorn
I can't quite remember when this heaven turned to hell
But I think she won on points with the sound of the final bell

Take me, take me back
Take me back in time
To the moment that she asked, "Is it your place or mine?"
Take me, take me back
To the days before the strife
Now I wish we'd never met but that's the story of my life

She's a drama queen. Being late is such a crime
I should really buy a watch but I just can't find the time
Friendship more like ownership has made us friend and foe
Her ayes are now a closing down sale. Everything must go!

Take me, take me back
Take me back in time
To the moment that she asked, "Is it your place or mine?"
Take me, take me back
To the days before the strife
Now I wish we'd never met but that's the story of my life

Watch me, I'm turning back Turned my back at last
I filled the glass to the top but empited it twice as fast
Make me, make me set. Make me set you free
From the old ennui that's know as you and me

Catch me in your arms before I hit the ground
If I get out of this alive I'll nber make another sound

Take me Take me back
To the days before the strife
Now I wish we'd never met but that's the story of my life
