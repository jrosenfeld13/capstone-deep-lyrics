And you wait in your window
For FOUND to come find you...

And you had thoughts that went black
Across the space beween facts
You knew not
Clear into the lap
Of the...
Cancel eye of the map
Maker's stare...

Oneday oldage : Onday might
Oneday oldage : Onday you might...
Divine world map from blank page
To score something so beyond your living cell's scope
With nothing but pushed hope
Perspective and inks
And in the witching seconds of think
Before map's made from scratch, it's heir bringer
Twitches busily on the end of a pen...
It's shape's then, is scrawled certainly across what's blank once
Again...

Cancel-eyed
You...
Hope it -dread it-quote it-edit-
Read it-wroted it-sow it-dead it-
And in sung song cement it

Quite light-like
In the cradle of the cancel eye...

And you are...
Only skull side once
And you'll find..
You wait
And you walk
And you ache and you ought
And you wake and you walk
And you wait...

And you wait by your window
For FOUND to find you...

...this is serious as setting bone setting as serious is this...
