Tell you about this lady

Such tender eyes
Such a sweet believer
The story never lies
When I found you girl
You were so far down
A black cat in disguise

How in the world could it come to this
Couldn't you see that you've gone too far
Saving your soul for that one last kiss
Living your wish upon a star

Chorus:
Madalaine
This is love too tough to tame
Madalaine
Beware of the girl
Beware of the pain

Running scared
Through the dark of the day
The story never dies
But the names keep changin'
And the faces fade
Take you dead or alive

How in the world could it come to this
Couldn't you see that you've gone too far
Saving your soul for that one last kiss
Living your wish upon a star

Chorus:
Madalaine
This is love too tough to tame
Madalaine
Beware of the girl
Beware of the pain

Solo

All of your glory was left like an angry child
Waiting to take your luck away
But you can't see you're still running wild
Oh Madalaine!!!
Now don't run away from me

Chorus:
Madalaine
This is love too tough to tame
Madalaine
Beware of the girl
Beware of the pain

Chorus:
Madalaine
This is love too tough to tame
Madalaine
Beware of the girl
Beware of the pain
