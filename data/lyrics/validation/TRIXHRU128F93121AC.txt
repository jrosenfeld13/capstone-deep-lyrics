Ma's out there switchin' in the Kitchen
And Dad's in the living room fussing and a-bitching
And I'm out here kicking the gong for eu-phoria

Euphoria, when your mind starts wheeling and a-walking
Your inside voices start squealing and a squawking
Floating around on a belladonna cloud
Singing eu-phoria
Euphoria

There's a man in the corner sitting underneath a table
He's out making faces at a union label
You know he picked his ears, he rolled his eyes
And whispered eu-phoria

Euphoria, when your mind starts wheeling and a-walking
Your inside voices start squealing and a squawking
Floating around on a belladonna cloud
Singing eu-phoria
Euphoria

I pinched Eve on the bottom, patted Adam on the back
I just smiled at the serpent and he smiled back
I took a bite from the apple with two bites gone
And shouted eu-phoria

Euphoria, when your mind starts wheeling and a-walking
Your inside voices start squealing and a squawking
Floating around on a belladonna cloud
Singing eu-phoria
Euphoria

Last time...
The end!
