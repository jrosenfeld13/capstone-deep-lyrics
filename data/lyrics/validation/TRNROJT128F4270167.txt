You're not Ms. Rheingold or Ms. Clairol
Or an ad for "Learn To Draw"
And you don't have the prettiest pair of legs I ever saw
But cellophane don't move me and can't turn my life around
You're the nicest piece of heart and soul
That I have ever found I've ever found

You're not a Farrah, or a Brigitte, or a Raquel pussy cat
Twenty generations of girls have tried to look like that
But class like yours ain't on the screen
And it's finally made me think
You can lead this horse to Hollywood
But you cannot make me drink (can't make him drink)

Chorus:
I love you honey, you're the one for me
And it comes naturally ...
I don't want an image, I dont' want a movie star
I just want you baby the way you are

You don't fill out the old bikini like a playboy bunny doll
In fact in that department you've got little there at all
But in modern times we've gone beyond
The Tarzans and the Janes
While some just use their bodies
Others use their brains, darling, remember brains?

(Chorus)
Bogart called them "baby", Sinatra called them "dames"
And Boyer calls them "ladies", (Norman Mailer calls us names)
But I don't need a label to know what you mean to me
So I'll just make it simple and call you frequently
(I'll call you frequently)

(Chorus)

(Chorus)
I just want you baby the way you are!!
