I can still see your head on the pillow
I can still smell your manly perfume
I can still hear your hard heartache beating
Honey, long after you left the room

I'm thinking about you when, when I'm working
You're breaking my power to concentrate
I better be careful 'cause I might get fired
For thinking about the fire we started yesterday

This woman's in love with you, baby
This woman don't think you can do no wrong
But I only think it's fair to warn you
This woman don't stay in love for long

And I'll swear that I love you, I love you forever
And when forever is over I'm gonna be kind
'Cause I don't see any reason
To leave a heart all broken and bleeding
Especially when that fatal heart might be mine

'Cause one day I'll roll over
A little bit older and single as today
One day I'll roll over
It'll be over simple as that

Right now I'm in love with you, baby
This woman don't think you can do no wrong
But I only think it's fair to warn you
This woman don't stay in love for long

This woman, this woman's gonna party
This woman, this woman's gonna party
This woman, this woman's gonna party
