[Verse 1]
Back burns are green and off for me and her
He's an ape, he's an ape, he's an angel

[Hook]
Only in 3's
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Only in 3's, oh yeah
Only in 3's
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh...

[Verse 2]
Hay for a bed with her on my head
And you are the king
The same king who will burn me

[Hook]
Only in 3's
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Only in 3's, oh yeah
Only in 3's
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
