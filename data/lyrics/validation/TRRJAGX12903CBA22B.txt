I was a modern man, I had a future plan
I saw myself doing fine
I had a vision, I made my decisions
But I was a victim of time

Caught in a fantasy, I saw reality
Gazing at me from the stars
But when I turn around, nothing is to be found
Some place is always too far

I was a happy man, joining the caravan
Keeping my place in the line
Founding a family, life in simplicity
Then I was cheated by time

Beaten by destiny, nothing appears to be
Lasting as long as it takes
Calendar tallyman, here in your wonderland
Nothing is safer than fakes

But I see the pale horizon
In the quiet of the dawn
And the morning is arising
With the daylight of my own
And I feel it's now or never
As the choir starts to hum
It's a hot line, straight to heaven
And my mind is getting numb
And I stand up and I haven
And I stuble and l fall
As I reach out for forever
And the kingdom -
The kingdom of nothing at all

And the morning will surround you
With its everlasting gold
But the colour of deception
Is the demon you behold
And the choir in the distance
Is the screaming from below
And denying their existence
Is confirming that you know
That you're left back with a riddle
'Cause the greatest dream of all
Got you trapped down in the middle of the kingdom -
The kingdom of nothing at all

So come on, we'll- take you on a free ride
Come on, a journey on the inside
Come on, hang on, it's shining in the distance
Come on, let go of your resistance
Hang on, come on, get ready for the inside
Get rid of you fear
