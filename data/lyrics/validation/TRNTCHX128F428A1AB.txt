Give me your alibi
Sins wach the wary eyes,was the attantion really worth it
Did the hand out theives deserve this
I wach the kingdom fall
A kiss carved in the wall
Tragic yes i know

Your consions won't let you go
O ooh oh oh oh o oh oh ooh oh ooh

Take off your fools disguise
No sorrow sits in lying eyes
Guilty takes its toll, im on a roll
Ive got to get this off ym chest
The penalty a pound of flesh, no more no less
To the guillotine you go

2 rights make a wrong we were trators all along
I have found confessions in the chorus of a song
The money lies
The dark of night stole us from the show

They sold the gates
Sent to cast all the faces that remain
So catch your breathe youll be sent to hell with all the rest

2 rights make a wrong we were trators all along
I have found confessions in the chorus of a song
The money lies
The dark of night stole us from the show
