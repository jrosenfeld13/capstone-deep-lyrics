I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, senor, with you
My heart won't let my feet do things they should do

You know what? You're lovely
So what? I'm lovely, but, oh, what you do to me
I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore
I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor

When you dance, you're charming and you're gentle
Especially when you do the Continental
But this feeling isn't purely mental
But heaven rest us, I'm not asbestos

And that's why, I won't dance, why should I?
I won't dance, how could I? I won't dance, merci beaucoup
I know that music leads the way to romance
So if I hold you in my arms, I won't dance

I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, senor, with you

You know what? You're lovely
So what? You're lovely, but, oh, what you do to, you do to me
I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore
I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor
