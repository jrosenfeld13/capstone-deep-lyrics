(body, body)
(Feel my bodylanguage)
(Bodylanguage)
You'll be here tonight
So I put my best dress on
I'm almost sunlight
I'll rescue nap to it
That nothing's is how it used to be
Those second kesy
Try to understand it
Those focus gloss up you and me
Now that is leaving
Get me affecting
Spare me up one-two degrees
You're so electric
(Electric, electric, electric)
Slow down and dance with me
(Yea, yea so so so so)
Skip to be a nud for my body
(Slow, slow)
Slow down and dance with me
(Yea, yea so so so so)
Skip to be a nud for my body
(Yea, yea so so so so)
(Bodybodybodylanguage)
(Slow)
You'll be here tonight
So I put my best dress on
I'm almost sunlight
I'll rescue nap to it
That nothing's is how it used to be
Those second kesy
Don't wanna rush it
Let the river put your ill
And switch if touching
You're the one who's saying
All that heavy soon will flow
And the one who's blaming
Skip to be a nud for my body
Skip to be a nud for my body
Skip to be a nud for my body
(So, so so)
