The blind who bled
The weak, undressed
Don't want, don't need
The loss ahead
Bought all but death
Poor stands with the free

On empty, hard bed very soul is fed
Mind's flesh ascedns, heals
Headless race in vain
For translucent brain
I would rather breath

You won't take me
You won't break me
I breathe on the light
That leaves never alone
You won't take me
You won't break me
I sail on the tide
That leaves never alone

You won't take me
You won't break me
I breathe on the light
That leaves never alone
You won't take me
You won't break me
I sail on the tide
That leaves never alone
