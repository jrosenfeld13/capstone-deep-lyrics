Something's going on inside my head
Keeps me awake every night I'm in my bed
Everybody looking for a man
Something I find hard to understand

Could it be so easy?
Everyone is looking for me
Ain't no sunshine in this thriller
Could I be a serial killer?

Good old feeling's coming from the gut
Every time I see a young slut
Reason tells me what I've done is wrong
Doesn't matter urges are too strong

Could it be so easy?
Everyone is looking for me
Ain't no sunshine in this thirller
Could I be a serial killer?

Now it all makes sense to me
Her blood opens my eyes so I can see
Today the paper shows my name
Oh my God it was me all along the way

Yes it is so easy
Everyone is looking for me
Ain't so sunshine in this thriller
Could I be a serial killer?

Yes it is so easy
Everyone is looking for me
Ain't no sunshine in this thriller
Yes I am a serial killer
