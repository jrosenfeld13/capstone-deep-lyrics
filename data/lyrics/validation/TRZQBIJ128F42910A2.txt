Oh, I wonder, oh why
We no longer show our love
Why in the world do we close our eyes
To the love that brings us home

Now, life, sometimes, is hard
And there will be broken hearts
No longer now will I
Run out the way of our love

Oh, I wonder how will I
Oh, I wonder 'til I cry
Get along without your love
In a cold, dark, lonely world

No longer hold our love
In the darkness of my heart
And no longer now will I
Run out the way of our love
Run out the way of our love

Oh, I wonder, oh why
We no longer show our love
Why in the world do we close our eyes
To the love that brings us home

Now, life, sometimes, is hard
And there will be broken hearts
No longer now will I
Run out the way of our love
Run out the way of our love
Run out the way of our love
