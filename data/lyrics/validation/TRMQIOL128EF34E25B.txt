I believe in God the Father
Jesus Christ, His only Son
And the blessed Holy Spirit
Distinct, yet three in one

I believe there is forgiveness
For everything we've done
That is why all the more
I will serve Him

I believe the Son of God
Was crucified upon the tree
And laid within a borrowed tomb
Not far from calvary
I believe He rose up from the dead
Alive for all to see
That is why all the more
I will serve Him

Chorus:
I have made my decision / We have made our decision
I have STAKED my claim / We have STAKED our claim
I have drawn a line in the sand / We have drawn a line in the sand
And I'll not be ashamed / And we won't be ashamed
With the world behind me / With the world behind me us
And the cross before
By the grace of God
I will serve the Lord / We will serve the Lord

I believe you must be born again
