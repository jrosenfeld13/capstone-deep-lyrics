The happiest day of the year has come around agian
Mabye tonight I'm bound to find my long awaited friend
She's waiting there. The falling star where wishes don't come true
It's too bad that I got no plan and wonder what I can possibly do

It's down once agian
Will anyone care to end the worst holiday I've ever had in years

You thought about another chance that didn't make it through
Because of what the bad scene has made out of you
Can't stand to see another smile the next time she's around
I'll lend her all my feelings for a day. How does it sound?
So cruel

It's down once agian
Will anyone care to end the worst holiday I've ever had

It's so clear, it's the worst holiday I've ever had

It's the worst holiday I've ever had
It's the worst holiday I've ever had
It's the worst holiday I've ever had
It's the worst holiday I've ever had

(ohhhh) When you want to break out...
(ohhhh) When you want to break out...
Break Out!

Do you remember when? No one was wondering
Why I was sad on this holiday?
