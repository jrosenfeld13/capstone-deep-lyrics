[Verse 1]
Hey hey, I know it wasn't New York
Where I lost my mind
Hey hey, I know I must have left it
It was back home all the time
And where were you while we lay
So drunk that we died
Hey hey, I know, but who could blame us
Under pressure

[Chorus]
And I know
I should've stayed in bed
And I know
I should've stayed in bed
And I know
I should've stayed in bed

[Verse 2]
Hey hey, I know its just a toothache
I won't even cry
Hey hey, the candy store prescriptions
All lined up in the aisles
And where were you while we lay
Shipwrecked in denial
Hey hey, it's just a pill to help you
Sleep right through the night

[Chorus]
I should've stayed in bed
And I know
I should've stayed in bed
And I know
I should've stayed in bed

[Bridge]
Because tomorrow's gonna be another party
You stay too long until the lights get lonely
Oh tomorrow's gonna be another party
Wait too long 'til we all stay out of
The Sun
Sun
The Sun
Sun

[Chorus]
And I know
I should stayed in bed
And I know
I should stayed in bed

[Outro]
I know, I know, it wasn't New York, New York
I know, I know, it wasn't New York, New York
New York, New York
New York, New York
