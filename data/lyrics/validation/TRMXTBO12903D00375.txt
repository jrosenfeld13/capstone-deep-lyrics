Under the urbanized storm
I can still sense the chug as the train pulls out
Out of the window I stare
At a stranger's hand waving his byes
Tickets are punched one by one
Just to offbeat the ticking of railway ties
Suddenly everything's new
There is music to carry me far

Mile after mile through a forested dream
Awakening to a focussed stream
Flowing from unfamiliar worlds
The mystic web of this life unfurls
Sonic pearls
