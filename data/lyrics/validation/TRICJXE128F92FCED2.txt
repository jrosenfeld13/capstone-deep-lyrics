God doesn't keep the failures from me
Like an assassin for the better half
The weak are washing upon the shores
I've got a need to kick them down

Knee jerk reaction, got a mouth on me
Sure to make enemies of best friends
Why am I stricken with a pair of these
Lips likened to poison in a rat trap?

Are you still down with me?

Got a knack for knockin' all my loved ones down
Maybe it's what keeps them always coming back
How can I expect to ever be loved
When all I can do is just to break you down?

Never think to censor the pride inside
Take a shot for nothing rather than not
Always have to have the last word, no matter what
Is it in my blood to have to take you down?

Are you still down with me?
'Cuz I am just a bastard
And I always will be
A stupid fucking bastard...
