I remember the way
Driving home late
Speeding all the way
Alone in the rain
I was rehearsing a part
From down at the bar
My mouth smelled like a drink
We were laughing, I think
I've been away

Do you pick up your phone
Do you check your mail
Do you answer your door even if it's late?
I don't know who to call
I don't know who to write
And I think I forgot
What your face looks like
I've been away

Do you think that I've changed
I swear I never tried
Memory is a terrible thing
When you use it right
I was rehearsing a part
From down at the bar
My mouth smelled like a drink
We were laughing, I think
I've been away
