She's in parties, what does that mean?
Is she wearing the blue, the red or the green?
The people she knows, the things she sees
She knows what's up, she's never at ease

Her ambitions are a well kept secret
Even her friends don't know what she intends
Out of public sight, but in the public mind
What will you wear to the party tonight?

What was her name? Can she play the game?
Give her the floor, through the back door

She walks with a limp tonight we fear she's lost the fight
Don't pop your lipstick, put on more lipstick
Black, pink, green, red, open your mouth
And they'll shoot off your head

She walks with a limp tonight we fear she's lost the fight
What will you wear to the party tonight?

What was her name? Is she into the game?
Give her the floor, through the back door
Ready to go, you can't say no
She's got something to say
Do you really wanna play?
