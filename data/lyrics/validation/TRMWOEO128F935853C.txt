[Verse 1]
Five miles outside of Vegas when we broke down
Threw my keys inside the window and we never looked back
We got all drunk and sloppy on a Greyhound bus
We passed out, all them losers - they were laughing at us

I will never let them break your heart
No I will never let them break me

[Verse 2]
We got lost in Phoenix, seemed like such a long time
Seven months of living sweaty on those thin white lines
Did some time for selling acid to the wrong guy
Life just keeps on getting smaller and we never ask why

[Chorus]
Why there is no perfect place, yes I know this is true
I'm just learning how to smile and that's not easy to do
I know there will come a day when we can leave
And just go running away

(ooh yeah)

[Verse 3]
We was broke outside of Philly when the storms came
I was working in New Jersey hitching rides in the rain
You was happy talking dirty at that phone sex place
Life just keeps on getting weirder for us every day

[Hook]
You say there is no perfect place, I say I know this is true
I'm just learning how to smile and that's not easy to do

We both live for the day when we can run away
Ah baby we can leave and run away
Yes we can leave this place and run away
We can leave it all behind like we do every time

Yes we both live for the day
When we can leave and just go running away

No I will never let it break your heart
No I will never let it break me

[Verse 4]
Five miles outside of Vegas five years down the line
We got married in the desert in the sunshine
I can handle all the hell that happens everyday
When you smile and touch my face, you make it all just go away

Yes I know there ain't no finish line
I know this never ends
We are just learning how to fall
And climb back up again

I know there's nothing perfect
I know there's nothing new
We are just learning how to live together
Me and you

You know I live for the day
When you say, "Baby let's just run away"

Ah baby we can leave and run away
Yes we can leave this place and run away
