Day goes into evening, yeah ya
Night fades away
I see a bright sunshine in every morning
Lord then a shower of rain
Give thanks and praise, give thanks and praise

I see Jah glory in the morning sun
I see Jah glory when the day is done

A little bit of it can be sweet
When you ain't got plenty
Don't drown yourself now
Don't drown yourself now
In too much honey

You wake up early every morning
Worrying about your earthly possessions
Don't make it hold ya
Don't make it hold ya
In these obsessions

I see Jah glory in the morning sun
I see Jah glory when the day is done

I see Jah glory in the morning sun
I see Jah glory when the day is done
