When I hear that Serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago
Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue
It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor

And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became the cry
Cause you remained in my heart, so
Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or lonely, lonely ashes of the flame, with you
Should I go on whistling in the dark
Serenade in blue
