If you miss the train I'm on
You will know that I gone
You can hear the whistle blow
A hundred miles

A hundred miles
A hundred miles
A hundred miles
A hundred miles
You can hear the whistle blow
A hundred miles

Yes I'm one
Yes I'm two
Yes I'm three
Yes I'm four
Yes I'm 500 miles from my home

500 miles
500 miles
500 miles
500 miles
Lord I'm five hundred miles from my home

Not a shirt on my back
Not a penny to my name
Lord I can't go a-home
This a-way
This a-way
This a-way
This a-way
This a-way
Lord I can't go a-home
This a-way

If you miss the train I'm on
You will know that I am gone
You can hear the whistle blow
A hundred miles

A hundred miles
A hundred miles
A hundred miles
A hundred miles
You can hear the whistle blow
A hundred miles

You can hear the whistle blow
A hundred miles

Yes You can hear the whistle blow
A hundred miles
