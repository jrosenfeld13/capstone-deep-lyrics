The Soul Cadillac is drivin' up
The Soul Cadillac is in me
Well a soul transformed from a dirty truck
By a girl who loves me
I was alone
I wore the fragrance of men who worked in the heat
I work all day
Pouring the asphalt and shaping the concrete
And I sing now

The Soul Cadillac is drivin' up
The Soul Cadillac is in me
Well a soul transformed from a dirty truck
By a girl who loves me

She's a warm-hearted girl
And such a treasure to hold
To a working man's body
She's like music with plenty of soul

She's my Soul Cadillac

I met her down at the East Town Pub
In a slow dance we embraced
She fixed up my home down by the water
And made it a comfortable place
Oh I tell ya

She's a warm-hearted girl
And such a treasure to hold
To a working man's body
She's like music
She's my soul

The Soul Cadillac is drivin' up
The Soul Cadillac is in me
Well a soul transformed from a dirty truck
By a girl who loves me

She's the girl who loves me
