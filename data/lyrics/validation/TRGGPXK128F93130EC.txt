I may be
Just like Bill
I'm up on the hill
And I can't get down

I cry because you don't know
I cry because you will never know

Just how dark can an animal be?
How dark can an animal be?

Dark like darkness
Dark like a devil out in the woods now

I saw the light
That just buzzed
I saw the light
But, my brain just buzzed

I cry because you never know
I cry because you will never know

Just how black can an animal be?
How black can an animal be?

Dark like darkness
Dark like a devil out in the woods now

Train
Train I ride
Train I ride
Ride on me
Ride on me
