Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Peace to the world

I see a baby in a crib
Reaching up for Mama's arms
Love is rising in their hearts - oh yeah

There is a man standing on the street
Shouting loud above the crowd
Saying amen to everyone one around - oh yeah

I see a man who loved his land
Laying lifeless on the ground
He said the time is now
To bring peace to the world
Say yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Peace to the world

We build a wall of stone
As high as the trees are tall
Higher then the mountains
Stronger then us all - oh yeah

Some day that wall will crumble
Tumble and fall, the sun will shine
And bring peace to us all
Say yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Bring peace to us all
Bring peace to us all

We build a wall of stone
As high as the trees are tall
Higher then the mountains
Stronger then us all - oh yeah

Some day that wall will crumble
Tumble and fall, the sun will shine
And bring peace to us all
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Peace to us all
Peace to the world
