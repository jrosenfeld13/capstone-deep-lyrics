And maybe one day
If you will look just straight into my eyes
And you would find your sun inside
And just a twinkle in your eye
And maybe you'd say
I did the best I can with what I know
Our hollowed past won't feed the wrong
It makes more sense to move along
And maybe one day
Maybe one day
To keep ourselves from movin on
And we will try and get along
Maybe one day
Maybe one day
If we will both just lead our lives
And we will try and compromise again without you

Some are happy, you can say
Doesn't matter anyway
Doesn't matter in the end
Doesn't matter all depends
And I was happy just to say
Doesn't matter anyway
Doesn't matter in the end
Doesn't matter in the end

And I was happy just to say I met you
So maybe one day
Maybe one day
To keep ourselves from movin' on
And we will try and get along
Maybe one day
Maybe one day
If we will both just lead our lives
And we will try and compromise

Maybe one day
Maybe one day
To keep ourselves from movin' on
And we will try and get along
Maybe one day
Maybe one day(2x)
