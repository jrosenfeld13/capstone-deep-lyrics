One gonna heal my body, another gonna heal my pain
One gonna settle me down then bring me back up again
I'm gonna put my family back together again
One gonna hold my woman, another gonna hold my job
One gonna help me get up, another gonna help me stop
One gonna help me talk right, one gonna lay me down to sleep

(Humming)

One gonna hold my thoughts and another gonna hold my bones
One gonna keep me warm and another gonna keep me cold
One gonna bring religion right from a Coleman stove
One gonna help me keep and another gonna help me take
One gonna run me down, a hail of bullets in the wake
You're gonna keep my soul it was yours to have long ago

(Humming)

One gonna buckle my belt around the ceiling pipe
One gonna buckle my knees and one gonna lock them up tight
One gonna hold a pen while you drag my arm across the page
One gonna hold my memory another gonna close the door
One gonna leave me restless another wanting more
You're gonna keep my soul it was yours to have long ago

(Humming)
