A hatchback driven slowly
Safer if hands at the wheel
Low tar cigarette stub
Empty the ashtray, love
Used to be on forty a day

Doesn't mind a good [?] park
Walt Disney's not his thing
The Happy Meal was never to his taste
Even with the model of the Lion King
In the land of our fathers

Welcome to the land of our fathers
Offices and factories
A two week holiday
Bills that you can't pay
You're still going grey
In the land of our fathers

I'm so embarrassed, Dad
Don't ever talk to my friends!
Just keep on driving
Don't get us lost
Pick us up at half past ten

Welcome to the land of our fathers
Offices and factories
A two week holiday
Bills that you can't pay
Pop music is rubbish these days
In the land of our fathers

Cordless drills, hard-to-take pills
Easier summations
No job interview
Part time [?] queue
DIY coffin
Soon you'll be dead

Welcome to the land of our fathers
Offices and factories
Downsized economising
White lies for surprises
[?] session on the horizon

Welcome to the land of our fathers
Offices and factories
A two week holiday
Bills that you can't pay
We'll wreck the house when you go away
In the land of our fathers
In the land of our fathers
In the land of our fathers
