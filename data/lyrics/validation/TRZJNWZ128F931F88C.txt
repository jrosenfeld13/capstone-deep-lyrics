Verse:
Lately I've been thinking about God's goodness
Lately I've been thinking about God's mercy;
I've been tryin' to tell everybody
All of the good things He's done for me
But I found out...

Chorus:
He's been so good to me
That I just can't tell it all
He's done so much for me
That I just can't tell it all
He's been so good to me
That I just can't
I can't tell it all (I can't tell it all)

Bridge:
He loosed my shackled and He set me free
That's not the half of what He's done for me;
Chorus
Vamp:
I can't tell it all
