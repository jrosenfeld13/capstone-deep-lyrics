Your face turned red as you came in from the cold
Why is this so civilized, why is this so...
Where's the screaming that I've come to expect
You put a reassuring hand upon mine
We have had the best times but now we must move on
And if I keep telling myself that this is for the best then
Maybe I can carry on, maybe I can carry on
Break ups are supposed to be insults and screaming
Not conversations and one last night
So where do we go now?
Well... I have to leave
