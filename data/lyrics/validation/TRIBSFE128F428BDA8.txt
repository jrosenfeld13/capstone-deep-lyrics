[Chorus]
What ever happened to twin sets?
What ever happened to hi-fi?
What ever happened to TV sex?
What ever happened to you and I?

[Verse 1]
Your passion is a product of highlight and detail
That come hither look
Bonus offer retail

[Chorus]
What ever happened to pickup trucks?
What ever happened to yellow pages?
What ever happened to burning books?
What ever happened to new ages?

[Verse 2]
Your emotions are cheap
Cut, price, cash and carry
You wear your heart on your sleeve
For any Tom, Dick or Harry

[Hook]
Your love is a cash-in check
Oh, oh, that's the way of all flesh

[Chorus]
What ever happened to Chairman Mao?
What ever happened to God above?
What ever happened to the cow?
What ever happened to plug-in love?

[Verse 3]
Your pasteurized life
So fit for consumption
Ooh, those undressing eyes
So strictly commercial

[Hook]
Your love is a cash-in check
Oh, oh, that's the way of all flesh

All flesh, all flesh
