Opened up my eyes to join celebrations
Understand the truths of love and patience
Got a lot to know without hesitation... with you

Wasting all that time with good intentions
Think about those days of blurred perception
Who I live for now is no longer a question... it's you

And it's all because of you
Everything for you is true
There's nothing I would rather do

And it's all because of you
Everything for you is true
There's nothing I would rather do

Opened up my eyes to fear and rejection
Through the error of trials and learned my lessons
Doing all I can to make a connection

And it's all because of you
Everything for you is true
There's nothing I would rather do

And it's all because of you
Everything for you is true
There's nothing I would rather do
