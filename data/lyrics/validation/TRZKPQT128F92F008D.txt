Falling down on me, before you taste the rage
Bind me down, I'm a book not a page
Lend me your dream, here's a wing for my pay
When the shoe's on the other foot, you ain't got much to say

I know you see the ghost on the side of the road
Silhouettes of headlights, are where ya gonna go
You see your mamma smile, you hear a song that you adore
Amazing Grace, won't unlock your door

Now it's time for you to shed your snake eyes
It's time for you to go
Lay on the table the rest of your lies
It's time for you to go

All the crying is over, all the love is gone
And all that remains, are the words in a song
And anywhere but here, is where I belong
Cause none of your prophecies have ever seen where I've gone

Now it's time for you to shed your snake eyes
It's time for you to go
Lay on the table the rest of your lies
It's time for you to go
