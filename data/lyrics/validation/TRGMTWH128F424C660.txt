Too many nights, nothing to do
Drive out to the levee and I think about you
I think about my coat hanging on your door
I think about your dress lying on the floor

You say you don't love me
Well I think you might
Meet me on the levee tonight

Backtalk and rumors all around town
I say the word, your new man coming around
Betty told Jimmy and Jimmy told me
Now I'm standing on the levee I just cannot believe

You say you don't love me
Well I think you might
So meet me on the levee tonight

Old Man River running wild and free
He found his lover between the devil
And the deep blue sea
Ain't that a little like you and me
Just a little like you and me

I know your lips, the cut of your hair
The shape of your hips, baby I've been there
Deep in your heart, beneath your breast
I know you know which one is the best

You say you don't love me
Well I think you might
Meet me on the levee tonight
Meet me on the levee tonight

Too many nights, nothing to do
Drive out to the levee and I think about you
Think about my coat hanging on your door
And I think about your dress. It was lying on the floor

You say you don't love me
But you might
Meet me on the levee tonight
You say you don't love me
Well I think you might
And I'll prove it on the levee tonight
Meet me on the levee tonight
