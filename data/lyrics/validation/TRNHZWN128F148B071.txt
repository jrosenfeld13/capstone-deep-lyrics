[Verse 1]
Another year has passed me by
Still I look at myself and cry
What kind of man have I become?
All of the years I've spent in search of myself
And I'm still in the dark
'Cause I can't seem to find the light alone

[Chorus 1]
Sometimes I feel like a man in the wilderness
I'm a lonely soldier off to war
Sent away to die, never quite knowing why
Sometimes it makes no sense at all
Makes no sense at all

[Verse 2]
Ten thousand people look my way
But they can't see the way that I feel
Nobody even cares to try
I spend my life and sell my soul on the road
And I'm still in the dark
'Cause I can't seem to find the light alone

[Chorus 2]
Sometimes I feel like a man in the wilderness
I'm a lonely sailor lost at sea
Drifting with the tide, never quite knowing why
Sometimes it makes no sense at all

[Bridge]
(I'm alive)
Looking for love, I'm a man with emotion
(And my heart's on fire)
I'm dying of thirst in the middle of the ocean
(I'm alive)

[Chorus 1]
Sometimes I feel like a man in the wilderness
I'm a lonely soldier off to war
Sent away to die, never quite knowing why
Sometimes it makes no sense
Sometimes it makes no sense
Sometimes it makes no sense at all
Makes no sense at all

[Outro]
At all
Can't find the meaning of it all
Yeah
Can't find the light alone, oh
