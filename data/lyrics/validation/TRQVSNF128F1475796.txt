We are the most depressed people
Living on this earth
I've been smoking way too long
My hands and feet stay cold

Can't you ever stop?
Can't you ever stop?
Can't you ever stop?
Can't you ever stop?

We're totally out there
We're totally out there
We're totally out there
We're totally out there
We're totally out there
We're totally out there
We're totally out there
We're totally out there

We are the most depressed couple
Living on this earth
I've been smoking way too long
My hands and feet stay cold

Excuse me, Mister
This isn't something's going on ever for it, for it some?
That's all

Blut pills around me
Pills, more pills around me
