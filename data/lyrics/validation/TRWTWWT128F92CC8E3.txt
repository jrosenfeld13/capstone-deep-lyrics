A subtle shift in the way she smiles
A subtle look and the whole world cries
But I got two heads to live today
I got two hearts to give away

To the rescue babe
They're coming far from here
Down among the pines
They're coming far from here
I'll see you some time
Some day when the weathers fine
See you some time

Gentle heart never hurt a soul
You live in trust and you learn to love
In silent darkness I hold your hand
I don't get much but I get the way she rolls

To the rescue babe
They're coming far from here
Down among the pines
They're coming far from here
I'll see you some time
Some day when the weathers fine
See you some time

But I got two heads to live today
I got two hearts to give away
And I won't trust a love that is
I won't trust a love that is not blind

To the rescue babe
They're coming far from here
Down among the pines
They're coming far from here
I'll see you some time
Some day when the weathers fine
See you some time
