Hey bartender pour me another one
'cause I don't think that I've had enough
Make it a bourbon make it a double one
You can see that I'm still standing up
Whiskey and women well they fool me every time
Into thinking I'm the hero I have pictured
In my mind

So tell me a secret to get me through the night
Or let's turn up the jukebox and tell me a lie

Where am I this evening? no I don't mean what bar
I mean what city? and in what state am I?
Honey, are you leaving? and do you have a car?
And could you take me along for the ride?
A woman like you well, you could enter in my life
And let me be the lover I have pictured in my mind

So tell me a secret to get me through the night
Or let's turn up the jukebox and tell me a lie

Here's a quarter why don't I play us a song
B 33 I believe it's George Jones
I believe it's a slow one in 3/4 time
So let's turn up the jukebox and tell me a lie

Hey bartender did she say where she was going?
Well I must have dozed off for awhile
Are these my cigarettes? and how much do I owe?
I guess I'll see you again tomorrow night
Do you think she'd mind it if I called her
Up sometime?
I might be the reason she's been searching
Her whole life

So tell me a secret to get me through the night
Or let's turn up the jukebox and tell me a lie
