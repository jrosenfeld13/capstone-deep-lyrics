Dead eyes
I would like to see some light
No surprise
My touch goes out of sight
I have to go
I gotta see the sun
Cant kill what has not begun
Trouble starts in paradise

Time changes
Rearrange my soul
I feel strangled
Now I dance alone

(chorus)
Im sorry for the shape Im in
Im sorry but I lost it friend
Ill never see your face again
Theres no tomorrow
No one to follow

Scuse me
Darkness needs no light
I see
Your glories out of sight
I gotta go I have to self destruct
No more fuel
Im out of luck
Shine on in paradise

Time changes
Rearrange my soul
I feel strangled
Now I dance alone

(chorus)
(solo)

(chorus)
(x2)
