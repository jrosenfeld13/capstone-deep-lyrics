[Verse 1]
Plans and preparations are decided in vain
Think we've seen enough now
Hope and validation are united again

[Chorus]
Higher than the buds that bloomed
I've seen it hanging in your face
You may need time to think it over

[Verse 2]
Set a new direction for the harvest ahead
Think we've seen enough now
Built the resurrection of a bond nearly dead
Seen enough now

[Chorus]
Higher than the windswept moon
I've seen it hanging in your face
You may need time to think it over

[Verse 3]
Plans and preparations are decided in vain
Hope and validation are united again
Set a new direction for the harvest ahead
Built the resurrection of a bond nearly dead

[Outro]
Think we've seen enough now
Think we've seen enough now
Think we've seen enough now
Think we've seen enough now
