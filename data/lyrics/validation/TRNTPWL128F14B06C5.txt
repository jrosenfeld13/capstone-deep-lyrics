Chorus:
Dust on the Bible
Dust on the Holy Word
The words of all the prophets
And the sayings of our Lord
Of all the other books you'll find
There's none salvation holds
Get that dust off the Bible and redeem your poor soul

I went into a home one day to see some friends of mine
Of all the books and magazines, not a Bible could I find
I asked them for the Bible; when they brought it, what a shame
For the dust was covered o'er it, not a fingerprint was plain

(Repeat chorus)
You can read your magazines, read of love and tragic things
And not one verse of Scripture, not one verse do you know
When it is the very truth and its contents good for you
Dust on the Bible will doom your poor soul

(Repeat chorus)
