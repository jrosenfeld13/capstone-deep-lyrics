[Chorus:]
Just the other day you called me
I was up and gone with a new lady
Couldn't express what I have done, no
I was the prisoner of her love, well

This is how love comes and then passed by
Before you turned around I saw the teardrop in your eyes
But the memories written in your heart and my soul
Easily she dropped them out of my world

So I was flying way with the one who robbed me from you
Standing on a beach ten million miles out of this space, lord
She brought me behind the stars and Jah sun
Showed me how two crystals melt and become one, so

[Chorus]
Anytime you're there I see you crying
You tears them drying slow
The scarf is deep and it's still hurting
And love is hating love
Anytime you're there I feel you dying
But tears don't make me go
Cause I found love and now I'm smiling
Girl that's the way I turn back from you
Yes, I turn back to true saying

[Chorus]
Said I am a prisoner, yes, I am a prisoner, a prisoner
Said I am prisoner, a prisoner of her love

My soul and spirit flying
You're touching me so deep
Give me your hand my princess and feel my heartbeat
'cause I'm happy like this and it seems like that you know
Me needs my life and my treasure
So with you I am home and

[Chorus]
