Tonight I'm freezing inside
Looking up at you floating afar
Let's go back to the shore over there
The sky painted in deep black
At the end of today
I become unbound burning empty feelings
Don't be stuck on just one idea
Take your mind off of the past
A lie and a lie and a lie
And a slip and a slip and a slip of the lip
Don't you remember you've broken my heart ?
We've come to the end so let's go to the start
Rain wipes off your dry tears
Just try to find something
I'm lost so far and I can't hold my breath
Take it all away
This is where I belong even if I can't find it
So can I creep inside you ?
And take it to heart when I say
This is where I belong even if I can't find it
