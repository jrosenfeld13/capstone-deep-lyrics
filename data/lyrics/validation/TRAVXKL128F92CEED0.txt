Heartaches, on your wedding day
Double takes when they look my way
Knees quake, there ain't a shotgun in the place
You like the frosting, you just bought the cake
Your eyes can't fake
Still in love with nobody
And I won't tell nobody

The bridegroom
Drags you 'cross that room
Said I do
But honey you were just a kid
Your eyes said I did
Still in love with nobody
Nobody, nobody
And I won't tell nobody

Take a look
On your wedding night
In your wedding book
See what name I signed
Hey
Love nobody
Nobody, nobody
Then nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody

Hips shake
To the band for old time's sake
Now you make your getaway
And you're waving to the stage
But on the last page says
Love nobody
Nobody, nobody
And I won't tell nobody
Nobody, nobody
Yeah you're still in love with nobody
Nobody, nobody
And I used to be nobody
Nobody, nobody
Not anymore
