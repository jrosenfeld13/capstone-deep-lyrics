You must think you are beautiful
You must think you are it
You're such an enigma not like anybody else
You must think you are God
Oh how do you do it
You act so fucking strange
You must think I'm susceptible
Well you're up you're...
High As A Kite
You must think life is wonderful
You must live it to the full
Oh you're so different your eyes look like
They're sun dyed
You must think I'm dispensible
Well you're up you're...
High As A Kite
I'm gonna take you higher
Or maybe I'm a liar, maybe I am...
