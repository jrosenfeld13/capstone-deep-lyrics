We've all got troubles
We all make mistakes
But let's not take a little river
Turn it into a lake
We've all been humbled
We've lost and we've found
But it can never get the best of us
If we're not lookin' down

And I wonder
Are there others like me
Yeah I wonder
I've got the whole world left to see

Hey everybody
If you listen to the beat
We'll celebrate it now
By stompin' our feet
Hey everybody
Do you know what I mean
We can get it dirty
While we're keepin' it clean

Na Na Na Na...

You've got it bad
Well, she's got it worse
She's got no chocolate in the bank account
No cheese in the purse
You feel neglected with no self esteem
Just when you've finally found your glitter
Someone's taken the gleam

And I wonder
Why is life always this way
Yes you wonder
Could there be a brighter day

Hey everybody
If you listen to the beat
We'll celebrate it now
By stompin' our feet
Hey everybody
Do you know what I mean
We can get it dirty
While we're keepin' it clean

And I wonder now
(Can we work it out)
And I wonder now

Hey everybody
If you listen to the beat
We'll celebrate it now
By stompin' our feet
Hey everybody
Do you know what I mean
We can get it dirty
While we're keepin' it clean

Hey everybody
If you listen to the beat
We'll celebrate it now
By stompin' our feet
Hey everybody
Do you know what I mean
We can get it dirty
While we're keepin' it clean
