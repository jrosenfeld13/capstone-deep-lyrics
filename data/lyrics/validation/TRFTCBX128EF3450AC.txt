Therell be bluebirds over
The white cliffs of Dover
Tomorrow, just you wait and see
Therell be love and laughter
And peace ever after
Tomorrow, when the world is free
The shepherd will tend his sheep
The valley will bloom again
And Johnny will go to sleep
In his own little room again
Therell be bluebirds over
The white cliffs of Dover
Tomorrow, just you wait and see...!
