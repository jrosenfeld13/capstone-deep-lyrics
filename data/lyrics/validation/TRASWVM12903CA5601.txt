[Verse 1]
Dem call mi king in a the gyallis world lately
Every woman weh a celebrity rate mi

Mi have woman from 18 to 80
About one thousand gyal mi have a date mi
And each one a dem have dem own matie
The gyal dem seh mi sweet like pastry
It's mathematically crazy

[Chorus]
Cause mi have more
Much more than a million gyal
A million gyal
Check, recheck, a more than a million gyal

Mi have gyal weh fit every description
Doctor gyal we fill mi prescription
Waitress gyal weh work down a fiction
Coke head gyal weh struggle with addiction

A New York, Paris and Brixton
Black woman, white woman and some mixed one

[Chorus]

Much more than a million gyal

Rich gyal weh tek mi to shopping at the mall
