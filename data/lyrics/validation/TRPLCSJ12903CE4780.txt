Walking down an empty road
I saw a man in old grey clothes
A stranger

Passing by he smiled at me
But when I looked I realised the danger

For his eyes they looked so empty and cold
And something told me that I'm gonna be rolled
In my pocket only cents and dimes
But then for them he'd gladly kill me

Walking past and walking fast
I managed just to slip around a corner

Thought he'd hear my running feet
As I went pounding down the street
Like thunder

Well I've never heard my heart beat so fast
And I've never been so scared in the past
And I never ever realised
That this place could be evil to me

Billy Porter
You didn't tell me that I needed a gun
Billy Porter
When you wrote you said
That this place is fun
What have I done

Well I've never heard my heart beat so fast
And I've never been so scared in the past
And I never ever realised
That this place could be evil to me
Let me tell ya'

Now Billy's smart and Billy's tough
He's good to have
When the going's rough
He told me

"Don't go out on your own at night
For if you do you'll have to fight
Stay by me"

Now he's teaching me
Each and every day
And I think that in this place
I might stay
And I never, ever realised
What a roughneck I would turn out to be

Billy Porter
You never told me that I needed a gun
Billy Porter
When you wrote you said
That this place is fun
What can be done

Billy Porter
You never told me that I needed a gun
Billy Porter
When you wrote you said
That this place is fun

Billy Porter
You never told me that I'd be on the run
Billy Porter
What would father say if he saw his son
Billy Porter
You never told me that I needed a gun
Billy Porter
When you wrote you said
That this place is fun
