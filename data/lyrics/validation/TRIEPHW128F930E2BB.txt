Someone who can satisfy my every little need
I'm hoping it's you
I've been waiting for someone to bring their love to me
I'm hoping it's you

I wonder if you're qualified to give me love and affection
Cuz in my mind girl, I'm hoping that it's you
Cuz things never seem to go my way
I've been hurt so many times before
And I need a little something more, are you that someone

Someone who can satisfy my every little need
I'm hoping it's you
I've been waiting for someone to bring their love to me
I'm hoping it's you

You got a opportunity if you want to be my lady
I want you to know that people say I'm hard to please
So won't you come and change my world
I can give you anything you need
But I want to know what can you do for me
What can you do do for me, baby

You can make me love you
Don't waste my time
Put your heart into it
And everything will be allright
You got to promise to be that special one in my life
Said it feels so good to know that you are all mine

Someone who can satisfy my every little need
I'm hoping it's you
I've been waiting for someone to bring their love to me
I'm hoping it's you

Oh baby
Girl, I'm looking for someone
Ooohhh, oh baby, yeah

Someone who can satisfy my every little need
I'm hoping it's you
I've been waiting for someone to bring their love to me
I'm hoping it's you
