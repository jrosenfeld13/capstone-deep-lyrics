I was only 17 when you looked at me that way
Seems like yesterday
I was only foolin' round when you stole my heart away
I've never been the same

I felt the strangest feeling
Like a raging fire it burns
He left I cried for weeks and
I can't forget him
A lesson that I've learned

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes you fly and break your wing, ohh
Love changes, changes everything
Love makes the rules from fools to kings
Love changes, love changes everything

Then the years went rolling by
I grew up and moved away
Had to earn my pay
Found another lover then
But my heart is sad to say
It only ended up the same way

I wonder was I destined, to spend my life alone
Oh boy, you answered my question
This time it's working, you've given me the hope

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes you fly and break your wing, ohh
Love changes, changes everything
Love makes the rule from fools to kings
Love changes, love changes everything

I've seen the way love shakes you makes you break you
It's got a power of it's own

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes you fly and break your wing, ohh
Love changes, changes everything
Love makes the rule from fools to kings
Love changes, love changes
Love changes everything
