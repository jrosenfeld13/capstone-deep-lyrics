Walk in my world of war and mass confusion
Peace is a word that noone cares of knowing
Death is the drug of choice amongst the masses
Engines of helll, forever burning faster

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....

The shotgun of life, the spread of all the ashes
The wheels of the tanks, the souls in which it smashes
Oceans of blood the shores of all the falling
The hole in the ground forever always calling

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....

Lords Of Destruction
Lords Of Destruction
Lords Of Destruction
Lords Of Destruction
Lords Of Destruction
Lords Of Destruction
Lords Of Destruction
Lords Of Destruction

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....
