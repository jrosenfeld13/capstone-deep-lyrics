If I look around in society today
I just can't find the words
I don't know what to say
Hatred has replaced
Compassion and respect
We seem to accept
Things we should reject

Sometimes I really think
No one gives a damn
We teach a lot of rules
Which we never exam
So maybe I just should
Act like one of those
And punch a harmless granny
Real hard op her nose

Let's sing a song together
'cause we are all fucked up
In a society of violence
It's better to be locked up

Give me a gun
I blow your head away
I just wanna kill
A rich kid today
Lend me your knife
And than I'll stab you in the back
I just like some blood
It's cool if you can't hit me back

Give me you're car
I'll drive it off a bridge
I can't return your keys
They're stolen by a midge
Spare me some coins
So I can cop some dope
I will feed it to your sister
And hang her on a rope

Let's sing a song together
'cause we are all fucked up
In a society of violence
It's better to be locked up

Oh my god what's going on
Did we lose it all?
If we stay intolerant
Down iswhere we fall
Why not put a smile on
And share a pint of beer
Everyone is welcometo have fun
And give a cheer

Let's sing a song together
'cause we are all fucked up
In a society of violence
It's better to be locked up
