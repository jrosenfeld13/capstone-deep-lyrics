I swung that hammer
'Till my hands got weak
Swung that thing
'Till I was crazy from the heat
I built that tower right in my back yard
I worked so long man, I tried so hard

Ain't no ladder
Ain't no steps
Ain't no way to earn it
I'm talkin' 'bout Grace, Grace
Lay it all down my brother, my sister
Lay it all down at the feet of Grace
Grace, Grace
Lay it all down my brother, my sister
Lay it all down at the feet of Grace

I jumped so high
That I caused a scene
Followed every rule
'Till I was squeaky clean
Learned so much, that I didn't know a thing
All that work man, and what did it bring?

Ain't no ladder
Ain't no steps
Ain't no way to earn it
I'm talkin' 'bout Grace, Grace
Lay it all down my brother, my sister
Lay it all down at the feet of Grace
Grace, Grace
Lay it all down my brother, my sister
Lay it all down at the feet of Grace

Oh my, my
Could it be?
The best things in life are
Still free, still free, still free, still free

We've got to give it up
When what we have is much too much, my brother
We've got to give it up
When what we have is just not enough, my sister
We've got to give it all
When all we've got has led us to seek not His face
We've got to keep on, keep on, keeping on

Layin' it all down
Lay it all down
Lay it all down now

Take my house, my car and my cat
Take it all and don't bring it back
The only thing that I've got
That's worth anything

Is this gift so
Humbling, humbling. Oh humbling, so humbling
Oh humbling, so humbling
Oh humbling, so humbling
Give me that gift so humbling

Grace, Grace
Grace, Grace
Lay it all down my brother, my sister
Lay it all down at the feet of Grace

Oh my, my
Could it be?
Oh my, my
Oh my, my
Could it be?
The best things in life are
Still free

Lay it all down my brother, my sister
Lay it all down at the feet of Grace
We've got to give it up

Still free
