Where's the love, where's the love, where's the love
That you were always giving
I don't know, I don't know
If it was ever there in the beginning

Too far gone, it's been too long
You left me with no explanation
I've been strong, I've moved on
On and on, on and on

Too far gone, it's been too long
You left me with no explanation
I've been strong, I've moved on
On and on, on and on

Give it up, give it up, give it ip
You know your time is over
It's enough, it's enough
You have to, no one knows the only answer

Too far gone, it's been too long
You left me with no explanation
I've been strong, I've moved on
On and on, on and on

Too far gone, it's been too long
You left me with no explanation
I've been strong, I've moved on
On and on, on and on

Hhhhhhhhho
It's too late now, now
Hhhhhhhhho
Just look at me now, now

Too far gone, it's been too long
You left me with no explanation
I've been strong, I've moved on
On and on, on and on

Too far gone, it's been too long
You left me with no explanation
I've been strong, I've moved on
On and on, on and on

Too far gone, it's been too long..
I've been strong, I've moved on..
Too far gone
