Mama said
Don't you play around town
But I just can't control myself
Picking up that boy tonight
Ain't gonna put him down 'til it feels all right

[Verse 1]
People stop and stare 'cause looking is fair
Come on over baby let me show you how I care
It's getting hot in here, my biorhythm's jumping
Got my circulation pumping, we are

[Chorus]
Body to body, funk to funky
We know how to rock your party
Body to body, funky to funky
We know how, we know how we're wreckin' up your party

[Verse 2]
It's physical, not just spiritual attraction
I hear you coming when I ring the dinner bell
Got my phazer set to stun
Now we're gonna have some fun
I got my people up inside, baby wanna ride
Party's fairly jumping but we're gonna have to slide
I need a miracle, turn it up a little higher
The roof is on fire, we are

[Chorus]
Body to body, funk to funky
We know how to rock your party
Body to body, funky to funky
We know how, we know how we're wreckin' up your party
Body to body, funk to funky
We know how to rock your party
Body to body, funky to funky
We know how, we know how we're wreckin' up your party
Struck out another line
Making an all time flow

My mama said
To get things done
You gotta go to school
Ain't gonna have no fun
My mama said
You're still too young
You gotta slow it down
Ain't gonna have no fun
My mama said
To get things done
You gotta go to school
Ain't gonna have no fun
My mama said
You're still too young
You gotta slow it down
Ain't gonna have no fun
No No

[Outro]
'Cause we are
'Cause we are
'Cause we are
