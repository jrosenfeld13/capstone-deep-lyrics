Can someone tell me who I've got to pay
To help me find a remedy?
Now I'm not sure I can wait another day
'cause I'm my own worst enemy
There was a time I thought I knew the way
But that's all ancient history
Cause every time I feel that I am there
I'm never where I want to be
Tell me, "Why do I still dream about you?"
I wonder where you'll be, when I'm gone
Now I know you are the one
I guess you've always been the one
I don't know why I run away
Every time I hear your name
So maybe I should find another way
It's time to come in from the rain
"Why do I still dream about you?"
I wonder where you'll be when I'm gone?
Now I know you are the one
I guess you've always been the one
So, now I know you are the one
Someone tell me who I've got to pay
To help me find a remedy
Now I'm not sure I can wait another day
Now I'm my own worst enemy
Why do I still dream about you
I wonder where you'll be, when I am gone?
I guess you've always been the one
