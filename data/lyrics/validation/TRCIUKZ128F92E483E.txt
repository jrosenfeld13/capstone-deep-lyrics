I close the curtains
Won't let the day light in
Put out the candles
Pour another gin
And when the lightning strikes
The thunder's never far away
And you're the lightning like
Im thunder on a foggy day
Or so it seems, or so it seems
Darkness approaching
Guess there's a storm breaking in
Rain drops increasing
Stronger gets the wind
Autumn brought shadows
My days of mourning are through
Gone is the sorrow
The way my life has grown
When the lightning strikes
The thunder's never far away
And you're the lightning like
I'm thunder on a foggy day
Or so it seems, or so it seems
Chords on my piano
Fading away in the room
The ticking of a clock or
Is it a metronome
And when the lightning strikes
The thunder's never far away
And you're the lightning like
I'm thunder on a foggy day
Or so it seems, or so it seems
