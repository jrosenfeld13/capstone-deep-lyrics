There's a gentleman that's going round
Turning the joint upside down
Stool Pigeon - ha-cha-cha-cha
He's an old ex-con that's been away
Now he's back, no one's safe
Stool Pigeon - ha-cha-cha-cha

If you wanna squeal, said the FBI
We can make a deal, make it worth your while
So he told it all and in return
He got a credit card and a Thunderbird
And the maximum security
Even after plastic surgery
So go on and squeal, said the FBI
We can make a deal, make it worth your while

There's a gentleman that's going round
Turning the joint upside down
Stool Pigeon - ha-cha-cha-cha
He's an old ex-con that's been away
Now he's back, no one's safe
Stool Pigeon - ha-cha-cha-cha

After all the talk then they wired him
And he took a walk with his crooked friends
And they joked about the good old days
And he recorded it on a reel of tape
He caught the mug who did in the forgery
And the babe in charge of larceny
So the FBI they rewarded him
Because they like a guy who will stab a friend

There's a gentleman that's going round
Turning the joint upside down
Stool Pigeon - ha-cha-cha-cha
He's an old ex-con that's been away
Now he's back, no one's safe
Stool Pigeon - ha-cha-cha-cha

There's a gentleman that's going round ....

If you wanna squeal, said the FBI
We can make a deal, make it worth your while
So he told it all and in return
He got a credit card and a Thunderbird
He got a spanking new identity
And a condo down in Miami
He bought a plane, a boat and jewelry
But he couldn't buy any company

There's a gentleman that's going round ....
