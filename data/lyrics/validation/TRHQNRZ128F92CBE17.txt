C'mon and show me
That you really know me
So close so tight
At least for tonight

Turning silver and gold
Into rubber and glue
Not supposed to let it get to you
It's easy to say but hard to do

When you roll back into town
They'll all be around
Just to show you
That friends like mine will never let you down
Until you hit the ground

And they don't know you

Take what you can borrow
But what about tomorrow
Just have to wait and see
What's in it for me

Turning silver and gold
Into rubber and glue
Not supposed to let it get to you
It's easy to say but hard to do

When you roll back into town
They'll all be around
Just to show you
That friends like mine will never let you down
Until you hit the ground

Your an open book
Here's a mirror
Take a look
Don't like what you see?
Don't come running to me

When you roll back into town
They'll all be around
Just to show you
That friends like mine will never let you down
Until you hit the ground

And they don't know you
Friends like mine will never let you down
And they don't know you
