It was a thrill upon a hill
Everybody was feelin' real

Everybody had the look
It was written all over their face
Giving up the funk
A-waitin' for the bomb

You wouldn't believe how they partied
You would believe they'd never stop
Dancing to some funky new sound
Da da, da daa da
Da da da da

I want to go back and get
More of that funky stuff
I got to get some more of that
More of that funky stuff
(x2)

Da da, da daa da
Da da da da

It was a thrill upon a hill (ooh)
Everybody was feelin' real (ooh)
Ooooh
(x2)

They were still gettin' down came daylight
Been funkin' most ever since midnight

Ooh, ooh ooh

When day came they wasn't slowing
Feeling it's awfully late would wait
Mmm, be about
You would not believe how they partied
Da da da da

Do that stuff, just do that stuff
Do that stuff, ahh do that stuff
(x2)

Da da, da daaa da
Da da da da

Do that stuff, just do that stuff
Do that stuff, ahh do that stuff
(x2)

Da da, da daaa da
Da da da da
(x2)

I want to go back and get
More of that funky stuff
I got to get some more of that
More of that funky stuff
(x2)

Do that stuff, just do that stuff
Do that stuff, ahh do that stuff
(x2)

It was a thrill upon a hill (ooh)
Everybody was feelin' real (ooh)
Ooooh
(x2)

Do that stuff, just do that stuff
Do that stuff, ahh do that stuff
(x2)
