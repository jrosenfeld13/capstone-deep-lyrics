I'd just like to reverse the roles just for a day or forever
It'd be a day to remember
Where you'd get a chance to taste your blood so heartless
See the torture through the eys of the perdetermined dead
Murder is a family value in almost every home
Murder is a family value three times a day
Beaten senseless to a bloody mess
Burned alive and completely drowned to death
Feel the fear
Taste the pain
Take the guilt to your grave
Throat cut ear to ear
Suffocate
There's no waking up from this nightmare
Bare witness to this nightmare
I'd just like to reverse the roles just for a day or forever
It'd be a day to remember
You can watch your loved ones meet their maker
Single filed death march
You would sing a different tune if this happened to you
Murder is a family value in almost every home
Murder is a family value three times a day
There will be no more blood the day (the day) injustice dies
