[Verse 1]
Hunt me out, seek me out, bring your best
That's how I want it to be
Full of doubt, full of fear, all's unclear
It's over, cause now I can see
Like a tank, seething strength, crushing all
Pulling you under my threads
Lost some years, lost some days, that's O.K
I piss on what's in my way

[Chorus]
Two-faced abusing, mindless confusion, resolution
I feel I'm breathing my first breath
Manipulation, dying salvation, you'll never rest
You can't kill what's stronger than death
Two-faced abusing, mindless confusion, resolution
I feel I'm breathing my first breath
Manipulation, dying salvation, you'll never rest
You can't kill what's stronger than death

[Verse 2]
Looked inside, found myself, it was me
Waiting there at the well
If you're green, you ain't seen life's a game
Sometimes it's just hard to tell
Gouging eyes, breaking bones, eating flesh
Puts a smile on my face
Crawling through glass, eating nails, losing blood
All part of finding your place

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Death, death, death, death
