Dawn is slowly breaking, our friends have all gone home
You and I are waiting for Santa Claus to come
There's a present by the tree, stockings on the wall
Knowing you're in love with me is the greatest gift of all

The fire is slowly fading, chill is in the air
All the gifts are waiting for children everywhere
Through the window I can see snow begin to fall
Knowing you're in love with me is the greatest gift of all

Just before I go to sleep, I hear a church bell ring
Merry Christmas everyone is the song it sings
So I say a silent prayer for creatures great and small
Peace on earth, good will to men is the greatest gift of all
Peace on earth, good will to men is the greatest gift of all
