My babys back, dressed in black
Silver buttons all down her back
High hose, tippy toes
She broke the needle, now she can sew

Walking the dog, just a-walking the dog, yeah
Well, if you don't know how to do it, I'll show you how to walk the dog, come on

Mary, Mary, 
How does your garden grow ?
Pussy cat, little bells and cockle shells
Pretty maids all in a row

Walking the dog, just a-walking the dog, yeah
Well, if you don't know how to do it, I'll show you how to walk the dog, come on

Yeah, walkin, just just just a-walkin
Yeah, walkin, just just just a-walkin
Well, if you don't know how to do it, I'll show you how to walk the dog, come on

Mary, Mary, 
How does your garden grow ?
Pussy cat, little bell and cockle shells
Pretty maids all in a row

Walking the dog, just a-walking the dog, yeah
Well, if you don't know how to do it, I'll show you how to walk the dog, come on

Walking, walking, , walking, ju-ju-ju -ju -just a-walking
Well, if you don't know how to do it, I'll show you how to walk the dog
