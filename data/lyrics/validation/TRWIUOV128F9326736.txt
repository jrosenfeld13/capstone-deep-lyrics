I don't want to play your game
That everyone should be the same
I know who I am
Don't need your philosophy
It isn't any use to me
I know where I stand
In the ways of life and art
I trust the wisdom of my heart
I may stumble, I may fall
But I know that through it all
If to my own self I am true
Than I'm sure to make it through
It doesn't matter what you say
'cause' I know I'll be okay
I know who I am

I may not be your fantasy
Or what you think I'm 'sposed to be
Well I understand
But what you clearly fail to see
Is there's nobody else quite like me
In this wonderland
My luck begins with these two hands
'cause' nothing happens just by chance

[Chorus]
I'm courageous, I am kind, a contradiction in
Your mind, my sexuality belongs to no one else
But me, I believe that love's a choice
I trust the power in my voice

[Chorus]
