Break down a hundred year thing
Who says we are whispering?
Blue boys against the gray
Same cause for the same old pain

Sheriff don't you attack
Bad boy don't you look back
Get lost in your own ways
In time, you will find your wings

Who are you now?
Who were you back then?

Maybe the line is worn thin
What if we don't want to draw it again
Never say you can't or won't
Cross the border line of hundred year thing

Silence make your secret call
Call those who wish to fall
Under your wicked spell
If the truth dies then wisdom will kill us all

Trust in who you are
To see no borders again
