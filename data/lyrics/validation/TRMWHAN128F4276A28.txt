The glory of life (4x)
There are times when the world
Seems to fold under pressure of man
No one knows about the tears
In the rain that keep falling on us
Need to feel that the wind can change
In the home of the brave I believe

Chorus:
We can stand up and sing
The love thats within us will conquer in some way
Now were fighting to win
So hold on to this dream
For the glory of life
Glory of life
Throw a dime in the well
Make a wish and believe it comes true
Say a prayer, close your eyes
You will see all the wonders of life
I believe there will come a time
When the worldll start to shine in grace
Chorus
We stumble and we fall
We win and we lose
We welcome all the joy
And shed all the tears
So this is my song
For the glory of life
Glory of life
Chorus
Glory of Life
We can stand up and sing
Come on, say a prayer
Stand up and sing
For the glory of life
Glory of life
