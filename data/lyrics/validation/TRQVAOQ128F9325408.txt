[Verse 1]
She comes into this world now
She's walking my way this close to me
She brings the sun within her
And she gives everything to me

[Chorus]
She brings jews and flowers
She smiles and devours
She is the Poets dream
The Poets dream

[Verse 2]
I stand within her circle
And her braids reach down to touch me
She has the moon behind her
And she gives everything to me

[Chorus]
She brings jews and flowers
She smiles and devours
She is the Poets dream
The Poets dream

[Verse 3]
The world doesn't speak your name now
But you stand and whisper it to me
You have the stars within you
And you give everything to me

[Chorus]
She brings jews and flowers
She smiles and devours
She is the Poets dream
The Poets dream
