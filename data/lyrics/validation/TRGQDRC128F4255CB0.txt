Singing sweetly, she passed by me
She knew, it seemed
That sound, that song was troubling me

"Do tell"
(I don't know)
"Please, sir"
(Here we go...)

Sleepwalking, sleep, sleepwalking...

Last night I awoke to an opera house full of empty seats
Performing Einstein on the Beach
"You've stifled this too long and the dream inside is far too strong
You've got to, got to learn to let go. Let go!"

Open your lips, let out a song
Open your heart, and let it sing
Open your lips, let out a song
Open your heart, and let it sing

Hey! Let go!
Hey! Let go!
