We are here again, watching the bones gather
Collecting in the sands of the world
Nothing is sacred, no one is privileged
Shrouded by the smoke of war
The mortar of our countries
Is made with human bones
Watch as the architecture falls
Crumbling on the wealth of the old
Society is ruined by filth and greed
Are we falling apart?
Apathy, the most common ally
It filters through the streets
All encompassing, while we build faulty structures
Designed by those willing to let us die
I am not a victim, nor a coward to face the architect
