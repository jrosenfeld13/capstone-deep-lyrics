Can I wait when your mighty arms are all that's holding me?
Can I wait when everything is crashing down on me?
When life is too much to bear will I stay there?
I saved this dance for you. I wore my finest suit
I cleaned myself up and I memorized all the moves
Oh how I long for this song to play forever and forever more
Through it's duration I live, and you're the melody that I live for
But the song ends, and so plays the all too familiar last note
Leading so gracefully into the song that only I wrote
Whisked away, now holding onto a memory of the song I once knew
Complacent, yet remembering how I felt when I felt you
I'm new. I'm frail. I'm fragile...
So impressionable, yet so hard to change
Change me!
