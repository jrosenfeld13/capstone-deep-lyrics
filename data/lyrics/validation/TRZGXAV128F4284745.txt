Oh, young baby lovers kissing in the moonlight
Childhood sweethearts holding on so tight
Long forgotten dreams come back to make me blue
Love was there for me burning inside of you

I can't replace those sweet summer days of my life
Oh, and how I do remember
Falling Autumn leaves round you in September
Where did you go? Why did I let you down
What a fool I was to leave you and play around

I can't replace those sweet summer days of my life
(All those forgotten dreams)
Oh, they fall apart, so it seems
(Blessed life we toss aside)
Long, long ago, my true lover died
In a lot of ways, I had a lot of fun
But rock and roll days kept me on the run

I can't replace those sweet summer days of my life

[Instrumental]

I can't replace those sweet summer days of my life
(All those forgotten dreams)
Oh, they're falling apart, or so it seems
(Blessed life we toss aside)
Oh, long ago, my true lover died
In a lot of ways, I had a lot of fun
But rock and roll days kept me on the run

No, I can't replace those sweet summer days of my life

I can't replace those sweet summer days of my life
(Sweet, sweet summer days of my life)
Sweet rock and roll days
(Sweet, sweet summer days of my life)
(Sweet, sweet summer days of my life)
Bring 'em on back
(Sweet, sweet summer days of my life)
