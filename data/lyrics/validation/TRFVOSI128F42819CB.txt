We got married in a fever
Hotter than a pepper sprout
We been talkin' 'bout Jackson
Ever since the fire went out

I'm going to Jackson
I'm going to mess around
Yah I'm going to Jackson
Look out Jackson town

Go on down to Jackson
Go ahead and wreck yer hill
Go play yer hand, you big talkin' gal
And make a big fool of yerself

Get on to Jackson
Go comb yer hair
I'm gonna smoke Paul Jackson (yah?)
See if I care

I breeze into that city
People gonna stoop and bow
All them fellas gonna make me
Teach 'em what they don't know how

I'm goin' to Jackson
Turn my loose in my coat
I'm goin' to Jackson
Goodbye, that's all she want

They'll laugh at you in Jackson
I'll be dancin' on a pony keg
They'll lead you 'round town like a scolded hound
With your tail stuck between your legs

Yah, I'm goin' to Jackson
And that's a matter of fact
Well, get home to Jackson
Ain't never comin' back

We got married in a fever
Hotter than a pepper sprout
We been talkin' 'bout Jackson
Ever since the fire went out

I'm going to Jackson
I'm going to mess around
Yah I'm going to Jackson
Look out Jackson town

See, I'm going to Jackson
Look out Jackson town
