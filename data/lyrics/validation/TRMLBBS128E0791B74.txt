Do I ever wonder? You don't know
You'll never follow, and I'll never show
D'you see the water and watch it flow
And float an empty shell
And you think that I'm hiding from the island
You've a fault in your senses. Can you feel it now?

Time? What is that? I've no time to care
I've lived for a long while nearly everywhere
You will be taken, everyone, you ladies and you gentlemen
Fall and listen with your ears upon the paving stone
Is that what you hear? The coming of the sea?

Sea flows under your doors in London town
And all your defences are all broken down
You laugh at me on funny days, but mine's the slight of hand
Don't you know I am a joker, a deceiver?
And I'm waiting for the land
