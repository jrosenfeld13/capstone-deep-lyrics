I'm twisted in dreams
I won't forgive
Your secrets were safe so far
As i discovered lies
Firs it hurts, i'm going insane
I'm slamming against the grain

Where is the faith
Where is the trust
I'm under your spell
Forgive me i still believe
I'm under your spell

I damn you for taking bad advice
I guess your time was gone
As you want to burst my pride
Deep inside me i feel save
I'm slamming against the grain

Where is the faith
Where is the trust
I'm under your spell
Forgive me i still believe
I'm under your spell

Don't you think
I'm staying any longer
The price i payed, is much too high
Your great deal of mortality is over
