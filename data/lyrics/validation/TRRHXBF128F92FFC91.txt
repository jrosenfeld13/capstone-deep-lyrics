Something told me it was over (yeah) when I saw you and her talking
Something deep down in my soul said cry girl (cry girl)
When I saw you and that girl walking around whoo ooh

I would rather, I would rather go blind boy
Then to see you walk away from me now naw naw whoo ooh

So you see I love you so much that I don't wanna watch you leave me baby
Most of all I just don't
I just don't wanna be free naw whoo ooh, Woo oh
I was just, I was just, I was just sitting here thinking of your kiss
Of your warm embrace yeah
When the reflection in a glass that I held to my lips now baby
Revealed these tears that are on my face whoo ooh

And baby, and baby, baby I'd rather be blind boy
Then to see you walk away
Walk away from me yeah
And baby, and baby, baby I'd rather be blind boy
Then to see you walk away
Walk away from me yeah
