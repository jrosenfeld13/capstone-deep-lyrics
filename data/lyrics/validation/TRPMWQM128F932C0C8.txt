Finally close the door
You'd left open wide
Locked it for me inside
Lay me down
Count me out

Watch out it's on you
There's worse ways to see it baby
Set a fire and watch it burnin'
Come here sit next to me
I'll tell you about a dream

I'm looking out on the world
I see it through your eyes
Burn you down
Bury you

I tried to see it plain
There's worse ways of getting here
You don't hear me complainin'
I'll tell you of every dream
I'm holding for you and me

Look out now it's all new
Those colors are fading
Outside the wind is howlin'
Stop talkin', listen to me
I'll tell you of every dream
