I'm in need of someone today
I'm a cruiser
I'm a cruiser
Stop a while and listen to me
You and I can sit down for tea
I'm a cruiser
Oh baby, I'm a cruiser
When I see someone who's looking so fine
You can't believe I react every time
I scream, ooouuhh
You sexy thing
You are the finest thing I've seen today
I am so glad that you passed by my way
I'm a cruiser
Oh baby, I'm a cruiser
Yes, I'm taking you out to better believe I've got no doubts
I'm gonna get next to you if it's the last thing I do, I'm a cruiser!
Choosing everything I see!
(I'm a cruiser)
Ooh, you look so fine to me!
(I'm a cruiser)
Yeah yeah yeah, I'm a cruiser
When I see someone that I like
In a car or riding a bike
I'm a cruiser
I'm a cruiser
I think you are sexy and sweet
One hot date would be such a treat
I'm a cruiser
Oh baby, I'm a cruiser
Yes I'm in need of some band-aid today
