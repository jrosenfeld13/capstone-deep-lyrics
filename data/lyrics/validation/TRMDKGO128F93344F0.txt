From the first time I saw your face
Girl, I knew I had to have you
I wanted to wrap you with my embrance
Visions of your lovely face

All my love is for you
Whatever you want I will do
You're the only one I want in my life
For you I'll make that sacrifice

(CHORUS)
Let's chill and let's settle down
That's what I wanna do
Just me and you [x2]

I'm so happy to have you here
Standing right by my side
Is it a dream or reality?
If it's a fantasy, please don't wake me

All my love is for you
Whatever you want I will do
You're the only one I want in my life
For you I'll make that sacrifice

(CHORUS)
I want you to be by my side
You know I want you to be mine
It is no secret, you know how I feel
All I wanna do is just chill
Be mine for the rest of the night, baby
Now come on and let's ride
It is no secret, you know how I feel
All I wanna do is just chill

(CHORUS)
