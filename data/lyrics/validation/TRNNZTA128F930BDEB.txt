There are tears in your eyes every time I leave your side
I can't remember waking up, the thought of light helps the night pass on by

Here's a lonely place, wasted days and long goodbyes
Tell me everyone feels like this, the water's clear; no current here

You said you'd never go. Should have left me here on my own
I'm cold; you're white as snow. You should have left me here all alone
