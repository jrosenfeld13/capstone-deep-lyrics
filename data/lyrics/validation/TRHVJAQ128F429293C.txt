[Verse 1]
Weeds blow tall on the broken train tracks
Ruth B. draws, we're fixin' to get high
And we'll hit the bluffs
Find ourselves the same old rum

[Chorus]
Everybody says this place is beautiful
And you'd be so crazy to say goodbye
But everything's the same, this town is pitiful
And I'll be getting out
As soon as I can fly

[Hook]
Life goes by, on a Talihina sky

[Verse 2]
Hopped up boys looking for their trouble
Knocked up girls, they've all got their share
Ruth seems out her mind, swears she won't give in this time

[Chorus]
Everybody says this place is beautiful
And you'd be so crazy to say goodbye
But everything's the same, this town is pitiful
And I'll be getting out as soon as I can fly

[Hook]
Life goes by, on a Talihina sky
Life goes by, on a Talihina sky

[Chorus]
But everybody says this place is beautiful
And you'd be so crazy to say goodbye
But everything's the same, this towns grown pitiful
And I'll be getting out as soon as I can fly

[Hook]
Life goes by, on a Talihina sky
Life goes by, on a Talihina sky (x2)
