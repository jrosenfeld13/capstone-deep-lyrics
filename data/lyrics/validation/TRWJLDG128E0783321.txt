Girls, when you've got a good love who's gonna treat you right
But another guy offers you a better life
Right away you start to swoon
Because he offers you the moon
Tell me, is riches worth more than love & affection?
Don't be steered in the wrong direction 'cause
(A bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush) remember girls
(A bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush)
So hold onto what you've got

You're just losin' a love that's true
For a love that might last a day or 2
Why gamble when you have what you need?
You might be losing everything, girls
The grass looks greener on the other side
But you just might be taken for a ride 'cause
(A bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush) remember girls
(A bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush)
So hold onto what you've got

(instrumental)

Come on & tell me, is riches worth more than love & affection?
Don't be steered in the wrong direction 'cause
(A bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush) remember girls
(A bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush)
So hold onto what you've got

Just as sure as the wind will blow
Fellas will come & fellas will go
Makin' promises they vow to keep
But chances are you'll be left to weep, girls
So if you have a guy that's good to you
Hold on tight, it's the thing to do, 'cause
(A bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush) remember girls
(A bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush)
So hold onto what you've got

(repeat & fade):
Hold on, hold on girls
'Cause a bird in the hand is worth in the bush now
