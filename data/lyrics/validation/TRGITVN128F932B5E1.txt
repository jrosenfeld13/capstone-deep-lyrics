Take me by the hand, take me to your land
Far from everything, far from everything
Take me by the hand, take me to your land
Far from everything, far from everything, far

The soul is old, the body cold
Heart lies flat in all it's bloodless fold
Our faded sight, the constant night
From the people further from the light

Take me by the hand, take me to your land far from everything
Take me by the hand, take me to your land
Far from everything, far from everything, far
