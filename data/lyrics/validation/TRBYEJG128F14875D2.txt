Pack in tight and breath in more
We have reached the solid core
Well beyond the gore
All aglow and reaching for
The chalice that I pissed into
Cover up your sores
And turn in your rewards
And find out where your ride went
If I can't leave
Tight Up high across the cold lips
You're all routed on the same trip
I get paid to wreck the good ship
How could I name?
How could I name you all?
You got passed through all the filters
You get it put down on the same lists
I get paid to wreck the good ships
How could I name?
How could I name you all?
