I first met you hanging knickers on the line
From that moment on
I knew that there could only be one outcome
Me and you against the world forever
You had no folks and I'm just a joke
But we made a vow
That we would never sell each other out
A lie detector wouldn't make me doubt you

Now we know that it's us versus the world now
Me and you against the world now
Look up there in the sky now
See those stars well they're shining just for us
Hey now, me and you against the world now
Look up there in the sky now
See those stars well they're shining just for us

We hitched a ride that would turn out suicide
I had my '45 replica gun
I didn't think we'd ever need it
Didn't know he had a real one loaded
You went in first, took the worst
Couldn't hear me shouting you
To stop above the busy traffic passing by
We promised that together we would die

Now we know that it's us versus the world now
Me and you against the world now
Look up there in the sky now
See those stars well they're shining just for us
Hey now, me and you against the world now
Look up there in the sky now
See those stars well they're shining just for us

Spoken:
I went in next
Took a bullet in the chest
So I hit him with the only thing that was anywhere near me
A tin of baked beans and a woman's weekly
I grabbed the cash
Picked you up and made a dash
Didn't get too far
Made it to the parking lot
40 cops in front of us
Guess who got shot...

Lying there dying in each others arms
Oh you said to me
Don't worry about a thing my little sweetheart
We're together we shall never be apart
You took a chance on a loser like me
But you never let me down
And whether we're in Heaven or Hell
I know it's better than separate cells

Now we know that it's us versus the world now
Me and you against the world now
Look up there in the sky now
See those stars well they're shining just for us
Hey now, me and you against the world now
Look up there in the sky now
See those stars well they're shining just for us
