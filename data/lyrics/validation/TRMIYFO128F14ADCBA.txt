Fighting Jacks
Commons And Robbers
Welcome to the classroom every day
Where you can learn how to be a slave
So if your intent today is to
Decrease your mentality
You'll be ok
Got the darkest days criminal
Smile it's your last so let him go
Light our fires with gasoline
Throw away green paper sheets
Cuz we can

[Chorus]
Can we change today
Can i try another way
Kill my conscience
Kill my process
Kill my knowledge
Kill to show a better way
Spin partys are a way to control the mind
Willed myself it's not a state of mind
Borrow bathroom toiletries
Full of light you'll make good aim
We don't share
(tech no mission) has bought a chance with your soul
Welcome to shoe world where plastic flows
Rob your third world countries
Deny first world poverty
No way out
Change to show a better day
Change to cure a disease
Change to show that his face has got the courage
Yes it's rare

[Chorus]
Can we change today
[screaming] can i try another way
Kill my conscience
Kill my process
Kill my knowledge
Kill to show a better way
