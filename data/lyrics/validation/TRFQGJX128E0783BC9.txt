No
No
No
Into the defect
The reason
The source
Of all this
Misery
And extract it
Forever

What heals me kills me

I'm a natural assassin
A massacre in action
I've never known remorse
Or felt any compassion
This is my drug of choice
The reason demons rejoice
My rage remains a beast untamed

I bet you'll remember me now

Glutton
I am heartbreak and depression
Regret without redemption
A wounded animal
Afraid of my reflection
I am an epidemic
This is a crime of passion
The willing weak deserve defeat
The penance will be savage

I bet you'll remember me now
I bet you'll remember me now

Bi-polar
Self-abortion
Mind fuck
Can't escape
These chains
Of shame
I'm stuck
Swollen in the mud
Barely
Standing still
Hungry for the hunt
And the thrill
Of the kill

Come on
I've always been a shadow
Content with my disease
You'll never see it coming
'Cause you never notice me
Unload
Words are the remedy
Words are the remedy

What heals me kills me
What heals me kills me
What heals me kills me
What heals me kills me
What heals me kills me
What heals me kills me
What heals me kills me
What heals me kills me
What heals me kills me
The plague rages on

I've built myself out of ash and agony
I am ready
I
Am
I
I am my own creation, I am, self-made
I am my own creation, I am, self-made
I am my own creation, I am, self-made
Destroyers
I am I
A bone heals
A bruise fades
But art is forever
