So you wanna say goodbye
You know that's gonna make me cry
It doesn't even matter why
I want you to stay
And you know that time will tell
If you're meant for someone else
But I don't think
So there's no way
Someone could love you like me
And if you go there you'll see

If that's really what you want
If that's really what you've been looking for
If it's really what losing all we had before today
But if that was what you want
I'm gonna stand in your way

Gonna make you wanna love me like
Used to every single night
There's so much more that I could do
Maybe I didn't show you enough
But I'm not giving up

If that's really what you want
If that's really what you've been looking for
If it's really what losing all we had before today
But if that was what you want
I'm gonna stand in your way

Gonna scream, gonna shout, gonna hold my heart out
I will not let you go quietly
Coulda lock all the doors
Baby then you'll be sure
That you're wrong
And you won't wanna fight me anymore

If that's really what you want
If that's really what you've been looking for
If it's really what losing all we had before today
But if that's what you want
I'm gonna stand in your way

So you wanna say goodbye
You know that's gonna make me cry
I'm gonna stand in your way
I'm gonna stand in your way
