It's three o'clock in the mornin', babe
I can't even close my eyes
Three o'clock in the mornin', babe
I can't even close my eyes
Can't find my baby
And I can't be satisfied

Lord, I've looked all around me
My baby can't be found
I've looked around me
Ah, my baby can't be found
Ah, I can't find my baby
I'm goin' down to the ballroom ground

Since you left me, baby
I found out I was nothing but a fool
Since you left me, baby
I found out I was nothing but a fool
You once was good to me, woman
You gave me everything I desired
