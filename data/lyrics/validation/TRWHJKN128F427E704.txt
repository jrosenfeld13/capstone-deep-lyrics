Oh, Josephine
You re the only girl for me, Josephine
When you look you come my way
You're for me, oh, my Josephine

Oh, Josephine
I like your lips to press mine, Josephine
To have and hold you all the time
You're for me, oh, my Josephine

Why not tonight, Josephine?
I know that you're my queen
But when you go I will know
You're not my Josephine

Oh, Josephine, you're my pride
You're my joy, Josephine
What we've got I can't deny
You're for me, oh, my Josephine

Why not tonight, Josephine?
I know that you're my queen
But when you go I will know
You're not my Josephine

Oh, Josephine
I will love you till I die, Josephine
I'm not telling you a lie
You're for me, oh, my Josephine

Oh, Josephine, you're my pride
You're my joy, Josephine
What we've got I can't deny
You're for me, oh, my Josephine

You're for me, oh, my Josephine
You're for me, oh, my Josephine
