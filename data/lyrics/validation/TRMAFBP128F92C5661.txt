What about me baby
What about our house (house)
What about our home (home)
What about our family (family)
Yeah, yeah

Early one sunday morning
I woke to see my baby missing from bed (yes i did, yes i did)
And lying there on her pillow
It was a letter and it read (ooh girl yeah yeah)
We just don't talk like we used to
We just don't do things we used to do, no no
So i decided to just move on
Cause the bond we once shared is no longer strong
What about

What about our kids
What about our home
What about those dreams that we shared
Girl this isn't fair
What about our love
What about our joy
What about our dear family
Ooh, what about me

As i read on it just brought me down
And i questioned myself like where when how
She could leave me this way
She didn't fuss or complain
And i'm thinking she's fine
But she knew all the time
She would leave us behind
Broke that promise she lied
Now my kids teary eyed
Girl you could have compromised

What about our kids
What about our home
What about those dreams that we shared
Girl this isn't fair
What about our love
What about our joy
What about our dear family
Ooh, what about me

Why after all this time
What was on your mind
You didn't show a sign
You weren't happy girl
Now you crushed our world
And you let go everything

What about our kids
What about our home
What about those dreams that we shared
Girl this isn't fair
What about our love
What about our joy
What about our dear family
Ooh, what about me

What about our kids
What about our home
What about those dreams that we shared
Girl this isn't fair
What about our love
What about our joy
What about our dear family
Ooh, what about me

What about me
Yeah yeah
What about
What about
Said what about
What about me
What about our house
What about our kids
What about our family, yeah yeah
