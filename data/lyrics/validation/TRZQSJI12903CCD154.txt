[Verse 1]
Take a breath, take it deep
"Calm yourself," he says to me
If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun and count to three
Im sweating now, moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go

[Chorus]
And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said Im terrified, but Im not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (trigger, trigger, trigger,...)

[Verse 2]
Say a prayer to yourself
He says, "Close your eyes"
Sometimes it helps
And then I get a scary thought
That hes here, means hes never lost

[Chorus]
And you can see my heart beating
Oh, you can see it through my chest
Said Im terrified, but Im not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger

[Bridge]
As my life flashes before my eyes
Im wondering, will I ever see another sunrise?
So many wont get the chance to say goodbye
But its too late to think of the value of my life

[Chorus]
And you can see my heart beating
Ouh-oh, you can see it through my chest
Said Im terrified but Im not leaving, no
I know that I must pass this test
You can see my heart beating
Oh you can see it through my chest
Im terrified but Im not leaving, no no
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (trigger, trigger, trigger,...)
