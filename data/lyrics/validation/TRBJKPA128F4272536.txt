Written by B. Setzer

Diamonds and pearls, black silk stockings
In her own world when she's rockin'
She don't hang out with anyone else in the crowd

Stiletto heels on the dance floor
Does what she feels as the crowd roars
She doesn't care what anyone else thinks of her

My baby only cares for me
We're a ship in the night all alone on the sea
My baby only cares for me

Give her a wink, exchange glances
She doesn't give second chances
Hey loverboy, you ain't got nothin' she needs

Barons and earls would love to date her
Better you should know sooner than later
Hey, just one dance and you'll be caught in her trance

My baby only cares for me
We're a ship in the night all alone on the sea
My baby only cares for me

Silently waiting for love to explode on the scene
Secretly wishing for someone to sweep her away
What can I say? It could happen

Black caviar, champagne cocktails
Come as you are if all else fails
Hey, here's the thing, she's got the world on a string

My baby only cares for me
We're a ship in the night all alone on the sea
My baby only cares for me
