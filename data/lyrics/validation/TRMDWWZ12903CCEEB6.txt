[Intro]
I know you've been waiting, yeah
I've been watching you, yeah
I know you want to get up, yeah
Come on

[Chorus]
Everybody, come on, dance and sing
Everybody, get up and do your thing
Everybody, come on, dance and sing
Everybody, get up and do your thing

[Verse 1]
Let the music take control
Find a groove and let yourself go
When the room begins to sway
You know what I'm trying to say
Come on, take a chance
Get up and start the dance
Let the D.J. shake you
Let the music take you

[Chorus]
Everybody, come on, dance and sing
Everybody, get up and do your thing
Everybody, come on, dance and sing
Everybody, get up and do your thing

[Verse 2]
Let your body take a ride
Feel the beat and step inside
Music makes the world go around
You can turn your troubles upside down
Going to have to change your mind
Going to leave your troubles behind
Your body gets the notion
When your feet can make the motion

[Chorus]
Everybody, come on, dance and sing
Everybody, get up and do your thing
Everybody, come on, dance and sing
Everybody, get up and do your thing

[Bridge]
Dance and sing, get up and do your thing
Dance and sing, get up and do your thing
Dance and sing, get up and do your thing

[Interlude]
I know you've been waiting, yeah, yeah
I see you sitting there, I've been watching you
Across the room, yeah, yeah
I've been watching you, I see you sitting there by yourself
Yeah, yeah
Come on, come on, come on

[Chorus]
Everybody, come on, dance and sing
Everybody, get up and do your thing
Everybody, come on, dance and sing
Everybody, get up and do your thing

[Verse 3]
Let the music take control
Find a groove and let yourself go
When the room begins to sway
You know what I'm trying to say

[Chorus]
Everybody, come on, dance and sing
Everybody, get up and do your thing
Everybody, come on, dance and sing
Everybody, get up and do your thing
