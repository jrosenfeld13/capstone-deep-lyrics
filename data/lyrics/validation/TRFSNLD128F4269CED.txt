(Bonus track)

Weapons of steel, horses of thunder
He rides the wind, fighting the sin
Demons and ghosts, he pulls them under
He makes the laws and he will win

Lord of the magic twilight
King of the eternal flame
We're fighting right at your side
Against the creatures of hell

Holy Lord we will ride, straight to the light
We will stand together 'til the end of time
Beware creatures of hell, we will prevail
Riding on a comet for the final day

Loyal and brave, knights of the master
We won't forsake the holy land
Wise energy crosses our hearts
While the king touched our skin, ready to win

Lord of the magic twilight
King of the eternal flame
We're fighting right at your side
Against the creatures of hell

Holy Lord we will ride, straight to the light
We will stand together 'til the end of time
Beware creatures of hell, we will prevail
Riding on a comet for the final day

So we will fight the sins
Killing the tyrant and shedding his blood
To show the world
That the evil is dead for eternity

Holy Lord we will ride, straight to the light
We will stand together 'til the end of time
Beware creatures of hell, we will prevail
Riding on a comet for the final day
