Hey little girl if you knew
About all the things Id say to you
Would you stay or change your mind
Cause I gotta gotta make you mine
And all the things that I would say
Would prove I cant go on this way
I need your love all the time
So I gotta gotta make you mine
And I dont know just what to do
If I dont make you all mine tonight
Hey little girl cant you see
That Im begging on my bended knees
For you to stay, dont change your mind
Cause I gotta gotta make you mine
I think that Im falling in love again
I said I never would, but now I see you and I think I should
Give it at least one more chance
