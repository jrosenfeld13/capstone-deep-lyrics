[Verse 1]
You've heard it said a thousand times
But only heard his Broadway lines
So, baby, please go
Ain't, ain't part of the show

'Cause when Romeo needs no cue or prompt
The likelier your little heart be stomped
By, by baby don't go
Written, written into his show

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause in the West End show, your life
Played understudy to every part
Got given all the dullest lines
Whilst the chorus girls danced on your heart

[Chorus]
Baby, please go
Baby, please go
Baby, please go
Baby, please go

[Verse 2]
The sorry tale we'd all applaud
That only dripped and never poured
But, baby just go
Let him, let him on with his show

The leading snail leaves tell tale lines
The bullshit tower the loudest chimes
But, baby please go
Ain't, ain't part of the show

[Pre-Chorus + Chorus]

[Bridge]
Romantic love lines that we adored
Baby, forget them
They were read by men from idiot board
Baby, forget them

So a message from the wisest guy to broad
Is best like flattery ignored...

[Outro]
Baby, just let him go
Let him on with the show
Baby, just let him go
Let him on with the show...
