[Intro: Fan Girl]
OMG, did you hear I'm dating a Jonas Brother?
It's so hot!

[Verse 1: Joe Jonas]
You met in work, you should've known better
It's gonna suck when the camera stops rolling
And you'll find out soon that the treatment wasn't worth it
They're all the same, they all want the money
They're all insane, they live for fame, honey
They laugh at you when you're not even being funny

[Pre-Chorus 1: Nick Jonas]
Well, I've been here before
And I've seen firsthand and front row seat
This little thing they call a video girl

[Chorus: Joe Jonas + Nick Jonas]
Video girl rocked my world for a whole two seconds
And now I know I'm not about to be another victim
Of the video girl syndrome
Get out of my face, get out of my space
Get some class and kiss the past
Cause I'm not about to be another victim
Of the video girl syndrome

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
You know it's bad when your mama doesn't like her

[Pre-Chorus 2: Nick Jonas]
Well, I've been here before
And I've seen firsthand and front row seat
What happens to a man when he gets in the hands of a

[Chorus: Joe Jonas + Nick Jonas]
Video girl rocked my world for a whole two seconds
And now I know I'm not about to be another victim
Of the video girl syndrome
Get out of my face, get out of my space
Get some class and kiss the past
Cause I'm not about to be another victim
Of the video girl syndrome

[Bridge: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
You are never gonna see me miss her
Video girl syndrome
I'm not gonna be another victim
Of the video girl syndrome

[Chorus: Joe Jonas + Nick Jonas]
Video girl rocked my world for a whole two seconds
And now I know I'm not about to be another victim
Of the video girl syndrome
Get out of my face, get out of my space
Get some class and kiss the past
Cause I'm not about to be another victim
Of the video girl syndrome
