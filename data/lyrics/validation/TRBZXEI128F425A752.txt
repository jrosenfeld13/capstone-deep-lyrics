[Verse 1]
This sure is some kind of party
It's so useful
Surround my life with excuses
For what I choose to lose
And my name
Doesn't look the same to me, now now, no no not me now
And inside
Don't you know I feel so bad, yeah yeah

[Chorus]
When I tried to turn away
To feel new again (Candy)
My emotion cost me pain
Did I look the same? (Candy)
When I think about the times
That I laughed away (Candy)
The idea you'd cheat me but look again
What'd you say? "That's my name"

[Verse 2]
And I hope that I've kept you amused
To wipe that spit right off my boots
And when I'm home and thinking in the dark
I hope that none of this has had to go too far
When it gets too late
To see me any other way
And it gets so hard to hold on
To everything that I want so bad, yeah yeah

[Chorus]
(Candy)
When I tried to turn away
To feel new again (Candy)
My emotion cost me pain
Did I look the same? (Candy)
When I think about the times
That I laughed away (Candy)
The idea you'd cheat me but look again
What'd you say? "That's my name"
