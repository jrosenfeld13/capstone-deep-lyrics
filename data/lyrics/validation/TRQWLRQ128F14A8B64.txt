[Verse 1]
I heard about the Easter bunny
Presents under a Christimas tree
It was dreaming and fantasy
There was no Mom or Daddy

[Chorus]
I wanted everything[x3]
I had the world on my shoulder

[Verse 2]
But I was getting older
Knew I was ready for it
Some kind of employment

[Chorus]
I wanted everything[x3]

[Verse 3]
All day working on a truck
Bringing the groceries up
Not much of a salary
No tip for the delivery

[Chorus]
I wanted everything[x3]
There's no success for me

[Verse 4]
Involved in a robberry
There's money in the supermarket
And I'm going after it
I wanted everything
