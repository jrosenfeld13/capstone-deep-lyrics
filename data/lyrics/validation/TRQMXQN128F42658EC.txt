Sometimes like a dream you come cut
From the same cloth
The light in your palm so white I feel it in my heart
Horse hoof imprint on the saddle back bare hide of
A horse
You come with steam of breath and Caligula's's head
To me so lonesome and longing and so unsatisfied
Even with all this beauty flooding deep into my eyes
Stop for a moment and listen to the wind
See the trees, leaves the sun they catch and
Their rustling din

(Chorus)
Breathe deep fill up with relief don't go mad
Don't go mad
Breathe deep fill up with relief don't go mad
Don't go mad

Life is a long river learn from your past
I been reading my history to learn what the others
Have seen
Blood in the hollow of my heart
Sweat on the skin of my chest
Run a little bit faster now and breath a little deeper

(Chorus)
Come to me come to me set me free
Jack ass ginger, jack ass ginger
Come to me come to me set me free
Jack ass ginger, jack ass ginger

Looking for a structure to call my own
I reached down my throat
And grabbed my rack of bones
Looking for a structure to call my own
I grabbed my rack of bones
I grabbed my rack of bones

Cut by a blade of grass fell slain by a drop of rain
Lay fallow fallen 40 feet onto pastures of catastrophe
Sucked out set adrift at sea
Floor board decked out with uncertainty
In open doldrums oceans of unknowable emotions

(Chorus)
Just before the end a great efflorescence
A plead to the will of the sea
A great soul collective
Painters pile paint upon paint
Losing themselves to get what they see
Enshrouded in a cocoon of doom
And then set free

(Chorus)
