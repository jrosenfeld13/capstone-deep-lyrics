Here comes The Black Horse
There goes The Brown Cow
Full of ringers of course
Thrown up from The Plough
The hoops and the stripes
The halves and the quarters
The Sunday morning rain
The touchline refrain

Hes on the roids
Hes on the roids
Hes on the roids
Hes on the roids
Just walk away John, come on
Just walk away John, come on
Just walk away John, come on
Just walk away John because
Hes on the roids
Hes on the roids

Its Lees twenty-first
But theyre not coming in
Because Bruiser McHuge
Declares them too thin
Annoyed and upset
They head for elsewhere
They normally argue the toss
But besides being boss
Hes on the roids
Hes on the roids
Hes on the roids
Hes on the roids
Just walk away John, come on
Just walk away John, come on
Just walk away John, come on
Just walk away John because
Hes on the roids
Hes on the roids

He used to lark with the dreads
Now hes a nark on the steds
He used to lark with the dreads
Now hes a nark on the steds
He used to lark with the dreads
Now hes a nark on the steds
He used to lark with the dreads
Now hes a nark on the steds

His paranoia is absurd
Are you thinking about my bird?

Hes on the roids
Hes on the roids
Hes on the roids
Hes on the roids
Just walk away John, come on
Just walk away John, come on
Just walk away John, come on
Just walk away John because
Hes on the roids
(Leave it be, let it go)

(Dont be daft, dont you know)
Hes on the roids
(Leave it be, let it go)
Hes on the roids
(Dont be daft, dont you know)
Hes on the roids
(Leave it be, let it go)
Hes on the roids
