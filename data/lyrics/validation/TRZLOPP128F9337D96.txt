Yo, Kadence and Dabrye. Abolitionist Crew! Watchu wanna do?

Catch me above the abyss, let's begin at zero
I'm rather attracted to tracks, move to act like a black superhero
Able, connected to the collectivist mind-streams, lines are cold, eyes and nose make elementary rhyme schemes from the chattel of slave owners
Battle rap personas emerge to symbolic scourge of urban crack corners
Through honest eyes, I commentize, commodified, who wants to rob us?
Yo, these niggas' brains is fried
Dissociated like Jekyll and Hide, and their lives are entertaining for the ethnic rewind
World syndicated into consumer bulimic design, they only recognize the value of signs/Sweatshop, midriff top, seasonal fashion statements, baggy denim with the inside crotch that holds Glock
(Catch a nigga, cop is hot (?), freedom of choice)
Take a camera crew down to the ghetto and see 'em rejoice
I'ma keep spittin' this shit until people internalize it, it's all a matter of what you subjectively circumscribe
Tinted vision through designer sunglasses you hide behind at night
Signifier of the colonized mind
Shit's colder than dry ice in your science class
Verbal temperature, shatter fake fucks like candy glass
Out of the play on words comes the archetype tricks
To the weight of this truth-dropper leaves a spike on the Richter
But, me? I'm just another rap cat, kickin' abstract flows encoded with mad facts for you to grasp at
Not for those enclosed in a Halley Moore consciousness, soon to implode on a financial fast-track
A verse with the thirst to devour the other, delight at the Sun against the smoke of the burning Earth
At the doors of power, yo, don't hate the player, hate the game! Cuz he ain't greedy, he's just tryna do a service, all the same, that's why he changed the name
Now it's ambitious to want riches, fuck the third world, yo, we're V.I.P. with braindead bitches
Here's a lecture for your new semester:
The Emcee, once a prophet, gradually reduced to the role of a court jester
So, from the start to the finish, his wisdom slowly diminishes, in the eyes of the innocents, further will of the iron fist, tryna twist the image of the prophet to blemish it
Restricting the innocents' freedom, disrupting their inner sense
Breathe easy, y'all, it's all analogical, peep it, or let your ignorance be an obstacle
Can a rapper be socio-philosophical and still affect y'all? Is it possible?
