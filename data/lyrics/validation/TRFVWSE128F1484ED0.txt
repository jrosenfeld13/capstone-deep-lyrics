God, lead your soul to them
All way past the rain
Like when I was a song in a man
God, lead your time to them
All way past the planes
Like when I was a song in a man

Witches in my swimming pool
Devils are in my brother's room
How long till God knows that?

Crime comes to them like a worried vein
Girls get married like they live in vain
How long till God knows that?

Dragons don't sleep at night
They live in transaction from copied light
They don't spend time with no regular
They spike all friends 'cause they speak a lie

How can I be calm?
On my mind
And how can I keep time?
On my mind
Keep your head up

Dragons don't sleep at night
They live in transaction from copied light
They don't spend time with no regular
They spike all friends 'cause they speak a lie

And how can I be calm?
On my mind
And how can I keep time?
On my mind
How can I be calm?
You're in my mind
How can I be calm?
How can I be calm?
How can I be calm?
How can I be calm?
How can I be calm?
You're in my mind
Keep your head up
