[Verse 1]
Its hard and uneasy
Living in this skipped over town
Once was called a music city
Since then its been scaled down
The oil that once was pavement
The mud that once was brick
Engulfs the gossamer river
Like hot wax on a wick

[Chorus]
What once was gray is now grayer
What once was cloudy is gone
The streets are all layered
With discarded honky tonk songs
Discarded honky tonk songs

[Verse 2]
Everyone fears the color scarlet
With a misguided prejudice
They all point their crooked little fingers
At the high school reading list

[Chorus]
What once was gray is now grayer
What once was cloudy is gone
The streets are all layered
With discarded honky tonk songs
Discarded honky tonk songs
