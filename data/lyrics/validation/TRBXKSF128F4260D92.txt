It almost seems laughable
Shouldn't be this hard
I built you this monument
Soldiers standing guard

Rainy night in Washington
The buildings look so proud
Fed upon your every whim
Like manna from above

Hand me down my walking cane
Hand me down my shoes
It's my gain to win
It's my gain to lose

I kept you my confidence
Although I slowly sank
Jealousy and misery
From which we deeply drank

Now I'm off to Philadelphia
On the eve of what's to come
This old boy's got the d.c. blues
They've got me on the run

Hand me down my walking cane
Hand me down my shoes
It's my gain to win
It's my gain to lose

Hand me down walking cane
Hand me down my shoes
It's my gain to win
It's my gain to lose
It's my gain to win
It's my gain to lose
