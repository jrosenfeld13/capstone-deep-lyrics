[Intro: Solomon Childs]
What, uh-huh, (this is not a game)
For real, Killa Beez is the style

[Chorus: Solomon Childs]
2000, ultimate thug music (Body Brighton, throw up ya hands and get money)
2000, ultimate thug music (Park Hill, throw up ya hands and get money)
2000, ultimate thug music (Now Born, throw up ya hands and get money)
2000, ultimate thug music (Worldwide, Solomon Childs is gettin' money)

[Solomon Childs]
It's a fascination, get it done veteran style
I want the money, so I move a veteran style
Universal master, I'm takin' over
Miles per hour, five hundred, Ironman style, in Daytona
I shock the world, sharkskin shopper, R&B chicks gassed off the Yofa
Silver bracelets in cab fares, heavy metal rats
MTV Jams, Killa Bamz, El Dorado red
I be pimped out, '79 Starsky, imperial aqua green valor
Face to face, Solomon Childs, Godfather, gorilla warfare author
Take shots of Louie the 13th, New York City (come on!)
K-Tone specialist, rock a red-eyed jeep
Heard me, throw up ya hands and get money
Throw up ya hands and get money, what

[Chorus: Solomon Childs]
2000, ultimate thug music (Stapletown, throw up ya hands and get money)
2000, ultimate thug music (Jungle Nilz, throw up ya hands and get money)
2000, ultimate thug music (The Port, throw up ya hands and get money)
2000, ultimate thug music (Worldwide, Solomon Childs is gettin' money)

[Solomon Childs]
Still in the club bent up, one twenty salute
Militant troops, fifth's under car seats and coups
Golden Era, half a mill in my eyes, declare war
Solomon'll spit hardcore, rock watts, veteran style like Freddie Foxxx
V now flippin', like the E.R. you create visions
Liver than John Woo, my performance: Bruce Willis, Die Hard II
Rhymes come Caesar, like Shane, lyrics for the Y2K
Paragon, show me the money, thugged out like Roshown
Broadway and Henderson premiere, pioneer King of New York (come on)
Ski mask rap, black gloves, gorilla thug, death before dishonor
Pimpin' in Cancun wit Cappadonna, what ya smilin' for God, ain't nothin' funny
Throw up ya hands and get money

[Chorus: Solomon Childs]
2000, ultimate thug music (Trench runners, throw up ya hands and get money)
2000, ultimate thug music (B-Bonics, throw up ya hands and get money)
2000, ultimate thug music (Ron Montana, throw up ya hands and get money)
2000, ultimate thug music (Worldwide, Solomon Childs is gettin' money)

[Solomon Childs]
Supreme alphabet mathematics, I sincerely love Allah's mathematics
Universal new born mathematics, born legendary
You cats fake flossin', see '74 mob now style
Poverty sparks the gun powder, inferno refined power
Hated by the games no more, talkin' like a wild boar
I drama, millennium, let all polic' in, general Solomon red blend
Underground greed, forever we scheme, spit like a God-U-Now
This is what a thug about, marksmen, criminalized tones
Spit gem stone, caveman, supreme M.C., get Superb like the Cream Team
Eloheim, two thousand, eloheim, cliffhanger part two
Markham Home's Park, King of New York

[Chorus: Solomon Childs]
2000, ultimate thug music (Shaolin, throw up ya hands and get money)
2000, ultimate thug music (New York City, throw up ya hands and get money)
2000, ultimate thug music (Real thugs, throw up ya hands and get money)
2000, ultimate thug music (Worldwide, Solomon Childs is gettin' money)

[Outro: Solomon Childs]
Yeah, that's the way that it is
And that's the way that it's gonna be
Bottom line
