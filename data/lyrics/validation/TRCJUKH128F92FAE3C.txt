The gypsies know my future
The angels know my past
I roll around this big wide world
To find a love to last
I'm weary from my wandering
Lord I'm wounded in a war
I'll lay me low where the willows grow
Listen to that river song
River runs by my window
River runs by my door
River runs so sweet
Might never roam no more
Might never roam no more
I've seen the stars falling on the mountains
I've seen the moon rising from the sea
I never ever saw a sight so sweet
As that woman in my arms asleep
They say that honey heals the body
They say that music can soothe the soul
I've learned the heart has reasons
That reason can not know
River runs by my window
River runs by my door
River runs so sweet
Might never roam no more
Might never roam no more
I don't know where that river roams
But she goes around the bend
Just might roll around the great wide world
Come on home again
River runs by my window
River runs by my door
River runs so sweet
Might never roam no more
Might never roam no more
