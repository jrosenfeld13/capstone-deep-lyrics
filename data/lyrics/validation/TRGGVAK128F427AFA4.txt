So am I
Good or bad
The way that things did turn out
I did only make you sad

And we cried and we cried
On the phone
Oh but in my mind
You were never that all alone

Oh you were majesty
Your roads were heavy
And your longing was cut from bone

So am I
Am I good or bad
Could only awake your anger
I could only make you mad
Now was that how you showed me
That you were still so young and bold
Anyway those fights did drive me
And I was dying of thirst and I wasn't growin' old

Oh you were majesty
Your ropes were heavy
And your roads were very cold
Oh, oh, oh majesty

But in my mind
I could still climb inside your bed
And I could be victorious
Still the only man to pass to the glorious arch of your head, o-oh

Oh you were majesty
Your ropes were heavy
And your cheeks were very red

Oh you were majesty
And it's like I said
That spirit, is now dead

Oh, oh, oh Majesty
