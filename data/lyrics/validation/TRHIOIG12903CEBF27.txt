If you're lonely
You never show a sign
No devotion could ever change your mind
No illusion when your work is done
Nobody knows you

CHORUS
Samurai samurai
Did you ever dream
Hesitate wonder why
At all the anger you have seen
Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh
Samurai samurai
Does your blood run cold
No light shines in your eyes
No burning flame in your soul
Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh

Your commission was written in the sand
No emotion could ever stay your hand
No consolation no word of love or praise
Your fight is over

REPEAT CHORUS TWICE
