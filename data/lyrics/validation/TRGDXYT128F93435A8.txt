Where's that angel with dirty knees
Who wasn't hard to please when we first met?
She don't act like she needs me now
And she don't even seem to be upset
Maybe I cover too much ground
I've been from town to town since I grew up
Could my dreams take up too much space?
I'll never find a place that's big enough

The chairs go up on the bar now
And the table lights go black
So I order one last double and start calling people back

Marc sounds good, he's been working hard
Couldn't punch a card to save his life
Says he's glad that he quit the road
He says he's getting old, he missed his wife
Little Em's been asleep since nine
I'm sure she's doing fine, she always is
Dad won't answer his phone at night
But I guess that's alright, the place is his

The chairs are up on the bar now
And they're asking me to leave
So I give the girl a bill and start rolling down my sleeves

In my pocket directions back across the railroad tracks
To where I crash
Maybe I should wave down a car
I won't be going far, and I have cash
Think I blocked just a park away
But I can't really say, it's been all night
How I wish you would call me here
But you just disappeared, it wasn't right

And the streetlights help a little
But they're barely half alive
I don't feel much like walking and I sure as hell can't drive

Close your eyes and remember this:
It won't be back again, it's almost gone
Even times that don't seem like much
Will be your only crutch when you're alone
Time moves slow when you're seventeen
And then it picks up steam at twenty-one
Pretty soon you'll remember
When you could remember when you loved someone
