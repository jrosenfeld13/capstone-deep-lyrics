This would be easier if you'd understand
Face the truth and realise that none of this was planned
The way we worry about such little things
Take a time to take the break
Darling spread your wings
I stole all the roses that make your crown
Now it's easier
To just put aside the things that face us now

Strange how something comes from nothing
I came around to your way
Of thinking about these things
Saw your face in a crowd
I knew that you were special
And it will change my world
If I could help you now

But nothing's gonna change your mind
And no one's gonna help you now
If nothing's gonna change your mind
Then no one's gonna help you find
Your place in this world
So strange we don't need a help you know

Let's dance to the beat of the drum
Let's go out, where we don't know anyone
Cause it's you, I don't need anyone else
I got you, I don't need anyone else but you

Well you know where you will find me
Anytime, anyplace
The world feel so strange
I like to feel there's a chance
Just knowing that I love you
You will feel every beat
Enough to make you change

But nothing's gonna change your mind
And no one's gonna help you now
If nothing's gonna change your mind
Then no one's gonna help you find
Your place in this world
So strange we don't need a help you know

Let's dance to the beat of the drum
Let's go out, where we don't know anyone
Cause it's you, I don't need anyone else
I got you, I don't need anyone else but you

And no one could ask for more

But nothing's gonna change your mind
And no one's gonna help you now
If nothing's gonna change your mind
Then no one's gonna help you now, now, now...
