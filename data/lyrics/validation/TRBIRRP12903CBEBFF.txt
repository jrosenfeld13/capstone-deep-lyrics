I know no woos
I know you're no fools
We're in love with the beautiful game with no shame
That's cool, true, but jump in the queue
Complete time brothers with the peak time tools
Can't hide
Caught offside
Down with the art and the pride
I know you got soul
I know you can eat my goal
Cos us be a gratue i've been told
In the nick of time, nick of time
Make a fine rhyme sick of mine
Given up the possibility to resign
Making out i know something you don't
Making out you'd cope with a joke but you won't
Admit to being a big tooth
Spoon full of rapture, rhymes as it hits you
May or may not be amused
No ask me cos me plain bemused
Say Ho (ho)
Say Ho wo (ho wo)
Say Eat my goal (eat my goal)
Say eat my goal (eat my goal)
Say Ho (ho)
Say Ho wo (ho wo)
Say Eat my goal (eat my goal)
Say eat my goal (eat my goal)
Looking for a saviour to save ya
From a lack of knowledge
This little fella won't get you through college
Yeah knowledge is fine, but the party's mine
No no ask me about summer so
Let everybody in the house say disco
Got things to say all about having nothing to say
I never have my way
The new part team of mum won't move into ma home
To play sport and to forget to call their mums on the telephone
Use some bass, lower the tone, lower the tone
Don't ask me cos me not know
Serious question spoken in a joke
And with the mind of a lesser spotted bloke
That won't make you choke
Say Ho (ho)
Say Ho wo (ho wo)
Eat my goal (eat my goal)
Say eat my goal (eat my goal)
Say Ho (ho)
Say Ho wo (ho wo)
Eat my goal (eat my goal)
Say eat my goal (eat my goal)
Say Ho (ho)
Say Ho wo (ho wo)
Eat my goal (eat my goal)
Say eat my goal (eat my goal)
Say Ho (ho)
Say Ho wo (ho wo)
Eat my goal (eat my goal)
Say eat my goal (eat my goal)
