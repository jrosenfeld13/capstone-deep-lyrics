[Verse 1]
Tell me how long until all of this breaks me
'Cause I always knew that this was ending
Everything that I tried to keep from falling
(And now it's down) It's down, it's down

[Chorus 1]
Inside my head where the world is spinning round
I am begging you, please, let me go away

[Verse 2]
Tell me why can't you make yourself release me
'Cause I always knew that this would take me underneath
Everything that I tried to keep is drowning
And now it's down (it's down, it's down)

[Chorus 2]
Inside my head where the world is spinning round
I am begging you, please, let me go away
(I never knew that I was down)
For so long before the world was spinning round
I am begging you, please, let me go away

{Bridge]
(Down!) We are the victims now (x2)
'Cause we are falling...
Apart again (Down!)

[Verse 3]
Tell me how long until all of this breaks me
'Cause I always knew that this would kill me
Everything that i tried to keep from losing
(And now it's down) it's down, it's down

[Chorus 2]
Inside my head where the world is spinning round
I am begging you, please, let me go away
(I never knew that I was down)
For so long before the world was spinning round
I am begging you, please, let me go away

[Chorus 3]
Inside my head where the world is spinning round
(Away!) Let me go away

[Outro]
(Down!) We are the victims now (x2)
