It's as big or if you want it
Too small for the eye to see
Dare you take a peek inside it
Forget yourself what can it be?
Things you know you shouldn't look at
Things you know you shouldn't see
Things my dad couldn't explain
And things that others kept from me

It could be places you've not been
Or something of which you're ashamed
Sometime when you took the credit
Another when you look the blame

It's in your head and in your heart
It's everywhere you can see
C'mon kids and smash the lock
Reach within and find the key
Crawl inside and leave the rest behind
C'mon now, look in the box and see whatcha got
