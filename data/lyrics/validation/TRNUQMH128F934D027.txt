Wait...we'll have to wait our turn
We'll have to fall in line
Follow, live, love and die
If we're all the same, get born, grow, married and die
End it now
We all hate long good byes
So don't bother and just die

If we're all the same
What do we do when it all dies and we're all left here...all alone
We always lose signt of everything
Where did we come from...and why are we here

Wait...we'll have to accept the change
I have a mission, I have a goal that's why
Even though we're all still the same
Follow, live, love and die

We have one chance, one life, one death, one time to smile
I'd rather live now then die knowing we only have one chance
One time to try, one time to die, one time to smile
So hold on.We all die one at a time
