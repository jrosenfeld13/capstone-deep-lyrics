Hark now hear a man is calling
Looking for a story line
Go along just for the effort
I went along just for a good time

It doesn't look like it would kill you
But it doesn't really thrill you

It looked candid
But he planned it

I'm the shortest line to the upper crust
I'm the only lying one to trust
What's the message for the wreckers, please?

It doesn't seem like it will make you that much closer to a breakthrough
It is splendid
It is opportunity misrepresented

You with the flashlight under your chin
You may wear the pants, but I...the grin

Hark now here a man is calling
Looking for a storyline
I went along just for the effort
I went along just for a good time

It didn't look like he would bend it
When I decided to lend it out

Was it candid?
Did he plan it?

And you with the flashlight under your chin
You may wear the pants, but I...the grin

The grin

Everybody thinks it's a holiday
Everybody thinks it's a holiday
Everybody thinks it's a holiday
Everybody thinks it's a holiday
