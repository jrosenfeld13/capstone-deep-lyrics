Silver bells silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

City sidewalks busy sidewalks 
Dressed in holiday style
In the air, there's a feeling
Of Christmas
Children laughing, People passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on ev'ry street corner you'll hear

Silver bells silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring a ling hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

Strings of street lights
Even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush
Home with their treasures

Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all this bustle

You'll hear Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

Christmas day is almost here
I take the time to breathe the air
The bells ring out to us about how
Love was born this day

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
(Repeat for the rest of the song.)
