Walkin' through the city
Was as lonely as could be
I'm wanderin' in the night-time out in search of company
I feel real isolation
When all around me life
Familiar but unfriendly
Unfriendly with no choice
And, I can see the evil
But I can feel the good
Shining out to greet me
From within bone and blood
I'm throwin' off this loneliness
I can't stick it anymore
Only need myself tonight to open up that door
And I know that sometimes it gets so bad
But you're not on your own so don't be sad
'Cos if you feel real bad then you're not on your own tonight
Please don't be so sad 'cos you're not on your own tonight
Oh yeah yeah yeah
You see I know the feelin'
Don't have to tell me nothin'
'Cos you know I know the feeling
Everybody seems to think it's they who bear the pain
They who bear the biggest cross
The loneliness and the shame
Day to day you suffer when you're livin' in your past
If you started livin' for the now you could free yourself at last
If you started living for the now, for yourself and those around
Experience and celebrate the freedom that you've found
You could free yourself forever, and live life as you should
The choice is yours to take now 'cos I've said all that I could
But I know that sometimes it gets so bad
But you're not on your own so don't be sad
'Cos if you feel real bad then you're not on your own tonight
Please don't be so sad 'cos you're not on your own tonight
Well if you feel real bad then you're not on your own tonight
Please don't be so sad 'cos you're not on your own tonight
Oh yeah yeah yeah
You see I know the feelin'
Don't have to tell me nothin'
You know I know the feeling
Well if you feel real bad then you're not on your own
Please don't be so sad 'cos you're not on your own
Tonight...
