[Intro]
Don't go, don't go, don't go

[Verse]
Baby, baby, baby
I'm lonely can't you see
Baby, baby, baby
Come give your love to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I'm just a prisoner
Don't set me free
Before you turn around
Take one look at me

[Chorus]
Take me in your arms
Won't you love me one more time
Take me in your arms
Won't you love me one more time
Before you go

[Verse]
Baby, baby, baby
Chained and bound, can't you see
Baby, baby, baby
Chained and bound, can't you see

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I'm just a prisoner
Don't set me free
Before you turn around
Take one look at me

[Chorus]
Take me in your arms
Won't you love me one more time
Take me in your arms
Won't you love me one more time
Before you go

[Sax Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I'm just a prisoner
Don't set me free
Before you turn around
Take one look at me

[Chorus]
Take me in your arms
Won't you love me one more time
Take me in your arms
Won't you love me one more time
Before you go

[Outro]
Baby, baby, baby
