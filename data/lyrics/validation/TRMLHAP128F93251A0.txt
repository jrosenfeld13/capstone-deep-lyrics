I use to get stoned on my sisters record collection
Gold and platinum on vinyl was the closest thing to perfection
Rock & roll, acoustic guitar
Not even comfortable with who you are
I'd blow the roof if I had a fast car

I changed my mind in my best friends El Camino
He blew my drums that summer night in El Reno
Turning up the STP, turning down the LSD
On a bottle of booze and the best of his cousins weed

What if I was the one that you warned me about
You were the one that needs to come around
We got together and we worked it out
No one would shut us down
If it all dried up and blew away
With a handful of checks on a rainy day
Would you turn around or would you stay
Would it matter anyway

What if I decided to take the nation
I'd break the knob just so I could feel the frustration
Yeah, turn it up til you hit top speed
Yeah, its all that I'll ever need
When you bear your heart
You better be prepared to bleed
