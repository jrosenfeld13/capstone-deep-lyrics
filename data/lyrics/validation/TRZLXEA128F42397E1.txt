Overrated

Someone got identity
And now you fake it
You created a chain
And I'd love to break it

Concepts you bite
Cause your identity ain't tight
Tryin' to be something you're
Not
Like pullin' a knife at a
Gunfight

I stick to my guns
And to my artillery
You are the boy who lacks
Creativity
But you still try hard to be

A motherfuckin' hero
But, both we know
You'll stay a zero
There you go... There you go...

I stick to my guns
I won't let it go
