[Verse 1]
I don't really know just where to start
It's harder when we're standing miles apart
If I could dream I'd paint a scene
But there is too much noise
When I can't sleep I need to hear your voice

[Chorus]
Would you sing to me
Would you sing to me
'Cause I can feel a part of me starting to break
And when you are away from me it's harder to breathe

[Verse 2]
I don't really know just where you are
It's harder when I'm here and I'm all alone
If I could sleep, it's you and me
This distance keeps me up
Come set me free I need to feel your touch

[Chorus]
Would you sing to me
Would you sing to me
'Cause I can feel a part of me starting to break
And when you are away from me it's harder to breathe

[Bridge]
Don't wake me up (when I can't sleep)
I really can't get enough (I need to hear your voice)

[Chorus]
Would you sing to me
Would you sing to me
'Cause I can feel a part of me starting to break
And when you are away from me it's harder to breathe
