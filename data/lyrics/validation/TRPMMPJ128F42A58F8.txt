There's so many things I like about you
I just don't know where to begin

Huh, okay, well...
I like the way you look at me with those beautiful eyes
I like the way you act all surprised
I like the way you sing along
I like the way you always get it wrong, hehehe
I like the way you clap your hands
I like the way you love to dance
I like the way you put your hands up in the air
I like the way you shake your hair
I like the way you like to touch
I like the way you stare so much

But most of all
Yeah
Most of all

I like the way you move!
I like the way you move!

I like the way you put your hands up in the air
I like the way you shake your hair
I like the way you like to touch
I like the way you stare so much

But most of all
Yeah
Most of all

I like the way you move!
