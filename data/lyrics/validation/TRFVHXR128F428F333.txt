Hey yo Shek', Kandi they ain't ready for us
Let's go

I was hanging out with my girls fly as can be, all eyes were on me
As I looked through the crowd I couldn't believe what I seen
I saw you doing K-I-S-S-I-N-G

How could you go and do this to me
You want to bone this girl for the whole world to see
How could you go and do this to me
You said you'd cherish me, but you embarrass me

I really want to blast on you, I just want to break it down real fast for you
I should jump into my car and just crash on you, how could you do this to me
I'm lovin' you, but you doggin' me

As you got it on with her I felt something in me to go and try and start a scene
As I got up in your face you couldn't even speak
I can't believe just how you tried to play on me

How could you go and do this to me
You want to bone this girl for the whole world to see
How could you go and do this to me
You said you'd cherish me, but you embarrass me

I really want to blast on you, I just want to break it down real fast for you
I should jump into my car and just crash on you, how could you do this to me
I'm lovin' you, but you doggin' me

Oh no, you can't imagine how I felt
Just to know that you were kissing someone else
And everyone can see that you were doggin' me

I really want to blast on you, I just want to break it down real fast for you
I should jump into my car and just crash on you, how could you do this to me
I'm lovin' you, but you doggin' me
