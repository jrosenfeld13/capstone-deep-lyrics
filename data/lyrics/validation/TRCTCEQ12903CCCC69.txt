Hey little rich boy
Take a good look at me
Hey little rich boy
Take a good look at me
I don't need a flash car to take me around
I can get the bus to the other side of town

Hey little rich boy
Take a good look at me
Hey little rich boy
Take a good look at me
I didn't get no GCE
It makes you think you can't talk to me

Hey little rich boy
Take a good look at me
Hey little rich boy
Take a good look at me
Why should I let it worry me
I'll never believe your better than me
