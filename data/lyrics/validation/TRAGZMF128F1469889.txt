Written by Julia Fordham & Simon Climie

I used to pride myself on always being
One step ahead of the game
I thought I had it in line
Thought I knew what was mine
And then you came
And unraveled every fibre from
Beneath my solid ground

I'm feeling like I can't look down
I'm scared of what I'll find
I can tell you anything
But what's really on my mind
I can tell you anything
But what's really on my mind

I'm so tempted to lay the whole
Complete truth at your finger tips
If I gave you it straight would
My secret be safe behind your lips?
Or would my guarded notion
Crumble in your care?

I'm feeling like I can't look down
I'm scared of what I'll find
I can tell you anything
But what's really on my mind
I can tell you anything
But what's really on my mind

And sometimes I stall to catch myself
From sharing all these silent things I've felt

I'm feeling like I can't look down
I'm scared of what I'll find
I can tell you anything
But what's really on my mind
I can tell you anything
But what's really on my mind
