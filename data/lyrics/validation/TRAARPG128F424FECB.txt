We embraced
We couldn't see
The future dangling in front of us
The past now, too far to see
But we didn't look and we didn't care
There was something left between us then
But now I figure it's just not quite there
And nooo ooooouooooo

Hummmmmhummmm

When we kissed, you know
We couldn't see, you know
The future dangling infront of us
The past now, too far to see
But you didn't look, I didn't care
There was something left between us then you say
But now it's just, it's just not quite there
And nooo ooooouooooo

Hummmmmhummmm
