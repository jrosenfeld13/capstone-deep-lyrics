Dont upset the rhythm, no
Dont upset the rhythm
Don't upset the rhythm, no
Don't upset the rhythm

The time is right
The sun is sleeping in the sky
Free your mind
You never know what you might find
Whats your vice
You know we wont compromise
So let me show you
Something simple beautiful

Lets rock the boat
The magic is unstoppable
For on floor
Its the rhythm youve been waiting for
Pure delight, kicks, snare, hat, ride

Its all up to you and whatever you do
Dont cut into my action
4-3-2-1
Go baby, go baby GO!
Dont upset the rhythm, no
Go baby, go baby GO!
Dont upset the rhythm
Go baby, go baby GO!
Dont upset the rhythm, dont you dare
Go baby, go baby GO!

Skin and bones
Acrobats and microphone
Cant get home
You can use my dog bone
Well crank the stereo even when the speakers blow
D-I-Y
Just met at the paradise

Whatever it takes, to carry you away
It all comes down to actions
4-3-2-1
Go baby, go baby GO!
Dont upset the rhythm, no
Go baby, go baby GO!
Dont upset the rhythm
Go baby, go baby GO!
Dont upset the rhythm, dont you dare
Go baby, go baby GO!

Go baby, go baby GO!
(Come on)
Go baby, go baby GO!
(This time I like it)
Go baby, go baby GO!
Now dont you dare
Dont upset the rhythm

Dont upset the rhythm no
(Go, go, go)
Dont upset the rhythm
(Go, go, go)
Dont upset the rhythm, dont you dare
I told you Dont upset the rhythm!

Go baby, go baby GO!
Dont upset the rhythm, no
Go baby, go baby GO!
Dont upset the rhythm
Go baby, go baby GO!
Dont upset the rhythm, dont you dare
Go baby, go baby GO!
Dont upset the rhythm (repeat)
