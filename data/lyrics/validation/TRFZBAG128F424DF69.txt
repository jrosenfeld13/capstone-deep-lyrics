[Verse 1]
Call up, ring once, hang up the phone
To let me know you made it home
Don't want nothing to be wrong with part-time lover
If she's with me, I'll blink the lights
To let you know tonight's the night
For me and you, my part-time lover

[Chorus]
We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

[Verse 2]
If I'm with friends and we should meet
Just pass me by, don't even speak
Know the word's "discreet" with part-time lovers
But if there's some emergency
Have a male friend to ask for me
So then she won't peek it's really you my part-time lover

[Chorus]
We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

(Part-time lovers)
[Luther Vandross scatting]
(Part-time lovers)

[Chorus]
We are undercover passion on the run, yeah
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

[Verse 3]
I've got something that I must tell
Last night someone rang our doorbell
And it was not you, my part-time lover
And then a man called our exchange
But didn't want to leave his name
I guess that two can play the game
Of part-time lovers
You and me, part-time lovers
But, she and he, part-time lovers

[Luther Vandross scatting with "Part-time lovers"]
