Girl don't you worry about a thing
Pick your head up from the pillow
Look at me and the surprise that I bring

Let me show you what I'm trying to write
If you say good, then success
Baby let me sing to you and recite
Let me be your lover tonight

Yes I got your letter when you said that you missed me
I got a picture of you in my head dressed for me
Lovely will the moment be with you
Sometimes on my own I feel sadly
Damn I need you badly, it's true
Lovely will the morning be with you

I could spend the rest of this lazy afternoon away with you

Here I am sitting in my bed like, wishing it was daylight
Girl, I miss you in the nightime
I'm thinking of you constantly and what you mean to me
I'm living just for thee, girl come and get at me

Yes I got your letter when you said that you missed me
I got a picture of you in my head dressed for me
Lovely will the moment be with you
Sometimes on my own I feel sadly
Damn I need you badly, it's true
Lovely will the morning be with you

I could spend the rest of this lazy afternoon away with you
