Price / Peverett - Knee Trembler Music - ASCAP

It's hard to love somebody, and leave her all the time
It's hard to be a friend, easy to be unkind
You treat me like a stranger, and I can understand
'Cause you're a lonely woman, and I'm a travelin' man, well

Lookin' through the window, I saw you wave goodbye
I tried to raise a smile, all I could do was cry
A man needs a woman, to stand by his side
And I need you, to keep me satisfied

Well, I hate to see you cry
Wipe the water from your eye
I'd love to hear you say, you need me anyway
There's one thing you should know
I hate to see, hate to see you go

Well if you ever leave me, I'll be the one to blame
But I never gambled to play a losin' game
My cards are on the table, I ain't a cheatin' man
I'm livin' for your lovin', I hope you understand

Well, I hate to see you cry
Wipe the water from your eye
I'd love to hear you say, you need me anyway
There's one thing you should know
I hate to see, hate to see you go

All the miles between us, you and I
All the lonely nights we sat and cried
Too many to replace, and it's too hard to erase
I don't know what to do
Well I don't know what to do, no
Woo

{Rod - Solo}

Lookin' through the window, I saw you wave goodbye
I tried to raise a smile, all I could do was cry
A man needs a woman, I want you to know
Well I need you, I hate to see you go
