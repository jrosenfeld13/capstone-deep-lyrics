Your home may be cold
And your heart is gone
To the wind and the rain
But your pain will die

So, tell me when you're sad
My heart is strong, I've had

Enough of life's
Cruel, twisted daze
So, you and I
We'll find our own way

Your eyes may seem old
But I, I see them shine
A-with the sun and the stars
In my heart, they're mine

So, tell me when you're sad
My heart is strong, we've had

Enough of life's
Scarred and twisted daze
So, you and I
We'll find our own way
