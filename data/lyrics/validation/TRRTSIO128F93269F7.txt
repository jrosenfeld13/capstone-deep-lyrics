Tonight I lack the strength to even move
When you walked, now watch me die

For I know this is harder for you
For love has let you down

The road ahead is lined with broken dreams
So walk, walk on by

And I failed to give you everything you need
For the fears, behind your eyes

When I can't feel you
I'm not alright, I'm not alright
When I can't heal you
I'm not alright, I'm not alright

When I can't feel you
I'm not alright, I'm not alright
When I can't heal you
I'm not alright, I'm not alright

Jesus as you throw me on the rocks
For love I left your side

For I believed in love and beauty's whiles
Where heaven shone from her eyes

Tell me that it wasn't all for naught
It's such a waste now, It's such a waste now c'mon
I know your scared but baby don't you hide
It's such a waste
We'll stand alone now, we'll make it somehow
