Standing in a pool of blood
Amnesia
My beloved ones in oiles
Injustice : i'm alive

Blood on my hands
Now I remember their faces
Horrified, in a moment of despair
So you want to be saved ?
Then getout of my way

Because your killer
Can never be your Christ
And I bring nothing
But complete demise

[lead : Schlin]

So get out of here
I will only bring you down
Save yourself, I can't help
Because I just can't help myself

Blood on my hands
I can imagine your face
Horrified in a moment

(lead : Allenmark)

Because your killer
