Silver rings and magic things
Your children should not know
Evil deeds are rotten seeds
The kind that never grow
You put them in the ground you know
What you will become
Mmm-mmm, I'll tell you son

She traded life for happiness
With no regrets at all
It left a rotten emptiness
It left her feeling small
It left her nothing there at all
Except something she despised
Mmm-mmm, you see it in her eyes
She fell in love with lies
Mmm-mmm, she's not a sinner

She traded love for liberty
A bold pursuit of fun
She gave away her sanity
And found that she had none
Watch quickly now as she becomes
The thing that she despised
Mmm-mm, feel it in her
She's living in the lie, mmm-mmm
And she's the center
She gave away her life
Mmm-mmm, she's not a sinner
