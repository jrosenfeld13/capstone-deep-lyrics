It takes a fool to phone a fool
When they both have said it all
We make the rule and bemoan the rule
That neither soul should call
But love that was is love that is
Demands to always be unchanged
But then all lovers are deranged

We walk away with memories
And clutch them to our hearts
We disembodied entities
We love in fits and starts
For love like wine intoxicates
It drives all of you drink insane
But then all lovers are deranged

You know that you don't really fall in love
Unless you're seventeen
Then break your word let your spirits fly
But you can't know what it means
Unless you're seventeen

It takes a fight to start a fight, and differences remain
We have the right to think we're right, we're addicts feigning shame
For love recalled, is love reborn, we're determined to revive the pain
But then all lovers are deranged

All lovers are deranged

It takes a fool to phone a fool
When they both have said it all
We make the rule bemoan the rule
That neither soul should call
