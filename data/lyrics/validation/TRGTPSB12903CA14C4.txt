Some people really make me sick
And here's another reason why I don't lift weights
I don't talk about it in the locker room
But I don't like football
So I just keep my mouth shut

Can't respect myself if I don't respect her
Can't respect her if she doesn't say, "Wait"
Some people think that I'm missing out
But their idea of fun written in a poem
On the door of a bathroom stall
