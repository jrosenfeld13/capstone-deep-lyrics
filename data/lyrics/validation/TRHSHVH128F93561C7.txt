Come on son
Play for me
I want you to play the blues for me ..

Don't worry about me baby
I'm gonna find my way
Don't worry about me baby

I will find my way
I'm gonna keep on praying and hoping
That i would see a brighter day

Can't nothing stop me baby
Lord, Can't nothing stand in my way

Listen
I've been down so alone
I couldn't see above my shoes

I looked around for friends everywhere
And All i could see was you

But don't you worry baby (x2)
Right now i can see my way
I can see my way
I've been hoping and praying for long time
All i knew i'm gonna see a brighter day


(solo)

Don't worry about me baby
Because you already gone
But sometimes i say to myself
"I wish you come back home"
So i just keep on trying baby
And i won't let nothing stand in my way
Because as long as i know i got love in my heart .. girl!
Lord! i know i'll see a brighter day!

Yes i will
Yes i will
Dont you worry (x4)

Please don't you worry
Don't you worry about me
Please don't worry
Don't you worry

I've got somebody (x2)
On my side
Oh yes i did

Listen to me baby
Keep on doing what you doing girl
Let your conscious be your god

Don't worry about me baby
