So put it in my backpack dear
We could pretend we're constellations
Living forever but always changing
We are just little blips

Thinking we're the brightest stars
And hoping we will never burn out
But baby everything has got
An expiration date, like you and I

I think I will change my clothes
To accommodate the frosty cold
Because it's rained only once since July
And now our streets give in to the ice

And baby on the 7th floor
We peer over the ledge before
The hot chocolate falls as punishment
For a broken promise/miscommunication

Even when your tummy hurts
This is the best night I have had in a long time
In a long time

No school
No rules

Send it to the back too
You know I would have you never
Say forever we wish we'd stay
Forever young just like the old days

Sergeant I think we've gotten another broken heart
So I'll take it back now to the start
This war has taken now this war has taken
A lot of good men now a lot of good men

No school
Just living like we're criminals
