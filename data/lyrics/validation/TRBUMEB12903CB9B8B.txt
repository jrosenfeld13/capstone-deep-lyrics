One fine day, you'll get me
And you will know what love was meant to be
One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl

The arms I long for will open wide
And you'll be proud to have me
Right by your side
One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl

Though I know you're the kind of boy
Who only wants to run around
I'll keep waiting
And someday, darling, you'll come to me
When you want to settle down

One fine day
We'll meet once more
And then you'll want the love
You threw away me for
One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl

One fine day, you're gonna want me
One fine day, you're gonna want me
One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl
