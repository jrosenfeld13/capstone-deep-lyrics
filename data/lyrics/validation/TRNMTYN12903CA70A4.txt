Today is the day, of the big punk rock show see the status climbers, and the who's whos they know. You'll be on the guest list, make sure you shout it loud You feel so important, now you're walking so proud The highest current fashion, from your head down to your toes gotta make a strong impression, now its backstage you go Make sure we all see you, on the side of the stage you're the punk rock status climbers, and you're always the rage. You make no difference, you're just a pretty face you jockey for position in some silly childish race like a game we played in high school, still trying to be cool its time to get a grip, stop being such a fool the prom is over, and the king and queen moved on if you cam here to be popular, this is not where you belong cause everyone here is equal, and thats how its meant to be we won't let you change it, thats how its gonna be. By The Way Don't think I forgot, Don't think I ever will. I told you that I wouldn't, doesn't that give you a thrill? You should be proud, you've earned your bragging rights. Too bad it had to cost me so many sleepless nights
