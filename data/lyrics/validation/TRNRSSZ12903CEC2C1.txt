No more livestock
No more listlessness
As long as we're quiet
Our dreams are blessed
By hands that smite
And feet that clatter
Against the roof of time
Uncertainty will shatter

Open - rise
A choice career for all - rebirthing
Stop - drown
They drank my words till drought and chatter

No refunds today
A wretched toil awaits below
The face that smiles ok
With teeth that shine like a health freak show
From hibernation
I slither into your barren bed
We'll guard our freedom
A world of protective padlocks lies ahead

Open - rise
A choice career for all - rebirthing
Stop - drown
They drank my words till drought and chatter
