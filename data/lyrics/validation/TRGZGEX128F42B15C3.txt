I remember as a child I used to hear
Music that they played with a feel
Some call it folk, some call it soul
People, let me tell you it was rock and roll

I was raised on rock, got that rhythm in my soul
Every day when I get home I turn on my radio

And listen to the music that my idols made
I knew every single record the DJ's played
The 'Honky Tonk', 'Hound Dog', 'Johnny B. Goode'
'The Chain Gang', 'Love Is Strange', 'Knock On Wood'

I was raised on rock, got that rhythm in my soul
I was born to love the beat of that thing called rock and roll, yeah

They thought it was a fad, thought that it would pass
But the younger generation they knew it would last
Time gone by, the beat goes on
And every time I hear it, it takes me home

I was raised on rock, got that rhythm in my soul
Every day when I get home I turn on my radio

Mama played recordings of Beethoven's Fifth
Moonlight Sonata down the classical Liszt
Daddy loved to listen to his country songs
I was in the back room diggin' the Stones

I was raised on rock, got that rhythm in my soul
I was born to love the beat of that thing called rock and roll
I was raised on rock, got that rhythm in my soul
Every day when I get home I turn on my radio, radio
