Random starlight meets a blind eye
Seeking undiscovered self-importance - you're very important - you're so important
Pleasant distance finds me still
Slightly awaiting what is getting closer - it's getting closer - are we getting closer?

The radio directs the hunters
Into the shark aquarium
Mother ship we're doing fine
But somehow we lost contact

Noble fractions out of vague perceptions
Blurring relevance of many details - many details - so many details

The radio directs the hunters
Into the shark aquarium
Mother ship we're doing fine
But somehow we lost contact

An overdose of frequency
A random line to lead the lost
The radius was not defined
And somehow we lost contact

As if it's slowing down the fall
