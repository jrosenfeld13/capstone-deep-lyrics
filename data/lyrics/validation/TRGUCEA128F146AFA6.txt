Youre so desirable
I cant resist you
Youre so desirable
I have to give in

That firm resolve I made
Has vanished away now
Im happy to say now
You win

Youre so adorable
The moment I saw you
Its just deplorable
The fool that Ive been

And so Im glad
Youve got my heart dear
Like a butterfly on a pin
Youre so desirable
I have to give in

That firm resolve I made
Has vanished away now
Im happy to say now
You win

Youre so adorable
The moment I saw you
Its just deplorable
The fool that Ive been

And so Im glad
Youve got my heart dear
Like a butterfly on a pin
Youre so desirable
I have to give in
