There's a reflection that's so hard to see
A reflection in water of what you could be
A wave crashes over
Tides pull you under
If you've ever wondered why you barely breathe

All of the ways I wish I could've shown you
All of the things that I want you to know right now
All the ways I wish I could protect you
From all the things that you'll learn on your own somehow

As you grow older and you've lived through a war
Before you know it the eyes of a storm
Will rain upon you
Not like you ever knew
No like you've never seen
Like never before

All of the ways I wish I could've shown you
All of the things that I want you to know right now
All the ways I wish I could protect you
From all of the things that you'll learn on your own somehow

These ugly places I don't want you to see

These smiling faces I don't want you to meet
Your heart's extended out
They'll try and tear it out
You'll never be without
The love that's between you and me

All of the ways I wish I could've shown you
All of the things that I want you to know right now
All the ways I wish I could protect you
From all of the things that you'll learn on your own somehow

Learn on your own
Learn on your own somehow
