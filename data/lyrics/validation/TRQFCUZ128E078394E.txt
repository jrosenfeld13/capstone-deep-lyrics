Say How I Feel
Oohhhhh, why can't I say how I feel?

[Verse 1]
I pan across the room
And I see his face
I start to cross the room
With a quickened pace
(quick,quick,quick,quick..)
He brushes the side of me
Like I always dreamed
He stops.... to look at me
Ohhh sweet serendipity

[Chorus]
This is my chance I'll say it
(This is my chance)
Nothing to fear
(I'm gonna say how I feel)
I'm gonna ask him to dance
(And if he won't dance)
Another panic attack
(At least I said how I feel)

[Verse 2]
The very next night
I see him once more
It's not love at first sight
It's more like lust encore
He's floating my way
And I'm hoping to catch his eye
I'm not sure what to say
Damn it, this time, he will be mine

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge]
Oohhhh, I'm so sick
Of all this indecision
And the way, that just one look
Can rock my body rhythm

[Verse 3]
He's coming towards me
At least I hope that's the case
He's smiling at me
And my pulse starts to race
He's asking my name
Politely he turns to my friend
He's asking her the same
(Oh no)
God Almighty will this tourment never ever ... end?

[Repeat Chorus - X 2]
