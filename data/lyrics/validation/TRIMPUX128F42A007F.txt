I had a home down in Texas down where the Bluebonnets grew
I had the kindest old mother how happy we were just we two
Till one day the angels they called her that debt we all have to pay
And she'd call me close to her bedside these last few words to say

Son don't start drinking and gambling promise you'll always go straight
Ten years have passed since that parting that promise I've broke I must say
I started in gambling for past time and then I was just like them all
I bet my clothes and my money not dreaming that I'd ever fall

One night I've bet all my money nothing was left to be seen
All I needed to break them was one card and that was a Queen
The cards were delt round the table each man took a card on the draw
And I drew the card that would beat them I turned it here's what I saw

I saw mother's picture and somehow she seemed to say
Son you roken your promise so I threw those cards away
My winnings I gave to a newsboy I knew I was wrong from the start
Well I'll never forget that promise to mother the Queen of my heart
