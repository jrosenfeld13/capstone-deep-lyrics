From the day I was born
I took the bull by the horns
And gave you plenty to scorn
Well right on!

Then you said in a song
That life was getting real tough
But hey I think that you're bluffing
What of it?

Introduce yourself (right on!)

Now two decades gone by
And I know that's a long time
Para tiempo means nada nunca
Cause I'm still the same asshole
And I still wet my pants
Every time that I see your face
(Who are you?)

Introduce yourself (right on!)

Hey Mr. Biggs, Hey Mr. Bestall, Hey Mr. Warner what's up?
Hey Mr. Enigma, Hey Mr. Bigtime, Hey Mr. Epic, What's going
On?

Introduce yourself (right on!)
