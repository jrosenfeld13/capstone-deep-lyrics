[Verse 1]
We've tried so hard to understand
But we can't
We held the world out in our hands
And you ran away

[Chorus]
It takes some time to let you go
And it shows
Cause all we know is falling, it falls
Remember, cause I know that we won't forget at all

[Verse 2]
Now we could follow you back home
But we won't
Is this what you had waited for
Just to be alone

[Chorus]
It takes some time to let you go
And it shows
Cause all we know is falling, it falls
Remember, cause I know that we won't forget at all

[Bridge]
You never
You never said
This wasn't what you wanted
Was it
Was it
This isn't what you wanted
This isn't what you wanted

[Chorus]
It takes some time to let you go
And it shows
Cause all we know is falling, it falls
Remember, cause I know that we won't forget at all
