There's a house at the end of the road
It's got no windows and
It's hard to see what's going on in there
There's a man and he asks you what you want
He's got no reason
But you feel like you can't just ignore what he says

Imagine he's all you've got
Imagine he's all you've got

There's a house at the end of the road
It's got no windows and
It's hard to make out what you just came here for
Catch the sun through the trees as you are walking
Through the garden
You've just got to get in before they close the door

Imagine he's all you've got
Imagine he's all you've got

Imagine this is all you have come across
Imagine she's all you've got
Imagine this is all you will ever have
Imagine he's all you've got
