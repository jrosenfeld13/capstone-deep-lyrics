Beautiful the evening
We have had a special day
You and me together
Youre a gift from heaven
You have changed my life so much
And I thank God for you
I lay you down
In His presence and protection
Lay you down
In His arms as strong as stone
Lay you down
In His keeping
In his presence and protection
Since the early morning
You have made your music
Sung you heart out to the sun
Now the mist of evening
Has laid the dew upon the grass
Caught the sparkle in your eyes
I will give thanks
For the life you have shown
For I am so grateful
For all I have known
And for the love
That is yours to bestow
In His presence and protection
