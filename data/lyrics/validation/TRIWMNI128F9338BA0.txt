Oh my soul, where did you go?
Oh my soul, you've gotten lost
I try to comprehend
My maker's place
Trying to make amends
But I just can't understand
My soul can't let you go now, Still feel I need you somehow
Where will you be
When they turn out the lights?
Do you still hold my hand
Mama, and kiss me goodnight?
Oh my soul
You gave me the strength
You gave me the power
You said to me

"My sweet little sunshine
Through your own life
You discover your own soul"
Oh my soul, don't let me go
Hold me close and whisper to me low
Your stillness speaks
Now the answer I know
Accept and surrender, set you free
Let you go, my soul
You'll always be my soul
Hey mama, you'll always be my soul
