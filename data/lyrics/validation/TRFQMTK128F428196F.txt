These mirrors you've broken are your cry for art
Salt and pepper shakers over your shoulders, cross your heart
Don't you know it's bad luck to stay in one place for too long?
You've been listening to voices in your head, helpless when they go

So we play a game of snakes and ladders
Gambled our mistakes, didn't know what could come after
Threw away the cards. Who thinks it could matter?
Oh, who believes in fate anyway?

When only you could be the one
To win out over me
When it isn't just a game. It's the way we come undone
What a perfect accident. How we dance around and
Oh, like we didn't even notice, oh oh oh oh oh
I love the way we come undone

Thought I saw something hiding in the yard
But it was bad weather to keep a watch out in the dark
You know, all this time we've been playing for your heart
But I never let it on. I'll love watch you play the part

So we played a game of snakes and ladders
Gambled our mistakes, didn't know what could come after
Threw away the cards. Who thinks it could matter?
Oh, who believes in fate anyway?

When only you could be the one
To win out over me
When it isn't just a game. It's the way we come undone
What a perfect accident. How we dance around and
Oh, like we didn't even notice, oh oh oh oh oh
I love the way we come undone
