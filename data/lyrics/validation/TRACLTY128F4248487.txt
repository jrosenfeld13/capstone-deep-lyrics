We collapse, hands interlude
Cheek against cheek
A pulse duet hums through our veins
And I'm not sure why I continue
When we start to embarrass each other
As our lies attain bi-partial virtue
And all I want is to die
I gain and lose control
Like some fucked up lust opiate
And now you will forever abhor me
As I purge myself one piece at a time
I won't forget my reflection
Loved and lost in between your thighs
Don't forget how I can't forget you
I continue
When we start to embarrass each other
Hypnotic and gross, stained with a big deal
And all I want is to die
I'd rather erase my two ton impact on your life
This shouldn't be my only way out
Anxious to have validity knowing I only take up space
I'll continue to swell thanks to the induction of severity
