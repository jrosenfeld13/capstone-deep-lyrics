I dreamt this day in every way
Since i was a little girl
We'd be friends holding hands
'till the end

You're one of a kind
You're the dream that came true
From the candles i blew
You bring out the best in me
That's why i love you 'cause your love is so real

I'm floating down the aisle
Watching you wanting me
Wanna be yours forever
Every step i make
Every breath i take
Is getting closer to you
Forever

Our house will be home
And love will keep growing
With a family of our own

We'll sit by the fire, tell stories and laugh
And sometimes cry
There'll be ups and downs, nothin's perfect

But our love won't be afraid to be strong and brave
A lifetime together we'll share
Every emotion that true love can bear

I'm floating down the aisle
Watching you wanting me
Wanna be yours forever
And every step i make, every breath i take
Is getting closer to you
Forever

Here we are standing side by side
I'm ready to be your bride
We both say i do
Oh baby you look into my eyes
You kiss me for a while
And we slip away
Forever
