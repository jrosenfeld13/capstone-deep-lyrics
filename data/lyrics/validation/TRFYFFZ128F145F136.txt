(Chorus):
Sonny don't go away, I am here all alone
And your Daddy's a sailor who never comes home
And the nights are so long and the silence goes on
And I'm feelin' so tired, I'm not all that strong

Sonny lives on a farm, in a wide open space
Kick off your sneakers
And let go the race
And you can lay down your head
By a sweet river bed
But Sonny always remembers
What it was his Mama said

(Chorus)
Sonny carries a load, though he's barely a man
There ain't much to do, yet he does what he can
He watches the sea from a room by the stairs
The waves keep on rollin'
They've done that for years

(Chorus)
It's a hundred miles to town
Sonny's never been there
Yet he goes to the highway
And stands there and stares
And the mail comes at four
And the mailman is old
But he still keeps his dreams
Full of silver and gold

(Chours)

Sonny's dreams can't be real
They're just stories he's read
They're just stars in his eyes
They're just dreams in his head
Still he longs in his mind for the wild world outside
And I know I can't hold him though I've tried, and
I've tried, and I've tried

(Chorus)
