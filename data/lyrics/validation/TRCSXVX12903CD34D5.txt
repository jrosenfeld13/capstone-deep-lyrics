I want to tear out half the pages
I want to create a different colour
I want to roll your thoughts and smoke em
I want to crush this bitter softness

But Mr. Want is dead
He was sick for a long time
I would have liked to have known him
But he left too soon
Now Mr. Want is dead
He was sick for a long time
I would have liked to have known him
But he left too soon

I want to bathe in the sea of rescue
I want to knit a sweater for the moon
I want to steal your breath and sell it
I want to pour honey on the blade

But Mr. Want is dead
He was sick for a long time
I would have liked to have known him
But he left too soon
Now Mr. Want is dead
He was sick for a long time
I would have liked to have known him
But he left too soon

Yeah soon yeah soon
Yeah soon yeah

I want to escape this endless freedom
I want to laugh like summer lightning
I want to ignore your best seduction
I want to love with all my hatred

But Mr. Want is dead
He was sick for a long time
I would have liked to have known him
But he left too soon
Now Mr. Want is dead
He was sick for a long time
I would have liked to have known him
But he left too soon

Now Mr. Want is dead
He was sick for a long time
I would have liked to have known him
But he left too soon
Now Mr. Want is dead
He was sick for a long time
I would have liked to have known him
But he left too soon
