Chorus
Come and danz with me
Come and set your body free
I really know how to move it
Baby let's get to it

Come and danz with me
Come and set your body free
I really know how to move it
Tonight I'm gonna prove it

Verse 1
Tonight I'm gonna get you in the mood
I'm gonna danz all night with you
Baby danz with my lipz
Oh baby danz with my hipz
Until I grant your every wish

Tonight I'm gonna pull you to the floor
And there you're gonna beg me for more
Leave it all up to me, the choreography
I guarantee I will set your body free

(Chorus)
Verse 2
Tonight we're gonna danz like never before
When you think there couldn't be anymore
We'll just keep going on
Song after song dancing until the DJ's gone

Tonight there's no need to fantasize
I'm standing right before your eyes
We can danz all night Or do whatever you like
I'll make sure you'll wanna danz all night

(Chorus)
