Just for tonight
Forget what is right
Come on, move your body to the flashing light

Just for tonight
Forget what is right

Hey, don't say
You'll never, never stay
Oh, don't go
I'll see you at the show
Say no more
I'll get you through the door
If you move your body
I'll see you on the floor

(Just for tonight)
I don't wanna see you 'till the morning light
(Just for tonight)
I don't wanna see you 'till the morning light
(Move your body)
(Just for tonight)
I don't wanna see you (x4)

Just for tonight
Forget what is right
Come on, move your body to the flashing light
(repeat x4)

You're hip, you're tired
Just stare into my eyes
The lights are bright
You never know I might
It all depends
On how the story ends
It started with Adam and Eve
You know just don't ....

(Just for tonight)
I don't wanna see you 'till the morning light
(Just for tonight)
I don't wanna see you 'till the morning light
(Move your body)
(Just for tonight)
I don't wanna see you (x4)

Just for tonight
Forget what is right
Come on, move your body to the flashing light
(repeat x4)
