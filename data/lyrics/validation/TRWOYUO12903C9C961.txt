Love is all I need
To make my sweetest dreams come true
Love is all I need
And all I need for love is you
Love can move the highest mountains of misery
Be kind to me
Move mine for me
Show me, show me, show me
That you care for me
And I'll show you a love thats true
Love is all I need
To make my sweetest dreams come true
Love is all I need
And all I need for love is you
Love is all I need
Love is all I need...
