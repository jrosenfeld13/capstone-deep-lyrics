Every now and then
You find someone
Who'll stand out in a crowd
Who'll soar high above the rest
Ask you to come along
For a while

I get high so alive
The way you throw your love around
Cause I know what's keeping me sane
Is knowing you, knowing you
Are mad to

Every now and then
You lose the one
Who stood out in a crowd
Who soared high above the rest
Asked you to come along
For a while

I get high so alive
The way you throw your love around
Cause I know what's keeping me sane
Is knowing you, knowing you
Are mad to

And your twisted point of view
Always seem to set me straight
How your mind is somewhere else
And your heart still in its place
