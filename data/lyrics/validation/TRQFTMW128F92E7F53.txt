Well, I don't know why I came here tonight
I got the feeling something ain't right
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair
And I'm wondering if I'll get down the stairs
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am, stuck in the metal with you
Stuck in the metal with you

Well, I'm stuck in the metal with you
And I'm wondering what is I should do
It's so hard to wipe this smile from my face
Lose control and I'm all over the place
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am, stuck in the metal with you

[Chorus:]
Well, you started out with nothing
And you're proud you're a self-made man
And your friends they all come crawling
Slap you on the back and say, "Please, please"

[Repeat Chorus]
Well, I don't know why I came here tonight
I got the feeling something ain't right
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair
And I'm wondering if I'll get down the stairs
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am, stuck in the metal with you
Yes, I'm stuck in the metal with you

Here I am, here I am
Stuck in the metal with you
