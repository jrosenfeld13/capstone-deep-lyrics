Cloud my eyes and tell me what to see
I'm falling
Every way I turn the same disease
But I like it
Brace myself and hit the wall with ease
I'm colliding
I'm not minding the pain

[Chorus]
I've been down here before
All my bones and joints are sore
Pick my way out of the wreck again
I've been down here before
Lost myself and so much more
Find my way out of the game again


Open up my head and take it in
Just like always
Think about the bar and take a swing
Loaded trapeze
What you need the most from me is yours
I'll continue to deceive you my friend

[Chorus]

And you lost what made you you
Or maybe I never knew
I can't stay here anymore
Give it all or you're on your own
I will leave you
I will leave you
I will leave you
I will leave you

[Chorus]x2
