She believes in darkness
She believes in light
Darkness is insanity
God only lives in light
Darkness takes control of her
Relief comes with light
Monster says "I love you"
And she says "I love you, too"
No angel can protect her
Why does god desert her?

When monster comes at night
To reap the seed
That he has sown
She said

"Feel the life surround me
Sink into the sea
Feel the touch inside me
Hold me hurt me scare me"

How many tears does it take
To cleanse the life polluted
Well it all depends
How pure the shit in the jack every day
The dark takes her back
I'm so sick of this life
She said

"Feel the life surround me
Sink into the sea
Feel the touch inside me
Hold me, hurt me, scare me"

Sink into the sea
Feel the touch inside me
Hold me, hurt me, scare me
Hold me, hurt me, scare me"
