Accusations, a court room floor
And your best defense just walked out the door
And you'd like to be strong but you'd rather be weak
And you're watching the circles float out of your mouth as you speak

And the words well up and you start to explode
'Cause you've really got to know

Do you want lies, do you want truth
Or do you want l-l-love?
Do you want war, do you want peace
Or do you want l-l-love?
Oh, God is l-l-love

So tell me what's your label that you're so proud to wear
And do you feast as the table of religious despair
Or would you rather put bread in a skeleton's mouth
Or just turn on the TV until you completely tune out?

What are we doing, are we wasting our time?
Tell me, are we blind?

Do you want lies, do you want truth
Or do you want love, love, love?
Do you want war, do you want peace
Or do you want love, love, love?
Oh, God is love, love, love

In the last defense, when the curtain is drawn
And a river of blood brings salvation to all
Help us open our eyes to Your glorious face
And speak words of sweet Jesus that will bring eternal grace

Do you want lies, do you want truth
Or do you want love, love, love?
Do you want war, do you want peace
Or do you want love, love, love?
Oh, God is love, God is love

Oh, God is love, oh, God is love
Don't you want love?
Don't you want l-l-love?
Oh, God is l-l-love
