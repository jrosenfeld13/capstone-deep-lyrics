All that's true and all that's you is all that I'm falling over
All I do is try to fool the storms that keep circling over
When I'm strong and I belong your charm I can just ignore
But the a scent I can't forget but can't quite recall who wore it

There's no way, I can stay awake

Gormless girls the bones of earls adrift in my grey surrender
Streets of old and hearts to hold grow damp as they start to ember
I'm not upside down, I'm chucked around, late at night I'm grinding
Puddles freeze and huddles sneeze all night in the Park Lane subway

There's no way, I can stay away
Hopeless to resist oh your sweet abyss
Hopeless to resist oh your sweet abyss

All that you collected in your lap gathers to confront you
All your weapons are corroded back, frantically defeated
On the Piccadilly line divine daydreams take me over
Why am I thinking of salvation in just another lover?

There's no way I can awake
There's no way I can away
Hopeless to resist oh your sweet abyss
Hopeless to resist oh your sweet abyss

All that's true and all that's you is all that I'm falling over
