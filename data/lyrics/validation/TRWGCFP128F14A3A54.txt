Got a pollywog in your water
Tadpole in the moonshine vat
An' granddaddy-long-leg climbing on the screen
You better watch, you're gonna squash him flat
Boll weevils in your cotton
And dirt-dauber busy building a nest
The red wasp's gonna swoop down and get ya child
Won't give you a minutes rest
(she's talkin 'bout)
Bugs! Everywhere you look there's another kind of bug
Makes you want to get a club and clout'em
Yes everybody's talking bout the worrysome bugs
But ain't nobody doing nothing about 'em

Shooing the flies away from the table
Hiding under the quilting bed
The chiggers running wild in the blackberry bush
Yellow jackets swarmin' round your head
They're coming to get your watermelon
Black ants marching in a long line
They're lurking in the leaves of the strawberry patch
And climbing up the tomato vine
(she gonna tell you about)
Bugs!
Bugs! Everywhere you look there's another type of bug
But if ya live in the delta ya got 'em
Here's a sure fire way to pass the time of day
Fold you up a newspaper and swat 'em

Hey look its me with the DDT
Umm hmm, umm hmm
Ain't they a mess, them worrysome pests
Umm hmm, umm umm hmm
