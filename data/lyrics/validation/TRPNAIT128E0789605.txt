I drink sweet wine for breakfast
Slept about an hour or so
Smiled a little in the silence
Deciding on where to go

"Meet me under the whale
In the Natural History Museum"
I think that's what she said
A little bit sad about having to leave them

Yawning in the sun
Like a child I run

But don't do it if you don't want to
I wouldn't do a thing like that
But don't it if you don't want to
I wouldn't do a thing like that

How little do you speak of beauty
Isn't it a shame, what ho
Maybe you should go get a power ring
You'd make all your troubles go

There she stood in drag
Just-a lookin' cool in astrakhan
She's lookin' a little wiped out
She said I looked like Peter Pan

Yawning in the sun, oh baby
Like a child I run

But don't do it if you don't want to
I wouldn't do a thing like that
Oh no, no, don't do it if you don't want to
I wouldn't do a thing like that
Don't do it
