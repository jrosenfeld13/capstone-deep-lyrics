He went away
So far away on a holiday
He met a girl in a greasy bar
He should've known he wouldn't get that far
They found him in a trunk of a car
This is a case for Detective Jones
He's gonna start his own investigation
An S.O.S to Detective Jones
He's busy on the phones across the nation
This girl
Really famous all around the world
Did she fall down from that balcony
Or was it murder of the first degree?
It all remains a mystery
This is a case for Detective Jones
He's gonna start his own investigation
An S.O.S. to Detective Jones
He's busy on the phones across the nation
Oooh - here he comes
The man's got a master plan
Oooh - here he comes
Our Jones has got his marker down
This is a case for Detective Jones
You'll never walk alone when he's in your town
A cry for help to Detective Jones
He's busy on the phones, preparing a showdown now
