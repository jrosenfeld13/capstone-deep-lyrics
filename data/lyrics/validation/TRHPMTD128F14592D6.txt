Watching the raincloud
Take over me
Watching my people
What do I see
Nothing but hardship
The poorer we are
We're living in danger
Of going to far

So here I am
Can you understand
So much to live for
In so little time

So many places
All I have seen
Watching the sunrise
They dream and they dream

Watching the raincloud
Take over me
Watching the sunset
The end of a dream
