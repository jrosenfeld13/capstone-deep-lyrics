Oh Venus was born out of sea-foam
Oh Venus was born out of brine
But the goddess today
If she is grade A
Is assembled upon the assembly line

(How divine! Rise and shine!)
Upon the assembly line!

Now Julie was born as its proper
Her every proportion was planned
She was poured from a mold
Exquisite and cold
And she grew up untouched by human hand

(Oh how grand! See her stand!)
Untouched by human hands!

Her chromium nerves and her platinum brain
Were chastely encased in cellophane
And to top off this daughter of science and art
She was equipped with a prefabricated heart

She prepares for life!

Shall I be auburn or dark or fair?
Shall I unbind my nylon hair?
Would love make skies look clearer?
Or should I serenade my mirror?

A hero would always admire me
Hed pamper and pet and inspire me
Why else were my charms made so drastic ?
Why else were my arms made so plastic ?

What else was my heart electroplated for?
Oh, send me the mate it was prefabricated for

Then just like the movies, a mail-order male
Was sent by the gods direct from Yale
He was handsome with biceps of stainless steel
Plus which he was rich, and his love for her was real

By fate he was guided to knock at her door
Twas love at first sight for evermore
They were made for each other, exclusively planned
So he bent his knee and he asked her for her hand

Her bridal gown was a synthetic weave of coal tar, milk, and wood
Spun under atomic pressure in a four-billion-dollar machine

Ill offer you sterilised flowers
Expensive and scentless and rare
Therell be pedigree birds singing songs without words
As they fly through the air-conditioned air

Your fanciful dreams Ill interpret for you
Your hidden desires I will bring into view
All the wheels in your brain I will polish and shine
To prove they can move in harmony with mine

Oh, nature and art will not win her
So ply her with diamonds and pearls
For bracelets and rings are practical things
That appeal to the mind of a healthy girl

Oh, nature and art will not win her
Oh ply her with diamonds and pearls
For bracelets and rings are practical things
That appeal to the mind of a healthy girl

 Julie, at last youre mine
 I guess
 Ive always dreamed of this moment divine
 It will be nice, unless
 Oh, darling, let us seal our marital bliss
With a glorious technicolour kiss
 I suppose so
 You express every ideal Ive ever had
Youre as evocative as a full-page ad
Tell me that you care
 Youre mussing my hair
 Oh, darling
 Watch my new clothes
 Beloved
 Oh, well, I suppose
 Angel
 Dont make such a fuss
 Treasure
 Oh youre so impetuous!
 Dearest! Sweetest! Queen!
 Oh, this is ridiculous!
Sisters, come to my aid!

Her Amazon sisters were passing that way
They rushed to her aid and they saved the day
The swine! He has frightened her out of her wits
The brute! We should shoot him and tear him into bits

Wheels started turning inside her head
So from his ardent arms she fled
Girls of wax cant use devotion
They might melt if they felt an emotion

She left him bereft and wifeless
And he fell to the ground, quite lifeless

But she rides on into the dawn
On and on as her wheels revolve
A riddle whose answer none can solve
Who sends all her dreams to the laundry
Who prefers to live in a quandary
Her loneliness she must insist on
Shes Isolde without a Tristan
Her groom who for doom was slated
Dissolved into tears and disintegrated

And so she rides on through the evening
As pure as she was at the start
For theres no man alive who could ever survive
A girl with a prefabricated heart
A love-proof, unbreakable heart
