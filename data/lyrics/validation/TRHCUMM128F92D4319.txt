There was always a power I could feel
It was guidance to tell me the way to go
But nowadays I feel like I can't hear that voice
I've been flying blind I need you to come and be my eyes (Be my eyes)

River rise, carry me back home (I cannot remember the way)
River rise, carry me back home (I surrender today)

I was always a charmed flower child
I would sit for hours and listen to the sky
But nowadays I feel like I don't have that choice
I've looking down in desperation I need you to be my inspiration (My inspiration)

River rise, carry me back home (I cannot remember the way)
River rise, carry me back home (I surrender today)

I bow down and I humble myself
I can't do this, Lord I need your help
All the material things they feel like chains
If you're not here beside me, You're the reason I sing

Help me to remember the way
I surrender
Help me to remember
Only you can show me (Only you can show me the way)
I surrender (I surrender today)

You are the only way
Lord I need you
