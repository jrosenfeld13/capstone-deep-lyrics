Yeah, whoa, yeah
For my baby, yeah
Mmm, listen

I named you Ja Jr. or Caron or Jayliah
A daughter, I can't wait to meet you
And I hope you've got your mother's eyes
I'll be right here, dear, waitin' on the outside

Already got it all mapped out
Already buyin' baby bibs, crib's in the bedroom
(A baby bedroom)
Already love you more than myself
More than I've ever loved anybody else so

(Hurry up into my life)
Hurry baby, my life, my life
Hurry up and bring you in
(Into my life)
My life, my life

Told me she was eatin' for two
And the date you were due
(I cried)
Even if, even if you were only two pink lines

Only nine months and you'll be mine
It's only the best day of my life
Simple as a plus or minus sign
I loved you when you were two pink lines

Gonna be a dad
(A daddy)
Can't help but brag, I'm so excited, I remember
The moment, it felt so right
I can't believe we conceived
It's a blessing that, finally

I could be yeah, yeah, a proud pops, all the playin' stops
Tuckin' in my shirt, gotta go to work now
And put it on the table
Make the situation more stable for my baby

(Hurry up into my life)
Into my life, my life
Hurry and bring you in
(Into my life)
Into my life, into my life

Told me she was eatin' for two
And the date that you were due
And I cried
Even if, even if you were only two pink lines

It's only nine months and you'll be mine
It's only the best day of my life
Simple as a plus or minus sign
I loved you when you were two pink lines

It's only nine months and you'll be mine
It's only the best day of my life
Simple as a plus or minus sign
I loved you when you were two pink lines

Honey, what are you thinkin'?
Baby-blue or pink?
I can't tell, sonogram reveals it all
Berets over basketball

Handsome in a room standin' tall
Or in the crowd
You're the pick of the pageant
And you're lookin' for your daddy

In six months we'll see
I don't care as long as you're here with me

Told me she was eatin' for two
And the date you were due
Even if, even if you were only two pink lines, yeah
