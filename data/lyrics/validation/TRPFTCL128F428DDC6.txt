Reach out, reach out, reach out
Reach out!
Reach out, reach out, reach out
Ah! Yeah!

Reach, come on, come on, come on, come on
Reach
Reach, come on, come on, come on, come on
Reach for the love
Reach for the love

I was lost, filled with hesitation
Without a plan, no determination
Until we met, you were my salvation
And now I know

There's nothing I can't do in my life
As long as I have you in my life
You let me see the strength I have so deep inside
I know that I can

Reach
For a shiny new tomorrow
Reach
For a better day
Reach
For something higher
Something brighter
Reach for the love
Reach for the love

Reach
Reach

And when I rise, a brighter love is shining
And every day I'm gonna keep on trying
And though the road is sometimes long and winding
Come walk with me

Every step of the way and my life
Is better every day, yes my life
Is better for the deeper love you've shown to me
Now I believe I know that I can

Reach
For a shiny new tomorrow
Reach
For a better day
Reach
For something higher
Something brighter
Reach for the love
Reach for the love

Reach
For a shiny new tomorrow
Reach
For a better day
Reach
For something higher
Something brighter
Reach for the love
Reach for the love

Reach
Yes you can
Reach
That's what your love can do for me baby
Reach
That's what your love can do for me baby
It makes me wanna

Reach out, reach out, reach out
Reach out!
Reach out, reach out, reach out
Aaaa, there ain't nothing
In my life I can't do
As long as I have you
Is better for the deeper love you've shown to me
Now I believe I know that I can

Reach
For a shiny new tomorrow
Reach
For a better day, a better day
Reach
For something higher
Something brighter
Reach for the love
Reach for the love

Reach
