Through the skin, first cut's the deepest
You made your mark and pulled away
With every move, with all your features
I let you seep inside my veins

But nothing goes the way you planned
The constant here is change
We built walls, but down they came
I can't take the blame
I still find myself here waiting
I needed you to see the love, see the love, see the love we had
See the love, see the love, see the love we had

All this time is life worth living
And I've tried everything to save
To save us from crippled feelings
Oh, we're always swimming against the waves

So, if you ever see my baby walking in the snow
Do her eyes still light and glow?
Yeah, I need to know
I still find myself here waiting
I needed you to see the love, see the love, see the love we had
See the love, see the love, see the love we had
See the love, see the love, see the love we had

(See the love, see the love, see the love we had
See the love, see the love, see the love we had)
