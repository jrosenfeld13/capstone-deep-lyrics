Watch out when they start to twist
Hold tight with a leather fist
That's what my daddy told me
How to ride the bulls
There's a jingle in my jeans
Short places in between;
I'm leaving Tennessee with a push and pull

Ten-four, buddy, come on back
Horse trailer on a Cadillac
You're talking to the cowboy in the coupe de ville
Chug a lug up one side, glide down the other
I'm a lover of the other side of the hill

Turn up that radio & don't think about rodeo
Don't think about roundup up in old Cheyenne
It's a crazy circuit, but you still work it
Won't you turn the sound up and let's check the scan

Ten-four, buddy, come on back
Horse trailer on a Cadillac
You're talking to the cowboy in the coupe de ville
Chug a lug up one side, glide down the other
I'm a lover of the other side of the hill

Bandanna on the rearview mirror
Still wet from ear to ear;
Once again it's provin' what the wise men say -
When you ride the last one, you better make it a fast one
Jump while he's movin, just walk away

Ten-four, buddy, come on back
Horse trailer on a Cadillac
You're talking to the cowboy in the coupe de ville
Chug a lug up one side, glide down the other
I'm a lover of the other side of the hill
