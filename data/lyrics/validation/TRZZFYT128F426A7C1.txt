[Verse 1[
There's no voile to my brother's shutters
There's no opal around my fingers
No cathedral where to hide my prayers
Just a little gold around my voice

[Chorus 1]
I go the routes I go the borders
I smell, I listen, and I learn, I see
Time passes along time zones
I take, I give, had I the choice?

[Chorus 2]
That's my destiny
I go along my route
That's how pass my hours
At my heart beats crazy rhythms

[Verse 2]
From summer fires I fly to dark winters
Autumn rains to Indian summer
Frozen grounds to dry deserts
I go I come, this world is mine
I live from notes and I live from light
I'm responding to all your cries, your hands
Life's taking me to it's mysteries' hollows
I my tomorrows in your eyes

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
I take blues from answering machines signals
I take sadness in airports
I live love at kilometers away
And happiness at my phone

[Chorus 2]
