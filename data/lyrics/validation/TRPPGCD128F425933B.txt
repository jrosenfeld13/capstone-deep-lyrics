I know i don't feel so fine and she knows i don't feel so fine
And she knows i have spent the time
So tie my eyes behind my back, so next time i can see behind

Call it all the stuff you want to
Put my heart back with some superglue
Super dreams are silly stupid things
Now i know

Feel my hand won't it be grand to stay this way today no end
Just knock me down you'll see no frown
Just kiss me where it hurts

Call it all the stuff you want to
Put my heart back i don't want you to
Super dreams are big and wild things
Now i love
