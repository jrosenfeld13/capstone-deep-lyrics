An onset of polyps
Spurt from the rectum
Like a bouquet of red fingers
Painful, yet gorgeous

So, this is what you get for this life that you've led
Your blooming' tulips turning red

Pulsating
Pappular
Protuberance
Sessile villous adenoma

Deep inside we can see with colonoscopy
Stalactitical growths from hardened adipose
Formations of bags contain polypular tissue
Bursting open, causing anemia

Hystilogical tests reveal the presence of cancer
Could have been avoided, somebody made a big mistake
Substandard diet, consumption of meat led to this disease
Atypial polyps bringing you to your knees

Polypectomy
On total obstructing colorectal cancer
Merging tapeworms
Make their homes in the polyps

Blood, clots, hot enema, dead crotch, worms line the colon

Disgusting pig-worms in the polyps
Nutrients sucked - broken by solids
A flexible sigmoidoscopy
Revealing upper G.I. disease

Blood, clots, hot enema, dead crotch, worms in the polyps

Your colon shuts down
Rectus cavernosa
Finger-like polyps
Stalactyte deposits

Caved in, bleeding
Time for colostomy
Poopshoot re-route
To the side

Now a bag of excement
Is always stripped to your hip
Everyone knows it
And when you die, you'll be screaming -
Why me, Why me, Why me

This could have been stopped
This could have been avoided
This is what you get for being alive

An onset of polyps
Spurt from the colostomy hole
This time with maggots
And hungry anal mites

So, this is what you get for this life that you've led
Better off dead

Death by polyps
