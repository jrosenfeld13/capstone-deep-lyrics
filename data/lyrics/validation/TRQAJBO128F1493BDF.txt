[Verse 1]
On my way up north
Up on the Ventura
I pulled back the hood
And I was talking to you
And I knew then it would be
A lifelong thing
But I didn't know that we
We could break a silver lining

[Chorus]
And I'm so sad like a good book
I can't put this day back
A sorta fairytale with you
A sorta fairytale with you
A sorta fairytale with you

[Verse 2]
Things you said that day
Up on the 101
The girl had come undone
I tried to downplay it
With a bet about us
You said that you'd take it
As long as I could
I could not erase it

[Chorus]
And I'm so sad like a good book
I can't put this day back
A sorta fairytale with you
A sorta fairytale with you
A sorta fairytale with you

[Post-Chorus 1]
And I ride alongside
And I rode alongside you then
And I rode alongside
'til you lost me there in the open road
And I rode along side
'til the honey spread itself so thin
For me to break your bread
For me to take your word I had to steal it

[Chorus]
And I'm so sad like a good book
I can't put this day back
A sorta fairytale with you
A sorta fairytale with you
A sorta fairytale with you
I could pick back up whenever I feel

[Verse 3]
Down New Mexico way
Something about the open road
I knew that he was
Looking for some Indian blood
And find a little in you find a little
In me we may be
On this road but we're just impostors
In this country you know

[Verse 4]
So we go along and we said we'd fake it
Feel better with Oliver Stone
'til I almost smacked him
Seemed right that night and
I don't know what takes hold
Out there in the desert cold
These guys think they must
Try and just get over on us

[Chorus]
And I'm so sad like a good book
I can't put this day back
A sorta fairytale with you
A sorta fairytale with you
A sorta fairytale with you

[Post-Chorus 2]
And I was riding by, riding alongside
For a while 'til you lost me
And I was riding by, riding along
'til you lost me, 'til you lost me
In the rear view
You lost me, I said

[Outro]
Way up north I took my day
All in all was a pretty nice day
And I, I put the hood right back where
You could taste heaven perfectly
Feel out the summer breeze
Didn't know when we'd be back
And I, I don't, didn't think
We'd end up like, like this
