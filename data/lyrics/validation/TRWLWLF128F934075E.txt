All along I was just faking it
And I'd do whatever just to be making it
All along I was just eating shit
And I'd do whatever just so I could make a hit

I'm a slave because it isn't like me
To be myself and live without a care
My day is payday
Will they ever learn from me?
My day is payday
Will they ever...

All along I was their little bitch
And I'd do whatever just so I could be the rich
Now I'm as plastic as they ever come
But so are credit cards
And they are worth more than some

I'm a slave because it isn't like me
To be myself and live without a care
My day is payday
Will they ever learn from me?
My day is payday
Will they ever learn from me?
My day is payday
Will they ever learn from me?
My day is payday
Will they ever...

I'd sell my soul for a million one
It's better than just living for the fun
Cuz I'll be their fortunate son
And that's when i know I've won

I'm a slave because it isn't like me
I'm a slave because it isn't like me

I'm a slave because it isn't like me
To be myself and live without a care
My day is payday
Will they ever learn from me?
My day is payday
Will they ever...

Payday (x6)
