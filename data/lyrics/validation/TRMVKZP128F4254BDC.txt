Went away to a far far land, spent some time in New York
Most of my time inna England, no welcome back to my bornland

Come from england to make some vibes, just to keep my fans alive

But the vibes they're teaching me, that dont right in my book, No
Yes the vibes they're teaching me, that dont right in my book, Like

No put de day nah put dem no weh, no put de day lawd I went dem a stay
Sex an guns jus keep dem to de ground horse tonic a mek de girls dem panic

Teach de youths dem how to live, Teach de youths dem how to survive
Hold your corner and save your life and thats no jive

Some of de youths dem make a living by selling some stones
While some make a living wiping down cars
Can't you see the times your living in? the people are suffering

Don't teach me nothing just teach me something
Don't teach me nothing just teach me something
Hold your corner save your life and thats no jive

My heart, my poor little heart, my heart cries to see the youth

No put de day nah put dem no weh, no put de day lawd I went dem a stay
Sex an guns jus keep dem to de ground horse tonic a mek de girls dem panic

Teach de youths dem how to live, Teach de youths dem how to survive
Hold your corner and save your life and thats no jive
