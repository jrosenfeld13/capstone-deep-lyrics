[Verse]
Our time has come, age of the hammerheads
This is our mission to be the Daleks of God
Too late for silence, too late for anything
It's all too much for me, its roots go down too deep for me

Our punishing fire an animal frenzy
These hammerhead people know what danger is for
You let them in and now they're everywhere
If it's mineral or vegetable it's back a little up a little

[Chorus]
Shout push hammerheads, bold and resolute
Marching balancing in too far to go back
Yes yes hammerheads, swimming kissing
We are big and clever and we don't know anything

[Verse]
Purification by immersion in our filthy demon seed
We know the only things you like are paranoid sex and childish greed
Our own worst enemies, they hollowed us out of wood
Look at all the grease inside us, gonna get us this time but good
Whether we pull it out or push it in it all ends up the same
You know a hammerhead is a hammerhead by any other name

[Chorus]
Shout push hammerheads, bold and resolute
Marching balancing in too far to go back
Yes yes hammerheads, swimming kissing
We are big and clever and we don't know anything

Onwards hammerheads, bright and dangerous
Jumping running in the field and factory
God save hammerheads keeping going
We are sleek and special and we're sure of something


Blessed are the apemen
Blessed are the shit kickers
Blessed are the jackhammers
Blessed is the big damage
Blessed are the faith healers
Blessed are the moon walkers
Blessed are the snake people
Blessed are the heat seekers...

Blessed are the apemen
(Shout push hammerheads)
Blessed are the shit kickers
Blessed are the jackhammers
Blessed is the big damage
Blessed are the faith healers
(Yes yes hammerheads)
Blessed are the moon walkers
Blessed are the snake people
Blessed are the heat seekers

Shout push hammerheads, bold and resolute
Marching balancing in too far to go back
Yes yes hammerheads, swimming kissing
We are big and clever and we don't know anything

Shout push hammerheads, bold and resolute
Marching balancing in too far to go back
Yes yes hammerheads, swimming kissing
We are big and clever and we don't know anything

Onward hammerheads, bright and dangerous
Jumping running in the field and factory
