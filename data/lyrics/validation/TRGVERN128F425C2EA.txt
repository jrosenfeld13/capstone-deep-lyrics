I used to wake in the afternoon
When the sunshine finally cut through the haze
I really don't remember that much
I just know I wasted a thousand days

We need protection from this infection
Something to ease this cruel disease
A ray of hope in a new direction
I called to you and you rescued me

'Cause when you're around
I feel like I'm born again
I'm through going down
In you I've a better friend

Yes, I know I'm the lucky one
And now I've got a brand new life to live
But one of the ones that didn't get away
They've taken so much, we've got nothing left to give

Now we can do without the reprobation
Let's try some love and some sanity
I know the thousands all over the nation
I thank the Lord that you rescued me

'Cause when you're around
I feel like I'm born again
I'm through going down
In you I've a better friend

I feel like I'm born again
I got this feeling I'm born again

I used to wake in the afternoon
When the sunshine finally cut through the haze
I really don't remember that much
I just know I wasted a thousand days

We need protection from this infection
Something to ease this cruel disease
A ray of hope in a new direction
I called to you and you rescued me

'Cause when you're around
I feel like I'm born again
I'm through going down
In you I've a better friend

'Cause when you're around
I feel like I'm born again
I'm through going down, down, down
In you I've a better friend

'Cause when you're around
I feel like I'm born again
I'm through going down
In you I've a better friend, ohoho

Better friend
