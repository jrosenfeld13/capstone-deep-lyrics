Here I am
Receiving gifts that autumn brings
Time's a thief, a gasp
Who's sprinter comes on frozen wings

Now I know
That time for telling tales is gone
Far from home
Still a brother, once a son

Little one
You're the hope they can't destroy
Even when the strangers come
You know, you'll always be your father's boy
