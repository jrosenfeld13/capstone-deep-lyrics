[Verse 1]
Oh, it's too late
I got hit by the closing door
And as I watch myself reflect
On the wrong side of...

My, you've changed
You turned a corner I'll never go
I admit I feel a bit deceived
You're expecting I'd follow

Bandoliers
To fight me dear
Nobody caused the rift
We've just grown apart now

[Refrain]
Prepare, then take aim and fire
Prepare, then take aim and fire
.. On me
If that's the way it has to be

[Verse 2]
I'm fooling myself
Fooling myself into believing you
And all these fictionary tales
You're telling yourself

[Verse 3]
Selfish
Like a child that's never heard a 'no'
I watch them ever changing you
Never find us

[Pre-Chorus]
Bandoliers
To fight you dear
Nobody caused the rift
I can't become what I'm not
You've always had my heart
So if it must be broken

[Refrain]
Prepare, then take aim and fire
Prepare, then take aim and fire
Prepare, then take aim and fire
Prepare, then take aim and fire

[Breakdown]

Fire away

[Verse 4]
If you must but I only came
Just to let you know
This is goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

Prepare, then take aim and fire
Prepare, then take aim and fire
Cause no-one can make me fire
Cause no-one can make me fire
