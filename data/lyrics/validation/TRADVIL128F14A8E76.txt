All at once we turned our heads
To find each other looking in a different way
Laughter rang and people sang
But up above as night time fell
You ran away
So what do I do now
Secret mission seemed so strange somehow

It happened once it happened twice
I understood and took your love in anyway
Leaving in a new direction
Casual glances, take in every word you say
So special can't be told
Secret missions have you in their hold

Leaving for Rio, ships that pass in the night
Spent a long day together once
Your career at its height
It's so hard to miss you
When I don't even know your name
Never the same
Changes every day

I've heard them say that you're the best
You're never caught and can't be found
And that's the test
I understand just what they mean
I've turned around to see you vanish
Like a dream
Stood on a tightrope for so long
Secret meetings must go wrong

Leaving for Rio, ships that pass in the night
Spent a long day together once
Your career at its height
It's so hard to miss you
When I don't even know your name
Never the same
Changes every day
