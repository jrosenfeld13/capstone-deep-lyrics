Maybe the years have told you
Do you remember when life was just a new day?

You know the story, don't you?
The one they told me when life was slipping away

Ahh, look at the brand new day
Sitting here upon the Milky Way
Ahh, look at the dancing girls
Sitting, holding hands across the world

You got a brand new lady
Just like the one you left down in some other place
Reading all the letters
Saw your face coming through on the Ouija board

Look at the brand new day
Sitting here upon the Milky Way
Ahh, look at the dancing girls
Sitting, holding hands across the world

You heard the words of Aaron
He spoke the truth in these things
Both great and small

You can throw away the ashes
You sweep them over the world on your own accord
If you know the real answer
You'd see the kind of mistakes that you can't afford
