Spider has eight legs you know
Spins its web the patterns flow

There's something in my eye
Bloodshot in disguise
God knows I really tried
Making the big time
Aiming to climb high

Scattered seeds can't fight the cold
Circus horse just wants to hold

There's something in my eye
Bloodshot in disguise
God knows I'm really tired
Let's make the big time
Aiming to climb high

Let's make the big time
Aiming to climb high
Aiming to climb high
