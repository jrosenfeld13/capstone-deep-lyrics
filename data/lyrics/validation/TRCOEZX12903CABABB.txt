The sun is rising up on the east side
A chance for everyone
I've been dreaming of the city for a long time
Far from my hometown
(You...) I see... (Will see...) My dream...
(Your dream...) for real... (Come true...)
(You...) I will... (Will rise...) will rise...
(Above...) above... (The rules...)
Heart is pure and thoughts are clear (Love, release our mind)
Not gonna mess around (You are what you want)
Mum and Daddy would be so proud (Time is taking lies)
City please don't let me down (You are what you mean)

Starlight, can you give me the fame (Starlight)
Can you hurl me the game, Oh Starlight? (Has what you need)
Starlight, can you give me the fame (Starlight)
Can you hurl me the game, Oh Starlight? (Has what you need)

The time has come for me to be someone
A rich man, a superstar
And faith is all we need to be the one
Far from my own ground
(You...) I see... (Will see...) my dream...
(Your dream...) for real... (Come true...)
(You...) I will... (Will rise...) Will rise...
(Above...) above... (The rules...)
Heart is pure and thoughts are clear (Love, release our mind)
Not gonna mess around (You are what you want)
Mum and Daddy would be so proud (Time is taking lies)
City please don't let me down (You are what you mean)

Starlight, can you give me the fame (Starlight)
Can you hurl me the game, Oh Starlight? (Has what you need)
And Starlight, can you give me the fame (Starlight)
Can you hurl me the game, Oh Starlight? (Has what you need)

(BREAK)

Starlight, can you give me the fame (Starlight)
Can you hurl me the game, Oh Starlight? (Has what you need)

Starlight, can you give me the fame (Starlight)
Can you hurl me the game, Oh Starlight? (Has what you need)

And Starlight, can you give me the fame (Starlight)
Can you hurl me the game, Oh Starlight? (Has what you need)

And Starlight, can you give me the fame (Starlight)
Can you hurl me the game, Oh Starlight? (Has what you need)

(Starlight has what you need)
