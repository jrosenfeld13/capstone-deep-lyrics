Stuck in a rut and you can't get out
Wanted to run but I had to doubt
That I was alive like the very first time
I swear to you that this is life
So take me awayto another year
Where everything is so unclear
One day I will understand
All these plans, all these plans

But i just can't figure you out
No, no, I just can't figure you out

You are a mystery
Tell me what's wrong with me
You are a mystery
But you're all that i wanna be lately

The world ain't what it's supposed to be
Does it sicken you, 'cause it sickens me
One day i will learn to swim
Out of this din

If I knew everything about everything
There would be no time for faith
I'm alright

You are a mystery
Tell me what's wrong with me
You are a mystery
Tell me what's wrong with me
You are a mystery
Tell me the answers please
