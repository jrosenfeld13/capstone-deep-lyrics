[Verse 1]
I see the world, feel the chill
Which way to go, windowsill
I see the words on a rocking horse of time
I see the birds in the rain, ohh

[Verse 2]
Oh, dear Dad, can you see me now?
I am myself, like you somehow
I'll ride the wave where it takes me
I'll hold the pain, release me
Ohh, ohh I, ohh ohh

[Verse 3]
Oh, dear Dad, can you see me now?
I am myself like you somehow
I'll wait up in the dark for you to speak to me
How I've opened up, release me
Release me, release me dad, release me
Ohh ohh I, ohh ooh ooo
