[Verse 1]
You're the kind of person
You meet at certain dismal dull affairs
Center of a crowd, talking much too loud
Running up and down the stairs
Well, it seems to me that you have seen too much in too few years
And though you've tried you just can't hide
Your eyes are edged with tears

[Chorus 1]
You better stop
Look around
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes
Here comes your nine-teenth nervous breakdown

[Verse 2]
When you were a child
You were treated kind
But you were never brought up right
You were always spoiled with a thousand toys
But still you cried all night
Your mother who neglected you
Owes a million dollars tax
And your father's still perfecting ways of making sealing wax

[Chorus 1]
You better stop
Look around
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes
Here comes your nine-teenth nervous breakdown

[Chorus 2]
Oh, who's to blame, that girl's just insane
Well nothing I do don't seem to work
It only seems to make matters worse. Oh please

[Verse 3]
You were still in school
When you had that fool
Who really messed your mind
And after that you turned your back
On treating people kind
On our first trip
I tried so hard to rearrange your mind
But after while I realized you were disarranging mine

[Chorus 1]
You better stop
Look around
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes
Here comes your nine-teenth nervous breakdown

[Chorus 2]
Oh, who's to blame, that girl's just insane
Well nothing I do don't seem to work
It only seems to make matters worse. Oh please

When you were a child
You were treated kind
But you were never brought up right
You were always spoiled with a thousand toys
But still you cried all night
Your mother who neglected you
Owes a million dollars tax
And your father's still perfecting ways of making sealing wax
You better stop
Look around

[Outro]
Here comes
Here comes your nine-teenth nervous breakdown
Here comes your nine-teenth nervous breakdown
Here comes your nine-teenth nervous breakdown
Here comes your nine-teenth nervous breakdown
Here comes your nine-teenth nervous breakdown
Here comes your nine-teenth nervous breakdown
