Every morning when I rise, baby
I look into your sexy eyes, baby
Your love refreshing is good to me, baby
There's no other place I'd rather be, baby
What a way to start each day
Everything I think of just comes my way
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause you're my joy, you're everything to me
And you've shown me how groovy life can be
Lips to lips, heart to heart in a way that will never part
Sweetness is the name for you, sugar
And loveliness becomes you too
Dedication is your thing, mama
You're forever true to your man, baby
You're the only one who thrills me through and through
And I'll never find another if I search this whole world through
Oh, no, no, no
'Cause you're my joy, you're everything to me
And you've shown me how groovy life can be
Lips to lips, heart to heart in a way that will never part
Now you know why I smile all the time, baby
You give me such peace of mind, honey
Heartaches and pain is a thing of the past, baby
I found happiness at last, mama
Anything you want I'll gladly give to you
'Cause you never did nothing once
That's why I love you too
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause you're my joy, you're everything to me
And you've shown me how groovy life can be
Lips to lips, heart to heart, oh yeah, in a way that will never part
Keep on loving me
Keep on teasing me
Keep on loving me
