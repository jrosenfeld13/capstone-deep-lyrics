The girls look really really sad
Like a trucker who's breath
Is smelling really bad

From corn nuts and
Cokes and cigarettes
Like an only child
Or kids who have turrets

Like a high school reunion / a dead river

How are you fine i'm doing well
Looks like your wife threw in the towel
I'd rather walk the gang plank
If i must be frank

I banked on my own ideas
Your ship came in but then it sank
I get around ideas

That's life
Forget the inbetweens

That's life
It's all you man

That's life
Just like daddy said

That's life
I'll get the lube man
