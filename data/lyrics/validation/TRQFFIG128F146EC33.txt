[Verse 1]
Just got home from Illinois, lock the front door, oh boy
Got to sit down, take a rest on the porch
Imagination sets in, pretty soon I'm singing
Doo, doo, doo, looking out my back door

[Verse 2]
There's a giant doing cartwheels
A statue wearing high heels
Look at all the happy creatures dancing on the lawn
A dinosaur Victrola, listening to Buck Owens
Doo, doo, doo, looking out my back door

[Bridge]
Tambourines and elephants are playing in the band
Won't you take a ride on the flying spoon?
Doo doo doo
A wondrous apparition, provided by magician
Doo, doo, doo, looking out my back door

[Guitar solo]

[Bridge]
Tambourines and elephants are playing in the band
Won't you take a ride on the flying spoon?
Doo, doo doo
Bother me tomorrow, today I'll buy no sorrows
Doo, doo, doo, looking out my back door

[Verse 3]
Forward troubles Illinois, lock the front door, oh boy
Look at all the happy creatures dancing on the lawn
Bother me tomorrow, today I'll bide no sorrows
Doo, doo, doo, looking out my back door
