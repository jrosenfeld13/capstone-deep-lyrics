[Verse 1]
Gold coast slave ship bound for cotton fields
Sold in the market down in New Orleans
Scarred old slaver knows he's doing alright
Hear him whip the women just around midnight

[Chorus]
Brown sugar how come you taste so good
Brown sugar just like a young girl should- ah hum oh..
Woo!

[Verse 2]
Drums beating, cold English blood runs hot
Lady of the house wonderin' when it's gonna stop
House boy knows that he's doing alright
You shoulda heard em just around midnight

[Chorus]
Brown sugar how come you taste so good now
Brown sugar just like a young girl should- now..
Yeah!

[Chorus]
Ah, get down on brown, brown sugar, how come you taste so good?
Ah, get down, get down brown sugar, just like a black girl should

[Verse 3]
Ah I bet your mama was a tent show queen
And all her boyfriends were sweet sixteen
I'm no schoolboy but I know what I like
You shoulda heard me just around midnight

[Chorus]
Brown sugar how come you taste so good, baby?
Ah, come down brown sugar, just like a young girl should, yeah

[Outro]
I said yeah, yeah, yeah, woo!
How come you...how come you taste so good?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woo!
Just like a...just like a black girl should
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woo!
