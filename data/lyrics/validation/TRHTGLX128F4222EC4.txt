Down in the dump cell, where I can't take no smell
It's like a oven baking for 2 thousand years
When the morning comes, I & I would run to get some tea
Here comes the boss with his baton
Say dreadlocks you don't come here
To drink pea soup and fatten ooh oh

As time and time go by
It's the set for the same everyday
So if you can't do the time don't bother with no crime
Cause the food that you take to save your life can let you lose it the same

It's a warehouse of human slavery
And it doesn't help for a person who need a weekly salary
So if your eyes can't be fulfilled and satisfied
A lot more to come and see those chastised mmmmmm yeah
