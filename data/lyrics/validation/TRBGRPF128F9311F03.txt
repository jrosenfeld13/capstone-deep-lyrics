Come to China for the day
Where you only have to pay
Such a little for your pleasure
At the open shop or takeaway

The streets are very bright
And it's such a pretty sight
I would love to live here all the time
The place where day is always night

I come from Amsterdam
Just to see you and your Eastern ways
I am Mandy-San
Will you come and see me everyday?

Dragons float across the street
With lanterns hanging from the sky
They're black and gold and red and blue
Especially for you

I flew in from Stockholm
Just to see you and your Chinese ways
The palace is my home
Will you come and see me everyday?

Dragons float across the street
With lanterns hanging from the sky
They're black and gold and red and blue
Especially for you

Oh, why am I so beautiful?
Oh, why am I so beautiful?
Oh, why am I so beautiful?

I star in my own films and my viewers think I'm wonderful
I feel so alive when appearing in the carnival

Come to China for the day
Where you only have to pay
Such a little for your pleasure
At the open shop or takeaway

The streets are very bright
And it's such a pretty sight
I would love to live here all the time
The place where day is always night

And I felt it with my heart
I have been to every part
Don't think I ever will get bored
Just want to go back to the start

Come to China for the day
Where you only have to pay
Such a little for your pleasure
At the open shop or takeaway

Oh, why am I so beautiful?
Oh, why am I so beautiful?
Oh, why am I so beautiful?
