Echoing, your words are life to me
Angels sing cause
You are everything but
I'm always about the thrill
It's always about the craze
I'm always about the thrill

You will be my only hope
And I won't walk away
And we will see, we will see
You will be my only hope
And I won't walk away
And we will see, we will see you
My hope on saturday
Was crushed by all your crying!
(I'm afraid the sun is shining
But I see a hand that's writing)

Screaming, weeping
Gasping for you
Yahweh, I will follow you
And yet it seems
I'm always about the thrill
It's always about the craze
I'm always about the thrill
