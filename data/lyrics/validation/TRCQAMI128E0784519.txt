Hello, hello, hello, hello
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anybody home?

Come on now
I hear you're feeling down
Well, I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again
Relax
I need some information first, first
Relax
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship floats on the horizon
You're only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I caught a fever
My hands felt like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This isn't how I am
I-I have become comfortably numb

Okay, okay
It's just a little pinprick
There'll be no more, ha-ha-ha
But you may feel a little sick

Can you stand up now?
I do believe it's working
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Gotta keep it going through the show
Come on, it's time to go
Gotta keep it going through the show
Come on, it's time to go
Gotta keep it going through the show
Come on, it's time to go
Gotta keep it going through the show
Come on, it's time to go

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship floats on the horizon
You're only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look, but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on
The child has grown, the dream is gone
I-I have become comfortably numb
I-I have become comfortably numb

Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
I-I have become comfortably numb
