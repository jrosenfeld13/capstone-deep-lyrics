Ba ba ba ba
We never know what's coming next
I have no clue, i just continue
And gather scenes for my next guess
In from the rues, an artifice
To place an installation now
For all to come, and bring what they think about
You define then torn apart
The recognizable shapes froms its space when it
Starts!
We waited for this day to come
And now it's here so we can leave when we cannot
You know it just because
That speech you wrote, you won't give up
So stand beside insidious ones
With conquered eyes, the things that they're living on
Suicide, your repertoire
They criticize us, to create this relation to
Us!
Go!
You're a fiend!
Go!
You old fiend!
Move on
Move on
