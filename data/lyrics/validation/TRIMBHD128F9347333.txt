It was late and I was sleeping when he called
And I can't remember much he said at all
Just that he was leaving town and must get off the phone
I can't remember when he told me he'd be home
Did he say Sunday noon or one day soon
I think he left with them but what if he said am
Did they go to meet the train or leave to catch a plane
I can't remember but I can't forget he's gone

So I telephoned his house and asked his Mom
If she'd knew where her little boy had gone
I know she must have told me and I heard her loud and clear
But I can't remember anything but tears
Did she say fishing trip or he gave you the slip
Is he off to see the world or to see antoher girl
Did she say he took the car or what a fool you are
I can't remember but I can't forget he's gone
I can't remember but I can't forget he's gone
