When days are gray that's the murmur of the day
When days are blue that's a part of it too
When days are cold then your love calls
It's all in a day, it's all in a day
All in a day, baby
All in a day, all in a day, all in a day
When days are gray it gets a man on his way
When days are blue make a man very true
When days are cold then your lover come to call
It's all in a day, let me tell you
It's all in a day
All in a day, baby, all in a day
If days are gray make a man want to play
If days are blue don't you try to tell me what to do
When days are cold then your lover come to call
All in a day, it's all in a day
All in a day, let me tell you now
All in a day
Oh, baby, came to gray, came to blue, oh
All in a day, all in a day, baby
All in a day, wait for us tomorrow
All in a day
Oh, all in a day
