[Verse 1]
Will you pass me down the wine?
It's getting near that time
What you got tomorrow?
Only pain and sorrow

Will you dance for me tonight?
I promise I won't bite
Let's go see the sun burst
Wait till I go numb first

[Chorus]
And in the mornin' come to us
And if the evenin' showers us
Sing to us

[Verse 2]
Will you break it down for me
'Coz what will be will be
I can hear the thunder
Gonna stop the hunger

[Chorus]
And in the mornin' come to us
And if the evenin' showers us
Sing to us

[Chorus 2]
To all my sisters
Yeah, you're looking really fine
And to all my brothers
Bet you're feelin' kinda high
And to all the mothers
Well, come on now don't be shy
And to all the fathers
Who are sick and fucking tired
