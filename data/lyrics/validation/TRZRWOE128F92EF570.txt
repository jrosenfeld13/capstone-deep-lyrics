I'm not trying to forget you;
I just thought that I'd let you know
It's all explained in this letter
That you left on your bathroom floor
And I will remember
And I will forever now
If all of this is possible
Why can't I just see you tonight?
If all of this is possible
I want to die in your arms
I want to die in your arms
I want to die in your
Die in your, die in your
Die in your arms
Hear the whispers from the backroom
Screams keep you awake at night
I'm still waiting for your last kiss
Nothing ever seems to pass the time
And I will remember
And I will surrender now
If all of this is possible
Why can't I just see you tonight?
If all of this is possible
I want to die in your arms
I want to die in your arms
I want to die in your
Die in your, die in your
Die in your arms
We'll carry on until we fall
It seems like you have forgotten
We'll carry on until we fall
Please don't say that this is the end
If all of this is possible
Why can't I just see you tonight?
If all of this is possible
I want to die in your arms
I want to die in your arms
I want to die in your
Die in your, die in your
Die in your arms
If all of this is possible
If all of this is possible
If all of this is possible
I want to die in your arms
I want to die in your arms
I want to die in your
Die in your, die in your
Die in your arms
