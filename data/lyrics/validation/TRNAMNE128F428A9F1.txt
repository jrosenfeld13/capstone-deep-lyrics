You don't understand what i'm saying to you. but you pretend that you do. i don't find that reasonable in a modern society. we've got a lack of communication. we've got a lack of responsibility. life's not fair and it's a bumpy ride. if you don't hold on you'll find yourself left behind. i don't know what you're saying to me. i can't understand a fucking thing you said. it's all greek to me. "yamo tis" means "fuck this". life's not fair and it's a bumpy ride. so keep your chin up motherfucker. have some pride. if you open your eyes real wide. you'll see your life going by. if you're not getting any wiser then you'll be this dumb 'til you die
