She takes me to silent places
She takes me to cold and quiet streets
She takes me where lovers meet

She takes me to the Dolphin Club
She takes me to the Dolphin Club
She takes me to the Dolphin Club

Forever I've tried to find it
Nobody could tell me left or right
I just assumed I was blinded
But now I have seen the light

She takes me to the Dolphin Club
She takes me to the Dolphin Club
She takes me to the Dolphin Club

She takes me to silent places
She takes me somewhere around the bend
She greets me with warm embraces
She stays with me 'til the end
