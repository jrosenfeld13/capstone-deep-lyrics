Its name mocks its silence
A worthless beast born to violence
Has ears and whiskers flapping
As its yellow flesh comes slapping
Across the rank filth of this ancient subterranean floor
Its hate knows no bounds
As its home knows no sounds
But the SLAMMING
CRASHING
SPLATTING
OF ITS YELLOW FLESH

I am the herald of light

I withdraw a shining glory
A single loving-end of story
The only weakness, a grace like wings
My bow, SINGS!

UNLEASHED!
And in the silver light
My arrows take the flight
UNLEASHED!
Splits Pols Voice's head
And spills his thoughts and dreams
UNLEASHED!
A host of slapping bodies
Comes crashing to my feet
NEAT!

A host of slapping yellow bodies comes crashing in crimson piles
A host of slapping yellow bodies comes crashing in crimson piles
A host of slapping yellow bodies comes crashing in crimson piles
A host of slapping yellow bodies comes crashing

RUNNING AWAY
RUNNING AWAY
RUNNING AWAY from your own voice
RUNNING AWAY
RUNNING AWAY
RUNNING AWAY from Pols Voice
RUNNING AWAY
RUNNING AWAY
RUNNING AWAY from your own voice
RUNNING AWAY
RUNNING AWAY
RUNNING AWAY from Pols Voice

SILENCE!
SILENCE!
SILENCE!
SILENCE!
