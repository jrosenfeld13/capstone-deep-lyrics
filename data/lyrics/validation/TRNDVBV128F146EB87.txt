Trail of broken hearts
Looking back at you
Now and from the start
These words will travel true
The godspeed of trust
Will settle the dust
We've been passing through
Leaving just a part
Down the trail of broken hearts

Broken trail so long
A long and tired past
An emptiness has gone
I've found this place at last
And here will remain
With only the aim
Of staying sure and fast
Leaving just a part
Down the trail of broken hearts
