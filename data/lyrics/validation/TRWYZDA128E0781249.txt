Wined and dined
Oh it seemed just like a dream
Girl was so kind
Kind of love I'd never seen

Only last summer, it's not so long ago
Just last summer, now musk winds blow

Wined and dined
Oh it seemed just like a dream
Girl was so kind
Kind of love I'd never seen

Only last summer, it's not so long ago
Just last summer, now musk winds blow

Wined and dined
Oh it seemed just like a dream
Girl was so kind
Kind of love I'd never seen

Chalk underfoot, life I should prove
Dancing in heat, our love and you

Wined and dined
Oh it seemed just like a dream
Girl was so kind
Kind of love I'd never seen
