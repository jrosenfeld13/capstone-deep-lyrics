Oh, was it luck or misfortune
That brought you to this place
Why have our eyes
Been averted?
Is it mutual distaste?
So happy there
In the spotlight
Moving wings with grace
Shadows they swing from your wingtips
Pushing the air through space

You
Ooooh
You're cutting me right in
Two
Oooh
I'm saving myself for
You
Oohh
You're cutting me right in
Two

She never danced with me anyway
Is this so wrong? it's been so long...

Oh, you and i aren't so different
With perilous desire;
I think i could die by her tongue
And you, drawn to the fire
And aren't we so forgetful?
Why am i in this place?
Why are you there on the ceiling
Pushing the air through space?

White moth you stole the show
White moth you're all i know
This feels like it's home
Now
White moth you're all i know

White moth you stole the show
White moth you're all i know
This feels like i'm home
Now
White moth you stole the show
