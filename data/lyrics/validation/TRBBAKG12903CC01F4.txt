Time to resist
Time to rethink
Closed eyes
Victims of poison kings
Darkness while the pendulum swings
After the flood
Such precious things
When did we all go blind?
When did we lose our light?

In every flame is a raging fire
In every voice is a holy choir
In every house is a cherished home
In every cloud
A perfect storm

In your darkest hour, only hope will hold your hand
For only suffering makes a stronger man

Should we follow the eye of the storm?
Finding our centre and a spirit reborn
Shake off your robe of sorrow
To be burnt by the sun
In infinity's hour speak courage to cowards
Speak truth to power

Don't wait, don't rest
We're on the edge of divinity
No place is left
For plastic hymns of fake reality

In your darkest hour, only hope will hold your hand!
