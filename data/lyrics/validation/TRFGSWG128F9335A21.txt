A thousand houses where i don't belong
But the warm lights look like honey way out here
There's a wind in the branches
And i know this song
But the moon's a judge you cannot persuade
So i try and tell myself i had to go
She'd have missed me more if i had stayed

Such a blue and flawless night
Just don't seem right without you near
I would give you my ring and everything just to hear
Closer, come closer to me

I told her how i spell my name
But she pretended not to know
It begins with spring and ends in rain
Now when i sleep i hear you breathe
It comes from all directions in my dreams
Thought i'd close my eyes and make you leave
Pass your house wonder what went wrong
The warm lights look like heaven from out here
And the wind on the windshield plays our song
