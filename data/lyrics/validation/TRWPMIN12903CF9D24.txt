On The Beat Pete

Up I rush off to work
Hello Fred you look half dead and
Are you coming are you going
I could never do a double shift
(Allo Fred get some bed Fred)

Hello Steve long time no see
I like the Stones still on the thieve
Bet you ain't half seen some time
In your short-lived life of crime
(By the way, have you got the time ?)

On the beat Pete
Wiv me size ten feet
I wander up and down the town
For me that's a treat
The beauties of the city and
Everything's sweet
For me that's a treat
'Cos I'm on the beat Pete
Swing my truncheon merrily
Try to teach the blind to see
Move a lady for a seat
Tourist find a sight to see
Mingle with the crowd
I wonder if they're proud
Yes, that would be a treat
'Cos I'm on the beat Pete... beat Pete

Hello Snowball, you still drunk ?
Here have a smoke, anyone for lunch ?
A printed person of last week's times
Seen a lot of stars and moonshine
(Spare you a dime ?)

On the beat Pete
Wiv me size ten feet
I wander up and down the town
For me that's a treat
The beauties of the city and
Everything's sweet
For me that's a treat
'Cos I'm on the beat Pete
Swing my truncheon merrily
Try to teach the blind to see
Move a lady for a seat
Tourist find a sight to see
Mingle with the crowd
I wonder if they're proud
Yes, that would be a treat
'Cos I'm on the beat Pete... beat Pete

Hello Bun been down the oven ?
What's the rate for a single person ?
Is it good, is it sad ?
You look unhappy it must be bad

Hello May been a busy lady
All work and no time for play
Still it's the life you chose I suppose
Good luck to you come what may !
Skip-a-di-do-da-days !

On the beat Pete
Wiv me size ten feet
I wander up and down the town
For me that's a treat
The beauties of the city and
Everything's sweet
For me that's a treat
'Cos I'm on the beat Pete
Swing my truncheon merrily
Try to teach the blind to see
Move a lady for a seat
Tourist find a sight to see
Mingle with the crowd
I wonder if they're proud
Yes, that would be a treat
'Cos I'm on the beat Pete... beat Pete
