Please don't speak another truth out loud
Whatever else you do
I only want you keep me lost in your cloud
I'll do the same for you
Don't believe a single thing you've heard
Really, I'm as good as gold
You don't need to sell me with another word
I'm already sold

If I give in to your open arms
Then you can think the worst of me
For pulling out my weakness like a charm
And making sure you'd see
Love, when it's defeated, just remember
Can still keep you in its hold
No need now to tempt me with surrender
I'm already sold

What was that, A lonesome battle cry?
Sweeping in upon us from the rear?
Like a child, I hide my eyes
And think I've disappeared
Mercy, hope, faith and love and treason
Are trump as long as darkness holds
I don't need to see the sun, there's no reason
I'm already sold
