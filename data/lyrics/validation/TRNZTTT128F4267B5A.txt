When the pain of love gets rough
Will you run away saying that you had enough
When the pain of love gets strong
Will you feel that you just can't carry on
Will you sigh will you cry will you die
Will you hang on and say "we can make it baby"
Will you give up and swear to God you've had enough
Tell me will you try to fake it baby

When the pain of love gets rough
Will you run away saying that you had enough
When the pain of love gets strong
Will you feel that you just can't carry on

When the road gets a little bit rocky
Will you turn your back girl and go the other way
When the road gets a little bit muddy
Will you feel you can try it on another day
Tell me is it fair when you care
To even dare take a heart and break it
Is it wise to apologize
Hang on strong and try to take it baby

When the pain of love gets rough
Will you run away saying that you had enough
When the pain of love gets strong
Will you feel that you just can't carry on

Will you sigh will you cry will you die
Will you hang on and say "we can make it baby"
Will you give up and swear to God you've had enough
Tell me will you try to fake it baby

When the pain of love gets rough
Will you run away saying that you had enough
Tell me now
When the pain of love gets strong
Will you feel that you just can't carry on

When the pain is so strong
Tell me that you got enough
When the pain is so strong
Baby tell me you can hold on
