[Verse 1: will.i.am.]
Mas Que Nada
Black Eyed Peas came to make it hot-ter
We be the party starters
Bubblin' up just like lava
Like lava - heated like a sauna
Penetrating through your body armor
Rhythmically we massage ya
With hip hop mixed up with samba -
With samba

[Refrain]
So yes yes y`all
You know we never stop we never rest y`all (y'all)
The Black Eyed Peas'll keep it funky fresh y`all
And we won't stop until we get y'all, til we get y'all sayin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Taboo]
Peter Piper picked peppers
But Tab rocked rhymes-a
1,2,3,4, several times-a
Heavy rotation played by every kind-a
Radio stations blastin' every mind-a
We crossing boundaries like everyday
To rock ya robbie bobbie beamer on the bay
We got we got Tab magnification Tab magnified
Like every day

[Refrain]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: apl.de.ap]
Drop hot hot be my daily operation
Got to put in work in this crazy occupation
Gotta keep it movin' (that's the motivation)
Gotta ride the waves and keep a tight relation
With my team keeping moving, and doing it right
I've been in a lab every day 'til daylight
That's the way things move in this monkey business

[Will.i.am.]
(We took an old samba song and remixed it)

[Gracinha Leporace]
Mas Que Nada
Sai da minha frente
Eu quero passar
Pois o samba esta animado
O que eu quero e sambar
Este samba
Que e misto de maracatu
E samba de preto velho
Samba de preto tu

[Verse 4: Fergie]
Mas Que Nada, we gonna make you feel lil hotter
The Peas and Sergio Mendes heating up sambaaaa
Bada, bada, bada, baaaaaa
Bada, bada, bada
[Will.i.am.] Sergio, play yo piano... Sergio, play yo yo yo yo yo piano
