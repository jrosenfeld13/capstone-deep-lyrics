When whippoorwills call and evening is nigh
I hurry to my blue heaven
Just a turn to the right, you'll find a little white light
Will lead you to my Blue Heaven

You'll see a smiling face, a fireplace, a cozy little room
A little nest that nestles where the roses bloom
Just Marley and me, and baby makes three
We're happy in my blue heaven

You'll see a smiling face, a fireplace, a cozy little room
A little nest that nestles where the roses bloom
Just Marley and me, and baby makes three
We're happy in my blue heaven
So happy in my blue heaven
