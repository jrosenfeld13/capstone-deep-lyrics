[Verse 1]
Woke up laughing
Naked by the door
You were on my mind
Good love is hard to find
Tell me to stay
Look into my eyes
Waste away the time
Bad love is all I find

[Chorus]
So I keep waiting to touch somebody
Keep you closer, on my body
To love somebody
To kiss somebody
I wanna touch somebody
'Cause I love somebody
I wanna touch somebody
I wanna touch somebody

[Verse 2]
Find me a face
That I wanna hold
That I can memorize
Good love is hard to find
Good love is hard to find

[Chorus]
So I keep waiting to touch somebody
Keep you closer, on my body
To love somebody
To kiss somebody
I wanna touch somebody
'Cause I love somebody

[Bridge]
Come on baby, give me good love
Sometimes touch just isn't enough
Come on baby, give me good love
Sometimes touch just isn't enough
Good love, good love, good
Good love, good love, good
Good love, good love, good

[Chorus]
So I keep waiting to touch somebody
Keep you closer, on my body
To watch somebody
To kiss somebody
I wanna touch somebody
'Cause I love somebody

[Outro]
Give me good love
Good love
Good love (give me good love)
Good love
Give me your love
Good love (to be somebody)
Good love (I wanna touch somebody)
Good love ('cause I love somebody)
Give me good love
Good love
Good love (give me good love)
Good love
Give me your love (to watch somebody)
Good love (to kiss somebody)
Good love (I wanna touch somebody)
Good love ('cause I love somebody)
Give me good love
