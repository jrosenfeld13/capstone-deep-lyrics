Everybody knows my name
Everybody wants the fame
Everybody wants to see
Everybody wants a piece of me
Everybody wants the fun
Everybody needs the gun
Everybody be so kind
Still got my piece of mind
Everybody knows my name
Everybody can you feel my pain?

I was born a poor boy, left home when I was four
Momma never named me so I never was for sure
I learned to read enough to know Life was not so kind
All I own is my guitar and a little peace of mind

Everybody knows my name
Everybody play the game
Everybody wants the fame
Everybody knows my name

I went out into the world to find my place in life
I'm learning more every day surviving really bites
They ask me for a line of coke, needles, knives and guns
I said to myself I've found home 'cause this place sounds like fun

Everybody knows my name
Everybody play the game
Everybody wants the fame
Everybody knows my name

I've seen holy rollers, midnight strollers
Cops shake with fear
High heels clicking, red lipstick an'
Blood, sweat and tears
I've read about a man who died on a cross
For everybody's sins
If you want to make a change
You've got to put your faith in him
I've seen the limelight in New York City
I've seen the rainbow in Hollywood
I walked the streets of London England
The streets of gold look so good

I voted for their politicians
I've seen all the dirty religions
I wore their three piece suits
But I did not wear their army boots
I didn't fire the guns of war
I never knew what we were fighting for
Everybody wants the fame
Everybody knows my name

Everybody wants the fame
Everybody knows my name
