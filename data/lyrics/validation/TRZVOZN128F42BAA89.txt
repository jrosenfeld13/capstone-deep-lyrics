[Chorus]
I got it bad, I got it blue
I got it sad, I ain't got you
I did you wrong, you got the right
Look what I had, I got it bad

[Verse 1]
Gone and left me lonely, crying like a fool
I just can't believe love could be so cruel

[Chorus]
I got it bad, I got it blue
I got it sad, I ain't got you
I did you wrong, you got the right
Look what I had, I got it bad

[Verse 2]
I know someday I'll get on my feet again
I'll get over you, but baby, until then

[Chorus]
I got it bad, I got it blue
I got it sad, I ain't got you
I did you wrong, you got the right
Look what I had, I got it bad
Look what I had, I got it bad
