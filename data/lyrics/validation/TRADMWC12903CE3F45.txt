Gotta get out of here
Nothing for me here
Nothing to do, nowhere to go
No words to say, no thoughts to think
Oooooo I'm leaving. The pressure building up on me
The air is really thick
Can't breathe. I'm leaving
I'm running, I'm running, running out of time
Out of breath and out of desperation
Now you see me, now you don't
Can't stay here much longer
Situation I've been making for myself
Can't take it, I'm leaving, I'm running
I'm running, catch my freedom
..Now you see me
But I won't be here for long
I gotta get out, out from under you
(What are you trying to make me do?)
I'm running, I'm running
Gotta get out, gotta catch my freedom
I'm running, I'm running
Running out of desperation
Gotta get out and catch my freedom
Gotta get what I can
See I'm running
Out of desperation
