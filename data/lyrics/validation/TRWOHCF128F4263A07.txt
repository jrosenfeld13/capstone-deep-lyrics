I used to live in a two-room apartment
Neighbors knocking on my wall
Times were hard, I don't wanna knock it
I don't miss it much at all

Oh yeah I'm alright
I just feel a little lonely tonight
I'm okay, most of the time
I just feel a little lonely tonight

I used to need your love so badly
Then I came to live with it
Lately I get a faraway feeling
And the whole thing starts again

Oh yeah I'm alright
I just feel a little lonely tonight
I'm okay, most of the time
I just feel a little lonely tonight

[Instrumental bridge]

Oh yeah I'm alright
I just feel a little lonely tonight
I'm okay, most of the time
I just feel a little lonely tonight
