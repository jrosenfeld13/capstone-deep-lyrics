Everybody gets compromised
You gotta hit it now

Chorus:
Everybody gets compromised (2x)
Understand it
Everybody gets compromised (2x)
Do you understand it
Wait a minute Tiger
Put the flour, one tablespoon of sugar, milk and
Eggs into a food processor or medium sized
Bowl. Stir in the cheddar cheese and apple
Wedges. Mix under a nitrogen atmosphere
And wash with tartaric acid solution for six hours
When the apple is tender and beginning to
Brown, remove from the heat. Determine the
Reaction with hexane and induce crystallization
Pour the batter over the wedges. Extract
Residue with chrolophorm to get a high quality
White product. Sprinkle thickly with sugar
Cut and serve
Chorus
Mmm... that seemed to go down all right
Chm chm chm
Next time we will be making
Plum dumplings
In our special sauce
Toodle pip
