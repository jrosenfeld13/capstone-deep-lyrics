This is seeeds ear I
And I appear in here
With illvibe
For our tribe
For all our people doing their thing
You are king
Keep going
Appear you are right

We bend your knees
We are real
To make you feel so glad

We need the sweet

We use our keys
Cool heat
We like to feed our head

We need the sweet

Born for Peace
There is no need
For us to bleed so bad

We need the sweet

Time to release our breed
Life could be so sweet
Instead

How do you feel
Our wind blo
Ws mad

Ride with me
We pass the dead

Turn your wheel
The light shows what you get

And now take that:

There is gold in the mine
We need the sweet
Hold that beat
Make it shine
There is gold in the mine
We need the sweet
Hold that beat
Make it shine (it shine)

There is gold in the mine
We need the sweet
Hold that beat
Make it shine
There is gold in the mine
We need the sweet
Hold that beat
Make it shine (it shine)

Spice this realize this
In us we trust
And reflect wide eyes
Wild styles we bust ideas
And we act wise in open files
Not just for ears this track
Is to dance miles on our sunrise
We are nice we and this try
Should last til we are past
We blast this sound packed
Here is what we select

There is gold in the mine
We need the sweet
Hold that beat

Hold that beat
