Whoa whoa whoa mama
Here I go whoa again
Too fast on the downhill
Faster than I can run

If miles turned to inches
You know that man would roll
All the way around the world tonight
Look at him go
No jumping off the ride
At 30 miles per hour
Iron brains and ball bearings
Give him the power

Whoa whoa take a look
Whoa whoa look at that man
Whoa whoa you can see it
That man is free

Whoa whoa whoa mama
Here I go whoa again
Too fast on the downhill
Faster than I can roll

You got to see him to believe him
Can't you hear 'em callin'
You got to hear him, there's no fear
In that man
Can't you hear 'em callin'
He's like a mean molten gold
Can't you hear 'em callin'
Lord, he's got to have his story told
Can't you fear you're fallin'
Tongue tip slip'n in and out like a lizard
Can't you fear you're fallin'
Ah, good god, that man'a a damn wizard
Can't you hear 'em callin'
Black hair snapn' like a bull whip in the air
Can't you feel you're fallin'
Red roll'n wheels run'n for the downhill
Dare me!
