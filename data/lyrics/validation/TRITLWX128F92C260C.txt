[Verse 1]
Well the road was hot and flat as a ruler
Good hundred miles between me and Missoula
That vinyl top wasn't getting' no cooler
I stopped at a quickie sack
Well I figured I'd need about a sixth of Miller
And one of those things so I wouldn't spill her
I asked the girl if the beer was in the back
She said

[Chorus 1]
It's a dry town
No beer, no liquor for miles around
I'd give a nickel for a sip or two
To wash me down
Outta this dry town

[Verse 2]
So I turn right around, no hesitation
Cursed the law for running' the nation
Waved goodbye to the boy at the station
But she wouldn't go in gear

[Verse 3]
He said it sounds like your transmission
You need Bob, but he's gone fishing'
His day off, he gets a long way from here
Cause

[Chorus 2]
Well back home friends you can get a dose of
Something strong from your local grocer
So I walked down 'till I got a little closer
To a place called Happy Johns

[Bridge]
He said I keep something here for colds and fevers
Down underneath where I usually leave her
Just last night I felt a cold coming on

[Chorus 1]
