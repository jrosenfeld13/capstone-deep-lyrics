(Harlan Howard and Buck Owens)

They just don't know
How lost I feel without you
My teardrops never see the light of day
I laugh and joke each time they talk about you
But if they heard my heart they'd hear it say

Chorus
Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache
There's an aching deep inside
And it just won't be denied
Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache
And I'd better say goodbye before I cry

I guess it's pride that makes me hide my sorrow
I live a lie in all I do and say
My lips may lie and paint a bright tomorrow
But if I told the truth I'd have to say

Repeat chorus

And I'd better say goodbye before I cry
