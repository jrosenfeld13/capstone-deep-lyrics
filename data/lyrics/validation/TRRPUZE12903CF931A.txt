We were always meant to be
And even if you disagree
You could never get away
With your arm chained to the gate

Sometimes i can't control the things i do
But you know i only want the best for you
Is it too much to ask to hear you say?
I will not defy you

And if something goes awry
I'll forgive you love, in time
There's no secret you can't keep
There's no cut that is too deep

Sometimes i can't control the things i do
But you know i only want the best for you
And if i should find that you could ever stray
I would crucify you

Oh, and i will run you through
To show i care, to long for you
Promises i'll hold you to
And you to me, an eye to you

Oh, and i will run you through
To show i care, to long for you
Promises i'll hold you to
And you to me, i'm watching you

Sometimes i can't control the things i do
But you know i only want the best for you
Somehow you never seem to go my way, hey hey
So i must crucify you
