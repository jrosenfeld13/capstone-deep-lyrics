[Verse 1]
You got me down
Running all around this town
'Cause you think you're ahead of the game
But I'll let you know
Baby you don't run the show
When it comes to my happiness or pain
Of course it's true
That it's all that I can do
Just to keep up with all your crazy tricks
At my expense you build up your confidence
But baby you just don't know when you're late

[Hook]
'Cause
I'm gonna get you baby
I'm gonna get you yes I am
Love's gonna get you baby
Oh oh ooh yeah
I'm gonna get you baby
I'm gonna get you yes indeed
Love's gonna get you baby
So don't you try to run from me
No, no

[Verse 2]
You must admit that it doesn't quite fit
The way you keep me runnin' so hard
If you don't care
Then why act so scared?
When I send to you my calling card
You should be flattered
That to me it really matters
In this chase whether I lose or I win
You ain't fast enough to keep me from catching up
So why don't you just turn yourself in?

[Hook]
'Cause
I'm gonna get you baby
I'm gonna get you yes I am
Love's gonna get you baby
I'm gonna get you yes I am
I'm gonna get you baby
I'm gonna make you my man
Love's gonna get you baby
Don't you try to run from me

[Verse 3]
Your lead can dance
'Cause you know I'm way too fast
And of course this is only a test
I've got the power to chase you by the hour
So I'm taking your heart under arrest
I'm a deputy of love
And if you are thinking of
When it comes to committing a crime
Baby you have seen
It's just grand larceny
When I feel your love and make it mine

[Break]

[Verse 4]
Why waste your time?
You know you gonna be mine
There is no escape from my master plan
Soon you will be
Locked up in my heart's custody
Then you wonder why you ever ran

[Hook]
Don't you know that love's gonna get you
Don't you know that love's gonna get you baby
You know that
You know that love's gonna get you
It's gonna get you
Love's gonna get you baby
It's waiting out there for you
Love's gonna get you
One day boy
Don't you know that?
Love's gonna get you baby
Gonna turn around and stand
You know
Love's gonna get you
Love love love love
Love's gonna get you baby

[Outro]
Do you know that baby
Love's gonna get you
It's looking over you
Love's gonna get you baby
Locked up in my heart's custody
Love's gonna get you
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
Love's gonna get you baby
One day you'll see that
Love's gonna get you
Reach out your arms and grab you, boy
Love's gonna get you baby
Love's gonna get you
I've been loving
I've been had to have you
Love's gonna get you baby
Now I'm gonna get you
I'm gonna satisfy all them great needs
Love's gonna get you
Oh oh
