Lying around, there's no need to lie
First it's in your heart, then it's in your eyes
Lie down the line, you can't take the truth
The way I am, I can't feel you move

I can't feel you move, I can't feel you move

Layers of skin I can't touch within
Heard it in your voice, read it in your eyes
Lie down the line, you can't take the truth
My head is sore, I can't feel you move

I can't feel you move, I can't feel you move

Running around, there's no need to lie
First it's in your heart, then it's in your eyes

I can't feel you move, I can't feel you move
I can't feel you move
