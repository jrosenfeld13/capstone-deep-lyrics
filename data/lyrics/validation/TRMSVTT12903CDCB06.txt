I never thought that it would be this way and I won't forget the song we sang that day. I remember how it felt when the trumpet sang, but now that feeling has all but gone away

It's not too late to fix what has been set wrong, inviting you to come back where you belong
But this song was written on your heart, before you let it's melody depart. We used to be so strong...but if only you could remember, than we could endure together. We could look fear in the face and say...we never want to be this way again

It's hard to believe that it turned out like this, we're spitting angry words and clinching our fists. It's time to show the world that we're more than just kids, cause this is not the way that we were meant to live

It's not too late to fix what has been set wrong, inviting you to come back where you belong
But this song was written on your heart, before you let it's melody depart. We used to be so strong...but if only you could remember, than we could endure together. We could look fear in the face and say...we never want to be this way again

On that cold December we stood and fought together, with fire in our hearts, that day set you apart. When the war was over we all came home as soldiers, beaten but not broken, ready to live again

Never again!

It's not too late to fix what has been set wrong, inviting you to come back where you belong
But this song was written on your heart, before you let it's melody depart. We used to be so strong...but if only you could remember, than we could endure together. We could look fear in the face and say...we never want to be this way, we never want to act this way, I never want to be this way again
