In a world of troubled times
Politics are redefined
Thoughts and actions are the way
That change the path we see today
Bombs & missiles miss their mark
A futile point we can't embark
Peace requires consciousness
Or fall beyond the great abyss

Predict the fate you want to see
Create the world reality
Lessons learned are somehow lost
Another major holocaust
Change requires discipline
A subtle point where we begin
Start with changing your own mind
And open it to see mankind

In times of hate, anguish and pain
A precise mind seems lost again
It isn't easy about to decide
What is wrong and what is right
The simple truths are all inside
Leave the past we left behind
War or Peace is just a choice
Spread the word in your own voice

Predict the fate you want to see
Create the world reality
Lessons learned are somehow lost
Another major holocaust
Change requires discipline
A subtle point where we begin
Start with changing your own mind
And open it to see mankind
