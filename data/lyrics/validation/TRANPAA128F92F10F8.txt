[Verse 1]
I keep looking for a way to travel
Hold on
A wider road or a [?]
Hold on
I'm tempted by every witches' sabbath
Hold on
Oh I'm looking for a taste of saintliness

[Chorus 1]
I say we can make it
You know we can take it
Oooh
How long before I'm gone

[Verse 2]
[?] red hot [?] morning
Hold on
I shared my shade with a man in drag
Hold on
After we saw some things together
Hold on
[?] gave us some wine in a paper bag
Hold on

[Chorus 2]
You know we can make it
You know we can take it
Oooh
How long before I'm gone

[Instrumental Solo]

[Chorus 3]
We can make it
I said we can take it
Oooh
How long before I'm gone

[Verse 3]
Last time someone in the garden upset me
Last time how easily he came to forget me
And I've reached a sensitive stage
And I feel the coming of age
Next time I could be expected to see things
Next time I may have to show I can be things
And I just can't know in advance
What's the feeling of dance
Next time
Next time
Oh next time

[Interlude]

[Verse 4]
[?] can we do it this time
[?] again
They got to know there's a fire burnin'
Cooking the red sky
Yes we're gettin' our bikes together
Gettin' the mood and the [?]
Give us a chance, we'll take our chances
Blow 'em all sky high in the sky
High in the sky
Sky high

[Brass Solo]

[Verse 5]
Got my eye on some lizard slippers
Supposed to take my feet away
Supposed to take my time out shoppin'
Oh but I can't write no checks today

[Chorus 4]
You know we can make it
I said we can take it
Oooh
How long before I'm gone
You know we can make it
I said we gonna take it
Oooh
How long before I'm gone
