[Verse 1]

Here's to the gods and their seats on high
Nobody knows anything
Here's to the flags in their guilty sky
Nobody says anything

[Pre-Chorus]

And this aside, this coast is clear
It doesn't help, it doesn't help me

[Chorus]

Who am I?
Only one more life that you can owe me
It's civilised, it's civilised, it's civil in
Who am I?
Only one more lie that you can owe me
It's civilised, it's civilised, it's civil sin

[Verse 2]

Here's to the crown in their Sunday best
Nobody knows anything
Here's to the crowd, slaves who never rest
Nobody says anything

[Pre-Chorus]

And this aside, this coast is clear
Until one man buys the whole show
And this aside, my mind is clear
It doesn't help, it doesn't help me

[Chorus] (x2)
