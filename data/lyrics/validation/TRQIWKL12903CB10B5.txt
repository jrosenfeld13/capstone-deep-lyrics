Into this world we're thrown
A lifeform without a home
Clowns in a circus called the material world

Gods without immortality
Nothing to lose
Nothing to gain
Nothing to keep
We're shepherds of dreams

We are what we are
Liars, lepers, losers, loners, lovers
The meaning of life
And I want to touch your astral body

We are what we are
We're so full of light
Don't let it die
And I want to touch your astral body

And if I put pennies on your eyes
Or pyramids on your grave
Mysteries mountain high
The day I have to go

But before I leave
I just want to feel love
I want to touch somebody else than me

We are what we are
Liars, lepers, losers, loners, lovers
The meaning of life
And I want to touch your astral body

We are what we are
We're so full of light
Don't let it die
And I want to touch your astral body
