Went down to Mexico on the Fourth of July
I got a tattoo of a moth and a butterfly
Had a little time to burn, a little money to spend
And so I bought a switchblade for each of my friends

Pablo and Dan had a plan said
"We're gonna get rich
Put the double cross
On a double crossin' narco-snitch
Just a dirty little two-man job
But it's a sure-fire win
And brother when we cut him down
We gonna cut you in."

Yeah dumb and drunk as I was
You know I'd do it all again
Back when I bought a switchblade
For each of my friends

They were sharp enough to stab
Another hole in the sky
Hard enough to make the proudest diamond sigh
Faster than the rockets on the Fourth of July
Strong and cruel enough
To make a statue of Mary cry...

They said, "Amigo don'tcha worry
Now we gonna disappear
Couple of months" they said
Now it's been almost a year
I know that if you want that kind of money
Man you gotta stay brave
Federales are pullin' bodies out of shallow graves

Yeah dumb and drunk as I was
You know I'd do it all again
Back when I bought a switchblade
For each of my friends

They were sharp enough to stab
Another hole in the sky
Hard enough to make the proudest diamond sigh
Faster than the rockets on the Fourth of July
Strong and cruel enough
To make a statue of Mary cry...

Later in the fall, I got the call, "Boy won'tcha come down
Maybe put a name with a few unlucky faces we found."
Now no matter what I do, can't get my heart to mend
Somebody buried a switchblade in each of my friends

Yeah dumb and drunk as we was
You know I'd do it all again
Before I buried a switchblade
With each of my friends

They were sharp enough to stab another hole in the sky
Hard enough to make the proudest diamond sigh
Faster than the rockets on the Fourth of July
Strong and cruel enough
To make a statue of Mary cry...

Yeah, they were sharp enough to stab another hole in the sky
Hard enough to make the proudest diamond sigh
Faster than the rockets on the Fourth of July
Strong and cruel enough
To make a statue of Mary cry...
