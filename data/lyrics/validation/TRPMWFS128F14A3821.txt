[Instrumental break]
(Music is what I'm living for)

Everybody loves to dance
With another summer romance oh baby
Everybody likes to move
All the fellows having the groove oh baby

Everybody move your feet
To the rhythm of this beat
Everybody sing this song
All the people having fun

Everybody move your feet
To the rhythm of this beat
Everybody sing this song
All the people having fun

[Verse 1]
Music is what I'm living for
Hit the dance floor like there ain't no more
Ain't no more time for taking your chance
Jam digidi jam to the summer romance
Wave your hands in the air everyone and everywhere
Move your body jump around check it out with the sound
Everybody everybody get up and sing it loud
This is the sound that makes you feel proud

[Chorus]
Everybody hear tonight
You'll never start a fight oh baby
Everybody's feeling proud
If you feel it say it loud oh baby

Everybody move your feet
To the rhythm of this beat
Everybody sing this song
All the people having fun

Everybody move your feet
To the rhythm of this beat
Everybody sing this song
All the people having fun

When the sun goes down, and the night moves on
The time is right, to enjoy the sounds
And doing whatever you wanna do
I mean everybody

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Pleasure and pain sometimes the same
I'm not the shame there's no name for the game
The game that makes my heart still pumping
Boom boom my body is jumping
Love everyday and night
The sign for peace is shining bright
Everybody everybody get up and sing it loud
This is the song that makes you feel proud


[Chorus]
Everybody move your feet
To the rhythm of this beat
Everybody sing this song
All the people having fun

Everybody move your feet
To the rhythm of this beat
Everybody sing this song
All the people having fun

Everybody move your feet
To the rhythm of this beat
Everybody sing this song
All the people having fun

Everybody move your feet
To the rhythm of this beat
Everybody sing this song...
