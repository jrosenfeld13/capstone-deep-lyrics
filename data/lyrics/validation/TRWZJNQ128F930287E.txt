You said you never could love me
Unless I was nice
I know my conscience has told me
I better think twice

You said my home was a chessboard
With no place to play
I know I move my decisions
But that's how I play

You ask me to hold you tight
Whenever the feeling's right
I know that I want you to stay
So please don't go away

You said I'd never be with you
But I'm by your side
I'd cross the waterless desert
To be by your side
Always think twice
You better think twice

You ask me to hold you tight
Whenever the feeling's right
I know that I want you to stay
So please don't go away

You ask me to hold you tight
Whenever the feeling's right
I know that I want you to stay
So please don't go away

Our love's as strong as the heavens
'cause god's on our side
No one could ever believe us
You better think twice
You better think twice
You better think twice
You better think twice
You better think twice
You better think twice
You better think twice
