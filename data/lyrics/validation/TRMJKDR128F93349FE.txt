If I go down to the tavern, babe, I won't come back
If I go down to the tavern, babe, I won't come back
Tryin' to do better, tryin' to get myself together
Take my hand, you gotta, pull me back on track
My bed is made in the gutter but I won't lie down
My bed is made in the gutter but I won't lie down
I can't stay here forever, I gotta, get myself together
Pick me up you gotta turn my luck around
But I'm a man with hurricane hot on my heels I say
Anywhere, anywhere away from here
There's a weight in me and it won't let me go
Gonna shine, shine, good as I know
But I do need you
Who would keep me on the straight and the narrow
On the road, 'cause you know that I go
A little bit of track with the bottle
But you know I think, the more you think the less you understand. And the more I try to get things right the less that go as planned. Man, man
When I go down to station will you come with me?
When I go down to the station will you come with me?
Wanna leave this stormy weather, gonna get our things together
Morning train is gonna have us both set free
But I'm a man with hurricane hot on my heels I say
Anywhere, anywhere away from here
There's a weight in me and it won't let me go
Gonna shine, shine, good as I know
But I do need you
Who would keep me on the straight and the narrow
On the road, 'cause you know that I go
A little bit of track with the bottle
But you know I think, the more you think the less you understand. And the more I try to get things right the less that go as planned. Oh man, oh man
