Can you tell
By the spell that im under
This fella wonderin if he'll ever get next to you
Is there a chance getting through
Well you never seem to notice me
No matter what I do
But everbody in town knows im crazy over you

Theres no show
Theres no coffee or kisses
The doctors says this is the last thing I'll every do
I'd break right in two
Well you never seem to notice me
No matter what I do
But everybody in town knows im crazy over you

Everybody knows that im been after you girl!
Come on sweet baby lets get it over
Give it up darlin' ill make you all mine
We can be together lovin all the time
All the time!
