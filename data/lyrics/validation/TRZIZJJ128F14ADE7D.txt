We're at the top of the world
You and I
We've got a lot of time
And it sure feels right
'Cause you reached in your pocket
And pulled out a pass
That says you can take me anywhere

We're on the top of the world
Here tonight
We've got a lot of time
And it sure feels right
'Cause I'm up here running behind you
I'm up here running in repeat

Sha la la la
Sha la la la
Sha la la la la

We're at the top of the world
You and I
We've got a lot of time
And it sure feels right
'Cause you reached in your pocket
And pulled out a pass
You can take me anywhere
You can take me anywhere
You can take me anywhere
You can take me anywhere
You can take me anywhere
