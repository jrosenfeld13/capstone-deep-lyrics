Got to feed the human nature
Got to be a real true Jet setter
Got to feed the human nature
Got to be a real go getter

(a & b at the same time)

(a)
I've had my fill
It made me ill
And now I see
That you and me are meant to be
A tragedy

(b)
In my head
I said you're in my heart
You are in my blood
I'm going to phone
In my book
I said you're in my blood
I said you're in my bones
I'm going to phone

Got to feed the human nature
You must pursue the grand adventure
Got to feed the human nature
You got to lead the life god gave you

It made me ill
And now I see
That you and me are meant to be
A tragedy

(b)
In my head
I said you're in my heart
You are in my blood
I'm going to phone
In my book
I said you're in my blood
I said you're in my bones

Dialing Darling
Dialing my Darling (x2)

(at the same time as above)
Well I am dialing
Well I am dialing
On the telephone
On the telephone
On the telephone
On the telephone
I'm going to call you up
We're going to have a conversation
I am dialing
I think I love you
What am I so afraid of
So what am I so afraid of
I'm going to call you up
I'm going to call you up
I'm going to call you up

It's a scam and it's run by a man with a gun
And you know that he's never going to let you have fun (x2)
