Christmas 1979 everything was looking fine
Sancha said she'd still be mine
By the end of year I was crying

Christmas 1979
Christmas 1979
Christmas 1979
Christmas 1979

We were playing punk in Hamburg
Bruce stayed out there with a German bird
I came home on Christmas Eve
I was on punk leave

Christmas 1979
Christmas 1979
Christmas 1979
Christmas 1979

My father walked in pissed through the door
And chucked the telly across the floor
Then he fell drunk to his bed
And these were the last words he ever said

Merry Fucking Christmas to you all!
Merry Fucking Christmas to you all!

Merry Fucking Christmas to you all!
Merry Fucking Christmas to you all!

Merry Fucking Christmas to you all!
Merry Fucking Christmas to you all!

Merry Fucking Christmas to you all!
Merry Fucking Christmas to you all!

Merry Fucking Christmas to you all!
Merry Fucking Christmas to you all!
