[Verse 1]
Lately, I've let myself go
I've been screening the calls
From my friends to my foes
Although I've been weak
Far for so very long

[Chorus]
I gotta get myself
I gotta get myself
I gotta get myself
Back to the ground

[Verse 2]
Sultry siren messed with my song
I'm gonna send her back
To where she belongs
I keep my enemies
Much, much, much too close

[Chorus]
I gotta get myself
I gotta get myself
I gotta get myself
Back to the ground

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
When you're attracted to the danger
And tasting every flavour
Then bring it on and bleed yourself dry
Reality is twisted
Your mind's getting shoplifted
Is there underneath an innocent guy? O

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
So clearly, I've let myself go
So does admission take my sins to a new low?
And when you're way down there
You'll find all those old friends you used to know
And they're gonna help ya
Get yourself back to the ground
