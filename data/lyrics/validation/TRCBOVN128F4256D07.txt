[Intro]
Get your dental floss ready
Get your toothbrush loaded
And ready for action!
Now peace to the streets
Peace to (Jan Dawes?)
I spit relief from beef police transporters
Like England supporters at an away game
Certain Spanish fans get duffed up in the mel'e
Way-hey! You need straightening out
A racist in braces
But you're tasteless
On this basis
Shut that hole where your cake is
Got raps on tap like where your toothpaste is
You need a breath mint
Your mum needs two
She melted every breathalizer she breathes through
People cross the road when they see you
You're no stunt man
Your breath's fuckin' evil
I feel faint
(Why?)
Your breath peels paint
That's why I asked you around to redecorate
Introduce your tooth to the brush and
Stop steaming up the windows on the bus

[Chorus - repeat x2]
It's the brush-off
It's the cut-off
A point for everything we've had enough of
It's the brush-off
You need to shove off
This for everyone we've had enough of
You're a Colgate smile away from 8 mile
Wait while you brush before you freestyle
I know a tooth fairy who's very poor
You supplied more ivory than she could afford
Even your teeth wonder where the fuck your gums are
It's like having a conversation with Mumra
Call a dentist
Call a priest
Your breath it
Tests belief
It ain't hard to smell
I excel
Gargle well
You get a wide berth like smurfs from Gargamel
It's getting nasty
(Party?) (Parsley?)
You wanna kick sixteen don't ask me
It's like E.T.,
When you're eating
Phoned your home and...
(It's been quarantined.)
In all honesty
Breath-wise mate
You're well past your warranty

[Chorus]
Beef with the elite
(Delish?) of Hampstead Heath
(Shush there) North and South
There's a taste of Bristol streets
Where you can choose to chew fat
Or spit it with the best of us
And moderately on all conservative estimates
You anoraks
Here's a byte for your Apple Macs
Forget bluetooth, yellow and plaque attacks
Snackin' on Caramacs I'm happy in a habitat
One love to Yoda and I'm ghost like Yasser Arafat
You're left bereft of breath control
Travellers evicted you from Glastonbury Festival
It's cause your tongue is hairier than your testicles
Forget a toothbrush
Call pest control!
Your breath's so sick
It sick stinks
Even when you lip-sync it stinks
When you begin to speak I squint and blink
You shower the listener like a squid spits ink

[Chorus]
