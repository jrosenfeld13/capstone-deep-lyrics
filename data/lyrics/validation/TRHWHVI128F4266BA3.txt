Lately i've been thinking
Lately i've been dreaming with you
I'm so resistent to this type of thinking
Oh now it's shining through

I was alone for the last time
Before my nights' vacation with you
Alive from the first now i'm denied
By the ghost of you

Oh you take yourself a photograph and laugh at me
Please

I know there's little use in crying
It's more wide awake and dying than i'm used to
I thought we'd walk these streets together
Now i'm hoping that I'll never have to meet you
Step aside from all this anger
And somewhere in between I can feel you
Ask me should we try again
I'm thinking no yeah
It's not what i believe in
It's not what i believe in

Oh, Won't you take yourself a photograph and laugh at me
Please
You make yourself a photograph and laugh at me
Please

No I, wanna taste your love
No I...no I
No I, just wanna taste your love
Oh, no I

Standing in your shoes I turn
And now you're standing bare in my doorway
I only wish that I had been prepared
I'm gonna have to go along with your way

Just take the plastic camera out
It's in the pants you borrowed in the driveway
Alive from the first now i'm denied by the ghost of you

Make yourself a photograph & laugh at me please
Yeah make yourself a photograph & laugh at me please
No i want a taste of love no i
I was alive from the first now i'm denied by the ghost of you
