Tom's the name that you know me by
And i'm 5'11, brown eyes
Otherwise i'm just like you
See i've made my mistakes like we all do

But i'm skybound, i don't look down
I've got too much to live for

And i've learnt how to play it
With one foot in front of the other
There's no way to win it
Just spin around and around

People walk with their heads down low
Too afraid to be more
People talk with their voices low
Too afraid to say more

But i'm skybound, no i don't look down
I've got too much to live for

And i've learnt how to play it
With one foot in front of the other
And there's no way to win it
We all just spin around and around

Learn how, learn how, learn how, learn how

You can learn how to play it
With one foot in front of the other
And there's no way to win it
We just spin around and around

Round and around, round and around
Round and around, round and around...
