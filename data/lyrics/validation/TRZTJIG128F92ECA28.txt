Why are there so many songs about rainbows
And what's on the other side?
Rainbows are visions but only illusions
Rainbows have nothing to hide
So we've been told and some choose to believe it
But I know they're wrong, wait and see
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me
Who said that every wish would be heard and answered
And wished on the morning star
Somebody thought of it and somebody believed in it
And look what it's done so far
What's so amazing that it keeps us star gazing
And what do they think we might see?
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me
All of us under it's spell
We know that it's probably magic
Have you been half asleep and have you heard voices?
I've heard them calling my name
Is this the sweet sound that calls the young sailors?
The voice might be one and the same
I've heard it too many times to ignore it
It's something I'm suppose to be
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me
