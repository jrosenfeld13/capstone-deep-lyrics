I don't care
If only I could say that and not feel so sick and scared
I don't care
If only I could say that
If only my eyes would close

Jesus brilliant, you used to laugh
Walking these gorgeous blocks
This top is the place where nobody goes
You just imagine
You just imagine it all

Every day I lie here and know that it's true
All I really want is you
Please come back
Please come back
Like all the other ones do

Jesus brilliant, you used to laugh
Walking these gorgeous blocks
This top is the place where nobody goes
You just imagine
Oh, you just imagine it all

Please come back
Please come back, all of you
Please come back
Please come back, all of you
