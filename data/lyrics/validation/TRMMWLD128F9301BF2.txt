[Chorus:]
If you really want it, come (bring it, bring it)
Step up 2 the plate and (bring it, bring it)
Only for the serious ones (bring it, bring it)
If you not ashamed then (bring it, bring it)
Ladies if you think you can hang (bring it, bring it)
Lace up gentlemen bringing it man to man
But you better make sure you can (bring it, bring it)
You better make sure you can (bring it, bring it)

[Verse 1:]
So you wanna battle?
I brought the war
So you calling me out
Well then let's even up the score
I been locked up in the woodshed
So you knowin' that I'm gully with it
Telling all you rooty poots bye bye
Not intimidated, homie, but nice try
Don't mean to be rude
But I think you jumped the gun
Cuz we're not the two
And baby I'm not the one
But I promise you baby
If you wanna have some fun
I can show you how to get it done
Lace up, face up, watch the beat go
Walla walla bing bang

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Who got the juice? (Not you, not you)
Who brought the crew? (Not you, not you)
Hachoo! Bless you! Better grab a tissue
On the charts, we're gonna miss you
And you can run your mouth if you wanna
You can talk that trash if you wanna
Telling all you rooty poots bye bye
Nope, I'm not intimidated, homie
But nice try... lace up!
Blazin' up the place (that would be me)
Picking up your face (Who? Us? We'll see)
But I know... one thing gimme 20 seconds in the ring
And the bell will go ding ding ding
Down in Chattanooga they be dancin' like what?
And out in California they be krumpin' like what?
East coast, what? Dirty south, what?
Chi town gets down 2 steppin' like what?

[Chorus]

I come to clap my hands
I come to do my dance
I came to rip it up

You don't really wanna battle me
You better bring an army, sho' nuff!
