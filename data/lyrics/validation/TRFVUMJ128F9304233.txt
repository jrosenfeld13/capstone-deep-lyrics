Hmm
Huh
She gotta know one thang
Huh
If I wasn't makin' big move, doin' big thing
Huh, huh
Would you leave with me not
Huh
I'm not
Huh, check this out
Yo, checked it

It was the back of the club in the V.I.P
From across the room you was eyeing me
I walked up to you with my big chain swinging
20 on the wrist pinky ring was bling blingin'
I told the bartender 2 hennys on the rocks
I seen you look over peep the face of my watch
I played it no mind I still gave you my number
But when I think about these things, it makes me wonder, baby

Would you leave me if I ain't had no dough (oh)
Would you leave me if bank accounts got low (mmmyeah)
Would you leave me if I wasn't balling no more
Benz repo'ed, I had to sell the condo (condo)
Would you leave me if I ain't had no dough
Would you leave me if bank accounts got low
(Would you leave, baby)
Would you leave me if I crash the ride
Lost my shine, I had to work a 9-5

Now time moved on and we got it going on
You got used to them things like the platinum rings
Trips on me to the Florida keys
Everything is fine, it's all lovely
Now everything is straight when I'm splitting the cake
But if plans change would I still be the man
Now I'm straight paid in the escalade
But if it all changed, would you leave

Would you leave me if I ain't had no dough (oh)
Would you leave me if bank accounts got low (tell me, babe)
Would you leave me if I wasn't balling no more (if I, if I)
Benz repo'ed, I had to sell the condo
Would you leave me if I ain't had no dough (mmm)
Would you leave me if bank accounts got low (baby, yeah, yeah)
Would you leave me if I crash the ride
Lost my shine (mmm) I had to work a 9-5

Watching my life go by except I ain't slipping on the dock of the bay
I'm out here negotiating for a sizeable pay
Time to make my money expand so my seeds can grow
I guess you figured your man wasn't bout to flow
(Figured your man wasn't bout to flow)
Let me explain this ain't no game they didn't want me to drop
And they say that my style is too similar to pop
I rock shows in the city but I blew up in the burbs
Catch the switching ladies erratic in my gold suburb (mmm, baby)
I keep my mind focused daily on the task at hand
Avoiding gold digging honey tryna mask my plan
They got me somewhat confused my attitude is raw
With a cold heart and blatant disregard for law, now peep it
I hope you see that this here talent is all I got
Would you leave me if I couldn't blow up the spot
I copped this drop and I'm ballin' for more
But tell me would you leave me if my dough got slow

Would you leave me if I ain't had no dough
Would you leave me if bank accounts got low (baby)
Would you leave me if I wasn't balling no more
(Gotta tell me, girl, gotta tell me, baby)
Benz repo'ed, I had to sell the condo
Would you leave me if I ain't had no dough (mmmoh, yeah, oh, yeah)
Would you leave me if bank accounts got low
Would you leave me if I crash the ride (tell me would you leave)
Lost my shine, I had to work a 9-5

Would you leave me if I ain't had no dough
Would you leave me if bank accounts got low
Would you leave me if I wasn't balling no more
(If planned changed, will I still be, will I still be the man)
Benz repo'ed, I had to sell the condo (tell me, baby)
Would you leave me if I ain't had no dough (tell me, lads)
Would you leave me if bank accounts got low
(If my bank accounts, wasn't no more)
Would you leave me if I crash the ride
Lost my shine, I had to work a 9-5
(Tell me would you leave, yeah, yeah)

Would you leave me if I ain't had no dough (baby)
Would you leave me if bank accounts got low
(Would you still be here)
Would you leave me if I wasn't balling no more (oh, oh)
Benz repo'ed, I had to sell the condo (baby)
Would you leave me if I ain't had no dough
(Baby, baby, baby, baby)
Would you leave me if bank accounts got low (baby, baby)
Would you leave me if I crash the ride (baby)
Lost my shine (oh) I had to work a 9-5 (oh)

No seat, no chicks
No whip, no ride
Would you still be here
Mmm, mmm
Tell me, you make me wonder
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Would you leave, mmm
