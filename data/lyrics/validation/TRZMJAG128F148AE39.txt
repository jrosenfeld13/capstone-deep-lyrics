I'm missing your face
I'm missing your face

[Chorus]
Missin you
Wishin too
To be kissin you
All the things that we use to do
And I can't be next to you

[Jerzee]
Have you ever lost a love one, ooh
And it can come so many ways
Murder, giving them up, or them simply running away
Sometimes the pain stays
But in your mind is a daze
And then your body's walkin a maze
But you're the only on encaged

[Chorus]
I would give my last breathe
If I knew it would make a difference
If I could turn back the hands of time
I would love you more and held you close
Sometimes the pain stays
But in your mind is a daze
Having you body walking in a maze
But you're the only on encaged

[Chorus]
[Breakdown]
I miss you
I wanna hold and kiss you
I'd give my last breathe if it would make a difference

[Repeat Chorus 2x]
