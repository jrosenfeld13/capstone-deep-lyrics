Yesterday, today and forever
You are the same
You and only you
Will never change
I'm talking about you
I'm talking about you

What would you do if they were to see you naked in the sun
What would you do if they were to see your soul on the run
Thinking is good, thinking is good

Don't let them change you
The moves you make, the chance that you take
Will determine the war you win
Don't let them change you
The books you read, the food you eat
Will make or break a man of you

How many specks have you pulled out of your neighbours eye today
I think you can't see, 'cause there's a piece of wood
Blocking your view

Try putting yourself into your brother's shoes, for a day
Loving the lovable is easy
We're giving to get, giving to get...

Don't let them change you
The moves you make, the chance that you take
Will determine the war you win
Don't let them change you
The books you read, the food you eat
Will make or break a man of you

Don't let them change you
The moves you make, the chance that you take
Will determine the war you win

Don't let them change you
The moves you make, the chance that you take
Will determine the war you win
Don't let them change you
The books you read, the food you eat
Will make or break a man of you

Don't let them change you
Change you
Don't let them change you
Change you
