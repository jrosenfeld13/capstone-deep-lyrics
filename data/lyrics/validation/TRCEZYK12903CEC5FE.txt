[Verse 1]
Moonlit girls hiding in the dunes
Stars are falling like rockets in ruins
I'm in the meadows where the roses bloom
The orange blossoms shaking loose
The lovers talking like lovers do
The summer's twilights had 'em fooled

[Chorus]
Yonder come
Yonder come
Yonder come the blues
Now clap your hands, baby, stomp your boots
Yonder come the blues

[Verse 2]
My feet are planted in the waist-high reeds
In the shadows, in the shade of trees
In the kingdom's smoky leaves
You'd be laughing too if you could see
On the outskirts long and lean
Not bearing gifts on a jet black steed

[Chorus]
Yonder come
Yonder come
Yonder come the blues
Ain't no rumor, it's simply true
Yonder come the blues

[Verse 3]
A dozen fingers and an easy touch
Throwing ashes in the pixie dust
I'm locked and loaded now off the bus
It's got us numbered, the two of us
Now sing that gospel and get your thrills
Raise the roof off and strike the bell
You'd be dancing too if you could tell
It's waking up and coming out of its shell

[Verse 4]
Down the boulevard sirens pass
Into the underworld deep and black
With brass and ladders, pick and axe
On down the stairwell through the blast
Now single file out, don't be last
Not every one of us is coming back

[Chorus]
Yonder come
Yonder come
Yonder come the blues
Now move on back and let them through
Yonder come the blues
