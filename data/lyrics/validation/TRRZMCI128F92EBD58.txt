What you sight you have seen
Where you go already been
Then again you go through
Occasion Avenue

Sister, the day you sell you skin
(The gold of night is the gold of the blind)
Sister, that day you soul gives in
(You'll never find what you left behind)
Oh, oh, no matter what they do
Oh, oh, you got to go straight through
Occasion Avenue

Brother, dare not look left or right
(Coaxing your eyes, poisoning your mind)
Brother, don't stop or you must fight
(No indulgence or its death you find)
Oh, oh, you may not leave with doubt
Oh, oh, you may not take it to
Occasion Avenue

Follow your heart  follow your truth
Follow the path that shines for you
On Occasion Avenue
How far you go  how good you do
Uncovers the prize or rebears you
To Occasion Avenue

Domini, domini - Occasion Avenue  domini sancti
Satani, satani - Occasion Avenue  satani mundi

Will there be tomorrow  will there be the stars
Will there be a future  time beats in our hearts
Or will there be the fire  branding us his mark

I pray for all us people
Trying to solve the riddle
I don't know where we're going
I don't know if we're being true

Precious is your taking
For a little bit of faking
For a tiny slight deception
For some insincere affection
(TV: ...sentenced to 16 years for marriage imposture and order of
Murder to his current wife
Whose life assurance's worth one million pounds.)

Much will be your power
By the essence of a flower
By seducement and cold rapture
By abusing mother nature
(TV: ...murdered close to old Berlin's Checkpoint Charlie
Police assumes just one more execution by completing drug-cartels)

Great will be your status
When you know how to lick anus
When you lie and swindle ruthless
And your biggest hero's Judas
He leaves no dependant so stay tuned for the latest news of
"Where do all the millions go")

Will there be tomorrow  will there be the stars
Will there be a future  time beats in our hearts
Will there still be laughter  will there be relief
Will there be religion  will there be belief

Will you see your people  from your former lives
Will you know them this time  will you win the prize
Will there be an ending  will there be a start
Or will there be the fire  branding you his mark

I pray for all us people
Trying to solve the riddle
I don't know where we're going
I don't know if we're being true

Mother, I dreamt of my last life
(You'll never find what you left behind)
Mother, I killed toy with my knife

Oh, oh, we got to make it through
Occasion Avenue

Follow your heart  follow your truth
Follow the path that shines for you
On Occasion Avenue
How far you go  how good you do
Uncovers the prize or rebears you
To Occasion Avenue
