[Verse 1]
Get up out of your chair
I've got some news to tell you
But you can't be sitting down, that ain't fair
I know that I love you but I know you don't care
So what can we do?
Sometimes it gets confusing
But there's just no way that I'm losing you
No matter what hoops you have to make me jump through

[Bridge]
And I'm sorry but it just felt alright
I have a tendency to hold on too tight
But tonight
If you say you don't love me, well then

[Chorus]
Leave me, oh leave me if you like
You keep on telling me that you just got to go
I think when the tempers are gone
You'll still be holding on
But if you say you don't love me
Then you leave me no other choice

[Verse 2]
I'm so easy to scare
Things are getting worse
And I really need to know you'll be there
Wherever you are just let me know where
So what will it take?
To turn back every clock
Freeze every second, and erase each mistake
Maybe all we need is a clean total break

[Chorus]
Oh so leave me, leave me if you can
But I know you need me so you won't move
I know you could leave me on any given night
But I got a feeling you ain't going anywhere soon
Night always fades into day
But some things don't go away
You can't leave me no matter how hard you try
