She got up tears tired on a clear crystal day
It was may day, worker's day, fire day
Fighter's day, red day, mayday, in the heyday
Back in days, the soviet parades
Standing side by side in the shade
Kissin' and cussin' and strivin' and tryin'
Fussin' and bumpin' and sticking
Hey Girl stop sleeping

Standing side by side in the shade
Kissin' and cussin' and strivin' and tryin'
Fussin'and bumpin' and sticking
Hey Girl quit crying

She has to swerve the system
Search the engine
Pull out the screw
The true screw, the real screw
The one that'll make it all come down
Standing side by side in the shade
Kissin' and cussin' and strivin' and tryin'
Fussin' and bumpin' and crying
Hey Girl, stop shaking

Standing side by side in the shade
Kissin' and cussin' and strivin' and tryin'
Fussin' and bumpin' and stickin'
Hey Girl, start something
