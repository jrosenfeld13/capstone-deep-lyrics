We've got a 747 coming down in the night
There's no power, there's no runway lights
Radio operator try to get a message through
Tell the flight deck New York has no lights
There's no power what do we do?
747 coming down in the night
Try to get a message through

We were strangers in the night (*)
Both on separate flights
Strangers in the night
Going nowhere

This is Scandinavian one-o-one
Flight from Hawaii coming out of the sun
Kennedy should be in sight
We can't see a thing here in the night
Navigator says we're on the flight path
There's no radio, no sign of life
This is Scandinavian one-o-one
For God's sake, get the ground lights on, because

(Repeat *)

There's a 747 going into the night
There's no power, they don't know why
They've no fuel, they've got to land soon
They can't land by the light of the moon
They're overshooting, there's no guiding lights
Set a course into the light
Scandinavian one-o-one
For God's sake get your ground lights on

(Repeat *)
