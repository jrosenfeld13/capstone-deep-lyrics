Baby won't you please come home?
'Cause your daddy's all alone
I have tried in vain
Never no more to call your name

When you left you broke my heart
Because I never thought we'd part
Every hour in the day you will hear me say
"Baby come home"

Baby won't you please come home?
Because your daddy's so alone
I have tried in vain
Never no more to ever call your name

When you left you broke my heart
Because I never thought we'd part
Every hour in the day you will hear me say
"Baby come on home", daddy needs baby
Baby won't you please come home?
