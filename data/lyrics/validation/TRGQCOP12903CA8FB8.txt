Hey kids
Prung tangs here
Oh yeah

She's all damn rich
Knows where to scratch me when i itch
She's an wrinkled old bitch
She sucks the chrome right off my trailer hitch

Prune tang (x2)

?
You find out quick there's no other way
?
She's always open and ready to rock

My my my my prune tang

My my my prune tang (x3)

Miles and miles of duct tape
Couldn't match up my day
Nothing in this world but sweet prune tang
Could ever make me feel this way

My my my my my my my my
Prune tang on my mind
My my my my my my my my
Prune tang all the time

My my my my prune tang
My my my prune tang

Prune tang (x5)
