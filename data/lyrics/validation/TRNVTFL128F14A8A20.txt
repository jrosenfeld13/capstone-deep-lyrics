Price / Peverett - Knee Trembler Music - ASCAP

I used to be a dreamer, I can't be that way no more
I used to be a dreamer, I can't be that way no more
Only time has proved me wrong
You can't live on love alone when reality is far too strong

Nightmare walkin', creepin' through the lonely nights
Nightmare walkin', creepin' through the lonely nights
I wake up with the rising sun
Try to work away the days, keep my troubles on the run
Nowhere to hide, nightmare ruin my life

I wake up from my sleep, I got nightmares on my mind
Walk around in circles to pass away the time
I hear the bell tonin' and I see the mornin' light
Pour myself a drink, but I lost my appetite
I can't sleep at all, 'cause my dreams are all so bad
When I get to thinkin' it's about to drive me mad
See our love dyin' and my eyes begin to burn
My mind is so confused, I don't know which way to turn

Wake up with the rising sun
Try to work away the days, keep my troubles on the run
Nowhere to hide, nightmare ruin my life

{Rod - Solo}

Time at last has proved you right
Now my dreams are turnin' bad, it's the same thing every night
Nowhere to hide, nightmare ruin my life

{Instrumental}

Nightmare, ruin my life, yeah
Nightmare, ruin my life
Every hour, whoa, every night
Hear the bell tonin', hear the bell tonin'
Nightmare, yeah, whoa, nightmare, drive me crazy
Nightmare, yeah, nightmare, drive me out of my mind
