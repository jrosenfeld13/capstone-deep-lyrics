That's a good question
Why am I standing out here alone?
I guess I don't know enough
To come in from the rain
I was watching your window
From here below
I think I just might stay
Here all day
'Cause I gotta do something

'Cause If I can't love you
I don't want to love you
If I can't hold you
I don't want to be thinking of you
And if you don't want me
I don't want to want you
And if you won't see me
I don't know what to do
But oh... keep watching you
Oh... I keep watching you
Until I see right through
Oh... I keep watching you

You could throw me down a cigarette
I smoked my last one quite a while ago
No, I gave it to the man
That swore he had no need
You know sometimes if I listen real close
I can hear the dark side of the moon
And there's always yesterday's Times
If I care to read
And I gotta do something

'Cause If I can't love you
I don't want to love you
If I can't hold you
I don't want to be thinking of you
And if you don't want me
I don't want to want you
And if you won't see me
I don't know what to do
But oh... keep watching you
Oh... I keep watching you
Until I see right through
Oh... I keep watching you

Sure I'm alright
No, I'm not very cold
You see, every now and then
I can feel the subway heat
So go on inside
I'll leave you alone
Anyway, Bogart's on in the window
Down the street
And I gotta do something

'Cause If I can't love you
I don't want to love you
If I can't hold you
I don't want to be thinking of you
And if you don't want me
I don't want to want you
And if you won't see me
I don't know what to do
But oh... keep watching you
Oh... I keep watching you
Until I see right through
Oh... I keep watching you
I keep watching you
You
You
