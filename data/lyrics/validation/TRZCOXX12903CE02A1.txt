Lucille
You don't do your daddy's will
Lucille
You don't do your daddy's will
There's ain't nothing to you
But I love you still

Lucille
Please come back where you belong
Lucille
Please come back where you belong
I've been good to you baby
Please don't leave me alone

I woke up this morning
Lucille was not in sight
Asked my friends about her
All their lips were tight

Lucille
Please come back where you belong
I've been good to you baby
Please don't leave me alone

Ooohhhhhh

Lucille
You don't do your daddy's will
Lucille
You don't do your daddy's will
There ain't nothing to you
But I love you still

Ooohhhhhh
