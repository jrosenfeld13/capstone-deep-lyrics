Listen to the wind
If you listen carefully
You will hear soft notes
Listen with your mind
Listen with your heart
You will hear a Heartsong
A soft relaxing song
That reminds... you of

CHORUS
Peace and Harmony
Harmony and love
Peace and harmoney and love

If you hear this song
Always remember it
For if you do
You can teach it
To other people too
And they will forever
Forever they'll remember
Their Heartsongs...

CHORUS
Peace and Harmony
Harmony and love
Peace and harmoney and love

Listen to the wind
If you listen carefully
You will hear soft notes
Listen with your mind
Listen with your heart
You will hear a Heartsong
A soft relaxing song of the wind
