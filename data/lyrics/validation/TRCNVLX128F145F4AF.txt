Where does it say
All the love that we made must disappear
And who made the rule
That the one who is cruel won't cry the tears
Well we woke up unsatisfied
Got out of bed and said goodbye
But don't leave me here dyeing on the cross of love
Don't leave me here dyeing on the cross of love
I got down on my knees and prayed to the lord above
Don't leave me now don't you realize
You can't make out of love a sacrifice
Don't leave me here dyeing on the cross of love
Who pays the cost
If the love that is lost goes unredeemed

And why should I care
If this cross that I bare is destiny
My heart was pure my love was strong
Forgive me if I've done you wrong
But don't leave me here dyeing on the cross of love
Don't leave me here dyeing on the cross of love
I got down on my knees and prayed to the lord above
Don't leave me now don't you realize
You can't make out of love a sacrifice
Don't leave me here dyeing on the cross of love

Where does it say
All the love that we made, must disappear
