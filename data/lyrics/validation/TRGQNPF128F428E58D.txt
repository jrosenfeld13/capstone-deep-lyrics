I tried to be someone
Feelings that I left behind
Tried to take it
Before you're mine
Now we must go
Can't be someone else
Lost in nothing
This time we lose it all

Now- I tried to be someone
I fucking hate you - Feelings that I left Behind
You - Tried to take it
Said you loved me- Before you're mine

Hell - Now we must go
Freezes over - Can't be someone else
The sun - Lost in nothing
Goes supernova - This time we lose it all

Now we must go
Can't be someone else
Lost in nothing
This time we lose it all
