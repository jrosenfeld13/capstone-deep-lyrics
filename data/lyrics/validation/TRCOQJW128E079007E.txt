[Verse 1]
I need you
Simple words
But words which had never been heard
By the soul
Stoned to death
But still living

[Chorus 1]
And so he froze where he stood
And he looked to the ground
And he cried
He cried

[Verse 2]
Ride our minds
If you must
But there's always a line you don't cross
Time is short
Don't be cruel
Oh, you don't know the power
In what you're saying
Oh, ohoh

[Chorus 1]
And so he froze where he stood
And he looked to the ground
And he cried
He cried

[Verse 3]
People where
I come from
They survive without feelings or blood
I never could
Was stoned to death
But I'm still living

[Chorus 1]
So he froze where he stood
And he looked to the ground
And he cried
He cried

[Chorus 2]
So he froze
And he looked, and he looked
To the ground
And he cried
He cried
