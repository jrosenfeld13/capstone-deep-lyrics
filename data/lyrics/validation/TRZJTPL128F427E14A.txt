Jeffrey ran away
Last seen with that boy around the corner
Hands upon his waist
Shaking too much 'fore he's dead he's on her
Jeffrey was a tired boy
Too much yelling going on to sleep
So they had it once on his list
Never knew the cut would be so deep
(where did you go?)
Where did you go?
(where did you go?)
Where did you go?

Face I've never seen
Shove in my flesh and my bone-oh my bones
Something moves in me
I can only hope your not alone
Twenty winters gone now
Plently more to come
Where we do, so I call you home, lift my voice
And pray that it will find you

(where did you go?)
Where did you go?
(where did you go?)
Where did you go?

Somewhere inside back of your mind
See can you find

(where did you go?)
Where did you go?
(where did you go?)
Where did you go?
