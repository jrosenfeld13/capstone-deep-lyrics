You don't have to be alone to feel alone
You can have someone and still feel alone

Everything that ever was will never be again
We're only lonely people now wondering where we've been
Rarely does it take you more than once or twice to learn
That love is so much deeper when you let the fever burn

And there's a strong possibility
That we might often fail to see the better side of life

Frozen dreams of lighter things is all we have to share
Loneliness will capture you in moments of despair
Noble things and silver rings all locked up in a drawer
The key remains inside yourself and will forever more

And there's a strong possibility
That we might often fail to see the better side of life

You don't have to be alone to feel alone
You can have someone and still feel alone

Everything that ever was will never be again
We're only lonely people now wondering where we've been
Rarely does it take you more than once or twice to learn
That love is so much deeper when you let the fever burn

And there's a strong possibility
That we might often fail to see the better side of life

You don't have to be alone to feel alone
You can have someone and still feel alone
