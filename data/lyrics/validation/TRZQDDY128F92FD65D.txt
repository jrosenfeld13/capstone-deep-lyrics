Now me and my wife went to town
(Sail away lady, sail away)
We went to buy a ten dolar gown
(Sail away lady, sail away)

[Chorus]
Oh, don't you rock me daddy-o
Well, don't you rock me daddy-o
Don't you rock me daddy-o
Well, don't you rock me daddy-o
Oh, don't you rock me daddy-o
Well, don't you rock me daddy-o
Don't you rock me daddy-o
Now, don't you rock me daddy-o
She tried the green, she tried the red
(Sail away lady, sail away)
I'll have 'em both that's what she said
(Sail away lady, sail away)
Well, she put one on and then looked a treat
(Sail away lady, sail away)
Then found another man to meet
(Sail away lady, sail away)
Now mister leave my girl alone
(Sail away lady, sail away)
Well, she gets what she wants at home
(Sail away lady, sail away)
I'm going upstairs to pack my trunk
(Sail away lady, sail away)
Gonna find a bar and get me drunk
(Sail away lady, sail away)
