You talk, you talk a good game
Wish I could talk the same
A song is just a game I'm getting good at cheating at

You talk, yes you talk a good game
Won't you teach me the same
Oh I'd love to explain, like showing your hand and all about
Oh well I know, I know, I know, I know and so and so and so

So what I suppose it's got to

Oh well I never ever said it was clever
I just like getting leathered
Looking for the light, the light behind your eyes

You talk, you talk a good game
Wish I could talk the same
A song is just a game I'm getting good at cheating at

Utah, remember Utah in the rain
And those little red shoes and some kid with the blues
Who gets right on your tits, you just grin and bear it

Oh well I know, I know, I know, I know it's wrong and so and so and so
So what I suppose it's got to

Oh well I never said it was clever
I just like getting leathered
Looking for the light the light behind your eyes

Bevan, he drops stones from heaven L O R D for ever
And the love, the love behind your eyes

You talk, you talk a good game
You talk, you talk a good game
You talk, you talk a good game
You talk, you talk a good game

Wll I never. ever said it was clever
I just like getting leathered looking for the light
Behind your eyes

Bevan, he drops stones from heaven L O R D for ever
And the love behind your eyes
