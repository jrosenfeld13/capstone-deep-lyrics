(Hey, hey) what's your name, what's your name, what's your name, sir?
(Hey, hey) what's your name, what's your name, what's your name, sir?
It's three o'clock and I'm lookin', lookin' at my watch, tick tick tick tock tock tock tock
Starin' at the ceilin', ceilin', you know what I'm feelin', feelin'
We wouldn't be sitting here, we'd be steppin' out somewhere
Heels high, head back, my nails painted black

Woah i dont know why, i dont wanna dance
Just put up my hand

Hands to the sky
Cause i can, i dont wanna dance
Just put up my hands
Ok ok alright

I dont care what they say bout me there not the ones im trying to please

Hey hey, whats your name, whats your name sir, hey hey
