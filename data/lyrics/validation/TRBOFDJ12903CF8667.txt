So where did you go today?
I found a little lie behind your eyes
What do you want today?
I dream a little bit of what you want to say
How would you say, what you can't say
Maybe I'll go out tonight
Just a little bit until I get a sign
Let's go out tonight
And wash away the lies until we see what's right
Maybe tonight, just one more night
Maybe tonight
Why don't you return to me?
Take a living in what you see
Everyday you're too far from me
Until that I keep living the dream
I keep living the dream
So where are you from today?
Take a little look inside your life
How do you pay?
Leave that I can bring the bride of you someday
What do you say?
What will you say?
What do say?
Why don't you return to me?
Take a living in what you see
Everyday you're too far from me
Until that I keep living the dream
Until that I keep living the dream
Let's go out tonight
What do you say?
Where are you from today?
Until this
So what do you chose?
What up in the end of nothing left to lose
Just let me through
When it comes to trust it never comes too soon
'Cause this is for you, only for you
This is for you
Why don't you return to me?
Take a living in what you see
Everyday you're too far from me
Until that I keep living the dream
I keep living the dream
Let's go out tonight
Living the dream
Just living the dream
Just living the dream
