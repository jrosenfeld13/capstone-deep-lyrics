Champagne bubble up
Take your girl then I trouble her
And Then I ring a ding ding ding on the nokia
And Then I take her back and I batter her

I said Champagne bubblin'
Holding the mic like a javelin'
Lyrically i'm time travellin'
And pure mc's are bafflin'

Because I'm ravin' to the best bass
And i dont know when ill be back again
I just know that i fuck with the track again
I just know that im gonna make a fool out (of)
I'm ravin' to the best bass
And i dont know when ill be back again
I just know that im... gonna make a fool out (x3)

Stop Stop let me begin
DJ Beats and it ain't no...
Stop Stop let me begin

Stop Stop let me begin
DJ Beats and it ain't no sin
Stop Stop let me begin
He's crazy, so section him!
