If you pick up the pieces
Ill put them together
Only time can be the glue
Only time
Will let them dry

Only you
And me inside my head
Time and time again
These talks turn to stone
These talks turn to stone

And when they dry
We will be ready
Only time
Can keep your heart steady
On beat
On beat

Weve been searching the sky for answers
I look to the stars so that I feel small
And my problems dont seem so big
