[Chorus]
Every reason why
Every reason why

Theres an all seeing eye
That watches the soul die?
An a armnition? brain
Knowing every reason why
Woo woo ooo oo yayy yayy


Shall we focus on the spiritul or pyramids
While we sang

[Verse 1 Myka 9]
Think it ain't michael global top rank
Shake a sucker side step, bang?
Leave em swimming in red paint
Rank backfired
Walk a fellowship plank
Fallin, sinkin in my think tank
Yanky livin skanky little trollop pack a wallop
Make a nigga gallop after they kick game?
Ski gang?
Somebody follow
He wear a wire exposed
Under re-corse? cloths
But he was on the crank
Sometimes he would nod of an think
Memorabillia came up a blank
When he would blame it on the
Dank he was smoking
And the drank he was drinking
We all new it was the coke?
Inside the vessel that sank
No boat hanky panky
No boat booty spank
Well spoke an complex
Coming from within the angst
Do you something horrible
What i consider quaint
Can't buy me, not affordable
I boogie no complaint
Explore-able pure to be on the ones that taint
With delusions of grandeur
Hells gonn' get ya'
Skin grinding with these dancers
It only cost a penny
To make a benny
Frank
Now you know the answer
Now you know the answer, ho

Every reason why

Theres an all seeing eye
That watches the soul die?
An a armnition? brain
Knowing every reason why
When you reap a lie
Live a farce
Drink and drive
Jacking cars
Mac in' stars
Who think they live


Every reason why

Theres an all seeing eye
That watches the soul die?
An a armnition? brain
Knowing every reason why
When you reap a lie
Live a farce
Drink and drive
Jacking cars
Mac in' stars
Who think they live

Men and women
Who take advatage of each other
Hogs? in a family situation
The damage is done
Goodbye
But in that same universal vision apply
The mental focus changes
From dispise to respect on the rise

Every reason why

Every reason
