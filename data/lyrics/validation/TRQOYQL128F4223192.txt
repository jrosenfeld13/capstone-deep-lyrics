[Intro]
In a crooked little town they were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground

[Verse 1]
I hitched a ride until the coast
To leave behind all of my ghosts
Searching for something I couldnt find at home
Cant get no job, can you spare a dime?
Just one more hit and Ill be fine
I swear to God, thisll be my one last time!

[Chorus]
In a crooked little town they were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground
Run away before you drown, or the streets will beat you down
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground

[Verse 2]
When it gets dark in Pigeon Park
Voice in my head will soon be fed
By the vultures, that circle round the dead!

[Chorus]
In a crooked little town they were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground
Run away before you drown, or the streets will beat you down
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground

[Bridge]
I never once thought Id ever be caught!
Staring at sidewalks, hiding my track marks!
I left my best friends or did they just leave me?

[Chorus]
In a crooked little town they were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground
Run away before you drown, or the streets will beat you down
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground
