[Chorus: Joe Bouchard]
Screams in the night
Sirens delight
Heat, broken glass
Satan's bred trash

[Post-Chorus: Joe Bouchard]
Big city madness, comfort my soul
Give me a home where I can grow

[Verse 1: Joe Bouchard]
String of bright lights running up to the sky
Throughout the hot night, the cars racing by
You know they all see, but most of them pass
She drives by my wares, don't hide in your glass wheel

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus: Joe Bouchard]
Screams in the night
Sirens delight
Heat, broken glass
Satan's bred trash

[Post-Chorus: Joe Bouchard]
Big city madness, comfort my soul
Give me a home where I can grow

[Verse 2: Joe Bouchard]
Sounds of guitars fill up the night
Can't make me feel, I said its alright
In one hotel bed, you think you can grow
If you find a home, please let me know

[Drum Solo that leads to "She's as Beautiful as a Foot"]
