Darkness, creepin' thru the leaves
Jungle fever, got a hold on me
Want somebody tell me
Where can my baby be?
I'm gonna climb me a tree
Where I can see
Where my baby done gone
Then, I'll look up in the sky
With tears in my eyes
And tell my baby good-bye
The lion and the leopard
Creepin' thru the grass
The lion and the leopard
Creepin' thru the grass
Only Lord above
Know how long these hunts gonna last
I'm gonna climb me a tree
Where I can see
Where my baby done gone
Then, I'll look up in the sky
With tears in my eyes
And tell my baby good-bye
