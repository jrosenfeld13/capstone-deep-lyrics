In matching blue raincoats our shoes were our show boats we kicked around
From stairway to station we made a sensation with the gadabout crowd
And oh, what a bargain we're two easy targets for the old men at the off-tracks
Who've paid in palaver and crumpled old dollars which we squirreled away In our rat trap hotel by the freeway
And we slept-in Sundays

Your parents were anxious your cool was contagious at the old school
You left without leaving a note for your grieving sweet mother while Your brother was so cruel
And here in the alleys your spirits were rallied as you learned quick to make a fast buck
In bathrooms and barrooms on dumpsters and heirlooms we bit our tongues, sucked our lips into our lungs till we were falling
Such was our calling

And here in our hovel we fuse like a family
But I will not mourn for you
So take off your makeup and pocket your pills away
We're kings among runaways on the bus mall
We're down on the bus mall

Among all the urchins and old Chinese merchants of the old town
We reigned at the pool hall with one iron cue ball and we never let the bastards get us down
And we laughed off the quick tricks the old men with limp dicks on the colonnades of the waterfront park
As 4 in the morning came on, cold and boring, we huddled close In the bus stop enclosure enfolding
Our hands tightly holding

And here in our hovel we fuse like a family
But I will not mourn for you
So take off your makeup and pocket your pills away
We're kings among runaways on the bus mall
We're down On the bus mall, we're down on the bus mall
Down on the bus mall, oh oh
