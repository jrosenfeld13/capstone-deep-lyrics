Love to play my Rock'n'Roll but I've played the blues before
I've had my share of broken hearts I don't play the blues no more
If you meet the girl of your wildest dreams she's gonna turn out to be a curse
Love will hit you bad boy, but the blues will hit you worse

If you wanna know how to play the blues
Get yourself a woman
If you wanna know how to play the blues
Get yourself a woman

Muddy Waters sang out the truth back in 1941
Woman gonna get to you like Jimi Hendrix with a gun
Mr. Fred McDowell lost his pride when he begged his girl to stay
Mr. Robert Johnson lost his life with too much love one day

If you wanna know how to play the blues
Get yourself a woman, yeah
If you wanna know how to play the blues
Get yourself a woman

Yeah

Love to play my Rock'n'Roll but I've played the blues before
I've had my share of broken heart but I don't play the blues no more, o o
If you meet the girl of your wildest dreams she's gonna turn out to be a curse
Love will hit you bad boy, but the blues will hit you worse

If you wanna know how to play the blues
Get yourself a woman
If you wanna know how to play the blues
Then get yourself a woman

Pick it sweet, slide it slow, wow
