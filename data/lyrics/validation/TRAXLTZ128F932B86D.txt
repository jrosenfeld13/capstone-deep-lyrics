[Intro: will.i.am]
Ladies, la-la-ladies, la-la-ladies, here we go

[Hook: will.i.am/Kat Graham] x2
Baby, where'd you get your body from, tell me where'd you get your body from
Baby, where'd you get your body from, tell me where'd you get your body from
(I got it from my mama, I got it from my mama)
(I got it from my mama, I got it, got it, got-got it...)

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
Honey lookin' good from her head to her toe
Beauty overload, body out of control
She twenty-four, she could be a model
So beautiful, also natural
Mami lookin good from her head to her feet
She forty-four but she still lookin' sweet
And you can tell her daughter ain't even at her peak
'Cause her mama lookin' so hot packin' that heat
So be a good girl and thank your mama
She had you steamin' like a sauna
Look at her, look at her, here she come now
Look at her, look at her, here she come

[Hook: will.i.am/Kat Graham] x2
Baby, where'd you get your body from, tell me where'd you get your body from
Baby, where'd you get your body from, tell me where'd you get your body from
(I got it from my mama, I got it from my mama)
(I got it from my mama, I got it, got it, got-got it...)

[Verse 2: will.i.am]
Girl, your beauty is a sensation
You send men into temptation
I never knew a girl could shine like a sun
You better thank your mama 'cause girl you the one
We should have a day of celebration
Celebratin' God's best creation
Girl, you got a beautiful vibration
Every day should be your birthday, hun'
You make the guys all dumb
Maybe 'cause you're blessed with the beautiful buns
Maybe 'cause your beauty keep the dues on sprung
Wonderin' just where you got that from, from, from...

[Hook: will.i.am/Kat Graham]
Baby, where'd you get your body from, tell me where'd you get your body from
Baby, where'd you get your body from, tell me where'd you get your body from
(I got it from my mama, I got it from my mama)
(I got it from my mama, I got it, got it, got-got it...)
Baby, where'd you get your body from, tell me where'd you get your body from
Baby, where'd you get your body from, tell me where'd you get your body from
All of this right here, I got all this from my mama
All of this stuff right here, I got all this from my mama

[Break: will.i.am]
Ladies, la-la-ladies, la-la-ladies, here we go

[Bridge: will.i.am]
If the girl real fine, 9 times out of 10
She fine just like her mama
And if the girl real pretty, 9 times out of 10
She pretty like her mama
And if her mama real ugly, I guarantee
She gon' be ugly like her mama
And if her mama real ugly, I guarantee
She gon' be ugly like her mama
And if the girl real sexy, 9 times out of 10
She sexy like her mama
And if the girl real hot, 9 times out of 10
She hot just like her mama
And if her mama real ugly, I guarantee
She gon' be ugly like her mama
And if her mama real ugly, I guarantee
She gon' be ugly like her mama, like her mama

Baby, where'd you get your body from, tell me where'd you get your body from
Baby, where'd you get your body from, tell me where'd you get your body from
All of this right here, I got all this from my mama
All of this stuff right here, I got all this from my mama

[Outro: will.i.am]
If you pretty make some noise
If you pretty make some noise
If you pretty make some noise
Make some noise, make some noise
