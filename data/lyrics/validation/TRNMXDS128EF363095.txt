He was a little bit Emo, he loved his sweaters and his Thursday too
While she was talking about Ian, he was dreaming of Brand New
She was a little bit hardcore, wore a Bane shirt and had an edge tattoo
While he sang Taking Back Sunday, she was moshing with her crew

She showed him times gone by, he showed her how to cry
They both thought Chris Carrabba was the world's cutest guy
He sang her songs all day, she loved him anyway
They lived in different worlds, but hey that's ok

He didn't get the connection, seen a few shows that was all he knew
And so she played him the classics, and now he loves hardcore too
That day they finally realized, both their scenes are one big family
And if it wasn't for hardcore, then Emo would never be

Sometimes she'd play him music while they'd lie together in the dark
He finally heard old Fugazi, he said, "this sounds like bear vs. shark"
(oh, no!) We're not the first, I know we're not the last
The kids will always take the rock away, c'mon, ;let's start today
