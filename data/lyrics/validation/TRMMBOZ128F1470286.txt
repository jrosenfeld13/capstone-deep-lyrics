Waking up, it's been too long
Feel the warmth of the sun
On my face, tell my face
Where I've been going wrong
This road goes on and on
Sunset coming on
Sunset coming on
Oh Lord
But the sunrise we'll see
But the sunrise we'll see again
Sunset coming on
Sunset coming on
Oh Lord
But the sunrise we'll see
But the sunrise we'll see again
But the sunrise we'll see
But the sunrise we'll see again
But the sunrise we'll see
But the sunrise we'll see again
