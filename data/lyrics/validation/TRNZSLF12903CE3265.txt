When the dust settled everything was in doubt
You didn't know where to turn
You were still off balance
Your mind wanders back in time
A thousand drinks ago
And you're an optimist
It's a bit hazy now
So many plot twists
So you try and try to forget
But the circuits have been etched
The connections are fresh
The contacts mesh
Each night
Raked over the coals
She called from a payphone
The voice on the tape didn't match his face
A sympathetic ear

So many plot twists
So you try and try to forget
But the circuits have been etched
The connections are fresh
The contacts mesh
And you're an optimist
You were an optimist
