The truly weak spread venom
The truly strong digest it

Rotting from the inside
This agonized form resembles a man
Scorn burst from the heart
Rancor cracking ribs
Coating it's recesses in toxins

Base loathing within the loins seeps malice through it's pores
Ashing tissues
Blackened with contempt
Pestilent
Corrosive to the touch
A blight on humanity

Never must it speak
Never must it bleed
It mustn't even breathe

Rather than arming the mind with awareness
It wracks it's gut with spite
Damnable abomination
A conscious contagion
Infecting mankind

Trails of acid trill from addled sockets where tears and vision
Had once soothed and stirred the mind
A mortal ulcer
Agent of progressive atrophy
Abetting and defining social regression

Bile from it's gaping maw
Spitting vain and groundless vengeance
Hate-spawn
Bearer of all discord

Condone it's actions or deny it's impact and justify the unjustifiable

Rather than embracing the heart with balance and serenity
It wracks it's gut with spite
Damnable abomination
A conscious contagion onm humankind

See it quarantined and torched
Lest every man, woman, and child die
Defiled by a mass spread of venom
