Like an island's sunshine I'm showered
Today is going to be an extra off day
Like an island's sunshine I'm showered
Somehow feel like being lazy today
Get a beer,I think I need some cheer me up
Make a toast to the fluffy clouds in this sky
Low cure stressed out
Ringing bell crumble snatching my time
Time to get busy but I won't keep it up
Then tomorrow comes up some like this again!
It makes me dizzy my head swims in the air
