Ooh, you caught my heart tonight
Don't throw it away baby
Ooh, you caught my heart tonight
Don't throw it away baby

Weekends gone to bed
Monday blues about to begin
It's been a long haol
My body's tired
Wake me when the loneliness ends
Telephone screams
Baby pick me up
There you are with promises of love
Temptation begs
And ooh I surrender
And now you know
I can't get enough

Takes so long
To find trust
Hiding in the shadows
Of earth
You say it's alright
To believe
Cause you care about my love
Too much
On my own
There's no complications
But two can tear it to the ground
Love's a fool
It turns of desperation
Don't take advantage of me
When I'm down
