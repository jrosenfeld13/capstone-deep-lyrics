You want me to bring you home the bacon Fry it up and serve it to you too
When I don't you act so god forsaken
Like somehow I've been mistreating you
I know thats the way your mama did it
She waited on you dang near all your life
It took awhile but now I finally get it
You were never looking for a wife
If you want a mother I can be one
That ain't all that difficult for me
We can do it your way from now on son
And I'll show you what a mother I can be
Remember Tuesday night when your out bowling
You better have your butt back home by 9
Other wise your grounded for the weekend
And that brand new Silverado will be mine

In the evening when your feeling sleepy
Well Ill tuck you in and pat you on your head
And Ill be right down the hall if you should need me
Big boys have to sleep in their own bed
If you want a mother I can be one
That ain't all that difficult for me
We can do it your way from now on son
And ill show you what a mother I can be
(instrumental break)
If you want a mother I can be one
That ain't all that difficult for me
We can do it your way from now on son
And Ill show you what a mother I can be
You can go on back to your mother's apron strand
Your mom can be a mother just like me
