Mistaken identity
You really got this one wrong
Racially singled out
He must have a gun

And yet you get off with no time

How can this be the answer?
No crime, yet they shot away
He now lies dead; the blood is on your hands
Hands, which were supposed to protect
People like the man you blew away
This isn't justice; this is corruption

The four protectors fired 41 shots
Hitting him 19 times
Searching the body, there were no weapons found
He lies with all who died in vain

Murder must still be a crime
When our inherent freedom
Is hatefully gunned down
By who we entrust

And yet you get off with no time

Contempt breeds contamination
