She's liquid, she's burnin, hey
She is fire, she's drippin, hey
She's fakin' my reality
When she moves through blakk and white
She's tiny, no, she's 10-feet tall
She's ugly, no, she's a porcelain doll
She's stukk up, no she looks at me
As far as I can see

Down, down, down
Don't follow me around, round, round
I'm waiting for the kisses of the strobelight
Don't go, cause it's gonna be quite a ride
Please just kiss me one more time
It's all I ever wanted
Don't you let me sleep alone tonight

I see her, she's invisible
She's sweet, but she looks miserable
She's gracious, fascinating
Like I am hallucinatin'
She's dirty, she's squeaky clean
So friendly, but she's so mean
She's a saint
She's a sinner, hey
As far as I can see

Down, down, down
Don't follow me around, round, round
I'm waiting for the kisses of the strobelight
Don't go, cause it's gonna be quite a ride
Please just kiss me one more time
It's all I ever wanted
Don't you let me sleep alone tonight
Please dismiss me if I'm lyin'
You're all I ever wanted
Don't you make me sleep alone tonight

She runs, crawls
Old, young
Moves, stands still
Dirty, clean
Easy, complicated
Blakk, white
Sweet, bitter
Devil, goddess
Silence
Don't go, cause it's gonna be quite a ride

Please just kiss me one more time
It's all I ever wanted
Don't you let me sleep alone tonight
