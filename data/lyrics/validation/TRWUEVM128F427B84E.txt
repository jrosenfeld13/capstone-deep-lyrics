Our friends all think I am a gentle man
By the clothes that I wear, the things I say
But when I hold you in my arms
There's a feeling you set free
You bring out the wild side of me

I thought I knew what love was all about
And I made all the moves so carefully
When I'm with you, I do some things
I never thought I'd do or see
'Cause you bring out the wild side of me

No one's there to notice
When the change comes over me
When I kiss your sweet lips
And hold you tenderly
No one sees the stranger
That this simple man can be
When you bring out the wild side of me

You always seem to know what's on my mind
And you're everything I'll ever need
And when that love light's in your eyes
There's no place I'd rather be
'Cause you bring out the wild side of me

No one's there to notice
When the change comes over me
When I kiss your sweet lips
And hold you tenderly
No one sees the stranger
That this simple man can be
When you bring out the wild side of me
