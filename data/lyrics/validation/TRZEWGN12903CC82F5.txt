Lay in cover, my sea of spring
Drowning in the light
She moved like a dream
I was inside
To my singing came a harmony
Caught me by surprise
I never heard so right
She moved like a dream
I was inside
She's got a hold on me
She's got a hold on me
And I don't mind
Sunshine rising, laughter starts to ring
A face that's just as bright
She never showed somebody
She moved like a dream
I was inside
She's got a hold on me
She's got a hold on me
And I don't mind
I don't mind
