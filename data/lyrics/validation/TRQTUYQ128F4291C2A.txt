The love song
Unmistakable you
This love song
Unforgettable you

A song
With its own memory
Of you, of only you
Binding two to one
An invisible thread
That loops around the moon
And back to earth

You answered my m'aidez call
You caught me right before the fall
When I had less than nothing
You gave me all
You're my lover
Answering my m'aidez call

The love song
Language of devotion
A song
Telling tales upon the heart
Tales of two apart
This melody
Like a band aid
Since we lay together
We're harmony entwined
Since we lay together
We're harmony entwined

Because you answered my m'aidez call
Because you caught me
Right before my fall
When i had less than nothing
You gave me all
You're my lover
Answering my m'aidez call
My m'aidez call

A love song is a m'aidez call
Mainlined from my soul
Mainlined from my soul
A love song is a m'aidez call
Mainlined from our soul
