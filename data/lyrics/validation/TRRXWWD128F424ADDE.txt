My lips remember your kisses
My heart remembers your love
You're the girl I've pictures of above me
The girl that I'll always dream of

My lips remember your kisses
My heart remembers the thrill
Of moments when you whispered you adore me
And the magic of a moonlit hill

I recall the time we met
Gone was all the gloom
You were mine but hard to get
Like a rare and new perfume

My lips remember your kisses
My heart remembers your love
And you're the girl I'm bound to go back to
The girl that I'll always dream of

My lips remember your kisses
My heart remembers your love
And you're the girl I'm bound to go back to
The girl that I'll always dream of
