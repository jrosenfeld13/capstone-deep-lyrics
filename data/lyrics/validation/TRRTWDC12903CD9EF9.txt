[Verse 1]
I walked the white line
I did the shoeshines
I break you down so you can go down
(Yeah!)
I ran the rat race
I made the front page
I break you down so you can go down now
So you can go down now, so you can go down now
Yeah yeah!

[Chorus]
I bet you'd beg if you were serious
So break on down
Break on down now

[Verse 2]
I made the big break
And I made my own mistakes
I break it down so you can go down
(You can go down now) Yeah!
You wash away me
But you don't try to save me
I break you down so you can go down now
So you can go down now
So you can go down now, yeah, yeah!

[Chorus]
I bet you'd beg if you were serious
So break on down
Break on down now. (x2)

[Bridge]
For every time you punished me
For every time you laughed at me
For every time you beat me down
Look at me now (x5)
Look at me now, bitch
Look at me now
Look at me now (x4)

[Chorus]
I bet you'd beg if you were serious
So break on down
Break on down now. (x2)

Yeah yeah!

Begging you (what?) begging me (what?) (x3)
BEGGING YOU!
