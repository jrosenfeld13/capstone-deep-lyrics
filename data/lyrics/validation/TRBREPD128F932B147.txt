[Intro]
Can we talk about it now?
I mean, the little trouble we've been havin' it lately
I really can't stand the way that we're acting towards each other
It's just not right, you know
Here I am, I wanna love you
And you say you wanna love me
But, then you get into bed and you turn your back on me, and you're angry, andwhat have I done?
I just gotta be near you, I just gotta tell you how much I want you
Maybe love to you is buying me cars, giving me money, buying me fancy clothes

[Verse 1]
You do the things that show me just how much you love me
And the things you do, baby, keeps me lovin' you
But the love like that, that would surely last eternity
And although I love you so much, there's still this itch inside of me
'Cause it seems whenever I need you passion'ly
Your body's just too tight, baby, and I don't like what you doin' to me

[Chorus]
Love without sex is like a baby without it's mother
Love is just no good, havin' one without the other
Sex without love is like tires without rubber
It can get real dangerous, havin' one without the other

[Verse 2]
You're so sweet to me, just like a man should be
The things you're doing to my mind, I want you to do to my body
Givin' me what I need, that's what you got to do
You own my mind, my soul, my heart, let me give my love to you
There is no way you can be happy when your love life is sad
I hope you can dig what I'm sayin' and please don't get mad

[Chorus]
Love without sex is like a baby without it's mother
Lord, one just ain't no good without the other
Sex without love is like a tire without rubber
When you give your love to me baby, one just ain't no good without the other

[Outro]
Love without sex is like tires without rubber
Just ain't no good to me, y'all
Do the the things that show me just how much you care for me, baby
And that's love
Sometimes, sometimes, it gets real dangerous
It gets real dangerous, y'all
Havin' one love affair, havin' one love affair
Oh, sex without love is like a baby without it's mother
