Which will it be?
Sympathy or apathy?
Which part of the human condition will I believe?
Tried then it's tested
I've just decided...
Tried and it's tested and I've just decided I 've failed

When it all came down
On that Saturday night
Should I choose a side
At 9th at Pine
Can we still say we're civilized?
Watched some kid go down at 9th at Pine...

Is it the crowd or the way this is going down?
Is it being human watching without a sound?
Tried and it's tested and i just decided...
Tried and it's tested and i just decided i failed

When it all came down
On that Saturday night
Should I choose a side
