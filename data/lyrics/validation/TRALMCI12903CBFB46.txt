I like the way that you lick your teeth
Oh it's so dirty better make it confessional
I like the way that you look at me
I bet your body moves like a professional
I love the way you dress in leather and lace
I love the way you blow the smoke on my face
I like the way that you challenge me
Keepin' me to daze then amaze with your pretty little face!
(Look Out!)
Ain't you such a badass baby
You walk the wire and you play with fire
(Look Out!)
Yeah you sexy badass baby
The stakes are higher when you play with fire
Ready to fight, light up the night!
(Badass!)
You got the thighs and you got appeal
And everybody finds it so unconventional
You got the eyes and I can't believe
That anybody could deny the sensational
I love the way you blow the others away
I love the way you're walking right in my face
I like the way that you challenge me
Messin' up my pace in your chase
Gonna put you in your place!
(Look Out!)
Ain't you such a badass baby
You walk the wire and you play with fire
(Look Out!)
Yeah you sexy badass baby
The stakes are higher when you play with fire
Walking on wire higher and higher
Ain't you such a badass baby
Ready to fight, light up the night!
(Badass!)
A lotta lies and the mystery
A lotta liquor and the lips of a lunatic
A lotta soul in your secrecy
It says it all and you know that I'm lovin' it
I love the way you blow the others away
I love the way you blow the smoke on my face
I love the way that you challenge me
Messin' up my pace, the chase!
(Ahhh.. Badass!)
Ain't you such a badass baby
You walk the wire and you play with fire
(Look Out!)
Yeah you sexy badass baby
The stakes are higher when you play with fire
Ready to fight, light up the night!
(Badass!)
Ain't you such a badass baby
You walk the wire and you play with fire
(Look Out!)
Yeah you sexy badass baby
The stakes are higher when you play with fire
Walking on wire higher and higher
Ain't you such a badass baby
Ready to fight, light up the night!
(Badass!)
(Badass!)
(Badass!)
(Badass!)
(Badass!)
