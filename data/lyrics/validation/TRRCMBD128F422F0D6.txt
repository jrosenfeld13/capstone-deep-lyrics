The things ive done, the things ive seen
Are the foundation for the pain that lies in me it never leaves
The pain becomes pure hatred, the hatred just burns
It burns it fucking burns
Im being overwhelmed, im losing control, my childhood ripped away
My innocence they stole
Its time to learn true fear
On reckoning day, the grand finale, ill never shed a tear..

( Chorus )
I wanna piss on the ashes of your twisted world
I wanna watch the whole fucking thing, burn, burn, burn
Because all I have is hate for our twisted world, and when it falls
Ill die laughing..
I wanna spit on the ashes of this twisted world
I wanna watch the whole fucking thing, burn, burn, burn
Because an Enemy Of man, is what I am
And when the end comes, you'll hear me laughing..

Phsycotic laughter as the world I hate burns away
Prayings no use
We've reached the judgement day of our lives
We'll all meet our demise
The guilt ridden and the innoecnt must now cry and die in pain
The world will reach out to repent any chances have been spent
This is what was meant
This world built by hate, it will soon be to late
And we can't ever deny our fucking fate

( Chorus )
I wanna piss on the ashes of your twisted world
I wanna watch the whole fucking thing, burn, burn, burn
Because all I have is hate for our twisted world, and when it falls
Ill die laughing..
I wanna spit on the ashes of this twisted world
I wanna watch the whole fucking thing, burn, burn, burn
Because an Enemy Of man, is what I am
And when the end comes, you'll hear me laughing..

The Glee on my contempt for the world, the end pleases me..
It excites me... Armageddon
My prayers of are answered and now you hear me laughing
ILL SHIT ON THE ASHES OF THIS FUCKED UP WORLD!
As I watch burn.. it fucking burns
The last glimpse this world will ever see is me laughing aloud
The end is coming near... Bring It on
