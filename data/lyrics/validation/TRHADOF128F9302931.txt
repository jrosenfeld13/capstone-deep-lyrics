Like a shooting star
Across the midnight sky
Wherever you are
You're gonna see me fly
Like a shooting star
Across the midnight sky
Wherever you are
You're gonna see me fly!
So high!

Like a shooting star
Across the midnight sky
Wherever you are
You're gonna see me fly
Like a shooting star
Across the midnight sky
Wherever you are
You're gonna see me fly!
Across the midnight sky!

Where were you to hold my hand?
Do the things that we had planned?
Yes, I need you by my side
When things go crazy
I just need to know you care
Guaranteed that you'll be there

When I wake up in the night
Will you be my guiding light?
I don't care how far
I'll take a plane tonight
Just tell me where you are
And everything's gonna be alright
Like a shooting star

Across the midnight sky
Gonna fly
Just to be with you tonight
Like a shooting star
Across the midnight sky
Gonna fly
Just to be with you tonight
