I've been drivin' this truck
With a broken heart
Can't stop drivin'
Once I stop it might never stop
Engine roar down
From Detroit, Michigan
Engine roar and roar
Won't let no silence in
I need somebody, I need somebody
I need somebody

Coffee girl could be the one I need
But all she can see is
Breakfast one, two, three
Everybody, everybody seems
Like a stranger to me
But nobody, nobody could
Be as strange as me
When I need somebody
I need somebody, I need somebody

Well they don't have
To be somebody new
Don't have to be a love so true
Could even be somebody just like you
I need somebody who
Needs somebody too
