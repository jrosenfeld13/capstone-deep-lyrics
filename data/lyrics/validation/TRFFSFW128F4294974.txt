[Intro]
As long as we're getting a bit technical
I'd like to remind you that most women and children
Can perceive higher frequencies of sound than most men

[Jayne Hill]
Everywhere I see your faces
Everywhere you sing your smile and
Every time you're not around
It doesn't matter
'Cause you're everywhere to me

Everyone you've ever known counts on you
Waits for you
To come through
Don't you know that you're gonna break through?


And everywhere you came and left
You came in the name of love and
Left a wake of happiness and tenderness
And sweet conflict, sweet conflict


You hang around
You come on down
You come on down
And it's on and on and on and on

It's on
It goes on


You hang around
You come on down
But you don't come down

Whispering
Whispering
Whispering your name

You're everywhere, everywhere, everywhere
To me
Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere
To me

(Calling)
(Calling)

I'm calling your number
(Calling)
I'm calling your number
(Calling)
I'm calling your number
Calling your number
I'm calling your number
(Calling)

You're everywhere
You're everywhere to me
Everywhere to me
