[Verse 1]
I would've liked you to have been deep frozen too
And waiting still as fresh in your flesh for my return to Earth
But your father refused to sign the forms to freeze you
Let's see you'd be about 60 now
And long dead by the time I return to Earth
My time held dreams were full of you
As you were when I left, still underage
Your android replica is playing up again, it's no joke
When she comes she moans another's name

[Chorus]
That's the spirit of the age
That's the spirit of the age
That's the spirit of the age
That's the spirit of the age
Ah, the spirit of the age
That's the spirit of the age
Ah, the spirit of the age
That is the spirit of the age

[Verse 2]
I am a clone, I am not alone
Every fiber of my flesh and bone is identical to the others
Everything I say is in the same tone
As my test tube brother's voice there is no choice between us
If you had ever seen us you'd rejoice in your uniqueness
And consider every weakness something special of your own
Being a clone I have no flaws to identify
Even this doggerel that pours from my pen
Has just been written by another twenty telepathic men
Oh, word for word, it says:
"Oh, for the wings of any bird, other than a battery hen"
