I like breaking arms and legs
Snapping spines and wringing necks
Now i'll knife you in the back
Kick your bones until they crack

I'm Evil, evil, evil, evil
Evil, evil, evil, evil

Jump up and down upon your head
Kick you around 'til your dead
Fill your body full of lead
See the roads turn to red

I'm Evil, evil, evil, evil
Evil, evil, evil, evil

I don't like trendy cunts who pose
Gonna punch you in the Nose
Stick my Marten in your crotch
Don't like you, you're too much

I'm Evil, evil, evil, evil
Evil, evil, evil, evil

I'm Evil, evil, evil, evil
Evil, evil, evil, evil
