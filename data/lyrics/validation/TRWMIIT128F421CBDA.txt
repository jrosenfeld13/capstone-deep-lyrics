I choose my friends only far too well
I'm up on the pavement
They're all down in the cellar
With their government grants and my IQ
They brought me down to size
Academia blues

Louise is a girl
I know her well
She's up on the pavement
Yes, she's a weather girl
And I'm staying up here so I may be undone
She's inappropriate but then she's much more fun and

When she smiles my way
My eyes go out in vain
She's got perfect skin

Shame on you, got no sense of grace
Shame on me
Just in case I might
Come to a conclusion other than that which is absolutely necessary
And that's perfect skin

Louise is the girl with the perfect skin
She says, "Turn on the light otherwise it can't be seen"
She's got cheekbones like geometry and eyes like sin
And she's sexually enlightened by Cosmopolitan and

When she smiles my way
My eyes go out in vain
For her perfect skin
Yeah, that's perfect skin

She takes me down to the basement
To look at her slides
Of her family life
Pretty weird at times
At the age of ten she looked like Greta Garbo and I loved her then
But how was she to know that

When she smiles my way
My eyes go out in vain
She's got perfect skin

Up eight flights of stairs to her basement flat
Pretty confused, huh?
Being shipped around like that
Seems to climb so high
Now we're down so low
Strikes me the moral of the song
Must be: there never has been one
