[Verse 1:]
Why do they leave me all by myself?
Why do they use me and break me down?
Why do they hurt me, why do they leave?
Why doesn't anybody stick around?

[Chorus 1:]
Why doesn't anyone stay here, why do they leave me
Don't they realize I'm a porcelain doll?
Small, unsure, beautiful, breakable

[Verse 2:]
If I sit here waiting to be wanted
Something good will pass me by
Many people look through the windows
But seldom do they ever look in my eyes

[Chorus 2:]
Why doesn't anyone stay here, why do they leave me?
Don't they realize I'm a porcelain doll?
Fragile, helpless, unwanted, breakable

[Bridge:]
They can't tell that I'm sweet
They can't tell I'm like a porcelain doll
Beautiful and demure
But played with one too many times

[Verse 3:]
Why am I not numb to this?
Why can't I let it all outside my mind?
Don't let me sit here collecting dust
But please be careful, please be kind

[Chorus 3:]
Why doesn't anyone stay here, why do they leave me
Don't they realize I'm a porcelain doll?
Lost, alone, unsure
Kind, demure, small
Breakable
Breakable
