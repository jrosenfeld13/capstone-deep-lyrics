[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Can this feeling that we have together
Oooh, Suddenly exist between
Did this meeting of our minds together
Oooh, Happen just today, somewhere

[Chorus]
I'd like to know
Can you tell me - please don't tell me
It really doesn't matter anyhow
It's just that the thought of us so happy
Appears in my mind, as a beautifully mysterious thing

Yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
Was your image in my mind so deeply
Oooh, other faces fade away
Blocking memories of unhappy hours
Oooh, Leavin' just a burnin' love

[Chorus]
Got to know now baby

[Instrumental Solo]

[Verse 3]
Can this lovin' we have found within us
Oooh, Suddenly exist between
Did we somehow try to make it happen
Oooh, Was it just a natural thing

[Chorus]
Yes it does now baby

[Outro]
