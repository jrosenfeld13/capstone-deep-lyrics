I went to see Rebeca
She's busy dancing in the streets
She's dreaming of a future
Se's entering stages all around the world

I pass the railway station
I'll let people busy on their way
I saw Orlando
A man collecting money for the poor

And suddenly the sky breaks up
I feel the warmth from the sun
It finds it's way into my heart
Awakes the sleeping corners of my day

Wheels keep spinning
There's always a new beginning
Round the corners we pass
Beyond the end of this day
In a pulsation within a snapshot we grasp

I crossed the square
The market place
With an apple in my hand
The booths are overflowing
With different fruits from all around the world

I watch the children rushing
They fill their gap with playful noise
A mirror of my own youth
So long agonstill seems like yesterday

And suddenly the sky breaks up
I feel the warmth from the sun
It finds it's way into my heart
Awakes the sleeping corners of my day

Wheels keep spinning
There's always a new beginning
Round the corners we pass
Beyond the end of this day
