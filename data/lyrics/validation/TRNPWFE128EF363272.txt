This year I want to end this
I've made a fool of myself over again
This year I want to feel that
Comfort of having someone over again
You've taken all that was me, I thought I wasn't like them
But I guess that I am
Transcend away from this room
This conversation's wearing thin
I won't let you take over
I won't have things this way
"You try and fail." time and again
You've taken all that was me, I thought I wasn't like them
But I guess that I am
What do you say when asked if you really like this or is this fake?
What do you say when asked is this really what you want?
What do you say when asked is this really what you want?
What do you say when asked am I really what you want?
Transcend away from this room
This conversation's wearing thin
I won't let you take over
I won't have things this way
"You try and fail." time and again
You've taken all that was me, I thought I wasn't like them
But I guess that I am
You've taken all that was me, I thought I wasn't like them
But I guess that I am
Am
