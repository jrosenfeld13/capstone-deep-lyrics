This is a warning for all of us that are falling
For the lie that we could be bigger than God
You can tell us our future is coming
It's got us running, somebody sound the alarm

We aren't perfect, no one's perfect

We don't get it and don't care if we do
We're crying like we're innocent
We don't get it and don't care if we do

This is a protest for all of us that are hungry
We can't shake the feeling, you know what I mean?
You can tell us there's no emergency but I feel the urgency
I can see the flashing lights and burning skies

We aren't perfect, no one's perfect

We don't get it and don't care if we do
We're not dealing with the consequence
We don't get it and don't care if we do
We're crying like we're innocent

We don't get it and don't care if we do
We're burning like a cigarette
We don't get it and don't care if we do
We're crying like we're innocent

Remember when we were young
We didn't need evidence, we had our innocence
And now time's slipping on by
Our hearts are given away, what a mistake

We don't get it and don't care if we do
We're not dealing with the consequence
We don't get it and don't care if we do
We're crying like we're innocent

We don't get it and don't care if we do
We're burning like a cigarette
We don't get it and don't care if we do
We're crying like we're innocent

This is a warning for all of us that are falling
For the lie that we could be bigger than God
You can tell us there's no emergency but I feel the urgency
Somebody sound the alarm
