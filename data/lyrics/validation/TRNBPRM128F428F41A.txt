I'm showing my hands and I'm showing my arms
Keeping it all down here, so don't look round
Yes, it matters - yes, there's truth
Showing me failures - I know it's you
Swinging like a baby, caught like a man
Mary Jesus, they call me back

Deposit insect hand me a king
I'm going down here like a silly Joe Bag
Fat baby and a fat little man
Soul body soul body soul body soul!
I'm in me, I'm not in you
Somebody somebody somebody here don't don't fuck with me

Swing like a baby and you sing it like a man
I'm showing my hands (and I showing my arms
Swing like a baby) and you catch it like a man
Mary Jesus, they call me back
And like a fool I think I am

Said it don't bother me like a fat red dress
And like a fool I'm burning
Show me a little respect
Singing like a baby, acting like a man
And Mary Jesus, they call me back
So like a fool I think I am
I'm walking to you just to walk back...
