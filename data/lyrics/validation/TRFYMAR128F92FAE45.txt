I'm an island
Everyone can see that I'm an island
I've got ocean just about
Everywhere that I can see

So I'll be stranded unless you come to me
And I'm lonely

I would rather fall from grace completely, than let you change my mind
I would rather bet my life against the rising of the sun

Can't be too careful
About the friends you keep around you
Some won't ever let you down
Some who'll fail you every day

And it's a blatant disrespect of privacy
It enrages me

I would rather fall from grace completely, than let you change my mind
I would rather bet my life against the rising of the sun

I'm an island
Can't you understand me? I'm an island
And I'm finally by myself
The way I've got to be

Now that's exactly the thing that's been killing me

I would rather fall from grace completely, than let you change my mind
I would rather bet my life against the rising of the sun
