Alquist-Stuart

You've heard a lot of stories about me
But don't believe the things that people say
I'll be always true, I'll be loving you
Like I love you today

I've got a reputation all my own
But don't believe I'll ever go away
Listen to me do, I'll be loving you
Like I love you today

I've got kisses by the million
And I've got some more
I've got kisses by the million
Who, who do you think they're for?

After all is said and all is done
I'll be yours for ever and a day
You know that it's for sure, I'll love you more and more
Like I love you today
