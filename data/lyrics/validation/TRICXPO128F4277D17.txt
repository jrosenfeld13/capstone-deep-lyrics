All I ever wanted was to see you smiling

I know that I love you oh baby why don't you see

All I ever wanted was to see you smiling
All I ever wanted was to make you mine
I know that I love you oh baby why don't you see
That all I ever wanted was you and me

All I ever wanted was to see you smiling
All I ever wanted was to make you mine
I know that I love you oh baby why don't you see
That all I ever wanted was you and me

Drop The Bass

I'm so alone
Here on my own
And I'm waiting for you to come
I want to be a part of you
Think of all the things we could do
And everyday
You're in my head
I want to have you in my bed
You are the one
You're in my eyes
All I ever wanted in my life

All I ever wanted was to see you smiling
All I ever wanted was to make you mine
I know that I love you oh baby why don't you see
That all I ever wanted was you and me

All I ever wanted was to see you smiling
All I ever wanted was to make you mine
I know that I love you oh baby why don't you see
That all I ever wanted was you and me

Are You Ready

All I ever wanted was to see you smiling
All I ever wanted was to make you mine
I know that I love you oh baby why don't you see
That all I ever wanted was you and me

All I ever wanted
