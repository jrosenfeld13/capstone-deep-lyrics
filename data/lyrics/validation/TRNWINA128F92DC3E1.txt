First of all I thought to turn away from you
Then you did the same for me
No one knows if clover leaves
Will always come in fours
But if you can't learn from my mistakes
Woman, I can't learn from yours

You chose another man to give you back your pride
Before you gave a chance to me
Just as sure as rivers couldn't wind
If it weren't for shores
You can't hide from my mistakes
Woman, I can't hide from yours

I didn't mean to put an ending to our time
Or let you leave the way you came
Or do for one another
Like the carpet does the floor
But you can't pay for my mistakes
Woman, I can't pay for yours
