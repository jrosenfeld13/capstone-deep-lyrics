[Verse 1]
Don't tell lies
You can't keep goin' on
This way
Realize
It's no good puttin' on
Your friends
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh

[Bridge]
You think you're smart
But you just contradict
All that you say

[Chorus]
Don't put me on
It puts me off
You've had your fun
I've had enough

[Verse 2]
From the start
I knew you'd miss the point
I've had enough
So I'll just smoke a joint

[Chorus]
Don't put me on
It puts me off
You've had your fun
I've had enough

[Interlude]
Wow!

[Verse 3]
One chance I'm told
And that is all
Poltroons
Like you I've known
Vacant and cold
God save your soul
