[Verse 1]
The best things in life are free
But you can keep them for the birds and bees

[Chorus]
I need money
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want

[Verse 2]
Your love give me such a thrill
But your love don't pay my bills

[Chorus]
I need money
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want

[Verse 3]
Money don't get everything it's true
What it don't get I can't use

[Chorus]
I need money
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want

[Outro]
Money
Lots of money
Whole lot of money
Uh huh
All I want
Woah Yeah
Give me Money
Oh, lots of money
All those lean greens, Yeah
I got that, uh, that's what I mean
All that I want
Woah Yeah
