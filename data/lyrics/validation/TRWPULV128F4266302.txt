Another dog day, a crystal memory
Another broken body aching for recovery
Another road kill, another pantomime
With the city slicker jitters as the NASDAQ index flickers

They're gonna start charging for the air that you breathe
So love your neighbor and love your enemy
But don't you do it in a place where anyone can see
So won't you lay down and spend some time with me

Well, I'm hoping that you're joking
I always thought that love was free
They're gonna start charging for the air that you breathe
In the spotlight, new aristocracy

Why send a middleman to come and get a piece of me?
Black Jacks, blasting caps, Billy clubs and baseball bats
BB guns and acrobats, a pure emotion body lotion
They're gonna start charging for the air that you breathe
