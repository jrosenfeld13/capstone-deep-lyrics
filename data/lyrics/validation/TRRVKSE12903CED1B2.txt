Welcome to the city
Where the lion is king
Don't try to live
Just try to survive

Watch your step
Open your eyes
There might be a trap
Caution is wise

Come in, stranger
But watch out for the danger

Jungle city
Welcome to
Jungle city

If you are strong
You will get a chance
But if you are weak
There will be no romance

Come in, stranger
But watch out for the danger

Jungle city
Welcome to
Jungle city

Come in, stranger
But watch out for the danger

Jungle city
Welcome to
Jungle city

Jungle city
Welcome to
Jungle city, oh yeah

Oh, yeah go
