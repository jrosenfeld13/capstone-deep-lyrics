There's a God in heaven
There's a God in hell
I see God when I close my eyes
Here on Earth as well
Here on Earth as well

I was lost in confusion
Down on my luck for a spell
I found truth in a sing that I heard
Here on Earth as well
Here on Earth as well

And they say heaven help you
You can do what you want
But don't leave when it's done
And they say time will heal you
But you need more than faith to get by
Yes you need more than faith to get by

The man said Adam got justice
He was stupid and he fell
I said I fell once too in a dream that I had
Here on Earth as well
Here on Earth as well yeah
