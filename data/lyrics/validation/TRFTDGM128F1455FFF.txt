(J.J. Cale)

You don't come here too often
You make my day when you come around
You know I love you something awful
You're a diamond I have found
Wish I had not said that, baby
If I could only close you out of my mind

Sunset passes oh so sweetly
Gives a man just time to think
Frees the image of your body
Fantasy is just a blink
Wish I had not said that, baby
If I could only close you out of my mind

It don't matter what you're into
If I could taste you once again
Feel the pain and the pleasure
We could make it to the end
Wish I had not said that, baby
If I could only close you out of my mind
