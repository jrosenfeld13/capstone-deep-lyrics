If the shoe fits, they say wear it. i say fuck them, i say fuck this. i've got two hands, make that two fists. you won't like me when i'm like this. i could really care less about that. i say what i say, i say what i want. all i ask is that you bury me deep. at least... thirteen feet under the ground. i won't make a sound. i promise you this. i have witnessed, my own train wreck. leaves a bad taste, and a stiff neck. but my backbone, is the backbeat. i'm still breathing, i am dead meat. i won't even make you take it back. i don't care what you say, mind what you say. all i ask is that you bury me deep. so i can get some sleep. i won't make a peep. when i'm thirteen feet under the ground. i won't make a sound. i promise you this
