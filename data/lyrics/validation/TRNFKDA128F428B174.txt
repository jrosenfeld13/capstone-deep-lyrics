I have the captain on the line
Wants to know who made it through this time
Wants to know who's smiling this time
Don't know that the captain has to say, on how this decorated man became a boy
Doesn't want to know that it's bed time

Wants just one more game to see him through night time
Although they took his men away, he wants the paper and the empty box to stay
