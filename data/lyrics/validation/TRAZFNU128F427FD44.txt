[Verse 1]
Uh huh, alright...
This time going to do my best to make it right
Can't go on without you by my side, hold on
Shelter come and rescue me out of this storm
And out of this cold I need someone
Oh why oh why why why...
(If you see her)
Tell her this for me
All I need is...

[Chorus]
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(One more)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(See)
(One more)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(One more)
One more chance at love
(Alright)
One more chance at love

[Verse 2]
Searching for that one who is going to make me whole
Help me make these mysteries unfold, hold on
Lightning about to strike in rain only on me
Hurt so bad sometimes it is hard to breathe
Oh why why
(If you see her)
Tell her this from me
All I need is...

[Chorus]
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(One more)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(One more chance for love)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(One more)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love

[Verse 3]
And I would walk around this world to find her
And I do not care what it takes no, why
I would sail the seven seas to be near her
And if you happen to see her
See, tell her this from me

[Chorus]
One more chance at love
(Yeah, Yeah)
One more chance at love
(Tell her this from me)
One more chance at love
(Yeah, Yeah)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(Loving you)
One more chance at love
(I can't find)
One more chance at love
(Loving you)
One more chance at love
(Yeah one more)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(For love)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(Yeah I Cannot stop)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(Loving you)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(I can't stop)
One more chance at love
(Loving you)
(Aw)
One more chance at love
(I can't stop)
One more chance at love
