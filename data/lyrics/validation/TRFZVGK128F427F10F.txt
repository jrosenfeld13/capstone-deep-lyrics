Saw things I shouldn't have. I made a fool of myself
It didn't have to hurt me quite as much as it did
Knowing the things you said, knowing they're probably half-lies
Made to make a girl smile, doesn't make it alright
Doesn't make it fine

Oh what does she say to make you light up this way?
I'd say it too, if only that way open to me

Ba ba bada ba ba
See me on one knee to you
Ba ba bada ba ba
Shedding all my pride for you
Ba ba bada ba ba
Trying to see if you wish me gone

You don't apologies for having told so many lies
You would have to be saying sorry for a whole day
She's not so different. She's just a newer type of me
With a better haircut. is that all you wanted?
Is it all you want?

Oh what does she say to make you light up this way?
I'd say it too, if only that was open to me

Ba ba bada ba ba
See me on one knee to you
Ba ba bada ba ba
Shedding all my pride for you
Ba ba bada ba ba
Trying to see if you wish me gone

Love me, loathe me
Hold me, hate me
Kiss me, kill me
But say that you don't ever want to lose me

Oh what does she say to make you light up this way?
I'd say it too, if only that was open to me
