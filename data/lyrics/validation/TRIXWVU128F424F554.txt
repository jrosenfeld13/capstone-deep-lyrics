[Words & Music: M. Kiske]

Now that you're near me
Now you can hear me
It's all in the picture now
If I'm ever breathing
If I'm ever living
It's got to be here and now

My life was pre-arranged by me
And that's where I went wrong
No pre-arranging life, you see
Could ever get this done

I'd say we got it made
We got it great
And I don't wanna change it
I see now all follow me
When all follow me
They don't need to change it

It's got to be true now
It's got to be you now I just paint it on me
No too high mountains
That's what it gets down to
I just paint it on me
I see, you love me
I don't need much more

I have been restless
And unfulfilled excess
Home long seemed out of sight
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
I've found it in you tonight

The falling rain just covers me
But doesn't reach my heart
And all that's said suits perfectly
I don't know where to start
My prayers and all of my dares
And all of my cares
Will always be around you
I see, love has found me
I'd never believed
I'd ever be around you

It's got to be true now
It's got to be you now I just paint it on me
No too high mountains
That's what it gets down to
I just paint it on me

Now golden rain comes down
All over this old town

It's got to be true now
It's got to be you now I just paint it on me
No too high mountains
That's what it gets down to
I just paint it on me
I see, you love me
I don't need much more
