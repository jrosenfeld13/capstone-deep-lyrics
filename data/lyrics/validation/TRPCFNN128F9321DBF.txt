At take off my heart starts to race
Looks like everything is falling into place
But for this kind of miracle cure
It takes a lover's scorn to settle up the score...

Breathe in, breathe out
It brings me closer...
It's ok, it's alright...
It happens every night

I've been chasing dreams
All my life
Now life is but a dream...

The chances are I'll never be the same
And it's a feeling I don't ever want to tame

'Cause I could spend the rest of my days
Watching her move with elegance and grace

Breathe in, breathe out
It brings me closer...
It's ok, it's alright....
It happens every night

I've been chasing dreams
All my life
And now life is but a dream...

Breathe in, breathe out
It gets me closer

It's ok, it's alright
It happens every night
'Cause I've been chasing dreams all my life
And now life is but a dream...

It's ok, it's alright
Now life is but a dream...
