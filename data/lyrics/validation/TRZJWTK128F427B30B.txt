In a little while I will go for you, in a little while I will bleed for you
In a little while I will hang for you, in a little while I will call for you
You, I only want to spend my time with you
I cracked my skin so I could be with you
I made the world to stop it just for you, I want to be with you
There's a little place that I will build for you
There's an empty space that I will fill in you
You, I only want to spend my time with you
I cracked my skin so I could be with you
I made the world to stop it just for you, I want to be with you
