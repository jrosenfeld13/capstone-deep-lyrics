She's got that look in her eye
"that's ok, everything's alright", a lie
She dreams of absolution
From a life that's nailed her heart to the floor
And she don't want this again
She cries in the night
She don't want this
She cries in the night
She's got that look in her eye
Got that look in her eye
Choking down the horror of her life
She's got that look in her eye
Got that look in her eye
She don't want this
Don't want this, no
She don't want this
She don't want this
Don't want this, no
She don't want this
Looking up straight up to the sun
She'll tell you she'll be the one
She'll be everything you need tonight
She's got that look in her eye
Got that look her eye
She don't want this
Don't want this, no
She don't want this
She don't want this
Don't want this, no
She don't want this
Giving up in the middle of the night
I will run to your side
Giving up in the middle of night
I will run to you
Giving up in the middle of the night
I will run to your side
Baby don't you give up the fight
