Tell the dj that it's time to play a slow jam
Get closer to me girl
Do something to me girl
Come on and choose me girl
I'm right here on this dance floor

When you think of sweat, you think of sex
So dj play my shhh, and girl let's get to it
I got what you need
Set your body free
All you need is keith
I'll bring out the freak floor

Whithout a doubt, I'm trying to pump it on
Come on and leave this place
I'll take you to my place
And freak you at my place
In the morning girl I'll drive you home

When you think of sweat, you think of sex
So dj play my shhh, and girl let's get to it

Set your body free
