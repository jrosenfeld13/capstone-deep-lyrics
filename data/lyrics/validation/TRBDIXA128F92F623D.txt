I?ve got the blues goin? round in my bed
I?ve got the blues goin? round in my head
Lord, though I try and I try
Oh I knew it wasn?t right
Why can?t I sleep at night

Where did I mess up
Where did I go wrong
I ask these things I?ll never know
As I lay awake goin? round and round
I keep singing the same old song

Oh I try and I try
Oh I knew it wasn?t right
So why can?t I sleep at night
Oh why can?t I sleep at night

If I can only dream
What will my story be

Would you be holdin me
And when I close my eyes
Are you by my side
Lord have I realised
Oh, that you?re my everything, everything, oh

I got the blues goin? round in my head
I got the blues goin? round in my bed
Oh I try and I try
Oh I try and I try
Oh I try and I try
Why can?t I sleep at night
Why can?t I sleep, why can?t I sleep at night?

Ooh yes, oh yes?
