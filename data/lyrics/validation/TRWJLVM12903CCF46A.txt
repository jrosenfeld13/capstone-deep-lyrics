Hey you Mr. Blue Eyes
Don't even think about playing me
You've been cheating, you've been lying
Got me so sad I've been crying
Well I'm tired of being treated like a fool
So if you ain't gonna be my man
A good good man then fuck you ha

I'm mad so mad
You said you could wait and carry me over
I'm mad so mad
You promised me love but forgot to deliver

Always together forever and ever till death do us part
You'll be stuck in my heart
What a load of - Yeah
What a load of

I'm mad so mad
You showed me my heart then stabbed me right in it
I'm mad so mad
You made me believe then changed religion

Always together forever and ever till death do us part
You'll be stuck in my heart
What a load of - Yeah

No matter what you say
It feels like your love has gone astray
Just promise me one thing baby don't beg me to stay
If you're planning on walking away

I'm mad so mad
You said that you love me but wished for another
I'm mad so mad
You caught me with love
But left me with sorrow

Always together forever and ever till death do us part
You'll be stuck in my heart
What a load of - Yeah

(What a load of) Get it together now baby
(What a load of) You promised you'd never betray me
(What a load of) Time again I have settled
(What a load of) Though you made me feel belittled
(What a load of) but now I won't beg for attention
(What a load of) cause I've had my own intervention
(What a load of) I know that I am better than that
(What a load of) So now you can't make me mad
(What a load of)...
