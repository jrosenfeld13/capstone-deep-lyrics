The Last that ever she saw him
Carried away
By a moonlight shadow
He passed on worried and warning
Carried away
By a moonlight shadow

Lost in a river
That saturday night
Far away
On the other side
He was caught in the middle
Of a desperate fight
And she could'nt find how to push through

The trees that whisper in the evening
Carried away
By a moonlight shadow
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving
Carried away
By a moonlight shadow

All she saw
Was a silhouette of a gun
Far away on the other side
He was shot six times
By a man on the run
And she could'nt find how to push through

I stay, I pray
I see you in heaven far away
I stay, I pray
I see you in heaven
One day

4 am in the morning
Carried away
By a moonlight shadow
I watched your vision forming
Carried away
By a moonlight shadow

Star was glowing in a silvery night
Far away on the other side
Will you come to talk to me this night
But she could'nt find how to push through

I stay, I pray
I see you in heaven far away
I stay, I pray
I see you in heaven
One day
