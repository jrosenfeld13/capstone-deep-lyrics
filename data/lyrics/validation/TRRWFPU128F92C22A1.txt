[Verse 1]
Everyone knows, ears to the ground
The daily drag finds the Oakland sky
Trench foot first and the spirit alive
Feel for the dawn, find the unbroken sound

[Chorus]
It can only get better from here
Don't have any fear

[Verse 2]
The universal key turns the whole man to his kind
Phosphate skin as the fall birds fly
Evolution will make a mess out of you
Tryin' to find love in the sewer of subterrania

[Chorus]
It can only get better from here
Don't have any fear

[Bridge]
The daily drag makes you stronger
The daily drag makes you stronger
Makes you stronger

[Verse 3]
Ever been a witness, ruinous in the morning
But the caged bird does sing a deeper blues
Ever seen the road less traveled and wondered
The best is with them, not with you or where you been?

[Chorus]
It can only get better from here
Don't have any fear
