Just know
You're not as smooth as you think
Oh God can you feel my pain
I tried and I tried but he never listened
Your house of lies will burn quickly
And scatter the ashes of you
And soon they'll all know the story
Soon they'll all know the truth
Seven hours
And that's all you could say
Seven hours
Choke on your tongue
It all comes around
And soon enough the sky will close in on you
Now that you're gone we're better off
I've been blind
But now I see you're a fake
Oh God can you feel my pain
I tried and I tried but he never listened
Your house of lies will burn quickly
And scatter the ashes of you
And soon they'll all know the story
Soon they'll all know the truth
Seven hours
And that's all you could say
Seven hours
Choke on your tongue
And it won't be the last time
That you run away
Choke on your tongue
It all comes around
You snake choke on your tongue
