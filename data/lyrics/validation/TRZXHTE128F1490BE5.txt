Life is a song, let's sing it together
Let's take our hearts and dip them in rhyme
Let's learn the words, let's learn the music together
Hoping the song lasts for a long, long time
Life is a song that goes on forever
Love's old refrain can never go wrong
Let's strike the note Mendelssohn wrote concerning spring weather
Let's sing together and make life a song
Don't be afraid of the future
All of our plans will come through
How can they fail with love on our side
They'll never fail, we won't be denied
All the world's a symphony, for you, for me
Life is a song, let's sing it together
Let's take our hearts and dip them in rhyme
Let's learn the words, let's learn the music together
Hoping the song lasts for a long, long time
Life is a song that goes on forever
Love's old refrain can never go wrong
Let's strike the note Mendelssohn wrote concerning spring weather
Let's sing it together and make life a song
