All the people stuck behind
Dead bolts and steel plates
Yr shut off from the noise outside
You couldn't leave if you tried

Because it's pointless
It's worthless
To deny that you are scared
All the fences and the walls we build
Will never fail

I am in love with the chance that we all
Could do better than we do
The lonely and broken
All the people forgotten
Let nobody tell you that yr heart was wrong

Send me little silver birds
To keep the promise that you made
One hundred thousand little lights
For all of us who feel the same
And all the fences and all the walls we build
Will one day maybe fall

I am in love with the chance that we all
Could do better than we do
The lonely and broken
All the people forgotten
Let nobody tell you that yr heart was wrong

I am in love with the chance that we all
Could do better than we do
The lonely and broken
All the people forgotten
Let nobody tell you that yr heart was wrong

'Cause even if nothing ever turns into something
Always believe that yr heart was right
