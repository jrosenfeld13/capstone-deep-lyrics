[Verse 1]
Oh, that was such a short goodbye
Never get to say exactly what I want in front of you
I always fall apart at the worst thoughts of crashing down
I know you know this isn't what you signed up for

[Chorus]
I'll never let this go
I'm in a different state every night
We're kept together by highways and telephone lines
[x2]

[Verse 2]
The mile markers help me countdown
The next time I'll be around
The only thing I'll leave my own
Is fallen leaves covering the ground
And a pale version of your complexion
I hope you know I'm worth waiting for

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
A long road, I've seen it all
Never wanting to look back
This long road, I've spent so much time
I'm glad you're willing to waiting for me
Because

[Chorus]
