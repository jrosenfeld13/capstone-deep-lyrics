Well, I love the way you walk with your skin tight stride
You got my eyes wide open and my loose tongue tied
A French kiss mouth and a smile so bad
You're the finest woman that I ever had
So it's alright do anythin' you wanna do
Nobody had to tell you how to make a man's heart bleed
Your mama always knew you was born to succeed
I can see the honey juice drippin' off your lips
Girl you got the Midas touch it's in your fingertips
But it's alright do anythin' you wanna do
'Cos after midnight I'll be alright ridin' on cupid's train
You give me lovin' like I've never had before, I'm back in the saddle again
So give me love an' affection, love an' affection
A little love an' affection sure 'nuff goes a long long way
You put your arms around me like a circle around the sun
Your eyes turn on the hypnotisin' game you play for fun
I'm caught in your spell just like the spider an' the fly
An' I can't turn away from you no matter how I try
But it's alrigh, to do anythin' you wanna do
'Cos after midnight I'll be alright ridin' on cupid's train
You give me lovin' like I've never had before, I'm back in the saddle again
So give me love an' affection, love an' affection
A little love an' affection sure 'nuff goes a long long way
'Cos after midnight I'll be alright ridin' on cupid's train
You give me lovin' like I've never had before, I'm back in the saddle again
So give me love an' affection, love an' affection
A little love an' affection, sure 'nuff goes a long long way
Love an' affection, a little love an' affection
Baby baby love an' affection
Sure 'nuff goes a long long way
Love love love
Love love love
I need love an' affection
Sure 'nuff goes a long long way
I just asked your mama baby
