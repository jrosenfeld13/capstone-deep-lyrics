You know if you were exorcised
Demoralized, it'll all be right.....yeah!
I'll grab my pen and write about
Kryptonite, so you can feel all right

You can build a bomb of lies
That doesn't hide who you are inside
You motherfuckers, it's all about shit

The bullshit runs off your tongue like spit
The psychotropic demi-god

It seems like you've been industrialized
Colorblind or just sold out yeah!
I never thought it would be like this
A million screaming mouths
A million pounds of shit you motherfuckers
All you fuckers just waste our time
Talking heads on sticks
Sucking corporate dicks
You motherfuckers
It's all about shit

The bullshit runs off your tongue like spit
The psychotropic demi-god

We'll always be the same
No matter who you are
(I hate this....I hate this...I hate this...)
