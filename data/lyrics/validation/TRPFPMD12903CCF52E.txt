Tell me what do you see
When you're looking back at me?
Am I as perfect as you are to me?
How do you dry up all my tears
And take away all my fears?

How do you make me feel this way?
Like I can take on anything
Like I can take on anything

You're over my head
You make me feel like more than
More than I am
This hell in my head
I swear these feelings are runnin' me over
You're over my head

Show me how does it feel
To be that light within your eyes?
Is it as perfect as it seems to be?

How do you make me feel this way?
Like I can take on anything
Like I can take on... take on anything

You're over my head
You make me feel like more than
More than I am
This hell in my head
I swear these feelings are runnin' me over
You're over my head
You're over my head

Faith in the things you can't see
You pull me up from beneath
Faith in the things you can't see
You pull me up from beneath
Faith in the things you can't see
I need you over my

You're over my head
You make me feel like more than
More than I am
This hell in my head
I swear these feelings are runnin' me over
You're over my head
You're over my head
You're over my head
You're over my head
