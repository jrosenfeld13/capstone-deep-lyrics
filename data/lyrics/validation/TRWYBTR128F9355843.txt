Back with
A vengeance much in vogue
My friend, the harlequin, the rogue
Befriending the meek
His tongue tucked firmly in his cheek

You better come clean
How could anybody be so mean
You better come clean
I will not be a party to your scheme

Admit
That I was misinformed
To wit I'm lost and all forlorn
I'm tattered and torn
Too tired to see how sick you've grown

You better come clean
How could anybody be so mean
You better come clean
I will not be a party to your scheme

???
Poor old soul

You better come clean
How could anybody be so mean
You better come clean
I will not be a party to your scheme

Come clean
I will not be a party to your scheme
I mean
The things you do just make me want to scream
