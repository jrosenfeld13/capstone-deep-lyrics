Hello lovers of truth
And beauty
So much of your lives
Goes on in your head
Where ever you are
It's always the beginning
What can you change
What can I change
The hurt and they
Don't know what it means
The need and they
Don't know what it means
It ain't why
It just is

Rip-off Poppoff

If you push hard enough
You could make anyone a fighter
There's nothing to understand
Everybody just knows

Rip-off Poppoff

Vaya con dios Amor
Vaya con dios Amor
Vaya con dios Amore
Vaya con dios Amor
How can you be a rebel
When the rebellion is the norm
Shut up till you know the truth
Shut up till you know the truth
