Breathing this poison, alive but near death
Under the water, and holding my breath
But we were made to drink in the earth
Its river and gutters, its mountains of worth

Fur and feathers, and leather, and scales
Theyll tear you apart if they get the chance
Fur and feathers, and leather, and scales
Theyll rip you apart, I swear that they will

Up in the rafters without any lift
Equal parts laughter, intention, and gift
It was an accident, there was no thought
With no concentration or steadiness there

Falling into the sky
Up from the earth and into the sky
Lift off the ground and hover awhile
Do you think you could fly if you tried
