I had a dream
I watched from afar
Was no longer hurting
From my broken heart

Then you came to me
I just couldn't believe
The words I've been waiting
So long to receive

When you say you love me
I know I will make it
'Cos in you I believe
When you say you love me
It touches my heart and my soul
Just to know you love me

You opened your heart
In my time of need
And feeling love so real
It's so comforting

Since you've come to me
Now I can believe
The words that I've waited
So long to receive

When you say you love me
I know I will make it
'Cos in you I believe
When you say you love me
It touches my heart and my soul
Just to know you love me
