When i was a little boy
I didn't know whats right or wrong
I had to change my way of life
But I just couldn't win the fight
I'd let myself float off in time
And hide

Another day
Another night
I lived off dreams
I thought was right
I couldn't stand
Being treated like
I was the only without rights
Stood there screaming out your voice
And cried

The way you loved me
Is not always what we call love
Waiting now
Beautiful pain
Beautiful pain
Beautiful pain
Beautiful pain
Beautiful

In the dirt
And in my soil
They said they planted seeds of joy
I was unholy born in sin
So they fed me words of lead within
Then I looked down on myself in shame
Left whit the blame

The way you loved me
Is not alwas what we call love
Waiting now beautiful pain
Beautiful pain
Beautiful pain
Beautiful pain
Beautiful pain
Beautiful pain

Mother, father listen up
I know these times were kind of rough
We waited for the leaders hand
To guide our lives
It's kind of sad
And you just did what you though was right
And cried

Beautiful pain
Beautiful pain
Beautiful pain
Beautiful pain
Beautiful pain
Beautiful pain
Beautiful pain
Beautiful pain
Beautiful pain
