So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from hell, blues skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail, a smile from a viel
Do you think you can tell?
And did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts
Hot ashes for trees
Hot air for a cool breeze
Cold comfort for change and didi you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?
