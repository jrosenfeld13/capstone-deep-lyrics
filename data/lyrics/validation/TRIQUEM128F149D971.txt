Inner Meet Me, oh you can't decide (repeated)

Last night I dreamt somebody fell asleep between my knees
I couldn't help it that the facts were rejected by a boy who called me (repeated 3 times)

She said to me
Keep your head up
Never show up
Keep it all in
Never dream alone
Play on a star
Moves too far
Say what you feel
Speak when you kneel
Never dream alone
Never dream alone

If you were feeling that the light is on the ceiling then you can't see past your nose
Cos what you're seeing is the man underneath the beam she's a fool below low
I never listen but the people they were christened I wonder who was the one
A better placement for the basement when he's chasing Mrs Mason when they're facing on the relation

She said to me
Keep your head up
Never show up
Keep it all in
Never dream alone
Play on a star
Moves too far
Say what you feel
Speak when you kneel
Never dream alone
Never dream alone
