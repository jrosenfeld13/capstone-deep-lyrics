A large man is feeling weak
He sounds like a cavity
I think he wants to scream, "Help me!"
It's not enough

Hot caviar breath and the weight of a chest
Patterns of the cracks in the ground
Can't get away

A wolf is feeling weak
Double sounds and double vision
Water water water
I'm going down
I sound like a cavity
I think I want to scream
HARDER
LOUDER

Hot caviar breath the weight of a chest
Patterns of the cracks in the ground
Watership Down

Worthless rings and golden fleeces
Wortless fleeces and golden rings

The beat is in the heart that decides
Two black holes or warm human eyes
Cold bricks hands and sad legs that won't stand

What was it that the store front man said?
What was it that he said?

What was it that the morning man said?
What was it that he said?

What was it that the carpet man said?
What was it that he said?
