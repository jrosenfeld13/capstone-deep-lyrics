They're closing down the factory, they're schutting the rusty gates
The union went on strike for days but it was already too late
The company moves on, they take it to another land
Don't care about their workers, leave 'em behind with empty hands

Just a Union Worker

30 Years of his life, he dedicated to his job
From one day to another, he's put aside like a dog
But rhe rich man doesn't care about the ruined lives he leaves behind
Because there's just one thing and that's money on his mind
So, now he's unemployed, he has got 3 kids to feed
He has lost his selfrespect, his onder and his pride
This honest working man, they took away his life

Just a Union Worker
