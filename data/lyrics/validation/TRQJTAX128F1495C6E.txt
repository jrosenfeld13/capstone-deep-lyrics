Why do we hurt the
Ones we really love
For all that we deserve
The world was not enough
For a fool like me
Time after time
You looked the other way
Believed in what I said
To think that you would stay
That was in my head

I couldn't see
What was happening to me
As I pushed you away
Just a little bit more each day
I love you still
And that is never ending

I never meant to make you cry
I can't get over you

I never meant to tell a lie
Nothing I can do
I never meant to make you cry
I can't get over you
I never knew the reason why

I look around the little things you find
The memories left behind
You're always on my mind
And I can't let go

Just for today I can live in a way
That I have to accept
That I'm not going to change your heart

I love you still
And that is never ending
