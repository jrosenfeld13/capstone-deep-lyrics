I've been asleep for months, I never had a dream
I feel hot and sad, I feel so unclean

Good things should come from dreaming, come to my second life
The girl I wake with laughing was not the same last night

Try to awaken dreaming, dream like I haven't been
Or be awake and lonely till I sleep again
