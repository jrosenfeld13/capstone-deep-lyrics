I might as well admit it
I fell for your letters and your smile
And when you stopped smiling I stopped hoping
And we didn't say what we feel
We both knew the end was close
And saying nothing is almost like lying

The way you talk so loud
Of you and you're glory days now
And I cant even say your name
The way you talk so proud
Of you and your glory days now
In my last breath I will say your name, Ill say your name

In my last breath I will say, Ill say your name

Oh, in my last breath
You gonna make me
You gonna make me say your name

And we spoke from the heart
And I know I played my part in it
When I said
Never ever
I don't know why I said it
No I didn't mean it
Not to be together
Together

The way you talk so loud
Of you and your glory days now
And I cant even say your name
The way you talk so proud
Of you and your glory days now
In my last breath I will say your name, Ill say your name

Oh, in my last breath you gonna make me
You gonna make me say your name
Oh, my last words, my last words will be
There is something in your voice
Theres just something I just cant explain
In my last breath i will say your name
Your name
