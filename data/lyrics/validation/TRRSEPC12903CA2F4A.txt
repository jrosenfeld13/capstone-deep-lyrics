[Verse 1: Stephin Merritt]
Everything is one big Christmas tree
All got up with lights and candy
All the world is turning prettily
Everyone's awaiting Sandy

Stop mumbling and cheer up
Put down the book, pick beer up

[Verse 2]
Why sit in your dark and lonely room?
Must your every word be sincere?
Here's a vial of laughing gas perfume
See that people smile when you're near

If they don't like you, screw them
Don't leave you fortune to them

[Verse 3]
Nein, vielleicht ist Alles nicht ein Traum
Ist Alles ein Albtraum? Nicht, nicht!
Alles ist ein groer Tannenbaum
Rotierend im Weltraumgeschichte
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

[Verse 1]
Everything is one big Christmas tree
All got up with lights and candy
All the world is turning prettily
Everyone's awaiting Sandy

[Outro]
Where can that Sandy be?
Where can that Sandy be?
Where can that Sandy be?
Where can that Sandy be?
Where can that Sandy be?
Where can that Sandy be?...
