Something's changing, it's in the breeze
No explaining, that's what it is
The only thing that can help us now
Is you (you...)
Man I don't worry, about the hymn
Spread it on what we've created
It's only just a vision of today

It's just my way of looking at things
Let's try and see what tomorrow brings
I hope you know that we're spinning out here
For our love

R-I-S-E
R-I-S-E
Up a-bove the
Situation
We we elevate you
I won't stop you
You won't need to

Into planetary fall
On this beautiful spinning ball
Just put your hand in mine
So life don't feel so cold (cold...cold...)
Look up into the mirror of the stars above
And you will see reflected in those spheres of love
All of the passion that humanity has brung
And all the wisdom it will bring

R-I-S-E
R-I-S-E
Up a-bove the
Situation
We we elevate you
I won't stop you
You won't need to

(We...)
Where are we now?
(Wooo...)
Where are we now?

R-I-S-E
U-P
A-B-O-V-E
The situation
E-L-E-V-A-T-E
Your mind has stopped
With you, my angel

(Hmm...) (x4)
There is more than one solution
(Hmm...) (x4)
There is more than one solution

Blowing your life
Lose some
Blowing away (yea...)
Blowing away

(Where are we now?)

On and on...
Into cosmic travelling...
