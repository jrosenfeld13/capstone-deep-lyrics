Your house of cards is tumbling all around you
With its feet of clay
And you pretend that it doesn't matter
And that you're not scared
Oh, here comes that day
Oh, here comes the rain on your parade
There's a price to pay
For a life of insincerity
Always smiling, never with a frown on
A mask of hidden tears
Have the courage to say what you mean now
And mean what you say
Oh, here comes that day
Oh, here comes the rain on your parade
There's a price to pay
For a life of insincerity
Here comes that day
Here comes the rain on your parade
You wanted life uncomplicated
Only pleasantries
And like a fool you thought
Life could be cheated of life's realities
Oh, here comes that day
Oh, here comes the rain on your parade
There's a price to pay
For a life of insincerity
Oh, here comes that day
Oh, here comes that rain on your parade
There's a price to pay
For a life of insincerity
Here comes that day
Here comes the rain
Here comes that day
Here comes the rain
Here comes that day
