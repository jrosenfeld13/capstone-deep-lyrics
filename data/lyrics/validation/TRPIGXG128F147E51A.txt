I want to be much more like you
Your effortlessly graceful scene
That drips from every pore of you
Where logic cannot intervene
I want to take a bath with you
And wash the chaos from my skin
I want to fall in love with you
So how do we begin?

I want to be a girl like you
The way you swing your hips in jeans
I want to wear my face like you
Shiseido Mac and Maybelline
I want to paint the town with you
And tickle you until you scream
I want to fall in love with you
I want to say I do
I want to say I do
I want to say I do
I want to say I do
I want to say I do

I want to be much more like you
The way your smile lights up the room
I'll kick back as men flirt with you
To jealousy I'll stay immune
This confidence in me and you
This hope that you and I will bloom
I want to fall in love with you
I want to say I do
I want to say I do
I want to say I do
I want to say I do
I want to say I do

The question is do you?
