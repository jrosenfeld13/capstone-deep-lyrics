When you tire of all the bright lights
Haste that's killing and you're willing to stay home nights
When your feet are back on the solid ground
Look for me, I'll be around

When the new crowd starts to bore you
Just remember there is someone to adore you
When you're weary of nights out on the town
Look for me, I'll be around

May not seem exciting the way those others do
I'm emotion, my devotion
You will need some day as I need you

When the kicks go that it brings you
You will hanker for an anchor just to cling to
When you've lived it up till it's got you down
Look for me, look for me
Look for me, I'll be around
