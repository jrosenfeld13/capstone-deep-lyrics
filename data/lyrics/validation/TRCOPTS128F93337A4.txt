[Verse 1]
Now hold this tight
Don't let go
No burden
I can't forget, the past is real
No longer fight this feeling
No burden
I can't erase what you've become this time

[Chorus]
And I cast doubt (no longer!)
And I am able
I am strong
And now it dwells in me

[Verse 2]
True to this cause, I hunger
I count the days that pass me by
I'll do what I know is right
No failure shall befall me this time

[Chorus] [x2]
And I cast doubt (no longer!)
And I am able
I am strong
And now it dwells in me!

And I cast doubt (no longer!)
And I am able
I am strong
And now it dwells in me!

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
I cast doubt aside
I cast doubt aside
I cast doubt aside (Cast doubt aside)
I cast doubt aside

[Chorus] [x2]
And I cast doubt (no longer!)
And I am able
I am strong
And now it dwells in me

And I cast doubt (no longer!)
And I am able
I am strong
And now it dwells in me

[Outro]
I'm strong and it dwells in me
