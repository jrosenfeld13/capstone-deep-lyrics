I tried to be part of the scene
Bought all the records and magazines
But all the kids they put me down
Laughed and said I was a clown
Said they didn't want me around
Made me feel so all alone

But now I'm back with a bang
I've got my own leather gang
And all of them are men
And denim's back again

And I am, and I am
A Denim Demon
Got my own congregation
I am a saint for seamen
And I am, and I am
A Denim Demon
You've got my penis streaming
And your asshole's screaming "Help!"

The day is black, the night is white
The disco sun it shines so bright
Protruding buttocks left and right
I draw my sword, prepared for a fight
The stench of piss reveals your fright
Your asshole's in for a ride

Outside of society
Good head, good head
