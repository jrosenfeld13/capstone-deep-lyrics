[Verse 1]
Say something else if you mean it
You've got me chasing you again
I'll take it all on the chin in the meantime
You've got me chasing you again

[Chorus 1]
I'm not the one you're waiting for
I'm not the one you're waiting for

[Verse 2]
Wipe off that look from your face in the meantime
You've got me chasing you again
You're always there in my space in the meantime
You've got me chasing you again

[Chorus 1]
I'm not the one you're waiting for
I'm not the one you're waiting for

[Refrain]
I'll never take you out at the weekend
This is the last you'll see of me anyway
I'll never take you out at the weekend
This is the last you'll see of me anyway
I'll never take you out at the weekend
This is the last you'll see of me anyway
I'll never take you out at the weekend
This is the last you'll see of me anyway

[Chorus 2]
I'm not the one you're waiting for
I'm not the one you're waiting for

I'm not the one you're waiting for
I'm not the one you're waiting for
