This knots easy
The very third house
See the light through
Threw out the last ouch
... much wasn't real
Amongst hierarchy fields
Sure we'll travel together
But socialites have beautiful skin

BRAVO, BRAVO
Your forth missed rest
Generations misled
Fantasy island remembers me
Shame for the ordinary (2x)

Global warming upon us
Inspire yourselves position up
Once in a lifetime attempting
You can trust the sun...
Apples don't mean a thing
If they don't mean to me
Although breath is free
It's also free to me

BRAVO BRAVO
Your forth missed rest
Generations misled
Fantasy island remembers me
Shame for the ordinary (2x)

It's about time (8x)

BRAVO, BRAVO
Your forth missed rest
Generations misled
Fantasy island remembers me
Shame for the ordinary (2x)

You can't buy class nor does it wear you
It's something we find in ourselves... issues
Read on far enough create your own
React on insinct
Predict and grow
