Three blocks west
At the edge of the lot
Three brown finches
Know a special spot
Feathers ruffle
To protect slender throats
And there is no wind there
Hey!

Here comes the summer
In a week of rain
Put it in your pocket
All is living again
Here comes to summer
Here comes the sizz-ummer
Here comes the summer
Here comes the summer
