We're dry kid
Theres nothing you've got I want
Are you gonna leave ?
So you keep it locked in
We murder each other each day
Knowing we'd never be
Crowbarred apart

And we try
For so long
To reach eleven
On a scale of one to ten
But we never get so far

Me and you
Should have never left the start
Me and you
Should have never got this far
Me and you
