[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me
(What would you do?)
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular?
(Tell me, would you?)
Well, baby, I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl (like you)
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you
(Saying "I do")  because

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sittin' in the grass, layin' side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love
(So don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love (so don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot, my love
Love, my love, my love

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Now If I wrote you a love note
And made you smile with every word I wrote
(What would you do?)
Would that make you wanna change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team?
(Tell me, would you?)
See, what's the point in waitin' anymore
'Cause girl, I've never been more sure
(That, baby, it's you)
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you been waitin' for
(Just say I do)  because

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sittin' in the grass, layin' side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love
(So don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love (so don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot, my love
Love, my love, my love

[Interlude: T.I.]
It's time to get it, JT
I don't know what she hesitatin' for, man

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Shawty cool as a fan, on the move once again
But he still has fans from Peru to Japan
Listen, baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
'Cause the girls worldwide throw they hands up high
When you wanna come and kick it with a stand-up guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen with a man so fly
And with friends so fly I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle mine
T.I., they call me Candle Guy
Simply 'cause I am on fire
I hate to have to cancel my
Vacation, so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gon' try
You don't come, I ain't gon' die
Hold up, what you mean you can't go? Why?
Me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high
Baby, it's obvious that I ain't yo' guy
I ain't gon' lie, I'll fill your space
And forget your face, I swear I will
St. Barths, Anguilla, anywhere I chill
Just bring with me any pair, I will

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sittin' in the grass, layin' side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love (love)
My love (love)
My love (love)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love (love)
My love (love)
My love (love)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot, my love
Love, my love, my love
