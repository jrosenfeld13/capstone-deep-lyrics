I will twine mid my ringlets of raven black hair
The lilies so pale and the roses so fair
And the myrtle so bright with an emerald hue
The pale amaryllis and violets so blue
I will dance I will sing and my laugh will be gay
I'll cease this wild weeping drive sorrow away
Tho my heart is now breaking, he'll never know
His name made me tremble, my pale cheeks to glow

He told me he loved me and promised to love
Through ill and misfortunes all others above
Now another has won him, oh misery to tell
He left me in silence no word of farewell
He taught me to love him, he called me his flower
That blossomed for him all the brighter each hour
But I awoke from my dreaming, my idol was clay
My visions of love have all faded away

I'll think of him never, I'll be wildly gay
I'll charm every heart and the crowd I will sway
I'll live yet to see him regret the dark hour
He won and neglected the frail wildwood flower
