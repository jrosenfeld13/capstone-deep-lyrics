[Verse 1]
I used to think that I was living big
Bet my money on almost anything
Time and time, I got caught struggling
Oh, I had plans, I had dreams
And I had an open bar policy
Spending time trying to numb the pain
Lost my family just to gain a friend
Oh, strange faces I didn't need

[Chorus]
I'm on a highway
Ain't going no place
Ain't got nowhere to run
I think this deal is done
Traveling going nowhere fast

[Verse 2]
My folks used to tell me
Turner stop and think
Don't waste your whole life
Doing selfish things
Hurting your loved ones
Just to get yourself a stir
There comes a time when
You going to let it be
I thank the Lord
He had his hands on me
Not really thinking
I had sunken deep

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
I'm on a highway
A lonesome byway
You know, I don't know where to start
With changes on my heart
Traveling going nowhere fast[x3]
