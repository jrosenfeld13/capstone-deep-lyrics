[Verse 1]
Keep holding on
When my brain's ticking like a bomb
Guess the black thoughts
Have come again to get me
Sweet bitter words
Unlike nothing I have heard
Sing along, mockingbird
You don't affect me
That's right!
Deliverance of my heart!
Please strike!
Be deliberate!

[Chorus]
Wait, I'm coming undone!
Irate, I'm coming undone!
Too late, I'm coming undone!
What looks so strong, so delicate!
Wait, I'm starting to suffocate!
And soon I anticipate!
I'm coming undone!
What looks so strong, so delicate!

[Verse 2]
Choke, choke again
I thought my demons were my friends
Pity me in the end
They're out to get me
Since I was young
I tasted sorrow on my tongue
And the sweet sugar gun
Does not protect me
That's right!
Trigger between my eyes!
Please strike!
Make it quick now!

[Chorus]
Wait, I'm coming undone!
Irate, I'm coming undone!
Too late, I'm coming undone!
What looks so strong, so delicate!
Wait, I'm starting to suffocate!
And soon I anticipate!
I'm coming undone!
What looks so strong, so delicate!

[Bridge]
I'm trying to hold it together
Head is lighter than a feather
Looks like I'm not getting better
Not getting better

[Chorus]
Wait, I'm coming undone!
Irate, I'm coming undone!
Too late, I'm coming undone!
What looks so strong so, delicate!
Wait, I'm starting to suffocate!
And soon I anticipate!
I'm coming undone!
What looks so strong, so delicate!
