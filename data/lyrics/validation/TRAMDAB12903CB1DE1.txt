FRANKIE: Gimme a "ho" if you got your funky bus fare

KIDS: Ho! Ho! Ho!

FRANKIE:
There's a double dutch bus coming down the street
Moving pretty fast so kinda shuffle your feet (shk-a-shk)
Get on the bus, pay your fare
Then tell the driver that you're going to a Double Dutch Affair
Fe Fi Fo Fum
Well I'll be darned, here it comes
The Double Dutch Bus is on the street
You'd better get off the curb, move your feet

Bus fare trans-pass
That's the way my money lasts
Ain't got no car to get around
When I go to work, I've gotta go downtown
Now I've missed my train, that's a darn shame
When I'm running late, no sleep's to blame
If you've got a wife, you know I'm right
You got a special man? Well, I can understand
Uptown, downtown everybody's getting down
Say uptown, say downtown
Well, I missed my bus I know I'm late
I gotta do something I know I hate
I'm gonna walk to work fifteen blocks
I already got a hole in my socks
Go ahead and laugh that's okay
Cause what I really wanna say
I got bad feet my corns hurt
To top it off I'm late for work
Let me tell you what I say
When I'm dealin' wit a funky sidewalk
Let me show you how I walk
When I gotta do my funky walk
Let me tell you what I say
When I'm dealing wit a funky sidewalk
I say shhhhhhhhhhh-sugarrrrr
