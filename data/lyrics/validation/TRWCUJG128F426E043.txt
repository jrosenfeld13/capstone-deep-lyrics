There is a time to laugh
And a time to cry
And there is a time to accept
And a time to deny

There is a time to be strong
And a time to be weak
And there is a time to listen
And a time we must speak

For everything there's a reason
For everything there's a rhyme
For everything there's a season
For everything there's a time

For everything, everything
Everything there's a time
For everything, everything
Everything there's a time

And there is a time to say hello
And a time to wave goodbye
And there is a time when that we are born
And a time we must die

And there is a time to build up
And a time to tear it down
There is a time to be lost
And a time to be found

Everything there's a reason
For everything there's a rhyme
For everything there's a season
For everything there's a time

For everything, everything
Everything there's a time
For everything, everything
Everything there's a time

One without the other
Is like a king without his kingdom
Everything works together
It all coincides

For everything there's a reason
For everything there's a rhyme
For everything there's a season
For everything there's a time

For everything, everything
Everything there's a time
For everything, everything
Everything there's a time
