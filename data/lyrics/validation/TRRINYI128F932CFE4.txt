He was driving all night riding tail-lights to Texas
In a Ford Galaxy with no lights to see our way
64 to 65 Ford going all the way to Texas
And 2000 miles of trouble in our wake

Well I quit my job at Budget and I went out on the road
I told my mom to shove it, Mom, I'm going to play some rock n roll
Just a nickel in my pocket and a pair of holy tennis shoes
I said a short goodbye to Glendale; I hit the road to Raul's

Well we first broke down in a one horse town in the ex-air zone
It's nothing but a nightmare on the road from there to San Anton'
Feedin' my fingers on the wheel to see if I could feel the ???
We hadn't had a shower and our clothes were just a little bit old

Well I quit my job at Budget and I went out on the road
I told my mom to shove it, Mom, I'm going to play some rock n roll
Just a nickel in my pocket and a pair of holy tennis shoes
I said a short goodbye to Glendale; I hit the road to Raul's

Well we drove on into Austin, just about the break of day
Looking mean and ugly, no one there got in our way
Well we drove to Hell and we lived to tell the tale another day
My Ford was smoking from 29 ??? all the way from to L.A
