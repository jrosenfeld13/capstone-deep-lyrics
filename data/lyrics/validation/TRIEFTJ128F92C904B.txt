There's no highway to luritja way
I listen I listen for it now

There's no turnoff to luritja way
One moment one moment for me please

I'm reaching out for you across a thousand years
I'm reaching out for you

Joining the dots at luritja way
There is something hanging in the breeze

Empty space at luritja way
No richer one picture of discontent

I'm reaching out for you in a valley full of tears
I'm reaching out for you

And I don't want to go home
Gasoline junkies dance stoned
It's better than drinking alone

Oh guiding light you will shine you'll pick me up
You'll hold me up
Oh guiding light you will shine
You will shine on me in eternity

Love is bought and sold
Wobbegong tooth of gold
No one gets to get old

I'm reaching out for you cos I still believe in you
