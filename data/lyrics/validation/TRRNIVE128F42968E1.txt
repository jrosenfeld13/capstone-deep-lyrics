Verse 1
Boy my love is fading
I'm sick and tired of waitin'
Cause...slowly your've been breakin'
Breaking my sprit ohh
Thought I made you happy but
To my susprise you glady
Avoid me with no mention
Baby you got ill intentions

Chours
Cause you don't love me anymore (you don't, you don't)
Oh oh I got ya pullin'
Got ya strechin'
Got ya slowly fadin' away (oh, oh oh)
Cause you don't love me no more
Oh oh I got ya pullin'
Got ya strechin'
Go ya slowly fadin' away okay

Verse 2
Baby you've been tripping
And lately you been slippin' up
Tryin keep up with your rythm
Your leart is like a prison
Thogut we be together
And we be hangin' and kickin' it like forever
To my susprise i'm wrong again
Lord help me to understand

Chours
Cause you don't love me anymore (you don't, you don't)
Oh oh I got ya pullin'
Got ya strechin'
Got ya slowly fadin' away (fadin away)

Time since then has long passed me by
But it's alright
You don't have to worry about me (no,no)
I have cried but since then my tears have dried
And i'm going to be just fine
Livin' one day at a time (a time)

Chours
Cause you don't love me anymore (you don't, you don't)
Oh oh I got ya pullin'
Got ya strechin'
(how could you walk away..baby)Got ya slowly fadin' away
Cause you don't love me no more (but I love you)
Oh oh I got ya pullin'
Got ya strechin' (oh but I want you)
Go ya slowly fadin' away
