There comes a time in the life of every man
When you've got to face reality
Don't you hurt your brother man too much, cos
No man is an island, no man stands alone
Go seek your rights
I don't say you must fight
But if it ever ever comes to the test
You must surely, surely, try try your best, cos
No man is an island, no man stands alone
Look at the branches they are losing their color
Watch them as they grow, Lord, each and every hour
Then if man should fight against man
You must prepare to give a helping hand, Lord
No man is an island, no man stands alone

Go seek your rights, I don't say you must fight
But if it ever ever ever comes to the test
You must surely, surely, surely, try and try your best
Cos
No man is an island, no man stands alone
No man is an island, no man stands alone
No man is an island, no man stands alone
