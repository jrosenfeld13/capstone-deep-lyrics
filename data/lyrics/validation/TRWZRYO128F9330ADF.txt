Hey Dad, you always had your doubts
But this time I am gonna make you proud

[Chorus]
This time, I swear
I'll be a famous star
Live up to my potential
Success is not afar
In future the leader
Here in this great country
Some say I even could be
The pope of Germany

Loud, fast and heavy !
My idols come to town
And I am on the guest list !
Loud, fast and heavy !
Olaf, Gerre, Frank and Andy, you will rule tonight
Later I'll meet you at back-stage
Loud, fast and heavy !
Party time ! To be here is a blast
Hey, Tankard, nice meeting you at last

[Chorus]
Old, lame and stinky ! I can't believe this shit
These guys are square and sobber !
Old, lame and stinky !
All with families, kids and houses, jobs and normal lives
Don't wanna be like you clowns !
Old, lame and stinky !
Know what ? Fame is a stupid farce
You can shine, even if you're no star

[Chorus 2]
This time, I swear
I'll be a famous star
Live up to my potential
Success is not afar
Hot chicks and cars
Much money beer and fun
I know I'll never be like
The Rockstars No. 1

Hey Dad, you always had your doubts
But this time I am gonna make you proud

[Chorus 2]
Hey dad !
