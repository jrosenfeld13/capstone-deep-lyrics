Something about you really puts me down
You're the life of the party you're the toast of the town
Something about you really picks me up
Like a hot cup of coffee in a hot coffee cup
Feels like a Saturday, free and easy going
Reminded its a Sunday, to stop the flow from flowing
You can see clearly now the rain has gone
But it looks like someone's gone and dropped the bomb
Alice what's the matter, Alice what's the matter
Alice what's the matter, Alice what's the matter
Something about her she reminds me of you
Something about him he could be me too
Something about them something about the other
Something I've got to tell you about my dad and your mother
Feels like a Saturday, free and easy going
Reminded its a Sunday, to stop the flow from flowing
You can see clearly now the rain has gone
But it looks like someone's gone and dropped the bomb
Alice what's the matter, Alice what's the matter
Alice what's the matter, Alice what's the matter
Alice what's the matter, Alice what's the matter
Alice what's the matter, Alice what's the matter
Something about black, something about white
Something about wrong, something about right
Something about us, something about them
Something about Bill, definitely something about Ben
Something about you, something about me
Something about a, b, c, d and e
Something about hell, something about heaven
Something about 4, 5, 6 and 7
Alice what's the matter
Alice what's the matter
Alice what's the matter
Alice what's the matter...
