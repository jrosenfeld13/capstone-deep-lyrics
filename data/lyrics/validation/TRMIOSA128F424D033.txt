Oh how I dream
Pictures of the ancient times
The executioner awaits on the stage
In the eyes of the mob
Through which the convicted
Are dragged, scorned
And spat upon

Sinners, soon to confront their fate
Excitement in the air

Lost medieval times?
Former ideals shall be retrieved!
Like me into this body reborn

[Lead: Schalin]

Judge, executioner, all-in-one
I am the chosen one
Justice to be done
Sentenced, no wait
No wait, decapitate
The victim of my hate

[Lead: Schalin, Allenmark]

My name shall be God
Lord of heaven, earthly hell
And whatever is in-between
I reign in my kingdom of death
I judge the living
And the soon to be dead

Sentenced, no wait
No wait, decapitate
The victim of my hate
Lead this lost world through this maze
Refined are my ways
I'm Messiah
To make this world a better place
