For messing with my friends
You will pay
You will be tormented
Forever night and day
The pain
Will be unrelented
You were the one
Who chose to walk away
You are the father of lies
And of pain
You've wrecked so many lives
I'm sure you're proud of your filth
I won't bust you my Father will
You will be thrown in the flames
I have been freed
From the death grip
You can't take me
Down to your grace
You've had your hands
Ripped from my neck
