He's my man, he's my man mountain
He's my lover and dear, oh, to me
He's my man, he's my man mountain, lord
Delivers his soul onto me, lord

Delivers his soul onto me, lord
Delivers his soul onto me

He don't breathe, he don't sleep
He don't even wash his feet
He don't breathe, he don't sleep
He don't even wash his feet

He's my man, he's my man mountain
He's my lover and dear, oh, to me
Oh, I love him, my man mountain, lord
Delivers his soul onto me, lord

Delivers his soul onto me, lord
Delivers his soul onto me

He don't lie
And I don't know why
He told me he loved me and that made me cry

He don't lie
And I don't know why
He told me he loved me and that made me cry

He's my man, he's my man mountain
He's my lover and dear, oh, to me
Oh, I love him, my man mountain, lord
Delivers his soul onto me, lord

Delivers his soul onto me, lord
Delivers his soul onto me

Delivers his soul onto me, lord
Delivers his soul onto me
