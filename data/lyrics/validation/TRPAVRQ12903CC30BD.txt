[Verse 1: Prince]
It's been seven hours and thirteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away

[Verse 2: Rosie Gaines]
Since you been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
Oh yeah
But nothing
I said nothing can take away these blues

[Chorus: Prince & Rosie Gaines]
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

[Verse 3: Prince]
It's been so lonely without you here
I'm like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop this lonely rain from falling
Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong

[Verse 4: Rosie Gaines & Prince]
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor, guess what he told me
What'd he tell you?
Guess what he told me
I'm listening
He said "Rosie!"
What?
"You better try to have fun
No matter what you do"
But he's a fool

[Chorus: Prince & Rosie Gaines]
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

[Saxophone solo]

[Verse 5: Prince & Rosie Gaines]
All the flowers that you planted, sugar
In the backyard
All died when you went away
I know that living with me baby is sometimes hard
Sometimes hard
But I'm willing
I'm willing to give it one more try

[Chorus: Prince & Rosie Gaines]
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
