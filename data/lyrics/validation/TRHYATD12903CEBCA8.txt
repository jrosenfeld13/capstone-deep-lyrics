Well I only call you darling
Cos I know how much it bugs you
And darling, some habits are so hard to break
And if you think that condescension is sexy
Well, that's your mistake to make
So I learned about my power
And learned how not to say it
And I learned that I have things some people need
And no, I know it's not healthy
But it sure beats giving you the lead
If I ever would let down the walls
That protects me from you
I would say respect is due
But not in this lifetime
So maybe I'd have loved you
So maybe if you loved me
And maybe the Easter bunny exists
It's all the same to me now, dear
Yeah, but don't think I don't have those old lists
Now the guns are tired
Shoot bullets in slow motion
And all the soldiers have all gone home
And that's too bad
Cause it was such a nice war, dear
Yeah, but it's time to leave well enough alone
If I ever would let down the walls
That protects me from you
I would say respect is due
But not in this lifetime
Well I only call you darling
Because I really mean it
Don't take my word for it; I wouldn't take yours
And yet I know it's not healthy
Yeah, but it sure beats picking at age-old sores
So bon voyage, my darling
It was real good knowing you
That's French for "have a good trip," if you didn't know
Cause condescension is sexy
And I don't know why, why you wouldn't think so
If I ever would let down the walls
That protects me from you
I would say respect is due
But not in this lifetime
