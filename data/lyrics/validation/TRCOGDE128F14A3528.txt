Walking down familiar alleyways
Trying to get some meaning to my life
People come right up to me and say
Everything is gonna be alright

If you don't know me
You should by now
If you don't love me
I wouldn't want you anyhow
If you don't know me
You should by now
Cause everything is gonna be alright

Walking round the town from place to place
Never knowing if it's day or night
People come right up to me and say
Everything is gonna be alright

If you don't know me
You should by now
If you don't love me
I wouldn't want you anyhow
If you don't know me
You should by now
Cause, everything is gonna be alright

If you don't know me
You should by now
If you don't love me
I wouldn't want you anyhow
If you don't know me
You should by now
Cause, everything is gonna be alright
