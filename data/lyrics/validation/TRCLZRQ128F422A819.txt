Pure resistance, unborn to the fraudulent world
Face revision, the spawn of hate
Forgiveness is distant now

Rising against the origin
I am only one

Scanning the surface with rational eyes
Driving deeper we'll reach our demise
This cannot go on

I can see this world is all alone
I won't be a victim
I can feel the end of all i've known
I won't be a victim

Our world will fall
In the end man will rise and kill all
This can't go on

I am understanding why
All these miles away
I'm not the enemy
