You had gone
And you left me standing there alone again
And the seasons turn and change
The broken clock
And the bitter sweet smell of the wind of change
Not the same here without you

I know I have to keep my head
I know I have to rise above
Though it's so hard

Gonna make it all alone
But since you went away
Time is standing still

The road side
Staring at the lights as ccars go passing by
Hands in pockets kicking cans
I lost you
But I still feel some of the warmth you left here
Tears don't come, wish I could cry

We had some good times and some bad
My memory cuts me like a knife
Shiny and cruel

Gonna make it all alone
But since you went away
Time is standing still

Standing still
But I'm still standing
