Michael Card
Chorus 1
Crown Him, Crown Him, the angry people did cry
Crown Him, Crown Him, let Him be crucified
Crown Him, Crown Him, let Him not remain alive
Crown Him, Crown Him, He must be crucified
So a circle of pain and love
Came down upon His head
It was not for anything He'd done
Or for anything He'd said
For all His life He'd sought to show
They were only living a lie
But they didn't care to hear, Oh no
They just wanted Him to die
Chorus 1
Soon a circle of glory
Will be placed upon His brow
And He'll come to reign forever
Though it may not seem so now
Then our time of tears and trouble
Will seem only like a dream
As we stand before the glory
Of our Savior and our King
Chorus 2
Crown Him, Crown Him
Holy angels sing all Glory honor, power and grace
Crown Him King of Kings
Crown Him, Crown Him, those redeemed and damned
Will bow with me and humbly, sing worthy is the lamb
Repeat Chorus 2
