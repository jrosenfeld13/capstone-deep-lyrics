No books about my decadence
And fables to remember this
I think about it all the time
Andrealize it's vain
I feel like gasoline tonight
Let's dance so close we might catch fire
I can't be honest all the time
I can't be honest all the time

Life is full of promises and prophecies
Well life has made me famous on my knees
And everywhere there's amateurs and enemies
Everywhere there's everyone but me

She said you'll be fine
I promise that I'll leave on the light
What are you afraid of?
What are you afraid of?

I advertise my memories
Low and behold humanity
I condescend your sympathy
Can understand my pain
I can only hope this melody
Will scream across like clarity
I can't be honest all the time
I can't be honest all the time

People say the army's got a home for me
To find myself out of this rut
And maybe greatness isn't in my destiny
'Sides people say a lot of things so what?

She said you'll be fine
I promise that I'll leave on the light
What are you afraid of?
What are you afraid of?

That alcohol is heavier than lead
And Hunter S. Thompson is dead
She said you'll never have enough
Until the day that you wake up
And everything is gone
Oh everything is gone

I advertise my memories
Low and behold humanity
I condescend your sympathy
Can understand my pain
I can only hope this melody
Will scream across like clarity
I can't be honest all the time
I can't be honest all the time

She said you'll be fine
I promise that I'll leave on the light
What are you afraid of?
What are you afraid of?

That alcohol is heavier than lead
And Hunter S. Thompson is dead
She said you'll never have enough
Until the day that you wake up
And everything is gone
Oh everything is gone
