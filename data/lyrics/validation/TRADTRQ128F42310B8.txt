The beginning of sorrow has come
You cannot build but can destroy with what is left on earth
Damage, now permanent, is yet enhanced day by day by unstoppable greed
You are never truly happy unless one suffers more than yourself
The choice is none, you will live in a world where you must fight a battle
Some weaker, some stronger, in termination we'll die as one
We fight amongst ourselves, enhanced by racial difference
Our hatred never to diminish, it's just growing and growing 'till
Out day of release
We race towards the years of tribulation, where wars, plagues and
The antichrist

What is the antichrist?
What is it's form?
Questions still asked yet unanswered
No need for answers, with it's arrival brings sorrow, a sorrow soon
Dealt upon all

Perhaps it's a pestilence in a form of virus spreading in it's own
Epidemic
Perhaps it is famine killing off millions
Does this happen cause we lack enough food

One man's greed affects others less privileged, a cruel form of
Population control
Why does this happen?
It is predestined fate not open for reason or change
It's all been predicted, we'll die in vast numbers of a sickness
That has no known cure
We'll play the unknowing yet all are aware tribulation is here now
For sure
