For your love, I would do anything
I would do anything, for your love, oh
For your kiss, baby, baby, I would go anywhere
I would go anywhere, for your kiss

More foolish I grow, with each heart beat
But we, we all get foolish and that's why I repeat
For your love, I would do anything
I would do anything, for your love, love
