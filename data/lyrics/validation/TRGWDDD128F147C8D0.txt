Here's a note from one miss turnbull
Certain homework was not done
Tiny holes in brand new windows
From an unknown bb gun
Cinder annie and your big mommie
Say the facts all point to you

But they don't love you
Little kawai
Not the way that I do
Not the way that I do

That new squirt gun
Eric got you
Don't you aim it over here
That's a mean song eldon taught you
I no longer wish to hear
And where he says babies come from
This is not completely true

That's a tall one
Little kawai
And those bad boys
They don't love you
Not the way that I do

In the morning in spite of everything
We'll go driving in our car
Straight to ihop where it's well-known
The world's junkest pancakes are
Maple syrup on those french fries
They say it's no good for you

But you're still growing
Little kawai
What do they know
Do they love you
Not the way that I do
Not the way that I do
