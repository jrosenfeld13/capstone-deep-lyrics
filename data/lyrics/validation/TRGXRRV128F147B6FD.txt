Love hurts, love scars
Love wounds and mars
Any heart not tough
Nor strong enough
To take a lot of pain
Take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud
Holds a lot of rain

Love hurts
Mmm-mm, love hurts

I'm young, I know
But even so
I know a thing or two
I've learned from you
I've really learned a lot
Really learned a lot
Love is like a stove
Burns you when it's hot
Love hurts
Mmm-mm, love hurts

Some fools think of happiness
Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves, I guess
But they're not fooling me

I know it isn't true
Know it isn't true
Love is just a lie
Made to make you blue

Love hurts
Mmm-mm, love hurts

Love hurts
Mmm-mm, love hurts
Oh-oh, love hurts
