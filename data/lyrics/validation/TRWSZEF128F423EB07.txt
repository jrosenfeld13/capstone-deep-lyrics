( Pretty Deep EP Part 2 )

You say you alone can love me
Give me the reason you do
If it's the right reason to know me
If you love me

I'll ride a camel to you

Heaven is
Heaven is
Heavy these days

Heavy with
Heavy with
Uninvited saints

Now bats fly to this ribcage
This ribcage

My bad form ended strange

My bad form ended strange

You say you alone can save me
Give me the reason it's true
If you see the true face of my jailor
And you save her too

I'll walk on razors to you

Heaven is
Heaven is
Heavy these days

Heavy with
Heavy with
Cross-fingered saints

Now bats fly to this ribcage
This ribcage

My bad form ended strange

My bad form ended strange

My bad form ended strange
