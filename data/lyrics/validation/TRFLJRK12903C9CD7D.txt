Well, your head's down
You've turned around
Everybody knows what's goin' down
And you sit there, ugh, ugh, ugh, oh

With your hands tied
Around your drink
The longer you go
The farther you sink
But you sit there

Waiting for the world to change
And it's your life and you are
So what are you waiting for?
Do you want me here for you?
What are you waiting for?

I think you want me to
Take you by the hand
And show you what to do
What are you waiting for?
Another lame excuse?

As you drag on your cigarette
Trying to figure out how things got bad
And you're drinkin' again from the outside
It's plain to see, but the spirits in here
Won't let you be what you're missing

Waitin' for the world to change
And it's your life and you are
So what are you waiting for
Do you want me here for you?
What are you waiting for?

I think you want me to
Take you by the hand
And show you what to do
What are you waiting for?
Another lame excuse?

Just try to separate yourself from this end
'Cause look around and extend your hand
Forget about the same old thoughts
In your head, it's not too late

So what are you waiting for?
Do you want me here for you?
What are you waiting for?
Another lame excuse?

So what are you waiting for?
Do you want me here for you?
What are you waiting for?

I think you want me to
Take you by the hand
And show you what to do
What are you waiting for?
Another lame excuse?

What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
