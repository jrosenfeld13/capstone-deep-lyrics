If they call me for me and wonder where I am
Just tell them I'm not feeling good today
If they don't believe you, I don't give a damn
Because i just might pick up the phone and said:

I'm just putting in a little bit of over time at home
I'll be putting in a little bit of over time at home
If there is anything on earth I feel for me to do
It's stay at home from work today and play a while with you
Today just let the world leave us alone
Because I'm putting in a little bit of over time at home

Every day they get ten hours of my time
And I bring home to you what's left of me
With an akin body and a weary mind
But today that ain't no way is gonna do

Because just putting in a little bit of over time at home
I'll be putting in a little bit of over time at home
If there is anything on earth I feel for me to do
It's stay at home from work today and play a while with you
Today just let the world leave us alone
