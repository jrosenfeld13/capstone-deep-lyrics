Sha la la la (x2)
Just because you accepted
The moment that I asked you to be my girl
Sha la la la (x2)
I didn't believe that you could fall in love at first sight
I didn't think that you were a very nice girl
But I was wrong (that was wrong)
Oooh, I was wrong (so, so wrong)
I was wrong (that was wrong)
I misjudged you, ooh (misjudged you, baby)

You didn't hesitate
Because you didn't want to wait
You didn't know if I would ever ask you again
Sha la la la (x2)
You should have played hard
Right from the start
Cause I condemned you for being so extreme
But that was wrong (that was wrong)
Ooh, that it was wrong (so, so wrong)
Ohh, it was wrong (that was wrong)
I misjudged you (ohh, baby, I misjudged you baby)

So now I'm begging
For the love I once denied
Darling, I'm sorry
Arrest these tears that are falling in my eyes

So if you give me one more chance
I promise I will never doubt you again
Sha la la la (x2)
I want you to say each and every day
Remind me dear
Don't care where or when
That I wronged you (that was wrong)
Oooh, I wronged you (so, so wrong, ohh, baby, don't you know that)
I wronged you (that was wrong)
I misjudged you (hey baby, I misjudged, misjudged, I misjudged you)
I misjudged you (hey baby)
I misjudged you
I misjudged you, girl
