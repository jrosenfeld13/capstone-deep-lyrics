I decline your words of wisdom
Stop spitting your views in my face
A cancer eating freedom
All values lost without a trace

Close, so close but yet so far away
- You breed on hate and prejudice
Entangled in your web of lies
- Malevolent scum!
So close, so close but stay out of my way!
- Your breed of hate I will dismiss
Disgusted my anger will rise

I object to your senseless oppression
Shocked by the deeds you do
You're enslaved to a mental regression
In fear that they're equal with you

Close, so close but yet so far away
- You breed on hate and prejudice
Entangled in your web of lies
- Malevolent scum!
So close, so close but stay out of my way!
- Your breed of hate I will dismiss
Disgusted my anger will rise

You're red and white - you think you're strong
You're only white - right is wrong

Wake up and smell the cancer
You reek of shit!
Always there with no good answer
Now here's my spit
