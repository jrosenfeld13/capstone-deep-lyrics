[Verse 1]
Everything she says to me means nothing
Even words of sympathy mean nothing
I'm feeling down and I hate the sound of nothing
What's the point in hanging round for nothing?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't remember falling in love with you
This is agony
And you know you're putting me through

[Chorus]
This misery taking every memory
Just tell me why this misery won't go away
How can we carry on this way?

[Verse 2]
I find it hard to hold a conversation
And being with her is just an aggravation
I could stay but I haven't got the patience
I'm sick of her pathetic explanations

[Pre-Chorus 2]
That's why I've forgotten falling in love with you
This is agony
And you know you're putting me through

[Chorus]
This misery taking every memory
Just tell me why this misery won't go away
How can we carry on this way?

[Bridge]
You'll never bring me down
'Cause I'm so far above you
You think you're strong
But you're nothing to me now
And I hope you will be happy
This time around

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I can't remember falling in love with you
This is agony
Do you know you're putting me through

[Chorus]
This misery taking every memory
Just tell me why this misery won't go away
How can we carry on this way?
