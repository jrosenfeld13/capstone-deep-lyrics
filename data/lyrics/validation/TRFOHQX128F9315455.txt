I know what you're thinking
Even when you don't
Bent up and broken down
Lying on gravel by the side of the road

People
Like to live their lives with eyes closed
I'll take your blinders off
And step out into the night

You've got something
That i can't explain
Don't know what i want
I only what i need

I'll take you out of this place
Away from the sun
Lay down
And look up at the stars

People
Have no idea what's going on
We'll leave them in the dark
They're happier that way
