You can fool yourself
I promise it will help
Now every single day
I just wanna hear you saying

Laughing through the day
Thinking you are never boring
Speeding through the night
Maybe you not count the morning

There's nothing you can do
To keep it out
There's nothing you can do
Just scream and shout

Living for today but you just can't find tomorrow
Talking 'bout the joy
But it never stops the sorrow

There's nothing you can do
To keep it out
There's nothing you can do
Just scream and shout
Saying

I'm
So lucky lucky
I'm
So lucky lucky
I'm
So lovely lovely
I'm
So lovely lovely

You can fool yourself
I promise it will help
Now every single day
I just wanna hear you saying

I'm
So lucky lucky
I'm
So lucky lucky
I'm
So lovely lovely
I'm
So lovely lovely

You can fool yourself
I promise it will help
Now every single day
I just wanna hear you saying

Even though you said
It would never end it's over
You were smiling on my arm
Now you're crying on my shoulder

There's nothing you can do
To keep it out
There's nothing you can do
Just scream and shout
Saying

I'm
So lucky lucky
I'm
So lucky lucky
I'm
So lovely lovely
I'm
So lovely lovely

You can fool yourself
I promise it will help
Now every single day
I just wanna hear you saying

I'm
So lucky lucky
I'm
So lucky lucky
I'm
So lovely lovely
I'm
So lovely lovely

You can fool yourself
I promise it will help
Now every single day
I just wanna hear you saying

You can never be forever
Good together
Young and clever
You can never be forever
But keep it up
Don't ever stop
Through night and day
The words to say are:

I'm
So lucky lucky
I'm
So lucky lucky
I'm
So lovely lovely
I'm
So lovely lovely

You can fool yourself
I promise it will help
Now every single day
I just wanna hear you saying

You can fool yourself
I promise it will help
Now every single day
I just wanna hear you saying

I'm
So lucky lucky
I'm
So lucky lucky
I'm
So lovely lovely
I'm
So lovely lovely

You can fool yourself
I promise it will help
Now every single day
I just wanna hear you saying

You can fool yourself
I promise it will help
Now every single day
I just wanna hear you saying
