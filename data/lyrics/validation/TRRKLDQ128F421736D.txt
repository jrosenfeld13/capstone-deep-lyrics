Well, I standing quiet, alone in a - crowded disco
When a man I did not know - showed me the door
And told me I had to go
Well, that kind of humiliation never happens on farm
That's why - city livin' does the pysche such harm
And I said

Fire escapes don't work - until there's a fire
You gotta sleep on the floor
Live in the mud
There's no need to go higher
Once you taste a brick - you won't want more
Saving sanity's no trick when your livin' - outdoors

Well, it did not take me long to realise my mistake
When garbage trucks messed up my dreams I knew my dreams were fake
I don't know how people - gonna live like this
Pigeons might enjoy it but I - can't live in this mess
And I said

Fire escapes don't work until there's a fire
You gotta sleep on the floor
Live in the mud
There's no need to go higher
Once you taste a brick - you can't chew and talk
Saving sanity's a trick when your livin' in a room the size of a shoebox

So, finally all the wires - and plastic got to me
Ideas and realisations were passing right through me
I did not take a train - a plane or bus with wings
Man wasn't meant to fly
Besides walkin' does the same thing: gets me outta here

Fire escapes don't work until there's a fire
You gotta sleep on the floor
Live in the mud
There's no need to go higher
Once you taste a brick - you won't want more
Saving sanity's a trick when you livin' on someone elses floor
