[Verse 1: Jason Mraz]
Did you get my message, the one I left
While I was trying to condense everything
That I meant in a minute or less when I called to confess
And make all of my stresses go bye-bye?

[Verse 2: Rachel Yamagata]
Did you get my message? You did not guess
'cuz if you did you would have called me with your sweet intent
And we could give it a rest
'stead of beating my breast
Making all of the pressure go sky-high

[Verse 3: Jason Mraz]
Do you ever wonder what happens to the words that we send?
Do they bend, do they break from the flight that they take
And come back together again with a whole new meaning
In a brand new sense, completely unrelated to the one I sent?

[Chorus]
Did you get my message? oooh oooh ooooh
Did you get my message? oooh oooh ooooh
Did you get my message? yeah, oooh oooh ooooh hooo

[Verse 4: Jason Mraz]
Uh oh, where did it go? Must have bypassed your phone
And flown right outta the window

[Rachel Yamagata]
Oh well, how can I tell?
Should I call the operator?

[Jason Mraz]
Or maybe she know the info
On whether or not my message you got was too much or a lot to reply

[Rachel Yamagata]
Why not try this for a fact?

[Jason Mraz]
Should you ever call back I'd relax and be relieved
Of all my panic attacks

[Chorus]
Did you get my message? oooh oooh ooooh
Did you get my message? oooh oooh ooooh
Did you get my message? yeah, oooh oooh ooooh hooo

[Verse 5: Jason Mraz]
Did you get my message, the one that I left
While I was trying to condense everything that I meant?

[Rachel Yamagata]
Now the moment is passed

[Verse 6: Jason Mraz]
Not much sand in the glass and I'm standing to lose my mind
Do you ever wonder what happens to the words that we send?
Do they bend, do they break from the flight that they take
And come back together again with a whole new meaning
To the matter of our love's defense?
And please be sympathetic to the time I spent

[Chorus]
Did you get my message? oooh oooh ooooh
Did you get my message? oooh oooh ooooh
Did you get my message? yeah, oooh oooh ooooh hooo

[Verse 7]
[Rachel] no I didn't hear a word you said
[Jason] Did you get my message?
[Rachel] no I'm not gonna believe your lies anymore
Did you get my message that I want to reconnect with you
Did you get my message
[Rachel] I can hear you say your coming but I don't hear
Why did you get the message love ?
That I want to get back with you
Did you get my message love
That I want to reconnect with you
Why did you get the message love ?
Did you get my message
[Rachel and Jason] That I want to reconnect with you
