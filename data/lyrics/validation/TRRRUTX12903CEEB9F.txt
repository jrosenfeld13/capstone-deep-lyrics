Mine is the seventh
Yes I'm divine
I roam the heavens
And I survive
Unleash the spirits
Litter the skies
Old world in ruins
I'll be your guide...

Conjure the demon
Let dragons fly
Mislead the children
Comfort the blind
Lets meet the Maker
Do take your time
This cup so bitter
See how we shine

And in a blaze we go
The stars will show
No compromises
And you and I will know
This powershow
New sky arises

Watch me deliver
Always on time
Mislead the children
Light up the sky
Cold-blooded fathers
Cold-hearted sons
Call on the wizard
It has begun

I blind the sun
