Still waiting for my ship to come in
Still looking for the right kinda friend
There are things inside things that can't be denied
What am I waiting for

A sleeping beauty, so helpless
Unlock my fantasy
And while i slept
You came in
And gave to me your key oh your key

Things that we did again and again
Things that I thought would never never end
There are things inside things that can't be denied
What am I waiting for

A sleeping beauty, I confess
A perfect design
And while i slept
You came in
And took this heart of mine
A sleeping beauty, so helpless
Unlock my fantasy
And while i slept
You came in
And gave to me your key oh your key

I looked around I saw your face
Then I kissed you in a very nice place
What was I looking for
Still waiting, still waiting, still waiting
Waiting waiting for you
Ooh baby
I'm still rootin' for you honey

You showed me how to give
This selfish heart of mine

Oh a sleeping beauty, so helpless
Unlock my fantasy
And while i slept
You came in
And gave to me your key oh your key
A sleeping beauty, so helpless
Unlock my fantasy
And while i slept
You came in
And gave to me your key oh your key
Still waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
