I'm the digital monkey
Suply the frequencies and beat the rhythm
That's funky, I come from middle east
But don't belong to no country
I jump from tree to tree
Put my track on cd with the bbb

All the ladies in the place make me feel s***
I got the style you won't get the taxi
I judge your style you get the flash to the fancy
Will sleep to the lancy I'm the monkey on the mc

I smoke the lala were gonna take it hal'a az smoke shachta ve yalla
The highest on the skala ve lala la la la la li li li
So bring the dance and leave the guns and take it
I follow the way to Washington dc

(You know digital monkey style)

Dropin the beat and keep it mobile
Stright from the hip I come I'm like an x file
You die pick it up we dance before we say bye bye

(Woohoo it's the digital monkey style
We pick it up we pick it up we pick it up)

Pick it up now shake it down now
Your guns and I'll will come (Hey)
Pick it up now shake it down now
Here we come were dropin the bomb
We bring balagan were dropin the gun
Lets get to be done with fun (Oh)
Sick of the tounge people are numb
Makom le kulam here we come
Pick it up now shake it down now
Your guns and I'll will come (Hey)
Pick it up now shake it down now
Here we come were dropin the bomb
We bring balagan were dropin the gun
Lets get to be done with fun (Oh)
Sick of the tounge people are numb
Makom le kulam here we come

(I know the Digital monkey style
Pick it up now
Pick it up now
Pick it up now
Pick it up now
Pick it up now
Shake it down now
Shake it down now
Shake it down now
Yes yes yes yes yes yes)
