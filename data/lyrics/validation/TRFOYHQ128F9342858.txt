You like to cheat and make me blue
I like to do the same to you
We're too much alike to like each other
Like we used to do (like we used to do)
I like to go out and romp and stomp
You like to go to parties and those honky tonks
We're too much alike to like each other
Like we used to do (like we used to do)
I like the way we used to love, but we have changed somehow
We'd see each other all the time, like we should do now
You like to say that I'm to blame
I'd like to say that you're the same
We're too much alike to like each other
Like we used to do (like we used to do)
