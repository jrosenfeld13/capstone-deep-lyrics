Me and this girl we've been falling in love
Beneath a quarter moon beneath a quarter moon
Me and this girl I've been living above
On a road called Oppenheimer

Tar on the roof there were stars in her hair
Beneath a quarter moon beneath a quarter moon
Me and this girl we were going somewhere
On a road called Oppenheimer

Me and this girl we've been working it out
We've got a long way to go we've got a long way to go
Me and this girl we've been having it out
On a road called Oppenheimer

Me and this girl we've been getting it on
Beneath a quarter moon beneath a quarter moon
Watching it go until its all the way gone
On a road called Oppenheimer

And the days gonna be today
And the time is gonna be right now
No I'm never gone fall for anyone else but her
And the place is gonna be right here
On a road called Oppenheimer Oppenheimer

Me and this girl we been falling in love
Beneath a quarter moon beneath a quarter moon
Me and this girl I've been dreaming above
On a road called Oppenheimer

Tar on the roof there were stars in her hair
Beneath a quarter moon beneath a quarter moon
Me and this girl we were going somewhere
On a road called Oppenheimer

And the days gonna be today
And the time is gonna be right now
No I'm never gone fall for anyone else but her
And the place is gonna be right here
On a road called Oppenheimer Oppenheimer

Oppenheimer
Oppenheimer

Me and this girl we've been working it out
We've got a long way to go we've got a long way to go
