I want to take the bullet
The one aimed straight for your heart
I want to meet the wolves halfway
And let them tear me apart
That's not the way they do it here

I want to lay on the tracks
Feel hot steel screaming at me
Expose the bones on my back
Let me show you what I mean
Yeah it's a different kind of love
I want to climb barbed wire fences
And warm our hands in blood

And this is my gift
Asking you to fix
My ruined hands
And it's a gift that keeps on giving
It's a gift that keeps on giving
It's a gift that keeps on giving
And right now it's all I have to give

I want to lay on the tracks
Feel hot steel screaming at me
Expose the bones on my back
Let me show you what I mean

I want to write the perfect song
And play it just for you
While you are tangled up in sleep
I need you more than I'll ever know
Until I stop breathing
My lungs will take you for granted
