If I took my life away in vain for sympathy
If I did it for me and you
If I did it for you and I
Would you cry for me ?

Take a schizophrenic chance and dance with a laugh on the sea
Would you get wet for me ?
Be in debt to me ?
Would you cry for me ?
Would you cry for me ?

On my own
Got no one to watch me die, all alone
Got no one 'cause I'm too shy, all alone

Would you cry for me ?

If I took my life away to make you look and see
Would you cry aloud ?
Would you laugh aloud ?
Come on, cry for me
Cry, cry, cry, said cry

If I took my life away in vain for sympathy
If I did it for me and you
If I did it for you and I

Take a schizophrenic chance and dance with a laugh on the sea
Would you get wet for me ?
Be in debt to me ?
Would you cry for me ?
Would you cry for me ?
Would you cry for me ?

(Would you cry ?) would you cry for me ?
(Would you cry ?) would you cry for me ?

Would you cry for me ?
