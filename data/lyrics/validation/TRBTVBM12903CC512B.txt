Embrace me, a little longer my sweet
Embrace me, and see if you won't ever leave
Your goodbyes seem so unfair; so unkind
Embrace me for my dreams
Caress me, make this moment forever last
And tell me, "troubled times have past."
Another day goes by; this longing is all I have...
Embrace me for my dreams
Bu-bu-buuuu...
Embrace me, a little longer my sweet
Embrace me, and see if you won't ever leave
Your goodbyes seem so unfair; so unkind
Embrace me for my dreams
Caress me, make this moment forever last
And tell me, "troubled times have past."
Another day goes by; this longing is all I have...
Embrace me...for my dreams
