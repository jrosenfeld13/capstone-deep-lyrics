Was a fast tough woman, loved to play the clown
You won't do nothin' about it
Break a good boy's resistance down
Know she's got a pistol
Laid it down on me
She said shoot shoot, shoot it boy
You gotta shoot it for me
Trust me like she was worth it
Never knew I was her kill
And two forty five's would do the trick and pay the bills
Know she's got a pistol
Laid it down on me
And she said shoot shoot, shoot it boy
You gotta shoot it for me
I've really got to get a fast ride out of here
Gotta get a fast ride out of here
Gotta get a fast ride out of here
Gotta get a fast ride out of here
Holdin' out in my hotel room
Police they finally come
Had her as the prosecution
And my prints upon the gun
Know she's got a pistol
Laid it down on me
And she said shoot shoot, shoot it boy
Shoot it for me
I've really got to get a fast ride out of here
Gotta get a fast ride out of here
Gotta get a fast ride out of here
Gotta get a fast ride out of here now
