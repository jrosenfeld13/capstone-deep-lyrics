Uh, uh, uh
Sometimes I feel like I can touch the sky with you
No one has ever made me feel so high like you do
But when you get angry, you get so scary
You say things just to put me down, down, down
Dont know how much more I can take from you!

Chorus:
Boy, dont you know, I love you so
But you dont have to take it out on me
I said Ill be there, you know I care
You dont have to take it out on me
Whatever youre going through
I will stand by you
But you cant keep tearing me down, down
You could be mad at the world, but dont take it out on me!
I may not been perfect, but Ive been good to you
Oh, oh, oh
And you may not deserve it, the mercy my heart seems to have for you
You take me for granted, you know I cant stand it
When you see anything to tear me down
Oh, oh, what can I say to you?

Chorus:
Boy, dont you know, I love you so
But you dont have to take it out on me
I said Ill be there, you know I care
You dont have to take it out on me
Whatever youre going through
I will stand by you
But you cant keep tearing me down, down
You could be mad at the world, but dont take it out on me!
I need you and I love you
If I have to, I will leave you
Dont you see whats doing to me?
Its gotta change!

Chorus: (x2)
Boy, dont you know, I love you so
But you dont have to take it out on me
I said Ill be there, you know I care
You dont have to take it out on me
Whatever youre going through
I will stand by you
But you cant keep tearing me down, down
You could be mad at the world, but dont take it out on me!
