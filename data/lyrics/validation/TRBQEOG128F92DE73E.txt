Now I'm standing at the start
This old dirt road and my ravaged heart
Are all that's left, unless I'm dreaming
I've come so far, this familiar fear
If pain is gold then I'm a millionaire
Your sordid theft won't make things even
My suit has turned from black to brown
I've swam through dust and I've been smacked around
The hand of lust does love misleading
But these squinting eyes have seen
The slow demise and the rise upstream
To know the end is near is freedom

Muscles ache, I feel old and blind
The cowhide's warm but I'm cold in mine
The blazing sun is gone, it's freezing
A pair of aces and a pair of eights
My fate is sealed but I'm prepared to wait
Just one more deal before I'm leaving
My shoes and hurt both custom made
I stare into the face on this rusted blade
And don't have much left to believe in
Can't feel my skin from behind the scars
I raise my head just to find the stars
They must be there, I just can't see them

I guess there's no use trying to talk
What tongues have tied, only eyes resolve
These two have seen their share of weeping
More moons have passed than I would care to know
From when I last knew why and where to go
This wounded country won't stop breathing
No flying sparks, just a burning fuse
No greater loss a man could learn to lose
I tried to leave but who was I deceiving
Now I'm standing at the start
This old dirt road and my ravaged heart
Will soon be gone if I'm just dreaming
