Lead on
To keep our feelings strong
And make me still believe
Our page is one and the same
Our ways will separate tonight

You say if we were to wait
Some things just might be changed
I say that I don't have the strength
To fuel a burning flame
Speak to me
What can I say, we just live too far away
That's a shame that love can make you stay

Sweet thing
I hope that you know I'm wondering where you are
You say this could work someday
When you and I both know this is the end

Leave me the way it has to be
Excuse my poor excuse
Tell me that insecurities
Are what drove me to you
And everyday I compare your face
From sweet beginnings to your bitter end

Sweet thing
I hope that you know I'm wondering where you are
You say this could work someday
When you and I both know this is the end
Let me let go

Sweet thing
I hope that you know I'm wondering where you are
You say this could work someday
When you and I both know this is the end
