You know, Baby, when you're in my arms
I can feel your loving magic charms
You drive me crazy, you drive me crazy
And when I'm looking in those big blue eyes
I start a'floating round in paradise
You drive me crazy, you drive me crazy
Heaven must have sent you down
Down for you to give me a thrill
Ev'ry time you touch me
Ev'ry time you hold me
My heart starts speeding like a train on a track
I love you, Baby, and it's plain to see
I love you, honey, it was meant to be
You drive me crazy, you drive me crazy, oh

Heaven must have sent you down
Down for you to give me a thrill
Ev'ry time you touch me
Ev'ry time you hold me
My heart starts speeding like a train on a track
I love you, Baby, and it's plain to see
I love you, honey, it was meant to be
You drive me crazy, you drive me crazy

And when I'm looking in those big blue eyes
I start a'floating round in paradise
You drive me crazy, you drive me crazy

You drive me crazy, you drive me crazy, oh
You drive me crazy, you drive me crazy, oh
You drive me crazy, you drive me crazy, oh
