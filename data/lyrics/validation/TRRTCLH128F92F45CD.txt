She came up to me and she said

Catch you later, baby, I gotta split
I got a habit, I just can't quit
Catch you later, baby, I gotta split
I got a habit, I just can't quit

Just biting my nails
Just biting my nails
Just biting my nails
Just biting my nails

Sound system plays a Renegade tune
Pretty woman and a big full moon
A handsome man, look, a diamond ring
How he wishes he had that thing

Just biting my nails
Just biting my nails
Just biting my nails
Just biting my nails

He's got a finger in her painted lips
Oh he's got a hand upon her African hips
So give me money for adventures, honey, not this time
I've gotta habit, and it's all mine

Just biting my nails
Just biting my nails
Just biting my nails
Just biting my nails

A fanfare played, feeling great
Put a shine on your shoes
Does it have to end
Our guest of honour, it's you
I'll take you back
My diction's hit for a four
I will recover
I'll even come back for more

Just biting my nails
Just biting my nails
Just biting my nails
Just biting my nails

Get on my case
The guitar breaks
She's got a devils tattoo
It's playing live
Let's take a drive
And push the volumes up high
Can't hear no bass
But I catch you face
And it's inline with mine
All around the world
A sexual term
So let's turn off the light

I'm gonna
I'm gonna
I'm gonna
I'm gonna
I'm gonna
I'm gonna
I'm gonna
I'm gonna

Give it up
Put me down

I want long nails, honey, so I can scratch your back
