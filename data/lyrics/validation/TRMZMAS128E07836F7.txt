[Verse 1]
And I'm not the judge or the referee
And I can't accept, 'cause I am uptight
And the smoke's getting into my eyes are burning
My concern is I just might give you my life
And I can't relate to the hypnotist
And I can't get close, 'cause the plastic wrap
And I want to have kids, but their father's up inside the clouds
The distance between is on my mind

[Chorus]
Up until now things have been fine, temporarily
You're cute but the circumstance has changed
Your substitution method, crutch
Your whole protection from your pain
This presentation of my ploy
Is to change my cellophane boy

[Verse 2]
It's not the 70's
Let your future fly with me

[Chorus]

[Outro]
And I want your habit to be me
Your harbor and your refugee
