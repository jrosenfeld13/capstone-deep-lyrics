So, what can I say but thank you, dear
For sharing the few things you have
Oh, I'd like to say, I'm glad you're here
And hope my leaving is not sad
Soon I'll have to go, get back on the road
Then I'll have no reason left at all

In times it's hard to say the things I feel
To wonder while I've known so long
Oh, you still remain so sure and real
Ev'rything is going wrong
But soon I'll have to go, get back on the road
Then I'll have no reason left at all

Oh, have you somethin' to say, say it for me, please
Oh, have you somethin' to say, say it before I leave
Oh, have you somethin' to say, say it from your heart
Oh, have you somethin' to say, say it before I part

So, what can I say but thank you, dear
For sharing the few things you have
Oh, I'd like to say, I'm glad you're here
And hope my leaving is not sad
Yeah, soon I'll have to go, get back on the road
Then I'll have no reason left at all

Oh, have you somethin' to say, say it for me, please
Oh, have you somethin' to say, say it before I leave
Oh, have you somethin' to say, say it from your heart
Oh, have you somethin' to say, say it before I part ....

Oh, have you somethin' to say
Oh, have you somethin' to say
Oh, have you somethin' to say
