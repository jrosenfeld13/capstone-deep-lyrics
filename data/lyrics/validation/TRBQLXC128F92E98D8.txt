Once bit, twice shy
Just the average kind of guy
Loved and lost felt the pain
The need to start all over again
Heart broken, on the mend
The loss of that special friend
The look and feel of despair
War and love where it's all fair
You just want a place to hide, (place to hide)
Don't show the hurt you feel inside
Keep your feelings bottled up, (bottled up)
An abandoned ship you won't give up

Sing me a love song
Song of pain
Sing me a love song, (sing a song of pain)
They're one in the same, yeah

Started young and innocent
All the good times that were spent
Soft caress and sweet perfume
A hopeless love on its way to doom
In time you grow apart
Feel the anguish of a broken heart
Caught in a love that didn't last
Cleanse yourself of the past
You just have to let it go, (let it go)
Try not to let your feelings show
You don't know where you went wrong, (where you went wrong)
Experience will make you strong

A love song
Song of pain

Sing me a love song
A song of pain, (sing a song of love)
Sing me a love song, (sing a song of pain)
Song of pain

Time passes, your heart grows cold
To the echo of the old
In with the new, on to the next
Love can be so complex
Once bit, twice shy
Just the average kind of guy
Loved and lost, felt the pain
The need to start all over again
You just have to let it go, (let it go)
Find someone new and let love grow
Seize the moment, don't take too long, (don't take too long)
Experience will make you strong

Sing me a love song
A song of pain
Sing me a love song
Extinguish the flame, (sing a song of love)
Sing me a love song, (sing a song of pain)
A song of pain, (sing a song of love)
Sing me a love song, (sing a song of pain)
Relinquish the blame
