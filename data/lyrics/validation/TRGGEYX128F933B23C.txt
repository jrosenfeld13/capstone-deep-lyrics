[Verse 1]
A certain man one day did go down to Jericho
Fallin' among thieves along the way
Well they stripped him then they fled
Leaving him for dead
Lying on the side of the road
And then the priest came passing by
He crossed over to the other side
Then the Levite came and he did just the same
When the Samaritan heard his cry
He just could not pass on by
He dressed his wounds and he carried to the nearest inn

[Chorus]
Well he reached down, he reached down
He got right there on the ground
He reached down, he reached down
And he touched the pain

[Verse 2]
He paid the keeper the amount that was due
If you need more he said I'm good for that too
He reached down, he reached down
And he touched the pain
And then the Scribes in the Pharicese
Brought the adultress in for Jesus to see
Lord, she's sinned, now the law says she must be stoned
If there's a one of you that's without sin
Said you can cast the first stone in
One by one they left, leaving Jesus and the woman alone

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well no accusers are left that I see
And Woman, neither do I condemn thee
He reached down, he reached down
And he touched the pain
In the (Bible??) a story is told
About a traveler at the end of life's road
He's at the gates of the Kingdom and the Master says "Come on in"
For I was hungry and you gave me meat
I was cold you put shoes on my feet
When I was in prison there was you who come to see about me

[Chorus]

[Outro]
When you're debted to the least of these
He said you were doin' it unto me
You reached down, you reached down
And you touched my pain
