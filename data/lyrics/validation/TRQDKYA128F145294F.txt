(X)
Hey yeah
(Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh)
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah
(Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh)
Ooh, hey
(Let's go)
(X, X, X, X)

6 to 5
I'm two times
We're still around
Working night and day
We're still the same
Still getting down
Don't hate the haters
But the instigators
Won't make us bound
You can play our game
You can take our name
But you can't take our sound

You don't know how we like to flow
Got you all in tow
See we're in control

You can never stop us
Cos' we rock
And now we're gonna hit the top
Don't give a f if you like it or not
Come and see what we got cos you know we're so damn
Extraordinary
Extra naughty baby
Got the necessary
Flow, whoa, whoa, whoa
Ex-communicated
Extra stimulating
Just like a rocket
We'll explode

Oh

Wanna take the credit
But we won't forget
The way you tried it on
Said we'd disappear
Said you'd give us a year before we were gone
But I bet you never thought
We'd be together for so long
So you turn around and look at you now
You like our songs
(Ooh, yeah)

You don't know how we like to flow
(You don't know how we flow, oh)
Not your average joe
Keep you on your toes
You can never stop us
Cos' we rock
And now we're gonna hit the top
Don't give a f if you like it or not
Come and see what we got cos you know we're so damn

Extraordinary
Extra naughty baby
Got the necessary
Flow, whoa, whoa, whoa
Ex-communicated
Extra stimulating
Just like a rocket
We'll explode
(Yeah)

Anybody can affect your mind
So many people ass-licking
But we smile and grind
Cos we're not the type to believe the hype
We ain't faking this it's the way it is
(Oh)

Don't wanna run
Don't wanna hide
There's more to us that meets the eye
We do what we have to
We do it in style
This has to be our time

Rap By Jack Jones:
Came on the track
Now the X is back
With a big ass chain
And some Gucci slacks
What you think of that
Where the feds be at
Another 16 or adjust too tight
Teach new moves
Like a kung-fu sensing
Give it to you all like Bush and Kayne
Nobody said how much it costs
Blow up spots like I'm awful tough
Could be rough with stuff
Could be earning bucks
I'll be your con trail
Like you are enough
(You don't know)
Never lied of course
But he blew off course
And if you ain't Luke then
Don't use the force
Teachers watch how we get down
I came to get low with the X right now
I'm not saying she's an X right now
But it could be you
Better watch your mouth

X
Extra naughty baby
Got
Flow (whoa, whoa, whoa)
Ex-communicated
Extra stimulating
Just like a rocket we'll explode

Extraordinary
Extra naughty baby
(Extra naughty)
Got the necessary
Flow, whoa, whoa, whoa
Ex-communicated
(Communicated now)
Extra stimulating
Just like a rocket
We'll explode

We'll explode, oh, oh, oh, oh
X
