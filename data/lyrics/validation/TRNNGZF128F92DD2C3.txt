Yeah! Great skies of green
Yeah! Great fields of blue
Yeah! Vast swathes of pink

Who put the fork in your tongue?
Who broke the belt with a bang?

Try to remember: 'Old dog, new tricks'
Say it: "It's alright"
It's not your name they're dragging through the mud, it's mine

Who put the fork in your tongue?
Who broke the belt with a bang?

Try to remember your insularity
Say it: "It's alright"
It's not your name they're dragging through the mud

Forget to segregate yourself
Forget to flagellate yourself
Door meets door in the glamorous mansion
Forget to segregate yourself
Forget to flagellate yourself
And it's teeming with shadows;
Paralyzed minds make decisions in the dark

Who put the fork in your tongue?
Who broke the belt with a bang?
Buy it, run it, kick it, fuck it, yeah
