I woke her up
Late last night
Told her somethin' didn't feel quite right
She looked at me
Half asleep
Said "You're crazy just go back to bed"

I walked two miles
To be alone
Felt the cool air against my bones
On second street
I'll second guess
Everything I said

Are you near?
Are you still gonna save me?
From my fears
Are you still gonna save me?

Beyond the hills
Beneath the stars
By Saint Christopher I fell apart
The sun came up
So high above
I could not let myself be loved

Are you near?
Are you still gonna save me?
From my fears
Are you still gonna save me?

I need the daylight
Need the daylight now
There is a stranger in my head
Put my clothes on
Left a note that read
"I'm sorry my love failed again"

I woke her up
Late last night
Told her somethin' didn't feel quite right

Are you near?
Are you still gonna save me?
From my fears
Are you still gonna save me?
