WHEN THE DAYLIGHT IS DIMMED
AND THE DARKNESS DEEPENS
A SOLITARY EAGLE FLIES THROUGH THE HEAVENS
REMAINING ANGELS CRYING AND SO I THOUGHT
THIS DREAM, THIS DREAM WAS TRUE

THE EVERLASTING DREAM
EVERLASTING DREAM
EVERLASTING DREAM
EVERLASTING DREAM

I SAW A WOMAN WITH THE MOON BETWEEN HER FEET
A WOMAN WHO WALKED WRAPPED WITH THE SUN
A VISION SEEMS TO FILL THE DARKENING SKY
PORTRAYING THINGS, THINGS TO COME

THE EVERLASTING DREAM
EVERLASTING DREAM
EVERLASTING DREAM
EVERLASTING DREAM

A DREAM FOREVER

PROTECT ME, WITH THE SCORCHING NOONTIME HEAT !
PROTECT ME, I HAD A VISION, I HAD A VISION !

THE EVERLASTING DREAM
EVERLASTING DREAM
EVERLASTING DREAM
EVERLASTING DREAM
