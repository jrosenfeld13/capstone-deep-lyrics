[Verse 1]
All I need is some weed, liquor in the cup
Mix it up in the liver quicker, hit the dutch
Finish up when I'm twisted sip Bacardi black, rum, all the hotties have some, we goin party have fun Um...
Beer before liquore bet you never been sicker
Some times I'm cool sometimes the Tims kick up
Party like a star posted up at the bar
At the club, at the crib, just not in the car
Double fist na's, I'm pissed and so what
Watch out these mothaf***** kids goin throw up, There's chicks to bone up, I'm quick to roll up and find out which one of all these chicks I'm goin f***
Not to be rude but you know how it go
Alcohol in the system combined with dro
Got me open I'm hopin she'll understand
I got that good wood they call me lumber man

[Chorus 2x]
Give me beats, cash, streets, a**
Mind full of troubles got to live your life fast
Give me power, stength to devour
There go the cowards, no escape y'all done chose your fate

[Verse 2]
If I got cash in my pocket we goin mash out and lock it down
Pass through a couple towns, act like we bubble now
I humble down when my dough need a refill
No need to be killed so we goin be chill
I be ill while ya'll just be nill
Often we build while ya'll got weak skill
I mean still these raps is athletic
Cats need parametics with tracks from Arythmetic
Dare to set it off, bet it all, don't ever let it fall
Raw with the metaphores, course I'm the better boss
Never lost, you're losing your breath, ruin your rep
Crews want to step, but it's a duel to the death
There's rules in effect, abide by them
Apply triump, an alliance give you strengh and the pride of five lions
I'm a die trying to leave footsteps in the stone
Listen I'm home, ya'll bow when the king's on the throne

[Chorus 2x]
Give me beats, cash, streets, a**
Mind full of troubles got to live your life fast
Give me power, stength to devour
There go the cowards, no escape y'all done chose your fate
