If you caught me smiling
Do you think I'm laughing?
Can't you see I'm working?
Look at me I'm boring
What you say about my friend?
Do you think he's funny?
Lots of screamy weather
I'm amazed I'm living tonight

Do you suffer from mental?
Do you suffer from mental tonight?
Do you suffer from mental tonight?
Are you dying for pleasure?
Does it make you feel better?
Are you dying for pleasure tonight?

I can feel your heart beat
Can you keep on running
Your mind is on heat
As the world keeps burning
As she draws her last breath
Will you hear her calling?
Look at her she's fading
Be a man and solve her tonight

Do you suffer from mental?
Do you suffer from mental tonight?
Do you suffer from mental tonight?
Are you dying for pleasure?
Does it make you feel better?
Are you dying for pleasure tonight?

Like a star at night fall
Are you feeling lonesome?
I believe in action
So I move in closer
Look at him he's crying
I'm a towering pillar
And the world is looming
And there's a war on terror tonight

Do you suffer from mental?
Do you suffer from mental tonight?
Do you suffer from mental tonight?
Are you dying for pleasure?
Does it make you feel better?
Are you dying for pleasure tonight?

Do you suffer from mental?
Do you suffer from mental tonight?
Do you suffer from mental tonight?
Are you dying for pleasure?
Does it make you feel better?
Are you dying for pleasure tonight?
