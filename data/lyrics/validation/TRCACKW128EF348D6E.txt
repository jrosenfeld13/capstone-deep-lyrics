Doggone my soul, how I love them old songs
Oh, they were a comfort to me when I was alone
The dancing stops, but the music she goes on
Doggone my soul, how I love rock and roll, hey
And when I hear that double-eagle guitar
Makes me think of Carl Parkins when he was a star
Makes me think I'll spend of my nights in a bar
Playin' that old juke box until the honky tonk's locked up
And doggone my soul, they won't leave me alone
Oh, keeps reminding me when I was so far from home
Oh, those heartbreakin', edgemakin' country songs
That take me back to hardwood floors
And outdoor johns and mason jars
It's all I can believe, to believe that it's gone
Those hard rockin', rock and rollin' life that I've known
The dancing stops, but the music she goes on
Doggone my soul, how I love rock and roll
Oh, the dancing's over, but the music she goes on
Doggone my soul, how I love rock and roll
The dancing stops, but the music she goes on
Doggone my soul, how I love rock and roll
The dancing's over, but the music she goes on
Doggone my soul, how I love rock and roll
