Here I am I'm on my knees
You're the one I truly need
Longing to hear words of love
Cause you're the one I'm thinking of

You're the giver of my freedom
Your love I'll embrace
So in return I give myself
Cause your love gives

You have my life in your hands
A wonderful way to live
You have my life in your hands
Your love gives

You came in my heart with love
Make me feel like no other
A special child in your hands
A love note written in the sand

You're the giver of my freedom
Your love I'll embrace
So in return I give myself
Cause your love gives

You have my life in your hands
A wonderful way to live
You have my life in your hands
Your love gives

You have my life in your hands
A wonderful way to live
You have my life in your hands
Cause Jesus your love gives
