Every face I see is cold as ice
Everything I touch is pale
Ever since I lost imagination

Like a stream that flows into the sea
I am lost for all eternity
Ever since you took your love away from me

Sometimes (Sometimes)

Every face I see is cold as ice
Everything I touch is pale
Ever since I lost imagination

Like a stream that flows into the sea
I am lost for all eternity
Ever since you took your love away from me

Sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes

Sometimes
The sound of goodbye
Is louder than any drumbeat

Sometimes
The sound of goodbye
Is louder than any drumbeat

Sometimes
The sound of goodbye
The sound of goodbye

The sound of goodbye

Sometimes
The sound of goodbye
Is louder than any drumbeat

Sometimes
The sound of goodbye
Is louder than any drumbeat
