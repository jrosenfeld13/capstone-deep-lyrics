As we turn our lives
Down this complicated road
If you need a hand to hold
I promise you
I will be your friend
Through whatever life may send
And I know that you will be there too

If I should lose my way
Along this road we share
Please bring me home, come what may
If I should lose my way

When the wild wind blows
And the rain begins to fall
I will find you through it all
And comfort you
But as we move on
Should you turn and find me gone
The just rest awhile, I'll be along

If I should lose my way
Along this road we share
Please wait for me, come what may
If I should lose my way

Day after day, never let the sun go down
'Till love is found once more

If I should lose my way
Along this road we share
Please look for me, come what may
If I should lose my way

Please look for me....
If I should lose my way
