[Intro]

Fly me to the moon
And let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like
On Jupiter and Mars

In other words, hold my hand
In other words, darling kiss me

Fill my heart with song
And let me sing for ever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore

In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you

[Instrumental]

Fly me to the moon
And let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like
On Jupiter and Mars

In other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby kiss me

Fill my heart with song
And let me sing for ever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore

In other words, please be true
In other words, in other words
In other words, I love you
