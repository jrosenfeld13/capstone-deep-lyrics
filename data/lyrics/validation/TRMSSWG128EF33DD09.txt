I was raised in a smalltown - just a little German boy
I didn't care about history - I just cared about my toys

I never felt responsible - for what happened in a war
But they made me feeling guilty - even though I wasn't born (that time)

I remember I was 18 - when I heard the Army call
And I learned a lot about killing man - and drinkin' alcohol

It was like a game of cowboys - the good against the bad
The others were the good guys - I was German - I was bad

Ain't nothing wrong (tell me what's wrong)- to love your home
Like anyboy - in the world
Yesterday's gone - and we belong
To a new generation - singin' this song (I'm singin' my song)

CHORUS
I said hey
I wanna be proud of my country
Proud of it's people (proud of it's banner)
Proud to be free
I said hey
I wanna be proud of my country
Proud I was born here
Proud of Germany

Well, I made this trip to Vegas - with a friend of mine
Some people heard we're German - and they called us "Nazi swines"

Do you think it's fair to blame me - for the things I haven't done
So tell me how long - will this be going on

I wanna know - if you don't know
That you're hurting me and my country
Yesterday's gone and we belong
To a new german nation - who has found it's home

CHORUS
I said hey
I wanna be proud of my country
Proud of it's people
Proud to be free
I said hey
I wanna be proud of my country
Proud I was born here
Proud to live in Germany
