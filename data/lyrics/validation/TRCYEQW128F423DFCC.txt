Sane closed my head shut now that i am painted black
Everything i am is gone like you pushed me 
I burned my hand closed now i close my soul from behind
Now every time i wonder if my sodomy's gone
Repent my undercut (repent my lies)
Sewn shut nailed to myself (sewn shut my eyes)
Crushed ever deeper i am dead there's no belief
Time to try more to care nothing more i care now
Everything is done undone to keep myself a whole
Try believe myself believing everything i want
Repent my undercut (repent my lies)
Sewn shut nailed to myself (sewn shut my eyes)
Time to give myself peace everything brought on leave
I try my hardest and there's too much now
Every time there's no trusth all is gone this part of you
My friend send my friendnow is gone but you'll seee
Stained black neck and bloody hands ohh i am
Damned i am
There's a dead whore at my feet there's nothing
Give me my head nothing more i am dead
See my fate my soul my element is whole
Every one done no belief sadness and an open dream
Unsure these books all read death is fed through absent grief
All these pages no one sees five years and a smoking gun
Now my blood it thinkens and it all stops now
