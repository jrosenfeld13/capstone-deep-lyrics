Should I give you some, that is the question
And will it change the way you look at me
I have been so afraid while you've been so patient
My mother would have a fit if she could see...

You made a good good girl
Do a bad bad thing
Although my mind is strong
My body isn't listening
See I know right from wrong
But my heart won't speak (won't say nothing)
So should I stay a good good girl
Or do a bad bad thing

I'm burning incense and candles
I've planned it all perfectly
Now do you think you can handle
A massage from me, yea
Yes, I know it's unexpected
When love takes takes control
You've been naked
But I'm not afraid no more
I just want you to walk through that door

And make a good good girl
Do a bad bad thing
Although my mind is strong
My body isn't listening
See I know right from wrong
But my heart won't speak (won't say nothing)
So should I stay a good good girl
Or do a bad bad thing

Kissing you, feeling you (that's not so bad)
Touching you, holding you (that's not so bad)
Wanting you like I do (that's not so bad)
I've almost decided, I tried hard to fight it
I, I just might, I just might, give it to you

My mind is strong
My body isn't listening
See I know right from wrong
But my heart won't speak (won't say nothing)
So should I stay a good good girl
Or do a bad bad thing
