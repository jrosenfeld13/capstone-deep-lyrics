It's bright, the rising sun is dancing
On the back of a saving justice
Fusing beads of sweat
He's anointed to save the nation
Vanity erupts with movement
A movement from upstream
Behind every assertion, lie cryptic warnings
A glow which fills the mouth of an Asiatic feline
The stance of poised attack affirming his pride
Embracing assault
This cordial goodbye is written in blood
The age of innocence awake
Reviving infamy so alive, another cryptic martyr
In place of where to hide
There's a narrow path divided
And the innocence has died
No, we won't believe this fate
To be all of ours
There's freedom tonight
We won't believe the hope is dead, not this time
Move mountains with strength not quite of this world
We won't believe the hope is dead, not this time
Move mountains with strength not quite of this world
Nurtured in a barren womb, a pre-destined potential
The hours growing faster
Than the seed that is choked by thorns
Now, become the cryptic martyr
And this potential leader will fall as a lesson
And rise as a hero
With a life spent seeking demise
I'll find with the aftermath turning back
A seasoned observation
A tainted promise, broken heart, faced now with conviction
And in time, we all fall
In need of saving answers
We're tortured to light
Seeing without eyes
Cry out Samson, see without eyes
Cry out Samson, see without eyes
In all winds, seek anchor, the storm will soon be still
