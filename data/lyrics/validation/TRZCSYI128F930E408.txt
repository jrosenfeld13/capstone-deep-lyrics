*Clapping and gospel singing*

I got a story
About all these rats
All these SEWER rats
And all these good rats

I'm talkin bout these gold diggin rats
These hoooooood rats
My grandmother's a RAT!
She jus an Ol' School Rat

My mother's a RAT!
She jus a high class rat
My sistas rats
She jus a middle class rat

My cousin Rance
He jus looooow class rat
I'm tired a rats
Tryin tah get in my boys pockets

I'm tired of rats
Tryin ta ride round in our cars
I'm tired of rats
Talkin all that jibba jabba to they friendz

But in one day
These rats gon be straight
No dis the rats
Cause there are some rats that I love too

My message to you today
Is admit the rat in you!
To all women

Admit the rat in you!
Admit the rat in you!
Admit the rat in you!
Admit the rat in you!!!
