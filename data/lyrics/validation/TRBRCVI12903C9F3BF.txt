[Verse 1]
Waiting for the phone to ring
Diamond necklace on my shoulder
Waiting for the phone to ring
Lipstick on my naked shoulder
It seems to be my fancy to make it with
Franky and Nancy

[Chorus]
Over the bridge we go
Looking for love
Over the bridge we go
Looking for love
I'll come running to you, oh, baby if you want me
I'll come running to you now, baby if you want me

[Verse 2]
Looking at my hands today
Look to me that they're made of ivory
I had a funny call today
Someone died and someone married
You know that it's my fancy
To make it with Franky and Nancy, well

[Chorus]
Over the bridge they go
Looking for love
Over the bridge we go
Looking for love
I'll come running to you now, baby if you want me
I'll come running to you, baby if you want me
I'll come running to you now, baby if you want me
I'll come running to you, baby if you want me

[Outro]
Something's got a hold on me
It's the beginning of a new age
Oh, oh, oh, well it's
It's the beginning of a new age
Can you say it too for yourself?
Yes, it's the beginning of a new age
Oh. you little sick little fox, yes
It's the beginning of a new age
