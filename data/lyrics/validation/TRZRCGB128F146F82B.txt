[Intro]
Can't you see, this is me, I'm [x2]

[Verse 1]
Don't walk crowded streets
Choose every dream from a magazine stand
I don't buy into that
All day TV shows
Sell their souls just to make living easy
I don't buy into that
I don't need satin and lace
I'll bring a smile to your face

[Chorus]
I'll never be a fire but I will be the flame
I'll never be a diamond but I'll never be fake
I've never been a winner but I still play the game
Can't you see that this is me
I'm all the woman that I want to be

Can't you see, this is me, I'm a woman
Can't you see, this is me, I'm

[Verse 2]
Good times can't get enough
Life can be tough but it's all for a reason
I sure buy into that
Life goes around and around
We seek what we found 'cause it's all an illusion
I sure buy into that
I know the waters of fate
Will keep on flowing my way

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I've never been afraid of myself
I don't buy into that, I don't buy into that
I don't want to be nobody else
I don't buy into that [x3]

[Chorus] [x2]

[outro]
I'll never be a fire but I will be the flame
I'll never be a diamond but I'll never be fake
