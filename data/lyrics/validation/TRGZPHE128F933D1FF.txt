I never like surrender thought I had the answers
Too proud to ask for help
But you knew my that heart was dark like December
Cold like the winter until you pulled me into yourself

I was just out there searching wasting my time believing
I could be all I needed a prisoner of my own war
Then you showed me your glory wrote me a brand new story
Love was right there before me
What was I fighting for, what was I fighting for?
What was I fighting for?

Thank you for mercy I am so undeserving
You could've left me on my own, stubborn and alone
But that isn't like you, yeah you do what you do
You bring your people home

I was just out there searching wasting my time believing
I could be all I needed a prisoner of my own war
Then you showed me your glory wrote me a brand new story
Love was right there before me
What was I fighting for, what was I fighting for?
What was I fighting for?

In the moment I gave you my heart was the moment
I started living for the first time
And the day that you lifted my eyes
Was the day I came alive, I came alive
Oh I came alive, whoa, oh oh

I was just out there searching wasting my time believing
I could be all I needed a prisoner of my own war
Then you showed me your glory wrote me a brand new story
Love was right there before me
What was I fighting for, what was I fighting for?
What was I fighting for?

Now I am alive and you're all that I am fighting for
God you are all I am fighting for
