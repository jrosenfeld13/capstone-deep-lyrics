Everything and everyone
You're everything, you're everyone
You're everything, you're everywhere
Can't take from here
Can't take no more
You're everything of mine
You're looking* love away
You're everything to me
(tomorrow)
I can't look away
(tomorrow)
Tomorrow
I'm loosing sight, Can you look behind?
Is it burning bright, on the other side?
Tonight
Today
Too late
And the memories won't fade
I'm still there without you
You got to learn from your* sight*
Burn like me and you
Tomorrow
Tonight
And I need time no more
(tomorrow)
When you can't cry no more
(tomorrow)
And our love died before
(tomorrow)
Look behind no more
(tomorrow)
It's just another fine day, recall
Don't follow me down, no more
As we rise we form
A new god dawn
On me*
Tonight
Today
Too late
Too late
And I need time no more
(Too late)
When you can't cry no more
(Too late)
And our love died before
(too late)
Look behind no more
(too late)
Tomorrow
Too late
Tonight
Tonight
And I need time no more
