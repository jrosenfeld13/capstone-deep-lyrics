They rushed as I released the ball downfield
My receiver knows which way to turn and he'll find it
And these things I just know

When someone's coming up behind me
I scramble to the right
And it's this sense that keeps my knees from dying

Back at home my family's watching me
Slapping hands in the middle of a stadium
Back in a midtown high-rise hotel room
She's thinking of me, waiting to see me

Someone's coming up behind me
So I scramble to the right
And it's this sense that keeps my knees from dying

And I'm sure you all know the game
You relive it play by play
When you go to work tomorrow

Chorus

Picture me at night
Living dreams out on the field at home
Never reeling from the game
With my leg up in a sling, my head packed in ice

Showing up at Shea Stadium
Where you can hardly see the number on my jersey
You can hardly believe my stats from this whole season
On certain nights you'll see the light on in my building
