[Verse 1]
They say I'm crazy the way you got me open, baby ooh
They say I'm buggin' the way I'm top sweatin' your lovin', ooh
They all sit and wonder why this feelin I cannot hide
It ain't a question of pride, ooh
It's love, ooh it's love

[Verse 2]
They say I'm trippin' the way you got my whole life flippin', ooh
They say I'm losin' it just can't seem to keep my grip, baby ooh
We all cry when we feel pain, when love is gone we're not the same
It ain't a question of brains

[Hook]
Ooh it's love, ooh it's love
Ooh it's love, ooh it's love
Love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love

[Bridge]
They all sit and wonder why this feelin' I cannot hide
It ain't a question of pride

[Hook]

Love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love
