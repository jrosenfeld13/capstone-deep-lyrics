A beam of light cuts through the dark
My angel enraged to hate
I see what life's all about
But I just can't relate
Reality will bring you to your knees
As life goes on
War within my reach...
My war
War
An empty gaze at early dawn
Before the morning light
Instinct has become mistrust
No valves, wrong or right
A path of life that left it's mark
Like footprints in the snow
You can run, but you can't hide
You've got nowhere to go
