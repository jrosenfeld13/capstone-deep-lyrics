The prayers that we pray in foxholes and funerals
The songs that we sing in delivery rooms
The questions we ask when nobody's listening
But the man in the moon

The way our hearts beat, faced with a sunrise
Like maybe they know something we don't
But it's all in code and we can't decode it
Or maybe we won't

Do we dare pay attention, dare even mention
The mystery we find ourselves caught in
And do we dare to remember
All that we have forgotten

Each breath that we take, we take for granted
So if there are clues we remain unaware
All the days of our lives burn down like matches
Vanish into thin air

But there are dreams that we dream when we least expect them
And memories that come like unbidden tears
All the things we believed when we were just children
It's been so many years

Do we dare pay attention, dare even mention
The mystery we find ourselves caught in
And do we dare to remember
All that we have forgotten

We are battered and torn from the day we are born
In a world that has blinded and bound us
Is it any surprise we don't open our eyes
To the truth that's disguised all around us?

Like the secrets we keep, we don't know we're keeping
From before there was time, before there were lies
Can we find you again, this far from the garden?
Do we dare even try?

Do we dare pay attention, dare even mention
The mystery we find ourselves caught in
And do we dare to remember
All that we have forgotten?
Forgotten, forgotten
