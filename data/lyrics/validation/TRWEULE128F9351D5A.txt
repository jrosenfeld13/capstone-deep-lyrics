Some kind of magic
Happens late at night
When the moon smiles down on me
And bathes me in it's light

I fell asleep beneath you
In the tall blades of grass
When I woke the world was new
I never had to ask

[Hook]
It's a brand new day
The sun is shinning
It's a brand new day
For the first time
In such a long long time
I know
I'll be ok

Most kind of stories
Save the best part for last
Most stories have a hero who finds
You make your past your passed
Ya you make your past your passed

[Hook]

This cycle never ends
You gotta fall in order to mend

[Hook]
