I love to love
Want plenty of love each night
Say I love to love it's so good it can't be right

I don't want a man with Harvard or Yale degrees
Because I don't intend to play information please
Just squeeze me or baby you gonna freeze me
You've got to Romeo me make feel like I'm Salom

Don't want a man to sit there and talk too much
I just need a guy with a Frank Sinatra touch
Cos I'm tired of all the times I felt
Like a piece of butter about to melt
I wanna press your lips against mine
I wanna feel lightning tickle my spine
I want what there can never to be too much of
Yes I love to love

Just squeeze me or baby you gonna freeze me
When the iron is hot strike it
Hold me I like it I like it

Don't want a man to sit there and talk too much
I just need me a guy with a Frank Sinatra touch
Just build me an earthquake as fast as you can
I got me a hobby and my hobby is men
He's what I intend to build my collection of
Because I love to love
