(Spoken:)
There's no reason for you to cry my love
I'll always be around
So dry your tears my love i'm here
Now, always, forever

(Verse 1:)
Happy now it's, between you and me
It'll last forever just you wait and see
I will prove to you sweetheart the things i'll say
Come straight from the heart
Always be the way i promised
That i will always stay
I'll grant you a wish that will come true
Cuz darlin' it was meant for you

(Chorus)
There's no reason for you to cry my love
Cuz i'll always be around
So dry your tears my love i'm here
Always standin' by your side
No oh oh oh....
There's no reason for you to cry my love
Cuz i'll always be around
So dry your tears my love i'm here
Always standin' by your side

(Verse 2:)
Your sorrows had me so confused
That your love i did refuse
Forgive me baby i regret it
Cuz your love was always true
Caring for you til the end of time
As each day passes by
You've showed me the things that i never knew
You've showed me how to love like you
So.oh.oh

(Chorus)
Th-th-th-there's no reason-
(Music Break)
Oooooooooooooooooo........

(Chorus)

(Verse3:)
We'll be together forever more always til the day i die
Its just a reference so we can learn to understand
If only you could see me up my hopes yu would care
Once in a while....
I look at you and see that you are my guiding light

There's a reason our love
Always be around
Always standin by your side
There's a reason
I said no reason to cry
I'm always standin by your side

(Spoken:)
There's no reason for you to cry my love
I'll always be around
So dry your tears my love i'm here
Now, always, forever
