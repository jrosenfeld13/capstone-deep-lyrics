[Verse 1]
Before you met me I was a fairy princess
I caught frogs and called them prince
And made myself a queen
Before you knew me I traveled around the world
I slept in castles and fell in love
Because I was taught to dream
I found mayonnaise bottles and poked holes on top
To capture tinkerbell
They were just fireflies to the untrained eye
But I could always tell

[Chorus]
I believe in fairytales and dreamers dreams like bed sheet sails
And I believe in peter pan and miracles
And anything I can to get by
And fireflies

[Verse 2]
Before I grew up I saw you on a cloud
I could bless myself in your name and pat you on your wings
Before I grew up I heard you whisper so loud
"life is hard, and so is love, child, believe in all these things"
I found mayonnaise bottles and poked holes on top
To capture tinkerbell
And they were just fireflies to the untrained eye
But I could always tell

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Before you met me I was a fairy princess
I caught frogs and called them prince
And made myself a queen
Before you knew me I traveled around the world
And I slept in castles and fell in love
Because I was taught to dream
