Sophistication

Who, who, who do you think you are
Who, who, looks like a superstar

Im not gonna rag about what I see
Youre wasting your precious time staring at me
You try to look mysterious, but it ain't no big deal
So why must I have to tell you that you got to be real

Who, who, who drives a foreign car
Who, who, who thinks that hes a star
Who, who, who takes the game too far
Who needs some sophistication

You wear designer clothes
But, thats as far as it goes
Halston and Gucci can only take you so far
Youre not half the man that you think you are

Who, who, who has an attitude
Who, who, whos wearing lots of jewels
Who, who, whos sometimes very rude
Who needs some sophistication

Whos that being deceiving, when youre not aware
Every time you turn around, what, what, what, what
What you think you see, what you think you see
What you think you see, no, really isnt there

Who, who, whos living in the past
Who, who, whos moving much too fast
Who, who, who needs to find some class
Who needs some sophistication

Im not hard to please, but youre acting so unreal
And I hope you dont mind hearing about how I feel
Take a look in the mirror, cuz a mirror won't conceal
Something ain't right, you dont quite fit the bill

Who, who, whos got their head on wrong
Who, who, who sing a different song
Who, who, when all their cash is gone
Who needs some sophistication

Gonna have to change your name
Cuz youve got yourself to blame
Gonna Have to leave this town
Cuz we dont want you around

Who, who, whos gonna be afraid
Who, who, when all the good times end
Who, who, who needs to look ahead
Who needs some sophistication

Who, who, who has a lot to learn
Who, who, as far as Im concerned
Who, who, whos gonna end up burned
Who needs some sophistication

Ill break it to you easy before you get your fill
Something is lacking cuz you dont quite fit the bill

It ain't no big deal
I wanna be for real
You think your game is tight
But something just ain't right
Youre almost up to par
Do you know just who you are
Ill break it to you easy
Before you get your fill
Something is lacking
Cuz you dont quite fit the bill

Who, who, who do you think you are
Who, who, youre no star
Who, who, who do you think you are
Who, who, youre no star
Who, who, who do you think you are
Who, who, youre no star
