Destined to follow
Afraid to miss any trend
The TV is your truth
You just watch and absorb
Never in any doubt
About the message it spreads
You're locked in a mental cage
For the rest of your days

Get-A-Life, Get-A-Life

Your mind is polluted
With useless information
For a successful career
But you can't handle emotions
Only poor imitations
True intentions have faded
You're locked in a mental cage
For the rest of your days

Get-A-Life, Get-A-Life

Switch off those presets in your brain
Replace them with life
Just for once think for yourself
And get a life

Is it too hard to handle, to deal with that truth?
Is it too hard to handle, to live without rules?
You're locked in a mental cage
For the rest of your days

Get-A-Life, Get-A-Life
