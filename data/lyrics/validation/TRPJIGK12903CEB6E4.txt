In your eyes I see myself / in my eyes I see you
In her face I see myself / we're the same you and me

In her eyes I see myself / in my face I see her
We're the same / you and me
We're the same

In your eyes I see myself / in my eyes I see you
In her face I see myself / we're the same

In your pain I feel myself / in my eyes I see her
We're the same / you and me
We're the same
