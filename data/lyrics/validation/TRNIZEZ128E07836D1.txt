All the pain that haunts me still
And all the shame surrounding you
And all the past that I can't kill, forever wrapped around me
And all the sadness in our lives, and all the things I can't hide
And all the fear that's deep inside, from all the years of hiding

There's a ghost that's inside of my mind
There's a pain that is haunting me still, and I could never go back and rewind
And I could never have peace or be still

Somebody take this away, they took you far away from me
So I could never find you
They made me blind but I could see, the loaded gun from behind you
The end of everything we knew, inside of me and inside you
I miss the way we used to be
When I was what would bring you through
