[Verse 1]
They slit our throats
Like we were flowers
And our milk has been
Devoured

[Pre-Chorus]
When you want it, it goes away too fast
Times you hate it, it always seems to last
Just remember, when you think you're free
The crack inside your fucking heart is me

[Chorus: Thought, Not Spoken]
I wanna outrace the speed of pain
For another day
I wanna outrace the speed of pain
For another day

[Verse 2]
I wish I could sleep
But I can't lay on my back
Because there's a knife
For everyday that I've known you

[Pre-Chorus]
When you want it, it goes away too fast
Times you hate it, it always seems to last
Just remember, when you think you're free
The crack inside your fucking heart is me

[Chorus: Thought, Not Spoken]
I wanna outrace the speed of pain
For another day
I wanna outrace the speed of pain
For another day

[Bridge]
Lie to me, cry to me, give to me, I would
Lie with me, die with me, give to me, I would
Keep all your secrets wrapped in dead hair, for always
Keep all your secrets wrapped in dead hair, for always

Lie to me, cry to me, give to me, I would
Lie with me, die with me, give to me, I would
I hope at least we die holding hands, for always
I hope at least we die holding hands, for always
I hope at least we die holding hands
