Have you ever felt so strong
That it made you feel weak
Long days, long nights and you just can't sleep
Have you ever been so sure
That it gave you cold feet
That you felt on edge, you can feel your heart beat
Well I never knew this feeling, never
Now I hope it stays and lasts forever
I am running high
Don't wanna come down
Hope my wings don't fail me now
But if I can touch the sky
I'd risk the fall just to know how it feels to fly

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah

Have you ever felt so lost
But didn't know till you were found
Looking everywhere, but you finally see now
In a room full of people
Feel like no one's around
Got your head in the clouds and your feet up off the ground
Say I never knew this feeling, never
Now I hope it stays and lasts forever
I am running high
Don't wanna come down
Hope my wings don't fail me now
And if I can touch the sky
I'd risk the fall just to know how it feels to fly

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We get to go
(High)
Higher
(High)
Higher
Higher

I am running high
Don't wanna come down
Hope my wings don't fail me now
If I can touch the sky
I'd risk the fall just to know how it feels to fly
I am running high
Don't wanna come down
Hope my wings don't fail me now
If I can touch the sky
I'd risk the fall just to know how it feels to fly
