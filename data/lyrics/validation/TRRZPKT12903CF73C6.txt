I see a coldness in your eyes like a winter's day
You won't accept the compromise love brings your way
Perfection you see as your prize, oh yeah

But will the circle be unbroken?

You can only learn to love when you understand
Accepting people as they are puts the key in hand
You may be looking at the stars but on earth you stand

Will the circle be unbroken?
Will the circle be unbroken?
Will it be unbroken?

Loving you is loving your imperfection
In loving me just let me see I'm your inspiration

You're driven solely by a dream that can never be
You resign yourself to search, it's your destiny
You may be looking at the stars but there's only me

Will the circle be unbroken?
Will the circle be unbroken?
Will it be unbroken?

Loving you is loving your imperfection
In loving me just let me see I'm your inspiration

Will it be, will it be, will it be unbroken?
Will it be, will it be, will it be unbroken?
Will it be, will it be, will it be unbroken?
Will it be, will it be, will it be unbroken?

Loving you is loving your imperfection
In loving me just let me see I'm your inspiration
Loving you is loving your imperfection
In loving me just let me see I'm your inspiration

Will it be, will it be, will it be unbroken?
Will it be, will it be, will it be unbroken?
Will it be, will it be, will it be unbroken?
Will the circle be unbroken?

Will it be, will it be unbroken?
Will it be, will it be, will it be unbroken?
Will it be, will it be, will it be unbroken?
Will the circle be unbroken?

Will it be, will it be, will it be unbroken?
Will it be, will it be, will it be unbroken?
