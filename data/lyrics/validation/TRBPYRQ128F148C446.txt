Ah yeah
You might be getting real funky
Just drop a dime like this

Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven, Six, Five, Four, Three, Two, One

Come on, getting funky now
This is another black hand smash
Yup yup you all
And we're going to kick it something like this

Baby You're the one for me
Baby you've got me going crazy

Saw you from a distance
You barely caught my eye
Your body's outrageous
Girl, you blow my mind
We had a conversation
I knew it right away
With you for a lifetime
Is where I want to stay

Baby, you're the one for me
Your love is the answer
You're everthing I need
Baby, you've got me going crazy
Need more of your lovin'
Give it all to me

Listen baby
These vibes they are building
For you I can't contain
Girl, everthing about you
Is driving me insane
U want, girl
The way you wear your hair
You've got it all together
Is something very rare
Well now, baby
One thing about you
You know I can't deny
You've got it all together
Your attitude, girl
You've got me in the mood, girl
You've got it
I'm going crazy

Give it to me come on

Baby, I'm going crazy
You've got to be the only one for me
Your love is the answer
You're everthing I need
Baby, I'm going crazy
You've got to be the only one for me
Need more of your lovin'
Give it all to me
