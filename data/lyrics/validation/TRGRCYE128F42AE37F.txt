[Verse 1]
Sitting on a bench at West Town Mall
He sat down in his overalls and asked me
You Waiting on a woman
I nodded yeah and said how 'bout you
He said son since nineteen fifty-two I've been
Waiting on a woman

[Verse 2]
When I picked her up for our first date
I told her I'd be there at eight
And she came down the stairs at eight-thirty
She said I'm sorry that I took so long
Didn't like a thing that I tried on
But let me tell you son she sure looked pretty
Yeah she'll take her time but I don't mind
Waiting on a woman

[Verse 3]
He said the wedding took a year to plan
You talk about an anxious man, I was nervous
Waiting on a woman
And then he nudged my arm like old men do
And said, I'll say this about the honeymoon, it was worth it
Waiting on a woman

[Verse 4]
And I don't guess we've been anywhere
She hasn't made us late I swear
Sometimes she does it just cause she can do it
Boy it's just a fact of life
It'll be the same with your young wife
Might as well go on and get used to it
She'll take her time because you don't mind
Waiting on a woman

[Verse 5]
I've read somewhere statistics show
The man's always the first to go
And that makes sense cause I know she won't be ready
So when it finally comes my time
And I get to the other side
I'll find myself a bench, if they've got any
I hope she takes her time, cause I don't mind
Waiting on a woman

[Outro]
Honey, take your time, cause I don't mind
Waiting on a woman
