Hanging from the cobwebs in you mind
It looks like a long, long way to fall
No one ever told me life was kind
I guess I never heard it, never heard it all

Living in a world of make believe
I can hide behind what's real
But wearing your emotions on your sleeve
And they all know what you feel

And here it comes again
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart

Oh, never tell a secret with your eyes
It's the eyes that let you down
Tell a little truth with many lies
It's the only way I've found

Oh here it comes again
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart

Shout to the wind
How can you hurt me this way
Oh once it begins
It looks like it's coming to stay

Hanging from the cobwebs in your mind
It looks like a long, long way to fall
No one never told me life was kind
I guess I never heard it, never heard it all, no

But here it comes again
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart

Here it comes again
Straight through the heart
In the middle of the heart
Now don't stand still, they'll get you
Right through your heart

And here it comes, here it comes again
Straight through the heart
