There's a motion in daily silence
That's the yeses swimming round my head
I need to listen to my conscience
The world puts me down instead
I have four walls and they're to watch me
The blankness jumps right off the page
My fingers try to tear the paper
A bitter moment is almost dead
It's almost dead
Come take my hand
Thought I'd tell the bit of it
And what makes sense
And wait for all that I offer
And they take my only bread
And I leave another example of
Well it leaves me, at about a thousand miles
I feel the beating of the heartbreak
I feel the beating of the sun
And as I'm getting any closer
Well I'm more than full of you
In this place
This hell
Come take my hand
Thought I'd tell the bit of it
And what makes sense
And wait for all that I offer
And they take my only bread
There's only so much I will take
Bitterness is my rage
And wait for all that I offer
And they take my only bread
Give yourself a break
Your only bread
Your only bread
And they're down there
See 'em lined up
They're hungry on the pavement, feed them
When they lay their hands out for a bit of your spare change
I see the ones that are ignoring them
You know their pockets are lined full of gold
Clearly lined with their golden veins
Come take my hand
Thought I'd tell the bit of it
And what makes sense
They wait for all that I offer
And they take my only bread
There's only so much I should take
Bitterness is no rage
They wait for all that I offer
And they take my only bread
Your only bread
But I sell the bread
Their only bread
They look down, down
Oh they bring you down
While all around them they line 'em on the docks, one by one
For the rope around their ankle, the other end there is a rock
One by one they dunk them over
Sinking them over down into the ocean
But then it's useless
It has been for
Come take my hand
Thought I'd tell the bit of it
And what of it makes sense
And wait for all that I offer
And they take my only bread
There's only so much I will take
Bitterness is my rage
And wait for all that I offer
And they leave empty hands
Down
Oh they're sending them down
One by one they knock them over
And they just sink down
Suddenly down
A simple down
Let's all lay down
