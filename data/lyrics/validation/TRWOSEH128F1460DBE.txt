It's time to say a word
"Say it like you mean it," he spoke with a tone of hurt
As my eyes rolled back hoping for the end
One too many condescending battles for a friend

Say another word
And I'll sit on the floor
Keep talking down to me
You're not only losing me
You're losing what's in store

I'll try to stay awake
When I go, when I get home
I'll try to stay away
Over the phone so I can tell the truth

Something keeps on getting in the way
Between you and I on summer holiday
Just wait one minute more
'Cause my heart is halfway torn and you're already gone

I'll try to stay awake (So I can tell you)
When I go, when I get home
I'll try to stay away (So I can tell you)
Over the phone so I can tell the truth

Say another word
Face first on the floor
Keep talking down to me
Losing what was almost meant to be

I'll try to stay awake (So I can tell you)
When I go, when I get home
I'll try to stay away (So I can tell you)
Over the phone so I can tell the truth
