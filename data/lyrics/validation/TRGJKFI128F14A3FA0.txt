I got a fearful feather and it starts to glow
I feel it's something but it's not my own
I got to change the pattern cause they patter so loud
Nowadays I really know I've got to go

Good morning Miss Murray
I feel good but I know your not coming
Good morning Miss Murray
I feel good but I know your not coming

Hey...

And when my dear starts running I'll be out the door
I fish for hillies in the midnight hour
I start to find myself in the industry
And watch the people that belong to me

Good morning Miss Murray
I feel good but I know your not coming
Good morning Miss Murray
I feel good but I know your not coming

Hey and you wait another day for me
You worked so hard
You're waiting for another cub
We gonna end our nights togehter
We gonna make what noone ever

And if you jump from the queens bridge you're alright
2 lonely hearts just to slow to beat all time
And if the peer is gonna drag you up
Like holy Murray on the nightmare cup

We gonna end our nights together
We gonna make what noone ever

I got a fearful feather and it starts to glow
Good Morning Miss Murray
I feel it's something but it's not my own
Good Morning Miss Murray
I got to change the pattern cause they patter so loud
Good Morning Miss Murray
Nowadays I really know I've got to go
Good morning,La Belle and me....
