Goodnight, baby
You know I hate to leave you now
Keep on bein' my lady
And I'll see you tomorrow somehow

Right now it's a goodnight, baby
Baby, goodnight
Sweet dreams, baby
Won't you keep me on your mind?

Every time I turn to walk away
I feel the power of love comin' on
The look in your eyes seems to tell you
You feel the same way after I'm gone

Hurts to leave you, but
Goodnight, baby, baby, goodnight
And if you wake up feelin' lonely
You can call me any time

Every time I turn to walk away
I feel the power of love comin' on
The look in your eyes seems to tell you
You feel the same way after I'm gone

I'd better get away, say
Goodnight, baby, baby, goodnight
I'll go on, baby, I know
I feel the power of love
