You always say you wanna follow me
But when I call you're never around
Talk is cheap. It's time for action
This time I'm gonna pin you down

I wanna see your faith on the line
You've got to take it to the limit
'Cause my love is all you need
Take it to the limit
And by my side you'll always be

I could provide everything you lack
But you keep tryin' to carry the world on your back

I wanna see your faith on the line
You've got to take it to the limit
'Cause my love is all you need
Take it to the limit
And by my side you'll always be

You talk in circles but You can't see
You'll find your freedom
When you start trustin' in Me

I wanna see your faith on the line
You've got to take it to the limit
'Cause my love is all you need
Take it to the limit
