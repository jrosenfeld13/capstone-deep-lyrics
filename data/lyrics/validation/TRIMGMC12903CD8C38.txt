Wait don't get up cuz it's too late
Weak and feeling crestfallen
Tied up to my eyes with this cruel tape
She wants to keep me on the safe side

Here on the ground it is so far
From everything I left out
Not been around, now you answer
With two words at the same time

When all that I need is for you
To keep my darkest memory
It's all that I see and I know you feel
Like nothing's wrong with me

Here on the ground it is so far
From everything I left out
Not been around, now you answer
With two words at the same time

Rain makes it go round I'm not to blame
For acting like I'm surprised
Far over and out makes it too safe
He wants to beat me for the last time

When all that I need is for you
To keep my darkest memory
It's all that I see and I know you feel
Like nothing's wrong with me
