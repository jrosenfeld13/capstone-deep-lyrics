She's driving away with the dim lights on
She's making a play and she can't go wrong
She never waits too long
She's winding them down on her clock machine
And she won't give up 'cause she's seventeen
She's a frozen fire
She's my one desire

CHORUS
And I don't want to hold her down
Don't want to break her crown
When she says, let's go
I like the nightlife baby
She says, let's go

She's laughing inside 'cause they can't refuse
She's so beautiful now, she doesn't wear her shoes
She doesn't like to choose
She's got wonderful eyes and a risque mouth
And when I ask her before, she said she's holding out
She's a frozen fire
She's my one desire

CHORUS
