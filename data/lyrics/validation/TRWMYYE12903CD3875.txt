Who are you?
Never thought you cared
I can do for you
Things you never thought I'd dare to do
And dancing round my head I found
The hold on myself release
I never thought I'd understand
Such a feeling of relief

I say yeah, it's all right
'Cause I really want you close to me
All the stars are in line tonight
And I feel we know that what will be
It's all right

Where were you?
When everything went dark
In the scheming
And messing with my heart
I'm thinking 'bout the whole idea
And it doesn't seem so bad
It's really not so far removed
From the sweet dreams I had

Que sera, sera, sera
Que sera, sera, sera
