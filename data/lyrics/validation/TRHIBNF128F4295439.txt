There was heat in the air
Cops everywhere you looked
There wasn't a lot
The breaks that you got
You know you took

And I remember wonderin'
Where you've been
The night Spanish Eddie
Cashed it in

The night Spanish Eddie
Cashed it in
They were playin'
"Desolation Row" on the radio

The night Spanish Eddie
Fell from grace
There was amazement on his face
On the night that Eddie failed
Sanity prevailed

It was June or July
When the heat from above beat down
It was famine or drought
When the brothers went out of style uptown

And we was mixin'
Vicks with lemon gin
The night Spanish Eddie
Cashed it in

The night Spanish Eddie
Cashed it in
They were playin'
"Desolation Row" on the radio

The night Spanish Eddie
Made front page
His revolution came of age
He wrote "surrender" on the wall
The night he took the fall

I heard someone say
"He's tryin' to fly"
Like Eddie used to say
"We'll do when we die"

I know someone turned you
For a spin
The night Spanish Eddie
Cashed it in

The night Spanish Eddie
Cashed it in
They were playin'
"Desolation Row" on the radio

The night Spanish Eddie
Fell from grace
There was amazement on his face
On the night that Eddie failed
Sanity prevailed

The night Spanish Eddie
Cashed it in
They were playin'
"Desolation Row" on the radio

The night Spanish Eddie
Cashed it in
They were playin'
"Desolation Row" on the radio

The night Spanish Eddie
Cashed it in
They were playin'
"Desolation Row" on the radio
