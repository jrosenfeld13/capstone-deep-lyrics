She was a beauty queen with ADD
She says that she forgets the day that I met her

Temporary 'til she found something better

No, she wasn't worth it anyway"

She was a dizzy dish of cool khaki
But the gap inside her head was offensive
There was another from a Seinfield scene
Well her manly hands were far too aggressive
No worry
What's all the hurry
My mother she just sits up and cries:
