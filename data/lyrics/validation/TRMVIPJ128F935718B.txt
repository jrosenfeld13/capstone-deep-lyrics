Sixty-minute man
Lookie here girls I'm telling you now
They call me "Lovin' Dan"
I rock 'em, roll 'em all night long
I'm a sixty-minute man

Yeah, yeah , yeah

If you don't believe I'm all I say
Come up and take my hand
When I let you go you'll cry "Oh yes
He's a sixty-minute man"

There'll be 15 minutes of kissing
Then you'll holler "please don't stop" (don't stop)
There'll be 15 minutes of teasing
And 15 minutes of squeezing
And 15 minutes of blowing my top

If your man ain't treating you right
Come up and see ol' Dan
I rock 'em, roll 'em all night long
I'm a sixty-minute man
