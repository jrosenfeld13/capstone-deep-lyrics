The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song have gone
But the melody lingers on

The moon descending
But it's found the break of dawn
You and the song have gone
But the melody lingers on

Beneath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon

The song descended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song have gone
But the melody lingers on

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song have gone
But the melody lingers on

The moon descended
But it's found at the break of dawn
You and the song have gone
But the melody lingers on

Beneath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song have gone
But the melody lingers on

Beneath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended, it ended too soon

The song is ended
The melody, the melody lingers on
The melody, the melody lingers on
