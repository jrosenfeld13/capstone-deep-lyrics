Broken hearted people always seem to drink
And tryin' to drown those sorrows it ain't as easy as you think
And living with a liar is a hard old way to go
Laughing just to keep from cryin' ain't no way to grow old

So take me to a barroom driver set me on a stool
If I can't be her man I'm damned if I'll be her fool

Whiskey ain't the best way then I ain't too smart
Think I just found out she was lying from the start
If this is nothing but a bad joke looking for a laugh
Hold on to your lampshade darling I'm looking for a hat

And you take me to a barroom driver set me on a stool...

So get this taxi movin' I got no time to lose
No time to be choosy you know that any old bar will do
I'm looking to get slightly drunk I'm looking to get loose
And if that don't get it done darling I'll come looking for you

Take me to a barroom driver set me on a stool...
