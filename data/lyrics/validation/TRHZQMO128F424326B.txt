The day goes black
All alone in the dark by a candle's silhouette
Facing the life you dread
Got on track
But again it seems you're so close to death
Waiting for the end

Racing for the one chance now
It's a long tangled road filled with danger
Filled with doubt
Still we try to find some hope
It's never sure
It all depends on who you know

Take a look inside
Release your demons
Can't you see the friends you bought
Are long gone now

Waiting somewhere in dark seclusion
Spending your last days in dire pain
Falling off the wheel of confusion
Justice won't be there
Time will only strain

When you had the fear engrained
You walked among destruction
Built your altar way up high

No one heard the calls in vain
You formed a lamb of gold
And you crept inside

All the promises
That were never kept
See the consequence
There's nothing left

Waiting somewhere in dark seclusion
Spending your last days in dire pain
Falling off the wheel of confusion
Justice won't be there
Time will only strain
