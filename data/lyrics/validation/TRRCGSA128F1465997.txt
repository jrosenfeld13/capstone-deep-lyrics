We go walking, hand in hand
All across the land it's East At Easter
People walking hand in hand
When ships are moving south it will be East at Easter
We will rock you, rock you little child
We will rock you, rock you little child
All across the land it's East At Easter
All across the land it's East At Easter

Things will lighten up the sky, East At Easter
Things will lighten up the sky, East At Easter
We'll go walking hand in hand
'Cause all across the land it will be East At Easter
Ah, we will rock you, rock you little child
We will rock you, rock you little child
All across the land it's East At Easter
When ships go moving south it will be East At Easter

They're gonna lighten up the sky
They're gonna lighten up the sky
They're gonna lighten up the sky
East At Easter

Ah, we'll go walking hand in hand
We'll go walking hand in hand, yes
We will rock you, rock you little child
We will rock you, rock you
Rock you little child
They're gonna lighten up the sky
When they lighten up the sky it will be East At Easter
We will rock you, rock you, rock you
