What's coming from
Beyond the sea of death
It's words celebrating an eroded artery
It's a creak of gravity
To bury an internal exploded brain

What's coming from
Beyond the sea of death
It's a glitter of metal
Praying for vocal chords in despair
It's a lament of ghosts
Shaking bleached backbones

What's coming from
Beyond the sea of death
It's a mirage of an alienated future

Nobody appears yet ?
To see a newborn light shining
Beyond the sea of death
