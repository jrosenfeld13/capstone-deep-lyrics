Ha
I used to know this city like a needle knows its thread
We used to dance together like a pillow and a bed
I could see what was on the outside
But I cant feel any death
And when I woke up (??) just like Id never been

I thought this place would stay the same, forever
Twisted on the sidewalk by myself
Feels like Im moving backwards on a foggy road
Wishing that I could ask somebody for help
But Im moving backwards on a foggy road

You think that youre going crazy
Well Ive got news for you
I was always dreaming with my hometown, its true
Feels like I went in your water
Where everythings so unreal
Im just another number on the grounding wheel

I thought this place would stay the same, forever
Twisted on the sidewalk by myself
Feels like Im moving backwards on a foggy road
Wishing that I could ask somebody for help
But Im moving backwards on a foggy road

Feels like Im swimming with strangers, with strangers
In water and blood, and I dont know what I can do or what to say
Everything is new to me
Im not afraid of the water I told you
Its over, Im older
I dont know what I could do or what to see
Everything is new to me

Twisted on the sidewalk by myself
Feels like Im moving backwards on a foggy road
Wishing that I could ask somebody for help
But Im moving backwards on a foggy road
