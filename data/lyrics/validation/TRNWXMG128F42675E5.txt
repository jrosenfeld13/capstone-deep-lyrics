[Verse]
I'm packing up my bags now
Cause I can't take it any more
Yes I'm picking up my suitcase
And I'm heading out the door

[Chorus]
I know you don't love me
I know you don't love me

[Verse]
Don't look for me at school
Don't look for me at friends'
Next time that you hear from me
I'll be working for the man
Do you understand now?!

[Chorus]
Father don't love me
Brother don't love me
I know you don't love me
Yeah you don't love me

[Verse]
When you try to find me
I'll be nowhere to be found
If you really really want me
Gonna have to hunt me down

[Chorus]
I know you don't love me
I know you don't love me
It's true you don't love me
I feel you don't love me
