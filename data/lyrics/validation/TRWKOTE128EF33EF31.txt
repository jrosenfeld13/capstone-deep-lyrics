One hundred million times I said it to you
There's nothing else I will do for you
How many times do you have to hear from me
There's nothing you can do to keep me here
All violations and degradations
All confrontations are decimating

I feel so sick inside, I feel so undermined
You hold me to the edge of a knife
You make me suffer inside

Your tone of voice seems amplified
You think I'll succumb to all of your lies
One hundred million times I tasted deceit
And no one cares but for one other release
Not one insight of me, not one can make you see
Not one can make you bleed, not hundred silence you
Carry on the lean machine, carry on your lean machine
I carry on with my big dream
Like the stowaway no one's seen

I feel so undermined, I feel so sick inside
And I am misunderstood for times
No one seems to realize

That I'll get what I want and I got what I wanted to do
And I get what I want to do
And I get what I want them to do

No one destroys my dream
No one will destroy my dream
