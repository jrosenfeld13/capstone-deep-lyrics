Different kind of people
From all the world around
You're my kind of people
And love is what we found

Is everybody here with me
This is how it's got to be
This is how we make a mark in history
I think it's time to realize
We're looking for the same enough

We want to, we need to be free

You can say what you wanna do what you wanna be
What you wanna be, but look again
We're two of a kind!
You can dance how you wanna sing
But you wanna love, we wanna love but look again
We're two of a kind!

Sexy, hungry people dance to cast away
If you two is tomorrow
So let's party all today

Is everybody here with me
This is how it's got to be

We want to, we need to be free

You can say what you wanna do what you wanna be
What you wanna be, but look again
We're two of a kind!
You can dance how you wanna sing
But you wanna love, we wanna love but look again
We're two of a kind!

You know we're all in this together
To make this world a little better
We must remember where we came from
Are we headding for the light or for the stars?

You can say what you wanna do what you wanna be
What you wanna be, but look again
We're two of a kind!
You can dance how you wanna sing
But you wanna love, we wanna love but look again
We're two of a kind!
Yeah!
