Like most nights it was dark and misty
I stuck by the window of bus 60
A busload of people heading home from work
Were looking out on this town's empty streets
Struck by a red light
We wait for a while
Side by side with

Now, i just couldn't believe my eyes
When out through the door stepped
The king and the queen
Now i'm not a friend of the monarchy system
But it was so so so strange to see them
To my suprise i yelled straight out
Look it's the king and the queen

Now the entire bus is staring out the window
The bus driver missed his green
Oh it was such unusual sight
Gothenburg with the king and the queen
