I can hear the silence in the dark
Closing in the distance to my heart
Now and than a quick glance at the stars
Coming of a deep trance, peace at large

Like a soothing shelter over me
I have come to love her mystery
Making me surrender, letting go
Guiding me so tender, very slow

When the night is falling
I hear voices calling
Like an aimless shooter
I'm a Twilight Cruiser

Night is falling, voices calling
Like an aimless shooter, Twilight Cruiser
I'm a Twilight Cruiser
Like an aimless shooter
