Standing on our own
We've witnessed a change
In the way we live our lives
We have abandoned everything

You only see what your heart will let you
Free your heart
Your soul condemned by hatred like a rusted knife
Impaled in our wounds

And we see in our hearts and in our dreams
Take us back when time was born
Take us back and there is so much more
We have witnessed everything
What's in our hearts

You try to be something that you can't be
Free your heart
Standing on our own
Free your heart
