[Verse 1]
I'm not the one who made the world what it is today
I'm not the one who caused the problems started long ago
But now I deal with all the consequence that troubles our times
I carry on and never once have even questioned why

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, I'm innocent
But the weight of the world is on my shoulders
Yeah, yeah, I'm innocent
The battles started are far from over

[Verse 2]
We're not the ones who leave the homeless in the streets at night
We're not the ones who've kept minorities and women down
Still we grow and then the problems, they become our own
We carry on without even realizing why

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, we're innocent
But the weight of the world is on our shoulders
Yeah, yeah, we're innocent
The battles left us are far from over

[Chorus] x2

[Outro]
We're not the ones whose pollution blackened our skies and ruined our streams
We're not the ones who made the nuclear bombs that threaten our lives
We're not the ones who let the children starve in faraway lands
We're not the ones who made the streets unsafe to walk at night
And even if we try and not become too overwhelmed
And if we make some contribution to the plight we see
Still, our descendents will inherit our mistakes of today
They'll suffer just the same as we and never wonder why!
