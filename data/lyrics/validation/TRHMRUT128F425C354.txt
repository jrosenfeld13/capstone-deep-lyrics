Rainbows in the sky, ice tea in July
Watching shooting stars can be so much fun
But they don't mean a thing if you're not with me
You're a miracle, you're number one

You are number one
(You are my one and only one)
You are number one
(There will never be another you)

You are number one
(You and me, you and me belong together)
You are number one
(We'd meet, we'd meet each other)

We are living in a world
Spinnin' 'round from day to day
(Spinning around)
Inside the Milky Way
And if the world catches you off guard
And spins you off, I will bring you back

If I think of all the things that mean so much to me
The words don't mean as much as actions, actually

Rainbows in the sky, ice tea in July
Watching shooting stars can be so much fun
But they don't mean a thing if you're not with me
You're a miracle, you are number one

You are number one
(My baby, well, well, well, well)
You are number one
(I wanna tell the world about my girl)

You are number one
(You're my number one, my only one)
You are number one
(Ooh)

You are number one
(Happy, happy, happy as a baby)
You are number one
(I'm gonna stay with you, honey, till eternity)

(My world)
You are number one
(I'm so glad I found you, be my baby, yeah)
You are number one
(Hey guys, tell the world one more time, how I feel about my lady)

You are number one
