Stranger
People talk about Him
And His ways they can't explain
Others come against Him
And His reckless claim to fame
He's an axiom
He's the maximum
He's a rebel and He's got a cause
Don't try to lock Him up
He's the One who makes the laws

Stranger
You've gone a little to far
Stranger
Who do You think You are?

They didn't understand Him
Though His words were plain to see
Because of this they made a plan
To kill Him brutally
He was different
He was heaven-sent
And for this they took His life
But in the end
He rose again
His name was Jesus Christ

Don't know where You come from
You're a drifter born to roam
Stranger
You're a long, long way
Long, long way from home

I know there's something more
More than meets the eye
His words cut right through me
How can I deny?

I know who You are
Stranger
You come from afar
Stranger
The bright morning star
Stranger
I know who You are
Stranger
