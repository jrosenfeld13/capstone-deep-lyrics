You know I've (you know i've)
Got a little problem
I have to be the one
The second guy to none

And I've got
A pretty little girlfriend
Who tells me all the time
That she'll be forever mine

And she says

That your baby loves you
Yes your baby loves you
When you're baby loves you
Nothing's gonna hurt you

Sometimes
I lie with my eyes open
There's so much on my mind
My teeth begin to grind

And she'll console me
Repeating through my senses
Everything's ok
And I hear her say

When she says

That your baby loves you
Yes your baby loves you
When you're baby loves you
Nothing's gonna hurt you

When your baby loves you
All your dreams will come true
When your baby loves you
Nothing's gonna hurt you

Baby loves you

(guitar solo)

Love me tonight
Love me tonight
Come on my pretty baby
Love me tonight

Love me tonight
Love me tonight
Come on pretty darlin'
Love me tongiht

Love me tonight
Love me tonight
Come on my pretty baby
Love me tonight

Your baby loves you
When your baby loves you
When your baby loves you
Nothing's gonna hurt you

Your baby loves you
You dreams can come true
When your baby loves you
Nothing's gonna hurt you
