In their card game youre a chip
Youre a whore in which theyll slip
In their chess game youre a pawn
Falsely honoured truly scorned
In their dice game you theyll roll
Lie to Heaven goes your soul
Playing poker fuelled by lust
Theyll drink champagne youll be dust
In their card game what they win
Each wager is a sin
In their chess game youll be raped
For formation a strong shape
In their dice game your snakes eyes
Cannot see their greed and lies
Playing poker their desire
They dont care if you expire
