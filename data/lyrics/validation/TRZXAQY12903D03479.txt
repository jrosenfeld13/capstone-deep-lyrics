You look in my eyes and I get emotional inside
I know it's crazy but you still can touch my heart
And after all this time you'd think that I wouldn't feel the same
But time melts into nothing and nothing's changed
I still believe, someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
Each day of my life, I'm filled with all the joy I could find
You know that I am not the desperate type
If there is one spark of hope left in my grasp, I'll hold it with both hands
It's worth the risk of burning to get a second chance
I still believe, someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
I had a dream of you and me
We were having love again
Oh, Close your eyes and see there
After all, I know that you still care
If we believe that true love never has to end
Then we must know that we will love again
Wo-oh, I still believe, someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
I had a dream of you and me
We were having love again
I still believe, I still believe
