Everywhere I turn someone reminds me of you
I remember all the things that we used to do
I think I'm over you and then
I'm losing you all over again
I smell the fragrance of your sweet perfume
It still lingers in my lonely room
I think of things that might have been
And I'm losing you all over again
It feels just like it did the day you left
Over and over I can't help myself
It seems to me no matter what I try
I'm right back where I was the day you said goodbye
I tried to go with somebody new
I changed my hangouts and the things I do
Just when I think my heart will mend
I'm losing you all over again
It feels just like it did the day you left
Over and over I can't help myself
It seems to me no matter what I try
I'm right back where I was the day you said goodbye
I tried to go with somebody new
I changed my hangouts and the things I do
Just when I think my heart will mend
I'm losing you all over
Over and over... Again
