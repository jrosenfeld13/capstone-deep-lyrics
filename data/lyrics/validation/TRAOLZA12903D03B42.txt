Hearts gone astray, deep in hurt when they go
I went away, just when you, you need me so
You won't regret, I come back beggin' you
Won't you forget, welcome love we once knew

Open up your eyes then you realize
Here I stand with my everlasting love
Need you by my side, girl to be my bride
You'll never be denied, everlasting love

From the very start, open up your heart
Feel that you're part of everlasting love

Need a love to last forever
Need a love to last forever

Where life really flows, no one really knows
Till someone's there to show the way to lasting love
Like the sun it shines, endlessly it shines
You always will be mine, if eternal love

Whenever love went wrong, ours would still be strong
We'd have our very own everlasting love

Need a love to last forever
Need a love to last forever

Open up your eyes then you realize
Here I stand with my everlasting love
Need you by my side, girl to be my bride
You'll never be denied, everlasting love

From the very start, open up your heart
Be a lasting part of everlasting love
Whenever love went wrong, ours would still be strong
We'll have our very own everlasting love
