One, two, three, four

Well, if you don't like it
Go ahead, find yourself a saint
Go ahead, now try to find a boy
Who's gonna be what I ain't

Now what you need is
A plastic doll with a fresh coat of paint
Who's gonna sit through the madness
And always acts so quaint, I said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah"

With your new friend
You're really making a scene
And I see you bouncing around
From machine to machine

And you know they're never real, they're
Never what they seem
And you can try to generate some warmth
And you see just what I mean, I said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah"

And if I'm acting like a king
Well, that's cause I'm a human being
And if I want too many things
Don't you know that I'm a human being

And if I've got to dream
Baby baby baby yeah I'm a human being
And when it gets a bit obscene
I'm a human being

And I've just got to go around with my head hung down
Just like a human, babe, an unknown human being
And I can hold my head so high
'Cause I'm a human, a riff raff human being

Why won't you give me a little sip?
Why don't you try me on a drag of that cigarette?
Why don't you try to give me something that
I will never ever forget?

But now don't you blow it all on a million dollar bet
Because you're liable to lose it
On the best lovin' you've had yet
I'm beggin' yeah, yeah, oh yeah

And if I'm acting like a king
Well, that's 'cause I'm a human being
I want too many things
Don't you know that I'm a human being

And if I've got to dream
I said, "Well I'm a human being"
And when it gets a bit obscene
I'm a human being

And I've got to go around with my head hung down
Just like a human, babe an unknown human being
And I can hold my head so high
'Cause I'm a human, a riff raff human being

In fact I'm talking about the human race
You're trying to cover up the big disgrace
I said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah"
Oh, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon

Yeah, yeah, oh yeah
Well, I may think that this whole scene is
Just a too appalling for me
Or I may be the type who's just a mad about
Every little thing that I see

But I can color that with mystery
Or make it just what I want it to be
While I'm blowing my change on the fan magazines
With all the Hollywood refugees screaming, "Yeah, yeah, oh yeah"

And if I'm acting like a king
I said, "Well, I'm a human being"
And if I want too many things
Don't you know that I'm a human being

If I've got to dream
Baby, baby, baby, I'm a human being
And when it gets a bit obscene
I'm a human being

I'm a human being
I'm a human being
I'm a human being
I'm a human being
