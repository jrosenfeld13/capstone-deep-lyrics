I, I wanna war, between the rich and the poor
I wanna fight and know what I'm fighting for
In a class war

This war, that war, class war, last war

And here we are
In L.A
City Hall's falling down
There is no escape
When a class war comes to town
Class War
Class war
Class war
This war, that war, class war, last war

If I'm told to kill
A Cuban or African
There'll be a class war
Right here in America
Class war
Class war
Class war
Class war
Class war
Class war
Class war
Class war
Class war
Class war
