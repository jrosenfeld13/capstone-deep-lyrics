(Wehrkamp, Cadden-James, LaBrie)

In the early misty morning
As you open your eyes I am there

Another day in a cold uncaring world
Dark treasons cold unhearted ways

I stand before your providence
Nobody comes, nobody goes

You're so bright eyed and innocent
There's a side of life you just don't know

Draw yourself close to me
I'll take them all, I'm not afraid
Your faith is all I need
I'll simply lay my life down for you
And never turning away
I'm your guardian angel
I'm your guardian angel

I dream of a place of simple love
Detached from the wicked and the bad

Lost out in a storm of sinfulness
Where is the kindness we used to have?
Have

Your life is sworn to me
I'll take them all, I'm not afraid
I'll give you all I need
And when the rest have left you for dead
You can count on me

I'll never leave, never go
Wrap yourself around my world
Now go to sleep in my arms tonight
So when it's hard, when it's cold
When you're so afraid just close your eyes
Rest easy child and know I'm by your side

I hear you weep
Dreaming among the stars
And I see your smile in the sun
I hope you'll understand
Someday far down the road
That I showed you love
All the while
All the while... with me

I'll never leave, never go
Wrap yourself around my world
Now go to sleep in my arms tonight
So when it's hard, when it's cold
When you're so afraid
Just close your eyes
Rest easy child and know I'm by your side

I'm your guardian angel

I dream of a place of simple love
Detached from the wicked and the bad, with love
Lost out in a storm of sinfulness, ooh
Where is the kindness we used to have?
