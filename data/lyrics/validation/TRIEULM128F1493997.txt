Paroles de la chanson River Phoenix :
Awake when the city sleeps
This hotel is dangerous
Pity poor Toms doing favours for sailors
These walls are paper thin
Next door theres a bakery
I can go n get coffee
But it wouldn hurt me
If I only today, I eman only today
Went first for a bloody Mary

Electroshocks in the sun
You can fry an eg on the pavement
It might just be too hot for me
Never been to Paris
But what a great name to put on a girl

And River Phoenix
What a great name to put on a boy
And River Phoenix
What a great name to put on a boy

Nobody owns the truth
(and the stars are dreaming)

The stars are dreamin
Nobody owns the truth

All the greats of heaven greets you
All the gates will open for you

Will you keep me companied stranger
If you do I feel lot better
Cos Im lost and I am lonely

Never been to Paris
But what a great name to put on a girl

And River Phoenix
What a great name to put on a boy
And River Phoenix
What a great name to put on a boy

Nobody owns the truth
(and the stars are dreaming)
The stars are dreamin
Nobody owns the truth

Turtle doves?
Everybodys cool with the new rules
