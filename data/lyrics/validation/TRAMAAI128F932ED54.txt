Twenty-two summers
And i hope you'll have a hundred more
Colors of this room will always follow

I hope we meet in the end
With wrinkles like the divas
And we'll dance again and again
In the end
In the end
Oh, oh, oh...

Days and months and years
And cities people love and fear
May god wherever she's out drinking always be
