I'm fed up, I've had it up to here
Tell me what is good for me and my career
Fuck you and your selfish advice
You've never been loyal to the same things twice
In your sheltered little lives, you don't know the scene
Doing as you're told, puppets of the big machine
Changing faces, revolving door hypocrisy
Who do you work for now, yeah, I see

Chorus I:
Music's for you and me
Not the fucking industry
You fucking tell us what is cool
You see we come from different schools
You got no crowd but you got a big push
Kissing asses till your pride turns into mush
You might change your style for the record company
Fingers down your throat, you heave your integrity
You're weak, give it up, throw the towel and the flag in
And get your pussy ass off the motherfuckin' bandwagon
Never for a minute were you real in the first place
So far up someone's ass you got shit on your face

Chorus II:
Music's for you and me
Not the fucking industry
You fucking tell us what is cool
You see we come from different schools
To us it matters what you say
Not the fucking games you play
You're full of shit, it's plain to see
The whole damn fucking industry
If you think for a minute this song's about you
Step the fuck back, cuz it's probably true
The message in the music is the reason that we're in this
That's what matters to us, not business
Music is for you and me, not the fucking industry
Try to tell us what is cool, we come from different schools
It only matters what you say, not the fuckin' games you play
Full of shit, it's plain to see, the whole damn fuckin' industry
Chorus II
