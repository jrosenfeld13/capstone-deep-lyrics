Thank you very much
Ladies and gentlemen
You know, we're mighty
Glad to be here today

And although we're
The stars of the show
We know that that
Ain't all there is to it

Because behind every star
As behind every great man
There is a woman

And I want to tell you out there
That if you are a man
You've got a woman

And I think you should take
A little time out to salute that woman
And give that woman a
Great big round of applause

There's a lot of plastic faces of every kind
And as you walk around the stage of life
Don't it kind of make you feel proud

You know no matter what the problems
There's one who understands
And you can rest assured, feel secure
She'll make you her only man

Give your baby a standing ovation
And she's sure to give a hand to you
Oh, give your baby a standing ovation
And she's sure to give a hand to you

When you can't get no satisfaction
And your world is full of gloom
She gives you strength and confidence
When she walks into the room

From the roar of a thousand voices
Comes a sound you've learned to know
When she calls your name
You can't feel no pain
You gotta smile and a standing O

Give your baby a standing ovation
And she's sure to give a hand to you
Oh, give your baby a standing ovation
And she's sure to give a hand to you

Stand up and give a hand
Stand up and give a hand
Stand up and give your lady a standing
Standing ovation, standing ovation

You know no matter what the problems
There's one who understands
And you can rest assured, feel secure
She'll make you her only man

So give your baby
Baby, baby, a standing ovation
And she's sure to give a hand to you

I don't know about you
But I'm gonna give my baby
A standing ovation
And she's sure to give a hand to you

Stand up and give your baby
A standing ovation
And she's sure to give a hand to you
