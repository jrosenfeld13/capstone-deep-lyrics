I'm in love again
This time I mean it in love again
So in love again
What lies between us is discovering
This time it's for real

I know I have said these words before
And if you're keeping score, that makes four
And the count down goes on
But this time, I swear the die is cast
I'll make it last forevermore of that I'm sure

I'm in love again
This time I mean it in love again
So in love again
What lies between us is discovering
This time it's for real

It was love
I knew without a glance
Should I speak of romance?
Take a chance
What if you run away"
But I was sure this love was meant to be
For you and me, eternally, so heavenly

I'm in love again
This time I mean it in love again
So in love again
What lies between us is discovering
This time it's for real

I refuse to dwell upon the past
'Cause time moves much too fast
It won't last...in a twinkling it's gone
When it's gone, I want it said of me:
I tried to be the best I could, not always could

I'm in love again
This time I mean it in love again
So in love again
What lies between us is discovering


Ooo--you know you know it. You know you know it. I'm in love it's true, in love with you. Ooo baby--I can feel it in my bones. Now that I've got you I won't ever be alone. Ooo--said I'm in love...said I'm in love...so in love with you
