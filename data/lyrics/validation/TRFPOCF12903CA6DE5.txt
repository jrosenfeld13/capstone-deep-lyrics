Would I be standing here
After all these years
Among the stars above?
Maybe not if it wasn't for your love

Smiling faces are all around
Like when a king has just been crowned
And the battle has been won
That I'd have lost if it wasn't for your love

A fairytale unfolds
More true than stories I've been told

At last my chance to shine
And all in perfect time
I live the life I once dreamed of
Who'd have thought
If it wasn't for your love
Yes, it was

Oh what a wonderful surprise
To see a light so bright it blinds
It blinds my eyes

But finally I see
Just how it feels to live a dream
But would I have touched the sky?
Ever flown so high
No, not I, if it wasn't for your love
No, no, if it wasn't for your love
