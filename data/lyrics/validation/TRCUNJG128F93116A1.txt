Hull

I'm gonna give up my citizenship, I'm gonna take it to the boss
Gonna throw it down to her table, and ask her how much it cost
Gonna burn up my uniform
Gonna walk the streets in the raw
I'm gonna declare war at the president's door
'cause that's what presidents are for

Chorus:
It' a stormy, weather, come on boys it's time that we all pull together
Stormy, weather, whether and it's all that we've got it's now or never

I'm gonna give her a four minute warning, she don't know about the temper I got
If she don't see sense by the morning, gonna take her out and I have her shot
'Cause I reached the end of my tether
I always try to be a patient man
But when the lunatics are running the show
You have to show them the strongest hand

Chorus:
It' a stormy, weather, come on boys it's time that we all pull together
Stormy, weather, whether and it's all that we've got it's now or never

Gonna line up all their cruise missiles, in a neat and tighty row
I'm gonna flick them up with my fingers, like a pack of Jacka's dominoes
I'm gonna smash their death machines
I'm gonna pull their planes apart
I'm gonna twist their arms, gonna bend their ears
Gonna break their little hearts

Chorus: reapet 6 x
