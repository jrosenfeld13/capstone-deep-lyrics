You think you haven't changed
You think I'm being sentimental
You've finally reached that age
Security is fundamental

You think you haven't changed
You think that you're just growing older
You wanted to be safe
But it turned you into someone colder

You're so busy these days
Rearranging your place
Can you still find some space for yourself
You think you haven't changed

Is anyone to blame
I'd really like to think it's you
But it seems like that's the way
Everyone but me is going

You're so busy these days
Rearranging your face
Do you still see a trace of yourself

I'm losing all of you
To future plans and obligations
I guess that's what you do
When life's about your next vacation

You're so busy these days
Rearranging your place
Can you still find some space for yourself

You're so busy these days
Rearranging your face
Do you still see a trace of yourself

You think you haven't changed
You think you haven't changed
