Sometimes all has to break down
To hear the depth without a sound
To feel the light you even cannot see

Directions change without a trace
Carving deep into your face
The hands of time will not get only me

Gotta hear the crawling monster
Just made to ruin control
Beware to keep your vision clear

Hell brakes loose tonight
Resurrection
Dream and truth collide
Resurrection
Give me eyes to see
Resurrection
To find an aim for me
Resurrection

Sometimes you will need to cry
To read that line the past provides
The vision is you got to hold on to... hold on

Gotta hear the crawling monster
Just keep your trace and keep control
So risk an ear and you will hear

Hell brakes loose tonight
Resurrection
Dream and truth collide
Resurrection
Give me eye to see
Resurrection
To find an aim for me
Resurrection

-Solo-

Hell brakes loose tonight
Resurrection
Dream and truth collide
Resurrection
Give me eyes to see
Resurrection
To find an aim for me
Resurrection
