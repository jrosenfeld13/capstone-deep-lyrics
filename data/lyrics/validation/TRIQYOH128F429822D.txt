Do you call this love
When heartache is only sound I hear
Lonely footsteps echo
A dream lost in time
How can I explain
My feelings
When my backs against the wall
How can I stay sane when Ive
Nearly lost my mind

Why cant you see
What this masquerade is doing to you
And me

Empty rooms
Empty rooms
Filled with sadness
And stale perfume
We knew it went wrong
For much too long
Yes we took a ride on a fairytale
But now the fairytale is through
How can you deny
Your anger
Its burning in your eyes
How will we survive it
This holocaust tonight

Do you think the flame
Can save you
From looking in your soul
Can you call it shamefull cause
I refuse to fight

But I loved you
You know its true
Yeah i really loved you
But we cant ignore this love anymore
Each time we walk into

Empty rooms
This empty rooms
Filled with sadness
And stale perfume
We knew it went wrong
For much too long
Yes we took a ride on a fairytale
But now the fairytale is through
Empty rooms
Empty rooms
Where laughter fades too soon
Empty rooms
Each time we walk into
This empty rooms
Where laughter fades too soon
Empty rooms
Each time we walk into
Empty rooms
