Remembering back on your life
At a time things were different then
Wasn't sure what time would bring
But you knew it couldn't be the same
The feelings you had, the power they held
Knew deep down inside no matter how you tried
It just wouldn't last, the magic would die
You hoped it wouldn't happen, didn't want it to go away
Prayed it wouldn't happen, didn't want it to go away
Like everything else their memory begins to fade
So much time has gone away so many things had to change
Now what are you gonna do
Sit around and mope or get off your ass
Stop feeling sorry for yourself
You know you want it back but theres nothing you can do
You've got to stop living in the past
And go on with the rest of your life
It's just fact of life
You've gotta accept the fact
That things aren't going to have to stay the same
And you're not the only one in hoping they would stay
Why can't you put as much power of your feelings
Into something useful to make an effort
To overcome and make a new life for yourself
Just because things aren't the same
Doesn't mean they can't be as good or even better
Rise above the change don't let it keep holding you back forever
Once you see you can fully control your fate
Then you'll know that you should just do the best you can
And you'll find out that that it's not so bad
At least you'll know that you gave it your best shot
