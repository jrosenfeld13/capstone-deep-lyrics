Soon and very soon the wind's gonna stop
And soon and very soon my sin's gonna stop
And soon and very soon the ocean's gonna stop
(Come oh Jehovah Come oh Jehovah soon)
Soon and very soon the bleedin's gonna stop
And soon and very soon the clock's gonna stop
And soon and very soon Shalom's gonna drop
Soon and very soon Jehovah drop
Pumpin' the blood through my veins
Day to day as long as I get
As long as He wants as long as I have
I'll say it 'til the end (I'll proclaim 'til the end)
I'm not done yet
Takin' callin' breathin' the body
Straight to eternity
I'm not done I'll be finished in eternity
