Life has taken this road
And our lives are joines in the fight
We have heard the choir laughing
Their words are meaningless
We will always have each other
They truly think they always know
We will always be together
They will always be alone

Our dreams they bleed
But the wounds are real
Real inside
Our dreams they bleed
But the wounds will heal

Move without the need to
Try and justify our reasons
For how and why we do this
Their chill won't break us down
The catch is always cold
But their hearts are always colder
We can try and train our feelings
But the fact remains the same

(Chorus)
Life will never scar us
Despite their crys for justice
All the names they hide mean nothing
Their names are always fake

(Chorus)
