I want some seafood mama
An I don't mean no turnip greens
I want some seafood mama
An I don't mean no turnip greens
I want some fish, ooo-well-well
An you know just what I mean

I want fish, fish mama
I wants it all the time
I wants fish, fish mama
I wants good fish all the time
The people calls it seafood, woo-well-well
All up an down the line

If you love your seafood
You is a good friend of mine
If you love your seafood
You is a good friend of mine
If you don't love good fish, woo-well-well
You better get on some kinda time

I want some seafood, mama
Because I am a seafood man
I want some seafood, mama
Because I am the seafood man
When I can't get my seafood
I goes to raisin' sand

So bye-bye, people
I hope this July will find you well
Hm-mm, bye-bye people
I hope this July will find you well
Because the seafood I'm talkin' about
Ooo-well now, I swear it is a-burnin' hell
