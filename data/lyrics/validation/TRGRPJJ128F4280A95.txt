Your lie to me a so long time
I never believe the people took to me
Because you so lie
Leason the story about you
And the what....
You are so inosen poor girl
But remember that lie comes after lies you do to me
You provincial girl I give all my love
I'm empty because of you
Lie to me lie to me so long...
Came in my life so quiet
After silencio comes yours lies like storm to me...
Lie to me so sweet
But I guess I'm strong to live without you
