Written by Frost/Lucas

Holy soldiers united by hatred are
Turning against their king
Resorting to war to avenge their
Betrayal
Heavens in turmoil again
For eons they've waited the time is now
Ripe
The battle will surely commence
God's army divided the saints cry
Mercy
The vengeance of hell now begins

Wings ripped asunder they fall from
The sky
The question is which side will win
Battalions of demons have joined the
Attack
The balance disrupted by sin
Storming the gates and spilling sacred
Blood
Unholy rivals now come
The end beginning a new age soon born
Unveiling the sinister one

*Angelic fury turns heaven into
Second hell
Not a day like this since Lucifer fell

(repeat *)

There's a second war in heaven
Hear them marching beyond the clouds
There's a second war in heaven
God's thunder and fury resound
