Cause there I a house made of black stone
And it sits at the end of the road
I paint it red and it forgotten

Some say. That I disappear
That I disappear
That I disappear

This isn automatic
This is impossible
We all are far from tragic
We are like statues of

This isn automatic
This is impossible
We all are far from tragic
We are like statues of

It hard t ostand when it all in your head
Find that black house paint it red
It hard to feel when youe been through this much
Wanna talk, wanna touch
It hard to run when you can find your feet
And I don want your world on me

Cause on the inside. Everything white
And I loose myself in it light
I close the door and get forgotten. Some say
We are like statues of stone

This isn automatic
This is impossible
We all are far from tragic
We are like statues of

This isn automatic
This is impossible
We all are far from tragic
We are like statues of

This isn automatic
This is impossible
We all are far from tragic
We are like statues of

Statues of stone
