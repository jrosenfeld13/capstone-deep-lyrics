Why do you judge me?
It's time to get over yourself
Morals dissipating

Gives me eyes to get a closer look
Oh, I'll get a closer look

Why do you judge me this way? I don't know
I've made mistakes more than once

My views mismatch me
About time to get over myself
So much retribution

I'm only human
I can't offer you perfection
I can offer you a closer look into my view
I gave in one too many times
I rectify myself with guilt
But it's overwhelming me
