Baptized into the fire
I'm the chosen one by forgotten souls
I'm the burning beast who nailed
And crucified the angels of death

I am the eternal sin in heaven and hell
I'm always with you the dream that
Steals your truth

In hell!!!
Where the death and pain unite
The fire still burns inside
Damnation and decay
In hell!!!
Black shadows without souls
The darkness will reign their world
Destruction and despair
In hell!!!

For the sin my heart and my blood
For the evil my flesh and blood
I supplicate the cross
Of the holy church for eternity
