This is no Indian dream
This is no boat on the sea
Exploring you was never that easy

This is no silicon chip
This is no colonial ship
Exploring you was never that easy

We cannot swim to the shore
Every wave does ask for more
This vicious circle will be hard for us to break for sure

This is no pond or a lake
This is as much I can take
Exploring you was never that easy

This is no Amazon stream
This is what's left of our team
Exploring you was never that easy

We cannot swim to the shore
Every wave does ask for more
This vicious circle will be hard to break for sure

We cannot swim to the shore
Every wave does ask for more
This vicious circle will be hard to break for sure
