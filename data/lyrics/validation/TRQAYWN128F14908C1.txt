Take me downtown, why?
Broke the law, lock me up
Storyline, a comeby
A combination, it's a lie
I won't see no time for no foul police
None for a double time of a lifetime

Tonight, I'll walk
Sit down and let me know my rights

It's all about someone else
I know it, I know it
This sounds suspect, don't it?
I'll talk and give up on the stoolie in time

So spare the time and talk with me
I'll do anything you want so subtly
Yeah, I don't know
All I could think about is you

Why run? I'll hide
Checked out this one through sixty-five

It's all about someone else
I know it, I know it
This sounds suspect, don't right?
I'll talk and give up on the stoolie in time

So spare the time and talk with me
I'll do anything you want so subtly
Yeah, I don't know
All I could think about is you

Suspect and talk in tears
Suspect and talk in tears
Suspect and talk in tears
Suspect and talk in tears
Tears

Tears, I could swear
I wasn't thinking right, wasn't there
As for me asking you
Unbelievable, what you do

Tears, I could swear
I wasn't thinking right, wasn't there
As for me asking you
Unbelievable, what you do
A lifelong lie

So spare the time and talk with me
I'll do anything you want so subtly
So spare the time and talk with me
I'll do anything you want so subtly
Yeah, I don't know
All I could think about is you
