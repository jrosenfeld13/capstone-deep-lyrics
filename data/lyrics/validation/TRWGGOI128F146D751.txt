[Verse 1]
Please start dirty
Its 7:30
Loss of mind and
Cat alertly
My best, your rest
Send your call
And then I nest
Perversity in features
Adversity that teaches
Some call love more
Soon Ill call the rhythm song

[Chorus]
Its over
Its over now
So long to doo-doo-ra
Its over
Its over now
I dare not get a look

[Verse 2]
Be yourself
Some let her call
Never fall
See yourself
Sit alone and wait
To my own call
Go ballistic
Anarchistic
Smack my mouth and
Then you kissed it
So long, my gun
Simple run and
Letter bum
Things are looking good on paper
Once when I was in your favor
This kiss from a mess
Send my girl riddle less

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
See yourself
Sad, alone and wait
To my own brawl
Free yourself
Theres an only count
This stands for all of them
Just play at any tempo
Going mad and going mental
All balm, said no
Just to let him put it wrong

[Chorus]
