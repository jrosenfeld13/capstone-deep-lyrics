There's not a star in the sky
That could equal to the sparkle in your eyes
This card is only one way
To let you know just how I feel

Chorus

Will you be my valentine girl
And I'll give you my heart
Forever
Be my valentine girl
And I won't let you go
No never

All of the flowers I've sent
Could never take the place
Of being there
Although we only just met
You're everything to me

Chorus

Be my, my valentine girl
I need you
I want you
I want you in my world
Valentine girl

I'll be there for you
Will you be there for me too
Valentine girl

Until fade ...
