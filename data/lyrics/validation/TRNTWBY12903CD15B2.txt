Oh voyager sail away please
This pioneer tied to the breeze
I'm tired and I can't fight alone anymore

No haven or hideaway here
How fragile his skeleton feels
I've tried and tried
Now I can't fail anymore

Wonder when love passed you by
Wonder but keep your gun dry

Won't somebody share with me please
This journey's too long
For one set of heels
