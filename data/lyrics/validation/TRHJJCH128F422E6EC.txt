Buried in darkness, her deepest fear
(She became) one with the water, one with the sea
One became two, then two became one
Feared by all, but helped by no-one

Death surrounds her, everyone dies
Consumed by fear in the blink of an eye
Paralysed by her evil stare
How they died, no-one can tell

The curse was spread and visualised
Watch the images within seven days you'll die
Where does she come from, nobody knows...
But you will find out and then you'll burn down below

Buried in darkness, her deepest fear
(She became) one with the water, one with the sea
One became two, then two became one
Feared by all, but helped by no-one
