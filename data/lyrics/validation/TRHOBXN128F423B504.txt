This road is worn it's a long walk to home
Rest seems lost on my own
The world has no mercy for me
All I need is something to live for and stand by
A love that's true
I have passion for freedom
I want truth to set me free
This is where my feet slip
Where's my devotion to you?
What's truth. belief?
The point that stands
Beginning, reason
It's the breaking of a heart
I've been put down and let down
But I've been touched cared for and held onto
Cried many times "make this right"
Words were whispered "then change your fight"
All these things tie me down
"Hope deferred make the heart sick"
So keep me strong and sleeping on through the night
