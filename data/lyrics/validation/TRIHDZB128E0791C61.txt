[Verse 1]
In my head I was wastin' away
Who got lucky when I couldn't stay
Testify my reasons and my worries

I'm runnin' hot but there's nowhere to go
Walk that walk hopin' nobody knows
She was rich but I was beautiful
(gotta change the world around me)

[Chorus]
All the fun we never had (lookin' on back, child)
All the fun we never had (lookin' on back, child)
Cause I'm in love with the better half of me
Looking back on vanity

[Verse 2]
The wounds I'm feeling have troubled my plan
A longer distance ain't makin' the man
Should have tried to learn my lesson well

Amplified by the days on my own
Recognizin' my blood from my bone
She was rich but I was beautiful
(gotta change the world around me)

[Chorus]
All the fun we never had (lookin' on back, child)
All the fun we never had (lookin' on back, child)
Cause I'm in love with the better half of me
Looking back on vanity

[Bridge]

[Chorus x2]
