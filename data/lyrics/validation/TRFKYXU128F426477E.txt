I am super sad and I'm ultra mad
I'm down to my last resort and that means force if necessary
Life, it ain't pretty and there's nothing much left to scare me

Why do you refuse to believe
Even though I wear it on my sleeve
Can you answer me?
Ohh Can you answer me?

I've been told a million lies about a million times
Now is the pay back bitch, watch me come and get mine
Face the fate and give up the facade
Admit you're weak and wrong
You know I'm GOD

Why do you refuse to believe
Even though I wear it on my sleeve
Can you please answer me?
Answer me!

Don't feel so bad
Everyone makes mistakes
Don't you worry baby
Destiny will seal our fate

How many more times do I have to prove to you
Before I look stupid and you look like a fool?
