Darling, go home, your husband is ill
Is he ill? Let them give him a pill
Oh, come my dear Franz, just one more dance
Then I'll go home to my poor old man
Then I'll go home to my poor old man

Darling, go home, your husband is worse
Is he worse? Well I am no nurse
Oh, come my dear Franz, just one more dance
Then I'll go home to my poor old man
Then I'll go home to my poor old man

Darling, go home, your husband is dead
Is he dead? There's no more to be said
Oh, come my dear Franz, just one more dance
Then I'll go home to my poor old man
Then I'll go home to my poor old man

Darling, go home, the will's to be read
What's that you said? I said the will's to be read
Oh, no, no, my dear Franz, this is no time to dance
I must go weep for my poor old man
I must go weep for my poor old man
