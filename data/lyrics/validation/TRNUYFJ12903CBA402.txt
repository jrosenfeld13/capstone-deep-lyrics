The Only Way Is Up
We've been broken down
To the lowest turn
And been on the bottom line
Sure ain't no fun
But if we should be evicted from our homes
We'll just move somewhere else
And still carry on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Chorus
The only way is up, baby
For you and me now, baby
The only way is up
For you and me now
Now we may not know
Where our next meal is coming from
But with you by my side
I'll face what is to come
Boy, I wanna thank you
For loving me this way
Things may be a little hard now
But we'll find a brighter day
Hold on, hold on, hold on
The only way is up, baby
For you and me now
