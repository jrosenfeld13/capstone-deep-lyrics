In the distant
Far away
Trying to figure it out
But I can't explain
Now we see it
Now we don't
We're floating around
In the unknown zone

Watch the starlight
Shooting for the sky
Reaching out to catch
A piece of Paradise
Is it true
Or just imaginations
Visions twist around my mind
And brings me shelter from the night

Where do we go
Where do we go from here
When do we finally disappear

Oh future world
There's nothing left to save
They blew it all away
Future world
Tonight we're riding on
The final escape

Is it heaven
Is it hell
Is it the afterworld
Or just something else
Are we prisoners in Nowhereland
Where darkness is your only friend
Kept inside this wall of sleep
Have we fallen into a deep freeze

Left the wastelands
Broke the lines
Crossed the border to another time
Being drawn by the fates
Who run our destinies
Stranded in a state of life
Where dreams become reality

[Chorus]
In troubled times
We saw the writing on the wall
We heard the fools
Who brought the human race to fall
We'll build another generation
And not destroy the God creation

[Chorus]
Take your chances
Turn the key
Open up the doors
To another history
Here's no questions
No demands
Here's the future
This is wonderland
