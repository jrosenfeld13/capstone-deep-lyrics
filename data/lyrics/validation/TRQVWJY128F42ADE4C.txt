Darkness calls
And sheds its light on me
It makes me feel like what we had
Was really nothing at all
Now do you care, or am I in this alone
Well maybe I am
Oh if I am
Remember me
Remember all the times
All the endless nights
We didn't wanna sleep
Oh, remember me
And how I made you laugh
Until I made you cry...
We had everything
Now don't you ever forget

So this is love
It feels like agony
I want you here 'cause
The thought of you with someone else
Is hell on earth
I can't breathe
Knowing that you don't believe
In all that we had
So all that I ask
Is remember me
Remember all the times
All the endless nights
We didn't wanna sleep
Oh, remember me
And how I made you laugh
Until I made you cry
We had everything
Oh, but don't you ever forget

All of the memories
Are leaving me empty
Oh how I want you here right now
It gets so lonely
I need you to hold me
Everything else just brings me down

Ooohhhhh yeah

Remember me
Remember all the times
All the endless nights
We didn't wanna sleep
Oh remember me
And how I made you laugh
Until I made you cry
We had everything, everything
So don't you ever forget
Never, never forget
Remember me
