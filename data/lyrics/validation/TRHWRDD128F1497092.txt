Dreaming again
Asleep in his bed
A river of visions runs through his head

Strange as it seems
This chaos of dreams
Can change the course and shape of things

He sees with an eye only open at night
What breeds in the darkness
Blossoms in the light

Awake in the morning
Thrust without warning
Into life all over again
Still chasing pleasure
Running from pain
Though I know they're both the same

Then the fog rolls away
And I'm here in today
Thinking I can see how dreams become reality
Since I opened up my eyes
It's time to arise
And show that I'm
Not just

Dreaming, dreaming again
Hey, hey, yeah
Dreaming, dreaming again
Waking up and
Dreaming (Dreaming again)
Dreaming again
Dreaming (Dreaming again)
Dreaming again

Dreaming (Dreaming again)
Dreaming again
Waking and dreaming again
Dreaming (Dreaming again)
Dreaming again
Dreaming again
Dreaming (Dreaming again)
Dreaming again
Dreaming again
Dreaming (Dreaming again)
Dreaming again
Dreaming again

Waking up and
Dreaming (Dreaming again)
Dreaming again
Dreaming again
Dreaming (Dreaming again)
Dreaming again
Dreaming again
Dreaming (Dreaming again)
Dreaming again
Dreaming again
