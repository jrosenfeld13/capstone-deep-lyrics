[Intro]
Until the day I die
Until the day I die

[Verse 1]
So every single day begins and ends the same
I see them pushing to get on board a crowded train
Out of the pouring rain, to face another pain
Why you so afraid of the other side?
It's just a big parade, it's people on display
If one should stumble imagine what the rest would say
They're making harmless sounds, their heads go round and round
Why do you stay away from the other side?

[Chorus]
Now you have to believe in me
I'll live until the day I die
You have to believe in me
I'll live until the day I die
Until the day I die

[Verse 2]
You'll see me in the clouds laughing a bit too loud
You'll see me crying 'cause I'm too crazy to be proud
Today I'll celebrate, tomorrow is too late
I'll be out there pushing the borderline
Postponing is a crime, who knows if I have time
When this is over, I hope I never walked the line
So call me immature, at least I know for sure
I'll be crossing over the borderline

[Chorus]
Now you have to believe in me
I'll live until the day I die
You have to believe in me
I'll live until the day I die
Until the day I die, I do believe

[Bridge]
I hear everybody say that today is the day
And sooner or later my luck is gonna change
Well, that day is never near if you're living by your fear
Stand up and shout you're alive

[Chorus]
Until the day I die
Now you have to believe in me
I'll live until the day I die
You have to believe in me
I'll live until the day I die
Now you have to believe in me
I'll live until the day I die
You have to believe in me
I'll live until the day I die
