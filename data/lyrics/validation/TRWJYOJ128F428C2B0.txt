I want to know where you laid your head last night
You just couldn't keep him in your bloodstream or in your eyesight, behindsight
It's glue that holds you so close to nowhere
All the chemicals have been depleted you look so defeated my boy
And now you're so tired of life, your soul's been burnt by desire
When you laid down beside her inside her and you got so mad
You drove your car so fast that you smashed into heaven
And then you descended
My boy, you laid down inside her, beside, you turn empty inside
Your words return ever hollow...the truth's so hard to swallow
So hard now pull the babies from their beds
Your teeth just rot inside your head
You're just some bones and skind that walk narrow
Your path and staggering walk
Born so alive, but raised to be dead
