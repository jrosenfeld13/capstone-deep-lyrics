[Verse 1]
Bashful Betty such a bondage brat
Dressed in latex and coated in sewer rats
A serpents tounge, calculating mind
Gets top dollar for the hip shake divine
Look to the sky
There's no rain in sight
Better wear your rubber boys
If Betty is your date tonight

[Chorus]
My honey, it's how ya making money
Boys call you
Hell on high heels
My baby, the way you walk it talk it
Town calls you
Hell on high heels

[Verse 2]
Sexy suki little geisha girl
Giving every samurai a twirl
An HIV, VIP
Backseat panties down around her knees
She hasn't got no money
Can't pay her rent
It's a sunny day now baby
Every night on her back that's spent

[Chorus][x5]

[Bridge]
My baby, the way you walk it talk it
Walk it, talk it oh yeah
Town calls you
Hell on high heels
(Hell on high, high, high heels

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh baby nice shoes
