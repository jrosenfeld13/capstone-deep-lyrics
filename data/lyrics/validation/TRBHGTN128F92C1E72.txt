I want you to keep a piece of me
In there, right below your majesty
I may tend to it with flattery
Or maybe I'll jump start, counting on a battery

What's right, unglue, what's left, breakthrough
Brake up, brakedown, let up, leave town
Oh, fuck, got stuck, you lose, tough luck
The odds were in your favor
The taste was in your savor
How bitter is that swill?
And it's dragging me to you
Don't let me go
Black hole, falling in
Don't let me go
If I'm wrong again
Don't let me go
Even if it pulls you in
Don't let me go
Baby, don't let me go

If you don't, you can say you didn't quit
And I'm likely to be needing it
So sorry, but when I let go
I thought you'd know
How to follow
Did you swallow?
It's gone
Head rush
Can't see
This crush
Will prove I was unworthy
And what I did was usury
I'm sorry for that too
But it's dragging me to you
Don't let me go
Black hole, falling in
Don't let me go
If I'm wrong again
Don't let me go
Even if it pulls you in
Don't let me go
Baby, don't let me go
My baby, don't let me go
