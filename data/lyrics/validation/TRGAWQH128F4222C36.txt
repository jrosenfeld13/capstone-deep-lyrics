Center is where I see myself in the beginning
I'm sitting in the middle of a crowded room
Nobody hears me, trying to reach out
Just trying to scream out

I'm so pathetic is how I see myself, I'm just a joke
I'm running out this life, people tell me not to waste it
But how can I taste it when I never lived
When I never loved, when I never lied

I'm just a stain ,I'm trying to make my mark
On a spot that's been dark for a long time
Been a long time since a panic
Broken down a systematic life that god gave to me

So try to save my faith
That's going out the window, that I'm looking down from
One more step and I'll be on the ground from a sinner
To try to make a true believer
Well, ho, I never was

You'll probably run and hide
You'll probably run and hide

Life reality hits me in the stomach
Aches like a fist in my mouth
I should have said nothing
To make everything fall apart in my face

Well, you're the one who's crying
So try to see the world from the flip side
Running out of line with no one ever watching my back
Ah, cold muther fucker never seem to realize
I'm not your wannabe

You'll probably run and hide
You'll probably run and hide

So mad and so real
I'm so mad and then we hide

Center is where I see myself in the beginning
I'm sitting in the middle of a crowded room
Nobody hears me, trying to reach out
Just trying to scream out

I'm so pathetic is how I see myself, I'm just a joke
I'm running out this life, people tell me not to waste it
But how can I taste it when I never lived
Oh, fucking lie!

You'll probably run and hide
You'll probably run and hide

You'll probably run and hide
You'll probably run and hide

You run, I hide
You run, I hide
