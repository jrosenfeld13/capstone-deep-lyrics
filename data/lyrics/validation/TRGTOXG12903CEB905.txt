[Intro]
I don't need no doctor
'Cause I know what's ailing me
I don't need no doctor, no no
'Cause I know what's ailing me

[Verse 1]
I've been too long away from my baby, ah
I'm coming down with a misery

[Chorus 1]
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

[Chorus 2]
I don't need no doctor
For my prescription to be filled

[Chorus 1]
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

[Chorus 2]
I don't need no doctor, I tell you now
For my prescription to be filled

[Chorus 1]
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

[Verse 2]
Only my baby's arms
Could ever take away this chill

[Chorus 1]
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

[Verse 3]
Now the doctor say I need rest (Hey, hey)
Before I need her tenderness
Put me on the critical list (Hey, hey)
When all I need is her sweet kiss
He gave me a medicated lotion
But it didn't soothe (It didn't soothe)
My emotion

[Chorus 1]
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

[Verse 4]
I don't need no doctor
For my hope to live is gone

[Chorus 1]
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

[Verse 4]
I don't need no doctor, no no
For my hope to live is gone

[Chorus 1]
I don't need no doctor
I don't need no doctor

[Verse 5]
All I need is my baby
Baby, please
Won't you please come on home

[Chorus 1]
I don't need no doctor (You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?)
I don't need no doctor

[Verse 6]
I don't need no Aspirins (I don't need no doctor)
I don't need no lotion (I don't need no doctor)
I say, I don't need (I don't need no doctor)
No vitamin pills (I don't need no doctor)
I don't need (I don't need no doctor)
Yeah, no babysitter (I don't need no doctor)

[Outro]
All I need (I don't need no doctor)
All I need (I don't need no doctor)
Yeah, my baby child (I don't need no doctor)
I don't need no surgery (I don't need no doctor)
I don't need no implants (I don't need no doctor)
