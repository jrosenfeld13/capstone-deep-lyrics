Under your protective wing I walked into the night
And a thousand angry demons up and took flight
I went running through the fields with the fever in my veins
And the rain came crashing down and tried to clear my name
Above my head, all in red, I could see you bearing down on me
You said you're not running out, you said you're not leaving now
I will find you, there is no way
I'll keep tracking you down in the still of the night
Forever, you're mine forever

Don't leave your mark on me, no need to reply
I'm not staying, I'm just killing time
Don't leave your mark on me, no need to reply
I'm not staying, no, I'm not staying no
This nightmare never ends, memories of absent friends
Mistress of the darkness, accomplice of the night
A shadow in the doorway beckons me inside
And something led the way though I couldn't see its face
And a voice from deep inside me screamed to get out of this place
In my head, someone said that the jailor turned the key on me
He said you're not running out, he said you're not leaving now
I will find you, there ain't no way, no way, yeah
Don't leave your mark on me, no need to reply
I'm not staying, I'm just killing time
Don't leave your mark on me, no need to reply
I'm not staying, no, I'm not staying no

This nightmare never ends, memories of absent friends

Don't leave your mark on me
(Nightmares that will never end, drink a toast to absent friends)
