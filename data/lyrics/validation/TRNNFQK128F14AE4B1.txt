The Lord God said when time was full
He would shine His light in the darkness
He said a virgin would conceive
And give birth to the promise

For a thousand years the dreamers dreamt
And hoped to see His love

But the promise showed their wildest dreams
Had simply not been wild enough
The promise showed their wildest dreams
Had simply not been wild enough

The promise was love and the promise was life
The promise meant light to the world
Living proof Jehovah saves
For the name of the promise was Jesus

The faithful one saw time was full
And the ancient pledge was honored
So God the Son, the incarnate one
His final Word, His own Son

Was born in Bethlehem
But came into our hearts to live

What more could God have given
Tell me what more did He have to give
What more could God have given
Tell me what more did He have to give

The promise was love and the promise was life
The promise meant light to the world
Living proof Jehovah saves
For the name of the promise was Jesus

The promise was love and the promise was life
The promise meant light to the world
Living proof Jehovah saves
For the name of the promise was Jesus
Living proof Jehovah saves
For the name of the promise was Jesus
