Hey Hollywood
Youre so hip and cool
Thanks for having me over
Some of you are from the seventies
Seven, eight and nine
Hey Hollywood
It is truly a pleasure
I know you hate the beach
Cities and little old me
From the Salton Sea
You must have heard
I was sleazy

[Chorus:]
Lights, camera, action
I can't get no satisfaction
Man this played out town
I love the way it gets me down
Hey Hollywood
You got rock'n'roll
Denny's I like my fries with blue cheese
Xxx porno on western
AA and heroin too
Hey Hollywood
I'll be seein' ya real soon
Now that your hipsters are movin' east L.A
You'd better beware
I hear they're movin' in

[Chorus]
