[Chorus 1]
They'll laugh as they watch us fall
The lucky don't care at all
No chance for fate
It's unnatural selection
I want the truth!

[Refrain]
I am hungry for some unrest
I want to push it beyond a peaceful protest
I wanna speak in a language that they'll understand

Dedication, to a new age!
Is this the end of destruction and rampage?
Another chance to erase it then repeat it again

[Pre-Chorus]
Counter balance this commotion
We're not droplets in the ocean

[Chorus 1]
They'll laugh as they watch us fall
The lucky don't care at all
No chance for fate
It's unnatural selection
I want the truth!

[Verse 2]
No religion or mind virus
Is there a hope that the facts will ever find us?
Just make sure that you are looking out for number one

[Refrain]
I am hungry for some unrest!
Let's push it beyond a peaceful protest
I wanna speak in a language that you will understand

[Pre-Chorus]
Counter balance this commotion
We're not droplets in the ocean

[Chorus 2]
They'll laugh as they watch us crawl!
The lucky don't share at all
No hope for fate, its a random chance selection
I want the truth!

[Verse 3]
Try to ride out the storm
Whilst they'll make you believe
That they are the special ones. (we have not been chosen)
Injustice is the norm
You won't be the first and you know you won't be the last

[Refrain]
Ocean! Ocean! OCEAN!

[Chorus 1]
I want the truth! I want the truth! I want the truth!
