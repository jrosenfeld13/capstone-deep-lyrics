Lately I'm finding sunlight where you are
Say that you'll shine it give it up and ride
Been on a rhythm and I just can't fight it
Been on a feeling that's so special
And I believe it you give me the night oh yea gotta let you know

(Chorus)
We are so far and I'm taking a ride to where you are
So far we are and I'm taking a ride to where you are
We are so far and I'm taking a ride to where you are
So far we are and it's taking me right into your sunshine
Maybe you're hiding from something in the stars
Reaching for someone that knows just who you are
Been on a rhythm and I just can fight it
Been on a feelin that I can't deny
If you believe it then just let it show oh yea gotta let you know

(Chorus)
