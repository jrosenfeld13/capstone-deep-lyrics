Pictures blurred in her head
Won't let them win
Smash a fist or two
Right back and let it in
For the one that you love
Is more than them fuck them
Think about her now
She's yours anyway
-
And everything else doesn't matter
Really 'cause that girl that you want
She's never going away
And if you want her you can't have her
Break yourself into
A million pieces
Everything else can wait for you
So everything else can wait for you to do
This...
-
They will all just go away
All of the demons
Enjoy this life right now
You know what you're to do
And letters
Yes they matter write her quite a few
And she might love you for it
But you can't count on it

And everything else doesn't matter
Really 'cause that girl that you want
She's never going away
And if you want her you can't have her
Break yourself into
A million pieces
Everything else can wait for you
So everything else can wait for you to do
This...
-
And i'm screaming for the breath
That makes you alive
You want that girl
For all that you can try
Once you have her
I know she'll be so great for you
I know she'll try something
Inside you are everything else

And everything else doesn't matter
Really 'cause that girl that you want
She's never going away
And if you want her you can't have her
Break yourself into
A million pieces
Everything else can wait for you
So everything else can wait for you to do
This...
