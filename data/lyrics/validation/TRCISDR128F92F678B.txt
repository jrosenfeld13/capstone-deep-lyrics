Without warning
I can feel you're out of reach
It's alright your out of sight
With no reflection
Nobody knows me it's how I want to be
It's just a plan which no one believes
I'm not ready for this
I won't ever be

You keep calling
I can hear your ever word
It's alright I get threw life
With no reaction
Nobody knows me it's how I want to be
It's just a plan which no one believes
I'm not ready for this
I won't ever be
