[Intro]
Every time...

[Verse 1]
Everywhere you look these days
They're robots in disguise
Automata, no anima
The new age has arived
Your neighbor is afraid
And now you're scared to be too nice
If you can't take the blame for it
Then you shouldn't roll the dice

[Chorus]
Every time...

[Verse 2]
What you do and what you say
Don't always coincide
Once you take the veil away
There's nothing left to hide
Naked and afraid and now
You're forced to live in sin
Crucify the endless night in
The time of the assassins

[Chorus]
Every time...

[Outro]
The time of the assassins
Every time
The time of the assassins
Every time
