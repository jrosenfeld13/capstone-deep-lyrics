[Intro:]
The Blackness
Keep, keep on
Never say die
Keep, keep on
The blackness
Never say die
Keep, keep on
Keep, keep on
The Blackness
Never say die
Keep, keep, keep
Never say die
Keep, keep on
Never say die
The blackness
Keep, keep on
Never say die
Optimistic

[Verse 1:]
When in the midst of sorrow
You can't see up when looking down
A brighter day tomorrow will bring
You hear the voice of reason
Telling you this can never be done
No matter how hard reality seems
Just hold on to your dreams, yeah

[Pre-Chorus:]
Don't give up and don't give in
Although it seems you never win
You will always pass the test

[Chorus:]
As long as you keep your head to the sky
You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky
You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky
Be optimistic

[Verse 2:]
If things around you crumble
No, you don't have to stumble and fall
Keep pushing on and don't you look back
I know the storms and strife
Cloud up your outlook on life
Just think ahead and you'll be inspired
To reach higher and higher

[Pre-Chorus 2:]
You will always do your best
If you learn to never say never
You may be down, but you're not out
(That's what "optimistic" is all about)
Don't give up and don't give in
Although it seems you never win
You will always pass the test

As long as you keep your head to the sky
(Head to the sky, my my my)
You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky
(You can win child!)
You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky
(keep your head looking toward the sky)
You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky
(You can win, keep you head, face toward the sky)
Be optimistic
You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky
(Some will try to knock you, but you can win)
You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky
(Head up, keep on lookin' now, keep on lookin' now)
You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky
(Don't you let nobody sink it, hey hey)
You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky
(No time for looking back, gotta keep just... on and on and on and on)
You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky
(You can win... keep your head... hey, you can have your prize!)

You can win, yes
Never say die
Keep your head
You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky
Be optimistic!
You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky
(You gotta keep your head to the sky!)
You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky
Be optimistic!
You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky
Be optimistic!
You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky
(I just know that you can win if you keep your head)
You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky
Be optimistic!
You can win as long as you keep your head to the sky

Uh huh... yeah!
