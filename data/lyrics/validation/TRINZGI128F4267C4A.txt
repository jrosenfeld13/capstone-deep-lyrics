Hey Oh yeah
Ooh, ey ey

Oh!
They gon' know who we are (ey, Ow!)
Oh!
They gon' know who we are (ey, ey)

(Verse 1)
We're the ones you used to run from
Everyday at school, lookin so fresh, so clean, so cool
Still a menace to society, but that's fine with me
Cause we still fly as can be

(pre-hook)
Oh! (uh-oh) C'mon work that body
C'mon get naughty
(oh) C'mon work that body, c'mon get nuaghty
They gon know who we are!
(repeat)

(Hook)
Bet all ya'll folks won't admit it
But they wanna get in
If you wanna get wit it, We ghetto superstarz
See way back then they didn't know about
We girls used to throw down
But I bet you they know now
We ghetto superstarz

(Verse 2)
We're actin bad, we're ghetto fabulous
Ridin' in our cadillacs
On the east head to the west
If your armpits smellin good
Throw your hands up for your hood might be misunderstood
If you don't wanna roll you should

(Pre-Hook)

(Hook)
All over town town
We're takin it down down
We don't mess around, 'round
They wanna be down down
You wanna get wit it
So won't you admit it
We are the shame's name
Don't you forget it

Catch us up in a party
Spikin punch, we roll bacardi
Have them couples actin naughty
All we do is get crunk
Wit ya'll floks, just keep on hatin
Cuz our clothes be coordinatin
We're the hottest, no debatin
All we do is get crunk

OH! They Gon know who we are
We Ghetto Superstarz
OH! They gon't know who we are
We Ghetto Superstarz

(HOOK)
