I heard the cry out as the car came to a STOP!
A mix of panic, then relief on the edge of the Grand Canyon
Ten seconds later still sitting frozen we burst out into
Fucking killer laughter - i couldn't catch my breath forever!

[Chorus]
And the it hit me! "Hey can you play that tape back?!?!"
I...can't believe that it was rollin'!!
Listen to the sounds of our commentary, then wicked yelling out
Screeching wheels, silence, howls...

That three week road trip was a road trip and a half - MAYBE MORE!
Captured on one roll of film, out of focus pictures bore
Every national monument - every tourist trap
Across the 48 states that fell within our path

[Chorus]
And the it hit me! "Hey can you play that tape back?!?!"
I...can't believe that it was rollin'!!
Listen to the sounds of our commentary, then wicked yelling out
Screeching wheels, silence, howls...

By my count it all ended - 17 CASSETTE TAPES LATER!
Stupid, brain dead obersavtions - yes we were much too clever
To know that we were having the time of our lives
Now years later listening to those cassettes drives me to cry...

[Chorus]
And the it hit me! "Hey can you play that tape back?!?!"
I...can't believe that it was rollin'!!
Listen to the sounds of our commentary
Recording our lives ourselves, i'm glad i have them now...
