[Verse 1]
Who walked out when the times got hard
When the truck broke down in the whole front yard
It wasn't me, it wasn't you
Who shot pool all night long
Wound up betting on the crack of dawn
That was you darling, and that was me

[Chorus]
And we are fools for each other, me and you
We are lovers, in fact, we've gone crazy out back
Like only fools for each other would do

[Verse 2]
Now who gave up when the fire burned low
Who flew south when the wind blew cold
It wasn't me, it wasn't you
Who held on when the blues came down
Who took care when the tie was bound
That was you, darling, and that was me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Who took off when their heart got broke
Let the whole thing go up in smoke
It wasn't me and it wasn't you, oh no
And who showed up when the time was right
Laid a little mercy on a bad old night
That was you, darling, and that was me

[Chorus][x2]
