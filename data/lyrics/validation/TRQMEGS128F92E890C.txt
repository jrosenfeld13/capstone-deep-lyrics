Hello, Dolly
This is Louis, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong
You're lookin' swell, Dolly
I can tell, Dolly
You're still glowin'...you're still crowin'
You're still goin' strong
I feel the room swayin'
While the band's playin'
One of our old favourite songs from way back when
So take her wrap, fellas find her an empty lap, fellas
Dolly'll never go away again
