What can I say that hasn't already been said
The cold spot in my bed
Already tells a story about it clear
Feels like my heart (on a merry-go-round)
Loving and loving and leaving all over again
Not even sure if I can't pretend
That I've got my self-respect, what's left of it, he-ey

[Chorus]
I learned to rely on my instinct to guide me
But I'm not as cold as I thought, oh
Try to deny all those feelings inside me
I'm sorry I still have a heart, oh
Ooooh, ooh, so there you are and here I am
One woman and one man laying here, trying to understand
How can love grow, or have truths and rendezvous', yeahh
If she found out about us two, that be so much to lose
So I would play the substitute so you won't have to choose
I hate you now trying to leave and we make love and hardly in denial
That you leave her and it's sweeter than the truth
I learned...
I learned to rely on my instinct to guide me
But I'm not as cold as I thought, oh (But I'm not as cold as I thought)
Try to deny all those feelings inside me (I learned to rely)
I'm sorry I still (Sorry I have a) have a heart (sorry I have a), oh
(Sorry I have a heart)
I learned to rely on my instinct to guide me
But I'm not as cold as I thought, oh
Try to deny all those feelings inside me (oooooh... oooohh....)
But sorry I still have a heart, oh (Oooh, I still have)
[guitar solo]
Ohhhh, ohhh... I really mean to love you, baby, oohh ahh
When you make me go crazy, ohhh aahhh
And you know I need you, baby, oo-oo-oo-oooh
Oo-oo-oo-oooh... heyy ohhhh... ahhh ohhh ahhh...
Oh, heyy yea-yea-ea-ea-ea-ea-ea-eah, yeah
Out of condition from the spot stains on my floors
Oh baby, oh baby
