So this the kingdom of Heaven
So this is the sweet Promised Land
While angels tell of love
Don't break the spell of love, hold my hand

So this is the garden of Eden
In dreams it was never so grand
Let's never leave again
Adam and Eve again, hold my hand

This is the secret of what bliss is
For bliss is what your kiss is
At last I understand

So this is the kingdom of Heaven
And here on the threshold we stand
Pass through the portal now
We'll be immortal now, hold my hand

So this is the kingdom of heaven
And here on the threshold we stand
Pass through the portal now
We'll be immortal now, hold my hand
Hold my hand
