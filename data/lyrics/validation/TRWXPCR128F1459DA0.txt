[Verse 1]
Some men dream of crossing oceans
Some men dream one day to fly
Spend their whole life is out there floating
On the water and the sky
Some men dream of building fortunes
Some men dream of having fame
Nothing else is more important
Than making money and a name

[Chorus]
But in my dreams I see
A little sky blue house
Beside a small stream
A front porch, screen door
The sound of bare feet running and cartoons
In my dreams, your dreams come true

[Verse 2]
I come find you in your garden
Pulling weeds between the rows
Trade a kiss for a glass of water
Sit and watch what love can grow

[Chorus]

[Outro]
In my dreams your dreams
Are the only things
That really matter to me
When you smile I smile
What makes you happy makes me happy too
In my dreams your dreams come true
In my dreams your dreams come true
