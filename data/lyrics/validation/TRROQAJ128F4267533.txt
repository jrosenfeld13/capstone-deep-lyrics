Oh get it on get it on yeah

I love music
Any kind of music
I love music
Just as long as it's groovy

Makes me laugh
Makes me smile for the world
Whenever I'm with you boy

While we dance
Make romance
I'm enchanted by the things that you do
Come on come on come on

I love music
Sweet sweet music
Long as it's swinging
All the joy that's it's bringing

I'm so happy to be
In complete harmony
I love you boy
And to hold you so close in my arms
I'm so glad you're mine

Nothing can be better than a sweet love song
So sweet so sweet so mellow mellow
When you got the girl that you love in your arm
Oh honey I love you I love you yeah

Music is the healing force of the world
It's understood by every man
Woman boy and girl
And that's why
That's why I say

I love music
Any kind of music
I love music
Just as long as it's groovy

Sweet sweet music
Listen listen listen
Music makes the atmosphere so fine

Lights down low
Just me and you baby you know
Specially when you got a cold glass of wine
Mellow mellow wine and song

I love music
Any kind of music
I love music
Just as long as it's groovy
