They always leave the best 'till last
Have understanding, no questions asked
You find yourself in what you see
You found yourself in me..

You found yourself in me..

The day is short, the night is cool
And this night, it was made for fools
You won't find fools like me and you
I found myself in you..

You found.. yourself..
You found.. yourself..
