It's late at night
And I'm feeling down
There are couples standing in the street
Sharing summer kisses and silly sighs
So I step inside
Pour a glass of wine
With a full glass and an empty heart
I search for something to occupy my mind

But you are in my head
Swimming forever in my head
Tangled in my dreams
Swimming forever

So I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)
And all the songs we used to know
So I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)
Remember where we used to go

Now it's morning light
And it's cold outside
Caught up in a distant dream
I turn and think that you are by my side
So I leave my bed
And I try to dress
Wondering why my mind plays tricks
And fools me into thinking you are there

But you're just in my head
Swimming forever in my head
Not lying in my bed
Just swimming forever

So I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)
And all the songs we used to know
So I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)
Remember where we used to go

I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)
And all the songs we used to know
I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)
Remember where we used to go

But you are in my head
Swimming forever in my head
Tangled in my dreams
Swimming forever
Swimming forever

So I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)
And all the songs we used to know
So I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)
Remember where we used to go

I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)
To all the songs we used to know
I listen to the radio (listen to the radio)
To all the songs, all songs we used to know hey (listen to the radio)
All songs we used to know (listen to the radio)
All songs we used to know
