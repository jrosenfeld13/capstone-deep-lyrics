I think it might have taken
Too long
For me to feel
Oh
Whats that you said about it
The right time to discover
Everything, everything
That I can recognize
Oh
Before the thoughts break off
Whats that you said?
I find an easy way out
Collapsed at attention at the sight of your mouth
And its a shame to keep on
Oh
When its not on
The right time to discover
Everything, anything
I see in your eyes
Oh
Before the lights break on
Whats that you said?
Theres only, theres only
There can only be you
Theres only, theres only
There can only be you

This is all taking so long
I cant recall what
I used to say about it
And all thats left to discover
And these thoughts that I meditate
For a long lines
Oh
To make the thoughts break off
What was it I said?
There is only, there is only
There can only be you
There is only, there is only
There can only be you
