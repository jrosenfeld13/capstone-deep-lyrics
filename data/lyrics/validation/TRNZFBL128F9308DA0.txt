Long ago
Before the moon was young
And before the first love song
Had ever been sung
We both knew
Beyond a shadow of doubt
What loving somebody
Was really all about

When the sun goes down
And you are not around
I'm sailing on a prayer
Don't you know
I told everyone
I even told the rising sun
That I really need my friend

When the sun goes down
In this sleepy little town
All the world keeps spinning
And the planets turn around
All alone
Lonely as the stars
Well I just wanna be
Wanna be where you are

When the sun goes down
And you are not around
I'm sailing on a prayer
Don't you know
I told everyone
I even told the rising sun
That I really need my friend

When the sun goes down
And you're not around
I'm sailing on a prayer
Don't you know
I told everyone
I even told the rising sun
That I really miss my friend
