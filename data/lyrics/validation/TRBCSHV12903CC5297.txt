Me and my friends rollin like rockstars
So we by the bar
All eyes on us girls watchin from far
We shining through the dark
Saw this sexy little thing she was biting her lips
Working at me hard
So I just went over there and just whispered in her ear
Do you wanna start?
Girl I wanna party with you
Girl I wanna party with you
I've got the girls in the truck bout six chicks deep
And you know girls we rollin with is straight sexy
Tonight can you keep up?
When we hit the dance floor you know we turn the heat up
It's like the roof on fire everyones desire
All eyes on us DJ turn it up
I've heard you play before but tonight we goin harder
So DJ play my song and keep it going louder
I've heard you play before but tonight we goin harder
So DJ play my song and keep it going louder
Girl I wanna party with you
Girl I wanna party with you
I've got the girls in the truck bout six chicks deep
And you know girls we rollin with is straight sexy
Keep it going louder
No time don't matter
Cause tonight we'll gather
I've got the girls in the truck bout six chicks deep
And you know girls we rollin with is straight sexy
Girl I wanna party with you
Girl I wanna party with you
I've got the girls in the truck bout six chicks deep
And you know girls we rollin with is straight sexy
