I'll be home
I'll be home

When your nights are troubled
And you're all alone
When you're feeling down
And you need some sympathy

There's no one else around
To keep you company
Remember, baby
You can always count on me

I'll be home
I'll be home
I'll be home

I'll be home
I'll be home

Wherever you may wander
Wherever you may roam
You come back
And I'll be waiting here for you

No one else could ever love you
The way I do
I'll be here to comfort you
To see you through

'Cause I'll be home
I'll be home
I'll be home

I'll be here to comfort you
To see you through

'Cause I'll be home
I'll be home
I'll be home

I'll be home
I'll be home
I'll be home
