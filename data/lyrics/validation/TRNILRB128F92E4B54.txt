In we come, we're coming fast
All of the others are in the past
Jump to your feet
Let us get you high with a green fuz

Not too fast and not too slow
Come along baby lets see where we go
Jump to your feet
Let us get you high with a green fuz

Coming fast, I'll tell you why
Jump to your feet
Let's get your eye
Here we come baby and you'd better run
With a green fuz

Coming fast, I'll tell you why
Jump to your feet
Let us get your eye
Here we come baby and you'd better run
With a green fuz
Here we come baby and you'd better run
With a green fuz
Here we come baby and you'd better run
With a green fuz
