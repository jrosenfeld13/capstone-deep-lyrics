All my life a children's song was lost in helices
The darkness tries to hide me from that place

Can I drain the source of fears and find my energy?
Cause a dark man is my barricade to a new philosophy

Is there somebody downstairs
In my playground of fears

The candle leads me down to hear this melody again
Where all the ghosts of Disney world will guide me to a land

I'm on my way back to my Abydos

The toys are protecting me from my ancient enemies
And all relics are the gatherings of our faithful family

Keep searching the way
Back to my Abydos
This is so much more
Than any fool had lost

The toys are expecting me in a world of memories

And I fall into the shelter of my fears

Now I'm on my way
Back to my Abydos
There is so much more we've lost

And the sun is shining
And the world is turning
In another universe I see candles burning
And the sun is shining
And the world is turning
When the sky is a flower field
I can see the morning
I can see the morning
I can see the morning
