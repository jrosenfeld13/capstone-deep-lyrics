You call it a condition of love
Something you don't know the conditions of
You irrigate an obstacle course
With a shower of affection and a show of force

You speak with unimpeachable tact
Only contradicted by the way you act
And freezing in the family room
You're chattering away to your intended groom

If he saw how you keep your things
How you treat yourself day-to-day
He wouldn't be so gung-ho about letting you come to stay
In May

You've got an uncontrollable urge
To listen at your door [?] truth emerge
And right at the proverbial verge
My fascination flickers like a power surge

So take all your combs and rings
The bass that you'll never play
Just say your goodbyes and go
As brief as your resume

In May you notify your lover
He could pave your way to personal recovery
But incase his grace and acquiescence hardens
Don't depend on us to hand out residential pardons

You've got an unassailable right
To picture us meeting your returning flight
But that's an unavailable thought
Like trying to recall the girl that time forgot

If he knew how you keep your things
How you treat yourself day-to-day
He wouldn't be so gung-ho about letting you come to stay
And after his offerings go up
And his glass eye strains
Will the ashes begin to glow
Or stink like a spent volcano?
