It's way to cold right now
To drive with the window down
I'm a bit nervous have you noticed
One hand on ten the other three
I hint a smile, sometimes i see
You smiling back at me
I don't want to wait
Hoping for the perfect day
Wasting everything I have right now
It doesn't seem quite strange
To trade in all i could have saved
Wasting everything i have right now

Curbs are lined with Christmas trees
While January's still shaking
Itself free from December
People are ready to trade in Christmas lights for fireworks and
Midnight kisses
I don't want to wait
Hoping for the perfect day
Wasting everything I have right now
It doesn't seem quite strange
To trade in all I could have saved
Wasting everything I have right now
