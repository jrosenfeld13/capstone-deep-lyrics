Running home on broken legs
We turned it out, I'm heading south
Would you go with me if I begged?

But you're sixteen, you live alone
You got your debt, you could care less
And I could dream but I could never take you home

I came back when you got angry
I ran fast when you got clean
Your friends all solved your problems
Paid your debts with all my things

Friends all got burned out on the scene
I ask you how you've got it figured out
Now that you're older now by a couple weeks
I feel older when I wake up every morning
I feel angrier
I feel uglier
Than you'll ever be

I came back when you got angry
I ran fast when you got clean
Your friends all solved your problems
Paid your debts with all my dreams
I'm glad that you got older
And I'm glad you learned some things
But when I fall in debt 'cause of the things you've said
Will you carry me?
Will you Carrie?
