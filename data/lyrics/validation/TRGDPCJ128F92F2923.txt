I am not in love
But I'm open to persuasion
East or West
Where's the best
For romancing

With a friend
I can smile
But with a lover
I could hold my head back
I could really laugh
Really laugh

Thank you
You took me dancing
'Cross the floor
Cheek to cheek
But with a lover
I could really move
Really move
I could really dance
Really dance
Really dance
Really dance
I could really move
Really move
Really move
Really move

Now if I can feel the sun
In my eyes
And the rain on my face
Why can't I
Feel love

Really love
Really love
Really love
Really love
Really love
Love love love love
Love love love love

Now I got all
The friends that I want
I may need more
But I shall just stick to those
That I have got
With friends I still feel
So insecure

Little darling I believe you could
Help me a lot
Just take my hand
And lead me where you will
No conversation
No wave goodnight
Just make love
With affection

Sing me another love song
But this time
With a little dedication
Sing it, sing it(Sing it, sing it)
You know that's what I like
Once more with feeling
Give me love
Give me love
Give me love
Love...

Love, uh hu
Make love with affection
Sing me another love song
But this time with a little dedication
Sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it
You know that's what I like
Love, uh hu
Once more with the feeling
Sing me another love song
But this time with a little dedication
Sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it
You know that's what I like
Love, uh hu
With affection
With a little dedication
Once more with the feeling
You know that's what I like
Love, uh hu
Uh hu
