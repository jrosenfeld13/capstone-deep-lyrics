I should'a known better
Should'a seen right thru
Over and over falling in love with you
Wanting you for myself- my first mistake
Finding out the hard way
Was all that I could take

You were just using someone
And I was the one

She said "You just got lucky"
I believed your deadly lies
"You just got lucky"
I've been hypnotized
She said "You just got lucky"
I believed your deadly lies
"You just got lucky"
You're a devil in disguise

Don't wanna hear no lies- no apologies
Imagination gets the best of me
I'm looking everywhere- still I see your face
I'll never forget you- you put me in my place

You were just using someone
And I was the one

She said "You just got lucky"
I believed your deadly lies
"You just got lucky"
I've been hypnotized
She said "You just got lucky"
I believed your deadly lies
"You just got lucky"
You're a devil in disguise

Now that is over and I've seen right through
Not looking back again I'll start anew
Was making love to you such a wasted time
Maybe I love you, still, I'll get you off my mind

You were just using someone
And I was the one

She said "You just got lucky"
I believed your deadly lies
"You just got lucky"
I've been hypnotized
She said "You just got lucky"
I was taken by surprise
"You just got lucky"
You're a devil in disguise
