The day that I first saw you
I knew I had to have you
You were as cute as could be
I needed a family around me

Over the course of the year
I slowly lost my interest
Now you're a pain in the ass
And I have got to leave you

Now, turn me round, turn me round, turn me round
Now, turn me round, turn me round, turn me round

Love all around us
And so I made a promise
Tried my best to keep it
But then I tire of it

Tired of seeing your face
Cleaning up after your mess
Buying the food that you eat
And I have got to leave you

Now, turn me round, turn me round, turn me round
Now, turn me round, turn me round, turn me round

I'm over again, I'm over again
I'm over until I've had enough of you my friend

Tired of seeing your face
Cleaning up after your mess
Buying the food that you eat
And I have got to leave you

Now, turn me round, turn me round, turn me round
Now, turn me round, turn me round, turn me round

Turn me round, turn me round
Turn me round, turn me round!

Turn me round, turn me round, turn me round
Now, turn me round, turn me round, turn me round
