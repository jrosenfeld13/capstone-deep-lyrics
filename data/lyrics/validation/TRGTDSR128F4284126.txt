[Verse 1]
He saw the purity, a shaven and a moaning
And standing on a pigeon toe, in his disarray
Stay dear, no picture pose
He's coming round to meet you
And screaming like a battle cry, it's more if I stay

[Chorus]
Me and you're cold, driving in the snow
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
Cowgirl, king of the rodeo, let the good times roll
Let the good times roll

[Verse 2]
How dare you come to me like Withnail for a favor?
Hold on, not my fairy tale you're trying to start
Take off your overcoat, you're staying for the weekend
And swaying like a smokey grey, a drink in the park

[Chorus]
Me and you're cold, driving in the snow
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
Cowgirl, king of the rodeo, let the good times roll
Let the good times roll

[Outro]
Good time to roll on
