[Verse 1]
Once he gets a mystic call
Jump into his motorcar
Once we're rolling down the road
He's forgotten where to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Travelling with Charley
My detective darling

[Chorus]
My agent hasn't solved a case
My agent never finds a trace
But Charley has always style
Charley is always nice
My agent hasn't solved a case
My agent never finds a trace
But Charley has always style
Charley is always nice
Poor Charley
He would be nothing without me

[Verse 2]
Once I clear his memory
Bet he'll crash into a tree
Once we're getting to the place
Someone else has solved the case

[Pre-Chorus]
Travelling with Charley
My detective darling

[Chorus]
My agent hasn't solved a case
My agent never finds a trace
But Charley has always style
Charley is always nice
My agent hasn't solved a case
My agent never finds a trace
But Charley has always style
Charley is always nice
Poor little Charley
He would be nothing without me
But I do love him
