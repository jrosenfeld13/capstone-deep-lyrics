Faster and faster, i march on my way
For me there's no limit to see
Harder and harder i push to succeed
I live at the highest degree

Too many years i have wasted
To live in the past
I've started to move and i'm doing fast
I'm riding into the future
I'm out of hiding again ready to fly

Breaking through boundaries
Destroy what confines
A will that is made out of steel
An immortal trust
To What's right and what's wrong
I warn you do not cross my wheel

To many years i have wasted
To live in the past
I've started to move and i'm doing it fast
I'm riding into the future
I'm out of hiding again ready to fly

Come with me
I will show you the way
To the place where's you destiny
There's no reason to stay
