We touched the sun
We held the stars
We fell in love
With open hearts
We chased our dreams
That went beyond
We did it all
We touched the sun

When I look back, I'm glad we found each other
With no regrets along the way
And what was like an endless summer
Now it's dust yesterday

We touched the sun
We held the stars
We fell in love
With open hearts
We chased our dreams
That went beyond
We did it all
We touched the sun

And even if it's not forever
We were meant to be together
Even if it's only for a while now

We touched the sun
We held the stars
We fell in love
With open hearts
We chased our dreams
That went beyond
We did it all
We touched the sun

We chased our dreams
That went beyond
We did it all
We touched the sun
