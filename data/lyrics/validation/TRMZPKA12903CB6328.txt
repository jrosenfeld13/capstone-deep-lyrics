I meant to call you tonight

But I

Ended up just like them

The people I despise

The people

Who never make a difference

And never get anything done

I've never told you enough times

Of how

Pride got in the way

For all the gratitude

I feel

For everything that's you

Everything that's you

I meant to call you tonight

But I

Ended up just like them

The people I despise

The people

Who never make a difference

And never get anything done
