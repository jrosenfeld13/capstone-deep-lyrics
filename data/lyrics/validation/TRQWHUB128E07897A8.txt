Well it's all been said, it's over now, I guess that I should leave
'Cause there's nothin' left for me to do except to set you free
So let me leave now before I cry, I'll just go back to my room and hide
And never let no one else inside to do this again
But if you change your mind, won't you take some time
And let me know that you still want me too
'Cause I'll wait night and day until you say
That you have changed your mind, won't you change your mind
If you should change your mind, oh yeah
Well I tried so hard to be the one that you were dreaming of
But I guess it wasn't quite enough to make you fall in love
So walk away, leave me by myself and let me crawl back into my shell
And be the me that I do so well before I met you
But if you change your mind won't you take some time
And let me know that you still want me too
'Cause I'll wait night and day until you say
That you have changed your mind, won't you change your mind
If you should change your mind, oh yeah
I'll be waitin' at home, just call me up on the phone
And I'll be by your side, there's no reason to hide
If you need me just call, don't you worry at all
But if this is the end and I can't see you again
I just can't carry on, it's so hard when you're gone
It's so hard when you're gone, oh oh, oh oh, oh no, oh
Baby don't leave, oh baby, baby don't go, oh baby don't go
But if you change your mind, won't you take some time
And let me know that you still want me too
'Cause I'll wait night and day until you say
That you have changed your mind, won't you change your mind
If you should change your mind, oh yeah
But if you change your mind, won't you take some time
And let me know that you still want me too
'Cause I'll wait night and day until you say
That you have changed your mind, won't you change your mind
If you should change your mind, oh yeah
But if you change your mind, won't you take some time
And let me know that you still want me too
'Cause I'll wait night and day until you say
That you have changed your mind, won't you change your mind
If you should change your mind oh yeah
