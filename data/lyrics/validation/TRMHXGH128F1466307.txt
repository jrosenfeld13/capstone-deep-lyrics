See my face
You know where I've been
Walking in jungle
Cruising down boulevard
Part of the race
Taking a tumble

Loving that stranger
Is fearing from danger
Is crying in some avenue
And soon the hate will be there...

Assassin with gun
Is taking his aim
To target his rival
And tossing the street
Is a dangerous game
The stakes of survival

Love in that stranger
Still fearing that danger
Still crying in some avenue
And soon the hate will be there too

Life in the big apple moves very fast and so must you
Do like the others do and don't you drag your heels
Life in the big apple moves very fast...

Cops on route
Are hot in pursuit
As windows are shattered
Caf and arcade are teeming with loot
The sidewalks are scattered

Walking down highways
Just seeing things my way
While dealer man enjoys his wealth
You spare the rope he'll hang himself

Life in the big apple moves very fast and so must you
Do like the others do and don't you drag your heels
Life in the big apple moves very fast and so must you
Do like the others do and don't you drag your... drag your...

Life in the big apple moves very fast and so must you
Do like the others do and don't you drag your heels
Life in the big apple moves very fast and so must you
Do like the others do and don't you drag your heels
