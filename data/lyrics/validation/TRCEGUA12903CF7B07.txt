Face on face all totally sane
Living on eggs in a bullet train
The answer comes with a sage like nod
And we're ringing the bell like Pavlov's dog
I'm all fuelled up I'm wearing a crown
When the lights go up and the kids get down
Now I'm a stranger in this town
But the lights go up and the kids get down
Thinking sideways immune from shock
Going on stage at 28 o'clock
Staying in a place where we can't afford to eat
Getting used to that eastern beat
Mustn't grumble I got some perks
But all I want is a phone that works
Endless routine I need a release
Falling down at the House Of Peace
