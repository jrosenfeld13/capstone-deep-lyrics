Jesse come home, there's a hole in the bed
Where we slept; now it's growing cold
Jesse your face, in the place where we lay
By the hearth, all apart, it hangs on my heart

And I'm leaving the light on the stairs
No I'm not scared; I wait for you
Hey Jesse, it's lonely, come home

Jesse the stairs in the halls, recalling
Your step; and I remember too
All the pictures are shaded and fading in grey
And I still set a place on the table at noon

And I'm leaving the light on the stairs
No I'm not scared; I wait for you
Hey Jesse, it's lonely, come home

Jesse the spread on the bed
It's like when you left, I kept it for you
All the blues and the greens have been recently cleaned
And are seemingly new; hey Jess, me and you

We'll swallow the light on the stairs
I'll fix up my hair, we'll sleep unawares
Hey Jesse, it's lonely, come home
