Paper cuts leave their mark
All begins from a spark
Makes you believe it will last
It may not last
So
Blood will flow through the veins
Of everything you ever made
However much they hide the flames
It can't be changed
So
"keep calm and carry on
You can rely on this"
You cannot sleep, you sleep around
And isolate yourself until you're never found
There is some love in what you've found
So
"keep calm and carry on
You can rely on this"
Ironic now, I fear the sun
Live for the night, what's done is done
It can't be changed, til the next time
Til the next one
So
"keep calm and carry on
You can rely on this"
I'd love to say, rely on me
But mind's are changing constantly
They'll soon be gone, and you'll be free
And you'll be free
So
"keep calm and carry on
You can rely on this"
"keep calm and carry on"
You can rely on this?!
