Slowly he settles down to give them what they want
He tries to keep himself together
I would slam my head in the ground before I tell you this
He turns his head to the floor as it falls away

I'm a product of your hate
Just the one that you'd create
Is anybody listening to a word I say?
I hate today

You taught me everything you know
The blame will surely show, ya
I try to keep it down forever

Days have taken years
To conquer all my fear
I stand before you now
Sickened and cut-down

I'm a product of your hate
Just the one that you'd create
Is anybody listening to a word I say?
I hate today
