Mandela mandela when will they set you free
Why it has taken so long is a mystery
We've got the power to help in your hour of need
When will they do what is right so the world can see
I know we can do it we can make a difference
We've got to come to it cause it just don't make no since
I'm tired of talkin cause it's got to be a way for the people
Freedom's gonna come someday

Mandela mandela what do they want from you
There's nothing more you can say nothing more to do
We that are free are the one's who should see your plight
All that I'm asking It's time to just do what is right

Stop procrastinating cause we've waited long enough
To much hesitating and it makes it twice as tough
I know one thing though we have got to find a way
For the people freedom's gonna find a way
