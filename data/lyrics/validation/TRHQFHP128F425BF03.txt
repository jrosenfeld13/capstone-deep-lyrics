Love, to me, is like a summer day
Silent 'cause, there's just too much to say
Still, and warm, and peaceful
Even clouds that may drift by
Can't disturb our summer sky

I'll take summer, that's my time of year
Winter's shadow, seems to disappear
Gay is swanee season
That's the reason I can say
That I love a summer day

I hear laughter, from the swimming hole
Kids out fishin', with the willow pole
Boats come driftin', round the bend
Why must summer, ever end...

Love, to me, is like a summer day
If it ends, the memories will stay
Still, and warm, and peaceful
Now the days are getting long
I can sing my summer song

I hear laughter, from the swimmin' hole
Kids out fishin', with the willow pole
Boats come driftin', round the bend
Why must summer, ever end...

Oh, love to me, is like a summer's day
If it ends, the memories will stay
Still, and warm, and peaceful
Now the days are getting long
I can sing, my summer song...
