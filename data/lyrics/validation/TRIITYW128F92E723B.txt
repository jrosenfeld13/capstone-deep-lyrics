However you feel
Whatever it takes
Whenever it's real
Whatever awaits me
Whatever you need
However so slight
Whenever it's real
Whenever it's right

I've been thinking long and hard about the things you said to me
Like a bitter stranger
Now I see the long and short, the middle, and what's in between
I could spit on a stranger (pull me out)
You're a bitter stranger (pull me out)

Whatever you feel
Whatever it takes
Whenever it's real
Whatever awaits me
Whatever you need
However so slight

Honey I'm a prize and you're a catch and we're a perfect match
Like two bitter strangers
Now I see the long and short of it and I can make it last
I could spit on a stranger (pull me out)
You're a bitter stranger (pull me out)
I could spit on a stranger (pull me out)
You're a bitter stranger (pull me out)
I could spit on a stranger (pull me out)
You're a bitter stranger

I see the sunshine in your eyes
I'll try the things you never tried
I'll be the one that leaves you high, high, high
