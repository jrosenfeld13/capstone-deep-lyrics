Go, honey go
Into the ocean
Go, honey go
Into the great beyond till you're good and gone
And you can hide away for when everything goes wrong
Honey, go

Go, honey go
If I were you I would leave this neighborhood
Away from people who never treat you like they should
Honey, go
Go

In the woods or in the ice and snow
Where there is no one else you know
You've really nowhere else to go
So honey go

Go, honey go
'Cause it's a dead end street
And it's a street in a town where winning isn't sweet
And every win is the beginning of defeat
So honey go
Go
