[Verse:]
MRGART, re you greving
Over Goldengrove unleaving?
Leves, lke the things of man, you
With your fresh thoughts care for, can you?
h! s the heart grows older
It will come to such sights colder
By and by, nor spare a sigh
Though worlds of wanwood leafmeal lie
And yet you wll weep and know why
Now no matter, child, the name
Srrows sprngs re the same
Nor mouth had, no nor mind, expressed
What heart heard of, ghost guessed
It s the blight man was born for
It is Margaret you mourn for
