Did I tell you I need your love a little more each day
Did I tell you I'm feeling old since you went away
Did I tell you my love was cold like the desert night
Did I tell you my heart was dry like the desert sky

Chorus:
Oh, will you love me again, won't you help out a friend
Will you love me again

Did I tell you my lips were cold like the desert night
Did I tell you my heart was dry like the desert sky
And if I need anyone to hold will you say you might

Repeat Chorus'
