Don't die
Give it one more try and you will
Feel fine
Face your inner fears
Don't die
Take another turn

I can see it deep inside your eyes
Don't hold me for a fool just realize

Cold dead heart, deceptive eyes
Where did it all go wrong?

All I know is that they took his youth
Left him all alone and turned away

So behold this broken man
Who will never ever mend

Don't die
Give it one more try and you will
Feel fine
Face your inner fears
If you look to the one beside you
Notice that he's just the same
Don't die
Take another turn

He fell out into this world unknown
Teach me how so I can lead him home

Let me help you

Remember son you're not alone
Stand up tall, do not look back
Follow me and I will lead the way
Trust my words your demon is not me

Don't die
Give it one more try and you will
Don't die
Take another turn
