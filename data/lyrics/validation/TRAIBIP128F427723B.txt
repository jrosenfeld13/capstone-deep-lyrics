You're a big fish in a small pond
Everyone knows your name, so you claim
Out for fortune and for the fame
Though you play your life like it's just a game
I'd rather be fabulous than famous
Live my life steady than nervous
Always looking over my shoulder
Never knowing what's coming round the corner

Look at yourself
Look at yourself

You're the flyest in the neighbourhood
But I wonder if we'd all be like you if we could
The flashest cars
The sovereign rings
Champagne worlds filled with material things
Peddling plastic dreams
A way of life far removed from reality
But nothing lasts for long
And you can't take it with you when you're gone

Look at yourself
Look at yourself

I'd rather be fabulous than famous
Live my life steady than nervous
Always looking over my shoulder
Never knowing what's coming round the corner

Look at yourself
Look at yourself
