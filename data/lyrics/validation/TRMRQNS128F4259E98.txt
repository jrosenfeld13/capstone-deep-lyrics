CHORUS
Roll away (roll away), Roll away (roll away)
Doubts and fears and sadness, all roll away (roll away)
Everytime I call His name
When I'm sad and all alone and nothing can move this
Impossible stone. I just talk to Jesus and my burdens roll away
REPEAT CHORUS
VS 1
In this life there are struggles
We all have our share of trials and troubles
And heartaches along the way
But there is joy and there is comfort
In serving a God who's always triumphant
When I talk to Jesus all my burdens roll away
CHORUS
VS 2
Jesus knows my condition
He's always aware of the need before I even mention
The problems when I pray
But when I speak, He will listen
He wants to hear the cry of His children
When I talk to Jesus all my burdens roll away
REPEAT CHORUS
