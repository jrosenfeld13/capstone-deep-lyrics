Dirty old river must you keep rolling
Flowing into the night
People so busy make me feel dizzy
Taxi lights shine so bright
But I don't need no friends
As long as I gaze at Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise
Sha la la

Every day I look at the world from my window
Sha la la
Jelly jellys in evening time
Waterloo sunset's fine

Terry meets Julie Waterloo station
Every Friday night
But I am so lazy I don't want to wonder
I'll stay at home at night
But I don't
Feel afraid
As long as I gaze at Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise

Sha la la

Every day I look at the world from my window
Sha la la
Jelly jellys in evening time
Waterloo sunset's fine

Millions of people
Swarming like flies round
Waterloo underground
Terry and Julie
Cross over the river
Where everything's safe and sound
And they don't need no friends
As long as they gaze up Waterloo sunset
They are in paradise

Waterloo sunset's fine
Waterloo sunset's fine
Waterloo sunset's fine

Waterloo sunset's fine
Waterloo sunset's fine
Waterloo sunset's fine

Waterloo sunset's fine
Waterloo sunset's fine
Waterloo sunset's fine

Waterloo sunset's fine
Waterloo sunset's fine
Waterloo sunset's fine
