The chain linked fence
Surrounds the feeble child
Gag your mouth
To hear sweet melodies
Lifted your hand to swing
To swing the chair
Pounding my brain
Love her and tell her
Fuck her and smell her
Don't fall for it
Don't fall for me
Fall child
Just one more thing
Kiss my lips and make me fly
I told you not to fall for it
Kiss my lip and make me fly!
