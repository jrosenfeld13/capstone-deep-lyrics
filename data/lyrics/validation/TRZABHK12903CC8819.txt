The cardboard box that I use to mend my shoes
Has shrunk to a couple of square feet
My diet consists of dandelion-roots
Sleeping on a dirt bed with thorn-sheets
Both of my socks are getting kind of stiff
Since I ran out of toilet paper
And I don't think that I'd ever change anything even if
I would come to see my state as a failure
My ambition
Needs nutrition
For me to do something about it
But hey, it ain't everything
Hey, it ain't everything
Hey, it ain't everything
Though most peoples lives seem to be all about it
Earlier today I chopped my leg off by the knee
As I thought that it would add a little something
To my otherwise so meagre and fastidious cuisne
And also, give the dog a new play-thing
I'm nearly finished digging a hole in a dung-heep
Smelly but well isolated
At least now in the winter I will have somewhere to sleep
With my 38 degree radiator
My ambition
Needs nutrition
For me to do something about it
But hey, it ain't everything
Hey, it ain't everything
Hey, it ain't everything
Though most peoples lives seem to be all about it
