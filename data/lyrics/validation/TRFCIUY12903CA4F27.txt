How long, how long
Has that evenin' train been gone?
How long, how long
Baby, how long?

Heard the whistle blowin'
Couldn't see the train
Way down in my heart
I had an achin' pain

How long, how long, how long?
If I could holler like a mountain jack
I'd go up on the mountain
And call my baby back

I went up on the mountain
Looked as far as I could see
The man had my woman
And the blues had poor me

I can see the green grass
Growin' on the hill
But I ain't seen the green grass
On a dollar bill

I'm goin' down to Georgia
Been up in Tennessee
So look me over, baby
Last you'll see of me

The brook runs into the river
River runs into the sea
If I don't run into my baby
A train is goin' to run into me
