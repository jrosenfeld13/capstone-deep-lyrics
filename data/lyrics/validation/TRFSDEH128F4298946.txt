[Verse 1]
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
And when it's cold outside well I've got the month of May
I guess you say what could make me feel this way
My love my love my love talking bout my love my love
I've got so much honey you know the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song oh than the birds in trees
Oh and I know I know I know what you're gonna say
What what could make me feel this way
My love my love my love talking about my love my love

[Verse 2]
I don't need no money don't need the right or chance for fame
And I've got all the riches baby than anyone could want to claim
Ah oh and I know I know I know
