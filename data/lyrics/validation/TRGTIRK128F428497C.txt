Stories never end 'til you come to conclusions:
Carolina ruadh has a hand in my confusion
Waits for me to choose which quarter to bend in
To Susie-Make-Me-Blue, or the redhead I'm attending

Oh Carolina ruadh has my heart and all I want to do's
Go down the windy road where my Carolina goes:
Down the crooked road where Carolina goes to school
Mo Charolina ruadh, do you love me?
Tell me true, tell me......
Standing on three queens, thought the game was over
Then, from the blue, Carolina's at my shoulder:
Laughter in her eyes and a smile
That touches all the guys

On down the crooked road where Carolina goes to school
--Mo Charolina ruadh, do you love me?
Tell me true, tell me..
