Mom, please wake up
I can't sleep, my head's fucked
Need a hug or a drug
So please decide

What's up, Doc?
Do I think suicide?
In this room, yes, I do
Where's my form?

Now question thirty-eight
Do you have trouble sleeping late?

Well, sure I got probs sleeping in
Please pump me full of Klonopin
Mom, Doc, stop taking bets
On whether I smoke cigarettes

Prescribe goggles
Make it dark all the time
Go to school, get beat up
Go to sleep

You're so bald
You don't know about
My life with hair
Stop the interrogation

Hey, Anne, I really think
You shouldn't tell me I can't drink

Well, sorry, John, you're my best friend
I didn't mean to try and kick your ass in the van
I can't do weekly visits
Three to six for results, fuck that

I'm a panic bomb
Get away from me
Panic bomb, panic bomb

I'm a panic bomb
Please get away from me
Panic bomb, panic bomb

And I know that you're all just trying to help
But I really think you're all just trying to get rich
I don't need to be addicted to anything else
I don't need to be addicted to anything else

I'm a panic bomb
Get away from me
Panic bomb, panic bomb

I'm a panic bomb
Hey, get away from me
Panic bomb, panic bomb

And I know that you're all just trying to help
But I really think you're all just trying to get rich
I don't need to be addicted to anything else
I don't need to be addicted to anything else
