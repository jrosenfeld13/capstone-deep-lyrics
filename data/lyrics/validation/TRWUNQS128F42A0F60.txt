Take me, dance with me
I want to be
Everything a man should be

Their world is shrinking
But as they dance the dollar is falling
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Their world is shrinking
But as they dance the dollar is falling
Do you love me?

No longer on my own
Secure, I smile
Now I am a man
I understand
And I am complete

Their world is shrinking
But as they dance the dollar is falling
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Their world is shrinking
But as they dance the dollar is falling
Do you love me?

Take me, dance with me
Dance
To the tension of a world on the wane
I shuffle around on wooden boards
Now no longer afraid

I will be a good boy, I said
I will be a good boy
