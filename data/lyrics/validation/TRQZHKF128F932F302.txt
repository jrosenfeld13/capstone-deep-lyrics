I think your addicted
Addicted love you
A lonely existence
So down on yourself
And i'll be there to watch you
Lift your hand while you drown
And no self worth
Is bringing me down

He's walking all over you
And there is nothing you can do
She's walking all over you
And there is nothing i can do
She's talking

You need me to rescue
As death is on the ground
And though i can still kill
Kill you from yourself
'Cause you can keep birds alive
So cool to break you
It's starting to search you

She's breaking you down

She's walking all over you
And there is nothing you can do
She's walking all over you
And there is nothing i can do

She's talking
