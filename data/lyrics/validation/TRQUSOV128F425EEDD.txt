Well I don't wanna love you and I tell you why
You got the kind of lovin', no one wants to try
You can't be trusted 'cause the things you do
Here's all the reasons I don't want you

You're always a lyin' and a foolin' around
Showin' yourself all over the town
You always asking for a one-more chance
Now girl I'm gonna watch your dance

Well I don't need you baby and that's for sure
And I don't want you knockin' on my door
I don't need a love that can't be true
That's why girl it's over for you

Well I don't wanna love you and I tell you why
You got the kind of lovin' no wants to buy
You can't be trusted cause the things you do
Here's all the reasons I don't want you

You're always a lyin' and a foolin' around
Showin' yourself all over the town
You're always playing for those high class gains
Even though they make a man mighty insane

Well I don't need you baby and that's for sure
And I don't want you knockin' on my door
I don't need a love that can't be true
That's why girl, it's over for you

I don't need your lies
I don't need your cries
All those other guys
All those lies

You can't be trusted
You can't be trusted
You can't be trusted
Same old thing
You can't be trusted
You can't be trusted
