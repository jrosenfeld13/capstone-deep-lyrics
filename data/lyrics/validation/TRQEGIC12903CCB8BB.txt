[Verse 1]
I don't tell anyone about the way you hold my hand
I don't tell anyone about the things that we have planned
Won't tell anybody, won't tell anybody
They want to push me down
They want to see you fall down
Won't tell anybody how you turn my world around
I won't tell anyone how your voice is my favourite sound
Won't tell anybody, won't tell anybody
They want to see us fall they want to see us fall

[Chorus]
I don't need a parachute
Baby, if I've got you
Baby, if I've got you
I don't need a parachute
You're gonna catch me
You're gonna catch if I fall
Down, down, down
I don't need a parachute
Baby, if I've got you
Baby, if I've got you
I don't need a parachute
You're gonna catch me
You're gonna catch if I fall
Down, down, down

[Verse 2]
Don't believe the things you tell
Yourself so late at night and
You are your own worst enemy
You'll never win the fight
Just hold on to me, I'll hold on to you
It's you and me up against the world
It's you and me

[Chorus]
I don't need a parachute
Baby, if I've got you
Baby, if I've got you
I don't need a parachute
You're gonna catch me
You're gonna catch if I fall
Down, down, down
I don't need a parachute
Baby, if I've got you
Baby, if I've got you
I don't need a parachute
You're gonna catch me
You're gonna catch if I fall
Down, down, down

[Bridge]
I won't fall out of love, I won't fall out of
I won't fall out of love, I won't fall out of
I won't fall out of love, I won't fall out of
I won't fall out of love, I'll fall into you
I won't fall out of love, I won't fall out of
I won't fall out of love, I won't fall out of
I won't fall out of love, I won't fall out of
I won't fall out of love, I'll fall into you

[Chorus]
I don't need a parachute
Baby, if I've got you
Baby, if I've got you
I don't need a parachute
You're gonna catch me
You're gonna catch if I fall
Down, down, down
I don't need a parachute
Baby, if I've got you
Baby, if I've got you
I don't need a parachute
You're gonna catch me
You're gonna catch if I fall
Down, down, down
