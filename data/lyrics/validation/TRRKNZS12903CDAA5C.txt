I don't care for much
Got no time to talk
I reason all that I came to find
And it fuels desire

Change the stylus soon
Before it wears the grooves
Isn't it just cool 'round here
Where I can't afford to live?

So careful now
You don't belong
Careful now
Set it straight, you know I don't like to change

You don't have to take the chance
I've given all that I can and it made me last
The last thing I need is just to play
I've taken all that I can just to stay awake
You don't have to take the chance
I've given all that I can and it made me last
The last thing I need is just to play
I've taken all that I can just to stay awake

I'm falling
I'm falling
I'm falling
Won't you catch me?
I'm falling
I'm falling
I'm falling
Won't you catch me?

Careful now
You don't belong
Careful now
Set it straight, you know I don't like to change

You don't have to take the chance
I've given all that I can and it made me last
The last thing I need is just to play
I've taken all that I can just to stay awake

I'm still awake
I'm still awake
I'm still awake...
