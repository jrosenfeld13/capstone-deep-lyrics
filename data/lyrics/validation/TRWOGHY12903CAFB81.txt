[Verse 1: Jill Scott]
You say you mean good for me
But you don't do it
You say you have a plan but you just don't go thru with it
You say you know the way to go
And I should follow
But all of your empty promises
Leave me hollow

[Chorus]
And oh
How do I trust you
How do I love you
When you
Lie to me repeatedly
And oh
How do I have faith in you
When you just don't come throught
Like you say you could (oh oh)

Oh, say can you see [2x]

[Verse 2: Jill Scott]
You say that I'm wrong for
Stating my opinion to you
You say that I'm wrong and there'll be quiet consequences too
But I know my rights babe
There'll be no law abridging
The freedom of my speech
Or the right for me to petition for a remedy of grievances

[Chorus]
And I want to trust you
I want to love you yeah
But you lie to me repeatedly
And oh I want to have faith in you
But you just don't come through
Like you said you could (like you said you could)
Oh say can you see (say can you see)
Hmmm

[Bridge]
I want fresh food clean water
Air that I don't see
I want the feeling of being safe on my streets
I want my children to be smarter than me
I want
I want to feel
I want to feel
I want to feel free
For real ya'll
I'm just telling you so you know
I wanna I wanna to have faith in you
I really do but you keep lying to me
And it hurts
I believe, I believe you owe it me
Give it to me like you said you would


Hmmm
Oh say can you see
Hmmm
Oh say can you see
Oohh say can you see
Hmmm
By the dawn's early light
