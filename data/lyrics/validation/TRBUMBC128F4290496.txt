When the good Lord was handing out
The best things from above
We got the love
We got the love

I know we don't have a lot of money
We can barely keep the bills paid honey
But when we're in each other's arms
Who needs all that stuff
We got the love
We got the love

Don't need the finer things
Fancy cars or no diamond rings
I wanna roll down a simple road
Rock with you when we get old

Sometimes life's a desperate situation
Sometimes it's just grim determination
But I know we'll do what it takes
To make us tough enough

We got the love
We got the love

We got the love
We got the love

Don't need the finer things
Fancy cars or no diamond rings
I wanna roll down a simple road
Rock with you when we get old

Built this house of bricks and stone together
Trying to make it strong to last forever
But if these walls come tumblin' down
We still ain't givin' up

We got the love
We got the love

We got the love
We got the love

Roll down a simple road
Rock with you till we get old.....
