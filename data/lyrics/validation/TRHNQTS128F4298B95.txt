He is a homeless man with silver clothes
And a blue cellphone
He waits outside of a silver building in Rome
And he tells everyone what it's like to be alone

I know he's not my problem
But something tells me I should
Help him

He waits outside of a silver building in Rome
And he tells everyone what it's like to be alone
And when he tells everyone he'll ask for spare change
And you know that you'll make a friend for the day

I know he's not my problem
But something tells me I should
Help him
