One, two, three, four
You'll take me on a journey
And be there till the end
It won't be an uphill struggle
On you I can depend

You promised me a dream home
With roses round the door
You'll cover me in diamonds
There's nothing I want more
And
You'll be strong
And you'll turn me on
But I've got my doubts and what if I'm right?
You'll be true and be faithful too
But I've got my doubts and what if I'm right?
What if I'm right?

'cos if the rain starts falling
You'll protect me with your coat
And you'll always tape the football
And let me watch my soap

You'll always be as handsome
And your weight will never gain
And when I give birth to our children
I will feel no pain
And
You'll bring me flowers
And you'll bring the showers
But I've got my doubts and what if I'm right?
You'll say I'm thin and bring the washing in
But I've got my doubts and what if I'm right?
What if I'm right?

You'll always keep the magic
The tender love and care
And when you need to change the light bulb
You won't hand me the chair
And when we're tired of the city
And we find a country home
You'll sell your vinyl records
And go get us a loan

You'll be my sympathetic lover
And won't steal the covers
But I've got my doubts and what if I'm right?
You won't forsake me
Your mother won't hate me
But I've got my doubts and what if I'm right?
You'll be strong
And you'll turn me on
But I've got my doubts and what if I'm right?
You'll be true
And be faithful too
But I've got my doubts and what if I'm right?
What if I'm right?
