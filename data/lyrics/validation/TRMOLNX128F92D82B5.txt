Here I am
Darkness night
Is masking the cold
That embraces me

Can't you see
Truth means fear
Your lying breath
Never will resist

Alone I sit here waiting
Watching the world
In it's agony

Because I have seen
My future
My crying face
No cure I'm longing for

And no healer
Heals the evil
I sought truth for you
Condemned to fail

For you, for you
I'm bleeding
And every new dawn
Ends in bitterness...
