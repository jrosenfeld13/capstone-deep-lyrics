To be a star you've got to shine
To be the light in someone's heart
You gotta be bigger than you are
Gotta be bigger than you are

If you can't reach what you can see
When dreams are your reality
It's time to be bigger than you are
Time to be bigger than you are

Are you ready for the sudden awakening
Are you ready for the total recall
Are you ready for the truth when it's told and
How do you know that it's the truth at all
Sometimes that truth isn't honest
Sometimes it cuts like a knife
Some days take more than all day and
Some lives take more than one life

To be a star you've got to shine
To be the light in someone's heart
You gotta be bigger than you are
Gotta be bigger than you are

If a smile would break on every face
At once our planet human race
Would learn how to find the path with heart
We could be bigger than we are, bigger than we are

Are you ready for the rock and roll ending
Are you ready for the rigmarole
Are you ready when you gave it all and
You'll be damned if you know where you're gonna get some more
Are you ready, are you ready
Ready to be bigger (are you ready)
Ready to be bigger than a star

To be a star you've got to shine
To be the light in someone's heart
You gotta be bigger than you are
Gotta be bigger than you are
