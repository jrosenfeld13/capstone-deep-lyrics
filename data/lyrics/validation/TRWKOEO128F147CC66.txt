[Verse 1: James Hetfield]
Pride you took, pride you feel
Pride that you felt when you'd kneel
Not the word, not the love
Not what you thought from above

[Pre-Chorus: James Hetfield]
It feeds, it grows
It clouds all that you will know
Deceit, deceive
Decide just what you believe

[Chorus: James Hetfield]
I see faith in your eyes
Never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed

[Verse 2: James Hetfield]
Find your peace, find your say
Find the smooth road in your way
Trust you gave, a child to save
Left you cold and him in grave

[Pre-Chorus: James Hetfield]
It feeds, it grows
It clouds all that you will know
Deceit, deceive
Decide just what you believe

[Chorus: James Hetfield]
I see faith in your eyes
Never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed

[Guitar Solo: Kirk Hammett]

[Chorus: James Hetfield]
I see faith in your eyes
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed

[Verse 3: James Hetfield]
Pride you took, pride you feel
Pride that you felt when you'd kneel
Trust you gave, a child to save
Left you cold and him in grave

[Chorus: James Hetfield]
I see faith in your eyes
Never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed

[Outro: James Hetfield]
Follow the god that failed, yeah
Broken is the promise, betrayal
Betrayal, yeah
