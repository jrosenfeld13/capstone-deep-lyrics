I called you brazen

Called you whore right to your face

And watched you silently

And publicly disgraced

I didn't notice

When you strenghted like a vice

That you were tremblin'

And burned beneath the ice, ooh, ooh

Why don't you weep

When I hurt you?

Why don't you weep

When I cut you?

You don't bleed

And the anger

Builds up inside

Why don't you weep

When I hurt you?

Why don't you weep

When I cut you?

You don't bleed

And the anger

Builds up inside

Na, na, na, na, na

Na, na, na, na, na

Na, na, na, na, na

You said a prayer

And I betrayed you with a kiss

You never realized

That all had come to this

So keep your dignity

Don't throw it all to waste

Stronger feelings

And you've ever learned to face, ooh, ooh

Why don't you weep

When I hurt you?

Why don't you weep

When I cut you?

You don't bleed

And the anger

Builds up inside

Why don't you weep

When I hurt you?

Why don't you weep

When I cut you?

You don't bleed

And the anger

Builds up inside

Na, na, na, na, na

Na, na, na, na, na

Na, na, na, na, naa, ooh, ooh

Why don't you weep

When I hurt you?

Why don't you weep

When I cut you?

You don't bleed

And the anger

Builds up inside

Oh why don't you weep

When I hurt you?

Why don't you weep

When I cut you?

You don't bleed

And the anger

Builds up inside, ooh, ooh

Why don't you weep?

(Why ooh, ooh?)

Why don't you weep?

(Why ooh, ooh?)

Why don't you weep?

(Why ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh?)

Why don't you weep, ooh?

Why don't you weep?

Why don't you weep?

Why?

Weep

Weep
