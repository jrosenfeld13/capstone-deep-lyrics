[Verse 1]
A company always on the run
A destiny, oh it's the rising sun
I was born a shotgun in my hands
Behind the gun I'll make my final stand

[Chorus]
And that's why they call me
Bad company
I can't deny
Bad bad company until the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die

[Verse 2]
Rebel souls, deserters we've been called
Chose a gun and threw away the sun
Now these towns they all know our names
The death punch sound is our claim to fame

[Chorus]
And that's why they call me
Bad company
I can't deny
Bad bad company until the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die

[Bridge]
Eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
Blood for blood
We've all gotta die
We've all gotta die

[Chorus]
And that's why they call me
Bad company
I won't deny
Bad Bad company until the day I die
Bad company
I won't deny
Bad bad company until the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die
Until the day I die
