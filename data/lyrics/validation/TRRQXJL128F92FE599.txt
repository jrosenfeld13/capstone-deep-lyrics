I wish I had button eyes and red fat nose
Shaggy cotton skin and just one set of clothes
Sittin' on the shelf in the local department store
With no dreams to dream and nothing to be sorry for

I wish I was a Teddy Bear
Not livin' nor lovin' or goin' nowhere
I wish I was a Teddy Bear
And I'm wishin' that I hadn't fallen in love with you

I wish I had a wooden heart and a sawdust mind
Then your mem'ry wouldn't come around hurtin' all the time
I'd have a sewed on smile and a painted twinkle in my eye
And I never would've ever had to learn how to cry

I wish I was a Teddy Bear
Not livin' nor lovin' or goin' nowhere
I wish I was a Teddy Bear
And I'm wishin' that I hadn't fallen in love with you

I wish I had a string you'd pull to make me say
Hi, I'm Teddy ain't it a lovely day
Then I'd know every time I spoke the words were right
And no one would know the mess I made in my life

I wish I was a Teddy Bear
Not livin' nor lovin' or goin' nowhere
I wish I was a Teddy Bear
And I'm wishin' that I hadn't fallen in love with you

And I'm wishin' I hadn't fallen in love with you
