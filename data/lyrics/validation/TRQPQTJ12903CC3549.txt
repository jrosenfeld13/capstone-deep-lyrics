Daniel Moore

There ain't nothin' in the world
That can take away my memories
Of my travels through the great northwestern
Mountain scenery
With my woman by my side
With her lips like cherry wine
She kissed me, said she loved me
As we crossed the borderline

CHORUS
Don't you fly away woman of mine
Don't you fade away; don't you be that kind
Don't you fly away woman of mine
Tell me that you love me
As we crossed the borderline

If you're ever in Alaska
Take a message to my friend
That the glamour of the city life
Is as empty as the wind
It'll steal away love's joy;
It'll drive a heart stone blind
Makes a cold Alaskan winter
Seem like something warm and fine

Repeat Chorus

Oh, tell me how you love me as we cross that borderline
