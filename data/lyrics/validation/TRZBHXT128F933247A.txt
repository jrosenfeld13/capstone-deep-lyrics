[Verse 1]
Now that we're through
The hell with you
We don't mind
We just give it a sigh

[Verse 2]
We hardly knew
What you were capable of doing
But why don't you give it a try?

[Chorus]
Oh, you learn about it
Oh, you harvest ('til you can make no more)
All that's eating inside
All that's eating inside

[Verse 2]

[Chorus] (x 2)

Can't take no more (x 4)

[Chorus] (x 3)

Can't take no more (x 10)
