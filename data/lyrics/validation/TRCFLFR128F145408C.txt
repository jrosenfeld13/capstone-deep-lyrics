When I'm standing next to you
There's a song to sing
I know everything's feeling right
When I'm standing next to you
Steeple bells ring
Only good things do I see
When you're next to me
When I hold your hand in mine
Different world wakes
A new morning breaks with the sun
When I hold your hand in mine
Children's reaching flight
Through a star lit night, that's what I see
When you're next to me
This love for you, I'm feeling
Has a power that is healing
It can mend the darkest hour with glorious light
When I taste your lips so sweet
I see beggars dine
And the sands of time up and stuff
When I taste your lips so sweet
Black and white bend
Every dog lands at your feet
When you're next to me
This love for you, I'm feeling
Has a power that is healing
It can mend the darkest hour with glorious light
When I'm lying next to you
I feel moonbeams burn
I see rainbows turning to gold
When I'm lying next to you
I hear Angels play
I see sweeter days
I see rivers wind through the end of time
I see hatred fall
From the highest hill
I see God's good grace shining in your eyes
That's what I see when you're next to me
