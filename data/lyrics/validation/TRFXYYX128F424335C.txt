Caught me with your video lies, it gives you something to lie about
Watch me with your retail eye, it gives you someone to spy on
Stab me with your double-blade knife, it gives you something to cry about
Drive me with your chemical high, it gives you something to ride on
I may be an evil girl, with my colgate smile
And if I am an evil girl, you put me on trial
I want to kill on video, I want to go real far
Let me kill celebrities, and be your next media superstar!
Scare me with your little disguise, it gives me someone to hide from
Eating all your roaches and flies, in my mouth like bubble gum
Scar me with your venomous lies, you always have to remember
Feed you with them razorblades, cause nothing lasts forever!
I may be an evil girl, with my colgate smile
And if I am an evil girl, you put me on trial
I want to kill on video, I want to go real far
Let me kill celebrities, and be your next media superstar!
Buy me, kill me, fuck me!
Buy me, hurt me, watch me, you destroy me
(I can't take this shit)
