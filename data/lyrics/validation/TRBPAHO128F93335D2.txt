I'm leaving town
You know I'd hate to be around
When my plane kisses the ground
This time I'll leave it
I'd hate you to see
The weaker side of me
See me fall down on my knees
This time I'll leave it
Every little part of you that aches
Every little piece of me that breaks
Every time I see that face
I'm leaving
Every time you tremble time stand still
Every time I say I won't I will
Every time I see that face I'm leaving
Denied in me
I've become an effigy
Of the man I used to be
This time I'll leave it
I feel your need
Without I would not be complete
A simple tragedy
This time I'll leave it
Every little piece of you that breaks
Every little part of me that aches
Every time I see your face
I'm leaving
Every extra minute's my mistake
Every little breath of yours I take
Every time I see that face I'm leaving
Now I'm living on the second floor
Now I'm missing you more than I ever did before
Every little part of you that aches
Every little piece of me that breaks
Every time I see that face
I'm leaving
Every time you whisper I want more
Every time I'm hanging from your door
Every time I kiss your face
I'm leaving
Now I must say more
Than I could never dream of ever
Or take away the part of you
I'm leaving
Now I think I should consider there
Could never be
Another chance for me to make you see
I'm leaving
