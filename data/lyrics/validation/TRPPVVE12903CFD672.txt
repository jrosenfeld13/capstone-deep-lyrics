Woo

You told me that you loved me so
And then you said you've got to go
Baby, what's it gonna be
You told me that you're gonna stay
And then you up, then you went away
Why you wanna be so mean

All I need is some love and emotion
It's the only thing that turns me on
All I need is some love and emotion
It's the only thing that turns me on

You told me that you would be mine
Baby, till the end of time
Tell me was that just a lie
Girl, you've got me on my knees
Begging for your sympathy
I just want to be your guy

All I need is some love and emotion
It's the only thing that turns me on
All I need is some love and emotion
It's the only thing that turns me on

Woo

All I need is some love and emotion
You know it girl that I've got the notion
Somehow I feel that you got the potion
To make my life complete, woo

Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
All I need is love
Oh, yeah
I need a little love in the morning time

Get nasty
Woo

All I need is some love and emotion (All I need)
It's the only thing that turns me on (All I really need)
All I need is some love and emotion (Woo)
It's the only thing that turns me on (I need a little love in the morning time)

All I need is some love and emotion
It's the only thing that turns me on (All I really need)
All I need is some love and emotion (Woo)
It's the only thing that turns me on (I need a little love in the morning time)

All I need is some love and emotion
It's the only thing that turns me on (All I really need)
All I need is some love and emotion
It's the only thing that turns me on (I need a little love in the morning time)

Yeah
