Home is like a river of goodbye
Without a summer lullaby since you are gone
No one rings the bell from what I've heard
I'm all alone just like a bird without a song

Life is an endless parade, it's no sweet lemonade
Only an empty bottle left in the shade, oh boy

What have I done to make you go ?
Where is the sun ? Where is the snow when you are away ?
Roses seem to fade upon my side
Since you have left, there is no night, there is no day

Life is an endless parade, it's no sweet lemonade
Only an empty bottle left in the shade, oh boy

Life is an endless parade, it's no sweet lemonade
Only an empty bottle left here under the shade
