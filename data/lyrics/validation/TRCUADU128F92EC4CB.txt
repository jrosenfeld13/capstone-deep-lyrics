I know that you miss him
I can tell by the way you kiss him
Get yourself together girl, all right

You say that you love him
But now he's gone so please forget him
Get yourself together girl, all right

I'm just like you, so take my heed
You see me as a friend or a friend in need
Just get yourself together

So if you feel that you need me
I'm here beside you, can't you see me?
Get yourself together and it'll be all right
