Rockabilly guys might be insane
But rockabilly guys they don't eat brains
Those death metal guys they like to wear black
They like to draw pentagrams on their back
They like headbangin'
Those death metal guys

Rockabilly guys like hot rod cars
They like hot women and their neighborhood bars
Death metal guys will grow long hair
And work real hard to have an evil stare
They're kind of medieval
Those death metal guys

Jerry Lee Lewis shot his bass player down
Down to the ground with a .38 round
But death metal guys would have eaten his brain
And people call Jerry Lee Lewis insane

Rockabilly guys like rockabilly chicks
Death metal guys think they're all country hicks
But death metal guys still live with their mom
On the internet learning how to embalm
So they go kill a dog
Those death metal guys

It's really kind of hard to live in harmony
Hot rod cars and blasphemy
Hair in your face or hair way up high
I'm a rockabilly cat not a death metal guy

I'm a rocka, I'm a rocka, I'm a rockabilly guy
Rocka, I'm a rocka, I'm a rockabilly guy
Yeah! Woo!
I'm a rocka, I'm a rocka, I'm a rockabilly guy
And I don't eat brains
Like death metal guys
Like death metal guys
Like death metal guys
Like death metal guys
Death metal guys
