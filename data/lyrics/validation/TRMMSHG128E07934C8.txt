I can already hear your tune
Calling me across the room
When the world and his wife are on my back again
Not enough pleasure, too much pain

When the world is too much with me
Please leave, just go away
I lose my mind completely
Please leave, just go now
In the side street something's moving
Look around, look around
All around you walls are tumbling down
Stop staring at the ground

I can practically see your face
And another revolutionary falls from grace
Hear the thunder in your brain
Not enough sunshine, too much rain

When the light of life has gone
No change for the meter
And then the king of spivs will come
Selling blood by the liter
When nothing's sacred anymore
When the demon's knocking on your door
You'll still be staring down at the floor

Not too many hours from this hour
So long
The storm comes
Or is it just another shower?

Picking up the pieces
Half alive in a nine-to-five
Vacant eyes
Is it any wonder?
Rhyme and scream at the TV screen
Close your eyes

Now the world is too much with me
Please leave, just go away
Before I lose my mind completely
Just leave, please go now
Now nothing's sacred anymore
When the demon's breaking down your door
You'll still be staring down at the floor

Not too many hours from this hour
So long
The storm comes
Or is it just another shower?
Not too many hours from this hour
So long
Now the storm has come
Or is it just another shower?
Or is it just another shower?
Or is it just another shower?
Now the rain has come
Or is it just another shower?
