All I do is dream of you
The Whole night through
With the dawn I still go on
Dreamin' of you
You're every thought, you're everything
You're every song I ever sing
Summer, winter, autumn, and spring
Were there more than 24 hours a day
They'd be spent in sweet content dreamin' away
Skies are grey! Skies are blue!
Morning, noon, and night-time, too
All I do the whole day through is dream of you!

It's the cat's meow!
All I do the whole day through
Is dream of you!
