Gotta drive all night if not a go
Got to designate a driver before the show
It's your turn now at the wheel
There's nothing like a guard rail
To wake you up in the middle of the night

And we are drivin' north, goin' south
It looks like we'll sleep here
We're out of beer
We're headed south on the north bound
Our wheels might as well be square
Cause we're not really getting anywhere
Tire tracks throughout, felt the brakin'
I don't think we're gonna make it
Drivin' around, goin' down
It looks like we'll sleep here
I need a beer

South, goin' south, check us out we're goin' south
South, headed south, check it out, we're goin' down
South, goin' south
