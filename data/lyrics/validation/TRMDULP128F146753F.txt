Flesh n' blood
A human fascination
Acquired the taste
Right on my face
Naughty, lost in lust
A hopeless situation
Let the game begin
I'm shirts you're skins
Naughty
These hunger pains
Growing inside me every day
I feel it in my veins
Burning inside me every day
I wanna eat your body, eat your body
Naughty, naughty, naughty talkin' 'bout your body
Flesh, blood, I think I'm in love
Naughty, naughty, naughty, eating up your body
Driving down
A sticky occupation
I need another shot
Of some food for thought
Naughty
These hunger pains
Growing inside me every day
I feel it in my veins
Burning inside me every day
I wanna eat your body, eat your body
Naughty, naughty, naughty talkin' 'bout your body
Flesh, blood, I think I'm in love
Naughty, naughty, naughty, eating up your body
Everybody's got a need
Everybody's got to feed
On everybody else's body
Everybody's got a need
Everybody's got to feed
On everybody
Vegetarians eat your heart out
