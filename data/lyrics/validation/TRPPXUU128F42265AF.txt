There are diamonds pearls emeralds and rings
None of these jewels show me a thing
I want only only only I want your love

Your eyes your lips set me on fire
Your love your kiss my one desire
I want only only only I want your love

To hold me
To kiss me
To thrill me

I don't want a chest full of gold
Just want someone to have and to hold
I want only only only I want your love
