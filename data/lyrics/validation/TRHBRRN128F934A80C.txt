Midnight, one more night without sleeping
Watching till the morning comes creeping
Green door, what's that secret you're keeping?

There's an old piano
And they play it hot behind the green door;
Don't know what they're doing
But they laugh a lot behind the green door
Wish they'd let me in
So I could find out what's behind the green door

Knocked once, tried to tell them I'd been there;
Door slammed, hospitality's thin there
Wonder just what's going on in there

Saw an eyeball peeping
Through a smoky cloud behind the green door;
When I said "Joe sent me"
Someone laughed out loud behind the green door
All I want to do
Is join the happy crowd behind the green door

Midnight, one more night without sleeping
Watching till the morning comes creeping
Green door, what's that secret you're keeping?

Green door what's that secret you're keeping?

Green door!
