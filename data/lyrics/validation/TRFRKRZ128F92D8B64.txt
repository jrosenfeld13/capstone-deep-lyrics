You could share your skeletons with casual observers
And you could be best friends
With the vagrants and the searchers
Your tender heart was heavy, it was weighing on your soul
The two battled out inside you: neither one could have control

I remember when your rabbit died you put it in the freezer
Made an ornamental coffin
With the shoebox from your sneakers
Went down to help the people of the flood in New Orleans
You was living, you were giving
You were the first one on the scene

Lone Rose, used to call me the High Plains Drifter
Lone Rose, I'll take a lonely ride
Lone Rose, couldn't help but crying, heard about you dying
Least I know it wasn't suicide
'cause I know you didn't want to die

Although you fell out of a window just about a year ago
Some say it was intentional but no one really knows
I'm waiting on the subway, a rat runs across my shoe
There's a woman on the platform over, looks almost like you

Lone Rose, used to call me the Rollin' Rambler
Lone Rose, I'll take the lonely ride
Lone Rose, couldn't help but crying, heard about you dying
Least I know it wasn't suicide:
I know you kinda didn't want to die

You left behind a couple letters you never sent to me:
I kept switching my address so you just let it be
Don't need to ask the coroner to find out what had happened
Was the stupid deadly mixture of cocaine and heroin

Lone Rose, used to call me the High Plains Drifter
Lone Rose, I'll take the lonely ride
Lone Rose, couldn't help the crying, heard about you dying
Least I know it wasn't suicide
'cause I know you didn't want to die

Saw you passing by the Edwardian hotel
In a soaking wet pink parka, you still looked hot as hell
Didn't care about the rain, you said:
"Let it soak me to my bones!"

As it started once again you went to splash it off alone
