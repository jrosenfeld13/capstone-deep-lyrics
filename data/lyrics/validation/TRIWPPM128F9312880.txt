I heard a Spanish melody drifting along Nogales street
In the shadows the accordion man, now
Danced on the keys with his long brown hands
Playin' a song just for you and me
Down in Nogales

I put a dollar in his empty hat
Then we sat on a wall, scared off an old stray cat
Together we saw the clouds roll in from the Gulf of Mexico
The wind was singing and the sky was turning black
Down in Nogales

And in your hand, you were holding a flower you found
On the side of the road, you were twirling it 'round and around
And I, I was dreaming of you, seeing you smiling and laughing
And then the rain came down

Down in Nogales, the rain fell on the bright umbrellas
And the tombstones and the statues near the graveyard walls
Where the weeds grow and the raven calls

And the tall girl talking
In a long blue dress on her cell phone
Down in Nogales

And in your hand, you were holding a flower you found
On the side of the road, you were twirling it round and around
And I, I was dreaming of you

The way I remember your hair in the wind
Seeing you smiling and laughing
And then the rain came down, the rain came down
Oh, the rain came down again
