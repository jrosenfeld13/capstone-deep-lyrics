C'mon, c'mon now baby
Take my little hand
Let's not talk about that
Oh did ya understand?
I wanna kiss you forever
And love ya for all time
I go around the whole world
And know that you are always mine
When I leave this land
Feeling sick and dead
Stand up all alone
That's what your love gets
[That's what your love'll gets]
That's what your love gonna get
I'm not talking 'bout being a riddle
Comic books and vampires
Pleasant memories
They can keep me all waiting
I'd never ever split you for me
Broken heart and broken promise
Sick and wet
I'm a little hung over
That's what your love is gonna get
Hey, help me 'cause I'm singing
Way down low
Oh, c'mon, c'mon pretty baby
You got to give me solid gold
You know I'm gonna hold a little bit longer
Hold on a little bit longer no more
'Cause you more my pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty baby, that's for sure
Sleep at night and at the weekend
There's is no known cure
End of me and you
That's what your love gets
[That's what your love gets]
That's what your love is gonna get
[That's what your love gets]
[That's what your love gets]
Broken heart
Broken promise
[That's what your love gets]
That's what your love is gonna get
