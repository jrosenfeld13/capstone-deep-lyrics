[Verse 1]
Gonna tell Aunt Mary 'bout Uncle John
He claim he got married, but he havin' much fun

[Chorus]
Oh baby, yeah baby, whoo-oo-oo baby
Havin' me some fun tonight!

[Verse 2]
Long tall Sally she's built for speed
She got everything that Uncle John needs

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well, I saw uncle John with bald-headed Sally
He saw Aunt Mary comin' and he ducked back in the alley

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]

[Outro]
Gonna have some fun tonight
Everything's alright
