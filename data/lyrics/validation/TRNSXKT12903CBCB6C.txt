Baby
It happens when you're close to me
My heart starts beating - hey - a strong beat
Oh
I can't leave you alone
Can't leave you alone
Oh
I can't leave you alone
Can't leave you alone
That's why I keep holdin' on
Keep holdin' on
Keep holdin' on
Keep holdin' on

Oh Darling I can't resist your love no more
'Cause darling
I love you
I love you much too much

I can't leave you alone
Can't leave you alone
Oh
I can't leave you alone
Can't leave you alone
That's why I keep holdin' on
Keep holdin' on
Keep holdin' on
Keep holdin' on
Keep holdin' on

Oh
I can't leave you alone
Can't leave you alone
