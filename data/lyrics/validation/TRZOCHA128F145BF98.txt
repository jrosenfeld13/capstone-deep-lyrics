[Verse 1]
When I met you in the restaurant
You could tell I was no debutante
You asked me what's my pleasure
A movie or a measure?
I'll have a cup of tea and tell you of my

[Chorus]
Dreaming, dreaming is free
Dreaming, dreaming is free

[Verse 2]
I don't want to live on charity
Pleasure's real or is it fantasy?
Reel to reel is living rarity
People stop and stare at me
We just walk on by - we just keep on dreaming

[Bridge]
Feet feet, walking a two mile
Meet meet, meet me at the turnstile
I never met him, I'll never forget him
Dream, dream, even for a little while
Dream, dream, filling up an idle hour
Fade away, radiate

[Verse 3]
I sit by and watch the river flow
I sit by and watch the traffic go
Imagine something of your very own
Something you can have and hold
I'd build a road in gold just to have some

[Chorus]
Dreaming, dreaming is free
Dreaming, dreaming is free
Dreaming, dreaming is free
Dreaming, dreaming is free
