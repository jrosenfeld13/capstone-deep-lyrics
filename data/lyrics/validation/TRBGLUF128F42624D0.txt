I knew a stupid prick
He was a fucking dick
And he was looking for an easy way out
He reached into his shit
Ploffered a rusty bit
It was a razorblade / a rusty razorblade
Death by bloodloss / suicide razorblade

And lying on the floor
Just right outside the door
He was about to take his very last breath
The paramedics came yeah it was fucking lame
And he was waiting for the angel of death
