I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill
On Blueberry Hill when I found you
The moon stood still on Blueberry Hill
And lingered until my dreams came true

The wind in the willow played love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made were never to be
Though we're apart you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill

(I found my thrill)
Come climb the hill with me, baby
(On Blueberry Hill)
We'll see what we shall see

(On Blueberry Hill)
I'll bring my horn with me
(When I found you)
I'll be with you where berries are blue

(The moon stood still)
Each afternoon we'll go
(On Blueberry Hill)
Higher than the moon we'll go
(And lingered until)
Then, to a weddin' in June we'll go
(My dreams came true)

The wind in the willow played
(Do you really love me)
Love's sweet melody
(As I love you?)

But all of those vows we made
(Will you still remember)
Were never to be
(When the night is through?)

Though we're apart you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill
