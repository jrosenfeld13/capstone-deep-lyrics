Moments valued
The pull of what they started
Sometimes it feels alright that I don't change

Always on the outside
Hoping for some insight
Been stuck between the lines, and things don't change

Reach out
Consider
And save
Save a breaking heart
Sunken, tired, and starved
Since it's been apart

Say you'll come 'round and watch the dark go light
To be near, to realise more time to talk
Oh, if we had more time to talk

But coldness surrounds
Days come crashing down
It's painted all 'round town  things won't change

Always in twilight
Hope arises inside
Although I've done my time, things don't change

Look up
Consider
And save
Save a breaking heart
Sunken, tired, and starved
Since it's been apart

Oh save
Save a breaking heart
Compromised and scarred
Since it's been apart

Say you'll come 'round and watch the dark go light
To be near, to realise more time to talk
Oh if we had more time to talk
