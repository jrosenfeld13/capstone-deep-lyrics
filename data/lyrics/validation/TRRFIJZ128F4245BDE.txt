Sow the seeds
Sow the seeds to life by packing up to make it right
And all I need
All I need to know
Are you too proud to let it go?

Remember me
Well honestly I don't remember who you are

So it seems
And so it seems tonight
You've got that wild look in your eye
What do you need
What do you need to prove?
The woman that you turn into

Remember me
Well honestly I don't remember who you are
The memory has never been the best
You want a second chance

You stand around your haunted home
Those demons won't leave you alone
Don't forget me when you grow old

Remember me
Well honestly I don't remember who you are

Remember me
Well honestly i don't remember who you are
The memory has never been the best
You want a second chance

You stand around your haunted home
Those demons won't leave you alone
Don't forget me when you grow old

Remember
Remember
