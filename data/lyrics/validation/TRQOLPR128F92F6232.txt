When you find it in your heart
Look this way and I'll never stop
When you can't find what words to say
I'll know what you mean anyways

And you know what you're doing
You get right on up to it
I said, Lord, now it's alright
Come on just take your time

If you feel the night and then the mood is tight
But you know it
And you can see the light but there's no end in sight
But you know

I tell you somebody knows what you're talking about
I tell you somebody knows
I tell you somebody knows what you're talking about
I tell you somebody knows

You can feel it in your brain
When things don't feel quite the same
And you make it all about yourself
Get rid of all the hate and all the self doubt

Oh Lord, you'll be rocking tonight
Somebody will make you feel alright
Feel alright now

Oh, 'cause if you feel the knife and the mood is tight
And you know it
And you can see the light but there's no end in sight
And you know

That I'll do it again, oh, I would gladly do it
Oh, I'll do it again, oh, again now, oh, I would gladly do it
Oh, I'll do it again, oh, I would gladly do it
Oh, I'll do it again, oh, again now, oh, I would gladly do it
Yes, I'll do it again, ooh

Oh Lord, oh Lord
I tell you somebody knows what you're talking about
I tell you somebody knows
I tell you somebody knows what you're talking about
I tell you somebody knows

And I'll do it again, oh, I would gladly do it
Oh, I'll do it again, oh, again now, oh, I would gladly do it
Oh, I'll do it again, oh, I would gladly do it
Oh, I'll do it again, ooh, I would gladly, gladly do it

Oh, again, oh, again, oh, again
Oh Lord, I said again, Lord, oh again now
I would gladly do it, oh, Lord
Oh, again, oh, again now, oh, yeah now
I would gladly do it all over again, oh again
Oh yeah
