Got a knock-kneed mama down in Tennessee
She's short and squatty, she's all right with me
Don't you think I know, mama don't you think I know

Now knock-kneed mama, what you goin' to cook tonight
Whatever you cook, just cook it right
Don't you think I know, mama don't you think I know

She got a face like a washboard, an' a mouth like a tub
Teach my mama that washboard rub
Don't you think I know, mama don't you think I know

Now some people say chitlins are good to eat
I'll never eat chitlins long as hog got feet
Don't you think I know, mama don't you think I know

Takes a long-tailed monkey, short-tailed dog
To do that dance they call falling off the log
Don't you think I know, mama don't you think I know

Now the monkey told the elephant, "you need not grunt
I know you're sore you got your tail in front"
Don't you think I know, mama don't you think I know

Now the monkey told the elephant, "You may be drinking wine
You can't switch your tail like I switch mine"
Don't you think I know, mama don't you think I know
