You see generally
I try to keep my head straight
I try to keep positive thoughts in my mind
I gotta rise above the rest
And fly with the angels
And fly with the angels

Chorus
No regrets, no soul left
Look in my eyes and you'll see that
This rage is dignified
It's all I have inside
No regrets, no soul left
Look in my eyes and you'll see that
This rage is dignified

The vision's tearing me
Memories flow right out to sea
And you know lately
I've been letting things slip
I need a sign from you
Am I gonna sink this ship
Will I ever find myself again...
And fly with the angels
And fly with the angels

Chorus
It's all I have inside

The vision's tearing me
Memories flow right out to sea
Division grips on me
Division grips on me

Chorus
