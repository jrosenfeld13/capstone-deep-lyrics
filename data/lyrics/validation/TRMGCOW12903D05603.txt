[Verse 1]
I know she said
That I don't need her
Cause every time I call
She's sitting sweeter

[Verse 2]
And I know she said
To get near her
But I'm feeling cold
And I must leave her

[Chorus 1]
Sat down here with my head hung down
And I just seem to find
A bit of peace
A bit of love
A bit of something left behind

[Chorus 2]
Sat down here, best intentions
Nothing said, nothing lied
A bit of peace
A bit of love
A bit of something left inside

[Verse 3]
And my heart's content
I say that to please her
Happiness is on her face
It's not mine that greets her

[Verse 4]
Only my disgrace
To admit I need her
But we all fall from grace
Dust me down and keep her

[Chorus 1]
Sat down here with my head hung down
And I just seem to find
A bit of peace
A bit love
A bit of something left behind

[Chorus 2]
Sat down here, best intentions
Nothing said, nothing lied
A bit of peace
A bit of love
A bit of something left inside

We can't go on, we can't go on
We can't go on, we can't go on
We can't go on, we can't go on
We can't go on, we can't

We can't, we can't (Can't go on, no, no)
We can't, we can't (Can't go on, no, no)

We shall go on in this embrace
Cause we can't go on living this way
We'll be like one (...)
Cause we can't go on living this way

We can't go on, we can't go on
We can't go on, we can't go on
