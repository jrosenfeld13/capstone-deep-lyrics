Fourth floor lonely Juanita sits there staring at the screen
Types in, "Can anybody tell me what it all means?"
Tick-tock waiting for an answer, it's no use
Then all at once to her surprise she gets one reply

Until you got love
You know you got nothing
You're missing that something
That's gonna set you free
Until you got love
You'll always be running
Love is that one thing
That everybody needs

Sunday, no one's at the office just Ray at his father's desk
Working trying to fill the shoes that his dad left
"Dear Son," he finds in a letter
"Please try your best to learn from my mistakes
You know work can wait"

Until you got love
You know you got nothing
You're missing that something
That's gonna set you free
Until you got love
You'll always be running
Love is one thing
That everybody needs

There's nothing cool in this groove
Nothing new in what I'm saying
Sometimes the truth is what it is
So why should I apologize for looking for
A better way to live?

Until you got love
You know you got nothing
You're missing that something
That's gonna set you free
Until you got love
You'll always be running
Love is one thing
That everybody needs

Until you got love
You know you got nothing
You're missing that something
That's gonna set you free
Until you got love
You'll always be running
Love is one thing
That everybody needs
