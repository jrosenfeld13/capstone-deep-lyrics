Then she walked away
Quietly so afraid
Smiling but no doubt
Crying her heart out
She really just wants to stay

Then she walked away
Leading her own parade
Nobody's cheering
The voices she's hearing
Are empty remarks she made

How was she to know
That it would come to this
Sorry Miss
They forgot to tell you it was just a game
Just a sad illusion
Now you're on your own
Really on your own
It's still a long way home

Then she walked away
Quietly so afraid
Smiling but no doubt
Crying her heart out
She really just wants to stay

How's she ever gonna face it after this
Emptiness
Got her feeling like she don't exist
Who were you expecting
Now you're on your own
Really on your own
And it's still a long way home

Now you're on your own
Really on your own
And it's still a long way home

Then she walked away
Quietly so afraid
Smiling but no doubt
Crying her heart out
She really just wants to stay

Then she walked away
Leading her own parade
Nobody's cheering
The voices she's hearing
Are empty remarks she made
