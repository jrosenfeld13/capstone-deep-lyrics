You are on a throne tonight, taken by surprise
Princess in a hologram
Lips of flame and heart of soul, bed for me to lie
Daylight kissing her away
Never to be seen
Going out to get them
Turning on the lights again
Turning out your inside
Never been a school for that
Ideal of man, for them
A sight of all the things you like
Even when the leaves are red, colder as it is
A sight of all the thing you like
Lips of flame and heart of soul, bed for me to lie
Daylight kissing her away
Never to be seen
Going out to get them
Turning on the lights again
Turning out your inside
Never been a school for that
Ideal of man, for them
A sight of all the things you like
