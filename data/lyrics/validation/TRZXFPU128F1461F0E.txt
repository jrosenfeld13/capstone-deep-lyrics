I ain't in love, I ain't your bud
I ain't your little turtle dove
I ain't your chick, I ain't your squeeze
I ain't the girl I used to be
But baby, you still shake me
I ain't upset, I ain't a wreck
Cause I forgive and I forget
And I ain't bitter, I ain't sore
And I ain't cryin' anymore
But baby, you still shake me
Yeah baby, you still shake me

Every time I see you out
It makes me want to scream
I can't seem to figure out
What did I ever see
In a fool like you

The things I used to do I don't
The things I would have, now I won't
Yeah I'm o.k. and I'm alright
And I'm not living in denial
But baby, you still shake me
Yeah baby, you still shake me

I ain't in love, I ain't your bud
I ain't your little turtle dove
I ain't your chick, I ain't your squeeze
I ain't the girl I used to be
But baby you still shake me
Yeah baby, you don't know what you do to me, baby
You shake me baby
