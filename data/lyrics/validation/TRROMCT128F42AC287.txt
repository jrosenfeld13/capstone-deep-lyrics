Sitting by the pool
I'm waiting here in plain solitude
Count the people hanging
'round the neighbourhood
I can recognise the fence
Between the girls and the guys
That's the local way
To keep their children wise

Chorus:
The night draws a picture
Of you in my arms
The sound of the discos
And humming of the cars
That's alright
When you come I will be open
To the touch of your love
There's a certain sound
When everything you need can be found
That fills your ears
When your little world starts coming around
The hot African air
It doesn't seem to mind nor to care
To bring some coolness
On the sheets two lovers share
Chorus
Chorus
Chorus
