YES! They made ya
To the bitter pill they gave ya
Just your style
To blame them
Nobody you know can save ya

Get on the right track
Get on the right track
Get on the right track
Get on the right track, now, now

We made ya
Made ya just so we could break ya
It's so sad to see to see ya
Finding enemies to feed ya

Get on the right track
Get on the right track
Get on the right track
Get on the right track, now, now

Killer, killer soul

Yes! leave ya
Dressed as soon as we believe ya
Yes! We'll beat ya
Bleed until the last big eat ya[?]

Get on the right track
Get on the right track
Get on the right track
Get on the right track
Do you know we can be sad?
Yeah

Killer, killer soul
Killer, killer soul

Keep in the rest and kick out the rest
You say ain't a game'
Then keep your cuffs to your chest
It's hard I know!

Before you come in keep in the rest and kick out the rest
You say ain't a game'
Then keep your cuffs to your chest
It's hard I know!

Killer, killer soul
Killer, killer soul
Killer, killer soul
Killer, killer soul
Killer, killer soul
Killer, killer soul
Killer, killer soul
