I press the buttons now
Voice keeps poppin' on the call box out
Mop-man, do you receive?
Ten-four, I gotta pull out
I got an ETA, five-thirty on the dot
A little bit later, it'll thicken the plot

Chorus:
They always tell me what's not is not
I just gotta get that 1-2-3
It's funny how these things always happen to me
I just gotta get that 1-2-3
Now, by the force of circumstance
And by the belt that holds up my pants
I'm held responsible
For this idea that never had a chance
When they call out the guard tonight
He'll cut the alarm and switch off the light

Chorus:
I get a funny feeling that wrong is right
I just gotta get that 1-2-3
It's funny how these things always happen to me
I just gotta get that 1-2-3
1 2 3
A B C
Like you and me
Like 1 2 3
1 2 3

1-2-3
A B C
1-2-3
1 2 3
1-2-3
It's a combination...
I press the buttons noooooooow...
I press the buttons now
Voice keeps poppin' on the call box out
Mop-man, do you receive?
Ten-four, I gotta pull out
I got an ETA, five-thirty on the dot
A little bit later, it'll thicken the plot

Chorus:
They always tell me what's not is not
I just I gotta get that 1-2-3
It's funny how these things always happen to me
I guess I gotta get that 1-2-3
1 2 3
A B C
Like you and me
Like 1 2 3
Not is not
Not-is-not
Not is not
Not is not
