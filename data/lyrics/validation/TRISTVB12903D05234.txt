She'll make it rain on what's supposed to be a sunny day
I'm gonna pay for all my stupidest mistakes
You make me want and do completely different things
Are you listening to me? Are you listening to me?

She's like a shot in the dark, adrenaline in my heart
It always happens when we're together
No matter how much the pain
You know I'll do it again and again until forever

I can't kick the habit 'cause I just gotta have it
But she's the girl who destroys entire worlds

When all the smoke clears, I should turn around and hit the ground
You're such a joke, I'm not sure what I've lost or found
Blame it on me 'cause I can't see this going anywhere
It's just not fair, I can't compare to anyone or anything

She's like a shot in the dark, adrenaline in my heart
It always happens when we're together
No matter how much the pain
You know I'll do it again and again until forever

I can't kick the habit 'cause I just gotta have it
But she's the girl who destroys entire worlds

'Cause you just happened to push me through the fall
That's the way you start it all
'Cause what's yours is mine, let's get it right this time

'Cause it just happened to get us through it all
I don't want to watch this fall
'Cause what's yours is mine, let's get it right this time

She's like a shot in the dark, adrenaline in my heart
It always happens when we're together
No matter how much the pain
You know I'll do it again and again until forever

I can't kick the habit 'cause I just gotta have it
But she's the girl who destroys entire
She's the girl who destroys entire
'Cause she's the girl who destroys my entire world
