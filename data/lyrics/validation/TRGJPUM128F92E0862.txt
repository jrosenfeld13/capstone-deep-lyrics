(Keith, Skeoch)

Down to the wire, on the end of the road
Down to the wire, and the kids don't know
Mother Nature's on her knees, and we're the reason of her disease
Hangin' off the ceiling, climbing up the walls
Crawling on my hands and knees to make it through it all

Now we can change or stay the same, one's the answer and the next to blame
Solution is a world of change

If we're gonna make it through tomorrow

Down in the dirt and fallin' out on the street
Crossin' the line myself (to make it to me)
Mother Nature's still on her knees, and we're the reason of her disease
Hangin' off the ceiling, climbing up the walls
Crawling on my hands and knees to make it through it all

Now we can change or stay the same, one's the answer and the next insane
Solution is a world of change

If we're gonna make it through tomorrow
The solution is to make a change today, oh yeah

Make it, I said make it!

(Solo)

Down to the wire, on the end of the road
Down to the wire, all the kids don't know
Mother Nature's down on her knees, and we're the reason of her disease
Hangin' off the ceiling, climbing up the walls
Crawling on my hands and knees, just to make it, just to make it

Now we can change or stay the same, one's the answer and the next to blame
Solution is a world of change

If we're gonna make it through tomorrow
The solution is to make a change today, okay

If we ever make it, now will we ever make it
Through tomorrow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
Through tomorrow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow - ah!
