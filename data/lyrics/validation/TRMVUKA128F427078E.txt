"Help yourself
If you know why you came
'Cause if you need help," she says
"There's something I've got saved."

This is not what you wanted
These candy coated fakes
This is not what you wanted
This is pain, this is pain

Anacin, we're stumbling again
Anacin, and it's the story of a hundred aisles

"Walk away, from simple on a tray
'Cause if you need help," she says
"These fancy pills don't rate."

This is not what you wanted
A miracle today
This is not what you wanted
This is pain
This is pain

Anacin, we're stumbling again
Anacin, and it's the story of a hundred aisles

Time, is not for sale today
And time, seems so far away
Time, is not for sale today
You, need more, than this
Depressed, come here, try this, boy!

Anacin, we're stumbling again
Anacin, and it's the story of a hundred aisles
Anacin, we're stumbling again
Anacin, and it's the story of a hundred aisles
Anacin...
