Come onto me, it's easy for a long life
Don't be denied forever under the night
Come along, to be this free
Is what you want to
Breaking the line forever under the sun
It will be done together, for each to be one
Come along, to be is easy
Taking the stars
Across the road at the end of this place
It's not far and anyone can go there
It's waste ground, there's no name on this place
But it always has and always will be there
There's no fence, no walls, no fools
Just the summer sun and what you choose
But was it only yesterday
Tomorrow came and handed you the tools
To burn it down, your forgotten ground
The golden bough with a rope
Lies there for you to climb, higher and higher
But by this rope you can hang
If you've forgotten why it was you came there
And you burn it down, your forgotten ground
When you are old and see this
Know this is cold, that when the sun rises
Tall shadows will hold the ground you loved
To you is broken, taken from you
And I carve my name
And then you wrote yours
The black smoke
Will rise up to cover the stars
Nothing said to be forever
Except for the night that will come
When we burn you down
