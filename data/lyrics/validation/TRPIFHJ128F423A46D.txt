Unconditional soon to be damned
An individual high in demand
Institutions fill the begging hands
Clean the ashes where we used to stand
Uninvited with open arms
Complacent walls keeping out all harm

I'm bound, unbound, unwound
Unconditional

Unconditional bad for good
Clutching glad hand misunderstood
A tight cold grip, eager to pull
With a little luck
Fake out the rule
