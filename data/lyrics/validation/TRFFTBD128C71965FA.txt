Lie, I had to lie
I had to say what I felt inside
I can't sleep, I just can't sleep
I walk for miles but I see no trees

Don't you know that they don't understand?
All the days are similar in plan

They'll turn the lights out when I die
They'll turn the lights out when I die
And it's good to know you're with somebody half as good as me
They'll put a statue up outside
And I can watch with pharaoh's eyes
And then they'll all know I was somebody

Kate, you're all washed out
You've had your time now it's just about
That time to give it in, cos someone's waiting to step right in
Don't you know your shoes are out of style?
It's good to spit it out before you smile

They'll turn the lights out when I die
They'll turn the lights out when I die
And it's good to know you're with somebody half as good as me
They'll put a statue up outside
Just like the pharaohs did a high
And then they'll all know I was somebody

All I really know is all I see, I'm half the way
And all I really see is half I know
So what is it that makes me loath the way I am?
So what is it, what does it mean?
When you're half the way I am
