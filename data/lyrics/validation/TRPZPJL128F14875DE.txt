May light fall upon you
Lead you to your home
May I not look on you
Take you for my own

Fair light fell upon you
All our (?) cannot have
First light in a new room
If the first site that I went to
Doesn't feel right right
Doesn't feel new
Feels just like today
And on that day
What can I go by?
When I can't take
To make this go back
I waited so long to see it go bad
