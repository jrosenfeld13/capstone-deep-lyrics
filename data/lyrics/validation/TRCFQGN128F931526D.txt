See all this ice we've crossed
We're at the shore and now we fall
Should have seen this coming you seemed way too secure
And I was hanging on to you
The last dance that you and I had
Was a reckless one
With skates undone
And the last chance for another one
Is a chance I'm letting go
Now i can't see the sun
But I know it's going down
Should have held you tighter should have opened my eyes
Now you'll slip if I hang on to you
And the last dance that you and I had
Was a reckless one
With skates undone
And the last chance for another one
Is a chance I'm letting go
The last dance that you and I had
Was a reckless one
With skates undone
And the last chance for another one
Is a desperate one
When the skates are long gone
And it's a chance I'm letting go
