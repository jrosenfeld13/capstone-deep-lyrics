Wise up because I'm fed up you better back up.(4x)
You got a bad attitude comin' up from inside you better watch your mouth
You got plenty to hide you come across so heavy you're a buck-o-five
Better rest your fist and try to use your mind
I'm not punkin' out
I'm just movin' up say your comments loud
But try to back 'em up keep your ass far away and stay with yourself alone
In a cage aggravate someone else
Wise up because I'm fed up you better back up.(4x)
You in your baggy ass jeans with your baggy ass lip you 'bout to lose
All your shit with the butt of my fist you better use your mind fast
And bring your pressure down quick
'cause you feather weight fuckin' in this heavyweight clique'
You know karate got a shiny gun in your hand got a razor blade hat
With a knife in the brim I ask you all the fuckin questions
Don't look at him your own stupid answers got you what you are in
Wise up because i'm fed up you better back up (4x)
No time spendin on your thinkin because somethin's really strange
Don't care about the drinkin makes the voices go away
Cause they hear what i am thinkin let your ego get away and you'll
Find that you are missing what can teach you everything
-break-
No time spendin on your thinking let frustrations get away
I'm not holdin it inside me i'm just lettin be
What it wants to when it wants to spontaneously how it is how it was, me
Wise up because i'm fed up you better back up (4x)
You better back up (3x)
Wise up because i'm fed up you better back up (2x)
