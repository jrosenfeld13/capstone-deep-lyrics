Just want to cut the cables and let my face fall to the ground
It has been so long since i was two
Expression equals the end
Unleash the dam, I am sorry you must drown
Time to show you who lies within the body of lies
Let them feel the fire within my lungs
I was born of you but i am only me
Engage me, I am locked
Hope is this first sigh of defeat
Undo it, slash and burn me
Help me find my halo in a haystack
