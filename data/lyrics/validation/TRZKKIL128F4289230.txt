Rip out time from the clock
No one keeps up with the hands anyway

Walked a lonely street
Of skeleton grins
A needle full of empty things
But all along we were ok

Everybody stood to see us
And everyone agreed
We lit up like the stars
And everybody stood to see us land
And everyone believed
We lit up like the stars

Wireless words
Float through space
A happy vale for all the dreams
And all the ones who want to know

Soundless waves rolled over us
Thought we were going down like stones
But all along we were ok
All along we were ok
