[Refrain]
Sail away, sail away, my little boy
Let the wind fill your heart with light and joy
Sail away, my little boy

[Verse 1]
Let the rain wash away your cloudy days
Sail away into a dream
Let the wind send you a fantasy
Of the ancient silver sea

[Verse 2]
Now you see that only dreams
Can send you where you want to be
Now you find those faces are not holding places
Where you thought they'd be
And later as you go again
You will agree
That it was all a dream

[Refrain]
Sail away, sail away, my little boy
Let the wind fill your heart with light and joy
Sail away, my little boy

[Outro]
