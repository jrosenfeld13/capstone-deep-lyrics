Everything you thought or were led to believe was a misconception
This unsafe approach at life has killed all hope within
Worthless attempts of achieving happiness
Disgusted, mistrusted, betrayed and persuaded
Reveling such feelings, mistakes of disgrace
The shock and disbelief of reality SETS IN
The weight of the world CRUSHES
These pains within are intolerable
Changes are of utmost importance
Intolerable ways of living brought on by oneself
Waiting to be let down
Depression, remove for all negative surroundings
False perceptions broken dreams
Living this unhappy life is not worth living
Whose life to take?
Mine or theirs
Dismiss the anguish brought one self
Relearn how to live and only trust yourself
Disgusted, mistrusted, betrayed and persuaded
Reveling such feelings, mistakes of disgrace
Obsession
Betrayal
Murder
Suicide
Negative energy trapped and enraged
Unable to fix what has/is
Essence of death kills all in its path
