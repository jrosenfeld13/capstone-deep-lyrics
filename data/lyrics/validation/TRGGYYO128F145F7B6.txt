This is for wifey, I know I put you through alot baby nd you stayed right there
This song is for you

See in my life I had many ups and downs not only that I had some stand stills
And turn arounds and through it all nothing settle why you still stay. Cause
Many times I came home from hanging out to late but in the morning how
Breakfast was still on my plate, but through it all no matter what I do I still
Thank you

This song is for times I made you mad, times I left you sad things I shouldn't
Do things I told you, times I didn't spend with you and my kids if work get in
The way

This song is for you, for all the things you do, took the time to say thank you
To let you know I'd appreciate you
This song is for you, for all the things you do, took the time to say thank
You,thank you I love you

Now I admit I done some foul s**t, some bougus s**t, but you didn't give up on
Me you didn't go nowhere you stayed right by my side. So since you stayed by my
Side I promise I will be the best man the best father that I can be cause when
No one else was there baby you were there woo, woo, woo,woo, woo, woo, woo, woo

This is song for times I made you smile, times I drove you wild, times I gave
You all the love that you deserve the day I said I do gave my heart to you
Girl my love is true

This song is for you, for all the things you do, took the time to say thank you
To let you know I'd appreciate you
This song is for you, for all the things you do, took the time to say thank
You,thank you I love you
