Would you like to come into my deep black hole?
Would you like to climb in we would be so small
I don't know how deep it goes
I don't know how deep you would like to go

Am I the blackest soul you'll ever know?
Am I the blackest soul of them all?
Have you seen any darker one?
Have you seen any, you should let me know

I don't need to tell you that the clock says tick-tock
All these little small things replaced by a cruel thing

Now you've seen how deep the tunnel goes
Now you've seen how black my depression roars
And still this is not the end of it
Still there are miles to tread, can you handle it?

I don't need to tell you that the clock says tick-tock
All these little small things replaced by a cruel thing
