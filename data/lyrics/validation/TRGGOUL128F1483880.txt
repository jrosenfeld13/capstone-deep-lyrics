LATE AT NIGHT - MAYWOOD

Intro
Between eight and half past seven this place is awful quiet
Have to do my shopping, take care of my diet
I run around in circles, never see a soul

1. Refrain
Late at night, early in the morning light, you can see, see them all
Late at night, early in the morning light, you can feel, feel them all

Instrumental |D|A|Em A|D| 2x

Wonder what they're doing this hour of the day?
What will be their temper, what will be their pay?
Is there another meeting about how to change the world?

2. Refrain
Late at night, early in the morning light, you can see, see them all
Late at night, early in the morning light, you can feel, feel them all

3. Refrain
Late at night, early in the morning light, you can see, see them all
Late at night, early in the morning light, you can feel, feel them all

Coda
Late at night, early in the morning light, you can see, see them all
Late at night, early in the morning light, you can feel, feel them all
Late at night, early in the morning light, you can see, see them all
Late at night, early in the morning light, you can feel, feel them all
