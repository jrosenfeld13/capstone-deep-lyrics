I've got a magical radar, feels like I just woke here
If you gonna lose your independency
Please leave the massage
Tests of my strength, a pretty much odd I know

For the rest of my life I will be climbing somewhere
Climbing
(Climbing)
Climbing
(Climbing)
Somewhere
Somewhere

But I have no fear, I have no fear
'Cause Love is here, love is here
Love is here, love is here, love is here

Did you know that I'm looking at you now
With a daisy in my hair, roses in my hand
And broken ribbons in this weak hair?
I hear a danger in the air

For the rest of my life I will be climbing somewhere
Climbing
(Climbing)
Climbing
(Climbing)
Somewhere
Somewhere

But I have no fear, I have no fear
'Cause love is here, love is here
Love is here, love is here, love is here
Love is here, love is here, love is here
Love is

Did you know that I'm looking at you now
With a daisy in my hair, poses in my hand
And broken ribbons in this weak hair?
I hear a danger in the air

For the rest of my life I will be climbing somewhere
Climbing
(Climbing)
Climbing
(Climbing)
Somewhere
