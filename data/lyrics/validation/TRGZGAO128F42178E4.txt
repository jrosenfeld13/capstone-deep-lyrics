Before the blackened walls, this picket white protection serves as a constant curtain to the things a child sees
And blaming innocence, for what you've gone through, and in this day, you built a wall
It's 12 o'clock and she hasn't returned. What have you done with my daughter?
She's not been herself in some days, for her lack of of appearance I'd live to regret
She's dead. Push forward with plans of this escape. Walls, walls, walls, weak and weathered
Weak and weathered. I remember when the lights went out; I remember when the lights when out
You had 3 days, look what you've done. Now all the loveless will encircle. Pray that she is alright, in this time it seems for them
All will. Now I know, now I know not to go. Now, I know. Now she tries to sleep
She tries to pet her hands on something left, how could they believe you?
And as the walls come into her, she will
And as the walls become to her, as the walls cave in, and the walls became to her no more
Don't speak of a sunset she will never see the fucking light again
And if the sunsets she will never see the light of day again
Don't speak of sunsets she will never see the light again sleep tight and know your neighbors well
