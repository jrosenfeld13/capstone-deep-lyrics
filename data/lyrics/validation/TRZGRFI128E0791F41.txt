In the back of my mind a voice speaks
Spells out the master plan
Now I know
She swings with the ease of a hammer
From the truth down through the past
And I know
What's right, went wrong
From when it started
To this the finish
I'll try to find
A place in your new life...

To set the fire
And cover your tracks
Time will tell, the past laughs last

Syllables will try and judge you, will pierce this anecdote
Now I know
Your plea is a case of reason
This deletes your alibi
And I know

Once tried, left wrong
From where it started, to here the finish
I'll try to find
A place in your new life

The traps have been set, and this will change everything

To set the fire
And cover your tracks
Time will tell, the past laughs last
