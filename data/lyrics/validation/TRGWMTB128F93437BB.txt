Something's not right
I'm overcome with fear
Should've stayed home tonight
We've got to get out of here

Feel like taking you home
Feel like being alone
Feel like taking you home
Just wanna be left alone

I tried not to make waves
I tried to go with the flow
And I've been hiding in caves
The only life I know

Feel like taking you home now
Feel like being alone now
Feel like taking you home
Just wanna be left alone now

And my heart's beating fast
But reaction's slow
Just how long it will last?
There's really no way to know

So tell me something that matters
And show me someone who cares
'Cause when it finally shatters
I'll be climbing the stairs

Feel like taking you home now
Feel like being alone now
Don't wanna pick up the phone now
Just wanna be left alone now
I just wanna go home now

I keep in constant motion
I can't stop what I'm feeling
And like a shark in the ocean
I just got to keep swimming

Darling, here comes trouble
Darling, here comes the curse
I'm buried under the rubble
And it only gets worse

Feel like taking you home now
Feel like being alone
Don't wanna pick up the phone now
Just wanna be left alone

Feel like taking you home now
Feel like taking you home
Feel like taking you home now
Feel like taking you home
