I have
A broken heart
It's been broken, and healed
And broken again

Too broken to heal
I feel it burn
And I wish I could put out the fire

It drives me out
Into the night
Looking for dark-eyed lovers
To soothe me and cool me
And tell me sweet lies
Till I've almost forgotten the truth

But this fire in my heart
Shine like a beacon on a hill
And every new heartache
Will make it burn brighter still

And someday you'll see it
I know you will

Every little heartache
Will make it burn brighter still
And the fire in my heart
Will surely shine
You'll see it
I know you will

Ewww, you'll see it
I know you will

Hey, you'll see it
I know you will
