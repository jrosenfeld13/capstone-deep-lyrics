I told you how long we've got
All the time in the world
I've got a thing for you
You've got a thing for me

I've got my mind made up
You've got my heart you know
You've got a thing for me
You've got a thing for me

I told you how long we've got
All the time in the world
I've got a thing for you
You've got a thing for me

I've got my mind made up
You've got my heart you know
You've got a thing for me
You've got a thing for me....

She's gonna leave at 3
That's what her friend told me
Now I can't bear to check the time
Tonight she'll take my heart home with her
But I'm not ready to let it go now
Oh how long have we got?

I told you how long we've got
All the time in the world
I've got a thing for you
You've got a thing for me

I've got my mind made up
You've got my heart you know
You've got a thing for me
You've got a thing for me
For me

And now it looks to me
Like she's about to leave
But as she passes she leans close and says:
"My boy, you got to keep that chin up
I'm gonna come back here next week for now
Just take my telephone number
Just remember what I told you"

I told you how long we've got
All the time in the world
I've got a thing for you
You've got a thing for me

I've got my mind made up
You've got my heart you know
You've got a thing for me
You've got a thing for me

For me
