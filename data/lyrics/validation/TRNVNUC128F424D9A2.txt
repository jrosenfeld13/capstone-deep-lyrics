Got no place for country
Got no place else to hide
Everyone around me's acting physically blind
Easy on that make-up
I can almost see your eyes
Is everyone around me here stupid or

Drawn to the light
The sun has come to show
Shadows that colour the beautiful snow
All around me settles and here we go
(What ya know)
We're comin' down the mountain
Come on lets go, lets go go go

Got no place for country
Got no way to stand out
And when did people start to think
That orange looks like brown
Easy on that lying streak
You're making me laugh out loud
Is everyone around me here stupid or

Drawn to the light
The sun has come to show
Shadows that colour the beautiful snow
All around me settles and here we go
(What ya know)
We're comin' down the mountain
Come on lets go, lets go

I got a place in the country
I got no place for the town
I'm never gonna change until you put me in that ground
When ya gonna wake up girl
You're looking like a clown
And gravity will hit you
Just like everyone

Drawn to the light
The sun has come to show
Shadows that colour the beautiful snow
All around me settles and here we go
(What ya know)
We're comin' down the mountain
Come on lets go, lets go

Drawn to the light
