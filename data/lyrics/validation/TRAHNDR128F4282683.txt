I'm floating thru' the whirly pits
Another dream just blown to bits
I'm tryin' to live and learn, let go
But where to go I just don't know
I've seen some sad and sordid scenes
Strangest fiction  real life sitch
Ain't no stress rehearsal
Just live  one take, that's all...

I've walked this path for quite a while
It's been getting harder every mile
I just love doing what they say
You cannot do

When everything in life seems like
You're slowly goin' nowhere
Make no compromise, have no regrets
When those about you blame and doubt you
Don't you lose your head
Make no compromise, have no regrets

You seem so lost in all the words you speak
That's not to say your cause is weak
You ask  what's wrong?
I ask  what's right?
I'm just too tired to fight tonight

So I smash the mirror with my fist
Blood runs cold down my fingertips
They could never mess with this
Brave heart of mine

When everything in life...

When all about you blame and doubt you
Don't you lose your head
No compromise and no regrets
No compromise and no regrets
Make no compromise, have no regrets
