[Verse 1]
Shuffle can to can, nobody really gives a damn
For every living day, I give myself a hand
Now, I'm scroungy as can be
I got all you normals looking at me
I'll scratch a hole in my life
So everyone can see

[Chorus]
My mind is a mind that I have come to know
And my eyes can't conceive a world that cannot grow

[Verse 2]
And Fridays are always fresh days
Screamin' at the sun
Don't really know what he has done
He don't believe in God and the world as one
So, he rambles through the weeds
Sayin' he will sleep beneath the trees

[Chorus]
My mind is a mind that I have come to know
And my eyes can't conceive a world that cannot grow

And on the day I die, thank God my soul will be released

[Solo]

[Chorus]
I've seen all your eyes
And I've seen all your faces
Can you tell me, honestly, do you want to be free?
Can you look in my eyes?
I've been lots of places
Can you tell me, honestly, that you'd want to be me?
Would you want to be me?
Honestly?
