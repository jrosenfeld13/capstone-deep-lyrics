Soaked in torment, victim of lies
Materialistic, lost in demise
I reject your values
I have my own faith
I have no trust
In the human race
Seek the truth
Ignore all the ignorance
That they shove down your throats
This world serves to corrupt
And to poison your soul
My strength and my honor
Lies within my faith
I can find no acceptance
For the human race
Show me your solutions
And you'll prove you wrong
These lies, greed
And corruption have gone on too long
I reject your values
I have my own faith
I can find no acceptance
For the human race
My strength and my honor
Lies within my faith
I can find no acceptance
For the human race
Show me your solutions
And you'll prove you wrong
These lies, greed
And corruption have gone on too long
Can't stop the pain!
