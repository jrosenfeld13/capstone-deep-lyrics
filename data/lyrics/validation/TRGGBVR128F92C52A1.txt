It's been an Indian summer
And I just lost another
I've been thinking about my mother
As the plane touched down
I feel lost and found
Coming home

Daylight's gonna come
Sing your life life unsung
Lately I've been thinking about you

We hung out in the kitchen
We did a lot of wishing
And dying for a living
If it all goes south with your whiskey mouth
On the run

Daylight's gonna come
Sing your life life unsung
Lately I've been thinking about you

Further than my father
Life for him was harder
There's millionaires and martyrs
We can tell bad jokes
And become our folks
In the end

Daylight's gonna come
Sing your life life unsung
Lately I've been thinking about you

Baby on the run
Oh I hope you're having fun
Lately I've been thinking
Over mountains over money over time
All the glitter in the gutter you can find
