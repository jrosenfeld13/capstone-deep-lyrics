I take my time away
And I see something
And that's my story
And I see something

This takes me back again
And drops me so
This takes me back again
And drops me so far safe

Hey, hey hey, hey
Hey, hey hey, hey
Hey, yeah

I've seen it all go
And I've seen something
I've seen my head grow
And I've seen something

This takes me up again
And drops me so
This takes me back again
And drops me so far safe

I've seen my time away
Close-up and far away
And I've seen it all before
I've seen my head expand, my head expand

Living inside me
Living inside me
It's living inside me
It's living inside me
It's living inside me

Living inside me
Living inside me
It's living inside me
It's living inside me
It's living inside me

Living inside me
Living inside me
Living inside me
Living inside me
Living inside me
