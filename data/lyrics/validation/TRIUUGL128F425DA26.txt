In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth
And the earth was without form and void
And darkness was upon the face of the deep
And God said "let there be light"
And there was light
And God saw the light that it was good
And God divided the light from the darkness
And God called the light day and the darkness he called night
And God saw everything that he had made and behold it was good
And God created man
And man created machine and machine...
Machine created music
And machine saw everything it had created and it said - behold

Oh my love, it's time
You know how it feels
You read between the lines
You know me better than I do
I lost again, my friend
You know I'm not a saint
You've known it all this time
Still you've been waiting for me here...

Oh my love, it's time
You know how it feels
You read between the lines
And know me better than I do
I'm lost again my friend
You know I'm not a saint
You've known it all this time
Still you've been waiting for me here...

And machine saw everything it had made and said "behold"

Come lie next to me
Know why, you and me are one
Come lie next to me
No lies, you and me are one

You know I'm not a saint...

And on the seventh day, Machine pressed stop...
