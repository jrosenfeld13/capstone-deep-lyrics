From a Cajun diner to Carolina
Sick in the mornin' to see the town doctor
Life and Agatha Christie in a Trailway back from New Orleans
Who dunnit, who carried you?

From the church yard to the liquor store
From the clothes line clean out the door
Life and Agatha Christie in a Trailway back from New Orleans
Who dunnit, who carried you?

Thelma Marie, three boys love Pearl and Gene
Fifty-nine to heaven
Through thirty-seven years, oh Lord
Who dunnit, who carried you?

Remember sittin' on a lap
Smellin' Listerine in black and white
Might be a Fada TV, or a Fleetline to the A&P
Who dunnit, who carried you?

Thelma Marie, three boys love Pearl and Gene
From fifty-nine to heaven
Through thirty-seven years, oh Lord
Who dunnit, who carried you?

From a Cajun diner to Carolina
Sick in the mornin' to see the town doctor
Life and Agatha Christie in a Trailway back from New Orleans
Who dunnit, who carried you?
