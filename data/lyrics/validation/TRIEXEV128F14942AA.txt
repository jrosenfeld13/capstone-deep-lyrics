Now we're lost at sea
Faded pictures and me
With hearts made of stone
The feet that cannot run

And we bought it all
And we sold it back
It was your favorite trick
And it was gone and that was that
Was gone and that was that

I owe it all to the movies
When I was thinking just you and me
I guess none of this has to last
And it was far too much, too much to ask

And we bought it all
And we sold it back
It was your favorite trick
And it was gone and that was that
Was gone and that was that

Was gone and that was that

Now we're lost at sea
And I was thinking just you and me
