Crying tears
Upon your picture
You turned your back
Can't get you out of my head
You can run from me
But I will find you
A lover spurned
Is one that will haunt you
I'm watching you
I'm waiting here for you
I will never leave you
Look what you've done
I took the pictures
I stole the images
I'll tear your life apart
I have a photograph
It has your eyes scratched out
Deface it
In the shadows
I watch you walking
Outside your window
I often watch you sleeping
Just keep looking
Over your shoulder
That smiling photograph of you
Is torn to pieces
I'm watching you
I'm waiting here for you
I will never leave you
I took the pictures
I stole the images
I'll tear your life apart
I have a photograph
It has your eyes scratched out
Deface it
Deface you
