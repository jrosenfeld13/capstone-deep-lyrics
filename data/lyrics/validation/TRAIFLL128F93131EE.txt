I think I'm falling in love
I think I'm fallin baby (x2)

With you(x2)
I think I'm fallin baby

I remember the first day that I saw you
I thought there's something about you I already knew
So how is it baby that we never met before
Cause now that I know you girl there's nothing I want more

I think I'm falling in love
I think I'm fallin baby (x2)

With you(x2)
I think I'm fallin baby

I lie awake at night just to watch you sleep
And then you smile that way it makes me weak
I never thought that I would find someone to love
Dontcha you know you're my angel girl sent from up above

I think I'm falling in love
I think I'm fallin baby (x2)

With you(x2)
I think I'm fallin baby

Girl you made it so easy to tell you how i feel
I never thought in this lifetime i would find a love so real

I think I'm falling in love
I think I'm fallin baby (x6)

With you
