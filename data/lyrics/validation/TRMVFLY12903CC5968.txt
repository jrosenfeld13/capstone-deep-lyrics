I've got some bad news
Somebody's gotta lose
There'll be some bad blood
Now look who's winning
And look who's won

And everything I do
Is for a lack of anything better to
And everything I've done
Might be for nothing
But you might be wrong

There is no way it "could be"
No way it "should have been"
Only reality
There is only the way it is

And no thanks to you
You gave me nothing else to choose
And no thanks to you
You've always got something to prove

This is the last time
This is the last time
This is the last time
You make me feel empty
This is the last time...
