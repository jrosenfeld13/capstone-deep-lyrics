[Verse 1]
The movie started to play, and the place began to roar
And I was listening to the beat that had me jamming
I grabbed the girl, and we twirled
We were growing strong a new thing, yeah
Then I looked up and found she had the glow
Tearing it up, baby

[Chorus]
Oh, girl, I got my eyes on you
Girl, youre too much
Oh, girl, I got my eyes on you
Youre shaking me up

[Verse 2]
She carried on, she didnt care
She could dance, I sweargo head, baby
But I was blind to see she only wouldnt dance for me
She was teasing me with each moveI had to talk to her
I just cant wait to get you up on the floor

[Chorus]
Oh, girl, I got my eyes on you
Girl, youre too much
Oh, girl, I got my eyes on you
Youre shaking me up

Oh, girl, I got my eyes on you
Girl, youre too much
Oh, girl, I got my eyes on you
Youre shaking me up

[Bridge]
You see, baby, that I can dance
You know you move meI never did this well, yeah
Hey, baby, Im doing swell
You inspire me, ooh
I never moved like thisI could hardly do The Twist
Im gonna shake, shake, shake until it breaks
I wanna do it like you
Im gonna shake, and shake, and shake, and shake my boom boom
And shake my boom boom
And shake my boom boom
And shake my boom boom
And shake my boom boom

Girl, I cant keep my eyes off of you
Girl, I cant keep my eyes off of you
Girl, I cant keep my eyes off of you
Girl, I cant keep my eyes off of you, you, you

[Chorus]
Oh, girl, I got my eyes on you
Girl, youre too much
Oh, girl, I got my eyes on you
Youre shaking me up

Oh, girl, I got my eyes on you
Girl, youre too much
Oh, girl, I got my eyes on you
Youre shaking me up
