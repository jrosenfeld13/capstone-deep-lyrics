I left my heart in Sa n Francisco
High on a hill it call to me
To be where little cable cars
Climb halfway to the stars!

The morning fog may chill the air, I don't care!
My love waits there in San Francisco
Above the blue and windy sea
When I come home to you, San Francisco
Your golden sun will shine for me!

I left my heart in San Francisco
High on a hill it calls to me
To be where little cable cars
Climb halfway to the stars!

The morning fog may chill the air, I don't care!
My love waits there in San Francisco
Above the blue and windy sea
When I come home to you, San Francisco
