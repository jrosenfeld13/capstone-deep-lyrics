The earth quakes, and the seas are rising
As the warlock looks deep into the flames
The fires of evil are reflected in his abysmal eyes
As he calls upon the ancient ones
I call upon thee, keeper of the darkest flame
To drink from the chalice of souls
I call upon thee, king of all beasts
Lord of the hunt, silent stalker of the night
I call upon thee, keeper of all hatred and anguish
The one who holds the cosmic pain
I call upon thee, custodian of the infernal legions
God of war and the hatred storms

The sky spit flames, Armageddon has come
The wrath of Satan descends upon this mortal world
Men revert to beasts, suicidal despair for his glory
Every mind is clutched in terror
As a vortex of evil surrounds the warlock flames

The legions of Satan trample through the flames
The earth is scarred and burned like dead skin
Angels' blood smirched the Nazarene divine kingdom
Armageddon finally comes
The wind carries ashes and the smell of burned flesh
The rivers are filled with blood
The mortals are captured in an irreversible strife for their souls
Against the unyielding forces of evil
Armageddon finally comes

Angels weep as they slowly sink down the spears
Their kingdom is gone, now ruled by the cloven hooves
Once again, the Nazarene whore is nailed
But this time no devotees are left behind
