My everything
I only imagine you in every way
I only think of you all night and all day
I only want you when I'm awake and when I'm sleep
You don't mean a thing cause you mean everything to me (oh-ho)

I'm your shelter in the rain (yeah)
I'll take away the pain
Never have to hurt again (oh-ohhh)
Wanna be your love supreme
Without you I'm not complete (noo)
Your my everything (and I just want you to know)

I breathe you girl
I eat you girl (and I)

I dream you girl
You complete my world
Your my everything

I'd never die for you
I'd rather live to love you
You could take my arms
I'd still find ways to touch you (yeah)
You could take my legs
I'd still run to your rescue
I love you, I really do
And I

I'm your shelter in the rain (yeah)
