I I I Muffin Muffin
I I Muffin Muffin
I I Oh Oh

Must Be Dreamin'
I Smell Muffins!
Happens Everytime I help sort the berries for Pepperidge Farm muffins
They only want the plumpest sweetest berries
Makes the same choice about baking our muffins
See Pepperidge Farm still remembers:
Simple things make better muffins
(childish laughter)
Muffin
