I've got to keep myself from situations
Must hold my moral ground and never fall
'Cause all I get is someone I can't talk to
All I get is weight that I can't hold

Ooooooo
You can't see them
Ooooooo
Fashioning their lives
Ooooooo
You can't see them
And I know
There's nowhere to hide

So now I'm cold and no one wants to know me
And all I want is someone to explain
All around me there are selfish faces
Wondering who to cry on next

Ooooooo
You can't see them
Ooooooo
Fashioning their lives
Ooooooo
You can't see them
And I know
And I know there's nowhere to hide

I've got to keep myself from situations
Must hold my moral ground and never fall
'Cause all I get is someone I can't talk to
All I get is weight that I can't hold

Ooooooo
You can't see them
Ooooooo
Fashioning their lives
Ooooooo
You can't see them
And I know
And I know there's nowhere to hide
