Baby
It's like eleven o'clock
You know we got to get over to the mall
Because I can't lie to you
If you want to stay with me
You got to change your wardrobe

You know there's something about you girl
Cause I just can't seem to get past your curves

Baby do you like my clothes?
Cause I sure don't like yours
Unless they're lying on the floor
With your body next to me baby

(I need your love) I need your love

Hyper-color tells me where my baby is hot
Cause I can see your sweatpants gettin' dark in the crotch
Someone please, get her out of that Tommy Gear
I saw that shirt at TJ Max, double x earlier this year

Baby do you like my clothes?
Cause I sure don't like yours
Unless they're lying on the floor
With your body next to me baby

I need your love (I need)
Tonight

(Baby) Baby Baby Please
Baby do you like my pose?
Kick it girl, do you like my clothes?
