[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
I had an out of body experience
The other day her name was Jesus
And for her
Everyone cried
Everyone cried
Everyone cried

[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Try her philosophy
Try her philosophy
Try her philosophy, try!
You die for her philosophy
Die for her philosophy
Die her philosophy, die!

[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Crossed and terrored ravages of architecture
Led me thy blades
We're crossed and terrored ravages of architecture
Hoist around the spade

[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
Try her philosophy
Try her philosophy
Try her philosophy, try!
You die for her philosophy
Die for her philosophy
Die her philosophy, die!

[Breakdown: Serj Tankian (& Daron Malakian)]
DIEEE!
DIEEE!
DIEEE!
WHYYY!
Lie naked on the floor and
Let the messiah go through our souls
Lie naked on the floor and
Let the messiah go all through our souls
DIEEE! (like a motherfucker)
DIEEE! (like a motherfucker)
DIEEE! (like a motherfucker)
WHYYY! (like a motherfucker)
I wanna fuck my way to the garden
'Cause everyone needs a mother... fucker!

[Outro: Serj Tankian]
The following of a Christ
The following of a Christ
The following of a Christ
The following of a Christ
The falling of Christ
The falling of Christ
The falling of Christ
The falling of Christ
