Music: Lynch, Norman

You made your first mistake
The way you let me down
You're always on the make honey
Fire burning in my soul
It cuts me deep inside
Talking like you just don't care
You know that ain't right

'Cause I've had enough of walking out that door
I realize you'll never change

Never said I'd be no bed of roses
You know all through the love an'
Pain you keep me hanging on
You keep me hanging on
All out of reasons of you wasting my
Time and takin' my pride
To me you'll never change

You were the one to blame
You set my soul to flame
Comin' on like potion that shows me love
An' brngs me pain
Tearin' out my heart inside is how you
Get your kicks
But I' just your lover junkie
Girl I need your fix

'Cause I had enough of walking out that door
I realize you'll never change

Never said I'd be no bed of roses
You know all through the love an'
Pain you keep me hanging on
You keep me hanging on
All out of reasons of you wasting my
Time and takin' my pride
To me you'll never change

'Cause I had enough of walking out that door
I realize that you'll never change

Never said I'd be no bed of roses
You know all through the love an'
Pain you keep me hanging on
You keep me hanging on
All out of reasons of you wasting my
Time and takin' my pride
To me you'll never change
