Out in the woods we play our songs
And travel through the woodlands together
In the light of heaven
And the silence of the world
Keeping in touch with the sun
Keeping it for everyone
Latter day dreams that come your way
Will gather in the light
Everything about today just mellows
In the ligght: in your eyes

I think about silent list
Drowned this summer, travel light
All the deeds and the candlelight
But there is no explaining it
Let the weary come around-one more time-
One more time
Let the weary come one more time around
I should have guessed that things

Were getting out of hand, the other day
When you told me that you'd gone and left
Your father's ways behind
And you thought that you, couldn't understand him
Well, he didn't really answer the dreams
That you'd planned
So you chased around, all those times
That come between you, yourself and yourself
One more time, one more time, one more time
Did you have to think about it, one more time
Put yourself under pressure one more time
One more time

Things are looking better now
I heard you say the other day that you knew
So many times I've tried to understand
We go through
Then again it's the morning light
That can catch my heart aflame
Just the thought of your sweet face
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over and over and over and over again
