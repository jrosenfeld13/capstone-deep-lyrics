Disastrous killings
Torturing slaves of mankind
Unknowing
Forsaken by christ
Victims torn apart
And brutally savaged
Pieces of bloodripping flesh
For human consumption

I'm impelled to kill
By wild blood demons
The spirit inside me
Commanded me to kill

Exploring the innards
Of the deceased
The urge to devour
For my sexual pleasure
Laying down
With their legs spread wide
Anally penetrated
With my knife

I'm impelled to kill
By wild blood demons
The spirit inside me
Commanded me to kill
