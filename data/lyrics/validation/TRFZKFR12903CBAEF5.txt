My music is so divine
It can make you
Feel a little better now!
Stay with me all night
I rock you one time
Come on, come on, come on
I wanna make you
Feel a little better now!
I don't need no money
I don't need no wine
To drive me insane, mess up my brain
Come mek we dub it and to feel
A little better now!
Come mek we rub it and to feel a little better!
Come mek we dub it and to feel
A little better now!
Come mek we rub it and to feel a little better!
This music is sweeter than wine
It can make you
Feel a little better now!
And it's a long, long, long, long, time
We no have a little nice time
Feel a little better now!
Come mek we dub it and to feel
A little better now!
Come mek we rub it and to feel a little better!
Come mek we dub it and to feel
A little better now!
Come mek we rub it and to feel a little better!
