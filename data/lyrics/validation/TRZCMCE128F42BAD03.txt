Isn't summer special easy hair
Relax it wasn't locked tight
And you cased out the revenue
Always look for it easy

Look at those girls
So young so young
Still piss their pants
With their hope dogs mangey
'cause their heart snakes lazy

Isn't summer special easy hair
Relax it wasn't locked tight
And you cased out the revenue
Always look for it easy

Family's something fixed
That's fine
You can not never move away
Keep in touch if their listening
If not then stay away

Hey that's really hard to say
If i didn't knock it now
I wouldn't knock it then
That's really hard to say
If i didn't knock it then
Why would i knock it now

Isn't summer special
Easy hair
Relax it wasn't locked
And you cased out all revenue
Always looked for it easy
Look at those boys
So young so young
Still piss their pants
With their hope dogs mangey
'cause their heart snakes lazy

Isn't summer special easy hair
Relax it wasn't locked tight
And you cased out the revenue
Always look for it easy
