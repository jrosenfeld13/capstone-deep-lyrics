Lyin, cheatin, hurtin, thats all you seem to do
Messin around, with every girl in town
Puttin me down for thinkin of someone new
Always the same, playin your game
Drive me insane, troubles gonna come to you
One of these days, and it wont be long
Youll look for me, but, baby, Ill be gone
This is all I gotta say to ya, baby
Your time is gonna come, your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come, your time is gonna come
Made up my mind, break you this time
Wont be so kind, its my turn to cry
Do what you want, I wont take the brunt
Its fadin away, cant feel you anymore
Dont care what you say cause Im goin away to stay
Gonna make you pay for that great big hole in my heart
People talkin all around
Watch out, baby, no longer is the joke gonna be on my heart
You been bad to me, baby, but its comin back home to you
Your time is gonna come, your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come, your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come, bye, bye-bye, baby
Your time is gonna come, right now, right now
Your time is gonna come, believe me, my girl
Your time is gonna come, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Your time is gonna come, nah-nah, nah-nah, nah-nah
Your time is gonna come, Im not likely to wait for ya
Your time is gonna come, goodbye, baby
Your time
