Silver bells (silver bells)
Silver bells (silver bells)
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling (ring-a-ling)
Hear them ring (hear them ring)
Soon it will be Christmas day

City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing
Greeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you hear

Silver bells (silver bells)
Silver bells (silver bells)
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling (ring-a-ling)
Hear them ring (hear them ring)
Soon it will be Christmas day

Silver bells (silver bells)
Silver bells (silver bells)
Soon it will be Christmas day
