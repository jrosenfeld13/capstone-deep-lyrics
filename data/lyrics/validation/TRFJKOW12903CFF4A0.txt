Clock is ticking while I'm killing time
Spinning all around
Nothing else that you can do to turn it back
Wicked partnership in this crime
Ripping off the best
Condescending smile

Trying to forget
(Wasting my time)
We're falling right through
Lying to forget
(Telling more lies)
We're raising our truth

Go on and tease me

Clock is ticking while I'm stealing time
Can't you turn it back?
Stop the cycle, set it free and run away
Silent sneaking along my path
Rugged the road but we
Feel it like we're flying

Trying to forget
(Wasting my time)
We're falling right through
Lying to forget
(Telling more lies)
We're raising our truth

Trying to forget
(Wasting my time)
We're falling right through
Lying to forget
(Telling more lies)
We're raising our truth
