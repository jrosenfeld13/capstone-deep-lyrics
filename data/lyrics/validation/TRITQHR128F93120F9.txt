Give me a reason
For leaving the party
I'll leave by the entrance
The same way I came
I'm not
Here to enjoy you, I'm
Here to endure you
I'm leaving the party
The same way I came

It's so fine
Stormin' across the sea
It's alright
What the drunk is explaining to me
It's OK - I haven't seen anyone at all
It's all night
I've been waiting
It's all night
I've been waiting

Give me a reason
For leaving the party
I'll leave by the entrance
The same way I came
I'm not
Here to enjoy you, I'm
Here to endure you
I'm leaving the party
The same way I came

It's alright
These are my oldest suede shoes
It's alright
I feel Elvisy
I get the blues too
It's OK
But I will pass upon this pipe
It's OK
Since I don't see anyone tonight

Give me a reason
For leaving the party
I'll leave by the entrance
The same way I came
I'm not
Here to enjoy you, I'm
Here to endure you
I'm leaving the party
The same way I came

It's so fine
Sharing your stories with me
It's alright in explaining

I still get to sleep with me
It's OK
I haven't seen anyone at all
It's all night
I've been waiting
It's all night
I've been waiting

Give me a reason
For leaving the party
I'll leave by the entrance
The same way I came
I'm not
Here to enjoy you, I'm
Here to endure you
I'm leaving the party
The same way I came
