This is the moment, it's on the line, which way you gonna fall? In the middle between wrong and right, but you know after all
It's your life what you gonna do, the world is watching you, everyday the choices you make, say what you are and who, your heart beats for, It's an open door, It's your life
Are you who you always said you would be? With a sinking feeling in your chest. Always waiting for somone else to fix you, tell me when did you forget
It's your life what you gonna do, the world is watching you, everyday the choices you make, say what you are and who, your heart beats for, It's an open door, It's your life
To live the way that you believe. This is your oportunity, to let your life be one thats lights the way
It's your life what you gonna do, the world is watching you, everyday the choices you make, say what you are and who, your heart beats for, It's an open door, It's your life
