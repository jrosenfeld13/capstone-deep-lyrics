I'm sitting alone by my window at home
See the sun shining bright but I can't get no light
Oh it hurts me so strong
Tell me what went wrong
Tell me why this must be
Why did this happen to me oh ooh

I know that you're dead but I won't realize
I know you were fat, you were all oversized
You've been mean all the time
So I had to kill you
After that I felt fine
But now I'm missing you ah uh
Please tell me

What else should I do--just waiting for you
Make my dreams all come true--
I'm waiting for you

I know that you're dead...

Will she ever come back, six feet under she lies
Can she dig herself out
Can she find her way home to me...

Shanananana--waiting for you
