He is an empty shell
- shell-shocked luciferian soul

He is an empty shell
- drained and sealed
He is an empty shell
- penetrating cold
He is an empty shell
- empty luciferian soul

How furiously and bombastic
He proclaimed his destruction
Of a mortal coil

In the end it seemed
This was his only possession

Long past were his "glorious" days
Of filth and lies
And he has reached out to stop time
At its end

He is an empty shell
- shell-shocked luciferian heart
He is an empty shell
- drained and sealed
He is an empty shell
- penetrating cold
He is an empty shell
- empty luciferian soul

The constant struggle for a moment of quiet indulgence
Eventually stirred and quaked the earth so hard
It swallowed him in a dark and heavy cloud
Slowly and gently starving him into insanity

An inferno of ice
With an ever burning
Bleeding
Heart
