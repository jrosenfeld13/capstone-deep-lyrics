I'm giving my all, encapsulate the signs
You give me the talk, dissect, distract my mind
I'm hitting the wall, crashed out right to the core
You're watching me stall, but still I push for more

It's on the blade but let it slide off
You've got the brain but I'll let it slide
It's on the blade but let it slide off
You've got the brain but I'll let it slide

I'm giving my all, so I'll erase the old
You give me the talk, I ordered speech to go
I'm hitting the wall, but now I'm never sure
You're watching me stall, now watch me push for more

Hands are stained, soul is chained, mind is made up
Heart is tame, chopped and changed, messed my game up
Hands are stained, soul is chained, mind is made up
Heart is tame, chopped and changed, messed my game up

I'm taking a side, in this 'Battle Royale'
You're taking it light, I see the knives are out
But if you can find, a way to call the draw
I know you'll decide, to put this all on hold

It's on the blade but let it slide off
You've got the brain but I'll let it slide
It's on the blade but let it slide off
You've got the brain but I'll let it slide

Hands are stained, soul is chained, mind is made up
Heart is tame, chopped and changed, messed my game up
Hands are stained, soul is chained, mind is made up
Heart is tame, chopped and changed, messed my game up

It's on the blade but let it slide off
You've got the brain but I'll let it slide

I'm giving my all, so I'll erase the old
You give me the talk, I ordered speech to go
I'm hitting the wall, but now I'm never sure
You're watching me stall, now watch me push for more

Hands are stained, soul is chained, mind is made up
Heart is tame, chopped and changed, messed my game up
Hands are stained, soul is chained, mind is made up
Heart is tame, chopped and changed, messed my game up
