[Verse 1]
It seems more and more the future's filled with uncertainty we seem to find ourselves living in an age of anxiety
I know, we go, on living fearfully the leaders of the world won't realize their responsibility

[Chorus]
I say, I say will we get blown away
Can we go on existing hoping for another day?
One day, one day, we can get blown away or we can stop the madness before it's too late and we get blown away

[Verse 2]
You tell me that you're scared well so am I
We'll never get any answers asking the question why
We can't, romance, keep living day to day
We all must find some way to overcome the apathy

[Chorus]
I say, I say will we get blown away can we go on existing hoping for another day
One day, one day, we can get blown away or we can stop the madness before it's too late and we get blown away

[Verse 2]
I know, we go, on living fearfully
We can't, romance, keep living day to day i know that many say there seems to be no way there's no deceiving me

[Chorus]
I say, I say will we get blown away can we go on existing hoping for another day
One day, one day, we can get blown away or we can stop the madness before it's too late and we get blown away

[Verse 3]
Apearance is not reality death is the end of life ah
Why should life all labour be
Let us alone; time driveth onward fast
Let us alone; what is it that will last?
Let us alone; what pleasure can we have to war with evil?
Is their any peace?

[Chorus]
I say, I say will we get blown away can we go on existing hoping for another day
One day, one day, we can get blown away or we can stop the madness before it's too late and we go
