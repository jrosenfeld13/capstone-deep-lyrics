Battered down busted broke
Sick and tired losing hope
Out of shape worn out
Don't know what it's all about

Everyday it's all i'm thinking
Slows me down and i feel like i'm sinking in mud
And it's only just begun
Your fears want control and there's no place to run

I looked at the pieces and tried to pick up
But day after day they get stuck
I've tried to look past it
But it just sees through
And leaves me with one thing to do

I'lll keep on trying
I know i should
Get back to a place
Where i once felt good

I'll keep on fighting
I'll bet my life
I'll never let it take me alive!

Delirium
Masked by my delirium
Lose my mind
Delirium

There's no place to run
And it's only just begun
Your fears want control
And there's no place to run
