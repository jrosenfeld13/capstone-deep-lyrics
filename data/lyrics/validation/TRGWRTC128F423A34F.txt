Although our music and our drugs stayed the same
Although our music and our interests are the same
We've been together, fuckers from the well
We smoked in heaven and we still got hell

Hell
Wants you back

Although our music and our drugs stayed the same
Although our interests and our music stayed the same
We've went together, druggers from the well
We smoked in heaven and we still got hell

Hell
Needs me
Hell
Wants me oh

Lets go

Give me give me give me, give me give me give me, a break
Give me give me give me, give me give me give me, a break

Hell
Fuck about everything allowed

Hell
Fuck about everything

Although our music and our drugs stayed the same
Although our interests and our music stayed the same
We went together, druggers from the well
We smoked in heaven and we still got hell
