All these things, I don't understand (All these things)
All these things, I don't understand (Yeah yeah!)

Making small talk till there's nothing left to say
Make believing that it's just another day
My heart keeps telling me that come what may
There's something going wrong
People smiling in their usual vacant way
As if implying that everything's ok
I'll be a fool you can lead my heart astray
There's something going wrong

All these things, I don't understand (I don't understand)
All these things, I don't understand (Oh all these things)

Get home early, take some time to unwind
Just for a while we'll leave the world behind
Wake up your heart and open your mind
There's something going wrong
Still pretending we'll have ourselves a ball
Ignore the writing that is written on the wall
Cards on the table, I wish I knew it all
I wish I knew it all

All these things, I don't understand (I don't understand)
All these things, I don't understand (No! All these things that I don't understand)
All these things, I don't understand (All these things yeah)
All these things, I don't understand (All these things ohohhhhhhhh!!!! Yeaahhh)

Do do do do, do do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do, do do do do

Then I sidetrack, what are these thoughts?
What are these feelings?
What is these doubts? What is the meaning?
It's hard to tell, whether it's night or day, bright or grey
Should this bird fly away?
Right away - I try and fight today
If it's lost then I would truly grieve
Cos it's not what I truly need
Cos it's not what I want to believe
So I ask myself, is it me, is it she, is it we
Is it us or is it him?
Now who's him? God knows
Tears run down my nose, my body froze
I suppose I should really ask the question
What's wrong? Where's the love gone?
What's with the tension? Who's on the phone?
Is there something you need to mention?
My heart's beating heavily
What you not telling me?
Why you're not belling me?
Is he standing next to me?

Keeping our cool, and playing so polite
Something telling me it just ain't right
You'd get an Oscar if you weren't so uptight
There's something going on
The resolution to this ain't gonna be
The word denial seems appropriate to me
You'll never change so I guess it's up to me
There's something going on

All these things, I don't understand (I don't understand)
All these things, I don't understand (oh no, I don't understand, aaaaowww)

Do do do do, do do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do, do do do no!
