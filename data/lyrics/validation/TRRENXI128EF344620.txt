Baby, let me be good to you
I'll do anything you want me to
Your love has brought me around
Every time I was feeling down
And I'm so glad you gave everything you had
Now it's my turn
Baby, let me be good to you
Now sit in your easy chair
What you want, I'll bring it there
Even good can be better
Here's my love on a silver platter take it all
Baby, let me be good to you
Here it is, take it all
Don't be shy you need no alibi
I wanna do it
Baby, let me be good to you
Here's my love, take it all
Don't be shy you need no alibi
I wanna do it
Baby, let me, oh, I wanna be good to you
Baby, let me I wanna be good to you
Baby, baby, let me be good to you
Oh, I wanna be so good
Ooh, baby, baby please let me be good to you
Oh, I wanna be so good
Oh, baby, oh, baby I wanna be good to you
