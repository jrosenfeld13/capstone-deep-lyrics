I run through cars, near and far
Watch me break them all apart
Never mind, that's a lie
I found the cure, all of your
Physical ailments no more
In my mind, you're alright
I'm miles away, across the airwaves
I'm miles out across the airwaves now

Dream forever
We can dream forever
Dream forever
We can, together, together
Dream forever
We can dream forever
Still we'll never
Have it together, together

I drive through stars, fly my cars
Watch me break the sky apart
Never mind, that's a lie
I always win, perfect skin
Perfect everything within
In my mind, I'm alright
I'm miles away, across the airwaves
I'm miles out across the airwaves now

Dream forever
We can dream forever
Dream forever
We can, together, together
Dream forever
We can dream forever
Still we'll never
Have it together, together

I'm miles away, across the airwaves
I'm miles out across the airwaves now

Dream forever
We can dream forever
Dream forever
We can, together, together
Dream forever
We can dream forever
Still we'll never
Have it together, together
