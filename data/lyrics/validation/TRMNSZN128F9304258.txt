Bonnie was a pretty girl
Eyes as deep as the ocean
She was my first true love
I thought if I could make her love me
I could change the world as I knew it
I could change my circumstance
That's what I believed

I said, save me from my sorrow
Love me like there's no tomorrow
Save me

Peg was a pretty girl
A smile as wide as the ocean
She was my next true love
I thought if I could make her love me
I could change the world as I knew it
I could change my circumstance
That's what I believed

And I said, save me from my sorrow
Love me like there's no tomorrow
Save me

Come on and save me from my sorrow
Love me like there's no tomorrow
Save me

Then the Savior found my world
He calmed my sea of emotion
With a voice full of love
And now I know He loves me
He changed my world as I knew it
I traded in my circumstance
For a love I believe

He came and saved me from my sorrow
He gave me back my tomorrow
He saved me

Oh, He saved me from my sorrow
He gave me back my tomorrow
He saved me

Save me from my sorrow
Love me like there's no tomorrow
Save me, save me

Save me
Save me
Save me
