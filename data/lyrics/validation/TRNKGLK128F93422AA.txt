How far is heaven? Let's go tonight
I want my daddy to hold me tight

A little girl was waiting for her daddy one day
It was time to meet him, when she heard her mommy say
Come to mommy darling, please do not cry
Daddy's gone to heaven, way up in the sky

How far is heaven? When can I go?
To see my daddy, he's there I know
How far is heaven? Let's go tonight
I want my daddy to hold me tight

He was called so suddenly, and could not say goodbye
I know that he's in heaven, we'll meet him by and by
The little girl trembled, her tears she could not hide
She looked up for heaven and then she replied

How far is heaven? When can I go?
To see my daddy, he's there I know
How far is heaven? Let's go tonight
I want my daddy to hold me tight
