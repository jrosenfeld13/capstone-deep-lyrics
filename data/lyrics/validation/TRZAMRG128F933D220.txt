The sunset was gonna be quite a sight, yeah, were gonna watch it together tonight now
I'm sorry babe, I couldn't be there, watch the wind blow through your hair
But I, thought of us, every mile I drove, watching the sun roll away from the coast
And, here out here, the sky is burning up, as if being apart wasn't hard enough

There, every door I open, another one shuts on me...
Here, just a fish in the ocean, and you're, too good for me...

Well I, I can't say that I've always been there, but always wanted to honey I've always cared
Every path you take, you know I'll follow, there's another sunset tomorrow

There, every door I open, another one shuts on me...
Here, just a fish in the ocean, and you're, too good for me...

Strange running from, Friday nights and
Funny we'll have to, know thats right
So easy to be, left behind always
Livin in a fairy tale oh...
A fairy tale oh...

The sunset was gonna be quite a sight, yeah, were gonna watch it together tonight now
I'm sorry babe, I couldn't be there, running my fingers through your hair

There, every door I open, another one shuts on me...
Here, just a fish in the ocean, and you're, too good for me...
