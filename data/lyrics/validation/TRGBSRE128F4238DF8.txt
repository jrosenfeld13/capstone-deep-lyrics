Psychotic tendencies have put me here for life
Dreams of smashing little things before they ruin my life
Find means capable of smothering a flea
Extermination is their end, escaping not from me

Chorus:
Retaliate
Decapitate--I love to see them bleed
Annihilate
I am human insecticide

Creepy black mass, I see one down below
Prepare to strike, act quickly now, strike the fatal blow
Extinguishing the menace, they will know my name
Destroying these, the lives of waste, delivered now to pain

Repeat Chorus

Bridge:
Asphyxiate the flame of life
From hatred they will die
Power kept in my control
Their souls are caged with mine

Expelled from life, they cannot hide, I will find them out
Their game's lost, I hunt them down, their end without a doubt
Psychotic tendencies, my dreams are coming true
My plans are set without repent, I'm tightening the screw

Repeat Chorus
