[Verse 1]
I can feel, I can tell
I can feel, I can tell, I can see
Something is changing
To me change is no stranger

I don't run, I don't hide
I don't run, I don't hide, I don't fight
What fate arranges
I don't think about danger

[Pre-Chorus 1]
If it was meant for me
I'd know just when to go
But if I can take it slow
Then I might be in control

[Verse 2]
In the back of my head
In the back of my head there is doubt
There is suspicion
With my new fascination

I don't know what it is
I don't know what it is
You might say it's intuition
It's a true indication

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I should trust myself
I should beware of this
But it's like a stranger's kiss
And somehow I can't resist

[Chorus]
I can feel, I can feel my will slip away
From a strange influenza
I can feel, I can feel my mind slip away
Under your influenza
I can feel, I can feel my heart slip away
Under your influenza

[Verse 3]
There's a part of my heart
There's a part of my heart that cries out
Please go no further
I just can't take the pressure

So I try to resist
So I try to resist and my heart
Tells me don't bother
That this pain is a pleasure

[Pre-Chorus 3]
If I were someone else
I wouldn't disagree
But it's always hard to see
When something's controlling me

[Chorus]
I can feel, I can feel my will slip away
From a strange influenza
I can feel, I can feel my mind slip away
Under your influenza
I can feel, I can feel my heart slip away
Under your influenza

[Outro]
I can feel, I can feel my will slip away
Under your influenza
I can feel, I can feel my mind slip away
Under your influenza
I can feel, I can feel my heart slip away
Under your influenza...
