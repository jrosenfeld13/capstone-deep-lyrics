Hurry on home, all the love is gone
Hurry on home for me
This village has a voice, its ringing through my ears
Hurry on home for me
Too many faces I almost defeated
I never fell this far
But now that I see through the thin air in here, I see
That you just dont care
Im just the talk of the town
Famous for fooling around
But honey dont corner me in
Till I can reign in here
Cause I'm just the talk of the town
The obvious place for stealing your beautiful crown
So hurry on home, all the love is gone
Hurry on home for me
This headache got my heart, its pounding like a drum
Come drum it out of me
Cause now that I see through the thick empty air, I see
That you just dont care
Im just the talk of the town
Famous for fooling around
But honey dont corner me in
Till I can reign in here
Cause I'm just the talk of the town
The obvious place for stealing your beautiful crown
Stealing your beautiful crown
But I might not; this battle must begin
So does I, does anyone know
That I'm feeling like poor leaves on seas
My keys are clean
Im just the talk of the town
Famous for fooling around
But honey dont corner me in
Till I can reign in here
Cause I'm just the talk of the town
The obvious place for stealing your beautiful crown
