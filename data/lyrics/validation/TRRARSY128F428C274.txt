(Young, Young, Johnson)

Party's gonna happen at the union hall
Shaking to the rhythm 'til everybody fall
Picking up my woman in my Chevrolet
Glory hallelujah gonna rock the night away

I'm gonna roll roll roll
I'm gonna roll roll roll
I'm gonna take this town, turn it around
I'm gonna roll roll roll

Now there's a blue suede bopping on a high heeled shoe
Balling round together like a wrecking crew
Oh be bopper lubba baby what I say
You gotta get a dose of rock and roll on each and every day

We're gonna roll roll roll
We're gonna roll roll roll
We're gonna take this town, turn it around
We're gonna roll roll roll

I'm gonna blow up my video
Shut down my radio
Told boss man where to go
Turned off my brain control
That's the way I want my rock and roll
That's the way I want my rock and roll

That's the way
Ooh that's the way I like my rock and roll
That the way I want my rock and roll

That's the way
That's the way
That's the way I want my rock and roll
That's the way
That's the way
That's the way I want my rock and roll
That's the way
That's the way
Oh!
To rock and roll!
Roll, roll, roll
I'm gonna roll, roll, roll
I'm gonna take this town, turn it around
I'm gonna roll, roll, roll

I'm gonna roll, roll, roll
That's the way I want it
Roll, roll, roll
Gotta hear it loud
Gonna take this town, turn it 'round
Gonna roll, roll, roll

Blow up my video
Shut down my radio
Told boss man where to go
Turned off my brain control
That's the way I want my rock and roll
That's the way I want my rock and roll

That's the way I want my rock and roll
