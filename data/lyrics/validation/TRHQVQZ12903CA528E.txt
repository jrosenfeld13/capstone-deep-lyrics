[Verse 1]
What you got if you ain't got love
The kind that you just wanna give away
It's okay to open up
Go ahead and let the light shine through
I know it's hard on a rainy day
You wanna shut the world out and just be left alone
But don't run out on your faith

[Chorus]
'Cause sometimes that mountain you've been climbing is just a grain of sand
And what you've been up there searching for forever is in your hands
When you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else seem so small

[Verse 2]
It's so easy to get lost inside
A problem that seems so big at the time
It's like a river that's so wide
It swallows you whole
While you're sitting 'round thinking 'bout what you can't change
And worrying about all the wrong things
Time's flying by
Moving so fast
You better make it count 'cause you can't get it back

[Chorus]
Sometimes that mountain you've been climbing is just a grain of sand
And what you've been up there searching for forever is in your hands
Oh, and when you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else
Seem so small
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Sometimes that mountain you've been climbing is just a grain of sand
And what you've been up there searching for forever is in your hands
And when you figure out love is all that matters after all
It sure makes everything else
Oh, it sure makes everything else
Seem so small

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
