Oh, that wasn't me that was the caffeine talking
You should go to bed because tomorrow your working but if you want to smoke all night, I don't mind
Oh, I met a girl who took me to her favourite bar
We went back to hers and then we went too far, but I like going too far just sometimes
My clothes don't fit me, paracetomol and whiskey
Make me fall to my knees
The rivers here are wider the roads here are wider
And when I'm here beside her I'm not sure I want to leave
They sell coffee all night here
They sell breakfast all night here
They sell honey roasted cigarettes but still I think of home
Oh the dope is stronger here
I won't see these friends for years
I have a sweetheart at home in tears so I must go home
Mercy, didn't think I'd ever ride a bike that fast
Didn't think I'd ever see a truly independent self-sufficient sub-culture
