Been busted in Texas
Seen my share of Colorado rain
I've seen the anxiety every high school kid feels
Growing up on the Kansas plain
I've looked to the East coast
Still idling in rush hour hell
And the west coast keeps dreaming things are tough all over
But for me it's just as well

She isn't mine
She isn't mine
She isn't mine
She isn't mine

I promised myself I was done, and I could walk away
But now I am just on the run and with nowhere to stay
I think of her often and dream of how different I'd be
Because it can hurt so much that I panic in the pain
So changeless I want to change me

'Cause she isn't mine
She isn't mine
She isn't mine
She isn't mine

Every mention of you
Yeah, it splits me in two
'Cause it feels so good
But I promised I would
Keep it easy and fun
But when you're on the run
You scavenge to live
And what I just wouldn't give
I tell myself forget her
That it's only for the better
But I can't help devise
Some added surprise
To keep her in contact
To feel her react to me
Feel her attract to me
But it's so abstract to me

She isn't mine
She isn't mine
She isn't mine
She isn't mine
Isn't mine
