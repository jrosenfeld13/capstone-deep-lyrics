Take another sip my love and see what you will see
A fleet of golden galleons, on a crystal sea
Are you sitting comfortably?
Let Merlin cast his spell

Ride along the winds of time and see where we have been
The glorious age of Camelot, when Guinevere was Queen
It all unfolds before your eyes
As Merlin casts his spell

The seven wonders of the world he'll lay before your feet
In far-off lands, on distant shores, so many friends to meet
Are you sitting comfortably?
Let Merlin cast his spell
