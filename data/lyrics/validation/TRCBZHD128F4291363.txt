I hear a whistle, I hear a moan
Must be my baby coming home
She's been down in Tupelo
Singing that river boat song
She is a dancer, a river queen
She'll teach them gamblers most anything
She's been down in Tupelo
Singing that river boat song
Many nights I spend alone
Many days there ain't nobody home
Many times I wish she was here
Yeah, that river boat whistle blow
I know she's getting near
River captain, bring my baby home
I get so lonesome since she's been gone
She's been down in Tupelo
Singing that river boat song
Many nights I spend alone
Many days there ain't nobody home
Many times I wish she was here
Yeah, that river boat whistle blow
I know she's getting near
River captain, bring my baby home
I get so lonesome since she's been gone
She's been down in Tupelo
Singing that river boat song
