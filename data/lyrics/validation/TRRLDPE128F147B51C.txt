What if the stars forgot to shine
What if they all just kind of fell asleep
Reading people magazine

What if your god wasn't there
What if you tear down the screen and there's nothing behind it
Where's your faith, how will you find it

What if your love let you down
What if she let you drown in your sorrow
Would you let her back in tomorrow
Would you let her back in tomorrow
