Hey hey take it away!

[Verse 1 - Josh Martinez]
Didn't know better go get debt is old
But I gotta get ahead before i'm old (before I'm old)
I been a dope fiend, sold dope so mean
So close to the edge of hope (oh no)
Everybody loves a comeback some acts
Hit the crapper and they never come back (a-cha-cha)
But chicha-ro-nies are like pizza parties
And you know that we never come wack (yeah yeah)
Yeah yeah

[Chorus]
The spotlights on its on again
It goes on, put on my threads and get prepared to rip (E I O)
The Chicharones are the shit (U A)
So if you don't know then now you know
There's a place I know where people go just to get their fix (E I O)
Where the Chichs are the shit (U A Y)
Chichs are the shit

[Bridge]
Whatcha got, whatcha got, whatcha got, whatcha got
Whatcha got, whatcha got I got to get it now

I'm a good man, bad boy, automated rap deploy-er
Part time employer, headliner, show opener
Brainstorm weather vein, eardrum medicine
Catch the feeling while you can, let me take you away!
Hey hey take it away

[Verse 2 - Sleep]
I'm just an old man, dated rapper, accidental baby daddy, day dreamer to this day (hey hey hey)
I'm a nice guy, heart breaker, part time hard worker, but my work's more like play (hey hey hey)
I've been around the world, round the block, ran around round the clock found a girl around the way (hey hey)
I'm a go-getter goldmine, show setter punchline specialist when I when I when I take it away

[Bridge]
Life is just a party, you can go meet anybody
Don't ever let nobody stop you
From reaching the top and grabbing the spotlight
Hey hey take it away!

[Bridge]
Whatcha got, whatcha got, whatcha got, whatcha got
Whatcha got, whatcha got I got to get it now

I'm a good man bad man shoot em up with a bad man
Can you feel the heat? Lick a shot with a cap gun
Been a skuzzbucket, hug a buzz, sluggin it back
Punchbuggy! no punch back!

[Verse 5 - Josh Martinez]
Middle class moms, caught me doing drugs
Making out with their daughters on the couch in the rec room
We would watch a movie, sipping on a mickey
She would touch my dickey, jeans I mean
And then things would get sticky, whats a little hickey?
Between friends it depends on when and who ends it
Get back to bumping on the back of the breeze
And pull back the brrrrap so you can actually eat

[Chorus]
The spotlights on its on again
It goes on, put on my threads and get prepared to rip (E I O)
The Chicharones are the shit (U A)
So if you don't know then now you know
There's a place I know where people go just to get their fix (E I O)
Where the Chichs are the shit (U A Y)
Chichs are the shit

[Verse 6 - Sleep]
Now the beats off, the beats hard
We keep the party jumping with speech erupting
We bring peace and loving
To each one of you what would you have me do nothing
We summon the power to crush a rap and tackling subjects
It had to go up
Eventually it will be me winning in this mental arena
Sleep, the missing link to what you need between the claps
Relax cause the Chicharones are back!


Life is just a party, you can go meet anybody
Don't ever let nobody stop you
From reaching the top and grabbing the spotlight
Hey hey take it away!
