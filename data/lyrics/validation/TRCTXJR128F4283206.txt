There's a parking lot where the corner cafe stood
One of the places we first fell in love
They've built a waterslide on the bluff by the riverside
Where we first fumbled our way into love
And you hardly ever hear it it's a golden oldie now
But you and I danced to it at least a thousand miles
We ran with Bobby and his wife her name I can't recall
We had lots of fun and love hardly anything else at all
The things we knew are turning brown and gray with age or gone
It's funny how the years slip by I can't help but wonder why
Sometimes it doesn't seem that long
After all these years after all the joys and tears
After all is said and done after most of everything we knew is gone
I still love you

After all these years...
After all
