Rally up my friends
And stand by my bedside
If I die tonight
Put my head inside a mason jar
Put it in the ocean
And send it out to sea
I'm wading because...

And when I hit some shore
And when my seal is broke
I'll split my eyes and lips asking
"Is this a judgment or a joke?"

This is a chance to dissect it
This is a chance to make it up
These are the words we've selected

Don't believe my lies
Of an afterlife spent drifting
After forty hours
I sank straight to the bottom
Of the harbor near my home
And there I lay alone
The spider crab is finely clad
Beneath my cloak of brain and bone

This is a chance to make it up
This is a chance to dissect it
This is a chance to break it up
These are the notes we've selected

In the basement of the dress shop
They play poker on the weekends
Old men trading laces
It's an absolute disgrace
They never gave a tip
To the boy who ran the route
They never gave a shit
What the paper was about
But when they heard he died
They read the news that day
Just so they could see
What his obituary would say
It said:
"Rally up my friends
And stand by my bedside!
Rally up my friends
And stay with me tonight!"
