You can rape the world and be creative now
You can kiss the right side of your brain
Oh, they can tell the tarot for the rest of us
And I can crown me Tarzan, king of Mars
Oh, they can tell the tarot for the rest of us
And I can crown me Tarzan, king of Mars

All the blazing suns
Suck up all the gods and punks
It's enough to change your life
And you know I love to come
I can see beyond your dreams
I can see on TV
Keep it all for me babe, all forever

You can rape the world and be creative now
You can kiss the right side of your brain
Oh, they can tell the tarot for the rest of us
And I can crown me Tarzan, king of Mars
Oh, they can tell the tarot for the rest of us
And I can crown me Tarzan, king of Mars

You can rape the world and be creative now
You can kiss the right side of your brain
Oh, they can tell the tarot for the rest of us
And I can crown me Tarzan, king of Mars
Oh, they can tell the tarot for the rest of us
And I can crown me Tarzan, king of Mars

Yeah...
