Don't leave me baby cos I want ya by my own
Don't leave me baby cos I want ya for my own
If you do little baby you know I'm all alone

In the evening mama when the sun begins to set
Yeah baby, the sun begin to set
I miss you darlin', you know I can't forget

Well I feel so blue, believe I've hit that lonesome road
Yeah baby, believe I've hit that lonesome road
My baby gone left me, she won't be back no more

Don't leave me baby, if you do you'll break my heart
Don't leave me baby, if you do you'll break my heart
You know I love you and we must never part

Tell me baby what in the world is wrong with you
Yeah darlin', what in the world is wrong with you
You know I love you, baby I can't stand being away from you
