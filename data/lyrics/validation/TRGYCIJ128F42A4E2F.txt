There's no place that you can go
Run as fast as you want, it will be too slow
I'm going out of my head, it's driving me insane
I can have no peace until I see you in pain

You slipped out the back when things got hot
You took everything and left me to rot
But your plan didn't work, it didn't come close
When I get through with you, you're gonna look gross

I'll show you no mercy when I catch up to you
No mercy when I torture you
No mercy, there's no place to run
You'll wish you were dead before I'm done

You'll be bleeding profusely
And we don't use tha term loosely
Cuz . . 

You slipped out the back when things got hot
You took everything and left me to rot
But your plan didn't work, it didn't come close
When I get through with you, you're gonna look gross
