The Moffatts
Now and Forever
Chapeter 1 A New Beginning Asian Version 1998

U-ohh-U-ohh-ho-ho (2x)

What would I do If you took your love away from me
What would I say I could never make it without you
Yes it's true I wanna be with only you

Now and forever
You and me together I can't believe it's true I'm so in love with you
Now and forever
You and me together
I wanna be with you now and forever
U-ohh-U-ohh-ho-ho (2x)

And ever being with you
Feels like the sun on a Saturday
Every night I find myself dreaming of just you
Yes it's true I wanna be with only you
