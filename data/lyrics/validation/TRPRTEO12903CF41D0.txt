I worship thee, I want to feel your power flow through me
Hear my plead, come and rescue me
Set my spirit free, allow me to see
Grant me the key to eternity

Do I matter? I ask myself
How come no one remembers my name?
I who served the light
Who fell in love with the night

(Chorus)
Free me from my shackles
Pierce through my soul's disguise
Grace me with the knowledge to see through the lies
Make me one with you now and eternally
Breathe through me for the world to see

Like sunshine after rain
Lift me up, exalt me, release me from pain
Remove damnation's stain
That torments me and marks me as Cain

(Chorus)
Free me from my shackles
Pierce through my soul's disguise
Grace me with the knowledge to see through the lies
Make me one with you now and eternally
Breathe through me for the world to see
