The Wind Blows Through
My Open Door
Where Love And Life Has Gone Before
My Wish For Peace Came True
I'm Left With Nothing Left To Do
But Sit And Stare At Days Gone By
No Tears Left To Cry
No Nountains Left To Climb
Everybody's Got To Feel This Way Sometime
Everybody's got To Feel There's No Escaping What Is Real
Feel Good, Feel Good, Feel Good
Hearts Can Be Broken
Pain Can't Be Spoken
I Can't Stand To SeeYou Crying
If Truth It's Bettter Lying
I'm Hungy For Your Love And Laughter
Shining Through For Ever After
No Tears Left To Cry
No Nountains Left To Climb
Everybody's Got To Feel This Way Sometime
Everybody's got To Feel There's No Escaping What Is Real
Feel Good, Feel Good, Feel Good
They Say Ever Cloud
Has A Silver Lining
But When It's Rained Away
The Golden Sun Is Always Shining
Summer Comes And Goes
Cold Hearts And Winter Snows
Kill This Winter Of The Heart
Return To Spring Let Summer Start
No Tears Left To Cry
No Nountains Left To Climb
Everybody's Got To Feel This Way Sometime
Everybody's got To Feel There's No Escaping What Is Real
Feel Good, Feel Good, Feel Good
