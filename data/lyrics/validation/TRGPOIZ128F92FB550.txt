There's a girl on my mind I can't get over
That would break the heart of any man
Without her, things would fall to pieces
I'm dreamin' about my Mary Ann

So I'll just keep touching up my gray hair
Live and hope someday she'll understand
It's no matter if I live to be a hundred
There'll always be a place in my heart for Mary Ann

I know she's out there somewhere in a world that can't be found
Just to think of her still tears me down
If teardrops were pennies then I'd be a wealthy man
From the tears that I've cried for Mary Ann
