You make me feel
So alive that I'm
Tryin' hard not to make moves
Choosin' the wrong place and time
Everyone will know
The minute we let it go, yeah
I can't hold it anymore
Let's be original

No holds barred
Can you feel it?
Comin' along
Break the silence
Non-directional
No holds barred
Can you feel it?
Comin' along
It's on
Hit the switch and turn me on

You make me feel complicated
Sometimes I try to explain the way you took me
Turned it all around
Everyone will know the minute we let it go
I can't hold it anymore
Let's be original

No holds barred
Can you feel it?
Comin' along
Break the silence
Non-directional
No holds barred
Can you feel it?
Comin' along
It's on
Hit the switch and turn me on

No holds barred
Can you feel it?
Comin' along
Break the silence
Non-directional
No holds barred
Can you feel it?
Comin' along
It's on
Hit the switch and turn me on

'cause I'm crawling my way through
Im falling into you
I'm turning on things I thought I knew
I'm slipping away every time I try to be more like you

No holds barred
Can you feel it?
Comin' along
Break the silence
Non-directional
No holds barred
Can you feel it?
Comin' along
It's on
Hit the switch and turn me on

No holds barred
Can you feel it?
Comin' along
Break the silence
Non-directional
No holds barred
Can you feel it?
Comin' along
It's on
Hit the switch and turn me on

Let's get it on me, on me, on me, on
If ya feel it comin' on me, on me, on
If you're real then come along, along, along
If you feel the song
Come on
Bring it on, bring it on

Get it on me, on me, on me, on
If ya feel it comin' on me, on me, on
If you're real then come along, along, along
If you feel the song
Come on
Bring it on, bring it on

Get it on me, on me, on me, on
If ya feel it comin' on me, on me, on
If you're real then come along, along, along
If you feel the song
Come on
Bring it on, bring it on

Get it on me, on me, on me, on
If ya feel it comin' on me, on me, on
If you're real then come along, along, along
If you feel the song
Come on
Bring it on, bring it on
