I'm going down to Lebanon, Tennessee
From where I stand it's as good a place as any
I don't know anybody there
And nobody knows me

There'll be a job in Lebanon, Tennessee
I'll work on a farm, I'll work in some factory
And I'll buy myself a home down there
You can get one pretty cheap

Get off the bus on the border of town
Head in from the east
Walk into a bar take a seat in the corner
Be a man of mystery

Folks don't treat you mean in Lebanon, Tennessee
But like a human being, they'll take you in off the street
They'll bring you in their home down there
And give you something to eat
