[Repeat: x2]
Know your enemy

Its inside of you
Inside of me
Know your enemy...

The clock is ticking like a time bomb in the mind
Of the people who's rebel hearts cry out to break
The ties that bind desperate times to the human
Spirit in us all watch it fall light the fuse let it begin!

[Chorus]
We are the people
We are the time bomb picket line
Revolution, A revolution forged and redefined
With our minds with our hearts not shackled hands

Born to care not to kill
To help our fellow man and so we stand
Hand in hand and in solidarity
To know the truth, Know yourself, and know...
Know your enemy

And we're like fuses like candles burning at both ends
In the darkness in this madness lies another means to an end
But I contend that the human spirit in us all
Will stand tall... light the fuse let it begin!

[Chorus]
So take these words tear them down they don't mean anything
If we don't act on our ideas than they're just words we sing
Fuck your rhetoric of reason your banner and your plea
'Til you know the truth, know yourself, and know...
Know your enemy
