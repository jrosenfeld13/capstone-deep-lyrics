What am I supposed to
What am I to do
Looking down I see theres something new

Hear the screams inside me
I give them all to you
In this pouring rain my words speak true

Bring me some salvation
Holy waters heal
My bodies destination
A story to reveal

I feel a new sensation
What's my crime to make you kill
I didn't hurt anybody
I can't make sense of what is real
What kind of god would test me
Turn his face and watch me die!

Wherever in my kingdom
Wherever angels sing
Think of me and let the voices ring
You will share my body
Drinking from my cup
All I ever gave is what you got

Bring me some salvation
Holy waters heal
My bodies destination
A story to reveal

I feel a new sensation
What's my crime to make you kill
I didn't hurt anybody
I can't make sense of what is real
What kind of god would test me
Turn his face and watch me die!

I'll survive
On the cross of crosses
It's so surreal another time to die
I'll survive
On the cross of crosses
A new born child will dare
Where angels fear to fly
