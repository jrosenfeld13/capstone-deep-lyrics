[Intro]
Silent night holy night

[Verse 1]
Silent night holy night all is calm all is bright
Around young virgin mother and child holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace sleep in heavenly peace

[Chorus]
Silent night holy night all is dark save the light
See the eastern wise men bring gifts and homage to our King
Christ the Saviour is born Jesus the Saviour is born

[Verse 2]
Silent night (holy night) all is calm all is bright
Poorest dreams from heaven afar heavenly host sing hallelujah
Christ the Savious is born Jesus the Saviour is born

[Chorus]
Silent night holy night wonderous dark lend Thy light
With the angels let us sing hallelujah hail the King
Christ the Saviour is born Jesus the Saviour is born
