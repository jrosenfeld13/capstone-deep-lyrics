Newman

I may go out tomorrow if I can borrow a coat to wear
Oh, Id step out in style with my sincere smile and my dancing bear
Outrageous, alarming, courageous, charming
Oh, who would think a boy and bear
Could be well accepted everywhere
Its just amazing how fair people can be

Seen at the nicest places where well-fed faces all stop to stare
Making the grandest entrance is simon smith and his dancing bear
Theyll love us, wont they?
They feed us, dont they?
Oh, who would think a boy and bear
Could be well accepted everywhere
Its just amazing how fair people can be

Who needs money when youre funny?
The big attraction everywhere
Will be simon smith and his dancing bear
Its simon smith and the amazing dancing bear
