Sometimes we laugh like children
Go running hand in hand
I never felt like this before
I never will again
Sometimes we cry like babies
I hold you to my heart
I just can't stand to see you sad
It tears me all apart

And we're so afraid and it's such a shame
There is no reason we should doubt it
And the things we want to say we've never said
And we look away and it's all okay and
Never really talk about it
It's a shame the way we dance along the edge
Dance along the edge (x2)

We always seem so careful
We're always so unsure
Past mistakes they make us shaky
Eyes on the door
When do we stop searching
For what we're searching for?
Then when it comes
We question love and try for more

And we're happy here, but we live in fear
We've seen a lot of temples crumble
Some of flesh and blood and love is under glass
Will we come undone? Will we turn and run?
And will we know it when we find it?
It's a game the way we dance along the edge
Dance along the edge (x2)

And we'll walk the line and we'll do our time
For just as long as we've been given
And pretend like we don't hear the things they've said
Can we promise love? Is it all too much
And do our old souls still believe it?
It's insane the way we dance along the edge
Dance along the edge (x2)

Dance along the edge (x2, half-faded)

Dance along the edge (x6, harmonies)
