Beyond your instructions - explosions in my eyes
Strange output connection - too blind to realize
Could loose from fear - keeps my commission
In round to hear to faith's transmission
Beyond your instructions - explosions in my eyes
Strange output connection - too blind to realize
String of ice - too blind to realize - the string of ice
Magic wheel in memory - backward in space
Iron to gold, mystery from place to place
Too blind to realize - the string of ice
