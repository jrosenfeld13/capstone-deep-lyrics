When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothin', nothin' is goin' right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come runnin' to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you've got to do is call
And I'll be there, yes I will
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
Should turn dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind
Should begin to blow
Keep your head together
And call my name out loud
Soon I'll be knockin' upon your door

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come runnin' to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you've got to do is call
And I'll be there

Hey, ain't it good to know
You've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, desert you
They'll take your soul if you let them
So, don't you let them

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come runnin' to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you've got to do is call
And I'll be there, yes I will
You've got a friend

You've got a friend...
