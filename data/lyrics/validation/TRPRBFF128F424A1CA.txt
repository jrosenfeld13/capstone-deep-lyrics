So many rivers I've got to cross
There is so many rivers still left to cross
And I've got to get over ,- some way, somehow
I've got to get over

Jordan River's gonna roll
Roll River Jordan roll
Meet me at the bank of the beautiful river
Meet me at the bank of the beautiful river

There will be trial and tribulation along the way
And I'm makin' way for a better day
Now we know the right from wrong
And we know just where we stand

Now we know who we are and what we're for
Dont want to get mixed up into dem tribal war
Some got to rise ,- some got to fall

So many rivers I've got to cross
There is so many rivers still left to cross
And I've got to get over
And I've got to get over

So many rivers I've got to cross
There is so many rivers still left to cross
It's such a navigable water
And I've got to get over

Jordan River's gonna roll
Roll River Jordan roll
In this a fountain that flow so deep and wide
There can be no sorrow, can't wait for tomorrow

Jordan River's gonna roll
Roll River Jordan roll....
