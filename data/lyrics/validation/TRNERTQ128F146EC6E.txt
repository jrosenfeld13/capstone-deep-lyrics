[Verse 1]
Oh girl I don't know all the reasons why
I found the answer lookin' in your eye
I go out walking all day long
Take away this lonely man soon he will be gone

[Chorus]
'Cause I'll tell you everything about living free
Yes I can see you girl can you see me

[Verse 2]
You don't need to know what I do all day
It's as much as I know watch it waste away

[Chorus]
'Cause I'll tell you everything about living free
Yes I can see you girl can you see me

[Verse 3]
Go and see the sorcerer look into the ball
You may find the answer written on the wall
The left one was a dancer can you see the answer, oh!

[Verse 4]
Put her in a mansion on top of the hill
Please don't make her do things against her will
I found something special I don't know why
Looking into her pretty little eye

[Chorus]
'Cause I'll tell you everything about living free
Yes I can see you girl can you see me
