Reuben James, in my song you live again
And the phrases that I rhyme are just a footstep out of time
From the time when I knew you, Reuben James

Reuben James, all the folks around Hadison County
Cussed your name
You're just a no-count, sharecropping colored man
You'd steal anything you can
And everybody laid the blame on Reuben James

Reuben James, for you still walk over fields of my mind
Faded shirt, weathered brow, caloused hands upon the plow
Loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James

For a grave, the gossiper of Hadison County died with chid
Although your skin was black
You were the one that didn't turn your back
On the hungry white child with no name, Reuben James

Reuben James, with your mind on the soul
And a bottle in your right hand
You said turn the other cheek
For there's a better world awaiting for the meek
In my mind, these words remain from Reuben James

Reuben James, for you still walk over fields of my mind
Faded shirt, weathered brow, caloused hands upon the plow
Loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James

Reuben James, one dark cloudy day
They brought you from the field
And to your lonely pine box
Came just a preacher, me and the rain
Just to sing one last refrain to Reuben James

Reuben James, for you still walk over fields of my mind
Faded shirt, weathered brow, caloused hands upon the plow
Loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James

Reuben James, for you still walk over fields of my mind
Faded shirt, weathered brow, caloused hands upon the plow
Loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James
