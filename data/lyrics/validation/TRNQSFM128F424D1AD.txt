You need a break
And you need some inspiration
You need a place where you can be free
All your friends are gone
But you still got temptation
Won't you come along with me
Your dreams are all broken
And nothing seems right
Raise up your fists and scream it tonight
I gave you hope and
Some real satisfaction
You wear a smile
And you go: Hey! Hey! Hey!
I can tell you want a piece of the action
One word and we are on our way
Hate this town
And everything that just ain't true
Hate this town
And everything it's done to you
Hate this town
And everything it wanna be
Hate this town
And all the shit it's done to me
I take you with me to a
Brand new destination
Where no one tells you what to do
Close your eyes and leave
This institution
Tonight we know we'll make it through
I hate this town
We hate this town
