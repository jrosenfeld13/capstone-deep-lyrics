The Savior is waiting to enter your heart
Why don't you let Him in?
Why don't you let Him in?
There's nothing in this world to keep you apart
Why don't you answer Him?
Why don't you answer Him?

[Chorus:]
Time after time
He has waited before
And now He is waiting again
To see if you are willing
To open the door
Oh, how He wants to come in
If you'll take one look
At the Savior, my friend
You'll find His arms open wide
You'll find His arms open wide
Receive Him, and all of your darkness will end
Within your heart He'll abide
Within your heart He'll abide

[Chorus x2]
Don't turn Him away
Don't turn Him away
No, no, no, no
Don't turn Him away
Don't turn Him away
How He wants to come in
Into your heart
Into your heart
If you're willing
