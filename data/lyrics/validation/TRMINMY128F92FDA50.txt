[Verse 1]
Under the white light of the cafeteria
She hands the beef lasagna to the second grader
Who spits onto the beef lasagna
Behind the counter, she begins to wonder
"When did my dreams die? Where did my life go?"

[Chorus]
But Ms. Dolores (ahhhh)
If you were gone (ahhhh)
Who would feed the children? (ahhhh)
How would they get nourishment? (ahhhh)
Oh Ms. Dolores
Recognize the importance of your role
Oh Ms. Dolores
Go and wipe that frown from under your mole

[Verse 2]
One lunchtime, the kids are in line
Expecting to dine
But there's an issue inside the kitchen
Tiny bodies were collapsing out of starvation
'Cause Dolores is missing in action

[Bridge]
She's at home on Cherry Street
A-weeping softly under her sheets
Thinking I could've been an actress
Or I could've been a stewardess
I coulda been a million things
Besides a school lunch lady
Serving children that don't think to thank me

[Chorus]
But Ms. Dolores (ahhhh)
When you were gone (ahhhh)
No one fed the children (ahhhh)
No one got nourishment (ahhhh)
Please Ms. Dolores
Recognize the importance of your role
Please Ms. Dolores
Go and wipe that frown from under your mole

[Outro]
Someday soon, she enters the lunchroom
And every elementary schooler
Runs to the door to greet her
Wrapping their limbs 'round Dolores
They tell her they missed her
They tell her they love the way she prepares sloppy joes
And now she knows
And now she knows
And now she knows
And now she knows
Ms. Dolores has recognized the importance of her role
Ms. Dolores is wearing a smile underneath her mole
