It'd be a lie to say that
I'm not gonna miss you
So please don't say goodbye now
Till I've kissed you one more time
And held you as I did when you were mine

It'd be a lie to say
I don't still love you
I won't be thinking of you, girl
I'll never try to call you one more time
Or try to find a way to change your mind

Ooh, you don't love me anymore
Oh, baby
You don't love me anymore
Baby, please forgive me
But the wine's gone to my head
And tomorrow
I'll remember how you turned to me and said

It'd be a lie to say that I still love you
That I'll be thinking of you, boy
I'll drive by to say hello sometime
Oh, but now you're gone
And all I have are five words on my mind

You don't love me anymore
Oh, baby
You don't love me anymore
Baby, please forgive me
But the wine's gone to my head
And tomorrow
I'll remember how you turned to me and said

Ooh, you don't love me anymore
Oh, baby
You don't love me anymore
I'll have to face it
You don't love me anymore
Oh, baby
You don't love me anymore
Honey, it hurts so bad

'Cause you don't love me anymore
Oh, baby
You don't love me anymore
Tears are falling
'Cause you don't love me anymore
Oh, baby
You don't love me anymore
