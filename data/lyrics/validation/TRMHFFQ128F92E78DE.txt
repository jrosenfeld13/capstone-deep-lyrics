Hey

Can't let him go
No, no
Hoo hoo ooh

I've had my heartaches and pain, ooh
For all the lovers playing games
I've even given up on love, ooh, ooh
The will to hurt became too much, listen to me

But I got tired of being alone, ooh
I had to find someone to call my own
And he don't cheat and he don't lie, no, no
And there's more than fire in his eyes and that's why

I just can't let him go (Go)
I guess I love him so (So)
'Cause I deny this heart of mine
That's why I won't let love go this time, ooh yeah

It's not easy livin'
Even when you find a special friend
It's hard to know what's love from lust, ooh, ooh
Your heart forgets just who to trust

Then he starts callin' you and botherin' you
And askin' you what you wanna do
Are you happy now, do you wanna settle down
Then you feel safe and sound and that's why

I just can't let him go, go (Can't let him go, no, no)
I guess I love him so (I love him, I love him so)
'Cause I deny (Oh, yes, I deny) this heart of mine
(Oh, yeah, yeah)
That's why I won't let love go this time

I just can't let him go (Whoa ho whoa )
I guess I love him so
(Woo hoo hoo .hoo woo )
'Cause I deny (Oh, yeah) this heart of mine (Listen)
That's why I won't let love go this time (This time
This time, baby)

That's why I won't let love go this time (This time)
I can't let him go, no, no, no
