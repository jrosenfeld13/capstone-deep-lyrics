Why can't you behave?
Why can't you be good?
You don't even try
To do the things you should
What is the reason?
I'd like to know
Why you can't be good

You go into the bedroom
You say you gotta powder your nose
But the powder is cocaine
I see traces on your clothes
What is the reason?
I'd like to know
Why you can't be good

Take another look inside your dreams tonight
When you go to sleep
Try and find the reasons why you've lost your way
Like some little sheep

You say that you love me
That that your heart is true
But you've got so many other loves
What am I s'posed to do?
What is the reason?
I'd like to know
Why you can't be good

Take another look inside your dreams tonight
When you go to sleep
Try and find the reasons why you've lost your way
Like some little sheep

Your face looks so pretty
But your mind is such a mess
You got a cold and wicked heart that's lurkin'
Underneath your breast
What is the reason?
I'd like to know
What is the reason?
I'd like to know
What is the reason?
I'd like to know
Why you can't be good

Why can't you be good?
Why can't you be good, baby?
You know you break my heart
