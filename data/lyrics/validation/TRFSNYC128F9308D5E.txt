Oh lai kai pehla pehla pyar
Bhar kai ankhon mai khumar
Jaadu nagri pai aaya
Hai koi jadugar
Oh...Oh... yeah, yeah
So yet another day
Another fight
You break down and cry
And you swear that it's over
It seems you've pack your bags like every night
Girl I know inside
We could be so much more
But everytime the smallest thing goes wrong girl
You're out the door
You don't wanna deal with this pain anymore
Why can't you understand that somethings
Won't come easy in life
Work with me girl
It'll just take some time so...
I'm not letting go
Yeah girl that's for sure
Won't catch me walking out
So ok let's work it out
I'm not letting go
Yeah girl that's for sure
Won't catch me walking out
So ok let's work it out
Oh lai kai pehla pehla pyar
Bhar kai ankhon mai khumar
Jaadu nagri pai aaya
Hai koi jadugar
At every single point you'll turn around
Say I've let you down
That I no longer know you
How could you say to me that I've lost my way
When you're walking away
And I'm willing to give my all...
But everytime the smallest thing goes wrong girl
You're out the door
You don't wanna deal with this pain anymore
Why can't you understand that somethings
Won't come easy in life
Work with me girl
It'll just take some time so...
I'm not letting go
Yeah girl that's for sure
Won't catch me walking out
So ok let's work it out
I'm not letting go
Yeah girl that's for sure
Won't catch me walking out
So ok let's work it out
I'm not letting go
Yeah girl that's for sure
Won't catch me walking out
So ok let's work it out
I'm not letting go
Yeah girl that's for sure
Won't catch me walking out
So ok let's work it out

[Jahaziel Verse]
Ones again here we go through that old procedure
You screaming its over between us but I don't believe ya
You such a diva, a drama queen
Girl why you blowing up like a Osama's been
What you want a argument well I ain't speaking
We come to far now and I ain't leaving
If we gotta problem let's get on top of it
We ain't gotta split we can conquer it
But we gotta quit over reacting
Imagine just last night we're romancing
First passion now we be clashing
I know what's happening you throw in a tantrum
As a man I'm making the first move
You know I never do nothing to blatantly hurt you
We got a situation to work through
But patients a virtue and baby it take two so
I'm not letting go
Yeah girl that's for sure
Won't catch me walking out
So ok let's work it out
I'm not letting go
Yeah girl that's for sure
Won't catch me walking out
So ok let's work it out
I'm not letting go
Yeah girl that's for sure
Won't catch me walking out
So ok let's work it out
I'm not letting go
Yeah girl that's for sure
Won't catch me walking out
So ok let's work it out
