Yeah, you're looking good
All the ropes that held you down
Unravel like mission district pigeons
And now your God's servant, yeah the one
With a holy knife on a holy throat
I love that leather head band
I Love the feathers, man. You're so handsome
I bet you can translate the sidewalk cracks
You can hear the wailing of the ghosts

All I know is I betrayed you
By not dragging hell to find you

And boom! your eyes are open
You're no one's dog, you can't be pet
You're packing weapons from the future
And pity is not one of them
Your flashing secret pirate maps
Abracadabra is in the air
You're the rainbow made of skulls
Made by fire, held by wire

All I know is I betrayed you
By not dragging hell to find you
But beautiful you're always there
Oh, beautiful you're like burning there

I know I'm bullshit because I like sleep
And I like social drinking
And I don't like going past the point of no return

All I know is I betrayed you
By not dragging hell to find you
But beautiful you're always there
But beautiful, you're always there
But beautiful, you're always there
Oh, beautiful, you're always there
But beautiful, you're always there
Oh, beautiful, you're always there
