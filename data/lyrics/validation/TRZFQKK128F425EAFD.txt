[Verse 1: Eric Bloom]
You can have my autograph
I think I'll sign it "love to you"
But should I sign it just for you?

[Chorus: Eric Bloom]
Stairway to the stars!
Think I'll write, "good health to you"
Stairway to the stars!
We got better things to do

[Verse 2: Eric Bloom]
You can drive my motorcar
It's insured to thirty thou
Kill them all if you wish

[Chorus: Eric Bloom]
Stairway to the stars!
Think I'll write, "good health to you"
Stairway to the stars!
We got better things to do

[Guitar Solo]
Mow em down now!

[Verse 3: Eric Bloom]
You can have my autograph
I think I'll sign it "good health to you"
Upon the cast your broken arm

[Chorus: Eric Bloom]
Stairway to the stars!
I think I'll write, "good health to you"
Stairway to the stars!
I hope you heal up real quick

[Outro: Eric Bloom]
Stairway to the stars! Stairway to the stars!
Stairway to the stars! Stairway to the stars!
Come on, let's get on outa here
