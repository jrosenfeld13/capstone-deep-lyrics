We came to dance, we came to walk
And as for those who can't
We came to talk
We came in leagues, we came with fees
She stated, on her knees, "we came to please"
But don't stop, we came back
We came relaxed, beat the flame inside
We came to last
We came vast, we came to smash
All the weight is coming
We came to last
We came in stead, we came and fled
With nothing left to lose, we came to mend
We came to mask, our need for lust
Like depth, in the driver's seat
We came to crush
