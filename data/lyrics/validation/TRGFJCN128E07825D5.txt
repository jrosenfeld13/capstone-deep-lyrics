Well, meet me by the river that goes nowhere
Let me lay my sorry trip on you
Won't you meet me by the river, little darling?
I might just let you see my bad tattoo

Well I was gonna bring you flowers, but I didn't
It's the thought that counts and I think I'm a bit too broke
But there's some change in my ashtray
Maybe just enough to pay
For a half pint of somethin' probably make us choke

Well, no I'd rather not go and meet your family
They'd probably send me back where I belong
Don't want to hear about your Mr. Right
Cause he's out of town tonight
Baby come and spend some time with Mr. Wrong

I drive a one-eyed Malibu without a muffler
And a tape deck that works if you kick it hard enough
Baby if you'd like to read, I got some great pornography
And a ten pound flashlight rolling in the trunk

Well, no I'd rather not go and meet your family
They'd probably send me back where I belong
Don't want to hear about your Mr. Right
Cause he's out of town tonight
Baby come and spend some time with Mr. Wrong

Now, do you have a girlfriend and does she look as good as you?
Hey, would she like to meet my brother?
He'll be out of jail in a month or two

Well, no I'd rather not go and meet your family
They'd probably send me back where I belong
Don't want to hear about your Mr. Right
Cause he's out of town tonight
Baby come and spend some time with Mr. Wrong
Where I come from they call me Mr. Wrong
