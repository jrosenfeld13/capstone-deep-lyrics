The island of dreams where people are born with a joyful's touch
The island of dreams where children look proud and full of heart
There's something about you I was always looking for
One thing I just know, day by day I love you more

The island of dreams where birds are singing so sweet in trees
The island of dreams, I hear a brook feel a gentle breeze
You are my home, I feel so good deep inside
Now I never knew this island is my only pride

The bright blue sea, so calm, oh! I feel so free
Long time ago, I met this island I love it so
You helped me survive, you truly catch me alive
What a lovely day, you will always stay this way

The island of dreams, the sweetest island with red sunset
The island of dreams, you're island I never will forget
There's something about you I was always looking for
One thing I just know, day by day I love you more

The island of dreams brings memories back of the peaceful days
The island of dreams, you showed me so many different ways
The rising morn, the palm trees, beach and sand
Nothing in this world can change this beautiful land

The island of dreams, where every body is in love with you
The island of dreams ...
