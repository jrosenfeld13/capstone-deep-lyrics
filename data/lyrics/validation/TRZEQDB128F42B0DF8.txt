[Verse 1]
You're like Voodoo baby
You just take hold
Put your cards on the table baby
Do I twist, do I fold?

You're like Voodoo honey
All silver and gold
Why don't you tell me my future?
Why don't I sell you my soul

[Bridge]
So here it comes, the sound of drums
Here comes the drums, here comes the drums

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby
You are my Voodoo Child, my Voodoo Child
Don't say maybe, maybe
It's supernatural, I'm coming undone
Baby, baby, baby
You are my Voodoo Child, my Voodoo Child
Don't say maybe, maybe
It's supernatural, I'm coming undone

[Verse 2]
You're like Voodoo baby
Your kisses are cold
Feel your poison running through me
Let me never grow old

You're like Voodoo honey
My pictures you stole
You play me like a puppet
Sticking pins in a doll!

[Bridge]
So here it comes, the sound of drums
Here comes the drums, here comes the drums

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby
You are my Voodoo Child, my Voodoo Child
Don't say maybe, maybe
It's supernatural, I'm coming undone
Baby, baby, baby
You are my Voodoo Child, my Voodoo Child
Don't say maybe, maybe
It's supernatural, I'm coming undone

[Instrumental Middle 8]

[Bridge]
Here comes the drums, here comes the drums

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby
You are my Voodoo Child, my Voodoo Child
Don't say maybe, maybe
It's supernatural, I'm coming undone
Baby, baby, baby
You just take hold
Don't say maybe, maybe
Do I twist, do I fold?
