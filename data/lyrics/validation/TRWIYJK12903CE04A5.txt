I had a warning, been taking stock
Woke up in the morning, woke up with a shock
I had been dreaming of a better place
Where I got along with the human race

Have a little faith in people and don't start another war
I don't want to be that kind of person anymore
Have a little faith in humankind and the future's looking bright
Time to smile and reconcile and you will be alright
You have a place to sit with a roof above and somebody loves you

I had a brainwave we could get along
I had a close shave, I was wrong
Made some phone calls to some old friends
And buried the hatchet and made amends

Have a little faith in people and don't start another war
I don't want to be that kind of person anymore
Have a little faith in humankind and the future's looking bright
Time to smile and reconcile and you will be alright
You have a place to sit with a roof above and somebody loves you
