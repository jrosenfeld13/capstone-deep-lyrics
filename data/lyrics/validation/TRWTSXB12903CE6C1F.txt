Hit the road Jack
And don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more
What you say?
Hit the road Jack
And don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack
And don't you come back no more
What you say?

Woah Woman, oh woman, don't treat me so mean
You're the meanest old woman that I've ever seen
I guess if you said so
I'd have to pack my bags and go

Hit the road Jack
And don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more
What you say?

Now baby, listen baby, don't ya treat me this-a way
Cause I'll be back on my feet some day
Don't care if you do cause it's understood
You ain't got no money
You just ain't no good
Hit the road Jack
And don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more
What you say?

Hit the road Jack
And don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack
And don't you come back no more
And don't you come back no more
And don't you come back no more
And don't you come back no more
And don't you come back no more
