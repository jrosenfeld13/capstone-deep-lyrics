Take it!, right! Take it!, right!
It's magic!
Don't be afraid
Belive in what you see
Belive in what I do
Belive in what you see
Belive in what I do
It's magic!
Magic, magic
Magic, magic
The magic flight!
Take it!, right!
Take it!, right!
Take it!, right!
The magic flight!
Take it!, right!
Take it!, right!
Take it!, right!
Magic beyond bless her

I'm thinking by myself
Why should I hide?
Why you want to see if it's true?
I'll show you what magic means!
Magic, magic
