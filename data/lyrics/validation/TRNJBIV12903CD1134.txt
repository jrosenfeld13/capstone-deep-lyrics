Our lives were like lines on a map
You could measure us by comparison

She found out if she took off her clothes
She could score men by embarrassment

We were nodding dogs in her company
And she hitch hiked through houses
Going nowhere on the sign
But then she'd leave the sign behind

And she said there was no music
Before I came along
They changed my brain
And I made the beatles appear
I made the beatles appear
Out of nowhere

You can drop me off here

Seeing me at the side of the road
With all the wheel trims
You'd guess my old life comes with me a story for you
But I made the beatles
And I could even invent you
