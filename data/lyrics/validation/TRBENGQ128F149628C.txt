"Our romance won't end on a sorrowful note
Though by tomorrow you're gone
The song has ended but as the songwriter wrote
The melody lingers on

They may take you from me
I'll miss your fond caress
But though they take you from me
I'll still possess...

The way you wear your hat
The way you sip your tea
The memory of all that
No they can't take that away from me
The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No, no they can't take that away from me

We may never never meet again, on that bumpy road to love
Still I'll always, always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life
No, no they can't take that away from me
No, they can't take that away from me."
