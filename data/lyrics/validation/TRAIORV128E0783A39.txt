Sometimes I rush
To get right to the end
I know I'll get to this place
When I feel the time is right

Sometimes I think
That I know what I'm all about
But when I look inside
I can see the truth come out

Sometimes I try to go on
I know it's wrong
Cos when I see your eyes
I can see the flame is gone
Gone, gone

Sometimes I climb
To the top to see what's above
But when I find it there
There's no time for happiness

Sometimes I count up to ten
Just to see when
When will I see the sun
Then my mind has just begun

Sometimes I try to go on
I know it's wrong
Cos when I see your eyes
I can see the flame is gone
Gone, gone

Sometimes I try to go on
I know it's wrong
Cos when I see your eyes
I can see the flame is gone
Gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone
