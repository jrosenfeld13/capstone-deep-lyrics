Long ago
In someone else's lifetime
Someone with my name
Who looked a lot like me
Came to know
A girl and made a promise
She only had to say
And that's where he would be
Lately
Although the feelings run just as deep
The promise he made has grown impossible to keep
And yet I wish it wasn't so
Will she miss me if I go?

In a way
It's someone else's story
I don't see myself
As taking part at all
Yesterday
A boy that I was fond of
Finally could see
The writing on the wall
Sadly
He realized he'd left her behind
And sadder than that he knew she wouldn't even mind
And though there's nothing left to say
Would she listen if I stay?

It's all very well to say you fool it's now or never
I could be choosing
No choices whatsoever

I could be
In someone else's story
In someone else's life
And she could be in mine
I don't see
A reason to be lonely
I could take my chances
Further down the line
And if
That boy I knew should ask my advice
Oh I wouldn't hesitate he needn't ask me twice
Go now!
I'd tell him that for free
Trouble is, the boy is me
The story is, the boy is me
