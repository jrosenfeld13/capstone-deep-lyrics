So long - goodbye daytime
Hello - welcome night
So - we're going downstairs
To the club - of our soul's desire

Goodbye - to the laughing, happy
Hello - to the world of meaning
Truth - combined with beauty
Purity . combined with love

Going down - going down
Going down - underground
Soul survival

No rush - the moon's still rising
But hush - the trees are whispering
At times - when the dead are coming
I heartly welcome - the sounds of night

Going down - going down
Going down - underground
Soul survival

The signs - we're wearing proudly
Dark places - we've been hiding
Our souls - have been searching
Dark moments - giving strength

Going down - going down
Going down - underground
Soul survival
