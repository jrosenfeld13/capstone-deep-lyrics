So glad you're the one
All along, I should've known
All along, I should've known
Your love was here with me
Your love, don't you know
All along, I should've known
All along, I should've known
You were the one

When I needed someone there to come through for me
Turned 'round and you were there
When I needed some good love from you
Good love is what you gave
Rain clouds or skies are blue
Your love was there

Now with your love
Don't need nothin' at all
I don't need nothin' at all
Nothin' but your love
When I see your smile
Girl, can't nothin' do me harm
Girl, can't nothin' do me harm
Can't nothin' do me harm

When I needed someone there to come through for me
Turned 'round and you were there
When I needed some good love from you
Good love is what you gave
Rain clouds or skies are blue
Your love was there

So glad to have your love
Hope you don't mind that I shared
Hope you don't mind if I tell
So glad to have your love
Can't help but feel this way
Don't care who knows at all
I don't care who knows at all
I need your love
And without your love
I would be nothin' at all
I would be nothin' at all
Nothin' without your love
