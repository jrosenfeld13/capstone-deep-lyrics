Well, I'm staying here in this place of mine
The one where you drove me out of my mind
But I'll give you a chance to get your bags all packed
I'm staying here while you're going south
I'm real damn sick of you running your mouth
But here's what I'll do, I'm going to cut you a little slack

I'll give you two weeks notice
I'll give you two weeks notice
I'll give you two weeks notice
In case you didn't hear
I'll give you two weeks notice
I'll give you two weeks notice
I'll give you two weeks notice
To get your shit out of here

You've bitched and moaned at me for ten long years
You manipulated me with phoney tears
But this is the end of that mess and the end of the road
I'm psychologically plumb wore out
I don't know much but I got no doubt
That I'm about to dump me a hundred and ten pound load

I'll give you two weeks notice
I'll give you two weeks notice
I'll give you two weeks notice
In case you didn't hear
I'll give you two weeks notice
I'll give you two weeks notice
I'll give you two weeks notice
To get your shit out of here

I'll give you two weeks notice
I'll give you two weeks notice
I'll give you two weeks notice
In case you didn't hear
I said
I'll give you two weeks notice
I'll give you two weeks notice
I'll give you two weeks notice
To get that shit out of here

I'll give you two weeks notice
I'll give you two weeks notice
I'll give you two weeks notice
In case you didn't hear
I'll give you two weeks notice
I'll give you two weeks notice
I'll give you two weeks notice
To get your shit out of here

Don't forget your drawers
And take them fucking cats and that shit box of theirs with you, too, all right
