I don't wanna be happy
In fact I like living a lie
The bright brittle files
Gleaming and white
About their colourless crime
I could break them in two
With the glint of my eye

I don't want you to know me
Unless you are shallow or sly
Using my friends
I always depend on them like charades in the sky
Once I figure them out they're a waste of my time

I only live on the surface
I don't think people are very pretty inside
And my idea of love
Isn't having a son
Or being whipped on the back of my thighs

I prefer the ridiculous
To the sublime
