I looked out of the window
Saw lightning coming through
To the place that i was living
The place that i once knew
The ghost slept next to me
And offered me protection
I never saw his face
Cause he left for resurrection
Please dont go
You are all
Please dont go
You are all
The love to leave behind
The need to find the new
Has always been a burden
Whatever i may do
One day he disappeared
And left a note behind
Stop wonder black on white
I had to loose my mind
Now hes gone farewell dear ghost
You took a piece of mine
Its yours dont hesitate
Never come back i am fine
Please dont go
You are all
Please dont go
You are all
The love to leave behind
The need to find the new
Has always been a burden
Whatever i may do
Please dont go
Please dont go
Please dont go
Please dont go
You are all
You are all
