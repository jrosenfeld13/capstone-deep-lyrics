I was lonely
It was only without you, uh huh
Then I met you
And I bet that you felt it too, uh huh
Now we're together Darlin', like birds of a feather

'Cause we've got the chemistry right
We didn't have to turn on the lovelight wow
It was on oh
We've got the chemistry right
We didn't have too try
It just turned out that way, I guess we're made that way

It's a mystery like ancient history, uh huh
Tried to understand what it's all about
But I don't care
Now we're together Darlin', like birds of a feather

'Cause we've got the chemistry right
We didn't have to turn on the lovelight wow
It was on oh
We've got the chemistry right
We didn't have too try
It just turned out that way, I guess we're made that way
