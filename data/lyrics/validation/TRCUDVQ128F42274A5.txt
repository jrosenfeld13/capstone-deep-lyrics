I stepped into the elevator
With Mattie Safer
And Milk-Eyed Mender
When there was a blackout
A blackout, a blackout, oh, oh

We stepped out to the pavement
Unmanned cars were
Crashing into unmanned cars
In the blackout
The blackout, the blackout, oh, oh

We'll never, ever go back
To the time when
When we'd shake, shake, shake, shake it all down
In the blackout
The blackout, the blackout

You never, ever find us
We go out in the cold, cold fire
You never, ever, cold, cold liar
Now we shine

And you never, ever find us
We go out in the cold, cold fire
You never, ever, cold, cold liar
Now we shine

I stepped into Lois Ida
Slowly lighter
Alone I sighted her in the
The blackout
The blackout, the blackout

Oh, we were making
Making wishes
On some missiles
We mistook for shooting stars
In the blackout
The blackout, the blackout, oh, oh

We'll never, ever go back
To the time when
When we'd shake, shake, shake, shake it all down
In the blackout
The blackout, the blackout

You never, ever find us
We go out in the cold, cold fire
You never, ever, cold, cold liar
Now we shine

And you never, ever find us
We go out in the cold, cold fire
You never, ever, cold, cold liar
Now we shine

In the blackout
Oh, the blackout

In the blackout
Oh, the blackout

Blackout, oh, the blackout
'Cause you never, ever find us
We go out in the cold, cold fire
You never, ever, cold, cold liar
Now we shine

And you never, ever find us
We go out in the cold, cold fire
You never, ever, cold, cold liar
Now we shine
