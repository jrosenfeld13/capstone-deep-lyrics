Take a look to the sky for your pot of gold
You can hear every cloud story to be told
Listen close what is this
Not bird or plane
Could it be the H bomb fucking with your brain

Even if you'd seen it you never would believe it
Even in your sleep you would never dream it
The bomb is falling fast nothing's going to stop it
How will you know that you're the last man alive
All it takes just one touch over one, two, three
With a flick of a switch turn on World War 3
With a flash there will be no one left alive
Search the earth just to find worldwide homicide
Metal mass cuts the wind whistling through it's course
Suddenly crashing down hits the ground full force
Aims to kill one and all bursting into flames
Only you're left alive no one left to blame
