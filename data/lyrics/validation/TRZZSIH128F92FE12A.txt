This passion I have
Dwindled this past year
The time it took to find out who I am
Baby you were right I should think about it now and then

This spray paint on these walls
The story of us all
The trouble with the truth there are no lies

Baby you were right
I should think about it once or twice
As we open up to the world in front of us
A thousand voices silenced but all heard

Baby you were right I should think about it more often
This love I have for you
You can question without proof
I've held my breath for years I must let go
Baby you were right I should think about it now and then
