Well I don't like ending
Like sacred heart saints
Just tell me which one that you need
To me it's all the same

Hey now I didn't want to take you home
But now I want to be alone
Pressing like
Valentine
Yeah

Cause I don't want to but I will
I don't want to but I will
I don't want to but I will

Now it's only 11:30
But I drank up all my beer
I'm empty and a Judas
Yeah, I think that's what you said

Hey now I didn't want to take you home
But you didn't want to be alone
Said that sweet story I know

Cause I don't want to but I will
I don't want to but I will
I don't want to but I will

And weeks burn like nights
Changing water into wine
Don't you know
Oh baby please don't you go

Cause I don't want to but I will
I don't want to but I will
I don't want to but I will
I don't want to but I will
I don't want to but I will
I don't want to but I will
I don't want to but I will
I don't want to but I will
I don't want to but I will
I don't want to but I will
I don't want to but I will
