Rainy Night In Georgia

Hoverin' by my suitcase
Trying to find a warm place
To spend the night
Heavy rains are falling
Seems I hear your voice calling
Alright

A rainy night in georgia
A rainy night in georgia
I believe that it's raining all over the world
I feel that it's raining all over the world

Neon signs a-flashing
Taxi cabs and buses passing
Through the night
A distant moanin' of the train
Seems to play a sad refrain
To the night

A rainy night in Georgia
Such a rainy night in Georgia
I believe that it's raining all over the world
I feel like it's raining all over the world

How many times I've wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it or think of it
It's life and we've just got to play the game

I shake the rain from my sweater
Take out your letters to pass some time
Late at night when its hard to rest
I hold your pictures to my breast
And I feel fine, fine

It's a rainy night in Georgia
Such a rainy night in Georgia
I feel that it's raining all over the world
Lord I feel like it's raining all over the world

Rainy night
Such a rainy night
(repeat to fade)

It still comes out the same
