I've been making moves in chains
Wrapped around my hollow heart
The thought of you remains
I can't replace your face no matter how I try
And in the night I cry from wanting you
You know I thought I could not lose
America was calling me
You said I must choose
Between a life of love or visions that will fade
And now the choice is made I'm so lonely

Can you feel me
Reaching out to you
I'm so lonely
Are you lonely too
I would give anything
To make you understand
That I would go anywhere
To be with you again

Heaven help me if you can
I remember better days
But now I understand
You can't buy happiness, love is not for sale
The night is turning pale and I'm needing you
I've tried to talk the time away (but the time is here to stay)
Empty ears aren't listening
To one word I say (time to play)
The dream became a big machine out of control
And here inside my soul I am so lonely

Where are you now
When I need you so
I'm so lonely
I need you to know
I would give anything (can you feel me)
To make you understand (reaching out to you)
And I would go anywhere (where are you now)
To be with you again (when I need you)
I was standing in the rain
I was trying to break the chains
I was calling out your name (something snapped inside of me)
I need to be with you again, yeah
Baby

Can you feel me (can you feel me now)
Reaching out to you
I'm so lonely (I am so lonely girl)
Are you lonely too
Where are you now (I would go anywhere)
Now I need you so
I'm so lonely (I am so lonely girl)
I need you to know

I would give anything
To make you understand
And I would go anywhere
To be with you again
And you are the only one
Who can break these chains
And I would go anywhere
To be with you again

(can you feel me)
(reaching out to you)
(where are you now)
(when I need you so)
(I'm so lonely)
(are you lonely too)
(where are you now)
(now I need you)
