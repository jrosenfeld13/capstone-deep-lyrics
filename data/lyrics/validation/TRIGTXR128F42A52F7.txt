When we got married back in 1944
We'd board that Silverliner below Baltimore
Trip to Virginia on a sunny honeymoon
Nobody cares about the railroads anymore

We'd tip the porter for a place of our own
Then send a postcard to your mom and dad back back home
Mmm, it did something to you when you'd hear that "All aboard"
Nobody cares about the railroads anymore

Woo-ee, woo-oo-oo-ee, woo-ee
Woo-ee, woo-oo-oo-ee, woo-ee

We had a daughter and you oughtta see her now
She has a boyfriend who looks just like my gal Sal
And when they're married they won't need us anymore
They'll board an aeroplane and fly away from Baltimore

Woo-ee, woo-oo-oo-ee, woo-ee
Woo-ee, woo-oo-oo-ee, woo-ee

When we got married back in 1944
We'd board that Silverliner below Baltimore
Trip to Virginia on a sunny honeymoon
Nobody cares about the railroads anymore

La la la la-la la-la-la la la bye-bye
La la la la-la la-la-la la la don't cry
Mmm, it did something to you when you'd hear that "All aboard"
Nobody cares about the railroads anymore
