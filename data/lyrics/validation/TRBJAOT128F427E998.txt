There's something natural in the way you touch me
(Yeah)
It's a feeling that I can't describe
(Yeah)
There's something mystic in the soul connection
(Yeah)
There's something magic in your misty eyes
(Yeah)
Don't you say that it's all the same
(Yeah)
Don't you say that it's all the same
No
'Cause there's something that I can't explain
'bout this
Something that I can't explain
Yeah

I can't explain
Oh no
Hey
Yeah

Before the night is over
I want to shake the question
I want to leave it for now
Without another mention

We should be letting go
Instead of holding on
But then the eye in my mind
A mystery is born

No use in looking further
You know it isn't there
And you can stare all you want
The answers won't appear

Try to find it but I lose myself

I lose myself in you
I said I lose myself in you
Yes I lose myself in you
Yeah I lose myself in you

Breathe easy lovers
Breathe easy lovers
Breathe easy lovers
Breathe easy lovers
Breathe easy

I know you're only wasting time
Breathe easy
Questioning between the lines
Breathe easy
The feeling knows no name
It is what it is
And there's no explaining
What it is, what it is
Yeaah yeah yeah

There's something natural in the way you touch me
(Yeah)
It's a feeling that I can't describe
(Yeah)
There's something mystic in the soul connection
(Yeah)
There's something magic in your misty eyes
(Yeah)
Don't you say that it's all the same
(Yeah)
Don't you say that it's all the same
No
'Cause there's something that I can't explain
'bout this
Something that I can't explain
Yeah
