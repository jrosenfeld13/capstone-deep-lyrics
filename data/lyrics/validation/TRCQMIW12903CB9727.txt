Sunshine, it drips down your back
Drips spider web lines of "Parrot Green", oh
"Petrol Black", oh
"Petrol Black", oh
It drips "Petrol Black" on my nail tips
"Midnight" on your eyelids
Sunshine, it drips down my back
Paints spider web lines of "Parrot Green", oh

The moon rises, lights on my face
Shadows glitter disguise of "Aqua Gold", oh
"Chocolate", oh

It drips "Chocolate" on my fingertips
"Robot Blue" on your lips!

Oh!
Wake up! Wake up! You!
Wake up! Wake up! You!
