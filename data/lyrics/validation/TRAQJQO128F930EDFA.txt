Red light, green light
Speedin' trough the dark night
Drivin' trough the poundin' rain
I gotta see Jane

Windshield wiper splashin'
Splashin', callin' out her name
Just gotta see Jane
I left her arms to find my way

To find a place for me in the world outside
I wasn't alive, I could not survive
The frantic pace, the constant chase
To win the race, turned my heart cold inside

I gotta find what I left behind
Red light, green light
Speedin' through the dark night
Drivin' through the poundin' rain

I gotta see Jane
Freeway, byway
Earin' up the highway
Runnin' up a world insane

Just gotta see Jane
A town of steel that isn't real
It could not feel what's in the heart of me
I was so alone in a world of stone

I missed her arms, that once held me
That made me see, I was the lonely one
But now and then I was runnin' scared
And I could feel the touch of time

Turnin' the wheel of life to yesterday
When love and happiness were mine
I gotta find that world of Jane and me
Liked it used to be

Oh, I gotta see Jane
Her love for me I pushed aside
Walked out alone
To face a world turned cold

Although I tried I could not survive
The frantic pace, the constant chase
To win the race, it's not a part of me
I've gotta find what I left behind

Oh, I gotta see Jane, I gotta see Jane
