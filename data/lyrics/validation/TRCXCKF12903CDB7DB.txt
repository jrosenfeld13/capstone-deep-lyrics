Life passed on today
She remembered all the times they had
It will never come back again
I can't wait for tomorrow
I can not bring back yesterday
Now I see the light before me
It just brings me on my way
Even in the shadows remain
Baby, I know that you and I will meet again someday

I know there's something you wanna say
You close the door at night
You make me go away

I try to make you remember... belief is all you need
And show you I'll be around forever
I try to make you remember me
I try to open your mind

Even if the stars remain
Baby, I know that you and I will meet again

I try to make you remember... belief is all you need
And show you I'll be around forever
I try to make you remember me
I try to open your mind
