Born on a quiet morning
Just a dream in someone's eyes
A dream that's like a promise meant to be
Giving rise to speculation
On a place called paradise
If I've ever been there
It's when you were with me

You're so beautiful
I can't believe my eyes
Each time I see you again
You're so beautiful
That I'm in paradise
Each time I see you again

I remember some hidden valley
Where the skies are never still
And alpine meadows burn in the evening light
I remember the path to glory
And the way around the hill
I remember true love's eyes
Shining in the night

You're so beautiful
I can't believe my eyes
Each time I see you again
You're so beautiful
That I'm in paradise
Each time I see you again

And if paradise is everything you see
Then the place you must be coming from
Is ecstasy

You're so beautiful
That I can't believe my eyes
Each time I see you again
You're so beautiful
That I'm in paradise
Each time I see you again

Just want to see you again
I want to be with you again
I just need to love you again
Just wanna touch you again
I just need to love you again
I want to be with you again
Touch you again
Love you again
With you again
