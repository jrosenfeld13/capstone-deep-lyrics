All we need in this world
Is to have a time if peace
A time of light and love
With all guidance from above
A time a man can understand
Being free
Oh in a time of peace

We need peace for our children
So that they may live a better life
What joy divine
What a perfect state of mind
With their worries and cares
Left behind
