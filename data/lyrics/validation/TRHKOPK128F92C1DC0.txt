A world without your love
Would leave me in despair
Such loneliness, such emptiness
Is more than I can bear

A world without your smile
Would be an empty place
Your tenderness, your sweet caress
Would never be replaced

Tomorrow's world is full of laughter
But our dreams could easily fade and die
If you go there's no happy after ever
We must stay together, make it last forever
(Oh) my love
If you ever go away

My world without your love
Would never be the same
No one to care, no life to share
I know that I can't face

My world without your love
Would be a tragedy
Don't let it be my destiny
A world without your love
