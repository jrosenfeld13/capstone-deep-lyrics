How long before we see we have broken those chains
.(?)...just like the bird that sings it in the dream baby we are born free
Oh now, I wan't you to know now we are in charge of our own destiny
Freedom is only but a state of mind, you've got to leave them shackles behind

Don't you cry freedom, exercise your freedom
Don't cry freedom, exercise your freedom
Don't cry freedom, it's a state of mind
Oh..ooooh..cry..don't cry, don't cry...well well, well

Freedom is only but a state of mind, you've got to leave them shackles behind
Yeah, Yeah
Some of us get to dance on a dream
Every day we pray to that which we cannot see
Why is it so, so difficult to love that which we see?
Love for you and me

Tell me now, do you like what you see?
Are those images forced upon us, reflections of you and me
Don't you let them play upon your mind, you've got to leave them shackles behind

.(?).I wan't you to know that, we are each other our own destiny
Just like the bird that sings within the dreams, baby you are born free
Oh yeah, every night oh now
Don't you cry freedom, freedom, don't cry, don't cry oh now, freedom
Don't you cry freedom, exercise your freedom it's a state of.., don't cry Freedom
Just like the bird that sings within the dream baby you are born free
