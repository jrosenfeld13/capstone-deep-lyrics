Do you wanna know what is right or wrong?
Do you wanna know if you would be strong?
But I don't wanna know what is right or wrong
To fight my inner fears 'cause I'm strong!

[Pre - Chorus:]
There's one thing I want know
When my life is running slow
It cuts like a knife
To feel the signs of life

Do you wanna know who is friend or foe?
Do you wanna know if they want to trick or treat?
But I don't wanna know who's friend or foe
And I never wanna know if they want trick or treat!

[Pre - Chorus:]
There's one thing I want know
When my life is running slow
It cuts like a knife
To feel the signs of life

[Chorus:]
Live everyday and take your way
Live everyday no way to stay

Do you wanna know when your time has come?
Do you wanna know if you'll be alive?
But I don't wanna know whwn my time has come
To take this little time to be alive!

[Pre - Chorus:]
There's one thing I want know
When my life is running slow
It cuts like a knife
To feel the signs of life

[Chorus:]
Live everyday and take your way
Live everyday no way to stay

No way. No way to stay!

[Bridge:]
There's one thing I want know
When my life is running slow
It cuts like a knife
To feel the signs of life

[Chorus:]
Live everyday and take your way
Live everyday no way to stay

No way. No way to stay!
