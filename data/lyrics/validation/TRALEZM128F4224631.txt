Ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah
Ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah

Ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah
Ah, ah ah, ah ah, ah

[Verse 1 - D. Woods]
You make me hotter than Jamaica
Proceed with caution cause you're dangerous
Maybe it's just cause you're Blasian
Cause every minute boy I'm tryin' to savor all

[Pre-Chorus - Dawn]
When you're passing by me, I just (want to do)
Every little thing she wouldn't (do for you)
How could anyone not fall in (love with you)
Do something to me I wish that (I had you)

[Chorus - Danity Kane]
You're so hot
There must be two of you
Boy you got me having breakfast in the afternoon
When you take my body, up to the moon
It be feeling so good it has to be two of you

[Aundrea]
If you feel me lemme hear it 1 time
If you feel me lemme hear it 2 times
If you with me lemme hear it 3 times
If you with me lemme hear it 4 times

[Aundrea]
I don't care about your paper
Or how many gifts your pay for
Don't worry bout me bringin' the bull-shhh
Cause this feels too good to funk it up

[Pre-Chorus - Dawn]
When you're passing by me, I just (want to do)
Every little thing she wouldn't (do for you)
How could anyone not fall in (love with you)
Do something to me I wish that (I had you)

[Chorus - Danity Kane]
You're so hot
There must be two of you
Boy you got me having breakfast in the afternoon
When you take my body, up to the moon
It be feeling so good it has to be two of you

[Aundrea]
If you feel me lemme hear it 1 time
If you feel me lemme hear it 2 times
If you with me lemme hear it 3 times
If you with me lemme hear it 4 times

[Bridge - Dawn]
Now let me see your hands up in the air
Yeah, do your dance
Tell me what you came here to see
C'mon and rock me

[Verse 3 - Aubrey]
My name is Aubrey (What)
And I'm so cold
My style is flashy--your style is old (ah ah)
Cause' I'm fly as hell with the juicy humps
I don't want your man cause I got enough
So don't be mad at me cause he be callin' my phone
I got my eye on one guy
Tell him leave me alone

[Shannon]
He likes my personality one of a kind
I'm so unique, I set the trend you follow me
But this is one brings me to my knees

[Chorus - Danity Kane (Aundrea ad-libs)]
You're (Oh) so hot (so hot)
There must be two of you, (Yeah)
Boy you got me having breakfast in the afternoon (having breakfast in the afternoon)
When you take my body, (take my body) up to the moon (away with you)
If its feeling so good (so good, so good, so good) it has to be two of you

[Aundrea (D. Woods ad-libs)]
If you feel me lemme hear it 1 time (clap with me)
If you feel me lemme hear it 2 times (if you're with me)
If you with me lemme hear it 3 times (Ohh)
If you're with me lemme hear it 4 times (Put your hands together now)
