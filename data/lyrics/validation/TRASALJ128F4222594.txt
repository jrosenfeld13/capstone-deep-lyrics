Once upon a summertime, if you recall
We stopped beside a little flower stall
A bunch of bright forget me nots
Was all I'd let you buy me

Once upon a summertime, just like today
We laughed the happy afternoon away
And stole a kiss in every street caf

You were sweeter than the blossoms on the tree
I was as proud as any girl could be
As if the mayor had offered me the key to Paris

Now, another winter has come and gone
The pigeons feeding in the square have flown
But I remember when the vespers chime
You loved me, once upon a summertime
