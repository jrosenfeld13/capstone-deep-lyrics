Riddim!
You ready michael?!
Rock with me
And you hear the sound
A little bit of riddim make the world go round
Whoaaa
And you hear the sound
A little bit of riddim make the world go round
Whoaaa
And you hear the sound
A little bit of riddim make the world go round
Whoaaa
And you hear the sound
A little bit of riddim make the world go round
Whoaaa
Do you remember the time before
Every day was the news of a holy world
When the people was afraid to tell you what they want
Everybody in the city always hide at home
