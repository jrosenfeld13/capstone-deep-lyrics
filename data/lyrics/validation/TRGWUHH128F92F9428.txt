I'm not dead or alive
My thoughts clouded pristine
A static web internecine
The cutting edge of a lie
Will only furrow the dream
Solders the soul together clean

The poison enters the veins
It's woven into the stream
My new casket is lined with screams

I'm not dead or alive
My thoughts clouded pristine
A static web internecine
The cutting edge of a lie
Will only furrow the dream
Solders the soul together clean

The poison enters the veins
It's woven into the stream
My new casket is lined with screams

I'm never going to die
Cause my world is built on lies
Burned it all
Watched it fall
No elation inside these walls

Breaking down again
Barricade forms within
Tearfully rejoicing
Finally the sun will see it's end

The poison enters the veins
It's woven into the stream
My new casket is lined with screams

Burned it all
Watched it fall
No elation inside these walls
