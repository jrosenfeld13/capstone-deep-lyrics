[Verse 1]
Oh to be delighted by You and to see the colors of Your train?
And to be freed by You
It would be, it would be, it would be my claim to fame

[Chorus]
So rejoice my friend because my friend
You've got a friend indeed
It is for freedom He set us free

[Verse 2]
But Simon says to fill your void
With toy after toy after girl after boy
After all isn't that what we were meant for

[Chorus 2]
Please believe me when I say
It is for freedom He set us free

[Bridge]
"Oh, poor us," we sigh
"Pour us out," I cry

So we can be
So we can be, yeah
So we can be
So we can be, yes
Be free now

[Verse 3]
The bigger picture is there is a holy calling
And, oh how I'm slowly falling, falling, falling in love
And Your water has been pouring out on me

[Chorus 3]
How could I be so naive
It is for freedom, it is for freedom
It is for freedom He set us free, yeah-yeah-yeah
Woah-woah
Yes, oh-mmm-mmm
It is for freedom He set us free
