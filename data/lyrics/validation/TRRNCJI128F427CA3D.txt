I remember when I'd run to you
Through fields of white flowers
Your embrace was my air
How I needed you there
All of the world and all of its powers
Couldn't keep your love from me

'Cause I need you like the dragonfly's wings need the wind
Like the orphan needs home once again
Like heaven needs more to come in
I need you here like you've always been

Then I waved goodbye to you
From fields of white flowers
You were so proud of me
I was too proud to see
That all of the world and all of it's powers
Couldn't keep your love from me

I need you like the dragonfly's wings need the wind
Like the orphan needs home once again
Like heaven needs more to come in
I need you here like you've always been

Taking for granted all of her smiles that got away

Now I'm looking up at you
From fields of white flowers
You were so proud of me
I'm so proud of you
All of the world and all of its powers
Couldn't keep your love from me
