Baby watch your back
Baby watch your back
Baby watch your back
Baby watch your back

I watched you come and go and never noticed
Like daily papers, faces, knick-knacks
But now I've seen you
And you are my focus
Baby watch your back
I went my days and nights
Not knowing of you
But now you fill my every minute
And I can't stop myself for my thoughts
Of you are infinite

I watch you
You hate me
I don't like you
But I want to have your baby
You ain't got no soul
I don't really get you
You ain't got no soul
Like I've never met you
You ain't got no soul
But I'm gonna let you in
For a big surprise (Oh)
Baby watch your back
Baby watch your back
Baby watch your back
Baby watch your back

Now you walk down the street and I follow
Wearing my wig and funny glasses
And I will follow you wherever you go
Baby watch your back
I'll catch you one day in the rain or the fog
And then you'll realize how I care
And I'm invincible for I am like smog
I'm everywhere

I touch you
I feel you
I brush you
Soon I'll steal you

You ain't got no soul
Like I've never met you
You ain't got no soul
But I'm gonna let you in
For a big surprise (Oh)
Baby watch your back
Baby watch your back
Baby watch your back
Baby watch your back
Baby watch your back
Baby watch your back
Baby watch your back
