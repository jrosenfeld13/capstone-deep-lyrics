Abject... Engulfed...

Assail the heathen you!
Cheer the martyr home
Never drop your guard

Smear campaign against clarity
A no-sided argument
Bite that tongue!

Slum in a turgid rut
Self-flagellate to assure
Pleasures trampled flat

Obligation to those pious myths
A no-sided argument

You seem a brow-beaten husk -
Sheltered from salacious 'everything'
You've reached saturation point -
Every violating human touch
Sets bombs off inside your brain

With turmoil as an epitaph
A no-sided argument
