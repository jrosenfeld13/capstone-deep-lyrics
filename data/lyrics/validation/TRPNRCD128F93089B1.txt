We were on some endless chases
Living out of old suitcases
It was showing on our faces
True
And we barely both remember
How we made it through December
And the bruises still are tender
True

But I won't let you go in the rain and the snow
You object, it's a show
Cause you know I'm right
Put your coat on the floor
Leave your shoes by the door
Take a seat
Take some tea
Stay with me tonight

We were sick of all our places
We'd forgotten our good graces
And you're making funny faces
True
And I know if you're replying
You don't even want me trying
You get nervous when you're lying
True

But I won't let you go in the rain and the snow
You object, it's a show
Cause you know I'm right
Put your coat on the floor
Leave your shoes by the door
Take a seat
Take some tea
Stay with me tonight
