Where are the days
The days that time erased
Innocence
Weve had has been replaced
We were so
Free of hate theyve taken that away
All I see is responsibility forced on me

Chorus:
Never again
Never again
Ah ohh ohohohohoh
Never again
Never again
Ah ohh oh

All around
Were made to hear the sound
All our choice has trampled to the ground
Everything stays the same
The lion has been slaved
Still the flame
Of youth lies in wait
But too late now

Repeat chorus twice
