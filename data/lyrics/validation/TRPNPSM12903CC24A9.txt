Well I don't know what you heard, but I'm here to spread the word
Of rock n' roll, fuckin' rock n' roll
To all you fuckers that are outta control
I'm here to let you know you're not the only ones that let loose and have a little fun

Whether it's drinkin', fuckin', or drugs
With all three man, I'm I am in love
I really want it, I really want it, I really want it and yeah I'm gonna get it
I really want it, I really want it, and you better not fuckin' forget it
Just inked a deal with Trustkill
Now I get to tell the world how I feel
And anyone that gets in my way, there's gonna be hell to pay

Oh yeah, I said it, and you can bet your ass I meant it
Oh yeah, I said it, and if you want some come and get it

And I don't know what you've been told
A lot of people try to say I'm ice cold
I'm just talkin' shit and swallowin' spit
If you don't like it you can suck my fuckin' dick

Girls, girls, and more fuckin' girls
Are the most beautiful things in my world
It's hard to please them all but you can bet I'll try
I wanna fuck, I wanna fuck 'til I die
I really love it, I really love it, I really love it and I can't get enough of it
I really love it, I really love it, and there ain't nothing gonna change my mind
Now I know what you're thinkin'
You're thinkin' he must be fakin'
But I've only got one thing lett to say
Fight Paris is here to fuckin' stay

Oh yeah, I said it, and you can bet your ass I meant it
And if you want some come and get it
Oh yeah, I said it, fuck with me and you'll regret it
But if you want some come and get it
But if you want some come and get it

Champagne talk to 'em
I wanna fuck all night long
I wanna drink 'til I'm gone
I wanna smoke from my bong
And I don't see a damn thing wrong

I wanna fuck all night long
I wanna drink 'til I'm gone
I wanna smoke from my bong
And I don't see a damn thing wrong
And I don't see a damn thing wrong
And I don't see a damn thing wrong
And I don't see a damn thing wrong
And I don't see a damn thing wrong
