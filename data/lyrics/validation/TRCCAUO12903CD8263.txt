It seems to me, you and me
Are chasing something, yeah
What it is does anybody here want to know?
It seems to you, you and me
Are forgetting something, yeah
When love is so easily forgotten

And if I pick you up will you drag me down?
If I run to you will you turn around?
Rise and fall turn the wheel 'cause all life is
Is really just a circle

It seems to me, you and me
Are being chased by something, yeah
What it is has anybody here apprehended?
It seems to me, you and me
Are terrified of nothing
When nothing is the reason we are here
Oh, nothing at all

And if I cry to you, will you laugh me down?
But I'm asking you to turn around
Rise and fall turn the wheel 'cause all life is
Is really just a circle

You are the only one I want
You are the only one I want
You are the only one I want
You are, you are, you are, you are, you are, you are

And if I cry to you, will you laugh me down?
But I'm asking you to turn around
Rise and fall turn the wheel 'cause all life is
Is really just a circle

Rise and fall turn the wheel 'cause all life is
Is really just a circle

Rise and fall turn the wheel 'cause all life is
Is really just a circle

Rise and fall turn the wheel 'cause all life is
Is really just a circle
