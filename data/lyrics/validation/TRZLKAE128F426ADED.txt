Into the world my heart is set in motion
Guided by a notion of faith
Still there are days I'm drowning in the ocean
I hit my knees and fold my hands
Hoping that You'll understand

And in the event You are listening, You're listening
And Jesus was sent to forgive me, forgive me
Then in His name I'm petitioning, petitioning
In the event You are listening, You're listening

I'm closing my eyes and counting all the blessings
Never second-guessing the truth
Yet there are times I find myself confessing
That I need more than just a favor
I need someone, I need a Savior

And in the event You are listening, You're listening
And Jesus was sent to forgive me, forgive me
Then in His name I'm petitioning, petitioning
In the event You are listening, You're listening

I wouldn't blame You
If You turned a deaf ear to the world
And never saved us
Nor forgave us
But You had mercy on us all

In His name I'm petitioning, petitioning
In the event You are listening, You're listening
In every event You are listening, You're listening
And Jesus was sent to forgive me, forgive me
In His name I'm petitioning, petitioning
In the event You are listening, You're listening
You're listening
