I said I don't care what you think about me
But your words cut deep into me
As I sit out in the yard
I wonder how we got this far apart

I tell you I love you
I tell you I care
I tell you I'll always be right there

But you don't listen
Am I wasting my time?
Trying to love you
Am I falling behind?

You don't love me
You don't care
You don't need me
You never did
And I was wrong
Because I tried
And I believed you
When I looked in your eyes

You don't love me
You don't care
You don't need me
You never did
And I was wrong
Because I tried
And I don't believe you
When I look in your eyes
When I look in your eyes
