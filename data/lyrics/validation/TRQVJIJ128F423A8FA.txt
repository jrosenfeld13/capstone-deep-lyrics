Somethings gotta give with the way I'm living
Seems I'm getting down everyday
The more I strive, the less I'm alive
And seems I'm getting further away

Oh well all my superstitions and my crazy suspicions
Of the people that I care about
I been doing more scheming than I been doing dreaming
And I think it's time I figure it out

Yeah baby I need a plan to understand
That life ain't only supply and demand

I been going jogging in the park after dark
Draggin 'round with me my ball and chain
Took southern skies to make me realize
That I'm causing myself this pain

The woman that I'm loving yeah I'm pushing and shoving
Getting further on by the day
And I can't understand how the heart of this man
Ever let it end up this way

Yeah baby I need a plan to understand
That life ain't only supply and demand

When the road gets dark and lonesome dear
You can find me here
But honey you don't know where I am
You need a friend yeah

Life ain't easy in fact I know it's sleazy
When you're the big man in town
Shaking religions making decisions
You never get slow on down

Well your wife and your baby you tell them yeah well maybe
I'll meet y'all at a weekend resort
But your eyes on the prize you can't realize
Your little girl's life's so short

Brother you need a plan to understand
That life ain't only supply and demand
Yeah sister you need a plan to understand
That life ain't only supply and demand

Hey, you better figure it out now
You know you ain't coming back down, yeah
You better figure it out now
You know you ain't coming back down
