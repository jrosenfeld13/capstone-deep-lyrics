Money
Make you feel real good
I always take it more than I know I should
You never give it away for free
You're always stealing a little love from me

[Hook]
But you got to give it up
If you wanna live it up
You got to give it up
If you wanna live it up

Ha!

You always take it, take it, take it, take it
Take it, take it, take it, take it
Take it, take it, take it, take it, ah
Take it, take it, take it, take it, oh

Give it up
If you wanna live it up
Oh, you got to give it up
If you wanna live it up
You got to give it up
If you wanna live it up
You got to give it up
If you wanna live it up
