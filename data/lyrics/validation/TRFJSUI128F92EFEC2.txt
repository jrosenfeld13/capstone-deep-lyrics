I got the blues when my baby left me down by the Frisco Bay;
An ocean liner came and took her away
I didn't mean to treat her bad, she was the best gal I ever had;
She said good-bye, made me cry
Made me wanna lay down my head and die


Well I ain't got a nickel, and I ain't got a lousy dime?
She don't come back, I think I'm gonna lose my mind
She ever comes back to stay, it's gonna be another brand new day
Walkin' with my baby by the San Francisco Bay

Well, I'm sittin' here on the back porch, don't know which way to go;
The gal that I'm so crazy about, she don't love me anymore
Think I'm gonna take a freight train, cause I'm feelin' blue
Gonna ride it to the end of the line, thinkin' only of you


Well I ain't got a nickel, and I ain't got a lousy dime?
She don't come back, I think I'm gonna lose my mind
She ever comes back to stay, it's gonna be another brand new day
Walkin' with my baby by the San Francisco Bay
Walkin' with my baby by the San Francisco Bay
Walkin' with my baby by the San Francisco Bay
