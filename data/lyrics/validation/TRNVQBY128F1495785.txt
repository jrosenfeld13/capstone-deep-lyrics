(Rhett Akins/Chris Gantry)

Well I know it's late but girl I just had to call
This just can't wait 'cause I ain't slept a wink at all
Since we said goodbye
And I know that I'm the only one to blame
I thought we were right to turn and go our separate ways
But I know tonight that I can't stand another day
Of being alone, tryin' to hang on
And I can't take no more of this pain

I was wrong to let you go
And now that you're gone
My life's out of control
I was wrong you told me from the start
I'd never find truer love
Than the love in your heart
Love so strong you were right I was wrong

Girl could you find a way to give us one more chance
A day at a time maybe that's too much to ask
But you're all I 've got and believe it or not
Without you I know I can't go on

I was wrong to let you go
And now that you're gone
My life's out of control
I was wrong you told me from the start
I'd never find truer love
Than the love in your heart
Love so strong you were right I was wrong

I was wrong you told me from the start
I'd never find truer love
Than the love in your heart
Love so strong you were right I was wrong
I was wrong
Oh I was wrong
