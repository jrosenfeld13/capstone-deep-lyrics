Talkin' about you a man always ready to go
Now when it comes to movin', babe you're awful slow
And holler oh oh oh oh woah
And holler oh oh oh oh woah
I'm a w-o-m-a-n, a woman, a woman

You ain't got nothing in your pockets to keep me alive
But I got something for all you men to make you cry
And holler oh oh oh oh woah
And holler oh oh oh oh woah
I'm a w-o-m-a-n, a woman, a woman

Well Davey Crokett king of the wild frontier
I'll tame him down the hell (?) he was in
Jesse James, baddest man in the land
You shoulda saw me when I had him eatin', out of my hand

Now Dillinger, the woman in red got him
Now that should teach ya about a w-o-m-a-n
And holler oh oh oh oh woah
And holler oh oh oh oh woah
I'm a w-o-m-a-n, a woman, a woman, woman, woman, woman, woman
