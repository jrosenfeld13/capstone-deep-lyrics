Uncharted wrecks of wonder
In deepest gloom down under
The drowning men are drawing near

We're the subterranean vandals
Tying air lines around door handles
Adventures don't venture here

We're the drowning men
We're the drowned men

The mutant freaks fantastical
Knife's edge, unreal or actual
Ambition stunted, the future fated

Shall we rise from sunken places
Walk the streets, unnatural, graceless
Wipe the smile from your faces
If we can make it
