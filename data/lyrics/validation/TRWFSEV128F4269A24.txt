Dream, dream away
Dance on the thread of reality
A web of possibilities
Caught in the light of dawn
Soothing memories
The heart is the fountain
The mind shifts shape
And leaves the body trembling
Drifting through the shadows
Dissolving into shades
Of a blackened dark existence
An unknown, untold past...
Hand in the water
The water of the wishing well
Wrinkles turn to waves
Like a butterfly and a hurricane
Weaver of dreams
Waiting for the seventh wave
The wave of hope
I lost my sense of time
Fray of madness
Fabric of time starts to rip on the edges
Unravel at the fringes
My demon's on the loose
Fears that crush my dreams
Caught up in my own anxiety
Walls of repressed emotions
Leading me round and round
Looking for a way out of this labyrinth
You were always there
Ready to disentangle
Free me from the halter
I knotted it in my dreams
Hands that search for grip
Stirring the sands of time
Caught up in my own anxiety
Your hand was there
Taking me by the shoulder
Just before the dawn you broke the spell
You were always there
Ready to disentangle
Free me from the halter
I knotted it in my dreams
Colours fade from the curtains
Like a kaleidoscope of images projected
On the walls that start to crumble
Pressed into existence
Tears bleeding from a picture frame
A hand no longer there
Your side of the bed cold
A morning call left unspoken
