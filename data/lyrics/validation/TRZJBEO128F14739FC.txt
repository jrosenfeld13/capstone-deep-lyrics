Born to a family that taught me wrong from right
I learned to fear God at an early age and to say my prayers at night
But as I got a little older I started to stray
Took some turns off of the straight and narrow way

Had to learn about another side of life
I held some women and held that bottle tight
But I've never forgotten the way I was raised
I'm torn between the things I believe and the things I crave

There's a roadside bar room where I love to play
On my way home there's a little church where I kneel to pray
And it's such a fine line between wrong and right
Sunday mornin' and Saturday night

I guess, I'll wonder 'til the day I die
If I'm a saint or a sinner down deep inside
When it's over and they lay me down
Will my soul be heaven sent or hell bound?

There's a roadside bar room where I love to play
On my way home there's a little church where I kneel to pray
And it's such a fine line between wrong and right
Sunday mornin' and Saturday night

It's such a fine line between wrong and right
Sunday mornin' and Saturday night
