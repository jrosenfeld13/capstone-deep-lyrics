[Verse 1]
Girl like me can be so dramatic
World premieres
Something like a classic

If you love me baby
Then I like shining
The pink and the yellow ones
I like diamonds

This is how I know it ain't temporary
I'm the type of girl you'd play to marry
I know you want to
But what's holdin you?
Crying at my door saying you're so confused

[Hook:]
My heart, my love
My time
It's more precious then you'll ever find
Someone so true so nice
And this way [?]

[Chorus:]
Baby I could be your rockstar (rockstar)
And we'll shine
Bright like the sun (baby)

Your rockstar (rockstar)
And I'll be your only one
We can go far (go far)

Show me you're for real
Put that rock on me (rock on me)
And that's gon' close the deal
I should be you're rockstar (rockstar)

You're rockstar
Rockstar, baby
Rockstar
Rockstar
I should be you're rockstar (rockstar)

[Verse 2:]
A girl like me can be hard to touch
But if you put me on, baby
I'm good love

I'll be your angel
Your protection
I'll give you all of my affection

I can stay if you try to strain me
Give me all your love, boy
Don't be stingy
I like glittering and I like shining
Only the forever girls get their diamonds

[Repeat hook:]

[Repeat Chorus:]
