We spend our nights in shared dreams
Wrapped in a jade green mist
Our hearts running wild, as the spirit is free
Nothing compares to this
Can you picture this a beauty unexplained
All the stories every told revealing

After the ocean is gone
Where do we go what do we do
Can we carry on in a world without love
Can I carry on in a world without you

Oooh

A message came to us all
Across a moonlit sky
A love flowing endlessly
Soft as a virgin sigh
Can you picture this, a beauty unexplained
All the stories ever told revealing

After the ocean is gone
Where do we go what do we do
Can we carry on in a world without love
Can I carry on in a world without you

After the oceans are gone
What will we do where will we be
Will we carry on in a world without blue
Will you carry on in a world without me
Oooh, Oooh

Bring your out-thereness in here
In here, in here

Don't be afraid to be yourself
Love and light will wash away your tears
In here

We are all stars in the night
Fish in the mountain stream
No reason to cry
Nothing is as it seems
Can you picture this, a beauty unexplained
All the stories ever told revealing

After the ocean is gone
Where do we go what do we do
Can we carry on in a world without love
Can I carry on in a world without you

After the oceans are gone
What will we do where will we be
Will we carry on in a world without blue
Will you carry on in a world without me
Oooh, Oooh (x2)
