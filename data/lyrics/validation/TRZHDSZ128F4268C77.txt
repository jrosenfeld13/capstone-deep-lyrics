Full assistance to those who bear it all
Unable to fall, waiting patiently
Backs against the wall
Not allowing the weak to dictate, when it's our turn to recover

(Show me that)
If your experiences don't compare, just turn the tables
(Don't compare)
Stop acting like you really care, if you're not stable

Full resistance to those who care at all
Directing the call, it's consuming us
Backs against the wall
Convincing the meek to dictate all their actions on command
And eviction to those who swear it all
Fit to befall the false memory
Facts begin to stall
Permitting the bleak existance, this is our time to discover

(Show me that)
If your experiences don't compare, just turn the tables
(Don't compare)
Stop acting like you really care, if you're not stable
(Show me that)
If your experiences don't compare, just turn the tables
(Don't compare)
Stop acting like you really care, and turn the tables

There will come a time for us to change things
And I will never strike at you again
I will try to learn to make amends
You will never lessen who I am
Don't be sheltered show me where you've been
Show me where you've been
Show me where you've been

(Show me that)
If your experiences don't compare, just turn the tables
(Don't compare)
Stop acting like you really care, if you're not stable
(Show me that)
If your experiences don't compare, just turn the tables
(Don't compare)
Stop acting like you really care, and turn the tables

(Turn the tables x6)
(Turn the tables x6)
Becoming yourself now, achieving what you allow
Don't take it out on us all
Becoming yourself now, achieving what you allow
