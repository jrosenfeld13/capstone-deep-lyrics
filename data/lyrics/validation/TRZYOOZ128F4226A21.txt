[Verse 1]
What if I told you this was a lie
Would you turn your back on me
Or break down and cry
What if I could give you faith to stand up and fight
Do you believe in love might change your mine

[Pre-Hook]
And I say oh maybe I'll kick tomorrow
Maybe I'll quit today
Maybe I'll fight this war going on in my head
Maybe I'll get the sunshine
To brighten up this day
Maybe I'll fight this war going on in my head

[Hook]
Feels like I'm waiting to die
I get caught up in your insainity
I'll take my pictures of time
And seperate here from your tragedy

[Verse 2]
Lost all my patience had enough of your mind
Don't want your reasons I won't waste time
Exuse me for livin' forgive me for tryin'
But you can have your life
Your way cuz I'm takin mine

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Don't worry about me
Oh I'll feel fine
Don't worry about me
It might take a life time
Don't worry about me
I'll be all right
Don't worry about me

[Hook]
