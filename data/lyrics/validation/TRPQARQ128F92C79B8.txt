I feel it
Can't feel it
There's something in the air
I feel it
Can't feel it
There's something in the air
I feel it
Can't feel it
There's something in the air
I feel that all the things we are isn't enough

Ain't just about time
Keep waiting for signs
Last time we got high
We thought we had the puzzle worked out
Can't got with your eyes
Tired of being washed out
You don't need my advice
We just need to stop saying good-bye
It's hard to understand (doooooo)
It's easy to make things land (doooo)
We know how to work out (doooo)
But not how to get in (doooo)
It's hard to understand (doooo)
The answer is in your hands (doooo)
Start turning down that fans (doooo)
Or please prepare for change

I feel it
Can't feel it
There's something in the air
I feel it
Can't feel it
There's something in the air
I feel it
Can't feel it
There's something in the air
I feel it
Can't feel it
I feel it
Can't feel it
I feel it
Can't feel it
I feel it
Can't feel it
I feel it
I feel it
I feel it
I feel it
I feel it
I feel it
I feel it
I feel it
