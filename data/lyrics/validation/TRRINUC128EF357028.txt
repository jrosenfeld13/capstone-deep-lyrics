[Verse 1]
Old yellow bricks, love's a risk
Quite the little escapologist
Looked so miffed when you wished
For a thousand places better than this
You are the fugitive but you don't know what you're running from
You can't kid us and you couldn't trick anyone
Houdini, love, you don't know what you're running away from

[Chorus]
Who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?
Blinded by nostalgia
Who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?

[Verse 2]
She was enraged by the way
That the emperor put traps in the cage
And the days she'd been dull
Lead to nights reading beer bottles
You're such a fugitive but you don't know what you're running from
You can't kid us and you couldn't trick anyone
Houdini, love, you don't know what you're running away from

[Chorus]
Who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?
Blinded by nostalgia
Who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?

[Verse 3]
You're at a loss just because
It wasn't all that you thought it was
You are the fugitive
But you don't know what you're running away from
She said, "I want to sleep in the city that never wakes up
And revel in nostalgia"
I know I said, "Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?"
But Dorothy was right though
