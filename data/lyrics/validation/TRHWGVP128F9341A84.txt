[Chorus 1]
You don't look, but you kick me
You can't feel, but you hit me
You can't deal with the way I pray

[Chorus 2]
Why we all have to look this way
I got a heart, I got blood, feel pain

[Verse 1]
Time, time is not on my side
Because the way I am
Got a got a now, got to find the reason why
A woman ain't a man

[Chorus 1]
You don't look, but you kick me
You can't feel, but you hit me
You can't deal with the way I pray

[Chorus 2]
Why we all have to look this way
I got a heart, I got blood, feel pain

[Verse 2]
Fall in those single file lines
Like army ants
Yeah, fall on into those single file lines
And complete the plan

[Chorus 1]
You don't look, but you kick me
You can't feel, but you hit me
You can't deal with the way I pray

[Chorus 2]
Why we all have to look this way
I got a heart, I got blood, feel pain

[Chorus 1]
You don't look but you kick me
You can't feel but you hit me
You can't deal with the way I pray
