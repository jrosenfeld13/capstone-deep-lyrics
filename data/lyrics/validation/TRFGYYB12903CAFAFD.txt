Baby, baby, baby I dont want to
Ever give you the wrong idea
Call me up we'll hang out
Im down for whatever
Tell me am I making myself clear?

Love can be a meaningless emotion
Pretty words that were obliged say
Rest assured I won't ask for your complete devotion
Lets not let our hearts get in the way

Finally
The weight is off our shoulders
Play for keeps
Until the night is over

Now you know of my cruel intentions
I can play a hard game I'll admit
So it goes
We both know
Youre worthy of my affection
Youre not the one who I'll spend my life with

Call me up we'll hang out
Call me up we'll hang out
Im down for whatever

Finally
The weight is off our shoulders
Play for keeps
Until the night is over

Call me up we'll hang out
Call me up we'll hang out
Call me up we'll hang out
Im down for whatever

Call me up we'll hang out
(finally)
Call me up we'll hang out
Call me up we'll hang out
(finally)
I'm down for whatever
Until the night is over

Call me up we'll hang out
I'm down for whatever
Call me up we'll hang out
I'm down for whatever
Call me up we'll hang out
I'm down for whatever
Call me up we'll hang out
I'm down for whatever
