Tonight, tonight, while I'm holding you so near
Tonight, tonight, what I'd give if I could hear
The three little words that would thrill the heart of me--
Just whisper, "I love you, and will eternally."

Tonight, tonight, more than any time before
This heart of mine seems to need you so much more
The touch of your hands, the thrill of your embrace
Keep saying that no one will ever take your place

While looking up afar
I wished upon a star
And prayed for a blessing from above
Now, if my wish should come true
Until our life is through
I'll have you, dear, to have, to hold and to love

Well, tonight, tonight may never reach an end
I'll miss you so 'til you're in my arms again
With all of my heart, I declare with all my might
I'll love you forever, as I love you tonight

(repeat last verse)
