Come forth, the goddess of sodomy
My body is the source of pain, bow
Worship me and suck my soul
Every single hole in you is mine, so now
Obey

Deep inside, you feel me pulsate
More and more and more
I hear you groan, you want me inside
Again, again, again, again
You give me pleasure, I offer you pain
The highest level of ecstasy, sexually insane

Behind my mask of pretending, I hide
In my dominion of pain

I am your god, I am your believes
I control your desire, with my godlike white salted wine

Behind my mask of pretending, I hide
In my dominion of pain

I am the way to the land of your pleasure
I am the way to your eternal lust
