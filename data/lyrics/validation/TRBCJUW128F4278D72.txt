But he was someone who looked like you
Thought maybe I'd be able to
Pretend for a while
But I was tripping and pretending that I didn't
No one was looking
So I thought that maybe prison
Would be better for my heart
Than to be torn apart...
Again by you
It was the love that I tried to prove
But more a love that I tried to move
And take for my own
In the beginning i was winning
And i took you
But now i m fading and the ceiling
Starts to cave in
There's not even room for the room of doom
Again by you
Even though it broke my heart
Again by you
Even though I'm torn apart
And my heart, a broken heart
Even though it was love we knew
Even so it is time that'll prove
We'll know in a while
But all the whys have turned to minutes of forever
And all the smiles have turned to willows that will whither
And seed unborn days
To be stolen away
Again by you
Even though it broke my heart
Again by you
Even though I'm torn apart
Again by you
Second wind blew miles apart
And my heart, oh broken heart
Again by you
Even though it broke my heart
Again by you
Even though I'm torn apart
Again by you
Second wind blew miles apart
And my heart, oh broken heart
Even though it broke my heart
Even though I'm torn apart
Again by you
Second wind blew mines apart
And my heart, was a broken heart
