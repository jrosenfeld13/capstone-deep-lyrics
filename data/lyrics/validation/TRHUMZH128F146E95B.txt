[Verse 1]
I looked at my reflection in the water
Thought, What an unlikely pair
Closed my eyes, held my breath, plummeted down, down, down
And anchored myself there

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't tell how long I've been
In the company of gills and tails
I think I feel my skin
Growing scales

[Chorus]
Can I come up for air?
Can I come up, can I come up?
Can I come up for air?
Can I come up, can I come up?
Can I come up for air?
Can I come up, can I come up?
Can I come up for air?
Can I come up, can I come up?

[Verse 2]
I'm getting eaten up down here
I'm just not built like them
The big fish have a monopoly
The little fish get buried in the sand

[Pre-Chorus]
This here world I'm in
Sucks your life out, leaves you comatose
Take back your salt and fins
Send me a lifeboat

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I look up at longing at the surface
Hypnotized by the way the sunlight seems to ride each ripple
And they do a dance
Every ray becomes a beckoning hand
I miss the sweet taste of oxygen
I mistook this for the promised land

[Chorus]
