Every morning when I wake up
In the evening when I go to bed
Thank you Lord because he's keeping me
Safe from even things that I cannot see
He's a father, He's a brother
And His spirit is a friend of mine
And He sent me here to talk to you
He wants you to know that He loves you too

Bridge:
(Anything that you need) He's got it
(Everything that you want) You'll find it in His word
That let's you know that it can be yours
Anything you ask for
(If you know like I know) " you feel it in your soul
(If you feel it in your soul) " that empty space inside of you
Let Him fill you up
Now put your hands up " Surrender

Chorus:
If you never felt like this before
If you know He's brought you through the storm
Raise your hands up to the sky
And tell Him I surrender
If you know that day you should've died
But His mercies brought you out alright
Raise your hands up to the sky
And tell Him I surrender

Without His love I wouldn't be here
Wraps me up till I have no fear
He's been what you need all through the years
Even as a child when it wasn't in
He protects me and He keeps me
And there's nothing that I'll ever need
That He hasn't already done for me
Even as far as my eyes can see

(Bridge)

(Chorus)
When you catch yourself a back up (God'll say I miss you)
Baby boy where have you been?
(Little girl He still loves you) He hasn't changed His mind
(One guarantee He comes back, He'll be standing for you)
Till when you called His name
That night when you whispered " (I surrender)

(I surrender oh " oh) I surrender " I surrender oh oh
(I surrender oh - oh) Oh oh
Lord forgive me, I surrender

(Chorus Repeat 1x)
