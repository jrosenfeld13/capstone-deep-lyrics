Well there she goes with a
Brand new love affair
Dancin' with him like she don't even care
Well let her dance with him
Let her dance all night long
Well who would've known that just yesterday
She danced with me the very same way
Well let her dance with him
Let her dance all night long

Chorus:
Well let her dance with him all night long
Ler dance to our favorite song
Well let her dance with him let
Her dance all night long
Well I'll find me a new love
And then she'll see
Someone else will be dancing with me
Let her dance with him
Let her dance all night long
Chorus x2
