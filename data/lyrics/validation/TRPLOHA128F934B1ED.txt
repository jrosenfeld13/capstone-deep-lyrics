(Music: T Gustafsson)

Explorers in the further regions of pain
A morbid taste for the flesh
Therefore this encomium to meat
Commencing the orgy of meat and blood

Nothing eludes death
Nailed, quartered, consumed

Where screams can't be heard
Nailed to the chopping block
Brutally slaughtered like cattle
Quartered into pieces soon to be consumed

Nothing eludes death
Nailed, quartered, consumed

Slowly drained of blood and life
Shattered scraps is all that remains
Possessed by the taste of humans
Consumed by the cannibal cult

Nothing eludes death
Nailed, quartered, consumed
