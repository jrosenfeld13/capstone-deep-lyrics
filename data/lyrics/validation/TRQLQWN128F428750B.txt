Cool off your jets
No more regrets
I don't believe in you
'Cause I'm better off
I'm better off alone
And I can't believe all that I see
Did you go down on him?
And are you getting off?
Are you getting off, my friend?
I'm leaving for now
I'm leaving for now
I'm leaving for now
I'm leaving for now
And is this the way you people play?
I can't believe it's true
'Cause I'm better off
I'm better off alone
I'm leaving for now
I'm leaving for now
I'm leaving for now
I'm leaving for now
