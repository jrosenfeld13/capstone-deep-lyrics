Fear begin to turn around
I guess if everyone listens
There's no one left to fight

In your heart someone's there
I'm sixty years old
With nothing left to say

Why does it really prove
When you ? away
Seems the message is
Gotta serve the sun

Now you don't know
When to listen or just let it go
Then I don't suppose
That you chose to walk a straight road
Then you'll never know

And I don't suppose
That you chose to walk a straight road
Then you'll never know

Why does it really prove
When you ? away
Seems the message is
