In the month of June, five years ago
That's when I came to be
And though I'm not yet wordly wise
My eyes can clearly see
I love my mom and daddy too
I pray my soul to keep
And I ask for a happy home
When I lay me down to sleep

But lately mommy cries at night
She thinks that I won't hear
When daddy said my name today
He wiped away a tear
I know that something isn't right
I see it in their eyes
Oh how I wish it wasn't so
But the truth can't be denied

(Chorus)
I'm caught in the crossfire
Of a war that can't be won
Mom calls me her little man
Daddy's only son
I love them both, but I can't choose
Which one to leave behind
I'm caught in the crossfire
Of a world that's so unkind

Before you go to sleep tonight
Say a prayer for me
I'm one of the millions
From a broken family
My wish is but a simple one
My needs they are but few
The promise of a happy home
And love to see us through

(Repeat Chorus 2x)
