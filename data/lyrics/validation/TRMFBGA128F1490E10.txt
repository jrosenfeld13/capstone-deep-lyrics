All I want is to be your sunflower
To watch over you from up high
When the wind blows
I will kiss you like sunshine
Stealing pieces from a perfect sky
So here you go again
So here you go again

And they say that it really doesn't matter
Anyway
That it really doesn't matter
Anyway

I'm not asking to be more than your lover I'm not asing to be more than a friend
I'm not asking anything that I shouldn't
To bring everything we know to an end
So here you go again
So here you go again

And they say that it really doesn't matter
Anyway
That it really doesn't matter
Anyway
So here you go

And I wanted to be your lover
But your pushing me under cover
I wanted to be your lover
But you're pushing me down
Pushing me down
Under cover, yeah
Because here you go again

And they say that it really doesn't matter
Anyway
That it really doesn't matter
Anyway
And they say that it really doesn't matter
Anyway
That it really doesn't matter
Anyway
