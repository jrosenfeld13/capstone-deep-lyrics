Breathing shallow
I'm slipping away
Hanging in the gallows
I'm starting to pray

How careful it was planned
To do away with me
So kill me if you can
But words won't make me bleed

So what if I survive
And live to tell the truth
Imagine my surprise
To find me living and so very much alive

I'll find a new life and hide, if I survive
But I swear you're going down if I survive!

I'll find a new life and hide, if I survive
I'll find my own place in time, if I survive
I'll learn to forget the crime, if I survive
But I swear you're going down if I survive!

If I survive I'll tell on you
If I survive I'll tell on you
If I survive I'll tell on you
If I survive I'll tell on you
If I survive I'll tell on you
If I survive I'll tell on you
If I survive I'll tell on you
If I survive I'll tell on you
If I survive I'll tell on you
If I survive I'll tell on you
If I survive I'll tell on you
If I survive I'll tell on you
If I survive I'll tell on you
If I survive I'll tell on you

I'll find a new life and hide, if I survive
I'll find my own place in time, if I survive
I'll learn to forget the crime, if I survive
But I swear you're going down if I survive!

If I survive I'll tell on you
If I survive I'll tell on you
If I survive I'll tell on you
If I survive I'll tell on you
If I survive I'll tell on you
If I survive I'll tell on you
If I survive I'll tell on you
If I survive I'll tell on you
If I survive I'll tell on you
If I survive I'll tell on you
