I'm staying in tonight
Watching TV by myself
Cause yesterday my girlfriend wrecked my life
I don't want to explain
There's nothing I can say to you
All I got is this one note she left me

It says that she's not coming back
Not now not then next year or ever
If one more person asks me why
I'll try to lie and then

I will say
She got herself arrested
Got 10 years locked away
But that's OK
Cause the honest truth I was gonna end it anyway
I'll make up anything yeah truthfully
So no one finds out she left me

She's enrolled in the marines
I'll try and see her most weekends
But in all honesty she's never allowed leave

She says that she's not coming back
Not now not then next year or ever
If one more person asks me why
I'll try to lie and then

I will say
She got herself arrested
Got 10 years locked away
But that's OK
Cause the honest truth I was gonna end it anyway
The reasons I don't have a clue
This could easily happen to you
And then you'll know just what it's like

She says that she's not coming back
Not now not then next year or ever
If one more person asks me why
I'll try to lie and then

I will say
She got herself arrested
Got 10 years locked away
But that's OK
Cause the honest truth I was gonna end it anyway
And I could say
She did a bungee jump rope snapped she passed away
But that's OK
Cause the honest truth I was gonna end it anyway

I'll make up anything yeah truthfully
So no one finds out she left me
