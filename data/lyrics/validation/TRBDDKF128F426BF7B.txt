[Verse 1]
You go with your two feet bare
Down through the cold lane there, to Brighton
A country house, a liar and a louse live there
And go with your arms held wide
Happiness in your eyes, convincing
And stay the night, turn out every light you see
And lay them down buried in the ground for me

[Chorus 1]
Whoa, my love, whoa, my love
Whoa, my love, whoa, my love
Whoa...

[Verse 2]
The tongues of the creatures wait
Drawn to the fragile legs you walk on
A cold wind blows, Brighton to the coast for me
A cold wind blows, Brighton to the coast for me

[Chorus 2]
Whoa, my love, whoa, my love
Whoa, my love, whoa, my love
Whoa, my love, whoa, my love
Whoa, my love, whoa, my love
Whoa...
