I've never had a broken bone
I hardly ever get a cold
I keep myself in pretty good shape
But I know I wouldn't be here today

If a broken heart could kill
I'd be long gone
Ashes to ashes dust to dust by now
6 feet under
A tombstone on the hill
Lyin there alone in my new found home
If a broken heart could kill

I've run the rapids
Jumped from a plane
Been the earthquakes and hurricanes
I've climbed mountains been a rodeo clown
But after you I'm lucky I'm still around

If a broken heart could kill
I'd be long gone
Ashes to ashes dust to dust by now
6 feet under a tombstone on the hill
Lyin there alone in my new found home
If a broken heart could kill

Yeah i'd be heaven bound or on my way down
If a broken heart could kill
