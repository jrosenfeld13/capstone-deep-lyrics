I see you walking with the weight of the world
She has a family to feed
She needs a job for the bills
Is it worth it just to scratch and survive?
When the mouth that you feeds has a father alive?
Is it all a mystery?
Is it all a dream?
You better forget yesterday, tomorrow wait and see

As long as night turns to day
I'll be here, i'll be here
Just as long as you stay
I'll be here, i'll be here
I'll never push you away
I'll be here, i'll be here
Its so hard to face it
I know you'll make it with me

I see a man with his back to the wall
Who's been sleeping at night under a bridge up the road
What can he do when the people drive by?
Will they offer him change?
Won't they give him a ride?
Is it all a mystery?
Is it all a dream?
You better forget yesterday, tomorrow wait and see

As long as night turns to day
I'll be here, i'll be here
Just as long as you stay
I'll be here, i'll be here
I'll never push you away
I'll be here, i'll be here
Its so hard to face it
I know you'll make it with me

As long as night turns to day
I'll be here, i'll be here
Just as long as you stay
I'll be here, i'll be here
I'll never push you away
I'll be here, i'll be here
Just as long as you stay
I'll be here, i'll be here
I'll be here, i'll be here
I'll be here, i'll be here
I'll be here, i'll be here
I'll be here, i'll be here

I see you walking with the weight of the world
She has a family to feed
She needs a job for the bills
I see a man with his back to the wall
Who's been sleeping at night under a bridge up the road
