[Verse 1]
Hello, beautiful
How's it going?
I hear it's wonderful in California
I've been missing you
It's true

[Chorus]
But tonight, I'm gonna fly
Yeah, tonight, I'm gonna fly
'Cause I could go across the world
And see everything and never be satisfied
If I couldn't see those eyes

[Verse 2]
Hello, beautiful
It's been a long time
Since my phone's rung
And you've been on that line
I've been missing you
It's true

[Chorus]
But tonight, I'm gonna fly
Yeah, tonight, I'm gonna fly
'Cause I could go across the world
And see everything and never be satisfied
If I couldn't see those eyes
