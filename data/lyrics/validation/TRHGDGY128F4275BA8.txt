[Chorus x2]
What is it I don't remember
Made my being so much better?
If I could have
Just one pure thought

I won't be on my way
(there's nothing there)
I won't be on my way
I won't be on my way, I will help you on your way

I won't be on my way
I won't be on my way
(there's nothing there)
I will help you on your way
There is nothing more to say

So far as we've seen we've been a monsters dream
To bear arms since Nile ruptures was devile and true
And although the macarena has entirely grew
I believe you will appreciate the rest of this dream
I got some run-stamp feeling like I'm fallin on thread
I was the child in the forest with the bums and the bread
I was a train at the point where the rail road ends
Trying to load across sand while you're stealing my hands
It was a trip I wouldn't wanna take again
It is a trip I that I thought would never end
It was a trip I wouldn't wanna take again
It is a trip I that I thought would never end

[Chorus 2]
What is this feeling I can't remember
It made my being so much better
If I could have
Just one pure thought

What is it I don't remember
Made my being so much better
If I could have just one pure thought

[Chorus 2]

I won't be on my way
I won't be on my way
I won't be on my way
I won't be on my way
I won't be on my way
I won't be on my way
I will help you on your way

I won't be on my way
I won't be on my way
(there's nothing there)
I will help you on your way
I won't be on my way
I won't be on my way
(there's nothing there)
I won't be on my way
There is nothing more to say
