My kith and kin
Oh I have sinned
I didn't hear the siren
Or see him givin' in
My kith and kin
Oh I have sinned again

And he said, "London, can you wait?
For all the things I've got to say?
London, can you wait?"

My kith and kin
Oh I have sinned
The alarm rang loud
The lights were on
I didn't see a thing
My kith and kin
Death just walked in again

And he said, "London, can you wait?
For all the things that I must say?
How long can you wait?
Oh, how long?"

I was having the time of my life
So, why did you have to die?
I'm lost again
No, I was having the time of my life
So, why did you have to die?
I'm lost again

I'm lost again
I'm lost again
I am lost again
Oh, I'm lost again
I'm lost again
I am lost again
