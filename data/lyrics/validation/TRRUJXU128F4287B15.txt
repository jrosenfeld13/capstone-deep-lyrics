I come a knocking at her front door
Hard to believe that she's prettier than before
But she smiles pretty
My heart just stalls
I'm in love with a living doll

She walks and she talks
Sometimes she talks too much
She cries real tears when she's hurt by such and such
I found her tossed away by an old boy friend
He must have been a fool
She's the living end

She's not the kind that you wrap up in a pretty bow
You shouldn't leave her in the backyard rain
A living doll's got a lot of places she could go
You play it dumb
You lose her
That's a shame

Now late at night before I go to bed
I try to say my prayers
I think of her instead
I fumble for the phone
I gotta make a last call
I gotta say goodnight to my living doll
