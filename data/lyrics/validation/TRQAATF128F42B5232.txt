Girl, we can take off in the night
Girl, like two lovers. Joined in flight
You know what is best for me, it's time to let it show
Thrill me and let my body know

And I kiss you all over baby, all through the night
Kiss you all over baby, make you feel alright
Let yourself go freely girl, and we soon will reach the sky
And when I kiss you all over baby
I'll make you mine. Mine. Mine

Love. There is magic in my hand. Love
Gonna give you all I can. You know how to ride my love
You have the special way
Bless me with your touch by night and day
