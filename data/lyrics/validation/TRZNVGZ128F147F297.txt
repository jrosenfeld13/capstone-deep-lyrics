It's not my imagination
I can tell by the way you are
Something killed the passion
Don't lie, you're my shining star
Late at night I can hear
You are whispering some other guy's name
Well I know it's a sign you are mine
And I don't want it over
Lucy, you're all I need
Lucy (x2)
How can I keep on leaving
For the shadow I adore
It's the choice I've been given
To let you go with nothing more
Late at night I can hear
You are whispering some other guy's name
Well I know it's a sign you are mine
And I don't want it over
Lucy, you're all I need
Lucy...
