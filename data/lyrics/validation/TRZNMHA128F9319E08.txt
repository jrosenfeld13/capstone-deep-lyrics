[Verse 1]
I heard some seen rivers
Rivers flowed over levees at night and left dreams floating
To some man, it's hard to focus, but the waters keep going
These are the rivers
They reflect red in the daylight
We try to police them
But god told them to throw their bottle in the street so we shoot back
Through his chest out his back, his little brother sees it
Who's the terrorist?
Who say the middle east is perilous?
Whether Baghdad or Baltimore, it's the cause that effects the cause
I watch from the shores of the river [?]
I hope that the water will take me in peace
Instead of bloodshed in the streets, it's a wonder what the future will be
By the river

[Chorus]
By the river
By the river
As years past and times have changed the river seemed to stay the same
As I sit and watch the water flow by, hoping words they could do the same
I mean along time away from now, will these folks even know our name?
If we free in the truth in words then they hold on forever the same
As the rivers

[Verse 2]
See there's things in the river, can't sip 'cause the chemicals
Johnny got cancer and momma wanted answers
Senators ducked and they lobby for the dumping
See they all smile 'til a nigga say something
Then it's like, "call my office"
They only seem to take action when they start talking
About the rivers, elephant, and darkie
Ninety percent of the folks is clearly retarded
To their children that's dearly departed
Then they shift like Peyton Manning, calling out audibles
Breaking promised made during inaugural speeches
To each his own, it's never me, Kay
I hope to get like water and adapt to the terrain and times
Lay claim to the future, with these words I produce
I hope they flow on for years like the rivers

[Chorus]
By the river
By the river
As years past and times have changed the river seemed to stay the same
As i sit and watch the water flow by, hoping words they could do the same
I mean along time away from now, will these folks even know our name?
If we free in the truth in words, then they hold on forever the same
As the rivers

[Outro]
If we free in the truth in words, then they hold on forever the same
As the rivers
