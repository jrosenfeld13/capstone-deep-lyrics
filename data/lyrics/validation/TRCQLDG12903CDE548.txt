[Intro: Bob Marley & The Wailers]
Try me, (try me) x4

[Hook: Bob Marley & The Wailers]
Try me, (try me, try me)
Try me, (a wah wah wow)
Try me, (try me, try me)
Try me, (a wah wah wow)

[Verse 1: Bob Marley]
When the hurt is strong
And everything you do is wrong
You need someone to comfort you
Well listen, baby
I'll come first to you, so

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bob Marley]
If you need satisfaction
Listen, baby
I've got the action
Where I am
That's where it's at
So listen, baby
It's tit for tat, so

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Woo, woo-ooh, woo, woo, woo-ooh x4

[Verse 3: Bob Marley]
One more thing I'd like to say right here
Try me, (try me, try me)
One more thing I'd like to say right here
Try me, (try me, try me)

[Outro]
Need good lovin'
I'm black, (try me) coming
Yes I'm black, (try me) and I'm coming
Try me, (try me)
