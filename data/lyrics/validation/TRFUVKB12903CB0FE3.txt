[Intro]
(Oh no)

[Verse 1]
As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She was sitting at the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down
It was her doom

[Break]
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?

[Chorus]
Annie, are you OK
Will you tell us that you're OK
There's a sign at the window
That he struck you
A crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
Then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

[Break]
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?

You've been hit by, you've been struck by a smooth criminal

[Verse 2]
So they came into the outway
It was Sunday, but a black day
I could make a salutation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidation

[Break]
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?

[Chorus]
Annie, are you OK
Will you tell us that you're OK
There's a sign at the window
That he struck you
A crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
Then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
You've been hit by, you've been struck by a smooth criminal

[Short Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Annie, are you OK (oh no)
Will you tell us that you're OK (oh no)
There's a sign at the window (oh no)
That he struck you (oh no)
A crescendo, Annie (oh no)
He came into your apartment (oh no)
He left the bloodstains on the carpet (oh no)
Then you ran into the bedroom (oh no)
You were struck down
It was your doom

[Break]
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
