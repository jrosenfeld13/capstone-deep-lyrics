Me and my friend are walking to a bar on a cool winters evening underneath the stars
We'll find somewhere close we don't want to walk far
Nor do we want the hassle of a car
I'll order whisky and they'll order beer
The gourmet selection's intimidating here and sometimes what you know is the best way to steer
I say this ones my shout and my friend says cheers
This is some new joint that we've never been
Two lovers are fighting and making a scene
Some guy's setting up a karaoke machine
Let's find somewhere different where the carpet ain't clean

Me and my friend are walking to a bar on a cool winters evening underneath the stars
And we'll find somewhere new we don't want to walk far nor waste drinking money on a taxi car
My friends addicted to their mobile phone and they're constantly messaging someone back home with some inner fear of being alone
So for a short while my thoughts are my own
Walking round the corner a pub is in sight
Up there on the left just past those lights
We've been there before yeah that place is alright
Let's pull up a stool and settle in for the night
I love my friends I hope they love me too cos sometimes there is nothing better to do
Than to go out and get stuck in to a few
I'm gonna spend my time with a good friend like you
