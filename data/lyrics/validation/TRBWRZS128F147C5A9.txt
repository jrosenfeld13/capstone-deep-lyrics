I'm not ashamed to tell the whole world, no
Without you I'm nothing at all
And I have strings in need of mending, oh
I'm out of tune in certain parts
And strum the cords of mercy
Restore my soul completely
And breathe new life upon me
And this instrument will sing

Cho
Your the music of my heart
(yea yea yea yea)
The melody within my soul
(yea yea yea yea)
The song that holds me in the dark
(yea yea yea yea)
The fire that warms me when I'm cold
(yea yea yea yea)
The smphony that calms my fears
(Yea yea yea yea)
The lyric that I long to hear
(Yea yea yea yea)
Masterpiece the work of art
Complete before I start
The music of my Heart

Creator of all that's lovely Oh
Write a tune upon my heart
And when your finished will you play me
Like a beautiful guitar
And strum the cords of mercy
Restore my soul completely
And breathe new life upon me
And this instrument will sing
