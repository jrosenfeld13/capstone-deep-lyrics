[Verse 1]
Anthony works in the grocery store
Savin' his pennies for someday
Mama Leone left a note on the door
She said "Sonny, move out to the country"
Workin' too hard can give you
A heart attack
You oughta know by now
Who needs a house out in Hackensack
Is that all you get for your money

[Chorus]
And it seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
Mama, if that's movin' up then I'm movin' out

[Verse 2]
Sergeant O'Leary is walkin' the beat
At night he becomes a bartender
He works at Mr. Cacciatore's down on Sullivan Street
Across from the medical center
Yeah and he's tradin' in his Chevy for a Cadillac
You oughta know by now
And if he can't drive with a broken back
At least he can polish the fenders

[Chorus]
And it seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
Mama, if that's movin' up then I'm movin' out

[Verse 3]
You should never argue with a crazy mind
You oughta know by now
You can pay Uncle Sam with the overtime
Is that all you get for your money

[Chorus 2]
And if that's what you have in mind
Yeah, if that's what you're all about
Good luck movin' up cause I'm movin' out
