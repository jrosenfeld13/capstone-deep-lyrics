He stood like a statue
As he was beaten across the face
With a horsewhip
Where the wounds already exist
A well-oiled rifle
Never lonely, Marlon J.D
If you want to come down, come down
Give him some dignity

So say, so say Marlon J.D
So say, so say Marlon J.D

Learn to live without clutter
To live without luxury
Sometimes I envy them
Goodnight yourself, Marlon J.D
He did not defend himself
He didn't even raise his hand
I will not beg because
This is how I am

So say, so say Marlon J.D
So say, so say Marlon J.D
So say, so say Marlon J.D

Bare floors, plain white walls. No window curtains, nothing but essentials. With no luxuries, no ornamentation. Utter simplicity. But it's also clean, it's clean as a rifle

So say, so say Marlon J.D
So say, so say Marlon J.D
So say, so say Marlon J.D
So say, so say

And, and they're never lonely. And sometimes I envy them
