Listen up, Whoa, Take warning
Stand by your friends, wrong or right
Can't call that justice if its just a stupid excuse to fight
Single out and attack the ones who got no defense
You call that a new way of thinking i call it regression to ignorance
Take warning
Theres a new generation coming
And we really gotta stand up to them
No ones got a thing against you
What youve got something to prove
We dont need no set of standards
We dont need a new set of rules
Man,heard all that s*** before
About stomping out any difference
We say stand together!
(not to fight just to exist)
Take warning
Intimidation coming
And we really gotta say no to them
Enough is enough is enough
Why dont you just ease up
I saw another beat down last nite take warning
Who's the next to hit the ground tonite take warning
