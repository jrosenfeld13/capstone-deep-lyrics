Believe that there will be a brighter day

Situations tend to weigh us down
And its easy to let 'em steal your joy away its always when you are the closest
To almost getting through change seems far away

Everyday we live there's problems all around
Things you can't brace yourself for
And tomorrows another day
I know that it ain't easy
To smile and hide the pain
Oh, I've been there before
So I'm telling you

[Chorus:]
When you've had enough you wanna give up
You gotta believe that there will be a brighter day
Seems you can't go on just stay strong you gotta just believe
That there will be a brighter day

There are time when you can't take no more seems like every door's locked
And can't be opened the doubts of dreams ever coming true can discourage you
But you need to see that

Everyday we live there's problems all around
Things you can't brace yourself for
I know that it ain't easy
To smile and hide the pain
Oh, I've been there before
So I'm telling you

[Chorus]

Goals are nearer, things are clever now you finally see
It's gonna make you wanna say
All my problems they've been solved and days look brighter to me

[Chorus x3]
Until end then fade...
