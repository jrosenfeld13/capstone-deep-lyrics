Only came outside to watch the night fall with the rain
I heard you making patterns rhyme
Like some new romantic looking for the tv sound
You'll see I'm right some other time

Look now, look all around, there's no sign of life
Voices, another sound, can you hear me now?
This is Planet Earth, you're looking at Planet Earth
Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop this is Planet Parth

My head is stuck on something precious
Let me know if you're coming down to land
Is there anybody out there trying to get through?
My eyes are so cloudy I can't see you

Look now, look all around, there's no sign of life
Voices, another sound, can you hear me now?
Is is Planet Earth, you're looking at Planet Earth

Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop
This is Planet Earth
Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop
This calling Planet Earth
Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop
This looking at Planet Earth
Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop
This is Planet Earth
