Shouting out loud, a woman alone
A man with fears outside at night
Singing alone what's due to him
What can I say?

What can I say? What do I feel?
You're always away
Can't fall asleep, you keep me awake
Come to me

The day is long, I walk along
The path is wet, come to me
Cars don't stop, a scar is open
I make mistakes, take me home

What will you do?
When I lie down and look around
And see the walls
Or find a cloud or stare alone

What will you do?
What shall I say?
When they've all gone
