Do you feel over unsatisfied
Are you caught up in the charades and tears
Of your troubled life
It's just the choices all amount
Fate wrestles luckAnd we stand there screaming
Let me out
Let me out

I hold my love close to my heart
We don't let them tear us apart

We keep it simple
We take it easy
You say you need me
But I need you more

Hate filters common sense
We run to ground
They sit and laugh at our expense
It just dilutes wastes and corrupts
We count our blessings
They argue over what it's worth
For what it's worth

I hold my love close to my heart
We don't let them tear us apart

Hate filters common sense

We keep it simple
We take it easy
You say you need me
But I need you more

We keep it simple
We take it easy
You say you need me
But I need you more
