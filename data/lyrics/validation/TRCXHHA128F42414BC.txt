Spreading terrorism through the music
Rebelling against all this bullshit
Fire is the heat that burns deep inside
Raging and out of control

Spreading terrorism through the music
Rebelling against all this shit
Energy in the purest form
Controlled chaos, bring it on...

Confront and destroy / Confront and destroy
Confront and destroy / Confront and destroy

Spreading terrorism through the music
Rebelling against all this bullshit
Urban guerillas on the front line
Arm in arms, bring it on...

Confront and destroy / Confront and destroy
Confront and destroy / Confront and destroy

Rise, rise, rise
Above this bullshit
Rise, rise, rise
Above this bullshit

"Night will come and I will follow
For my victims no tomorrow"
"Non-conformity in my inner self
Only I guide my inner self"

Bring da pain to tha muthafuckin' pit - Kill
Bring da rage to tha muthafuckin' pit - Kill
Bring da shit to tha muthafuckin' pit - Kill
Bring da pain to tha muthafuckin' pit - Kill...
