Fallout Boy
TAKE THIS TO YOUR GRAVE
Grand Theft Autumn (Where is Your Boy)
Where is your boy tonight? I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know: you were the last good thing about this part of town

When I wake up
I'm willing to take my chances on the hope you hate him more than you notice I wrote this for you
You need him. I could be him...
I could be an accident but I'm still trying
That's more than I can say for him
Where is your boy tonight? I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know: you were the last good thing about this part of town
Someday I'll appreciate in value, get off my ass and call you... but for the meantime I'll sport my brand new fashion of waking up with pants on at 4: 00 in the afternoon

Where is your boy tonight? I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know: you were the last good thing about this part of town
