Smile and the air lights up about you
Around you
A million jewels in the champagne sky
You smile and the clouds lift you skyward
And higher
A feather suspended floating through the air
Imagine now
The stellar orchestra smiles
Because a while you're noticing
Imagine now
Intense and gently
You're bound to see
Where some might say there's nothing there
Smile at the world and it surrenders
Whistling tunes
At once strange and musical
Imagine now
Forever
You're bound to see
Where some might say there's nothing there
