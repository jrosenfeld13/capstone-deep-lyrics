If time itself was his demeanor
There'd be no sunlight or a glimmer
Of sunlight landing on the street
Sunsuit girls must be discreet
Sunsuit girls must be discreet
Nursing their fathers locked inside
They masqueraded as his bride

I might like you better if we slept together
I might like you better if we slept together
I might like you better if we slept together
But there's something in your eyes that says maybe...
That's never
Never say never

Slumped by the courthouse
With windburn skin
That man could give a fuck
About the grin on your face
As you walk by, randy as a goat
He's sleeping on papers
But he'd be warm in your coat

I might like you better if we slept together
I might like you better if we slept together
I might like you better if we slept together
But there's something in your eyes that says maybe...
That's never
Never say never

There's no easy way
To lose your sight
On the street, on the stairs
Who's on your flight
Old couple walks by
As ugly as sin
But he's got her
And she's got him

I might like you better if we slept together
I might like you better if we slept together
I might like you better if we slept together
But there's something in your eyes that says maybe...
That's never
Never say never

Sunsuit girls must be discreet
Nursing their fathers locked inside
They masqueraded as his bride
Never say never
Never say never
Never say never
Never, never

Sun seems to move
Across the sky so slow
It's us who's turning
With nowhere to go
Sun seems to move
Across the sky so slow
Us who's turning
With nowhere... go

Never say never
Never say never
Never say never say never say never
Never, never
Never say never

I might like you better if we slept together
I might like you better if we slept together
I might like you better if we slept together
I might like you better if we slept together
I might like you better if we slept together
But there's something in your eyes that says maybe...
That's never
Never say never
