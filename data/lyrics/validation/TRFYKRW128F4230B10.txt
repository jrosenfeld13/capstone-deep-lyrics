[Verse 1]
Jenny said, when she was just five years old
There was nothing happening at all
Every time she put on the radio
There was nothing going on at all

Then, one fine morning, she put on a New York station
She didn't believe what she heard at all
She started shaking to that fine, fine music
You know, her life was saved by rock'n'roll

[Chorus]
It took the computation
To dance to a rock'n'roll station
It was all right, babe
Now it was all right

[Verse 2]
Jenny said, when she was just five years old
You know her parents will be the death of us all
Two TV sets and two Cadillac cars
Well, you know, babe, it's not gonna help us at all

Then, one fine morning, she put on a New York station
She didn't believe, babe, what she heard at all
She started shaking to that fine, fine music
You know, her life was saved by rock'n'roll

[Chorus]
Despite all the amputation
She could dance to a rock'n'roll station
And it was all right, hey, babe
Now it was all right

Here she comes now!

[Verse 3]
Jenny said, when she was just five years old
There's nothing happening at all
Every time she put on the radio
There's nothing going down at all

Then, one fine morning, she put on a New York station
She didn't believe what she heard at all
Oh, she started dancing to that fine, fine music
You know, her life was saved by rock'n'roll

[Chorus]
It took the computations
To dance to the rock'n'roll station

[Outro]
It was all right
It was all right
It was all right
It was all right
All right
All right
All right
All right
All right
All right
All right
All right
All right
All right
All right
