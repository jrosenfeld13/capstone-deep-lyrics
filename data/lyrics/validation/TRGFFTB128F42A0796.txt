On the day you were born
The sun filled my eyes
I fell within the wars that rise

What were you here for?
What will you find?
Could I save your life, like you saved mine?

[Chorus]
Wait until the morning comes around
Wait for something beautiful
Wait to see if worry turns around
Wait, please wait

I tried to keep you from
Everything that was
So difficult for me

But it makes you strong
When you hurt so long
I'll put it all in faith that you won't leave

[Chorus]
And I'll wait until the morning comes around
Wait for something beautiful
Wait to see if worry turns around
Wait, I'll wait

Looking up now you see that
Everyone seems so happy
The crooked somehow keep breathing
When you couldn't be so happy

Maybe they just don't know
Maybe we just don't know
Maybe we just don't know

So I'll wake every morning
Wake with the sun
Were the worst things always
The first things to come?
Find a way to move on and a way to be strong
Because some things do change

Some things come that make
The worst things beautiful

[Chorus]
Wait until the morning comes around
Wait for something beautiful
Wait to see if worry turns around

Wait...
