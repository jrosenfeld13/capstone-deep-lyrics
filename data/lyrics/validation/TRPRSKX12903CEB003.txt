I can't wait to find out the way
We learn the way we get things done
Compared romantic carnage
Makes the devil take your tongue
For a ride around this town

And I'll sever these cryptic ties
And my sleight of hand reties this friendship band
And command those neon lights to
To spell a new name for Ireland
And tame the trouble in this place
It gets late and it gets light
The city blinks and blinds
And fails to ruin everything

Drew a line from your street to mine
And in time I got to know
The route so well I could walk
With my eyes closed and closed and closed
In the shadows of a Friday night
I walked into a brand new streetlight
Relieved to be walking
On my own, my own, my own

Everyeveryeverything

And so I severed these cryptic ties
And my sleight of hand retied most friendship bands
And commanded those neon lights to
To spell a new name for Ireland
And tame the trouble in this place
It gets late and it gets light
And we're fools with heavy eyes
If we hadn't stayed up past our bedtime
We'd miss the city blink and blind
You see buildings slip and slide
Like a flower blooming in fast-forward
And we find out the way
The way we get things done
Take care not to take our chances
It gets late and it gets light
And we're fools with heavy eyes
We mapped out to ruin everything
