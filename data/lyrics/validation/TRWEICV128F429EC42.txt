What's up is he alright?
Smiling wide
Ever up and ever overpsyched
On every single count he won
Scott tried to let him know
On the phone
I (rung?) out to take the overflow
It didn't matter he won

Said I learned
From my sunburn
No misunderstanding

?
It's over now
Until you wore the (pride?) you won
