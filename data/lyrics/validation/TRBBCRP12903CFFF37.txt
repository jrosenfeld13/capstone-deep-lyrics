I been watching, you been watching me
(Baby, through the night)
And if destiny was meant to be
(Then I'm gonna hold you tight)

Oh, watching, you been watching me
(So baby, it's alright)
I wanna wine and dine and set you free
(Under candle light)

Night and day, yuh, body sway and your smile
Wanna be, wanna say, "You fit my profile"
'Cause that's the way true playas play
I got nothing to hide, so right now baby
I wanna feel your bonafide

I need you, lady right here with me
To satisfy my fantasy
Been waiting for so long for someone like you
Your finesse justs keep me going through the other [unverified]

I been watching, you been watching me
(Baby, through the night)
And if destiny was meant to be
(Then I'm gonna hold you tight)

Oh, watching, you been watching me
(So baby, it's alright)
I wanna wine and dine and set you free
(Under candle light)

This place is crowded, yet we're all alone
Your energy, I'm feeling from the lovers [Unverified]
My desires like fire, gotta leave this room
Its like deja vu all over smelling your perfume

Gotta say, right away, need you now
Don't ignore, this chemistry
Some way some how dola vu, suku shay
Avec moi, sevo play, are you ready, baby, oh yeah

I been watching, you been watching me
(Baby, through the night)
And if destiny was meant to be
(Then I'm gonna hold you tight)

Oh, watching, you been watching me

I wanna wine and dine and set you free
