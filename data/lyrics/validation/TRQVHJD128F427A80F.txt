Girl don't be sad
You know what you're not missing
No reason to feel bad
He don't mean much with his kissing

You going to make it through
You have always been surviving
I've got faith in you
And I know you'll get it going

But you can't go back
To what it never was
To repossess, what you never owned
But you can't go back
To what it never was
This is that time, this is that time
When you're better off alone

Girl don't you see
There's nothing more to see there
You've got a friend in me
And I will always be here

And you know it won't be long
Until it's all behind you
You will meet someone
Someone's bound to find you

But you can't go back
To what it never was
To repossess, what you never owned
But you can't go back
To what it never was
This is that time, this is that time
When you're better off alone

Even alone at night
You will be alright
You're so strong -- you will get over him
And there will be times
That I'll expect these lines
Not to comfort -- but remind you

That you can't go back
To what it never was
To repossess, what you never owned
No you can't go back
To what it never was
This is that time, this is that time
When you're better off alone
