You're the woman who made me a man
I was down you taught me to stand

I was made up of nothing
You put something inside
You opened my chest
And put that hurt in my eyes
Now I've got that pain I can turn to
When I wonder if I'm still alive

I was made up of nothing
You put your hands on my heart
Stained your fingers inside me
And you took me apart

You're the woman who made me who I am
Everything I've got I got from you
