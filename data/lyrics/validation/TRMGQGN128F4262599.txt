You should see how ignorant you are being
You wouldn't know the first thing about me
Right on command
Sound of fire
You assume I'm stupid, and I've wandered off alone
I'm no threat to myself, or you in your wheel chair
For every inch, there's amile
Limits and lines is a matter of pride
"Where we are now" and where we "want to be," the difference is unsettling
