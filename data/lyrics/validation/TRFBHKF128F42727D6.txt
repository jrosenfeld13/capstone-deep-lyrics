[Chorus 1]
Don't live in the past
Don't hold on to something that's changing fast
What we are, is what we are and what we wear
Is vintage clothes, vintage clothes

[Verse]
We jump up for joy
Who cares if we look like a girl or boy
What we are, is what we are and what we wear
Is vintage clothes, vintage clothes

[Chorus 2]
A little more, a little tall
Check the rack
What went out, is coming back

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
