Blinded eyes, crash course with reality
Subconscious lie, who did they really kill?
Shattered hope, a slave to his master
He starts thirsting for, the things he may never near

The falling tears, falling from your sorrow
You wonder why, they'll rip you all to shreds
Bomb the poor, if that's what living means to thee
They realize, that religion wants them dead

Imagine their emotion, for someone's need to kill
For some other religion but yours
It's just the death of your religion that makes you cry
It's just your own bitter loss

You

Blinded eyes, no more consolation
Subconscious lie, won't set you free
Your falling tears, our own extinction
Abandon stories, now everything can be seen

Your living out this lie, and the rest of you are blind
Can't you fucking see?, subverted with a lie

Imagine their emotion, for someone's need to kill
For some other religion but yours
It's just the death of your religion that makes you cry
It's just your own bitter loss

It's just your own bitter loss
It's just your own bitter loss
It's just your own bitter loss
