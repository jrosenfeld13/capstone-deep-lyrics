I had a fortress all pristine and blue
And the doorways were painted in red
And each tiny window reflections of you
And the only way out was my head
Can you imagine my misunderstanding I relied on relics and tombs
And no one said nothing till we saw your face on the news

I can make mountains where nothing there stands
And I can make many ado
Every stone is a missed altercation
Still every height is a view
I've stood in protest thorns against roses I don't mind intentions are true
And no one said nothing till we saw your face on the news

I had it all figured out
I was right and they were wrong
I looked for the difference
And I found the difference was gone

Over the decades and between the lines
Nothing has left me alone
I know the time passes grows up and trespasses
And we've all got fears of our own
No need to ration a source of compassion and anything less I refuse
'Cause no one said nothing till we saw your face on the news
