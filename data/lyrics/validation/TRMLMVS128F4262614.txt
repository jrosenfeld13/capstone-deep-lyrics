I was back and forth
From armed to desperate
Lost to fully aware
How was your weekend?

You get your time alone?
It used to sound so peaceful
Now it's panic-ridden
How was your weekend?

I'm alright for now, but I haven't been
I got lots of shit behind me
Alright for now

I'll talk while I can
But it hasn't been that easy
It's simple talk at best
Like "how was your weekend?"

I'm alright for now, but I haven't been
I got lots of shit behind me
Alright for now

When I went away
I made no decisions
I couldn't trust them to me
I was too weak then

I'm alright for now, but I haven't been
I got lots of shit behind me
Alright for now, but I haven't been

I'm alright for now, but I haven't been
I got lots of shit behind me
Alright for now
