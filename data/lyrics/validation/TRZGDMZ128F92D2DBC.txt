I defy, I love your way
How could it be different?
I defy, I love your way
How could it be different

Now I'm kissing the real you
Now I'm kissing the real you

Will I get through my dark day?
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

Ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh
How could it be different?

I see the stars around your face
They never seem to hurt at all
The stars around your face
They never seem to hurt at all

Now I'm missing the real you
Now I'm missing the real you

Well, I got through my dark day
Did you fear me?
Did you fear for me?

Ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh
How could it be different?

I don't want to see my baby fall
It's the dawn I feel becoming ever after
This is my matter, dear

I defy I love your way
Well, how could it be different?
I defy, I love your way
How could it be different?

Well I got to know you today
And I adore you
I adore you

Oh, now I'm loving you
Oh, now I'm loving you
How could it be different?

Oh now I'm loving you
Oh now I'm loving you
How could it be different?
