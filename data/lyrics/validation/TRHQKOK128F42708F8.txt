Save me
Free me from my heart this time
The train's gone
Down the track and I've stayed behind

But nothing can free me
From this ball and chain
I've made up my mind
I would leave today

But you're keepin'
Me goin'
I know it's insane
Because I love you
And lose again

When the heart calls
The mind obeys
Oh it knows better than me, baby
If I hold on
For one more day
Oh maybe, maybe he'll be true

And nothing can free me
From this ball and chain
I've made up my mind
I would leave today
But you're keepin'
Me goin'
I know it's insane
Because I love you and lose again
