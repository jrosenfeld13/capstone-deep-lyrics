[Intro]
We are living in a serious time
What a dangerous time
Wow
Ninja!
Don't let the devil blow your mind
Do you hear I and I, black people?

[Chorus: Admiral Tibet]
The time is so serious, cantankerous and dangerous (dangerous, danger)
Is only in the Father, you know I put my trust ('Cause mi nuh trust mankind)
The time is so serious, cantankerous and dangerous (Wha' really a gwan now, Tibet?)
All over the world everyone is in a heated rush

[Verse 1: Shabba Ranks]
Inna a heated rush
Yes, it hard but you haffi take it with tender touch
Each and every ghetto youth waan get big up
If you waan get big up and if you waan fi live up
Read your Bible and think 'bout God nuff
Think 'bout God and then you get God up
If it's Shabba, mi know say that me nuh cruff
Chat pon the riddim and born as a cruff
Tell the world say a mi a hot stuff

[Chorus: Admiral Tibet]
The time is so serious, cantankerous and dangerous
(The same thing again man. Make them nuh look man?)
Is only in the Father, you know I put my trust
(God alone man, the salvation last forever)
The time is so serious, cantankerous and dangerous (Mhmm)
All over the world everyone is in a heated rush (Mi look man and mi see, wha' mi see?)

[Verse 2: Ninjaman]
Revelation a reveal, and it a open to the people dem

[Chorus]
The time is so serious, cantankerous and dangerous
Is only in the Father, you know I put my trust
The time is so serious, cantankerous and dangerous
All over the world everyone is in a heated rush

[Verse 3: Shabba Ranks]
Inna a heated rush
Better day, no matter wha' the world waan say
Better day, just hope and pray for a better day
Better day, go tell them say, "we dance to Reggae"
Better day, tell dem, dem haffi hope and pray
Better day, nah come your way

Without the Bible each and every day
Almighty Jah stand up and a

[Verse 4: Admiral Tibet]
It's not everything good fi hear good fi talk
I don't trust no shadow after dark
They will walk and talk, eat and drink with you
Pretend as if they are with you
But I won't let no one harm me
And I won't try to harm anyone
But when you think it's peace and safety
It's a sudden destruction

[Chorus]
The time is so serious, cantankerous and dangerous
Is only in the Father, you know I put my trust
The time is so serious, cantankerous and dangerous
All over the world everyone is in a heated rush
