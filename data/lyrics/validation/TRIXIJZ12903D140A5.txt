[Verse 1]
We read the signs completely backwards
No one could see if we ended up where we needed to be
To find out how it all works with so many partners
And nobody wants nobody wants, nobody wants to sit behind the wheel
Behind the wheel

Whose the one pounding the gears avoiding the crowds
Keeping their ear to the ground?
Oh I've made a mistake
I never learned how to get back to the place
Oh...

[Chorus]
Where have all the signs gone?
I don't know where I am without them
Where have all the signs gone?
I don't know where I am

[Verse 2]
We made designs completely backwards
Nobody knows if were even close to where we need to go
To find out how it all works with so many artists
And nobody wants, nobody wants to sit behind the wheel
Behind the wheel

Whose the one pounding the gears avoiding the crowds
Keeping their ear to the ground?
Oh I've made a mistake I never learned how to get back to the place
Where all our confidence kept is behind a shield
Only light can get through
Where all our confidence kept is behind a shield
Only light can get through

[Chorus]
Where have all the signs gone?
I don't know where I am without them
Where have all the signs gone?
I don't know where I am
