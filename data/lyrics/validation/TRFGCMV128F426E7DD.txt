I met a devil woman
She took my heart away
She said I had it comin' to me
But I wanted it that way
I think that any love is good lovin'
And so I took what I could get
Ooh, ooh she looked at me with big brown eyes
And said
You ain't seen nothin' yet
B-B-B-Baby you just ain't seen nothin' yet
Here's something that you never gonna forget
B-B-B-Baby you just ain't seen nothin' yet
And now I'm feelin' better
'Cause I found out for sure
She took me to her doctor
And he told me of a cure
He said that any love is good love
So I took what I could get
Ooh, ooh she looked at me with big brown eyes
And said
You ain't seen nothin' yet
B-B-B-Baby you just ain't seen nothin' yet
Here's something that you never gonna forget
B-B-B-Baby you just ain't seen nothin' yet
Any love is good love
So I took what I could get
Ooh, ooh she looked at me with big brown eyes
And said
You ain't seen nothin' yet
B-B-B-Baby you just ain't seen nothin' yet
Here's something that you never gonna forget
B-B-B-Baby you just ain't seen nothin' yet
