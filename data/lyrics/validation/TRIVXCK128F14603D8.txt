I'm not reaching you
Everything you do
Leads to my disgrace
Show me your face

I can see myself inside of you
I can see myself inside of you

What's beneath the flesh
Hate you can't express
I can trick myself
Like everybody else..

I can see myself inside of you
I can see myself inside of you

Look inside my head
Imbedded with the knowledge
Deep within my skin
That I will never know where to begin
You image is above me
Far beyond my reach
I stand alone and wait for you to teach

I'm obessed with everything you do
I won't stop until you say its through
I can see myself inside of you
I can see myself inside of you
