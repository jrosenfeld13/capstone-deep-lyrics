Enslaved by your beauty
Enslaved by your touch
Enslaved by this feeling
That tempts me too much

So pick your poison
And choose your passions price
Forever drowning
In these endless escapes

So let go and fly
As we let go and die

When you love the one you hate
That Sadist is your soulmate

Trapped in this torture
Used to these tears
Forever are our games
The dramas all the same

Hiding a double life
You deny your death

So let go and fly
As we let go and die

When you love the one you hate
That Sadist is your soulmate
