[Verse 1]
Inside me, inside me is a flame
That burned brighter anytime you came
Gets in the way when I'm alone with you
But disappears if I'm with someone new

[Verse 2]
It learnt how to fit into my foreplay
With my skills our love was going okay
Until the night when we were on the phone
You're moving on what better

[Verse 1]
