Long time ago...
We went down to Mexico
And so we stayed
And so we prayed
Under the sun
We were bound to have some fun
But then it rained
Oh it rained
All I'd wanted was some time alone
With my arm around you my dear
But it was only a state of mind, you see
And the people
In the mountain
Singing...
When we were sad...
We walked down the only path
til our feet were in the sand
Through ocean breeze
The sun was only there to tease
cause then it rained
Oh it rained
All I'd wanted, was some time alone
With my heart here for you and for me
But it was only a state of mind, you see
And the people
Of the ocean
Singing...
