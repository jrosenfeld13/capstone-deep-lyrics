We don?t need to shed a tear
'Cause it's too late for us to cry
If we had've known what we had goin' on
We never would?ve let this feeling die

We let a love vibration pass us by
We let a love vibration pass us by

I can still recall the feeling
Boy you made me feel so good inside
Because we both had been used by love before
We've got this feeling we had to hide

We let a love vibration pass us by
We let a love vibration pass us by

Neither one of us
Played the game by the rules
I was too busy being tough
And you were too busy being cool
(Cool)

Next time around I?ll be ready
If the feeling ever comes again
I won?t be a fool, I?ll play the game by the rules
I won?t let this feeling get away from me again

We let a love vibration pass us by
We let a love vibration pass us by

We let a love vibration pass us by
We let a love vibration pass us by
