Awake on my airplane
Awake on my airplane
My skin is bare
My skin is theirs
Awake on my airplane
Awake on my airplane
My skin is bare
My skin is theirs

I feel like a newborn
And I feel like a newborn

Awake on my airplane
Awake on my airplane
I feel so real

Could you wanna take my picture?
'Cause I won't remember
Could you wanna take my picture?
'Cause I won't remember
Yeah

I don't believe in
I don't believe in
Your sanctity
Your privacy
I don't believe in
I don't believe in
Sanctity
A hypocrisy

Could everyone agree that
No one should be left alone?
Could everyone agree that
They should not be left alone? Yeah

And I feel like a newborn
And I feel like a newborn
Kicking and screaming

Could you wanna take my picture?
'Cause I won't remember
Could you wanna take my picture?
'Cause I won't remember
Yeah

Hey, Dad, what do you think about your son now?
Ah, hey, Dad, what do you think about your son now?

Could you wanna take my picture?
'Cause I won't remember
Could you wanna take my picture?
'Cause I won't remember
Could you wanna take my picture?
'Cause I won't remember
Yeah
