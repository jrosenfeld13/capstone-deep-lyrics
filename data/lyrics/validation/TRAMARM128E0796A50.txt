[Verse 1]
You couldn't break me in the end... (oh no
And such a freedom I enjoy
When you're deaf to the sounds you trust
If that was all you've got, my friend... (oh no
Then set yourself to disappoint
Feels like I'm strapped down on this table... so tight
You've got me stuck to a razor's edge
And I'm trapped in a deadbolt glove
You stand to cut me or enable... oh no
And such a streak starts steading heads
And I live for the things I love

[Chorus 1]
Sad, but maybe it's true
Push you back's what I'll do
And it's just enough
To keep you back one second longer

[Chorus 2]
Take a little more than what I've got
It's all I have to please you
Break a little piece of what you want
Bite back the hand that feeds you

[Verse 2]
Remember when things seem so stable... you know that
I compromise just to appease
Yeah, you take but you take too much
If what you need's not seeming able... yeah, right
Then maybe it works when I leave
Yeah, you fake what you say you love

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2][x2]

[Verse 3]
Move faster
I can't move enough
How much longer?
Is this long enough?
We can't be
And it won't even catch your attention
And it pains me so to mention

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2][x4]
