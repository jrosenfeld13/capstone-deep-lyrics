Tonight
I'm in love with all the lovers
With their loose hips and pouty lips
And just for tonight
We'll forget all those sad songs
'cause I know in my heart it's gonna be alright
Yeah, in my heart we're gonna be alright, alright

And those dark places
Where no one belongs
Have been shattered and thrown to the wolves
And the flowers might've gone out with the trash
But we still got some time
And we all shine some light

So tonight's
For the hunters and the hunted
And the wild and the hoods and the thieves
We may be restless
But lord
Lord we are willing
Please don't let us be misunderstood

For those hard times have already blown
So listen
I ain't living no long lonesome nights
I've stopped calling that woman my wife
I see light at the end of this storm leading home
And I thank you
And I thank you
Yes, I thank you

There's a darkness
That stalks all our footsteps
Of those who've been burnt, worn out and frayed
But with madness
There must come fulfillment
As we dance and kick this night away

Yeah, tonight
I'm in love with all the strangers
Him and her
Hand in hand
Side by side
Yeah, just for tonight we'll pretend that no one
Ever died walking those long lonely strides
Yeah, ever died walking those long lonely strides

So celebrate
We are lovers and we are fighters
Celebrate
To live one more round
Celebrate
All your friends and your fuckers
Cause I know in my heart we're gonna be alright

I ain't living no long lonesome nights
I've stopped calling that woman my wife
I see light at the end of this storm leading home
And I thank you
And I thank you
Yes, I thank you
