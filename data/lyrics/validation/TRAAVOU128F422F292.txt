[Verse 1]
This was my fate, giving in
To your lips, to your eyes
I should have known
It would come back to haunt me
Crooked smile, a reflection in your eyes
That shows my weakness for
Beautiful mistakes
Something that I know you've seen before
I'm not the first
Set the trap, I'm falling for it every time

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't believe
Everyone knew from the start
This would come back to haunt me
I can't stand to see you now
How could I ever trust you?

[Chorus]
Ill take it back to the streets
I'll start again
I'll never look back
I'll never look back, back
How do you feel?
I bet you don't feel anything
Don't have a heart attack
Don't have a heart attack
But I won't stop you

[Verse 2]
Flying high, razor blades make perfect lines
On just about anything you want
Broken pores spill out
Everything you want to say
It shows my weakness for
Falling in love with
My wallowing despair that shines in black
It consumes me, I'll take it back
I'll build it back to what it was

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't believe
Everyone knew from the start
This would come back to haunt me
I can't stand to see you now
How could I ever trust you?

[Chorus]
Ill take it back to the streets
I'll start again
I'll never look back
I'll never look back, back
How do you feel?
I bet you don't feel anything
Don't have a heart attack
Don't have a heart attack
But I won't stop you

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't believe
Everyone knew from the start
This would come back to haunt me
I can't stand to see you now
How could I ever trust you?

[Verse 2]
Cut me out of your life
Like its nothing, like I'm nothing
Make believe you can love
That it's better, that youre better
Part of me is gone
You've taken
You've taken
Part of me is gone
You've taken
Pieces from me

[Chorus]
Ill take it back to the streets
I'll start again
I'll never look back
I'll never look back, back
How do you feel?
I bet you don't feel anything
Don't have a heart attack
Don't have a heart attack
But I won't stop you

[Outro]
You won't stop, you'll never change
You won't stop, you'll never change
