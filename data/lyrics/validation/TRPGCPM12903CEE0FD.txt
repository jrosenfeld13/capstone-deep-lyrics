Beyond the black of the netherworld
Lies a kingdom untouched
Created by the sins of man...
And the evil that man do

Walls painted
With the color of blood
Walls that surround all
That malice embrace

Out of the dark and toward the shadows
The mice feast on their flesh
Nameless souls are trapped in the twilight
Trapped in a time that newers end's

Demons that hunt in the night
Soldiers of the nocturnal light
Evil spawn the masters creation
Seeds of hate, the cast of damnation

Pain is all where nothing is
Is nothing where pain is all

Walls painted
With the color of blood
Walls that surround all
That malice embrace

Out of the dark and toward the shadows
The mice feast on their flesh
Nameless souls are trapped in the twilight
Trapped in a time that newers end's...
...and never will
