Tommy lee - I don't deny I'm in the public eye seems like 24/7 being
Watched by a spy makes me wonder why they don't live their
Own livestheir not news reporters-they're full of bullshit
And lies leave them alone their carma will be their demise
I can read between the lines they make up shit because
Theres no shit to find, I'm under a microscope directly going
To prison if I take a toke people ask me for answers
As if I was the pope I'm my own spiritual leader on this
Emotional teetor totter my senses are getting hotter

Chorus - are you testing me?
Get the f**k back punk
Get the f**k back back

Tommy lee - now I see what's on the real the public
Craves drama like a pig that squeals they watched me in
Court testifyin to a f**ked up charge I was drowning myself
In my own tears, of my boys growing up in their early years
Without their father near ain't noway I'm gonna dissapear can
You hear? freedom can be taken from you at anytime so you
Better think twice before you pay the price, pay the price!

Chorus - are you testing me?

Get the f**k back punk
Get the f**k back back

Chorus - no one can condem!

Fitten to go rictor gonna get sicka thats for sure were
Bumpin up the temperature were blowin up the area
Gonna scare ya, were the methods of mayhem no one can condem!

Chorus - are you testing me?
Get the f**k back punk
Get the f**k back back

Chorus - no one can condem!
Chorus - no one can condem!

Fitten to go rictor gonna get sicka thats for sure were
Bumpin up the temperature were blowin up the area
Gonna scare ya, were the methods of mayhem!

Chorus - are you testing me?
Get the f**k back punk
Get the f**k back back
