[Verse: Donald Smith]
My heart feels so warm when you are around
My soul starts to sing like birds in spring
Starlight in your eyes and joy is in your heart
Baby don't you know our love grows forever and ever more

My heart feels so warm when you are around
Don't you know my soul starts to sing like birds in spring
Starlight is in your eyes and joy is, sweet lady, is in your heart
I know I feel our love grow forever and ever more
I know, I know, I know girl, forever and ever more
Forever and ever more
Forever and ever and ever more
