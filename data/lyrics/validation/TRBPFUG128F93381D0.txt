Are you ready
Cause we're all traitors
Are you ready
True faces will unfold
Are you ready
Theres no surrender
Are you ready
Take back what is yours

If their numbers knock us down (Are you ready)
Gather up and retalliate
Don't be afraid to stand your ground (Are you ready)
They're only human like you

Are you ready
To grasp your vengence
Are you ready
Lose hope with who controls
Are you ready
To seize their existence
Are you ready
Take back what is yours

If their numbers knock us down (Are you ready)
Gather up and retalliate
Don't be afraid to stand your ground (Are you ready)
They're only human like you

If their numbers knock us down (Are you ready)
Gather up and retalliate (Are you ready)
Don't be afraid to stand your ground (Are you ready)
Are you ready...
Are you ready or not
