How is there going to be peace?
When there is no justice, oh no, oh
Someone is taking more than their share
Of the bounties of this land and that's not fair

So little people got more than they need
While there's so many hungry mouths in the world to feed
And I am would give my heart so true
And I will give my love for you, tell me

How is there going to be peace?
When there is no justice, oh no, oh
Someone is taking my share
And they just don't give a damn, no they don't care

So, you just might as well face it
'Cause there ain't no other way to erase it
And I will give my heart so true
And I will give my love for you, tell me
