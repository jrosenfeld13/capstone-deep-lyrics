[Verse 1: Richard Patrick]
What do you think you did here, kid?
You're living like some rich kid bitch
The scratch that makes you flinch
The scratch that you can't itch

What do you think you got done here, man?
You're putting on a show
What do you think you got done here, kid?
Did you reach your killing goal?

[Chorus:]
Shame
You get everything
You want everything
Shame
You need everything
You killed everything
Shame
You get everything
You want everything
Shame
You need everything
You killed everything

[Verse 2]
Oh, Christ, look at them bleed
Oh, what makes this sick disease?
Oh God, they're on their hands and knees
Oh, look at me, I'm about to be free

Now when it's all over
Listen to this shit, man
Now when it's all over
We won't care
We won't care

[Chorus]

Killed everything

[Chorus 2:]
Shame
Shame
You need everything
You killed everything
Shame
Shame
You need everything
You killed everything

Shame
Shame
Shame
Shame
