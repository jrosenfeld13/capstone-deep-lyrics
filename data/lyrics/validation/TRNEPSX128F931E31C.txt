[Verse 1: Lisa Miskovsky]
I have changed, I have changed
Just like you, just like you
For how long? For how long must I wait?
I know there's something wrong
Your concrete heart isn't beating
And I've tried to make it come alive
No shadows, just red lights
Now I'm here to rescue you

[Chorus]
I'm still alive, I'm still alive
I cannot apologize, no
I'm still alive, I'm still alive
I cannot apologize, no

[Verse 2: Lisa Miskovsky]
So silent, no violence
But inside my head, so loud and clear
You're screamin', you're screamin'
Covered up with a smile I've learned to fear
Just sunshine and blue skies
Is this all we get for living here?
Come fire, come fire!
Let it burn and love come racing through

[Chorus]
I'm still alive, I'm still alive
I cannot apologize, no
I'm still alive, I'm still alive
I cannot apologize, no

[Bridge]
I've learned to lose, I've learned to win
I turned my face against the wind
I will move fast, I will move slow
Take me where I have to go

[Chorus]
I'm still alive, I'm still alive
I cannot apologize, no
I'm still alive
I'm still alive, I'm still alive
I cannot apologize, no
I'm still alive, I'm still alive
I cannot apologize, no
I'm still alive, I'm still alive
I cannot apologize, no
