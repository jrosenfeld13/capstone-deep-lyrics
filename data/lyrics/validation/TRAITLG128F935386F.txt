I'll be waiting on your train
When you come back
Through the western state

Where I left you on the platform
Life gets so hard
But I know that you'll be fine

Stations make me think of my own travels
All the people
The places I've been through

And when you find out they're the same thing
As the people the places where you grew

Can you promise me you still love
What you loved when you left?

Will you promise me you still have
What you had when you left?

All I want is to be honest
Like the season
As talk about that slows...

But there's compassion that holds no words
It holds no words
I feel it as you go

Can you promise me you still love
What you loved when you left?

Will you promise me you still have
What you had when you left?
