I'm going down south
Won't be misquoted in my own bed
That's what I said, that's what I said
You missed the loophole in my head
That's what I said, that's what I said
That's what I said, that's what I said
If a nice girl sings about heart attacks
Will people listen or turn their backs?
Cause sugar coating is bitter sweet
Do people just want to move their feet?
Puffy clouds or puffy eyes
Don't know which will make me wise
Ridiculously analyzed
And they move slow, that's no surprise
That's what I said, that's what I said
That's what I said, that's what I said
Now everyday you pack a bow
Think about the words you know
Drag good people into holes
Your expertise runs very low
Critically you ridicule
One who'd kick your a** in pool
But technically you're just a tool
You'd point out things like your own school
That's what I said, that's what I said
Here we go, here we go, here we go right now
Have a daisy, have a rose
You dignifiedly pick your nose
Then wipe it on the girls whose pose
You'd like to hose and expose
Long and lazy, tough and lean
They call you out as the king of mean
You bite the hand of the too serene
I'll bet the king of mean's no sex machine
Typically you're topical
You like the dance of push and pull
You think that everyone's a fool
But you're bananas and a bully
That's what I said, that's what I said
That's what I said, that's what I said
That's what I said, that's what I said
That's what I said, that's what I said
If you don't care 'bout what I said
You don't care 'bout what's in my head
You think I might as well be dead
Then how'd we end up back in bed
