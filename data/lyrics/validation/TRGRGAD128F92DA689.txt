When I was young I lived in the country
Clouds were my friends I cannot answer why
Now that I've grown I live in the city
And heaven is so far I cannot reach the sky

I once met a man who lived in the city
The stone was his home he said his heart was mine
He led me far away when he told me I was pretty
How strange to go so far and never touch the sky

Gardens grow most times in the country
Grow a-wondrous high
Gardens grow sometimes in the city
Grow, but soon they die

Now I look up at the buildings of the city
Their fingers are so much longer than mine
I wish I had the hands of the city
For heaven is so far I cannot reach the sky

Gardens grow most times in the country
Grow a-wondrous high
Gardens grow sometimes in the city
Grow, but soon they die

When I was young I lived in the country
Clouds were my friends, I cannot answer why
Now that I've grown I live in the city
And heaven is so far I cannot reach the sky
And heaven is so far I'll never touch the sky
