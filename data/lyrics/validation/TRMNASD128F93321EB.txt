[Verse 1]
Come on closer
I wanna show you
What I'd like to do
You sit back now
Just relax now
I'll take care of you

[Chorus]
Hot temptations
Sweet sensations
Infiltrating through
Sweet sensations
Hot temptations
Coming over you

[Verse 2]
Gonna take it slow babe
Do it my way
Keep your eyes on me
Your reaction
To my action
Is what I want to see

[Chorus]
Rhythmic motion
Raw emotion
Infiltrating through
Sweet sensations
Hot temptations
Coming over you

[Verse 3]
And now you're satisfied
A twinkle in your eye
Go to sleep for ten
And anticipating
I will be waiting
For you to wake again

[Chorus]
Hot temptations
Sweet sensations
Infiltrating through
Sweet sensations
Hot temptations
Coming over you

[Chorus]
Hot temptations
Sweet sensations
Infiltrating through
Sweet sensations
Hot temptations
Coming over you

[Chorus]
Hot temptations
Sweet sensations
Infiltrating through
Sweet sensations
Hot temptations
Coming over you
