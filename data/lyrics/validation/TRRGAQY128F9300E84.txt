Sweet scent coloured these
The realm of sweet snakes that tortured me
If everlasting burdens should enter
Such, as the everlasting torment of hell

Sweet rape, honour these:
The souls of sweet snakes that denoured me
If glorious destruction would embalm
Such, as the moments carresed by enlightened ones

"Even the earth can't grant us a common grave."
