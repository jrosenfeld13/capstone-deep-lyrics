The Hiring Fair
(Ralph McTell)

Well, I went down to the hiring fair for to sell my labour
I noticed a maid in the very next row and
I hoped she'd be my neighbour
Imagine then my delight when the farmer picked us both
I spoke not a word on the cart to the farm
But my heart beat in my throat

Well, my lodgings were dry and my master fair
And I gave him full measure
But my envy grew like the corn in the field
For in his house was my treasure
I'd watch her carry water or drive cows from the byre
And the heat from the sun made the corn grow strong
And with it my desire

Well, I'd see her in my dreaming, and in my dreams caress
Her eyes, her lips, and her dark brown hair
The curves beneath her dress
When harvest time it came at last, so heavy was the task
That the women and the men worked side by side
And I had her near at last

So I swung harder with my scythe. Few words between us passed
And I cursed my tongue-tied youthfulness
And hoped that she'd hear my heart
When all was safely gathered in, and we sat down to rest
My trembling fingers touched her arm and
She placed them on her breast

And then she turned to me as the sun went down
And all my senses reeled
As we lay there on the scented ground and
The moon rose over the field. Hmmm....

Well she was safely gathered in my arms when from the barn
Drifted the sound of a violin and we hurried back to the farm
And all were dancing in the lantern light and music filled the air
And I thanked my stars for the harvest moon and
The girl from the hiring fair

And all were dancing in the lantern light and music filled the air
And I thanked my stars for the harvest moon and
The girl from the hiring fair
