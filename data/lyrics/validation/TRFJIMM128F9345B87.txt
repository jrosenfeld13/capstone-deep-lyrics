My baby I know that you want me each lonely night and day
Your deep blue eyes how they haunt me though you're far away
Oh why did she take you away from arms and leave nothing to cherrish there
She's left me so blue but when she took you too it seems more than l could bear
My baby I want you tonight dear after my work is through
To rock you to sleep in my arms dear and sing lullabys to you
[ fiddle ]
A dream of you baby caresses dimples and golden hair
And reach out to clasp you in my arms to find only emptiness there
Your future has been the chief thing in my life you'll never know how it means
My plans and my schemes are all blasted it seems for you are my only embrace
My baby I want you tonight dear after my work is through
Just to rock you to sleep in my arms dear and sing lullabys to you
