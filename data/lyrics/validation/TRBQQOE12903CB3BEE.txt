[Verse 1]
I got two strong arms
Blessings of Babylon
Time to carry on
And try for sins and false alarms
So, to America, the brave
Wise men save

[Chorus]
Near a tree by a river, there's a hole in the ground
Where an old man of Aran goes around and around
And his mind is a beacon in the veil of the night
For a strange kind of fashion, there's a wrong and a right
But he'll never, never fight over you

[Verse 2]
I got plans for us
Nights in the scullery
And days instead of me
I only know what to discuss
Of for anything, but light
Wise men fighting over you
It's not me you see
Pieces of valentine
And just a song of mine
To keep from burning history
Seasons of gasoline and gold
Wise men fold

[Chorus]
Near a tree by a river, there's a hole in the ground
Where an old man of Aran goes around and around
And his mind is a beacon in the veil of the night
For a strange kind of fashion, there's a wrong and a right
But he'll never, never fight over you

[Bridge]
I got time to kill
Sly looks in corridors
Without a plan of yours
A blackbird sings on bluebird hill
Thanks to the calling of the wild
Wise men's child

[Chorus]
Near a tree by a river, there's a hole in the ground
Where an old man of Aran goes around and around
And his mind is a beacon in the veil of the night
For a strange kind of fashion, there's a wrong and a right
But he'll never, never fight over you
Near a tree by a river, there's a hole in the ground
Where an old man of Aran goes around and around
And his mind is a beacon in the veil of the night
For a strange kind of fashion, there's a wrong and a right
But he'll never, never fight over you

[Outro]
No, he'll never, never fight over you
