Here they go, lying again
Beating everybody at their favourite game
But in the end nobody wins no

Here they go let's pretend the rules have changed but the
Names the same
And in the end nobody wins no

Do you think they don't know what they're doing
Do you think they don't know who they're fooling

When I was a boy and I was told that heaven was hot and hell was cold
If I told lies I'd freeze my soul but it didn't seem to matter

Do you think they don't know what they're doing
Do you think they don't know who they're fooling

There they go lying again
They want it just as much as us
And in the end nobody wins no

There they go lying again
They pulled the wool and we all fell in
And in the end nobody wins no

There they go lying again (you're telling lies)
There they go lying again (you're telling lies)
