You broke my heart
Cause I couldn't dance
You didn't even want me around
And now I'm back
To let you know
I can really shake 'em down


Do you love me?
(I can really move)
Do you love me?
(I'm in the groove)
Ah, do you love me?
(Do you love me)
Now that I can dance
(Dance)

Watch me now, hey
(Work, work)
Ah, work it out baby
(Work, work)
Well, you're drivin' me crazy
(Work, work)
With a little bit of soul now
(Work)

I can mash-potato
(I can mash-potato)
And I can do the twist
(I can do the twist)
Now tell me baby
(Tell me baby)
Mmm, do you like it like this
(Do you like it like this)
Tell me
(Tell me)
Tell me

Do you love me?
(Do you love me)
Now, do you love me?
(Do you love me)
Now, do you love me?
(Do you love me)
Now that I can dance
(Dance)
Dance

Watch me now, oh
(Work, work)
Ah, shake it up, shake it
(Work, work)
Ah, shake 'em, shake 'em down
(Work, work)
Ah, little bit of soul now
(Work)

(Work, work)
Ah, shake it, shake it baby
(Work, work)
Ah, you're driving me crazy
(Work, work)
Ah, don't get lazy
(Work)

I can mash-potato
(I can mash-potato)
And I can do the twist
(I can do the twist)
Well now tell me baby
(Tell me baby)
Mmm, do you like it like this
(Do you like it like this)
Tell me
(Tell me)
Tell me

Do you love me?
(Do you love me?)
Now, do you love me?
(Do you love me?)
Now, do you love me?
(Do you love me?)
Now...that I...can dance...

And don't you get lazy
