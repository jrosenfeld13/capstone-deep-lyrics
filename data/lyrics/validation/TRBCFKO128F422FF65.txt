I washed with water and stared at him over again
My silly faces were changing from pale to red
And how did I get here? Now I can't turn my head
Sometimes we hear what's softly spoken yet still seem so afraid
And when we're healing all that's broken
We turn to you and say I think you're right where you belong

I touched my hand upon Elvis and I can't complain
I touched, only felt on his canvas and I'll do it again
Why are we even holding on so long?
And we still touch you barely breathing, you seem to have had it made
We're feeling fairly open but who am I to say?
I think you're right where you belong

I'm staring over and over and over again
And I'm wondering if I'd ever been here and when
Hey, Ali also won our hearts long ago
But honestly I, too, move so slowly yet seem to make the grade
And when I'm feeling rather lonely I turn to you and say
I think you're right where you belong

Hey, hello, are you my only friend?
I'm wondering when I'll see your face again
Hey, hello, are you my only friend?
So now I'm wondering if I'll see your face again
Hey, hello, are you my only friend?

I'd love to hang with you someday (12x)
