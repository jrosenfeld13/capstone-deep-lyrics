The first time I met Davey it was 1985
We were three sheets to the wind and a couple of tokes over the line
But I've replayed that moment like a movie in my mind
The first time I met Davey it was 1985

The next time I saw Davey it was at a high school dance
He was with my best friend Mary
I was singin' with the band
My life passed before me in that passing glance
And I knew I'd never be the same again

And I sing
Davey runs through the roses
And Davey runs through my mind
Thinkin' that the road I chose
Was the best one at the time
Those mem'ries they're just moments
You wish would never end
But they never stay
They just float away
Like ashes in the wind

Davey married Mary and went on with his life
So I went and found a husband and tried to be a wife
But I knew from 'I Do'
Deep down it wasn't right
And that's why I'm lookin' back alone tonight

And I sing
Davey runs through the roses
And Davey runs through my head
Wishin' that the road I chose
Was another one instead
Those mem'ries they're just moments
You pray will never end
But they never stay
They just float away
Like ashes in the wind

The minutes turn to days
And the days they turn to years
And a lifetime you can waste
When you're runnin' from your fears

The last time I saw Davey it was 1999
We had gathered all together
We had come to say goodbye
To the heart of an old soul
Who was far too young to die
And in the still you could hear the angels cry

And I sing
Davey runs through the roses
And Davey danced through my life
I can see him up there with Moses
Right next to Jesus Christ
While I'm standin' at the crossroads
Wonderin' what's around the bend
He's miles from here
Beyond the atmosphere
Just ashes in the wind
I can see him rise into the sky
Just ashes in the wind
