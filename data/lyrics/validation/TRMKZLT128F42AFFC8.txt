Wake up, and get dressed
Check your pulse and tie me in
I can't think cause you're starring at me
I'll snap that look right off your face

Glad I'm off this, suck one down with me
It keeps me believing, yeah!

I don't wanna fight
I don't wanna be
This is my disease
It will be there in the morning
Will be there when I wake
The sad reality...

Well back up, and strap in
This could be one hell of a ride, and I
Can guarantee my friend
You will make it out this time

Glad I'm off this, suck one down with me
It keeps me believing, yeah!

I don't wanna fight
I don't wanna be
This is my disease
It will be there in the morning
It off's me as I sleep
This feeling's killing me (yeah)

This is my disease
This is my disease
This is my disease
This is my disease

I don't wanna fight
I don't wanna be
This is my disease
It will be there in the morning
Will be there when I wake
The sad reality...

Well, I don't wanna fight
I don't wanna be
This is my disease
It will be there in the morning
It off's me as I sleep
This feeling is killing me, oh yeah
