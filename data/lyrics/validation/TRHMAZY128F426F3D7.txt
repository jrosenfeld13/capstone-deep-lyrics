Put out your hand
Open up your heart
How can I love you when we're so far apart?
And all I want is your love
All I want is your love

Put out your hand
Open up your mind
How can you love me then just leave me behind?
When all I want is your love
When all I want is your love

Here I am waiting for you
Here I am all alone
Here I am waiting for you
Tell me what went wrong

All I-I-I want is your love
All I want is your love
I want your love

Tell me that you love me
That you're never going leave me
That you're never gonna hurt me
That you never will deceive me
That you're thinking that you'll see me
That you're always thinking of me
Tell me

You want my love
You want my love

Put out your hand
Open up your heart
How can I love you when we're so far apart?
When all I want is your love
All I want is your love

Here I am waiting for you
Here I am all alone
Here I am waiting for you
Tell me what went wrong

All I want is your love
All I want is your love
I want your love

I want your love
Oh
Yeah
I want your love
I want your love
Oh, I want your love
