[Verse 1]
Dad, Dad, why did you let that man
Push you around like that?
You shoul've beat him down
Down to the ground
Down to the ground for that

[Pre-Chorus]
He said son, you're still young
And you always jump the gun

[Chorus]
There's real people in the big, big trucks
That you flip off when they get in the road
You get so hacked that you pay no mind
To the great big sign that says "oversize load"

Do you really think they can go as fast
As you in your '87 Trans Am?
They know you're in such a terrible rush
But they're going just as fast, as fast as they can

[Verse 2]
Dad, Dad, I really don't understand
What driving big trucks has to do with that man
You should've taught him a lesson about being rude
About talking to you in such an attitude

[Pre-Chorus]
He said son, you're still young
And you always jump the gun

[Chorus]
There's real people in the big, big trucks
That you flip off when they get in the road
You get so hacked that you pay no mind
To the great big sign that says "oversize load"

Do you really think they can go as fast
As you in your '87 Trans Am?
They know you're in such a terrible rush
But they're going just as fast, as fast as they can
