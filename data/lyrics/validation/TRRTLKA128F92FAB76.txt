What's the problem?
Were you swept under the rug to shrug it off again?
Hey you, what's the difference?
Did you finally lose control of all your confidence?

Keep on going going going going going til you know it
If you keep on going, you're finally going to blow it
'Cause that's the way you handle everything

Got stuck in the middle for a little too long and you lost your head
Got pushed to the side for the ride of your life so you walked instead
Calm down right now, I know you weren't wrong
You were stickin' in the middle for a little too long

On the way out
It wasn't on your terms, you learned your lesson quick
Hey you, tired of trying
Try to understand, off-hand, that's just the way it is

Got stuck in the middle for a little too long and you lost your head
Got pushed to the side for the ride of your life so you walked instead
Calm down right now, I know you weren't wrong
You were stickin' in the middle for a little too long

Find the words and you'll find your way out
