I'm a lonesome school boy
And I just came into town
I'm a lonesome school boy
And I just came into town

Well, I heard so much about Melbourne
I decided to check it out
Well, I wait in Lester square
Always a look in my eye

Well, I lean on Nelson's corner
All I seem to do is talk to the lines
Where do I get my cock sucked?
Where do I get my ass fucked?

I may not have any money
But I know where to put it every time
Well, I asked the young policeman
Well, he only locked me up for the night

Well, I had pigs in the farmyard
Some of them they're alright
Well, he fucked me with his truncheon
And his helmet is way to tight

Where do I get my cock fucked?
Where do I get my ass fucked?
I may not have any money
But I know where to put it every time

I'm a lonesome school boy
And I just came into town
I'm a lonesome school boy
And I just came into town
