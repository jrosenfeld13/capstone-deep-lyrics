If I get your name and your telephone number
We can get together baby sooner than later
But if you walk away then we're gonna be strangers
Won't you take the chance? I can make it much better

I don't really know you but I'm trying to get over
You looked so good I just had to walk over
I wondered if your name is Lisa, Tammy or Mona
And if you spare the time I can tell you about me

'Cause I'm the man with the fun, yes I am
Yes, I'm the man with the fun, I don't hit and run
'Cause I'm the man with the fun, yes I am
Yes, I'm the man with the fun, I don't hit and run

I'm the type of man who can hold it together
And even if it rains I can be your umbrella
So tell me what to do so I can hold you much closer
Baby won't you give me just your name and your number?

Or is there someone else? I don't see no ring
And if you say no we can do our thing
It's looking like you're free, is it true that you're single?
So maybe we can get together baby and mingle

'Cause I'm the man with the fun, yes I am
Yes, I'm the man with the fun, I don't hit and run
Yes, I'm the man with the fun, yes I am
Yes, I'm the man with the fun, I don't hit and run

So, if I get your name or your telephone number
We can get together baby sooner than later
But if you walk away than we're gonna be strangers
So if you take the chance baby things will get better

'Cause I'm the man with the fun, yes I am
Yes, I'm the man with the fun, I don't hit and run
Yes, I'm the man with the fun, yes I am
I'm the man with the fun, I don't hit and run

'Cause I'm the man with the fun, yes I am
Yes, I'm the man with the fun, I don't hit and run

Not gonna leave you, put your trust in me, baby
Not gonna leave you, put your trust in me

Yes, I'm the man with the fun, yes I am
Yes, I'm the man with the fun, I don't hit and run
