There's a song in your eye that's as blue as the sky
And just looking at you keeps me singing it
There's this music and wine don't it sparkle and shine
And it's one for your money and two to quit
And every day it's getting less hard to be
Never together but close sometimes
Windows and rain
Blue birds and planes
They're never together but they're close sometimes

A boy in New York once captured my heart
But her winter was cold so I had to split
Sweet Tennessee spoke softly to me
Home is your home when you're loving it
And every day it's getting less hard to be
Never together but close sometimes
Windows and rain
Blue birds and planes
They're never together but they're close sometimes

There's life in these bars when you make believe stars
People and loneliness passing time
A world full of fools sitting glued to that stool
Drowning their sadness in rosey wine
And every day it's getting less hard to be
Never together but close sometimes
Windows and rain
Blue birds and planes
They're never together but they're close sometimes
Never together but they're close sometimes
