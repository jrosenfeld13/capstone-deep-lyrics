Come and see me
Can't you see me
It's so easy
To believe in you
I believed in you

Your intention, my addiction
Fear no evil
You'll be safe in here, I was saved in here

And fools shine on
Where fools shine on

Want tomorrow, no tomorrow
Come together
Only here and now, and I need it now

Walk the narrow, straight and narrow
Look behind me
There's a light out there, in your light I stare

And fools shine on
Where fools shine on
And fools shine on

Where your eyes won't open
Fade or divide
Peace, from the darkest hours
Bathe in your light

Yeah-e-yeah

Come and see me
Can't you see me
Come and see me
You'll be saved in here

And fools shine on
Where fools shine on

Yeah

And fools shine on
Where fools shine on
