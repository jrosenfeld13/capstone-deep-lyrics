You will not walk alone
When you travel through
My realms of hate
You will not see the end of days
Welcome to my realms of death
This world is mine, until the end of time
Killing by numbers
Find and destroy
From here and beyond
Dark servants around the world
Bow down to your god
A world filled with desire
A world filled with my hate
The rage of torments fire
Death is your fate
