It seems like every single day
I hear all of my friends say
You're just too damn crazy
And it seems like every dawn that breaks
I reflect on what it takes
Sometimes I just can't see past this
We got our love
But I don't know what to do with it
We got our love
But I don't know what to do with it
Seems like every single time
When I hear that Patsy Cline
I think of when we were younger
Now I see people and their lies
Through frosted glass and swollen eyes
Can't you just get over yourself and call?
We got our love
But I don't know what to do with it
Oh yeah, we got our love
But I don't know what to do with it
Because we got our love
But I don't know what to do with it
We got our love
But I don't know what to do with it
I never wanna be like that
I never wanna be like that
No, I never wanna be like that
See, I never wanna be like that
Yeah, I never wanna be like that
See, I never wanna be like that
See, I never wanna be like that
Yeah, I never wanna be like that
Yeah, I never wanna be like that
Yeah, I never wanna be like that
Yeah, I never wanna be like that
Yeah, I never wanna be like that
I never wanna be like that
See, I never wanna be like that
Yeah, I never wanna be like that
Yeah, I never wanna be like that
I never wanna be like that
I never wanna be like that
I never wanna be like that
