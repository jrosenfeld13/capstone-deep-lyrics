You can't keep me holding on
I've given you some time
I can't make you come along
If you don't share your mind
Every time you close your eyes
I know you feel the same
Everything you try to fight
Is drowning in the rain
What does it take to open your eyes?
Don't let it fade
You've got to let the sun shine
Through the rain
Open your eyes
Don't let me wait
You've got to let the sun shine
Through the rain
Tell me why you turn away
Whenever I believe
Finally you've come to say
I'm everything you need
Every time you close your eyes
I know you feel the same
Everything you try to fight
Is drowning in the rain
What does it take to open your eyes?
Don't let it fade
You've got to let the sun shine
Through the rain
Open your eyes
Don't let me wait
You've got to let the sun shine
Through the rain
I'm not asking of you
To give yourself away
I just want you to
Hear the words I say
It's only a matter of time
It's only a matter of time
It's only a matter of time
It's only a matter of time
What does it take to open your eyes?
Don't let it fade
You've got to let the sun shine
Through the rain
Open your eyes
Don't let me wait
You've got to let the sun shine
Through the rain
