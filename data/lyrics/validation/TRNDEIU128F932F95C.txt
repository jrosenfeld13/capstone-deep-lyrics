Low sun rising into the blue
Mama it feels all right next to you
You bring the fire, you make it shake
You make all our lovin' go to earthquake

Feels so good to me
That's the way it should be

I know how to love you

Low sun rising into the blue
Mama it feels so nice next to you
Shotgun comin' hear the call
All your lovin, you've run too far

Feels so good to me
That's the way it should be

I know how to love you
