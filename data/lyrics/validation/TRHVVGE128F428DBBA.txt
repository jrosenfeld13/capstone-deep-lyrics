I'm lost in my hidden fantasies
Carried by my perverse longings
I feel anxiety
Bring me your ecstasy and feel
My moist skin

Wax, falling down like tears
Your curves are all I need
Surrender purity
And give in...

Come, rip my soul
My aching fears
There's no time left
Just bite my lips
Don't wanna be alone right now...

We melted to each other's arms
And slurped on each
Others sharp charms
I'm losing sanity
Bring me your ecstasy and aim
Don't be ashamed

Wax, falling down like tears
Your curves are all I need
Surrender purity
And give in...

Come, rip my soul
My aching fears
There's no time left
Just bite my lips
Don't wanna be alone right now...

I can't resist the heat in me
The heat in me
No, I can't deal
I just wanna feel
Eroticism and endless warmth
Wanna make you crawl and
Make you explode!
