To my mistress the bridge, I don't feel well
I'll be leaving, you can't stop me
We've been carrying on too long
We've been carrying on too long

I'm sorry, but I'm gone
I've got a bad reputation to think about
I've been dirty, I've been wrong
Maybe someday they'll find that I've washed up

I'm stepping out to clear my head
I'm breathing in to fill my lungs
We're all dead
We're all dead

Farewell scenic highway overpass
It's better this way anyway
My lover the river makes a better soldier than a bride
My lover the river makes a better soldier than a bride

But I left my heart at the side of her bed
And she's got the warmest body that I've ever had

Drag the lake, you'll find it full of love
Drag the lake, you'll find it full of love
Drag the lake, you'll find it full of love

Bring the children to the water
And let them see what heartache did
This matrimony needs a witness
And you can teach them to swim
And you can teach them to swim
And you can teach them all to swim

Don't let your dreamers
Grow up to be dead men
Drown us at birth
Save her some time

Drifting on romantic holiday
Breathless as her cold arms cover me

Drag the lake, you'll find it full of love
Drag the lake, you'll find it full of love
