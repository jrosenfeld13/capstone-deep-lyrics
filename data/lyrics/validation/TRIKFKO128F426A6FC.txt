To see the things in a brand new light
Not to give up without a fight
To surrender is not in my sight
I'm a child of the universe
In the noisy confusion of life
Where uncertainty rules my way
It's so easy to go astray
I got to keep strong and bold

Give me a way to accept things
I cannot change anymore
The courage to change the things I can
And the wisdom to know the difference

In the midst of the darkness
There's a voice that you know so well
Lifts you up from the madness where you dwell
Don't give in to the hopelesness
Keep the innocence in your heart
And the end before your start
Be the warrior of the light
Don't give up without a fight

Give me a way to accept things
I cannot change anymore
The courage to change the things I can
And the wisdom to know the difference
