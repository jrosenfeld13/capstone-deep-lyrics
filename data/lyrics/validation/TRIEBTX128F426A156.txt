Screaming from the sky
Gotta call for me to die
Somebody's calling my name
Silent wings will touch my faith

Crucified lies that hurts my deepest inner
Death knocking at my door
It's a requiem for a sinner

Something crawling deep inside me
And baptized my pride
Hear my silent heartbeat
One step it's death or cheat

Can't stop the rage
It's a requiem for a sinner
