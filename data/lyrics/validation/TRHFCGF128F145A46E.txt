Your evil eyes, are cold as ice
Your face is so wild
Just like the beak of an eagle that cries

I feel the danger, but I can't break loose
My heart is on fire
And every flame is called: you

Can you feel my love
Can you feel my love

You're gonna burn my heart
You're gonna burn my heart

Allright, all night, allright with you !
Feel allright all night
Take me, take me, take me cruel !

You are talking of the night, the demon ready to fight
I am your witch queen
And through thunder and lightning, we ride

I feel the danger
I can't break loose
You are the son of the devil
I'm longing for you
