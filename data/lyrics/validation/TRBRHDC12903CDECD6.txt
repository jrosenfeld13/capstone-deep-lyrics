Keep running with this, it's running through my fingers
Solid connection happening
Ten long years and this crooked smile still bare
Low vibrations shake the base of the ground
Soft monotony pulling me in like womb
So long
A strange cool to get

Strict coil, long face, horse hooves stepping around in the dirt
With morose fatigue I worked my way halfway through the body
'Til I hit the heart
It seeped black tar at the first bit of tooth
Such a long road to get to this point, I thought

With this contaminated
Fluid like dry rot in the gums
The tooth had gone bad
And so had you

They butterflied
The muscles in my back
In order to give me wings
I never asked, I never asked to fly
Locked away in a mahogany case
I always took the strange way
It never seemed strange to me

Strict coil, long face, horse hooves stepping around in the dirt
With morose fatigue I worked my way halfway through the body
'Til I hit the heart
It seeped black tar at the first bit of tooth
Such a long road to get to this point, I thought

How many ways
Could there have been
Or such ways I could have lied to myself
It's in storms or chords or beats or in time
Strokes of hands in air of homes

Reorder
Redirect
Stop biting
Disinfect cold skin
Implement warm feeling in the neck

The fixture cracks in moments
The foundation like the chin of some relic sculpture
The art turns into dust

You can take the time to cover me in vines
Hide me in the shack behind the house I grew up in till I'm ripe

You want a suitor?
You want a chance to forget?
Well I'm glad we met
I think I'd look nice in your lawn

You can take the time to cover me in vines
Hide me in the shack behind the house I grew up in till I'm ripe
