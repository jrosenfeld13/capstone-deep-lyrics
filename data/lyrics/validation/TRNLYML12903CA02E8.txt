I wonder why nobody don't like me
Or is it the fact that I'm ugly?
I wonder why nobody don't like me

I leave my whole house and home
My children don't want me no more
Bad talk inside the house they bring
And when I talk they start to sing

"Mama, look at bubu", they shout
Their mother tell them, "Shut up your mout' "
"That is your daddy", "Oh, no"
"My daddy can't be ugly so"
"Shut your mout' " "Go away"

"Mama, look at bubu" they
(Ooh)
"Shut your mout' " "Go away"
"Mama, look at bubu" they

I couldn't even digest me supper
Due to the children's behavior
John, "Come here a moment"
("Yes, pa")
"Bring the belt, you're much too impudent"

John says it's James who started first
James tells the story in reverse
I drag my belt from off me waist
You should hear them screamin' 'round the place

"Mama, look at bubu" they shout
Their mother tell them "Shut up your mout' "
"That is your daddy", "Oh, no"
"My daddy can't be ugly so"
"Shut your mout' " "Go away"

"Mama, look at bubu" they
(Ooh)
"Shut your mouth, Go away"
"Mama, look at bubu they"
(Oh)

So I began to question the mudda
These children ain't got no behavior
So I began to question the mudda
These children ain't got no behavior

"They're playing with you" my wife declared
"You should be proud of them, my dear"
"These children were taught to bloomin' slack"
That ain't no kind of joke to crack

"Mama, look at bubu" they shout
Their mother tell them "Shut up your mout' "
"That is your daddy", "Oh, no"
"My daddy can't be ugly so"
"Shut your mout' " "Go away"

"Mama, look at bubu" they
(Ooh)
"Shut your mout' " "Go away"

"Mama, look at bubu" they
(Ooh)
"Shut your mout' " "Go away"
