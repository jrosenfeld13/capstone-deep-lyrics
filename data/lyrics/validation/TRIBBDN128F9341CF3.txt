I've been sneaking out your back door
Since I can't remember when
Thinking about the world I didn't know
(And how I wanted it)
But now I'm fighting in the thick of it
And feeling so alone
I take a chance, just one more chance
To get me anywhere

It's like I'm running down every road but home

And now I'm running
I'm moving too fast
So we would know (ohh)
And where I'm headed to
It's nobody's guess
So here we go (ohh)
So here we go (ohh)

I saw the map like any other would
Looking to find and follow lines
That led me to questions
But I can see it in the symmetry
It's what was really always meant to be
The singularity is clear from the distance

So I'm dying here to fall in love with home

And now I'm running
I'm moving too fast
So here we go (ohh)
And where I'm headed to
It's nobody's guess
So here we go (ohh)
So here we go (ohh)

Staring into mirrors
Lost in my design
Leaving dreams and wait for signs
You will always find me when I run away
So I will not slow down
Until I make it back into your arms this time (ahh)

And now I'm running
I'm moving too fast
So here we go (ohh)
And where I'm headed to
It's nobody's guess
So here we go (ohh)

And now I'm running
I'm moving too fast
So here we go (ohh-a-woah)
And where I'm headed to
You don't have to guess
So here we go (ohh-a-woah)
I'm headed home (ohh-a-woah)
I'm headed home (ohh)
