[Verse 1]
Brother John saw visions of God
So they put him in chains for acting too odd
As the crowd shouted, "Off with his head"
The priest said, "Have mercy let's burn him instead"

[Chorus]
Trapped, trapped in a world that he never made
Trapped in a world that he never made

[Verse 2]
I woke up with my head on the floor
In a windowless cell, a room full of doors
I got lost, now I'm so far behind
Took so much advice, forgot my own mind

[Chorus]
Trapped, trapped in a world that I never made
Trapped in a world that I never made
Trapped in a world that I never made
Trapped in a world that I never made

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
We can't be slowed down by a big bunch of lip
And nobody cares about your paranoid trip
You know death and the Devil sure got it easy today
Souls come so cheap some people give theirs away

You've got to break out, you've got to prove you're alive
What makes you think that the weak survive
And if you don't have the stomach for all this radical crap
Then have the guts to stand for something or you're gonna be trapped

[Chorus - Outro]
Trapped in a world that you never made
Trapped in a world that you never made
Everybody knows that we've been trapped in a world that you never made
Trapped in a world that you never made
Trapped
