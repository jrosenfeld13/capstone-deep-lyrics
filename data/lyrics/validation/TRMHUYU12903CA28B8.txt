People stop fighting
Angels are flying
We can be better
Love is the answer

Search inside
Are there any more tears to cry
(Don't you wonder why?)
Why you feel so alone
All against the world
(World World)
Search back time
When you used to sing alone
(To the music of your soul)
Song of faith you can change
It's not too late

Refren:
People stop fighting
