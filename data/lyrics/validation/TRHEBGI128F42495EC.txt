Version 1
The stained glass lights the way
On their knees the congregation prays
Collection plate is passed your way
Jesus looks down from sky
A tear fills his eyes
In the fires of hell you're all gonna pay

In the rectory basement of sin
A meeting read to begin
Something in the eyes says
Holy father, you're telling me lies
Searching - Mother Mary finds the tunnel of love
Touching - In the name of the lord above

Step Up - Up to the Altar
Kneel Down - Down on your knees and pray
Step Up - Up to the Altar
A priest - Is playing his organ again

Sacrificial bishop cracks the sky
Upon the altar a virgin lies
No hail Mary gonna save you now
Looking - For choir girls and boys
Hoping - He just want a brand new toy

Step Up - Up to the Altar
Kneel Down - Down on your knees and pray
Step Up - Up to the Altar
A priest - Is playing his organ again

Step Up - Up to the Altar
Kneel Down - Down on your knees and pray
Step Up - Up to the Altar
A priest - Is playing his organ again

Version 2
The stained glass lights the way
On their knees the congregation prays
Collection plate is passed your way

Jesus looks down from sky
On their knees the congregation prays
Collection plate is passed your way

Jesus looks down from sky
A tear fills his eyes
In the fires of hell, you're all gonna pay

In the rectory basement of sin
A meeting ready to begin
Something in the eyes says
Holy Father, You're telling me lies

Searchin'
Mother Mary finds the tunnel of love
Touchin'
In the name of the Lord above

Step up, up to the altar
Kneel down, down on your knees and pray
Step up, up to the altar
A priest is playin' his organ again

Sacrificial bishop cracks the sky
Upon the altar a virgin lies
No hail Mary gonna save you now

Looking
For choir girls and boys
Hopin'
He just want a brand new toy

Step up, up to the altar
Kneel down, down on your knees and pray
Step up, up to the altar
A priest is playin' his organ again

Step up, up to the altar
Kneel down, down on your knees and pray
Step up, up to the altar
A priest is playin' his organ again

Crawl to the alter
Play at the alter
[Incomprehensible] at the alter
Die at the alter
