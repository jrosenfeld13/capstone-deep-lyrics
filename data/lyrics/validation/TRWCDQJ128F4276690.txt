Baby, I don't understand
What I feel holdin' your hand
How I'm wantin' you!
What else, then, can I do?

Though I know this love just can't be right
I dream about your body day and night

Yeah, holdin' me so tight

Drivin' me crazy now
Need to keep you around
This feeling that I've found
Knocks my feet off the ground
Drivin' me crazy now
Oh, This love won't let me be
It's deep inside of me
This is our destiny

Best things always come unplanned
When I saw you I was damned
Your soul spoke to me
And heard my silent plea

Aching for your touch always sublime
Wanna see you baby, one more time

And maybe I'll be fine

Drivin' me crazy now
Need to keep you around
This feeling that I've found
Knocks my feet off the ground
Drivin' me crazy now
Oh, this love won't let me be
It's deep inside of me
This is our destiny

And I know this love can not be wrong
When I'm with you startin' to belong

I feel it so strong

Drivin' me crazy now
Got to keep it untold
Our story will unfold
Passion so uncontrolled
Drivin' me crazy now
Although we've lived different lives
I know our love will survive
And harmony will thrive

Drivin' me crazy now
Need to keep you around
This feeling that I've found
Knocks my feet off the ground
Drivin' me crazy now
This love won't let me be
It's deep inside of me
This is our destiny
