This is a new step we are walkin' to a new life
Stupid is trying to a contol the sounds of time
Leave them - live them - grow up and learn
Taste them - keep them - until the end
The goal is still so close
But heard to reach it
We never loose the hope it's a game of patience
Standin' in the wings ready for our turn
Standin' in the wings the light will shine on us one day
How many people are waitin' to see the show
I feel the adrenaline run into my blood
Face them - rock them - put on the fire
Amaze them - catch them - until the end
