All these daggers and these swords
Can't cut me like the words from your lips
Can you feel my fingertips tracing all over your body?
My knees are weak as I whisper softly
While my hands rest on your hips
It takes time to get close enough to you

[Chorus]
I didn't want to be a curse
You won't be the last girl or the first
To tell me I should go straight to hell
For better or for worse
The best news I have ever heard
Was when you said I was doing well

All the doctors and the pills can't cure the way I feel about myself
If I'm afraid to ask for help from everyone
For everything prescribing ends to society
I feel addicted to this prescription
The problem lies within the help
It takes time to get close enough to you

[Chorus]

Let go if it hurts so badly
I just smile and suffer through the pain
I've had enough and I say this sadly
The last year has been driving me insane...

[Chorus]
