I'm gonna tell the man at the IRS this old boy hell I've had enough
'Cause the way the big man rakes it in the little man coughs it up
Well the bite keeps a-getting bigger and the pay check's a getting small
You know the IRS ain't gonna rest until they think they've got it all

They take out the bucks on a lot of folks but listen I ain't one
From now on I'm a-keepin' my pay ain't gonna deduct none
So erase my name from your record take me off your mailin' list
You can write me off 'cause I ain't givin' a dime to the IRS

Well it's hard to keep my hands on my woman
With Uncle Sam's hand in my pant
And if I can't afford the music how in the hell am I gonna dance
Now if everybody kicked in his fair share I might back up and say yes
But the big man plays while the little man pays so to hell with the IRS
C G
They take out the bucks on a lot of folks but sucker I ain't one
From now on I'm a-keepin' my pay ain't gonna deduct none
So put your 1040 form where the sun don't shine
Straighten out your own damn mess
You can write me off 'cause I ain't givin' a dime to the IRS
You can write me off 'cause I ain't givin' a dime to the IRS
