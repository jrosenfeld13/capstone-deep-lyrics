ANEMIC MOON
 Krista Detor, David Weber, and Raymond LeRoy, Cover Their Eyes

You talk so pretty  by the side of the road
Got my dress on - my slip is creeping up
You know, summer's coming slow
All the while you're whistling Dinah won't you blow
I'm gonna hate to see you go

You talk so pretty in your church clothes  hair just right
Thoughts I shouldn't think are creeping in and taking flight
The way you talk to me sounds like original sin
A moment's thrill sold cheaply
On this fanciful flight

CHORUS:
And I count the ways
But I know it, it always ends too soon
In between the light of dream and some anemic moon
And 'love you forever' goes walking out my door
And I don't know if I can bear to think of you anymore

You talk so pretty - like a preacher in the television way
Noble goals and dried up tears like organ grinders play
I thought my love would keep you here
At least beyond today
What will I tell my friends
Now that you've up and gone away?

And I count the ways
But I know it, it always ends too soon
In between the light of dream and some anemic moon
And 'love you forever' goes walking out my door
And I don't know if I can bear to think of you anymore

You talk so pretty - like a poet  like a slippery slope
My dress is wrinkled, brush the dust off with all of my hope
My fallen virtue, sweet excursion, to remember you by
How will I get to heaven now that I've lost the will to try

I count the ways
But I know it always ends too soon -
In between the light of dream and some anemic moon
And 'love you forever' goes walking out my door
And I don't know if I can bear to think of you anymore

I count the ways
But I know it always ends too soon -
In between the light of dream and some anemic moon
And 'love you forever' goes walking out my door
And I don't know if I can bear to think of you anymore
