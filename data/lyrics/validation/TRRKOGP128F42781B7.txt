You may not like the future
And we're not here to preach to you
We'll take you to the killing floor
You think you want to know me
You think you want to own me
But I have nothing you can buy

I can break you
I can raise you
Bring you to your knees
'Cause I'm the one you love to hate
You can't fool me
You can't rule me
You only wanna hang around
'Cause I'm the one you love to hate

So come on get a load of this
Something you can't afford to miss
You're just a vulture in my veins
Your nails won't crucify me
Got money, but you can't see
Your only future is your past

I can break you
I can raise you
Bring you to your knees
'Cause I'm the one you love to hate
You can't fool me
You can't rule me
You only wanna hang around
'Cause I'm the one you love to hate

I can break you
I can raise you
Bring you to your knees
'Cause I'm the one you love to hate
You can't fool me
You can't rule me
You only wanna hang around
'Cause I'm the one you love to hate

I can break you
I can raise you
Bring you to your knees
'Cause I'm the one you love to hate
You can't fool me
You can't rule me
You only wanna hang around
'Cause I'm the one you love to hate
The one you love to hate
'Cause I'm the one you love to hate
The one you love to hate
'Cause I'm the one you love to hate
