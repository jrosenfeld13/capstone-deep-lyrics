You never take her seriously
You're sure that it will pass
As log as it is in your hands
You just won't let it last
And you don't know whose side your on

Know what it means to talk that way
You watch the cars collide
And all the colors that you paint
Are meaningless tonight
But you hold her in your arms
'Cause you feel good 'til you feel wrong
Yeah you feel good until you feel wrong

You blame it on the billboard
That is towering your house
And watches you at five AM
And knows what you're about
So you wait until she's gone
'Cause you feel good 'til you feel wrong
Yeah you feel good until you feel wrong

You say it's all about control
And nothing should control you
If no one ever gets too close
Then you'll have nothing to live up to
And you're waiting to drop the bomb
'Cause you feel good 'til you feel wrong
Yeah you feel good until you feel wrong
