In time, you'll find that it's so calm and serene
But not for now, it'll smash into your dreams
Hey, hey
Inside your mind, you keep everything so clean
But not for now, you're so keen to fill your dreams
If you want me, my feet are planted firmly in your garden
Unattached, in awe, oh, I'm ready for super stardom
If you want to, we could bounce along the road
Like no-one else does
Unavailable to see what'll happen to me
It never happens to me
Oh, and this means nothing to me
It never happens to me
Now you're dedication is so strong
But when your time is up you're gone
Sometimes, I find
That it's so wrong in-between
The times I try
To work out what you mean
Inside your mind, you keep everything pristine
But not for now, you're so keen to fill your dreams
Hey, hey
If you want me, my feet are planted firmly at your back door
I've been tired, I've tried now, I'm ready to declare war
If you want to, we could bounce along the road
Like no-one else does
Unavailable to see what'll happen to me
It's so simple, a stranger's just a stranger that you've not met
Just talk it through and find out if you have yet
It's too easy to find out if there's something here to live for
Unavailable to see what'll happen to me
It never happens to me
Oh, and this means nothing to me
It never happens to me
Now you're dedication is so strong
But when your time is up you're gone
In time, you'll find that it's so calm and discreet
But not for now, the return will be complete
Hey, hey
