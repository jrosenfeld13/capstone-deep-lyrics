Business as usual
Just what's on your mind
Give you some of mine
So the breaks don't come so easy
Hesitate and fall asleep
Taking care of mine

So the crime we find is just human behavior
Everybody's in the line
So the crime we find is just human behavior
Time will find

Little do we really know
The river ego deep and wide
Everybody mission
If I make the wrong decision
Never known is never more
Faster than before

So the crime we find is just human behavior
Everybody's in the line
So the crime we find is just human behavior
Time will find

Yeah-oh, yeah
Yeah-oh
Yeah!
