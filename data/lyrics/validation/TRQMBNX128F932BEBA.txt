[Chorus]
The time has come again
Slowly walking down the steps
To where she would have been
If only they were seventeen

[Verse 1]
Waiting patiently
And stood between a fraying seam
Hiding from himself
As well as everybody else

[Verse 2]
Without permission, his face became wet
He thought that he'd learnt how to not get upset
From folded notes in envelopes
"Meet me beneath the moon, don't go too soon"
She went too soon

[Chorus]
The time has come again
Slowly walking down the steps
To where she would have been
If only they were seventeen
