[Guitar Solo: Jimmy Page]

[Verse 1: Joe Cocker]
What would you do if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
I will try not to sing out of key

[Chorus: Joe Cocker]
Oh, baby I get by (Ah, with a little help from my friends)
All I need is my buddies (Ah, with a little help from my friends)
I say I'm gonna get high (Ah, with a little help from my friends)
Oh yeah (Oooooh)

[Verse 2: Joe Cocker]
What do I do when my love is away?
(Does it worry you to be alone?)
No no
How do I feel by the end of the day?
(Are you sad because you're on your own?)
I tell ya I don't get sad no more

[Chorus: Joe Cocker]
(Ah, with a little help from my friends)
Gonna get by with my friends (Ah, with a little help from my friends)
Yeah yeah, I'm gonna try (Ah, with a little help from my friends)
Keep on getting high, oh Lord (Oooooh)

[Hook 1: Joe Cocker]
(Do you need anybody?)
I need somebody to love
(Could it be anybody?)
All I need is someone
That's just where I'm going, yeah
Somebody knows that's where I'm showing
Baby

[Chorus: Joe Cocker]
(Ah, with a little help from my friends)
Said I'm gonna make it with my friends (Ah, with a little help from my friends)
Oh, I'm gonna keep on trying (Ah, with a little help from my friends)
I'm gonna keep on trying (Ooooh)

[Verse 3: Joe Cocker]
(Would you believe in a love at first sight?)
I'm certain it happens all the time, yeah
(What do you see when you turn out the light?)
I can't tell you but it sure feels like mine

[Chorus: Joe Cocker]
(Ah, with a little help from my friends)
Don't you know I'm gonna make it with my friends? (Ah, with a little help from my friends)
Oh God I said I get by (Ah, with a little help from my friends)
I said I'm gonna try and not work too hard (Oooh)

[Hook 2: Joe Cocker]
(Do you need anybody?)
Well I, yeah yeah yeah
(Could it be anybody?)
Oh there's gotta be somebody

Oh yeah yeah

[Chorus: Joe Cocker]
(Ah, with a little help from my friends)
Said I'm gonna get by with my friends, yeah (Ah, with a little help from my friends)
Oh, yes I'm gonna keep trying, now (Ah, with a little help from my friends)
Keep on trying with my friends (Ah, with a little help from my friends)
Oh, I'm never gonna stop there, oh (Ah, with a little help from my friends)

I'm getting high, I'm gonna try, oh Lord (Ooooooh)
Gonna get by with my friends
