I can tell that I'm a lucky man
Got me friends and a real good band
I don't want for nothin but to do my thing
Play my music and I love to sing

All I need to get some satisfaction
Your true love give me quick reaction
Now I'm able to get along
I know the difference between right and wrong

Time is on my side o yea Time is on my side o yea
Time is on my side o yea Time is on my side o yea

I've been down and I've seen the rain
I paid my dues and I'm still the same
I just want my freedom so I can be myself
To live my life for nobody else

All I need to get some satisfaction
Your true love give me quick reaction
Now I'm able to get along
I know the difference between right and wrong

Time is on my side o yea Time is on my side o yea
Time is on my side o yea Time is on my side o yea
