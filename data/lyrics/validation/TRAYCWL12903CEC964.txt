They came from distance far
Waiting behind the Moonlit sky
Far Away
An ancient lifeform built this race
To call
Cyanide Aliens

Saved we are
Taken Far
Rise of The New Race
Heavenly Supremacy
Creating empires to reign
Eternally and forever more

Like seed in soil mankind is born
Science bred, constructed DNA
When we tried to find the key inside the core
Structure search
Secret deep inside

Saved we are
Taken Far
Rise of The New Race
Heavenly Supremacy
Creating empires to reign
Eternally and forever more

Prevailing Entities
Precendence of the skies
Far Away
They came out from the constellation
Cyanide (created our species) Aliens

Energy supremacy
Majesty
Celesty
Rise of the new race
Saved we are
Taken Far
Creating empires to reign
Eternally and for ever more
