I wanna go outside in the rain
It may sound crazy but I wanna go outside in the rain

I'm crying because of you
Let me go, let me go, let me go

Once the rain starts falling baby
You won't find a trace
I'm crying because of you
Let me go, let me go, let me go

I wanna go outside in the rain
It may sound crazy but I wanna go outside in the rain

I wanna go outside in the rain
It may sound crazy but I wanna go outside in the rain

I wanna go outside in the rain
It may sound crazy but I wanna go outside in the rain
