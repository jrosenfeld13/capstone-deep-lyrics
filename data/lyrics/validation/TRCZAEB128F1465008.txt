Our time is done my love
We've laid it all to waste
One thousand moonlit kisses can't
Sweeten this bitter taste
My desire for you is endless
And I'll love you 'til we fall
I just don't want you no more
And that's the sweetest embrace of all

To think we can find happiness
Hidden in a kiss
Ah, to think we can find happiness
That's the greatest mistake there is
There is nothing left to cling to babe
There is nothing left to soil
I just don't want you no more
And that's the sweetest embrace of all

Ooh, where did it begin
When all we did was lose
There's nothin' left to win

So lay your weapons down
They serve no purpose in your hands
And if you wanna hold me
Then go ahead and hold me
I won't upset your plans
If it's revenge you want
Then take it babe
Or you can walk right out the door
I just don't care anymore
And that's the sweetest embrace of all

Ooh, where did it begin
When all we did was lose
There's nothin' left to win

It's over babe
And it really is a shame
We are losers you and me babe
In a rigged and crooked game
My desire for you is endless
And I love you most of all
I just don't want you no more
And that's the sweetest embrace of all
