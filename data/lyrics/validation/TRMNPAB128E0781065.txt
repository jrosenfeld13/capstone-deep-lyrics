So breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out

Can you feel what I'm feeling now
Every dark cloud's gone away out of sight
Can you feel the relief inside
Every tension dissapeared over night
All that I want is right here in front of me
Now I see what it's all about
No more questions, all my wrongs turn to right

I know what I've got
And I don't wanna be without...

So breathe in, breathe out
This is a new day comin'
Breathe in, breathe out
Let's cherish every mornin'
Don't let anything get you down
Today, the sun is shinin'
So breathe in, breathe out
This is a new day comin'

Let's get up and get on our feet
I can't wait to sieze the day, you and me
Can achieve what we're dreamin' of
So c'mon, we're getting late, gotta go
Everybody's on time
And I don't wanna miss the show
Can you feel what I'm feeling now
Every dark cloud's gone away out of sight

I know what I've got
And I don't wanna be without...

So breathe in, breathe out
This is a new day comin'
Breathe in, breathe out
Let's cherish every mornin'
Don't let anything get you down
Today, the sun is shinin'
So breathe in, breathe out
This is a new day comin'

So breathe in, breathe out
(So breathe in, breathe out)
So breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
This is a new day comin'
So breathe in, breathe out
(Breathe in and breathe out)
Breathe in, breathe out
(This is a new day comin')

So breathe in, breathe out
Can you feel what I'm feelin' now
Breathe in, breathe out
Can you feel the relief inside
Don't let anything get you down
Today, the sun is shinin'
So breathe in, breathe out
This is a new day comin'

So breathe in, breathe out
(breathe in and breathe out)
Breathe in, breathe out
Let's cherish every mornin'
Don't let anything get you down
Can you feel what I'm feelin' now
So breathe in, breathe out
This is a new day comin'
