From Bridget Jones's Diary soundtrack

Verse 1:
Not of this earth
You've changed places with the sun
I know that you're the one
I love what we've become
Not of this earth
I wear you like a shroud
I know I make you cry
You've done your crying now

Chorus:
She is not of this earth
And I'll no longer need to search
If I ever leave this world
You will have a song to sing
So you know what your worth

Verse 2:
Not of this earth
She came walking down my lane
I've learnt to laugh again
Like a moth to a flame
Not of this earth
Not surprised we're unashamed
She's gonna have to change her name
They will know that we're the same

[Chorus:]

Verse 3:
Not of this earth
Better get used to this smile
Not of this earth
Gonna be around for a while

[Verse 1, Verse 2]
Not of this earth...
Not of this earth...
