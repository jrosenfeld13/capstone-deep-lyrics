Evil sick flames cast uncertain shadowsin the dimly lit Temple of
Anhur as we count the dead and vanquished by hacking off their
Phalluses and piling the severed hands before the living stone
Image of God
The shamed and humbled women of the subjugated kneel in hopeless
Aquiescence as we grasp them by the hair and force them to serve
Our father Anhur
Yea we impale them on the massive stone member of the Ithyphallic
War God until the backs of their throats are torn out and their
Bowels are ripped apart
One by one we force the female captives to serve the Ahati until
The Gods legs are awash with blood and his phallus drips with
Red and black gore Un snem sheth tesher mekhsefu parthal m aba
Neth Anhur
We lay our bloodstained weapons of Iron on the altar of Anhur and
His Seed blesses us with strength to slay our enemies Like as unto
Menthu we have become Ithyphallic
The mighty Sekhmet is with us
