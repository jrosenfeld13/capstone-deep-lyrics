[Verse]
When I grow up
I want to be a forester
Run through the moss on high heels
That's what I'll do
Throwing out a boomerang
Waiting for it to come back to me
When I grow up
I want to live near the sea
Crab claws and bottles of rum
That's what I'll have
Staring at the seashell
Waiting for it to embrace me
I put my soul in what I do
Last night I drew a funny man
With dog eyes and a hanging tongue
It goes way bad
I've never liked that sad look
From someone who wants to be loved by you
I'm very good with plants
When my friends are away
They let me keep the soil moist
On the seventh day I rest
For a minute or two
Then back on my feet and cry for you
You've got cucumbers on your eyes
Too much time spent on nothing
Waiting for a moment to arise
The face in the ceiling
And arms too long
I wait for him to catch me

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Waiting for you to embrace me
