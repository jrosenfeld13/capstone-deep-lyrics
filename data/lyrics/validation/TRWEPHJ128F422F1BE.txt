Broken homes as far as the eye can see
Bird's eye view: An ocean surrounded by
Cubicles and fast food restaurants with nothing
But standard utility vehicles and smog in-between
No one knows who is in control but underneath
Them lies a bottomless pit. Everyone clings to
The sides and they use one another to reach the
Crown of it. It's getting oh so dark in here now
He's grabbing at my ankles. I'm grabbing at his
Don't let go! Until all that's left of dreams of Venus
The appendix of a system that doesn't need us
One machine tells the other not to feed us
They only want more. We only want more
We're all getting nowhere confused
Which way is up? Which way is down? I'm falling down
I wonder which moment I decided to care?
Decided to wear the burdens of thousands of years
We all live life like the sun and the moon
Fucking in the afternoon
The light it doesn't get through but it gets by
One machine tells the other not to feed them
They only want more. We only want more. Just let go
Please don't feed the machine
