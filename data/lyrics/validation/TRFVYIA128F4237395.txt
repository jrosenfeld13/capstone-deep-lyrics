Part I  "Talk To Me"

[Intro: Dizzy Wright]
Talk to me

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
I need a girl with the most appeal
Know yourself so you know you real
Powerful with the social skills
Talk to me talk to me
Work smarter and I know she will
God faith and I'm a close the deal
Positive with the dopest feel
Smoke with me smoke with me

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Now we in a healthy stage
26 years and I ain't ever felt this way
But I'm still tryna find my life purpose
No money no options these days
So I smoke and listen to my mentors
Growing might switch your agenda
My mindset is vicious
I do not procrastinate and I never play the victim
Drink henney and vodka but I never mix them
Styling now like Jimi Hendrix
Pussy niggas in my mentions
Where was y'all when we was jumping fences
Now I'm months up in it
All my east side niggas coming with it
We done over did it
Time is ticking
Went from selling tickets
Now I watch my back with what I'm telling bitches

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
I need a girl with the most appeal
Know yourself so you know you real
Powerful with the social skills
Talk to me talk to me
Work smarter and I know she will
God faith and I'm a close the deal
Positive with the dopest feel
Smoke with me smoke with me
I need a girl with the most appeal
Know yourself so you know you real
Powerful with the social skills
Talk to me talk to me
Work smarter and I know she will
God faith and I'm a close the deal
Positive with the dopest feel
Smoke with me smoke with me
Part II  "Don't Hold Back"

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
Give it to me don't hold back
You can be you around me girl
Give it to me don't hold back
Yeah I know I know you ain't used to this
Give it to me don't hold back
You can be you around me girl
Give it to me don't hold back
Yeah I know I know you ain't used to this

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Alive and I'm well in my whip in the late traffic
I smoke this weed when I get around
I told my shorty to simmer down
Jordan's good weather and ash it
Not the first time but I feel fantastic
Not stopping till I got bigger crowds
I see the fake shit that they dishing now
Don't play with me I hardly believe
Anything anyone say to me
Ain't no phasing me
I'm my own king
Look they too focused on the wrong thing
I ain't waiting on no phone rings
These tatts cover me like a long sleeve
Man 9-5 ain't in no pictures now
Keep my faith high when a nigga down
And I told 'em

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
Give it to me don't hold back
You can be you around me girl
Give it to me don't hold back
Yeah I know I know you ain't used to this
Give it to me don't hold back
You can be you around me girl
Give it to me don't hold back
Yeah I know I know you ain't used to this

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
Don't lie to yourself
'Cause your family constantly asking
Why you got mad and just keep it in?
Try to focus on a deeper cleanse
Look here I go saving myself again
You staring but how you gon' learn the moves
Loving my vibe and eternal mood
I see what these suckers are turning to
They like the flow and the concept
She gave me head with the bomb sex
Then we relax in the bath bomb
She like the lunch with the contact
I'm loving learning like everyday
Inspire something you can't take away
Thank you God for creating them seven days
Then I try to come at her a better way
Like

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
Give it to me don't hold back
You can be you around me girl
Give it to me don't hold back
Yeah I know I know you ain't used to this
Give it to me don't hold back
You can be you around me girl
Give it to me don't hold back
Yeah I know I know you ain't used to this
