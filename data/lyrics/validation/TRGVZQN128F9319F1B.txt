I won't leave you out of my will
But I will leave you out of my mind
For now

I won't be there to break your sweet heart
But not being there might break your sweet heart

You are my joy
You are my joy
You are my joy
You are my joy

If I could cradle you into my arms
I would cradle you tight in my arms
Always

So don't be scared of all the hurtful words
Cause in the end, they'll hurt themselves much more

You are my joy
You are my joy
You are my joy
You are my joy
