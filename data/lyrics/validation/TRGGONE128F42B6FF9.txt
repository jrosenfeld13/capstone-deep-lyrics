My fear of heights couldn't stop me
From climbing this high
I set up for the fall
It took nothing more than this
Clean, crisp mountain breeze
And it took nothing more than this
Picture of you in my head
To keep me, to keep me
From the sleep so badly
Unneeded/i need it??
To push me, to push me
Over the edge, over the edge
Into a hole as deep as my regret

What it is to be deceived
Reminds me of this day
That i could never smoke or drink enough to take away
But like the fool i am
That never stop me from trying
This side of you, it made me feel like dying
