See the neon sign
The kids stand in line
And money clutched in hand
They wanna hear that band
Bass is thumpin'
Everybody's jumpin'
The drummer keeps beatin'
Everybody's meet down at Lulu's
Down at Lulu's

It's got you red and blue
The music gets to you
And swept right off your feet
You can't escape that beat
Cause the bass is thumpin'
Everybody's jumpin'
The drummer keeps beatin'
Everybody's meetin' down at Lulu's
Down at Lulu's

The chicks passin' by
Are gonna catch your eye
You may came alone but
That's not how you'll go home
Cause the bass is thumpin'
Everybody's jumpin'
The drummer keeps beatin'
Everybody's meetin
Down at Lulu's
Down at Lulu's
Down at Lulu's
