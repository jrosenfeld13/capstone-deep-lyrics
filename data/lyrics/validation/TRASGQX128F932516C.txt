I'm in a phone booth, baby
Number scratched on the wall
I'm in a phone booth, baby
Number scratched on the wall
I'm new in Chicago
Got no one else to call
Been walkin' all day
For old friends I can't find
Hearts so cold
Had to buy me some wine
Calling you, baby
Took my very last dime
I'm in a phone booth, baby
Number scratched up on the wall
I'm in a phone booth, baby
Number scratched on the wall
I'm new in Chicago
Got no one else to call
Said, "Call big Rita
Anytime, day or night"
You know I'm broke and I'm cold, baby
And I hope you'll treat me right
I'm in a phone booth, baby
With the cold wind right outside
