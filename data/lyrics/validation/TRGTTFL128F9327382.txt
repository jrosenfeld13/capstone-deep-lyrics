Watching the news evert single day
Seeing (how) next door has been emptied
Horrified by the cold fact
That the family could have been killed
Fear of getting killed
Fear of getting robbed
Losing reality, fear takes (over) your life
Advertised safety, trust nobody in sight
Losing reality, fear takes (over) your life
Trust nobody in sight
When are you getting picked?
How to prepare to get robbed?
Distressed when you know
That some day it will be your turn
Living your life in constant fear
Of loosing wealth to the poor people
Invest to protect your home
From the evil thieves in your town
Fear of getting killed
Fear of getting robbed
Losing reality, fear takes (over) your life
Advertised safety, trust nobody in sight
Losing reality, fear takes (over) your life
Tustt nobody in sight
Drive-By shootings
Madmen on highways with guns
Killings haunt your mind
And your pitiful life
Loosing your mind
Fear takes over your life
Choosing the advertised safety
