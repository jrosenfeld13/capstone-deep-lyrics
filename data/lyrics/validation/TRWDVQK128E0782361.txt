There's an image of you
Staring in a baker's window
Sold to the parents of
A gift to the little girl
A present on their child's birthday

Breaking up is hard to do
Breaking up is hard to do
Breaking up is hard to do
Especially with you
Especially with you

Said you'd leave by Christmas
Said you'd leave by June
Stop drinking for a while
That's a compromise
Maybe go and see an adult movie

Breaking up is hard to do
Breaking up is hard to do
Breaking up is hard to do
Especially with you
Especially with you

And on your birthday
You're twenty two
Someone's anniversary
Breaking up is hard to do

Breaking up is hard to do
Breaking up is hard to do
Breaking up is hard to do

Especially with you
Especially with you
Especially with you
Especially with you

You don't return my calls
Messages not received
Well, that's complacent and rude
Abandon your second man
Go out and see a band
Breaking up is hard to do

Breaking up is hard to do
Breaking up is hard to do
Breaking up is hard to do

Especially with you
Especially with you
Especially with you
Especially with you
