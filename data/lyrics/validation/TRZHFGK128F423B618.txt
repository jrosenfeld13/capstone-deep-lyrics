Woo!

I been away too long
I've come from searchin' Hell for you
But while I've been away, each and every day
My heart was really next to you

Oh yeah

Now I'm here at last
And I mean to stay
Look into my eyes, then you'll realize
There is only one thing left to say

Whoa...

Tell me (tell me you love me)
Be right there (tell me you care)
Tell me, tell me, tell me baby (tell me you love me)
Come on, come on (tell me you care)
Oooh (tell me you love me)
I really love ya! (tell me you care)
You know I need ya! (tell me you love me)
Come on, baby now (tell me you care)

I'm not asking for much, yeah
Dreamin' and wishin' you know
If you some sweet feelin', I'm ready and willing
To take you where you wanna go

Tell me (tell me you love me)
Come on, come on baby (tell me you care)
Let me hear you, let me hear you now (tell me you love me)
Ooh yeah, yeah oh! (tell me you care)
How sweet do you want it? (tell me you love me)
Come on, baby! (tell me you care)
