[Verse 1]
Are you aware of what you make me feel, baby?
Right now, I feel invisible to you
Like I'm not real
Didn't you feel me lock my arms around you?
Why'd you turn away?
Here's what I have to say

[Pre-Chorus]
I was left to cry there
Waiting outside there
Grinning with a lost stare
That's when I decided...

[Chorus]
Why should I care?
'Cause you weren't there when I was scared
I was so alone
You, you need to listen
I'm starting to trip
I'm losing my grip, and I'm in this thing alone

[Verse 2]
Am I just some chick you place beside you to take somebody's place?
When you turn around, can you recognize my face?
You used to love me, you used to hug me
But that wasn't the case
Everything wasn't okay

[Pre-Chorus]
I was left to cry there
Waiting outside there
Grinning with a lost stare
That's when I decided...

[Chorus]
Why should I care?
'Cause you weren't there when I was scared
I was so alone
You, you need to listen
I'm starting to trip
I'm losing my grip, and I'm in this thing alone

[Bridge]
Crying out loud
I'm crying out loud
Crying out loud
I'm crying out loud

[Breakdown]
Open your eyes
Open up wide
Why should I care?
'Cause you weren't there when I was scared, I was so alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Why should I care?
'Cause you weren't there when I was scared
I was so alone

[Final Chorus]
Why should I care?
'Cause you weren't there when I was scared
I was so alone
Why should I care?
If you don't care, then I don't care
We're not going anywhere
Why should I care?
'Cause you weren't there when I was scared
I was so alone
Why should I care?
If you don't care, then I don't care
We're not going anywhere
