Oh Christine your love, I saw it drinking at the bar just the other night
Under ceiling of light. Old time marigolds, I saw you winking at the
Stars in the warring night, if I saw you right?

You were galloping down the road, past my home to be sure
If I take my time, will I make it back?

Oh blight life you're parable, I saw you smoking in the bar just
The other night, if I saw you right?
Oh matrimonial, I saw you drinking at the bar just the other day
What's that I heard you say?

You were galloping down the road, past my home to be sure
If I changed my life, over the flames of the road

Oh Christine our love, I saw it drinking at my home just the other
Night, under a ceiling of right
And old matrimonial, I saw you drinking in the photos on my wall
Stoned as a kite

You came bearing gifts to the ghosts, past my home to be sure
Past the sheet on the street, the corner of Blanchard and Bell
