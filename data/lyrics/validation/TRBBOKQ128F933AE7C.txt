Knelt a puppet on a string
Along the vortex weeping
Lord have you heard
The roaring dragon eat the virgin
I didn't know yet what I'd know
When I was bleedin'
I seem to forget what I learned
When I was fallin'
I didn't know yet what I'd know
When I was bleedin'
Neon ghost in mask and coat
My heart is satellite remote
When my chemicals go wrong
Murder the devil
Take his song for my own
We sang
I didn't know yet what I'd know
When I was bleedin'
I seem to forget what I learned
When I was fallin'
I didn't know yet what I'd know
When I was bleedin'
When I was fallin'
Was I flyin'?
