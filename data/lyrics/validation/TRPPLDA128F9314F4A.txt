[Verse 1]
Just leave it to me
Don't ever be ashamed
Just give me a chance
I'll take care of everything

[Verse 2]
Your troubles I'll share
Let me know and I'll be there
I'll stay close to you
Anyplace and anywhere

[Chorus]
Shake a hand, shake a hand
Shake a hand if you can

[Verse 3]
Be truthful to me
I'll be truthful to you
I'm in love with you so
Till I don't know what to do

[Verse 4]
So, let's call it a day
I said all I have to say
Except don't forget to pray
And shake a hand every day

[Chorus]
