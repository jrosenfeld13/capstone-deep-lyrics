I want to know where are you tonight (tonight)
Tonight (tonight)
I want to know where are you tonight (tonight)
Tonight (tonight)
I've got to know (where are you) girl I've got to find you

I look at the moon and a single star
It's making me crazy wondering where you are
I reach out and touch that heavenly face
Open my hand and there's empty space

Oh no, where are you tonight (tonight)
Tonight (tonight)
I've got to know where are you tonight baby

The sink and the dishes spent the weekend there
Should clean up the place but I just don't care
Tonight I'll be talking to the moon and that star
Maybe they'll tell me where on earth you are

Oh no, where are you tonight (tonight)
Tonight (tonight)
I've got to know where are you tonight

Please believe me when you leave me
Keeps me worrying through the night
Worry baby makes me crazy
Can't tell wrong from right
Come to me tonight

I want to know where are you tonight (tonight)
Tonight
I'got to know where are you tonight (tonight)
Don't you hear me calling to you baby
Where are you tonight (tonight)
Tonight (tonight)
I'got to know where are you baby
Where are you tonight (tonight)
I'got to know where are you tonight baby baby
Baby, baby, just give me some kind of sign, girl
Come to me, baby
Baby of what you do to
