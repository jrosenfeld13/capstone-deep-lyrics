I swore that I was living free
Oh, you couldn't talk to me
And the pride that kept me, didn't want no company
Early morning subway train
Feeling lost and running late
Well, he held the car, he gave his seat to me

And I can't find nothing feels so fine as loving
A good hearted man
Oh he can soothe me, free me, oh I'm gonna marry
That good hearted man

I told him that he'd better go
'Cause I was crazy and impossible
That my love was broken, my dreams had run off wild
Patient as the easy rain
Oh he never turned away
Calling, "Hey sweet woman, you know you're not a child."

And I can't find nothing feels so fine as loving
A good hearted man
Oh he can soothe me, free me, oh I'm gonna marry
That good hearted man

Good hearted man, now the night makes sense
Because your tenderness is sheltering me

So I'm trading in that hothead kid
For a woman I can give to him
And it ain't easy, but I'm gonna do the best I can
For that good hearted man

You know there just ain't nothing feels so fine as loving
A good hearted man
Oh he can soothe me, free me, oh I'm gonna marry
That good hearted man
Oh and I'm grateful, grateful, got to say thank you
To a good hearted man
