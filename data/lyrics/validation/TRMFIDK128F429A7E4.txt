There's a man on corner and his clothes are worn
And he's holding out his hand
You can see in his eyes as the people walk by
He knows they don't understand

You see, they just think he's gonna take their money
And then go and spend it on dope
Then a man stopped by him and I saw a smile inside
As he gently whispered hope

Well the tramp started to cry, just kept saying
Why, why, why? Can't you see I'm a down-and-out
I'm 32 and I've got this one pair of shoes
And a bad taste in my mouth

I think it's clear to see that even God don't love me
Or else why would He leave me this way
Then Gabriel just smiled and said "Be at peace my child
Salvation is here today."

He got up to his feet and he sang Hallelujah
People were turning around in the street
He looked them in the eyes and he sang Hallelujah
There's someone here you gotta meet
Someone you just gotta meet

When the vagabond turned around, well without a sound
Gabriel just smiled and disappeared
When he looked to the crowd they were laughing out loud
But he could not see them for tears

When his vision came round there was a young girl on the ground
And he knew she was finding it hard to cope
She never was a fighter until he laid beside her
And gently whispered hope

They got up to their feet and they sang Hallelujah
People in the street were turning around
They looked them in the eyes and they sang Hallelujah
Oh, there's someone here that we have found

They sang, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
We are the voices crying in the wilderness
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
The people in the street started their sins to confess and a chorus of
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Every knee will bow and every tongue confess
And the voice of one crying in the wilderness
Crying out Hallelujah, Hallelujah
