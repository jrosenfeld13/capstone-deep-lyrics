Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
I'm fine
I'll be fine until the morning comes
Then unmask me in the blistering sun

Oh let me go
Just let me go
Just let me go
Or I'll burst in front of your eyes
Then collect myself from the ground

And when I go
And when I go
Just let me go
Like a light
Flickering out in the skies
Lost as fast as was found

[Chorus]
Everything is easy when you never have to choose
But the balance has shifted and we're forced to lose
Like the sun and the moon I will circle you til you bloom
I will crush I will maul I will burn until I get to you

Lay low
Don't let me know when it's real
Will they quietly follow me here?
Will they take me as their own?
Now I will hold you I will keep you I'll control my love
Until it folds in my hands
But I'll build it back to the top

[Chorus]
Everything is easy when you never have to choose
But the balance has shifted and we're forced to lose
Like the sun and the moon I will circle you til you bloom
I will crush I will maul I will burn until I get to you

[outro] (x4)
Feel it rain!
Feel it rain!
We're alive!
Feel it rain!
Feel it rain!
Feel it rain!
We're alive!
Feel it rain!
Feel it rain!
Feel it rain!
We're alive!
Feel it rain!
Feel it rain!
Feel it rain!
We're alive!
Feel it rain!
