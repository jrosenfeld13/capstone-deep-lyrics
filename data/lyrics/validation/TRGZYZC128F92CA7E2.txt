[Verse 1]
Last night I found heaven
It's on the tip of my tongue
And it reminded me of
All the times I was young
I'm catching rain in my open mouth
I used to smile till the day I found out
I have no idea who the hell I've become
It's not who I was, it's not who I love

[Chorus]
I want to drown in a sea filled with Novocaine
I want to burn on a beach where the sand
Has thousands of needles poking at my skin

[Verse 2]
I lie in bed to the sound
Of the wolves at my door
They are speaking in tongues
While they claw at my floor
I never thought it would come to this
I'm more yellow than my own piss
They're making rounds
Just to even the score
Just open the door
Just open the door

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I can't hold on, the path is clear
I can't ignore, what's been building for years
There's wolves at the door, I won't hide here in fear
Wolves at the door
I look at myself and the things that I've done
Stare away from the mirror and right into the sun
I forgive myself for all of my mistakes
When will I learn, when will I, when will I burn?

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I gave up on myself a long time ago
To the black clouds I'm swallowed
And spit me out whole
Sometimes it feels like I'm losing my soul
At least that means
I still have a soul after all
