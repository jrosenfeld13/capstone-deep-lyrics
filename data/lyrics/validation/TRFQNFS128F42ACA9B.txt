Oh, nothing changes round here, oh, nothing changes round here
Oh, no
Oh, but I see you now on the outskirts of town
But the fog gets so heavy

La-la-la-la-la

But if you're looking for comforting words, so long
Just don't tell me that you loved me all along
But if you're looking for famous last words, so long
Just don't tell me that you loved me all along

I saw your sister last night, and we danced, danced, danced
But that was all
But I see you now on the outskirts of town
But the fog gets so heavy

La-la-la-la-la

But if you're looking for comforting words, so long
Just don't tell me that you loved me all along

And your face so full of gloom, so I booked ourselves a room
And took what every teenage boy in town wanted
And you chose me
And then you disappeared from our lives
Sacred things were on your horizon
I demanded an explanation
You said that I was not your father
And you owed me none

Oh, nothing changes round here
Oh, nothing changes round here
Anymore, anymore, anymore

La-la-la-la-la

But if you're looking for comforting words, so long
Just don't tell me that you loved me all along
But if you're looking for famous last words, so long
Just don't tell me that you loved me all along
Don't, just don't tell me that you loved me all along

La-la-la
La-la-la
La-la-la
