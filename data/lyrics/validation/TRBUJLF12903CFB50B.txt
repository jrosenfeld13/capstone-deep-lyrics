How does it feel when you're left sitting out in the cold?
How does it feel when you don't have nobody to hold?
I wanna know, does it really, really hurt you so?
Are you crying? Are you dying?

Do you want her like I wanted you before?
How does it feel to just stare at the ceiling all night?
How do you feel knowing someone is holding her tight?
Please tell me true, are you really really feeling blue?

Do you miss her, wanna kiss her?
Do you need her like I needed you before?
When you walked out on me, I felt like you're feeling now
But I'd take you back again 'cause I still love you, anyhow

I wanna know, does it really really hurt you so?
Are you crying? Are you dying?
Do you want her like I wanted you before?
