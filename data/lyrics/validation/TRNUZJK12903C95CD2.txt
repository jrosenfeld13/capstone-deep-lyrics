Everybody crashes down
Sometimes
Everything comes falling down
Sometimes
I dont even know how
Or know why

CHORUS
The thing I cant escape is You
The promise that You made is You will pull me through
Youre never far away no matter what I do
The thing I cant escape is You

At times I try to hide away
From Your eyes
At times Im covered up in shame
From my lies
You sweep me into Your embrace
And I cry

CHORUS

Its You
Your grace
Irresistible
Its true, its true
Your grace
Irresistible
