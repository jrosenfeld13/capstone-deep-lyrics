I don't know if you can see
The changes that have come over me
In these last few days I've been afraid
That I might drift away
So I've been telling old stories, singing songs
That make me think about where I came from
And that's the reason why I seem
So far away today

(Chorus:)
But let me tell you that I love you
And that I think about you all the time
Caledonia you're calling me and now I'm going home
But if I should become a stranger
You know that it would make me more than sad
Caledonia's been everything I've ever had

I have moved and I've kept on moving
Proved the points that I needed proving
Lost the friends that I needed losing
Found others on the way
I have kissed the ladies and left them crying
Stolen dreams, yes there's no denying
I have travelled hard sometimes with conscience flying
Somewhere with the wind

(Chorus)
Now I'm sitting here before the fire
The empty room the forest choir
The flames that couldn't get any higher
They've withered now they've gone
But I'm steady thinking my way is clear
And I know what I will do tomorrow
When the hands are shaken and the kisses flow
Then I will disappear

(Chorus)
