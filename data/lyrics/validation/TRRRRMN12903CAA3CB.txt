[Intro]
Nobody moves til we say go

[Verse 1]
Tired, broke, and winded
We get low percentage
So, I'm so committed
And I'm so commended
But when I say it's to the death
That's open ended
I might never die
'Til bosses is croaked and ended
I might never rhyme unless I put Oakland in it
I might never sleep til this flyer's wrote and printed
This may not be spoken proper
I'm smilin' holding choppers
Foot on the coppers
In the photo finish

[Pre-Chorus]
Nobody moves 'til we say go, nobody moves 'til we say go
Nobody moves 'til we say go, nobody moves 'til we say go

[Chorus]
Go!
Nobody moves 'til we say go (go! go!)
Nobody moves 'til we say go (go! go!)
Nobody moves 'til we say go (go! go!)
Nobody moves 'til we say go (go! go!)

[Verse 2]
In a coat of linen
Not just quotin' Lenin
Strike a blow and hit 'em
Like the cobras totin' venom
I'm your co-defendant
This system's broke and bended
Them millionaires on TV
That's a token image
Plus they're owned and rented
The most we get is a car with spokes and tinted
Let's get loc'd and win it
We can slow their business
'Til their dough diminish
When they meet these demands
We'll be foldin' spinach

[Pre-Chorus]
Nobody moves 'til we say go, nobody moves 'til we say go
Nobody moves 'til we say go, nobody moves 'til we say go

[Chorus x2]
Go!
Nobody moves 'til we say go (go! go!)
Nobody moves 'til we say go (go! go!)
Nobody moves 'til we say go (go! go!)
Nobody moves 'til we say go (go! go!)
