Felt your hollow planet day
I'm fine
Especially when you're far away
Sunshine

She's always on my mind
Like a filter in my head

She's always on my mind
Poring factories in my bed
Bet you're fancy custom made

I'm sick all of the time
And I'm tired all the time
And I wanted you to know
I wanted you to know
Your time has come

Believe me all the time
I'm seeing all the signs
And I wanted you to know
I wanted you to know
Your time has come

Swallowed your past
Followed your heart
Doesn't it hurt?
Was it all for fun?

Buried your soul
Unfilled yourself
Laid on your mountains
Warm with yourself

Just try to erase her
Unchanges the question
Just shy of survival
Raises all of your guns

Just try to erase her
Abandon your outcome
Then tell me your nothing
Your time has come
