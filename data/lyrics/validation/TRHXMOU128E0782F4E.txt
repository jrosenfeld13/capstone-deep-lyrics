(I've been a fool) I've been a fool, again
Doesn't matter what I do
(I've been a fool) I've been a fool, fool again
Doesn't matter what I do
(I've been a fool) I've been a fool
Can't stop myself from drowning

Nothing standing in your way, feeling good
And girls want to check you out, looking good
'Cos shops want to let you in, 'cos you've been a fool
You just can't help it

Suddenly it seems worthwhile, life's a gas
And just when it all goes right, working out
And just when I hit that high, I am a fool
Just can't help it

(I've been a fool) I've been a fool, again
Doesn't matter what I do
(I've been a fool) I've been a fool
Can't stop myself from drowning

Nothing left to get you down, feeling good
And know that you're always right, thank the lord
As cars swerving out your way, and you are a fool
You just can't help it

Suddenly you get mixed up, feeling bad
And everything you do is wrong, looking bad
And feel that you're out of touch, you've been a fool
Just can't help it

(I've been a fool) I've been a fool, again
Doesn't matter what I do
(I've been a fool) I've been a fool, fool again
Doesn't matter what I do
(I've been a fool) I've been a fool
Can't help myself from drowning

Just when I take one step forward and two back...

(I've been a fool) I've been a fool, again
Doesn't matter what I do
(I've been a fool) I've been a fool, fool again
Doesn't matter what I do
(I've been a fool) I've been a fool
Can't stop myself from drowning, yeah
