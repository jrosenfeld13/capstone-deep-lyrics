Mary loves the grouse, hides the bottles round the house
She watches chatshows and the soaps, broken-hearted but she copes
Michael's out of work, feels he's sinking in the murk
He's unshaven and a mess, finds it hard some days to dress
Stevie smashes the delf, 'cause he can't express himself
He's consumed by rage, like his father at his age
Rita's little child, has a lovely little smile
This means nothing to her father, because he's never even seen her
We sing, sing all our cares away
We'll live, to fight another day
Joey's off the gear, he's been clean for half a year
He gets bored out of his mind, but he's tryin to toe the line
Maggie's in a chair, 'twas joyriding put her there
She puts the kettle on the boil, and she's always got a smile
We sing, sing all our cares away
We'll live, to fight another day
We sing, sing all our cares away
We'll live, to love another day
We grow strong, from it all
We grow strong, or we fall
We grow strong, from it all
We grow strong, or we fall
We grow strong
