I got a brand new aeroplane
I saw it yesterday
I'm coming 'round to see you
So you really got to say that
Look we've got a metal house
Look we've got a game
Look here comes my aeroplane
To take us all away while

Up in my plane
Looking for my destination

Everybody's looking up
They're staring at the sky
Look here comes my aeroplane
Bringing us the stuff
Look here comes my heavy bird
Get a suit to wear
Look at all the houses
They're dancing in the air while

Up in my plane
I'm coming down if you want me

Up in my plane
Up in my plane
Up in my plane
Up in my plane
