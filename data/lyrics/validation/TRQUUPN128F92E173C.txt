Y'all ready for this?

Get down with the sound, house on the ground
Freeze when I squeeze, drop to your knees
You must of bet, I'm in here to stay
Ready to take you around the way

So you get ready for this, mind your own biz
'Cause I am bad, yeah the microphone wiz
No need to sit, 'cause we're 2 Unlimited
Ready, ready, ready for this

Feel the base, you just get closer
Be impressed by the words I chose of
Once again kickin' it live
Doin' everything yo just to survive

Above the law, I take our stand
Being on stage with a mic in my hand
Bustin' it loud to the crowd
The age is 20, I'm from the south

Be a part, break my heart
Get ready for this, mind your own biz
People in the front, show me what you want
And I won't give it in, get ready for this

We're 2 Unlimited, so people won't you sing?
Movin' up and down, dancin' on the ground
Feelin' kinda free, security
How's this sound, that moves you from the ground

House on the ground, bass in your face
Racin' the place, no time to waste
Being hypnotized, I can see it in your eyes
Feelin' kinda better, put on your sweater

Feelin' like a white, I think it doesn't matter
Super, dope, def, and even outrageous
If I was an animal, they'd 've kept me in cages
So get ready for this

Y'all ready for this?

Be a part, break my heart
Get ready for this, mind your own biz
People in the front, show me what you want
And I won't give it in, get ready for this

We're 2 Unlimited, so people won't you sing?
Movin' up and down, dancin' on the ground
Feelin' kinda free, security
How's this sound, that moves you from the ground
