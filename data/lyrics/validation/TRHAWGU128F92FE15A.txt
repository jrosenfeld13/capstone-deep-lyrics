You've got to believe in something
It's a lonely universe
Be careful what you wish for
Cause your improvement might be worse
Birth is a missing persons file
It's a case of role reversal
Life is a play...
Sometimes I can remember the rehearsal
You've got to believe in nothing
There's an awful lot out there
There's an awful lot in make up
Some in every perfect hair
You know I lose a lot of sleep
Wondering if nothing would ever desert us
But I know they don't know nothing
And what they don't know can't hurt us
I want to tell you
This guy wants to charge you a nickel
I want to tell you
This guy wants to charge you a dime
I want to tell you
I'm 'o' charge you a five dollar bill
And show you a real fine time
Real fine time
There's a candy coated iguana
Behind curtain number one
And a sixteen dollar bill
For every pregnant flying nun
They got a soda-pop that'll save the wold
It's a tonic and an elixir
It's a get-you-laid
Better-paid
Guaranteed all-round life-fixer
I want to tell you
This guy wants you to change a twenty
I want to tell you
This guy wants you to change a ten
I want to tell you
This guy knows you already did it
But he wants you to do it again
Do it again
You've got to believe in something
It's a lonely universe
Be careful what you wish for
Cause your improvement might be worse
Birth is a missing persons file
It's a case of role reversal
Life is a play, they say
Sometimes I can remember the rehearsal
I want to tell you
Some say life is a blessing
I want to tell you
Some say life is a curse
I want to tell you
Some say life is a play
But you get no time to rehearse
And you got to believe in something
Cause it's a lonely universe
You got to believe in something
