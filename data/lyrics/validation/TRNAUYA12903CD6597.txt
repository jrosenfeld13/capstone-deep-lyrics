A mass of emptied minds, docil imitators, we never try to see the truth
Corrupted to the core, we are breeding in the vaccum, our words are useless noise
Automaton chained to common patterns, so inane
Fuck now! adaptable, manipulated, you consume and then, you're erased
Shit! submit to system pressure, programmed to never deviate

We 've learned to hide, to blame, to follow, to never askin'why
We only want to be quiet, to be safe... we're blind

Could we choose to live, could we choose to exist?
Trapped into descent, just waiting to revive

We've locked our soul, so close to the other, but so far
We remain so cold inside, running in reverse, in destruction we smile

Could we choose to live, could we choose to exist?
Trapped into descent, just waiting to revive

Plunged in delusion, as a puppet marching to the sound of lies
In cruelty we collide, slave to delusion, we define this perfect lake of courage
Reflecting in our eyes, all things now retaken, all things we've forgotten
(All things we've forgotten)

We 've learned to hide, to blame, to follow, to never askin'why
We only want to be quiet, to be safe... we're blind

Control, it's what it's all about: trust the pigs and eat their shit
We don't give about truth, we're just leaving into dream of perfect norm
Without recognition for misery

Could we choose to live, could we choose to exist?
Trapped into descent, so down, just waiting to revive again
Could we choose to live, could we choose to exist?
Trapped into descent, so down, just waiting to revive again
