Buried words
Under lights
Soundtrack to this stagnant life
This meaning lost in translation
Message sucked out of his hands again

This could be my great awakening
But how would I know
Cuz it's all noise to me
Are these words falling on deaf ears?

Staring at the empty stares
Realize that he no longer cares about the wrong or right
The downward spiral begins tonight

And this could be my great awakening
But how would I know cuz it's all noise to me
Are these words falling on deaf ears?

And this could be my great awakening
But how would I know cuz it's all noise to me
Nothing I can do will make you hear
