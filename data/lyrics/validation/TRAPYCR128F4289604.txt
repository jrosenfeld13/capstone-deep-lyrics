Says shes got another life
That I am living in my friend
Through and through she says
Its nothing I can change
I always was the one

The celebration ends without a sound
And the friends theyre not around
And you find youre all alone
Talking to yourself again
You promised its the end
Just one night youll be fine
Cause in the end the dreams you dream
Are all you ever were

CHORUS:
Shes got another life
That I am living in my friend
Through and through she says
Its nothing I can change
I always was the one
And She'll say
Come on Id like to buy the world a Coke and lie here naked with my girl

The lights dim once again someday Ill sleep
Cause its all the same to me
This tiny voice inside my head keeps me awake
Come on lets find the cure
Come on lets die until we live
In the end youll find how high you climbed
Theres no design to ever bring you down

Shes got another life
That I am living in my friend
Through and through she says
Its nothing I can change
She always was the one
And I'll say
Come on Id like to buy the world a Coke and lie here naked with my girl

And she knows..
