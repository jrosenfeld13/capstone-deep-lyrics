Just an old faded photograph of you
One I always will treasure more than gold
It keeps reminding me of bygone times dear
A keepsake of a love that won't grow old

Though the old faded photograph is dim
In my heart there's a picture same as new
As the years go passing by all alone I sit and cry
Over an old faded photograph of you
[ fiddle - steel - guitar ]
Whenever I may be at any time
Your picture always hangs upon the wall
It keeps reminding me of bygone times dear
Can't I help it if the teardrops fall
Though the old faded photograph is dim...
