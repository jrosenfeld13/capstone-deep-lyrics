Little boys and little girls dream of big, big things
They're taught at a tender age just what life should bring
Get a job, say I do and settle yourself down
But what about those of us whose lives are still spinnin' around

Tell me what's so great about picket fences
Paintin' them's such a mess
And a big back yard where kids can play
I'd probably never get a moment's rest
And settin' the table for five at five
Only means more dishes to load
What's so great about picket fences
I guess I'll never know

Here I am in my prime, at least they tell me so
And if I go to sleep at night I always go alone
I guess that I could have it all and someone by my side
But I can't take the give and take the price is just too high

Tell me what's so great about picket fences
Paintin' them's such a mess
And a big back yard where kids can play
I'd probably never get a moment's rest
And settin' the table for five at five
Only means more dishes to load
What's so great about picket fences
I guess I'll never know
Tell me what's so great about picket fences
I guess I'll never know
