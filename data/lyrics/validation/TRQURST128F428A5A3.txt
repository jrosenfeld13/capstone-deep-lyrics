[Verse 1]
Rage burns, can't push it aside now
Can't forgive, this grudge is alive now
All the rage eats you up inside
Can you leave it behind
Leave it behind

[Verse 2]
What a surprise
You're fucked with again, yeah
It's a way of life you need to get over
All the rage just eats you alive
Can you leave it behind
Leave it behind

[Chorus]
I don't know where it'll end
The sun has set
And I can't be friends
I don't know if I can forgive
The day is long
But you were so dead wrong

[Verse 2]
What a surprise
You're fucked with again, yeah
It's a way of life you need to get over
All the rage just eats you alive
Can you leave it behind
Leave it behind

[Chorus]
I don't know where it'll end
The sun has set
And I can't be friends
I don't know if I can forgive
The day is long
But you were so dead wrong
