You're looking so beautiful
Standing in the light
I've waited for this night
For my whole life
I reach to grab your hand
I take it into mine
Our hearts become numb
Our hearts have become one
And I'll wait for you
If our world's falling down
Crumbling to the ground
And I'll wait for you
If our world's falling down
Crumbling to the ground
With this honor
On weak knees I stand
Strengthened by your hands
As the music starts to play
That look upon your face
I see what's in your eyes
You see what's inside mine
We see our life together
We feel it as we dance
There's rhythm in our love
It's rhythm from above
And I'll wait for you
If our world's falling down
Crumbling to the ground
With this honor
On weak knees I stand
Strengthened by your hands
With this honor
On weak knees I stand
Strengthened by your hands
With this dance our life begins
With these steps love has no end
With this dance our life begins
And I'll wait, and I'll wait
With this honor
On weak knees I stand
Strengthened by your hands
With this honor
On weak knees I stand
Strengthened by your hands
With this honor
On weak knees I stand
Strengthened by your hands
With this honor
On weak knees I stand
Strengthened by your hands
[Incomprehensible]
Strengthened by your hands
