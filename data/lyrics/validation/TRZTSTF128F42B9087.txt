Give me a drink
I need some time to think this over
Should I go through that door?
I wanna be sure tonight
The girls look pale and the liquor is stale and I'm sober
The place is packed with brats and infested by rats
And I don't wanna put up a fight
On the edge of being jaded
But it's the little things that could have me persuaded
So if you play real tight and you're not too light
I might come see you tonight

It's a crack in the wall
The guys are way too tall
And the ladies make too much noise and I do have a choice tonight
I can lay on the couch and refuse to go out
But maybe if the band's not crap and I don't drink from the tap
It really could be out of sight
But the dudes - they never give me a break
And a can in my head is more than I can take
But if you're not too light and you get it on right
I might come see you tonight

I'll come see you tonight
If you really get it on all right
I'll come see you tonight
If you really get it on

So here comes the band - the baddest in the land, oh really
Well, see if I care 'bout the clothes that you wear
The latest fad ain't gonna get you nowhere
But if you play real tight and you're not too light
I might come see you tonight
