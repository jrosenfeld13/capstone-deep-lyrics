You can take a boy out of the field
But that don't make him clean
You've made my life easier, baby
But that don't make it any less obscene

Just `cause you're acting so nice
Don't mean you'll get a thing from me
Don't throw your pennies in the wishing well
Cause what you get, is what you see

Lord, I'm a simple man
Ain't too much I need
Well, I ain't askin for all of your love
Give me what ya can
And set me free

You screamed and cried all night long
Lord, you're killing me
I never meant to put you down
And never gave you any reason to grieve

Sometimes when I feel so boxed in
I wanna go and take a ride
Grabbed the keys and my cigarettes
And disappeared into the night

Lord I'm a simple man
Ain't too much I need
I ain't askin' for all of your love
Gimme what you can
And set me free
Lord c'mon set me free

You lead this old horse to a bar
And you can buy me a drink
You lead me just about anywhere
Sometimes I'm just too tired to think

Never took anything from you
That I couldn't return twice
Never understand how I never
Listen to my own advice

Lord, I'm a simple man
Ain't too much I need
Well, I ain't askin for all of your love
Give me what ya can
And set me free

I ain't askin' for all of your love
I ain't askin' for all your love
I ain't askin' for all of your love
Give me what you can
And set me free
