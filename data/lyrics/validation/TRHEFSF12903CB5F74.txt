I don't know where we went so wrong
You were right there but somehow my friend had gone
Okay we got broken but we could start again
It could be like the old days
If we could just pretend

Let's make it feel like the first time and start from now
Tape over the memories of last time but learn somehow
Leave the words we said behind and when we fall asleep
Let's make it feel like the first time

I don't know all the words to say
Know how to please you not how to relieve your pain
One day we'll look back and we'll laugh out loud
It could be like the old days
We'll paint this whole damn town

Let's make it feel like the first time and start from now
Tape over the memories of last time but learn somehow
Leave the words we said behind and when we fall asleep
Let's make it feel like the first time

We're down to our last chance now
Forget that you know me inside out

Let's make it feel like the first time and start from now
Tape over the memories of last time but learn somehow
Leave the words we said behind and when we fall asleep
Let's make it feel like the first time
