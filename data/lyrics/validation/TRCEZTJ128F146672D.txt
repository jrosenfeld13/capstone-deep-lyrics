I'm a man, I'm a man such a loving man
Understand that I'm strong and I know I belong
That's why there's no way you can say what you say
Without feeling that way I got to go away
Got to go away ain't playing swaying
I ain't making no waves make no promises
There's no second best more or less win or lose
I'm looking for the truth, looking for the truth yea

It's the real thing
Just what love can bring

Chorus
Be whipped from the outside
Be whipped from the inside
Be whipped from the outside
Whipped from the inside looking for something
Don't know what I want, oh oh
Don't know what I want, oh oh
Know what I want

It's a shame, it's a shame must get out of this shell
Feel life so sweet happiness complete
Is it possible I can come to terms
So I come to learn just what I believe
Drop the act it's a fact there's a master plan
There's always a plan 'cause you will and you can
What you know you don't know so admit and commit
Be a part of my world, be a part of my world yeah

Be a part of my world
See this side of my world

Chorus
Be whipped from the outside
Be whipped from the inside
Be whipped from the outside
Whipped from the inside looking for something
Don't know what I want, oh oh
Don't know what I want, oh oh
Know what I want

Ah ah ah ah see what I feel
Ah ah ah future is clear ah ah
Baby do you see what I see
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Let me tell you what I feel
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

It's the real thing
Only just what love can bring

Chorus
Be whipped from the outside
Be whipped from the inside
Be whipped from the outside
Whipped from the inside looking for something
Be whipped from the outside
Be whipped from the inside
Be whipped from the outside
Whipped from the inside looking for something
Don't know what I want, oh oh
Don't know what I want, oh oh
Don't know what I want, oh oh
Know what I want
Don't know what I want, oh oh
Don't know what I want, oh oh
Don't know what I want, oh oh
Tell ya, I just don't know what I want
Be whipped from the outside
Be whipped from the inside
Be whipped from the outside
Whipped from the inside looking for something
Be whipped from the outside
Be whipped from the inside
Be whipped from the outside
Whipped from the inside looking for something
