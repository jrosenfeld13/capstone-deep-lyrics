Ooh no way. How does it feel
To been bit by the snake, left without a meal
You know the stakes are high
When you hear her cry
She'll keep pushin' and pushin' til she makes her mark

Here's what they said, lookout
Seducer, Seducer

I tried to hit on the beat
I got mesmerized babe, I fell to her feet
She can steal your soul, with her mind control
Fighting for air
Was all worthless despair

Just as they said, lookout
Seducer, Seducer
Seduce me, seduce me, seduce me, seduce me
Hold tight, knocked to the floor
I give all I got, but she still wants more
It's a human trap, just a dead bum rap
Hear my words, get on your feet and run

Just as they said, just as they said, lookout
She's a seducer, seducer
Seducer, seducer, seduce me, seducer
