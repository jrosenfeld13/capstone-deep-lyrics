Di woman dem want a man pon di frontier
Seh shi jus love how mi been there
Shi run weh di man from dung a goodyear
Seh dat him nuh know how fi change di gear

Shi jus want a man pon di frontier
Seh shi jus love how mi been there
Shi run weh di man from dung a goodyear
Seh dat him nuh know how fi change di gear

Shi nuh want nuh popsicle fi come tickle
Tired fi laugh like Heckle and Jeckle
Run weh di bwoy if him a obstacle
If him cyaan boil di water inna di kekkle
Waan feel di fire like it drop inna pickle
Fudge man a pass and shi waan iceicle
Waan mi fi rub it up and dung pon di nipple
Waan mi fi do it on di double

Cau shi want a man pon di frontier
Seh shi jus love how mi been there
Shi run weh di man from dung a goodyear
Seh dat him nuh know how fi change di gear

Jus want a man pon di frontier
Seh shi jus love how mi been there

Shi run weh di man from dung a goodyear
Bout him waan drive and nuh know fi steer

Him guh kitchen guh nyam me guh in deh fi cook
Bwoy a wuk hard and ooman a read book
A feel up him self and she only a look
But mi nah let di fish off a di hook

If yuh nuh do yuh job right yuh nah get again
And shi aguh laugh and tell her friend
Tell off Patsy, Maxine, and Gwen
Seh yuh have a one-a minute problem

But shi want a man pon di frontier
Seh shi jus love how mi been there
Shi run weh di man from dung a goodyear
Seh dat him nuh know how fi change di gear

Jus want a man pon di frontier
Seh shi jus love how mi been there
Shi run weh di man from dung a goodyear
Bout him waan drive and nuh know fi steer
