[Verse 1]
Wake up, so much you and I can be
Far beyond the face that we can see
Listen to the silent prayer as it goes up so
To the sky

[Chorus]
So we step one two, then you know the rhythm now
Step one two, let the music seep in
Step one two, move with me
There's nothing to it, so come on
So come on, so come on

[Verse 2]
Come on, you and I will be in love
So in love, so helpless so new
Knowing we will ever see, the world is on a sea
And feel the love

And feel the love

[Chorus]
So we step one two, then you know the rhythm now
Step one two, let the music seep in
Step one two, move with me
There's nothing to it, so come on

Step one two, then you know the rhythm now
Step one two, let the music seep in
Step one two, move with me
There's nothing to it, so come on

Step one two, then you know the rhythm now
Step one two, let the music seep in
Step one two, move with me
There's nothing to it, so come on
