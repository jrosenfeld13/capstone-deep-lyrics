[Instrumental 25 secs]

Do you still keep paper flowers
In the bottom drawer with your Belgian lace
Taking them out every year
To watch the colours fade away

Do you still believe in fairy tales
In battlements of shining castles
Safe from the dragons
That lie beneath the hill

Are you still a Russian princess
Rescued by a Gypsy dancer
To anyone who'll listen
Is that a story you still tell

You live a life of fantasy
Your diary romantic fiction
Can't you see it's hard for me
Can you see what I'm trying to say

It's a gentleman's excuse me
So I'll take one step to the side
Can you get it inside your head
I'm tired of dancing

For every one step forward
I'm taking two steps back
Can you get it inside your head
I'm tired of dancing

[Instrumental 21 secs]

I know you still like old-fashioned waltzes
Your reflection in the mirror that you flirt with
As you glide across the floor
But if I told you the music's over
Would you want to hear
That your dance card is empty
That there's no one really there

Do you still believe in Santa Claus
There's a millionaire looking for your front door
With a key to a life
That you'd never understand

And all I have to offer
Is the love I have it's freely given
You'll see its value
When you see what I tried to say

It's a gentleman's excuse me
So I'll do one step to the side
Can you get it inside your head
I'm tired of dancing

For every one step forward
I'm taking two steps back
Can you get it inside your head
That from this one step forward
There's no turning back
Can you get in inside your head
I'm tired of dancing

We're finished dancing
