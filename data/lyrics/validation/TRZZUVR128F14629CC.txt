Come on without, come on within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn
Come on without, yeah baby, come on within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn

Everybody's building ships and boats
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna jump for joy

Come on without, yeah baby, come on within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn

I like to go just like the rest
I like my sugar sweet
But jumping queues and making haste
Ain't my cup of meat

Everyone's beneath the trees
Feeding pigeons on the limb
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here
All the pigeons gonna run to him

Come on without, yeah baby, come on within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn
Come on without, come on within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn

Come on without, come on within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn
Yeah, come on without, come on within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn
Come on without, come on within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn
Yeah, come on without, come on within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn
