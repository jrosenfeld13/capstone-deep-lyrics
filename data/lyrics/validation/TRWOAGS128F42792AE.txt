[Verse 1]
You've got to catch an early plane
And it's no surprise I'm standing still
Another minute more is all I need
And I'll never have enough

This room gets so cold in the winter
What will it take to heat this house?
I just want to feel comfortable
And when there's only the two of us on my bed
My foot nearly brushes your leg
I can't draw it away
I can't push it forward
It lies stranded, it belongs to someone else

We knew each other once
This can't be what you want
But you didn't have to demolish me

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't remember losing sight of your needs
I don't remember losing sight of your needs

[Chorus]
I am not an acrobat
I cannot perform these tricks for you
Losing all my balance
Falling from a wire meant for you

[Verse 2]
The sky is often used as a metaphor
And I suppose that's cause it's so big and expansive

When a long strand of cloud sits just above the horizon
Leaving a strip of clear blue beneath it
It becomes the panorama

And you turn your head three hundred and sixty degrees
And the same line follows you round if the land is sufficiently flat
Really, nothing can be compared to it

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't remember losing sight of your needs
I don't remember losing sight of your needs

Your needs

[Chorus x2]
I am not an acrobat
I cannot perform these tricks for you
Losing all my balance
Falling from a wire meant for you
