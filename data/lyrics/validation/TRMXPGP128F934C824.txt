[Verse 1]
Into the valley we go
To bliss the witch, she's suckin'
Ultimate power, life's suck zonk zone
Stands over you
Squat launching you

[Chorus]
Waaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhyaaaaahh
Whayayayayaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhyaaaahhh
Whayayaya

[Solo]

[Verse 2]
Humans squirm, stomachs churnin'
Squander seed and energy
Reapin', weepin', porno-peepin'
Your greasy poot
Distorts the truth

[Chorus]
Waaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhyaaaaahh
Whayayayayaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhyaaaahhh
Whayayayaya

Whoaaaaa
Whoaaaaa

[Screaming]

[Outro, spoken, overlapping each other]
[Sexecutioner:] What, what, what is this?
[Beefcake:] What is he sayin' anyway?
[Oderus:] What the fuck?
[Sexecutioner:] What the hell are you doing again? We got to get the song right on the...we know, this is not...[???] Terrible!
[Beefcake:] Hey man...
[Oderus:] It was...it was just startin' to get all good!
[Beefcake:] Hey man, it sounds great! It sounds great!
[Sexecutioner:] Stop fooling around, we got a record to make!
[Beefcake:] Look, it's your fault that we sound like shit in the first place!
[Oderus:] I'll show you foolin' around! I'll show you fuckin' foolin' around!
[Beefcake:] I'm comin' in, he comin' in, I'm comin' in, right now! Right now!
[Continued yelling and destruction]
