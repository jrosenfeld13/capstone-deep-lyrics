Heathen in the night is the eye of the golden moon
He's falling around you in a swoon like a heroine

Fall around (fall around), fall around (fall around)
Fall around (fall around), fall around (fall around)
Fall around (fall around), fall around (fall around)
Fall around, fall around and falling down again

Who gave you diamonds?
Who gave you pearls?
Who send your treasures
From all around the world?

Shake out all your fears, each one and dry your eyes
Then drift into the arms of the dream that pulls you down

Going down (going down), going down (going down)
Going down (going down), going down (going down)
Going down (going down), going down (going down)
Going down, going down, you're going down again

Who gave you diamonds?
Who gave you pearls?
Who send your treasures
From all around the world?
