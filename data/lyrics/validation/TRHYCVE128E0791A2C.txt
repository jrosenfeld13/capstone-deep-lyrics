I have finally found a way to live
Just like I never could before
I know that I don't have much to give
But I can open any door

Everybody knows the secret
Everybody knows the score
I have finally found a way to live
In the color of the Lord

I have finally found a place to live
Just like I never could before
And I know I don't have much to give
But soon I'll open any door

Everybody knows the secret
Everybody knows the score
I have finally found a place to live
In the presence of the Lord
In the presence of the Lord

I have finally found a way to live
Just like I never could before
And I know I don't have much to give
But I can open any door

Everybody knows the secret
I said everybody knows the score
I have finally found a way to live
In the color of the Lord
In the color of the Lord
