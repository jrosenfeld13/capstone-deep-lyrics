Why'd you give him 18 years
Leave a family drowning in tears
Baby boy baby girl
Now their lives a living hell
Some say it shouldn't be done
But life on the dole ain't no fun
SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN DONE
YOU'RE AN INFORMER
You didn't have to name him to the law
Just trying to stop from being poor
Hopes the kids will pull through
Without a dad coz of you
Some say it shouldn't be done
But life on the dole ain't no fun
