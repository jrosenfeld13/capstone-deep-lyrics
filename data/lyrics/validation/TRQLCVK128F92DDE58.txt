I've walked these dusty roads for seven days and seven nights
The only guidance that I keep's the monochrome moonlight
Although the stars above me whisper songs to comfort me
I'm still a solitary girl seeking company

Way back, a haystack and the zodiac, three minds in empathy
A rucksack, the train track and a paperback's all I need to comfort me
I pass through pint-sized places that Ill never see again
I'm still a solitary girl seeking out a friend

Slickback, wisecrack, I can smell a rat
Ransacked, setback, down another cul-de-sac
Bullwhack, maniac, sitting on the train track
Crookback, lumberjack, think I better backtrack

I've walked these dusty roads for seven days and seven nights
The only guidance that I keep's the monochrome moonlight
Although the stars above me whisper songs to comfort me
I'm still a solitary girl seeking company
