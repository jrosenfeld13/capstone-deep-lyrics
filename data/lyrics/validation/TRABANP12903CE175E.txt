Well, I came down there with my hat caved in
Oh I'll go back home with my pocket full of tin oh doo-dah day
Goin' to run all night, goin' to run all day
I'll bet my money on the bobtail nag, somebody bet on the bay

Well, the Camptown ladies sing this song doodah doodah
Ah the Camptown race track's five miles long oh doo-dah day
Goin' to run all night, goin' to run all day
I'll bet my money on the bobtail nag, somebody bet on the bay
