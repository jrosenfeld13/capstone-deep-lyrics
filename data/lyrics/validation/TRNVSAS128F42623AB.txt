Wanted excuses, they gave you excuses
The pressure got stronger
Inside you grew warmer
The calender boiled, time just ticked away for you
Now you're on your own
Another day gone by, i see it in your eyes
Trying so hard just to please
Did you stop to think seein' things different in time
We'll soon tell the apples have ripened
The bottle is empty, the barrel is dry
Money standing in our way
Where can we turn now?
I've walked out on my way
Knowing things won't change
What you're doing's not ok
Will it comfort you?
Seein' different, seein' different
And i've said my piece/peace
You turned your back on me
What a free trip on a ride that you don't deserve
