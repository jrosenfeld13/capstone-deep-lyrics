I had a sister named Emma
Missisippi is a river that floats in the states
Just like the memory and the wisdom of the water
Our souls were connected in so many ways
Even though we haven't talked in a while
I'm still waiting for the day to come when you will arrive
I'm sorry if I ruined happy times we've been through
But know I wonder, if I can spend my days without you and

I had a mother, and her name was Carolina
Carolina is a state in the states
I think there's fifty but there's only one mother
And she won't even look in my face
You know I'd give it all to be loved by you again
But everything's my fault so I carry the blame
But now I'm growing, I get older while the days pass by
Soon I'll be dying thinking you won't even look me in the eyes

And it's sad
So sad
Family values
That we had, it's just a memory
In your mind, we've gone bad
There's no love

I hade a father named Mr Engelbert
Engelbert Humperdinck sings really good
I haven't heard him but I hear my fathers voice
It's in the dreams where things are like they should
I miss your love wich came naturally
Sometimes I cry, when I think about how things used to be
Well at least come and visit me for only one time
Daddy I love you but I know you won't pay me no mind

And it's sad
So sad
Family values
That we had
I'ts just a memory in your mind
We've gonge bad
There's no love
No no
