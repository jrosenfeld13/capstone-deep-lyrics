From here to there to everywhere
And back to Union Square
Where do I get some sleep?
Anywhere the sleep dust lies
It decorates your eyes
Where do I get some sleep?

Stranded in June
Whistling the same old tune
But I do believe I might be having fun
I believe I might be having fun
Impeccably dressed in your second hand vest
We were waiting for the taxi to come

Putting on my daytime eyes
A good enough disguise
Until I get some sleep
Reading out the horoscopes
And using up our jokes
When do we get to sleep?

Stand on the moon
Find the light of my living room
Yes I do believe I might be having fun
I believe I might be having fun
Tune into the station
Make a dedication
This is going out to everyone

This is going out to everyone
This is going out to everyone
Something in the phrasing was quietly amazing
We were waiting for the chorus to come
This is going out to everyone
This is going out to everyone

From here to there to everywhere
And back to union square
Where do I get some sleep?
Anywhere the sleep dust lies
It decorates your eyes
When do I get some sleep?

Stranded in June
Whistling the same old tune
Yes I do believe I might be having fun
I believe I might be having fun
Tune into the station
Make a dedication
This is going out to everyone
This is going out to everyone
This is going out to everyone
This is going out to everyone
Going out to everyone
This is going out to everyone
