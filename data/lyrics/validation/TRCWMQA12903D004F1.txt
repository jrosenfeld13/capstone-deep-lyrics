Claws of death grip my life
Empty my mind and my knowledge is deceased
Mindless and dumb instinct gone

Running in circles
Not knowing where my fate lies

Blindly running through the eternal maze
Surrounded by people the same
Not knowing this place as the darkness falls above
Will we ever see the sun deteriorate away?

Feelings disappear
Your eyes stare blank
Another world to greet
Life now ends
