Psych!

Sex cymbal
Sex cymbal

[Verse 1:]
There's a rumor 'bout "The Glamorous Life"
I think I told you once
I don't mind telling you twice
I'd like to be the one who's in your dreams
But not because I make lots of money
And headed for the big screen
Heaven forbid I don't end up like James Dean

You say your love will never stop
And I hope it's the truth
Not just 'cause I'm on top
No

[Chorus:]
They call me a sex cymbal, say I'm a star
(Call me sex cymbal)
It's up to them just what you are
(Sex cymbal)
With pumps and Versace in my Jaguar
(Pumps in my Jaguar)

[Verse 2:]
If I was living 9-to-5
And hanging with the girls at the same old dive
Would everybody beg me to sign their jeans?
Or is it 'cause I'm what you call famous?

I'm blessed with all the fortune and fame
If I didn't have a dime
Would you treat me the same?
Tell the truth now

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Realize it's an image before it goes too far
Show me, tell me
Make me believe you love me just for me
I think you've known me long enough
I'm Sheila, not Miss E
Come make me happy
I don't mean just the boys
Everybody in my house
Come on, we got to make some noise

Heaven forbid
(Sex cymbal)
Just realize it's an image 'fore it goes too far

[Chorus]

Just realize it's an image 'fore it goes too far
Call me a sex cymbal, call me a star
(It's up to them just what you are)
(Sex cymbal)
With pumps and Versace in my Jaguar
Just realize it's an image 'fore it goes too far

I know you like 'em cute and simple
With no frame of mind
But I'm-a talk and body-shock
And mesmerize you every time

(Pumps in my Jaguar)
(It's up to them just what you are)
(Goes too far)

They call me a sex cymbal
Say I'm a star
(It's up to them just what you are)
(Sex Cymbal)

[Rap:]
Listen to the rhythm while I'm hypin' up the tempo
I can get rather funky when I'm playin' the sex cymbal
My man's name is Tim Bale
I know you've seen him
Chillin' behind the drummer's throne
That you can call my "queendom"
Glamorous ain't it
How the picture is painted
Like my overweight roommate, 808 Kate?
My brother's name is Mister Tom-Tom
Droppin' on the rhythm like a bomb, boy!
S-H-E-I-L-A dash E
Sheila-eila-eila E. is my title
Flyest females
I'm your idol
Supercalivocalistic sister
Rhymes tear you apart just like a twister
If you wanna dance
Well then, do so
'Cause the time remaining is crucial
It's really not that
You better believe that the only sex cymbal I got is my hi-hat!
Crash with a drum roll
Working my body
Shooby doo-wop doo-doo bop
This is a hip-hop party
Not the make, the model or vintage
I don't really care about the glamorous image
The Little Drummer Boy keeps a place in my heart
'Cause you love me for me and that sets off sparks
Now I know life is just one big crescendo
Playin' on the funky
Funky sex cymbal

Wsh, chh-wsh, chh
Wsh, chh-wsh, chh!
Sheila-eila-eila-eila-eila E
Wsh, chh-wsh, chh
Wsh, chh-wsh, chh!
Sheila-eila-eila-eila-eila E

Call me a sex cymbal
(Call me sex cymbal)
Say I'm a star
(It's up to them just what you are)

(Sex cymbal)
With pumps and Versace in my Jaguar
(Pumps in my Jaguar)

Call me a sex cymbal
(Call me sex cymbal)
Say I'm a star
(It's up to them just what you are)
(Sex cymbal)
