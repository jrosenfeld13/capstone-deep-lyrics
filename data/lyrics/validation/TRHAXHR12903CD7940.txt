A little baby's born
Daddy's up and gone
You see his mama cry
Don't you turn away
She's needing you today
To help her dry her eyes
All God's lovely children
Sometimes lose their ways
All God's lovely children
Need your love today
Met a little man
Reaching out his hand
He's reaching out for you
Won't you take his hand
Help him understand
And try to see him through
All God's lovely children
Sometimes lose their ways
All God's lovely children
Need your love today

Love my people
It's right in the steeple
It's in your heart and in your hands
Open up your heart
Reach out your hands
And then you'll begin to understand
Why all God's lovely children
Sometimes lose their ways
All God's lovely children
Need your love today
