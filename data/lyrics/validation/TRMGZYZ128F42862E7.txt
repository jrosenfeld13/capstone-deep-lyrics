From the album: One, Released 4.99

You know, I only shake when
- ever you stand right
Over me like a
Hungry buzzard above my head
Are you hoping I'm really dead, well...
Better shut your mouth
Hold you belly tight
I'm not serving you
Anymore

Chorus:
Every time you come to me
You always have your hand out
And every time you give to me
It's never something I, I, oh I ever need

You say - I never show you my gratitude - well
Thank you so much for
Nothing I ever wanted
How did you know?
You must never listen
My what a lovely rope
Looks the perfect size
But don't ya' think that it makes me look
Too young to die?

Every time you come to me
There's always one condition
And every time you come to me
You always want me to, to bleed, bleed, bleed

Your generosity kills me

La la la la la la la la la la la la la
And every time you give to me
It's never one single thing I
Could ever want or need
I don't need - I don't need
I don't want
What you say you're just giving away
'cause I know nothing's ever
Free
