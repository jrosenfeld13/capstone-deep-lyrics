Well, lots of little pieces make up the little girl
Such a tiny thing in this great big world
Well, now I've got to find out what's crackin' up
My little buttercup
I got to take her to the doll hospital

Well I bought her a dollhouse and a Corvette too
She's got everything's Barbie's got, I'm tellin' you
But every time I make a move just to touch her hair
She says, "Little boys should play with teddy bears"
I'm gonna take her to the doll hospital

(Chorus)
Uh-huh, oh yeah
Baby you'll be all right
I'm gonna take you
To the doll hospital tonight
Uh-huh, oh yeah
Baby you look a fright
I'm gonna take you to the doll hospital

Well, all in love is fair
But it's the wear and tear
And words left unspoken
That leave hearts broken
But I never tore your legs off
Or threw you on the floor
Now I know baby cries a lot
But please don't cry no more

When we played doctor I must have made a mess
But I fixed her little wagon up good, I guess
She said Ken never made her heart beat so
But he lacked that certain somethin' as we all know
Now I burst her little bubble, her mind's about to go
I gotta get her to the doll hospital

(Chorus)
Uh-huh, oh yeah
Baby you'll be all right
I'm gonna take you
To the doll hospital tonight
Uh-huh, oh yeah
Baby you look a fright
I'm gonna take you to the doll hospital
