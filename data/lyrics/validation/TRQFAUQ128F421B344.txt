Traveling down the road
The conditions are not just right
Carrying a heavy load
Feeling you get at night
Hiding the eyes that shine
With the clouds hanging down below
When you carry a heavy load
You've got nowhere else to go

Traveling down the road
The conditions are not just right
Carrying a heavy load
Sun sets on the dark white ice
Speed jumps when the heart rates rise
As we swerve to the streets below
When you carry a heavy load
You've got nowhere else to go

Carrying a heavy load
Carrying a heavy load
Carrying a heavy load
Carrying a heavy load
