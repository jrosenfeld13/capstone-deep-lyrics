Wipped in the eye by the sand
Malicious have light of day obscured
The sun has burned my skin
Open wounds are licked by sand

To be punished by this vortex of scorn

Wrists and ankles are chained upon this land
Drawn through the desert to be their sacrifice

So this is my golgatha, so this is my grave
The theives, the liars, the hypocrit scum
I'd slay them if I only could

The endless sand, the blackest land
A cyclone of spinecrushing anger
Meant for me

The overlords of the desert
Not one was meant to be
All human force now flee
Rules of anatomy lost
Rage into the extreme
