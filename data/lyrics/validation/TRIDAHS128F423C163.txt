All day, since your haircut in the morning
You have looked like a painting, even more than usual
We are in the wind, planting the maples
We meet an older man who seems to know
I miss my dad
And he smiles through the limbs
We talk easily with him
Until the rain begins
This is the brotherhood of man

Waiting at the airport on my suitcase
A girl traveling from Spain became my sudden friend
Though I did not learn her name
And when the subway dimmed
A stranger lit my way
This is the brotherhood of man

I never can say what I mean
But you will understand
Coming through clouds on the way
This is the brotherhood of man
