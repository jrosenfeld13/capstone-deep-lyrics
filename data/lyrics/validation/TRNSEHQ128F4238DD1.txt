Warriors of Sheol ride the storm
Coming to retrieve the human forms
Black cloak rider, force of sin
Mission to destroy white magic's kin

Curse their holy souls
In fire they will die
Good comes to an end
Steal the power from their eyes

High priests pray to their one above
But the winged beasts of evil kill their loved
Phantoms of eternal hell watch on
As darkness slays, light's now gone

Lives of earthen tame
Torn to shreds alive
Taken by the blade
Laughing at their cries

Evil stalks the lives of men, they can't be saved
Hapless victims falling hard to meet their grave
Terror reigns, insanity lives in human fear
Blackened world, malicious souls, hell is here
Specters hunting freeze you with their hateful eyes
Luring victims to their death, petrified
Sacrifice to lord of evil, glorified
For merciless onslaught, all must die

City lies in flame as troops march on
Pillaging and plundering from dawn till dusk till dawn
Turing the earth into eternal fire
Legions of death will leave you crucified
