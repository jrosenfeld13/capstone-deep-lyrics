Give me the hand of the one I love
Take me away to the sunshine land
I've had enough of this crazy life
Working so hard like a mad man

Keep on writin' me, mama
Keep on sendin' me news
Keep on wiring me money
'till the blues take me home

Cold, rainy weather always gettin' me down
Strange talkin' people showing me the way
Not what I'm used to, I've gotta turn around
Hey listen mister, I got something to say

Yeah, keep on writin' me, mama
Keep on sendin' me news
Keep on wiring me money
'till the blues take me home

Yeah, yeah, keep on writin' me, mama
Keep on sendin' me news
Keep on wiring me money
Oh, 'till the blues take me home

Take me home, yeah
Take me home, oow yeah yeah
Take me home, yeah
Take me home, darlin' darlin'
Take me home yeah
Take me home
Take me home yeah
Take me home
