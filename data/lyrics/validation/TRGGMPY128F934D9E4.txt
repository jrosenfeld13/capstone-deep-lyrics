[Verse One]
If you really think the city owes you a debt
Cause your shitty little raps then you need to step
Too many hands trying to snatch some scratch
Billion dollar Barry never met his match
But no
Need for me
To boast and brag
You're gonna hang yourself trying to call me a fag
Eight times
In nine lines?
There's a reason why we call raps rhymes
This guy here should be thrown out the back
He got in for free for claiming he could rap
Peep my science, intelligent and wise
So in love with this shit that I keep a wallet size
These eyes seen more lies in your lips
With one glace, you can catch the apocalypse
Make DJ GI soil his pants
Didn't know a lil' rap in your Tour De France
Unassuming you look
You'll never catch him
Like, "Ah fuck it. Let's bury the hatchet"
In your motherfuckin' chest!
Run, kill a pig, murder [?] like Ken West
Who's the best? It's time to give thanks
Fuck Izzy Asper we love Barry Banks

[Hook] {x2}
Ayo Barry, come here, bury the hatchet
Barry, c'mon, bury the hatchet
Ayo Barry, c'mon bury the hatchet
In your motherfucking chest!

[Verse Two]
Star in the club giving pounds, yo what up?
Bring a white towel just to wipe the blood up
Whether you're in a mud hut or the roof of a mansion
Ain't no finish line when the goal is expansion
And fans, they become a stool pigeon
Missionary to spread, this is the new religion
You and I know it's best to be defeated
In the battle, we all saw the sign up sheet
Smitty
Big Barry and Check Love ya heard
Now you know who get 1st, 2nd and 3rd
You get the bird and it ain't no prize
Love Halloween get to don a disguise
Get me some fries
Raps you'll never match it
And you know where I'm 'bout to bury the hatchet
Deep in your tits it's time to give thanks
Fuck Schwarzenegger we love Barry Banks

[Hook]

[Scratch Hook]
"You get chopped"
"In ya frickin' chest"
