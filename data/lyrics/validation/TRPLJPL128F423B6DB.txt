Out of all the reindeer
You know you?re the mastermind
Well run run Rudolph
Santa ain?t too far behind
Said Santa to the boy
"Child, What have you been longing for?"
He said
"All I want for Christmas
Is a rock n' roll electric guitar"
Then away went Rudolph
Racin? like a shooting star

Well
Run run Rudolph
Santa's gotta make it to town
I said Santa him hurry
Tell him he can take the freeway down
Then run run Rudolph
He?s reelin? like a merry-go-round

Well run run Rudolph
He?s Reelin? like a merry-go-round

Said Santa to a girl
"What would please you most to get??
She said, "A pretty baby

Doll that can cry
Sleep, drink and wet"
Then away went Rudolph
Racin? like a saber jet

Well run run Rudolph
Santa's gotta make it to town
S-S-Santa make him hurry
Tell him he can take the freeway down
Then run run Rudolph
He?s reelin? like a merry-go round
Run Rudolph!

Run, run, Rudolph
He?s Reelin? like a merry-go round

Run, run, run, run
Run run Rudolph
Santa's gotta make it to town
S-S-Santa make him hurry
Tell him he can take the freeway down
Then run run Rudolph
He?s reelin? like a merry-go round
