Get it on, get it on, gotta get it on
Get it on, can you feel the music
Get it on, get it on, gotta get it on
Get it on, can you feel the music

Get it on, get it on, gotta get it on
Get it on, can you feel the music
Get it on, get it on, gotta get it on
Get it on, can you feel the music
Uuh get it on, get it on, get it on, get it on
Can you feel the music
Uuh get it on, get it on, get it on, get it on
Can you feel the music

I got to get it on, got to get on
No delay I waited much too long
Yo yo I go with the flow
Don't stop me now, don't say no
I want you as my lover
Baby Baby there's no other
Person in the whole wide world
Come on come on be my girl

I need you, I must confess
Take your time, there's no stress
You and me forever non stop
I'm gonna take you to the top
You're on mind, in my head
Let me hold you tight instead
It's been going on too long
I got to get it on, got to get on
