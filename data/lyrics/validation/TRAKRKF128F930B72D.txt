Don't close your eyes
Could be forever
Don't close the door
On the way to the stars

Get hypnotized
Lost in the shadows
Don't hear the howl
Of the wolf anymore

We're climbing a mountain of rocks
Seeing the eternal flame
They tried to hold us back from above
Saying this trip's not a game

Light in the sky
There's no returning
Light in the sky
Lost for all eternity...

We're on the move
We're going nowhere
Touching the roof
On the top of the world

We're getting close
To another system
We said goodbye
And we're sure we're gonna miss 'em...
