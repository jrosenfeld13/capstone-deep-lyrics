[Pre-Chorus]
Sun is shining, the weather is sweet
Make you want to move your dancing feet
To the rescue, here I am
Want you to know, you all, where I stand

[Chorus]
(Monday morning) here I am
Want you to know just if you can
(Tuesday evening) where I stand
(Wednesday morning) Tell myself a new day is rising
(Thursday evening) get on the rise
A new day is dawning
(Friday morning) here I am
(Saturday evening) want you to know just
Want you to know just where I stand

[Verse 1]
When the morning gathers the rainbow
Want you to know I'm a rainbow too
So to the rescue, here I am
Want you to know just if you can
Where I stand, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know

We'll lift our heads and give Jah praises

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
To the rescue, to the rescue
To the rescue, to the rescue
Awake from your sleep and slumber
Today could bring your lucky number

[Outro]
Sun is shining and the weather is sweet
Sun is shining
