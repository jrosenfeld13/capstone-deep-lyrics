I wish I could say everything you used to be blows up in smoke, for
Everybody else to see it's a joke, doesn't it make you feel like you have
To choke on the words you spoke, when the promise you broke. You were
Looking mighty small to me, caught up in your world of misery. Cause when
You found a light to lead the way, you were looking for a fire to lead you
Astray. Out of your mind, you were looking for change, you were going
Blind. Say what you want, do what you want, be who you wanna be !
You held your values so high, how could you sink so low. You try to reach for the
Sky, now you've got nowhere to go. You think it's worth the pain, you say
You're free to choose. Hey you've got nothing to gain and everything to
Lose !
I don't understand why you had to sacrifice your ideals, everything
You stood for, I know how it feels. Bouncing back and forth day by day
Never reaching home, never wanted to stay. You held your values high, to
High to reach, you almost touched the sky, now you're back on your feet
Follow the light again, leading the way, and spit out the fire that lead
You astray. Out of your mind, you were willing to change, you were going
Blind. Say what you want, do what you want, be who you wanna be !
You held your values high, too high for you to keep. You almost touched the sky, now you're back on your feet. You had your plans and hopes, you had your dreams
To share. Now you've got nothing at all, you ended up nowhere !
