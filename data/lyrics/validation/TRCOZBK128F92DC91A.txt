Down around the corner in a little school
Children learn their lessons and the golden rule
'Cause they got a teacher up from Basin Street
And she does her teaching with a boogie beat
Teachin' the ABC with rhtyhtm and E
Every single morning, it's the same old thing
All the kids are waiting for the bell to ring
When they hear it ringing, they all jump in line
Walking to the classroom, feeling mighty fine
They learn their ABC with rhtyhm and E
Well, a-reading, writing, arithmetic
Taught to the tune of a liquorice stick
No education is ever complete
Without a boogie-woogie-woogie beat, well all reet
When the day is over and it's time to go
The children get their books and stand right at the door
Teacher is so happy, because she's done her bit
To educate the kids and make 'em really fit
To say their ABC with rhtyhm and E
Well, a-reading, writing, arithmetic
Taught to the tune of a liquorice stick
No education is ever complete
Without a boogie-woogie-woogie beat, well all reet
When the day is over and it's time to go
The children get their books and stand right at the door
Teacher is so happy, because she's done her bit
To educate the kids and make 'em really fit
To say their ABC with rhtyhm and E
