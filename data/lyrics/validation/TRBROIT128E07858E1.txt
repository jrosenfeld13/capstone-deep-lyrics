Cry baby, cry, I hear what you say
You used to have a good man, baby
But you, you threw it all away

Live, baby, live while you still can
I can change your world, baby
If you let me be your man

I wanna get you out of the place you're in
I wanna leave you with no doubt
I wanna get you out of the place you're in
Right now, I wanna get you out

Dream for the day, open up your mind
Well, it don't matter what happens girl
You gotta leave it all behind

I wanna get you out of the place you're in
I wanna leave you with no doubt
I wanna get you out of the place you're in

Because I, I see a bluer sky
I see a better life, so baby, dry your eyes
I'm gonna get you out

I wanna get you out of the place you're in
I wanna leave you with no doubt
I wanna get you out of the place you're in

Right now, I wanna get you out
Right now, I wanna get you out
Right now, I wanna get you out
Oh, right now, I wanna get you out, yeah
