You better open the door
Before I take a hammer to the walls around it
I cannot let you inside my cell
For fear I'll sink the ship and drag us both down

Our hell ends every weekend
But it's all I have to believe in
Our hell ends every weekend
But it's all I have to believe in

Matt makes his murderous demand
Foreign films, I take a stand
And it's all uphill from here
At least I hope so

Kate claims she can't depend on me
For anything and I agree
It's crystal clear
I reach for the bottle and disappear

Our hell ends every weekend
But it's all I have to believe in
Our hell ends every weekend
But it's all I have to believe in

Frank fails to see the humor in
My sad attempts at breakdancing
In every bar
Along Lyndale Avenue

Liz likes to liquor up my thoughts
From the C.C. Club to the Triple Rock
There's no escape
From the chorus of people screaming

You better open the door
Before I take a hammer to the walls around it
I cannot let you inside my cell
For fear I'll sink the ship and drag us both down

Our hell ends every weekend
But it's all I have to believe in
Our hell ends every weekend
But it's all I have to believe in

I'll swim backwards, I'll swim backwards
I'll swim backwards, I'll swim backwards
I'll swim backwards, I'll swim backwards
I'll swim alone the long goodbye

You better open the door
Before I take a hammer to the walls around it
I cannot let you inside my cell
For fear I'll sink the ship and drag us both down
