I am the one that felt but you cant see
I am the voice that you want that you need

This is my house, come on in, come inside
The basement is deep and the attic is wide
The kitchen is tiny but I can still cook
Come on in, come on in, come on in
Ill give you a closer look

Ive been, Ive watching you
I hope that you dont mind
Ill be, Ill be watching you, watch you till Im blind
Darkness drains away as soon as you arrive
When you walk through me
Walk through me, I feel alive

Im not a silky ghost, dont do the dishes
And you thought that you werent superstitious
Dont fear these apparitions, no need to hide
Follow me, follow me, follow me, let me be your guide

Ive been, Ive watching you
I Hope that you dont mind
Ill be, Ill be watching you, watch you till Im blind
Darkness drains away as soon as you arrive
When you walk through me
Walk through me, I feel alive

I feel alive, I feel alive, I feel alive

Ive been, Ive watching you
I Hope that you dont mind
Ill be, Ill be watching you, watch you till Im blind
Darkness drains away as soon as you arrive
When you walk through me
Walk through me, I feel alive
