(You made a promise,and you broke it, he could never love you like I do, oh I feel so bad)

Hurt, to think that you lied to me
Hurt, way down deep inside of me
You said your love was true and we'd never part
Now you've found someone new
And it breaks my heart
I'm hurt

Hurt, much more than you'll ever know
Hurt, because I still love you so
But even though you hurt me
Like no-one else could do
I would never, never hurt you

(Even though you've taken you love from me, baby I want you back, I'll never hurt you)

I'll never hurt you...
