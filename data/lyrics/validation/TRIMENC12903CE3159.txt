[Verse 1]
The sun has opened up my eyes
And I don't wanna leave your side
For that lonesome road
But here I go
Climbin' back behind the wheel
Of fifty feet of chrome and steel
And a load they need in Chicago

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Through the middle of the night unknown
I am on a ride that won't let me go

[Chorus]
I am an asphalt cowboy
Born to run underneath the stars
Pay no mind to my lonely heart
I just ride, ride
'Til I'm back in your arms again
I'll be out here on the wind

[Verse 2]
And sometimes late at night
I see your picture by the dashboard light
And it takes me
Where I'd like to be
Wrapped up in a blanket there
Pulling ribbons from your hair, and your kiss
Girl, thats what I miss

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Still I drive these horses through the rain and snow
This high-speed rodeo is all I know

[Chorus]
I am an asphalt cowboy
Born to run underneath the stars
Pay no mind to my lonely heart
I just ride, ride
'Til I'm back in your arms again
I'll be out here on the wind

[Outro]
And I'll ride
'Til I'm back in your arms again
I'll be out here on the wind
And I'll ride
Through the middle of the night unknown
I'm on a ride that won't let me go
