I know a place, you've never seen
But it knows you right from the start
It's just beyond the ebb and flow
Of a dark and restless heart
You are standing all alone in the rain when it touches you
With a power that your world cannot contain
And the sun breaks through the clouds when you're least expecting it
And it moves you, it moves you
A child is born, within your heart
To live this dream that you lost
You'll sing again a song of joy
And your emptiness is the cost
There's a light in the window and somebody's there to welcome you
To the place that you will always call your home
And the sun breaks through the clouds when you're least expecting it
And it moves you, it moves you
It's an ominous sign, when you step 'cross the line
You can never look back at the past
And you rest in the glow, as the oracle starts to shine
So don't give up, don't be afraid
Though shadows move in the night
This warm embrace of mercy's love
Will become the soul's delight
And the sun breaks through the clouds when you're least expecting it
With a symphony that melts away your pain
And you turn your face to the master who's conducting it
And it moves you, it moves you
