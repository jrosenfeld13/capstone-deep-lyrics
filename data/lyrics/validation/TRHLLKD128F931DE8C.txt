[Verse 1]
When she was 22, the future looked bright
But she's nearly 30 now and she's out every night
I see that look in her face, she's got that look in her eye
She's thinking, "How did I get here?" and wondering why

[Chorus]
It's sad, but it's true how society says her life is already over
There's nothing to do and there's nothing to say
Until the man of her dreams comes along
Picks her up and puts her over his shoulder
It seems so unlikely in this day and age

[Verse 2]
She's got an alright job, but it's not a career
Wherever she thinks about it, it brings her to tears
'Cause all she wants is a boyfriend; she gets one-night stands
She's thinking, "How did I get here? I'm doing all that I can"

[Chorus]
It's sad, but it's true how society says her life is already over
There's nothing to do and there's nothing to say
Until the man of her dreams comes along
Picks her up and puts her over his shoulder
It seems so unlikely in this day and age

[Chorus]
It's sad, but it's true how society says her life is already over
There's nothing to do and there's nothing to say
Until the man of her dreams comes along
Picks her up and puts her over his shoulder
It seems so unlikely in this day and age
