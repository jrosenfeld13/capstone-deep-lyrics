I've got a picture of us as sophomores
I'm in a sport coat, you're in a stupor
You still look super, just supersonic
Kind of bionic, sort of ironic
I was depressed, you fell out of your dress
You fell off of the porch swing, we were kind of a mess
We were kind of uncertain as to where we should kiss
Didn't think that you'd dis me, did you sleep with that hippie?

I've got a feeling like I'm in the Beatles
Bigger than Jesus, I'm getting shot at
It's getting hectic, there's so much traffic
I might never get it
It's behind the buildings
It's guarded by cameras, studied by doctors
Wrapped up in plastic, sleeps at the airport
Skips all its classes, skips like a record
Used to be better, do you remember?
Used to have visions, used to believe 'em

Haven't done any heavy stuff
Since the Nassau Coliseum
I was standing in my sister's raincoat
Said that I looked debonair
The Long Island cops, they pulled off her top
They were wasting those longhairs
I just happened to be there
When the guy selling domestics
Got himself busted
He didn't have a license, couldn't be trusted
Girl selling t-shirts, she's kind of a freaker
First she gets handcuffed, started to beat her
And I was so angry, you had just left me
They had her pinned down, it was so easy
Gotta admit it, I can't forget it
I don't regret it, that I got some kicks in

And every hippie that goes home bloody
Feels like a martyr back in the city
Or in New Jersey and not Manhattan
Or in the Hamptons, back on campus
And out in Boston, and out in Cambridge
And out in Brookline, back in Brooklyn
And on the East Coast, the Carolinas
And Virginia, and in Memphis
And the Twin Cities, and on the West Coast
And in Alaska, and Costa Rica
And in Jamaica, and in Miami
I wanna fuck you
I wanna fuck you
Out in Long Island
