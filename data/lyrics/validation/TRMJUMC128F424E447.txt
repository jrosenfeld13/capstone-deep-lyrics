Care to play? Oh
You're awake
Waste time when true love has gone

Once again I
Need a friend
Where's mine when new love has gone?

Run away, oh
Pass the blame
We don't sing a sadder song

Come again, oh
Waste your breath
The best, the best, the best won't do

Take my place, oh
Ace of spades
The best, the best, the best won't do

Holiday, oh
How's your stay?
Time won't borrow patience, love

In your words are
Truths of hurt
Find your way back to heaven's door

Come again, oh
Waste your breath
The best, the best, the best won't do

Take my place, oh
Ace of spades
The best, the best he best won't do

Scratch the slate, oh
Words and graves
The best, the best, the best won't do
