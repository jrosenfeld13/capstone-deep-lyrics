I know its hard for me to see
The way things have come to be but i must leave it be
Can't keep looking back
I dont know how to act
I dont know where to start
I know ive been here before
My conscience still believes that it was on me
My guilty heart bleeds dont want to feel this no more
So tell me something since youve done nothing except you lied to me
You said youd never leave
After all this i wanted to believe that you still care about my life
Just tell me something so i can go in peace cuz we could not make that sacrifice
After all this i wanted to believe that you still care about me
Its hard to see, but it must be
You take away a piece of me
I never take a step back
Never look back
Ive come to face the facts and i know where you stand
I won't take another step back, never look back
