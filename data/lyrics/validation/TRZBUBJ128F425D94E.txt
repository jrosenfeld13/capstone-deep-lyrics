June bride
Johnny XXXX in white
Side by side
A happening thing inside
Name the day
Waiting will get us nowhere
You decide
What you wanna do this time

This time
What you wanna do this time
I'm yours, you're mine
Forever and a day
I'll be always in your company
Indebted
This time

Sunny side
There you are, keep me in line
Oh me oh my
Taken for the very first time

First time
Taken for the very first time
I'm yours, you're mine
Forever and a day
I'll be always in your company
Indebted
This time

I'm struggling under the strain of bliss
I'm a happy man I've got all of this
Well I'm strugling into the many rooms
On the kitchen floor in the afternoon
I'm struggling under the strain of bliss I'm a
Happy man I've got all this
