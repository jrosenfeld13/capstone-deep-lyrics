So much trouble, hate this job
Tried to get out, trapped like a dog
No, I don't like pumping gas
Do you hate to wait?
Life's a game, we play your rules
Bottle half empty or the bottle half full
It does no good, no good to shout
But I scream I hate

Say I'm hostile, gotta relax
Gotta get a grip, here's the facts
I hate being here

I hate people that make you feel small
I hate having my back against the wall
You know I hate being talked down to
I hate your rules, I hate them all
Hate being marked to take the fall
Planet's not big enough for me and you

So much trouble over me
Surrounded by jerks, can't you see?
Smile to my face, I know you lie
Knife in the back
Another game, rules, rules, rules
Not for me, you fucking fool
Open your mouth just one more time
And my foot's going down

In one ear, out the other
A waste of time, don't even bother
I hate being here

I hate people that make you feel small
I hate having my back against the wall
I hate being talked down to
I hate your rules, I hate them all
Hate being marked to take the fall
Planet's not big enough for me and you
But most of all I hate you

You, I hate you
You, I hate you
I hate, I hate, I hate, I hate you

I hate people that make you feel small
I hate having my back against the wall
You know I hate being talked down to
I hate your rules, I hate them all
Hate being marked to take the fall
Planet's not big enough for me and you
But most of all I hate you

Think I know how you got this far?
Think I know how you got
Where you are?
Think I'll hate you when you're dead?
I know I'll hate you

Smile to my face, know you lie
Say I got problems?
Ask yourself why
Hate the games, I hate the rules
You're gonna lose

Say I'm hostile, gotta relax
Better get a grip, here's a fact
Not much more of you

I hate people that make you feel small
I hate having my back against the wall
You know I hate being talked down to
I hate your rules, I hate them all
Hate being marked to take the fall
Planet's not big enough for me and you
But most of all I hate you

I hate people that make you feel small
I hate you
I hate having my back against the wall
I hate you
I hate being talked down to

I hate you
I hate your rules, everyone
I hate you
Hate having counted you number one
I hate being placed at number two
But most of all I hate you

And I hate you, I hate you
I hate
