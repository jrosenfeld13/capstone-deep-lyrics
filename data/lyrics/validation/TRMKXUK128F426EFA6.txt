I'd have to be strong
Stronger than a mountain baby
To not crumble at the touch of your hand, of your hand
I'd have to stop time
To stop this love inside me baby
To not reach each night for you
To not need you like I do

I'd have to be super human
Made out of stone, made out of steel
To not feel what I'm feeling
To not love you baby, love you baby
I'd have to have the strength of 10 men
To ever resist a love strong as this
To not care like I do
I'd have to be, have to be super human

I'd call this all the greatest powers baby
I could hold the whole world here
In my hands, in my hands
And still I would be powerless to leave you baby
'Cause your touch is just too sweet
And I'm in this love so deep

I'd have to be super human
Made out of stone, made out of steel
To not feel what i'm feeling
To not love you baby, love you baby
I'd have to have the strength of 10 men
To ever resist a love strong as this
To not care like I do
I'd have to be, have to be super human

Even Hercules wouldn't have the strength to leave
Once he fell under the spell of your kiss
So how could I even try (tell me)
To leave your side and say goodbye baby...

I'd have to be super human
Made out of stone, made out of steel
To not feel what i'm feeling
To not love you baby, love you baby
I'd have to have the strength of 10 men
To ever resist a love strong as this
To not care like I do
I'd have to be, have to be super human

I'd have to be super human
Made out of stone, made out of steel
To not feel what i'm feeling
To not love you baby, love you baby
I'd have to have the strength of 10 men
To ever resist a love strong as this
To not care like I do
I'd have to be, have to be super human

I'd have to be super human
Made out of stone, made out of steel
To not feel what i'm feeling
To not love you baby, love you baby
I'd have to have the strength of 10 men
To ever resist a love strong as this
To not care like I do
I'd have to be, have to be super human
