[Verse 1]
Asked a girl what she wanted to be
She said, "Baby, can't you see?
I wanna be famous, a star on the screen
But you can do something in between

[Chorus]
Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And baby, I love you, yes I do baby

[Verse 2]
I told that girl that my prospects were good
She said, "Baby, it's understood
Working for peanuts is all very fine
But I can show you a better time"

[Chorus]
Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And baby, I love you
Beep beep, beep beep, yeah

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And baby, I love you

[Verse 3]
I told that girl I could start right away
She said, "Listen babe, I've got something to say
I got no car and it's breaking my heart
But I got a driver and that's a start"

[Chorus]
Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And baby, I love you

[Outro]
Beep beep, beep beep, yeah
Beep beep, beep beep, yeah
Beep beep beep, yeah
