It's time to make a move, (woah-oh)
Change the times or they'll change you. (woah-oh)
False promises of more. (of more)
Check that sh_t at the door. (the door)
We're the ones we've been waiting for

We are the one
United under none
We are the one
The one to carry on

Woah-oh (woah-oh)
Woah-oh (woah-oh)
Woah-oh, woah-oh
Woah-oh (woah-oh)
Woah-oh (woah-oh)
Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh

Warfare is everywhere. (woah-oh)
Poisoned land, water, air. (woah-oh)
This routine is long old. (long old)
It's time to break that mold. (that mold)
We'll break it up, then we'll break out

We are the one
United under none
We are the one
The one to carry on

Woah-oh (woah-oh)
Woah-oh (woah-oh)
Woah-oh, woah-oh
Woah-oh (woah-oh)
Woah-oh (woah-oh)
Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh

Withstand and change
Tear it down, rebuild again
Evolve with vision
Yeah, this year's eve, we will breathe fury
I will scale the city walls
Scale!

We are the one
United under none
We are the one
The one to carry on

Woah-oh (woah-oh)
Woah-oh (woah-oh)
Woah-oh, woah-oh
Woah-oh (woah-oh)
Woah-oh (woah-oh)
Woah-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
Oh yeah!
