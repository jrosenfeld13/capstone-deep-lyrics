So you steal it
Escape away with nothing
You try to feel it
But what you have is plastic

You burned your pocket
And everything that's in it
On your search for
Something that is real

Well if you need love
Take the time and be love
Breathe it out, create love
See how things can turn

If you need love
Give yourself and be love
Breathe it out, create love
See how things can turn

It's so empty
But your room is full of people
It's so quiet
But everyone is so loud

And if you need love
Take the time and be love
Breathe it out, create love
See how things can turn

Cause if you need love
Give yourself and be love
Breathe it out, create love
See how things can turn

Inside
You're ruining the mood
You're singing solitude
Forgetting all you knew

So look
Look into the mirror
Swallow all your fear
Believe it's really near

Cause if you need love

Cause if you need love
Take the time and be love
Breathe it out, create love
See how things can turn

Cause if you need love
Give yourself and be love
Breathe it out, create love
See how things can turn

Cause if you need love
Give yourself and be love
Breathe it out, create love
See how things can turn
