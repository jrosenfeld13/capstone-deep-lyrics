[Verse 1]
Your body may be gone, I'm gonna carry you in
In my head, in my heart, in my soul
And maybe we'll get lucky and we'll both live again
Well I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, don't think so

[Chorus]
Well that is that and this is this
You tell me what you want and I'll tell you what you get
You get away from me, you get away from me
Collected my belongings and I left the jail
Well thanks for the time, I needed to think a spell
I had to think awhile, I had to think awhile

[Verse 2]
The ocean breathes salty, won't you carry it in?
In your head, in your mouth, in your soul
And maybe we'll get lucky and we'll both grow old
Well I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I hope so

[Chorus]
Well that is that and this is this
You tell me what you want and I'll tell you what you get
You get away from me, you get away from me
Collected my belongings and I left the jail
Well thanks for the time, I needed to think a spell
I had to think awhile, I had to think awhile

[Bridge]
Well that is that and this is this
Will you tell me what you saw, and I'll tell you what you missed
When the ocean met the sky (You missed)
You missed when time and life shook hands and said goodbye
(You missed)
When the Earth folded in on itself (You missed)
And said "Good luck, for your sake I hope Heaven and Hell
(You missed, you missed)
Are really there, but I wouldn't hold my breath"
(You missed, you missed)
You wasted life, why wouldn't you waste death?
(You missed, you missed)
You wasted life, why wouldn't you waste death?

[Verse 3]
The ocean breathes salty, won't you carry it in?
In your head, in your mouth, in your soul
The more we move ahead the more we're stuck in rewind
Well I don't mind, I don't mind, how the hell could I mind?

[Outro]
Well that is that and this is this
You tell me what you want and I'll tell you what you get
You get away from me, you get away from me
Well that is that and this is this
Will you tell me what you saw and I'll tell you what you missed
When the ocean met the sky (You missed)
You wasted life, why wouldn't you waste the afterlife?
