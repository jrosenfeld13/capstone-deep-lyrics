[Verse 1]
Bring out the charge of the love brigade
There is spring in the air once again
Drink to the sound of the song parade
There is music and love everywhere
Give a little love to me
Take a little love from me
I want to share it with you

I feel like a millionaire

[Verse 2]
Once we were mad, we were happy
We spent all our days holding hands together
Do you remember, my love?
How we danced and played
In the rain we laid
(How we wish that we could) Stay there, forever and ever

[Verse 3]
Now I am sad
You are so far away
I sit counting the hours day by day
Come back to me, how I long for your love
Come back to me
Be happy like we used to be

[Bridge]
Come back, come back to me
Come back, come back to me
Come back to me, oh my love
How I long for your love - won't you come back to me, yeah
My fine friend - take me with you and love me forever
My fine friend - forever - forever...

[Outro]
Bring out the charge of the love brigade
There is spring in the air once again
Drink to the sound of the song parade
There is music and love everywhere
Give a little love to me
Take a little love from me
I want to share it with you
Come back, come back to me
You make me feel like a millionaire
