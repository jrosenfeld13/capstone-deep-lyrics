I lived life faithfully, I dread each breath that I take
I've found this path to nowhere
No where hell I can't escape
Someone save me from this dream
Every morning that I wake
I wish things could've been different
Is there something that could be changed?
Reaching out the the heavens
I see a falling sky
Visions of blood red images fill my mind
Reflecting on my life
From the day I was born and how it all fell apart
I never tought my life would be such a mess
God please help me
Everyday I'd live for what I'd like to know
My life leading up to the end
You said that I was your son
But what son would have to suffer like this
Is this my destiny
I was chosen to be the shepherd of this land ?
Lead you all to the shinning light, so serene
Why have you chosen me?
Why not you, why not him, what prophecies
Hold me above my head?
The preordained servant
To show you love throught death, I can't imagine this
Here we sit, the last suffer, take this wine
For this is my blood
Here we sit, the last suffer, take this bread
For this is my body
Someone, save me from this dream
Every morning that I wake
I wish things could've been different
Is there something that could be changed?
Is this my destiny
I was chosen to be the shepherd of this land ?
Lead you all to the shinning light, so serene
Why have you chosen me?
Why not you, why not him, what prophecies
Hold me above my head?
The preordained servant
To show you love throught death, I can't imagine this
This pain, for you, I suffer
This pain, for you, I suffer
This pain, for you, I suffer
This pain, for will suffer
