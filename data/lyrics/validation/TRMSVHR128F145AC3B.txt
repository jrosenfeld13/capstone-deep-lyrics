Close your eyes my sleepy child
Don't let a teardrop fall
There is no need to cry child
There is no need at all
Dry your eyes and sleep now
Let your sweet dreams flow
And when you rise know that I'll be near
Because I love you so

Don't be sad my baby girl
Don't be bad or blue
Please don't be sad my baby girl
Your daddy is here with you
Dry your eyes don't weep now
Don't let a teardrop fall
Close your eyes and sleep now
God protect us all

And God is the greatest thing
That only the fools do not know
To love God is the greatest thing
But I'm a fool and I love you so
God knows that I love you
Sleep tight my sweet child
Don't let a teardrop flow
Goodnight my sleep child

There is no need for sorrow
So dry your eyes and sleep now
Let your sweet dreams flow
And when you rise know that I'll be near
Because I love you so
God knows that I love you
Sleep tight my sweet child
Goodnight my sweet child
