[Chorus]
I fell in love again last night
You keep doing everything just right
You've got me wrapped around your fingers
And every morning the love still lingers
I fell in love again last night

[Verse 1]
When you kissed me the way you've always done
Like the first time you were with me and my heart just came undone
Lying here this morning, boy I know you're still the one

[Chorus]
I fell in love again last night
You keep doing everything just right
You're the reason my heart keeps beating
And every morning it keeps repeating
I fell in love again last night

[Verse 2]
We were talking about some future plans
And how far we've come together since the night it all began
Then you reached out to touch me and guess what happened then

[Chorus]
I fell in love again last night
You keep doing everything just right
You're the reason my heart keeps beating
And every morning it keeps repeating
I fell in love again last night
In love again last night
I fell in love again last night
