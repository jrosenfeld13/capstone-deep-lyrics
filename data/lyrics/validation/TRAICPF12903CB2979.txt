I am the hollow face who controls vile delusion
And bends the souls of men
A kind and gentle voice to lure the Great Unwashed
All hail the age of sin

Like every traitor and willing pawns, I believe in my own lies
My exhortations, the words I preach are but systematic shifts

I am a fiction but in your heads
I only exist to entertain, to prevent masses to awake
Ignorance shall prevail

To lead and to fulfill the plebeians' desires, to corrupt and subvert
I need but to despise the very substance of truth
And define what is right

Like every traitor and willing pawns, I believe in my own lies
My exhortations, the words I preach are but systematic shifts

I am a fiction but in your heads
I only exist to entertain, to prevent masses to awake
Ignorance shall prevail

Like every traitor, I believe in my own lies
The words I preach are but systematic shifts

And you shall move on my very commands
Your shattered will is such a delight for me

Like every traitor and willing pawns, I believe in my own lies
My exhortations, the words I preach are but systematic shifts

I am a fiction but in your heads
I only exist to entertain, to prevent masses to awake
Ignorance shall prevail
