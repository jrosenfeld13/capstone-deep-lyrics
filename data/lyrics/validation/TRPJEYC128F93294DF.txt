No hope in your heart
No light in your soul
No wishes in your mind
Lost in yourself

No tears, no feelings
Only protective scatter rain
No way out, no control

There is only one way
You can find your truth
Find your wings
And swing in the air

There is only one way
You can find your truth
Find your wings
So then you can fly

Searching for forgiveness
Is it so cold inside of you
Could you forgive yourself?
That's the only answer I can give you

No hope in your heart
No light in your soul
No wishes in your mind
Lost in yourself
