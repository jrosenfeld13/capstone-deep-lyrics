Helplessly, my babies follow me from sunken cinema to Factory. From flesh to synagogue to gallery
Displayed with a whip and a cage, the thrill of the sideshow and the muddy chase. The crack of the gun to keep you in your place
A shallow shadow creeps across us to freeze, to face, to fear, until there's nothing left for us to feel. With patience on my side, with time to better our lines...
REACT OR DIE
There's soot and glue in my eyes, but you won't see me (cry)
