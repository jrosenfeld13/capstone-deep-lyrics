I'm so tired of working everyday
Now the weekend's come I'm gonna throw my troubles away
If you've got the cab fare mister you'll do alright
I want to see the bright lights tonight

Meet me at the station don't be late
I need to spend some money and it just can't wait
Take me to the dance and hold me tight
I want to see the bright lights tonight

There's crazy people running all over town
There's a silver band just marching up and down
And the big boys are all spoiling for a fight
I want to see the bright lights tonight

Meet me at the station don't be late
I need to spend some money and it just can't wait
Take me to the dance and hold me tight
I want to see the bright lights tonight

A couple if drunken nights rolling on the floor
Is just the kind of mess I'm looking for
I'm gonna drink 'til Monday comes in sight
I want to see the brights lights tonight

Meet me at the station don't be late
I need to spend some money and it just can't wait
Take me to the dance and hold me tight
I want to see the bright lights tonight

Take me to the dance and hold me tight
I want to see the bright lights tonight
