Cardboard stipend
Need it send it
Window garden
Placid placid

Heal dog wound lick
Eight good nine sick
Beat it brace it
Just out race it

Went to find how water shines why bells fall in the sea
I know one night we get it right Absinthe Jim and me
The mountains can be steep my friend there are no guarantees
So find your inspiration from any passing purity

Christo's bridges
Ruffles ridges
