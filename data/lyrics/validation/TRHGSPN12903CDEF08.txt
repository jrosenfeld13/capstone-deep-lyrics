I'm thinking of the things that i avoid
Asking questions of tomorrow
Betting on the tears that all must fall
Tears of happiness and sorrow

The older i get i get older
I hope i know i'm getting stronger
Can only be what it will be
Some days are short
Others longer

If you want good love
Don't force it to react
Hand behind your back

I'm thinking of the pain i can't recall
The weight i carry not the world at all
I'm still amazed we're here today
I'm down the open mouth of wonder

If you want good love
Start by stepping back
Let your heart react, back home
