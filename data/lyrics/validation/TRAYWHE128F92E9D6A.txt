Three hearts in a tangle one heart will have to break
Tonight as I sit by my window watching the people go by
I'm trying to reach a decision but I know I can't do what's right
Three hearts in a tangle which heart should I take
Three hearts in a tangle which heart will I break

If I choose the one that I should choose then the other heart would break
But if I'll leave them both then I'd suffer which heart will pay for my mistake
Three hearts in a tangle...
