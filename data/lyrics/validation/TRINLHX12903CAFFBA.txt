Dying in this dead world
Bleeding, pass down the days gone
Surrender is your last acceptance
This fall just broke my hands
Forget wiping the slate, let's just destroy the past
Still alive with the knife as the blade digs your grave
My back bleeds
The curse is set the stone is cast
My back bleeds
From friends, to idols, to ashes
Friends... idols... ashes
