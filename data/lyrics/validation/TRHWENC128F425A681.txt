Silver shining around your eyes
You thought that you'd lie and wait
For me to walk beside you

Lilacs filling our senses blooming
You thogut you'd lie and wait
For me to whisper softly

You are mine
You are mine
And I'm at rest here
You are mine

Moonlight indigo swoons around us
You thought you'd lie and wait
For me to walk beside you

Lyres ebbing their serenade
You thought that you'd lie and wait
For me to whisper softly

You are mine
You are mine
And I'm at rest here
You are mine
