My body bangs and twitches
This brown liquor wets my tongue
My fingers find the stitches
Firmly back and forth they run

I need no other memory
Of the bits of me I left
When all this lethal drinking
Is to hopefully forget
About you

I might as well admit it
Like I even have a choice
The crew have killed the captain
But they still can hear his voice

A shadow on the water
A whisper in the wind
On long walks with my daughter
Who's lately full of questions about you

About you

When Job asked you the question
You responded "Who are you
To challenge your creator?"
Well, if that one part is true

It makes you sound defensive
Like you had not thought it through
Enough to have an answer
Or you might have bit off
More than you could chew
