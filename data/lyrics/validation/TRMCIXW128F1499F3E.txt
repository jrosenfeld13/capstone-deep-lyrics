[Verse 1]
I would live my life for you
Only because I feel the need
Girl, I would die for you
Precious as gold, you are to me

[Pre-Chorus]
And I betcha
That you never
Ever had real love to call your own
Love wouldn't let ya
Feel the pleasure
Don't out your love on hold
Don't be alone

[Chorus]
You will never know love
If you don't open your heart
Come as you are
You will never know love
Until you open your heart
Make a new start

[Verse 2]
I'd sacrifice for you
Simply because you're heaven to me
Lay down my life for you
'Cause you are my world, my everything

[Pre-Chorus]
And I betcha
That you never
Ever had real love to call your own
Love wouldn't let ya
Feel the pleasure
Don't out your love on hold
Don't be alone

[Chorus]
You will never know love
If you don't open your heart
Come as you are
You will never know love
Until you open your heart
Make a new start

You will never know love
If you don't open your heart
Come as you are
You will never know love
Until you open your heart
Make a new start

[Bridge]
Don't out your love on hold
Don't be alone
You will never never never never never know love
You'll never know
Oh Oh

[Chorus with ad-libs]
You will never know love
If you don't open your heart
Come as you are
You will never know love
Until you open your heart
Make a new start

You will never know love
If you don't open your heart
Come as you are
You will never know love
Until you open your heart
Make a new start

You will never know love
If you don't open your heart
Come as you are
You will never know love
Until you open your heart
Make a new start

You will never know love
If you don't open your heart
Come as you are
You will never know love
Until you open your heart
Make a new start
