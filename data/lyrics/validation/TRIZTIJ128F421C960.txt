They say that love is hard to find
Sure found it hard to find mine
Although love walked right up to my face
She said you can only love what you'd die for, babe

Well shed a little light so I can find you
And don't let darkness hide you from my face
Baby, shed a little light so I can find you
Well I'd surely die for your embrace

And the second love reveals
Trouble is hard on its heels
And love walked right up, stood by my side
And said if it's love or death, baby, no need to decide

Well shed a little light so I can find you
Don't let darkness hide you from my face
Baby, shed a little light so I can find you
Well I'd surely die for your embrace

Babe, shed a little light so I can find you
Don't let darkness hide you from my face
Baby, I've got a light, let it show me how to find you
But it might just blind you before that, baby
Well it might just blind you before that, baby
It might just blind you before that, babe
