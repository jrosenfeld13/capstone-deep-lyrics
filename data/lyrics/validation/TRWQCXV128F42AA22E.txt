The Devil makes work for idle hands to do
He can take these hands, if they're not touching you
And these lips of mine would rather turn to stone
Than kiss another now that you are gone
Sweetheart
I'm so alone
Sweetheart
When are you coming home?
Sweetheart
I'm so alone
Sweetheart
When are you coming home?
I know that love's a many splendored thing
It loses it's spark without the joy you bring
And happiness can be an empty term
But I found heaven nestling in your arms
(And now you're gone)
(Aah)
Sweetheart
I'm so alone
Sweetheart
When are you coming home?
Sweetheart
I'm so alone
Sweetheart
When are you coming home?
(Are you coming home?)
Hmm hmm hmm
Hmm hmm hmm
(Aah)
Sweetheart
I'm so alone
Sweetheart
When are you coming home?
Sweetheart
I'm so alone
Sweetheart
When are you coming home?
Wohh
(Sweetheart of mine)
(Woh woh woh woh)
(Sweetheart of mine)
Sweetheart of mine
(Ooh)
Sweetheart
(Ooh)
Sweetheart of mine
(Ooh)
Sweetheart
(Ooh)
When are you coming home?
