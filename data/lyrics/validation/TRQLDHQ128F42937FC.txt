Doctor, doctor, please, oh the mess I'm in
Doctor, doctor, please, oh the mess I'm in

She walked up to me and really stole my heart
And then she started to take my body apart

Living, loving, I'm on the run, far away from you
Living, loving, I'm on the run, so far away from you

Doctor, doctor, please, oh I'm going fast
Doctor, doctor, please, oh I'm going fast

It's only just a moment, she's turning paranoid
That's not a situation for a nervous boy

Doctor, doctor, please, oh the mess I'm in
Doctor, doctor, please, oh the mess I'm in

But you look so angry as I crawled across your floor
She's got the strain and I can't take any more

Living, loving, I'm on the run, so far away from you
Living, loving, I'm on the run, so far away from you

Doctor, doctor, please, oh the mess I'm in
Doctor, doctor, please, oh I'm going fast
Doctor, doctor, please, oh the mess I'm in
Doctor, doctor
