Don't be an idiot
You can't let it go
Till it won't come back
And you can't move forward
It's somethin' like a discord
It was so slow
That it crushes all the atoms
And destroys every molucule
Oh, but she's a spinning
Like a windmill
My fingers get caught
And they get cut up
And they get cut off
Fly finger ear
And everyone's stoked
Nobody can drink
Or put on a seat belt
My lips are so numb
But it's colder in my heart
I found the eight ball
Why you gotta get so hot
So hot so cold
T-t-timing is everything
I'm all out of time
And smokes & luck
And beer & everything
Drink until you're sick
And you're too sick to drink
And that is disastrous
Sun is the shade
And don't be an idiot
You can't let it go
Till it won't come back
And you can't move forward
Somethin' like a discord
It was too slow
That it crushed all the atoms
Destroyed all the molucules
My lips are so numb
But it's colder in my heart
Ice on the eight ball
Why you gotta get is so hot
So you asked me
Do I wass get hot
Hot, hot
Get hot
Are you joking
Why you gotta always get it
So hot, so hot, so cold
Why you gotta get it
So hot, so hot, so cold
So hot, so cold
