Get stoned, get stoned, get stoned, Get stoned, get stoned, get stoned ...

As I walked around the streets of your town
Tryin' not to bring myself down
The jeers of the insane
Bounce like bullets off my brain
The subway is not the underground
Oh, New York City, goodbye!
Oh, New York City, goodbye
Goodbye, New York City!
Number-People rush through the dawn
With their Number-People faces on
Times Square is not the word
For the sucking, squeezing herd
The subway is not the underground
Oh, New York City, goodbye!
Oh, New York City, goodbye
Goodbye, New York City
As I walked around the streets of your town
Tryin' not to bring myself down
Stoned here I find
I almost lost my mind
The subway is not the underground
Yeah, now New York  New York City goodbye
Oh New York City, goodbye
Goodbye, New York City, I'm goin' home
Oh, I don't want to be in New York anymore, oh no
