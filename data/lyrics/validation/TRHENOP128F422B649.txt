Faraway run, run Johnny, faraway
Faraway run, run Johnny, faraway
But not today, not tomorrow or any other day
Will you find a solution if you only run away

Now I wanna sing a song
Of a good old friend of mine
Yes, the time we spent together was real fine
Years ago he had a girl and she said
Johnny go away
And he tried to solve this problem
With twenty beers a day
Twenty beers a day

Johnny found his own world in his room alone
He built a wall around his heart, made of stone
Many tomes I called by
I said "Johnny take my hand"
He just reached another beer
He lost his job, maybe his friend
He lost his job, maybe his friend
