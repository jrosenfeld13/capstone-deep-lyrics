Right on!

I know how to do it, there is nothing to it
The secret is passion, the secret's
I'm immune to emotion, I'm immune to emotion, I'm cold

No mind, no pain, immune to emotion, immune to emotion

Just try to ignore it, no use to work for it
It's all that I wanted, it's all I got
Immune to emotion, immune to emotion, I'm cold

No mind, no pain, immune to emotion, immune to emotion

I make it a habit to wait 'til I grab it
Don't have any reasons, excuses
I'm immune to emotion, I'm immune to emotion, I'm cold

Where to, where to go? Immune to emotion, immune to emotion

The secret's!
I'm immune to emotion, I'm immune to emotion, I'm cold
No loss, no gain
Immune to emotion, immune to emotion
Immune to emotion, immune to emotion, eh!
