Little girl have I told you
How you light up my life
Come and lay down beside me
Come and thrill me tonight
Do you wanna?

I'm not saying I love you
I won't say I'll be true
There's a crimson bird flying
When I go down on you

I'm so weary and lonesome
And it's cold in the night
When the path to your doorway
Is a pathway of light

Do you wanna come walk with me?
Do you wanna come walk with me?
If you do baby say it now
Though we'll both wonder anyhow

Do you wanna come walk with me?
Do you wanna come walk with me?
Do you wanna?

Little girl have I told you
You're my guiding north star
And my love travels with you
Wherever you are

From the mountains to the valley
Leave the light on for me
From Virginia to Alaska
From sea to shining sea

Do you wanna come walk with me?
Do you wanna come walk with me?
If you do baby say it now
Though we'll both wonder anyhow

Do you wanna come walk with me?
Do you wanna come walk with me?
Do you wanna?
