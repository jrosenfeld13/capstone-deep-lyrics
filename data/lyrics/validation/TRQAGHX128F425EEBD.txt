[Intro]
Hee-Hee!
Ooh!
G'on girl!
Aaow!
Hee!

[Verse 1]
Hey pretty baby with the high heels on
You give me fever like I've never, ever known
You're just a product of loveliness
I like the groove of your walk, your talk, your dress

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel your fever from miles around
I'll pick you up in my car and we'll paint the town
Just kiss me baby and tell me twice
That you're the one for me

[Hook]
The way you make me feel
(The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on
(You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet
(You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone
(My lonely days are gone)

[Verse 2]
I like the feeling you're giving me
Just hold me, baby, and I'm in ecstasy
Oh, I'll be working from 9 to 5
To buy you things to keep you by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
I've never felt so in love before
Just promise baby, you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keeping you satisfied
Cause you're the one for me

[Chorus]
The way you make me feel
(The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on
(You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet
(You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone
(My lonely days are gone)

[Interlude]
Acha-ooh!
G'on girl!
G'on!
Hee! Hee! Aaow!
G'on, girl!

[Pre-Chorus]
I've never felt so in love before
Just promise baby, you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keeping you satisfied
Cause you're the one for me

[Chorus]
The way you make me feel
(The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on
(You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet
(You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone
(My lonely days are gone)
The way you make me feel
(The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on
(You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet
(You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone
(My lonely days are gone)

[Outro]
Ain't nobody's business
Ain't nobody's business
(The way you make me feel)
Ain't nobody's business
Ain't nobody's business
But mine and my baby
(You really turn me on)
Hee-hee!
(You knock me off of my feet)
Hee-hee! Ooh!
(My lonely days are gone)
Give it to me
Give me some time
(The way you make me feel)
Come on, be my girl
I wanna be with mine
(You really turn me on)
Ain't nobody's business
(You knock me off of my feet)
Ain't nobody's business
But mine and my baby
G'on, girl! Aaow!
(My lonely days are gone)
