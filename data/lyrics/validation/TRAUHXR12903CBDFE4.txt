Hit a little harder
Give it your best shot
Cut a little deeper
Give it your best shot

Push it further, push it further
You cannot push it any longer
Hold it tighter, hold it tighter
You gotta squeeze until you wring my heart out
So put your weapon down before you...

Shoot the child
Or run a mile

Fall a little harder
Put your weapon down
