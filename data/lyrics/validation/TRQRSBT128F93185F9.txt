Streets won't let me chill [x5]

[Verse 1]

Yeah.. Streets won't let me chill, yet we still
Searching for the coolin' and all
As if my linin' is silver and my flow cold enough
That my tongue stick to it like a winter frost
Then I woke up, doped up on life
See hustlin' is the mode of black promotin' (?)
And it's on right
Develop the mic voice, cause if it don't work
I gotta go to work and get a job with my white voice
And that ain't the right choice
So no I can't chill
It's slow motion, like no motion - a standstill
Niggas is anvils
Street sweeper sweepin' the street dreams
Puttin' sweet dreams in the landfill
Wake up nightmares, general strife here
My hood on the border of the rich, so it's white there
Sinners from Poula (?), and me I'm soulless
Too fly for my surroundings to keep me grounded in flight, yeah

I try stayin' cooler than cool, but..
(The streets won't let me chill)
So I resort to actin' the fool, cause...
(The streets won't let me chill)
I ain't sayin' that I'm packing a tool, but...
(The streets won't let me chill)
See if the grind don't work, then I'm back at the school, cause...
(The streets won't let me chill)

[Verse 2]

They constantly around my way
Niggas is wild, the reason why daily I pray
For me to not get taken off the path
All I have is my mission and my daughter, namsayin?
Maybe just me bein' judgmental
Cars circlin' five times and stayin' out the window
This sounds like scheming going on
So instead of earnin' money, they take it and try to war folks
That ain't a good idea for you
Think of your future, and all the folks that care for you, for real
Cause you will not see them anymore if you threatenin' mine
You want a war, this is on then
I would much rather give a brother dap
Than to see black man with a hole up in his back, damn
He thinkin' that I won't, but I will
Weapon concealed, cold steel
If I have to I'll go for the grill

And I be tryin' just to mind my own, but man...
(The streets won't let me chill)
You know, one minute you're here and the next you're gone, I guess...
(The streets won't let me chill)
You know we living at times where there's war outside, so yeah...
(The street's won't let me chill)
But you gonna mess with mines, and it's check-out time, because...
(The streets won't let me chill)

[Verse 3]

Streets' forecast says the weather is hot
The suburbs got A/C, like it or not
Drippin' tears and sweat at the same time
Smoking to stay hydrated, maintainin' the same high
Found a package, like a fan in the back
Alley, blew away a nigga's problems temporarily
No connect - so I was getting high and ready
To pop a friend, cause not bein' cool is like havin' no oxygen
I can't breathe, so I heatstroke, got my niggas dead
Still can't believe that I die
The heat is on the streets though I speak the facts
Cause errybody in the hood is out around the block
Whites don't come through unless they buyin' crack
Or hoppin' out the squad car tryin' to find who's dry
See we know a lot, still ain't learned enough
They murder us, still observin' us burnin' up

That's why the block is hot, the block is hot, you see...
(The streets won't let me chill)
We was raised wantin' the watches with the icy rocks, that's why the...
(The streets won't let me chill)
Y'all know ice every now and then, but that's the hood I live in, man...
(The streets won't let me chill)
So if you see me keep it real, I'll get the ice grill, for real you see the...
(The streets won't let me --)

Streets won't let me chill
Streets won't let me chill
Streets won't let me chill
Streets won't let me --
