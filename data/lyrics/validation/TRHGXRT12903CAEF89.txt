Wake one day, get out of bed
Drop your Choc Dip as you look outside
There's a glowing pyramid on the edge of town
Its presence there comes as a surprise
Bony hands that claw and scrab, dessicated devils from the past
Anachronistic corpses escaped from the lab, stiff limbed invasion that came on too fast
News reports are confused, talk of bandaged maniacs causing much ado
Slow moving menace that overwhelms the town, it's hopeless to fight now their claws are on you
Fear of fire - there's nothing you can do
Evils conspire - the jackal-headed god beckons you
Borne to the pyramids, no use to shout
They can only speak in hieroglyphs
See the doors marked 'locals in', 'mummies out'
Oh dear god don't let it end like this
Production line of evil that pickles your skin
Conveyor belt of terror stuffs amulets in
Dehumanizing mummifying like a day spa gone wrong
Then they send you out a mummy to do evil carry-on
