I just try to do whatever I can
And if I should cry, well you know
Im only a man
To say youre only human
To say youre just a man
What does that mean?

Cause I checked out, and its easy to be a half
A half of nothing
But another man in a scarf
Avoiding confrontations, dont look me in the eye
When Im looking at you
Are you doing the Caesar?

I always find a reckoning
Always find you beckoning towards me in the air
You embrace me in your memory
You were young and NME and I was in my hair

Im not an ordinary millionaire

I, said the skull, I was bound to end up this way
Ive got no love
Cause its not in my DNA
You say youre only human
My, what big eyes you have!
When youre looking at me
Are you doing the Caesar?

I dont know what youve done to me
I dont know what you want from me
I only know youre there
I dont know where youve gone from me
I know you dont belong to me
I only know youre there

Im not an ordinary million
Im not an ordinary million
Im not an ordinary millionaire
