See Saturn locked in rings
Bound with broken rings
To dance infinite circles
See love a tearful man
Doing what he can
He feeds
He feeds his life
A purpose
Tune in, tune out
Turn everything ground
Don't let your head get down
Don't let your head...
Get down
She see's seasons come and go
Peaks from oceans grow
It's only natural
To be out
Turn everything around
Don't let your head get down
Don't let your head...
Get down
