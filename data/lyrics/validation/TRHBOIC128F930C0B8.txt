[Verse 1]
Bald head and John's convict tattoos
Eyes trading eyes for eyes
Reticent medicine boy weeps the bleed me blues
But the nurse has yet to arrive
So I killed Jhonny's pregnant shadow
While he was fast asleep
The doctor says don't let him go
He wants me six feet deep

[Chorus]
Gotta get them bones in the grave
Get them bones in the grave
Get the bones

[Verse 2]
Frustrated boy, he shits his boots
And the pain dries in a way
The doctor cries, the nurse does swoon
While I dance his pain away
So I killed Jhonny's pregnant shadow
Gave him his deep reward
The doctor says don't let him go
He wants me under the floor

[Chorus]
Gotta get them bones in the grave
Get them bones in the grave
Get them bones
