[Intro]
See you later alligator

[Verse 1]
Well I saw my baby walkin'
With another one today
Well I saw my baby walkin'
With another one today
When I asked her "What's the matter?"
This is what I heard her say

[Chorus]
See you later alligator
After 'while, crocodile
See you later alligator
After 'while, crocodile
Can't you see you're in my way now?
Don't you know you cramp my style?

[Verse 2]
When I thought of what she told me
Nearly made me lose my head
When I thought of what she told me
Nearly made me lose my head
But the next time that I saw her
Reminded her of what she said

[Chorus]

{Trumpet

+ Guitar Solo}

[Verse 3]
She said, "I'm sorry, pretty daddy
You know my love is just for you. "
She said, "I'm sorry, pretty daddy
You know my love is just for you
Won't you say that you'll forgive me
And say your love for me is true. "
I said, "Wait a minute, 'gator
I know you mean't it just for play. "
I said, "Wait a minute, 'gator
I know you mean't it just for play
Don't you know you really hurt me
And this is what I have to say. "

[Chorus]

[Outro]
See you later alligator
After 'while crocodile
See you later alligator
So long, that's all
Goodbye
