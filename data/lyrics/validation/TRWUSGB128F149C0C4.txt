Say a prayer for me
Remember I breathe, I breathe
Grown up twisted in
A place you can't see, can't see

The planet poisoned me
Is a sick place to be, to be
I've got a taste for it
Now I've gotta leave
Goin' away

Sun's comin' down
Sun's comin' down
On me, on me, on me, oh

The world is fakin' every deal that it makes
Every handshake
Sometimes crazy people come into my space
I got to handshake

The planet's more fucked up
Than I'll ever be, I'll ever be
I've got a taste for it
Now I've gotta leave
Goin' down

Sun's comin' down
Sun's comin' down
On me, on me, on me, oh

Shine on (Repeat)
