Who do you follow when you're lost in your dreams ?
Who do you whisper your sweetest melodies ?
In the darkness and the moonlight, you're searching for the one
I will take away those memories 'cause angels like the sun
When you live your dreams, live your life, happiness is now and forever
I want you to know that
You can love, you can fly, don't you know its minor the matter
You know this when you...
When there are crumbles disappears before your eyes
The beyond, the emptiness, there's only you and I
I'm the energy and the thunder that raises through your heart
I'm that everlasting love in you, no matter where you are
When you live your dreams, live your life, happiness is now and forever
I want you to know that
You can love, you can fly, don't you know its minor the matter
You know this when you...
Live your dreams, live your life, happiness is now and forever
I want you to know that
You can love, you can fly, don't you know its minor the matter
You know this when you...
You can live, you can love, you can live, you can love
When you live your dreams, live your life, happiness is now and forever
I want you to know that
You can love, you can fly, don't you know its minor the matter
You know this when you...
Live your dreams, live your life, happiness is now and forever
I want you to know that
You can love, you can fly, don't you know its minor the matter
You know this when you...
You can live, you can love
