It's criminal you'll be my enemy
And I'll do what I must to kill your memory
'Cause all this talk has given me the shakes
Yeah I know we all live to bury our mistakes
But you're gone and gone for good

We were the Lone Ranger and Tonto
Stillborn to cold strangers in our own home
But you took it hard, you took it personal
You know you never really should
When you're gone and gone for good, gone for good

Our igloo will soon be in poisoned silver pools
Where no fever or cool breeze will ever comfort you
Just dead silent still, forever and until
Your landfill swallows every June
And you're gone and gone for good, gone for good, gone for good
