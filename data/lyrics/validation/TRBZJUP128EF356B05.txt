[Verse 1]
I am but a farce, a satire of stability
Insecurity is an uphill struggle
It's me versus the world

[Refrain]
The shore still starves for another
Novel of my shipwrecked being
Tied up, dried, and I'm still breathing
The sands of time, for me, are running out

[Verse 2]
My hands shake in apprehension
Of every action
I'm guilty of
Playing the victim

[Refrain]
The shore still starves for another
Novel of my shipwrecked being
Tied up, dried, and I'm still breathing
The sands of time, for me, are running out

[Chorus]
Just like the embrace of arms that
Made you
Will surely destroy you

[Breakdown]
It's time for your panic
Then it kills
Makes you manic

Making its way inside
Relax it's all right
Making its way inside
Relax it's all right

Panic grips your frantic breathing
I can't breathe, I can't breathe, I can't breathe!

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Just like the embrace of arms that
Made you
Will surely destroy you

[Chorus]
Just like the embrace of arms that
Made you
They'll surely destroy you

Just like the embrace of arms that
Made you
They'll surely destroy you

Just like the embrace of arms that
Made you
They'll surely destroy you

Just like the embrace of arms that
Made you
They'll surely destroy you
