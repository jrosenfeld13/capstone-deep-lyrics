You stabbed me in the back over a sliver
A feeling I have been betrayed
Both hands broken together
Clenching fists cause the rage

It comes in spades
From a life of pain
I don't care 'cause I don't give a fuck
It tears a path right through me

A systematic vision of survival
A struggle I alone engage
Tension burning inside me
Blood so sweet cause revenge

It comes in spades
From a life of pain
I don't care 'cause I don't give a fuck
It tears a path right through me

Revenge is mine
Suffering divine
Fractures break through bone
Frustration won't let go

Filled with lead and
Dumped into the river
And buried in a shallow grave
Both hands broken together
Clenching fists cause the rage

It comes in spades
From a life of pain
I don't care 'cause I don't give a fuck
It tears a path right through me
