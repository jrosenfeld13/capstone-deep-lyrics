My face is set
My goal is clear
I now live in faith
My past is redeemed
I will not flinch in the face of sacrifice
Waging war on the enemy
I choose this path and I won't look back
Moving a head and I won't look back
I have stepped over the line
I won't be luke-warm
I won't be spit out
I cannot be bought, set back, or delayed
I choose this path and I won't look back
To the end of the world and back
As soldiers of God we attack
Watch the enemy flee
Spirit of God be released
