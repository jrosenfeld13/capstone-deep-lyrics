Baby, ask me anything that you want
And I'll look you in the eye now
There can be no surprises
If we mean what we say
I've been around the block
And I've done some things
That I ain't so very proud of
Darlin' help me leave this cloud of
Rolling lonely behind

Naked
I'll stand naked
If you stand naked with me
I'll stand naked with you

In the morning when I look in the mirror
I look twice at what I'm seeing
If those eyes are really me then
Lord, have mercy on my soul
I'm walking forward but I'm walking alone
And I need some understanding
Here, we all need some understanding
And I want you to know

My hands are shaking as I reach for the touch
And all I want to do is hold you
And I want to lose control
You are so easy to crave
The time has come for us to lay it all down
There can be no more denying
If I can't have you I'm dying
A little more every day

Naked
(Take me out from the shadow)
I'll stand naked
(Lead me down to the waters)
If you'll stand naked with me
(Drown my soul in a sea of love)
I'll stand naked with you
(Don't leave me haunted, 'cause)
Naked
(I believe in the searching)
I'll stand naked
(And I'll find my way through the darkness)
If you'll stand naked with me
(There are doors ahead if we see clear)
I'll stand naked with you
(They're falling open)
