I'm gonna burn the silo when you go
I'm gonna burn the silo when you go
Gonna burn the silo, see the flames and then you'll know-
Gonna burn the silo when you go;
When you go...

I'm gonna shoot the livestock when you go
I'm gonna shoot the livestock when you go
Gonna shoot the livestock, I'll put an end to the talk;
I'm gonna shoot the livestock when you go
When you go...

Cause I'm half way drown in this soggy little town
And I can see the silo all arise
Cause I'm half way drown in this soggy little town
And I can see the silo touch the sky

I'm gonna burn the silo when you go
I'm gonna burn the silo when you go
Gonna burn the silo, see the flames and maybe know-
Gonna burn the silo when you go;
When you go...
When you go...
When you go...
When you go...
