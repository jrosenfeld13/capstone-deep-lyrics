So the kids on the internet say that you're a big noise
You made the message board top ten
A thousand bucks to sing your verse and chorus
Until their alcohol's all gone
You need an hour to clean thorns off of roses
From the florist on Peidmont
Maybe they'll say that your big noise voice was golden
When you're at the funeral home
Well they remember more than ever
But I guess we'll never know
If they'll remember it was more than ever
And you were so excited yesterday...
You said you were living loud under the tree tops in the forest dark
But no one knew your name at the local open mic tonight...
You'll only be famous in your underground
You've been Miss Ohio's nameless in her evening gown
And when your voice is wasted and you've lost your sound
You'll know where your plane is when it's going down
We'll barrel and bag up the fallen leaves
