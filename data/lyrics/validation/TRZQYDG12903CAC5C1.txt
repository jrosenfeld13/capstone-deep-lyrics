Welcome back, my friends
To the show that never ends
We're so glad you could attend!
Come inside! Come inside!

There behind a glass
Stands a real blade of grass
Be careful as you pass
Move along! Move along!

Come inside, the show's about to start
Guaranteed to blow your head apart
Rest assured you'll get your money's worth
The greatest show in Heaven, Hell, or Earth

[Chorus:]
You've got to see the show, it's a dynamo
You've got to see the show, it's rock and roll

Right before your eyes
We'll pull laughter from the skies
And he laughs until he cries
Then he dies, then he dies

(repeat Chorus)
(Extended instrumental, mostly keyboard)

Soon the Gypsy Queen
In a glaze of Vaseline
Will perform on guillotine
What a scene! What a scene!
Next upon the stand
Will you please extend a hand
To Alexander's Ragtime Band
Dixieland, Dixieland

Roll up! Roll up! Roll up!
See the show!

Performing on a stool
We've a sight to make you drool
Seven virgins and a mule
Keep it cool. Keep it cool
We would like it to be known
The exhibits that were shown
Were exclusively our own
All our own. All our own

Come and see the show!
Come and see the show!
Come and see the show!
See the show!

See the shoooowwwwwww!
