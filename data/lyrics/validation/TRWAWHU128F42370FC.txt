Kids these days have got it made
Hookin' up to go to the all late show
She's fuckin' hot in the parking lot
Kids these days
(comin' on strong, give it up
Stay out long, don't mess it up)

Turn on the town, shake 'em on down
We're young and loud
Turn up the sound, jump up and down
We're young and loud
Singin' in the crowd, like Charlie Brown
We're young and loud
(Turn on the town, jump up and down
Turn up the sound, jump up and down)

Kids these days have got it made
Always out of town, foolin' round
Sleepin' in the van is the best they can
Kids these days
(Barely getting by, you know straight up
Stay out long, don't mess it up)

Turn on the town, shake 'em on down
We're young and loud (you know straight up)
Turn up the sound, jump up and down
We're young and loud (live it up)
Singin' in the crowd, like Charlie Brown
We're young and loud
Live it up, live it up

Keep spinnin' spinnin' spinnin' spinnin' round and round
Keep spinnin' spinnin' spinnin' spinnin' round and round

Can't knock us out of orbit
Can't pull us to the ground
Keep spinnin' spinnin' spinnin' spinnin' round and round
Never coming down

Kids these days got their ways
Won't listen to a word you say
Call me Pierre cause I don't care
Kids these days
(Barely getting by, you know straight up
Stay out long, don't mess it up)

Turn on the town, shake 'em on down
We're young and loud (you know straight up)
Turn up the sound, jump up and down
We're young and loud (round and round)
Singin' in the crowd, like Charlie Brown
We're young and loud (never comin' down)
Pass it round, never comin' down
We're young and loud
(get up and down, jump up and down)
