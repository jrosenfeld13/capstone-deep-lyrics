[Refrain]
Mama, mama, here comes Doctor Dark
Horse clippin', clappin' 'n his ol' hooves makin' sparks

[Verse 1]
Black leather lady Lord carried her bags
The hell horn, hell horn, hell horn
Horn rim crimped
Glasses look out on the pale hell bent
Moon milk run
O' lady go home
Lord they done cookin' done
Black lady, black leather lady
Black lady, black leather lady
Done had a white, white, white poor son

[Refrain]
Mama, mama, here comes Doctor Dark
Horse clippin', clappin' 'n his ol' hooves makin' sparks
Gotta git me who I want to
God, Lord knows I've got to oh see that Doctor Dark
Mama, mama, here come Doctor Dark
Horse clippin', clappin' 'n his ol' hooves makin' sparks

[Verse 2]
I shed a tear on the meadow lark 'n like
Tear t' drink
T' brush away
'n tear apart 'n black 'n white 'n like
Tear t' drink t' brush away
'n tear apart 'n black 'n white 'n like
The moon a pail of milk spilled down black in the night
Little girl lost a tear
'n her kite
T' the night 'n like 'n light

[Refrain]
God, Lord knows I've got to oh see that Doctor Dark
Gotta git me who I want to
