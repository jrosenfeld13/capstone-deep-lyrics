[Verse 1]
Wanna be attractive, that's next to be
Comin' out on the scene, multiples of three
Full trinity, man you can't be testy
Tried and true, we's your best investment
Always bet on black, black flesh, white shadow
Tough act to follow
Dude, just swallow, you can't spit it out
Not equipped for what you need to get them words out
It ain't workin' out (you feel me, bruh?)
You half-ass the task (we're gettin' rid of ya)
We gon' have to ask ya to make a little room
You missed, gon' swoon
Cocoon ya up, time's up
Like OC ya see
So rough, so tough, fresh gon' (show love)
Fosho, fosheez we's off the heez
SOTs in the place, make ya say "Ooh wee"
I got a bad habit
When I beat the mic, man I had to grab it
I had to snatch it no matter who had it
Made the whole crowd do the Roger Rabbit

[Pre-Chorus]
Man, I'm gettin' hot up here already
Alright
Alright
Alright

[Chorus]
Worldwide, on top forreal
Love life, rock mics forreal
Ezotecs make knocks forreal
Nonstop, forreal
Sure shot, forreal
Alright

[Verse 2]
Don't disturb this group, you will get hurt with boo
She may be drunk be she ain't dumb
You gon' have to leave 'cause you can't come
Get the picture? Get the frame, I'll help you hang
Umm, nah
Pausin' all you cats's jaws, a cause and effect
The fuck? What got you lost in space?
She got a face like Rosario Dawson
Hot in here, caught a ear while you blockin'
T-up so you can free up minutes
Call it how I see it once we up in it
If it's pressed wax, DJs'll spin it
Bukue One the MC, all [?], no gimmick
The shit we dub in it
Don't start what you can't finish
When it's said and done, we win it
Got more pull than a dentist
So envious, y'all just green like spinach
We turn the lights out, all y'all just dim it
Rock mics like three-way, got two girls in a three-way
Here's an instant replay, got your whole style off eBay
Ha, made a [?]

[Pre-Chorus]
D-d-d-damn
D-d-d-damn
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-damn

[Chorus]
Worldwide, on top forreal
Love life, rock mics forreal
Ezotecs make knocks forreal
Nonstop, forreal
Sure shot, forreal
Alright, crazy

[Verse 3]
It's like deep water slang, forreal
Your beats gotta bang forreal
Peeps gotta hang forreal
But just be, don't change forreal
Do you forreal, makin' sure you on top forreal
Don't quit, don't stop, forreal, just rock forreal
Fosheez, fosho, forreal
Make it bounce forreal, Harlem Shake forreal
Let me see your C-walk forreal
Girls just jock forreal, on mine forreal
Wanna feel, wanna ride forreal
All good forreal, forreal it's all good
For y'all good bitches, say "Forreal"

[Pre-Chorus]
And then what I do is just do the "forreals"
And then you come in and do your shit (right)
Alright

[Chorus]
Worldwide, on top forreal
Love life, rock mics forreal
Ezotecs make knocks forreal
Nonstop, forreal
Sure shot, forreal
Worldwide, on top forreal
Love life, rock mics forreal
Ezotecs make knocks forreal
Nonstop, forreal
Sure shot, forreal

[Outro]
Alright
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
I think you're very wise
It's the only way to stop any tittle-tattle
And at the same time, it'll show your music's entirely independent
