See those kids walking down the street
They're so rab, kick'em with your feet
Hit 'em down low, hit 'em up high
Make sure they're dead goodbye
It's a craze from coast to coast

Chorus
Let's go mano! Here we go!
M - A - N - O, Let's go mano

All the kids are out to tonight
Mommy, Daddy say bye-bye
Give me candy, give me food
It is all I wanna do
We won't wait for ufos

Chorus

There's no time to sit around
When we're in South City town
There is nothing else to do
Everybody go mano

See those kids walking down the street
They're so rab, kick'em with your feet
Hit 'em down low, hit 'em up high
Make sure they're dead goodbye
It's a craze from coast to coast

Let's go mano! Here we go!
M - A - N - O, Let's go mano
M - A - N - O, Let's go mano
Let's go mano! Here we go!
Let's go mano! Here we go!
Let's go mano! Here we go!
