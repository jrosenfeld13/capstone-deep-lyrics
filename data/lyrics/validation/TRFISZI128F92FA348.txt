The smell of incense
It fills the air inside this room
Cast of light colorly strewn about the floor
A casket lined with pills
And the bitter taste of absinth
To wash it down

And so it ends like it began
At a cross
Along this interstate
A worn inscription
All cracked and faded
These actions will remain
When bodies turn to dust
And from this monument
I will drown inside the anguish of your heart

A new dawn broke this morning
Tears were raining in this room
As pure as holy water
Reflecting images of you
This world is like a whore
So ravish and so beautiful
So bitter cold and all alone

And if i had my way
We'd wake up on the day we met
I'd stare into your heart for hours
And try to make you hear the sweetest thoughts
But not tonight
We die inside each others arms
We'd revel in our last embrace
I'd steal the breath right from your heart
And kiss you as we die

I rest my lifeless head upon your heart
Forever
I rest my lifeless head upon your heart
Forever
I rest my lifeless head upon your heart
Forever

Maybe i'll bring you sunlight after all
I'm sorry
Maybe i'll bring you sunlight after all
I'm sorry
Maybe i'll bring sunlight after all
I'm sorry
Maybe i'll be sunlight after all
So sorry

Maybe i'll greet sunlight after all
I'm sorry
Maybe i'll greet sunlight after all
