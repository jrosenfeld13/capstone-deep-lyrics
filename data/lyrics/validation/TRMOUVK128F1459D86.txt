[Verse 1:]
Baby, let's just say farewell
Baby, let's just both give in
No, it's not too hard to tell
The walls are closin' in
Oh, it's time to say goodbye
And put this in the past
Even though I know we tried
To save the best for last

[Chorus:]
I guess nothin' stays the same
Still the memories remain
We need all the sweet forgiveness we can find
There's a sadness in the wind
Oh, I wish you well my friend
Only time will mend these broken hearts again

[Verse 2:]
I don't know what's left to say
I don't know where we went wrong
When I watch you walk away
I'll miss you when you're gone
Baby, shed a tear for me
And I'll she da tear for you
Oh, let's set this heartache free
And in time we'll make it through, well

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
There's a sadness in the wind
Oh, I wish you well my friend
Only time will mend these broken hearts again
