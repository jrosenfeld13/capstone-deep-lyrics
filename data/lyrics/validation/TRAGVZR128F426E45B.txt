I know you seen me standing there
Tryin to catch yr eye
Been watchin you for quite some time
But you think i'm an average guy
Gonna figure out my approach
Cos you're such a classy girl
You might be the most beautiful
The most beautiful girl in the world

Standing over there
Looking like a beautiful black queen
I was over there doin my thing
Got distracted by the beauty you bring
Standing over there
Makeup and clothes are so damn clean
Finest girl in the whole damn scene
I gotta get this girl to be with me

Got high hopes
Get this woman of my dreams
Hope to stay together
Got high hopes
Give this woman everything
Make it last forever

Don't wanna come regular
I wanna show you a brand new thing
I don't wanna disrespect you
I wanna do more than buy you things
I only wanna complement you
Forever make you feel free
From the very first moment I saw you
I knew you were the one for me

Standing over there
Looking like a beautiful black queen
I was over there doin my thing
Got distracted by the beauty you bring
Standing over there
Makeup and clothes are so damn clean
Finest girl in the whole damn scene
I gotta get this girl to be with me

Got high hopes
Get this woman of my dreams
Hope to stay together
Got high hopes
Give this woman everything
Make it last forever

I'm finally gonna take my chances
Try to get you in my life
I'm not gonna pass this by
You become some other man's wife
I never felt like this before
Lovin some girl from afar
You shine bright as the sun
I had to know who you were

Standing over there
Looking like a beautiful black queen
I was over there doin my thing
Got distracted by the beauty you bring
Standing over there
Makeup and clothes are so damn clean
Finest girl in the whole damn scene
I gotta get this girl to be with me

Got high hopes
Get this woman of my dreams
Hope to stay together
Got high hopes
Give this woman everything
Make it last forever

Got high hopes
Get this woman of my dreams
Hope to stay together
Got high hopes
Give this woman everything
Make it last forever
