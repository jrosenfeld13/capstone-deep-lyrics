Two divided by love
Can only be one
And one is a lonely number
Two divided by love
Can only be sad
Can only hurt one another

Every night your tears come down
And I know how you're feelin' inside
Loneliness is no one's friend
I've been takin' the same kind of ride
And that just shouldn't be
If you're still lovin' me
Come on baby

Two divided by love
Can only be one
And one is a lonely number
Two divided by love
Can only be sad
Can only hurt one another

I'd by lyin' to myself
If I said I was gettin' along
All I do is think of you and I know
That it's here you belong
Come on girl make your way
We can start from today
Puttin' it back together 'cause

Two divided by love
Can only be one
And one is a lonely number
Two divided by love
Can only be sad
Can only hurt one another

Take away the rain from a flower
And the flower just can't grow
Take away you from me girl
Out of my mind
Out of my mind
Out of my mind
Out of my mind

Two divided by love
Can only be sad
Can only be broken hearted
Two divided and blue
Should take what they had
And go back to where they started

Two divided by love
Can only be one
And one is a lonely number
Two divided by love
Can only be sad
Can only hurt one another
