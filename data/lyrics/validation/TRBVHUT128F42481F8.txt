I've had enough
Not a girl in the world ever touch your stuff so tight
Don't put up a fight
Ooh i've been saving up 'cause we're raving up tonight

I'm blitzed i'm gone
Gonna rant gonna pant gonna turn it on tonight
Do this thing up right ooh
I've been saving up 'cause we're raving up tonight

This place is dead
Gotta wake gotta shake gotta break your head in right
Don't put up a fight ooh
I've been saving up 'cause we're raving up tonight

We're having a rave up
We're having a rave up ooh
We're having a rave up
We're having a rave up ooh
I've been saving up 'cause we're raving up
I've been saving up 'cause we're raving up
I've been saving up 'cause we're raving up tonight
