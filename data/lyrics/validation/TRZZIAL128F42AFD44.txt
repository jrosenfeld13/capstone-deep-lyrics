Hello, my friends I've been neglecting you awhile
Maybe now, we'll know each other better
Time has a way of always turning up a smile
Now, I've got the time to know you better

I'm not as crazy as I used to be
Some of my devils upped and left me free
To find a quite space
I'm not as out of place

I'm not as lonely as I was before
I don't go [Incomprehensible] there's an open door to leave by
I'm starting to believe my own existence
Has a right to be

And I'm coming home again
It's been too long a time, getting back what's mine
And I can't remember why I went away
But it's looking now like maybe I can stay

The poets cry for dreams they never saw
The only certainty is nothing sure
And nothing stays the same
Go back where they came

And though my answers are still undefined
By taking chances, I can start to find some reasons
Something to believe that I can make it through
I can make it through

And I'm coming home again
It's been too long a time, getting back what's mine
And I can't remember why I went away
But it's looking now like maybe I can stay

And I can't remember why I went away
But it's looking now like maybe I can stay
