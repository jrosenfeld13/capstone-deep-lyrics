I left you alone
At four in the morning, not a stitch to wear
'Cos you ignored my warning

You thought it was special
You thought I was wrong
But now I'm telling you
Baby, as I sing this song

I don't love you
I don't want you
If you think that this is cruel, then you should see what my friends do
I don't love you
I don't want you
Leave me alone, you're just a one night stand

I saw you cross a crowded room
You smiled at me and made my heart go boom
I looked at the scoresheet, and saw a seven
So I walked up to you and said "Baby did it hurt when you fell from heaven?"

I don't love you
I don't want you
If you think that this is cruel, then you should see what my friends do
I don't love you
I don't want you
Leave me alone, you're just a one night stand

You're just a one night stand
You're just a one night stand

I don't love you
I don't want you
If you think that this is cruel, then you should see what my friends do
I don't love you
I don't want you
Leave me alone, you're just a one night stand to me
