[Verse 1: Lajon Witherspoon (& Morgan Rose)]
Didn't you hurt yourself?
Couldn't you wash the blood away?
Didn't you love yourself?
(God, God, God, God, God, God)
Couldn't you see the truth?
Didn't you wake to see the light?
Couldn't you hear the truth?
(God, God, God, God, God, God)

[Chorus: Morgan Rose & Lajon Witherspoon]
God, you're so shameless
Stand up to me, I know what you'll say
God, you're so shameless
Why don't you wake up and stop all the pain?
How could you really know as your blood flows
The damage left inside?
If you should ever see the pain in me
You'd wish it away

[Verse 1: Lajon Witherspoon (& Morgan Rose)]
Didn't you hurt yourself?
Didn't you love yourself?
(God, God, God, God, God, God)
Couldn't you find yourself?
Such a shame, it's a waste of life
Couldn't you save yourself?
(God, God, God, God, God, God)

[Chorus: Morgan Rose & Lajon Witherspoon]
God, you're so shameless
Stand up to me, I know what you'll say
God, you're so shameless
Why don't you wake up and stop all the pain?
How could you really know as your blood flows
The damage left inside?
If you should ever see the pain in me
You'd wish it away
How could you really know as your blood flows
The damage left inside?
If you should ever see the pain in me
You'd wish it away

[Morgan Rose & Lajon Witherspoon]
God, you're so shameless
God, you're so shameless
God, you're so shameless
Stand up to me, I know what you'll say
God, you're so shameless
Why don't you wake up and stop all the pain
How could you really know as your blood flows
The damage left inside?
If you should ever see the pain in me
You'd wish it away
How could you really know as your blood flows
The damage left inside?
If you should ever see the pain in me
You'd wish it away
How could you really know?
How could you really know?
