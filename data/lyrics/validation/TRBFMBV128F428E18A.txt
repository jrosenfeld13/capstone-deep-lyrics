The way I want you babe
It's embarrassing
I can't control myself
It's just too much for me
I can't concentrate
I don't know what to say
Except your name baby
The sweetest name

And when we kiss that kiss
That's when it hits
With my heart and soul I say this

8 letters, 3 words, one meaning
In my heart
8 letters, 3 words, one feeling
When it starts

When you say my name
I begin to shake
I break out in a sweat
This is the best it gets
There's nothing second rate
About this feeling babe
It's forever come what may
It's what I hope and pray yeah
And when we kiss that kiss
That's when it hits
With my heart and soul I say this baby

8 letters, 3 words, one meaning
In my heart
8 letters, 3 words, one feeling
When it starts
8 letters, 3 words, one meaning
In my heart
8 letters, 3 words, one feeling
When it starts

It's understanding and it's understood
And baby it sure feels good

8 letters, 3 words, one meaning
In my heart
8 letters, 3 words, one feeling
When it starts

And when we kiss that kiss
That's when it hits
With my heart and soul I say this baby

8 letters, 3 words, one meaning
In my heart
8 letters, 3 words, one feeling
When it starts
