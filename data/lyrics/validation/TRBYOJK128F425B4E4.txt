[Chorus]
Hey hey, don't pay no mind
We are the second
You're minutes behind
So you say, "Yeah, I'm alright"
You are the fortunate all the time
Yeah, you are the fortunate...

[Verse 1]
I've been looking for a way out
Something that isn't so cruel
Well I'm a little tired, you see
Complacent and miserable
I think you're missing out
I think you're dumbing it down
You're past the point of owning up to your words
There's no getting it by us now

[Pre-Chorus]
So if it's okay by you

[Chorus]
Hey hey, don't pay no mind
We are the second
You're minutes behind
So you say, "Yeah, I'm alright"
You are the fortunate all the time

[Verse 2]
So full of misadventure
And feelings insecure
It's so easy
Push the pin
Fake the tense
And give us nothing more

[Pre-Chorus]
And if it's okay by you

[Chorus]
Hey hey, don't pay no mind
We are the second
You're minutes behind
So you say, "Yeah, I'm alright"
You are the fortunate all the time

[Bridge]
And if it's the one thing
That I've been sure of
Well it's okay
I know you've got the time
If it's all one in the same thing
Then I've been waiting for the fallout, we're history
But it's gone on for so long, so long
That I don't think you'll ever be the same

[Chorus]
Hey hey, don't pay no mind
We are the second
You're minutes behind
So you say, "Yeah, I'm alright"
You are the fortunate all the time

Hey hey, yeah, pay no mind
We are the second
You're minutes behind
So you say, "Yeah, I'm alright"
You are the fortunate all the time

[Outro]
Hey Hey (don't pay no mind)
Heyo hey (we are the second, you're minutes behind)
Heyo heyo heyo (So you say, "Yeah I'm alright")
Heyo Heyo Heyo (You are the fortunate all the time)
