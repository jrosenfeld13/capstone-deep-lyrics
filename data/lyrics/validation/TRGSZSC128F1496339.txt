Everybody's talkin' at me
I don't hear a word they're sayin'
Only the echoes of my mind

People stop and stare at me
I don't see their faces
Only the shadows of their eyes

I'm goin' where the sun keeps shinin'
Through the pourin' rain
Goin' where the weather suits my clothes, yeah
Bankin' off of the northeast wind
Sailin' on a summer breeze
Skippin' over the ocean like a stone
Oh yeah...

I'm goin' where the sun keeps shinin'
Through the pourin' rain, yeah
Goin' where the weather suits my clothes
You know it's gotta suit my clothes
Bankin' off of the northeast wind
Sailin' on a summer breeze
Skippin' over the ocean like a stone
Hey...

Everybody's talkin' at me
I don't hear a word they're sayin'
Only the echoes of my mind

Everybody's talkin' at Stevie
But he don't hear a word they're sayin'
And I ain't gonna let you leave my love behind
Oh yeah...
