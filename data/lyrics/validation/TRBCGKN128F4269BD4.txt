My, my said the beggar man
What you give and what you take
Are two different things
Eat up what you've got
Evil winds that drag your bones to rot
Evil winds that'll set, set me free

Suicide of the first division
Found dead with a noose wrapped around your head
No one cared to raise an eye
Don't it make you wanna' scream, scream till they cry
Evil winds that'll set, set me free

Please brother can you spare me a dime
To buy some bread and a bottle of wine
I'll never ask for anything again
Just help me, help me to survive

Evil winds that'll set, set me free
Please brother can you spare me a dime
To buy some bread and a bottle of wine
I'll never ask for anything again
Just help me make it through the
Help me make it through
Help me make it through
Help me make it through
Make it through the night

High tide like a wishing well
The thoughts of Balrog flowing through my head
Please time won't you take me back
To the lands and paths
From where I came
From where I came
Evil winds that'll set, set me free
