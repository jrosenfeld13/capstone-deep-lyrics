So you're alive now aim a bit higher
Put the stars to shame
From the turn of summer to nowhere
With no one to blame
Now is the right time
Kill another long day
If only for a lifetime
Aim too high see us all in ribbons
See us back in control
Take sides are you over that? (maybe)
Sun shine over you
Sun shine over you
You'll never be alone
Now is the right time
Kill another long day
If only for a life time
Last stop before the sea and one last
Resurgance of energy (anytime)
Clear out some old debris (everytime)
Fall out to some degree
Enough's enough now
Now is the right time
Kill another long day
If only for a lifetime
For a lifetime
