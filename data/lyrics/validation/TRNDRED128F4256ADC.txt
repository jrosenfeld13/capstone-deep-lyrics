Walls collapse onto me
I ride the storm of rage
A mistake became a chain
Reaction and the reflection falls upon me
It's time for change
Understanding and
Faith are what friends are about
But on every corner
Disappointment
(Is waiting, every wall would have understood me better)
I am cold
I stand alone and all that remains is the hope
For help
The anger is strong and threatens to destroy me
Because what was will never be again
To much has happened and the mind becomes dull
I is the tragedy of time
Asea of tears for grief
But from the shadows of my tears
Of my past
You come and give me your hand
Tame my anger
My tears fade and together we fight as friend
Together we fight as friend for (The) time
