You're looking at me but you can't see me
I'm invisible to the naked eye
I'm a part of everything you're doing
I'm a part of you down deep inside
I'm the part that sings those gooffy love songs
I'm the part of you you can't control
I'm the part that fucked up your promotion
I'm the part that hurts when you're alone
On this beautiful night by the bright disco light
We will dance till the pain is all gone

If love is alive why can't I touch it?
Does it feel like Jell-O or a fire?
I can tell by the taste it was not poison
But it sure did mess up my insides

There's nothing else like you on my planet
You see me now in my true form
I did not come here in a spaceship
I came the moment you were born

On this beautiful night by the bright disco light
We will dance till the pain is all gone
