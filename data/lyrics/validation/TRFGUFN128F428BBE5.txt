You just walked out the door
You left me with a feeling of still wanting more
Are we done now, who knows?
Well, I guess that's the way cruel love goes

I can't act like before
The words still come out but the contents is poor
My hunger is bad, nights too long
Tell me, where did I go wrong?

Don't kill the flame, the spark to my aim
Please let it burn even though I'm to blame
Don't steal my heart or don't break it apart
You're the spark to my aim so don't kill the flame

You still got me on hold
I'm close to perdition but yet I feel cold
You say time heals the scar
I'd say that depends on who you are

Love starts in heaven but ends on the ground
And clearly I somehow fell down
I know you're still up there since you're not around
So what will it be now an angel or clown?
