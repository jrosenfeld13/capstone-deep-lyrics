I gave you everything I had
You took my heart and broke it bad
I'm not the kind who can take it alone
I've got nothing more for you
I want somebody who needs me too

I've given up, boy
I'm chasing my joy
And you can make your own
You're not the only one
Cause my time will come

You can shatter glass
With your heart of stone
But you won't get far on your own

You keep running hot
And blowing cold
And everything you hold
Just falls apart like shattered glass

It really doesn't matter to me
Where you're going and who you see
I know that I can make it this time
It doesn't matter any more

Since you've gone and walked out that door
I made a new start
I found a true heart
I'm gonna make it mine
Go out and have your fun
Cause my time will come

You can shatter glass
With your heart of stone
But you won't get far on your own

You keep running hot
And blowing cold
And everything you hold
Just falls apart like shattered glass

You can shatter glass
You can shatter glass

You're not the only one
Go out and have your fun
Cause my time will come

You can shatter glass
With your heart of stone
But you won't get far on your own

You keep running hot
And blowing cold
And everything you hold
Just falls apart like shattered glass
