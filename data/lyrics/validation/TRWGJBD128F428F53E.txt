Well I wake up in the morning
Look at my clock
It's way past noon time
Now I'm late for work

Tell me, tell me
What have I done wrong?
Ain't nothing go right with me
Must be I've been smoking too long

Well I go to find me some breakfast
But I ain't got no food
Take me a shower
But the water don't feel no good

Tell me Tell Me...

I've got opium in my chimney
No other life to choose
Nightmare made of hash dreams
Got the devil in my shoes

Tell me Tell me...

Well when I'm smoking
Put my worries on a shelf
Don't think about nothin'
Try not to see myself

Tell me Tell me...

Well in this blues I'm singin'
There's a lesson to be learned
Don't go around smokin'
Unless you want to get burned

Tell me, tell me
What have I done wrong?
Ain't nothing go right with me
Must be I've been smoking too-
Ain't nothing go right with me
Must be I've been smoking too-
Everything going wrong with me
Must be I've been smoking too long
