[Verse 1]
Hmm.. Oh
Too much of anything can make you sick
Even the good can be a curse (curse)
Makes it hard to know which road to go down
Knowing too much can get you hurt
Is it better, is it worse?
Are we sitting in reverse?
It's just like we're going backwards
I know where I want this to go
Driving fast but let's go slow
What I don't wanna do is crash, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Just know that you're not in this thing alone
There's always a place in me you can call home
Whenever you feel like we're growing apart
Let's just go back, back, back, back
Back to the start

[Chorus]
Anything that's worth having
Is sure enough, worth fighting for
Quitting's out of the question
When it gets tough
Gotta fight some more
We've gotta fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight for this love
We've gotta fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight for this love
We've gotta fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight for this love
If it's worth having
It's worth fighting for

[Verse 2]
Now everyday ain't gonn' be no picnic
Love ain't a walk in the park
All you can do is make the best of it now
Can't be afraid of the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
Just know that you're not in this thing alone
There's always a place in me you can call home
Whenever you feel like we're growing apart
Let's just go back, back, back, back
Back to the start

[Chorus]
Anything that's worth having
Is sure enough, worth fighting for
Quitting's out of the question
When it gets tough
Gotta fight some more
We've gotta fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight for this love
We've gotta fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight for this love
We've gotta fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight for this love
If it's worth having
It's worth fighting for

[Bridge]
I don't know where we're heading
I'm willing and ready to go
We've been driving so fast
We just need to slow down
And just roll

[Outro]
We've gotta fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight for this love
We've gotta fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight for this love
We've gotta fight, fight, fight, fight
Fight for this love
If it's worth having
It's worth fighting for
