Feel the radiation burn
Hope there's none left for you
You're searchin' for a place to hide
Why there's no where to run

Out of the sky you're the first one to die
Out of the sky you never know why
Out of the sky you're the first one to die
Out of the sky

It killed your friends and enemies
No leaves no one alive
It killed anything no one survive
My god in a dessert of storm

The clear blue sky has turned to red
There's no more life on planet earth
Now radiation is mighty king
There's no more life not anything
