I picture you on the beach
Lying in the sand
Out of reach of my trembling hands
I picture you in a car
Your hair in the wind
I picture you in my arms
The touch of your skin
The smile on your face
The way that you taste

You come to my senses
Every time I close my eyes
I have no defences
You come to my senses
I can't stop this ache inside
I have no defences

Driving home in the cold January rain
I've got to find a way out of this pain
I reach for you in the night
I dream of your kiss
I wake before it gets light
Your name on my lips
Alone in my bed
Your voice in my head

You come to my senses
Every time I close my eyes
I have no defences
You come to my senses
I can't stop this ache inside
I have no defences

I picture you in my arms
The touch of your skin
The smile on your face
The way that you taste

You come to my senses
Every time I close my eyes
I have no defences
You come to my senses
I can't stop this ache inside
I have no defences
You come to my senses
