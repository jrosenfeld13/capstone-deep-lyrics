When it's decoration day up in Heaven
There's a bouquet I'm longing to see
There's a flower somewhere in this bouquet
And means all the world to me

Now, tonight the old home place's lonely
Since Mother has been called away
And I know I can never more see her
'Til we meet on that decoration day

When it's decoration day up in Heaven
There's a bouquet I'm longing to see
There's a flower somewhere in this bouquet
And means all the world to me

I remember the night the angels called her
To live on that beautiful shore
It left us so lonely here without her
It can never be home anymore

When it's decoration day up in Heaven
There's a bouquet I'm longing to see
There's a flower somewhere in this bouquet
And means all the world to me
