[Verse]
Send me some loving
Send it I pray
How can I love you
When you're far away?
Oh, send me your picture
Send it, my dear
So I can hold it
Pretend you are here
Can you send me your kisses?
I still feel their touch
I need you so badly
I miss you so much

[Chorus][x2]
My days are so lonely
My nights are so blue
I'm here and I'm lonely
I'm waiting for you
