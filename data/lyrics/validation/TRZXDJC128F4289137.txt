If you've never been
In love, and your longing
For the happiness it brings
Try your wings
If your hungry for the
Sound of a lover
Saying sentimental things
Try your wings
Even the tiniest
Bluebird, has to
Leave its nest to fly
What a bluebird can
Do you can do too
If you try
If you've always had
A dream, and you've
Been afraid that it
Would not come
True hither to
Fall in love and
You will find that it's
Just what you've been
Dreaming of
The first love never
Comes twice. So
Take this tender advice
When it comes
Try your wings and
Fly to the one you love
