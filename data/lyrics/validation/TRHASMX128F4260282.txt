The sound alone will make me move along
This thing speaks, youre often on
The sound alone, yeah, yeah
All the song now
The hiding measure, you wont get them
And when youre down youre down all bound
The crazy town, all way down

If you last long the warning hound
The warning down, youre all, yeah
The fregging down, they soothe my neck
The fregging town, its all down
This walking all around
This walking all through town
Wont you laugh?

Its Monday while I write
And better ever laugh alright
Do no lie just all life
Better ever laugh alright that
What time, just my life
Is ever hanging out of the day
A better life, its all I like
Its better walking all around

Ever back, its all, its all alive
Ever back, its all, its all alive

Forget one life, its all their life
We make you people all laugh
Forget one life and parts he correct
Forget it and support all parts of life
Supporting one life is just breaking time
The magics better all alone
Just falling alone, the threshold of life
Livings taking all of my morning life

Back, its all, its all going in my pocket
Back, its all the morning of my life

All string
Its all and now
Laying down to the ground
Is it a mind or is it a grawl?
For its all sense, its all
Or is it a game
Or is it a game?

Its just in, hes just tall
I wouldnt laugh
