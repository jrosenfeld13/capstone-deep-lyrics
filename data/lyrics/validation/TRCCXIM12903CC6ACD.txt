Moving, just keep moving
'Till I don't know what's sane
I've been moving so long
The days all feel the same

Moving, just keep moving
Well I don't know why to stay
No ties to bind me
No reasons to remain

Got a low, low feeling around me
And a stone cold feeling inside
And I just can't stop messing my mind up
Or wasting my time

There's a low, low feeling around me
And a stone cold feeling inside
I've got to find somebody to help me
I keep you in mind

So I'll keep moving, just keep moving
Well I don't know who I am
No need to follow
There's no way back again

Moving, keep on moving
Where I feel I'm home again
And when it's over
I'll see you again

Got a low, low feeling around me
And a stone cold feeling inside
And I just can't stop messing my mind up
Or wasting my time

There's a low, low feeling around me
And a stone cold feeling inside
I've got to find somebody to help me
I keep you in mind
