Are you afraid of things like
Holding hands
Or breaking strings
The ties that bind you are the
Ties
That will blind you in the end
Are you afraid of letting go
Of everything you built so
Slowly
To protect you from the holes
In the stories that you told

Are you leaving me tonight
Because of the timing or the
Fight
A convenient out to save your
Pride
Steal away and not do the time

And if you're going out again
Say hello to your new friend
I hope he doesn't break your
Heart
I hope he doesn't tear you apart
