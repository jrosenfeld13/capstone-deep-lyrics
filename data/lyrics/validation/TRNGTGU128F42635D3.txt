[Keeps me from going insane]
[Keeps me from going insane]

Feels like I'm going crazy
(Na na na na)
Feels like I'm going insane
(Na na na na)

(Na na na na, na na na)

Feels like I'm going crazy
(Na na na na)
Feels like I'm going insane
(Na na na na)

Get's me through another day
Get's me through another day!

I searched all over, could not find
Someone to hold, some peace of mind
Yesterday is gone, nothing else to do
But let it go before I lose

All of my hopes and dreams
For something that ain't real
Things ain't always what they seem...

'Cos there's sunshine after the rain
('Cos there's sunshine after the rain)
And after the night comes morning
(The night comes morning)
And in the spring, the flowers bloom again
When I'm feeling down, there's no way out
I know the love I had inside will make it alright

And when it feels like I'm going crazy
(Na na na na)
Feels like I'm going insane
(Na na na na)
And it feels like I'm going crazy
Found a cure to get me through another day

Feels like I'm going crazy
(Na na na na)
Feels like I'm going insane
(Na na na na)
Feels like I'm going crazy
Found a cure to get me through another day

Found a cure
(Found a cure)
To get me through another day
(To get me through another day)

Found a cure
(Found a cure)
To get me through another day
(To get me through another day)
[Keeps me from going insane]

Found a cure
(Found a cure)
To get me through another day
(To get me through another day)

Found a cure
(Found a cure)
To get me through another day
(To get me through another day)
[Keeps me from going insane]

How many times before have you
Been left alone and you feel confused?
Do you have the strength to keep trying
When the walls just keep on closing in?

But you got everything that you need
Inside your heart if you just believe
Things ain't always as they seem...

'Cos there's sunshine after the rain
(Sunshine after the rain)
And after the night comes morning
(The night comes morning)
And in the spring, the flowers bloom again
When I'm feeling down, there's no way out
I know the love I had inside will make it alright

And when it feels like I'm going crazy
(Na na na na)
Feels like I'm going insane
(Na na na na)
And it feels like I'm going crazy
Found a cure to get me through another day

Feels like I'm going crazy
(Na na na na)
Feels like I'm going insane
(Na na na na)
And it feels like I'm going crazy
Found a cure to get me through another day

(Na na na na)

(Get me through another day!)
(Get me through another day!)

Found a cure
(Found a cure)
To get me through another day
(To get me through)
(To get me through another day)

Found a cure
(Found a cure)
To get me through another day
(It get's me through, get's me though)
(Get's me through another day)

Found a cure
(Found a cure)
To get me through another day
(To get me through another day)
[Keeps me from going insane]

Found a cure

To get me through another day
