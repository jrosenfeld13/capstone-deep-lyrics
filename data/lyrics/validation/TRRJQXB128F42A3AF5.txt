I've fallen, yeah I've fallen before
I thought I knew exactly what was in store

Chorus:
Gone off the deepest end
Not jumping, diving in
He's a perfect 10 times 10 times 10
And I'm head over heels
No, I'm head over high heels

I'm dreaming, in colors I've never seen
My heart is bursting wide at the seams
I've taken my smiling to the extremes
All my friends are wondering

Chorus:
Gone off the deepest end
Not jumping, diving in
He's a perfect 10 times 10 times 10
And I'm head over heels

I'm ecstatic
I'm not a lunatic
Just a fanatic
You might think I'm overdramatic
Not me

Chorus (repeat twice):
Gone off the deepest end
Not jumping, diving in
He's a perfect 10 times 10 times 10
And I'm head over heels
No, I'm head over high heels
