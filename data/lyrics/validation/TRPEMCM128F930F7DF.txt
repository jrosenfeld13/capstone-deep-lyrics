Ayo
Straight out The Garden of England
The green-fingered horticulturalist
Herbalist
Abstract verbalist
Words I twist like Chubby Checker
The wordsmith
Burn spliffs on a double decker
And that's word to Mark Hammond
I'm a shark, you're a salmon
Get played like backgammon
Get dropped from the top of the Grand Canyon
I bang
Like a badman with a hand cannon
(Pow!)
When my sound gets played
It's like a round gets sprayed
Pounds get paid
You get cut down to size like an eighth
When an ounce gets weighed
Now let's blaze
Hydroponical trees in tropical breeze
Legacy left for the prodigal seeds
I see tragedy in comical scenes
Comedy in tragic events
Charmed by the magic of pens
I'm back in the ends
You don't know?
Better and ask your friends
Better take two draw of the grass
Then pass the peng
It's gotta last till the last man's charged with zen
I send love to my loved ones
None to them trust fund kids
That are fronting in slums
Getting lump sums
Thinking it's fun to be skint
Them are dumb cunts
I'm tryna be on a beach sipping rum punch
I ain't bougie
But life's like a movie
And I'm just an extra
Vexed and I'm moody
Excuse me
But can I please get a speaking part?
Or one-line, at least
That'd be a start
Ya see me, I graft
I ain't tryna starve for my art or my craft
But I'm paddling
Upstream on a broken raft
Too many little men
Napoleon Bonaparte
Blast that are Noah's ark
So we're ever ready to defend that
Bevvy in my hand, head heavy off a ten bag
Of green crack
You see me Baron Greenback
Stacking greenbacks
Packing green in the treelab
My GP just released me from rehab
And all I need is hot water, milk and a tea bag
Maybe some Hobnobs
Ladies that slob knobs
James Bond making odd job through his odd jobs
I'm a top notch orator
Pot crop connoisseur
Hot box spots in your college dorm
Burst out the swamp like frogspawn
[?] dipped dick
While you squirt over soft porn
Actions
Louder than the words of your long talk
I smoke the philosopher's stone up at Hogwart's
Stinking like bong water
Spilt on a dirty rug
Ali Baba
Forty thieves plus thirty thugs
Twenty tons of Class A drugs
The body of a man with the wings of a dove, I done
Fucked Barbarella
Indiana Jones, put your head in the propeller
They ain't ready for the fella [?]
Who appears in a cloud of boon
Now I'm out of town like Ronaldo [?]
I'm too heavy!
For these weak mind fools
Too ready to attack
Gotta keep my cool...
