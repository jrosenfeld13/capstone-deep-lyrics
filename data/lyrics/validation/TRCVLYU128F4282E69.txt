Take it from a well-known man
You can count on the fine performances
And hear them sayin
"It's never twice the same, baby."

Come around the bend once more
And believe in the son's abilities
I know he's watching
And always listening to me

The seeds come alive with the things they can grow
He may be a talented man
But I told you, "Believe in the things that you know."
Baby, I trust that you can, trust you can

Come across a lifeless bore
And I wonder if he knows anything
I feel like laughing
But I don't have to say nothing

Step in through a well-shut door
And come in the brave new scenery
They move like switches
On all the rusted old machinery

The seeds come alive and continue to grow
He may be a talented man
But I told you, "Believe in the things that you know."
Baby, I trust that you can, trust you can
