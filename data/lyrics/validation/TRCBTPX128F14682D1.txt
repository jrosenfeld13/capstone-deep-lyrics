And when I look out my window
What do I see
The old grinder selling
Sawdust balls with a moth-eaten parrot
And he plays
Watch the children play on Paradise Passage Road
I see the best things aren't free
Despite everything
This old grinder still in love
With a shiny-scaled mermaid
Quick-tailed
Some... Some place between him and a myth
And he plays
What is forever
Are there things we can change
And the parrot
He says
I... I believe in the sun and the sky
Words that just don't seem to tell me why
