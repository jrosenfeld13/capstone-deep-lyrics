Anything for you
Is what you told me
The day i sat there with you
So alone
Nothing lasts forever
When will we realize its gone?
Anything for you
Is what you told me
The day i sat there with you
Did we understand that words were not enough?
You said to me that this would last forever
Why did we rely on
The time when i said i can't live without you?
Its all over now
Why you?
You walked away
Why you?
You said that i dont wanna work it out
You know that i try
I do lie sometimes
We're just wasting time
Why did we rely on the time when i lie?
The time when i said i can't live without you?
I know you say to me that things have changed
I look in your eyes
And i know that things will remain the same
You said that i follow you, yea
We've lost it all again
