[Verse 1]
Waiting for a beam to break through here
A chain way vision, all bright and clear
And they talk, and they dance

I was expecting something pure, with a golden hair
Arms full of bracelets and smoke in the air
And they talk, and they dance

Here comes darkness, just after noon
Waiting for a sign; if I survive, Ill worship the moon
Or something, anything

[Chorus]
This must be it, long for bliss
First it was so quiet, now I know Im not alone in here
And they talked, and they danced

[Verse 2]
Two omens collide in my open hand
Making me a viewer, I am what I have seen
And they talk, and they dance

Your hand on my hips, speak friendly to me
Ive been studying for years, patiently
Is this as far as you can take me?

[Chorus]
This must be it, long for bliss
First it was so quiet, now I know Im not alone in here
And they talked, and they danced

This must be it, long for bliss
First it was so quiet, now I know Im not alone in here
And they talked, and they danced

This must be it, long for bliss
First it was so quiet, now I know Im not alone in here

This must be it, long for bliss
First it was so quiet, now I know Im not alone in here
And they talked, and they danced
