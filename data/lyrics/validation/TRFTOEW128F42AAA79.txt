[Intro: Mr. Mixx]
Big booty hoes, up wit it
Hoochie mamas, up wit it
Let me see ya touch the ground

[Verse 1: Brother Marquis]
I don't know my reputation
But all the niggas in the hood say It's all good
But the bitch ain't shit, so you need to make a switch
Smackin' on ya lips with your hands on your hips
Triflin' slimy, don't try me
Playin' on the phone? You supposed to be grown
Bitch, stop lyin', I ain't with it
Keep runnin' ya mouth and I'ma stick my dick in it
Hoochie hood rat needs home training
Ghetto ass always complaining
Tryin' to clown in front of my friends
By the way, bitch, can I get those ends?
Fuck theatrics, you ain't no actress
Lay on the mattress and let a nigga splak it
The bitch is full of drama
Hoochie hood rat is a ho like her momma

[Chorus: Mr. Mixx]
She ain't nothin' but a hoochie mama
Hood rat, hood rat, hoochie mama
Yeah, she ain't nothin' but a hoochie mam
Hood rat, hood rat, hoochie mama
Yeah, she ain't nothin' but a hoochie mama
Hood rat, hood rat, hoochie mama
Yeah, she ain't nothin' but a hoochie mama
Hood rat, hood rat, hoochie mama

[Verse 2: Fresh Kid Ice]
Ho I love your big brown eyes
And the way you shake your thighs
Actin' like you're so damn cute
Let a real nigga just knock them boots
I don't need no confrontation
All I want is an ejaculationn
'Cause I like them ghetto hoochies
Ones who like to pop that coochie
(Ooh-wee)
Miami style
Makin' niggas smile, bitch get wild
'Cause freaky shit is what I like
And I love to see two bitches dyke
My favorite time is 69
Bitch, you know it's hoochie time
Fuck what you heard and save the drama
All I want is my hoochie mama

[Chorus: Luke]
You ain't nothin' but a hoochie mama
Hood rat, hood rat, hoochie mama
You ain't nothin' but a hoochie mama
Hood rat, hood rat, hoochie mama
You ain't nothin' but a hoochie mama
Hood rat, hood rat, hoochie mama
You ain't nothin' but a hoochie mama
Hood rat, hood rat, hoochie mama

[Verse 3: Marquis]
Mama just don't understand
Why I love your hoochie ass
Sex is what I need you for
I got a good girl, but I need a whore
I like my bitch promiscuous
Hot in the ass and ready to fuck
Foreplay your way, our way, my way
Trick or freak, and I hit it on Friday

[Verse 4: Kid Ice]
Girl, you know you look so cute
Ridin' 'round town in ya Daisy Dukes
Come on over for a visit
Let a nigga ride in ya Civic
'Cause I like them ghetto hoochies
One who got them big ol' booties
Save the drama for your mama
All I want is my hoochie mama

[Chorus: Luke]
You ain't nothin' but a hoochie mama
Hood rat, hood rat, hoochie mama
You ain't nothin' but a hoochie mama
Hood rat, hood rat, hoochie mama
You ain't nothin' but a hoochie mama
Hood rat, hood rat, hoochie mama
You ain't nothin' but a hoochie mam
Hood rat, hood rat, hoochie mama

[Luke]
Breakdown
Breakdown
God damn
God damn
God damn

[Chorus: Mr. Mixx]
You ain't nothin' but a hoochie mama
Hood rat, hood rat, hoochie mama
Yeah, she ain't nothin' but a hoochie mama
Hood rat, hood rat, hoochie mama
You ain't nothin' but a hoochie mama
Hood rat, hood rat, hoochie mama
Yeah, she ain't nothin' but a hoochie mama
Hood rat, hood rat, hoochie mama
