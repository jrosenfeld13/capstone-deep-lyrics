Fopped last night and the night before
I had to fopp outside and then I went indoors
Fopped so hard I made the people warm
They stood back and gave me all the floor

I did the fopp, the fopp
They wouldnt let me stop
Yeah I was foppin and rockin
Had the house hoppin

Foppin', the way it makes you go, everybody was
Foppin', everywhere you go, do all your
Shoppin', wiggle to the floor, everybody was foppin

Fopp with me and Ill fopp with you
Foppin is the brand new thing to do
Fopped so hard that I lost my shoe
I fopped so tough they had to make some room

Break your leg, dont you fopp your back
Do your thing, dont you give no slack
Shake your hips and then you turn around
Well first you fopp it up
And then you fopp it down

Fopp me right, dont you fopp me wrong
Well be here foppin all night long
Im too short, baby, and youre too tall
But when were foppin that dont mean a thing at all

Foppin', the way it makes you go, everybody was
Foppin', everywhere you go, do all your
Shoppin', wiggle to the floor, everybody was foppin
