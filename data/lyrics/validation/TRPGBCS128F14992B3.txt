Haggard

The warden led a prisoner down the hallway to his doom
And I stand up to say good-bye like all the rest
Then I heard him tell the warden just before he reached my cell
'Let my guitar playing, friend, do my request'

Want you sing me back home with a song I used to hear ?
Make my old memories come alive ?
And take me away and turn back the years
Sing me back home before I die

And I remember Sunday evening when a choir came in from town
And got up to sing a few old gospel song
Then I heard him tell the singers : 'There's a song my mama sang'
'Could you sing it once before we move along ?'

Want you sing me back home with a song I used to hear ?
Make my old memories come alive ?
And take me away and turn back the years
Sing me back home before I die

Want you sing me back home before I die ?
