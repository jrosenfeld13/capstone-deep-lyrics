Mrs. Hayes
Takes a fork
And stabs in her husband's neck

Rips his tounge
From his throat
And slashes at his fatty jowls

It's just a dream
A drunken dream
But it makes her feel better

30 Years
Of wasted...

Mr. Hayes
Lives alone
With his maid and cook

"Get over here!
Get over here!
Christ! You're an idiot!"

30 Years
Of wasted life

My small comfort when I go
When I go
Is he'll be rotting in a home
A breathing corpse
Open casket Mr. Hayes
When I go

You...
..Gave...
..Me...
..NOTHING!!!

NO-O-O-O-O-O!!!
