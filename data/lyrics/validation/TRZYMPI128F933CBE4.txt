[Verse 1]
This is the accent of the half-hearted land
Does it all make sense now?
And if the ship was built in bottled sand
Does it all make sense now?
The anchor's kiss was scrawled in dyslexic crayon
Does it all make sense now?

[Chorus]
Is this just a life preserver or a bivouac tenure?
The Tropic of Cancer answered, "drink the quicksand"

[Verse 2]
A mirror was splintered on the deck's floor
Does it all make sense now?
A stowaway that lived beneath this hull
Does it all make sense now?
The anchor's kiss was scrawled in dyslexic crayon
Yes, it all makes sense now

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Its gills will swim faster after a breath from the shore
Is this just a life preserver or a bivouac tenure?

[Bridge] (x2)
Breathe the taste of salt water, dry heave up and overboard
Ponce de Leon wrinkles, let's make it young again
(Boat drinks for captains, row our boat stowaway)

[Chorus 1]

Its gills will swim faster after a breath from the shore

[Outro] (x2)
All makes sense now
If your map was torn, navigate, navigate
All makes sense now
If your compass broke, navigate, navigate
