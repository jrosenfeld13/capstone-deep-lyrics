Tree grow to new dimensions
Leaves fall further than before
TV's blare with the sound of confusion
Music keeps playing about illusions

There are so many tomorrows
That I'm never sure
Until, my love
You're mine once more

Tree grow to new dimensions
Leaves fall further than before
TV's blare with the sound of confusion
Until you're mine, once more
