Said my puppy, "go with my ego." White finger nail spots reflections in more than one mirror
DOT-TWO-DAH
Watching airplanes take off, you could have me climbing walls
Be a prime number, a handful of glue
The glue of night, it's yellow strange to the touch
Metal disturbs reception
This is why they don't accept coins in space
Shoeshine boogiex2 OOOOOOoo

OOOOO (refrain) When you didn't like me, I didn't like myself
When you loved me later, I fell apart
Jelly fish reaction, constellations in the sky
Can't ya see the space is underwater. (oo
OOOoo
Ooooo
OOooooo

OOOO (refrain) Go with my ego. "
Go with my ego," said my puppyx2

Shoeshine boogiex2 ooooo000ooooo (refrain) shoeshine boogiex2 ooooo00ooooo

OOO (refrain) Will I ever have ideas of my own?
Tuning echos conducting rubber dollys
Numerous goodtimes: birdies, dogs, and peach trees
Better go and sleep on the stamp pad tonight
