Love in a world gone mad
Love in a world gone mad

Love in a world gone mad
The best thing we"ll ever have
Love in a world gone mad
Love in a world gone mad
The best thing we"ll ever have
Love in a world gone mad

Love in a world gone mad
The best thing we"ll ever have
Love in a world gone mad
And it"s so precious what"s between us two is...

Both sides of your window
Something crazy"s going on
Troubles in and outside
It"s hard to tell where you belong

Time and time again
Out searching for that silver lining friend
You keep holding on, holding on

Love in a world gone mad
The best thing we"ll ever have
Love in a world gone mad
And it"s so precious that I promise anytime
You want to spread your wings and fly
Just say the word
If what we"ve found is love
When you fly back I won"t be hurt

Time and time again
The fire"s gonna die and then burn bright
If we keep holding on, yeah holding on

Love in a world gone mad
The best thing we"ll ever have
Love in a world gone mad
And it"s so precious what"s between us two is
Love in a world gone mad
The best thing we"ll ever have
Love in a world gone mad
And it"s so precious that I promise any...
Love in a world gone mad
The best thing we"ll ever have
Love in a world gone mad
And it"s so precious what"s between us two is

Love in a world gone mad
The best thing we"ll ever have
Love in a world gone mad
Love in a world gone mad
And it"s so precious what"s between us two is

Love in a world gone mad
The best thing we"ll ever have
Love in a world gone mad
And it"s so precious what"s between us two is

Love in a world gone mad Aah
