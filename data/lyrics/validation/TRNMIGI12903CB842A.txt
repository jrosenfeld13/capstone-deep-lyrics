Cat's a-sleeping in the sun
Eyes take heed the colours call
Sunlight patterns touch the wall
Red kerchiefs sail and fall
Cat's a sleeping in the sun

Dragon kite in the sky
Wheel and turns, spin and fly
Attacked by rooks and never fail
To cry the sound of fairy tales
The cat is walkin' in the sun

All the pebbles I have seen
Precious stones for Colleen
Every minute I pass through
With the grooves spent with you
The cat is yawning in the sun

Jewelled castles I have built
With freak feelings of guilt
And the words stab to the hilt
Pick the flower and it will wilt
Cat's a-shifting in the sun

Marionette dangles death
Insensitivity is fed
By the TV wizard's wand
Once in the spell you're conned
Cat's a-smiling in the sun

Cat's a-smiling in the sun
Eyes take heed the colours call
Sunlight patterns touch the wall
Red kerchiefs sail and fall
Cat's a-smiling in to me
