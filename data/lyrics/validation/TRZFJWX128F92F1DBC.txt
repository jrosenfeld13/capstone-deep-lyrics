All of the lonely nights
Waiting for you to come, longing to hold you tight
I need you so desperately
Waiting for you to come bringing your love to me

But, I'd wait a million years
Walk a million miles, cry a million tears
I'd swim the deepest sea
Climb the highest hill, just to have you near me

As love is reality
When you are near to me, I am in ecstasy
I'd swallow the pain and pride
Baby, I just can't hide all that I feel inside

And, I'd wait a million years
Walk a million miles, cry a million tears
I'd swim the deepest sea
Climb the highest hill, just to have you near me

A million years, I would wait for you
A million tears, baby I'd be true
A million miles, I would follow you
A million years, if you want me to

Pacing the floor, detest
Sweat pouring down my chest, still I can't love you less
It's worth all the pain and pride
Baby, I just can't hide all that I feel inside

And, I'd wait a million years
Walk a million miles, cry a million tears
I'd swim the deepest sea
Climb the highest hill, just to have you near me

I'd wait a million years
Walk a million miles, cry a million tears
I'd swim the deepest sea
Climb the highest hill, just to have you near me

I'd wait a million years
Walk a million miles, cry a million tears
I'd swim the deepest sea
Climb the highest hill, just to have you near me
