[Verse 1]
This is my life
It's not what it was before
All these feelings I've shared
And these are my dreams
That I'd never lived before

Somebody shake me, 'cause I
I must be sleeping

[Chorus]
Now that we're here, it's so far away
All the struggle we thought was in vain
And all the mistakes one life contained
They all finally start to go away
And now that we're here, it's so far away
And I feel like I can face the day
And I can forgive, and I'm not ashamed
To be the person that I am today

[Verse 2]
And these are my words
That I've never said before
I think I'm doing okay
And this is the smile
That I've never shown before

Somebody shake me 'cause I
I must be sleeping

[Chorus]
[Bridge]
I'm so afraid of waking
Please don't shake me
Afraid of waking
Please don't shake me

[Chorus]
Now that we're here, it's so far away
All the struggle we thought was in vain
All the mistakes one life contained
They all finally start to go away
And now that we're here, it's so far away
And I feel like I can face the day
I can forgive, and I'm not ashamed
To be the person that I am today
