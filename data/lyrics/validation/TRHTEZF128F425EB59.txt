When you were a young girl, did you have a rag doll?
The only doll you've ever owned
Now I'll love you just the way you loved that rag doll
Only now my love has grown
It gets stronger as the river flows
Deeper baby, heaven knows
Higher as it goes
Do I love you? My, oh, my
River deep, mountain high, yeah, yeah, yeah
Do I love you, would I cry?
Oh, I love you baby, baby, baby, baby
When you were a young girl, did you have a puppy?
That always followed you around
Well, I'm gonna be as faithful as that puppy
No, I'll never never let you down
'Cause it gets stronger as the river flows
And it gets deeper baby, heaven knows
It gets higher so higher as it goes
Do I love you? My, oh, my
River deep, mountain high, yeah, yeah, yeah
Do I love you, would I cry?
Oh, I love you baby, baby, baby, baby
Well, I love you baby like a flower loves a spring
And I love you baby like a robin likes to sing
And I love you baby like a schoolboy likes his pie
Oh, and I love you baby, river deep, mountain high
Do I love you? My, oh, my
River deep, mountain high, yeah, yeah, yeah
Do I love you, would I cry?
Oh, I love you baby, baby, baby, baby
Do I love you? My, oh, my
River deep, mountain high, yeah, yeah, yeah
Do I love you, would I cry?
Oh, I love you baby, baby, baby, baby
