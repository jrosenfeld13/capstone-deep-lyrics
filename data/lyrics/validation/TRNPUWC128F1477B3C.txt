It started long ago, you have to understand
We thought we'd make a life, we thought we had a plan
We built it like a house and filled it up with kids
The only trouble is
I won't be back again

Cause something in my heart has taken to the wind
And nothing I can do will bring it back again
Nobody ever wins the war in the gulf between us
Something in my heart no longer could survive
Those battles in the day, the quiet in the night
I lost the will to fight the war in the gulf between us

And then it all began, the quarrels and the moods
I tip-toed all around you; you danced around me too
And somewhere in between we found the time for love
The only trouble is
It never was enough

Cause something in my heart has taken to the wind
And nothing I can do will bring it back again
Nobody ever wins the war in the gulf between us
Something in my heart no longer could survive
Those battles in the day, the quiet in the night
I lost the will to fight the war in the gulf between us

What was the sense in keeping alive
Something that never made us satisfied
Sometimes it's better to get on with your life
I don't believe in hurting each other all the time

Now after all the lawyers have eaten our remains
And after all the nights have swallowed up the pain
Then maybe we will meet, we'll find a neutral place
The only trouble is
What will we have to say?

Well something in our hearts will have to try and give
And something in our hearts will have to learn to live
Together and apart without another war between us
