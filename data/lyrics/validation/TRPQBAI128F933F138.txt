I'm always looking for some new situations
That's why I got a lot of crazy complications
I try, I try, try to be quiet
But I can't see, I can't see, I can't see the light

I'm just reading 'bout weapons, crime and war
Someone's bashing the kid next door
Who tries to turn us upside down
Complications all around

Playing for you - is all we can do
We all got to keep our heads in tune
Playing for you - is all we can do
We could even make it to the moon
