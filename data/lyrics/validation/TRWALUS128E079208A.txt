[Verse 1: Lajon Witherspoon]
Voices call
They call out my name, my name, my name
They say I'm different
Well, I'm not the same, the same
You say you want to
Ah, be like me
Well, boy let me tell you...
You don't know what I've seen!
They say a devil lives in my soul
I promise not to let him take control!

[Chorus 1: Lajon Witherspoon]
I'm mindin' my own business!
I ain't doin' nothin' wrong!
I ain't doin' nothin' wrong!

[Verse 2: Lajon Witherspoon]
Shadows follow
So close behind me
I look in the mirror...
I don't like what I see!
Whoa, God, can't you help me
Get outta here, here?
I feel like I'm living
Deep in Hell!

[Chorus 2: Lajon Witherspoon]
I'm mindin' my own business!
I ain't doin' nothin' wrong!

[Guitar Solo: Clint Lowery]

[Chorus 2: Lajon Witherspoon]
I'm mindin' my own business!
I ain't doin' nothin' wrong!

[Outro: Lajon Witherspoon]
Oh, what's that now?
I, I'm mindin', I'm mindin' my own, own!
I ain't doing nothing wrong!
I ain't doin' nothin' wrong!
Nothing wrong!
