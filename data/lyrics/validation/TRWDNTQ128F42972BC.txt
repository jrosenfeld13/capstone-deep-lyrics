I'm thinking that it's time to get out
My patients are fading fast
The mind bruises just a little bit easier
In dark times and shadow's cast

What are you suffering for?
Your pride or some kind of personal war?
And will you throw it away
For nothing more than a simple taste?

I stay in time and watch you pass by
(Paranoia woven deep beneath my skin)
I draw this line and hope you'll take my side
(Breathe slow, breathe slow)
You shouldn't have to fight alone
(You shouldn't have to fight at all)
It's nobody's battle but your own

Panic holds me like a gun
Firm and steadfast bleak and cold
I think it's time to kill the drama
This lifestyle's getting old

Whispers from behind closed doors
Eyes spy from dark windows
Plotting minds that seek to harm me
Or maybe not, I don't really know

There is something waiting for me
In the darkest part of my imagination

I stay in time and watch you pass by
(Paranoia woven deep beneath my skin)
I draw this line and hope you'll take my side
(Breathe slow, breathe slow)
You shouldn't have to fight alone
(You shouldn't have to fight at all)
It's nobody's battle but your own

This is just self-induced terror
There's more to come, this is just a glimpse
I tell myself it's all in my head
But I'm pretty hard to convince

Oh, there's no relief
Oh, this world can offer
Oh, there's no relief
Oh, this world can offer me

I stay in time and watch you pass by
I draw this line and hope you'll take my side
You shouldn't have to fight alone
It's nobody's battle but your own
