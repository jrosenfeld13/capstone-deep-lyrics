The lights are on
I want to take you home
The nights we shared
Was I the only one?
I cannot lie
My fear of you is strong
I don't love you
I want to take you home
I don't love you
I want to take you home
I want to take you home
Yeah
Tell me truth, I don't want no lies
When I'm with you, I'm hypnotized
Looking for trouble, that's what I am
Playing a game we both understand
The nights are long
I want to take you home
I thought of you
You're not the only one
You touch my hand
Like no other can
I don't love you
I want to take you home
Tell me truth, I don't want no lies
When I'm with you, I'm hypnotized
Looking for trouble, that's what I am
Playing a game we both understand
Will you be here in a week or two?
I won't be waiting but I'll miss you
Taking it slow, ging day by day
Boy, you're fine but you're all the same
I don't love you
I want to take you home
I don't love you
I want to take you home
I don't love you
I want to take you home
Yeah
I want to take you home...
