If I were a tailor
I could make you a tie
If I were a baker
I might bake those things you like
And I wouldn't mind
Taking my time

If I were your paper
You could read me like a book
If I was your pen
You could hold me in your hand
And I wouldn't mind
You taking your time drawing the straight lines

If I were a snowplow
I could plow a path to you
If I were the snowflake
I would fall right next to you
And if I were your wood stove
I could keep you warm at night
Yeah, if I were the fire
I could keep you warm all night
And I wouldn't mind taking my time
No, I wouldn't mind taking my time
For you
