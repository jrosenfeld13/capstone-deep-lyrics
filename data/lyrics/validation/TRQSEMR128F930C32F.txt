Gino loves you, this I know
'Cause the bible tells me so
Little ones to him belong
They are weak and he is strong

Do you love me, do I know
Have you ever told me so
Gino loves to hear you say
That you love him every day

Gino loves you, he's alive
Jesus is the one who died
Heaven's gate is open wide
Everyone can come inside

Gino loves you
Gino loves you
Gino loves you
The bible tells me so
