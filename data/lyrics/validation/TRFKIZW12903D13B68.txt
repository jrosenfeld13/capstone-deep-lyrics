Now that I have packed my things
And we have gone our separate ways
Darlin', are you thinking how it might have been
Are you sorry I didn't stay
Do you love me now
Do you love me now
Tell me, girl
Do you love me now
Do you love me now
Do you love me now
Tell me, girl
Do you love me now
And now that I have found somebody new
Are you sorry our ways did part
Do you sit at home and cry again
Do you have a broken heart
Do you love me now
Do you love me now
Tell me, girl
Do you love me now
Do you love me now
Do you love me now
Tell me, girl
Do you love me now
Do you love me now
Do you love me now
Tell me, girl
Do you love me now
Do you love me now
Do you love me now
Tell me, girl
Do you love me now
Tell me, girl
Do you love me no&119
