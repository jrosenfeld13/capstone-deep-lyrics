Aquarius was born the night
The shining stars, needed brighter shining light
Aquarius was my savior
It came along like a blast from out of sight
When I was weak you came along
Enlightened me, covered the sun
You seduced me, I can never ever run
'Cause I can only lose
When I'm Aquarius
You're the power that I need
To make it all succeed, can hear me call?
Aquarius is the stardust
It kills the faith and the only one I trust
It calls your name and you listen
It steals your soul and your hunger and your lust
For life and being free
(It's killing me, it's killing me)
It's dragging you, it's killing me
(It's killing me, it's killing me)
You seduced me, I can never ever run
'Cause I can only lose
When I'm Aquarius
You're the power that I need
To make it all succeed, can you hear me call?
Can you hear me call?
I wish the stars would turn you in
And leave me standing in the wind
I wish the devil gave you up
And all the snow would melt and stop
This is it, I can't run away
You're controlling my life
And I can hear me say
'Cause I can only lose
When I'm Aquarius
Your the power that I need
To make it all succeed
I wish the stars would turn you in
And leave me standing in the wind
I wish the devil gave you up
And all the snow would melt and stop
