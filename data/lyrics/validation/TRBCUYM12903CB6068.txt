Don't want no darkness in my days, I want to tell you that
Don't want no clouds to fill my skies, no more goodbyes
I know that this time you have come to me, and run in on me
Good love is running in on me
Don't try to dim my eyes, don't ever try to live my life

Welcome to the cruise
Welcome to the cruise, cruise
Love come down and run in on me
Love come down and run in on me

No words from me will change your ways, I want to tell you that
Nothing that I see will change your days, nothing will change
'Cause I know this time you have come to me, come to run with me
I know that you will run with me
Don't try to take my time, don't question what is on my mind

Welcome to the cruise
Welcome to the cruise, cruise
Come on down and run in with me
Come on down and run in with me

Don't want no darkness in my days, I've got to tell you that
Don't want no clouds to fill my skies
Don't want the earth, no crooked lies, don't want the night
No more goodbyes
