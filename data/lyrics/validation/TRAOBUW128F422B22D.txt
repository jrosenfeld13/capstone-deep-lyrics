So much further than you know
Through a world of ice
I have carved my way to you
Pushed and pulled by these lies
These lies
These lies

So much further than you know
Through a world of ice
I have carved my way to you
Pushed and pulled by these lies
These lies
These lies

Only to stay closer now
Come and lick my wounds
Drink these tears I saved for you
Perished like a Grim's appeased
But I'm so scared inside
See the hangman missing one more line

Through this world of ice
I call your name again 'cause I'm here without you
I'm here without you
Distance to decide from which I cherish you
Out of fear
Out of fear
Out of fear

Can you tell what's right from wrong
Would the trouble end
Meld the masses in return
Light the beacon just for me, so I might find you there
Send the senseless signal out of here

Through this world of ice
I call your name again 'cause I'm here without you
I'm here without you
Distance to decide from which I cherish you
Out of fear
Out of fear

Through this world of ice
I call your name again 'cause I'm here without you
I'm here without you
Distance to decide from which I cherish you
Out of fear
Out of fear...
