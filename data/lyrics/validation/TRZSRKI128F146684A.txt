[Verse 1]
Bought a Cub Scout manual
Found my favourite chapter
Turning up the stereo
It's time for fun with ropes
Learned our knots from A to Z
Stole my daddy's belts
We'll make our own fun for free
Having fun with ropes

[Hook]
You tell me that I'm sick (you're sick)
As you strap me to the floor
You know it makes my heart quick
I'll come crawling back for more

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm collecting coloured cord
No macram for me
Dim the lights and lock the door
And never set me free
You say that I'm not healthy
You think that I'm a creep
Still you tie your knots so tight
I'm too wrapped up to sleep

[Hook]
You tell me that I'm sick (you're sick)
As you strap me to the floor
You know it makes my heart quick
I'll come crawling back for more
And more and more forevermore, yeah!

[Verse 3]
Well, I'm collecting coloured cord
No macram for me
Dim the lights and lock the door
And never set me free
You say that I'm not healthy
You think that I'm a creep
Still you tie your knots so tight
I'm too wrapped up to sleep

[Hook]
You tell me that I'm sick (you're sick)
As you strap me to the floor
You know it makes my heart quick
I'll come crawling back for more
And more
