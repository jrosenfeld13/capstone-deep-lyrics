She's a small town girl with no room to grow
And he's a reckless boy with no where to go
They're like birds in a cage with no place to fly
So he parks the car and she holds him tight

And they rage on some how searching for the answers
In the night like shadow dancers before their time is gone
They rage on

On the same dark night two more people meet
In a rented room on a cross town street
And she's lost her youth and he's lost his dreams
But for a while they feel like they used to feel

And they rage on
Against the lives that this world gave them
Hoping something's there to save them
They rage on rage on

And somewhere between right and wrong
In the grey between dusk and dawn
They tell themselves they're not alone
Cause they rage on

And they rage on some how searching for the answers
In the night like shadow dancers before their time is gone
They rage on

They rage on against the lives that this life gave them
Hoping something's there to save them
They rage on they rage on
