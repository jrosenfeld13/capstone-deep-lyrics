Here's a story of lovers finding
Union so deep there is no unwinding
Tender threads exquisitely finding
Two lives together one soul deep resounding
Love so strong, whatever the weather
Even apart our souls are together
It's you and me Babe, forever and ever
Even apart we're dreaming together
One, one
One, one
Suddenly all time and space
Loses it's meaning when I see your face
And I'm wrapped up in Heaven's grace
Feelin' so safe in your sweet embrace
One, one
One, one
One, one
One, one
