If we meet by chance today, pretend that you don't see me
I love you, but if she knew I know she'd never free me
Long as I am tied to her we care not for the danger
So be discreet and meet me later, daylight stranger
She believes that I go out on real important business
(Daylight stranger)
She's so right 'cause every night I taste your tender kisses
(Daylight stranger)
That's what happens when a home is filled with pain and anger
(Daylight stranger)
So be discreet and meet me later, daylight stranger
For a while just be my lover
With the darkness as our cover
So that she may not discover you
Soon enough she'll realize that we were both mistaken
(Daylight stranger)
Walk and talk 'cause in my hand, one day I'll soon awaken
(Daylight stranger)
Turn the sunlight in your eyes without the thrill of danger
(Daylight stranger)
So be discreet and meet me later, daylight stranger
Meet me later, daylight stranger
Meet me later, daylight stranger
Meet me later, daylight stranger
