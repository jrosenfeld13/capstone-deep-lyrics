I saw the longing in your eyes
But I failed to see the anguish you so cleverly disguised
Your needs I clearly read
But I never knew your true intentions they were better left unsaid
I brushed our tears aside
Thought I could wipe away the memory
But couldn't push that far inside
You came so full of regrets
Your body still remembers
What your mind learnt to forget
Love is lost I've found
When trust breaks down
Now we meet those two imposters just the same
Always out of bounds
When love comes round
Don't even have the strength to share the blame
We ride the train of events
We never make our destination never making any sense
You say you leave without regret
But your body will remember what your mind learns to forget
One love, two solitudes
There's no common ground
When trust breaks down
Thought everybody's love is in the air
Always out of bounds
When love comes down
Too scared to climb the wall of our despair
Love is lust I've found
When trust breaks down
Now we meet those two imposters just the same
Always out of bounds
When love comes round
Don't even have the strength to share the blame
And the said thing is
There's no end to this
Your tears are like the rain that beats the rain
And I wake at dawn
To find you gone
Don't even have strength to call you name
Repeat chorus 2
Repeat corus 1
