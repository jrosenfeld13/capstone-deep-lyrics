Some are like snow
Bright white and momentarily
Muffling
The sounds of the city
Some are a haven
Surprisingly filled with treacherous reefs
And some are
Like dew
Brand new
Some they are airy
Like clouds in the sky
Some like the bittersweet
Drop in your eye
Right now
You are sunshine waters
A surface glittering
A mirror reflecting
Making everything
Look brighter
Some are a pond
Down below
In their murky deep
Some kind of beast
Are waiting to surface
Some are a dead, calm, sea
Motionless water all around
Surrounds you
With nothing to drink
A surface glittering
A mirror reflecting
Making everything
Look  bright
Some they are airy
Like clouds in the sky
Some like the bittersweet
Drop in your eye
Right now
You are sunshine waters
Like fountain heads
On which you rely
Or wild babbling brooks
That sometimes run dry
Right now
You are sunshine waters
