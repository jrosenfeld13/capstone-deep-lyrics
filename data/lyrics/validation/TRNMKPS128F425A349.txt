Time came around, and I was in need
You came by my side, all my troubles to ease
You collected my heart, healing the past
You'll never lay down and i can count on you

We all speak well of a bridge that carries us over
...over safe
The art of compromise has surely been our greatest strength
...our greatest strength

When someone pretends, to circle your friends
And finds he's betraying you 'fore it all ends
A bittersweet chain, that'll always remain
So don't let illusions get the better of you

We all speak well of a bridge that carries us over
...over safe
The art of compromise has surely been our greatest strength
...our greatest strength.Love is to share, where words can't compare
Love is desire, so full of fire

We all speak well of a bridge that carries us over
...over safe
The art of compromise has surely been our greatest strength
...our greatest strength

We all speak well of a bridge that carries us over
...over safe
The art of compromise has surely been our greatest strength
...our greatest strength
