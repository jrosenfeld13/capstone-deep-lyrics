Pale impressions of a solid form
Taken on a shape that's trite and worn
Go ask why
As i get mine

Found a way to make the numbers count
Binaries they stand in line for me so i
Won't be the same
Due to proclaim

I know i saw the signs
I get enough, i get enough, i get enough
Of what's been counted on, been counted on
Throughout the ages
I see with more than just my eyes
I didn't know that i was able to become like this
Can i say - you just did

Twist and squeeze the numbers out of every
Mo-meant to be true, at least for you
My mind's (to the greater) inclined
Still, I GET NO ASCENSION

Now the trick is to make the numbers add up
Even if they don't, i will tell you how
This accolade of logic gotta stop
If you pray the numbers will add up

OOH OAH is it because i said - AAH
Didn't they tell me to, to go on ?
I'm the one keeping pseudomathematics alive
OOH OAH is because i always said all the things that i did
In all the ways that did it/them ?

Oh, i got to
All of the time: #
All of the time: #
All of the time: #
Can you please just

Ask the boy about the logicalculated paradigm
He's born to find
Too kind to be facing his time
It takes a little bit more spine
To sum it up, to eat all
The pieces of the pi
Will i rise, will i fall ?
Dawning straight, unfortunate lie
Oh, i've got the algorythm to my heart

I know i saw the signs
I get enough, i get enough, i get enough
Of what's been counted on, been counted on
Throughout the ages
I see with more than just my eyes
And now i know the very reason i became like this
Can i say - yeah you did

OOH OAH is it because i said - AAH
Didn't they tell me to, to go on ?
I am so apophenic i am wasting a life
OOH OAH is because i always said all the things that i did
In all the ways that did it/them ?

Oh, i got to
All of the time: #
All of the time: #
All of the time: #
Can you please just
