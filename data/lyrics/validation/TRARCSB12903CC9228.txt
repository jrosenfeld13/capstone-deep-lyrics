Two strangers sharing eyes
A look that you recognize
Like a diamond in the sky
Like a shadow in the night

You say you say you wanna runaway
Like a dog wrapped up in chains
Like a midnight masquerade
A feeling that you cant explain

Runnaway lets runaway
Runnaway we gotta runaway

Come on baby lets runaway
Leave the world behind us
Cut our hair and change our names
And nobody will find us

I see the future in your eyes
Like a truth wrapped up lies
Like a devil in disguise
I see the darkness in your light

Runnaway lets runaway
Runnaway we gotta runaway

Come on baby lets runaway
Leave the world behind us
Cut our hair and change our names
And nobody will find us

Runnaway-way-runnaway-way-runnaway-way-runnaway
Runaway
We gotta runaway

Come on baby lets runaway
Leave the world behind us
Cut our hair and change our names
And nobody will find us

Come on baby lets try it
We got no reason to fight it
And you know that you need it
We can keep it a secret
