[Verse 1]
Re-ignition, translation begin
Cosmopolitan reflection well thin
When our action cause reaction what starts
A transmission of a love in one heart

[Chorus]
Re-ig-ni-tion
Re-ig-ni-tion

[Post-Chorus]
I came down to make you overstand
That this gross sphere is not Jah land
Apart-outside, who can escape
Our destiny, confirmed in fate

[Verse 2]
Re-igniton, cancellation can't win
No celesty ever resting begin
When grace melts inside your hand and my heart
Is the glory that much closer or apart

[Chorus]
Re-ig-ni-tion
Re-ig-ni-tion

[Post-Chorus]
We hope to make you overstand
That this gross sphere is not Jah land
Apart-outside who can escape
Our destiny confirmed in fate

[Verse 3]
Always and forever, near or far
Safe in your bosom here we are
Pain does not mean feel no joy
Re-ignition for girl and for boy

[Chorus]
Re-ig-ni-tion
Re-ig-ni-tion
Re-ig-ni-tion
Re-ig-ni-tion

[Post-Chorus]
We love to make you overstand
That this gross sphere is not Jah land
Apart-outside who can escape
Millennium confirmed in fate
