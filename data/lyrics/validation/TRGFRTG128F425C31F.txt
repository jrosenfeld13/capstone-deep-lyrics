[Verse 1]
Turning towards a time so free
Justice has finally escaped
The dripping words of yesterday
Set my feeble mind astray

[Verse 2]
I yearn to see
The glow of her eyes as I appear
A sign of satisfaction
Could be the sweetest sound
The staircase has one too many steps
I've already started back down
Come on

[Verse 3]
I love the caterpillars
Munching on the leaves
Pitter patter
Makes me forget my disease
Bugs have feelers just like me
And I'm feeling oh so lonely

[Verse 4]
Disturbed in every sense of grace
The lady wouldn't give me a taste
Of the joy that means that much
It lives within her touch

[Chorus]
Why won't you be my friend
I would love to hold you tonight
Even if we just pretend
Why won't you be my friend
Why

[Chorus]
Why won't you be my friend
I would love to hold you tonight
Even if we just pretend
Why won't you be my friend
Be my friend

[Verse 5]
I'd love to meet the one
Who broke my heart
I know she'd melt me with her dance
Her subtle colors, her sweet smile
But it's a shame
She'll never get that chance
