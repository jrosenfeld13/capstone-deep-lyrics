[Verse 1]
When I'm out and about
Skipping 'round the city
Up and down, without a doubt
I'm okay with me
But when I'm home all alone
With only the phone
And all the crap I've accrued
What can I, what can I, what can I do?

[Chorus]
Mama, Mama, I wanted to please you
Mama, Mama, I wanted to please
Dadda, dadda, I wanted to be better, better
I wanted to be Mama
I wanted to be you

[Verse 2]
When I'm out in the car
With the wind in my hair
Spinning wheels, it really feels
Like I'm going somewhere
But when I'm home all alone
With only the phone
Eating crap, in the nude
What can I, what can I, what can I do?

[Chorus]
Mama, Mama, I wanted to please you
Mama, Mama, I wanted to please
Dadda, dadda, I wanted to be better, better
I wanted to be Mama
I wanted to be you

I wanted to be you, da da da da da da da da da da
(Ah ah ah ah ah)
I wanted to be you, da da da da da da da da da da
(Ah ah ah ah ah)
I wanted to be you, da da da da da da da da da da

[Chorus]
Mama, Mama, I wanted to please you
(Whoo)
Mama, Mama, I wanted to please
Dadda, dadda, I wanted to be better, better
I wanted to be Mama
I wanted to be you
I wanted to be you, Dad
I wanted to be you, Dad
I wanted to be you, Dad
You.....
