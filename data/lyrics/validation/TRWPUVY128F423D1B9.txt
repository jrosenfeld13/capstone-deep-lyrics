No medicine for this malady
No snake oil, no gris gris
Theres no magic potion, no afterglow
No backstage exit
To some secret show

And Im screaming at these four walls
Shivering from the thought

That I just cant shake it baby
Because the words intoxicate me
I wont surrender from this state Im in
Held guilty of magnificent sin
Because I just cant shake it baby

No sanctuary, no antidote
No saving grace, no Holy Ghost
Theres no diamond powder, no parlour trick
No bloodletting, this one cuts to the quick

And Im screaming at these four walls
Shivering from it all

And I just cant shake it baby
Because the words intoxicate me
I wont surrender from this state Im in
Held guilty of magnificent sin

No I just wont let it freeze beneath my fingertips
No I just wont let it disappear inside of my head
Im drowning in these words nobodys ever heard
Sinking so fast, Im never coming back

And I just cant shake it baby
Cause theres no cure today

No I just wont let it freeze beneath my fingertips
No I just wont let it disappear inside of my head
Im drowning in these words nobodys ever heard
Gathering clouds, Im never coming down

But I could be good, if you just let me
This big white light shining down
On me
