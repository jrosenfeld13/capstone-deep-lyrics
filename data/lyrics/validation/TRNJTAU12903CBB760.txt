What is there to say
When all the love has slipped away
In half a minute

There is always something we can blame
But in the end, it's just the same -
Suddenly, you find yourself alone

Half a minute
Half a minute

Half a minute
Half a minute

What is there to say
When every dream just fades away
In half a minute

Every explanation we can find
Will never change it, we are through -
Suddenly, you find yourself alone

Half a minute
Half a minute

Half a minute
Half a minute

Half a minute
Half a minute
