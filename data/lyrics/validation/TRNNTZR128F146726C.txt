Far,far from the light
Hear the night creatures call
With the cold breath they howl
All the hollow hours they're calling you
I'll be there
No matter what you're going through
In the dark I care
I'm holding on,I'm hoping on
It's still the same old me inside

Back to the light
Back to the streets that are paved with gold
Back to the light
Back to the land where the sunshine heals my soul

Deep,deep in the night
When the world fills with tears
And the wind blows,colder and colder it grows
And the fire dims with the same old fears
I'll be there
Though maybe you don't hear me babe
I still care
No matter when I'll still be there
When you make it to the other side

I'm going back - Back to the light
Back to the light
Back to the streets that are paved with gold
Back to the light
Going back to the land where the sunshine heals my soul - yeah

On and on
Searching for a clearer view
Winning and losing an inner war
Wonder what we do it for
Though the road seems never ending
Hold on to the hope I'm sending through - yeah

No matter where you're going to
In the dark I care
I'm holding on - believe it
We'll be walking in the light
Because there'll be no place left to hide

Back to the light
Back to the streets that are paved with gold
Back to the light -yeah
I'm going back to the land where the sunshine heals my soul
I hear you babe

Back to the light (back to the light)
Back to the light (back to the light)
Back to the light
Back to the light - yeah
Coming back with me

Yeah yeah
