Nobody's hungry, everyone is well to do
And we lack motivation
If the truth can set you free
Then how can we keep dying for you?
In a distant land of different ways
Our only connection is
A television in the living room
And the anchor is only putting you to bed
With filler in your head delivering a trivial story
Instead of giving you what might be
Trouble for the CEO (GOP)

They're only putting you to bed

Don't understand why they want to hurt you
You only know about your country's virtue
You've never heard about a term called blowback
It's the result of a central intelligent attack

I want to know what makes you wake up
Wake up!
