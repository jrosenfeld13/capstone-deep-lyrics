You cried us an ocean of tears
Tried to wash me away
How I'd love to hold your face under the flood
And smile from above
While you struggle to breathe

You want what the world wouldn't give
So you drink from my veins
But your tongue has been burned from the taste
And you've learned what I've known:
That you will never be me

Why won't you die?
When I find you I'll take my time
Burn you alive
Piss out the flames when I feel entertained

NO LOVE
So don't cry to me
NO LOVE
No, a stone won't bleed

A fire to burn every liar
And lawyer pig at the stake
Could cure this disease
But still wouldn't buy you a breath of sympathy

Why won't you die?
When I find you I'll take my time
Cannibals and parasites
Why won't you die?
Leeches and vampires, I pray the sun to rise

NO LOVE
So don't cry to me
NO LOVE
No, a stone won't bleed
...now bleed for me

Vultures, crows and flies
I beg you leave my eyes so I can watch you die

NO LOVE
So don't cry to me
NO LOVE
No, a stone won't bleed
