Theres trouble in here tonight
In place of your mind
The things that you say and do
Are of a different kind

All your hopes and dreams
Come from a hole in the ground
You say youre black like me
But you dont want me around

Youve got a reason to sit inside
And a hundred million more
You close your eyes
Youre changing colors
