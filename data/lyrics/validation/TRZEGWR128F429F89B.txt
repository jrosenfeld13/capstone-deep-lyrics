No more you choose to sue for peace
Where once for war
The mind ingrained can't hear the call
You have so many friends cheering you along
Don't turn a deaf ear to their song

As your world is turning you're holding on
Give it away, give it away
Holding on to right or wrong won't serve you

We keep on fighting to maintain our father's place
This time line never finds an end in revenge
Here comes an open heart to blow it all away

As your world is burning you're holding on
Give it away, give it away
Holding onto right and wrong won't serve you
Won't serve you
