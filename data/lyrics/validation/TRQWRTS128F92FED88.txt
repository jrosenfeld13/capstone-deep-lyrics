You did not dare say a single word
I did not dare ask for something more
I've kept my questions secret deep inside
But I wish I could have let you know about
A time when I would have said:

Wait, and please stay
Did you mean to push me away?
Please wait and just stay
Did you want it to be this way?

Would you want to know what I've been through?
(Through all this time... all this time)
Would you want to know I have missed you too?
(And I have you on my mind)
And you've been and you will be a part of me
(That I can't That I can't find)
And you've been forgiven for your silence
All this time when I would have said:

Wait, and please stay
Did you mean to push me away?
Please wait and just say
Is there a way that could replace

The times you never said
How've you been?
Do you need anything?
Want you to know I'm here?
Want you to feel me near?

Yeah... And I hope
I hope that you will find your way
Yeah... And I hope
I hope there will be better days

Please wait, and just stay
(Please stay)
Did you mean to push me away?
Please wait, and just stay
(Wait Just stay)
Did you want it to be this way?
Wait, and please say
(Wait Yeah, and I hope)
I hope that you will find your way
Please wait, and just stay
(Wait And I hope)
I hope there will be better days

Wait
Please stay
Just stay
Please wait
