Some times she runs, some times she don't
More than once shes left me on the side of the road
The older she gets the slower we go
But There Ain't Nothin' Wrong With The Radio
She needs a carburetor, a set of plug wires
Shes riding me around on four bald tires
The wipers don't work and the horn don't blow
But There Ain't Nothin' Wrong With The Radio

I got sixteen speakers crossin' my back dash
A little bobbin dog watchin' everybody pass
Dual antennas whippin' in the wind
Lord there ain't no country station that I can't tune in
She ain't a Cadillac and she ain't a Rolls
But There Ain't Nothin' Wrong With The Radio

I got stopped by a cop late last night, out of date tags and no taillights
He said I oughta run you in but im a lettin you go
Because There Ain't Nothin' Wrong With The Radio
Got the best lookin gal in my hometown
I asked her last time that I took her out
Honey tell me what it is that makes you love me so
She said There Ain't Nothin' Wrong With your Radio

No she ain't a Cadillac and she ain't a rolls
But There Ain't Nothin' Wrong With The Radio
