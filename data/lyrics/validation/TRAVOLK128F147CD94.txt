In the morning upside down
In the evening round and round
I'm so tired I've lost my eyes
Could someone prop me up 'gainst a wall?
Got this thing what makes my lids fall
If I bask I'm bound to burn
If I read I'm bound to learn
I'm a thief what stole you twice
Could someone glue these shoes to the ground?
Got this thing what makes me spin round
And round and round and round and round

No, I'll never believe the truth in you
Lies are much more fun
No, I'll never believe the truth in you
Lies are much more fun
No I can't, no I won't
No I can't, no I won't
No I can't, no I won't
Goodbye, goodbye I'm closing my ears

Planting trees like planting leaves
Broken toes and then she leaves
I'm a grave for good intent
This flood's starting to get to me
This blood is well up past my knees
I'm a seal know that by heart
You're unwell how could we part?
Got a goat and got a bear
Little girl got to make up your mind
Little girl think what you've got inside
Inside, inside, inside, inside

No, I'll never believe the truth in you
Lies are much more fun
No, I'll never believe the truth in you
Lies are much more fun
No I can't, no I won't
No I can't, no I won't
No I can't, no I won't
Goodbye, goodbye I'm closing my ears

I'm not listenin', I'm not listenin'
I'm not listening to a word you say
I'm not listenin', I'm not listenin'
I'm not listening to a word you say
I'm not listening, I'm not listening, I'm not listening
(I'm not listening, I'm not listening)
I'm not listening, I'm not listening, I'm not listening
(I'm not listening, I'm not listening)
I'm gonna go like this to you
I'm gonna go like this to you
I'm gonna go like this to you
La, la, la, la, la

I wash with your soap
Oh, I dream of rodeo
Your soap, your soap
Your soap, your

No I can't, no I won't
No I can't, no I won't
No I can't, no I won't
No I can't, no I won't
No I can't, yes I can
No I can't, yes I can
No I can't, yes I can
No I can't, yes I can
No I can't, no I won't
No I can't, no I won't
No I can't, no I won't
Goodbye, goodbye I'm closing my ears
