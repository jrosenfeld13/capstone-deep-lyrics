In the land of salvation
Is where you find this masterpiece
Of a right-wing kidney punch
Escape convict pool
Escape

Executions are nearly flawless
So riding forever
In the deep
Or taking it into the shallow
Is not a problem

Escape convict pool
Escape
Convict pool
Escape

Check the underwriter killers
For video surveillance
Of the convict pool
In the warden son's
Private collection

Escape convict pool
Escape
Social fool
We evade

I forget to mention
That the coping of this baby's like butter
So stand up and grind far

Escape convict pool
Escape
Parental fools
We evade

Tony and George
Avoid the nipple
Protusion on the wall
With a backside hurricane
Over the death box
We fall

And escape
Convict pool
Escape
Social tool
Evade
Courtroom duel
