I thought I had seen pretty girls in my time but that was before I met you
I never saw one that I wanted for mine but that was before I met you
I thought I was swinging the world by the tail I thought I could never be blue
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved but that was before I met you

I wanted to ramble and always be free but that was before I met you
I said that no woman could ever hold me but that was before I met you
I thought I was swinging...

They tell me I must reap just what I have sown but darling I hope it's not true
For once I made plans about living alone but that was before I met you
I thought I was swinging...
But that was before I met you
