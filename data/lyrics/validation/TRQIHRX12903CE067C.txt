Br.. Br.. Br.. Breaking up
Tired of this feeling that my hands are cuffed
When I'm around you
Over love
Let's take it to the road
Because I've had enough
Wish I never met you

I'm stuck, your stuck
Mission impossible, mission impossible
It's what we got

I could turn you loose, baby what's the use
Ohhh oh, ohhh oh
I come back to you like automatik
I can run so far, but a star's a star
Ohhh oh, ohhh oh
I come back to you like automatik

Automatik [x5]
I come back to you like automatik
Automatik [x5]
I come back to you like automatik

I'm loosing hope
You're bound around my heart just like a body rope
Too tight to cut through
Under my skin
I'm sick of fighting battles I can never win
So let's play again, play again

I'm stuck, your stuck
Mission impossible, mission impossible

It's what we got

I could turn you loose, baby what's the use
Ohhh oh, ohhh oh
I come back to you like automatik
I can run so far, but a star's a star
Ohhh oh, ohhh oh
I come back to you like automatik

Automatik [x5]
I come back to you like automatik
Automatik [x5]
I come back to you like automatik

Pull on me like, like a magnet
I come back like automatik
Pull on me like, like a magnet
I come back like automatik

I could turn you loose, baby what's the use
Ohhh oh, ohhh oh
I come back to you like automatik
I can run so far, but a star's a star
Ohhh oh, ohhh oh
I come back to you like automatik

Automatik [x5]
I come back to you like automatik
Automatik [x5]
I come back to you like automatik
