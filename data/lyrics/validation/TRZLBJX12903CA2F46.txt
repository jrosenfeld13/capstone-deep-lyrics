[Chorus]
We are havin' a hootenanny now
We are havin' a hootenanny now
Do-si-do down to our hoedown
Our rootin'-tootin' hootenanny
Havin' a hootenanny now

[Verse 1]
Come and take our personality quiz
Come and take our personality quiz
Get the lowdown on our hoedown
We'll tell you where it is
If'n you take our personality quiz

[Verse 2]
There'll be somebody there who understands
There'll be somebody there who understands
They won't eat you, they will greet you
And gaze into your eyes and
There'll be somebody there who understands

[Chorus]
We are havin' a hootenanny now
We are havin' a hootenanny now
Do-si-do down to our hoedown
Our rootin'-tootin' hootenanny
Havin' a hootenanny now
