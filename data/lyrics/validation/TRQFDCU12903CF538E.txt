All the birds on earth take flight
Gather every child in sight
Take the day, embrace it well
Summon the angels

Silent as the coolest night
Floating on the oceans' tide
This could eternal life
Summon the angels

Summon the angels
Summon the angels

I have a secret
I'd like to share with you tonight
Come here
Out of the darkness
I walk into a pool of light
I feel no fear

A hand reached out and touched me
And everything above me
Was all so clear
I saw a thousand doves
Do you believe in love

(Chorus:)
A stream of white vibrating light
Summon the angels
Free to roam the earth
Through the sun, the sand, the surf
Summon the angels

If you believe me
I'll share with you the golden songs
I hear
A new beginning
A time of love for everyone
The way is clear

So close your eyes
Come with me
Through colours that surround me
A silent breeze
Will bring a thousand doves
Do you believe in love

(Chorus)
All the birds on earth take flight
Gather every child in sight
Take the day, embrace it well
Summon the angels

Silent as the coolest night
Floating on the oceans' tide
This could eternal life
Summon the angels

I saw a thousand doves
Do you believe in love

(Chorus)
All the birds on earth take flight
Gather every child in sight
Take the day, embrace it well
Summon the angels

Silent as the coolest night
Floating on the oceans' tide
This could eternal life
Summon the angels
