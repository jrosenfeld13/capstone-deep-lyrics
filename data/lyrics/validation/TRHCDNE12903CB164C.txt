Can I scream?
We lack the motion to move to the new beat!
We lack the motion to move to the new beat

It's here for us to admire if we can afford the beauty of it
If we can afford the luxury of turning our heads, if we tried
Adjust that thousand-dollar smile and behold the creation of man
Great words won't cover ugly actions
Good frames won't save bad paintings!

(Whoo!)

We lack the motion to move to the new beat
Yeah!
We lack... motion

When the day is over the doors are locked on us
'Cause money buys the access and we can't pay the cost
How can we expect anyone to listen
If we are using the same old voice?
We need new noise
New art for the real people!

We dance to all the wrong songs
We enjoy all the wrong moves
We dance to all the wrong songs
We're not leading
We dance to all the wrong songs
We enjoy all the wrong moves
We dance to all the wrong songs
We're not, we're not, we're not, we're not, we're not
We're not...
Leading

We're not leading!

We dance all the wrong songs
We enjoy all the wrong moves
We dance all the wrong songs
We dance all the wrong songs
We enjoy all the wrong moves
We dance all the wrong songs

Here we go!

We dance to all the wrong songs
We enjoy all the wrong moves
We dance to all the wrong songs
We're not leading. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

The new beat! The new beat! The new beat! The new beat!
The new beat! The new beat! The new beat! The new beat!
The new beat! The new beat! The new beat! The new beat!
The new beat! The new beat! The new beat! The new beat!
"Thank you."
