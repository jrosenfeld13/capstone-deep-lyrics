She's cold as ice
She burns like fire
Many faces
Oh, but one desire
She leads you in
As you admire
Oh, her many graces
She's a silent liar

Angel of light
Is how she comes to me
Dark as the night
Her heart of ebony

Lies
Her evil plan unfolds
Lies
A wickedness I'm told
Lies
Is challenging my soul
Lies

The web she weaves
Is so receptive
But beauty fleeting
Oh, and charm's deceptive
She leads you in
To the fire
To fan the flames
Of her desire

Lies
The illusion seemed so real
Lies
Reality concealed
Lies
It all will be revealed
Lies

Dark as the night
