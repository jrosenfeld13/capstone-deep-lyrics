[Verse 1]
Ooh baby, feelin' so good;
Don't you ruin it tonight, tonight
It's been so long since I don't know when
Ooh treat me, treat me, treat me right

Don't be like sheep and follow the flock
Show me you're really mine, you're mine

[Chorus]
Come on, come on
Well, I know you can do it
Come on, come on
Well, there ain't nothin' to it

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Well I know you believe me
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
You can see the real me

[Verse 2]
Ooh I heard a voice in my ear
You were so lonely but now you're here
It's been so long since I don't know when
Come on, come on, do it again

Don't ever lose me 'cause you're the one
Show me you're really mine, you're mine

[Chorus]
Come on, come on
Well, I know you can do it
Come on, come on
Well, there ain't nothin' to it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Well I know you believe me
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
You can see the real me

[Verse 3]
Ooh baby, feelin' so good
Don't you ruin it tonight, tonight
It's been so long since I don't know when
Ooh treat me, treat me, treat me right

Don't ever lose me 'cause you're the one
Show me you really want to be mine
[Chorus]
Come on, come on
Well, I know you can do it
Come on, come on
Well, there ain't nothin' to it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Well I know you believe me
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
You can see the real me

[Outro]
Every day, every day
I need you
Want you to come a little closer
To my face
My girl I need you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Ooh ooh
Come on come on
Come on come on
