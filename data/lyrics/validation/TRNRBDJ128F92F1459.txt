Went to a party just last night
Knew it was wrong, but it felt so right
She was standing there with her short skirt
Looked up at me and started to flirt
We began to talk, I had nothing to say
I still hoped that things would go my way
I knew I had not time to waste
Right then I wondered how she would taste

Took off clothes, hopped into bed
Then I started to wish that I was dead
Tried my hardest to stop a fight
That bitch would not shut up all night

(Chorus:)
I think we made a mistake
But its alright
I didn't like you that much anyway
Who knew that we'd go all day
And all night
But now its over
Now that we're through
There's no more to do

We both woke up about ten A.M
Thought we were through, then we started again
Thinking of good times we just had
Maybe last night was not so bad
But then she started up again
That mindless talk, it had no end
So I got up from the bed
Looked back at her, this is what I said

(Chorus)
No way...
No way...
No way...
No way...

(Chorus)
