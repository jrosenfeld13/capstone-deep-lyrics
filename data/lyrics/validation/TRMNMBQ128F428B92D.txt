Meet down at the parking lot
Before the blacktop gets too hot
I'll wait but I can't wait all day
Rotten egg
Rotten egg
Rotten egg
Rotten egg

Pack is running like a grand champ
Evel Knievel sitting on the ramp
Whole worlds just laid out on a tray
Rotten egg
Rotten egg
Rotten egg
Rotten egg

I got a bike that you can borrow
You know school starts tomorrow
No time for tears of sorrow
Don't waste this one that seems to play
Hey ya ya ya

Meeting down by swimming hole
Before the water gets too damn cold
Can't sit here till I'm old and gray
Rotten egg
Rotten egg
Rotten egg
Rotten egg

I got a bike that you can borrow
You know school starts tomorrow
No time for tears of sorrow
Don't waste this one that seems to play
Hey ya ya ya

Meet me deep in the woods tonight
Don't forget to bring your best flashlight
I'll wait but then I'll have to sleep
