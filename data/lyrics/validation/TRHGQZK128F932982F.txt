When will it stop?
Will I ever get back up?
From that misery that happened to me
Take, take em back
Take these nails out of my head
Because everything inside is crying
I cannot help Im slowly dying

Too deep, it wont get better
Screaming out my lungs forever
Pretty hard to realize my life
Will never be the same
Too deep, it wont get better
Screaming out my lungs forever
Never, never, never be the same

Day in, day out
Nothing ever gets as loud
Can you fall asleep with eyes wide open?
Hey, this is me
Under pressure constantly
I bang my head into a wall on purpose
Tried so hard, I cant control this

Too deep, it wont get better
Screaming out my lungs forever
Pretty hard to realize my life
Will never be the same
Too deep, it wont get better
Screaming out my lungs forever
Never, never, never be the same
Too deep, it wont get better
Screaming out my lungs forever
Pretty hard to realize my life
Will never be the same
Too deep, it wont get better
Screaming out my lungs forever
Never, never, never be the same
