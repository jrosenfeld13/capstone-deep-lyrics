This is going out to anybody

Who might be able to relate to

What I am gonna do

You've had to put up with all the lying

Cheating, back stabbin'

So many years...

And too many tears

But i realised

I didn't have to suffer like this no more

'Cause I'm stronger now

Stronger on my Own!

Yeah, you can't hurt me boy

Nah no, noooo baby

'Cause I'm stronger on my own

You wanna go it alone

Or go lonely

Y'see you let me down so many times before

But right here in my mind

You are the only, the only one i love

But i showed you the door

If you could see me now

And what i was back then

You'd swear i was a different girl

Oh, believe me boy

I had to make a choice

No more would you destroy my world

No more that i can take

Don't need to serve this dish you made

'Cause I'm stronger on my own

I'm stronger on my own

Right now i see

Just where i wanna be

And it's better on my own

I'm stronger on my own

No more that i can take

Don't need to serve this dish you made

'Cause I'm stronger on my own

I'm stronger on my own

'Cause right now i see

Just where i wanna be

'Cause it's better on my own

I'm stronger on my own
