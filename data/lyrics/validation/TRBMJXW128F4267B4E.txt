When I was young supposedly free
I sat around the house of life lonely

I closed my eyes, I couldn't see
Filled my head with make believe

I was fooled by a pretty face
'Til you came along and took your place
And loved me baby

Well, I, I tripped it through
This lonely big old world of ours
'Til I met you

I'm no longer lonely
Don't need to pretend
Oh good, so good, it's good
To be in love gain

I remember when I, I tripped it through
This lonely big old world of ours
'Til I met you

I'm no longer lonely
Don't need to pretend
Oh it feels good, so good, it does
To be in love gain

I'm no longer lonely
Don't need to pretend
Oh it feels good, so good, it does
To be in love gain

Oh it feels good, so good, it does
To be in love gain

Oh it feels good, so good, it does
To be in love gain
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
