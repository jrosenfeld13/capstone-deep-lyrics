[Verse 1]
There was a time everybody was around
And I was dancing with you
We all went down to the party Friday night
And had a drink there or two

Oh, what a heat of a love and heartbeat
That's electricity
Majestic sound, round and round and round
I'm glad you're next to me

[Chorus]
Feel my heartbeat, truly to the beat
Love the symphony
Feel my heartbeat, truly to the beat
Love the melody, come see

Feel my heartbeat, truly to the beat
Love the symphony
Feel my heartbeat, truly to the beat
Love the melody, come see

[Verse 2]
Time after time, everybody came around
And I was dancing with you
Don't know your name, making me ashamed
To feel the way that I do

The lights went out, couldn't be without
It was a place to be
I won't forget, the greatest times I had
When I was dancing with you

[Chorus]
Feel my heartbeat, truly to the beat
We all I want it now
Feel my heartbeat, truly to the beat
We all I want it now somehow

Feel my heartbeat, truly to the beat
Love the symphony
Feel my heartbeat, truly to the beat
Love the melody, come see

Feel my heartbeat, feel my heartbeat
Feel my heartbeat now
Feel my heartbeat, feel my heartbeat
Feel my heartbeat now somehow

[Outro]
There was a time, everybody was around
And I was dancing with you
Don't know your name, making me ashamed
To feel the way that I do

The lights went out, couldn't be without
It was a place to be
I won't forget, greatest times I had
When I was dancing with you
