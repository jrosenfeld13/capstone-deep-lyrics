Freedom train is coming - all around the
World
Talking 'bout freedom - yeah bring it
On

Drop what you're doing and climb on
Board
All it costs you is a song

Life
On the outside
Life on the
Outside

Don't worry 'bout the weather -
It's all in your head
We're all here for such
A short time
We got to learn to live together
Or we might as well be dead
Loosen up, baby
And have a good time

(chorus)
Leave
Behind your baggage - check your head, check your
Head
Life on the outside
Freedom train is
Leaving - be on it, be on it
Life on the
Outside

"inside" is so boring - the old
Man is snoring
But the young man is dying to
Live
You won't want to go back - once you're
Rollin' down the track

Can't get caught up
In what they want you to be
Be who you are -
That is the message
Beautiful world in
Dissonant harmony
Be who you are - that is the
Message
Leave behind your baggage - check your
Head, check your head
Freedom train is leaving
- be on it, be on it
Life on the
Outside

(chorus)
