Your ribbon in the summer breeze entwined in curls of gold
And the robin red breast's voice did sweetly blend
With a little schoolmate choir as they sang "Oh Promise Me"
When I wed you in love's game of let's pretend

The kid next door was parson and the church was make believe
For a wedding ring a hairpin I did bend
And while flowers along the wayside was my childhood bride's bouquet
When we married in love's game of let's pretend

Break (steel - fiddle)

Little did I think that day that somewhere along life's way
That the game of let's pretend again we'd start
But you cheated in the game and you drew another's name
Then the hand of fate dealt me a broken heart

On a pillow wet with tears I'll keep dreaming through the years
So forever let me be your closest friend
Though each vow you cast away you were mine in childhood days
When I wed you in love's game of let's pretend
