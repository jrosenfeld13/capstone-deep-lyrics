My friends all say, "How could you be so blind?"
I never thought she was the cheatin' kind
I lost my pride, & now I fear
That I'm the fool of the year

Ring, ring the bells & spread the word around
The king of fools has at last been found
Let's get together & give a cheer
For I'm the fool of the year

Get the blue ribbons, strike up the band
Come see the biggest fool; believe me, here I stand

(x2):
So you can see why I should get the prize
Since I'm the one who fell for all her lies
So clap your hands & I'll shed a tear
You're lookin' at the fool of the year

You're lookin' at the fool of the year
You're lookin' at the fool of the year
