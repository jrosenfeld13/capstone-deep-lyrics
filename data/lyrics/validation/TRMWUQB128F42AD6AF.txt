To look at a baby
You've gotta be brave
In the black of his eye
Is your own grave
And something darker
You wanna touch
It must be love
Cause it hurts so much

Love

Ive been to egypt
I've been to rome
I was a young man
When i left my home
Looking for something
I couldn't find
Now i'm back where i started
It was here all the time

Time

Out of the darkness
Into the light
I had it wrong
You made it right
I had it right
You made it wrong
Same old story
Same old song

Song

Some call me allah
Some call me tao
Some call me buddha
Some call me now
Some call me jesus
Some call me god
Some say i'm real
Some say i'm not
