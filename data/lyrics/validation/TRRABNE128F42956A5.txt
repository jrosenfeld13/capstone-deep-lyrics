Racing down the highway
Road's open wide
A modern-day young gun
On a steel horse ride
Feeling like an outlaw I'm Billy the kid
Makin' most of this moment
'Cause who knows when it will all end

Always on the run
And whatever comes
I'm stickin' to my guns

[Chorus]
They still call me Billy the kid
I'm still wanted for what I did
The price of fame is on my head
Can't shoot down old Billy the kid

Been told many times
To get outta town
I could walk away, baby
But I was born to fight
And I still believe
The west can be born to fight
And I still believe
The west can be won
I'll keep chasing those sunsets
With an angel riding shotgun

Papers say I'm dead
But I ain't buried yet
Still got bullets left

[Chorus]
They still call me Billy the kid
I'm still wanted for what I did
The price of fame is on my head
Can't shoot down old Billy the kid
