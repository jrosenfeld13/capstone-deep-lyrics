Somethings gotta give
Somethings gotta give
Somethings gotta give

When an irresistible force such as you
Meets and old immovable object like me
You can bet as sure as you live
Somethings gotta give, somethings gotta give
Somethings gotta give

When an irrepressible smile such as yours
Warms an old implacable heart such as mine
Don't say no because I insist
Somewhere, somehow
Someones gonna be kissed

So en garde who knows what the fates have in store
From their vast mysterious sky?
I'll try hard ignoring those lips I adore
But how long can anyone try?

Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight it with all of our might
Chances are some heavenly star spangled night
Well find out as sure as we live
Somethings gotta give, somethings gotta give
Somethings gotta give

Fight, fight, fight it with all of our might
Chances are some heavenly star spangled night
Well find out as sure as we live
Somethings gotta give, somethings gotta give
Somethings gotta give
Somethings gotta, somethings gotta give
