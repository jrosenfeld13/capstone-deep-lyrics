When there is fear
Here in your heart
Gone is the summer sun
Everyone must love someone

When you're at sea
Long is the night
How can the moon be real
Everyone must love

Yeah sometimes there's only pain and sorrow
And the stars are dead and gone
Yes you'll find
There's always be tomorrow
And everyone must love someone
Yes everyone must love someone
