I've dreamed of it again and again
And tonight I'll slide away
Through that magical place
Where the skeletons pray
A naked light shines everywhere
Visions of time fill the air
And the drowners don't care
Flying dogs in the waste land
Life surrounds
But doesn't touch me this time
It's just a funny game
That I'll play in nightime...
In nightime... my time
Atomic smiles behind the door
Pictures of you on the floor
It's the furthest trip
Everytime we go to sleep
Life surrounds
But doesn't touch me this time
It's just a funny game
That I'll play in nightime...
In nightime... my time
Stuffed birds smile in a cage
Let's go I know the lane
A naked light shines everywhere
Visions of time fill the air
And the drowners don't care
Flying dogs in the waste land
Life surrounds
But doesn't touch me this time
It's just a funny game
That I'll play in nightime...
In nightime... my time
