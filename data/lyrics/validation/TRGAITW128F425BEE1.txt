[Intro]
One, one
Two, two, two
Three, three
Right about now!
(Right now...)

[Verse 1]
Ten to doomsday, moving fast
Heads up! Mind that blast
No time to sleep, it's Def Con One
Can't get no sleep as the ticking ticks on
No time to fear, it's Def Con One
No time to eat, so get me some

[Pre-Chorus]
Big Mac, fries to go
Get me Big Mac, fries to go
Get me Big Mac, fries to go
Get me Big Mac, get me fries to go

[Chorus]
Watchman
We love you all
Hup! Hup! Heads up!
Ground floor, coming up

[Interlude]
Vote Dr. Doom!
Vote Dr. Doom!

[Verse 2]
How sick is Dick? How gone is Ron?
How sick is Dick? How gone is Ron?
(What's the time?) It's Def Con One!
Say, what's the time? Just get me some

[Pre-Chorus]
Big Mac, fries to go
Get me Big Mac, fries to go
Get me Big Mac, fries to go
Get me Big Mac, get me fries to go

[Chorus]
Watchman
We love you all
Hup! Hup! Heads up!
Ground floor, coming up

[Interlude]
Vote Dr. Doom!
Vote Dr. Doom!
You know it makes sense!
Vote Dr. Doom!

[Interlude]
You're travelling through another dimension
A dimension not only of sight and sound, but of mind
Your next stop: the Twilight Zone

[Pre-Chorus]
Big Mac, fries to go
Get me Big Mac, fries to go
Get me Big Mac, fries to go
Get me Big Mac, get me fries to go

[Chorus]
Watchman
We love you all
Hup! Hup! Heads up!
Ground floor, coming up

[Interlude]
Vote Dr. Doom!
Vote Dr. Doom!

[Verse 3]
Goodbye city, hello moon
Hands up! Vote Dr. Doom!
You know it makes sense! It's Def Con One
Hey, what's occurring? What goes on?
It's the only choice! It's Def Con One!
It's the only choice! So get me some

[Pre-Chorus]
Big Mac, fries to go
Get me Big Mac, fries to go
Get me Big Mac, fries to go
Get me Big Mac, get me fries to go
