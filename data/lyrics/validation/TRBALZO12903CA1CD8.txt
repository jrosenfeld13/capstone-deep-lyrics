(Ta da ta ta)
(Oh that's how the story goes)

So many places I wish I'd been
So many faces I wish I'd seen
So many people have never been loved
So many stories just wait to be told

I'm gonna get dressed up gonna get on a plane
Find me a better place where no one knows my name

Cause now it's out of my head
I really don't care too much about what people say
And now it's too late to cry
So go dry your eyes and blow your nose
It's how the story goes

So many lazy days I've had
So many crazy things I've said
So many wishes I wish I didn't made
So many sad songs I know I've played

I'm gonna get dressed up gonna get on my way
Find me a better place where no one knows my name

CHORUS

Oh sometimes you're falling in between
You're left on the outside
Oh sometimes you lose sometimes you win
So cold on the inside

The race is on and you race along
And your feet will ache and your heart will break
Cause it's true
Go dry your eyes and blow your nose

CHORUS
