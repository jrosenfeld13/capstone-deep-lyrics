Please don't chase me anymore
I nearly forgot just what i'm runnin for
I meant no harm
My gas pedal's to the floor
People watch this on tv
Never thought that this could happen to me
I can't stop now and it still seems like a dream
Never thought i'd hit someone
Now i see you clutching your gun
You're playin for keeps and now there's no place left to run

I had to make a choice, i made it
If i had another chance i'd take it
I've gotta find a way to make a getaway

Today my future looks so bright
All it took was one red light
Sirens were close behind
And my brain said fight or flight
So i ran from my mistake
Not the best choice i could make
The helicopter reminds me that this time there is no lucky break

I had to make a choice, i made it
If i had another chance i'd take it
I've gotta find a way to make a getaway

Please don't chase me anymore
I nearly forgot just what i'm runnin for
I meant no harm
My gas pedal's to the floor
I always do thing my own way
Never cared what the experts say
I thought they were so full of shit
I guess its time to pay
I always dreamed i'd have it all
Never thought i'd take the fall
And now i've run out of chances
And all i can i see is the wall
I had to make a choice i made it
If i had another chance. .
