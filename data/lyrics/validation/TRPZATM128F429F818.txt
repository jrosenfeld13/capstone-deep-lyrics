Jo-anne Jo-anne Jo-anne Jo-anne
Burning sun in the night
Up footsteps I walk the floor
So I face in the light
At face from the time before
I couldn't stop from recalling it
As a night will bright my eyes
Sweet young emotions never die

Jo-anne Jo-anne
When the night meets morning
At that time we'll meet the sun
We'll meet again Jo-anne Jo-anne

Ripples in your hair
We've just a day holding on
Feelings like we share
Their magic is just that strong
And then the time thus soften me
As a night will bright my eyes
Sweet young emotions never die

Jo-anne Jo-anne Jo-anne Jo-anne
When the night meets morning
At that time we'll meet the sun
We'll meet again Jo-anne Jo-anne

Jo-anne Jo-anne
When the night is burning
I will take you by the hand
When the tide is turning
And the roads turn age aside
We'll meet again Jo-anne Jo-anne
