And in the morning I awoke
I turned my eyes towards the road
I swallowed hard and smelt the air
I curse this world for not being fair
Oh in the morning I awoke

Through the seasons I have journeyed
Without a clue to where I bound
I lost the bearings long ago
I watched my heroes come and go
And since then I've heard no sound

So let me go far, so let me go far
And when I reach there let me know
Cause I'll keep walking
Please let me know
You've got to let me know

My belly yearns for food and drink
And my heart it yearns as always
Those pills you gave me for the pain
Made my mind never feel the same
Oh no oh no I won't see my home again

The vultures swoop above my love
The wisdom palace steeples shines
My battered longing for the truth
Keeps me clinging to my youth
And what was truly mine

So let me go far, so let me go far
And when I reach there let me know
Cause I'll keep on walking
Please let me know

So let me go far (repeated)
