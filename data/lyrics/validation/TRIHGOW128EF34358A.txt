[Verse 1]
I woke up today in London
As the plane was touching down
And all I could think about was Monday
Maybe I'd be back around
If this keeps me away much longer
I don't know what I would do
You've got to understand it's a hard life
That I'm going through

[Chorus]
And when the night falls in around me
I don't think I'll make it through
I'll use your light to guide the way
'Cause all I think about is you

[Verse 2]
Well, L.A. is getting kind of crazy
And New York is getting kind of cold
I keep my head from getting lazy
I just can't wait to get back home

[Pre-Chorus]
And all these days I spend away
I'll make up for this, I swear
I need your love to hold me up
When it's all too much to bear

[Chorus]
And when the night falls in around me
I don't think I'll make it through
I'll use your light to guide the way
'Cause all I think about is you
(Woah, woah)

[Pre-Chorus]
And all these days I spend away
I'll make up for this, I swear
I need your love to hold me up
When it's all too much to bear

[Chorus]
And when the night falls in around me
I don't think I'll make it through
I'll use your light to guide the way
'Cause all I think about is you
