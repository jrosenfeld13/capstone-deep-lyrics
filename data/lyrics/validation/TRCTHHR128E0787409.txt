[Verse 1]
I'm Eleanor Rigby
I picked up the rice in the church where the weddings have been
Yeah I'm Eleanor Rigby
I'm keeping my face in a jar by the door
If you want to know what is it for, Well

[Chorus]
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong

[Verse 2]
Father McKenzie
Writing the words to a sermon
That no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Knoting his socks in the night
What does he care, Yeah

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Eleanor Rigby died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie Wiping the dirt from his hands
As he walks from the grave
