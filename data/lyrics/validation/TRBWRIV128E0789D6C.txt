Slim and tall behind me
Spinnin' me off of my feet
Headin' for the D
We're taking our act to the street
Roll around the city, leavin' our tracks on the ground

Elevator up
Baby I don't wanna come down

Hangin' with sinners
The undesirable crowd
Tokin' on the train
Playin' our radio loud
Got a sweet need for speed that doesn't know no bounds

Elevator up
Baby I don't wanna come down

Spend a little time in the back of my mind
Now it may be time to pay up to go
I've done it
I've had it
I'm ready for bed
Anywhere at all
Any way the wind blows

Say hello to Molly
She's got a sister as well
Such a pleasant girl
As far as your family can tell
Hold the camera steady, turn the shutter speed way down

Elevator up
Baby I don't wanna come down

Spend a little time in the back of my mind
Now it may be time to pay up and go
I've done it
I've had it
I'm ready for bed
Anywhere at all
Any way the wind blows

Spend a little time in the back of my mind
Now it may be time to pay up and go
I've done it
I've had it
I'm ready for bed
Anywhere at all
Any way the wind blows
