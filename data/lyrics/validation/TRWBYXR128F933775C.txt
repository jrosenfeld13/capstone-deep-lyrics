I was standing on the stop
Thinking of humanity
When you came along so righteous with a new national hate
So convincing is the ardor of war and of men
It's harder to breathe than to believe you're a friend

You stick me in the back with a sideways smile
Unity's the front of a gang mental
You're trying to burn the ashes
But they won't catch fire
While reason is coagulating in the mire

As the final poor man's carcass washes up on my shore
I don't know much but I know that wars begets more war

Are you willing to wait?
For another watergate?
This national uproar's got me in surrender
Fear is the sender

'Cause the whole wide world is watching
But no one's doing anything
'Cause the whole wide world is watching
We justify the enemy

How unpopular it seems to be persuasive for peace
I got a mind full of destruction
But it's only for me
Like a wedding vow I speak the word: equality
But, alas, I feel that everyone is stronger than me

You know that I was born against the O.I.A
(oppression, ignorance, authority)
But that is nothing new if you've heard what I say
As Mahatma sheds a tear, buried so deep underground
We continue to uphold the men who keep us down

Are you willing to die?
For a president-sized lie?
For a man you've never met?
Why ask why?
We stick our brother

'Cause the whole wide world is watching
But no one's doing anything
'Cause he whole wide world is watching
We justify the enemy

'Cause the whole wide world is watching
But no one's doing anything
'Cause the whole wide world is watching
We justify the enemy

All we are
And dream to be
Come to pass
It won't, you'll see
While the land we claim to be
Chains the world so we are free
