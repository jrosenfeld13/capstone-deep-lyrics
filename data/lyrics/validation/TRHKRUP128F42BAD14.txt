Are we really in love at all?
Or something little
Is it stuck inside it all?
Or something little

Now we didn't doubt a sight
Its a drummers lie
And we never meant to call at all
We just wash the floor

And now if they don't fade down to feature
Darkness and wind it wails and wants
Not like we forget to come between us
Not random for something real

Are we really in love at all?
Just watch your sleep
And we never meant to call at all
We just wash the floor

And now if they don't fade down to feature
Darkness and wind it wails and wants
Not like we forget to come betweens us
Not random for something real

And now if they don't fade down to feature
Darkness and wind it wails and wants
Not like we forget to come between us
Too random for something real
