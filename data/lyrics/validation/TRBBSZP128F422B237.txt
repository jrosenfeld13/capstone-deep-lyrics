I know where a pretty girl lives
She lives in a house on yonder hill
I'm going to go there with my gun
I'm going to kill her dad and mom

I'm going to take her home with me
I will love her and she will see
We'll be married, she and I
We'll be together 'til she dies

I'll bury her body in the woods
And I'll try to resist the temptation
To dig her up
And fuck her
