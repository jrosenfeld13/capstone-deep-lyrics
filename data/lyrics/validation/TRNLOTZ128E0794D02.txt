I wanted to go where the antelope play now
Well, I looked around, they've all gone away now
Man, I wish I could drink where the water is so clear
It might clear my mind, my mind comes and goes here

Once I cut my hand but the wound was not part of me
Well now I'm a man, there's a wound at the heart of me
Man, I wish I could leave, and I guess I would stay there
Wherever that is, that is far from anywhere

There's a stream running over on distant shores
Everybody's swimming in the water

Baby, I want to go where nobody would change me
Or change my mind, my mind that contains me
And is contained by the starlight surrounding us
Like falling rain, pouring down on us

There's a stream running over on distant shores
Everybody's swimming in the water
