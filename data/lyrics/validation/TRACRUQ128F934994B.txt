I worked all day long out in the cold and snow
I come home lookin' for my supper
You're around some whiskey store

You're just a whiskey drinkin' woman
We never will get very far
Because every time I wanna find you
I just go around some whiskey bar

I leave house written grocery bill
At home every week and every Monday mornin'
The landlord puts my clothes out in the street

Because you're the whiskey drinkin' woman
We never will get very far
Well then every time I wanna find you
You're layin' around some whiskey bar

You know our friends came around
To give us a nice time
You say, "Hurry, let's go to the liquor store
Before they change their mind"

Just a whiskey drinkin' woman
We never will get very far
Well then every time I wanna find you
You're layin' around some whiskey bar

Now so you can pack up baby
Out for yourself you must go
I never see you nowhere
Unless I stop at some whiskey store

Just a whiskey drinkin' woman
We never will get very far
Well then every time I wanna find you
You're layin' around some whiskey bar
