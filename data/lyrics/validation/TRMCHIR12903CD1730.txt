Growing up like any other child
Like millions of others before
A statistic living exactly
By the norm

Don't need to think about
Future now
It's already decided for you
You have all you need
So don't ask for more

Existing like the rest
In endless emptiness
Manipulated slaves
From the womb until the grave
You never had a chance
They put you in a trance
Against your will

No reason to exist
Life is controlled
No way to resist
No reason to exist
There has to be a reason to exist

Year by year and day by day
You feel the need to escape
You realize that you're
Not the same
But you're too uncertain
To make a step
Away from their false truth
But remember how fast you
Lose the years of youth

Existing like the rest
In endless emptiness
Manipulated slaves
From the womb until the grave
You never had a chance
They put you in a trance
Against your will

No reason to exist
Life is controlled
No way to resist
No reason to exist
There has to be a reason to exist

Those who have a passion to
Will never change our way of life
We may not think the way you do
But we know that we are right
Those who want to form a world
Of friends and monotony
Have to do it without us
Cause we always be free

No reason to exist
Life is controlled
No way to resist
No reason to exist
There has to be a reason to exist!
