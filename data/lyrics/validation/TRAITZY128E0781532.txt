Seven years wash up behind me
And I'm wondering what the time is
It's a question of perception
I don't want you with hurt

There's an old man in the corner
In his sunk and withered features
See reflections of my future
Will you join me there

I'm here to find the watershed
To shake the past away
Drown my in a pool of tears
And start another day

Now, I've swallowed down the poison
Sister will you still believe me
Will you feed me down the serum
Will you follow me

I'm here to find the watershed
To shake the past away
Drown me in a pool of tears
And start another day

My secret haunt
My favourite place

Where I cut down
Where I cut down
Where I cut down
Where I cut down

So I cut down
So I cut down
So I cut down
So I cut down
