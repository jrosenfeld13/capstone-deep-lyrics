And the miles, and the trials, and the cities made of gold...
But there's a free way... a free way... a free way to carry you home

Tell the world, the young and old...
And every boy and girl
That there's a free way... a free way... a free way to carry you home

OH WHAT A FEELING
OH WHAT A FEELING
KNOW FROM WHAT YOU'VE LEARNED
IT CAME FROM AFRICA!

OH WHAT A FEELING
OH WHAT A FEEDING
KNOW THE CHOSEN ONES...
THEY COME FROM EVERYWHERE
THEY COME FROM EVERYWHERE
THEY COME FROM EVERYWHERE!!!
