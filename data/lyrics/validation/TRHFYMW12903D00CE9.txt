Power, The meaning of control
Start the war, to purify your soul
To purify
Your sense of purpose, your self control
To nullify your sense of reason
Your destiny to sacrifice, reborn to the skies

[Chorus:]
Separate the Mind

Now it's time
Time to die

Lead the way, with death in your eyes
Seize the day, they'll suffer for their lies
Suffer
For their deception, they justify
For sacrificing countless innocents
Divinity within your sights, just do what your told

[Chorus]
Fuck the war, the politics of hate
Murderers all blinded by their fate
Blinded
By grand illusions, by their belief
That death would make them saints and martyrs
Your leaders' safe, at home in their beds
