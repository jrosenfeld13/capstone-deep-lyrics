Take away my prime from the mouth of the lion
Savage jaws are the price we pay
Take away their lies let me see with my own eyes
Walk along the narrow way

Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
Oh what a waste
Your sword is no use when you're standing face to face
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
Oh what a waste
Harvest the human race
Your sword's no use to you when standing face to face
They say

Hey fool, watch out!
You'll get mauled by the lion's mouth
Hey fool, watch out!
You'll get mauled by the lion's mouth

Take away my chains
Don't want to see 'em again
Take away my misery
Take away my blindfold
Don't want to belong to the yo-o-old
Take it up and set me free

Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
Oh what a waste
Your sword is no use when you're standing face to face
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
Oh what a waste
A mystic human race
Your sword's no use to you when standing face to face
They say

Hey fool, watch out!
You'll get mauled by the lion's mouth
I don't think so
Hey fool, watch out!
You'll get mauled by the lion's mouth
I don't think so
