Kim:
Da da da da.....
Lying around all over the ground
Readin' up, up and down
Tryin' to find a lovely time
Tryin' to find a friend of mine
Never thought to shake the lock
Fightin', fightin', not to shock
I've been around in your mind
Oh my look it's lovely vine
Da da da da....
Hey darling you're the one for fun
Makes me feel as tight as a plum
Something's near it's just begun
Turn around you're actin' dumb
You can't turn the sky from grey
Make it pink don't stay awake
Freckles floatin' in the hay
Cuz it's now a brand new day
Da da da da....
Never thought you'd ever mend
Turn the page it's near the end
Garden's ready for me to tend
Whatever, let's pretend
Da da da da......
