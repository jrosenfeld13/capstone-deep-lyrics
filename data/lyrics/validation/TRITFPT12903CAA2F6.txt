If I was the sun
And you were the rain
Then maybe I'd see
Why we can't meet again
If I were born free
And you were in chains
Then I'd understand
All of this hurt and pain

Whoa, ho, oh sweet mercy me
Whoa, ho, oh sweet mercy me
I thought we were two hands working as one
I thought it was love but it had never begun

If you were my pride
And I was your shame
Then maybe I'd remember to forget your name
And if love was a lie
And it hid from the truth
Then I'd understand
Why I'm so lost to you

Whoa, ho, oh sweet mercy me
Whoa, ho, oh sweet mercy me
I thought we were two hands working as one
I thought it was love but it had never begun

If I were a rebel
And you were my cause
Would I still love you with all of your flaws
Yes I am a rebel
And you are my cause
And I still love you
My darling of course

Whoa, ho, oh sweet mercy me
Whoa, ho, oh sweet mercy me
I thought we were two hands working as one
I thought it was love but it had never begun
I thought we were two hands beating in time
Oh tell me when will your love ever be mine
I thought we were two hands working as one
I thought it was love but it had never begun
