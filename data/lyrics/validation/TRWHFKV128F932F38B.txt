[Verse 1]
I don't care, about your past
I just want, our love to last
I don't care, darling, about your faults
I just want to satisfy your pulse

[Chorus]
When you kiss me
When you miss me
Hold my hand
Make me understand
I break out - in a cold sweat

[Verse 2]
I don't care about your wants
I just wanna, tell ya about the do's and don'ts
I don't care, about the way you treat me darling
I just want, you to understand me honey

[Chorus]

[Outro]
[Extra Ad-Libs]
Mercy on me
C'mon now
Brother
Put it, put it where it's at now
Let him have it
