When my grandpa was a boy
He went down to the general store
Saw a picture book of a whale
Shooting its spout and flashin' its tail

Then he got a sailor's dream
'Bout cruisin' around on the salty sea
Joinin' up with a fishin' crew
To go out and get him a whale or two

Tell me what kind of men are these
Who sail upon the salty seas ?
Up in the rigging in the afternoon
Swabbin' the decks and sharpenin' harpoons

Hooray and up she rises
Hooray and up she rises
Hooray and up she rises
Early in the morning

There're lots of whales in the deep blue sea
We kill them for the company
We drag 'em 'longside and chop 'em in two
And melt 'em down and sell 'em to you

There hardly is a sailor alive
Who can keep the tears from his eyes
As he remembers the good old days
When there were no whales to save

Thank the Russians and Japanese
For scouring the deep blue seas
Looking for ivory and perfume
And plastic toys and pet food

Hooray and up she rises
Hooray and up she rises
Hooray and up she rises
Early in the morning

Shanghaied by the light of the moon
Put out from Boston in the middle of June
After six months out at sea
It's nothin' but death and misery

Set out on a three-year cruise
A union ship and a union crew
And after six months you begin to see
That whalin's not what it used to be

A modern ship and a modern crew
With sonar scopes and explodin' harpoons
A mechanical boat made outta steel
A floating machine built to kill the whales

Hooray and up she rises
Hooray and up she rises
Hooray and up she rises
Early in the morning
