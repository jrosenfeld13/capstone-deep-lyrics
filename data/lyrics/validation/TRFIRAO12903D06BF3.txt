Have you seen a flame when it comes to life?
It was always waitin', it just needed a strike
Have you got a match? 'Cause I'm lookin' to be lit
Open up your stash, I'm a kerosene lamp

I thought I told you I would need
More than your average affection

So, why?
Tell me, why should I ever be cold in the night?
It just isn't right, oh, why should I be cold?
I'm too cold

Across this moonlit room, I see the silhouette of a man
Sleepin' all alone on the edge of the bed
But I am right here, are you really that tired?
Now, would it be so hard to come to my side?

Oh, I thought I told you that I would need
More than just sometime attention

Why?
Tell me, why should I ever be cold in the night?
It just isn't right, oh, why should I be cold?
Yeah, I'm too cold

Has it been too long, am I just an old shoe?
When the trends are all gone, am I your go-to?
What did you see when you brought me in from the storm?
Our bed used to be so warm

So, why?
Tell me, why should I ever be cold in the night?
It just isn't right, oh, why should I be cold?
Yeah, it's too cold

Why should I ever be cold?
Never be cold
