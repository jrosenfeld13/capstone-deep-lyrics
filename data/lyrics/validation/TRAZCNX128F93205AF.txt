Star of love will be my leader
It's nothing there to stop me now
You are my light, like a vision
You are the one that fills my soul

You're my star, shining star
You are shining down on me
You're my star, my shining star, you're my star

You're my star, shining star
You are shining down on me
You're my star, my shining star, you're my star

You're my star, shining star
You are shining down on me
You're my star, my shining star, you're my star
