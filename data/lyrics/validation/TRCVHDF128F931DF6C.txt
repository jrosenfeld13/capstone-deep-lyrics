[Verse 1]
Not another existential cowboy
And no more "California champagne"
Not another saddle tramp --
Sick, sore, lonely, and out of place
Cryin' in his coffee ice cream (come on)
Edith cannot fix another engine
Nor paint another face on a rubber can clown (woo woo woo)
She takes another temp job
But in her secret heart, she rides!

[Chorus]
She's just a sad sweetheart of the rodeo
Not an urban legend now
Sad sweetheart of the rodeo

[Verse 2]
Give it a rest, give it a rest, give it a bad night's sleep
Norman says that you could take a Valium
(or maybe something stronger)
'Cause he doesn't understand, uh
How you get so excited watching 'The Lusty Men'
"The Marlboro Man died of cancer
And he wasn't a rocket scientist when he was healthy, ha ha ha."
She took one last gulp of his soft city condescension
And blasted off from his little launch pad to parts west

[Chorus]
Sad sweetheart of the rodeo
Not an urban legend now
Sad sweetheart of the rodeo
(lonesome cowboy Bill, where are you?)

Sad sweetheart of the rodeo
Not an urban legend now
Sad sweetheart of the rodeo
