Want to cross
But I don't think I can
It's too weak here
Even where I stand
Come here darling
Let me see you hold my hand
So we can mend your broken halo

All I want from you
Well all I want from you
Is for you to turn around
Turn around

Wanted to damage
So I damaged it some
We used to have it all
Now I just got some
The silence, perfections, mysteries
All easy to fall from your lips
All the while lies were told to me
In shapeless secrets

When all I want from you
All I want from you
Is for you to turn around
Turn around
Turn around
Turn around

Can't you turn around
Can't you turn around
Can't you turn around
Why can't you turn around?
Turn around
Turn around
Turn around
