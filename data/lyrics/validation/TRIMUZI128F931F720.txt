I saw the rain fall down today
Watch lightning crash through skies of grey
Why cant life just be polite, and wait

I saw the lights outside your house
Red lights cut like nothin else
The scene of a silent cry for help,..

How are we supposed to do this?
If everyone we love, still lets us down
If youre there, can you hear me now?

Chorus
No matter how hard I try
Cant get you out of my mind
Wish I could be there to help you say goodbye
Dont hold it inside, cause whats left can be right
Whats left can be right

I saw the sky go black today
I felt your tears, and ached your pain
Its hard to tell how much this changed
How you see everything
And all I can do is pray
That you dont take the blame
Cause its not your fault, that it happened this way
Happened this way

How are we supposed to do this?
If everyone we love, still lets us down
If youre there, can you hear me now?

Chorus
No matter how hard I try
Cant get you out of my mind
Wish I could be there to help you say goodbye
Dont hold it inside, cause whats left can be right
Whats left can be right
