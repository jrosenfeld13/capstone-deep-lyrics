Tell me the way
Tell me the way

If you feel left alone
I'll be looking for you
If you feel left alone
What would you want me to do?

If you need time to know
I can find time for you
What would you want me to do?

Beat, beat, beat...

Tell me the way
Tell me the way

Tell me the way
Tell me the way

Tell me the way
Tell me the way

If you can't bare it all
I can stop this for you
If you can't bare it all
What would you want me to do?

If you can see my love
I can see love in you
What would you want me to do?

Kickin' the beat, kickin' the beat
Kickin' the beat, kickin' the beat
Kickin' the beat, kickin' the beat
Kickin' the beat, kickin' the beat

Beat, beat, beat...

Tell me the way
Tell me the way

Tell me the way
Tell me the way

Tell me the way
