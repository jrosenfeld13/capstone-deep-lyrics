I found myself
At the point where we kissed first
On a rooftop
Overlooking the East London mosque

They say, they say, they say, they say
"You can't go around breaking young girls' hearts"
I say, I say, I say, I say
"Keep it casual, easy thing"

And you looked so right
In that red dress

Oh, how I'd love to be a rock for you
To be anything you could rely on

So I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try
But I'll get caught out
So we'll try, we'll try, we'll try, we'll try
But we forget the lines
Forget the lines

And you looked so wanton
In the back of the car
Like you could start a hundred wars

See what trouble wicked thoughts cause
By the bedroom door, the kitchen floor
I tried, I tried, I tried
I tried, I tried, I tried
Oh, Marlena, I'm too young
To be the father to our son
I tried, I tried, I tried
I tried, I tried, I tried

Forgive me, Oscar
Forgive me, Oscar
Forgive me, Oscar
Forgive me, Oscar
Forgive me, Oscar
