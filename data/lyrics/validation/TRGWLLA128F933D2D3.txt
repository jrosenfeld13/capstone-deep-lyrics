I want to be dominated, have my masculinity deflated
Push me around a little more, that way I respect you more
When it's all said and done, what a strange idea of fun
Lay me on my back, I'm just a rubber husband
My heart's such an open sore, how can I trust you any more
Slap my face, pull my hair, love me, tell me you care
