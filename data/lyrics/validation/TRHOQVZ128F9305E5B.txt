[Verse 1]
Hey, up in the backwoods, down in the huller
Old boys feeling like a dog on a collar
Keeping that chain pulled tight
Waiting on Saturday night
Put on the smell-good, put on Skynard
Head into to town like a NASCAR winner
Cruising back an' forth to the Tasty-Freeze
Everywhere you look, all you see

[Chorus]
Is hillbilly deluxe, slick pick-up trucks
Big timing in a small town
Stirring it up right about sundown
Black denim and chrome
To the bone with a little home grown
A country girl cuddled up
Hillbilly deluxe

[Verse 2]
Yeah, couple cute sweet things driving a fastback
Shoot 'em a cool smile hoping that they smile back
"Hey, Baby, what's you name?"
Burn a little rubber when the red lights change
Here come the blue lights, here come Barney
Hide all the beer, y'all, let's move the party
Gotta go, but that's all right
Do it all again next Friday night

[Chorus][x2]
