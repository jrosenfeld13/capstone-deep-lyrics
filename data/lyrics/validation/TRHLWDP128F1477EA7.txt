[Intro: Spoken]
(There's no....those things worth?....it's hella sensitive)

[Verse 1]
Always the same old taste just new injury
Well I'll wear the claws if you'd like that
Yeah if you'd like that we can ride on a black horse
A great new wave Hesparian death horse
I can call you when I get back
Yeah when I get back I will call

[Chorus]
But don't speak, don't say nothing
In case we ever do meet again
Something's wrong with you
Well I hope we never do meet again

[Verse 2]
You always sharpen your teeth cause you're like that
And you're like that every time you pull heart back
And her compact's carving deeper in your lap
I would call but I forget where the phone is at
Guess I'll talk to you when I get back
Yeah when I get back I will talk

[Chorus]
But don't speak, don't say nothing
In case we ever should meet again
There are some things wrong with you
I hope we never do meet again
I hope we never do meet again
I hope we never do meet again

[Bridge]
Something's wrong with you
And I hope we never do meet again
Something's wrong with you
And I hope we never do meet again
Something's wrong with you
And I hope we never do meet again

[Chorus]
But don't speak, don't say nothing
In case we ever should meet again
Something's wrong with you
And I hope we never do meet again

[Outro x8]
And I hope we never do meet again
