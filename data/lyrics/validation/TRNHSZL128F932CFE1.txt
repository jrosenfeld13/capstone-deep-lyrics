Well I cream my jeans when I see my baby coming down the hall
My baby's got no legs at all

She's got hot stumps
My heart goes thump thump
She's the only one for me
She's my amputee

Well she left her legs on the highway late one night
My baby never saw the light

She's got hot stumps
My heart goes thump thump
She's the only one for me
She's my amputee

Come on
Sugar, how I love her

My baby's got no legs no more
Now she's crawling on the floor

'Cause she's got hot stumps
My heart goes thump thump
I love her hot stumps
They give me goosebumps
She's the only one for me
She's my amputee
