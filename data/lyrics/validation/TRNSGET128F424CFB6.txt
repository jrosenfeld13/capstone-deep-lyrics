Your Thoughts Are Abducted
By The Shit That Others Talk
Failing To Express Your Own Ideas
Take A Fucken Walk

Living By What Others Say
They Become An Influence
Can't Think Straight Cuz You're Afraid
Stupid People Easy To Convince

Doing Things You Wouldn't Do
You're A Follower You Don't Care
Try To Think And Be Yourself
You're A Clone You Wouldn't Dare

You Want Someone To Look Up To
You Want All Your Problems Solved
Others Take Advantage Of You
Serves You Right For Getting Involved
