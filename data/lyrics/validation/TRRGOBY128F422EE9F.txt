Dustin
Yea, b5
These are things I'd do for you
Baby

First imma stop and get myself a brand new whip and
Make sure its sittin on something big so it can dizz in
Hit the atm, get my pockets wet
So I could get her anything she wants

Patrick
I got big plans fo' sho
Pleasing you thats my goal

Dustin
Ain't used to this kinda stuff
I'm doing it just because
Cuz im all in love

Patrick - Chorus
The things I would do for my girl
Give up all the ladies
I been seeing lately
You'd be my only baby
The things I would do for my girl
Take you to the hot spots
Pull up in the soft tops
Watch when all they eyes drop
The things I would do for my girl
I know them other players
Weren't really there for you
So come and get wit this
I'm gonna take good care of you
{So here we go} my girl
{Just let em know} your my girl
These are the things I would do
For my - the things I would do for my girl

Dustin

Im gon cop you them new goods
Ain't nobody got yet
Make sure its fittin nice n dice so
I can see it
Takin you on the road
Come through at all my shows
Make you the main girl in my videos

Patrick
I got big plans for sho
Pleasing you thats my goal

Dustin
Ain't used to this kinda stuff
I'm doing it just because
Cuz I'm all in love

Patrick - Chorus
The things I would do for my girl
Give up all the ladies
I been seeing lately
You'd be my only baby
The things I would do for my girl
Take you to the hot spots
Pull up in the soft tops
Watch when all they eyes drop
The things I would do for my girl
I know them other players
Weren't really there for you
So come and get wit this
I'm gonna take good care of you
(So here we go) my girl
(Just let em know) your my girl
These are the things I would do
For my- the things I would do for my girl

Kelly
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Come through, say im wrong in a
Middle of the fight
Say I love you with a kiss on the forehead
More red roses
Plus you gotta see where my home is
No love for the fiends tryna temp me
South beach breeze to crease to the Bentley
Hold hands talk about my dreams
And make your plans
Anything you want
Put it on your man
Tell me all about the things you like
I wanna be the one to treat you right
I wanna be the one to come when you call
Drop funds at the mall
Wanna be the one to freak you right {freak you right}
Everything I would do for you
Every move I'd move for you
Every song I sing
We could talk about a ring
But first I got things I gotta prove to you

{Patrick - Chorus til' fade}
