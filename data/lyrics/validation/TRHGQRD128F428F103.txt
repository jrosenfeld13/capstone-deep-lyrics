Please yell if you are paying attention
Ahh!

Please yell if you are paying attention

(voice on the left)
Place your attention entirely on my voice and try to ignore all the others. It is important to be able to focus on a single source of information, while blocking out all the other things that are competing for your attention

(voice in the middle)
Place your attention of all on the different voices simultaneously. In the past, having just one attention may have been sufficient. But today you must be able to focus your attention on several things at once

(voice on the right)
Place your attention on one of the other voices during this section. Stop listening to my voice now and move onto one of the other voices before it's too late. If you are still listening to my voice this means that you have poor control of your attention

Your attention, please
Please yell if you are paying attention
Ahh!
Please yell
Ahh!
Please yell
Ahh!

Your attention, please
