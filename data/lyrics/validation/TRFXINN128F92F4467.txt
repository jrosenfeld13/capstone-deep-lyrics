Wait, till I get home
Before you walk out my life
Shuffle all your cloth
Before you walk out that door

I'll be waiting for something real
Or until I see the lights
The mystery boys and that plan we made
Keeps me stuck in that damn hotel

But ill be holding on to things that I can not change
Without you I don't think I can make it on my own

Take me, to the bar tonight
Stay out till the cocaine's gone
I don't remember what you said
Or why I treated you so bad

I'll be waiting for something real
Or until I see the lights
The mystery boys and that plan we made
Keeps me stuck in that damn hotel

But ill be holding on to things that I can not change
Without you I don't think I can make it on my own

I see the lights
Maybe it's that bottle of wine
So until you come around
Then I'll take that coffee now
Because I don't think I can wait until the end

I don't need no help
I can feel helpless on my own
I don't need no help I can feel helpless on my own
Why you do me right
I do you wrong only do you wrong
Because these women believe but I only leave
So go doll leave me alone
She got married on the 4th
Divorced of course and now she's on her own
Come back home to her mothers arms
Sleep on the living room floor
Where that dress her hairs a mess
Makeup on the dresser drawer
Although the love is gone
You'll find someone but you don't know what your doing it for
And all the plans we had
Where did they go?
Didn't you say you need me so much
So much

I see the lights
Maybe it's that bottle of wine
So until you come around
Then ill take that coffee now

I see the lights
Maybe it's that bottle of wine
So until you come around
Then ill take that coffee now
