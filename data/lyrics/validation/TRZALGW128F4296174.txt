[Verse 1: Ben Gibbard]
Will someone please call a surgeon
Who can crack my ribs and repair this broken heart that you're deserting
For better company
I can't accept that it's over
And I will block the door
Like a goalie tending the net in the third quarter
Of a tied-game rivalry
So, just say how to make it right
And, I swear I'll do my best to comply

[Hook: Ben Gibbard]
Tell me am I right to think that there could be nothing better
Than making you my bride and slowly growing old together?

[Verse 2: Jen Wood & Ben Gibbard]
I feel I must interject here
You're getting carried away feeling sorry for yourself
With these revisions and gaps in history
So let me help you remember
I've made charts and graphs that should finally make it clear
Prepared a lecture
On why I have to leave
So, please back away and let me go
I can't my darling I love you so
Oh, oh

[Hook: Ben Gibbard & Jen Wood]
Tell me am I right to think that there could be nothing better
Than making you my bride and slowly growing old together
(Tell me am I right?) Don't you feed me lies about some idealistic future
(Tell me am I right?) Your heart won't heal right if you keep tearing out the sutures

[Outro: Ben Gibbard & Jen Wood]
I know that I have made mistakes
And I swear I'll never wrong you again
You've got allure, I can't deny
But, you've had your chance so say goodbye
Say goodbye
