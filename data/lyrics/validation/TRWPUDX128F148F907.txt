[Verse 1]
When the stars are in the skies
Make a wish then close your eyes
Are you dreaming?
Angels singing
Everything is right
It's the magic of the night

[Verse 2]
Far horizons made of snow
Bring the hopes each child will know
Someone's dreaming
Bells are ringing
Everything is white
It's the magic of the night

[Chorus]
High up in the sky
Can you see a shining light?
Can it be that we can see
An angel who is flying, flying

[Verse 3]
Can an angel lose their way?
Who of us on earth can say?
Someone's dreaming
Angels singing
Everything is right
It's the magic of the night

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
High up in the sky
Can you see a shining light?
Can it be that we can see
An angel who is flying, flying

[Verse 4]
When the stars are in the skies
Make a wish then close your eyes
Are you dreaming?
Bells are ringing
Angels are in flight
It's the magic of the night

[Outro]
Angels are in flight
It's the magic of the night
