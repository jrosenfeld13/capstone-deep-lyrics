Small girl with the smiling 'gibbon
Bridled with an orchid ribbon
His curved brow in Scarlatti fashion
Boots that ride the night sky eagle

Salamanda Palaganda, oh
Palamino Blue
Salamanda Palaganda, oh
June's Buffalo too
In the Parisian zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo

An old crone squirms upon a cushion
Made from Madras silk and satin
Her steel eyes hold a scimitar passion
For the skull hewn in Scarlatti fashion

Salamanda Palaganda, oh
Palamino Blue
Salamanda Palaganda, oh
June's Buffalo too
In the Parisian zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo

A cobra seer with the punctured ear
Slaughtered a Malayan sun bear
Night stood erect with brozen haunches
Zapped the seer and gave the bear back to us

Salamanda Palaganda, oh
Palamino Blue
Salamanda Palaganda, oh
June's Buffalo too
In the Parisian zoo zoo zoo zoo zoo

Salamanda Palaganda
Salamanda Palaganda
Salamanda Palaganda
Salamanda Palaganda
Salamanda Palaganda
