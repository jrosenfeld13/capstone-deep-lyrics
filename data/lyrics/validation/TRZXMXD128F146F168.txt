I was born in the room where I wrote this song
Within the same four walls, twenty years on
Time to make a new step but take another fall
Do I learn what is right by wrong, doing it all?
I found a place of bone
I felt strangely at home
Where the grass turned to sand
And the steeples became domes
I lay myself down in the shadow of a tree
Served by a toothless waiter who sang to me for free

I listen to the voices
The voices say to me, yeah
Untie all your spaces
And in a single bow you'll be free

White light when I depart
But it's clear on my return

Some steps have been taken
But there's a lot left to learn, a lot left to learn
They built these walls to keep me safe
But now they need it no longer
And I could see their mistakes, I could see their mistakes

I listen to the voices
The voices say to me, yeah
Untie all your traces
And in a single bow you'll be free
And in a single bow you'll be free
In a single bow you'll be free
In a single bow you'll be free
In a single bow
A single bow you'll be free
