A starless dark
Dazed eyes of a child
Disbelief inside
A bleak scene
That slowly dies
Our ravished paradise
Will show us how small we are

Low-handing clouds
Pour rain down
Soiled water overfloats
Covers all the ground

An unlit sky
Garden of lost souls
Empty echoes vanish away
Distant faint prayers
Our futures despaired
A cold gale blows into our hearts
Our ravished paradise
Will show us how small we are

Low-handing clouds
Pour rain down
Soiled water overfloats
Covers all the ground

No longer beat the hearts
No longer fleet the clouds
No longer blows the with
As we all drown
Into dark water

No longer do the flowers bloom
No longer do the birds sing
No longer do our children play
As we all drown
Where are the gods now
Where hides the salvation
When we drown
Into dark waters
