Can you fit me into all this lunacy?
Made-to-measure misfits are a liability
How do I exist without variety?
Bring me back to life because I need some funk

Wake me up revive me with your memory
I am only someone when the children think of me
I cannot exist without some vanity
Bring me back to life because I need some junk

Will you get to heaven if you like a drive-in movie?
Will you get to heaven if you own a TV station?
Will you get to heaven with advance publicity?

Can you fit me into all this lunacy?
Can I love myself without some fun technology?
How do I exist without insanity?
Bring me back to life because I need some funk

Will you get to heaven if you like a drive-in movie?
Will you get to heaven if you own a TV station?
Will you get to heaven with advance publicity?

Will you get to heaven if you like a drive-in movie?
Will you get to heaven if you own a TV station?
Will you get to heaven with advance publicity?

Will you get to heaven if you like a drive-in movie?
