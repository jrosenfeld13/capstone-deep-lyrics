Tell yourself
Control it from the inside
Losing streak
You realise you're letting go

Holding on
Exploding from the inside
Far beyond all reason

Forge your coin
To get across the river
Sink down deep
Deep underground

Searching on
Daylight in the tunnel
Far beyond all reason

It's drifting in and out in waves
We're living in the strangest daze
A picture in a different frame
You only hear me when you're miles and miles away

Silently you fall away
Silently you fall away from me
Tell yourself
Not to show a downside
Over the edge
Your fingers down your collar

Suffocate
I see you're barely breathing
Wide-eyed and screaming

It's drifting in and out in waves
We're living in the strangest daze
A picture in a different frame
You only hear me when you're miles and miles away

You only hear me when you're miles away
You only hear me when you're miles away
You only hear me when you're miles away
You only hear me when you're miles and miles away
