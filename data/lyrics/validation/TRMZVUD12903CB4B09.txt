[Verse 1]
Make our escape
You're my own papillon
The world turns too fast
Feel love before it's gone
It kicks like a sleep twitch
My papillon, feel love when it's shone

[Refrain]
It kicks like a sleep twitch

[Chorus]
Darling
Just don't put down your guns yet
If there really was a God here
He'd have raised a hand by now
Now darling
You're born, get old and die here
Well that's quite enough for me
We'll find our own way home somehow

[Verse 2]
No sense of doubt
Or what you could achieve
Well I've found you out
I've seen the life you wish to leave
But when it kicks like a sleep twitch
You will choke
Choke on the air you try to breathe

[Refrain]
It kicks like a sleep twitch

[Chorus]
Darling
Now just don't put down your guns yet
If there really was a God here
He'd have raised a hand by now
Darling
You're born, get old and die here
Well that's quite enough for me, dear
We'll find our own way home somehow
How, how?

[Refrain]
It kicks like a sleep twitch
It kicks like a sleep twitch

[Chorus]
Darling
Just don't put down your guns yet
If there really was a God here
He'd have raised a hand by now
Darling
Oh, you're born, get old and die here
Well that's quite enough for me, dear
We'll find our own way home somehow

[Refrain]
It kicks like a sleep twitch

[Outro]
It kicks like a sleep twitch
