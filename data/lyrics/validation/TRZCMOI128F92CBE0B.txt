Half cocked and fully loaded
Not even trying to sugar coat it
You're aimed to me
But you're shootin' blanks
And it doesn't hurt thanks but no thanks

But it's a matter of time
Till you get yours, and I get mine
It might not be me
But you're gonna answer to
Somebody - Revolver

You've got one foot in your mouth
And one foot in the grave
You were diggin' a hole
And now you're diggin' a cave

But it's not gonna be so funny anymore
By the time you wake up
Sobered up and sore

But it's a matter of time
Till you get yours, and I get mine
It might not be me
But you're gonna answer to
Somebody - Revolver

I left my comebacks at the door
I didn't know what I was in for
You're deeper than you've
Ever been before
You're deeper than you've
Ever been before

You've got one foot in your mouth
And one foot in the grave
You were diggin' a hole
And now you're diggin' a cave

But it's a matter of time
Till you get yours, and I get mine
It might not be me
But you're gonna answer to
Somebody - Revolver

Revolver
