Little Boy Lost, he sits so high in his chair
Wondering where now
What now and who will care
Now he's out discovering secret pathways to some pirate's hidden treasure
Back at home, the heat is on as night falls
And the cold outside is biting
Right down to his young bones
Will he ever come home?

There's a little boy lost
Call out the army
There's a little boy lost
Start up the inquiry

Appeal to the neighbors you never appealed to before
You're dragging your heavy hearts
All around town, door to door
While out of town, the party's on
The search is out, not taking any chances
They're beating 'round the bush
But if they look, they're all just false romances
Why should they bother at all?
They never bothered to call for the

Little boy lost
Call out the army
There's a little boy lost
Start up the inquiry

The boys in blue will work for you
They'll bring him back, dead or alive

Little Boy Lost is now Little Boy Blue in the lake
It's the last place you will look
You're hoping that he's still awake
They've got their wet suits out
Their cheque books out
Just start swimming in your tired eyes
But when the morning comes
They'll find you waking
Shivering from the night's lies
How could you do this to me?
Sit lit on the TV
They just keep telling me

There's a little boy lost
Call out the army
There's a little boy lost
Start up the inquiry

There's a little boy lost
Call out the army
There's a little boy lost
Start up the inquiry
