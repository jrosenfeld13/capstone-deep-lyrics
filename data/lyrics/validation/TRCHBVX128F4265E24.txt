It's not like before, baby You can't come running back no more...
And talk to me When it cuts like a knife
You just talk to me baby When the feelin' ain't right
Who do you think you're foolin' not me
September rain is fallin'
I see you on the street just passin' by
And though your lips are smilin'
I can see the coldness in your eyes
So hell is what you've been through
I never thought I'd see you 'round here no more
Now you need someone to talk to
Just like before
You only talk to me When it cuts like a knife
You just talk to me baby When you hurt deep inside
Who do you think you're foolin' not me
You had to have it your way
From you that was a promise and a threat
Now you look for consolation
Just remember what you give is what you get
The hardest part was changin'
I was holdin' on the dreams from yesterday
I used to be here waitin'
Here's what I say
You only talk to me
When it cuts like a knife
You just talk to me baby
When the feelin' ain't right
Who do you think you're foolin' not me
