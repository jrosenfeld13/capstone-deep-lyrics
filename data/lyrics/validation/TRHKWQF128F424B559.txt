I'm dreaming tonight
Of a place that I love
Even more than I usually do
And the home I know
Is a long way back
I promise you

I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love-light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

(I'll be home for Christmas)
(You can count on me)
(Please have snow and mistletoe)
(And presents on the tree.)

Christmas time will find me
Where the love-light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams...
