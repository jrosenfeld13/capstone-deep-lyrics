[Verse 1]
I look down and dread
The air is red, your back is bad from days of strain
Ah Its time now
Here we go
Your on your leg like
My new nest egg today

[Chorus 1]
One time
Two times
You can rob, cheat and steal from another
One time
Two times
You can go and confess to your mother
One time
Your mine

[Verse 2]
Kick back in the black seat stack, Yeah
Everything always go go goes my way
Dont doubt me know
For I am law and what you do is what i say

[Chorus 2]
One time
Two times
You can rob, cheat and steal from another
One time
Two times
You can go and confess to your mother
One time
Two times
You can rob, cheat and steal from another
This time
Your mine

[Bridge]
Hey hey
Give me your money
Hey hey
Give me your money
Hey hey
Give me your money
Hey hey
Give me your money

One time
Two times
You can rob, cheat and steal from another
One time
Give your money
Give me all you god damn money
Hey

[Outro]
Hey hey
Give me your money
Hey hey
Give me your money
Hey hey
Give me your money
Hey hey

Give me your money
