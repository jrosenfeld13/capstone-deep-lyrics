I would fight to stay your execution
I would die to save your soul
We've seen trouble and fiery waters
And the evil locked to our hearts of gold
Yeah, sometimes you're an abomination
And yeah sometimes you bury me

In our grave composition

Rotten fingers hold my hand
Promise me that in the end
We will find our true love again

I have seen all that we've broken
I've seen the frays
I've felt the shame
But I've seen magic fly from your fingers
And show us life shines more than we'd believe
And yeah sometimes you're an abomination
And yeah sometimes you bury me

In our grave composition

Rotten fingers hold my hand
Promise me that in the end
We will find our true love again

In our grave composition
