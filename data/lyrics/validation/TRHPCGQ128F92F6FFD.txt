Hey baby.I know you want me
Whether it's wrong or right
I wanna be with you tonight
So get your things and let's go
Let's get outta here

How you doing baby?
You looking good
And if you could stay with me
Oh girl.I know you would.Yeah
I haven't seen you
In a long time
But the love you gave to me
Is constantly on my mind

Ooh Aah Oh Oh
Ooh Aah Oh Oh
Ooh Aah Oh Oh
Ooh Aah Oh Oh

There's nothing wrong
With the way I feel
Because your loving
Oh girl.It gives me chills.Mmm Hmm
You wouldn't be smiling
If I was wrong
So bring your loving
To me all night long

I like it when you moan
You say....

Ooh Aah Oh Oh
Ooh Aah Oh Oh
Ooh Aah Oh Oh

Wanna love it
Wanna touch it
Let me lay your body down
Wanna feel it
Wanna taste it
Let me hear you make a sound
Wanna love it
Wanna touch it
Let me lay your body down
Wanna feel it
Wanna taste it
Let me here you make a sound
