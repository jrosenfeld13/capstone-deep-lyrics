(The Waterboys' cover of "Don't Bang The Drum")

Here we are in a special place
What are you gonna do here
Now we stand in a special place
What will you do here
What show of soul are we gonna get from you
It could be deliverance, history
Under these skies so blue
And if I know you you'll bang the drum
Like monkeys do

Here we are in a fabulous place
What are you gonna dream here
We are standing in this fabulous place
What will you play here
I know you love the high life, you love to leap around
You love to beat your chest and make your sound
But not here man, this is sacred ground
With a Power flowing through
And if know you you'll bang the drum
Like monkeys do

Not to pass on by
Not to walk on by
Not to try
Just to let it come
Don't bang the drum
Just let it come
Don't bang the drum
