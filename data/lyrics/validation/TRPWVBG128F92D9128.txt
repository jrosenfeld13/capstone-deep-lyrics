It has come to light
It will ease your mind
When you realize that the source of all fears
Is present as faith and old as mankind
No more wars, no more pain, no more loneliness
And no worries
Another circle around the sun
We're still making history

And all the sleepless nights
Won't make me know better
And all the cried tears
Won't awake the wisdom in me
That all hurts, the more we search
The less we'll see
Another circle around the sun but
We're still making history

How much more anger will be awaken
Who's got the power to choose?
How many more lives needs to be taken
How much do we gain? How much do we lose?
There's no freedom that asks for no alert
No wisdom of war that won't weaken the earth
How much more time we'll live in vanity before
All, all of us is hurt

Hope is a sun light before the dawn
Peace is a battle never truly won
Seems like the end of the game now
Unbearable wish to escape as far as we can
Absolution's a mask for the troubled times
All victories are cover stories for the hidden crimes
Why don't we give the peace another chance?
We're still making history
