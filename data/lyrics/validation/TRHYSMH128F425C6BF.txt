Do you remember
To feel invincible
When there is trouble
It was us against the world

We kept running
Running through the night
Chasing the sun
Till anything felt right

Can you save me now
I get lost up in the clouds
Can you save me now
You were my gravity

Can you save me now
When your ground drops down
I get lost up in the clouds
Save me now
You were my gravity
Now my world is shattering
You were my gravity
You were my gravity

You left me out there
With no one but myself
In an open field
For the lightning to strike me down

I was the moon
You were the sun
I can't seem to shine
Now that you're gone

Now I'm out of orbit
Because you left without warning
Are you somewhere better now

Can you save me now
I get lost up in the clouds
Can you save me now
You were my gravity

Can you save me now
When your ground drops down
I get lost up in the clouds
Save me now
You were my gravity
Now my world is shattering
You were my gravity
You were my gravity

When you ran away
Thought it would never be the same
You're the nightmare that never end
If I would do it again
I wouldn't change a thing
Cause it made me who I am
And now I'm shattering

Can you save me now
When your ground drops down
I get lost up in the clouds
Save me now
You were my gravity

Can you save me now
When your ground drops down
I get lost up in the clouds
Save me now
You were my gravity
Now my world is shattering
Now my world is shattering
You were my gravity
