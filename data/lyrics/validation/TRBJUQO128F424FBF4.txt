All those years passing by through my mind
Waiting for a sign that I'll be alright
For a while I'll keep fighting real hard
My fist clenched, when will the next punch make contact

I am scared of slipping
But you'll just keep holding tightly to me
Try to make me believe
I must take this bag off my back
It's dragging me down
Where I won't be found

Then I see you
Looking the same way
Looking so lost too
And you reach out for my help
Then I see you
Looking the same way
Looking so lost too
And I'm holding out my hand

I hear a voice and it sounds so familiar
It's calling to me
But I cannot speak
I feel so cold but there's no getting warm
I reach out but there's nothing to hold

Then I see you
Looking the same way
Looking so lost too
And you reach out for my help
Then I see you
Looking the same way
Looking so lost too
And I'm holding out my hand
