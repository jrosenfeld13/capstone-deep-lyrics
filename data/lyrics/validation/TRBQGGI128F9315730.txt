We all need love
We all need a place where we belong
We all need to reach out, reach out, and touch someone
We all need faith
We all need a road to travel on
Look to the power of love, that power will make you strong

And when I'm falling - my backs against the wall
I'm going calling - I will have no fear at all

'couse
We all need love
We all need an angel on our side
We all need a perfect day to dry those tears we've cried

We all need a dream
We all need a promise in our heart
We all need a guiding light to lead us through the dark
We all need help
We all need someone to understand
We all need a brother or sister walking hand in hand

And when I'm falling - my backs against the wall
I'm going calling - I will have no fear at all

'couse
We all need love
We all need an angel on our side
We all need a perfect day to dry those tears we've cried

Nobody's judgment should take your voice away
No ones religion, can teach you what to say, what to say

We all need love
We all need a place where we belong
We all need to reach out, reach out, and touch someone
We all need faith
We all need a road to travel on
Look to the power of love, that power will make you strong

We all need love
We all need an angel on our side
We all need a perfect day to dry those tears we've cried

We all need love
We all need an angel on our side
We all need a perfect day to dry those tears we've cried
