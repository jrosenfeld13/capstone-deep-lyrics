[Verse 1]
Every thing about you says I should probably get going
But everything about me says I wanna stay right here
Everybody's got some things better off not knowing
That's just the same as us, might be a little dangerous
Heard somebody say you're a little heart breaker
Sooner or later I'll wake up and you'll be gone
The way that you got me feeling right now
Got me thinking about how I don't care if they're wrong
You can break my heart all night long

[Chorus]
No, you, you're a little bit trouble
No, you, baby that's just fine
Because you're easy on my mind
Easy on my mind

[Verse 2]
Whoever said nothing good ever happens after midnight
Has probably never seen how the moonlight shines on you
Let's take a little chance and our romance dancing in the headlights
Let's lose track of time, with your skin on mine

[Chorus]
No, you, you're a little bit trouble
No, you, baby that's just fine
Because you're easy on my mind
Easy on my mind

[Bridge]
The way that you got me feeling right now
Got me thinking about how I don't care if they're wrong
Because you can break my heart all night long

[Chorus]
No, you, you're a little bit trouble
No, you, baby that's just fine
Because you're easy on my mind
Easy on my mind
