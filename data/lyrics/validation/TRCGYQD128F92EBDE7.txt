I love to hear you talk
I love the things you say
I love to hear you speak - my name
I love to spend my time
Holding your hand in my mine
Watching the world go by
Through the wonder of your eyes

There's a secret in your soul - mia
How i love to watch you grow - mia
Like a flower you unfold - mia
Beautiful mia, beautiful mia

Don't ever be afraid
You have a gentle heart
You're safe because you're loved - so much
You never come too hard
You never have to cry
I hold you in my arms
And sing a lullaby

There's a secret in your soul - mia
How i love to watch you grow - mia
Like a flower you unfold - mia
Beautiful mia, beautiful mia

You are my angel
Heaven knows - mia rose

There's a secret in your soul - mia
How i love to watch you grow - mia
Like a flower you unfold - mia
Beautiful mia, beautiful mia
