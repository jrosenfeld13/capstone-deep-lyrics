Figure of divine perfection
No one's loved with more affection
Soul to soul we've breathed
Oh, I won't let The Fates succeed
Worried hours of contemplation
Whispered bits of conversation
Unaffected orderlies
Disinfected rooms and hallways

And if you sleep you sleep with God
And if I cry, it's for my heart
Why should i hope to make it through?
'Cause if you sleep, I'll sleep too

Jagged thorns and pretty petals
Butterflies and stinging nettles
Sunny days and nights of blackness
But where's the joy to cure my sadness?

And if you sleep you sleep with God
And if I cry, it's for my heart
Why should i hope to make it through?
'Cause if you sleep, I'll sleep too

Gleaming cars and covered faces
Teary eyes in hallowed places
Grass and granite stone
No one's been more all alone

And if you sleep you sleep with God
And if I cry, it's for my heart
Why should i hope to make it through?
'Cause if you sleep, I'll sleep too

Why should i hope to make it through?
'Cause if you sleep, I'll sleep too
