[Verse]
[BOTH:] I love you, yes I do
I love you, yes I do
[Her:] I know you know it's true
From the way I look at you
[BOTH:] I need you, yes I do
You need me, I need you
[Him:] Darling, darling, I'm never blue
Since I first laid eyes on you
[Her:] I guess you knew it
[Him:] From the start
From the way you took my heart
You're the one girl that I adore
[Her:] Darling, you're my guiding star
I must be wherever you are
You set my world, set my world on fire

[Outro]
[BOTH:] I love you, yes I do
Much kissing, holding too
[Him:] I'm yours my whole life through
[BOTH:] I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, yes I do
[Backing:] Yes I do
