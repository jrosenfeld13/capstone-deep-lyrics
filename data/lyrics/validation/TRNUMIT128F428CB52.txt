Boiling the unctuous beverage
A scalding contemptible concoction
Ladle the swill in your oral cavity
For a pyrochemical reaction

Blistering and burnt, your lips give away, as you ingest the acid
The bitter taste effuses away, papillas boiled to pyogenesis
Enamel is subject to ardent decay, smelting out the dentin
A swollen mouth leaves you with nothing to say
