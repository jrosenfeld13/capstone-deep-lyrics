The warden threw a party in the county jail
The prison band was there, and they began to wail
The band began to-jumping, they began to swing
You should have heard the knock down jailbird sing
Let's rock, everybody let's rock
Oh everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the jailhouse rock

Number forty-seven said to number three
You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see
I sure would be delighted with your company
So come and do the jailhouse rock with me
Let's rock, everybody let's rock
Oh everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the jailhouse rock, yeah!

Spider murphy played on the tenor saxophone
Little joe was blowin' on a slide trombone
Drummer boy from illinois was crash-a-bam boomin'
The whole rhythm section was the purple gang

Let's rock, everybody let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the jailhouse rock

Listen
Dancing to the jailhouse rock
Dancing to the jailhouse rock
Dancing to the jailhouse rock
Dancing to the jailhouse rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the jailhouse rock, yeah!

Everybody in the whole cell block
Dancing to the jailhouse rock

C'mon
Dancing to the jailhouse rock
Dancing to the jailhouse rock
Dancing to the jailhouse rock
Dancing to the jailhouse rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the jailhouse ...
