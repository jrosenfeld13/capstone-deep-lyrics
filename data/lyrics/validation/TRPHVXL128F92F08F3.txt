[Hook]
Leave the world behind you
Leave the world behind you

[Verse]
People, can you hear me?
Here's a message that I'm sending out
I've got the answer to all your problems
And tonight I'll be singing it loud

Just surrender yourself to the rhythm
With your hands up in the sky
Feel the energy deep inside your system
And leave this world behind

[Hook]
Leave the world behind you
Leave the world behind you
Leave the world behind you
Leave the world behind you

So leave this world behind

Leave the world behind you
Leave the world behind you
Leave the world behind you
Leave the world behind you

Leave this world behind
