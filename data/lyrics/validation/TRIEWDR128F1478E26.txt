Can somebody tell me what's going on now
It seems like there's so much confusion in the streets
I heard somebody ask, "what happens when you die"
That's when I stepped in...
And said "If you don't know my God,"
"you might go to a place that's burning hot"
Then we got into this big argument
That didn't make no sense, but it is what it is
(I'm just trying to get you to see truth)
(there's no truth in what you do);
You're simply blind to the fact
That I really got your back
And I ain't gonna lie to you
If you think you're living right
I'm the one to tell you
That you gotta get it right
If you think that you gon' make it
Just 'cause you so nice
I can tell you no other way
'cause it is what it is
If you think you're living right
I'm the one to tell you
That you gotta get it right
If you think that you gon' make it
Just 'cause you so nice
I can tell you no other way
'cause it is what it is
Now we can sit here and talk about this (all day long)
And chances are you would (still be wrong)
You can't tell me nothing (about this)
Trust me, man, you can't get into heaven (without this)
It's like I was born on a (pew)
I know what to (do)
I really don't understand why it's so hard for (you);
I will continue every night to (pray)
But the fact is you gotta be saved
(I'm just trying to get you to see truth)
(there's no truth in what you do);
You're simply blind to the fact
That I really got your back
And I ain't gonna lie to you
Don't make your time on this earth (worthless)
I just want you to see that you need to be (serving)
I'm not telling you to live like me
I'm just (birthing) something in your soul
And trust me it's (worth it)
(I'm gon' say it again)
Don't make your time on this earth (worthless)
I just want you to see that you need to be (serving)
I'm not telling you to live like me
I'm just (birthing) something in your soul
And trust me it's (worth it)
