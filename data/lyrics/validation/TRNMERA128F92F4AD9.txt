This was never your decision to make
I still have love, but its in a different place
You may consider this my fall from grace
But had nothing to do with how I was raised
You did all that you could, with the best intent
But some things in this world
They just aren't meant to grow
Some seeds they just don't ever grow

Im still your child, but not one of
Im still your child, but not one of
Im still your child, but not one of
Im still your child, but not one of his
