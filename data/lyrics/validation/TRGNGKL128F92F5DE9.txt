[From a PSA recorded for MTV before its music video aired]
In the past there were arguments for and against casual sex. Then it became a question of morality. These days it can be a question of life or death. It's as simple as that. And this song is not about casual sex

Theres things that you guess
And a'things a'that you know
Theres boys you can trust
And a'girls that you dont
Theres little things you hide
And little things that you show
Sometimes you think youre gonna get it
But you dont and thats just the way it goes

I swear I wont tease you
Wont tell you no lies
Dont need no Bible
Just look in my eyes
Ive a'waited so long baby
Now that were friends
Every mans got his patience
And heres where mine ends

I want your sex
I want your love
I want your sex
I want your sex

Its playin' on my mind
Its dancin' on my soul
Its taken so much time
So why dont you just let me go
Id really like to try
Oh, Id really love to know
When you tell me youre gonna regret it
Then I tell you that I love you but you still say no

I swear I wont tease you
Wont tell you no lies
Dont need no Bible
Just look in my eyes
Ive waited so long baby
Out in the cold
I cant take much more girl
Im losing control

I want your sex
I want your love
I want your sex
I want yoursex (sex! ow!)

Its natural, its chemical (lets do it)
Its logical habitual (can we do it?)
Its sensual but most of all
Sex is something that we should do
Sex is something for me and you

Sex is natural, sex is good
Not everybody does it
But everybody should
Sex is natural, sex is fun
Sex is best when its one on one
One on one

Hoo ah (sex) Im not your father
Hoo ah (sex) Im not your brother
Hoo ah (sex) talk to your sister
Hoo ah (sex) I am a lover
Hoo ah (sex)
Hoo ah (sex)
Hoo ah (sex)
C-c-c-c-c-c-come on
