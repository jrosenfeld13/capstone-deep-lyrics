[Verse 1]
Lead in me and me in water
Dangling in my world
I swallowed too much oily water
Now it's slipping down my spine
In a sense of self in decline
Growing fat on sound
It's only an early morning dream
And the whole world will be alright

[Verse 2]
My head hurts with suspicion
I'm coming home sometime
I've swallowed too much oily water
It's slipping down my spine
A sense of self in decline
I'm lying on my back
It's only an early morning dream
And the whole world will be alright
