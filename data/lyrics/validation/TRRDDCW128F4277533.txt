Now There's A Sweet Young Miss
That I Like To Kiss
Listen Folks And Hear Me
She's Not My Only Love
I Have Another Love
And She'll Just Have To Share Me
But She's Five Foot Tall
Work Boots And All
But She Already Knows
She Has Some Competition
In A Composition
Called The Polka On An Old Banjo
Polka On The Banjo
Make That Five-String Hot
Polka On The Banjo
Give It All You've Got
Polka On The Banjo
Watch Them Fingers Go
Of All The Songs I Guess
The One That I Love Best
Is The Polka On An Old Banjo
And You Start To Bend
She Takes You By The Hand
And I Begin To Swing Her
She Knows I'd Never Miss
A Chance To Steal A Kiss
Or Dance The Polka With Her
But I Don't Speak A Word
Once I Have Heard
The One Thing I Love So
She's Caught In The Middle
Playing Second Fiddle
To A Polka On An Old Banjo
Polka On The Banjo
Make That Five-String Hot
Polka On The Banjo
Give It All You've Got
Polka On The Banjo
Watch Them Fingers Go
Of All The Songs I Guess
The One That I Love Best
Is The Polka On An Old Banjo
Polka On The Banjo
Make That Five-String Hot
Polka On The Banjo
Is That All You've Got?
Polka On The Banjo
Watch Them Fingers Go
Of All The Songs I Guess
The One That I Love Best
Is The Polka On An Old Banjo
