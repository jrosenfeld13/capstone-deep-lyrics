Coming down on a Monday
Another work day
When I saw her the first time
She tapped her nails on my window
She said let's go
And we left it all behind
Here she comes, down the street
Mountain high, river deep
Baby baby come on
Before the summer is gone
Black haired girl
Wanna go for a ride
Just like Bonnie and Clyde
Around the world
I can never resist
My little anarchist
Black haired girl
She's a seven day weekend
She don't pretend
When she's dancin' wild and free
Her momma she was a singer
And a dreamer
But her dad's a mystery
Baby baby come on
Before the summer is gone
Black haired girl
Wanna go for a ride
Just like Bonnie and Clyde
Around the world
I can never resist
My little anarchist
Black haired girl
Going down to the beaches
On the river city line
Where I tell her my secrets
She says I'll keep them with mine
Here she comes, down the street
Mountain high, river deep
We'll be M.I.A
In the USA
My black haired girl
Gimme gimme a kiss
With your apocalypse
At the end of the world
Baby baby be my
Miss American pie
Black haired girl
Come down on a Monday
Another workday
Looking out of my window
Where did she go
