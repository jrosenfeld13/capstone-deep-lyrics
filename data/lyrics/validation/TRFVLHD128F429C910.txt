This song is a gateway song
Why don't you sing a long long
To the gateway song
Brings us up nicely to the harder stuff
And once you get hooked
You can't get enough

This son is a gateway song
It's a numero uno sign along
Opens up nicely to the harder stuff
And once you get hoked
You can't get enough
This song is the gateway song
