Lilly was standing on the corner
She waited there in front of the store
She waited there for an hour or two
Who knows, she maybe waited more
But nobody showed
So Lilly, she decided she go
And she rides tonight
In Lilly's Daddy's Cadillac

Lilly's man's name is Dan
He works in the back of a dirty book stand
His best friends know his mind
But nobody knows his plans
And nobody else
Knows what Danny boy got to sell
Lord, he rides tonight
In Lilly's Daddy's Cadillac

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
There was whispering in the dark
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Yes, you're gonna get hurt someday
Well, it's not so hard to understand
It's the same old story
About supply and demand
He tried to go straight
He tried hard to learn
How you gonna do
When people beg to be burnt

In Lilly's Daddy's Cadillac

Now there was whispering about a meeting
But who they gonna meet this time
I heard someone got greedy, Lord
Pulled out a pistol
Said, "Lilly and Danny baby
It's the end of your line"
You know the shots rang clear
But no one was able to hear
Lord, they died that night
In Lilly's Daddy's Cadillac
