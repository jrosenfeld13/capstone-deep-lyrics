Well who's gonna shoe your pretty little foot
Who's gonna glove your hand
Who's gonna kiss your red ruby lips
And who's gonna be your man

Is that you Reuben
Is that you Reuben
Where have you been so long? X2

Well papa's gonna shoe my pretty little foot
Mama's gonna glove my hand
Sister's gonna kiss my red ruby lips
And I don't need no man

Well I don't need no man, no
I don't need no man
Sister's gonna kiss my red ruby lips
And I don't need no man

Well the longest train that I ever saw
It was 90 coaches long
And the only man that I ever loved
He was on that train and gone

Chorus

Oh where'd you get that hat you wear
And that coat you got so fine
Well I got my hat from a railroad man
And my coat from a worker in the mine

Chorus

Well Reuben made a train and he put it on the track
Run it to the lord knows where
Reuben made a train and he put it on the track
Run it to the lord knows where
