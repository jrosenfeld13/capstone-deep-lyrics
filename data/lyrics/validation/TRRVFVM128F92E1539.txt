I am the one you will call the destroyer
The messenger of my disgrace (I am my own disease)
You sit on your throne of compassion
The judges will fall as we all go marching so helplessly on

We came this far to tell the good to
Shine light so I can see your eyes
Shed your light on me

What? Is this your only obsession?
Destroy everything you create?
(I am my own disease)
You, the God of the broken and wretched
The judges will fall
I am my own disease

I carried the weight of this burden I watch as they all go away
It's not just a dream it's a nightmare
I carried the weight of this burden I watch as they all go away
It's not just a dream it's a nightmare

We came this far to tell the good to
Shine light so I can see your eyes
Shed your light on me

We will fall to ruins if we don't bury disguises that we've made
We will see the finish if we would carry ourselves to the end of the race
The judges will fall
I am my own disease
I am my own disease
