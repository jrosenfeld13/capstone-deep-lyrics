You let it slip right through your fingers
You let the moment disappear without a trace
Now the photograph is faded
And the smile you wore seems sadly out of place

Some nights
When you feel that you're the only one who bleeds
Reach out
When you doubt the love you really need

It's criminal
To possess the key to life yet be so cynical
To deny the possibility, it's criminal
To let the chances of a lifetime
Pass you by

Every picture tells a story
I hear the sound of desperation in your voice
It's a broken road to glory
And we lose if we refuse to make a choice

Someday
When you least expect it love will come to you
Reach out
When you let the pressure get to you

It's criminal
To possess the key to life yet be so cynical
To deny the possibility, it's criminal

To let the chances of a lifetime
Pass you by

Tell your heart to stop the stalling
S.O.S. your life is calling
Spread your wings for all the world to see
Illuminate your darkened corners
Celebrate each brand new morning
Be the light we all were born to be

Some nights
When you least expect it love will come to you
Reach out
Don't let the music catch you cryin'
To let it catch you cryin'

It's criminal
To possess the key to life yet be so cynical
To deny the possibility, it's criminal
To let the chances of a lifetime
Pass you by

Don't let it pass you by
(Don't let it pass you by)
It's criminal
(Don't let it slip through your fingers)
Don't let the music catch you cryin'
(Don't let it catch you cryin')
