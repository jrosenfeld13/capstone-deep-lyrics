I guess it was yesterday when I found you there
Alone I wait for you, I feel I should
Maybe just possibly you'll turn your head
And look at me the way the angels would
I'm thinkin 'bout you and I could burn these times
And let our souls act out the only way
Under the running sky, colors fade into the night
Holding back this day

Chorus
I have lost myself in only you
Hold on through
I am the one who still burns for you, burns for you

Thinking about yesterday, the sun went down
Painted there you lie into the sea
I wish I were next to you lying there
Breathing from my heart and how I feel
We drift into a distant place, desire is the
Only one we know who feels the same
The moon is up and the sun is up
And the sky bleeds over our hearts, push this day, push this day

Chorus
I have lost myself in only you
Hold on through
I am the one who still burns for you, burns for you

I guess it was yesterday, complete me
Surround me in your eyes, you hold me still
You got to believe the hands of love have pushed us
Turned us upside down into the sun, into the sun, right now

Chorus
I have lost myself in only you
Hold on through
I am the one who still burns for you, burns for you

Chorus
I have lost myself in only you
Hold on through
I am the one who still burns for you, burns for you, burns for you, burns for you
