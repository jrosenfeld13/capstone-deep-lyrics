Jim's been married a hundred years
Though it feels that way sometimes
Three kids and a lovely wife
They're the reason he survives
A few thousand acres about fifty kilometres from town
A lot of sun and not much rain
But its like that all round

Oh Jim you work so hard
You work too much
You're letting go of your marriage
And your kids are growing up

So take the time, to watch your kids
Go climbing that old gum tree
Or running round the washing line
And kiss your wife, she's still the same girl you met that balmy summer's night
I know it can get hard in this busy life
But you've gotta take the time

Well this old place is going well
But there's always jobs to do
A fence down, sheep to crutch
The bookworks overdue
And you're wife keeps saying
Can't we take a trip to town

Oh Jim drop the strainers
Drop the phone
What's the point of working hard
If you're ending up alone?

Time is money, blah blah blah
