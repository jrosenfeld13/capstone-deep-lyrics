[Verse 1: Matt Bowman]
I could love you for a day
But then I'd hate you for a week
If there was something you could say
I'd tell you what to speak
To make things go much easier

[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
For you and me
I think you know
The time has come for it to go no where
'Cause we just don't get along now
And I'd rather be alone tonight
Than have you here so we could fight again
'Cause we just don't get along now

[Verse 2: Matt Bowman]
I've stopped answering your calls
Because you're getting on my nerves
This is it once and for all
You'll get what you deserve
And things will go much easier

[Chorus: Matt Bowman]
For you and me
I think you know
The time has come for it to go nowhere
'Cause we just don't get along now
And I'd rather be alone tonight
Than have you here so we could fight again
'Cause we just don't get along now
And things will go much easier
For you and me
I think you know
The time has come for it to go nowhere
'Cause we just don't get along now
And I'd rather be alone tonight
Than have you here so we could fight again
'Cause we just don't get along now
