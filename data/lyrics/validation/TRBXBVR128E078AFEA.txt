Six o'clock in the morning
Still sitting here pouring the drinks till they're gone
We did everything together
We would have done it forever
How did we go wrong
I know that what goes up comes down
I didn't know you hit the ground

Why'd ya have to give it up
You were just a little girl
I'll never look into your blue eyes
Fly high Michelle

We did it just for a good time
A misunderstood time
We lived with a fear
I wish we still could have done things
Not overhung things
I wish you were here
And now I'll live a life of could have beens
Until new life begins

Why'd ya have to give it up
You were just a little girl
I'll never look into your blue eyes
Fly high Michelle

I'll say another prayer tonight
And I'll see you in the light

Why'd ya have to give it up
You were just a little girl
I'll never look into your blue eyes
Fly high Michelle
