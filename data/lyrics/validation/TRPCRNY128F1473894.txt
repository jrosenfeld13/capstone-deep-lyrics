(Lance Aston)
The first time I saw you
You smiled
I was sold
I tried to be cool
But the heat took hold
And the fool in me jested
Just to hide my fears
Don't want another broken heart
Don't want to cry another tear
But I just can't get you out of my mind
From the first time I saw you
Something exploded
And I just can't get you out of my mind
I don't want to need you
Just want to be with you again
So tongue tied and twisted
The walls are up
So I keep away
Oh from your sensual touch
No need to hurry
Only fools rush in
Oh we got plenty of time
For this love to begin
But I just can't get you out of my mind
From the first time I saw you
Something exploded
And I just can't get you out of my mind
I don't want to need you
Just want to be with you again
So what happens now
Do you want love
I can tell by the look on your face
Any minute you'll be walking away
I want you to stay
I just can't get you out of my mind
From the first time I saw you
Something exploded
And I just can't get you out of my mind
I don't want to need you
Just want to be with you again
Just can't get you out of my mind
Just can't get you out of my mind
Just can't get you out of my mind
