[Chorus]
Lay awake at night
Oh so low, just so troubled
Cannot get a job
Laid off and I am having double trouble

[Verse]
Hey hey, to make you have got to try
Baby, that is no lie
Some of this generation is millionaires
I cannot even keep decent clothes to wear

Laugh at me walking
And I have no place to go
Bad luck and trouble has taken me
I have no money to show

[Chorus]
