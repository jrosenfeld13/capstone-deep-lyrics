I'm far away from here if you look inside
You have a vacant stare Say what you tryin' to hide

CHORUS

Gonna take my time 'Cause yer wastin' mine
And yer not too kind And I don't think it's funny ... no

I sit and watch the sky It sometimes talks to me (talk to me)
You say you'd rather die You say what's on the T.V. ... T.V

CHORUS - CHORUS

(This is where we sing a bunch of "Ahhs")
I see a child cry Then calm a storm of tears
You say it's all a lie You say what's he got to fear
(He's just a little kid ... !)
