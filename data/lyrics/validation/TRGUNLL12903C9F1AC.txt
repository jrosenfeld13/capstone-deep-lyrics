Now this is somethin' from back in the day
I'll always remember Run DMC
And all the good times
That we had on the beach
Stealing sips from a paper cup
And making out in the sand
Maybe I'm dreaming
Can you tell me
Do you remember
The summers that lasted so long
June 'til September
Was our time to sing all the songs
Do you remember
All of us together
As we grew up under the sun (Back in the day, back back in the day)
I'll always remember everything we do
Rockin' the eighties blastin' K-R-O-Q
I remember Culture Club
The Clash, and Men Without Hats
Seems kind of funny right now
But it's taking me back
We'd always sing along
And laugh out loud at ourselves
Don't want to stop dreaming
Can you tell me
Do you remember
The summers that lasted so long
June 'til September
Was our time to sing all the songs
Do you remember
All of us together
As we grew up under the sun (Back in the day, back back in the day)
I want to rewind every time
'Cause the words have so much meaning
They were there when nobody cared
Always knew what I was feeling
Stay tonight don't leave me reminiscing
All I do is wind up missing you
Are you missing me
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Are you missing me (Na na na na na na)
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Do you remember
The summers that lasted so long
(Back back in the day, back back in the day)
Do you remember
All of us together
As we grew up under the sun
