Forged by the crow-mage from shards of darkness
Honed by the half-breed to vorpal sharpness

Behold!
The bastard's blade...

Bane of the demon lord
Slayer of the spider-priests
Spiller of the silver blood

Fragments of bore infused with purest steel
A warrior's hand and a wizard's mind to wield
Killer of Lor avenging the accursed
Gathering knowledge, quenching deadly thirst
