Open the door
Please let me in
Into a fantasy world
Let the ride begin
Where the sun is high
And the wind lays low
Where the air smells sweet
And the music flows

Open the door
Please let me in
Into the majestic world
That love can bring
Let me walk down the road
Let me explore
To discover those places
Every soul adores

Or I'm gonna walk every road
Sail every sea
I'm gonna climb every mountain
Till I find the key

Open the door
Please let me in
Into a mystical world
Let the ride begin
Let it go, we will flow
Through highs and lows
Then we'll wait to see
What the future shows

Open the door
Please let me in
Into the marvellous world
That love can bring
Let me pick all the fruits
Hanging from the trees
Let us, settle down
To dig into the feast
