Now summer's gone where summers go
And careless talk costs lives
What went wrong will history show
In the dust of Babel lies?
And I'm looking for a light on the rails
And I'm looking for a light on the rails
An old friend came and it was fine
So much news to share
She told of hers and I told of mine
The years hung in the air
And I'm looking for a light on the rails
And I'm looking for a light on the rails
All that's holy
All that's good
Hold them to you now
The ones you love
Who know your soul
Hold them to you now
And we are drawn to poetry
When the world goes mad
The dragons slain by you and me
In younger dreams we had
And I'm looking for a light on the rails
And I'm looking for a light on the rails
All that's holy
All that's good
Hold this to you now
The ones you love
Who know your soul
Hold this to you now
And I'm looking for a light on the rails
And I'm looking for a light on the rails
On the rails
