How many more times can the Grateful Dead play their set
How much longer before they o.d. and we see them dead
Long greasy hair, tye-dyed shirt wearing waste
All part of the Sixties retro-fashion parade
Tune in and tune out, what a fuckin' waste
Peace, love, and anarchy, give me a fuckin' break
CHORUS
The Sixties are over, now they 're good and dead
Stop your Sixties retro, bell bottoms make us sick
Fill your head with drugs until your mind just can 't think
Stuff your fuckin' drugs, it's beer I 'd rather drink
Look at your hair, look at our stare, you 're the victim tonight
The boot goes in, it 's just a sin, your friends are nowhere insight
CHORUS
