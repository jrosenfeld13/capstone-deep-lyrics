Oh God, oh God
It's not fun being you anymore
Oh, God, oh God
It's not fun in your shoes anymore
Stop casting your spells
Will you please go to hell
You know you've really got a big mouth
Sit down, cross your legs
Free your neck from your head
And hear me out, out out

You never give me
You never give me
You never give me the time

Whole
Whole
Eat yourself whole

Oh no, oh no
I hear the sounds of the radio
Oh no, oh no
I saw a dinosaur through it's window
I turned out at midnight
Turned off the light
Added some words to the 20th centruy
I dug you a grave
Wrote in the sky
"I love the drug, the drug you sold to me"

You never give me
You never give me
You never give me the time

Whole
Whole
Eat yourself whole

The whites of your eyes are not white
And your head it never fails to keep growing
I could try to keep it at bay with 6 inch nails
With your room it's so sad
With cancerous walls and trampoline floors
Are you happy being whores?
Cause I can see through you like a cellophane door

Whole
Whole
Eat yourself whole
