Welcome to this faithless masquerade
Take your place and see what is new
The winds of change will take your breath away
All seems new but nothing has changed

Let the thing that you have lost your faith
Let them believe that you have gone astray

Break the silence and leave all fears
How can we survive. Hiding all inside
Break the bonds wipe away all tears
Don't live in the shadows
Don't let the fool you

Staring into all these hollow faces
They're burning you, just walk away
Not a single one should make you stay
Make the change and go all the way

Let the thing that you have lost your faith
Let the believe that you have gone astray

Break the silence and leave all fears
How can we survive hiding all inside
Break the bonds wipe away all tears
Don't live in the shadows
Don't let the fool you

Break the silence and leave all fears
How can we survive hiding all inside
Break the bonds wipe away all tears
Don't live in the shadows
Don't let the fool you
