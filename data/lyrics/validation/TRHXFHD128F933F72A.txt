It's hard to believe, I didn't see this coming
You're Devil's Spawn, in a Saint's disguise
Look at you now, you're taking control
You think you're so high, but I see you falling

Look at the World, Son of Satan
It's not yours to take, cos I am in your way

You're a silver-tongued serpent, with eyes of fire
The strength of a demon, and a head full of lies
You strike at my heart, your eyes are ablaze
You're wanting it all, but you have nothing

Look at the World, Son of Satan
It's not yours to take, cos I am in your way

You strike at my heart, your eyes are ablaze
You think you're so high, but I see you falling

Look at the World, Son of Satan
It's not yours to take, cos I am in your way
Look at the World, Son of Satan
It's not yours to take, cos I am in your way
