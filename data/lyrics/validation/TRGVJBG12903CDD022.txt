Sensual awakening
Numbing feeling's dead
Conception's romanticised
Synthetized broken heart's to bled

Without emotion
Your heartstring's played
Strummed and severed
To the tune of a tragic serenade

A tragic chorus

Without emotion
Your hearstrings break
Snapped and severed
To the tune of a tragic, sad-cliche

No love lost
When all is said and done
There's no love lost

The low cost of loving
Amorous travesty
Human frailties and weakness are easy prey
How your poor heart will bleed

Without emotion
Your heartstring's played
Strummed and severed
To the tune of a tragic serenade

No love lost
When all is said and done
There's no love lost

No love lost
When all is said and done
There's no love lost

No love lost
When all is said and done
There's no love lost
