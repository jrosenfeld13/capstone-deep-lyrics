(Spoken)
Boy that's some ugly woman, I'm telling you!
That woman's so ugly, she can draw a blister on a brick, man
But she's all right! You seen a REAL ugly woman?
I've seen your wife!
That's her! That's her!
You know she was so ugly when she was a little girl
Huh?
Her father used to take her to work with him every morning
And I say, why do you take the poor kid out every morning that early
You know? He says, She's so doggone ugly he hate to kiss her goodbye
So he take her with him, you know
Some ugly child!
(Sung)
You's some ugly woman, but you's all right with me
Yeah, you is some ugly woman, but you's all right with me
You're the woman I love and that is sweet enough for me
She's the woman that I love, she takes my appetite
She's the woman I love, she takes my appetite
She the sweetest woman I ever seen in my life
She got a face like a monkey, hair like a teddybear
She got a face like a monkey, hair like a teddybear
She the ugliest woman that I ever seen anywhere
(Instrumental break:)
Go on, get that ugly woman for me now, call her up!
Lord have mercy
She got pretty smooth skin, just like a elephant hide
She got pretty smooth skin, just like a elephant hide
When you see that ugly woman, honey you know that I ain't lyin'
An ugly woman, boy!
