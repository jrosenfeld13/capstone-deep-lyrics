Don't don't ask me to explain
I've already told you
More than words could ever say
Every time I hold you
When you're happy when you're sad
Through the good times and the bad
No matters what's you do I'm hanging on and on and on
Refrain:
And if an angel come my way I'm gonna try to catch her if I can
Do anything to get her to stay, baby that's the way I am
You can call me stupid, say I should give you up but I can't do it
That's the way I am
Don't, don't ask me why I stay, don't say I could do better
Hey it's just a little rain, and we can't get much wetter
Let me hold you when you cry, just let go and close your eyes
No matter what you do I'm hanging on and on and on
[refrain]
That's the way I am
Never mind the time and place
As long as you still want me I'll stay
I'm hanging on and on and on to you
[refrain]
That's the way I am
