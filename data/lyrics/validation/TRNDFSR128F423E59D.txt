Your surprises wear disguises
All of your truths masquerade around on hallows eve
So I'll never know what you show to unfamiliar faces
So impressed by you undressing
Did you take his hand aside from love
The truth would break me in two
I'll never know what you show to unfamiliar faces

This is the voice that's scared to hear those names
So this is the void, we'll leave a hole in space

I'll take it kindly if you blindly
Holding inside the thoughts I have
Inquisitively wondering
I'll never know what you show to unfamiliar faces

But this is the voice that's scared to hear those names
So this is the void, we'll leave a hole in space

I'll never know what you show to unfamiliar faces
I'll never know what you show to unfamiliar faces
Unfamiliar faces
