I have a life
It is good, you might say
My husband is best
When he works, when he plays

The maids clean the house
They take care of the kids
But I know that somehow
There is much more than this

And we, we ladies in blue
The ripples spread out
From the stones that you threw

We, we ladies in blue
Concentric circles
From the ladies in blue

Some people might say
But I dont need to think twice
I could be like some others
And be content with my life

But she never sleeps
Never seems to need rest
How does she do it?
And still look her best?

And we, we ladies in blue
The ripples spread out
From the stones that you threw

We, we ladies in blue
Wider and wider
From the ladies in blue

Ladies in blue, ladies in blue, ladies in blue
Concentric circles
From the ladies in blue

Ladies in blue, ladies in blue, ladies in blue
Wider and wider
From the stones that you threw

The world isnt perfect
And it never may be
But every little bit helps
Some from you, some from me

Ladies in blue, ladies in blue, ladies in blue
Concentric circles
From the ladies in blue

Ladies in blue, ladies in blue, ladies in blue
Wider and wider
From the stones that you threw
