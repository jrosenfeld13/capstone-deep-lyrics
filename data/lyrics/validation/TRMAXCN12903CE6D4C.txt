Another time, another space
Mark my words, I can't fake another day of sadness
My heart's been taken whole
And this dream is getting old
Yet I'm searching every part of me, baby
The tables' turned, that's for sure
Guilt and honor have crossed into what's left for holding on
You know things are getting hard
When we see them as they are
Can these qualities remain the same?
Woman, feeling good about the choice I made
In so deep there ain't no judgment day
If there was I think I'd be okay
Woman, please release me from your hold tonight
Burning bridges in the morning light
I'm just heavy on this city life
Oh, I tried to tell you
But it's too late to find out
Hanging on the back of my will
Waiting for the moment to be still
Save your problems baby
Save your problems for the world
Then they might go away, go away
I've been contemplating
Keeping it complicated
For when you wanna turn the day in
And I just wanna turn the day around
I know it hurts a lot
But I gave what I got
Now I'll be getting on my way
Woman, feeling good about the choice I made
In so deep there ain't no judgment day
If there was I think I'd be okay
Woman, please release me from your hold tonight
Burning bridges in the morning light
I'm just heavy on this city life
Tried so hard to love you, but I keep on running
Burning bridges in the morning light, morning light (repeat to fade)
