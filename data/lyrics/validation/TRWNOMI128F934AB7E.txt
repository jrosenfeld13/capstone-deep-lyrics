The old man sits there and startes
As my heart grows fondly aware
The vagrant is me at an elde; age

Shed some of my life for me
There's so much I just can't wait to see
It's not joy my son to live in a cage

What news do you bring?
Oh my Future of fortune and eternity
Rejoice for life is ahead, or is death what you sing?

You must detour your route
Your coming is not full of loot
Loveless, you barely stay alive

Diseased, threatened all the time
Declared sick in the mind
Mortalitys best you shall not survive

Halt, don't you speak
Oh your message is negative and so depressing
An old man who has lost his sense and continues
To go on to pretend

I am you
Oh you may not believe but you must know I'm you
I came with these words to tell about the hell I went through

Oh there's no reason to live
Well they'll take everything you have to give
But if you go on your way all I do is pray
And long from now you'll remember this day

No reason to live
Take everything you have to give
But if you go on your way all I can do is pray
And long from now you'll remember this day when I said
I've got no reason, no reason to live
No, no, no, no, no
