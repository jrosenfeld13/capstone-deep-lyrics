[Verse 1]
(Hey, baby)
You've really got my tail in a spin
(Hey, baby)
I don't even know where to begin
But, baby, I got
One thing I want you to know
Wherever you go tell me 'cause I'm gonna go

[Chorus]
We found love, oh
So don't fight it
Life is a rollercoaster
Just gotta ride it
I need you, ooh
So stop hiding
Our love is a mystery
Girl, let's get inside it

[Verse 2]
(Hey, baby)
You've really got me flying tonight (flying tonight)
(Hey, sugar, ooh, ooh)
You almost got us punched in a fight
(that's all right)
But, baby you know
The one thing I gotta know (know, know)
Wherever you go tell me 'cos I'm gonna show

[Chorus]
We found love, oh
So don't fight it
Life is a rollercoaster
Just gotta ride it
I need you, ooh
So stop hiding
Our love is a mystery
Girl, let's get inside it

[Bridge]
Listen...
Can't you feel my heart (feel my heart)
Can't you feel my heart (feel my heart)
Can't you take my heart

[Chorus]
We found love, oh
So don't fight it
Life is a Rollercoaster
Just gotta ride it (all night long)
I need you, ooh
So stop hiding
Our love is a mystery
Girl, let's get inside it

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh)
Don't fight it, fight it, fight it
(Na, na, na, na, na)
Don't fight it, fight it, fight it
(Na, na, na, na, na)
Don't fight it, fight it, fight it
(Na, na, na, na, na)
Don't fight it, fight it, fight it
(Na, na, na, na, na)
Don't fight it, fight it, fight it
(Na, na, na, na, na)
(Na, na, na, na, na)

[Outro]
Love is a mystery girl
Let's get inside it
Na, na, na, na, na
