I never know the truth baby
I never understand you
Precious love
I found you
In these endless days
They are driving me crazy
And I fell in love with you
I took you
But you weren't there for the taking
If I said to you
I understand you
Love is your truth
Love is your truth

I'll never know the truth
If what you gave me was real
Hey, I belong to you in the sunshine
In the sunshine
To hold you in the moonlight
There's endless fire in your bones
You'll kiss and love
And you're catching birds in my room

I never know the truth babe
These endless days without you
Are driving me crazy
But you fill in love
And you felt alone
And you said you were broken
How was I to know?
That you were broke
That we were one
That you were alive
How was it love on our side?
Or was it my misunderstanding?
My misfortune to..?

I'll never know the truth
I'll never understand you
That's why still today I'm caught up in you

I'll never know the truth
I'll never understand you
That's why still today I'm caught up in you

I never knew the truth babe
Never knew what you gave me was real love

I'll never know the truth
I'll never understand you
That's why still today I'm caught up in you

I never know the truth baby
I never understand you
Precious love
I found you

Love is your truth
Love is your truth

I could have sworn love was on your side
