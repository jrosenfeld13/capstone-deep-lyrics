Well the sun has fallen
From the western sky
House lights flicker on
As I travel by
On this lonely road
I am far from my lover
Oh, my lover's eyes
They are blue and gray
Like the changing tides
In half moon bay
And she fills my heart
Like the wind in an open sail
She's my song in the evening
A clear voice
That calms me in the dark
Let this lonely road
Take me home to my lover
There's a chill tonight
The late year lies down
While the crickets call
Outside my hotel room
By a firelight
She is waiting for me
She's my song in the evening
A clear voice
That calms me in the dark
And I belong there beside her
Where the waves break
Blue beneath the stars
Let this lonely road
Take me home to my lover
