Oh let the sun beat down upon my face
Stars fill my dream
I am a traveller of both time and space
To be where I have been
To sit with elders of a gentle race
This world is seldom seen
Th' talk of days for which they sit and wait;
All will be revealed
(REFRAIN)
Oh baby I've been flyin' yeah, mama, ain't no denyin'
Oh yeah, I've been flyin' ain't no denyin', ain't no denyin'
Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Whose sounds caress my ear
But not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear
Yeah ,Yeah
Lingala munoko ya ba coco na ngai
Tango ba zalaki ko yemba ba zalaki ko sepela
Neti ngai sikoyo
Na zali ko yemba nzembo oyo
Fungola matoi na yo malamu yoka awa
Tika ko sala biloko pamba pamba
Tango mosusu o si o mona ndoki
Kasi ko banga te yaka epai na ngai a ko kanga yo te
Misu na ngai ba mona biloko mingi
Neti mboka wana batu mingi ba kufa
Ba zalaki mayele mingi te
Ba zalaki pe batu malamu te neti yo
Kasi yaka epai na gnai
O ko ngai na misu ya batu misusu
(REFRAIN)
Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Heed the path that led me to that place
Yellow desert screams
My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon;
I will return again
Sure as the dust that floats high in June
When movin' through Kashmir
(REFRAIN)
