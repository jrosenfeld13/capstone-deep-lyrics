I never knew just what to do
When I came to life and all those promises
Always earned every word that came along the way
Now I know that what I sow, will always be the way things really just grow
Forever now, please show me how
To fight these feelings, they're still reeling

(Chorus:)
No longer will I have to rewind the past
Cause I've come to grips with it, (Yeah)
No longer will I carry this weighted mask
Now I face the day with no shame

I've always tried to live the life
Now looking back, and it doesn't seem right
How I lived, to never give
And always take what wasn't mine
In discreet, could never keep a glimmer in my soul of something more
No longer I will sit and die, for something I don't even really care for

(Chorus)
Yeah

No longer...

(Chorus)
No longer
No longer

Now I face the day, with no shame
