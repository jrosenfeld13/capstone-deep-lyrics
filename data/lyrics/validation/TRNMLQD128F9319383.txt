To dissect the mind impaled of visions a delusional
State from one which one neglects
Incise the flesh with delicate precision
As to not disrupt such artistry

To dominate a field of iniquity undeserving of many
One must realize a painful demise deeds of tranquility
Inflicting misery, an instrument of morbidity thrust deep on you
Conflicted desires will transpire justify what's right
Impaled upon a structure dear to you
Blood soaked hands drip insistently
Organs deemed venemous to you
Surgery of impalement

The blood drips from my hands
Your flesh is warm upon my face
Impaled with a collection of sickness
To desire that what you recieve

Impaled upon a structure dear to you
Blood soaked hands drip insistently
Organs deemed venemous to you
Surgery of impalement
