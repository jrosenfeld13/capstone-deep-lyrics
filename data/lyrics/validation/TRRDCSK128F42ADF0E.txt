[Verse 1]
I can't believe it's happening again
This side goes so never ending
We're always back at this space it seems
And it's all because you're unhappy with me

[Chorus]
'Cause no matter what I do
It's never enough for you
I break my neck but you don't see
I blame myself, I think it's me
No matter what, what I say
You never feel differently
You want me here
But you don't like what you see
When you look at me, at me

[Verse 2]
We've grown apart, happened some time
I'm here your there
Our souls no longer intertwined
And you hate the woman that I've become
But I'm strong and I've grown
Don't want to be molded by anyone

[Chorus]
'Cause no matter what I do
It's never enough for you
I break my neck but you don't see
I blame myself I think it's me
No matter what, what I say
You never feel differently
You want me here
But you don't like what you see
When you look at me
'Cause no matter what I do
It's never enough for you
I break my neck but you don't see
I blame myself, I think it's me
No matter what, what I say
You never feel differently
You want me here
But you don't like what you see
When you look at me, at me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Look at me, at me

[Bridge]
Just take a look, baby
I won't be changing
I like who I am
I can't live for you
'Cause I can't see myself changing
I like who I am
I can't live for you

Look at me, at me
Look at me, at me
Look at me, at me

[Chorus]
'Cause no matter what I do
It's never enough for you
I break my neck but you don't see
I blame myself, I think it's me
No matter what, what I say
You never feel differently
You want me here
But you don't like what you see
When you look at me
'Cause no matter what I do
It's never enough for you
I break my neck but you don't see
I blame myself, I think it's me
No matter what, what I say
You never feel differently
You want me here
But you don't like what you see
'Cause no matter what I do
It's never enough for you
I break my neck but you don't see
I blame myself, I think it's me
No matter what, what I say
You never feel differently
You want me here
But you don't like what you see
When you look at me
