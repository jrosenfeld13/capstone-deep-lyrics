I endure these ruptured thoughts
Heartsick forlorn
Wait for the sin to rot
Decayed and torn
Walk down this path again
Walk down this path again
Will your heart ever mend

Bury me, walk away
Thoughts unspoken
Bury me, walk away
Fear is choking

Fall towards grace
Choose a path of innocence
Feel his embrace
Walk down this path again
Now is time
Walk down this path again
Your heart will mend

Bury me, walk away
Thoughts unspoken
Bury me, walk away
Fear is choking

Shattered life repaired
Shattered life repaired (Shattered life repaired)
Shattered life repaired

Bury me, walk away[x2]

Bury me, walk away
Thoughts unspoken
Bury me, walk away
Fear is choking

Bury me, walk away
Thoughts unspoken
Bury me, walk away
Fear is choking
