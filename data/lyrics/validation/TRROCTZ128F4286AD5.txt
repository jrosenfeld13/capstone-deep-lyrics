City jungle x8

ozina:
Somebody's watching me
I hear them whispers all around
I need to find my love
But what I hear is just weird sounds... (just weird sounds)
Somebody screams (scream)
Some people fight some people run
I need to find my love... (find my love)
But what I hear it just weird sounds
I hear some #%!@&'s in my head

City jungle x4

Now am I mad
I think I saw her once or twice
But she's not there any more
Though I won't forget her eyes... (forget her eyes)
Them whispers still in me
Weird thoughts are goin' through my mind
I need find my love
In the city jungle. All right

Chorus:
I can't see no light
My life's goin' by
Can't waste my time
Gotta stop to fihgt for love for life
So let's give a try to fight for better life
Love is all around
Don't waste you're time

City jungle x4

Tomson:
I can't think
I can't sleep
That jungle's scarrin' me
I get sick of that shit
I just wanna get out of there
There no sense to live, no sense to feel
Nothing here is real
Fake smiles (fake smiles)
Fake tears (fake tears)
Fake happiness (fake happiness)
Fake fear (fake fear)

I just wanna know what makes that place so strange to live in
I just wanna know how people made a jungle from a city
I just keep hope alive that love will still have a meaning
That me myself and I will find the feelin' All right

Chorus:
I can't see no light
My life's goin' by
Can't waste my time
Gotta stop to fihgt for love for life
So let's give a try to fight for better life
Love is all around
Don't waste you're time x2
