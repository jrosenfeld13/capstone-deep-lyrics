I understood the concept
I think I always
Knew what it means
But I needed a word to put on it
I needed a name to spell

I got the meaning
But missed an alphabet
To write it down
And when I read it again
I'm sure that it is

The translation of love
In my own language
The translation of love
For me
You're the translation of love

Then you give me your letters
Then I write them down
And when I say your name
I know that it means

The translation of love
In my own language
The translation of love
For me
You're the translation of love
