Bittersweet memories
Of a love we had before
Blinded by sanity
What's behind the crimson door

What happened to my eyes
Incapable of seeing signs
There's just one miracle
That's left of this love

After the rain
I still see heaven crying
After the rain
I still feel no relief
'Cause everything we used to be
And used to feel
It all becomes so frightening real
After the rain

Rainbow skies turned to grey
Ever since we lost our smile
Innocence gone astray
Since the day we said goodbye

What happened to our dreams
Aborted in this dried out stream
There's just one miracle
That's left of this love

After the rain
I still see heaven crying
After the rain
I still feel no relief
'Cause everything we used to be
And used to feel
It all becomes so frightening real
After the rain

After the rain
I still see heaven crying
After the rain
I still feel no relief
'Cause everything we used to be
And used to feel
It all becomes so frightening real
After the rain

After the rain
