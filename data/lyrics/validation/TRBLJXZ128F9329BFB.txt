Well, I like, I like, I like, I like, I like, I like, I like, I like, I like, I like, I like
The hallway ceiling
It's just four feet wide
With a plastic mountain
Or that looks like...

They cut me up, they cut me up, they cut me up, they cut me up, they cut me up
At the medical school
They cut me up, they cut me up, they cut me up, they cut me up, they cut me up
At the medical school

I couldn't tell you that number
Or what his face looked like
He was a raving customer
What he might like
What he might like, like, like, like

They put me in, they put me in, they put me in, they put me in, they put me into
The seamless mixer
They put me in, they put me in, they put me in, they put me in, they put me into
The seamless mixer
