It's December 20-somethingish
So put a lot of stuff under a tree (okay)

Let's hit the dope spot
I ribbity ribbity ribbity ribbity rap a lot
I'm the number 1 rapping dude (okay!)
I like money, bitches, and eating food

So throw your Christmas gifts in the air
And wave them all around like you just don't care!
And jiggle your (honk-honk) it's a Christmas song
I hope I get a lot of stuff that I can pawn (ohh)

In the season for joy and love
And I would love to give you a hug
