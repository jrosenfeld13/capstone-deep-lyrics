"It's about to go down"

[Powda]
Take it off
Take it off
Take it off
Take it off
Take it off (take it off, c'mon)
Take it off (take it off, girl, take it off)
Take it off (c'mon)
Take it off (it's about to go down)

[Pancho Villa]
Believe me, Crystal and whipped cream, time to feed me
Can I get a dance, table dance, ugh, please me
The sex is off the heezee
Love it when you sleazy
Come on girl, easy
Take if off don't tease me
How do you like it?
Do you get excited?
If I pull it out will you promise not to bite it?
In the champagne room, sittin' in a dark corner
She got her hands in my pants beggin' me to bone her
Hot like fire, yet just sweet as candy
You get me in the mood, boo, in yo thong panties
Nobody, does it like you
You know you look yo best when you dancin' in the nude

(Chorus)
[Powda]
Take it off (take it off, c'mon)
Take it off (take it off, take it off)
Take it off
Take if off (take it off, take it off, take it off, off, off)
Take it off (take if off, c'mon)
Take it off (take if off girl)
Take it off (c'mon)
Take it off (take it off, take it off, take it off, take it off)

[Powda]
Everybody wanna see, so its time to take it off
Show 'em how these girls be poppin' down here in the south
Got the dollars in they hands, baby what you waitin' fo'?
Take it off, make the cash while you work it on the floor
Bouncin' to the beat, c'mon gotta make the green
Got these niggas all excited diggin' a hole in they jeans
But she a freak in disguise, you can see it in her eyes
Baby spread 'em and display, what's in between them thighs
All these guys, they wanna get her
But she goin' for the one wit the biggest figures
Now let me see, to the VIP, wit a bottle Don P
Seductively, takin' all his currency

(Chorus)

"It's about to go down"

[Tommy G]
I love to break a bitch
That's the way I live my life
Stayin' major in the mix in the dark of the night
Conversation, man, it's a hell of a thing
Have the realest bitches doin' all kinds of things
Gettin' freaky on the stage, suckin' dick in the car
Makin' cash sellin' ass, turn a hoe to a star
This is a playa situation, just like sellin' them keys
Cuz baby girl keep it hot, come on nigga don't please
I keep the hottest hoes fuckin' wit no clothes on
And when my team wrecks the spot you better hold on
Makin' money stayin' big, things are always on
A Lone Star Ridin' pimpaholic wit my hoes strong

(Chorus)
