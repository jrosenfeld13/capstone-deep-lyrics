My head just isn't right
I sleep an hour every night
The rest is only fits and starts
It's tearing me apart
Curled in the sheets
Burned by the heat
That's what I need
To slow down the speed

The bed is smoking like a furnace
My head begins to turn, it's
Like a big weight
Dragging me down
Please baby please baby
Down on my knees baby
Sometimes the cure
Is worse than the disease baby

Oh, why am I wired this way?
Every time I try to check it
Something comes along to wreck it

You really want to sing the blues?
Well, go and watch the evening news
The rest is only neuroses, psychoses
Holy moses!
