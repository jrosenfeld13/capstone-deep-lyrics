Ricky and Gar, well they took it too far
They didn't make it, they didn't make it

Chrissy and Stage, though they made no mistakes
They didn't make it, they didn't make it

Whether living with hope or at the end of the rope
It isn't written in the stone when the future's unknown
And though some do atone
Through no fault of their own
They fall through the cracks
And get left by the wayside

God willing, It's the last time I'll say goodbye
God willing, I'll see you on the other side
It's the last time I'll put my arms around you
The last time I'll look into your eyes
I've come here to put my arms around you
And say one final goodbye
Yeah, I'll see you on the otherside

Chicky and Fly, they were really good guys
They didn't make it, they didn't make it

Laura so sweet and Kenny right in his sleep
They didn't make it, they didn't make it

So as you walk out the door
Take care, and always be sure
That the ones in your life
Know that you love them tonight
Fate has one guarantee
And we all must agree
That the best laid plans
May all change by tomorrow

God willing, It's the last time I'll say goodbye
God willing, I'll see you on the other side
It's the last time I'll put my arms around you
The last time I'll look into your eyes
I've come here to put my arms around you
And say one final goodbye
Yeah, I'll see you on the otherside
