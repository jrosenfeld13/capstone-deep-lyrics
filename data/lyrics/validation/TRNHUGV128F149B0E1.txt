When the hard day come from the magical lamp
That you touch there
And you can't get home
It doesn't compare
You got all love and war
Now we're all uptight with fever inside
Let's get out
And if we can't do that, what do you say?
Let the past pass away

Into the dawn of another way
Of looking at the people we've become
To a place where you played when you were young
On the cool breeze behind the sun

When the genes dissented and the hammer fell
Reliving
The power of the feeling that got you so down
Will you ever forgive me?
It was a perfect light and I wanted to say
I love you
When the floods comes down, I'll carry you
And let the past pass away

Into the dawn of another way
Of looking at the people we've become
To a place where you played when you were young
On the cool breeze behind the sun
On the cool breeze behind the sun
On the cool breeze behind the sun
On the cool breeze behind the sun
