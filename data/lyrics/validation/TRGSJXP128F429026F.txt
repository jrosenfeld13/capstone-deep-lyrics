I knew a girl with sad blue eyes
But at the feast I lost my psychic prize
I did forget what the tarot maid did say
I burn today
I burn today

Our house was filled with many birds
She said to me, "I can understand their words"
The land will shake so run away
I burn today
I burn today

Yes, today I will burn
For the times I did not learn

She said, "Have fun, its time has come
Hold my heart strings and have yourself a strum."
No nevermore, this song will we play
I burn today
I burn today

And as I drank in old Paris
She laid her cards just to see what she would see
Down by the water you'll find your happy days
I burn today
I burn today

Yes, today I will burn
For the times I did not learn

I ran so fast into the North
No snow on me, and so you said thenceforth
I let snow fall on frozen yesterday
I burn today
I burn today

And if my head is hanging down
I feel her arms and her legs are all around
And we make love beside the waterway
I burn today
I burn today

Yes, today I will burn
For the times I did not learn

Behold the rose of Jericho
How many lives I really do not know
Though with the rain I know it will return
Today I burn
Today I burn
