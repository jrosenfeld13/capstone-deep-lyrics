We set the sails and hauled our oars
Heading for the gods alone know where
In the whale's wake we left our shores
Heading for the gods know where

We steered the winds that Asgard sent
Heading for the gods alone know where
And the waves did rave without relent
Heading for the gods know where

So heave me heroes, heave and haul
Valhalla hails thee, one and all

Clash of salt-crests, foamed and flew
Heading for the gods alone know where
Hail and hoar-frost hacked our crew
Heading for the gods know where

The Albatrosses in the sky
Heading for the gods alone know where
Like Valkyries where the vanquished lie
Heading for the gods know where

So heave me heroes, heave and haul
Valhalla hails thee, one and all

No time to dream of your fond farms
Heading for the gods alone know where
Nor to dwell upon your lady's charms
Heading for the gods know where

The mighty Midgard-serpent's tail
Heading for the gods alone know where
Did writhe, and rise up like a flail
Heading for the gods know where

So heave me heroes, heave and haul
Valhalla hails thee, one and all

The seas turned black as boiling tar
Heading for the gods alone know where
And shadow-shrouds obscured our star
Heading for the gods know where

Then maggot-mouths munched on our hull
Heading for the gods alone know where
As we drifted in this lurid lull
Heading for the gods know where

So heave me heroes, heave and haul
Valhalla hails thee, one and all

And as if this destiny was planned
Heading for the gods alone know where
Eventually we sighted a land
Heading for the gods know where

So heave me heroes, heave and haul
Valhalla hails thee, one and all
