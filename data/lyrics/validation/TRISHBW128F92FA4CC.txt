(Written by Julia Fordham)

I've been down to the river
And seen the other side
I have cowered in the corner
Without a place to hide
I've been lost and forsaken
And sworn 'd not get through
But I must have done something right
To be here loving you
I must have done something right
To be here loving you
I have searched
For the whole truth
And seldom have I lied
I have been the silent witness
To all the tears've cried
There are things that I have done
I wish I could undo

Chorus

There were times when i had lost my
Will to carry on
I'm glad I found the strength to
So I could sing this song
There are things that I have done
I wish I could undo

Chorus
