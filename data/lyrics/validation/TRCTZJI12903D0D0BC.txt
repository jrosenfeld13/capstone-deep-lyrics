You woke up and felt
As if you'd never been awake
With no beginning and no end
Inside, there's no reason to pretend
That all you need is time
When times run out
Today you are an ocean
Today your currents are strong
So let the waves be a saving grace
And bring you to where you belong
You belong
You're hopeless and tired
You've been drifting further from
The ones who stayed to fight the tide
And there's no reason to believe
That time is on your side
When times run out
Today you are an ocean
Today your currents are strong
So let the waves be a saving grace
And bring you to where you belong
You belong, you belong
You belong, you belong
Today you are an ocean
Today your currents are strong
So let the waves be a saving grace
And bring you to where you belong
Today you are an ocean
Today your currents are strong
So let the waves be a saving grace
And bring you to where you belong
Today you are an ocean
(You belong)
Today your currents are strong
(You belong)
So let the waves be a saving grace
(You belong)
And bring you to where you belong
Let the waves be a saving grace
And bring you to where you belong
