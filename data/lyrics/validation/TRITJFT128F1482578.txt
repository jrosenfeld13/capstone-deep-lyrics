Now watch this!
I want all of the masses them come do culture move
This collaboration here with no ego trip
WE don't bring no badness no fuss or fighting with it
And educational why don't you keep up with this
Time to pay attention to the conscious lyrics
May try!
What them a do man an' what them ah chat about
With the youth them after nine o' clock can't stay out
A government man he must have run up on the mob
Hear ! What him ah say will happen without a doubt
He cannot think for himself, copy the American
To build up the tension bring the idea to Britain
Now ! When the law is done he'll have his satisfaction
Then it will be as life for the old man, young man and woman

Who goes there?
The original Asian Dub Foundation
Alongside Navigator on the M- I- C
Up here reality we talk and strictly culture
Culture upon the move this year
HeyHeyHeyHeyHeyHeyHeyHeh ....Asian Dub Foundation
HeyHeyHeyHeyHeyHeyHeyHey ....

Kingdom 'gains kingdom and nation 'gains nation
Time we are living up in them revelation
'Cos when you take a stock of the whole situation
The elders them ah poison the young generation
Instead of them ah trying to build a firm foundation
Them ah bring human beings down to pure degradation
With chemical warfare and nuclear weapons
Starvation, Sufferation, Dehumanisation
The world population have to take precautions
From pollution, corruption, deception, infection
Politicians can claim that they've got the solution
But deep in up them hearts them have a wicked intention
To rinse out poor people with tax and inflation
Segregating the massive, separating the nation
You think ah, so it goes before you answer a question
You better watch yourself before they bug you're not madman

All of the masses inside the place do culture move
All of the masses inside the place do culture move
All of the masses inside the place do culture move
All of the masses all of the public do culture move
Sooner the culture on on the move...
Coming Deeder!
This one for all microphone entertainers
You have the tool you have the voice so be an educator
Stop! Stopping the slackness and come on, tell them proper
Encourage the massive to become their own creator
Because in ah this time you have to understand
That the government man's going to try and mash up on the plan
So direct the crowd and give them navigation
Believe you'll me get a wicked reaction
Show 'em on!
HeyHeyHeyHeyHeyHeyHeyHey beyond the navigator!
HeyHeyHeyHeyHeyHeyHeyHey
Sound of the culture upon on the move
You gotta be conscious in everything that you do .....
Asian Dub Foundation WILL!
