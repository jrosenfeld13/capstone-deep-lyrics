He was a great balloon maker
The balloons were never known for speed
There's no way you'll get sweet
You asked me to waste some time
Come out to see the sun
You're all we've got
But I said I think there's more of them like us
And he said you might be right
We'll find them in time somewhere
I had a dream

He was a great balloon maker
Then they outlawed all balloons
He packed up and put his things away
He asked me to waste some time
Come out to see the sun
You're all we've got
But I said I think there's more of them like us
And he said you might be right
We'll find them in time somewhere
And I had a dream

Come out to see the sun
You're all we've got
But I said I think there's more of them like us
And he said you might be right
We'll find them in time somewhere
