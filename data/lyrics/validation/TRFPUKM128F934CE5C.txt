Baltimore seems a long, long way from home
But it's right in my backyard
It's everything that I've escaped
It's everything that I hate

You can't keep me here now
It's never been my home
And I don't want to live here anymore
This town just makes me so ill

I don't wanna be your little boy
I can't take one more day alone
This place just doesn't seem real
And I'm so sick and tired here

So send me off to bed now
I won't be coming home
Too much humidity in this heat
So many bills I have to pay

And all my friends are on Prozac
And all my friends aren't home
And all my friends are on Prozac
And all my friends are alone
