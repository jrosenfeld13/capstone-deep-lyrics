I don't give a damn what those people say
Cane smoke can't be good for you day after day
Every year at harvest time black smoke fills the sky
Get the kids and bring 'em home and make 'em stay inside

From Thibodaux to Raceland
There's a fire in the fields
All the way up the bayou from LaFourche to Ibercville
Dirty air dirty laundry dirty money dirty rain
Dirty dark in the morning when they're burning the sugar cane

Christmas on the bayou
Midnight come and gone
Driving by the sugar mills
All the lights are on
Parking lot full of trucks
Inside the furnace glows
Everybody's working overtime
It's a good job even though

From Thibodaux to Raceland, there's a fire in the fields
All the way up the bayou from LaFourche to Ibercville
Dirty air dirty laundry dirty money dirty rain
Dirty dark in the morning when they're burning the sugar cane

First came the sugar cane then came Thibodaux
King sugar built this town, cane paved these roads
Burn the leaves, harvest fast
That's more for the company
Nobody even thinks to ask
Nobody even thinks to scream

From Thibodaux to Raceland, there's a fire in the fields
All the way up the bayou from LaFourche to Ibercville
Dirty air dirty laundry dirty money dirty rain
Dirty dark in the morning when they're burning the sugar cane

Ashes are falling like a dark and deadly snow
All the way up the bayou and to the gulf of Mexico
Dirty air, dirty laundry, dirty money, dirty rain
A dirty deal with the devil and they're burning
Burning, burning the sugar cane
