I look into your eyes
They're such a big surprise
Made of hard-plastic cream
Deep as a space
Glowing in your face
In interlace
The touch of your hand
Makes me understand
What kind of machine you are

You are my silicon dream

You've got a nice-programmed heart
Very careful at the start
Maybe a little bit too shy
But it makes my oil pressure high
And as long as you don't lie
I don't ask why
I love your robot walk
Your synthetique talk
The way you move your lips

You are my silicon dream

You are a sweet machine
And when your eyes are shining green
This is my favourite scene

You are my silicon dream

I want to have you all my life
Would you be my robot wife
Constructing new micro-chips
Your silver skin against mine
Computing all the time
You are so fine
You turn out the light
It's a very special sight
Your radioactive brain

You are my silicon dream

You are a sweet machine
And when your eyes are shining green
This is my favourite scene

You are my silicon dream
