I'll stand here forever*
Waiting for what I deserve
I see right through you!
You're flesh with no bones!
So hollow!
So fabricated
All the efforts I put into you
Was nothing but meaningless
All I wanted was a thank you!
So fuck you!
All I wanted was a thank you!
So fuck you!
It's all or nothing!
There no in between
I will not give in
To your halfhearted try
You could never lead me in
You could never kill my dream
Give up!
Give in!
My life is costly for this
Give up!
Give in!
I won't sit here in silence
I can't help you if you don't want to help yourself
I can't save you if you can't save yourself
Save yourself!
It's all or nothing!
There no in between
I will not give in
To your halfhearted try
You could never lead me in
You could never kill my dream
Give up!
Give in!
My life is costly for this
Give up!
Give in!
I CAN'T SAVE IF YOU CAN'T SAVE YOUR FUCKING SELF!
I will not sit here in silence!
It's all or nothing!
No in between!
