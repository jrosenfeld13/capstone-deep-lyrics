Here beside her now
Like a face in a crowd
Doesn't make much sound
Like you did before and you'll do it again
Yesterday and tomorrow when we were friends

Stop pretending with me
Save me more than that
From climbing up your tree
Like you did before and you'll do it again
Yesterday and tomorrow when we were friends

Oh hey, ripped out and tore your hair
I want you know what I said
I want you to come back later
Your angels sang

I want you to know
I want you to sail
I want you to rain down letters your angels sang

You say it best
Say my name out loud
Pray the world won't hear
Pretty ballerina do yourself a favor
Come fly with me
Give me the night

Tore your hair
I want you to know what I said
I want you to come back later
Your angels sang

I want you to know
I want you to sail baby
I want you rain down letters
Your angels sang
