All right
Rock and roll, yeah

At the end of a dream
If you know where I mean
When the mist just starts to clear

In a similar way
At the end of today
I can feel the sound of writing on the wall
It cries for you
It's the least that you can do

Like a spiral on the wind
I can hear it screamin' in my mind

Long live rock and roll
Long live rock 'n' roll
Long live rock and roll
Let it live

In a different time
When the words didn't rhyme
You could never quite be sure
Then on with the change
It was simple but strange
And you knew the feeling seemed to say it all
It cries for you
It's the least that you can do
Like a spiral on the wind
I can hear it screamin' in my mind

Long live rock and roll
Long live rock 'n' roll
Long live rock and roll
I'm losing control

Long live rock and roll
Long live rock 'n' roll, yeah
Long live rock and roll
Look you

If you suddenly see
What has happened to me
You should spread the word around

And tell everyone here
That it is perfectly clear
They can sail above it all on what they've found
It cries for you
It's the best that you can do
Like a sound that's everywhere
I can hear it screaming through the air

Long live rock and roll
Long live rock 'n' roll
Long live rock and roll
Let it live, let it live, let it live

Long live rock and roll
Long live rock 'n' roll, yeah
Long live rock and roll

Banners held high with a curse and cry and it's
Long live rock and roll
Long live rock 'n' roll
Long live rock and roll
You feel it around, spread it around, make you what just should

Long live rock and roll
Long live rock 'n' roll
Long live rock and roll
Live, live, live, live

Long live rock and roll
Long live rock 'n' roll
Long live rock and roll
Let it live, let it live, let it live, let it live

Long live rock and roll
Long live rock 'n' roll
Long live rock and roll
