Wake up kids, we've got the dreamers disease
Age 14, we've got you down on your knees
So polite- you're busy still saying please

Fri'enemies, who when you're down ain't your friend
Every night we smash their Mercedes Benz
First we run and then we laugh till we cry

But when the night is falling
And you cannot find the light
If you feel your dream is dying;
Hold tight

You've got the music in you:
Don't let go
You've got the music in you:
One dance left
This world is gonna pull through
Don't give up
You've got a reason to live
Can't forget you only get what you give

Four a.m, we ran a miracle mile
Were flat broke, but hey! We do it in style
The bad rich;
God's flying in for your trial

This whole damn world can fall apart-
You'll be okay, follow your heart
You're in harms way
I'm right behind;
Now say youre mine

Fly high
What's real can't die
You only get what you give;
Just dont be afraid to leave

Health insurance rip off lying
FDA big bankers buying
Fake computer crashes, dining;
Cloning while they're multiplying
Fashion mag shoots
With the aid of 8 dust brothers;
Beck, Hanson, Courtney Love and Marilyn Manson
You're all fakes
Run to your mansions
Come around
We'll kick your ass in!

Don't let go
You've got the music in you:
One dance left
This world is gonna pull through
Don't give up
You've got a reason to live
Can't forget you only get what you give
