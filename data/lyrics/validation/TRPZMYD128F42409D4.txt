Intense Fiercing War, Insult No Tolerance
Against One Rule, To Fit 'Em All
To Keep My Hands From Moving Free
To Blur My Eyes Already Blind

The Pulse Of What We Live, The Hate We Build
Create My Shield, To Fight Them All
Inside
They See The Things They Can Not Be
To Understand They Can't Be Free
No Surrender - Still Unhurt, We Fly

We Learned The Way How To Be Real
What We Say We Live
And Go Against Inhumanity
It Keeps Me Sane To Embrace Our Will
My Saga, My Saga - Battle In The Fields Of Fear

Attack Defend - It's Never Over
My Saga, My Saga - No Regrets

Do What You Can With What You Have
It Doesn't Matter Where You Are
Do What You Can With What You Have
It Doesn't Matter Where You Are

No Surrender - Still Unhurt, We Fly

It Keeps Me Sane To Embrace Our Will
We Learned The Way How To Be Real
And Go Against Inhumanity
What We Say We Live

My Saga, My Saga - Battle In The Fields Of Fear
Attack Defend - It's Never Over
My Saga, My Saga - No Regrets
