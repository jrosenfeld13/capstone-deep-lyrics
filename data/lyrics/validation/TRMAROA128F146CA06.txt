I had me an aim and I had me a token
To deliver this letter sealed
Now I'm halfway through this trek
Halfway through this trek
Secrets with me won't stay sealed for long
If you hand me the truth
I'll spread the news, I'll spread the news
Suddenly a light came on
And it shone me a hole right through my bone
And there I could see it all and there I saw the shore
High time for me to make up
My mind after what I've seen
Then I heard a bell strike five
Heard a bell strike five
Ooh la la
