What will they bring
To our attention today?
They only feed you
With what you want to hear

I'm so sick of turning it on
I just wish I could turn it off

My eyes are blinded by
This glamour of corruption
My ears are deafened by
This voice of depression
Is this something you need
Just to make you feel alive?

Is this your cry for help?
Nobody's listening but yourself

I heard it all
I hate it all
Why still complain?
In our eyes we have seen
What needs changed

You should have seen this coming
Cause it already has
Is this something you want
Just to make you feel alive?

I heard it all
I hate it all
Why still complain?
In our eyes we have seen
What needs changed

Most of the time
I realise that we are better off...
DEAD!
Better off dead
