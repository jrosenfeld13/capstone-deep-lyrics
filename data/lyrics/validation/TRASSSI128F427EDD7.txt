When will you answer
My lonesome question
Tell me what I'm bound to do
Now that you're gone

Waitin' for that phone to ring
You left me wonderin'
Alone and pondering
My lonesome question

Remember when I said to you
Darling I think we are through
Remember when I said goodbye
You walked home alone

Now that I've thought it through
I know I still need you
Come back and answer
My lonesome question

I know I said goodbye
I know that made you cry
Darlin' I think I
Just might need you by my side

So you can answer
My lonesome question
Tell me what I'm going to do
Now that you're home

Waitin' for that phone to ring
Alone and wondering
Why did you answer
My lonesome question

I know I said goodbye
I know that made you cry
Darlin' I think I
Just might need you by my side

So you can answer
My lonesome question
Tell me what I'm going to do
Now that you're home

Waitin' for that phone to ring
Alone and wondering
Why did you answer
My lonesome question

Why did you answer
My lonesome question
