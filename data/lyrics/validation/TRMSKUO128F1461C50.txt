The only thing you've ever wanted to be was a movie star;
The only role you've ever wanted to play is the person you are, are, are...
You made a cameo appearance in the backseat of my mother's car
But I didn't know that it was to be a very small part
And it hit me kind of hard, baby...

Did I mean anything to you? Did I just play the fool?
In my heart, I guess I always knew you had more to prove...
Did I mean anything to you? How much acting did you do? Tell me?
In my heart, I guess I always knew I'd never be more than one among a few...

(Highlights, highlights, highlights...) A scene from your life...
(Highlights, highlights, highlights...) Highlights - just a good time...

Old lovers turned critics curse at you on the silver screen;
You tell 'em, "I don't give a damn what you say, long as you're talkin' 'bout me..."
All the pretty girls around you cloud your sexuality;
We've only been apart for less than a week, but you make leaving me look easy...

Did I mean anything to you? Did I just play the fool?
In my heart, I guess I always knew I'd never be more than one among a few...

(Highlights, highlights, highlights...) A scene from your life...
(Highlights, highlights, highlights...) Just a good time...

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey... Your life...
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey... Good time...

Years spent fuckin' your sister for your father's affection
Left you confused and your performance lacks direction;
So many unanswered questions...

Did I mean anything to you? Did I just play the fool?
In my heart, I guess I always knew you had more to prove... yes, you did!
Did I mean anything to you? How much acting did you do? Tell me?
In my heart, I guess I always knew I'd never be more than one among a few...

(Highlights, highlights, highlights...) A scene from your life...
(Highlights, highlights, highlights...) Just a good time...
(Yeah! Yeah!)

Oh, I'm missing you baby... Did I mean anything to you?
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey... Your life...) Missing you, baby, missing you, baby, missing you...
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey... Good time...) I'm missing you, oh, yeah...
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey... Your life...) You, baby, you, baby, yeah...
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey... Good time...)

Missing you, baby...
Missing you, baby...
