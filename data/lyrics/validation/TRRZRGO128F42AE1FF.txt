I'm gonna block it, fly like a rocket (x2)

I got this feeling deep inside
It's like a rollercoaster ride, racing through my head
It's controlled me for some time
Like a fever in my mind, i just can't let go

So many people got this feeling too
Me and you
I feel those temperatures rise
It's an urge I can't disguise
I'm gonna raise my hands up high
'Til I touch the sky

I'm gonna block it, fly like a rocket (x2)

I feel the pounding of the drums
I feel the pounding of the drums, going through my head
Like a rocket in the sky
Never stops and never tries to get back to Earth

What does it mean to be this crazy, lady?
I don't pretend to know
Well if i ever get a sign
You never know it may be time
To get back to ground

I'm gonna block it, fly like a rocket (x2)

4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ...

I'm gonna block it, fly like a rocket (x6)
