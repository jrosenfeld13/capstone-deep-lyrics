Psycho!
Running through the streets at night, Im looking for a fight
Little do you know, I have a gun and now youre gonna die
Psycho, psycho, psycho, and this is me! (x3)
Went to the barber shop to have him fix a fee
Drove a knife though his neck, another casualty
Psycho, psycho, psycho, and this is me! (x3)
Dont want no fucking wealth-share, just being gymnophied and crass
And though Im young, still beat em up, let the fucking bastard die
Psycho, psycho, psycho, and this is me! (x3)
It how I grew up, all meant to be
My parents thought Im slum

(unknown verse)
Psycho, psycho, psycho, and this is me!
