Midnight I wake up in your arms; it's so divine
Love to hold you love to feel your lips on mine
All I am, all I do it's all for you

I've never been in love like this before
You come into my world forever more
Step into the light
You feel it when you're right
It's all for you

This must be madness what a rush to have you near
Magic all around us, when we touch it's so sincere
All I am, all I do it's all for you

I've never been in love like this before
You come into my world forever more
Step into the light
You feel it when you're right
It's all for you

All I am, All I do, All I feel it's all for you
All I am, All I do, All I feel it's all for you

I've never been in love like this before
You come into my world forever more
Step into the light
You feel it when you're right
It's all for you
