Hey, what's happened to our lives?
When did you and me forget how to have a good time?
And we gotta get back to the life
That we forgot 'cos we got too much on our minds

Hey, we got to make some time for the stuff that you can't buy
And get a life 'cos you know all that serious stuff ain't no fun

Who says you can't be happy all the time?
I know but I'm still gonna try
Hey let's all go out tonight
Why don t you and me go out and have a good time?
Make our life a supernatural high
Cos we're both leaving all that bad stuff far behind

Hey there's gonna come a time you kiss it all goodbye
So get a life 'cos you ain't got a clue when that day's gonna come
Who says you can't be happy all the time?
I know but I'm still gonna try

Who says you can't be happy all the time?
Say what you like but I'm still gonna try
Who says you can't be happy all the time?
I know but I'm still gonna try
Who says you can't be happy all the time?
I know but I'm still gonna try

Who says you can't be happy all the time?
Say what you like but I'm still gonna try

But I'm still gonna try
But I'm still gonna try
