G and d here has united
Black and white here to show you how we've been delighted
The new generation since the mid nineties
Showing you how it's done if you think you are a smartie
Telling you the truth since we spotted each other
We'd like to big up our elder sister and brother
Cos they are the legend and they are like no other
Trained by the greater legend - mother and father

Now we think jump up lyrics are alright
But we'd like to broadcast a subject we know is not right
Look at us - but don't look at us in disgust
You know the reality and it's time to adjust
Think to yourself, don't be foolish about it
Fix up your brain or you'll be the target
A black man and a white woman living together

Face the facts all fascist perpetrators

And as the world is getting smaller ans smaller
We can only be getting closer and closer
Building this community of sound
Celebrating the unity we've found
And we know this is the model to follow
For all the dub children of tomorrow
As they grow under shifting skies
We'll see every nation in their eyes

Black and white here has united
We're here to show you how we've been delighted
Black and white here has united
Building this community of sound
