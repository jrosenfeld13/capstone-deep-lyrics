He met a gal from Old Kentucky she was happy and go-lucky
Sally let your bangs hang down
She called me honey-bunny just to make him spend his money
Sally let your bangs hang down
Well Sally she could land 'em she'd love them and she'd leave them
Sally let your bangs hang down
I'll find out what Sally's got makes a man think she's so hot
Sally let your bangs hang down
[ guitar ]
He saw Sally changin' clothes she was in a perfect pose
Sally let your bangs hang down
She caught me a peepin' in I don't think it was a sin
Sally let your bangs hang down
Sally she can land 'em she loves 'em and she leaves 'em
Sally let your bangs hang down I'll find out what Sally's got
Makes a man think she's so hot Sally let your bangs hang down
[ guitar ]
He saw Sally changin' clothes...
[ guitar ]
Now I'll haveta be confessin' Sally always kept me guessin'
Sally let your bangs hang down
She jumped up on a pony and she rode away with Tony
Sally let your bangs hang down
Yeah Sally she can land 'em...
