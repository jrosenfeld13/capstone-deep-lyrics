She can't slow down manic depression
Everybody gets bored once in a while
She's even breaking down at the supermarket

It takes the positive touch
It takes the positive touch

Nervous tears that cry attention
Funny lights inside her head
Drinking, dreaming - some distraction

It takes the positive touch
It takes the positive touch

She's screaming
In the night
There's no one to help her
There's no one to turn on the light

She's screaming
In the night
There's no one to help her
There's no one to turn on the light

What she thought was strange was fascination
Yesterday it rained all day long
She can't slow down manic depression

It takes the positive touch
It takes the positive touch
It takes the positive touch
