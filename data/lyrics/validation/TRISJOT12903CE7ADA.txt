[Chorus]
Come on, now youre killing me
Come on, how you leaving?
You gotta live where the sound was born
The sound that never sleeps
Where it'll shine, please stay with me
Ride the tracks of the train out of New York City
Wont you? Won't you? Won't you?

(Listen to my noise)

[Verse 1]
This is where I live
Where the rich play dead
They don't wanna be found, watch you from the crow's nest
Draw a line between the need more and homeless
So we make our own fun, doing the lockjaw laugh
It's not the promised land, it's where I come from
So I tell myself not to ever forget

[Pre-Chorus]
This is where I live
Id never trade you for the west

[Chorus]
Come on, now youre killing me
Come on, how you leaving?
You gotta live where the sound was born
The sound that never sleeps
Where it'll shine, please stay with me
Ride the tracks of the train out of New York City
Wont you? Won't you? Won't you?

[Verse 2]
I heard you're moving out west with a new flame
Heard the sun never shines, every day's the same
That should have lit you up like a cheap cigar
Why the long face, you came a long way just to play a part
Nevermind, I want another nor'easter
We need the bitter just to make the sugar sweeter
Listen to my noise, knife to both speakers
Sever all ties, wipe the shit off of your sneakers

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause this is where I live
I'd never trade you for the west

[Chorus]
Come on, now youre killing me
Come on, how you leaving?
You gotta live where the sound was born
The sound that never sleeps
Where it'll shine, please stay with me
Ride the tracks of the train out of New York City
Wont you?
Can you hear it? Can you hear it?
Can you hear it? Can you hear it, no?

[Bridge]
Ill be there at the wake and the funeral
I will help to carry you the whole way to the burial
The empty stares, coffers, and conversations ahead of you
Belly aches, nothing to satisfy the void in you
When the bell rings, in creeps the sensation
Loss of patience, at the station, east - west, split the nation
Now I don't need a handshake, blessings, or better wishes
If you trade me for the west, I choose to burn my bridges

[Chorus]
Come on, now youre killing me
Come on, how you leaving?
You gotta live where the sound was born
The sound that never sleeps
Where it'll shine, please stay with me
Ride the tracks of the train out of New York City
Wont you?
Can you hear it? Can you hear it?
Can you hear it? Can you hear it, no?

(Listen to my noise, to my noise)
