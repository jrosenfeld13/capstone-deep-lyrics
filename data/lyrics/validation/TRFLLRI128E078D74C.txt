When we want to love, we love
When we want to kiss, we kiss
With a little petting, we're getting
Some fun out of life
When we want to work, we work
When we wanna play, we play
In a happy setting, we're getting
Some fun out of life
Maybe we do the right things
Maybe we do the wrong
Spending each day
Wending our way along
But when we want to sing, we sing
When we want to dance, we dance
You can do your betting, we're getting
Some fun out of life
Maybe we do the right things
Maybe we do the wrong
Spending each day
Wending our way along
But when we want to sing, we sing
When we wanna dance, we dance
You can do your betting, we're getting
Some fun out of life
