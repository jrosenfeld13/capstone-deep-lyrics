[Verse 1]
I write to give word the war is over
Send my cinders home to mother
They gave me a medal for my valor
Leaden trumpets spit the soot of power

[Pre-Chorus]
They say, "I'm on your side when nobody is, 'cause nobody is
Come sit right here and sleep while I slip poison in your ear."

[Chorus]
We are waiting on a telegram to give us news of the fall
I am sorry to report, dear Paris is burning after all
We have taken to the streets in open rejoice, revolting
We are dancing a black waltz, fair Paris is burning after all

[Bridge]
Oh no

[Verse 2]
Enclosed in this letter, there's a picture
Black and white for your refrigerator
Sticks and stones have made me smarter
It's words that cut me under my armor

[Pre-Chorus]
They say, "I'm on your side when nobody is, 'cause nobody is
Come sit right here and sleep while I slip poison in your ear."

[Chorus]
We are waiting on a telegram to give us news of the fall
I am sorry to report, dear Paris is burning after all
We have taken to the streets in open rejoice, revolting
We are dancing a black waltz, fair Paris is burning after all

[Bridge]
Oh no, ooh

[Hook]
Dance, poor people, dance and drown
Dance fair Paris to the ground
Dance, poor people, dance and drown
Dance fair Paris, ashes now
