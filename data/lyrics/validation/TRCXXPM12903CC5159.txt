Only human..only human...human

Get out and say it's fine
You want a beat to grind
You want some words that rhyme
Want lies to make you blind

I'll break you, then I'm gone
I'll take you, I'll take you
That's what I came here for
To use you, abuse you

After all we're only human, only human
Flesh and blood, we're only human, only human
After all we're only human, only human
Flesh and blood, we're only human, only human

You've got that urge again
Those urges always win
Don't fight, it feels so right..
Let's go, we've got all night

I'll take you, then I'm gone
I'll break you, I'll break you

That's what I came here for
To use you, abuse you

After all we're only human, only human
Flesh and blood, we're only human, only human
After all we're only human, only human
Flesh and blood, we're only human, only human

You can't handle me..
I'm gonna tame you, Oh Oh
Abuse you..

After all we're only human, only human
Flesh and blood, we're only human, only human
After all we're only human, only human
Flesh and blood, we're only human, only human

Only human..human..
You can't handle me...
Only human..only ..only human
