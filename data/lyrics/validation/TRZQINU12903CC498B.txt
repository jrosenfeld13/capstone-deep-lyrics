Broken down on this, lonesome highway
Just my luck that you were, headed my way
Together...we drive off into the night
Wherever...wherever we end up will be alright

I will follow you down, wherever you go
Through every twist, and turn in the road
I will follow you down, wherever you go

The open air and the, stars above us
There ain't a thing that can, come between us
Remember...we were strangers yesterday
Tomorrow...we could change our lonely ways
I will follow you down, wherever you go
Through every twist, and turn in the road
I will follow you down, wherever you go...Whoah!
I will follow you down.......wherever you go
(I will follow you down, to the end of the road)
(I will follow you down, to wherever you go)
