Smiling faces, sometimes
Pretend to be your friend
Smiling faces, show no traces
Of the evil that lurks within
(Can you dig it?)
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
They don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces
Tell lies and I got proof
Oh, Lord, yeah

[Instrumental break with vocal stylings.]
Let me tell ya, the truth is in the eyes
'Cause the eyes don't lie
Amen
Remember, a smile is just a frown
Turned upside down
My friend
So hear me when I'm sayin'
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
Hey, they don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces
Tell lies and I got proof
(Beware), beware of the handshake
That hides the snake
(Can you dig it, can you dig it?)
I'm a-telling you
(Beware), beware of the pat on the back
[Two claps.]
It just might hold you back
Jealousy (jealousy), misery (misery)
Envy (envy), I tell you, you can't see
Behind smiling faces
Smiling faces, sometimes
Hey, they don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces
Tell lies and I got proof
Hey, your enemy won't do you no harm
'Cause you'll know where he's coming from
Don't let the handshake and the smile fool ya
Take my advice I'm only try' to school ya
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes
They don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces
[Fade.]
Tell lies and I got proof
(Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes...)
