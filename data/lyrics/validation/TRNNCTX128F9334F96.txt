You walk around underneath
Invisible mistletoe
Just how far a kiss'll go
Remains to be seen

Your halo's a holly wreath
Your lips are lascivious
You seem oblivious
To what it could mean

I've made my intentions so clear
Fifty-one weeks of the year
But Christmas is finally here
And it's better to give than receive, my dear

Some people can tell it's there
But I know so well it's there
From winter to winter and
Each season between

Invisible mistletoe
Invisible mistletoe
