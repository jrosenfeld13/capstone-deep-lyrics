She's got that dark hair falling 'cross her shoulders
There's not a man alive that wouldn't want to hold her
And the way she moves, just the way she moves
Well, that's enough to keep me on a slow burn
Keep me on a slow burn

In her high heals kicking 'cross the dance floor
She's more woman than I could ever ask for
Still there's something in her eyes, in those dark eyes
That's love and that keeps me on a slow burn
Keeps me on a slow burn

When we touch this fire breaks out
And it rages out of control
And the love we made is so deep, so strong
And when it's over, even when it's over
And the flame dies down
It just dies down to a slow burn, slow burn

And the love we made is so deep, so strong
That when it's over, even when it's over
And the flame dies down
It just dies down to a slow burn, a slow burn
A slow burn, slow burn

She's got that dark hair falling 'cross her shoulders
Keeps me on a slow burn
In her high heals kicking 'cross the dance floor
Keeps me on a slow burn
When we touch, when we touch
