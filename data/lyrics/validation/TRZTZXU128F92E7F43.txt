Humanity's a failed experiment
Walking the path to extinction
Spinning its wheels endlessly
Grease them with oil and uranium

The earth will shake and the waters will rise
The elements reclaim what was taken
The skyline is set ablaze with regret
Ashes cover a falling silhouette
The city will reap what it's sown and ignite
Watching as the city burns tonight

Blindly consuming mass manufactured faith
Mankind is a festering parasite
Relentlessly draining its host dry
Nailing belief to a cross of genocide

The elements reclaim what was taken
The skyline is set ablaze with regret
Ashes cover a falling silhouette
The city will reap what it's sown and ignite
Watching as the city burns tonight

Only after the last tree's cut
And the last river poisoned
Only after the last fish is caught
Will you find that money cannot be eaten

And everything becomes irrelevant
As the sky tears open
Fire rains down, fire rains down
The fourth world comes to an end

Push the button light the match
Feel the fault lines detach
Crosshairs in the evening light
I sit and watch the city burn tonight
The city burns tonight

The skyline is set ablaze with regret
Ashes cover a falling silhouette
The city will reap what it's sown and ignite
Watching as the city burns tonight
