Softly remember we
Softly remember the words on the wall
They remind us and
Boldly remember we
Boldly remember how quickly they fall

Then we turned to remember our birth
Our eden
Then we turned to remember our worth
Our freedom

We found the westward way
To the hills of indigo blue
We watch the northern sapphire sky
We found the westward way
To the hills of indigo blue
The stars were burning through the night

Heart of creation
And state of the nation were asking for us
They were asking
For deep restoration and
Some relocation to what we can trust
