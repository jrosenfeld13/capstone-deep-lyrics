I look at you and I'm ready to pump
Luminous heartthrob ready to jump

Mama's dancin' with jellybone
You better watch out
Take you to the freak zone

Pump it up  give it up  turn up the track
Hard kiss  love chain
Pump it up  give it up  turn up the track
Pump it up  pump it up  pump it up  yeah

Pump it up  give it up  turn up the track
Pump  I'm a runaway train
Pump it up  give it up  turn up the track
Pump it up  pump it up  pump it up

Get serious get off the phone
Talk to me and make me moan
I said baby lose that phone
Rock me down to the jellybone

Motor runnin' double time
Machine is hummin'
Your body's mine
Dancin' in the street and we're havin' fun
Don't drop the beat
Electric drum

Chartreuse glow is maxin' out
Electric love  electric luau
I'm bustin' loose  pumpin' the music
Let's dance, baby
Let's dance  jellybone

Pump it up  give it up  turn up the track
Hard kiss  love chain
Pump it up  give it up  turn up the track
Pump it up  pump it up  pump it up  yeah

Pump it up  give it up  turn up the track
Pump  I'm a runaway train
Pump it up  give it up  turn up the track
Pump it up  pump it up  pump it up

Mama's dancin' - electric luau
Barefootin'  and kahootin'
With a wild crowd
Well, wild crowd

Electric eel, that's the feeling
Lines cross, lips heating
Lick my belly  turn to jelly
Spread me thin  I'm in!

I'm in it
I'm on it
I'm in it
I'm on it
I'm out
I'm in
I'm out
I'm in

Shake that jelly - rattle them bones
Dance to the rhythm that will make you moan

Pump it up  give it up  turn up the track
Hard kiss  love chain
Pump it up  give it up  turn up the track
Pump it up  pump it up  pump it up  yeah

Pump it up  give it up  turn up the track
Pump  I'm a runaway train
Pump it up  give it up  turn up the track
Pump it up  pump it up  pump it up
