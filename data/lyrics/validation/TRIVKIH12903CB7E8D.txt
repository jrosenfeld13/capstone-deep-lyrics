You took a chance
And I learned ho to deal with my life

You had to go
I had nothing
Just nothing but why

Why everything's broken
Why should I stay open
Open for you

But then my heart skipped a breath, whoa, whoa
Without a beat I forget
So, so, no
And I'm not ready to loose it all, whoa, whoa
But love is the law, is the law, is the law

I've got an empty room
But there's nowhere to cry
I've got a million reasons
To hate you but why

And I don't need a love song
So tell me what went wrong
Wrong with you

But then my heart skipped a breath, whoa, whoa
Without a beat I forget
So, so, no
And I'm not ready to loose it all, whoa, whoa
But love is the law, is the law, is the law

I'm gonna open my eyes
Gonna let you know
Not goin give it up
Gonna let you go

And I don't care if you don't come back, I'll be mad
Not yours
I'm alive

But then my heart skipped a breath, whoa, whoa
Without a beat I forget
So, so, no
And I'm not ready to loose it all, whoa, whoa
But love is the law, is the law, is the law
