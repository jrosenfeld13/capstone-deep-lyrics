If you see me walking down the street
Better get outta my way
I'm known as a real king hitter, and I'll always get the last say
If your looking for a heavy time
Best don't come around
Or else you'll get something heavy
Six feet of solid ground
I don't like trouble
But if trouble is the name of the game
You know where you can find me boy
Everybody knows my name
They call me the black eyed, they call me the black eyed
The black eyed bruiser
But then I used to be a peaceful man
Made of flowers and love
I believed in my soul
And the grace of the god lord above
But I was forced to change my tune
From candies and grace
By the powers of the filthy dollar
Everybody was kickin' in my face
There ain't no peace in this world, that's a fact
Take a good look around
So I'm going to stand here and fight
Nobody puts me down
They call me the black eyed, they call me the black eyed
The black eyed bruiser
All I want is a bit of understanding
Don't wan't to be the man I am
All I need is a little bit of lovin' care now
Don't want to be a hated man
Don't want to be
Don't want to be
The black eyed bruiser
