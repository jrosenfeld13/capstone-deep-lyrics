(Ray Price - Rusty Gabbard)
There ain't no chains strong enough to hold me
Ain't no breeze big enough to slow me
Never have seen a river that's too wide
Now there ain't no rope strong enough to bind me
Look for me, honey you will find me
I'll be there if you ever want me by your side
So love me if you ever gonna love me
I never have seen a river that's too wide
There ain't no chains strong enough to hold me
There ain't no breeze big enough to slow me
I'll be there if you ever want me by your side
Well, there ain't no jail tight enough to lock me
There ain't nobody big enough to stop me
I never have seen a road too rough to ride
I'll be there ready and a waitin'
There won't be any hesitation
I'll be right there if you ever want me by your side
So love me if you ever gonna love me
I never have seen a road too rough to ride
I'll be there ready and a waitin'
There won't be any hesitation
I'll be right there if you ever want me by your side...
