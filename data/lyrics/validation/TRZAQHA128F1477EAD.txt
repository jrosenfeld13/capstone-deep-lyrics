You said that you'd never hurt me
But you did anyway

My faith in this now deserts me
It fills my mind with despair
And here I lie

Down in the cold again
But still I do pretend
That I have no one
But myself to count on

Cuz I've tried to work things out
But a little mistake has slowed me down
To find out what I'm chasing after

Another day of this conflict
Once again I've bit my tongue out

For this greater reward here
Life has turned into somewhat of a lie

Down in the cold again
But still I do pretend
That I have no one
But myself to count on

Cuz I've tried to work things out
But a little mistake has slowed me down
To find out what I'm chasing after

Who do you want to be
If this is what you see
Who do you fucking blame
You're driving me insane

Cuz I've tried to work things out
But a little mistake has slowed me down
To find out what I'm chasing after

Cuz I've tried to work things out
But a little mistake has slowed me down
To find out what I'm chasing after
