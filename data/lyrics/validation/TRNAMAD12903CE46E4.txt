Hush little baby don't cry like that
God's gonna buy you a Cadillac
He's chosen you to do his will
You can spread the word in your coupe de ville

So jump in the river and learn to swim
God's gonna wash away all your sins
And if you still can't see the light
God's gonna buy you a satellite

Look to the heavens and see it shine
Heals the sick and leads the blind
Tune it in and hear it say
It's countin' down to judgment day

So jump in the river and learn to swim
God's gonna wash away all your sins
And if you still can't see the light
God's gonna buy you a satellite

Hey

Hey satellite man your time has come
Your word received by everyone
And should you fall, well that's ok
You love the ones that you betray

So jump in the river and learn to swim
God's gonna wash away all your sins
And when at last you see the light
God's gonna buy you a satellite
So jump in the river and learn to swim
God's gonna wash away all your sins
And when at last you see the light
God's gonna buy you a satellite
Yeah when at last you see the light
God's gonna buy you a satellite
Hey, hey, hey
Hey God's gonna buy you a satellite
Look to the heavens and see it shine
