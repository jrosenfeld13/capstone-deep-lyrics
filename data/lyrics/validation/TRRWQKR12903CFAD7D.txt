Go!

Have you ever
Felt the chill before dawn?
Cause it's darkest
In the early morn

So i'm all free
To wait before the sun
There i recall

How we've been pulled apart
Love's so hollow
And everything makes me cry
And i'm unable
To change stars in the sky!

All the times you said goodbye in pain
One final kiss in pouring rain
Is this the last time we'll embrace?
How many times can my heart break?

Feeling nothing
But the burning of tears
Who fall like the
The sun her disappears

Taking to a
Very quiet slumber
Attempting her
A timely departure

Like a lover
Who's been left behind
Watching as her
Pain takes the dusk inside and

All the times you said goodbye in pain
One final kiss in pouring rain
Is this the last time we'll embrace?
How many times can my heart break?

All the times you've sat at home and cried
Thousands of miles to wonder why
Was that the last time we'll embrace?
How many times can my heart break?

All the ti-i-imes
It hurts so bad
Always saying GOODBYE!!

We always suffer
We always suffer
We always suffer
We always suffer
For love
For love
For lo-ve, love!

All the times we said goodbye in pain
One final kiss in pouring rain
Is this the last time we'll embrace?
How many times can my heart break?

All the times you've sat at home and cried
Thousands of miles to wonder why
Was that the last time we'll embrace?
How many times can my heart break?

All the ti-e-imes
It hurts so bad
Always saying goodbye

All the ti-i-imes
It hurts so bad
Always saying goodbye
