We have journeyed for so long
Many seasons have passed by
Soon we'll there on the Ivory Plains
There we will fight for our lives
And to decide our own future
To protect the ones we hold so dear

But yet the worst part lies ahead
When we will fight for our world
Soon we'll be there on the Ivory plains
We shall grant no mercy
Nor show our fear
This time we'll win this war no matter the cost

The winter has passed and spring is upon us
To symbolize the dawn of the new time

This is just the calm before the storm begins
Oh, for Dragonland we have to win
Light give us strength
The storm draws near
Brave men ride on

(Solo: O.M)
(Solo: N.M)

Now as we reach the boundary of the Ivory plains
We set camp and many Drink their last ale
Sharpening their Swords, gathering their wits
And Waiting for the storm to begin

Soon we can live without fear, without Darkness
The glory of light will wash Them away

This is just the calm before the storm begins
Oh, for Dragonland we have to win
Light give us strength
The storm draws near
Brave men ride on
