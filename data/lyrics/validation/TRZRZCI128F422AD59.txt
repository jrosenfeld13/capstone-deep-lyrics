I
Can't
Say that I am free
As long as they return
If I
Had
A way out of here
Would I then return?
They seldom will speak, no
They only breathe slow

Do they know
I'm afraid, so afraid?
They depend
On my worries so I know
And I'm awake
I'm right in the circle now
I am with them

There is no way
I am going to be free
Because their hearts
They are similar to mine
There is no way
They are going to release me
From this chain
Of rows unto our own hearts

I
Can't
Say that I regret my promises
I
Can't
Say that I regret behaving my enemies
I seldom will speak, no
I only breathe
Ghost

Do they know
I'm afraid, so afraid?
They depend
On my worries so I know
And I'm awake
I'm right in the circle now
I am with them

There is no way
I am going to be free
Because their hearts
They are similar to mine
There is no way
They are going to release me
From this chain
Of rows unto our own hearts
