[Verse 1]
I play at night in your house
I live another life pretending to swim in your house

[Verse 2]
I change the time in your house
The hours I take go so slow

[Verse 3]
I hear no sound in your house
Silence in the empty rooms

[Verse 4]
I drown at night in your house
Pretending to swim, pretending to swim
