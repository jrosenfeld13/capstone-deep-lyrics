Our hope is fleeting, vanishing without a trace
The constant progressing of their ultimate goal; human enslavement and global control
Breaking down the barriers that define who we are, generalizing us as inferior
Fire is burning in the minds of the vigilant
The collective awakening of those willing to fight against an empire so malevolent
We will not be, slaves to our fate
Only to be labeled unpatriotic, an enemy of the state
This is only the land of the free, as long as it's the land of the brave
We are all born into slavery, but I refuse to die that way
I refuse to die!
Die!
I refuse to die!
Die!
I refuse!
The fires are spreading, they're fueled by our hate
I, I refuse to die
I, I refuse to die
Wild fires now scorch the land, leaving behind only ashes in our wake
Maybe now they'll understand, freedom lays in the choices that we make
I don't want to set the world on fire, I just want to watch you fucking burn
I don't want to set the world on fire; I just want to watch you fucking burn
Fucking burn!
A pulse is beating inside the hearts of the brave
A common misunderstanding of the task at hand, reclaiming our rights as Americans
Breaking down the barriers that disguise who they are demonizing the "superior"
