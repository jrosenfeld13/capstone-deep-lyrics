Tonight try not to think about things
Just be happy for one night
And maybe we could go get a drink

Or maybe you could take me for a drive
I could show you where I used to live
And where I had my first smoke

I wonder if you know that it's difficult for me
Not knowing what to think of things
Now I'm confused about everything
It's just sometimes I don't mind

You tell me everything keeps changing
But you know that sometimes
It just seems like you're complaining
You ask a million questions
It seems so never ending
You know sometimes I just wish you'd shut your trap

Let's forget work and let's just listen to the clash
Cause I can wait. Wait forever now

Put it down. Let's just walk away from everything
Cause it can't last forever

I can see you're running out of patience with me
Irony is for suckers

Wait for me. I just need a little bit of time
Cause I can wait for you
