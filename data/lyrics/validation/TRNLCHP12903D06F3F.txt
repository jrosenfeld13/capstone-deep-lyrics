The sun smiled down, all the clouds rolled away
God made woman on a good day
Legs, long legs
Stretchin all the way up from the ground to her thin waist
She looks so fine walking this way
God made woman on a good day
Hips, feminine hips
She's got silky hair, sexy eyes, soft pink lips
Seein' all of that, all that I can say is
God made woman on a good day

(chorus)
Some like to cook, some like to dance
But every one of them likes a little romance
He made 'em all great in different ways

Something for a boy to appreciate
___
She's got sense, common sense
Like a bee handles honey, she saves that money
Before it's all spent
Now there goes the reason that the bills get paid
God made woman on a good day

(repeat chorus)
God made woman on a good day
Might have been a monday, tuesday, I don't know
Could have been a saturday night
From her toes to her head whe he finished he said
God made woman, I know thats right
