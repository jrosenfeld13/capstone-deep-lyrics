It's just another day without you here
We've been waiting for awhile
It's becoming quite clear
We've been waiting all summer
It's never gonna come our way

If we remember those good times
Wonder why they never they never last
We'll forget about the future
Let us hold on to the past
I remember these days I spend here
Waiting at home

We're stuck
You're the only one weighing you down
Call me you would
Just to show you everything I found
This broken heart
My only picture of you

I would like to think
That you were thinking about me
Girl why you let me go
And why we can never be
Why everything that you've ever loved
Has turned to stone

If we remember those good times
Wonder why they never they never last
We'll forget about the future
Let us hold on to the past
I remember these days I spend here
Waiting at home

We're stuck
The only one weighing you down
Call me you would
Just to show you everything I found
Cause I don't know if we'll ever make it out of here
This broken heart
My only picture of you
I pick up the pieces
The shit you put me through
Cause I don't know if we'll ever make it out of here
With the smoke and mirrors
It's all coming out so clear
