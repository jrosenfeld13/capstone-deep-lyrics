Smashing through the boundaries
Storming through the burning fields
Stand before the evil one on towards the morning sun
Falling under skies of pain

Still we're searching endlessly
Crashing over seven seas
Torturing the winter skies riding over plains of ice
Shadows in the fields of the slain!

Crashing steel and raging fury smash the quest destroy their army
Crush the legions of the twilight, templars of steel will burn

Cry far away as we reach for the day
Blasting our way through the punishment and the pain
Reach for the world as the sky begins to fall
Rising through the darkened ashes praying that I'll see you all

[Chorus:]
Far away will our eyes now see the day
For today, the everlasting eternal sun
Washed away the dreams of a brighter day
Forever hold the dream inside the chance to fight another fight
The breaking hearts that stand for all our lives
Live tonight

Watch you die I watch you die inside while fear controls your life
And reject this animosity that killed so many minds
You feel the power deep within the fear you hold inside
Just to find the reason for the treason now you will be mine

Screams of pain in death descending rise again from hell defending
Burn their hearts within the fire, warriors of light will be slain

Rise through the pain like the sun will rise again
Day after day but the memories never change
Stand before the storm as the last horizon falls
Blinded by the vision and the innocence of our souls

[Chorus]
Far away will our eyes now see the day
For today, the everlasting eternal sun
Washed away the dreams of a brighter day
Forever hold the dream inside the chance to fight another fight
The breaking hearts that stand for all our lives
Live tonight

[Solos: Sam/Herman/Sam]

[Chorus]
Far away will our eyes now see the day
For today, the everlasting eternal sun
Washed away the dreams of a brighter day
Forever hold the dream inside the chance to fight another fight
The breaking hearts that stand for all our lives
Live tonight

WO...
