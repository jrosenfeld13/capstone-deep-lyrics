[Verse 1]
My mind is open now
I'm on the other side
Though you remember my name
And if you go away
I'll get it off somehow
I'll leave it all in the air, no, no

[Chorus]
Turn me down, turn me down
Turn me down, oh, how I've tried
Really and sincerely I've tried

[Verse 2]
There is a song
I hear it all around
But I don't hear a sound
If you were with me now
I'd let you know my mind
Love is so easy to lose, no, no

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Turn me down
Turn me down
Turn me down
Turn me down
