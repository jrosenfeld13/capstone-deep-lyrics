Well, it seems right
But I wonder and it feels right
But I wonder if I know how true love feels

Well, he shows me
But I wonder
He tells me
But I wonder
If he knows how true love feels

Is it all infatuation?
(Or is it possibly real?)
Is it heartache's consulation?
(Or is it possibly real?)

Tell me again
(This could be just what you wanted so long)
Please tell me again
(This could be someone who has wants and needs of his own)

Well, it seems right
(Could it be love?)
But I wonder
(Could it be love?)
And it feels right
Oh, but I wonder
(Could it be love?)
If we know how true love feels

Is it all infatuation
(Or is it possibly real?)
Is it heartache's consulation?
(Or is it possibly real?)

Tell me again
(This could be just what you wanted so long)
Please tell me again
(This could be someone who has wants and needs of his own)

Well, it seems right
But I wonder
It feels right
But I wonder
If we know how true love feels

Well, he shows me
But I wonder
He tells me
But I wonder
If we know how true love feels

Well, it seems right
But I wonder
It feels right
But I wonder
