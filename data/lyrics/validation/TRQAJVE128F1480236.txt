Focus on me baby
Way to flood my headspace (I'd kill for you)
I know I kept you waiting (I'd wait for you)
Oh. I'd kill for you
You're keeping up such a good pace (I'll keep to you)
Sucks you kept me waiting (I'll creep to you)

Ohhh I'd kill for you
Whooooowooo i'll kill for you
Whooooowooo i'll kill for you
Whooooowooo i'll kill for you

If you run, you know that I'll give chase
But the chances are you'd lose me
I hate that and hate that
I'd kill for you
Way to flood my headspace (I'd kill for you)
I know I kept you waiting (I'd wait for you)

Oh. I'd kill for you
Whooooowooo i'll kill for you
Whooooowooo i'll kill for you
Whooooowooo i'll kill for you

I know I kept ya waiting
Sucks I kept ya waiting
A lack of Inspiration breeds temptation
Really, I swear, I will try
Inspiration breeds temptation
Really, I swear, I will try

Way to flood my head space
Way to flood my head space

Whooooowooo i'll kill for you
Whooooowooo i'll kill for you
Whooooowooo i'll kill for you (for you)

I'll kill for you
Whooooowooo i'll kill for you
Whooooowooo i'll kill for you
Whooooowooo i'll kill for you
