Great bats,sweet demon necks
They bite my bumps, right here, how can?
Great blue birds pass my eyes
Show me how to die
Well I know, and I see and I feel
And I think, I know why
Blisters swell all my skin
They come right from within
They are doing my soul in
I've got big hopes within
In the red sky
I've got big lovein my head
I've got big love in my soul
I'm doing it every nightv And I'll do it untill I'm old
And I know I'm gonna be bombed
And I'm laughing all the way
And I know I'm gonna love you
Every night or two
Red skies, blue skies, dead skies
Do it right, dig it, dig it
James Brown, get up, get up
Stay on scene like a sex machine
Get up, get on up
Hey baby!, what do you tell me ?
What do you tell me about last night ?
About the big boys ?
And the big girls, and the big times
And all the big lots
And all the big people
And all the big feet
Hey, what do you know about that?
Get up
Stay on scene, like a loving machine
