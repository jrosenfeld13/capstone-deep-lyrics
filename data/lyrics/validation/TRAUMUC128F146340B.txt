Higher than the clouds in the sky you are
Waiting for the rain to pass by high
In a world so cold it's hard to turn away
Look away ... look away

But baby,baby,baby
Come on where you running now
Come on Babe where you running to
You run to me right now

Chorus:
'Cos nothing is stronger than love
Nothing's stronger
'Cos nothing is stronger than love

Brighter than the stars in the sky you are
Like a rolling stone you turn the other way
Look away ... look away ...

Chorus

But do you know where you're running to
Come on baby run to me
Can you not take anymore
Come on baby can't you take it now
You fell in love and the pain is growning more and more

Chorus

Brighter than the stars in the sky you are

But do you know where you're running to
Come on baby where you're running now
Can you not take anymore
Come on baby can't you take it now
You fell in love and the pain is growing more and more

Chorus to fade ...
