I must have walked ten million miles
I must have walked ten million miles
Wore some shoes that weren't my style
Ten million miles

I've been kind of told some lies
Like anyone who's lived or died
Like anyone who's ever tried
To walk ten million miles

I memorise and I forget
I do some things that I regret
Wish for things I never get
Walk in the rain and get wet

I must have walked ten million miles
I must have walked ten million miles
So think before you criticise
Ten million miles

Travelled round from place to place
Wore some rags around my waist
And other times a dress of lace
And I always search for your sweet face

You ought to come some time for tea
Maybe we could see the sea
Talk a lot or let things be
Just enjoy the mystery

I must have walked ten million miles
I must have walked ten million miles
Wore some shoes that weren't my style
Fell into the rank and file
So just say I was here a while
A fool in search of your sweet smile
Ten million miles
