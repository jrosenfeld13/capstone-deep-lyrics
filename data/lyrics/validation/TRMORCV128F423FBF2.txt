She hides behind a smile
She lies
Beware of what you do
Take care, she will get to you
Trust in experience
Believe it's true

Lucinda gonna cut you down
Lucinda gonna make you cry
She been around don't ask me why
She got to hurt you
She gonna hurt you, hurt you

This girl is not a child
She's wise
She knows just what to say
She knows how to get her way
Don't let her steal your heart
'Cause when she's through

Lucinda gonna cut you down
Lucinda gonna make you cry
She been around don't ask me why
She got to hurt you
She gonna hurt you, hurt you

You're thinking you're the number one
You're king and she will wear your crown
Lucinda gonna cut you down
It's gonna hurt you
It's got to hurt you, hurt you

Lucinda gonna cut you down
Lucinda gonna cut you down
Lucinda gonna cut you down
Lucinda gonna cut you down
