I wanna cheat on my girlfriend
Don't want nobody to know
I wanna keep it a secret
Keep it on the down-low
It doesn't mean I don't love her
It doesn't mean I don't care
Well she don't need to worry
I'm not going anywhere

You know the Beverly garland
At the 101
I said I'll meet you there darling
Don't you tell anyone

I won't make you pitch in
But you're still gonna pay
Well don't make it a big deal
It really isn't anyway

I keep telling her, she'd be proud of me
Well I've been good for oh-so long
I keep telling her, to get out herself
And go do something wrong

I keep telling her, she'd be proud of me
Well I've been good for oh-so long
I keep telling her, to get out herself
And go do something wrong

I wanna cheat on my girlfriend
Don't want nobody to know
I wanna keep it a secret
Keep it on the down-low
It doesn't mean I don't love her
It doesn't mean I don't care
Well she don't need to worry
I'm not going anywhere

Well she don't need to worry
I'm not going anywhere...
