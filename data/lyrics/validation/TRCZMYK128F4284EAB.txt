She shivers in the rain
It's the capital connecting with her veins
Stepping under statues and on trains
'Till we are under covers
She giggles like a child
With no sign of all the tension in her life
It's written on her T-shirt and in her eyes
That there is no other

'Cause we are the lovers, we are the lovers
We're different colours but we stand up as one
We are the lovers, we are the lovers
Two different colours but we stand up as one

All the silly things we do
Just remind me of the flippancy of youth
Kissing under statues, throwing food
And getting into trouble
She shivers in the cold
It's the capital connecting with her bones
Jumping into taxis, here we go
Yes there is no other

Cause we are the lovers, we are the lovers
We're different colours but we stand up as one
We are the lovers, we are the lovers
Two different colours but we stand up as one
