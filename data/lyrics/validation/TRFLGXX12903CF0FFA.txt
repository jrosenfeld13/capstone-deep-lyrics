I expand the universe, the elastic space
And dominate behind the cosmic screen
Every mark left from phase to phase
I expand the universe, the elastic space
And dominate behind the cosmic screen
Every mark left from phase to phase
The only evidence of where I've been

I am the missing force of gravity
That holds each universe
I affect and distribute the galaxies
Defined as blessing or a as curse

Observe the sky and you will find
Within the sculptor void I lie
Now close your eyes and realize
Within the sculptor void I rise

I am a thoughtform inside the matrix
That your mind can never process
The infinite drug, the everlasting fix
Ending the pitch black progress

I am the missing force of gravity
That holds each universe
I affect and distribute the galaxies
Defines as blessing or a as curse

Observe the sky and you will find
Within the sculptor void I lie
Now close your eyes and realize
Within the sculptor void I rise

In every void my presence is known
And the stillness holds my unspoken name
Now realize that the sun never sets
The planets orbit on ellipses
Flow forth into the universe unbound
Outside the frames of earth-reality

I am the missing force of gravity
That holds each universe
I affect and distribute the galaxies
Defined as blessing or a as curse

Observe the sky and you will find
Within the sculptor void I lie
Now close your eyes and realize
Within the sculptor void I rise
