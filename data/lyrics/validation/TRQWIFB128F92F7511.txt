This is the summer of love
Tonight the fiesta will come
It's the summer of love

Tonight we live La Vida Loca
Yes We'll have the time of our lives
The fiesta we'll always remember
Tonight we will taste paradise

Life is sweet and we treasure each moment
Moving closely with me as we sway
For tonight we forget our tomorrows
It's time for the music to play

The temperature's rising
You' search the horizon
And there's not a cloud in the sky

So Dance - it's the summer of Love
Tonight the fiesta will come
One hundred degrees
In the shade of the trees
To the producers, Leo and Max
Tonight is the night of our lives
De Fruita La Vida that's right
One hundred degrees
And we turn up the heat to the producers, Leo and Max
For the summer of Love

The night is when friends become lovers
And people are lost in their dreams
Tomorrow the spell may be broken
So celebrate love and be free

The rhythm of life beats within you
Don't try to resist when it calls
Move closer to me feel the music
Now nothing else matters at all

The temperature's rising
You search the horizon
And there's not a cloud in the sky

So dance - it's the summer of love
Tonight the fiesta will come
One Hundred degrees
In the shade of the trees
To the producers, Leo and Max
Tonight is the night of our lives
De Fruita La Vida that's right
One hundred degrees
And we turn up the heat
To the producers, Leo and Max
For the summer of love

Now we dance in the moonlight
And I see the love in your eyes
Look to the stars make a wish
Don't try to resist
It's the summer of love

Tonight is the night of our lives
De Fruita La Vida that's right
One hundred degrees
And we turn up the heat
To the producers, Leo and Max
For the summer of love
