So now you say dirty things that you regret
Try to breathe and relax and get over it
This I know, this I know

And now you look and you digging a deep hole
And every word that you say is regrettable
This I know, this I know

But here I am
There you go
Time's been changing you more than you'd ever know
Here I am
There you go
Ive been waiting for more than you'd ever know

You can pretend that you don't need a reason
For all the calls on the phone that would never end
This I know, this I know

So now your cold and your tired and ...
Try to wave with the hand as you scratch me
This I know, this I know

But here I am
There you go
Time's been changing you more than you'd ever know
Here I am
Letting go
I've been waiting for more than you'd ever know

We'll last, stay here
While you're not there
Bear with me, please
Day after day
I'll get my way
Bear with me

So now you stare at the face in the photograph
You want to scream but you can't get ...
This I love, this I love

Here I am
There you go
Time's been changing you more than you'd ever know
Here I am
I'll let you go
I've been waiting for more than, more than you know

But I know
But I know

More than you know

Here I am (I know, well I know)
Here I am (I know)
