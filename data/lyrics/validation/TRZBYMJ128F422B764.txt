All you crave are sleeping days
Numb interrupted
Blindness is your favourite game
You're hated

Paranoid and insecure
Cracking in your shell
Antisocial, unattached
You?'re wasted

Disenchanted one, used to breathe in the sun
Now the black cloud follows you

Say goodbye to the light and watch it fade
As you try to hold the rain
These lonely nights, holding on

Dancing monkey on your back
Karma at the door
Spinning room is sinking fast
Embrace it

Disconnected one, everyone is gone
And you can't get out of here

Say goodbye to the light and watch it fade
As you try to hold the rain
These lonely nights, holding on
Say hello to the demons in your mind
And the love you left behind
These lonely nights, holding on

Disillusioned friend, can you still pretend
That there's nothing killing you

Say goodbye to the light and watch it fade
As you try to hold the rain
These lonely nights, holding on
Say hello to the demons in your mind
And the love you left behind
These lonely nights, holding on
