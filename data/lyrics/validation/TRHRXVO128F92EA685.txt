I've heard that life is more
Than just what we paint it
I've heard that life is more
Than asphalt and pavement

But it's hard to see
Through the traffic and the fumes
I can't be everywhere
But I'll be home by 7:02

I've heard that love
Is a game for the fools who play it
I've heard that war
Is a shame for the fools who wage it

But I'm getting tired
Throwing flowers at a tomb
I've got to run along
So I'll be home by 7:02

I can't carry the world on my own
And you can't help me
But you can hold my hand if you wanted to
Just kiss me once or twice
When I get home at 7:02
