Another glimpse inside a flower, you're my rose
She laughs, he sighs, and punched her in the nose
He keeps her warm
He keeps her warm
He keeps her warm

She's fine, so fine, her bruises are all mine
She took too much and waits 'til morning time
He keeps her warm
He keeps her warm
He keeps her warm

Crystal cloak covers all
The kiss before the fall
She sinks into the sea
We had a good time, didn't we?
