He's just an artist drawing black hearts beating to the rhythm of napalm;
He's on the attack
Masquerading as a suicide soldier with all of the technique but none of the class

Alert the press! There are no letters left!
Just stolen memories and fragments of a heart, at best!
So hear their cries; their severed ties of stories with a lost cause
And sordid memories revised

Do you believe yourself?
The terms, the lines, the stories told a thousand times before?
You'll just steal yourself
A hook, a rhyme, I've heard your words a thousand times
The times are changing

Whatever happened to the way everything used to be?
Your heart's on disconnect. We pulled the plug; flat lined the beat
Whatever happened to the way everything used to be?
Now we have nothing left apart from stolen memories

We're treading water! We've dug our own graves!
Hopelessly devoid of machine-gun I Love You's
Treating lonely like a disease

Tonight we paint this town dead
We are alive! With a golden tongue and an ivory pride!
The corpse will stand and sing along
To the confessions of his living hand who wrote the saddest song

Do you believe yourself?
The terms, the lines, the stories told a thousand times before?
You'll just steal yourself
A hook, a rhyme, I've heard your words a thousand times
The times are changing

Whatever happened to the way everything used to be?
Your heart's on disconnect. We pulled the plug; flat lined the beat
Whatever happened to the way everything used to be?
Now we have nothing left apart from stolen memories

Goodnight. Goodbye
