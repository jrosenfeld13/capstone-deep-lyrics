[Intro]
Goddamn your righteous hand

[Verse 1]
I eat innocent meat
The housewife, I will beat
The pro-life, I will kill
What you won't do, I will

I bash myself to sleep
What you sow, I will reap
I scar myself, you see
I wish I wasn't me

I am the little stick
You stir me into shit
I hate, therefore I am
Goddamn your righteous hand

[Pre-Chorus]
Goddamn (Ooh, Lord)
Goddamn (Ooh, Lord)
Goddamn (Ooh, Lord)
Goddamn (Ooh, Lord)

[Chorus]
Pseudo-morals work real well
On the talk shows for the weak
But your selective judgments and good guy badges
Don't mean a fuck to me

[Verse 2]
I throw a little fit
I slit my teenage wrists
The most that I can learn
Is in records that you burn

[Refrain]
Get your gunn
Get your gunn
Get your gunn
Get your gunn

[Chorus]
Pseudo-morals work real well
On the talk shows for the weak
But your selective judgments and good guy badges
Don't mean a fuck to me

Pseudo-morals work real well
On the talk shows for the weak
But your selective judgments and good guy badges
Don't mean a fuck to me

[Bridge]
I am the VHS
Record me with your fist
You want me to save the world
I'm just a little girl

[Chorus]
Pseudo-morals work real well
On the talk shows for the weak
But your selective judgments and good guy badges
Don't mean a fuck to me

Pseudo-morals work real well
On the talk shows for the weak
But your selective judgments and good guy badges
Don't mean a fuck to me

[Refrain]
Get your gunn
Get your gunn
Get your gunn
Get your gunn
Get...
