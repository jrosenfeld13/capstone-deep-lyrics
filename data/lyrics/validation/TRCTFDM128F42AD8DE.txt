[Verse 1]
In these words that crash my ears, I now stomach this in fear
With the turn I gathered name as the bastard's son
Who, by fire, I would come through this wire I might cut
Atop this tower of loss and lust
I'll gravitate towards you, I will, in the now, hate you
Whoa-oh oh, whoa-oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll make you wish
You hadn't burned our time, before
I'll live through this
In a manner cursed at my own accord

[Chorus]
If my shame spills our worth across this floor
Then tonight, goodnight, I'm burning Star IV
Only I don't even think of you
No, I don't wanna think of you, anymore
Goodnight, tonight, goodbye
Goodnight, tonight, goodbye

[Verse 2]
In my presence, you might wake
Through this fiction I must fake
Your death to grace the face of my character
With these lessons, he might learn
That all worlds from here must burn
For as God demands, in the end, we miss

[Chorus]
Whoa-oh, oh
If my shame spills our worth across this floor
Whoa-oh, oh
Then tonight, goodnight, I'm burning Star IV

Only I don't even think of you
No, I don't wanna think of you, anymore
Goodnight, tonight, goodbye
Goodnight, tonight, goodbye

[Bridge: Spoken]
There is no room for mistakes, my children
For as I have been told, today is the day I die
I'm sorry I never played the part as your father, as I should have
And from the looks on your faces, it seems that's all you've ever asked of me
It is time for you to go into these worlds alone... with all of my love
I'm sorry and I love you all so very much

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll make you wish
You hadn't burned our time before
I'll live through this
In a manner cursed at my own accord

(I don't want to go)
So come on, bitch, why aren't you laughing now?
(You left me here to fend on my own)
So cry on, bitch, why aren't you laughing now?

[Chorus]
Whoa-oh, oh
If my shame spills our worth across this floor
Whoa-oh, oh
Then tonight, goodnight, I'm burning Star IV

Only I don't even think of you
No, I don't wanna think of you, anymore
Goodnight, tonight, goodbye
Goodnight, tonight, goodbye

Whoa-oh oh, whoa-oh-oh oh
Whoa-oh oh, whoa-oh-oh oh
Only I don't even think of you
No, girl, I don't wanna think of you, anymore
Goodnight, tonight, goodbye
Goodnight, tonight, goodbye
