Oh, dreamboat, my sugarloaf
I can tell from your smile
Oh, baby, I could be one girl of a port of call
If you will drop your anchor
And stay for awhile

And, yes, I want to smother my perfect lover
Till we're dancing in the skies
There's nothing like hustle and muscle
And, babe, I got eyes
Oh, babe, I got eyes

No tugboat around my head you could never be
In songs like this
Where words and chords collide instead a hopeless turn of phrase
With sincerity

Chorus:
And, yes, I want to smother my perfect lover
With candy kisses to make him wise
An offer you couldn't (wouldn't) refuse and, babe, I got eyes
Oh, babe, I got eyes

The 'eyes' have always made it clear
That love begins and ends
Without a sense of fashion, no code etiquette is here
Only a friendly drive towards impolite passion

Know what I'm talking about
Know what I'm talking about

My old pal, my carnivale
We have just begun
When morning comes we'll linger and begin again
And you will not believe how smart you've become

Repeat Chorus

Oh, babe, I got eyes
Oh, babe, I got eyes
