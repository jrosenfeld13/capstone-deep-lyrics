Wait one moment
Before the spell is broken
Remember all your lives you've lived before
We've all been born together in this special place and time
To raise the world

Wait one moment
To fill your heart with spirit
To take sometimes to live the holy fire(?)
To take the opportunity to tune yourself into the liquid laughter
Of the great happy one

Wait one moment
There's no need to be quickly
You make the link between above and below
You make electric circuits of the loving energy
To spread it around
