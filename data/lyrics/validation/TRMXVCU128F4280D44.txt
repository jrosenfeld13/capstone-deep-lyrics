I used to think I had, thick skin
It took a while to peel it down and let you in
When I did I told you secrets
You held my fears
Took away as I lay my head down
It's time to begin
(To begin)
Let the sun
(Sun)
Shine
(Shine)
Back
(Back)
In here
It's time to begin
(To begin)
Claim the sun
(Sun)
Lay
(Lay)
Out
(Out)
Your heart
It's time to begin
Ooh
So when it was time to start
But then I fell to come forward
And my new skin
Now I need to sew the old and the new
When a black bug hidden in a door [unverified]
You came and turned the volume down
Now I need to find the balance
Between light and sound
It's time to begin
(To begin)
Let the sun
(Sun)
Shine
(Shine)
Back
(Back)
In here
It's time to begin
(To begin)
Claim the sun
(Sun)
Lay
(Lay)
Out
(Out)
Your heart
It's time to begin
(To begin)
Let the sun
(Sun)
Shine
(Shine)
Again
(Again)
Please again
It's time to begin
The journey has been long, my friend
You held my hand
Without a word I know you understand
It's time to begin
(To begin)
Let the sun
(Sun)
Shine
(Shine)
Back
(Back)
In here
It's time to begin
(To begin)
Claim the sun
(Sun)
Lay
(Lay)
Out
(Out)
Your heart
It's time to begin
(To begin)
Let the sun shine
(Shine)
Again
(Again)
Please again
It's time to begin
(To begin)
May there be day and love
It's time to begin, oh, oh, oh
