Here we are, in the place where you grew up
Where you spent so much time
Where you plotted out your life

These next few lines are a series of events
About my family and friends
That kept me further from the edge

So when the day comes that they put me into the ground
All the ones who claimed they loved me will gather around
Theyll throw flowers down and tears will come running down their face
As they say goodbye and say that Ive gone to a better place

This is where your vision starts, where your vision starts to blur
Have you ever thought of giving up on what you love the most?
Did you forget about the ones that you would hurt?
Just a few more seconds then the pain will be gone

Just hold on!
(Go ahead, let go)
Its not your time!
(Your time is up)
There is so much more!
(You should end it here)
You've got your whole life in front of you!
(Youve got nothing to live for)
Theres a reason to live!
(So pick up that knife)
You just cant give up!
(Put it through your chest)
(Please end it, please end it all)

Its on the tips of our tongues
Help me, hear me, leave me, forgive me
If I fall, Ill be the one left to lie alone in this mess
And I know, that if you end your life
I will be joining you shortly

You say, "You need a greater purpose"
I say, "You need to see what's coming"
(When you know that the feeling is gone)
(Youll see this through my eyes and feel alive again)

The road to Hell is paved with good intentions
