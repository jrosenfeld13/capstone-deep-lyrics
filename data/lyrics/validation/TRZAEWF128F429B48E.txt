[DINA]
Umm Kulthum and Omar Sharif
Came floating on the jasmine wind
From the west, from the south
Honey in my ears
Spice in my mouth
Dark and thrilling
Strange and sweet
Cleopatra and the handsome thief
And they floated in on a jasmine wind
Umm Kulthum and Omar Sharif
And they floated in on a jasmine wind
Umm Kulthum and Omar Sharif

Friday evening, Omar Sharif
In black and white and blurry through tears
My mother and I would sit there in a trance
He was cool to the marrow, the pharaoh of romance

Sunday morning
Umm Kulthum
Her voice would fill our living room
The ship from Egypt always came
Sailing in on radio waves

And the jasmine wind, deep perfume
Umm Kulthum
And the living room becomes a garden
And the TV set becomes a fountain
And the music flows in the garden
And everything grows

Umm Kulthum and Omar Sharif
Came floating on a lemon leaf
Flying in on a jasmine wind
Umm Kulthum and Omar Sharif
And we dance with them on a jasmine scented wind
Umm Kulthum and Omar Sharif
