Simian moths in search
Of metanoia and illuminance
Exuberant dismay they will reap

Condemnation decomposes sanity
Through inhumanity and putrification
A plunge towards hopeless, dismal death

Another pawn has taken the fall
A mind unsound and rotted
Put him up against the wall
Along with the tortured, the raped
And the gutted

The unflesh is burning...

And when the shell of mortal breath has ruptured
When existence has been wiped
Off the portal of perception
When, freed of shape or heart
Anon succumbs to life-defying rapture
At last, the truth be shown

And the deprivation has just begun
Unseen chasms of perdition await
The very fabric of the soul comes undone
Never to abate, the gulf digests them one by one...

The unflesh is burning...

And when the shell of mortal breath has ruptured
When existence has been wiped
Off the portal of perception
When, freed of shape or heart
Anon succumbs to life-defying rapture
At last, the truth be shown
