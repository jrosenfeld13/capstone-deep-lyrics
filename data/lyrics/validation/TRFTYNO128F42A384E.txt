Get It!

Some wanna rap just what they heard, C'mon
But some people ain't got no words
They wanna spit and flip and flip the script
The difference between a noun and a verb

Call women b's and hoes
So outta their mouth it flows
Population blind, sorry he can't see
Carefully choose your team that's right

Security done a helluva job
Just keepin' off the mob

Livin' VIP where the playas play
Don't forget the real very important people pay
When everybody's shouting out to go
When everybody's stopping the flow

Without your health
You ain't got ya self
Superstar, wants y'all to know

Ain't bout no take azz friends
Ain't about them ol timbs and rims
Who wanna spend and spend
All your odds and ends
So you can just call 'em friends
You can still be a queen and king
Without them riches, rings and things
And that's havin' not a goddamn thing

To my people who gonna make it happen
To my people who got something to prove
Don't stop the groove, get on the move
