It breaks your system from within

Your consciousness is
The only censorship

The only censorship

Time is a jet plane
My life is burning up
Time is a jet plane
My life is burning up

Pain is a close up
And happiness a long shot
Pain is a close up
And happiness a long shot

You wake up
You shut down
