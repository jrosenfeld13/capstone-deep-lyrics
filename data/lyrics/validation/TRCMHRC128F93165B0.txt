It may not be the best one
It may not be like the rest of 'em
But she makes it sound so sweet
The melodies she makes it sing

On her red guitar the color never fades away
No matter where she has it placed
And my life would change when I saw the face of
Of her red guitar

It's been through hell, oh, the sound it makes
It takes me to some higher place
She doesn't have a clue
Oh, that I love to listen to

Her red guitar, yeah, the color never fades away
No matter where she has it placed
And my life would change when I saw the face of
Of her red guitar, of her red guitar

She plays it soft so only I can hear
The same old song that she played last year
And it may not have all the strings
Oh, but she strums it beautifully

On her red guitar, yeah, the color never fades away
No matter where she has it placed
And my life would change when I saw the face of
Of her red guitar, of her red guitar, of her red guitar
