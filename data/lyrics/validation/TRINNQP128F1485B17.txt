Wazz up, wazz up, wazz up
That's the greeting we repeating
Wazz up, wazz up, wazz up
That's the greeting we repeating

(Verse 1)
Hey ladies, let 'em know where the party at
Do your dance on the floor, now wazz up with that?
Step up the game, show 'em how a girl act (uh oh, uh oh, ooh la la)
Ladies, you can stil rock a fitted cap
Jeans, sneakers, and a fresh top to match
Don't be ashamed, go ahead and wear that (uh oh, uh oh, ooh la la)

Hey, hey, hey
That's how a cool girl gon' play
We're doin' it our own way
And that's how it's gonna stay
Said hey, hey, hey
That's how a cool girl gon' play
We're doin' it our own way
And that's how it's gonna stay

(Chorus)
All the ladies on the floor and all your fellas (wazz up)
Twist ya body like a tarantella (wazz up)
Keep on dancin' through the night (wazz up)
That's the greeting we repeating

All the ladies on the floor and all your fellas (wazz up)
Twist ya body like a tarantella (wazz up)
Keep on dancin' through the night (wazz up)
That's the greeting we repeating

(Verse 2)
Fellas, on the floor doin' backspins
Go go for yours, minus the actin'
Don't be standin' at the back, bling flashin' (uh oh, uh oh, ooh la la)
Hey fellas, hit the floor when the wack spins
We give you that audio passion
A taste of our new sound fashion (uh oh, uh oh, ooh la la)

Hey, hey, hey
That's how a cool girl gon' play
We're doin' it our own way
And that's how it's gonna stay
Said hey, hey, hey
That's how a cool girl gon' play
We're doin' it our own way
And that's how it's gonna stay

(Chorus)
All the ladies on the floor and all your fellas (wazz up)
Twist ya body like a tarantella (wazz up)
Keep on dancin' through the night (wazz up)
That's the greeting we repeating

All the ladies on the floor and all your fellas (wazz up)
Twist ya body like a tarantella (wazz up)
Keep on dancin' through the night (wazz up)
That's the greeting we repeating

(Verse 3)
What up, what up, ya'll know what it is (wazz up)
This is the way we turantella twist (and what not)
We spin around 'til we gettin' dizzy ('cause we rock)
We got the whole place steamin' like a boilin' pot
I kid you not
So'em 'bout the style we got
We got the boys poppin' up with the question (wazz up?)
If they're nice we might give 'em a lesson
'Cause when we do a dance like it's our profession, we do the hop

(Chorus)
All the ladies on the floor and all your fellas (wazz up)
Twist ya body like a tarantella (wazz up)
Keep on dancin' through the night (wazz up)
That's the greeting we repeating

All the ladies on the floor and all your fellas (wazz up)
Twist ya body like a tarantella (wazz up)
Keep on dancin' through the night (wazz up)
That's the greeting we repeating
