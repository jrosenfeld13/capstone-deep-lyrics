[Verse 1]
I feel like this won't go away
No matter how hard I try to
Squeeze my eyes shut so I can't see
The pain in you, this pain in me... in me

[Chorus]
Everything that I can say to you
Won't help you
Everything you need is right in front of you
Just take it

[Verse 2]
I know that I'm really not here
To represent what I'm not clear
About in my head
Sometimes I feel fucked up just like you do... like you do

[Chorus]
But everything that I can say to you
Won't help you
Everything you need is right in front of you
Just take it

[Post-Chorus]
Try to make it through the daily pain
That you feel
Maybe tomorrow won't be so bad
I know it

[Bridge]
'Cause I once felt that way
Nothing I could say
Made it go away
I lived through this, I still feel this
I just live for my tomorrow

[Outro]
Just make it go away
Just make it go away
She'll make it go away
She'll make it go away
