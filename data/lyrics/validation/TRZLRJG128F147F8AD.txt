In this fair town we laid them down in 1643
It was poor King Charles who travelled for miles, in the heart of a civil dream
As fierce young men we took a mighty stand, and waited for the call
We were the first ones over the wall

These four walls are at the heart of the kingdom
These four walls

A shot rang out from behind the hill, as we marched along the bank
We were stuck in fast between a heavy marsh, and our clothes were torn and damp
"So steady your guns until the last man comes", our captain he did cry
I was the last man to see him alive

These four walls are at the heart of the kingdom
These four walls

As night crept in, and the stars were dim, no soldier made a sound
We had lost all sight in that fading light, the fires had gone aground
So the captain went out to a scream and shout, for an ambush he would find
I was the the last man to see him alive

These four walls are at the heart of the kingdom
These four walls are at the heart of the kingdom
These four walls are at the heart of the kingdom
These four walls

At first light when the guns were quiet, reinforcements came to town
They were put on our side with a parliament pride, the battle it turned around
So the war was won, but the captain gone, and forever we recall
He was the first one over the wall

The first one, he was the first cut down
These four walls are at the heart of the kingdom
The first one, he was the first cut down
These four walls are at the heart of the kingdom
The first one, he was the first cut down
These four walls are at the heart of the kingdom
The first one, he was the first cut down
These four walls

He was the first one, he was the first cut down
These four walls are at the heart of the kingdom
The first one, he was the first cut down
These four walls at the heart of the kingdom
The first one, he was the first cut down
These four walls at the heart of the kingdom
The first one, he was the first cut down
These four walls
