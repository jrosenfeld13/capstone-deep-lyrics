Maybe you'll come
Or maybe you won't
I know you hesitate
But baby, I don't
So please trust me this time
Trust me cause I know...

That wherever you go
I'll end up there too
And there's nothing you can do
And whatever you say
I'm gonna find a way
To win your heart

You might bring us wine
Or you might invite me to dine
Why worry about the rules
When you know you can't lose
So come along don't leave me hanging too long
You might just come cause I know...

That wherever you go
I'll end up there too
And there's nothing you can do
And whatever you say
I'm gonna find a way
To win your heart

You might try to kiss me
Or you might need some more time
Don't be afraid to miss me
Cause you can kiss me anytime
Boy when you're ready just give me a sign
We're wasting time cause I know

That wherever you go
I'll end up there too
And there's nothing you can do
And whatever you say
I'm gonna find a way
To win your heart

For every step that you'll take I'll take one with you
You can walk the world but I'll walk it too
Cause I know

That wherever you go
I'll end up there too
And there's nothing you can do
And whatever you say
I'm gonna find a way
To win your heart
