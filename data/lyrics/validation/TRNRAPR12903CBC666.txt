Shake that bubble (bubble, bubble)

Baby, baby you wanna
Baby, baby you gotta
Baby, baby you wanna
Shake that bubble tonight

('Cause it's a party)

'Cause it's the time
That the ladies all hit the club
And we're all leanin' out the line
'Cause we know who's at the door
I know you got your eyes set out on me
I'm breakin' for the dance floor, come with me
You got me screamin' o-oh!

Fly senorita, lookin' hot tonight
Back it on up and enjoy the ride
Shake it shake it shake that bubble tonight
Baby, shake that thing tonight, Oh!
Fly senorita, lookin' hot tonight
Back it on up and enjoy the ride
Shake it shake that bubble tonight
Baby, shake that thing tonight, Oh!

Shake that bubble (bubble, bubble)

'Cause you're the kind
Senorita, that's undefined
Makin' me lose track time
There's a party, pull the line
The ladies sayin' "Playboy, dance with me"
You know you shouldn't play your games with me
Let's hit the backseat, o-oh

Shake that bubble (bubble, bubble)

Fly senorita, lookin' hot tonight
Back it on up and enjoy the ride
Shake it shake it shake that bubble tonight
