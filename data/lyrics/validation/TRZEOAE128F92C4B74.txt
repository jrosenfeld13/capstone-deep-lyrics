Today is the greatest
Day I've ever known
I can't live for tomorrow
Tomorrow's much too long
I'll burn my eyes out, yeah
Before I get out

I wanted more
Than life could ever grant me
Bored by the chore
Of saving face

Today is the greatest
Day I've ever known
Can't wait for tomorrow
I might not have that long
I'll tear my heart out
Before I get out

Pink ribbon scars
I never forget
I tried so hard
To cleanse these regrets
My angel wings
Are bruised and restrained
My belly stings

Today is
Today is
Today is
The greatest day

I wanna turn you on
I wanna turn you on
I wanna turn you on
I wanna turn you on
