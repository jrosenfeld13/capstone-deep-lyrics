Does the shadow live forever?
Will this graveyard be the dance floor for these corpses?
Will they be the first to fall?
Dance the night away, dance the night away
Why do we do this to ourselves?
We're buying every word they sell, they sell
Starving loved ones, carry our guns
Take a look at what we've become
Hungry nations, standing in the ashes
Of our enemies' remains
Why do we do this to ourselves?
We're buying every word they sell
Why do we do this to ourselves?
We're buying every word that they sell, they sell
So we dance the night away
So we dance the night away
So we dance the night away
So we dance the night away
The night away
Why do we do this to ourselves?
We're buying every word they sell
Why do we do this to ourselves?
We're buying every word that they sell
Every word they sell, every word they sell
Every word they sell
