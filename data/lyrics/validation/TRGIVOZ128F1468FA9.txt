Used to be so easy
To give my heart away
But I found out the hard way
There's a price you have to pay

I found out that love
Was no friend of mine
I should have known
Time after time

So long, it was so long ago
But I've still got the blues for you

Used to be so easy
To fall in love again
But I found out the hard way
It's a road that leads to pain
I found out that love
Was more than just a game
Playing to win
But you lose just the same

So long, it was so long ago
But I've still got the blues for you

So many years since I've seen your face
But here in my heart there's an empty space
Where you used to be

So long, it was so long ago
But I've still got the blues for you

Though the days come and go
There is one thing I know
I've still got the blues for you
