It's all backward
It's all bad word
Said to me by you
How you misunderstand
All, wrapped up
In yourself
Fall, who will pick you up

Walking backward
This is my mistake, my mistake
This is my mistake, my mistake

I'm sorry dear
I wish I could
Read your mind
It's my fault, how I misunderstand
Now, don't go changing
Trying to please me

It will never work

Walking backward
This is my mistake
Always backward
This is my mistake, my mistake

I can
Feel this, next
Upcoming crisis will be our
Last one
I swear
I swear

Walking backward
Walking backward
Walking backward
This is my mistake
