[Verse 1]
I'm back on Broadway, I'm cruisin' for a love again
I'm back on Broadway, I'm cruisin' for a love again
I'm going down to 42nd Street, I'm going to find myself a friend

[Verse 2]
Oh baby, I don't know what to do
Oh baby, I don't know what to do
I ain't no mathematician baby, but I'd sure like to count on you

[Verse 3 - Outro]
I'm cruisin' for a love, but love is nowhere in sight
I'm cruisin' for a love, but love is nowhere in sight
I've got my mind made up baby
Gonna find, gonna find, gonna find me some lovin' tonight
