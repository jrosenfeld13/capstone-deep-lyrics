I've seen the pain before
Teardrops in their eyes
Others that we've torn
To take away their pride
I've felt the pain before
Tearing skin and bone
To evil we conform
Weakness we have known

[Chorus]
Feel the Pain

I've heard the pain before
Another hollow tie
To escape the cold
Whisperer of good-bye

I've held the pain before
The agony en masse
Melting arms to mourn
The beauty of the past

When I see the darkness below me
I hear the weeping of the damned
My spirit flies from the shadows
Into the forest that we share
Never shall the winds betray me
Only you will know me as I am
I turn from the eyes of winter
And cast away the burden that I bear...
I've seen the pain before circling our laughs
Like vultures whom we scorn
In the vengeance of our wrath
But somewhere in the black
Crystal hearts adorn
The wings of yeaterday
So I can be reborn
