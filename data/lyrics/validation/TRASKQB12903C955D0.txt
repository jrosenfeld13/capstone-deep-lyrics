Interference
Which way should I go?
I'm a wave don't you know
On the graph paper sea

Interference
Well since you're here
Maybe you could help me out
Cuz my minivans always breakin' down
And I'm wallowing in massive debt
Cuz college was the biggest scam
Cuz it teaches you what your money is
That its blood and waste and slavery
Then it cashes you're parents big checks
And says you owe us $40,000 plus interest
So go cash in on you're priviledge now
Or let your righteous heart bleed right out onto the floor cuz
Either way Either way Either way Either way you're our slave......slave

Interference
Should I twist up like a water twister
Leave behind a trail of
Blue and green bubbles
Monopoly houses
And form a huge shape
That they can't ignore
And feel huger than everything
But still be plagued by the doubt that I'm as small as a 2 liter bottle

Or maybe love a converse wave
And let graphs collide and motion die and I could know silence

Sometimes silence comes to me
Over cigarettes and tea
On my lovely balcony
