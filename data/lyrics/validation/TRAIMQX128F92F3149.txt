(J.P. Maunick / S. Grey)

People gather together where the love shines
And everyone is truly free
There's a light on the world for you and me

Trip around the world
Take a good look around, tell me what you see
Everyday people looking for love
Yes they are searching

There's nothing in the world
Nothing else to be found, that can compare
With the power of love
Everyday we are yearning

Now gather together
From every corner of the world
Let's open our minds to the light

Chorus:
People gather together where the love shines
And everyone is truly free
There's a light on the world for you and me
It's no mystery

Let it rain on me, yeah

Trip around the world
Take a good look around, tell me what you see
So much anger and pain, life's a game
That we're losing

Stop the masquerade
By the truth we are bound, and that's no lie
People crying for change
Everyday they are praying

Now gather together
From every corner of the world
Let's open our minds to the light

Chorus (x2)

Your love
Really wanna have it
Do you really dig it?
Really gotta get, get, get, get it

Chorus
