I spent years chasin' after
A restless wind callin' out my name
I was wild-eyed and crazy
With a spirit that could not be tamed
I had no direction
Lord knows that I've been lost a time or two
But fate was there to guide me
And lead me down the road to you

There've been other women
But all they did was occupy my time
There was always somethin' missing
That until you, I thought I'd never find
Thought I knew what I was lookin' for
But lookin' back I didn't have a clue
All the love that was waiting at the end
Of the road to you

It was worth the tears
And the long and lonely years
That I went through
Id relive the pain for the happiness I've gained
And all the love I've found in you

And when I hold you in my arms
There's nothing in this world I'd rather do
I just close my eyes and thank the Lord he led me
Down the road to you

It was worth the tears
And the long and lonely years
That I went through
I'd relive the pain for the happiness I've gained
And all the love I've found in you

I spent years chasin' after
A restless wind callin' out my name
