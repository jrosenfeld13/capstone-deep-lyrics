Gather 'round, ladies, gather 'round
Hear the news that's coming down
The ships are in and the sails are down
The boys are back in town

Get your skirts down off the rack
The boys are in and the boys are back
And no time now for takin' slack
The boys are back in town

Yeah the boys are back in town
Your true love can be found
Gather 'round the old playgound
The boys are back in town

They've been gone for quite a while
Man, it's good to see 'em smile
Now they're loaded up on style
The boys are back in town

Come in the house, get out of the cold
See 'em comin' down the road
Gonna raise some hell 'cause don't you know
The boys are back in town

Well the boys are back in town
Your true love can be found
Gather 'round the old playgound
The boys are back in town

Well the boys are back in town
Your true love can be found
Gather 'round the old playgound
The boys are back in town
