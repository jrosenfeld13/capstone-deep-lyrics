[Verse 1: Eric Bloom]
They held their heads
With laughs of pain
They'd learned from men
Who'd just refrain
From glancing at a mirror's face
Seven screaming diz-busters
Who lurk behind the rose
Cast iron for a bloodstream
And ice behind their eyes

[Chorus: Eric Bloom]
On each and all those holy nights
When duster's dust becomes the sale
And Lucifer!
The light, the light

[Verse 2: Eric Bloom]
They're long, so long
This time of year
When stars be crossed
By twirling fear
You don't suppose I'd prove surprised
Well seven screaming diz-busters
Should go the route and die
Without that warmth, they've learned to crave
With hardened smiles and evil signs (ah, well)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3: Eric Bloom]
Yeah, alright
Bury me near the secret cove
So they'll not know the way
Bury me round behind the rose
So they'll not rile my grave
I'll not reveal whose name's still lost

[Bridge: Eric Bloom]
Well their laughs of pain, ah ha ha ha!
And their harder smiles
And their rigid arms
And their evil signs
The longer days and the longer nights
Yeah, they're longer
They're longer still

[Chorus: Eric Bloom]
On each and all those holy nights
When duster's dust becomes the sale
And Lucifer!
The light

[Outro: Eric Bloom]
(Lucifer the light)
(Lucifer the light)
(Lucifer the light)

(Lucifer the light) Oh, the light
(Lucifer the light) I can't stand the light
(Lucifer the light) I can't stand it now
(Lucifer the light) No
(Lucifer the light) Can't stand the light
(Lucifer the light)
(Lucifer the light) Can't stand the light
(Lucifer the light) Can't stand the light
(Lucifer the light)
(Lucifer the light) Can't stand the light
(Lucifer the light) Oh no!
(Lucifer the light) Aahhh
(Lucifer the light)
(Lucifer the light) I can't, I can't
(Lucifer the light) No
(Lucifer the light) Can't stand it
(Lucifer the light) Can't stand it, no
(Lucifer the light) Can't stand it
(Lucifer the light) Can't
(Lucifer the light) Can't, I can't, I can't, can't, can't, can't stand it
(Lucifer the light)
(Lucifer the light) Just can't stand the light
(Lucifer the light) One
(Lucifer the light) Two
(Lucifer the light) Three
(Lucifer the light) Four
(Lucifer the light) Five
(Lucifer the light) Six
(Lucifer the light) And seven
