The mountain's coming
He's walking down your street
The mountain's coming
He's got wings on his feet
There's two suns in the sky today
And one's at your door
When you feed the mountain
He's gonna feed you some more

And then you know, know, know know know know
Know there's no time for heaven or hell, mm-mm
Just try to understand each other, baby
Down in that gravity well

Diablo's coming
He's gonna slap your face
He's gonna feed you shit for breakfast
He's gonna ask how it tastes
He's a little punk
And he loves when he wins
He wants you chubby
So he can make you thin

No no no, no no no no, no
No time for heaven or hell
Let's just try to understand each other baby
Down in that gravity well
Let's go

You're a little time bomb
You sure love your game
Your imagination is gonna
Drive me insane
I'm gonna join your circus
I'm gonna catch your train
You're making my cock like a pistol on my side baby
Upside your brain

And then I said
No, no, no no no no, no
Little time for heaven or hell
You understand me
Let's try to understand each other, baby
Down in that gravity well
Let's try to understand each other, baby
Down in the gravity well
