Got me livin the life
Got me livin the life
That I don't want to

[ L.A. Nash ]
Never knew life could be so fucked up with no God to call
Labelled us ills, big boys developed the hearts to ball
It seems the dreams we saw got burst
Lit up the ammunition, won the war ???? bodies back to the Earth
They say from war comes peace
I say in the streets of L.A. let it begin on every corner and streets
In the belly of the beast is where me and my enemies meet
Inhalin teflon shells until the death of me
And to you devils plottin now know this
Haven't forgotten my tactics, so when you shoot, don't miss, bitch
I know it's a sin to be suicidal
But the way you niggas and bitches is trippin today is like 'fuck the Bible'
No hesitation like ?????, nigga, no breath
Can escape Nash or the angel of death
Lost in a world where we all feel pain
The Lord keeps callin my name, so I escape again

You never know when it's yo time to go
Heaven or hell, freedom or jail, even die slow

Got me livin the life
That I don't want to

[ uncredited guest rapper ]
I praise God for relief, this life is hell
I'm trapped between jail cells and hell, felonies lately to stack mail
These niggas wanna see me or do they wanna be me
If I get it raw I draw heat like McGraw, feel me
Mama, without a coma, this G thuggin
Got me feeling like I'm addicted to all the drama
Don't know when I'mma touch the other side but I'mma ride
For all my niggas that died and all the tears you cried
But first things first, riders clown in this fast life
Aggravated thoughts got my bound by my past times
Mama cried, we try, every day spend gettin high
Money, bitches and jewels until we die
Now watch em fly, like a bird will have you ballin or get you cracked
Scandalous homies'll turn they back and have your ass jacked
It's a fact, niggas stack to be the mack
When it's on it's on, I bring the chrome, now watch em moan

You never know when it's yo time to go
Heaven or hell, freedom or jail, even die slow

Got me livin the life
That I don't want to

[ Young Prodeje ]
The streets got a young nigga cold
The streets'll make a young nigga old
Sell your soul to get parole
It didn't take a man to hold the heat and blast him off his feet
Where evil lurk we put in work and represent the street
I hit my knees but it burn cause I done touched the other side
Where we hellbound in a small town and the weak can't survive
Where my 9 to 5 is snatchin souls, fuckin bitches, buyin gold
Tellin my little homies if it's the life they wanna go
My nigga Lucifer'll keep it true to ya, all he want is your soul
But you don't need that, it don't matter where you go
So I'mma ball while I'm here, roam this western hemisphere
Livin this life I don't wanna live but I ain't ready to leave here

[ Prodeje ]
I almost lost my soul to the .44
So many niggas ficticious and quick to getcha if you don't know
Gotta beat the heartless, in Cali the foulest niggas'll fade you
Better watch your shit cause it be crackin somethin major
All my life I done ducked so many damn slugs
I felt em rippin through the walls as I prayed to the Lord
Nobody falls, so many homies fell though
And you can count the blood stains but they all got a different story to tell though

You never know when it's yo time to go
Heaven or hell, freedom or jail, even die slow

Got me livin the life
That I don't want to
