I
I will split you in two
Say, say move
I strike quickly being moved
You're all
You're all dogs

Yes, you're dogs of the house
A weak, weak
Weak, weak slave
A weak slave goes to the wall

Because I
I am
A pretty piece of flesh
I am
A pretty piece of flesh
I am
A pretty piece of flesh
I am
A pretty piece of flesh
I am

Go, go
Foes can never measure
To the crew as we roll on
Blast the amplifiers in the back with the soul on
A pretty piece of flesh
And yes, you better show your crest

Shoulder holster strapped
I'm pulling from the chest
Guess who's gonna be the first
To pull it from you
Butt of the steel seal
Representing Montague

Lovelorn
Torn from two sides
Singing of dark skies
And through the heavens
I be seeing worlds collide

Chi Chi
Bow stars and bottle rocket fantasies
But on the streets some knights
And killers they be after me
Tripping with Ethel under moonlight skies

But then you wake up in the danger zone
In souped-up rides
I'm dodging bullets and bang
It's hard to hang

Doing a hundred miles an hour
Like a video game
Rolling brick-thick and diesel
Thinking nothing can faze me
With nickel-plated swords swinging
Living is crazy

Stars collide
Worlds divide
With a pretty piece of flesh
Your little pretty piece of flesh

Stars collide
Worlds divide
With a pretty piece of flesh
Your little pretty piece of flesh

I am a pretty piece of flesh
I am
A pretty piece of flesh
I am
A pretty piece of flesh
I am
A pretty piece of flesh
I will split you in two

Say
Say move
I strike quickly being moved
You're all
You're all dogs
(Stars collide
Worlds divide
With a pretty piece of flesh)

Yes, you're dogs of the house
(Pretty piece of flesh)
A weak, weak, weak, weak slave
(Stars collide
Worlds divide
With a pretty piece of flesh)
A weak slave goes to the wall
(Pretty piece of flesh)

Because I
I am
A pretty piece of flesh
I am
A pretty piece of flesh
I am
A pretty piece of flesh
I am
A pretty piece of flesh
I am

Stars collide
Worlds divide
With a pretty piece of flesh
Your little pretty piece of flesh

Stars collide
Worlds divide
With a pretty piece of flesh
Your little pretty piece of flesh
