Take Care of your body
Your mind and your soul
To take time to give you
The attention you want

No special G items
Love and words on a cell
Little things you be needing
Girl, it shows that we gotta nag never

Never never that, never never that
I wouldn't do baby, never never that, no

Do you like it, do, no, oh, oh
See I don't get down like that
Give you all those private things, baby

See candlelight dinners
And hot bubble baths
Relieving your tension
Massaging your back

Girl, how did your day go?
We talk about then
A little time that we need
Girl, you'll never go back

Never never that, never never that
Never, never never that, no

Do you like it, do, no, oh, oh
I don't get down like that

Do you like it, do, no, oh, oh

See I don't get down like that
You'd be loved the way you're Supposed to be

If I was your man, you was my girl
We would be loving 'round the world
And you'd live in the life of luxury
One day go by without you next to me

Love without no lemony, nothing at all
Like an elevator girl, I'll come when you call
Up, down, in and out
From the favorite spot love it to the ground, ground

Do you like it, do, no, oh, oh
I don't get down like that

Do you like it, do, no, oh, oh
See I don't get down like that

Do you like it, do, no, oh, oh
I don't get down like that

Do you like it, do, no, oh, oh
See I don't get down like that

Do you like it, do, no, oh, oh
I don't get down like that

Do you like it, do, no, oh, oh
See I don't get down like that
