Babe, they say that this world is better than the last
I wouldnt know, I have no way of living in the past
Where once there was a garden the streets have overflowed
From the Golden Gates to the East Block states, you can hear creation groan
If there is a shining beacon out across the amber waves, it lies hidden on the teeming shores beneath the burned-out Chevrolets
And the eyes that scattered high-rise hope across the fruited plain see TVs glowing in the projects through the greasy windowpane

Baby, its a longbaby, its a long way down
Baby, its a longbaby, its a long way to fall
Baby, its a longbaby, its a long way down
Baby, its a longbaby, its a big world after all

Purple mountains majesty has ratings that are poor
History bows to coverage, moderation bows to more
Far side of the ocean is the far side of the tracks
All Gods children learn to build and learn to watch their backs
There are felons out in the prison yard imagining their release
And the free thank God for the atom bomb, the keeper of the peace
Another day, another chance to curse away the doubt
Another night, another thousand points of light go out

Baby, its a longbaby, its a long way down
Baby, its a longbaby, its a long way to fall
Baby, its a longbaby, its a long way down
Baby, its a longbaby, its a big world after all

Hypnotised and shuttled in the limousine of hate
Watching the scenery shatter in the brittle jaws of fate
Well, baby, Im just another fare; I dont make the rules
Id break them if I thought it would do you some good

Well, the diggers and the bankers, and the architects and fools got to work
You cant stop them with bitter tears and golden rules
Its a race to stay alive, baby, its lawyers, tax, and steel
Til the life that you are living is the thing you never feel
Babe, they say that this world is better than the last
I wouldnt know, I have no way of living in the past
Where once there was a garden, oh, the streets have overflowed
From the Golden Gate to the East Block state, you can hear creation groan

Baby, its a longbaby, its a long way down
Baby, its a longbaby, its a long way to fall
Baby, its a longbaby, its a long way down
Baby, its a longbaby, its a big world after all
Baby, its a longbaby, its a long way down
Baby, its a longbaby, its a long way to fall
Baby, its a longbaby, its a long way down
Baby, its a longbaby, its a big world after all
