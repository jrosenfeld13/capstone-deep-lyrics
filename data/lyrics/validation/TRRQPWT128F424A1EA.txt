You should never keep any envy
Against your brother, sister
Or even your greatest enemy
And if you do it, don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me, oh no
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me at all

Though i might be from worlds of poor
Back arise in poverty
Jah jah let them rule my destiny
Cause i've never yet dipped my hand in iniquity
Don't blame it on me
Don't try to belittle me

So a one thing can so easy
And these are the words of prophecy
What will be is got to be
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me
I'm not of that quality
Don't blame it on me, don't blame it on me

Poverty"cause people to live in misery
Sometime let them forget dem history
Tell them equal rights and justice stand for one and
All
And i will never ever like to see my brethren fall
There's a long book of life
And it's wide open
And whosoever name is not written there
Whosoever name is not written there
Sorry for you oh yea
Sorry for you oh i yea
Don't blame it on me
Don't try to belittle me
So a one thing can so easy and these are
The words of prophecy
What will be is got to be
Don't blame it on me. don't blame it on me;
I'm not of that quality
Don't blame it on me
