Shake, baby, shake, you know I can fit you in my arms
Brake, baby, brake, taking me in with all your charms

I've never been inside you but you're so alluring
They call you "little mouse" by name in Rome and Turin
Looking now at your famous shape
They don't make them like you anymore

Shake, baby, shake, you know I can fit you in my arms
Brake, baby, brake, taking me in with all your charms

When things are looking good there's always complications
I can't be with you so I'm at the railway station
Let's run away and be so alive
Escape the drudgery of this nine to five

Shake, baby, shake, you know I can fit you in my arms
Brake, baby, brake, taking me in with all your charms
Shake, baby, shake, how know I worship from afar
Brake, baby, brake, how I wish you were my car
Shake, baby, shake, you know I can fit you in my arms
Brake, baby, brake, taking me in with all your charms
Shake, baby, shake, shake, baby, shake
Shake, baby, shake, shake, baby, shake, I will
