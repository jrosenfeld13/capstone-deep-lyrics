[Chorus]
When you find me in the morning
Hanging on a warning
Oh... the joke is on you
You said you were pretending
Here's to unhappy endings
Oh... the joke is on you

[Verse 1]
To make sure yesterday doesn't repeat
I took a shortcut home, a left on the street
I know they won't find me here
I found out how to make mama proud
Be real quiet don't talk too loud
I try, try to disappear

[Chorus 2]
My life is for the taking
Breakdown is awaking me
I'm ending all this pain

[Chorus]
When you find me in the morning
Hanging on a warning
Oh... the joke is on you
You said you were pretending
Here's to unhappy endings
Oh... the joke is on you

[Verse 2]
This is my last day
Should have been my first kiss
Think to myself will I ever be missed
I hope... or maybe I don't care
I wear my team around my neck
I love them so much gonna love them to death
Tonight... see the world through my eyes

[Chorus 2]
My life is for the taking
Breakdown is awaking me
I'm ending all this pain

[Outro]
My great escape
Is my biggest mistake
I think you better turn around
Don't throw it away
Today... today
