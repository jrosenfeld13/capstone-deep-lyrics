The sun will die
On us tonight
The days are gone
For everyone

The holy cry
Forever night
What have we done?
Who killed the sun?

We will be on our knees
The time has come
Thy will be done
Holy men pray
Return the day
For our souls

How can we fight
This endless night?
Oh, lord Jesus
Will you save us?
