[Verse 1]
O come, all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold him
Born the King of angels

[Chorus]
O come, let us adore Him [x3]
Christ the Lord

[Verse 2]
Sing, choirs of angels
Sing in exultation
Sing, all ye citizens of heaven above
Glory to God
All glory in the highest

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
See how the shepherds
Summoned to his cradle
Leaving their flocks, draw nigh to gaze
We too will thither
Bend our joyful footsteps

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Yea, Lord, we greet thee
Born this happy morning
Jesus, to thee be glory given
Word of the Father
Now in flesh appearing

[Chorus]
