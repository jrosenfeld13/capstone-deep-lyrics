Souls, damned and deserted
Waiting for the lord to call
Sheep who lost their shepherd
Your God deceived you all
Look who he left in charge
The ill-conceived bastard son
Left to die on the cross
For what, for whom?
I am all sins

God Puppet
Religious disease
I hold the answers that you seek
Trade your life for an addiction
I'll drain your mind and fuck your soul
Spawned by the lord of darkness
And raised by the whore of the angels
I've been sent to rape you all
I am all sins
God Puppet!
God Puppet!

Sheep who lost their shepherd
Your God betrayed you all

(Go!)
God Puppet!
You fucking, God Puppets!
I am all sins
