Everyone's hand is on the switch, up above there's a leaden sky
Everyone's thinking of the switch, get ready, make someone cry
Ooh they all laughed when the Pope got on the phone
Ooh And the President pretends that he's not home

Everyone's hand is on the switch, while the cameras waited outside
Let's hope there is another hitch, last time the guy didn't die
Oooh while the nation is holding back its breath
OOh Mr Sullivan is holding, still to death??

And if you wanna get scared, look at that chair
Feel that power run through, ooh yeah

Everyone's hand is on the switch, come on people pull together now
Then we can go down to the beach, as the Florida sunshine comes out
Ooh where's the party, the soft drinks and the fudge
Oooh don't worry they'll be comin' soon, give that switch a nudge

And if you wanna get scared, look at that chair
Feel that power run through, ooh yeah

Everyone's hand is on the switch, what a swell execution!
Sweet revenge is such a bitch, dance to the execution!
Everyone's hand is on the switch
Everyone's hand is on the switch
