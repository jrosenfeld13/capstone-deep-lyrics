This night is silent as graves, we visit our own when we both see each other
Music shaking the walls, I'm shaking the hands of past and present lovers
Who am I to accuse, I'm looking for body heat to warm my frozen bones
Staying numb for a night in attractive strangers arms

Remember back in the day, we used to scream out loud we love each other
Then this miserable world just had to come along and steal our thunder
We would talk until 2, then we'd lay around until the morning came
Just as still as the stars that I'd capture on your whim

It's our biggest mistake, please don't say it again
It's our biggest mistake, please don't say it again

This night is silent as graves, we visit our own when we both see each other
Music shaking the walls, I'm shaking the hands of past and present lovers
Who am I to accuse, I'm looking for body heat to warm my frozen bones
Staying numb for a night in attractive strangers arms

It's our biggest mistake, please don't say it again
It's our biggest mistake, please don't say it again
It's the first step for us to make amends

And for crying out loud, we go so much in common
Maybe that's our fall from grace, maybe that's our fall from grace
And for crying out loud, we got nothing in common
Maybe that's our fall from grace, maybe that's our fall from grave

It's our biggest mistake
It's our biggest mistake
It's our biggest mistake, please don't say it again
It's our biggest mistake, please don't say it again
It's the first step for us to make amends
Yeah, it's the first step for us to make amends
