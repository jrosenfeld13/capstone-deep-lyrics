Breed as much as you can
Then send them to where sun goes down
Brainwashed from birth
Propaganda taught well

They are mingling slowly
Taking over the word
They have the clever blueprint
For your culture's apocalypse
Follow the sand trail
You know where it leads to
Your worst nightmare are
About to come true

Bite the hand that feeds you
After all you are the victim

They are mingling slowly
Taking over the word
They have the clever blueprint
For your culture's apocalypse
Follow the sand trail
You know where it leads to
Your worst nightmare are
About to come true

This is the end of the western
Civilization as you know it
One by one you will obey their
Laws and ways
You are the puppet at the circus
And their spit at you
You are already on your knees
Pathetic gutless west

Keep on screaming prejudice
As you put infidels to death
