Although my head looks frightening
Behind this ancient tomb
I woke the ones less hopeful
And told them to leave soon

They huddled in their wagons
Made out while they could
This place would kill a hundred
Turn life to ashen soot

Hand the hardship baby
We go to sleep and then we die

O layed out dead before her
Like a sacred text
I hoped she's bleed my body
For I knew she would be next

The sun would blister mountains
Reaching for the day
You touched my heart once dearly
Was all I heard he say

Hang the hardship baby
We go to sleep and then we die
