Hurry up, we're all ready
And all you need to bring is yourself
Gonna go slow, take it steady
'Cause there's no room for nobody else

BRIDGE:
Sun is high, sky is blue
It's so bright, we're just waiting for you
(we know what you're doin')
We know what to do

CHORUS:
Rev it up, I said (don't waste time)
We know where we're goin' (it's alright)
Rev it up no lead (the coastline)
Where the wind is blowin' (it so fine)2x

Hey.....

Give it up Mr. blue sky
Speeding right on into the bay
Everybody wave as we drive by
To the beach where we're gonna stay

BRIDGE

CHORUS

Hey Hey Hey
We know what to do

CHORUS

Hey Hey Hey
We know what you're doin'
We know what you're doin'
Rev it up no lead
We know what you're doin' (hey)
We know what you're doin' (hey)

Hey Hey Hey Hey

We know what to do
We know what to do

We know what to do(Repeat to fade)
