Yeah, Yeah, yeah

Sitting here alone
Thinking it through
Trying to convince myself
That I'm not losing you
Why can't you just forget the things I said
I was angry at that time
But now I've cleared my head

It was so strong
Where did it all go wrong

So tell me why
I'm swimming against the tide
I'm praying for a lifeline
Cos I'm losing you
So tell me why
You don't care enough to try
Are you giving up this fight?
I can't stand, won't stand
Losing you

You don't have to say a word
It's in your eyes
What can I do to convince you
We need more time
And i know I may have made a few mistakes
But losing you is just to much for me to take

It was so strong
Where did it all go wrong

So tell me why
I'm swimming against the tide
I'm praying for a lifeline
Cos I'm losing you
So tell me why
You don't care enough to try
Are you giving up this fight?
I can't stand, won't stand
Losing you

So tell me what to say
Because I need
A chance to change
And I won't let you walk away

So tell me why
I'm swimming against the tide
I'm praying for a lifeline
Cos I'm losing you
So tell me why
You don't care enough to try
Are you giving up this fight?
I can't stand, won't stand
Losing you
