If love was born in that fine April sky
And run unheeding when the sun was high
And slept as the moon sleeps through the autumn nights
While clear steady stars burn in their heights
If love so lived and ran and slept and woke again
And ran in beauty when each morning broke

Give me a sign
Give me a day tomorrow
So I can relive it with you
Give me a sign
Give me a dream to hold onto
So I can hope this ends good

In those old days I were called beautiful
But you have worn the beauty from my face
The flower like bloom has withered on my cheek
With the harsh years and the fire in my eyes
And the fire in my eyes

Never be adored
We will never be adored
