Swing was the thing long ago
Elvis was king long ago

But I'm constantly avoiding extremes
And dodging those absolutes
Singing the song in my head
Makes no sense at all

Fab were the four long ago
Jim closed the door long ago

But I'm constantly avoiding extremes
Dodging those absolutes
Whispering words in my head
Makes no sense at all

But I'm constantly avoiding extremes
And dodging those absolutes
Singing the song in my head
Makes no sense at all
