(Dickie Peterson & Tony Rainier)
The big trouble in Paradise
It's hot as Hell and I'm cold as ice
I hear it in your voice and I can feel it in the crowd
It's coming on strong and it's coming on loud
I see it in your face and I can see it in your eyes
You ain't living in no paradise
No paradise, Hey!

The big trouble in Paradise
It's hot as Hell and I'm cold as ice
I hear it in your voice and I can see it in your eyes
You ain't living in no paradise
The big trouble in Paradise
I'm not willing to pay the price
I hope you're happy and you're satisfied
You ain't lyin' in Paradise

You ain't enough and you broke on through
I never made it with a school with a fool
You came around now it don't matter when I'm home
I never think of it when it goes
The big trouble in Paradise
I'm not willing to pay the price
I hope you're happy and you're satisfied
You ain't lyin' in Paradise

The big trouble in Paradise
I'm not willing to pay the price
I hope you're happy and you're satisfied
You ain't lyin' in Paradise

The big trouble in Paradise
It's hot as Hell and I'm cold as ice
I hear it in your voice and I can see it in your eyes
You ain't living in no paradise
The big trouble in Paradise
I'm not willing to pay the price
I hope you're happy and you're satisfied
You ain't lyin' in Paradise!
Not at all, baby, You don't know!
