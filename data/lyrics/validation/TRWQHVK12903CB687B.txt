Motherfuckers and gentlemen
One in a million times
You get closer to something
Closer to something
You get closer and it slips away, yeah

Fading three dimensional ways
While flies buzzing around your head
I see you ghost-pale
Sucking up
To the black laced mirrors
Much like a sapphire

Wind-up angels
Wind-up gods
Wind-up big shots
And wind-up dolls
Aren't we all the same
On borrowed time here

The Grand prix of self destruction
Remember who you are
It's the effect you have on me
Sinistar

You're in a place you cannot escape
Oh well
It's your ninth circle of hell
Torn up inside
All torn up inside
It's your shadow and a great big L

The sapphire

The Grand prix of self destruction
Remember who you are
It's the effect you have on me
The Grand prix of self destruction
Remember who you are
It's the effect you have on me
Sinistar
