Your love is strange
But you're not to blame
Oh, baby
Baby, yeah
Your enchanted love
Makes me fly like a dove
Soft clouds
Blue sky, oh, yeah
And I will always love you, girl
No matter what you do
For a lifetime
I'll take you away
Oh, love's so strange
Ah, but who's to blame?
'Cause I feel that we can make it, girl
And our love is helping special now
I can see the magic in you
Created just for two
Hey, hey, girl, what a love
We both seem very aware
That we're living on a prayer
Oh, baby, we're living on a prayer
And I will always love you, girl
No matter what you do
For a lifetime
I'll take you away
Oh, love's so strange
Ah, but who's to blame?
'Cause I feel that we can make it, girl
And our love is helping special now
All of my lovin' and kissin' and huggin', girl
Oh, sugar
You got my love
But how was a new frown steak
The farming just for you
Hey, hey, girl
Hey, girl
So take a trip with me
Let's explore our fantasies
Of love, baby
Of love, baby
And I will always love you, girl
No matter what you do
For a lifetime
I'll take you away
Oh, love's so strange
Ah, but who's to blame?
And I know that we can make it, girl
And our love is real, it's helping now
Hey, hey
Ahaha
Ooohooo
Ohohoho
