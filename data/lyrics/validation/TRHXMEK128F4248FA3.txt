[Verse 1]
I'll stare into the sun
To try to find some kind of meaning
Who will save us now?
Am I the only one
Who gives a fuck if I'm still breathing?
I'm done believing
I'm grabbing for the gun
To take away this pain I'm feeling
All remains the same
Our fight has just begun
The wolves are fucking circling us
We're planning our escape
For only a moment

[Chorus]
How can we go on
If we're already broken?
How can we be strong
If there's no place left to go?
Can we fight for something more
When all our faith is dead and gone?
If we're already broken
How can we go on?

[Verse 2]
We say that we're alive
But all I see are empty coffins
Calling out our names
We fall into the night
With nothing but our heads in our hands
Lying here awake
For only a moment

[Chorus]
How can we go on
If we're already broken?
How can we be strong
If there's no place left to go?
Can we fight for something more
When all our faith is dead and gone?
If we're already broken
How can we go on?

[Chorus]
How can we go on
If we're already broken?
How can we be strong
If there's no place left to go?
Can we fight for something more
When all our faith is dead and gone?
If we're already broken
How can we go on?
