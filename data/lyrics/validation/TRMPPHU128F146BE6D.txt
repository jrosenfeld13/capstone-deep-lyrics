There's a song in your head
It's a mystery in there
There's a note you carry
Living holy, so no one knows me

I'm the ghost at your side
It's your conscience you hide
Lying long in the heat
Living holy, so no one knows me

It's not too hard
Anything goes
Anything goes in loving war
You should've seen what
We were like before

Doesn't make you feel good
Living holy, so no one knows me
It's not too hard
Anything goes now
Anything goes now

But it makes me cry
I've seen the truth through your eyes
There's a song I'll sing
If I'm allowed
All this fucked up shit
You've been talking about
Well I'm trying
But not too hard
Anything goes

Come on!

It's not too hard
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes now
Anything goes
And I said ooohhh
