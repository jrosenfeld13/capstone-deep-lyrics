[Verse 1]
Try to turn it off
But it's hard to see
Through this emptiness
Slowly breaking me
Maybe hurt me just a little less
Then I can start to breathe
But still your heart is out of reach

[Chorus]
What were we thinking
And what will we do now
Ah ha
Right now
Right now
Right now
Ooh ooh

[Verse 2]
The sun hasn't shined today at all
A funny thing
You haven't called
Tell me why
Or should I be asking?
How would I respond to it all
Times were good
I wish you were around more
I can feel you at my door
But it's not you
It's someone else
What can I do
Ooh, what did we do

[Chorus]
What were we thinking
What were we thinking
What were we thinking
Right now
Right now
Right now

[Verse 3]
Try to turn it off
But it's hard to see
Through this emptiness
Slowly breaking me
Maybe hurt me just a little less
Then I can start to breathe
But still your heart is out fo reach

[Chorus]
What were we thinking
What can we do now
Right now
Right now

[Verse 4]
Try to turn it off
But it's hard to see
Through this emptiness
Slowly breaking me
Maybe hurt me just a little less
Then I can start to breathe
But still

[Outro]
I should have known
It was right in front of me
Screaming girl just walk away
See it can't ever be
Oh, what would we do now
We carried on making our mistakes
Thinking our love was free
Now you've taken part of me
Right now
