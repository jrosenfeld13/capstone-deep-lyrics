I
Everybody wants to hear
The music in my head
The price I pay is too much
And I'm winding up in debt
So if you don't mind
I think I'm gonna stay home
I am getting older now
I have no need to roam
I just need a good home
II
Everybody wants to know
Do I remember what I think
About revolution, mind pollution
The kind of books I drink
After one last look around
I believe that I might like to
Settle down in a relaxing town
III
All we ever get to see are the rednecks
And the revolution crazies
Let's rent out Soldier's Field
And have Jerry Rubin versus Mayor Daley
For the benefit of peace
Admission is free
We can all stay home and
Watch it on TV
Call it the superscede
