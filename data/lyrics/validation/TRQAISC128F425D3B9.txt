[Chorus]
I know how it feels
You've been hurt so bad
I know how it feels
You've been hurt so bad

*talking over chorus*
Are you ok?
I want you to know that you can talk to me about anything, anytime
I couldn't help but notice that something was wrong
And by the look in your eyes, it's no suprise, it can only be one thing

Don't think I know what I'd do, it hurt before just like you
Even the best get depressed, still loneliest loneliness
Got so much on my chest, that I can't rest
And I'm sleepless and I keep this a secret
Only the girl I wanna be with doesn't see it, can't believe it
Doesn't need this so she's leaving, I'm the reason
I still love her for all seasons, I'm in pieces
Turn my frown upside down so no one sees this, I mean this

[Chorus]

*talking over chorus*
I know how it feels
But there's really nothing you can do
There's someone for everyone
And maybe he's just not the one for you

Beware of the danger at the fork in love's road
Sick in bed feeling cold and alone, please come back home
Sometimes I feel I should just let her go
If she comes back to me she's meant for me
Will she love someone instead of me
The intensity is killing me
You don't want this misery
How will it be, is this the way it feels to be destroyed
That's what I did to her, that's what she did to me
I'm thinking of her, and I'm hoping that she's missing me
You feeling me

[Chorus]

*talking over chorus*
I know, I know
Every smiling face ain't a happy one
And everybody is somebody's fool
And you're no exeption to the rule
I know

[Bridge]
This is real
Give me a hand
Baby, baby, baby
And I'll make you understand
That baby this is so real

*talking over bridge*
Staying up late at night
Play my records till I just don't wanna hear them anymore
Reminicing on all of the times we had, you know

Memories of long ago, love letters let her know
Words of love so meaningful, I just can't see her go
It's gonna take a miracle, torture and sadness
Paired when I'm lonely drives me insane, I wish things were the same
She doesn't know how bad it kills me inside
Hide the tears behind my eyes, won't show through my pride
With a touch that warms me through and through
I know how it feels, I know what you're going through
There's nothing you can do, I feel for you, I truely do

[Chorus]

*talking over chorus*
Cuz I know, I know
I know, I know
Can't sleep at night
Got no appetite
But everything's gonna be alright
I know
