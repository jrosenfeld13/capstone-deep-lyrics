Sinking
With nothing left to hold
When you've lost your old friends
You'll be out in the cold
Cause you can't hear
What I'm getting across
Every time I see you fall
I know that' you're lost it hurts
To see you hurt yourself
But you won't listen
So I can't help it hurts
To lose a good friends
But everything in life
Has an end
I see where you're headed
But I stand helpless
All the efforts I've made
Look so useless
You're chained
To the crumbling ground below
But I still care
And got to let you know it hurts
To see you hurt yourself
If you'd start listening
Then I could help it hurts
But your wounds will heal
Believe me, I know how it feels to lose
