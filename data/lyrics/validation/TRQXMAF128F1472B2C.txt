Why must I be the thief?
Why must I be the thief?
Oh Lord please won't you tell me
Why must I be the thief?
Why must I be the thief?
He said to the hanging man
And how come you're the only one
Who's a beggar, that always stares?

Why must I be the thief?
He asked of the hanging man
And how come you're the only one
Who lived with an open hand?
Well why must I be the thief?
He cursed and then he cried
And the hanging man put out his hand
And looked beyond his eye

And the thief he climbed that cross
To share that other's fate
But the Jesus man said "Not now
My brother, not now, it's far too late"

Far too late
Far too late
Far too late
Far too late
Far too late
Far too late
Far too late

Do what you must
Take what you can
Steal the pride from every heart
Every angered man
Every angered man
Every angered man

I am the thief
I am the thief
And you may run
Yes, and you may hide
But I will get you yet
Yes I will
Because of you, 'cause it's just your pride
Just your pride!

Pride!, Pride!
Pride!, Pride!
Pride!, Pride!
Pride!, Pride!

And I will get you yet
Cos it's just your pride
I will get you yet
It's just your pride
I will get you yet
It's just your pride!
