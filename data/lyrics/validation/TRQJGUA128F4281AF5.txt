I saw it coming to town
Covered everyone with a dark cloud
I knew why they couldn't see it
Guess what they sold to buy it?
My two eyes
What a prize
What they see is mine
I moved to another town
Thankfully not followed by a dark cloud
I'd fallen in love with you
Freedom was coming
In the afternoon sky, blue and pale
Catchin' flight with a softer sail
