My baby came in a a plane last night
I went down to meet her but I had the wrong flight
Yea the man at the desk said that she wasn't due
He said, "She wouldn't been in for an hour or too"
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
We waited, we waited until I broke
I thought to myself, "This must be a joke"
I went up to the desk and said, "Look here man
What time did you say my baby's gonna land?"
Well he looked at his book and he said, "Hey sport
You got the right plane baby but the wrong airport"
I finally got to see my baby you see
A half an hour later she was laying next to me
She was lookin' real good and she sounded alright
You know my baby knocked me around and she found a fight
Outta sight
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
