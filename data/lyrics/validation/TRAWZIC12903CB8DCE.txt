Lying here in this flower meadow
Feeling free
Hovering on a cloud
Worries vanished

Looking down on
These people
Do they deserve
This grief

All those people
Gathered arround me
Looking down on me
With dismaling faces

Why expose them to this hurt
This is not the solution-
Wake me........

Longing immensely for something
My life seeems unfullfilled
Secrets I camt reveal
Thoughts tears and sears in me
Makes me hate immensely
Renders into insecure soul

One day this enormous grief
Drifts away
One day this scorching grief
Drifts away
One day this dreadful grief
Drifts away

Wake me........
