Theres a man Ive seen in polaroids hes me in my own past
Lost and wild and unaware how things can change so fast
When a love like yours comes rescuing you find out who your not
And Im not him and hes not me he dont have what I got
So just to keep myself in line I say out loud from time to time
Girl Id miss that rose tattoo
Holding you close lying next to you
Id hate to think who would I be if you werent loving me
Hes one sad and lonely fool thats all he is without you
Ive been him and never again cause hes not me
Hes walking through my yesterdays with heavy anger in his heart
And thats right where he belongs
Because he and I are worlds apart
A wise man never stands alone and now I know if you were gone
Chorus
Bridge
So just to keep myself in line
I say out loud from time to time
Chorus
