True my love, but cold the wind
That howls against the cabin door
Sweet the night, but cruel the day
That comes to take my love away

The fire-light now flickering down
Across the room, the sickle moon
Casting slim and faint reprieve
Upon my love, still fast asleep

Darkness, darkness bind him to me
Hide him in your velvet cloak
Come the dawn he'll rise and go
A-marching to Fenario

Brave my love, but false the King
False his wars, and false his dawn
Damn the gray that gains the sky
Damn the sun, the King's cold eye

Darkness, darkness bind him to me
Hide him in your velvet cloak
Come the dawn he'll rise and go
A-marching to Fenario

Stay, O sweet, and do not rise
The light that shines comes from thine eyes
The day breaks not, it is my heart
Because that you and I must part

Darkness, darkness bind him to me
Hide him in your velvet cloak
Come the dawn he'll rise and go
A-marching to Fenario
