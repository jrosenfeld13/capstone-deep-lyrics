[Chorus: Leadbelly & Crowd]
We're in the same boat, brother
We're in the same boat, brother
And if you shake one end
You're gonna rock the other
Its the same boat, brother

[Verse 1: Leadbelly]
Oh, the Lord looked down from his holy place
Said, "Lordy me, what a sea of space
What a spot to launch the human race"
So he built him a boat for a mixed up crew
With eyes of black and brown and blue
So that's how come that you and I
Got just one world with just one sky

[Chorus: Leadbelly & Crowd]
We're in the same boat, brother
We're in the same boat, brother
And if you shake one end
You're gonna rock the other
Its the same boat, brother

[Verse 2]
So the boat rolled on through storm and grief
Of a many a rock and many a reef
What kept them goin' was a great belief
So they had to learn to navigate
That human race was special freight
If they didn't want to be in Jonah's shoes
They'd better be mates on this here cruise

[Chorus: Leadbelly & Crowd]
We're in the same boat, brother
We're in the same boat, brother
And if you shake one end
You're gonna rock the other
It's the same boat, brother

[Verse 3]
Oh, the boiler blew somewhere in Spain
Oh, the keel was smashed in far Ukraine
And the steam poured out from Oregon to Maine
Oh, it took some time for the crew to learn
What is bad for the bow ain't good for the stern
If a hatch takes fire in China Bay
Pearl Harbor's decks gonna blaze away, 'cause

[Chorus: Leadbelly & Crowd]
It's same boat, brother
We're in the same boat, brother
And if you shake one end
You're gonna rock the other
It's the same boat, brother
One more
It's same boat, brother
It's the same boat, brother
And if you shake one end
You're gonna rock the other
It's the same boat, brother
