[Verse 1]
When lights go down, I see no reason
For you to cry, we've been through this before
In every time, in every season
God knows I've tried
So please don't ask for more

[Chorus]
Can't you see it in my eyes?
Though this might be our last goodbye
Carrie
Carrie
Things they change my friend
Woh ohh
Carrie
Carrie
Maybe we'll meet again
Somewhere, again

[Verse 2]
I read your mind with no intentions
Of being unkind, I wish I could explain
It all takes time
A whole lot of patience
If it's a crime, how can I feel no pain?

[Chorus]
Can't you see it in my eyes?
Though this might be our last goodbye
Carrie
Carrie
Things they change my friend
Woh ohh
Carrie
Carrie
Maybe we'll meet again
Somewhere, again
[Instrumental]

[Chorus - Var. 1]
Ohh
Can't you see it in my eyes?
Though this might be our last goodbye
(Ohh ho ho)
Ohh
Carrie
Carrie
Ohh, things they change
Carrie, Carrie, Carrie
(Ohh ho ho)
Carrie
Carrie
Maybe we'll meet again
Oh, somewhere again

[Outro]
When lights go down
