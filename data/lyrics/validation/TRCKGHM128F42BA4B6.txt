It's time to begin
Start out over again
What you is, what you been
Forget everything

All the love that you made
All the joy and the pain
All the anger and hate
Rewind and erase

Rewind and erase
Rewind and erase

Protect and survive
You're better alive
Take a step to the side
Relax and revive

Relax and revive
Relax and revive

Turn it on, listen in
Turn it on, listen in

It's easy to change
And go out and get a new name
Forget yesterday
Tap your troubles away

Tap your troubles away
Tap your troubles away

Tap your troubles away
