[Intro]
Yo, yo, reverb
Be-ba-doom, yo, feel that bassline Cap
Yo, yo that's some, that's some like, Stanley Kubrick
Stanley Kubrick

[Verse 1]
The track bouncy, nobody get more rowdy
Than Suffolk County, peace to Crackhead Crowley
Honky Thomas, Cat McGlaughling, the whole crew
Cab Morada, what you gon' do, we roll through?
Fuck that, Big Earth, the midget face drop 'em
Bring em to the Port Jeff house stayed on top 'em
Nobody move this, I don't give a fuck, we untouched
Strictly lust for papers and live life to bust nuts
We're God killers, let's be realistic
We probably gon' be punished
We fucking bitches by the hundreds
Why me? Wanna fight me? Try me
Why these people don't know me, don't like me?
Society, they wanna see me dead I stick out
You see me in the public, I probably pull my dick out
Smack the fuck out of women, see me knock your bitch out
Do something tough guy, who the fuck wanna die?
Clash of the Titans, broken bottles, bar fighting
You wanna battle I'mma freestyle you can start writing
I can do that, tip the bouncers, make sure we get our gats in
The club just in case the action
Everybody want it, try to take my title
Let's see, left your chest messy, test me
Stanley Kubrick, don't stress me
R.A. the Rugged Man, remember the name, Rugged Man!

[Hook]
Ride with us (Rugged O the Bitch Beater)
Ride with us (Suffolk County, Long Island)
Ride with us (Dead broke black people)
Ride with us (Dead broke white people)
Ride with us (My man Smoothe Da Hustler)
Ride with us (Rest in peace Jason Edmunds)
Ride with us (Gordon Heights, ghostland)
Ride with us

[Verse 2]
Aiyyo the R-to-da, A-to-da, Rugged
Now think about this, who diss us? Suffolk County
Cops frisk us, their handcuffs never fit us
Our wrists turn purple, that's why we act vicious
Plus if we die tomorrow, won't nobody miss us
Get half a page in The Source maybe, if that
It's a whole town of people acting shady, where I live at
We spit lyrically releasing, you don't stop
Ain't nobody ceasing til your heartbeat stop beating, bring it
You know where to find me, acting like you looking for me
You saw me you walked right by me
A true test, the Rugged Man, the tru-est
The most violent, in the U.S., we see you stressed
Now take it easy, Fat Man greasy, sloppy
Peace to Khadafi, I'mma do this
They tried to stop me, way back in nine-four
You look into my future, I'mma probably die poor
We proud to be the lowest, low life losers
We flip your car over like Long Island steroid abusers
When they 'roid raging, white boy caning
Let me do some explain, misbehaving
Rugged Man, hairy fat slob, unshaven
The Ten Commandments, we constantly disobeying

[Hook]
Ride with us (Dirty crusty asses)
Ride with us (The whole Infamous Mobb)

Ride with us (Rugged...)
