I've been running for too long, and now its time to right my wrongs
So listen to what I have to say, might even help you out some day
Be true to yourself and others, be one with your sisters brothers

Free yourself now, from all that ties you down
Free yourself now, when all is said and done

Why should I run if I can stay, and rest my head now where it lay

But when your thoughts start to spin around, don't look back just stand your ground
Take my hand and walk this way, into a brand new brighter day

Free yourself now, from all that ties you down
Free yourself now, when all is said and done

It's been so long since I've felt safe, and now all we have is hate
So lets turn it upside down, and free yourselves now

Free yourself now, from all that ties you down
Free yourself now, when all is said and done
