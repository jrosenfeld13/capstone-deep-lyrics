Ooh where have you been
I've been missing you
I've really been missing you
How am I gonna prove
This ain't no line
This is all for real
This is how I feel inside
Slap my face I've just received a wake up call
Seen the meaning of it all
It sucks but how it is real
I've failed, no wonder I'm in vain
Everthing is true, this song was ment for you

Ooh I
I guess I got scared when I went out up there
Well you know me, well you know me
I, I guess I got scared when I went out up there
Well you know me, well you know me

It's the fool in me that forgets everytime
It's the state of concience that makes me go blind
We are both the passionate one left behind
We are gathered here I'll be staying this time

Ooh I
I guess I got scared when I went out up there
Well you know me, well you know me
I, I guess I got scared when I went out up there
Well you know me, well you know me

Instrumental part

Ooh I
I guess I got scared when I went out up there
Well you know me, well you know me
I guess I got scared when I went out up there
Well you know me, well you know me

Ooh I
I guess I got scared when I went out up there
Well you know me, well you know me
I guess I got scared when I went out up there
Well you know me, well you know me
