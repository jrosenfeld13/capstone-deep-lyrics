[Intro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh

[Verse 1]
My, how you've grown
I think I'll call you on the telephone
And tell you all the things that I've been missing
Oh-oh
Turn out the lights
Where we're going, we don't need 'em tonight
We're at your daddy's home, but he's not listening

[Chorus]
You make me crazy when you
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
Like, like, like, like, like
That, that, that, that, that, that
I might go crazy when you
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
Like, like, like, like, like
That, that, that, that, that, that
You know I love it when you
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
Like, like, like, like, like
That, that, that, that, that, that
Yeah, girl, I'm crazy when you
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
Like, like, like, like, like
That, that, that, that, that, that
You make me crazy when you

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Our time has come
Start of the race and we're ready to run
We're on a roll tonight and y'all won't fight it
Don't like what you see?
Send 'em a memo, tough titties
They ought to try some time, they might just like it

[Chorus]
You make me crazy when you
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
Like, like, like, like, like
That, that, that, that, that, that
I might go crazy when you
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
Like, like, like, like, like
That, that, that, that, that, that
You know I love it when you
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
Like, like, like, like, like
That, that, that, that, that, that
Yeah, girl, I'm crazy when you
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
Like, like, like, like, like
That, that, that, that, that, that
You make me crazy when you

[Bridge]
Oh-oh

[Chorus]
You make me crazy when you
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
Like, like, like, like, like
That, that, that, that, that, that
I might go crazy when you
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
Like, like, like, like, like
That, that, that, that, that, that
A little scary when you
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
Like, like, like, like, like
That, that, that, that, that, that
But kid, I love it when you
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
Like, like, like, like, like
That, that, that, that, that, that
You make me crazy when you
