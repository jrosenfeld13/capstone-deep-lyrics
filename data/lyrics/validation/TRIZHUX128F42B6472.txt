Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah

I put the sun back in your life
Made the wrong seem right
And that is why you love me

You made the beautiful seem plain
Leave me sheets to change
And that is why I love you

I'm naturally red don't you know
Been on TV and once I was up for Vogue
Been interviewed by every Tom Dick and Harris
Living on the side of Paris

I put the moon back in your life
Made the future bright
And that is why you love me

You put the magic in my tricks
You're my morning fix
And that is why I love

Cos it's not the way that I wear my hear
And I like to sleep in my underwear
Could it be the way that I spell my name
Could it be my weakness for Michael Caine

Expelled from all of the best schools
You failed with them but to me you're no fool
You dress yourself in tailored suits and blue addidas
Driving sixties Porsche two-seaters

I put the sun back in your life
Made the wrong seem right
And that is why you love me

You make a psychopath seem sane
When he's naked in the rain
And that is why I love you

Cos it's not the way that you make me laugh
When you put my hairdryer in the bath
Could it be the way that you love to please
When I've got your hand wrapped around my knees
Cos it's not the way that I park my car
Could it be the fact that I live on Mars
Could it be the way that I cut off drugs
Could it be I make you a little crazy

Yeah
