Ooh la la la, let's go dancin'
Ooh la la la, reggae dancin'
Ooh la la la, let's go dancin'
Ooh la la la, reggae dancin'

I went down to the park
Everything was dark, oh yeah
All of a sudden on came the lights
And everything was feelin' right

The people started dancin'
They call me over to join in
They said, "JT don't you feel good man?
Come on and join the reggae jam"
I heard them singin'

Ooh la la la, let's go dancin'
Ooh la la la, let's go reggae dancin'
Ooh la la la, let's go dancin'
Ooh la la la, reggae dancin'

I wanna get to know you
Come on, let's reggae down, oh yeah
Get better acquainted
So that everything will be fine, hey baby

Hey baby, what's your name?
Is it a missis or is it miss, eh?
If you're by yourself, I'd like to take you for a ride
We could check the scene and we can reggae down
And we'll be singing

Ooh la la la, let's go dancin'
Ooh la la la, we are reggae dancin'
Ooh la la la, let's go dancin'
Ooh la la la, reggae dancin'

Ooh la la la, ooh, let's go dancin'
Get your dancin' shoes, get your dancin' shoes
Reggae dancin'
Ooh la la la, ooh, let's go dancin'
Go get your dancin' shoes, get your dancin' shoes
Reggae dancin'

It's a special occasion, such a happy occasion
It's a special occasion, such a happy occasion
It's a special occasion, such a happy occasion
