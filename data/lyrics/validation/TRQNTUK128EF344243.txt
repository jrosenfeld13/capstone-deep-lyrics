Verse 1

Nothing compares to, life I have in You
Nothing of this world satisfies
So, I want to let go, I want to let You know
All that I have to give is Yours

Here I am, as gold to the fire
I will surrender to Your hand
To this place
Lord, I have come ready for Your touch

Chorus:
It's all for You
It's all for You
I'm letting go
I'm letting go

Verse 2

What is it in me, that hangs on for so long?
Why do I fight the tears that come?
I work so hard to, keep in control when
Al that I want is to let go

Chorus

I'll take this life
And lay it down
I'm letting go
My hopes and dreams
Here at Your feet
I'm letting go
I'm letting go

And I am ready for Your life
And I'm ready for You now
