There are moments that I am unable to breathe
The pain is strangling me
I shake my fist at the sky
Then fall down on my knees
Screaming how can this be
I think that I'd rather die
Than go on feeling so bad so sad so mad

(Chorus:)
Then I remember
How I felt when you'd smile
And I remember we had it all for a while
Just when I think I can't face one more day
And go on, the way I should
I remember, I remember something good

Piece by piece is how I gather
My broken heart
The jagged edges are sharp
I can't look in your eyes I can't feel your sweet touch
And it's tearing me up
Every minute that I'm here is one more
Without you I need you why you

(Chorus:)
Then I remember how you'll always live inside me
And I remember it's your love that carries me
Just when I think I can't face one more day
And go on the way I should
I remember, I remember something good

Just when I think I can't face one more day
And go on the way I should
I remember, I remember something good
