Nothing he came to believe
Of what you decided last night
Still the sun shines
Hits my sheild and ignites
We're Gonna Rise
The Sun shines
We're gonna rise
Feel a light on my face
Out of rank
Out of range
No counsel, no grand strategy
No sword to fall on
No ????????????????????
Just a light on my face
WE'RE GONNA RISE
Feel a light on my face
We're gonna rise
Feel the Light on my face
Out of rank, out of range
Speak of a man's great thoughts
I'll tell the story
Or not
Nothing he came to believe
Of what you decided last night
Still the sun shines
The sun shines
We're gonna rise
Feel the light on my face
We're gonna rise
Feel the light on my face
