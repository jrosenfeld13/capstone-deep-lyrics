I was sleeping soundly once upon a night
When I had a simple dream
There you were not saying a word
All I heard was our heart beating
You were bent on picking apples from the apple tree
When you glanced my way
With a hand you blocked the sun from your eyes and
Smiled an everlasting smile
It was so unfortunate
That my alarm clock told me
You're just a dream
You're just a dream
You're just a dream
But I'd just love to make you real
You're just a dream
You're just a dream
You're just a dream
But I'd just love to make you real
Next night I saw the end of
Bloody miscommunication
All the sides they
Dropped their weapons and they
Drooped their heads in shame and clarity
All of us who watched from the sidelines
Breathed a sigh
Then I awoke and saw the paper with the people dying on the cover
You're just a dream
You're just a dream
You're just a dream
But I'd just love to make you real
But I'd just love to make you real
I was sleeping soundly once upon a night when I had a simple dream
