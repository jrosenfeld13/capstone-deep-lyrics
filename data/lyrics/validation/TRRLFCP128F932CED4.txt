Its easy for love
To come and go
(Yes, it is, yes, it is)
For one to be thrilled
Just one time
(One or more, one or more)
Oh, when, when tomorrow comes
Will the need still be there?
(When tomorrow will come to find us)
I wanna know will you still care?
Will your love for me be the kind of love
(That will last)
I wanna know
(Will it last?)
When you reach out to hold
Tomorrow will you reach out?
(Twice as fast)
How many times?
(Twice as fast)
Oh, when, when tomorrow comes
Will your kisses still be hot? Oh, baby
(When tomorrow comes to find us)
Will you still want the love Ive got?
This is what Im tryin to say
(I dont want just a one day lover)
No
(Today with me and tomorrow with another)
What I want is an everyday man
To prove that he loves me anyway he can
Love me, come on, baby
I know youre a lover
Dont leave me tomorrow
Stay with me
I want you to thrill me, want me
Love me, need me, touch me
Stay right here
Dont hurt me, baby
Oh, no
Dont make me cry
No, no
