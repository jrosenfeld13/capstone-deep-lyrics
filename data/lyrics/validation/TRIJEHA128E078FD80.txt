"This elevator only takes one down", she said "This place, this hotel lounge, it's my daily
Bread, but I'm underfed" He asked, "Are you living in the night?
Cause I can tell you have a lousy imagination
And as a matter of speaking I hate this situation
But it happens to be one of my pickin'"
Cause it's so hard, to keep the dream alive
Cause if it all comes down to this, how will
You move me, you move me, you move me round and round, I guess
Take it back your analogue, it's on the other side of this
You move me, you move me, you move me round and round, I guess
Take it back your analogue, it's on the other side of this
Cause if it all comes down to this, how will
And then she said, "And have another cigarette"
I tend to forget
And hoisted the flag but it keeps hanging down
"You know this place, this hotel lounge
It's my life, it's my choice
And I'm in love with Ricky Lee Jones' voice"
Cause it's so hard to keep the dream alive
And if it all comes down to this, how will
You move me, you move me, you move me round and round, I guess
Take it back your analogue, it's on the other side of this
You move me, you move me, you move me round and round, I guess
Take it back your analogue, it's on the other side of this
You move me, you move me, you move me round and round, I guess
Take it back your analogue, it's on the other side of this
You move me, you move me, you move me round and round, I guess
Take it back your analogue, it's on the other side of this
You move me, you move me, you move me round and round, I guess
Take it back your analogue, it's on the other side of this
And if it all comes down to this
"This elevator only takes one down", she said, "this place in this same hotel"
Do you see that man in the left-hand corner
Do you see that woman their love-story's famous
