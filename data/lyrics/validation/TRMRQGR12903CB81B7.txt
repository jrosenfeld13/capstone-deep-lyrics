[Matisyahu]

(Hook)
Rock when I rip it when I'm rollin' on clouds
Shout loud breathe in, won't you drown in the now

[Repeat Hook 2x]

Said I rock when I rip it when I'm rollin' on clouds
Shout loud breathe in, won't you drown in the now

Starship ripping through the night
Tripping through your sights
Pop up and shadow when I pine through the blind
Seen shades of rays as they move through the space
We lace, we up concrete streets
Streaks tall paintbrush strokes
Oh so gloriously
Story unfolds which one will be told
Some get sold, some just fold
Multi beings releasing parallel songs
Swells to break all the dry spells
Late bells ring crack shells
(When they got us)
Righteousness love of life will prevail
Righteousness love of life will prevail
Righteousness love of life will prevail

Take the message that you send with these vibrations
From the hearts of the young consolidations

Some of the hearts gone numb
Improve the situation
With the vision of the king
I rely on mountains
With Assad and mic in my hand
I stand for the scene of sand
Mountains climb around them

[Hook 3x]

Move like the misses to kiss this style
When ya dance in the darkness the quiet shout

[Hook]

On the end, on the back, flip crystal tracks
Method relax fast forward play back
Electrofied
Elecro night
Eclectic undefined in the moonlight
Shine bright how you'd like
Broken faces empty spaces make okay
Let my mind open up to the skies and pray
Raindrops like spots windshield spray
Don't stop, don't yield knots in the stomach
Not one, when you drop in the storm

[Hook]

Who is the eye between lies
I lie and just try to make it through the night and sigh

[Hook]

Conquest blessed like don't burn a nest
Drugged outta style from the old dragnet

[Hook]

Everyone gets stung one runs
One air with precision drum
That they overridden

[Hook 2x]

See I rock when I rip it when I'm rollin' on clouds
Shout loud breathe in when you drown in the now
Move like the misses to kiss this style
When ya dancing in the darkness, it's the quiet shout
On the end, hold back flip crystal tracks
The method relax the fast forward playback
