You know...
Oh baby...
You know...
You know the time I was lovin
Gilr out of time, girl out of time
Girl out of time, girl out of time
I was lovin you baby

(Mario Winans)
Every little thing you said
Didn't come from your heart
Now i'm laying out in my bed
Wondering where you are
Cuz you never meant what you said
And you throw it all on my head
You made me believe that you wanted me
You could've told the truth instead baby

(Bridge)
I don't know why
Didn't realize
You took the time to pick me up
And let me down baby
Look in my eyes you can't deny
That your the reason for the pain I feel inside

(Chorus)
When I looked into your eyes
There was nothing I can see
Now i'm lost and can't find my way
Cuz love has blinded me and now
I don't know what to do
Nothing I had to prove
You played me for a fool
All the time I was lovin you

(Mario winans)
Now the things were going
I knew I should've left back then
But my heart was steadily growing
Blaming all the man I am
If you felt this way
You should've showed it
You shouldn't ever took so long
Made it clear that you don't care
Where did I go wrong baby?

(Bridge)

(Chorus)
(Slim with Mario Winans)
You said you loved me
But i'm lonely again
It's gonna take time for me
Yes you did,yes you did
You could've told me
That you don't love me anymore
Somebody tell me why baby

(chorus)
(Slim with Mario Winans)
Can't act like you don't know
Didn't owe it all that time
But I can't blame you
I should've known
Wheni looked into your eyes
Girl so many nights of sittin alone
I jst sit and wonder why
Baby what you did was dead wrong
Didn't have to lie

(chorus til end)
