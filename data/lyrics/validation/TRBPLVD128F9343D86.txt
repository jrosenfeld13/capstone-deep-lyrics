I can no longer take it
I'm findin' it hard to do
Makin' believe I'll make it
Without You

How am I gonna shake it
I can't tell my heart what to do
Why even try to fake it
Without You

Without You to keep me goin'
This emptiness just keeps on growin'
Without You

How am I to find my way
Where am I to go
How could you just walk away
Takin' more of me
Than you could ever know

I'm gonna have to make it
I made it before without you
The love that I won
I'm not strong enough to lose

I never thought you'd break it
But you broke our love in two
I've got no place to take it
Without You

Without You to keep me goin'
This emptiness just keeps on growin'
Without You

How am I to find my way
Where am I to go
How could you just walk away
Takin' more of me
Than you could ever know
