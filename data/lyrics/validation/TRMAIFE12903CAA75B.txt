Ohhhhhaha

Her hair's got a little bit lighter
And the style has really changed
Her lips have got a little bit tighter
Man this chick drives everyone insane

She's so good at the things she tries
Sell her image for the golden skies
I think she's gonna make it
But she's gotta lose the game

She wants more
(she wants to make it, make it so bad)
She needs more
(she wants to make it, make it so bad)
She wants more
She wants to make it
(Make it) so bad
But then love comes tumbling down

The songs she writes and sings are pretty clever
People all around they've heard her name
Living in a world of never say never
I used to think that the chicks were all the same

She's so good at the things she tries
Sell her image for the golden skies
I think may just make it
But she's gotta lose the game

She wants more
(she wants to make it, make it so bad)
She needs more
(she wants to make it, make it so bad)
She wants more
She wants to make it
(Make it) so bad
But then love comes tumbling down

(guitar solo)

She's so good at the things she tries
Sell her image for the golden skies
I think may just make it
But she's gotta lose the game

She wants more
(she wants to make it, make it so bad)
She needs more
(she wants to make it, make it so bad)
She wants more
She wants to make it
(Make it) so bad
But then love comes tumbling down

She wants more
(she wants to make it, make it so bad)
You know she wants a little more
(she wants to make it, make it so bad)
She wants a little more
She wants to make it
(Make it) so bad
But then love comes tumbling down
Love comes tumbling down

Ooooooohhhh
