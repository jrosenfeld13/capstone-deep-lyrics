You will have a dress of white
You will have a ring of gold
You will have a paper snow
We'll fall
See the wall
The wall is black
We will have a heart attack
We will be alone and
We'll fall we'll fall we'll fall
Fall in love like sailors do
Tell your lover you'll be true
Sail upon the stupid sea
We'll fall
You will have a sheet of red
Paint the trees, the trees are dead
We will be alone and
We'll fallwe'll fall we'll fall we'll fall
Marry me and be my wife
You can have me all your life
Our love will never end
Parties for our stupid friends
Are the children really home?
We will lie upon the lawn
Needles on the beach at goa
We will have another flower
We will be a part of structure
You will have a face of structure
We will make ourselves a scene
We will live our stupid dream
I am you and you are me
Tie me down i will be free
Our love will never end
Parties for our stupid friends
Marry me and be my wife
You can have me all your life
Our love will never end
Parties for our stupid friends
Are the children really home?
We will lie upon the lawn
Needles on the beach at goa
We will have another flower
We will be a part of structure
You will have a face of structure
We will make ourselves a scene
We will live our stupid dream
I am you and you are me
Tie me down i will be free
Our love will have no end
