If I hold you to the light
Should I see right through you?
If I question what you are will it bring me any closer to you?

From Love to War
What we aim for is to keep the illusion
You can take your conscience for a lover
And satisfied there is no other
You can dream

Any doubts we had
Had better not show
What good would they do us
Leaving us nowhere to go?

From Love to War
What we aim for is to keep the illusion
Taking a stand for the benefit of man
And angry with pride because God is on our side

I could do with some sleep
'Cos the rubbish I talk is getting deep
And if I don't believe in you
Then there's nothing I can do
But throw myself at the walls
And love no-one at all

From Love to War
What we aim for is to keep the illusion
You can take your conscience for a lover
And satisfied there is no other
You can dream
