Is there a means to an end
When you twist and turn
Now I must descend
No more bridges to burn

So let love be light
With silver waves and golden hair
When day turns to night
You sing and grasp for air

When sirens are calling
I turn to the sea
When sirens are calling
What's left is derbis
When sirens are calling
I turn to the sea
When sirens are calling
Keep on keep calling me
