[Intro]
I'm so sorry baby, I never meant to hurt you
Please forgive me
La da da da da da da La da da da da da da da da oh ho

[Verse 1]
Tears I see drop from your eyes, Tell me why you cry
Guilt I feel when you look at me, Did I let you down

[Bridge]
Girl, you see that I, I apologize
Tell me what to do, to get through to you
Girl, it's not the same
I know I was to blame, Just tell me when will I
See you smile again

[Hook]
Tell me when will I see you smile again
Cause I know I messed up baby (Oh)
And I know you're fed up (Ooh) sugar (Hey hey)
Tell me when will I see you smile again (Oh, oh, oh)
Cause I know I messed up, baby, and I know you're fed up sugar

[Verse 2]
Promises I know I made many times before, and I broke each one of them
But I had to learn over and over again
Don't hurt the one you love

[Bridge]
Girl, you see that I, I apologize
Tell me what to do, to get through to you
Girl, it's not the same
I know I was to blame, Just tell me when will I
See you smile again

[Hook]
Tell me when will I see you smile again
Cause I know I messed up baby (Oh)
And I know you're fed up (Ooh) sugar (Hey hey)
Tell me when will I see you smile again (Oh, oh, oh)
Cause I know I messed up, baby, and I know you're fed up sugar

Look baby, Listen
Please forgive me for all the wrong I've done
You see I just can't understand, why I keep making
This same kind of mistake over and over again
But there's one question that remains in the back of my mind now
And that is...
When will I see you smile again?

[Hook]
Tell me when will I see you smile again (baby we can talk it over)
Cause I know I messed up baby (baby we can work it out)
And I know you're fed up sugar
Tell me when will I see you smile again
Cause I know I messed up baby
And I know you're fed up sugar (Is there something I can do, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Tell me when will I (Oh) see you smile (Ooh) again
Cause I know I messed up baby
And I know you're fed up sugar
Tell me when will I see you smile again
Cause I know I messed up baby
