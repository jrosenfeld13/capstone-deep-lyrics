Tonight, tonight
Won't be just any night
Tonight there will be no morning star
Tonight, tonight
I'll see my love tonight
And for us, stars will stop where they are

Today the minutes seem like hours
The hours go so slowly
And still the night is light

Oh moon, grow bright
And make this endless day endless night!
Tonight

Today, the world was just an address
A place for me to live in
No better than alright

But here you are
And what was just a world is a star
Tonight
