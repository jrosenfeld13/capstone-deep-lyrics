Do not pity me, this useless being
Do not save me, this frail being, infant in size
So I broke the pact again and in so many different ways
I chose to quit this act. On the very last of my days

You long to cling to my soul, I'm not going anywhere
I'll leave you alone, you end this ride
This sure was a bond of souls, I'm not going anywhere
I'll search for the whole, it's your turn to end this ride

Don't you fear, do not compare
All we feel - the life we have in here
Can't you see, you are burning me
All I feel is the time that's passing me

Share your needle, share that disease
Share your pain with me, let it flow through me
Never forgive me, never forget. Time stands still or so it seems
I deserve this all, I know I deserve this fall

You long to cling to my soul, I'm not going anywhere
I'll leave you alone, you end this ride
This sure was a bond of souls, I'm not going anywhere
I'll search for the whole, it's your turn to end this ride

Don't you fear, do not compare
All we feel - the life we have in here
Can't you see, you are burning me
All I feel is the time that's passing me, and everyone knows everything
