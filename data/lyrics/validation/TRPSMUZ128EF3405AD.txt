Yesterday has gone but time is on my side
When I'm on my own I find a place to hide
You're rushing through my head
You're seeping through my skin

Heaven feels so close it doesn't feel so great
Underneath these stars well I don't know my name
I'm lying in your arms, I'm lying to your face
And right before my eyes
You turned and walked away

One thing she can't do
Is tell me what I'm trying to prove
And what to say to you
I'll be straight with you
I think I might be losing my way
Because you left me there for dead
I don't ever think I'll get over you

(Hello boys and girls!)

One thing she can't do
Is tell me what I'm trying to prove
And what to say to you
I'll be straight with you
I think I might be losing my way
