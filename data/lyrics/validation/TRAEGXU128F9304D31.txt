We're running through the aisles
Of the churches still in style
Does this city have a curfew?
Don't you know it's good to see you too

The riders on the Champs lyses
We are the tourists in the cafes
We drank our wine along the river
Not believing where we were at all

It's alright, the camera's talking
Oh
And even though I can't be sure
Memory tells me that these times are worth working for

The buffalo in Catalina
The colored stones and troop leaders
The voices of the canopy singers
Ensured that we wouldn't sleep for long

I knew this would be the part
My plane's arrival catches me off guard
We'll all be leaving with a broken heart
Wallets empty and we're back at start

It's alright, the camera is talking
Oh
And even though i can't be sure
Memory tells me that these times are worth working for

It's alright, the camera is talking
Oh

The cistern is not even full
The sister is naughty
The cistern is not even

It's alright, the camera is talking
Oh
And even though i can't be sure
Memory tells me that these times are worth working...
