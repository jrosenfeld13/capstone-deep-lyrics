Car Chase City, that's the name of the game
It was all groovy, it was totally lame
KG really fuckin' blew a synapse
Now we're fucking headed for a total collapse
Car Chase City, run away from the fuzz
Though that we wasn't, but we totally was
Car Chase City, now we're off of the map
Car Chase City, now we're takin' a crap
Now it's getting hairy, so we're changin' the key
Never underestimate the power of D
KG fuckin' put his foot on the gas
If I go to prison, hide the pick in my ass
Fuck this shit, it's gone too far
Kage, pull over, let me out of the car
Car Chase City, now we're taking the lane
KG blew it, now we're goin' insane

Let's rock, let's roll
Let me try to fill up your hole
Let's rock, let's roll
Car Chase City patrol

Let's rock, let's roll, Car Chase City patrol
Let's rock, let's roll, just a fuckin' rigamarole, uh

Let's rock, let's roll, Car Chase City patrol
Let's rock, let's roll, just a fuckin' rigamaroll, uh
Let's rock, let's roll, Car Chase City patrol
Let's rock, let's roll, rock your pussy over my soul
