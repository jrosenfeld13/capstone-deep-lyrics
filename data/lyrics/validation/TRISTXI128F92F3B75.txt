Tyrone:
Cant afford to make a mistake, rowing on this freezing lake
Cause if a make a little mistake, Ill hit the ice, my boat will break
So I row, row, row real slow, trying to keep afloat
Rowing kinda wobbly cause my aaaaaaantlers rock the boat

Race your boat, race your boat, race your boat, boat, boat
Race your boat, race your boat, race your boat, boat, boat, race!
