"You say it's solid poetry

It's what you want to see

Some sensuality

When you cry, I just can't prove you wrong

No I just play along

I guess it turns you on...

The games we play

The shows we give

The hearts we break

We live through this...
The games we play

Do right, it's getting critical

Are we too cynical...

Could use a miracle...

The games we play

The shows we give

My heart you break

I live through this... the games we play

The games we play

The rules we make

Like secret codes, we can't escape

The games we play...

You say there really is no doubt

We just can't do without...

The games we play

The shows we give

The hearts we break

We live through this

The games we play

The rules we bend

With lovers lust, we will defend

The games we play...

You say it's solid poetry
