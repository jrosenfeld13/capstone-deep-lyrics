Wide awake
Fear is now the only thing that's keeping me
Wide awake

With no evidence your new defense is useless
You can find your way around it, the obvious truth
Back when inebriant and ignorant and cruel
I was spinning all around just waiting here for you

To find your way in
Hoping you find your way in

'Cause I'm wide awake
You are now the only thing that's keeping me
Wide awake
Yeah I'm wide awake
Fear is now the only thing that's keeping me
Wide awake

You were brilliant turned hesitant fool
You just have to look around you'll figure out its true
That when inebriant you're ignorant and cruel
And I'm the fool standing here waiting up for you

To find your way in
Hoping you find your way in

[Chorus]
Fearing me obsolete...
Thinking I should clear out my mind
So I can't
Hesitate, complicate, anything anymore
It's a
Slow defeat empty sheets look at me lying on the floor
It's a
Slow defeat empty sheets look at me wanting so much more

[Chorus]
