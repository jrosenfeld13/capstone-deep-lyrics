Hour by hour with each day that passes
Learning to think in a different way
The mind and the will that can soon overcome this
Learning all of the right things to say

The danger of freedom is just letting them see
That you are not bound by their morality
Reflecting them just like a bear at the baiting
That's when your down fall is just in the making

Live and let live, live and let die
Die and forgive, never ask why

You were born, born as a stranger
You were born, born in a different world

Not scared of sharing, and not scared of dying
But he can sense that they're all so afraid
Afraid of the darkness, afraid of their ending
And all of the errors that lie in their grave
