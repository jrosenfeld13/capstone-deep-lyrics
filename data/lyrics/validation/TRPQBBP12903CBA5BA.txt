[Intro]
So, you know everything about your lover
Wanna bet?

[Chorus]
My, oh my
How can this be?
There he goes, talking in his sleep
By and by
He will connive
Does he know he's talking in his sleep?

[Verse 1]
The affair, okay
He's corrupt
What do I do, what do I say?
I feel ashamed, embarrassed, fatigued
Such a petty crime of sexual indiscretion

[Pre-Chorus]
At night, when he lays down
How I wish I could not hear the sound
(But I could)
Oh, the things that he said

[Chorus]
My, oh my
How can this be?
There he goes, talking in his sleep
By and by
He will connive
Does he know he's talking in his sleep?

[Verse 2]
Adultery, that's what they call it
When you're married
Tell me something
Why is it that the men are forgiven and the women aren't?
I don't know, maybe, maybe I should forgive him
Maybe I'm over-reacting
What do you think? Not!

[Pre-Chorus]
The promises he made
Said we'll be together for always
(He's such a liar)
Then he calls out her name

[Chorus]
My, oh my
How can this be?
There he goes, talking in his sleep
By and by
He will connive
Does he know he's talking in his sleep?

[Bridge]
Guilty secrets
They are haunting my life
And he doesn't even know that I know
Can you hear him?

[Pre-Chorus]
The promises he makes
Said we'll be together for always
(He's such a liar)
Then he goes out to burn me

[Chorus]
My, oh my
How can this be?
There he goes, talking in his sleep
By and by
He will connive
Does he know he's talking in his sleep?
My, oh my
How can this be?
There he goes, talking in his sleep
By and by
He will connive
Does he know he's talking in his sleep?
