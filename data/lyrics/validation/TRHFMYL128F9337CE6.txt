Poison free, now living life so pure
Tell me, have all your addictions been cured?
When you mark your fist, what's going through your mind?
Is this your new fix?
Ensnared again, confined

Transference of one addiction to another, you haven't solved a thing
All you've done is change the game you've been playing
Different equipment, the rules are the same - the goal remains unscathed
Just looking for acceptance and the power that it brings

Push your self to higher heights - rise above the herd
Straightedge isn't the answer if the decision isn't yours
Push your self higher
Think about the life you live
Have your standards been met?
Or have you rooted yourself - cemented in and set

Projection of your addiction to another; the mind is a powerful tool
Consume a symbol you've now become addicted to
Just one of the pack with a pat on the back, marked fist finger in the air
Tell me would you, tell me could you, if your friends were not there

This is my choice; I made it, I live by it
My life is my own
This is my choice; I made it, I live by it
Are you in control?
