No one hears what ' what you say
No one is there ' there for you
But I've got music and I've got friends
Both always on my side
Conviction instilled in me
This is what keeps me alive

You don't know me
Don't know any of us
Don't know what this means
Keep your mouth shut

Try and try ' to tear me down
Run and run ' run your mouth
But it's you who's lost
In social ills, lusts and greeds
This is for the outcasts that never fit
This is all that we need

I don't care what you think of me
I don't hear what you say
You never had it, you never will
Keep your mouth shut and worry about yourself

Keep your mouth shut
