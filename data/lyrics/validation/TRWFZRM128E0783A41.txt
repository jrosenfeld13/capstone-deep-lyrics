Show me a house with a window
One with a garage and five bedrooms
Phone me a line so I can judge you
Call me your name if you want to
Show me a way to the exit
Look at my hands, see them shaking
Tell me a part from my shadow
Find me a life for the shadow

It's all automatic
It's all automatic
Keep off the tracks, ahh-ah
Keep holding back

Space and time, fusing
Distance is behind
Space and time, fusing
Distance is behind
Space and time, fusing
Distance is behind
Space and time, fusing
Distance is behind
