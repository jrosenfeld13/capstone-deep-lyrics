I lost a friend of spirit
Last year during the month of June
Since then I started analysing
And my life got another tune
I broke with my old ways
On which I drift with empty gladness
Knowing that life's to short
To be in deep sadness

This is my life
I can't live it twice
All I can give
Is a piece of my heart
I don't wanna die
Without facing lifes lie
All I can give
Is a piece of my heart
Of my heart
Of my heart
Of my heart

I lost my old black coach of sorrow
When I start to look with childish eyes
And in that world of no tommorow
I found my key to paradise
At least I left old fears behind me
The gost and phantoms of the past
Hoping that my love and face
And hope forever last

This is my life
I can't live it twice
All I can give
Is a piece of my heart
I don't wanna die
Without facing lifes lie
All I can give
Is a piece of my heart
Of my heart
Of my heart
Of my heart
