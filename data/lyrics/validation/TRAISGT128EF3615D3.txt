I am learning from what
I have learnt
There are other sides to learn
The story's heard
And there are winners first
And there are betters worse
And there are listeners
Who are never hurt
And at the end of all of this
At last, I'll stand and I'll shout
Our glory days are over
They're over
At last, I'll stand and I'll shout
Our glory days are over
They're over
No, I can't turn that page for you
But I can't lie
I love you, cause that I do
(?) along in just to belong
To live today like tomorrow's gone
And they are weak but strong
Who fail but carry on
And if one thing's short for something
They are never wrong
And at the end of all of this
At last, I'll stand and I'll shout
Our glory days are over
They're over
At last, I'll stand and I'll shout
Our glory days are over
They're over
Life is always as hard as we make it
Come take my hand
Let's fly and we're weightless
Let's live today like tomorrow is over
At last, I'll stand and I'll shout
Our glory days are over
They're over
At last, I'll stand and I'll shout
Our glory days are over
They're over
No I can't turn that page for you
Your music has broken me in two
But I can't lie
I love you, cause that I do
