"Please let me be yours please never leave
Please stay here close to me
All love we shared where is it now?
Please let me be better than I was
Please don't give up on us
The thought of leaving you - I do not know how"

"I can feel the pain you have inside
I see it in your eyes
Those eyes that used to shine for me
I can feel the wildness in your heart
That's tearing us apart
My love how can I help if you don't want me?"

There is nothing you can do to help me now
I am lost within myself as so many times before
There's nothing you can do to ease my pain
I am so, so sorry but if you love me you must let go

Two young souls in the dance of a chain sling
Love once born from the ink of Solitude
Bidding to dance in the swing of a rope end
Walking their Remedy Lane through this interlude of pain

Who will be there now?
When I lose my one true love?
(When I lose my love)
I am falling now
Darkness below and above

There is nothing you can do to help me now
I am lost within myself as so many times before
There's nothing you can do to ease my pain
I am so, so sorry but if you love me you must let go

Two young souls in the dance of a chain sling
Love once born from the ink of solitude
Bidding to dance in the swing of a rope end
Walking their Remedy Lane through this interlude of pain

Who will be there now
When I lose my one true love?
(I am falling now)
Have I lost myself?
To love someone else

"Please let me be yours please never leave
Please stay here close to me
All love we shared where is it now?
Please let me be better than I was
Please don't give up on us
The thought of leaving you"

I do not know how
