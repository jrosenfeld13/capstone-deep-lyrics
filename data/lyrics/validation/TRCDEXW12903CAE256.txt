Leave the city nights right behind you (repeat)

This time you choose
Not to take photographs
Things are to change
Jump to next paragraph
All days are packed
Evidence left to die
You think you're wrecked
But you are still alive

You know the way out
You lock the door
You are the engine
You're gonna blow
There is no cooler
To low the heat
This feeling drives you to the street

Leave the city nights right behind you (repeat)

This time you leave
And you have no regrets
Your car is on
And it's ready to dance
You drop a smile
Wave the City goodbye
Hold on a while
You are walking the line

I see you later
You tell the streets
I know there's someone
Somewhere to meet
You face the exit
To feel the breeze
You leave this city on his knees

Leave the city nights right behind you (repeat)
