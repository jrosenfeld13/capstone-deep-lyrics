I spend the night in a chair thinking he'll be there
But never comes
And I wake up and wipe the sleep from my eyes
And I rise to face another day
Without him

It's just no goof anymore when you walk through the door
To an empty room
You go inside and set a table for one, it's no fun
When you have to spend a day
Without him
Without him

We burst the pretty balloon took to the moon
It's such a beautiful thing
But it's ended now
And it sounds like a lie
If I say I'd rather die than live without him
Without him
