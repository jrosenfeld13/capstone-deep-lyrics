She's sweet like honey
Sour like democracy
She don't want your money
She needs your sympathy
She'll be your greatest lover
But she doesn't belong to you
She's unlike any other
She doesn't belong to you

Oh
She's your China doll
She's patient
But won't be for long
She's hopeful
But time's running low
She's gone before you know

She's the alarm bell ringing
She's your latest fix
The fat lady's singing
The truth and not some trick

Oh
She's your China doll
She's patient
But won't be for long
She's hopeful
But time's running low
She'll be gone before you know
