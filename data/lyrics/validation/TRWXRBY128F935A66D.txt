Reach for your razor
Cut through the dawn
See through your inner wrath
Keys shan't open the doors

Behold my heart has stopped
My lungs are laid the final rest
And still I see and do I feel
Yes, but to earthly eyes I am gone
To the land where legends never die
Take me to the twilight land tonight

Again and again and again in every night
The darkness climbs through my walls
Ever screaming silent to the corrupted ears

Never to any man I will spear
My speech it has no value
Eyes that have seen the sights
Bleed through the ages eternal

I ask no more
A life has just begun
Never will I see the sun
And do I miss it
No, my eyes are black
Emotions fled through eyelids closed
Throne of thorns
Clad in shadows
