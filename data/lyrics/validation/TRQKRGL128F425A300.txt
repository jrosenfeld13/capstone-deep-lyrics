Like pennies in a wishing well
I try but I can never tell
Where this winding road of life
Will lead tomorrow

But in between the how and why
The questions of the days gone by
One thing brings me peace of mind
It's knowing come what may

That I am safe with your arms around me
Since the day love found me
I am safe, I know my hope's in heaven
And whatever happens I am safe

There's trouble everywhere I turn
No end to lessons to be learned
And it scares me wonderin'
What's around the corner

But you've told me to remember this
You're there for me and know what's best
I shouldn't worry about all the rest
Just trust in you and not forget

I am safe with your arms around me
Since the day love found me
I am safe, I know my hope's in heaven
And whatever happens I am safe

I am safe

I am safe with your arms around me
Since the day love found me
I am safe, I know my hope's in heaven
And whatever happens

I am safe with your arms around me
Since the day love found me
I am safe, I know my hope's in heaven
And whatever happens

I am safe with your arms around me
Since the day love found me
I am safe, I know my hope's in heaven
And whatever happens I am safe
