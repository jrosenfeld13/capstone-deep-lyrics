Goodbye sunshine
I'm on my way
I'll be long time gone
By the break of day

Tell everyone
That I'm gonna find it
There ain't nothin'
Gonna stop me -

Rollin' Over
Rollin' Over

Save all your lovin'
Till I get home
To the sweetest lovin' sunshine
That I've ever known

Tell everyone
That I'm gonna find it
There ain't nothin'
Gonna stop me

Rollin' Over, Shak-do-way
Rollin' Over, Yeah-yeah-yeah

Rollin' Over, Shak-do-way
Rollin' Over, Yeah-yeah-yeah

Rollin' Over, Shak-do-way
Rollin' Over, Yeah-yeah-yeah

Rollin' Over, Shak-do-way
Rollin' Over, Yeah-yeah-yeah
