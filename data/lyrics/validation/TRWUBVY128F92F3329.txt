We're headed for the great smokey mountains
To see the wild flowers bloom in spring
'Cause we've decided that there's no better place to be
For two young people who just wanna do their thing in the spring

I know we're gonna be happy

'Cause James is a freedom fighter and he lives for the moment
His parents are hippies and he sees everything through a rainbow
He's never unhappy because he never wears a watch
He lives on his mountain bike and he sees beauty in everyone

James says he's gonna change the world
James says that I am his flower girl
And James and I, we're gonna make a difference
Just wait and see, we're gonna set the world free

It's two years later now and we're both out of college
And we've decided to love one another for eternity
I've got a good job but James says no one understands him
He's an artist; he needs time to find out what that means

James says he's gonna change the world
James says that I am his flower girl
And James and I, we're gonna make a difference
Just wait and see, we're gonna set the world free
We're gonna set the world free
We're gonna set the world free

He answers to a higher calling
The moon and the sun and the stars are falling
Through his time and his space
And I'm lucky to be part of it all
He is bigger than life
He sees things, he knows things
He is not like you and me

James says he's gonna change the world
James says that I am his flower girl
And James and I, we're gonna make a difference
Just wait and see, we're gonna set the world free

James finally found a steady job and now we're gonna settle down
He still loves his music, but he knows where his priorities lie
He stepped on his dreams so many times and wore out the path
He needed to take to find the life he thought would just happen to him
Like the changing of a season
