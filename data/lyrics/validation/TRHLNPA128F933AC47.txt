I'd hoped to turn your world around
But you let go
You changed your mind
It's hard enough to see this through
Why can't you look me in the eye?

And what did you think I'd turn into?
And what did you think I'd do for you?
You'd cut off my hands
To hide the truth
And make me the liar inside you

I know we have to burn this down
I see we're flying way too high
And now I see, so dangerous
You're always trying to take what's mine

And what did you think that I would do?
And while you paint it red, I paint it blue
I'll cut off my hands to bare the truth
Forever the liar inside you

I'm not changing for anybody else
Cuz' every time I do
It seems I lose myself

I'd hoped to turn your world around
But you let go
You changed your mind
But now I cannot see this through
Already wasted too much time

And now there is nothing I could do
You still paint it red
And I'll still feel blue
I'm keeping my hands
That's what I'll do
And show you the liar
I'll show you the liar
Inside you
