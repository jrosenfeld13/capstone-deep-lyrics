Make an early air ride then you crash your car
Tripping out on Sunday when you find you're a star
New York on Monday when your LA was fine
So you take another jet stream and get lost in your wine
Everybody wants to be somebody but nobody wants to give the time
Down the line East 65th Street on my mind

Turn on the radio---radio
Sing it everywhere
Turn on the radio---radio
And what do you care
Turn on the radio---radio
There's love in the air
It's just the price you have to pay
For your ride on Saturday
Turn on the radio
The radio
It's just the price you have to pay

Well standing on the corner when she catches your eye
Offers twenty twenty dollars for a twin it's on your mind
So you take another 'Lude' and you shoot another dime
'Cos your money is the power but your ego's on the line
Everybody wants to give the time
To blow your mind
To satisfy your ego

Turn on the radio---radio
Sing it everywhere
Turn on the radio---radio
There's loving in the air
Turn on the radio--radio
And what do you care
The radio---the radio

Good morning, you wake up
The smoke gets in your eyes
You turn on---you listen
It's only you in disguise
But it's the price you have to pay

Turn on the radio---radio
Sing it everywhere
And what do you care
Turn on the radio---radio
There's loving in the air
It's just the price you have to pay
For your ride on Saturday
Turn on the radio
It's just the price you have to pay
