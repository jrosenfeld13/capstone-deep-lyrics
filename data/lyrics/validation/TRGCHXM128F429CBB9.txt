Life is like a mountain railway
With an engineer that's brave
We must make the run successful
From the cradle to the grave

Heed the curves and watch the tunnels
Never falter, never fail
Keep your hand upon the throttle
And your eye upon the rail

Blessed Savior, Thou will guide us
Till we reach that blissful shore
Where the angels wait to join us
In that train forevermore

Oh, Blessed Savior, Thou will guide us
Till we reach that blissful shore
Where the angels wait to join us
In God's grace forevermore
