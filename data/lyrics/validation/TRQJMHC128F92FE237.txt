When the red red robin comes bob bob bobbin' along, along
There'll be no more sobbin' when he starts throbbin'
His own sweet song
Wake up, wake up you sleepyheads
Get up, get up, get out of bed
Cheer up, cheer up the sun is red
Live, love, laugh and be happy

Why should I feel blue when I'm walkin' through
Fields of flowers
The rain may glisten but still I listen for hours and hours
And I'm just a kid again doin' what I did again
Singin' my song
When the red red robin comes bob, bob, bobbin' along

Now, why should I feel blue when I'm walkin' through
Fields of flowers
The rain may glisten but still I listen for hours and hours
And I'm just a kid again doin' what I did again
Singin' my song
When the red red robin comes bob, bob, bobbin' along
Well the red red robin comes bob, bob, bobbin' along
