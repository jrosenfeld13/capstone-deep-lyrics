[Verse 1: Jimmy Gnecco]
Christ, your head, what's it become?
While the whole world's out having fun

[Bridge]
I'm in a cloud, it's pulling me down, breaking me down

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm in a cloud, it feels like a crowd of a hundred
It's five degrees here
Nobody sees, somebody please, save me

[Chorus]
This is the sound of my miseryhead
Choke on the taste of my miseryhead
Dance to the words of my miseryhead
This is the sound of my miseryhead

[Bridge]
I'm in a cloud, it's pulling me down, breaking me down

[Verse 2]
Turn around, what's that sound? I'm in your head
I thought I heard him say, he'd rather be dead, than
Live life apart...we're apart...we're apart

[Chorus]
