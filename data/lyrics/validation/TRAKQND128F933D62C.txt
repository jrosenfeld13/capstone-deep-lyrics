Something deed
Inside of me
Something you will never see
But I believe
That all is lost
And nothing's real
'Til we can bring back
Old tyme Hardcore
Old tyme Hardcore
Old tyme Hardcore
Old tyme Hardcore
They say we changed
We lost our way
Said we saw out better days
You're all the same
You turned your backs
Said we're fake
You made a mistake
Old tyme hardcore
Old tyme hardcore
Old tyme hardcore
Old tyme hardcore
Done my time I got nothing to prove
If you've got nothing there's nothing to lose
It's easy to judge when you're only fifteen
But it must be great to know everything
Old tyme hardcore
Old tyme hardcore
Old tyme hardcore
Old tyme hardcore
The more things change
The more they stay
And values seem to fade away
How can I care
About these things
I try to fight
To try and bring back
Old tyme hardcore
Old tyme hardcore
Old tyme hardcore
Old tyme hardcore
