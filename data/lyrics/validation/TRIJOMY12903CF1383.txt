In my world there is nothing quite like this pain
All your dreams, your illusions
They're like tears in the rain

Eyes stare blank
You don't reach don't you need me
Can't you see that this needs be
And no one else really cares?
See me, see my world in another light
So full of life new beginnings
And our souls burn so bright

I Don't dream I'm falling anymore...

In my world there is nothing quite like this pain
All your dreams, your illusions
They're like tears in the rain

Your eyes stare back
You don't reach out
Don't you need me?
Can't you see how this bleeds me
And no one else really to cares
