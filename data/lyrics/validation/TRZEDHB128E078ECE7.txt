[Verse 1]
If you think that you're strong
Want to fight well come on
And line up
When the going gets tough
And your talk aint enough
Line up

[Chorus 1]
We got to get up, get out before they get us down
Because living up against the wall, yeah
Has got us locked up
Come on and line up

[Bridge]
So don't be surprised when they pull the wool over your eyes
You don't get funked up

[Chorus 2]
If you got all the stuff
And you can't get enough
Then line up
If you're out on a limb
And you wanna come in
Then line up

[Verse 2]
You're head's down, sitting round
Pick you face up off the ground
And get yourself together baby
And learn to stand tough
Come on and line up
We better get to it instead of just standin around
It's time to get down
Come on, Joe!
If you're playing to win
And you're only way in
Is line up
If we all want to live
And we all gotta give
Line up

[Chorus 1]

[Bridge]
You better get to it instead of just standin around
Yeah, it's time to get down

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
You got to get yourself together
You got to stand up and be counted
You got to love, you got to love, you got to love, you got to love
Uh
