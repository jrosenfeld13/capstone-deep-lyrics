Give me all your love
Love, lo-lo-love
Love, lo-lo-love
Love, lo-lo-love
Love, lo-lo-love

Love, lo-lo-love
Love, lo-lo-love

Could it be that it's just my love?
There's no use in trying to give up
'Cause if you don't cross my heart
Even when we're far apart
I'll need you

Wanting all is really not a crime
Though you'll say "too soon", I'll say "it's time"
I'm not trying to be aggressive
But I'm made to be possessive
I want you

Love is blind (love is blind)
And unkind (and unkind)
You keep me coming back for more

[Chorus]
Give me all your love (all your love)
Let me hold the best of you
Give me all your love (all your love)
Take my arm until we're through

Love, lo-lo-love
Love, lo-lo-love

So, you tell me that it's much too soon (much too soon)
You need time because you like your room
And I'll say with much affection
"Darling, take a new direction
You've got to"

Talk to me (talk to me)
What you free (what you free)
You've got me hungry for your love

[Chorus x2]
Love, lo-lo-love
Love, lo-lo

Let me take you where we'll both be free
Together, we'll feel love and ecstasy
Give me all
Give me all
Give me all, all your love

[Chorus x2]
Give me all your love
Give me all your love

Give me all your love
Give me all your love
Give me all your love
Give me all your love

[Repeat x9]
Give me all your love
