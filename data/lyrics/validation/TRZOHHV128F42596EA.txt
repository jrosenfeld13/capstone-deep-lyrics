When I was a little boy
Living in the last century
I thought about living in the future
Then it occurred to me
I turned around, the future was now
The future was all around me
Nothing like I had imagined
It was totally confounding
Hey-ohhh

21st century life
I got swept away
I got 21,000 things that I got to do today
21st century life
Well what can I say?
The new world's got me feeling so dirty
Think I need to get down and pray

Well now I turned on the TV just in time enough to hear what the Pope said, the Pope said
And just a few tiny little words later
Somebody wants the man dead, oh
Well what about famine and disease
Well they said its too bad (oops)
Because I'm never alone
It's not just a phone
It's a stereo
Hey-ohhh

21st century life
I got swept away
I got 21,000 things that I got to do today
21st century life
What can I say?
The new world's got me feeling so dirty
Think I need to get down and pray

Now I'm not a little boy
I'm in the 21st century
Well you might think we've come a really long way, but there's still no equality
Mmm hey hey
I watched the news on my computer screen
Talkin' 'bout buying my weed out of a vending machine
You tell me I'm free
Well how can that be
When you're always watching me on the CCTV?

21st century life
I got swept away
I got 21,000 things that I got to do today
21st century life
What can I say?
The new world's got me feeling so dirty
Think I need to get down and pray
