Not a cloud showed out in the sky that very night in Pitch Black City
I was so damned scared, it was dark, it was so dim, it was a shame
Just then a man walked up to me and said: "Didn't I see you here before?"
The lights were low and the party was so dull, just not good enough

Holiday (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Holiday (Holiday, what you say?)
Holiday
Celebrate (Ah, yeah!)

Holiday
Holiday (Oh, I, I)
Holiday
Celebrate (Oooh!)

Then we both held hands in each other's for a chance to start it moving
He reached deep inside of his vest and in his hand he held a ring
Let's have lunch, picnic or a brunch in the wintertime
Let's disco down in a roller skating ring in Alaska town

Holiday (Holiday)
Holiday (Oh, come on, celebrate)
Holiday (Ooohooohooohooohooo)
Celebrate

Holiday (Got the feeling, come on, keep ahead)
Holiday (Reelin', holiday, yeaheah)
Holiday (Oh!)
Celebrate
