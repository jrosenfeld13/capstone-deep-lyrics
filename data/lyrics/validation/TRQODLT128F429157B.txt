We're growing buildings by the sea
We're plotting, planning our insanity
Pushing out to live beyond our bounds
Taking over until nothing can be found
Striving for heights we can not reach
We're keeping nature on a leash
Joking with ourselves
As we pretend that we don't see, and we're growing taller
Blasting deeper holes under the sea
We won't see it coming
Nature reclaims all that's hers
Returning balance to the earth
And we move underground, and we begin to see
Nature removes her leash
It's now on you and me
Striving for heights we can not reach
We're keeping nature on a leash
Arrogance will be the downfall of the human race
Building bigger cities, soon to be our children's graves
Nature escapes from her chains
And we move underground
And we begin to see
Nature remove her leash
It's now on you and me
