[Verse 1]
We get our nerves of steel
When the balaclavas go on
We're just not used to ourselves
If it pays then it sells our hides

[Verse 2]
I wake for every meal
But I still set a place for you
We're looking out for you son
We fear the worst but it's done

[Chorus]
The factory has treated you well
The coals burn colder
The factory has treated you well
The coals burn colder
But in a part of the heart of the hearth
It still swells

[Verse 1]
We get our nerves of steel
When the balaclavas go on
We're just not used to ourselves
If it pays then it sells our hides

[Chorus]
The factory has treated you well
The coals burn colder
The factory has treated you well
The coals burn colder
But in a part of the heart of the hearth
It still swells
