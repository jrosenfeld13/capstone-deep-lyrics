Clay Blaker/Tommy Connors

Her name was Stella
And she was old and gray
She had her rusty strings and keys
And the tuner, it took a pair of pliers
And lots of elbow grease
She awakened me to the melody
Like the light from a brand new dawn
And from that moment on
It was all for the sake of the song

Her name was Maggie
She had eyes like fire
That burned for me in the dark
And all she wanted was my very soul
And all she could take from my heart
But to her dismay a choice was made
And when the deed was done
She turned and I was gone
It was all for the sake of the song

And for the sake of the song
I walk my own road
For the sake of the song
Not for silver and gold
Some may think that I am wrong
But in my heart I know
And I've known all along
It was all for the sake of the song

Her name was Laura
She was pure like crystal
Shining alone on the shelf
And from the moment that her eyes met mine
I knew there could be nobody else
Kindred souls singing free in perfect harmony
Two hearts now beat as one
The road goes on and on
And it's all for the sake of the song

For the sake of the song
I walk my own road
For the sake of the song
Not for silver and gold
Some may think that I am wrong
But in my heart I know
And I've known all along
It was all for the sake of the song

Her name's Stella
