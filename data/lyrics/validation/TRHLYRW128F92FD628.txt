[Hugh Cornwell and (all)]
Strolling along minding my own buisness
Well there goes a girl and a half
She's got me going
Up and down
She's got me going
(Up and down)

(Walking on the beaches looking at the peaches)

Well I got the notion girl that you got some suntan lotion in that bottle of yours
Spread it all over my peelin' skin baby
That feels real good
All this skirt
Lappin' up the sun
Lap me up
Why don't you come on and
(Lap me up)

(Walking on the beaches looking at the peaches)

Well there goes another one just lying down on the sand dunes
I'd better go take a swim
And see if I can cool down a little bit
'Cause you and me woman
We got a lotta
(Things on our minds) you know what I mean

(Walking on the beaches looking at the peaches)

Will you just take a look over there
(Where?)
(There)
Is she tryin' to get outta that clitOris?
Liberation for women
Thats what I preach
(Preacher man)

(Walking on the beaches looking at the peaches)

Oh shit
There goes the charabanc
Looks like I'm gonna be stuck here the whole summer
Well what a bummer
I can think of a lot worse places to be
Like down in the streets
Or down in the sewer
Or even on the end of a skewer

[Organ breakdown]

Down on the beaches
Just look at all the peaches
(Down on the beaches)
Just look at all the firm bodies
(Down on the beaches)
Just look at all the sunglasses
(Down on the beaches)
Just look at all the peaches
(Down on the beaches)
Just look at all the peaches
(Down on the beaches)
Just look at all the peaches
(Down on the beaches)
