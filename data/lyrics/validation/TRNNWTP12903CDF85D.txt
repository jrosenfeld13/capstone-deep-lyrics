The act of death is certain, it's your right to want to want to know
What lies beyond this world and what awaits your future now

Waiting for the afterlife
Waiting for your time to die
Waiting for the afterlife
Waiting till the time is right
Waiting for the afterlife
Waiting, wanting, searcing, suffering
Waiting for the afterlife
Time is upon you time to die

Why don't stop to ponder, why you're afraid of death
Why don't you stop and wonder, what could be worse than this

Now you're alone your life has ceased I can feel it
All of your hatred has come undone
I've watched you live, I've watched you die I have seen it
And now it's over I can finally move on

Your time spent here is over now you deal with it
No coming back, never living, I know
To earn freedom, you must let go, I now know it
Of all the hatred, for it's time to move on

Waiting for the afterlife
Waiting for your time to die
Waiting for the afterlife
Waiting till the time is right
Waiting for the afterlife
Waiting, wanting, searching, suffering
Waiting for the afterlife
Time is upon you time to die

Why don't stop to pnder, why you're afraid of death
Why don't you stop and wonder, what could be worse than this

I can't stand by and watch you wait for an after
Life that has been promised to you by your faith
Why would you believe such nonsense without any
Shred of proof or existence beyond our world
