Bring in the dancers
Bring in the clowns
Bring in the magic in the air now
Sing you a song
I'm calling all dreamers
Won't you ever wake up my sweetheart
My sweetheart

One out of a million became one out of three
One out of thousands in the world became one heart of me
And if you ever leave me I hope I I'll never wake up
Sweetheart
Sweetheart
My sweetheart

Whoehoehoehoe
It's a crazy world everything changes but our lives forever seize
Whoehoehoehoe
It's a crazy world

So bring in the dancers
Bring in the clowns
Bring in the magic in the air around you
Give me your smile
And I'm calling you a dreamer
And don't you and don't you ever wake up no my sweetheart
My sweetheart
Sweetheart

Sweetheart
