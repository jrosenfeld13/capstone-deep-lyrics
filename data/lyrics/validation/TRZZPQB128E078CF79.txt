When she holds me
In her arms
I can feel the magic
Of her charm

When she kisses me
Oh, so tenderly
Makes me know her love
Is only for me

It's such a lovely way she loves me (Ha, ha, baby)
It's such a lovely way she loves me (Ha, ha, baby)

When I'm feeling down and out
She eases the pain
When I'm down and out, ooh, baby
You make me feel alive again

She makes me know her love
Is for me
And it's for real
Not a fantasy

It's such a lovely way she loves (Ha, ha, baby)
It's such a lovely way she loves (Ha, ha, baby)

I remember in the summer sunset
We sat and talked
About how we had met
And when the autumn leaves began to fall
I remembered how we sat and reminisced it all
And when the wintry winds began to blow
I held him close
And that made me know, that made me know
That made me know, ooh

Oh...

Such a lovely way she loves (Ha, ha, baby)
It's such a lovely way she loves (Ha, ha, baby)
It's such a lovely way she loves (Ha, ha, baby)
