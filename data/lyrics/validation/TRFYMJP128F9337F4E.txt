I know what I need
And you've got what I want
Use your imagination

Got that look in your eyes
So hard to disguise your situation

If it feels like a good thing
It's down to you, girl
If it feels like a good thing
You know what to do

There's a hunger in me
I just can't seem to please
And you've got the connections
Try not to fight, when the feeling is right
Just move my direction

If it feels like a good thing
It's down to you girl
If it feels like a good thing
You know what to do

I know what I need
And you got what I want
Use your imagination
There's a hunger in me
I just can't seem to please
Love starvation

But if it feels
If it feels like a good thing
Feels allright
Feels like a good thing
