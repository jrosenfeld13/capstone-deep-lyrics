[Intro]
Yo, sup Keak?

[Verse 1]
Cell in my lap, my hand on my strap
I'm smoking purple sipping 'yac
Inhaler I'm primatene mist causin' asthma attacks
Hitting niggas taking early fades gap backs

Direct the scene shoot them with cannon
So how you wanna act?
Bunnating, oppolating the sizzle
In the cut alone for doing my thizzle

Ohing drinking throwing up the hundreds
Solo, but on the low my buddy (My buddy)
Doing hella shit at one time
My definition of hyphy man is thizzing, sniffing lines

I'm in the building and I'm feeling like yee!
R.I.P. to the Mac D.R.E
So don't don't stop keep it going (Keep it going)

With some Privilege in the back and I'm blowing (Blowing)
Hold it down for the bay repping Oakland
If it wasn't for that granddaddy smokin' (Dadida)

[Hook]
Yadidamean (Fo sho)
Know what I mean (Fo sheezy)
Yadidamean (Fo sho)
Know what I mean (Fo sheezy)
Yadidamean (Fo sho)
Know what I mean (Fo sheezy)
Yadidamean (Fo sho)
Know what I mean (Fo sheezy)

I don't think they know that's my word (Hyphy)
I don't think they don't that's my word (What it do?)
I don't think they knowing that's my word (Fasheezy)
I don't think they don't that's my word

[Verse 2]
Ooh ahh ooh aah do a little shit
Br-a-b-b-b-bay have I lost it? You still with me?
Fazeeking keaking and sneaking
All N Da Doe wit da nappy 'fro I'm still freaky
On citas, bonitas senoritas

Turn the tool is the way they stay up on the feature
I see my nigga in the traffic, wassup-e?
Brotha by another motha, first 'cuz, worst bloody
I mixed big with husky brusky

Quarterbackin', trust me, rugby rush me
Color purple still in the sweet it's ugly
I don't know you but you loving me fresher than Doug E
Look at what the motherfucking rap game done to me

To a grown nigga run the beat
Here comes Keak Da Sneak
Sell talk, what to do with technique, nothing but heat
Sell talk, what to do on this beat, this for the street

[Repeat Hook]

[Verse 3]
First, second verse, this my third
Sixth grade driving to school I had a Firebird
I don't think they knowing that's my word
Oh you hip now? I was problem child you was nerd

I was being bad you was being good
But all this time had a destiny to save the hood
All that shit I been through look at me now
I'm striking like a match, man, back to tha town (Back to the town)

Bennie cap fowl and my mug on mean (Mean)
Waking up your family with 4 15's (4 15's)
In the driveway they can't stand me
Die hard Raider Sneak Davis, Draft Randy
Moss (Sukasuk)
Boss gonna be flossing (Floss)
Put it on thick like MAC lip gloss (MAC lip gloss)
Oh inhale that shit mayne I ain't taking a loss
But pay, this shit cost cause I been had sauce

[Repeat Hook]
