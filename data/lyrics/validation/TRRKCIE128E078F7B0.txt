Well I have stood upon the mountain
I have seen the other side
Wrestled with the devil
I have wrestled with my pride
Been down in the valley
I have stood out in the rain
Seen my love forsaken
Felt the pleasure and the pain
There's one thing that's for certain
One chord that rings true
Well it's a mighty world we live in
But the truth is we're only passin' thru
I have cried in tears of sadness
I have cried in tears of joy
I have found a life worth livin'
From the peace within the noise
I have turned my back on hatred
Lyin', prejudice, and greed
Found the future in the present
Found hope within a seed
One thing that's for certain
One chord that rings true
It's a mighty world we live in
But the truth is we're only passin' thru
Passin' thru, passin' thru
It's a mighty world we live in but the truth is
We're only passin' thru
I have seen my bucket empty
Seen my well run dry
But there's water down the road
And I'm only goin' by
If I'm settin' on dead-ready
When my chances come to knock
I'll make it where I'm goin'
I'll be tall just like a rock
But there's one thing that's for certain
One chord that rings true
It's a wicked world we live in
But the truth is we're only passin' thru
Passin' thru, passin' thru
It's a mighty world we live in but the truth is
We're only passin' thru
Yeah, it's a mighty world we live in but the truth is
We're only passin' thru
