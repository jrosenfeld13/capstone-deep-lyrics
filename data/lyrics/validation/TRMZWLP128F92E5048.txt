In the wintertime keep your feet warm
But keep your clothes on and don't forget me
Keep the memories but keep your powder dry too

In the summer by the pool side
While the fireflies are all around you
I'll miss you when I'm lonely, I'll miss the sunshine too

No, don't forget me, please don't forget me
Make it easy on me just for a little while
You know I'll think about you, I hope you think about me too

When we're older and little slower
It doesn't matter now, come on get happy
'Cause nothing lasts forever but I will always love you

No, don't forget me, please don't forget me
Make it easy on me just for a little while
You know I'll think about you, I hope you think about me too
