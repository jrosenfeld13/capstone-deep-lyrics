Lalalalalalala la la
We gon' put some people back together today ha
Lalalalalalala la la
Somebody gon' thank me after this song man
Lalalalala la la
Matter of fact, I'ma thank me right now
Lalalalala la la ohhhhhhh

Girl I apologize I'm to blame
And I can't sympathise with your pain
If I could I'd make it go away
But I can't
So I concentrate on more realistic things
Like questioning:
Is there anything here worth salvaging?

BRIDGE
Is it over?
How do we go about deciding?
Do we add up all the good times then divide them
By how many times we hurt each other?
Or do we just ignore the numbers and vow right now to never ever take asunder?

CHORUS
Let's stay together
Can we agree to just disagree?
Let's stay together
Don't do it for the kids do it for me
Let's stay together
I'm tired of all this making up and breaking up
Let's stay together (together)
Let's stay together yeah

Girl I can't justify what I've done
Ain't got no reasons why not even one
I Pray to God what seems like every morning for the sun
To shine on us just one more time
And Let me hold you in my arms and we'd just cry

BRIDGE
Is it over?
How do we go about deciding?
Do we add up all the good times then divide them
By how many times we hurt each other?
Or do we just ignore the numbers and vow right now to never ever take asunder?

CHORUS
Let's stay together
Can we agree to just disagree?
Let's stay together

Don't do it for the kids do it for me
Let's stay together
I'm tired of all this making up and breaking up
Let's stay together (together)

(Aight' you wanna make me say it you wanna make me say it)
See if you leave
(I would not die physically)
But emotionally
(Might as well bury me)
For I can't be the man I should have been
Before all of this happened
But if we hold on
(And ask God for direction)
Where we went wrong
(We can make the correction if we)
Just stay strong
All of our up and downs
Fully come around
And there will be nothing that can shake us
Nothing that can break us
We will stay together

CHORUS
Let's stay together
Can we agree to just disagree?
Let's stay together
Don't do it for the kids do it for me
Let's stay together
I'm tired of all this making up and breaking up
Let's stay together (together)

(Put ur hands together man)

(Lyfe talking:)
This is where it all comes to a head at
Are all these years worth nothing
Is it over?
You don't wanna be with him, he don't wanna be with you
Hell you done made some mistakes too
He done made some mistakes you done made some mistakes before man
Work it out man
And you dudes out there
Anybody can be slick at talking
Anybody can be slick at talking, man
Try to be slick at listening, man
Your work is at home
It ain't in the streets, it's at home
So get there, get there
And stay there
