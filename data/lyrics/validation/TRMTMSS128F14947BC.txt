I'm running away from a feeling
Hiding my face in the sand
I'm scared to love and lose again
I don't know if I can

I don't need the night to remind me
Where the lonely people go
I try running away from love
But my heart keeps telling me no

Too many people
Standing in the shadow of love
Too many people
Standing in the shadow
Standing in the shadow of love

I've been living so long in the darkness
I know the cold embrace of the night
When morning comes I close my eyes
'Cause I'm blinded with the light

Taking a chance on a feeling
Is like waiting for a flower to grow
So I stand at the crossroad, baby
Wondering which way to go

Too many people
Standing in the shadow of love
Too many people
Are standing in the shadow
Standing in the shadow of love

I'm running away from a feeling
Hiding my face in the sand
I'm scared to love and lose again
I don't know if I can

I don't need the night to remind me
Where the lonely people go
I try running away from love
But my heart keeps telling me no, no

Too many people
Standing in the shadow of love
Too many people
Standing in the shadow
Standing in the shadow

Too many people
Standing in the shadow of love
Too many people
Standing in the shadow of love

Too many people
Standing in the shadow of love
Too many people
Standing in the shadow of love
