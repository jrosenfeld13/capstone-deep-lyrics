[Verse 1]
The way things have fallen
Can't be afraid anymore
First we were water
In creation lake
Has to start to end
To go where life lives

[Chorus]
There're 24 parts in a day that divides me from you
24 parts in a day that divides me from you

[Verse 2]
The way things have fallen
Can't be afraid anymore
First we were water
Came from clouds, hit the ground
Mama's the sweetest
Alarm clock around

[Chorus]
There're 24 parts in a day that divides me from you
24 parts in a day that divides me from you
24 parts in a day that divides me from you
