I tore my letter up, I couldn't even start
To tell you what's really here in my heart
There's only so much that words can say
So I send you a piece of this beautiful day

Oh, I want you to know that I took a rainbow
And sent it off in a letter to you
Took some flowers in the spring, made a sweet clover ring
And sent it off in a letter to you
Took a song from the lark - the moon frm the dark
A spark from the sparklin' dew
With a kiss and a hug and a whole lot of love
I sent 'em off in a letter to you

I took the mornin' sun peekin' through the trees
And the dandelion silk tangled in the breeze
I folded 'em up - sealed 'em with a kiss
It's the kind of letter that you can't resist

Oh, I want you to know that I took a rainbow
And sent it off in a letter to you
Took some flowers in the spring, made a sweet clover ring
And sent it off in a letter to you
Took a song from the lark - the moon frm the dark
A spark from the sparklin' dew
With a kiss and a hug and a whole lot of love
I sent 'em off in a letter to you

In a day or two - just you wait and see
You're gonna get a special delivery
You'll know the way I feel - there can't be any doubt
When you open it up and let the love spill out
