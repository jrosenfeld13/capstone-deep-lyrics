If nature sold herself on layaway
In a little town
I would be the first in line
And buy myself a sound
A waterfall a tidal wave or a breathing of the trees
A heavy wind a thunder or a falling of the leaves
And I would proclaim
I'm the new proprietor of a sound
In a press conference held
Downtown
When the people would look at me
In distain I would simply tell them this
At least you'll have someone to blame for
Ruining your weekend
I would play mother nature
Unlease my sound at will
No more sitting and waiting
On this cracked window sill
If I feel like love
I will shake the trees
If I'm consumed in lonliness then
I will drop the leaves
And I would proclaim
I'm the new proprietor of a sound
In a press conference held
Downtown
When the people would look at me
In distain I would
Simply say outright
At least you have someone
To blame for scaring
The children in the night
What if I call for a waterfall
Some light rain
And some other owner calls
For a massive hurricaine
We'd have to be responsible users
And respect the rules of God
I'll just take a load off and
Have to buy them all
And I would proclaim
I'm the new proprietor of a sound
In a press conference held
Downtown
When the people would look at me
In distain I would
Simply say
At least you have someone
To blame for a near perfect day
