Lover
There is no other
Someday you will discover
That we could not lose
We'd break all the rules

Lover
Why do you suffer
I don't wanna be your mother
I have no shame
Love's not a fair game

We long the hour
Nearing the end
One superpower
Superhuman
How could you never
Want to feel this way again
Remember when

Lover
Leave while I'm sober
This moment will pass us over
You have become wise
Much to your surprise

We long the hour
Nearing the end
One superpower
Superhuman
How could you never
Want to feel this way again
Remember when

Where to begin
My long lost friend
Let's start again
Tomorrow

Lover
This is no fable
Together we might be able
Laugh if you like
You know that I'm right

We long the hour
Nearing the end
One superpower
Superhuman
How could you never
Want to feel this way again
Remember when

Lover
