Lovely little lady
You've got me on the run
You're a love machine
And you say that I'm your gun
But I don't care
'Cause I've got to know
Oh oh
You said you're a loser
The kind that came up rusted
So I had to try hard to
Satisfy your thirst
But I don't care
'Cause I've got to know
The only time she's happy
Is when the bullets fly, yea
And she'll make you feel
You're better than any other guy
And I don't care
'Cause I've got to know
So, lovely little lady
You've got me on the run, yeah
You're a love machine
And I'm tryin' to be your gun
And I don't care
'Cause I've got to know
