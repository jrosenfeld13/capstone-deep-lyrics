My broken heart made it quite able to say
She was a devil in disguise
I loved her and she loved me, so she said
Should have known I wasn't the only one

But it really didn't matter to me
I was too blind with the love to see she only havin' fun
And my friends say that I'm a fool, a victim of her crime
But to me there'll never be another love

I want my girl, I want back my girl
I want my girl, I want back my girl

The emptiness in my life was [Incomprehensible]
She meant everything to me
Reality that she hurt me, yeah, she did
But I never thought that she would leave

I didn't care if she had her fun
Make love to someone else, baby, as long as I was number 1
An angel she may not have been, still I loved her so
You know, girl, you never never had to go

I want my girl, I want back my girl
I want my girl, I want back my girl

I want my girl, I want back my girl
I want my girl, I want back my girl

My broken heart made it quite able to say
She was a devil in disguise
I loved her and she loved me, so she said
Should have known I wasn't the only one

But it really didn't matter to me
I was too blind with the love to see she only havin' fun
And my friends say that I'm a fool, a victim of her crime
But to me there'll never be another love

I want my girl, I want back my girl
I want my girl, I want back my girl
