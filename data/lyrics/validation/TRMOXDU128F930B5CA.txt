[Chorus]
You're on top of the world
On top of the world and you can't get any higher
You're on top of the world
You're on top of the world tonight

[Verse 1]
It wasn't easy, it was hard as hell
You didn't get luck in a wishin' well
Never worked so hard, had so much pain
Wouldn't change for anything

Learned love from a movie screen
He was tough, she was wild at fifteen
Quit school and had no dreams
Wasn't going very far

[Pre-Chorus]
Then he got religion and she got a god
It's on her back and it's in his job
And it costs lots of money, honey - oh, no

[Chorus]
You're on top of the world
On top of the world and you can't get any higher
You're on top of the world
You're on top of the world tonight

[Verse 2]
Breakdown nearly every day
Shoulda known couldn't get away
Got lucky with the girl next door
She was lonely and didn't care

She was young, she was dark, she was fair
Wrapped herself around you with her stare
You'd explode if she would touch you there
Touch you there, touch you there

[Pre-Chorus]
Then he got religion and she got a god
It's on her back and it's in his job
And it costs lots of money, honey - oh, no

[Chorus]
Tonight, tonight
You're on top of the world
You're on top of the world and you can't get any higher
You're on top of the world
You're on top of the world tonight

Tonight, tonight, tonight, toniht
You're on top of the world
You're on top of the world and you can't get any higher
You're on top of the world
You're on top of the world tonight

[Outro]
(Can you hear me, can you see me)
You're on top of the world tonight
(Can you hear me, can you see me)
You're on top of the world tonight
(Can you hear me, can you see me)
You're on top of the world tonight
(Can you hear me, can you see me)
You're on top of the world tonight
(Can you hear me, can you see me)
You're on top of the world tonight
(Can you hear me, can you see me)
You're on top of the world tonight
Etc
