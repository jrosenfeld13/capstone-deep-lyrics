Brother can you spare me food
And give me a drink of wine
I've been travelling on this road
For such a long long time
I have seen the wonders
But most amazing of them all
I believe i've seen the face
Of the risen lord;
On a night like this there came
A stranger on the road
I saw him stumble, heard him fall
I helped him with his load
The further that we walked
Well the heavier it became
And i believe i've felt the weight
From another world...
