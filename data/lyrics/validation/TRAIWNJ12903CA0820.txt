Oh, mama, ma ma ma!
I met a boy the other day, he had barbwire in his underpants
I got a brick in my back, I lick him hard upon his head

Ah ya ya...
Oh, mama, ma ma ma!

I didn't trouble that boy, that why I lick him hard
Ah ya ya...

Oh, mama, ma ma ma!
That boy is coming at me, that boy is coming at me
Ah ya ya...
