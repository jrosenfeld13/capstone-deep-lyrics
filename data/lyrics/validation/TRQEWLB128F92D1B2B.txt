I tried to love her but she changes everyday
Wouldn't be much fun if she was any other way
One day she's warm next day she's cold
One day she's young and then the next day she's old

So round and round and round she goes
And where she stops nobody knows
Love is the feelin' that grows that grows
And where it stops nobody knows

She tries to understand the things that I do
Without ever thinking what she puts me though
I'll never be the thing she wants me to me
Until she loves enough to set me free

So round and round and round I go
And where I stop I don't know
Love is the feelin' that grows that grows
And where it stops nobody knows

Our life is short to be so long
Our minds are weak to be so strong
Alone together we come and go
But where we're goin' I don't know

Round and round and round we go
And where we'll stop I don't know
Love is the feelin' that grows that grows
And where it stops nobody knows

Round and round and round it goes
And where she stops nobody knows
(Now) love is the feelin' that grows that grows
And where it stops nobody knows, nobody knows
