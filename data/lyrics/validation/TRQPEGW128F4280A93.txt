Beached by the same tide when we met
Caught in a storm when we came together
I never needed someone like I needed you back then
I swear I believed it
I never lied to you
When I said what I said

I think you know it's the end of the story
You've been crying in your sleep
Time is the judge, tears are the jury
We've got to make that bitter leap
Love made a promise
Love made a promise
Time couldn't keep

We run from the truth
But we end up nowhere
And everyone knows you can't run forever
It seems that just wanting something
Don't mean it's gonna be
We played by the rules
But times made liers of you and me

I think you know it's the end of the story
You've been crying in your sleep
Time is the judge, tears are the jury
We've got to make that bitter leap
Love made a promise
Love made a promise
Love made a promise
Time couldn't keep

So we find another way
To get through another night
And we spend the whole night dreaming
Another day will find a way to make it alright

Time is the judge, tears are the jury
We've got to make that bitter leap
Love made a promise
Love made a promise (I said)
Love made a promise
Love made a promise (I said)
