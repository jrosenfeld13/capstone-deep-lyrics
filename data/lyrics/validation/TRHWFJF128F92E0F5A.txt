Love hurts, love scars
Love wounds, and marks
Any heart, not tough
Or strong, enough
To take a lot of pain
Take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud
Holds a lot of rain
Love hurts, ooh ooh love hurts

Im young, I know
But even so
I know a thing, or two
I learned, from you
I really learned a lot
Really learned a lot
Love is like a flame
It burns you when it's hot
Love hurts, ooh ooh love hurts

Some fools think of happiness
Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess
Theyre not foolin me

I know it isnt true
I know it isnt true
Love is just a lie
Made to make you blue
Love hurts, ooh,ooh love hurts
Ooh,ooh love hurts

(guitar solo)

I know it isnt true
I know it isnt true
Love is just a lie
Made to make you blue
Love hurts, ooh ooh love hurts
Ooh ooh love hurts
Ooh ooh...
