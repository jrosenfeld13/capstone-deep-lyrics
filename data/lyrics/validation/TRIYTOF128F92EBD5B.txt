The voice of reason keeps distance from me
Sedated, impatient, can't fight the craving
Demand a free life, figure out what this means
Stressed out, second guessed, smiling reluctantly
Staring out windows
The faces I watch ain't better than me for the shit they've got
I've never had much, there's one thing that I've sought
Fill my empty hands, I know it's not a lot

Call it a day
Eliminate
All that I can
Can't meet demands, we're all goddamned
Lost
All my balance in sick romantics
They continue to value delusive bastards
Back when I was younger this life moved too slow
Now my heart feels too trapped, so it's time to go
Always remember to never surrender
And laugh at the danger that kept us together so far
