Put a hurting on your parents
And left for DeVry
You made 'em cry
You followed your instinct
And late night TV
Technology

New-wave boys in courdoroys
You've got a few
You're casual
The tools of tomorrow
Will get you through
And beautiful

Believe me
You don't have to worry
Baby you're savvy
You don't have to study
To get straight A's
You'll get straight A's

As the future at your fingers
Gently unfolds
And you behold
Career of your lifetime
Before your eyes
You qualify

But if you are failing
And you need me
I'll let you cheat
And realize all the answers
Were already there
And you knew them all

Believe me
You don't have to worry
Baby you're savvy
You don't have to study
To get straight A's
You'll get straight A's

Believe me
You don't have to worry
Oh, you're savvy (savvy)
You don't have to study
To get straight A's
You'll get straight A's
