Baby do you understand me now
If sometimes I feel little mad
Don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong I seem so bad
But I'm just a soul whose intensions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
You know sometimes baby I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And then sometimes again it seems that all I have is worry
And then you bound to see my other side
But i'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
If I seem edgy
I want you to know
I never meant to take it out on you
Life had its problems
And I haven't my share
That's me one thing I never mean to do
Oh oh oh oh baby
I'm just human
Don't you know I have thoughts like any one?
Sometimes I find myself alone regretting
Some little foolish things
And simple things I've done
But I'm just a soul whose intensions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Don't let me be misunderstood
