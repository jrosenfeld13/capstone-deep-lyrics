(M. Gray, N. MacDonald)
You gotta shine your light on me, shine your light on me
Gotta shine your light on me, gotta shine your light on me, oh baby
Yeah! Oh oh
Lay down your guns, lay down your swords
No need for sorrow, there's no need for war, no
Open your heart, give me your hand, give me your hand
I'm gonna take you to the promised land

Chorus:
Shine your light on me, shine your light on me, yeah
Shine your light on me, gotta shine a little light
Shine a little light on me
On me
There's blood on the street, and fire in the sky
Don't look away baby, don't close your eyes
Look to the future, just say a prayer, just say a prayer
Times are a-changin', but does anyone care?

(chorus) - yeah
(Solo)
Shine your light on me, gotta shine your light on me
Gotta shine your light on me, oh baby, you gotta shine your light on me
Shine on, shine on, shine on, shine on, shine on, shine on
Shine on, shine on shine on shine on shine on
I said there's blood on the street, and there's fire in the sky
I said don't look away baby, no don't close your eyes, oh no no no
Shine your light on me, shine your light on me, yeah
Shine your light on me, you gotta shine your light on me, yeah
