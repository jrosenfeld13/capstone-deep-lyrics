You're closing off to me and showing no emotion
Hey, i'll never give up on you
The song you used to sing is swimming in distortion
Hey, i'll never give up on you

You
You
You

I can't save (save) you (you) from all the things i put you through
Or change who you are because of me
I just hate the things about myself (myself) i see (i see) in you

It's hard to tell if this is real or my reflection
Hey, i'll never give up on you
This negativity is not the right direction
Hey, i'll never give up on you

You
You
You

I can't save (save) you (you) from all the things i put you through
Or change who you are because of me
I just hate the things about myself (myself) i see (i see) in you

Push the anger out
To let it have your soul
Listen to me now
And Never lose control

I can't save (save) you (you) from all the things i put you through
Or change who you are because of me
I just hate the things about myself (myself) i see (i see) in you

You
You
You
You
