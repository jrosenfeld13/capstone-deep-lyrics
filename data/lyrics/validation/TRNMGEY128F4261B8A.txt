Momma said
You're not the guy for me
But I just love you boy
Wanna share
Our lives you see
Cuz you're my pride and joy
(Till the end, till the end.)

Don't be afraid
This happiness in me
And I'm here to open my heart
Open is right there to see
And I just want you to know
(Till the end, till the end.)
