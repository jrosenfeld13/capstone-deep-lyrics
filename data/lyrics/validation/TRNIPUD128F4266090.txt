[Verse 1]
After three good years together, we had our first big fight
So she went to her mothers' and I went for a drive
Down an old familiar highway, just a few miles out of town
To that rundown one-room tavern that used to be my stomping ground

[Verse 2]
Well I pulled in the driveway, you know it all still looked the same
And I couldn't wait to down a few and hear that jukebox ring
But as I walked in through the doorway, there stood some kind of Maitre D'
Well he looked me up and he looked me down, said
"May I help you please?" and I said

[Chorus]
What'd you do with those swinging doors
Where's the sawdust on the floor
Why's everybody wearing suits and ties
From where I stand I can't believe my eyes
And whose idea what it to hang these ferns
This brand new bar don't have a single burn
I guess I'm somewhere that I don't belong
I need a jukebox with a country song

[Verse 3]
Well I look back to the corner where the jukebox once stood proud
Some fool was playing records, too fast, too long and too loud
And it must have been a big mistake to try to speak my mind
So as they were asking me to leave, I cried out one more time

[Chorus]
What'd you do with those swinging doors
And where's the sawdust on the floor
Why's everybody wearing suits and ties
From where I stand I can't believe my eyes
And whose idea what it to hang these ferns
This brand new bar don't have a single burn
I guess I'm somewhere that I don't belong
I need a jukebox with a country song

[Tag]
I guess I don't belong
Without a jukebox and a country song
