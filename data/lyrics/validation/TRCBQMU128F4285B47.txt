I am home
From my past
Leave my throne
How would I go on
I have found
My own way
To survive
This devastating game
Time will guide
Days will come
How could I
Be doing nothing wrong
And I'll be trying every day
Be looking for the words to say
I only want to know for sure
If I am able to adore
The reason going through all this
That there'd be still a world to miss
And I the final moment
To see this is true
Time to leave
Memories pass
I won't need
No one to say goodbye
When I change
Who will tell
What has been
And what is going on
I hope to find
Reasons for
The Me right now
And the one I was before
So I kept trying every day
Believed I found the words to say
But still had no one to assure
That things were better than before
All reasoning would cease with this
Why I would keep on seeking bliss
Until the final moment
Believed this was true
