WE ONLY MET ONCE BUT ONCE WAS ALL IT TOOK
FOR HER TO GET ME TRULY HOOKED
IT WAS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT A FLASH IN THE NIGHT
AND NOW MY LIFE IS LIKE A STORYBOOK

WE NEVER KISSED WE DIDNT EVEN TOUCH
JUST THE SIGHT OF HER MENT SO MUCH
NOW TO LOVE IM INTRODUCED N IM BURNIN LIKE A FUSE
MUST BEEN SOMETHIN ABOUT CHEMISTRY N SUCH

I MISS YOU MISS BELINDA EVERY MORNIN
MISS YOU WHEN THE SUN IS GOIN DOWN
I MISS YOU WHEN IT SHINES N WHEN ITS POURIN
MISS YOU WHEN IM AWAY N WHEN IM IN TOWN
OH I MISS YOU MISS BELINDA WHERERE GOIN TO
YOU PUT FIRE IN MY HEART NOW WHAT AM I TO DO
I MISS YOU MISS BELINDA OH SO TRUE
MY MIND IS STUCK ON YOU

HOW I WISH I HAD SHAVED N COMBED MY HAIR
N DRESSED IN MY SUNDAYS BEST
BUT HOW WAS I TO KNOW MY TRUE LOVE WAS ABOUT TO SHOW
FOR ALL THE GOLD IN YUKON I NEVER WOULD HAVE GUESSED

NOW IT BREAKS MY HEART TO THINK THAT I
MIGHT NEVER SEE HER AGAIN
MIGHT BEEN A LIFETIME CHANCE FOR ME
COULD HAVE BEEN MY FUTURE BRIDE TO BE
N NOW MY POOR OL HEART WILL NEVER EVER MEND
