We'll look in all directions
Not a soul for miles around
This scene is getting old
Gasp for air, I'll let you up
If you will follow Me

This scenery is getting old
We'll leave this place tonight
This place is full of demons
There's no one left to save
So turn and face your King

Sound the alarm!
This fight will more than break our bones
You're such a disaster
I'll never sleep again

Catch your breath
Put your armor on
Now it's time to face your King

Please don't burn these bridges
Oceans swell beneath us
This place is full of demons
Burn it to the ground
