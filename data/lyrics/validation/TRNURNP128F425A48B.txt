I look around and I wonder
How much pain does it take
To admit to a failure
I've made a mistake

I talk like I hate you
I just need to be free
I don't mean to hurt you but
It's time to think about me

You say that you love me
You're making me cry

You say that you need me
But I'm not about to lie

Holding on to you
Is as mad as it seems
Holding on to you
Is the end of my dreams
Didn't know time could move so fast
You and I were living in the past
Holding on to you
Is as mad as it seems
Holding on to you
Is the end of our dreams
Didn't know time could move so fast
Before you know we're living in the past

Holding on to you is letting go of me

Was I ever so foolish
I tried so hard to believe
That you were the answer
But I was deceived

I talk like I hate you
But it just ain't the truth
While love lies sleeping
I'm gonna make my move

You say that you love me
You're making me cry

You say that you need me
But I'm not about to lie

Holding on to you
Is as mad as it seems
Holding on to you
Is the end of my dreams
Didn't know time could move so fast
You and I were living in the past
Holding on to you
Is as mad as it seems
Holding on to you
Is the end of our dreams
Didn't know time could move so fast
Before you know we're living in the past

Cos holding on to you is letting go of me

It's time to step to the future baby

Don't look back you know it ain't easy
When it's time for change
To make new arrangements baby
Don't look back
You know I can't lie

There goes my dream
You and I were living in the past

Holding on to you
Is as mad as it seems
Holding on to you
Is the end of my dreams
Didn't know time could move so fast
Before you know it we're living in the past

'Cos holding on to you is letting go of me
And I can't let go of me
And I won't let go of me
It's time to step to the future
I can do that baby

Make new arrangements baby
Make new arrangements baby

Can't let go of me
