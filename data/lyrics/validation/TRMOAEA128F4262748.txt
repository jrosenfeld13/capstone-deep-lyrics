Did you see the moon tonight
Did it shine the way I asked it to
By the time it made it's way to you
Instead of me
Inside your room tonight

It will dance across your floor
Make you remember more
Then you might want it to
But I want you to
Remember me

If you see the moon tonight
I hope it finds you all alone
Maybe sitting by the phone
Kinda sad and glad to be unhappy
'Cause your missing me
Like I'm missing you

If you see the moon tonight
If you do, don't close your eyes
You might get a big surprise
I might just fly across the ocean
And materialize
Then I could tell you that it's true
That I'm the one who turned it white to blue
Just for you, just for you

Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
