She wakes up early every morning
Just to do your hair now
Cause she cares you all
Her day oh wouldn't be right
Without her make up
She's never had a make up
She's just like you and me
But she's homeless
She's homeless
As she stands there singing for money
Dadaida
Dadadida...
In my sleep I see her begging
Reaching police
Although her body is not mine
I ask now I do (now I do)
She's just like you and me
But she's homeless, she's homeless
As she stands there singing for money
