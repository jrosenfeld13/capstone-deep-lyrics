It's hard to trust a stranger, but you're a stranger to yourself, so who's to blame
Drown away emotion as you numb yourself from any real pain

There's nothing more real
Then nothings what it seems
We're always caught in between
There's nothing left to feel
But still you cannot leave
You don't know what you need

And I know that you use me to use you
And I know that you use me to use you
And I know that you use me to use you
To use you
Yeah

Loneliness a ritual
The walls you build around us feel safe
Silence always comfortable
Is this the only reason that you stay?

There's nothing more real
Then nothings what it seems
We're always caught in between
There's nothing left to feel
But still you cannot leave
You don't know what you need

And I know that you use me to use you
And I know that you use me to use you
And I know that you use me to use you
And I know that you use me

I feel your arms around me
Wondering where
This will go
I feel your arms around me
Will you ever want this
Like I do?

And I know that you use me to use you
And I know that you use me to use you
And I know that you use me to use you
And I know that you use me

And I know that you use me to use you
And I know that you use me to use you
To use you
To use you
To use you
