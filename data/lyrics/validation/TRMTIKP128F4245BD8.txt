Your photo hung over the altar
Old friends dressed in black
It's the first time that I've seen you in ages
Hold on, my old time bomb

When everyone gather to the chapel, to the chapel
Everyone gather to the chapel, to the chapel
Everyone loved you, yes, everyone
Everyone gather to the chapel, to the chapel

I walk through the park where we hung out
Saw signs long ago
Try hard not to argue the obvious
Hold on, my long-term partner

Everyone gather to the chapel, to the chapel
Everyone gather to the chapel, to the chapel
Everyone loved you, yes, everyone
Everyone gather to the chapel, to the chapel

You left us in the dark, too
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?

Everyone gather to the chapel, to the chapel
Everyone gather to the chapel, to the chapel
Everyone loved you, yes, everyone
Everyone gather to the chapel, to the chapel
