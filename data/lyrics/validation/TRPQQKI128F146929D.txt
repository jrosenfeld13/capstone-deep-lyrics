I'm Not DrunK (I'm Just Drinkin')
-- Albert Collins
Every day, baby
When the sun go down
I get with my friends
And I begin to clown
I don't care
What the people are thinkin'
I ain't drunk
I'm just drinkin'
(But you're so high) Oh man, you know I ain't high
(But you're so high) I just take a little bit every now and then
(But you're so high) Aw man you oughta be ...
(Stay drunk all the time) Aw c'mon, don't y'all be like that
Come home last night
All a lush
Baby get in a fuss
I say, "Honey, hush"
I don't care
What the people are thinkin'
I ain't drunk
I'm just drinkin'
(But you're so high) Aw, I ain't drunk, I done told y'all I ain't drunk
(But you're so high) I'm just havin' fun
(But you're so high) What? ....
(Stay drunk all the time) I don't know why y'all talkin 'bout me like that

You done the right thing
I wanna thank you too
Now let's have a little drink
Just me and you
I don't care
What the people are thinkin'
I ain't drunk
I'm just drinkin'
(But you're so high) Who me? I ain't high, man
(But you're so high) I don't know why y'all are talkin' 'bout me like that
(But you're so high) You better mind your own business, brother
(Stay drunk all the time) You gotta watch yourself, too, you understand what I'm
Sayin'?
I wanna tip you baby
Before I go
I'll be back tomorrow night
And drink some more
I don't care
What the people are thinkin'
I ain't drunk
I'm just drinkin'
(But you're so high) Oh, no, you're the one who's drunk; look at your eyes, man
(But you're so high) Don't you pee on my leg, man...well, I ain't had but
(But you're so high) four...five...six...
(Stay drunk all the time) eight...nine...ten...
