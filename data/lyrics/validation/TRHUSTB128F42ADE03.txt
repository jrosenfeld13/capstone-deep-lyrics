What are we gonna do
Now it's looking at you
You gotta beat on your rival
It's called survival
And I don't mind
If they see it all
When you discover
She's got a loaded gun

She's got a loaded gun
And it's pointed at me
There's nowhere to run
She's got it pointed at me

I'm gonna hit on the town
But I feel fenced in
Did you forget the way
That you came in
And you don't care
For my living soul
And just remember
That she's got a loaded gun

She's got a loaded gun
And it's pointed at me
There's nowhere to run
She's got it pointed at me
(repeat)
