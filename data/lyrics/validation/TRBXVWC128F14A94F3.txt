[Intro]
Oh, Madonna, Madonna
Oh, Madonna, Madonna
Oh, Madonna, Madonna

[Verse 1]
I don't miss you
Just who you used to be
And you don't ring true
So please stop calling me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Your "I love you"'s are ten a penny
You're dropping clues like you've got any
You got to choose, there's been so many

[Chorus]
I love you, baby
But face it, she's Madonna
No man on earth
Could say that he don't want her

[Refrain]
This look of love
Says I'm leaving
You're frozen now
I've done the freezing
I'm walking out
Madonna's calling me

[Verse 2]
She's got to be
Obscene to be believed
That's her routine
Not what she means to me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I found myself by circumstance
Across a room where people dance
And quite by chance
She danced right next me

[Chorus]
I love you, baby
But face it, she's Madonna
No man on earth
Could say that he don't want her

[Refrain]
It's me not you
I've got to move on
You're younger too
But she's got her groove on
I'm sorry, love
Madonna's calling me

[Bridge]
Oh, Madonna, Madonna
Oh, Madonna, Madonna
Oh, Madonna, Madonna

[Pre-Chorus 3]
(I want to tell you a secret)
We're having drinks
With Kate and Stella
Gwyneth's here
She's brought her fella
But all I wanna do
Is take Madonna home

[Chorus]
I love you, baby
But face it, she's Madonna
No man on earth
Could say that he don't want her

[Refrain]
It's me not you
I've got to move on
You're younger too
But she's got her groove on
I'm sorry, love
Madonna's calling me
