This is not the end - it's just another song
It's only one opinion, right or wrong
Open up your heart - just one more time for me
Before we turn to face reality
Don't stop to think
This perfect chance may never come again
This is not the end

Let me use your ears - just for a little while
Ive got to find a way to make you smile

This is not my fault, i'm not responsible
These tiny grooves can only take so much
There's only one more thing i have to say to you
So long for now, be sure to keep in touch
This is not the end
