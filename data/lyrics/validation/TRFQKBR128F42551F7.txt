One child tries to do the best he can
Lay down takes it all in his hand
A fever's running high, it's out of control
My shoes are waiting by the old oak door

I'm changing lanes, gonna run away where the city lights won't blind my face anymore
I'm going to London town can you hear me
Just give me all you've got my girl
Here I am
I want to leave before you run me dry

I walk down Dover Street with the blood in my veins
A cold breeze chills my brain when I remember things
A fever's in the mist right ahead of me
But the lights are kinder here and it's a guiding street

I'm changing lanes, gonna run away where the city lights won't blind my face anymore
I'm changing worlds, gonna run away where the city lights won't blind my eyes anymore
Had to leave before you run me dry

I'm changing lanes, gonna run away where the city lights won't blind my eyes anymore
Going to London town, can you hear me just give me all you got my girl
Here I am
I'm changing worlds, gonna run away where the city lights won't blind my face anymore
Going to London town, can you hear me just give me all you got my girl
I'm sure

I had to leave before you run my dry
