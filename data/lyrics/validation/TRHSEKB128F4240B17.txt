In the open, come with me
In the open, come with me
You are the best I've seen
Something about your eyes
(They're so mysterious alive)
You've got the coolest look
That you try to disguise
(You keep away from the light)
You are most glad of all
And you got the brightest mind of all
And you know for sure
Saying love is great
But oh how you can hate (I know you)

Chorus:
They say you are the hide queen
Cos you are never really to be seen
And I know you once had a dream
To be yourself, but you could never be
Somebody painted & coloured you
And told you all the things to do
This is right, this is wrong
Now I understand
Catching the blood that flows
Chorus
