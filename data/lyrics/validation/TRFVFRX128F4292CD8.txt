This phone's growing into my ear
I made three hundred calls today
Though yours is the only voice that I wanna hear
I got to make me a living someway

I know you hate me doing this
You say I'm selling out
But how in the hell is a mad s'posed to live?
Selling's what it's all about

Hello, Sir, I'm the Pocono Land
Development Company
And I'm calling you with an offer of some land
That you'll just have to see
A quarter-acre plot, that's what I've got for you
Nineteen ninety-five, four hundred dollars down
And just ten bucks a week
It's two short hours from New York City
A Pocono Land Site green and pretty
There's lakes there, and trout streams
Mountain views, Country Dreams
Country Dreams

We dreamed our dreams in college, girl
Back then we thought we should
And we promised that we would save the world
Way back then we thought we could

I know you love your teaching now, but I wish you'd understand
There aren't that many jobs around, I'm doing the best I can

Hello, Sir...

I'm here with forty other guys
Crowded in a room
Making a living selling the moon
And rustic dreams in June
I used to hate the city now I'm dwelling in it
Used to love the country now I'm selling it
I'm doing well at it
That's the hell of it!

I said that we would find a farm
And live out on the land
It's strange how dreams come back at us
In ways that we had never planned
Here I'm selling real estate
And laughing at myself
If I can't have my country dream
I'm gonna sell it out to somebody else!

Darling, don't get mad at me
I'm doing this for you
It's really not so sad to see we had
Growing up to do
Please don't push me anymore
It's gonna work out fine
I know I said I'd quit before
But just give me a little more time
