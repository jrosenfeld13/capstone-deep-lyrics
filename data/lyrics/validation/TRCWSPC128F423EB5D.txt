[Verse 1]
Stand under
Fountain
Cool skin
Washed clean
Wash him from me

[Verse 2]
Along comes the wind
A big bone shaker
Blows off my clothes
Completely naked, what to do?
When everything's
Left you

La-da-da-dum
La-da-da-dum
La-da-da-dum
La-da-da-dum

[Verse 3]
Out of the blue
It is he
Vision to me
Bearing leaves
Petals green
Covers me
In all my shame

[Verse 4]
Hand in hand
He's my big man, stays with me
Some forty days, no words
Then goes away
I cry again

[Outro]
On my hill I wait for wind
And on my hill I wait for wind
And on my hill I wait for wind
And on my hill I wait for wind
And on my hill I wait for wind
And on my hill I wait for wind
