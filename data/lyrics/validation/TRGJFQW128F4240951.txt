[Verse 1]
Godless lot, it's not a lot
But it's my lot in life
No fear is my weakness I hear
When faith has been denied
Godless lot, it's not a lot
But it's my lot in life
No fear is my weakness I hear
When faith has been denied

[Chorus]
Same as yesterday, confused
Same as yesterday, confused
Same as yesterday, confused
Same as yesterday, confused

[Verse 2]
Walkin' through sticks usin' walkin' sticks
I've stuck to this so long
What I feel is so hard to deal
So I say, "So long"
Walkin' through sticks usin' walkin' sticks
I've stuck to this so long
What I feel is so hard to deal
So I say, "So long"

[Chorus 2]
Same as yesterday, confused
Same as yesterday, confused
Same as yesterday, confused
Same as yesterday, confused
Mine is the empty jar, the empty
Mine is the empty jar, the empty
Mine is the empty jar, the empty
Mine is the empty jar, the empty

[Bridge]
What you see? (It isn't always, isn't always)
What you believe? (It isn't always, isn't always)
(It isn't always, isn't always)
What you believe? (It isn't always, isn't always)
What you see? (It isn't always, isn't always)
What you believe? (It isn't always, isn't always)

[Chorus 3]
Mine is the empty jar, the empty
Mine is the empty jar, the empty
Mine is the empty jar, the empty
Mine is the empty jar, the empty
Mine is the empty jar, the empty
Mine is the empty jar, the empty
Mine is the empty jar, the empty
Mine is the empty jar, the empty

[Outro]
What you see? (It isn't always, isn't always)
What you believe? (It isn't always, isn't always)
(It isn't always, isn't always)
(It isn't always, isn't always)
(It isn't always, isn't always)
What you believe? (It isn't always)
What you believe? (It isn't always, isn't always)
