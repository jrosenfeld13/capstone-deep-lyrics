[Verse: Beyonce]
Sail on down the line, 'bout
A half a mile or so, and
I don't really wanna know
Where you're goin'
Maybe once or twice, you see
Time after time I tried, I tried to
Hold on to what we got, but
Now you're goin'

And I don't mind
'Bout the things you're gonna say Lord
I gave all my money, and my time
I know, I know it's a shame
But I'm giving you back your name

[Pre-Chorus 1: Beyonce]
Guess I'll be on my way
I won't be back to say
I guess I'll move along
I'm looking for a good time (time)

[Chorus:]
Sail on down the line, ain't it
Funny how the time can go, all my
Friends say they told me so, but it
It doesn't matter
It was plain to see that a
Small town girl like me, just
Wasn't your cup of tea
I was wishful thinkin'

[Verse: Beyonce]
I gave you my heart
And I tried to make you happy
And you gave me nothing in return
You know it ain't so hard to say
Would you please just go away, hey hey

[Pre-Chorus 2: Beyonce]
I've thrown away the blues
I'm tired of being used
I want everyone to know
I'm looking for a good time
Good time

[Chorus:]
Sail on (sail on), honey (honey, hey)
Good times have never felt so good
Sail on (sail on, oh), honey
(Honey, honey, honey)
Good times have never felt so good (never never never never)
Sail on (never, never, never), sugar
(So good)
Good times have never felt so good
Sail on (ohh, oh), honey (honey)
Good times never felt so good (oh oh)
