I tried on college, pumped Exxon gas
Fell for a poor man's daughter, cut a rich man's grass
Learned a lotta lessons the hard way, done a little livin' too
But if you think I got all the answers, yeah, I really got you fooled

'Cause I'm still tryin' to find my way around
Stumblin' through the world like I'm new in town
In the middle of nowhere without a map
I'm too dang proud to stop and ask

Still fallin' in love with the same sweet woman
Don't have to tell me I got me a good one
And I'd love to think I've got this life thing down
I'm still tryin' to find my way around

I bet I know you better than anybody else
There's times I'd swear you're headin' right
And suddenly you're veerin' left
You got a hand full of looks you give me
And I act like I know 'em all
Why can't I throw my hands up and just admit I'm lost?

I'm still tryin' to find my way around
Stumblin' through your world like I'm new in town
In the middle of nowhere without a map
I'm too dang proud to stop and ask

Still fallin' in love with the same sweet woman
Don't have to tell me I got me a good one
And I'd love to think I've got this love thing down
I'm still tryin' to find my way around

I'm in the middle of nowhere without a map
And too dang proud to stop and ask
Hopelessly in love with the same sweet woman
Don't have to tell me I got me a good one
Oh, I'd love to think I've got this life thing down

I'm still tryin' to find my way around
Tryin' to find my way around
Still tryin' to find my way around
Tryin' to find my way around
Oh, I'm tryin' to find my way around
