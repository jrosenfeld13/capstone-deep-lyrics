Have you heard about big red?
They even bought a beebread rig
To help the flowers in the mean space
They're trying to make that place green

Hope the bees will take away the storm
Hope the trees will take away the storm

Don't know how this whole thing started
There was a crowd and then we parted
Don't know if I'll ever go back
It's a long way across all of this black

Here I am in my bucket today
In the middle
Here I am in my bucket today
In the middle

They got a mule they call Sal
Bulldozing up canal walls
They're gonna tap that icecap too
When they do they're gonna make that green map blue

The weather is finally getting warm
And the weather is really getting warm

Don't know how this whole thing started
There was a cloud and then it parted
Don't know if I'll ever go back
That's how I felt when I left that tarmac

Here I am in my bucket today
In the middle
Here I am in my bucket today
In the middle
