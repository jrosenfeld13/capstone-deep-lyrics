[Verse 1]
Last night
I had a vision
I had a vision of your love
You kissed me
So sweet and tender
You took my heart
Oh, in sweet surrender
You had me wondering (wondering)
Oh, had me praying (praying)
Could it happen again tonight?

[Chorus]
Like it happened
Last night (as I was sleeping)

[Verse 2]
Oh, last night
While I lie sleeping
In my heart
Love came creeping
You showed me
How sweet it could be
Oh, if you
If you gave your love to me
You had me wishing (oh, wishing)
Had me praying (oh, praying)
Could it happen tonight?

[Chorus]
Like it happened
Last night (Last night I had a vision)

[Verse 3]
You took my heart
Oh, in sweet surrender (sweet)
Could it happen again tonight?

[Chorus]
Like it happened
Last night (last night I had a vision)
Oh, make it real
Oh, make it real
