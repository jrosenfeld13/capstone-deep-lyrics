My oh my I'm a restless guy
Got a home everywhere I go

Well I ain't good lookin'
And I ain't so smart
But baby I'm a sensitive guy
I ain't done everything there is to do
But I'll damn sure give it a try

I'm a lookin'
I'm a lookin'
For a big time bookin' with you
So come on baby
Let's go howlin' at the honky-tonk moon

I'm a rambunctious boy
Rambunctious boy
Oh my I'm a restless guy
Got a home everywhere I go
I'm-a trouble on the run
Heartbreakin' son of a gun
Oh yeah I'm a rambunctious boy

I'll be workin' all week in the big boss yard
I 'bout had it up to here
I ain't got time for a caribean cruise
Just give me a song and a beer

I feel like rompin'
Stompin'
And bronkin' it up real loud
So come on baby
Tell your girlfriend
There's a crowd

I'm a rambunctious boy
Rambunctious boy
Oh my I'm a restless guy
Got a home everywhere I go
I'm-a trouble on the run
Heartbreakin' son of a gun
Oh yeah I'm a rambunctious boy hey

I'm a rambunctious boy
Rambunctious boy
Oh my I'm a restless guy
Got a home everywhere I go
I'm-a trouble on the run
Heartbreakin' son of a gun
Oh yeah I'm a rambunctious boy
Oh yeah I'm a rambunctious boy yea
