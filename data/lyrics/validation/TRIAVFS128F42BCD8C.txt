(Written by Kostas)

Snowny days and frosty night
Everything looks cold and white
Hangin' 'round the mistletoe
Hangin' 'round the mistletoe

Christmas day will soon be here
And everybody's full of cheer
Hangin' 'round the mistletoe
Waitin' for you dear

Well, I've waited all year long
And nore the year is almost gone
Hangin' 'round the mistletoe
Hangin' 'round the mistletoe

But if that's what I've gotta do
Just to get a kiss from you
Hangin' 'round the mistletoe
Waitin' for you dear

Christmas is a special time
To give and to receive
For every little kiss you give me
I will give you three

You ain't gonna miss one kiss
That's one thing you'll never miss
I'm hangin' 'round the mistletow
Waitin' for you dear

Well, I've had my eyes on you
For a long, long time
So, I'm asking Santa please
Make that pretty girl mine

Waited till I'm cold and blue
Just to get a kiss from you
I'm hangin' 'round the mistletoe
Waitin' for you dear

Hangin' 'round the mistletoe
Waitin' for you dear...
