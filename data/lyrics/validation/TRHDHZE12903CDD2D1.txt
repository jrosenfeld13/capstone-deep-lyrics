Those who are laughing now
Will be crying later
Hope for the stomachs until now have been hungry will be full now
None shall be poor for ever, and ever, and ever

You've got to save, save those who've always had it better
We watched 'em play, they lost, now were the ones who pay
Reach out, reach out
Reach out, reach out

The only way is the way they've chosen, for us all
So sacrifice yourself to make sure the bad bloodsuckers don't fall
Reach out, reach out
Reach out, reach out

It doesn't have to be like that

Now whose to judge
We learn how to kid
But even if they not laughing now
It will be quite soon
Reach out, reach out
Reach out, reach out

Reach out, reach out
Reach out, reach out

The only way
The only way
The only way
The only way
