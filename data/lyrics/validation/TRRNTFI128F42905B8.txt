Traveling on the road to nowhere
And I was driving much too fast
Trying to be ahead of thing
But I always ended last
I'm a big city kid, with a big city life
That's all I know
Aiming for the sky
But I'm always heads down low

You came in and helped me out
Just like a miricale
You gave me strength to realize
Oh

When I had nowhere else to turn
You taught me lessons to be learned
You made this fool become a man
When I was down, when I was out
When I just couldn't understand
You made this fool become a man

Love's the only reason
That could change a guy like me
She made me see the small things
That I didn't get to see, before

You came in and helped me out
Just like a miricale
You gave me strength to realize

When I had no where else to turn
You taught be lessons to be learned
You made this fool become a man
When I was down, when I was out
When I just couldn't understand
You made this fool become a man

She's been moving through me now there and only
Time is mine, forever

When I had nowhere else to turn
You taught me lessons to be learned
You made this fool become a man
When I was down, when I was out
When I just couldn't understand
You made this fool become a man

When I had nowhere else to turn
You taught me lessons to be learned
You made this fool become a man
When I was down, when I was out
When I just couldn't understand
You made this fool become a man
