To the king of the land
There is an insurrection abroad
It starts as a whisper ear to ear and heart to heart

Perfect smile and a selling face
Perfect smile and a selling face

Oppression starts a revival
A reformation of will
What's done is done
I'll meet with you there at the public execution

Tonight we rest free men
Tonight we rest free men
Tonight we rest free men
Tonight we rest free men

The order is drawn smoke out the heathens let them know
Who is in control
It's your very own crusade
Light the torches
The party starts with a bang

Watch as they all fall down
Watch as they all fall down

This is an assassination no one's leaving here alive

It's your very own crusade
It's your very own crusade

Perfect smile and a selling face
Perfect smile and a selling face

Tonight we rest free men
Tonight we rest free men
