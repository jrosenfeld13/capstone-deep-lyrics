Words and phrases are lining up in my head
I'm catching my breath before I lay another verse on the table
I can't sleep in this bed, until I get the words out of head
And I try to embrace them all before I let myself get carried away
And I must say, a privilege like this doesn't come every other day
I have to thank all of you for the stay
Mistakes and heartaches, deceiving fakes
We do what it takes to protect ourselves from the demons and the snakes
Don't underestimate yourself
You have the strength within, don't sit on the fucking brake
This is just a wake up call
Don't think we know them all
Perfect is not what I want you to be, it's just not me, it's just not me
From spring to hard frost, I'm following you
Even though the design of our life was broken into a million pieces
But let us sit down, use some glue and tell me the fucking truth
Mistakes and heartaches, deceiving fakes
We do what it takes to protect ourselves from the demons and the snakes
Don't underestimate yourself
You have the strength within, don't sit on the fucking brake
