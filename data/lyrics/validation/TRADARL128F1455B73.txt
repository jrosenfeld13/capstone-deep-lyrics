Don't forget me
Even though you're gone

They took you away when you were still young
We needed to get to know each other

They took you away when you were still young
We still needed to get to know each other
They took you away when you were still young
When I still needed you

Don't forget me
Even though you're gone
Gone, gone, gone

We grew up together
We loved each other
There, where we lived
In Gikondo
We shared everything
Even our secrets
Because we were friends
Soulmates

And now they've taken you away
When it was still too early
So now my friend
Let me ask you this
So now my friend
