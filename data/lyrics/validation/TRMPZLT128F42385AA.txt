You see me riding in them caddy's with them girls you think they're classy cause there daddy's little girls
Til they get trashy in my flashy lil world
Hey pretty girl with your pretty face
Pretty girl your little secret safe

And sitting tight

But we can make it all own
If we make it home
Everything is moving so quick

Yo walk by him and he winks
Smilles inside I'm a lucky father
If you're only to knew yer daughter
