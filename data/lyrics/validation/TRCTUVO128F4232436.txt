You gotta dig your body and your head
Down in the snow
You gotta tie your scarf around my pole
To let them know
And I gotta take your arms around my waist
And you'll take mine
We gotta move our fingers and our toes
And we'll be fine

You're just a poor little city boy you don't know
What you're missing
I say welcome to the mountains
And you're just a skinny little city girl
You don't even know who you're kissing
I say welcome to the mountains

Hang on hang on you better put some wool on
We'll see the pine treetops from high above
Move on walk up to the mountains
And if we're lucky we'll come back alive
I gotta take your arms around my waist
And you'll take mine

We gotta move our fingers
And our toes and we'll be fine

(Guitar solo)

You're just a poor little city boy you don't know
What you're missing
I say welcome to the mountains
And you're just a skinny little city girl
You don't even know who you're kissing
I say welcome to the mountains
And if you wanna get high
Close to the sky
Welcome to the mountains (x2)
