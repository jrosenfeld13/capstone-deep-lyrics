These long days torment my mind
Am i blind
If i miss the worlds affair
Will i care
Beyond this world
The people dance around their king
Beyond this world
A light brings life to everything
I'll keep my eyes on the sky
Is it nigh
When he comes to take me back
Will i pack
Father keep my chair at the table
For i'm coming home
I'm just hitch hiking on this long road
But i'm getting close
Beyond this world
The music plays while angels sing
Beyond this world
A feast is now in the making
