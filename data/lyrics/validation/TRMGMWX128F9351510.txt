[Verse 1]
You sing, you shout, you turn the world around
Yeah, we come out together for you
You let me see the man I'm going to be
Yeah, we come out together for you

[Chorus]
Remember to shine
Let my love take you high
You've got nothing to lose
You're just a boy with the blues

[Verse 2]
You take a vow never to back down
Yeah, we come out together for you
And my dreams are bound to come true somehow
Yeah, we come out together for you

[Chorus] [x2]
Remember to shine
Let my love take you high
You've got nothing to lose
You're just a boy with the blues

[Outro]
Come out together, come out together
Come out together for you
