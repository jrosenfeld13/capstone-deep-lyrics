Well I'm droppin' bars like a page three star droppin' bras
My voice hits cars, I love music
Kept my voice locked in a jar for years
Now I'm here, I know you loved the way I appeared
Like cha-ching, I've come to br-ring
The vibe that's been hiding like Bin Laden
Turn the noise down, I beg ya pardon
I get ya, let this shit rumble your garden as the bass hardens
Miss L dot Harman, get the weirdest looks from bar men
They wanna go on silly like the Baha Men
The drama continues
Now like sexual intercourse, feel the tune in you

Abuse your speakers, lose your manners
Disturb the neighbours, this one's a banger
Fiddle with the volume, I beg ya
Fiddle with the volume, ya ya ya
Abuse your speakers, lose your manners
Disturb the neighbours, this one's a banger
Fiddle with the volume, I beg ya
Fiddle with the volume, I beg ya

Fuck ninety nine
My neighbour's got about a hundred and twenty-four problems
Sittin' on his mind
Beside the fact that I blare my music all the time
He gets knock down ginger on his yard from nine to five
Ha, wigidy wigidy woo
S.O.V.'s voice causin' feuds

Encouraging my neighbours to be rude
Unable to chew food
Due to my new tunes and my renditions of Waterloo
Waterloo, what who?
From ABBA to shabba, hip hop, grime to ragga
I blabber the weird grammar due to listening to hits like a hammer
Bang bang, everybody turn this up


Abuse your speakers, lose your manners
Disturb the neighbours, this one's a banger
Fiddle with the volume, I beg ya
Fiddle with the volume, ya ya ya
Abuse your speakers, lose your manners
Disturb the neighbours, this one's a banger
Fiddle with the volume, I beg ya
Fiddle with the volume, I beg ya

Bang bang bang oiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
People's complaining
Whinging and whining 'cos I'm here vibing
Bang bang bang oiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
People's complaining
Whinging and whining 'cos I'm here vibing

Allow country and western
I got a suggestion
The music in question is here caving your chest in
And I ain't got time for resting
I'm never snoring
Interesting, my living room noises are never boring
Grannies wanna kick my door in
We're constantly warring till one in the mornin'
Now lights off, lights on, I'm teasin' them
They think I've gone to sleep but I change the CD again
Now don't go on like you don't like it
You're only moaning 'cos your records are shit
And they skip, now just zip your lip
And come to my yard and flip the script

Abuse your speakers, lose your manners
Disturb the neighbours, this one's a banger
Fiddle with the volume, I beg ya
Fiddle with the volume, ya ya ya
Abuse your speakers, lose your manners
Disturb the neighbours, this one's a banger
Fiddle with the volume, I beg ya
Fiddle with the volume, I beg ya
