Momma I'm sorry you're crying
Triggers are built to pull
Gut wrenching heart felt is love
Blasting this guilt
Slow
Digging the trenches of pity
Knee deep in a pile of shit
Light up these torches and stand
Fight make believe

Slow
Lights out mister

Sorry that I feel so angry
Crawl to the bottle shop
Reach into my situations
Oblivious unluck

Bury the guilt, I'm free
Sorry It's all right now
