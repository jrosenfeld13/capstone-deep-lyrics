[Verse 1]
My moon, my man, so changeable and
Such a loveable lamb to me
My care, my coat leave on a high note
There's nowhere to go but on
Heart on my sleeve, not where it should be
The song's out of key again
My moon's white face, what day and what phase
It's the calendar page again

[Hook]
Take it slow, take it easy on me
And shed some light, shed some light on me please
Take it slow, take it easy on me
And shed some light, shed some light on me please

[Verse 2]
My moon and me, not as good as we've been
It's the dirtiest clean I know
My care, my coat leave on a high note
There's nowhere to go
There's nowhere to go

[Hook]
Take it slow, take it easy on me
And shed some light, shed some light on me please
Take it slow, take it easy on me
And shed some light, shed some light on me please

[Outro]
My moon, my moon and my man
My moon, my moon and my man
My moon, my moon and my man
My moon, my moon and my man
