And now the sound of time is passing fast
It's getting late, don't know if I can take much more
The way you talk I often wondered
If I heard the words somewhere, someplace before
I got so nervous when I called and found that lately
You had gone and changed your name
But I've got something on my mind
I want you here, I want you now
You'd better explain

Is it true you're running round now
Is it true they're calling you the Chelsea Girl
Is it true you're running round now
Is it true they're calling you the Chelsea Girl

Your best friend never calls you up but you don't mind
'Cause lately things are all the same
Ain't it strange how people always seem to know your face
But just don't know your name
Well, I don't care there's no-one there
That even turned around and say get out of this place
Last night I saw a shooting star
When morning comes she hides away
A real disgrace

Is it true you're running round now
Is it true they're calling you the Chelsea Girl
Is it true you're running round now
Is it true they're calling you the Chelsea Girl

Oh, Chelsea Girl
You have got me caught up in a whirl
I want you here now, Chelsea Girl
You have got me caught up in a whirl
I want you here now, Chelsea Girl
