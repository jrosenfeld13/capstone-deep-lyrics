(Melanie Safka)

What do you do when the people go home
And what do you do when the show is all done
I know what I'll do in the alone of my time
But what will I do with the leftover wine
A line from a poem of my childhood has said
That visions of sugarplums were gonna dance in my head
I'll spend my whole life making the time rhyme
But I'll still have a bowl of leftover wine
I'll spend my whole life making the time rhyme
And then I'll sing them a song of mine
You know I'm gonna do anything
Just to take up time
Cause I can't find a taker for the leftover wine

(and) what do you do when the people go home
And what do you do when the show is all done
I know what I'll do in the alone of my time
But what will I do with the leftover wine
I'm gonna spend my whole life making the time rhyme
And then I'm gonna run to the people
And I'll sing them a song of mine
You know I'm gonna do anything
Just to take up time
Cause I can't find a taker for the leftover wine
I'll drink some of yours
If you'll drink all of mine
Because I can't stand the taste of that leftover wine
And I'm gonna drink some of yours
If you'll drink all of mine
Because I can't stand the taste of leftover wine
And I'll drink some of yours
If you'll drink all of mine
I can't stand the taste of leftover wine
