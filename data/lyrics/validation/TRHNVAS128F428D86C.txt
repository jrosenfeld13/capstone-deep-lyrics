I caught a glimpse of your body by the river
I was alone and the sky went forever
I was the one that killed your father in the first world war
I once vowed to love your sister for a lifetime
Took her to the altar and left her like a wind chime
That was the dawning of the age of the cannibal world

Lord have mercy on my soul, have mercy Lord
Mama, have mercy on my soul

I took your wild peacocks down to the sawmill
And ground their bones into dust and blood meal
A rainbow of feathers and shame fell upon my wicked hand
Lucy, my love, get inside my Grand Torino
I tell you little girl don't go into the jungle
There's a million hungry insects there
And man, they're going to eat you alive, yes, they will

Lord have mercy on my soul, have mercy Lord
Mama, have mercy on my soul

Cold dead moon don't stare at me
With your bony judgmental eye
Only the peacocks and earthly things
Can judge me as they pass by
Can judge me as they pass through this world
Judge me as they pass by
Lord, he has my number under the thunder in his hand
