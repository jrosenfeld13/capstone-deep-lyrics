Can I get through to you now?
Can I, Marianne?
What are you trying to do now?
Come on, Marianne?
Ain`t no use in conversation

Poor little girl
You`re outta this world, Marianne
Everyone seems to think you`re too much, Marianne
Everyone seems to think they know you, Marianne
Why you don`t even know yourself

Poor little girl
You`re out of this world, Marianne
Wake up, Marianne
Oooh, I can tell
You`re a sweet little heartbreaker, Marianne

Don`t mind me
But I think I`ll see you later, Marianne
Don`t you go flip out, trip out, skip out
Poor little girl
You`re outta this world, Marianne

Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Or are you afraid of the shake-up?
There`s a better thing you can take up
Wake up, Marianne
