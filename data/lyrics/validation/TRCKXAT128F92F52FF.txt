Please just give me information
About the day ahead
I just need an inspiration
To get out of my bed
My old radio is on local
Spreading damn bad news
So I'm trying to be social
But someone blew my fuse

It's a new day
Feel I'm floating away
Like a new start for you
And for me
You and me

There's a monster in my kitchen
So I will not go in
They just start an expedition
To fix the mess I'm in
Take a look out of my window
The forecast's wrong again
Far too good to be creative
So who is to complain?

It's a new day
Feel I'm floating away
Like a new start for you
And for me
You and me

It's a new day
Won't you come along with me?
It's a new day
Spread my wings an fly up high

It's a new day
Feel I'm floating away
Like a new start for you
And for me
You and me
