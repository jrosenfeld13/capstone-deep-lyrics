Killing time 'til it's time to die
Do you remember when you were a child?
And the sky loomed above like a great mystery
We hoped we'd crash into the other planets

Growing old we become numb and obsolete
Growing into our accursed bodies
With tired eyes and a tired soul
Growing to fit into our accursed bodies

Can't wait to die
So I can get some sleep
Give up life just to get by
We were born into this curse
