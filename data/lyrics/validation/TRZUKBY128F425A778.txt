Dreaming again of the summer time
When the world was mine
Drifting again, everything you do
Makes me fall for you

Trying to keep it together
Without you around
You got me up here
And now, I can't seem to get down

Here it comes, taking over me
Close my eyes and I'm finally
Wandering with you

Here it comes, my own movie
In your arms where I wanna be
Wandering with you

Turn back the clock, what I didn't say
On the beach that day
I was afraid that you didn't feel
Everything I feel

Trying to keep it together
Without you around
You got me up here
And now I can't seem to get down

Here it comes, taking over me
Close my eyes and I'm finally
Wandering with you

Here it comes, my own movie
In your arms where I wanna be
Wandering with you

Didn't wanna be hurt so easily
You seem to soften the edges
Didn't wanna care if someone was there
How did you manage to open me up?

Again here it comes taking over me
Close my eyes and I'm finally
Wandering with you

Here it comes my own movie
In your arms where I wanna be
Wandering with you

Here it comes, taking over me
Close my eyes and I'm finally
Wandering with you

Here it comes, my own movie
In your arms where I wanna be
Wandering with you
