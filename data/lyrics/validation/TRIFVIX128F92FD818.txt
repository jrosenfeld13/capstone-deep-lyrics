You look like you've only slept for an hour
You smell like you haven't taken a shower
And your hair is so dirty
It makes you look like you're 30!

Your pants are slung way too low
I see stuff I don't wanna know
I wonder why you're so moody
Is it 'cause you've got no booty?!

[Chorus:]
Baby, please, you must be outta your mind
Do I look like I want your dirty denim?
Listen up, I'm only sayin' this one more time
(echo) One more time...
Can you hear me say that I don't want your dirty denim?
Dirty denim!
Dirty denim!
Dirty denim!

I hate to say it, but they're all the same
Thinkin' everybody knows their name
But how can they break my heart
If I can't even tell them apart?!

I can tell you think I'm impressed
But do you think you're gonna get me undressed
'Cause if you do I got bad news...
I wasn't winkin' that was just the booze!

[Chorus:]
Baby, please, you must be outta your mind
(echo) Outta your mind...
Do I look like I want your dirty denim?
(echo) Dirty Denim!
Listen up, I'm only sayin' this one more time
(echo) One more time...
Can you hear me say that I don't want your dirty denim?
(echo) Dirty Denim!

I don't want your, I don't need your
I don't want your, I don't need your
You pay 200 dollars to look like that...
You outta check out the laundromat!
(Donna C. "woo-whoo!")

[Chorus:]
Baby, please, you must be outta your mind
(echo) Outta your mind
Do I look like I want your dirty denim?
(echo) Dirty Denim!
Listen up, I'm only sayin' this one more time
(echo) One more time...
Can you hear me say that I don't want your dirty denim?
(echo) Dirty Demin

Dirty denim!
Dirty denim!
Dirty denim!
