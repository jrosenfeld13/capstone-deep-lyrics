Find a camera recluse
What is it that other people do that doesn't leave a bruise?
Its lurking under my skin uninvited
Silver paper thin i'm breaking through

I remember someone say that there's always a rat close by
I remember someone say that there's always a rat close by
An i think its time that you made up your mind this time
Who's still on your side?

I'm sixteen over my head the concept of pide
The scene is dead but i'm here alone
If everyone in the room could hear themselves sing out of tune then they'd feel like i do

I remember someone say that there's always a rat close by
I remember someone say that there's always a rat close by
An i think its time that you made up your mind this time
Who's still on your side?
