Oh, let me go
Let me go
Let me go, lover
Let me be
Set me free
From your spell
BR
BRYou made me weep
BRCut me deep
BRI can't sleep, lover
BRI was cursed
BRFrom the first
BRDay I fell
BR
BRYou don't want me
BRBut you want me
BRTo go on wanting you
BRNow I pray that
BRYou will say that
BRWe're through
BR
BRPlease turn me loose
BRWhat's the use?
BRLet me go, lover
BRLet me go
BRLet me go
BRLet me go
BR
BRYou made me weep
BRCut me deep
BRI can't sleep, lover
BRI was cursed
BRFrom the first
BRDay I fell
BR
BRYou don't want me
BRBut you want me
BRTo go on wanting you
BRNow I pray that
BRYou will say that
BRWe're through
BR
BRPlease turn me loose
BRWhat's the use?
BRLet me go, lover
BRLet me go
BRLet me go
BRLet me go
