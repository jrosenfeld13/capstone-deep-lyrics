Once you learn it's not instantaneous you'll be better off than you were before. If you're getting closer, you are getting close to the edge
I know that you've got a thousand reasons not to react to the things you've learned
Sooner or later you'll see that it's over the edge. Here is where your broken heart will find you. Here is where your bad times get you down

(chorus)
Don't stay where you are, I will only let you down in seasons. There's no one in this world who will not let you down. Don't stay where you are I will only let you down in patterns. Theres no one in this world
As I've been watching old videos, I think I know where the heartache goes. You can hide it away, but you'll be over the edge before you know it
Here is where your broken heart will find you.Here is where your bad times get you down

(chorus)
Don't stay where you are, I will only let you down in seasons. There's no one in this world who will not let you down. Don't stay where you are I will only let you down in patterns. Theres no one in this world
Don't stay in the place where you are, I will only let you down in seasons.Don't stay where you are, I will only let you down in seasons. There's no one in this world who will not let you down. Don't stay where you are I will only let you down in patterns. Theres no one in this world. Who will not let you... who will not let you down
