[Verse 1]
If I get the call
I will call across Radio America
Right across America, I will call
Yes, I will call all across Radio America
Right across America, I will call

[Hook 1]
If call I must do
To take my love, my love to you

[Verse 2]
There a lovely young girl on aboard
Walks down here
And all across Africa, China, and Australia
I will call
Call you down in New Mexico
In New Brighton and Tokyo
I will call

[Hook 2]
If call we must do
To take my love, my love to you

[Verse 3]
For well it may hap' that these, are they
Your happiest days
Oh my, good old friend
I see you chanced your arm again
You cut you arm again

[Verse 4]
Red faced president
Took afternoon tea with her majesty, the Queen
And they watched old films flicker
Across the old palace movie screen
Crying 'what a shame' as she slipped in the rain
The poor dancing girl she won't dance again
And they tell me this was a transmission
To take my love, my love to you
And only to you
Yes, this was a transmission
To take my love, my love to you
