I've been up here
Almost too long
It's only fair they should start to raise the fare
And I been laughing almost too hard
You replaced my heart then I'm left to
Stitch it up
And it only goes to show you can
Live with what you don't know and
Every step you're ever gonna take now
Only thing I do know

Jesus Christ
I'm on fire when you smile
Jesus Christ
I retire

It's so easy I don't believe a word
Love junkies gone over to the edge and he
Been thinking if I could see you now
I'd make you say this exists or not at all
Would it be too much to ask
If there's some one over there
Who gets every joke
And always in the same place
Only thing I can't face

Jesus Christ
I'm on fire when you smile
Jesus Christ
I retire
You give me such, such hope
And I need you more
You're all I know

Been up here almost too long
It's only plain they should start to see the stains
And I'm sorry
What I said before
You raised it up then you had to bleed the cut
And it makes an even keel of it
All I'm gonna see from it oh it won't go
Help me dig my own hole
Help me dig my own hole

Jesus Christ
I'm on fire when you smile
Jesus Christ
I retire
You give me some, some hope
Jesus Christ
I'm on fire when you smile
Jesus Christ
I retire
