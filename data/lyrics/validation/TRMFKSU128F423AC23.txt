[Instrumental Intro]

I am a sniper, always hit the mark
Paid assassin working after dark
Lookin' through the night using infra-red
Target's on you, aimed at your head

[Short Instrumental Break]

Ten thousand up front, ten thousand when I'm through
And I know just what to do
And you know I'll do it too
Then I'm coming back for you, back for you

[Short Instrumental Break]

I do the "getting rid of", don't tell me why
Don't need to hear the truth, don't need the lies
Now pay me quickly, now we're through
It brings me great pleasure to say my next job is you

[Short Instrumental Break]

Don't you know that
Killing is my business, and business is good?
Killing is my business, and business is good
Killing is my business, and business is good
Killing is my business, and business is good
Killing is my business, and business is good
Killing is my business, and business is good
Killing is my business, and business is good
Killing is my business, and business is good
You'd better believe it
