It's the smallest things
That have a tendency to hurt for the longest time
It's like you found a way inside

This time I'm not going to follow you down
I'll fall in love with the sound
So push me back and I'll stay the same
And fall in love with the sound of silence

I'm armed but the guns not loaded
I guess I could find a way out of this
But it's like you found a way inside
And i hate that i suspect you're right

This time...
Silence is golden but golden teeth are so much sharper
It's not easy but im biting my tounge off (x4)
Even though you're right
You words lie
This time...
