So you finally figured that i could work you out
This time i remember we began to doubt
You said the wrong thing
I did the wrong thing

So so, so much of the time
I don't know where you are
I'm starting to believe this won't go very far
This time, mistake is mine

I can see them looking over now
I can hear them talking once too much
Is this all we had to show for the seven years
Cause we tried and we might survive for the other wish
Is this all we had to show for the seven years
Cause we tried and we might survive for the other wish
This is my showdown

Maybe there's some other fella that you never know
Maybe hes some other one who'll never let you go
I said the wrong thing
I did the wrong thing
Like a fool i never listened i just put you down
Such a shame some other strangers gonna get you now
This time mistake is mine

I can see them looking over now
I can hear them talking once too much
Is this all we had to show for the seven years
Cause we tried and we might survive for the other wishes
Is this all we had to show for the seven years
Cause we tried and we might survive for the other wishes
This is my showdown

I can see them looking over now
I can hear them talking once too much
Is this all we had to show for the seven years
Cause we tried and we might survive for the other wishes
Is this all we had to show for the seven years
Cause we tried and we might survive for the other wishes
This is my showdown
This is my showdown
