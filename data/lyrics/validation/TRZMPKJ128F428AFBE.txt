Eyeballs float in wet green grass
I got a chain saw motor
That's filled with rain
But when it sings like Bach
The eyes all bulge
Then when the pink sun drops
The eyelids fold

While I'm in deep REM sleep
Or twilight zones
I take a freight elevator
And press fast forward
I get to grind these teeth
And peek through time
If I could bring things back
They'd feedback wild
When I saw the future - the geeks were right

Egghead boys
With thin white legs
They got modified features
And software brains
But that's what the girls like
The geeks were right
When I saw the future - the geeks were right

Predator skills
Chemical wars
Plastic islands at sea
Watch what the humans ruin
With machines

Eyeballs float in wet green grass
I'm in a chainsaw choir
In dreams that bend
To let me cut through time
And stretch out Bach
I make the dry eyes roll
And wet eyes cross

While I'm in deep REM sleep
Or twilight zones
I take a freight elevator
And press fast forward
So I can grind these teeth
And peek through time
If I could bring things back
They'd feedback wild
And when I saw the future - the geeks were right
