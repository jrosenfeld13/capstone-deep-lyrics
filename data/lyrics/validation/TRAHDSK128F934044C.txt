My Only Love
Deep in my soul
The love so strong
It takes control
Love we both know
The secrets there
The feelings shows

Drifting far apart
I make a wish
On a shooting star

CHORUS:
There will come a day
Somewhere far away
In ur arms I'll stay
My only love...

Even though ur gone
Our love will sitll live on
The feeling is so strong
My only love, my only love...

CHORUS:
There will come a day
Somewhere far away
In ur arms I'll stay
My only love

You've reach the deepest part
Of the secret in my heart
You've known it from the start
My only love

CHORUS:
There will come a day
Somewhere far away
In ur arms I'll stay
My only love

You've reach the deepest part
Of the secret in my heart
You've known it from the start
My only love, my only love...
