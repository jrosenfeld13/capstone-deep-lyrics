Duncan whom now is King of Scotland
Hears of a victorious battle won by his noblemen
Banquo and MacBeth
To award MacBeth for his bravery in battle
Duncan orders the rebel Thane of Cawdor assassinated
As the witches words unfold into this terrible tale of fate
MacBeth accepts the title Thane of Cawdor

I am mighty. Death follows in my wake
None will stand against my sword
I thank thee Duncan thou art of kingly blood
Proudly I do accept this ward

Thane of Cawdor dubbed by the king
All men will testify this day

Banquo, my friend can ye trust thine eyes
Set forth announce of my new name
I will enforce that Malcolm shall be heir
Of kingly blood they are the same

Thane to the throne of Duncan the king
All men will testify this day

The sister's words have come to light
To seize the throne with all my might
The throne is in sight!

I must devise a way Duncan's crown to gain
I know it's madness, I'm compelled
M'lady must aid my hand, I cannot commit alone
Deep in my heart this madness swells

Thane of Cawdor soon to be king
In bloody crime of fate
