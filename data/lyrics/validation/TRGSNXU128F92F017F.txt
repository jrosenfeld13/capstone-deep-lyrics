The whole town's talking
About you and your new girl
You're flying high now, Jack
And you're seeing the world
But you're gonna need me
You're gonna need me, daddy
And it won't be long
No, no, no, no
No, it won't be long
You're telling everybody
Walking papers coming through
But I don't know anything about that
Seems like only you
But you're gonna need me
You're gonna need me, daddy
And it won't be long
When she leaves you
And says goodbye
Don't come back to me
With tears in your eyes
You had a good thing once
And you done me wrong
But I warned you, yes, I did
That it won't be long, no, no
So you've got your girl
Walking papers too
It's all cleared up
Our marriage is through
But you're gonna need me
You're gonna need me, daddy
And it won't be long
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're gonna need me, daddy
And it won't be long
I knew you'd be right on back
You're gonna need me, daddy
And it won't be long
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're gonna need me, daddy
And it won't be long
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're gonna need me, daddy
