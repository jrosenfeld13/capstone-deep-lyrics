V1
From hell and back to Hollywood, chasing down a dream
You took the bad you took the good, and all the in betweens
You knew I might be crazy, but you kept it to yourself
I built a house of cards for us, you played the hand you were dealt

Chorus
Ain't it just like me, to dance around the truth
Ain't it just like me baby, to play it fast and loose
But you always believed in me, no matter what I do
Ain't it just like you baby, ain't it just like you

Sax refrain

V2
Another day, another doubt, another night your holding out
Lovin' arms around me, to keep the fire from goin' out
And even when I'm far away, you go to any length
I've always been your weakness, you've always been my strength
Chorus
Ain't it just like me, to dance around the truth
Ain't it just like me baby, to play it fast and loose
But you always believed in me, no matter what I do
Ain't it just like you baby, ain't it just like you

Guitar solo

Bridge
If my life was a story book, what would you call it at the end of the day?
Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief, it never mattered to you any way

Chorus
Ain't it just like me, to dance around the truth
Ain't it just like me baby, to play it fast and loose
But you always believed in me, no matter what I do
Ain't it just like you baby, ain't it just like you
Outro
Guitar and sax trade and play off each other
