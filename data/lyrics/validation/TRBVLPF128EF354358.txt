Atlanta lady, I'm losing my mind
Girl, I want my arms around you now
For the thrill of you one more time
There's just something about your love
There's just something about you

You make me laugh, you take me away
Girl, I miss your sweet caress right now
And the thrill of you one more time
There's just something about your love
There's just something about you

You changed my life
With just the wave of your smile
Soothed my doubt
And eased my worried mind

You gave me love and affection
Open my direction
It's what you gave me, girl
That's what you gave me, yeah

Georgia woman, you're so far away
I can see me loving you again
For the thrill of you just one more time
There's just something about your love
There's just something about you

You changed my life
With just the wave of your smile
Soothed my doubt
And eased my worried mind

You gave me love and affection
Open my direction
It's what you gave me, girl
That's what you gave me, yeah

Atlanta lady, I'm losing my mind
Girl, I want my arms around you now
For the thrill of you one more time
There's just something about your love
There's just something about you

There's just something about your love
There's just something about you
