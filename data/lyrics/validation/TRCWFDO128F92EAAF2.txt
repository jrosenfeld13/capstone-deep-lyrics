Coming home late from work, standing outside in the dark
It's three o'clock and I'm fumbling for my keys
I ought to fix that front porch light, maybe tomorrow I'll remember
Then I laugh when I remember that I won't
Maybe it's wasting time, the way I'm spending mine
Guess I should get something done
While everyone's asleep, I claim that time for me
And it's too dark to be mowing that lawn
Pickin' up pork chop bones left on the floor by my bad dog
Mumbling to myself
Take a look in the fridge, grab some Tostitos and picante sauce
And I'm headed for my chair
Maybe it's wasting time, the way I'm spending mine
Guess I should get something done
While everyone's asleep, I claim that time for me
And it's tood dark to be mowing that lawn
Enough of that TV jones
Turn it off and crawl into bed with my dead wife
Fumbling with my sheets
Turn out the light, turn over and kick out my cat
It's a Sleepytime Cartoon
Maybe it's wasting time, the way I'm spending mine
Guess I should get something done
While everyone's asleep, I claim that time for me
And it's too dark to be mowing that lawn
