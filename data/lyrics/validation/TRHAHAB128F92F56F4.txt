I don't want your progress
It tries to kill
Me

You don't want these trees
You only want towns and cities
You don't want me
'cause I oppose them
You want me to leave
All i want to do is breathe
You want to devastate
Homes that aren't yours

I don't want your progress
It tries to kill
Me

I don't want your progress
It pretends that it wants me
It doesn't want me for myself
It only wants my money
This is just a wood to you
But this is my home
It may not resemble your house
So you're right and I'm wrong

I don't want your progress
It tries to kill
Me
Me
You
We

I don't want your progress
It tries to kill
Me
