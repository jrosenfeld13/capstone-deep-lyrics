Before you close your eyes
There is something that was meant for you to see
Like falling snow

Before you close your eyes
There is something that was meant for you to see
The light I cast

I know it is
I know we can't
Let's pretend this night
It doesn't mean a thing
Let's pretend this night

You know it is
You know we can't
Let's pretend this night
It doesn't mean a thing to me
Let's pretend this night

I know it is
I know we can't
Let's pretend this night
It doesn't mean a thing
Let's pretend this night

You know it is
You know we can't
Let's pretend this night
It doesn't mean a thing to me
Let's pretend this night

Before you open your eyes
There is something that was meant for you to dream
I saw your lies

Before you open your eyes
There is something that was meant for you to dream
I'll show you how

I know it is
I know we can't
Let's pretend this night
It doesn't mean a thing
Let's pretend this night

You know it is
You know we can't
Let's pretend this night
It doesn't mean a thing to me
Let's pretend this night

It doesn't mean a thing to me

It doesn't mean a thing to me
Let's pretend this night

It doesn't mean a thing to me

It doesn't mean a thing to me
Let's pretend this night
