By suprise he's in line
For the gift that you find out where i survived
So i told him a lie
In hopes that he might not try too hard to try
It's nice to see i'm half asleep now
What am i doing?
How do i get to his?
Half a day in bed and half that asleep
Legs leaning on legs and a smile to freeze you there
Delaying sleep for our company
Keeps us and the night going
Conversations go beyond tangible concepts
And were drawing our parallels
In the most horrible of ways
Conclude my legacy
End the nightmare
I can cause others' tragedy but i prevent my own
We realize it's an idea of immeasurable trepidation
But it all comes too easily
So easily too easily
