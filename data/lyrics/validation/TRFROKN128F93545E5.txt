Hip, hop, hoop . . . oh ho ah ha !

Hip, I didn't know lips could kiss, ( Hip hip )
Hup I didn't know wives could flirt, ( Hup hup )
Hoop, I didn't know girls could be like "Tina Marie"

( Hoop hoop ) Hip I didn't know I could sing, ( Hip hip )
Like a penny boat in a gale . . 
What she's doin' will be the ruin of me

( Oh ho ha ha )
Tina, Tina, Tina, Tina, Ah ha!
You sweet little schemer
Tina Marie ( Tina, Tina Marie )
Oh what you do
Your brand of voo do's too much for me . . 

Tina, Tina, Tina, Tina, Ah ha!

Some day I'll carry you off in my arms . . 

( Oh ho ha ha )
Hip, I used to be a good time Joe, ( Hip hip )
Kiss a gal and just let her go, ( go go )
Hoop, I really was dealin' free till a Tina Marie . . 

Mister Cupid you stacked the deck
Why'd you throw me a queen by heck . . 
Now she's braggin' she's fixed my wagon for me . . 

( Oh ho ah ha )
Tina, Tina, Tina, Tina, Ah ha!

( Ho, Ho ) Hip, she tells me to jump, an' I jump, ( Jump, jump! )
Hoop, she tells me to dance, an' I dance
Gotta listen or get no kissin' from "Tina Marie"
( Hip hip! ) Hip, she really did clip my wings
( Clip, clip! ) Hoop, I'm lookin' at weddin' rings
Is it human the things she's doin' to me? ( Ho, Ho. Ah Ha! )

Tina, Tina, Tina, Tina, Ah ha!
Oh Ho, how I dream of stealin' your charms
I'm gonna marry us
Some day I'll carry you off in my arms . . 

Off in my arms . . 
Oh Ho! Ha Ha!
