I creep down alleys and peep thru blinds, I strangle and kill any children I find
I like meeting people when they're dead, I take some of them back to bed

I'm a maniac, I'm an insaniac, I'm a maniac, are you a maniac too?

Catching, eating spiders and flies, seducing people on telephone lines
I like little girls of nine or ten, I love making love to them

Setting light to dogs and cats, breaking into old ladies flats
Why is everyone laughing at me? Why is everyone laughing at me?
