It's out of control
Going too fast
Seeing things you never thought would last
Like a blind man who takes the blind off
Like a blind man who takes the blind off
Naked truth hits you like the sun
Between your eyes
Naked truth hits you like the sun
Between your eyes
And everything's coming straight at you
But nothing hurts you like the truth
You've got to hold on to
The things that you believe in
Do you remember all the things that we believe in?
Just hold on
Tear in my eye
Still I sit here and laugh
You won't see it when I walk away
And everybody has got their advice
But you've got a problem
And no one can help when it's up to you
No one can help when it's up to you
Just hold on
It's time
