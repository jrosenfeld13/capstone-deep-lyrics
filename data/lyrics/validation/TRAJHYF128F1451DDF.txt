If we're grateful and we're thankful then we're spiritual
If we're hiding we're denying all the love inside
So don't let your spirit die
Lay down your arms and we'll walk together
Into the light

I cannot find the words to be all forgiving
It's gonna take some time
Cos the old disease got a hold of me
And I need to apologize
And it's a myth to say we block things out
When we really block them in
Oh I'm so sorry baby
But I'm doing everything I can

If we're grateful and we're thankful then we're spiritual
If we're hiding we're denying all the love inside
So don't let your spirit die
Lay down your arms and we'll walk together
Into the light

I cannot get to sleep cos I feel so angry
It's gonna take a while
Cos the old disease put a resentment in me
And the inability to smile
And it's a joke to think I'm hurting you
Cos I'm only hurting me
And I've been beating myself for so long now
That it comes so naturally

Love is the only thing that can set a soul free
Fighting everybody don't do anything for me
Love is the only thing
I need it, I feel it, I hope that we're gonna be
Grateful for each other

I feel grateful, I feel thankful, I feel spiritual
I'm not hiding or denying all my love for you
It's the feeling of being alive
Take hold of my heart
And we'll walk forever
Into the light
