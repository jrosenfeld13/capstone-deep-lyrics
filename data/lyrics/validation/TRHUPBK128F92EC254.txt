Shocked Orwellian races, gather united in grief
Nothing is left from the world they have known
Grotesque indifferent belief
Systems have failed, rules can't control
Corrupt dictators forever dethroned
Lies of the priest, trust of the blind
Failure of structures, manipulate deviant crimes

All nations hail the end of peace
New dawn, inception of disease
Age of revenge has now been born
By the mothers of all wars

Enemy of God
Purity and innocence is killed
Enemy of God
Peace has died the day when life stood still

Clash of demonic religions, hatred the human divine
Despotic aggressors, in triumph they reign
Fanatics bring mayhem to life, war of all wars, foreseen before
Freedoms, foundations exists no more
A genocide nightmare, the darkest of days
Chaos devourers all as hope and pride fades
Total carnage, sudden death
Sent from a morbid mind possessed
A godless Mekka now awaits, as hellish flames desecrates

Enemy of God
Purity and innocence is killed
Enemy of God
Peace died long ago when life stood still

Now the fury is unleashed
The hunter has become prey for the beast
Breathing savage disdain, malevolence ingrained
No emotion for humanity, tragically the palace falls
Burned are the imperators' halls
For their decadent facades, all their elitaire art
Exhibition of filth to watch for all

For those who died along the way, timeless glory awaits

Nothing can divide, terror is thy name
Last legion alive, set the world aflame
Enemy of God, masters you have none
Sweet the victory, when thy kingdom come
Enemy of God, cast deliverance
Fanatical divide, slaying innocence
Enemy of God, answer to no one
Bringing war from heaven, a thousand fires burn
