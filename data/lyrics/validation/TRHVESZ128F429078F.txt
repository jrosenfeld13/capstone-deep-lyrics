Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
Folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows some turkey and some mistletoe
Helps to make a season bright, season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
With loads of lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so we're offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times
Many ways, Merry Christmas to you

And so we're offering this simple phrase
From kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

[Instrumental Break]

And so Im offering you this simple phrase
For to kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
I wish you a merry, oh, merry Christmas
I wish you a merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas
Oh you can have a merry, merry
Merry Christmas to you
Oh Merry Christmas to you
