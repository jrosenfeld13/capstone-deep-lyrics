Clouds hang in the sky filling the view with a shade of grey
As cars are moving by polluting the air with a slimy smell
A building is rotting away in the face of acid corrosion
A piane is making the sound of an enormous explosion

It's a grey world
People are walking alone, talking not to anyone
The noise of traffic burns your ear ali senses disappear
Grey world [4x]

Dirt piling up everywhere
Cause nature's got no room to spare
Land destroyed for useless places
Trees replaced by concrete faces
Grey world [4x]
It's a grey world

[Solo]
