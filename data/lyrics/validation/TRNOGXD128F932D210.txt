Over the seven seals of fate
A thousand miles away
Your destiny awaits
Over the seven seals of fate
Your free will lies asleep
Behind the fortune's gates

At the market in town
Just for two coins
A yellow little bird
My father bought for me
But here comes the cat
And eats the bird
That in the market
My father bought for me

At the market in town
There was a dog
That bit the cat
That eats the bird
My father bought for me
But here comes the water
And wets the dog
That bites the cat
That eats the bird
That in the market
My father bought for me

At the market in town
There was a horse
That spilled the water
That wet the dog
That bit the cat
That eat the bird

But here comes the man
That whips the horse
That spills the water
That wets the dog
That bites the cat
That eats the bird
My father bought for me

At the market in town
Just for two coins
A yellow little bird
My father bought for me
But the angel of death
Visits the man
That whipped the horse
That spilled the water
That wet the dog
That bit the cat
That eat the bird
That in the market
My father bought for me
