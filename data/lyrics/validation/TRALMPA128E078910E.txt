Moving like the fog on the Cumberland River
I was leaving on the Delta Queen
And I wasn't ready to go
I'm never ready to go

Twenty-seven years of nothing but failures
And promises that I couldn't keep
Oh lord, I wasn't ready to go
I'm never ready to go

Let it ride
Let it ride easy down the road
Let it ride
Let it take away all of the darkness
Let it ride
Let it rock me in the arms of stranger's angels
Until it brings me home
Let it ride, let it roll, let it go

Loaded like a sailor tumbling off a ferry boat
I was at the bar till three
Oh lord, and I wasn't ready to go
I'm never ready to go

Tennessee's a brother to my sister Carolina
Where they're gonna bury me
And I ain't ready to go
I'm never ready to go

Let it ride
Let it ride easy down the road
Let it ride
Let it take away all of this darkness
Let it ride
Let it rock me in the arms of stranger's angels
Until it brings me home
Let it ride, let it roll, let it go

I want to see you tonight
Dancing in the endless moonlight
In the parking lot
In the headlights of cars

Some place on the moon
Where they moved the drive-in theater
Where I left the car that I can't find
But I still got the keys to

Let it ride
Let it ride easy down the road
Let it ride
Let it take away all of this darkness
Let it ride
Let it rock me in the arms of stranger's angels
Until it brings me home
Let it ride, let it roll, let it go
