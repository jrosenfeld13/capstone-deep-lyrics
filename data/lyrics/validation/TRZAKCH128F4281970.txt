There are two things I will carry in my pockets at the end
Oh, my darling
You are one of them
The way you look when you have a story to begin
Oh, my darling
That's the other half

And I will never lose them
No, I'll never never show them like a prize
I will keep them out of sight
And I will never give them up to any silly
Promise or a lie
They are mine until I die, until I die
