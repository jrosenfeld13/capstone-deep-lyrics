[Verse 1]
Baby it's Saturday night and I'm feeling hype
Dont wanna let this weekend pass me by
So I called up my girls Like "Yo lets meet a 12 cuz we out to night"
I've been waitin for this night all day me and my girls
Gonna show this boys how to play cause
I know its gonna be tight
But I ain't waitin on no damn lines tonight

[Hook]
I feel like crashing a party
V.I.P don't try to stop me
You can like my style but don't copy
Ladies let me know if you got me

[Verse 2]
I'm up in the club the whole hood is there
All eyes on me, yes I'm aware
So, you know I loves my thugs
Grab the mic, show some love
Now the crowd is jumping, so I make my way
To the floor we're gonna rock it in every way cause
I don't do this all the time
But I'm feeling the whole vibe tonight

[Hook]

[Verse 3: N.O.R.E]
You see it's some sunshine, it's some rain
It's some love and some joy and some pain
Yo, some get lucky, really make it in the game
While others get locked up for my slain
See, when we come through, see they gotta check us
You and your lil tetas, I'm in my chanchletas
And shit my mami chulo love me like menudo who need a pillow
I'ma sleep on her coolo shit
Pop that, rock that, who wore my socks hat yea
My own J.Lo, who could top that I'm smoking
Still feeling on your, if it ain't a private jet least be first class and uh
I'm always chilling with my lady and them
I got them living hood rich like baby and them the go woah woah
We still together baby we gotta hit up da clubs thats like forever baby

[Hook]
