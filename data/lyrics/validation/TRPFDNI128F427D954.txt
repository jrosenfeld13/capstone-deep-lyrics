Gotta break out find something else to do
I can't stand being stuck in here with you
Gonna have a laugh
Gonna break into a store
I'm so bored that I don't care anymore
Told our mate to keep dog eye
But he went and told a lie
They took us down the station
They done us for theft
Now my life's in ruins
I ain't got nothing left

[RIT:]
I'm not so ignorant I'm not a fool
So keep your intelligence
I am not a fool
Not a fool, there's nothing left
I'm not a fool, there's nothing left

Had to pay for a lawyer
Pay two hundred quid
That's a lot of money
For the silly thing that I did
People say that I'll get sent down
But I don't give a damn
Don't you try to say I'm mad
It's just the way I am

[RIT]
