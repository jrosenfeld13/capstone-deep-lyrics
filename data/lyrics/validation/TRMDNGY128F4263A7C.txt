Yeah, oh oh yeah
Yeah, oh yeah

I'm not the kind of girl to sit out on the sidelines
The kind of girl who doesn't say it straight from her mind
You're gonna know all that I'm feeling on the inside
I ain't into games, I don't wanna waste

Any time and all the energy we could spend
Being together boy forever you're my best friend
I got a little problem that I can't mend
You've been taking me for granted you

I don't wanna walk away from what we have and you know it
I'm not telling you all of this to make you mad
It's not about whose right or wrong
It's not about whose weak or strong
It's about what I need to make this last

A little more time, a little less wait
A little more heart, a little less break
Simple and true, what they say
A little bit goes a long way

A little less talk, a little more do
A little more me, a little less you
Baby at the end of the day
A little bit goes a long way

Don't wanna end up in a tricky situation
So I'm giving you my every indication
We can work it out together stop the tension
Try to understand, baby where I stand

I love you and I'm trying to be gentle
So let me break it down for you and make it simple
I gave my heart so you know what's essential
That you show a little love for me

I don't wanna walk away or let u go and you know it
I'm not telling you all of this to make you sad
It's not about the tears we cry
It's about how hard we try
To give a little more and see the other side

A little more time, a little less wait
A little more heart, a little less break
Simple and true, what they say
A little bit goes a long way

A little less talk, a little more do
A little more me, a little less you
Baby at the end of the day
A little bit goes a long way

And it hurts me 'cause I care and I'm telling you why
I'm unhappy so if you love me
A little bit is not that much to ask to make things right
Oh yeah, oh yeah, a little bit goes a long, long way
Yeah yeah, oh yeah
A little bit goes a long, long way

A little more time, a little less wait
A little more heart, a little less break
Simple and true, what they say
A little bit goes a long way

A little less talk, a little more do
A little more me, a little less you
Baby at the end of the day
A little bit goes a long way

A little more time, a little less wait
A little more heart, a little less break
Simple and true, what they say
A little bit goes a long way

A little less talk, a little more do
A little more me, a little less you
Baby at the end of the day
A little bit goes a long way
