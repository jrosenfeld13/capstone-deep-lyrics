[Verse 1]
Having said what I needed to
Having shown what I feel for you
What my intentions have been today
Now it's time for you to do the same
And no love can be guaranteed
It don't come with no warranties
It's a leap you have to make
It's the risk we all must take

[Verse 2]
Well, it's clear where the cutting line
Woke up deep for the longest time
But I can't offer any help
You must do this all by yourself
And no love can be guaranteed
It don't come with no warranties
So wake up, or wake up alone
If you want me, show some

Courage
Courage
Courage
Courage
Show some
