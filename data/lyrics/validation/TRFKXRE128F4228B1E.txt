Cutting Edge album version:
Oh lead me
To the place where I can find You
Oh lead me to the place where You'll be

Lead me to the cross
Where we first met
Draw me to my knees
So we can talk
Let me feel Your breath
Let me know You're here with me

Oh lead me
To the place where I can find You
Oh lead me to the place where You'll be

Lead me to the cross
Where we first met
Draw me to my knees
So we can talk
Let me feel Your breath
Let me know You're here with me
Let me feel You here with me

Lead me to the cross
Where we first met
Draw me to my knees
So we can talk
Let me feel Your breath
Let me know You're here with me

Come and fill me again
All I want is You, Lord
Come be with me again

Live & In The Can album version:
Lead me to the cross
Where we first met
Draw me to my knees
So we can talk
Let me feel Your breath
Let me know You're here with me

Oh lead me
To the place where I can find You
Oh lead me to the place where You'll be

Lead me to the cross
Where we first met
Draw me to my knees
So we can talk
Let me feel Your breath
Let me know You're here with me

Let me feel Your breath, Jesus
Some may call me mad
This is what I'm living for
All the money in the world
Can't take the place of one glance of You

Lead me to the cross
Where we first met
Draw me to my knees
So we can talk
Let me feel Your breath
Let me know You're here with me

Let me know You're here with me
Let me know You're here with me
