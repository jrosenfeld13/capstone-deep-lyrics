[Verse 1]
Weren't you the one that said, that you don't want me anymore
And how you need your space, and give the keys back to your door
And how I cried and tried and tried to make you stay with me
But still you said that love was gone, and that I had to leave

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you, talking bout a family
Now you, saying I complete your dream
Now you, saying I'm your everything
You're confusing me
What you say to me
Don't play with me
Don't play with me

[Chorus]
Cause what goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back

[Verse 2]
I remember when
I was sittin home alone
Waitin' for you
Til 3 o'clock in the morn
And when you came home, you'd always have some sorry excuse
And explaining to me, like I'm just some kinda fool
I sacrificed the things I wanted to to make for you
But when it's time to do for me, you never come through

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you, wanna be a part of me (eyyy)
Now you, have so much to say to me (heyy)
Now you, wanna make time for me
What you do to me
You confusing me
Don't play with me
Don't play with me

[Chorus]
Cause what goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back

[Bridge]
I remember when
I was sittin home alone
Waiting for you
Til 3 o'clock in the morn
Night after night
Knowing something going on
Wasn't home before me
You was, you was gone
Lord knows it wasn't easy, but believe me
Never thought you'd be the one that would deceived me
And never do what you was supposed to do
No need to approach me boo, cause I'm over you

[Chorus]
Cause what goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down
Gotta stop trying, to come back to me
What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down

[Outro]
It's called Karma baby
And it goes around
What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must comes down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
