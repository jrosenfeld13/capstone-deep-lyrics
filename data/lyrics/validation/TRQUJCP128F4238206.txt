[Chorus]
I got a kind-hearted woman
Do anything in this world for me
I got a kind-hearted woman
Do anything in this world for me
These evil-hearted women
Man, they will not let me be

[Verse]
I love my baby
My baby doesn't love me
I love my baby
My baby doesn't love me
Really love that woman
Can't stand to leave her be

There's nothing but one thing makes Mr. Johnson drink
Swear about how you treat me, babe, I begin to think
Oh babe, my life don't feel the same
You break my heart when you call Mr. So-and-So's name

[Chorus]
