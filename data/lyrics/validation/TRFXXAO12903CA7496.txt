Blues stay away from me
Blues why don't you let me be
I don't know why you keep on haunting me

Love was never meant for me
True love was never meant for me
It seems somehow we never can agree

[Harmonica bridge]

Life is full of misery
Dreams are like a memory
Bringing back your love that used to be

Tears so many I can't see
Years don't mean a thing to me
Time goes by and still I can't be free
