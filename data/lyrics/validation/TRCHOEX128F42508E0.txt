[Dissention seeds have been sown in the hearts of the two tribes. Tuatha De Dannan and Fir-Bolg have the same blood all coming from the children of Nemedus, but they will not hesitate to spill it, in Moy. Tura, where the first battle for the domination of Ireland will take place. Crom Cruach, the God Of Tombs the Great Worm God, will swallow all dead warriors' bodies with thirst and desire. A hundred thousand Fir-Bolg warriors will be killed along with the king Eochai McErk.]

I will remember the civil war
When brothers' blood run down the plain
Misshaped specters march the sky
Winged warriors touched the land from high

The use of witchcraft burned the sky
Horror appears in Fir-Bolg's eyes
Sessair calls the great Crom
A creature beyond ancient times

Carnun sawed the dissention seeds
Ever since watched my nation fade

These were the first Dissention seeds
Harvest of the beast
These were the first Dissention seeds
Harvest of the beast

And as the battles have begun the plain seem like a bloody veil
A nameless hero falling dead between so many other brave

Carnun sawed the dissention seeds
Ever since watched my nation fade

These were the first Dissention seeds
Harvest of the beast These were the first Dissention seeds
Harvest of the beast

Graves and Pillars now they rise
Illusions of a haunted land
They died in vain and endless pain
But in our minds they still remain

Grief in the hearts of men sighed
Even for Tuatha De Dannan

Carnun sawed the dissention seeds
Ever since watched my nation fade
