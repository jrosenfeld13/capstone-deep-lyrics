What am i still doing here? I must break out of here
I must break away from all this pain
At this point in time, I don't think it's going to help
Past the point of redemption
Past the point of no return
Past the point of redemption
I feel all this pressure on my body
So much pressure on my mind
At this point, it won't help
I've realized I'm not bitter
I'm just so lost
The dreams get more and more strange with each sleep
I must pack up and get the fuck out of here
At this point, it won't help
I've realized I'm not bitter
I'm just so lost
Losing all hope. Losing my mind
Losing my will to live
Stepping on broken piano keys
Everywhere I go. Hoping it won't get worse
Is this the real world? do I deserve this?
What have I done to deserve this?
Alone in this
Say what you want, say what you must
Shelter yourself from this
Who know if it gets worse?
Much worse and you can only guess where this will go
