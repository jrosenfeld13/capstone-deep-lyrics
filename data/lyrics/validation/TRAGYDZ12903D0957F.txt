D'you ever see yourself in my eyes?
Did you ever think that maybe I'd be lost without you?
D'you ever think that I was alright
You knew it all along

D'ya ever try to sing to my songs?
Did you ever take a walk is wasn't walking with you, yea?
Did you love me just to be loved?
I knew it all along, I didn't try

Sometimes I like to be alone
Sometimes I try to telephone...

Lover, come back to me
Lover, come back to me
In your arms is where I need to be
I am alone
I am alone
A raging sea

I want to taste your bronze skin's delights
Did you ever want to be the sun that browns me?
D'ya ever think that I might decide?
To ask you to stay, baby put up a fight

Sometimes I like to be alone
Sometimes I try to telephone...

Lover, you
Lover, come back to me
Lover, come back to me
'Cause in your arms is where I need to be
I'm alone
I am alone
Raging sea, yea

Lover you
Lover, come back to me
Lover, come back to me, yea
Lover, come back to me , yea
In your arms is where I need to be
I am alone
I am alone
In this raging sea, yea
