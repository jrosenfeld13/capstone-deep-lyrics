[Verse 1]
Used to sit and worry about the future
Worrying about the future don't change the past
Used to think tomorrow would be better
But now I know that I'm doing the best I can
I'm just a man trying to find the reasons why I stand
Took some time to realize that I am...what I am

[Chorus]
And I wanna be rich, I wanna be happy
And live inside a love that shines bright enough to last a lifetime
I wanna be rich more than a fantasy
Ride the winds and climb, cause it's all a state of mind

[Verse 2]
Wake up in the morning and I turn the pages
Don't understand what's going down
Everybody's acting so outrageous
It's gonna take a lot of love to turn things around
I'm just a man trying to find the reasons why I stand
Took some time to realize that I am...what I am

[Chorus]
And I wanna be rich, I wanna be happy
And live inside a love that shines bright enough to last a lifetime
I wanna be rich, more than a fantasy
Ride the winds and climb cause it's all a state of mind

[Bridge]
I hear people talk about going to heaven
Grab a little bit of heaven right here on earth
Troubled times lead to healing times
I was sad now I'm feeling fine
It's the taking and the giving that makes this life worth living
Makes this life worth living

[Chorus w/variations]
I wanna be rich, I wanna be happy
And live inside a love that shines bright enough to last a lifetime
I wanna be rich, more than a fantasy
Ride the winds and fly
Cause it's all a state of mind
Live inside a love that shines bright enough to last a lifetime
I wanna be rich, more than a fantasy
Ride the winds and climb
Ride the winds and fly
Cause it's all a state of mind

[Outro]
Don't you know that it's a fantasy
More than a fantasy
Gonna spread my, Spread my, Spread my
Spread my, Spread my, Spread my, Spread my
Spread my wings and fly
I just had to change my state of mind
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be
I wanna wanna be happy
