Sweetness, please try, summer springs to mind, said I
Most of that night now escapes me, she replied

No, don't let in, For years of curious fear derived
Every night, we'll all set aside

A bomb adhered to memories
Sweetness, don't cry
The hurtful ones were meant to die

No, don't let in, For years of curious fear derived
Every night, we'll all set aside

A Firelight you like to watch

She said what if I say goodbye now
What if I, not knowing why, left you all behind on the ledge
I reply that i knew now
I was glad i did not, push you off, that time on the ledge

And I'm still glad
I did not push you off
That time on the ledge
