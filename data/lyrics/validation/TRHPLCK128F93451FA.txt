C-c-c-come, come inside
Oh I've been expecting you to arrive
Sh-sh-sh-shoes, shake 'em off
While I go and turn the music down soft

[Chorus:]
Oh, but all I've got is a s-s-single bed
There ain't no room for your sweet head
Now ain't it a shame you missed the last train?
'Cause all I've got is a s-s-single bed
S-s-s-single bed, s-single bed
There ain't no room for your sweet head
S-s-s-single bed, s-single bed
I've got a one solitary lonesome single bed

P-p-p-pour out the wine
And we could explore each other's minds
T-t-t-time don't half fly
When the pleasures of night are reaching so high

[Chorus]

Baby don't cry
Bye bye baby
Baby don't cry
Bye bye baby

[Chorus]

S-s-s-single bed, s-single bed
There ain't no room for your sweet head
S-s-s-single bed, s-single bed
I've got a one solitary lonesome single bed
