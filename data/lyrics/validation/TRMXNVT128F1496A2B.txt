I'm going way over the white skyline
And I'll sing and be happy
And you can't keep me here no how

And I'll sing and be happy
And my world is my own
And I'll do what I want to
And you can't keep me here no how

Hey baby, don't cry for me
Hey baby, when the sun comes up I'll be free

And I'm going way over the white skyline
And I'll sing and be happy
And you can't keep me here no how

Ah baby, don't cry for me
Hey baby, when the sun comes up I'll be free

And I'm going way over the white skyline
And I'll sing and be happy
Cause you can't keep me here no how
