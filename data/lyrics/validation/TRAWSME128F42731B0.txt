Mystical lady, you're my skyhiker
Heart of gold, you're my desire
Picture this, scene ever lasting
Over the moon, desire is blasting
It feels great, it feels so good
When what you want is in your blood
It feels great, it feels so good
When what you want is in your blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood,blood, blood, blood, blood, funky munky
