Your beautiful eyes, sparkle like two diamonds on fire
Why am I still surprised at the way they make me feel
I thought I could get no higher
You showed me a whole new deal
It's not the way you look, it's the way you look at me
Most any old time, could be a special occasion
Just call me and I'm already halfway there
You choose the destination, I'll go with you anywhere
It's not the way you look
Even though heaven knows you're a sight to see
It's not the way you look, it's the way you look at me
Like I'm all you ever wanted me to be
It's not the way you look
Even though heaven knows you're a sight to see
It's not the way you look, it's the way you look at me
It's not the way you look, it's the way you look at me
