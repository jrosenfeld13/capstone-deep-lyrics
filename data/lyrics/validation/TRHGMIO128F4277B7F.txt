You're alone
You miss her
But she's far from home
No more blue skies
It's another cloudy day
Take it for granted
I'll never work
But you're thinking
About her again
She lives too far away
You can't forget
How much this one girl means
Your sun is gone
It's another cloudy day
And she's gone
She may not come back
But she's got your heart
And that might be enough
