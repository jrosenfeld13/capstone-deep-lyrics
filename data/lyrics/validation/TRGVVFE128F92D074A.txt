I am caught by this moment
Sunrise is fading in
We are standing together
And I know that's where we begin
I won't let go
Or close my eyes
Won't miss a thing
See first light
I won't let go
Or close my eyes
Won't miss a thing
See first light
Waking up to beauty
Standing sand on holy ground
You and me connected
We are one, we are the crowd
I won't let go
Or close my eyes
Won't miss a thing
See first light
