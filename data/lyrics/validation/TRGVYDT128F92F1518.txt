If you've found another guy
Who satisfies you more than I do
Run to him
I'll step aside
If you think his lips can kiss you
Better than my lips can kiss you
Run to him
Forget my pride
If someone else's arms can hold you
Better than my arms can hold you
Go to him and show to him
All your devo-o-tion
If somebody else can make you
Happier than I can make you
Run to him
My tears will dry
If someone else's arms can hold you
Better than my arms can hold you
Go to him and show to him
All your devo-o-tion
If somebody else can make you
Happier than I can make you
Run to him
My tears will dry
If it's me you want to love you
I'll be more than glad to love you
Hold you 'til your life is done
But, darling
If I'm not the one
Then run to him
