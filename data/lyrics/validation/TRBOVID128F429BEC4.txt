So you say we should just be friends Adam
But I know when I get the bends
That I'll hate you so

So you say we should drift apart Adam
But I know that'll break my heart
And I'll hate you so, 'cause I loved you so

So you say I can be afraid
But I know I would have strayed
I sit and miss you so, a batch of alcohol ceases to control

Don't say you'll think about me
Or say that you can live without me
Didn't we make it nearly
For everything that I hold dearly
How many ways can I say plainly, we can
Before it wore on us thinly
To each and every degree
You've got me in agony

So you say I should call sometime Adam
But I know that'll make you cry
I'll say I hate you so, that you burned me so

So you say we should make it work Adam
But how long does this feeling hurt
I'm sure you'd like to know, 'cause I loved you so

Don't say you'll think about me
Or say that you can live without me
Didn't we make it nearly
For everything that I hold dearly
How many ways can I say plainly, we can
Before it wore on us thinly
To each and every degree
You've got me in agony

Don't say you'll think about me
Or say that you can live without me
Didn't we make it nearly
For everything that I hold dearly
How many ways can I say plainly, we can
Before it wore on us thinly
To each and every degree
You've got me in agony
