Yeah, feel the rush, yeah!
I'm gonna let it happen, let it show
Feel the pressure, it won't let go
It won't let go

I wanna feel the rush, feel the heat
Let it happen, it might release
You don't know, you don't know, know, know, know

It's what I like, need, require
It's where I wanna be
Takes me higher
You know I can't believe

I'm gonna take it all, razorblade
I'm tired of it
It takes me higher
It take me up, it takes me higher

I wanna feel the rush, feel the heat
Let it happen, it might release
You don't know, you don't know, know, know, know

It's what I like, need, require
It's where I wanna be
Takes me higher
You know I can't believe
Feeder me!
You know I don't receive
I was, I was you

Just feel the rush, just feel the rush, just feel the rush
Yeah!
Rush!
Rush!
Ooh yeah, yeah!

It's what I like, need, require
It's where I wanna be
Takes me higher
You know I can't believe
Feeder me!
You know I don't receive
I was, I was you

Rush
Fuck!
