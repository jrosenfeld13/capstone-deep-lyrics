[Intro: instrumental]

[Verse 1: Concept]
Take me back, I don't belong here
Notions preconceived, I gave them something more to ponder
Speaking what I see, and the prophecy is eloquent
Wings up like they necessary, living like I'm legendary
Fly with it
Opened up your mind with it
Double headed monster, hold your head and cry with it
Observe
The voices, the sirens' deadly feature but my voice evokes reality
Controls the lotus eaters
Consume
And they dance but they soul is growing weaker
Drifting from their bodies and without they simply creatures
Spirits on the tip of the tongue, they simply people cause conception got them caught up and it enters something deeper
She cried out
I never want to leave, cause I think I fell in love with a facade they won't believe
And this lotus, that euphoric, killed the monster in my sleep
She was gorgeous pulled me closer, whispered "Death is all I see"
Run

[Hook x2]
And I'm never looking back
No, I said I'm never looking back
See her heart was filled with gold but her eyes were filled with black
The lotus lotus
Lotus lotus

[Verse 2]
I can see them dancing in the wind
The reality is pain the moment I fail to pretend
But within I hope she knows me
Ecstasy consumes us slowly
If I love, it will restore me
But love is not that easy
See
That can bash the evil
Come forth, I'm going deeper
Theres a wolf among the sheep, a nonbeliever in the people
Theres a lotus
So pick your poison, what I feel is deep
See the black was in our eyes
Its seen the truth of nonbelieve look
Life is just a metaphor for floating while you sleep
So emotions that were broken
Spill from her lips
And come to life within my dreams
Can't you see what I've become
A salvation in the darkness
And a hope when there was none
She cried out
I feel it when I breathe
I can see it in my vision
I can hear it when I speak
I can taste it on my tongue and if you see it you will know
See a life was a voided feeling as the lotus took her soul
Run

[Hook x3]
And I'm never looking back
No I'm never looking back
See her heart was filled with gold but her eyes were filled with black
The lotus lotus
Lotus lotus
