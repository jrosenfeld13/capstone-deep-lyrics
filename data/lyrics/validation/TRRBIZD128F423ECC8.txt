Look into my eyes
You see trouble every day
It's on the inside of me
So don't try to understand
I get on the inside fo you
You can blow all away

Such a slightest breath
And I know who I am

Look into my eyes
Hear the words I can't say
Words that defy
And they scream it out loud

I get on the inside of you
You can wave it all away
Such a slightest thing
It's just the rise of your hand

And there's trouble every day
There's trouble every day
There's trouble every day
There's trouble every day

If I want you back
I could get away
Before the sunshine leaves your eye
But I need to know
How to find a place
Before the days become nights
Before the years become lies

And there's trouble every day

You know that I love again
Please make it start again

There's trouble every day

You know that I'll always hear
The words that you never say

There's trouble every day

This time it's startling me
The words I can never say

There's trouble every day

You know that I'll always hear
The words that you never say

[Repeated over:]

Look into my eyes
Hear the words I can't say

You know that I'll always hear
The words that you never say
