She was going down, I was ashin' on her back
Love that girl like she was mine
I hit back once - open-handed, no excuses
Love that girl like she was mine
Now the sunshine won't look me in the eye no more
Love that girl like she was mine
But nighttime says it to my face
Love that girl like she was mine

I was thinkin' to myself
Might as well be you
Got to burn back the weeds
So i burn back the weeds and cry

Need her like a crack-baby, I can see her in the dark
Love that girl like she was mine
Came together so hard we broke both our hearts
And I love that girl like she was mine
Now I'm whistling dixie, spittin' teeth
Love that girl like she was mine
I can't shed this skin she's underneath
Love that girl like she was mine

And I been thinking to myself
It was always you
You got to burn back the weeds
So I burn back the weeds and cry

She says 'why'
Just not a very nice guy
Can't seem to say good-bye
God knows I try

She was goin' down, I was ashin' on her back
