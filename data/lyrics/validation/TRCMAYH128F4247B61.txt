The sun came up . . 
The sun came up . . 
And we left home

You packed your bags
Said your goodbyes
We hit the road

No radio
No radio
Just one good friend

Our eyes collide
You look away
You know that this will end

There are places we've never been before
There are places we'll never know
There are times, when youll need to help someone
There are times you'll need to let go

The sun went down...
The sun went down...
We headed home

You fell asleep
You drifted off
And left me all alone

No radio
No radio
Just dashboard glow

I'll visit you
I say that now
But no one knows

There are places we've never been before
There are places we'll never know
There are times, when youll need to help someone
There are times you'll need to let go

Let go
