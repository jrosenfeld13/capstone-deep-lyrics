(We are...yeah)

Slowly fainting
With a crush on your girlfriend
And I know she is waiting
My arms are so weak now
And it's too late to cheat now, yeah

Getting hot in every corner
Smoking pot when you feel alone
Her eyes are red, and her mouth is open
Where are you?
I can see your open hand
Burn x 10

Where are you?
You're fainting
I can't see all my paintings
Cuz they're blinded by lightning
And did you know we, we won't stop fighting
(no, no, no)

Getting hot in every corner
Smoking pot when you feel alone
Her eyes are red, and her mouth is open
Where are you?
I can see your open hand
Burn x 10

So who is going in?
Who will never win
Stronger than before
Going in once more
Going to take you home
You can't be here alone
Who's coming to take you home?
We are! Yeah

Getting hot in every corner
Smoking pot when you feel alone
Her eyes are red, and her mouth is open
Where are you?
I can see your open hand
Burn x 10
