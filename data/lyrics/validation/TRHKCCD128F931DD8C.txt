There's a warm breeze blowing outside my window, tonight
And the faint sound of music down the hall, sure is nice
As I listen to the words I'm feeling
It puts me in, a lovers mood
You belong with the sweetest thoughts of you, and me together
It makes me wonder
Do I ever cross your mind
Do you long to have me near, to you
Do I ever cross your mind
'Cause I want to have you here right now, with me
Here I am, smiling at the memories, in my head
Thinking of the way you laugh at something
That I've said
When your lovin' arms, embrace me
I feel such a sensitivity
It makes me wonder
Do I ever cross your mind
Do you long to have me near, to you
Do I ever cross your mind
'Cause I want to have you here right now, with me
I just want to be, what you outta be
An oasis in your mind
And fill your thoughts with love
That brings an easeness to your life
In time, in time, in time, in time
It makes me wonder
Do I ever cross your mind
Do you long to have me near, to you
Do I ever cross your mind
'Cause I want to have you here with me
Do I ever cross your mind
Do you long to have me near, to you
Do I ever cross your mind
