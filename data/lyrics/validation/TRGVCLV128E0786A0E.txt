[Verse 1]
I saw your friend first
That's who I danced with
All the time I was watching you
The music rocked us
Our eyes locked-thus
Making us see a trippy picture shoo

[Chorus]
If a man is considered guilty
For what goes on in his mind
Then give me the electric chair
For all my future crimes, oh

[Verse 2]
You whispered something
It took my mind out like a
G flat major with an E in the bass
Your face looked so good
I wanted to touch your mouth
My brain is jacking all over the place

[Chorus]
If a man is considered guilty
For what goes on in his mind
Then give me the electric chair
For all my future crimes, oh

[Verse 3]
Let's take a drive, love
So we can make up our minds, love
To commit the crimes of passion
That sets us free
Me loving you, you loving me
Me loving you, you loving me
The electric chair

[Verse 1 Reprise]
I saw your friend first
That's who I danced with
All the time I was watching you
The music rocked us
Our lives shocked us
Making us see a trippy picture shoot
I've got to have it
Somebody

[Chorus]
If a man is considered guilty
For what goes on in his mind
Then give me the electric chair
For all my future crimes, oh

[Outro]
You know I'm guilty, yeah
For all my future crimes
Guilty
For all my future crimes
And if you don't really love me
Then give me the electric chair, oh!
Electric chair
