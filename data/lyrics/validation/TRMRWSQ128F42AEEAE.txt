The journey's been rough
Lord, knows it's been tough, but you're still here
Friends turn their backs and walk away
Left you without much to say, but you're still here

God's going to do everything He promised
Said, the Lord is going to do everything that He promised you
God is going to do everything He promised
In just a few days you're going to see Him make a way out of no way for you

The battles been long
But through it all you've been made strong and you're still here
You didn't think you'll make it through your night
It's a wonder how you survived, but you're still here

God's gonna do everything He promised
Said, the Lord's going to do what He promised
God's gonna do everything He promised
In just a few days you're going to see Him make a way
You're gonna see Him make a way...

The God we serve is no liar, He is a promise keeper;
So get ready for your breakthrough, 'cause God is gonna bless you
They that sow in tears, they're gonna one day reap in joy
Those that sow with tears, they're gonna one day reap in joy, so rejoice...

(Rejoice, rejoice)
(Rejoice, rejoice)

Get ready, get ready
Get ready it's harvest time

Are you ready, are you ready
To receive what God promised us?

Keep praying, keep praying
Keep praying 'til you see God

Keep hanging on, keep holding on
To your promises, don't let go

He will do it, He will do it
He will do it 'cause He promised it

Don't give up, don't let go
What He promised, He will perform

Don't give up, don't let go
He will do it 'cause He promised it

Don't give up, go all the way
You're almost there
