Impossible, raw women
I know you're all too hard to please
I can help you, if you only ask me kindly
Don't make me get down on my knees

God bless these hungry women
Impossible to ever keep
Your breath has never tasted as sweet

I don't need you to need me, to need my freedom
My freedom is a vision you seek
And the place you disappear to is a place I wish to be

I beg you, instill you
Don't treat it like some kind of joke
This song is, kind lady, my only hope

You can't kill an idea 'cos it's raining
Keep it in the family, keep it in the kids
You know, they're all handing out free tickets
This big, old boat is-a-startin' to sink

The whole world is getting hungry
And it ain't memories you need from me
And if memories are all you need from me
You're a hard act to please

I miss you and it's lonely
I admit, I can hardly sleep
You know he looks like a plastic surgeon
Just look at him, he's a piece

This whole world is like a postcard
Easy lost and easy to reach
And if this is where you're goin' I will surely leave

Ex-impossible grown woman
You know you're oh, so hard to please
Your new friend, he seems to love you
I hope he cries himself to sleep

She will fool you, destroy you
Disappear without so much as smoke
This song is, cool lady, my only hope
