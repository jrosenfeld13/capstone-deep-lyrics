She gave you your name
First words she said to you
It was the last, John

You cried when you first saw her
You wept when you saw her last, John

She's gonna be with Jesus
She knew she couldn't stay
And with Jesus in your heart
She can't be far away

God knows she'd hurt
When she was with us
Now she hurts no more
Her pain has passed, John

She's gonna be with Jesus
She knew she couldn't stay
And with Jesus in your heart
She can't be far away
No, she can't be far away

I'll help you
I know you miss her
Be strong, my friend
Life is fast

She gave you your name
First words she said to you
It was the last, John

In the sweet by and by
On the beautiful shore
In the sweet by and by
Oh, he's gonna see her again

In the sweet by and by
On the beautiful shore
In the sweet by and by
She will be waiting
Waiting for you to come home

In the sweet by and by
On the beautiful shore
In the sweet by and by
