Let me go I'm only letting you down
I've got nothing to say to you now
I lose the feelings that are weighing me down
When I'm safe

It's turning morning all the birds are singing
I'm not complicating anything
I'll have another then I'll go to bed
But I'll dream of you

Cause it's almost over
And it's almost gone

And I can feel the sweet illusion coming
Sweet confusion, honey
Sweet illusion coming down
And I ain't got nothing but love for you now

You and I used to shine like a jewel
But time's been nothing to us but cruel
So play it out and never played the fool
Cause you'll lose every time

We were nothing, we were only the past
Hard times like that don't last
I've been forgiven, I have been surpassed
By my heart, have you?

Cause it's almost over
Yeah it's almost gone

And I can feel the sweet illusion coming
Sweet confusion, oh oh
Sweet illusion coming down
And I ain't got nothing but love for you

Love for you I can't use
Lonely nights multiplied by the blues
That I can't resolve

You never knew me but I did my best
I'm just lonely inside I guess
You gave me everything you really tried, thanks

If we were nothing and we're only the past
Then I'm just living in a dream I guess
A long black dream that takes me down the river to you

Where it's almost over
And we're almost gone

And I can feel the sweet illusion coming
Sweet confusion, honey
Sweet illusion coming down

But I can feel the sweet illusion coming
Sweet confusion, honey
Sweet illusions coming down
And I ain't got nothing but love for you now
