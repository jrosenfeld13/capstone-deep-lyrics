Out on the streets anew
Make the connection
Feel the pulse surgin' through my bones
And it's like an infection

I'm not the man to say that you can
If you look at where it's brought you has it got you real far
Don't got the answers that you're lookin' for
But you can listen to my music in your car
I know it's not the first but it seems to be workin' so far

I know how you are feeling
You feel like a radical
Everyone's pushin' you to fit in
And you know it's impossible
