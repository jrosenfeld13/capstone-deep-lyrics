My name is Foreigner
From a far away land
My feet are covered in earth
They've been here and back again
And I have seen
Great things from a distance
They beckon me
I follow them

And I move forward
I move forward
I move forward to home, to home

My eyes are soft and wise
They tell a story
Of things left behind
Defeat and glory

And I push every hindrance aside
