Into the fire again
I'll light it up
Deadly with venom and sin
Your time is up
I'll poison your mind
You'll poison yourself
With things you can't find
No, you can't find
I can't see frustration
Within me and

You're on your knees again
And so are you
Want to escape my hand
I'll take you down
I rule your every move
No, I rule you
You're tempted by groove
And by sound
I really need this

Pushing the sticks
Right into myself
I've got no way
To control this
I need the pain
More than anything
I need to feel I'm alive

Pushing the sticks
Right into myself
I've got no way
To control this
I need the pain
More than anything
I need to feel I'm alive

You're bleeding 'cause of me
You're bleeding yourself
You'll pay the devil's fee
But the devil is me
The veins in my arm and
The veins in mine
Are on overload
They will explode
I will explode

Pushing the sticks
Right into myself
I've got no way
To control this
I need the pain
More than anything
I need to feel I'm alive

Pushing the sticks
Right into myself
I've got no way
To control this
I need the pain
More than anything
I need to feel I'm alive

So many times
I've taken the wrong road
And still I control you
The essence of revenge
Is not in you
It's in me and
I don't need it

I swear, if I go down
I'll take you with me
There's a blow
Right to your face
What a violent entry
Can you feel me
In your head
I know what you need
You need my pain and
Everything you lose
I seem to gain
I'll take it all

I will explode
I hurt you 'cause
I really need this

Pushing the sticks
Right into myself
I've got no way
To control this
I need the pain
More than anything
I need to feel I'm alive

Pushing the sticks
Right into myself
I've got no way
To control this
I need the pain
More than anything
I need to feel I'm alive
