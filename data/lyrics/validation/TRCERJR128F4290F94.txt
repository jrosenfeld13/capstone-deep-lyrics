Who is it there
Be scared
Another face in the mirror
Is it right, this time
What's the face on the other site
I don't know
What's wrong
I gotta get it our of here
To a place where I belong
Today's my day
I don't care what people say
Today's my turn
I got myself to learn
Chorus
Now it's time for me
To live my own life - own life
To understand who I am
Oh Yeah
Now it's time for me
To live my own life
Just need to find out if I can
Just wanna live my life
I've only got one try
Break down, these walls
That keep me from live alive
I've got, to be strong
And I know I will survive
Today's my day
I don't care what people say
Today's my turn
I got myself to learn
Chorus
Now it's time for me
To live my own life - own life
To understand who I am
Oh Yeah
Now it's time for me
To live my own life
Just need to find out if I can
Just wanna live my life
Just gotta live my own life
No one ever gonna stop me now
Movin' out to my own thing
Never gonna stop break these walls
Just gotta live my own life
No one ever gonna stop me now
Movin' out to my own thing
Never gonna stop break these walls
Chorus
Now it's time for me
To live my own life - own life
To understand who I am
Oh Yeah
Now it's time for me
To live my own life
Just need to find out if I can
Just wanna live my life
Just gotta live my own life
I've only got one try
No one ever gonna stop me now
Just wanna live my life
Movin' out to better things
I've only got one try
