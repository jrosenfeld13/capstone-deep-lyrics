[Verse 1]
She was in the backyard
They say it was a little past 9:00
When her prince pulled up
A white pick-up truck
Her folks shoulda seen it coming
It was only just a matter of time

Plenty old enough
And you can't stop love
She stuck a note on the screen door
"Sorry, but I got to go"
That was all she wrote
Her mama's heart was broke
That was all she wrote
Or so the story goes

[Chorus 1]
Now her daddy's in the kitchen
Staring out the window
Scratching and a-racking his brains
How could 18 years just up and walk away?

Our little pony-tailed girl
Grown up to be a woman
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hanging out on the line

[Verse 2]
Now, don't you wonder
What the preacher's gonna preach about Sunday morning
Nothing quite like this has happened here before
Well, he must have been a looker
A smooth talking son of a gun
For such a grounded girl to just up and run
Course you can't fence time
And you can't stop love

[Chorus 2]
Now all the biddies in the beauty shop gossip
Going non-stop
Sipping on pink lemonade
How could 18 years just up and walk away?

Our little pony-tailed girl
Grown up to be a woman
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hangin' out on the line
Yee-hoo!

[Chorus 3]
She's got her pretty little bare feet
Hanging out the window
And they're heading up to Vegas tonight
How could 18 years just up and walk away?

Our little pony-tailed girl
Grown up to be a woman
Now she's gone in the blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hanging out on the line
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hanging out on the line

[Outro]
She was in the backyard
They say it was a little past 9:00
When her prince pulled up
A white pickup truck

Plenty old enough
And you can't stop love
No, you can't fence time
And you can't stop love
