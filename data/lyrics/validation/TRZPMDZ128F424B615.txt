All my sex takes place without a face
And alternates between lower and upper case
Mis-spelled between asterisks and dashes
Emoting sweats to scenario clashes
All the keys make less than three

I love my sex, it takes place without a face
The little skills that quicken the pace
Emoting sweats, emoting sweats
All the keys make less than three

We sit ageless with stumps we tap, tap, tap
Bodyless 21st century mishap
In spaceless rooms we pander sexless
In thinking less the self's repossessed
All the keys make less than three

We sit ageless with stumps we tap, tap, tap
Bodyless 21st century mishap
Emoting sweats, emoting sweats
All the keys make less than three

All the keys make less than three
