I hear you prayin'
Your dreams would be takin' you far from here
(far away)
So tired of waiting
Your heart must be breaking in two
While you do
With all the things in the world that you're trying to do
Does what I'm trying to say
Get thru
To you
Chorus
Wish that I could read your mind
Understand what you hide in your heart
Then maybe, baby, I could help you see how loved you are
Wish that I could find the words
That would echo inside of your soul
'Cause then, my friend, you'd know
He loves you so
God loves you so
I have a confession
For all your hard questions
The answers may not seem clear
There's no use pretending
'Cause we're all out here spinning our wheels so it feels
Only one knows your heart
What you hope to become
Do you know who you're running from or to
Chorus
My love is strong but not strong enough
I'll give you all that I have
It wouldn't matter that much
So instead of promises
I'll just be honest
'Cause I won't always be around
And I know my love will let you down

Chorus
