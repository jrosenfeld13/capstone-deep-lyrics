We are nothing but Eurotrash
We take Plastic and we take Cash

We are selling an image
Everything must go
I want you to know
You don't want the side effects
Need simulated sex
We're selling you heaven
Prices down to a low
I thought you should know
It's all in your head
You're living a lie
There is nothing
Money can't buy

We are nothing but Eurotrash
We take Plastic and we take Cash
We sell our hearts second class
We slit our throats on tinted glass

We're silicon stitches
Reality bites hard
I want you to know
It's all in your head
You're living a lie
There is nothing Money can't buy

We are nothing but Eurotrash
We take Plastic and we take Cash
We sell our hearts second class
We slit our throats on tinted glass

We are,We are,We are,We are,...

It's all in your head
You're living a lie
There is nothing Money can't buy
The future is here
Dreams have no end
Everything must go

We are nothing but Eurotrash
We take Plastic and we take Cash
We sell our hearts second class
We slit our throats on tinted glass
