Turn away from grimness
Turn away from your desires
Get him locked up
They ate him, ate him up
No one at the scene transposes
Reversed transpossession
Kill the newborn child of Christ
Put and end to all the lies

Demonic possession
Transfer the spirits
The obscure rituals continue

Look for someone weak
Got the keys to unlock hell
Your secret dies with me
Shoot me, stuff me, nail me to the wall

Demonic possession
Transfer the spirits
The obscure rituals continue

Evil prevails
I'm taking over
Put the evil in the sacred circle
And the power will be mine

You're just resting
Go knock 'em down
Saving lives
It's getting worse
Doing what you're told
Totally vicious predatory act

Look for someone weak
Got the keys to unlock hell
Your secret dies with me
Shoot me, stuff me, nail me to the wall

Demonic possession
Transfer the spirits
The obscure rituals continue

Evil prevails
I'm taking over
Put the evil in the sacred circle
And the power will be mine

No one at the scene transposes
Reversed transpossession
Kill the newborn child of Christ
Put and end to all the lies

Demonic possession, transfer the spirits
The obscure rituals continues

Demonic possession
Transfer the spirits
The obscure rituals continue

Evil prevails
I'm taking over
Put the evil in the sacred circle
And the power will be mine
