[Verse 1]
If tomorrow all the things were gone
I'd worked for all my life
And I had to start again
With just my children and my wife
I'd thank my lucky stars
To be living here today
Cause the flag still stands for freedom
And they can't take that away

[Chorus]
And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I'd gladly stand up
Next to you and defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA

[Verse 2]
From the lakes of Minnesota
To the hills of Tennessee
Across the plains of Texas
From sea to shining sea
From Detroit down to Houston,
And New York to L.A
Well there's pride in every American heart
And its time we stand and say

[Chorus]
That I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I'd gladly stand up
Next to you and defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA

[Chorus - Outro]
And I'm proud to be and American
Where at least I know I'm free.
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I'd gladly stand up
Next to you and defend her still today
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land
God bless the USA
