Cowards gather round a well faces glaring

Back from hell I recognize the face I see

Staring up at me I would kill to survive

Forever has one among us got a line muck

Faced men in brack and brine we lower

Down but none take hold contempt

From spirits we all sold I would kill

To survive forever
