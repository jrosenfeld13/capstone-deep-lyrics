Mother Goose
Never should have ever let that Jack get loose
But that little boy blue
Keeps messing all the things he gets his hands into
Now look what you've done
Stuck in your thumb
Pulled out a plum
Mama says, "Boys will be boys"
That's Li'l Jack Horny
Mama says "Boys will be boys"
That's Li'l Jack Horny
Jack and Jill
Went up and down and up
And fooled around the hill
Now only time will tell
How late the rabbit will arrive in Wonderland
Now look what you've done
Stuck in your thumb
Pulled out a plum
Mama says, "Boys will be boys"
That's Li'l Jack Horny
Daddy says "Don't need no birth control"
That's Li'l Jack Horny
Mama says, "Boys will be boys"
That's Li'l Jack Horny
Mama says, "Boys will be boys"
That's Li'l Jack Horny
Mama says, mama says
Li'l Jack Horny
Mama says, mama says
Li'l Jack Horny
