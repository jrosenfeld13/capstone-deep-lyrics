Cynical, affordable
Lashed down like heaven sent intangible
Lucrative initiative
Unbreathing forces stoked on sedatives
Fraternize, romanticize
Bring what is spoken for, familiarize
Overkill, dependable
More human contact will just make you ill
Make you ill

That old disciples go a hold of me
I'm sick of walking on the past you see
Take your skeletons and run - bye bye baby
Purge your thoughts into the sun
Goodbye baby, bye bye

Leave the ground before us
See how they run (x4)

See how they run (x5)

Leave the ground before us
See how they run
See how they run (x4)
