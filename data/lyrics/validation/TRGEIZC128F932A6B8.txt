You never change
You stay the same
You are my hope of glory
I will never have to be afraid
Through the course of time and all my life
You've been my place of shelter
Here beneath Your love I will remain
I will sing that
You are my refuge
In You alone I place my trust
Here in the shadow of Your wing
You are my refuge
The maker of the stars above
Still You make Your home inside of me
You shelter me
You are Lord of all
My mind recalls the times that You've been faithful
Now I know Your love is here to stay
Through the course of time and all my life
You've been my place of shelter
Here beneath Your love I will remain
I will sing that
