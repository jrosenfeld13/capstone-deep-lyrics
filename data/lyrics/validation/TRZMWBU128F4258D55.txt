So many choices for a man to make
So many ways that he can go
But all the kingdoms in a thousand worlds
Could not replace the pease I know

The things of earth can never satisfy
The hunger deep in me

Behold the Lamb of God
Reaching out His nail-scarred hand
He wants to lift you up
Give you strength so you can stand

It's only natural for a man to dream
To reach for stars above himself
My life was cluttered with shattered dreams
Before I learned to seek your will

You are the rain that falls on thirsty ground
