[Verse]
She haunts the roads
She waits for a new face
Her arms red and injured
She wants to rest
She can't 'til we have faced
I've cut your armies down and torn your heart

[Chorus]
You wait, I wait
Outside awake
I cut your armies down and torn your heart
You wait, I wait
Outside awake

[Outro]
She haunts the roads
She waits for a new face
