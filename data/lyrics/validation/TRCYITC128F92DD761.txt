Steady my shaky hands
Shut off the world's demands
Just get the facts down
Do you understand?


This is a foreign land
So try to understand that
Do you understand?
Do you understand?

If this is what it feels to love
Then l can feel that
If this is what it feels to love
Then l can feel that
If this is what it feels to love
Then l can feel that
If this is what it feels to love
Then l can feel that

Even when you're all alone
Even when it's not your home

Take a little look around
Melting as it hits the ground
Touch my hand
Up to the air

Dying in a foreign land
So do you understand that
Do you understand?
Do you understand?

If this is what it feels to love
Then l can feel that
If this is what it feels to love
Then l can feel that
If this is what it feels to love
Then l can feel that
If this is what it feels to love
Then l can feel that

Even when you're all alone
Even when it's not your home
I smell the blood of an Australian
Try to understand this if you can
If you can
If you can

If this is what it feels to love
Then l can feel that
If this is what it feels to love
Then l can feel that
If this is what it feels to love
Then I can feel that
If this is what it feels to love
Then I can feel that

Even when you're all alone
Even when it's not your home
I smell the blood of an Australian
