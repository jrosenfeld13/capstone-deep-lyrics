Kiss, kiss me say you miss, miss me kiss me love with heavenly affection
Hold, hold me close to you, hold me see me through
With all your heart's protection

And make my life perfection
Kiss, kiss me darling then. kiss me once again

And make my life perfection
Kiss, kiss me darling then. kiss me once again
Make my dreams come true
