[Verse 1]
There's no reason, there's no compromise
Change in seasons, living the high life
I don't know you, so don't freak on me
I can't control you, you're not my destiny

[Chorus]
Straight out of line, I can't find a reason
Why I should justify my ways
Straight out of line, I don't need a reason
You don't need to lie to me

[Verse 2]
I'll confess this: you're my tragedy
I laid you to rest just as fast as you turned on me
Gone forever, banished the memories
This place of pleasure are masked by your misery

[Chorus]
Straight out of line, I can't find a reason
Why I should justify my ways
Straight out of line, I don't need a reason
You don't need to lie to me
Lie to me

[Instrumental Break]

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro Chorus]
Straight out of line, I can't find a reason
Why I should justify my ways
Straight out of line, I don't need a reason
You don't need to, don't need to lie to me
Lie to me
Lie to me
Lie to me
