Oh, then tell me Sean O'Farrell
Tell me why you hurry so
Hush me Buchall hush and listen
And his cheeks were all a-glow
I bear orders from the captain
Get you ready quick and soon
For the pikes must be together
By the Rising of the Moon

Chorus:
By the Rising of the Moon
By the Rising of the Moon
For the pikes must be together
By the Rising of the Moon
Oh, then tell me Sean O'Farrell
Where the gathering is to be
In the old spot by the river
Right well known to you and me
One more word for signal token
Whistle up the marching tune
With your pike upon your shoulder
By the Rising of the Moon

Chorus:
By the Rising of the Moon
By the Rising of the Moon
With your pike upon your shoulder
By the Rising of the Moon
Out of many a mud wall cabin
Eyes were watching thru' the night
Many a manly heart was throbbing
For the coming morning light
Murmers ran along the valley
Like the banshee's lonely croon
And a thousand pikes were flashing
By the Rising of the Moon

Chorus:
By the Rising of the Moon
By the Rising of the Moon
And a thousand pikes were flashing
By the Rising of the Moon
There beside the singing river
That dark mass of men were seen
Far above their shining weapons hung
Their own beloved green
Death to every foe and traitor
Forward strike the marching tune
And hurrah me boys for freedom
Tis the Rising of the Moon

Chorus:
Tis the Rising of the Moon
Tis the Rising of the Moon
And hurrah me boys for freedom
Tis the Rising of the Moon
