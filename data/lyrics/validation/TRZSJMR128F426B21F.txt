If the river was whiskey
I would be a diving duck
If the river was whiskey
I would be a diving duck
I would swim to the bottom, but I would drink my way up

You know the sun gonna shine in my back door some day
And the wind gonna rise up blow my blues away
Lil firl i been lovin got hair share like klondike gold
She got a mortgage on my soul

You know I ?
Just to see my pony run
If I win some money sure enough I'd give you some

If the river was whiskey
I would be a diving duck
If the river was whiskey
I would be a diving duck
I would swim to the bottom, but I would drink my way up
