We both lie silently still
In the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together
We feel miles apart inside

Was it somethin' I said or somethin' I did?
Did my words not come out right?
Though I tried not to hurt you
Though I tried but I guess that's why, they say

Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its, yeah, it does

I listen to my favorite song
Playin' on the radio
Hear the D.J. say
"Love's a game of easy come and easy go"

But I wonder, does he know
Has he ever felt like this?
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I could've let you know somehow

I guess, every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorns

Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like the knife that cuts you, the wound heals
But the scar, that scar remains

I know I could have saved our love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love we both
Made our separate ways

But now, I hear you've found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife

I guess, every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its
