Head hurts, stomach is turning
And I don't wanna face the day
Why the hell won't I ever learn?
I guess it's just the price to pay

Everything felt so good last night
How could something so wrong
Feel so right?

No more easy money and
Talking ain't allowed
The Devil walks beside me
And he walks proud

I can't remember names
Faces or the places that I have been
The girl in my bed is far from
The prettiest that I've ever seen

I swear to my self this was the last time
But it doesn't seem quite to reach my mind

No more easy money and
Talking ain't allowed
The Devil walks beside me
And he walks proud

Get up
Now it's time to face it all
Stop Crying
No one hears your call
Look straight ahead, you fool
Get up, it's time to act real cool
Take a look, a good look in the mirror now
What do you really see?
Is that what you wanna do?
Is this who you wanna be?

No more easy money and
Talking ain't allowed
The Devil walks beside me
And he walks proud (x2)
