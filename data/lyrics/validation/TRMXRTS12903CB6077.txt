I'm not sure what worries and more
The fact that I'm talking to a wall
Or that the wall keeps answering me
Saying that I've heard it all before
Never underestimate how complicated
A simple life can be

You gotta keep it together
You gotta keep it together
You gotta keep it together
So I can fall apart

I know you've grown tired of trying to feed me
And I know by now my reputation precedes me
I know you've grown tired of trying to fix me
And I know by now my best years
They are no longer, no longer with me

You gotta keep it together
You gotta keep it together
You gotta keep it together
So I can fall apart

You gotta keep it together
You gotta keep it together
Please keep it together
So I can fall apart

You gotta keep it together
Please keep it together
You gotta keep it
So I can fall apart

You gotta keep it together
You gotta keep it together
Keep it together
You gotta keep it
Oh, you gotta keep it together
Please keep it together
I need you to keep it together
So I can fall apart
I need to fall together

You gotta keep it together
Please keep it together
I need you to keep it together
So that I can fall apart
So I can fall apart
