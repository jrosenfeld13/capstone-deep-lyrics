When it all blows over
Can we start again?
When we've both grown older
Will you love me then?
Say you'll love me then

You never had to tell me
I already knew
The last time you held me
There was only you
It was only ever you

Though every change
As I turned the tide
Through all my games
You were there by my side

When it all blows over
Can we start again
When we've both grown older
Will you love me then?
Say you'll love me then

Will you love me then?
Say you'll love me then
Did you love me then...?
