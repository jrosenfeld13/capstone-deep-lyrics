The marshland that is down and deep
Holds me tight it's clutching me
Like black cold chains forever
Dragging me towards hell's misery

The things that I've seen with Your eyes
The things that You choose not to see
Have scorched me like ten thousand burning years
In a purgatory

Is this Damnation?

Is it in my mind or is it something I don't know
Something that I should control
I've got to find
Find the machine
That makes me want to be me

Cannot face another mirror
Cannot face another truth
I've got to find
Find some new eyes
I've got to find a substitute

My omnipresence this is me
My weapon against your dynasty

I have to stop existing mentally
In places that I do not want to be
I have to move away
From thoughts terrible and gray
It will not let me go
Is this Damnation?

My Omnipresence this is me
My friend, turns into an enemy

Must control, I must control the evil daemon
Antimental!
