I thought I saw you on the train
I hid behind some men
I had never seen you look so good
I'm glad you're doing well

I went out for a walk today
To think of things unsaid
Of course I found I'd said too much
So I laid all that to rest

And when the day falls
I guess it was love
And when the day falls
At least it was

You thought of a name to call me
I guess that's how it goes
I know a few with the same name
Yes, I'm sad I'm one of those

Ungraceful as I am in loving
In leaving I'm the same
It's way too late to say I'm sorry
But I'll say it anyway

And when the day falls
I guess it was love
And when the day falls
At least it was

Dum dum dum dum
