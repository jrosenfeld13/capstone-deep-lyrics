[Verse 1]
You can catch him sitting knowing that he's sinning
But knowing sinning gon' give him what he's always missing
He starts to bill a spliff and slowing taking out the seeds
Slowing calculating how to peculate them p's
He's made a couple g's selling weed and selling e's
And to get it selling these he certainly moves neat
He rides his moped round the whole ends from dusk till dawn
He's got the weed head a pills heads lighting up his phone
He's got a ratchet that he loves to flick open and close
Hoping one day that it's gonna buss somebody's clothes
Nobody really understands him nobody knows what's in his heart cause it never shows yo
He's got a dead beat dad, that beats his mum real bad
His mum sits home all day drinking and smoking fags
His mum said he ain't shit probably do jail time and that's if he makes it to 25

[Hook]
Bad boy, he's a bad boy
Bad boy, he's a bad boy
Bad boy, he's a bad boy
Bad boy, he's a bad boy

[Verse 2]
Yeah!
Catch him laying on his back getting head from cat listening to new rap like 50 and that
Word for word reciting like he's the real writer
Or shadow boxing in the mirror like a real fighter
The reason he's hurt is now lost like a lighter
The pain in his heart gets him drunk as mother yo
He gets another call then puts it in his balls
He passes the poster of 2Pac on his bedroom wall
He don't really stop and cotch with the man dem
He said them man are waste man them man are loose cannons cause
They got the rebors he's got the real ting
He got the 38 with the grip and the case to put it in
He'd kill for his kicks or his whips or his friends
He'd kill for his dad even though he hates him
He'd kill for the reason of killing cause killings in
And he'd kill if opportunity rings

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
See his priorities are messed up, if he doesn't realize that then his luck'll be up
Cause he wants to be remembered like Tony Montana
But he's forgetting that he'll end up dead like Tony Montana
Life is a game and he's playing to lose he ain't knowing the rules thinking they don't apply to him
But its love yea and it's the love that will keep him
Keep him filled to the brim although he's living in sin
His mind believes he's a product of the things he's sees
Nobody told him he's a free as the air he breathes
As simply as it sounds this is history he ain't the first and he won't be the last
Cause I've seen a few going nowhere fast yeah
I've seen a few going nowhere fast
A life upraised is a life unsure always looking for help but expecting closed doors that why he's

[Hook]
