Got up today
What a day
Thanks a million
I spent too much time
Wondering why
I got an opinion, yeah

I know you wanna try and get away
But it's the hardest thing you'll ever know

Waiting in line
Terrible time
Over familiar
Well take them away
They've nothing to say
They're over the hill, yeah

I know you wanna try and get away
But it's the hardest thing you'll ever know

Trying to get at you
Trying to get at you

Trying to get at you
Trying to get at you
Trying to get at you
Trying to get at you

I know you wanna try and get away
But it's the hardest thing you'll ever know

I know you wanna try and get away
But it's the hardest thing you'll ever know
