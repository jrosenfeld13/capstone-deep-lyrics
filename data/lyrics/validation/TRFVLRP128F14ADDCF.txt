This is redemption
That you would die for me
And this is salvation
That you would live in me
That you would live in me
This is redemption, this salvation
This is our mission, and this is our passion

What love is this
That you would die for me?
(Let's start this over)
What love is this?

This is redemption
That you would die for me
And this is salvation
That you would live in me
That you would live in me
This is rejection
That they would all hate me
And this is submission
That I would live holy
That I would live holy

What love is this
That you would die for me?
(Let's start this over)
Let's start this over and we'll see
Just where this love will take us
Your presence shows us grace
Right here in our own meditation
What love is this?

Creation finds your mercy
Redemption, passion, glory
Creation finds submission
Redemption, passion, glory
