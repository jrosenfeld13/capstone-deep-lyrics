Generals gathered in their masses
Just like witches at black masses
Evil minds that plot destruction
Sorcerers of death's construction
In the fields are bodies burning
As the war machine keeps turning
Death and hatred to mankind
Poisoning their brainwashed minds, oh lord yeah
Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight
They leave that all to the poor
Time will tell on their power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess
Wait til the judgement day comes
Now in darkness world stops turning
Ashes where the bodies burning
No more warpigs have the power
Hand of God has struck the hour
Day of judgement, God is calling
On their knees the warpigs crawling
Begging mercy for their sins
Satan laughing spreads his wings, oh lord yeah
