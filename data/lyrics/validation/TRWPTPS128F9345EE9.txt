You're the one who plays with fire in the night
You're the one who scares people with the scythe
You're the one to tell him to ever live by
You're the lord to shaking all alone

You're alone!

Now you left me out to drop his sight
I wasn't ready for the sunlight to come to my heart

Take me with you, take me far, take me away from the painless soul
Drop the haze, save the skies, Reaper never lies

Now I'am lying on the floor alone
Sweating and shivering, cold right to the bone
Pain is come, control to fall become
For the mad to escape with a bottle from this world

You're far too alive, try back to the sky
I wasn't ready for the scythe, get me down to the trough

Like lightning from the sky
The moon is up with pride
Go listen, take away

Your place for my lying out, being high, come heaven above
Go to hell, we're born to die, take me to the sky
