To live asleep in memory
I have forgotten the reason why

Mold of hands begins to dissolve
Tell me who is to blame
To live asleep in memory
I have forgotten the reason why

The air rolls through me
Only to cultivate fog
We're smothered with blackened lungs
An internal smog
Have you ever know fear?
Have you ever felt fault?
Have you ever felt something?
Did you ever seem lost?

There is no one here and I am hidden
There is someone here and I am not
There is no one here and I am hidden

We still wait for someone and the mold is cracked
It's a long line to ponder and there's no turning back
Have you ever known fear?
Have you ever felt fault?
Have you ever felt something?
Did you ever seem lost?
