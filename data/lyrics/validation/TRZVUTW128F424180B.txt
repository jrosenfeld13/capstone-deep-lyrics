Like a postcard picture fading out to desert winter
Once an ocean now it leaves me dry
Clouds are separating. Tear apart this life I'm living
I'm gravitated to this brand new light

Is it in me? Am I still in control?
Did it leave me? I look around for a soul
What's come over me? Always waiting for the next wave to wash over
And Fill Me Again

Will it carry me far enough from all I've suffered?
Will it bridge the gap from there to here?
I wonder if I had it all would I feel there's something missing?
In tomorrow's light it seems so clear

(Chorus)
The wind is keeping me from falling forward
Just another crutch to get me through
The wave is coming and it's rising upward
It's going to lift me to meet the blue

(Chorus)
