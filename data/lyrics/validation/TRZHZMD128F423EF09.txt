You think you know me
Know what i do
But all you think about is what it all means to you

I got so much, so much to give
All you gotta do is be ready, ready to live

You think you know a lot about my kinda woman
But you don't know nothing bout me

Chorus:
You don't know me
You don't know me
You don't know anything about me
You don't know me
You don't know me
You don't know anything about me

Saw two women
Both the same size
Think you're living a nice little life
Don't think i'm ready
To do what i can
Because you're the one that ain't the real man

You think you know alot about my kinda woman
But you don't know nothing bout me

(Chorus)
You don't know
You don't know
You don't know
You don't know
You don't know
You don't know

You don't get it
You don't even understand

Your nothing i know
Your my gigolo
You look nice in your clothes
But your nothing

(Chorus)
You think you know a lot about my kinda woman
But you don't know nothing bout me
