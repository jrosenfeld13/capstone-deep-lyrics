I'm biting the blade of your scissors
As the champagne fizzes
Keep it on ice
There's plenty more biting to do yet
Plenty more biting to do yet

Words dribble from my mouth
But don't even reach your lungs
So have little hope in penetrating
Your fucking noodley tangle
Your fucking noodley tangle

I'm biting the blade of your scissors
As the champagne fizzes
Keep it on ice
There's plenty more biting to do yet

Words dribble from my mouth
But don't even reach your lungs
So have little hope in penetrating
Your fucking noodley tangle
