Burn the message
Break the prophet on the wheel
Time's a currency
Make a choice and trade or steal
Eleven-digit
Conjure up a major flood
Love is liquid
What has been can leave me not

Chorus:
I'm not asking you to give
I want you to take
A moment of truth
Fountain of youth
Princess of elegance
I'm not asking you to give
I want you to take
Your grace and your voice
Weapons of choice
Mistress of innocence

Like to touch fluffy things?

Distort the message
Tie a poet to the wheel
If you lose your asset
Make a choice and trick or steal
Seven-digit
Conjure up a major fire
Love to lava
Raze the virtues and the lies

Chorus

On the floor - from behind
On the balcony - full frontal
In the grass - into your face
Like summer rain
On my floor - from behind
On the balcony - full frontal
On the street - back on our feet
Drunk with passion
