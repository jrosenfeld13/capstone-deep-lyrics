Say your prayers little one
Don't forget my son to include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within, keep you free from sin
Till the sandman he comes

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never, never land

Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight and they aren't of snow white
Dreams of war, dreams of liars, dreams of dragon's fire
And the things that will bite

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Grain of sand
We're off to never, never land

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
Guard me Angels through the night
Wake me in the morning light

Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never, never land

Exit light
Enter night
Grain of sand
We're off to never never land, let's go
