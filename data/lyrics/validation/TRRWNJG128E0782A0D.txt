I see it deep in your eyes
Someone hurt you and you don't want to cry
I'll hold you all through the night

I never want to let you go
I'm not afarid to let it show
I will give my love to you for always

I will be there, to show I care
(Deep in the night) when your heart's feeling lonely
Just trust in me, I'll make you see
(There's someone in this world)
Who will always be there

You need me, like I nedd you
Together we'll see it through
For ever, in all that we do

I never want to let you go
I'm not afraid to let it show
I will give my love to you for always

I will be there, to show I care
(Deep in the night) when your heart's feeling lonely
Just trust in me, I'll make you see
(There's someone in this world)
Who will always be there

Never want to see you feeling down
You can count on me to be around
I'll do anything you ask me to
Say the magic words
Yes I do
