[Verse 1]
You seem a little on the high side, disconnected from me
Been a little too anxious and a little too sweet
Have you been chopping down treetops tree after tree
Have you been digging for diamonds at the bottom of the sea

He said I'm taking the farm out from under your knees
Said I'm taking the air and the rag that you're bleeding upon
Come on meet me where the highways and the one way streets
Come together like the motion comes together with my feet

[Chorus]
Well top and bottom it's all the same to me
Until all my breathing air is gone

[Verse 2]
Well you feel it in the ozone, zone
You can feel it in the knees, knees, knees
You can feel it in the dirt that's going under your feet
You can feel it in the highways and in the one way streets
When you're digging for diamonds at the bottom of the sea

You seem a little on the high side, disconnected from me
Been a little too anxious and a little too sweet
I'll be chopping down treetops tree after tree
When I'm confusing my highways for a one way street
