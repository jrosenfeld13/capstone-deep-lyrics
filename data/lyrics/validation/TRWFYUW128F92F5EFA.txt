With one voice the angels sing
Songs that make creation ring
Prophets hear and call us to
Live in the spirit and in truth

Father, Yahweh, Elohim
Voice of thunder, spirit, wind
Breathe on me your very life
Grace will make the darkness bright

Word of God enthroned dwell in us forevermore
Love has come to show the way
Hallelujah, God is with us
Love has come to show the way

God of covenant divine
Lead us to the end of time
Beyond sorrow, beyond fear
Beyond pride and earthly tears

Word of God enthroned dwell in us forevermore
Love has come to show the way
Hallelujah, God is with us
Love has come to show the way

Hallelujah
(God is with us)
Hallelujah
(God is with us)

Hallelujah
(God is with us)
Hallelujah
(God is with us)

Now, salvation has come
In the New Jerusalem
Dancers dance and singers roar
Proclaiming Jesus Christ is Lord

Word of God enthroned dwell in us forevermore
Love has come to show the way
Hallelujah, God is with us
Love has come to show the way

Word of God enthroned dwell in us forevermore
Love has come to show the way
Hallelujah, God is with us
Love has come to show the way, the way
