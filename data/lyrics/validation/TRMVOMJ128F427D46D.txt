Something quite extraordinary
Takes my tongue from me
Saying things I dont mean
Describing things Ive not seen

Close to me
But not inside
I know
Closet
Parasite

Sold myself a mortuary
Now loss is gain and I am here and
Im so very
Tired of being used
But what else can I do

Never wanted just to sell you
Just to tell you why
Never wanted just to heal you
Just to hear you cry
