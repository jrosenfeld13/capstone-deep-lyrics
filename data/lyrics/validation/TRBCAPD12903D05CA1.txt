Trick of the light, turn of the tide
A rift in a valley, full moon in July
Red summer sun mourning, a cold April sky
That lonely October, so cruel to deny
A wish for a fountain lost in the winds
A kick from a new life about to begin
A south facing island that floods in the spring
Will call to October new life, it will bring
It will bring, it will bring, it will bring
A drop in the ocean, short of the line
Cursing a feeling caught up by the night
Repairing the ruin, reducing the sting
That falling October will bring
Hope that is dreaming, love that is torn
Dancing like dust in the eye of the storm
Truth will be lost when the mocking bird dies
October returns with its cold winter skies
Awe can't be touched, faith can be blind
Fooled by a past that the world left behind
Hidden in rocks that are lost to the shore
Of silent October you choose to ignore
