Hey you got to step outside to see whats going on

Hey you cant run and hide when the psybin trip is on

Not like this have you seen such green

A spot like this becomes serene

Im glad your here i have no fear



We trip the shrooms fantastic

And shit gets drastic elbow pull and kick

We trip the shrooms fantastic

N shit gets drastic, check it out



Right now my brain is fragile

But you seem so agile well make it in tea

And well see what there is to see



CHORUS



Make an instrumental add a little vocal

Take to the stage and make the people go loco

Make an instrumental add a little vocal

Take to the stage and make the people go loco

Boom boom you got the spinning of the room

Quite right you got the breaking of the light

Boom boom you got the spinning of the room

Quite right you got the breaking of the light

Ad the sun and the moon and the spinning of the room

It does to my sight what the prism does to light

Youre quicker than me ridiculous see

You come follow me get lobotomy

Youre quicker than me ridiculous see

You come follow me get lobotomy



CHORUS



Make an instrumental add a little vocal

Take to the stage and make the people go loco

Make an instrumental add a little vocal

Take to the stage and make the people go loco

Make an instrumental add a little vocal

Take to the stage and make the people go loco

Make an instrumental add a little vocal

Take to the stage and make the people go loco
