All eyes ceased
And have begun
To see that no one
Survives the life
Whole line

Shines to fire
Beyond our eyes
It shines for no one
And we cannot see
The light's light

All hail man
Who froze his heart
And gave it over
Traded a life
To the lives

All eyes to hsi face
On his face
The face of no one
We cannot see
What he sees

All hail morning
She comes to see
His eyes don't open
All hail darkness
It is ours

And so when I'm walking, trying to see what he was talking about
That's about when I broke through
And I know it's all been broken and the lord's already spoken
He wasn't talking to me, wasn't talking to you
And I can see the future on the sadness of his plans
Oh future, stop crying
Today there's life on earth may be dancing around all of us
Well tomorrow's only dying

And our love
It can't find you there
At the dawning

Well I've been first and last living slow and living fast
Always trying to get best of it all
But there's more to life than getting, there's more to the beginning
Than only trying to get your way
So I call out to the night cause I can see there's nothing at all
I've tried to say it was not true
And I tried to take you with me to see to all its mystery
Well the mystery was you

And our love
It can't find you there
At the dawning

And now into the woods, and hounds who cannot see
They been howling after you
And now you're keeping pace but the longer they must chase
The more they starve for you
And don't look back towards me I'm as empty as the sea
Back before there was life on earth
And I won't look back towards you
Or this crazy world
Or this crazy world
