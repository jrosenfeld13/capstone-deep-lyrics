Sugar, come on, it's time we go to bed
Darlin' rest your weary aching head
Lay those burdens down
They'll be here when morning rolls around
Baby, it's not always an easy fix
Some seasons you'll just have to deal with
But it's not the end of the world
I am here; I'm still your girl
So if the sky should fall
If it decides to break
Know that we've got it
We've got what it takes
Know that we've got it
Sugar don't fret go only what you can
I promise it won't make you less a man
Can't save the world
But you are superman to this girl
Baby it won't be like this for always
Let's weather the storm and head for brighter days
The best is yet to come
It's only just begun
So if the sky should fall
If it decides to break
Know that we've got it
We've got what it takes
Know that we've got it
No matter what
My place is here with you
We can conquer the world
Hand in hand us two
Some days are rough
But in me you have a friend
We can make it together
See it too the end
So if the sky should fall
If it decides to break
Know that we've got it
We've got what it takes
Know that we've got it
Baby we stand tall
At times we just might fall
But we've got it
