[Intro]
Oh no

[Verse 1]
Take what you need because I can't hold my breath
Say what you feel cause I got nothing left, oh
I made a promise to myself last night
I'm going to keep it if it's wrong or right

[Chorus]
And if I lose it all
There'll be nothing left to lose and I would take the fall
Because knowing you are out there breathing
It's so wonderful, it's a chance I take even if I break it
I lose it all, if I lose it all
Wouldn't matter anyway

[Verse 2]
Don't change a thing, perfect as you are
Time has a way, time is all I've got
If my heart should shatter watching you
That'd be one less thing I'd have to prove

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Heaven will be waiting when I fall into your open arms
I believe you'll find me there
You'll find me there

[Chorus]
And if I lose it all
There'll be nothing left to lose and I would take the fall
Because knowing you are out there breathing
It's so wonderful, it's a chance I take even if I break it
I lose it all, if I lose it all

[Chorus]
