Baby don't you cry no more, no more
Baby don't you cry no more
I been a lot of trouble
But I won't no more
Baby don't you cry, no baby don't you cry no more
I'm listening to that midnight whistle blow
Just listening to that whistle blow
And come tomorrow morning
I'll be leaving on a train
Listening to that whistle blow
I confess to being a fool
Bled your heart
And did you cruel
So I'll leave you with your eyes closed
And your head turned from the door
And you won't have to cry no more
Walk away, sad to say, it's grown thin
Love is cold when it's old
You can hold on too long
So wipe away the sate tear
From your eye so red and sore
Baby don't you cry no more
Baby don't you cry, no baby don't you cry no more
