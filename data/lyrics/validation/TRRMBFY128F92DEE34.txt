It's only over when I say so
You should be careful with the things you always wish for
Down beneath I treat you like a coma lover
And it ain't over yet
Before you die at least I'm gonna give you a sec
I gotta know if you're good enough to get again sober
When it's over, yeah

Ah, you will love her
I can't stop her
Something's coming over
Hey, someone wants to see you cry

(Sugar..)

I gotta see what you want me to do tonight
Look all the people you see won't even be on your side
I'll cut you deep to the bone
Let me take you over, over yeah
We gotta stay in the middle of the street grip off the night
And if I punish you again you gotta lick it tight
I have to seek
Whatever you come is over yeah

Ah, you will love her
I can't stop her
Somethings going over
Hey, someone wants to see you cry

So you leave me tonight

You gotta leave because the queen wouldn't leave you alive
You feed the people, I only want to feed up my kind
I'm on your lips
Love will soon be over, over yeah
You gotta leave me if you will not become of my kind
And if you leave me once again you have to lick it tight
Why don't you scream
Maybe I'll take you over, over yeah

(Sugar..)

So you leave me tonight

Ah, you will love her
I can't stop her
Somethings going over
Hey, someone wants to see you cry
