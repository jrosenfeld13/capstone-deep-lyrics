Now June's tune is a powerful heartbreak lovemake
Like cherrytime twists of summer and vanilla mists
Your long, cold legs miss december senseless
And at least our little blanket romances

Like they said in my school
We're only giving the devil a ride
When we swing from the knees, when we roll to our sides
We burn and dive into whatever sea we see

Oh, this girl has got quite a hold on me
Yeah, you know what I mean
Now Angeline told me to watch and to pray
For the conversion of the sinners along my precious way

But to converse with the few confused had me wasting away days
When all I saw was confusion and lack of grace

The neat coffee cream, the sweet sugary steam
The cold snow on your window; the world's a white-washed screen
And I'm keeping warm from the winter storm, the howling, hovering screams
Right here next to you and you inside of me

Oh, this girl has got quite a hold on me
Man, you know where I stand
So we laugh flawlessly and we talk like licks of the wind
With humor and opinion and serious grins

We know we just can't help but love each other
We know we just can't have it any other way
With our cinematic guise and our narrative eyes
And our last wishes
