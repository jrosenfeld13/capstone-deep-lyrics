Here I am, I feel so cold
In this dawn of sorrow
Siberian winter occupies my soul

I've made up my mind, everything's said
I'm heading off tomorrow
The spell is broken, yeah
He's got to go

You crushed my heart
So don't bother trying to hurt me anymore

I'm out of tears
I just can't cry no more
I'm out of tears
With this desolated heart
I'd rather be alone
I'm out of tears

No turning back, gotta hold on
I'm on with a bow and arrow
The memory of you can make me weak

You crushed my heart
So don't bother trying to hurt me anymore

I'm out of tears
I just can't cry no more
I'm out of tears
With this desolated heart
I'd rather be alone
I'm out of tears

So you linger in defeat
You can't hold me down, no, no

I'm out of tears
I just can't cry no more
I'm out of tears
With this desolated heart
I'd rather be alone
I'm out of tears
I just can't cry no more
I'm out of tears
With this desolated heart
I'd rather be alone
I'm out of tears
