[bonus track]

I live on the street, it is my home
All my life I've been alone
I see people passing by
And they lower their eyes

It's been like this for so many years
I had my share on lonely tears
My parents left me long ago
They did not want to know

Tell me how can I stand the pain?
Is there any hope for me at all?
Hear me cry in the cold rain
I never wanted to become
A Neon Light Child

There'll come a day when I'll be free
I will make people look at me
I'll leave everything behind
There are good things for me to find

[Chorus]
I'll be the rain
I'll be alone
Alone in the rain
You left me here
