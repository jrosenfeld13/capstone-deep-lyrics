When I was young
I never knew
What this thing called love
Could do to you
But since you been gone
And I've been on my own
I've been feeling quite peculiar
But I'll get by without your smile
And I'll get through without you

But I wish it was me you chose
I wish it was me you chose
I wish it was me you chose
I wish it was me you chose
Elvis ain't dead (I wish it was me)
And you're coming back (I wish it was me)
And Elvis ain't dead (I wish it was me)
And you're coming back (I wish it was me)
Oh

Since you been gone
I can do what I like
But it doesn't mean a lot to me
I'm all shook up
And I'm lonesome tonight
I think I need a love lobotomy
But I'll get by without your smile
I'll get through without you

But I wish it was me you chose
I wish it was me you chose
I wish it was me you chose
I wish it was me you chose
Elvis ain't dead (I wish it was me)
And you're coming back (I wish it was me)
And Elvis ain't dead (I wish it was me)
And you're coming back (I wish it was me)

Ohhhh, no no no no
Come home, come home

You
Me
Maybe we were never meant to be
You
Me
Maybe we were never meant to be

Elvis isn't dead
Elvis isn't dead
Elvis isn't dead
Cause I heard him on the radio

Elvis isn't dead
Elvis isn't dead
Elvis isn't dead
And you're coming back to me I know

Elvis isn't dead
Elvis isn't dead
Elvis isn't dead
Yes I heard him on the radio

Elvis isn't dead
Elvis isn't dead
Elvis isn't dead

Me you chose
I wish it was me you chose
I wish it was me you chose
I wish it was me you chose
Elvis ain't dead (I wish it was me)
And you're coming back (I wish it was me)
And Elvis ain't dead (I wish it was me)
And you're coming back (I wish it was me)

Cause Elvis ain't dead
And Elvis ain't dead
And Elvis ain't dead
And Elvis ain't dead

Elvis has left the building
Thank you and good night
