Albert, he goes west
He crossed the vast indifferent deserts of Arizona
He had a psychotic episode on a dude ranch
That involved a bottle of ammonia

Henry, he went south and lost his way
Deep in the weeping forests of Le Vulva
He grew so wan, he grew so sick
He ended up in a bungalow sucking a revolver

The light upon your rainy streets
Offers many reflections
I won't be held responsible
For my actions

Bobby, he goes north, then he goes east
Then over to New Hampshire
Bobby is a cautious man
He walked into a Concord dive to drink a beer

Do you wanna dance?
Do you wanna move?
Do you wanna dance?
Do you wanna groove?

I said the world is full
Of endless abstractions
And I won't be held responsible
For my actions

Me, I ain't going anywhere
Just sit and watch the sun come up, I like it here
Oh yeah, I watch the people go ticking past
Go hey hey hey, you know I gotta say I like it here

Sha la-la-la, sha la-la-la, sha la-la-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la, sha la-la-la, sha la-la-la-la-la-la
