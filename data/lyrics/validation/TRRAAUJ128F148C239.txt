[Verse 1]
Slow, and I can't wait
As the day turns inside out
And night falls on you darling, darling
It falls on me too
And I'm tired, and I can't sleep
But I try, so I can dream, you know
Forever's a while and tomorrow's still a night away
And it's late, and I just wanna go home

[Verse 2]
I fly over the sea
And the planes, I see you
Hanging on the wing darling, darling
Holding onto me
Passed out in my room
Your breath is sunny and warm, you know
Forever's a while and tomorrow's still cold and gray
And it's late and I just wanna go home

[Verse 3]
Don't say you'll miss me 'cause I know that you miss me
You keep blowing me kisses over the phone
And don't say you'll leave me, 'cause I know you won't leave me
You know it took years for you to stay
I don't love you to death, but I'd die if you left
From state to state, you know I'd race
But nobody knows which exit is yours

[Solo]

[Verse 4]
There is a place in the red light district
Of your heart that I used to visit
It's been boring, I can't afford it anymore
