Into my life on waves of electrical sound
And flashing light she came
Into my life with the twist of a dial
The wave of her hand
The warmth of her smile
And even though I know that
You and I
Could never find
The kind of love we wanted together
Alone
I find myself missing
You and I
You and I

It's not very often that something
Special happens and you
(You and I)
Happen to be that something special for me
And walking on grass
Where we were and laughed in the moonlight
I find
Myself
Thinking of
You and I

Into my eye come visions of patterns
Designs the image of her
I see
Into my mind
The smell of her hair
The sound of her voice
We once were there
And even though I know that
You and I
Could never find
The kind of love we wanted together
Alone
I find myself missing
You and I
You and I
