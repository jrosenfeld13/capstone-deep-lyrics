From the other side of the wall
You don't have to get out of bed this morning
That's what it said on the radio

Stop complaining boy, your life's too easy
Stop complaining boy, your life's too easy

Something will happen without warning
Now you don't have nowhere else to go

Stop complaining boy, your life's too easy
Stop complaining boy, your life's too easy

Here it comes
Here it comes
Here it comes, back to me

From the other side of the wall
I dozed off and thought I was probably dreaming
Then something must have thrown me on the floor

Stop complaining boy, your life's too easy
Stop complaining boy, your life's too easy

Suddenly my girlfriend started screaming
I knew this had never happened before

Stop complaining boy, your life's too easy
Stop complaining boy, your life's too easy

Here it comes
Here it comes
Here it comes, back to me

Surprise surprise
Surprise surprise
Surprise surprise

From the other side of the wall
From the other side of the wall

Stop complaining boy, your life's too easy
Stop complaining boy, your life's too easy
Stop complaining boy, your life's too easy
Stop complaining boy, your life's too easy
