Backstroke lover, always hide beneath the covers 'til I talked to my daddy, he say
He said "You ain't seen nothin' till you're down on a muffin, then you're sure to be changin' your ways."
The cheerleader was a real young bleeder, oh the times I could reminisce
But the best things of lovin' with her sister and her cousin only started with big ol' kiss, like this

Seesaw swing with the boys in the school and your feet flyin' up in the air
Say "hey diddle diddle" with your kitty in the middle, and you swing like you didn't care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance with a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin', I could tell what she was doin', and I knew love was here to stay when she told me to

Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way
Just gimme a kiss... one little kiss on the smacker

Highschool sweetie with a classy kinda sassy and a skirt climbin' way up the knee
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker when I noticed they was lookin' at me
I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady, so the boys told me somethin' I missed
Until the next door neighbor had a daughter with a favor and it started with a little bitty kiss, like this

Seesaw swing with the boys in the school and your feet flyin' up in the air
Say, "hey diddle diddle" with your kitty in the middle, and you swing like you didn't care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance with a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin', I could tell what she was doin', and I knew love was here to stay when she told me to

Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way
Just gimme a kiss... I don't have cooties!
