I'll call you
On the phone tonight
We can rendezvous
At our hideaway all right

Don't you know
You're my everything
And I know
You mean the world to me
Don't you know
That we are in paradise

Gave me your heart
I won't break it
I believe that we can make it
Gave me your heart
I'll always be true

I'm feelin' stronger
'Bout our love
A faithful strength
That keeps us closer because

Faster-n-faster
My heart's beating faster
I'm so glad you're here with me
Faster-n-faster
I know this can last girl
Since you gave your heart to me

You're my everything
And you mean the world to me
And we are in paradise
