Tell me where the hell you get the nerve coming back asking for a second chance
After you left me alone for the next man (oh no)
Ain't it funny now I'm making money now you showing up after I'm blowing up
Baby I used to love you
But now the party is over

Shoulda thought about it before you said goodbye (shoulda thought about it oh yeah)
And the same thing that make you laugh, can make you cry (make you cry, make you cry, make you cry)
But the grass was much greener on the other side (but the grass was much greener on the other side baby oh no)
But the same thing that make you laugh, can make you cry (oh yeah)

You thought it was all good when you, left me in the hood
Told you he'd buy you things that I never could
You said he had more cheddar than me
Wasn't ghetto like me
But now you realize your mistakes
But you realized too late

Shoulda thought about it before you said goodbye (shoulda thought about it)
And the same thing that makes you laugh, can make you cry (make you cry, make you cry, make you cry)
But the grass was much greener on the other side (no it wasn't baby)
But the same thing that makes you laugh, can make you cry (yeah yeah)

Baby you thought you played me for a fool (baby you thought, you was gonna play me)
Now I'm the one that's laughing at you (now I'm the one, laughing at you)
Thought you would never see my face again (thought you wouldn't see my face, no no no-no)
Now I'm the one that's laughing in the end (now I'm the one that's laughing in the end)
Shoulda thought about it

Shoulda thought about it before you said goodbye (before you said goodbye yeah)
And the same thing that make you laugh, can make you cry (the same thing, can make you cry)
But the grass was much greener on the other side (oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
But the same thing that make you laugh, can make you cry (oh oh oh)

Shoulda thought about it before you said goodbye (shoulda thought about it before you said goodbye, before you said goodbye)
And the same thing that make you laugh, can make you cry (yeah)
But the grass was much greener on the other side (the grass was much greener)
But the same thing that make you laugh, can make you cry (oh yeah, make you cry, shoulda thought about it)
