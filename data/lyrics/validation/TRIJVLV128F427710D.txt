[Verse 1]
Leaves are falling all around
Time I was on my way
Thanks to you, I'm much obliged
For such a pleasant stay
But now it's time for me to go
The autumn moon light my way
For now I smell the rain, and with it pain
And it's headed my way
Oh, sometimes I grow so tired
But I know I got one thing I got to do

[Chorus]
Ramble on
And now's the time, the time is now
Sing my song
I'm [?] 'round the world, and gonna find my girl
On my way
I've been this way ten years to the day
Ramble on
I'm gonna find the queen of all my dreams

[Verse 2]
Got no time to for spreading roots
Time's come to be gone
And though our health we drank a thousand times
It's time to ramble on

[Chorus]
Ramble on
And now's the time, the time is now
Sing my song
I'm [?] 'round the world, I gotta find my girl
On my way
I've been this way ten years to the day
I gotta ramble on
I'm gonna find the queen of all my dreams

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Mine's a tale that can't be told
My freedom I hold dear
Years ago in days of old
When magic filled the air
In the darkest depths of Mordor
I met a girl so fair
But Gollum, and the evil one
Crept up and slipped away with her
And there's nothing I can do
I guess I keep on


[Chorus]
Ramblin'
And now's the time, the time is now
Sing my song
I'm [?] 'round the world, I gotta find my girl
I'm on my way
I've been this way ten years to the day
I'm gonna ramble on

[Ad-Libs]
[?]
[?] 'round the world, see my girl
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, I went
Searching for my baby
[?]
[?]
Ooh, I keep on rambling baby
[?]
I keep on rambling baby
