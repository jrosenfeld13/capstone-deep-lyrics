Take me to your river, baby, take me to your sea
Purify my soul and pour your ocean over me
Lead me to your chamber, where you sleep at night
Scratch your name across my back, make me feel alright

You're the best time I have ever had
You look so good, oh babe, you must be bad, ha

Diamonds on your ankles, sapphires on your shoes
Your little gems of wisdom chase away my blues
Mama's little princess, daddy's pride and joy
I'm like a kid at Christmas, playing with your toys, ooh

You shake me in the morning, I wake up black and blue
Ooh child, you act so wild, I'll name a hurricane after you
Scarlet fever kisses, little Miss Dynamite
Youngblood, you look so good, I'm gonna leave on all the lights

So I can see where I'm goin', baby
Play that thing
Mmm

So take me to your river, baby, take me to your sea
Purify my soul and pour your ocean over me
Lead me to your chamber, where you sleep at night
Scratch my name across my back, make me feel alright

I have never felt this good before
If you want I'll sleep outside your door
You're the best time I have ever had
You look so good, oh babe, you must be bad

You must be bad
