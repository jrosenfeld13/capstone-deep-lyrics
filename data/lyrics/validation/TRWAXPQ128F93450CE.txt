[Verse 1]
You gotta a lot, a lot of nerve
Comin' here when I'm still with him
And I can't have you
It isn't fair
Born March of '86
My birthday's comin', and if I had one wish
Yeah, you'd be it

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're 'round, I lose myself inside your mouth
You've got brown eyes like no one else
Baby, make it to me...

[Chorus]
Again and again
Again, again, again, again
Never stop
Again and again
Again, again, a-a-again, again
Never stop, oh

[Verse 2]
He never really saw me or waited
When we were hookin' up, yeah, he'd a never... last
Last week when I was sad
You said that you knew my eyes changed from kinda green to kinda blue, hey!

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're 'round, I lose myself inside your mouth
You've got brown eyes like no one else
Baby, make it to me...

[Chorus]
Again and again
Again, again, again, again
Never stop
Again and again
Again, again, a-a-again, again
Never stop, oh

[Outro]
They tell me
If I leave him, baby, would you be there?
'Cause maybe, you could be m-m-mine all the t-t-time
