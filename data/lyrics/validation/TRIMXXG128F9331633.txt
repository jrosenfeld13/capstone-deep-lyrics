Write a letter to yourself about yourself:
Boring us with every detail
Someday I'd like to land, as bitter as I am
Nothing affects me anymore
There's something wrong when all the efforts you have made
Are hiding in your room
While everyone else continues to stand
Exactly where I most belong

Innuendo and out the other
We cast our lines in to an ocean
Of future cluttering its waters
Calling in more than we can swallow

There's something wrong when all the efforts you have made
Are hiding in your room
While everyone else continues to stand
Exactly where I most belong

Innuendo and out the other
Calling in more than we can swallow
