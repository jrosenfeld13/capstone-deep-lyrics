Here we go fools
And it's on once again for young and old
Because you stole the farmboy's time
'cause if you find me on the trippy hip hop
Like I said before you whore
So don't try and copy
The style of those you chose to propose because you're sloppy
We got the drop on you you're through
There's a noise at the front door
And just last week you sounded just like Faith No More

Suckers come and go

You've bought a new record kid
You won't fight it you won't know
There's some things you'll never know
Let me tell you right now
'cause you wanna rape the kids but they won't' pay you shit
You're like a senile pedophile
Because you cut your hair when it was time to leave
Now you've got a new style
Make me wanna be sick and you're sliding up and down
OH fingertip main trip, think you're so down and I just can't take it
HIP HOP'S TIP!
Suckers like you who fake it through, you're through

CHORUS

Listen to the styles that I bring and you know that kid
Come and rock the party full swing
You can't rock the party, FOOL
If it's for the radio

Just how many times I pulled the grand theft audio?
When there were dreams to kill, if I had a pound
Got to people, feel they tried to sound like you
Everytime I saw a sucker, I'd be a rich man mother fucker

Repeat and fadeCHORUS
