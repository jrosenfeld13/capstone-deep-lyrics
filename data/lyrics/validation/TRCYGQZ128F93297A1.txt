We give, we steal
We live to feel
That perfect body

We watch and learn
We dream and yearn
For that perfect body

To work, to endure
To touch, to explore
That perfect body

In frantic speed the bass line runs
Our hearts beat fast to the drums
Over and over the cycle repeats
To make that perfect beat

Perfect beat, body beat

We're sharp, we're skilled
We aim to build
That perfect body

Live, on tape
We're here to shape
That perfect body

In frantic speed the bass line runs
Our hearts beat fast to the drums
Tight in tune we oscillate
To the music we create

I take your hand to lead me in
We're dancing close, skin on skin
Over and over the cycle repeats
To make that perfect beat

Perfect beat, body beat

We're wanted, we're hot
We're everything you're not
