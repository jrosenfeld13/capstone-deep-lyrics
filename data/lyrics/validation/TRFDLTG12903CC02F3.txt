He's coming to take you
He's coming to kill
Molded in clay
Out of rabbie's will

He looks like a man
But he's got a heart of stone
He frighten the crowd
But he feels alone

He's a silent servant
Wise and insane
Was built to save the people
From misery and pain

He carries within
The real name of God
The Cabala's power
Of might, rage and blood

Bullets can't kill him
'Cause he's made out of sand
Fire can't burn his spirit

He can't drown in water
'Cause he doesn't breath
He is the revenge
And you can't stop the golem

Golem

Rised up from the ground
From an ancient spell

With his hunting limp
He appears from the dark
To kill all the foes
And to leave his mark
