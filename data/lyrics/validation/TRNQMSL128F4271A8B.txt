Life's short, don't make a mess of it
To the ends of the earth, you'll look for a sense in it
No chances, no plans
I'll smash the windows of my box
I'll be a madman
It's no time to be 21
To be anyone

Hold back, see what you miss of it
Out of the shadows, into the thick of it
No maybes, no guessing
I'm getting wound up
The plot sickens
It's no time to be 21
To be anyone

Strip down to the bare facts of it
Into the cold heart, no hope and all that shit
No chances, no plans
I think I'll be somebody else
Or else a madman
It's no time to be 21
To be anyone

We'll be your untouchables
We'll be your outcasts
We don't care what you projects on us
It's no time to be 21
