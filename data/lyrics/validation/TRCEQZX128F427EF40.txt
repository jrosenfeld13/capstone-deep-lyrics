[Intro]
Uno, dos, tres, quatro

[Verse 1]
Tie up your boots
Jump off the ladder
Pack up your clothes
Nothing's the matter
Mistletoe hangs
Up in the bedroom
Your sister's bangs
She cut them herself
Santa is here
Sleighbells are ringing
Twenty-one elves
They are all singing
K-Mart is closed
So is the bakery
Everyone's at home
Watching TV

[Chorus] x2
Santa Claus is coming
Hear the banjo strumming

[Verse 2]
Chestnuts and fire
Holly and hay
Jesus and Mary
What a great day
Evergreen tree
Covered in snow
Tower of Babel
Tower of glow
There's Aunt Marie
Hand on the fire
They give us good gifts
Like mittens and socks
Hijack a snow plow
Clear out the streets
Tell all of the neighbors
There's cookies to eat

[Verse 3]
Off the floor and give a shout
There's a lot to shout about
Santa Claus is coming to town
He's got the greatest gifts around
Away in a manger
No crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus
Laid down his sweet head
The stars in the bright sky
Looked down where he lay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay
The cattle are lowing
The baby awakes
But little Lord Jesus
No crying he makes
I love you, Lord Jesus
Look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle
Until morning is nigh
Be near me, Lord Jesus
I ask you to stay
Close by me forever
And love me, I pray
Bless all the dear children
In your tender care
And fit us for heaven
To live with you there

[Chorus] x4

[Outro]
Off the floor and give a shout
There's a lot to shout about
Santa Claus is coming to town
He's got the greatest gifts around
