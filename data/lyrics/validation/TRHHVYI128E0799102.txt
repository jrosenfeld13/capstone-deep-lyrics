Same Song Lyrics
Susheela Raman
How many roads have I wondered?
None, and each my own
Behind me the bridges have crumbled
No question of return
Autumn leaves like discarded dreams
Trampled underneath a tide of careless feet
Its the same song playing
Everywhere I go
Its like an army marching right through me
Nowhere to go but the horizon
Where, then, will I call my home?
Summer spent, in the high grass
Or just fragments, ransacked memories
Dark river snakes, across this murky hall
Boatman sings his downstream melodies
How many roads have I wondered?
None, and each my own
Behind me the bridges have crumbled
Where, then, will I call my home
