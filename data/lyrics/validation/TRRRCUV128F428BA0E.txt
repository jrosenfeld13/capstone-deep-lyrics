No, don't stop
Just feel me all the way to the top
With your love there's no empty
Just give me everything that you've got
All alone, I don't want to be
Without you, just within me
Making love to you so have it
I've just got to have it
Don't even think about leaving me

Oh, oh, because
I can't get enough
I can't get enough
No, no, no, no
I can't get enough
I can't get enough
Don't was it not enough

No, you won't hurt me, just please me
Don't deserve me
And I, I dream of you
All the time that we share and the things we do
All alone, I don't want to be
Without you, just within me
Making love to you so have it
I've just got to have it
Don't even think about leaving me

No, because
I can't get enough
I can't get enough
No, no, no, no
I can't get enough
I can't get enough
Don't was it not enough

Not enough (repeat)
All alone, I don't want to be
Without you, just within me
Making love to you so have it
I've just got to have it
Don't even think about leaving me

No, because
I can't get enough
I can't get enough
No, no, no, no
I can't get enough
I can't get enough
Don't was it not enough
