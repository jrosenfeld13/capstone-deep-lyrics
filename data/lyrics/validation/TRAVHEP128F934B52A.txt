A realization. I look to the sky and ponder my fixation on a world of plastic clouds. It is a film that is holding me together. A synthetic rise that is holding us and our time. Collodion stripped across my belly. Holding back the insides. The Synthetic rise is holding us and our time . I am waiting for that moment. It is a film that holds me together. We and our existence are becoming one with a new synthetic lifeform. It is a wonder we remember how to breathe without a computer telling us to do so. We have baited a trap, but the prey is ourselves. What will we do when it all comes crashing down? A synthetic rise of creations that sure can kill. And you start to think that Matrix shit is going down. Isn't it ironic our creations will outlast us? Synthetic Rise, fake salvation a time will come. It is no longer an opinion, a time will come. Remind yourself how to live again

Hey! A realization of my fixation!
