All I have to ask
Everybody has gone to drink
And nobody is dancing
And I'm not even dancing
And I love to dance
It's a beautiful room
A nice red curtain seems to move 'em
Reminded of the food we ate
And the time it was
And all I have to ask
Is why you left
And how you have forgotten
And all I have to ask
Is why you left
And how you have forgotten
Everybody's looking away
And nobody's talking
I'm the only one talking
And now I hate all that I've said
Oh my God I want to live again
I died when it was over
Sickened to death
'Til I finally remembered
To breathe, to breathe
And to forget
Everybody has gone to dance
And nobody is drinking
And I'm not even drinking
