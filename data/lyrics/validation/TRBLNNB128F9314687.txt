Did I slip did I trip?
Did I somehow fall and lose my grip?
Can it truly be our song is lost at sea?
Marooned?
Weren't we?
There were guitars and stars and you and me
Was our melody misplaced?
Or was our memory erased? (I recall)

In the glowing rumor of a moon
Our melodies made mermaids swoon
And we, by chance, glanced Neptune sway
Till he stole it all away
To the bottom of the bay

There was you, there was me
Happily cast away by some mutiny
We rum'd and strummed and drummed up our own treasure
And every note he hearddid Poseidon pilfer every word?!
We have lost the key; can find no rest, no rhythm, rhyme nor measure(I recall)

Did I slipdid I trip?
Did I somehow fall and lose my grip?
"To bring back the song to light of day
To strum to sing, to hum, to play
To hear the call," the Sirens scream
"Plunge back into the briny dream!"

Where in the glowing rumor of the moon
Our melodies made mermaids swoon
And we by chance glanced Neptune sway

In the glowing rumor of the moon
Our melodies made mermaids swoon
And we by chance glanced Neptune sway
Till they stole it all away to the bottom of the bay
