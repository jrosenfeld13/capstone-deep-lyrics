[Verse 1]
I lease twenty acres and one Jenny mule
From the Alabama trust
Half of the cotton, a third of the corn
Ya get a handful of dust

[Chorus]
And we can not have all things to please us
No matter how we try
Until we've all gone to Jesus
We can only wonder why

[Verse 2]
I had a daughter, called her Annabelle
She's the apple of my eye
Tried to give her something like I never had
I didn't want to ever hear her cry

[Chorus]
And we can not have all things to please us
No matter how we try
Until we've all gone to Jesus
We can only wonder why

[Verse 3]
When I'm dead and buried I'll take a hard life of tears
For every day I've ever known
Anna's in the churchyard, she's got no life at all
She's only got these words on a stone

[Chorus]
And we can not have all things to please us
No matter how we try
Until we've all gone to Jesus
We can only wonder why

[Outro]
Until we've all gone to Jesus
We only wonder why
