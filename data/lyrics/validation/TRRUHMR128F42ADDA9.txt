You know, All of you know
To grow, what to feel
And so, follow me low
You are what you lean on
Come out of the cold
And drift, into water

Ooooooohh
And the light shines on
While we all ride on
When the days come and gone
You know we all ride on

Lines thicker than ground
You surf and its real
To soar over and down
To bend and to breathe on

Ooooooohh
And the light shines on
While we all ride on
When the days come and gone
You know we all ride on

Through water when
We are falling
The sounds of bells are ringing out
We'll ride on

Slipped over
The blue lighting
Springs alive to circle down

Ooooooohh
And the light shines on
While we all ride on
When the days come and gone
You know we all ride on

Now the light shines on
While we all ride on
When the days come and gone
You know we all shine on
