This next song is 108 years old
But the message is as clear today as it was way back then
You see it was about that time that a terrible mining disaster occurred
Then people dealt with their tragedy through the eloquent poetic lyrics of their folk music
So clearly articulated the depth of their feelings

The miners died in eighty-nine
The miners died in eighty-nine
The miners died in eighty-nine
The miners died in eighty-nine

T'was eighty-nine when the miners died
T'was eighty-nine when the miners died
T'was eighty-nine when the miners died
T'was eighty-nine when the miners passed away

"So, what was the profession of these men who died?"
"They were miners."
"And how old were they when they died?"
"They were minors."
"And what key were they singing in at the time of their dieths?"
"They were singing in the key of: A Flat Minor. Oh no, I don't mean that to sound like, you know, there was a flat miner or something. There were hundreds of them - squished flat down the mine."
"There's probably relatives here, you can' say that!"
"Oops, I've dug myself into a huge hole! Oops sorry again!"

(*A song is played on a whistle entirely on one note except for the last note, which is a lower note, which goes flat at the end*)

"You were a bit flat at the end, there"
"That was in tribute to the miners"

T'was eighty-nine when the miners died
T'was eighty-nine when the miners died
T'was not ninety-one
No, nor seventy-three
Nor a-hundred-and-forty-two
T'was eighty-nine
