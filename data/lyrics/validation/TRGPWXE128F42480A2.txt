Ever since I was a little girl
You couldn't dare tell me a thing
I was as subborn as they come
I was such a drama queen
Thought I was right and I could do no wrong

Some couldn've beens a few dead ends
Some bumps along the way
Some never should've been boyfriends
That ended in heartache
But I still try to see the brighter side

What goes up, don't always come back down
What goes around, don't always come around

CHORUS:
I've been down on my knees just a' beggin the Lord
The Devils been knocking at my door
I've been in the dark but I've always found the light
Oh, I've been up and down this road before
I keep on coming back for more
And I still haven't figured a dang thing out about life
Ooh, about life

I've lived and learned and I've been burned
But it's all apart of me
I've got bars around my heart
But I still believe
There's someone out there with the key

But I still dream and I won't gve up the fight
And who knows if I'll ever get it right

REPEAT CHORUS

What goes up, don't always come back down
What goes around, don't always come around

I'm gonna keep on, keepin' on
I've been in the dark but I've always found the light
Oh, I've been up and down this raod before
I keep on coming back for more
And I still haven't figured a dang thing out about life
And I still haven't figured a dang thing out about life
Oooh, about life
