The road is long, with many a winding turn
That leads us to who knows where, who knows where
But I'm strong
Strong enough to carry him
He ain't heavy, he's my brother

So on we go, his welfare is my concern
No better is he to bare, we'll get there
For I know he would not encumber me
He ain't heavy, he's my brother

If I'm leaning at all, I'm leaning with sadness
That everyone's heart isn't filled
With the gladness and love for one another

It's a long, long road, from which there is no return
While we're on the way to there, why not share
And the load doesn't weigh me down at all
He ain't heavy, he's my brother

He's my brother, he ain't heavy
He's my brother, he ain't heavy
He's my brother
