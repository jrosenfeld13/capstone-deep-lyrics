Anybody can control a woman's body
See, the key is to control her mind

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine

These are the ten love commandments
Thou shall not ever break them
These are the ten love commandments
Thou shall not ever break them

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine

Number ten, it's only common sense
Never try to sex her friend
'Cause you be hit with the evidence

Number nine, true love is hard to find
Try to leave the past behind
Or the silly rules blow your mind, blow your mind

These are the ten love commandments
Thou shall not ever break them
These are the ten love commandments
Thou shall not ever break them

Number eight, gotta learn from your mistakes
True playa' knows how to take the weight
Sent from heaven, lucky seven
Stay together if you love her

Number six, keep your family out your cheese
Sometimes you gotta tell your mom's to mind her place
Flip to five, do or die, play by the rules
And you'll survive, yeah, yeah

These are the ten love commandments
Thou shall not ever break them
These are the ten love commandments
Thou shall not ever break them

Number four, no matter how mad she gets
Never let her walk out that door
'Cause sooner or later you're bound to regret

Number three, remember what you told that priest
Through sickness and in health
Said you'll always be with me

All the ladies sing

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine

These are the ten love commandments
Thou shall not ever break them
These are the ten love commandments
Thou shall not ever break them

If I go back in time
I'm never being true
Number two says love you and you only

Number one, to me is the greatest of them all
Love brought us here together
So love will conquer all

These are the ten love commandments
Thou shall not ever break them
These are the ten love commandments
Thou shall not ever break them

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine

These are the ten love commandments
Thou shall not ever break them
These are the ten love commandments
Thou shall not ever break them

All the ladies sing
