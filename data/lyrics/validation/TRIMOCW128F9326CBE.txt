Foreign tongues in familiar places
Surrender the thrills to the very core
Forever young and blessed with nameless graces
A love that kills and promises more
Ash on the carpet and dust on the mirror
Chasing shadows and the dreaming comes clearer
Gasping for colour, this perfect heart

Screaming howl and the children play
A serpent's kiss for the words you pray
Whiskey and the devil and the witching hour
A serpent's kiss on that untouched flower

Searching for a haven, it's no favour
The fingers that shine
Heart beats quicker as the veils start to fall
I'll be craving, the pleasure's all mine
Candles flicker as the devils dance on the wall
Stroking the naked and the silence gets colder
Stuck on the ceiling and the kissing gets bolder
Biting my nails for fear of revenge

A serpent's kiss and the children play
A serpent's kiss for the words you pray
A serpent's kiss and the witching hour
A serpent's kiss on that untouched flower

Ash on the carpet and dust on the mirror
Chasing shadows and the dreaming comes clearer
Some kind of visitor and the neon street

A serpent's kiss and the children play
A serpent's kiss for the words you pray
A serpent's kiss and the witching hour
A serpent's kiss on that untouched flower
