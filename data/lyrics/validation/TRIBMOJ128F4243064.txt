Bet you never had a million years
Of time here on your hands
Bet you never known just what to do
And made the final plans
It says right here you've never won
And nowhere that you've tried
Then goes on to say you've never stuck
To anything you like
From falling down
Hey falling on your hands
Take yourself up and away from where you land
Bet you wish you lost the list of names
Of all your high school friends
The scene you want to disappear
Goes on and never ends
Bet you want to close your eyes and go
When they make those demands
The job you wish you never had
Right now is on your hands
