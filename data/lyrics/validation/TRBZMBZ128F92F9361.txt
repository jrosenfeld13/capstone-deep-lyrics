One is a gun with a dart for my sweetheart
Two only you can remove such an ache so
Three let me see what you've got
What youre made of, what youve got
Four is sore, just a ripped and bloodied claw
Five is a bunching fist that's within me
Six little stitches thread through my heart
Seven shiny reasons are tearing us apart
Eight lose your hate, it's a game so come on
Love me it's your fate
Nine cold crimes in the night please forgive me
Ten are the tears that are frozen on your face
Eleven I know, Im not your favourite man
Twelve Ill take you like only I can
