Waving my arms in the air
Love, my love, got no care
No care, no no
Pressing my feet to the ground
Stand up right where you stand
Call to you and what do you do ?
Laying back in a chair ?

She's so high on the air
She's so high on the air
Half and half, half and half
All you have to do to call
Is hold her hand, stand a while
And then smile and we'll understand
Yes we do, yes yes we do

Oh what a girl I've got too
Oh what a girl I've got too
With her slinky look she held her tie to her hair
And I could see everywhere
No one in the land, no one
No one in the land, no one
But it rains on Saturday
Cats and dogs in the hay
Stormy day, hey hey
And you shouldn't try to be what you can't be
You shouldn't try to be what you can't be
Call to you and what do you do ?
