Angels We Have Heard On High
Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains. Gloria...

(Chorus:)
Gloria, In Excelsius Deo

Shepherd why this jubilee
Why your joyous strains prolong
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heavenly song?

Hark! the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King
Peace on earth, and mercy mild
God and sinners reconcile
Joyful, all ye nations, rise
Join the triumph of the skies;
With the angelic host proclaim
'Christ is born in Bethlehem'
Hark! the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King

Christ, by highest heaven adored
Christ, the everlasting Lord
Late in time behold him come
Offspring of a virgin's womb
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see;
Hail, the incarnate deity
Pleased as Man with to dwell
Jesus, our Emmanuel!
Hark! the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King

Hail, the heaven-born Prince of peace!
Hail the Sun of righteousness!
Light and life to all he brings
Risen with healing in his wings
Mild he lays his glory by
Born that man no more may die
Born to raise the suns of earth
Born to give them second birth
Hark! the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King
