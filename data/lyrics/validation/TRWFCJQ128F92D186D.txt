[Verse 1: Terry Welles]
Sitting here all alone
Hoping that you will come back home
Skies are gray and birds won't sing
Money don't seem to me nothing

[Hook: Terry Welles]
I still love you
So let's be
Together once again
Let's be together
Once again

[Verse 2: Terry Welles]
Saddened heart, so afraid
Losing you
Was a such a bad mistake
But I could shake all my gloom
Just to see you walk into the room

[Hook: Terry Welles]
I still love you
So let's be
Together once again
Let's be together
Once again

[Verse 3: Terry Welles]
I'm so mellow
I just can't get my mind together
Since the day you left me
I'm so blue
All because I keep missing you
In my life
Oh in my life
But I could shake all my gloom
Just to see you walk into the room
O
And I know you'd hold me tight
We could make love all through the night

[Hook: Terry Welles]
I still love you
So let's be
Together once again
Let's be together
Once again
Once again

[Outro: Terry Welles]
Hey baby
Do me a favor
Won't you come back to me
