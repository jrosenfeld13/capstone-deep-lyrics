Pin me up stretch out the limbs
I am your human shield
You've set out to feed or feast but not of you
No you set me up, come partake of me

Without your permission, without your response
Come have me, come have at me
Have all of me, come have at me, have me
I don't need this cocoon, get in feast, inside and out
