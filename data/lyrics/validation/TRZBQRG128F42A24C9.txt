Some of us are born
And then some of us are born again
Some of us are scared to death
And some just don't believe in it
Something's always wrong
There's a line
An idea i can't get behind
No one knows whats right
Some try
Some just try to find a king
They say
Who will save us now
It's our life
But we dont want to live it
We want to be told how
By something or someone
Who's better than us
Who we know we can trust
Who will always protect us
Keep us scared to death
So we never ask questions
We'll dictate the consequences of our actions
And give us peace of mind about our miserable lives
Find it content all we want is a place we can hide
We can hide
So we've always fought our wars
For what we're told's worth dying for
Land and love and god and wealth
But men in charge protect themselves
You can rest assured
It's the young and the poor who fought all our wars
Led to death by men who they chose
And hoped would protect them
And who will save us now

It's our life but we don't want to live it
And all you'll get is down
Cause the people you elect to protect your best interests
Will just protect themselves
And all their investments
And even those few
With the best of intentions
Will just push their views
What they think is right for you
And everyone else

You can't think for yourself
Because you've chosen to
Let someone else do it for you
For you
So we're left to drift between
Our waking life and all our dreams
Reality is relative
And that's all the advice I'll give
Life and death are hard
They're such strange and complicated issues
So listen, listen well
For insight --
No one knows what's right for you
Who will save us now?
It's a wrong
And irrelevant question
'Cuz we figured it out
With the people who love us
Who call us our brothers
Through lessons we've learned
From our fathers and mothers
Not looking for someone
To find our solutions
To fight all our battles
Or show us what truth is
By working hard to find our own peace of mind
Living and learning till we know what's right for our lives
Our lives
