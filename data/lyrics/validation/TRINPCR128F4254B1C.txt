Angel mercy, tears like rain
Hurt so good, can't feel no pain
Paint it black, drives me insane
So far gone I'm not the same

You give me one more reason
One more reason to die

Yo'be blood with no regrets
English words, they won't forget
Crimes of passion, cigarettes
Move by night he won't suspect
That you give me one more reason
One more reason to die

And I ask myself the same question
Every night
What makes me restless
What makes me fight

Car ahead eliminate
Smoking gun
That sealed their fate
Flesh and blood to instigate
85 dollars
Ain't she great

You give me one more reason
One more reason to die
