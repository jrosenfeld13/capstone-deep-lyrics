[Verse 1]
I'm told the case is now closed
So I can come to my senses
But when the question is posed
I'll have this meager defense

[Chorus]
I was hoping that you'd know better than that
I was hoping but you're an amateur
I was hoping that you'd know better
But I've been wrong before

[Verse 2]
Despite conclusions I drew
There was a chance you'd surprise me
And you'd be better than you
Cause I'd have left otherwise

[Chorus]
I was hoping that you'd know better than that
I was hoping but you're an amateur
I was hoping that you'd know better
But I've been wrong before

[Bridge]
So I wasn't thinking clearly
So you didn't think at all
I thought that was protocol

[Chorus]
I was hoping that you'd know better than that
I was hoping but you're an amateur
I was hoping that you'd know better
But I've been wrong before
