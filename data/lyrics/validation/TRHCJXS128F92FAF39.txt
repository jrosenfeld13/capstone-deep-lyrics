I need to feel redeemed

I'm going sideways down

An ever-winding road...

With an ever unbinding load

Of a one-track mind

Of a love that's lost somehow

Of a flashing sign

I'm under the wire now

Under the wire

I'm a train down the line

Nothing left to lose or gain

But distance over time

Under the wire

Over all that we've been through

Tell me what to do to get to you

I need to feel the breeze

Of a new day's dawn

I need to be released

From the cold steel rail I'm on

Shake the love for a woman

Break the emotion overdrive

Take the train to oblivion

At the crossing of our lives

Under the wire

I'm a train down the line

Nothing left to lose or gain

But distance over time

Under the wire

Over all that we've been through

Tell me what to do to get to you

I need to feel redeemed

I wear my heart on a grimy sleeve

I bear the pressure of oil and moving steam

Unaware of my gaining speed

I'm prepared to move ahead, take the lead...

Under the wire

I'm a train down the line

With nothing left to lose or gain

But distance over time

Under the wire

Over all that we've been through

Tell me what to do to get to you

I am a steel freight train...

I am a train wreck, hauling back to you
