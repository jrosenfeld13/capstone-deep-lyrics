Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea
To the open arms of the sea
Lonely rivers sigh, wait for me, wait for me
I'll be coming home, wait for me

Oh, my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long, lonely time
And time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine
Are you still mine?
I need your love
God speed your love to me

Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea
To the open arms of the sea
Lonely rivers sigh, wait for me, wait for me
I'll be coming home, wait for me

Oh, my love, my darling
I've hungered (hungered) for your touch
A long, lonely time
And time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?
I need your love
I...oh I need your love
God speed your love to me
