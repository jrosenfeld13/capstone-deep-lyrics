Brad Paisley:
Mother, do not cry for me
All of this, is exactly how, it's s'posed to be
Sara Evans:
I'm right here, can you hear my voice
My life my love my Lord, my baby boy

Brad Paisley:
As they nail me to this tree
Just know the Father waits for me
Sara Evans:
God how can, this be your will
To have your son, and my son killed

Brad Paisley:
Whatever happens, whatever you see
Whatever your eyes tell you has, become of me
This is not, is not the end
I am making, all things new again

Sara Evans:
I remember, when you were born
In that manger where I first held you, in my arms
So many miracles, and lives you've changed
And this world repays you how, with all this pain

Brad Paisley:
And as they nail me to this tree
Just know the Father waits for me
Sara Evans:
God how can, this be your will
To have your son, and my son killed

Brad Paisley (Sarah Evans):
Whatever happens (Whatever happens), whatever you see (I don't wanna see)
Whatever your eyes tell you has, become of me
This is not (Tell me it's not), is not the end
I am making, all things new again

Whatever happens (Oh-oh), whatever you see (Oh)
Whatever your eyes tell you has, become of me
This is not (No), is not the end
I am making, all things new again
