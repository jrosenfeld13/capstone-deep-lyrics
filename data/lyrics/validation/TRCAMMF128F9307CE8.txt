At general delivery, she picks up her mail
Mama says Johnny just got out of jail
She hopes he don't know where she's at
How could she have ever loved that kind of cat

But she remembers the dance in the moonlight
From the hall to the back of his car
He taught her how to drink whiskey
Three chords on a pawnshop guitar
She remembers the first time he kissed her
Back when the feeling was new
She sang the Red River Valley
For the cowboy who loved her so true

She's working each night at what she knows best
Hangin' in bars, a professional guest
She picks up a young buckaroo
Because he reminds her of someone she knew

The telephone rings off the hook by her bed
The other end's Johnny, a gun to his head
He said, You always look good in black
The next thing she heard was a bone-chilling crack

She pulled into town just at sunrise
Mama had strong coffee on
She said, You know he's always been crazy
It's best for us all that he's gone

So at the request of the family
Service was held for a few
She sang the Red River Valley
For the cowboy who loved her so true

But she remembered the dance in the moonlight
From the hall to the back of his car
He taught her how to drink whiskey
Three chords on a pawnshop guitar
She remembered the first time he kissed her
Back when the feeling was new
She sang the Red River Valley
For the cowboy who loved her so true
