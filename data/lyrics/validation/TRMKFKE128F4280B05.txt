You can lay right here beside me, like there ain't nothing wrong
Kill the light and say goodnight and turn the tv off
Act as if I don't know what it is that you can't find the words to say
Aw baby you can leave or you can stay
You're gone either way

We can share the bed and share the rent but this house ain't a home
And if I'm gonna be lonely I'd just assume be alone
How can you say you love me when you can't even look me in the face
Stay right here and disappear without a trace
You're gone either way

I don't need the hurt from hangin' on to someone who's got one foot out the door
And I can't waste another minute of my love if you don't love me anymore
No, no, no

Naw, don't need the hurt from hangin' on to someone who's got one foot out the door
I can't waste another minute of my love if you don't love me anymore

Don't know why you sit here with me, we both know the truth
You just worry 'bout what leavin' me would make people think of you
It don't matter what your mamma or your daddy or your preacher's got to say
Girl you can hit that door or waste another day
What kind of difference would it make
You're gone either way
Girl you're gone either way
So just get on
