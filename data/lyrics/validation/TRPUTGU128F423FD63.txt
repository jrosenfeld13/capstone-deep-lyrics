Knee deep in sewage
Maggots burrowing thru my face
Blinded by disease
Waiting for my living death to end

Slicing teeth
Infectious chewing at my skin
My blood is clotted with pus
The maddening shrill cries
Of rabid vermin never stop

I pick away
At my mouldering flesh
Insanity has left my mind
A tortured mess

Face chewed to bits
On my body they feast
Swimming in the rancid sewage
Spreading their disease
