Day chaos sour into the evening flow
The headache's gone with human undertow
Where the usual feelings ever trend
Fade away like footsteps in the sand

The hearts are stuck into seclusion live ghosts are shrunk
Into themselves impressive stagecraft of illusion...

Numbered among the stones and stocks
The fleet of faith goes upon the rocks
Stone deaf animated stones
Walking trees (crowned with)
Sphere-shaped bones

The evening sank into the midnight mire
And sadness starts to pull the wires:
"Is someone there to comprehend?"
The leading question for the people of the sand...
