(Bruce Robison)

What did you think that I've been waiting for
All night
To hear you cry again about her on my shoulder
And what did you think I could say to you
That you ain't heard
Wondering what in the world do I know about love

And what did you think that you've been waiting for
You've had
Long enough of throwin' good love after bad
And what in the world is all this talkin' for
Nobody's
Every changed nobody's mind about what's right
In front of them

When the cause of all your pain is spoken
One more breakin' heart is broken down

And what did you think the night is really for
Except for sleepin'
Or else that empty feelin' creepin' that they don't
Really care at all

When the cause of all your pain is hopin'
One more breakin' heart is broken down

What did you think I've been waiting for
All night
To hear you cry again about her on my shoulder
And what did you think that I could say to you
That you ain't heard
I'm wondering what in the world do I know about love, about love

Do I know about love, about love
