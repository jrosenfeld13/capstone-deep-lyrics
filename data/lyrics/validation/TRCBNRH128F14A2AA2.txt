Push me down the stairs and say "I love you"
Tell me that you miss me that's ok
I'm the one who saw you - first and last and always
Well you're the snowfall. smother me
Tell me how it feels to be alive without a clue?
Well I'm not you
Your eyes have swallowed me
I'll climb on in
Sail across these seas of blue
You know the snow falls at the most curious times
