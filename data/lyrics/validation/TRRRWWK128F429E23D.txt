Why won't you tell me
You won't owe me anything
It just goes to see
You're not here tonight for me

Are you one of those
Who just lives for the now
Or are you one of those
Who just-

Don't stop moving
Don't stop moving
Don't stop moving
Mum's the word
Don't stop moving
Don't stop moving
Don't stop moving
Mum's the word

You always say I'm sublime
And I can never make up my mind
But it all adds up to me
That you're not here tonight for me

I see you standing there
The weight of the world goes by
But I'm not standing here
Just you wait, oh

Don't stop moving
Don't stop moving
Don't stop moving
Mum's the word
Don't stop moving
Don't stop moving
Don't stop moving
Mum's the word

Things explode in my ears, but I want all of you

I'm not a "meet-your-father" kind of girl

And things get worse and worse just because of you

So I for one would like to know him more

La la la la la etc

All change now cos this is life
All change now cos this is nice

Comes and it goes
And comes and it goes
And nobody out there ever will know

All change now cos this is life
