Brand new (it's a brand new dance, yes it is)
Brand new (it's a brand new dance, say it again)
Brand new (said it's a brand new dance, say it again)
Brand new

[Verse 1:]
Rhythm, as you know, 'causes joy to flow
Cast your cares and let go
It can make you feel much better
What does this all mean?
Does life become serene?
Will there be those days
Where things won't get much better
Here's a dance for always and not just for today
But to last for generations
Up and down you can move
It's a choice left for you
Join in

[Chorus:]
It's a brand new dance, beyond circumstance
You can stomp your feet freedom guaranteed
It's a brand new dance, not some fancy prance
This beat starts within and it never ends

[Verse 2:]
When life gets you down, confusion's all around
Still always, in your heart, hear the music playing
Playing, playing, playing
Does much more than please
It sets the captives free
Nevermore again living without laughter
No more, no more
Taught when I was a kid
His joy would be my strength
He will love me now and after
Had been bound by my deeds
He said leap 'til I'm free
And I did, yes I did

[Chorus] (2x)

Here's what you do

[Vamp:] (2x)
Get up on your feet, clap your hands
Get up on your feet, it's a brand new dance
Get up on your feet, clap your hands
Get up on your feet, it's a brand new dance

It's a brand new dance
It's a brand new dance
It's a brand new dance
It's a brand new dance
