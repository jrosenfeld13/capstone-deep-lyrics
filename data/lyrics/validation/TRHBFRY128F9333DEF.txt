I want your love

I'm gonna have you
When I want to
I'm gonna take you
That's what I like

I'm going down now
Deeper and deeper
Under your skin now
You know that it's right

I want to love you
I want your love
I want to love you
I want your love

You can't tell me
That you don't want it
You know that I like it
When you put up a fight

I'm gonna have you
When I want to
I'm gonna take you
That's what I like

I want to love you
I want your love
I want to love you
I want your love

I'm gonna have you
When I want to
I'm gonna take you
That's what I like

I'm going down now
Deeper and deeper
Under your skin
You know that it's right

I want to love you
I want your love
I want to love you
I want your love
