Blinded by love, I can't see the morning sun
Blinded by love, I can't see when the day is done

Never meant to hurt, never meant harm
Never meant to get involved
Never meant to hurt, never meant harm
Never meant to get involved
La da da da dai.. La da da da dai..
La da da da da da dai..
La da da da dai.. La da da da dai..
La da da da da da dai..

Blinded by love, I can't see the morning sun
Blinded by love, I can't see when the day is done

Look around the corner, what do I see.. yeah
Great big stone wall staring at me
Look over yonder, what's that I see
Great big wide world staring at me

Well I was leaving town last summer
But my friends said stick around
And though the summer breeze was at my knees
I stayed in this little old town
Winter rolls around freezin' up my brain
Sayin' you'd better move around before you go insane

Summer didn't lie, winter didn't lie
Time you gotta get away
Summer didn't lie, winter didn't lie
Time you gotta say goodbye

Blinded by love, I can't see the morning sun
Blinded by love, I can't see when the day is done

Well I fell in love last summer she begged me to stay
It was just a matter of time for the miracle's gone away
Tears are on my pillow... sad, broke and shy
I wanna drink of the water but the well is going dry

Look around the corner, what's that I see
Great big stone wall staring at me
Look over yonder, what's that I see
Great big wide world staring at me

Summer didn't lie, winter didn't lie
Time you gotta get away
Summer didn't lie, winter didn't lie
Time you gotta say goodbye

Blinded by love, I can't see the morning sun
Blinded by love, I can't see when the day is done
Blinded by love, I can't see the morning sun
Blinded by love, I can't see when the day is done
