Yeah yeah oh yeah yeah oh yeah
When I see your face like the morning sun you spark to shine
Tell all the world my need is fulfilled and that's a new design
Oh as long as you're near there is no fear of victory
But when I'm away influences stray my mind to disagree
Aw wanna see your face in the morning sun ignite my energy
The cause and effect of you has brought new meaning in my life to me

Gonna tell the story morning glory all about the serpentine fire
Gonna tell the story morning glory all about the serpentine fire
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah yieh yieh yieh yi yi
I need to see your face in the morning sun ignite my energy
The cause and effect of you has brought new meaning in my life to me
The moment I find when I'm inclined to do my best
Negative wins when I give in then I lose the test
Not many times gonna tell the story morning glory
All about the serpentine fire
Gonna tell the story morning glory all about the serpentine fire
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah

Gonna tell the story morning glory all about the serpentine fire
Gonna tell the story morning glory all about the serpentine fire

As life begun you will as one battle with the serpentine fire
