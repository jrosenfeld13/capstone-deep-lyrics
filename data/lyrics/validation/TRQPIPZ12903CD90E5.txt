We drunk too much
Just to remember
Oblivion's clear, in morning light

Could we plunge any further?

Memory is lying
On the ocean's floor
We drink a lot, to dive within

Could we plunge any deeper?

The wolves spread out, go to the houses on New Year's eve
Tidy up the closets and make the beds and hide every peace of proof
The wolves spread out, go to the houses on New Year's eve
Tidy up the closets and make the beds and then devour the elderly

Man we'll desert you at the hight of your glory
These arms we were hanging on to - arms of a dead man
Waves break on the bridge, you are jumping on it
Keens echo, clouds stream, and then a deep, ten year long whirlpool
Made me loose all I ever had

That's how we met
Worn out on a deserted life boat
Escape from the umpteenth wreckage
An empire surfaces from the ruins of the last declined dream
Don't look at him!
Please! Please!
Something terrible is going on
Flocks of birds move away from the coast
Under the weeping willow your son makes love for the first time in the day of war

Light house keepers murdered on the cliff
And the cliff burns..
