[Verse 1]
Your head, you will lose it
Severed when executed
You always thought
You'd never get caught

[Chorus]
Decapitate
Sealing your fate

[Verse 2]
Rebels' futile efforts
Are quelled with effective measures
The sentence is read
Words that you dread

[Chorus]
Decapitate
Walk through Hell's gate

[Verse 1]
You've lost your head sir
Well, you will tomorrow
Sleep well
This court's best deterrent
To set new precedents
The verdict of course
Couldn't be worse

[Chorus]
Decapitate
Example be made
Decapitate
Will seal your fate
