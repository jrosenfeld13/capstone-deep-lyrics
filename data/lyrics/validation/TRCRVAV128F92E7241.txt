When shadows fall he'll close his eyes to hear the clocks unwind
Powerless to leash the hands of time
Kingdoms fall, the earth revolves, the rain will come this spring
And nothing he could say would change a thing

"Seven wonders" crowed the man, knowing six are gone
And how the great illusion lingers on

He can't enfold the sun or moon, the wind within his hands
But count the times he'll shout "the great I am"
When all the while, a pontiff smile, veiling his disgrace
At never owning more than second place

"Seven wonders" crowed the man, knowing six are gone
And how the great illusion lingers on

"Seven wonders" crowed the man, knowing six are gone
And how the great illusion lingers
Oh, the grand illusion lingers
While the sad confusion lingers on
