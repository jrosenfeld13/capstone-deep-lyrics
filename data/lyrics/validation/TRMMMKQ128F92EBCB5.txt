See them all marching beyond the horizon of hate
Bound by an ancient curse, annihilate
Nothing will break them apart
No sign of fear ever touches their hearts
So they endure side by side
Brothers in spirit their trust and their faith
Their bloodline

All Of The Same Blood, All Of The Same Blood
Legions forgotten by the gods

See them all marching towards the final frontier
Fantasies killed by realities cold atmosphere
Ambitions to purify
Cleansing all cast out dehumanise
Destroy all that crosses their path
Armies of totalitarian psychopaths

All Of The Same Blood, All Of The Same Blood
Legions forgotten by the gods

Is this what distopia breeds
Within the darkest beliefs
Taking utopia away
Distorted truth lead you astray
With time you will come to see
Deprived of the hope that was built on unity

And so the darkness fades, metropolis awakes
Another empty day in lives so dark and grey
And words of propaganda hammered into their heads
Consumers swastikas to put some life into the dead
