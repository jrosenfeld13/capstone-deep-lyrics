It arrived when the deers wore blue
And it came as a surprise
They showed what it means to hide
Now i know you're alright

It breaks me to see you cry
And it hurts when you can't deny
But it thrills me to see that you're more than
Someone that i love

We met up with good old friends
And we talked all through the night
One said "is the fire burning out?"
And another closed his eyes

It breaks me to see you cry
And it hurts when you can't deny
But it thrills me to see that you're more than
Someone that i love

Unsure of what to leave behind
But i know we'll be alright
I'll remember all the things we've done
For the rest of my life

It breaks me to see you cry
And it hurts when you can't deny
But it thrills me to see that you're more than
Someone that i love

It breaks me to see you cry
And it hurts when you can't deny
But it thrills me to see that you're more than
Someone that i love
