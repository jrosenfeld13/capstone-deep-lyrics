You bought their lines and you staked their trail, followed their moves to the last detail
And all that they sold you was death, on the five year plan
And left you to rot in their promised land
And what made you think that the life on the screen could be you?
No returns for your broken dreams when you get it home and it's not what it seems
This is not the promised land
