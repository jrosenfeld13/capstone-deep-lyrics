Found that man reported missing
He wandered in his home
It don't seem to bad if you consider
Just what he's been through
It seems he met up with a gang of thieves
Who mistook him for a man of means
They locked him up, then found he had no money
And so they let him go again
Now he's back at home and happy
Just to see the kids

I wish that I could really tell you
All the things that happen to me
And all that I have seen:
A world full of people, their hearts full of joy
Cities of light with no fear of war
And thousands of creatures with happier lives
And dreams of a future with meaning and no need to hide

Oh, keep it dark

It seems strange to have to lie
About a world so bright
Tell instead a made-up story
From the world of night

I wish that I could really tell you
All the things that happen to me
And all that I have seen:
A world full of people, their hearts full of joy
Cities of light with no fear of war
And thousands of creatures with happier lives
And dreams of a future with meaning and no neeed to lie
No need to hate, no need to hide

Oh, keep it dark
