I remember days gone by
And what it was first like
To never think that it could end
Don't know what we were thinking

And I reflect upon that night
When we would breathe for the first time
To see the hands raised high
To the one we'd give our lives

To this day I wouldn't change a single thing
Except mistakes that separates to feel again
The reason in what we give
The part, the role in which we live

I feel like something busting
Breaking out of its own skin
I feel this child escaping
Outside of the heart of an old man

I feel like something ripping
And tearing off this callous
Revealing me

I never want it to end
This old feeling, we're feeling again
I never want it to end
This old feeling, we're feeling again

Through the seasons of it all
There were deserts that would fall
And there were peaks that we would climb
But in the valley's where we shined

We couldn't dream a better dream
The Almighty call our name
And do something with nothing
And give purpose to melody

To this day I wouldn't change a single thing
Except mistakes that separates to feel again
The reason in what we give
The part, the role in which we live

I feel like something busting
Breaking out of its own skin
I feel this child escaping
Outside of the heart of an old man

I feel like something ripping
And tearing off this callous
Revealing me

I never want it to end
This old feeling, we're feeling again
I never want it to end
This old feeling, we're feeling again

Never end!

I never want it to end
This old feeling, we're feeling again
I never want it to end
This old feeling, we're feeling again
