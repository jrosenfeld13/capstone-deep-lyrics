I cannot make up my mind

(Verse 1)
Feelings deep inside of me, I know it's there and it wants to be free
But I'm not sure
These emotions, I have a little fear, but I'll find strength in my ideas
I don't know who is wrong, so I will just sing this song

(Chorus)
I cannot make up my mind
Should I be good or bad
Should I go with the flow
Or will I take control?
It cannot be up to me, it must be up to you
I don't know what to do, maybe I'll follow you
Oh Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

(Verse 2)
I feel as light as a feather
My heart is broken
Should I move on? I'm not sure (you make it all seem so real)
These emotions, I have a little fear, but I'll find strength In my ideas
I don't know who is wrong, so I will just sing this song

(Chorus x2)
Yeah, yeah

I just don't know, yeah (x4)

(Chorus x2)
Yeah (x4)

I Call on you, it's never hard on you (x2)

(Chorus) til fade
