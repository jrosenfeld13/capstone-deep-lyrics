You know I feel most the time like a kite on a line
Tossed about, no control, any way the wind blows
Then I see you holding on
The string that runs, me to you all that keeping me tied to
This world so long
Oh Id be gone

So dont let me go
Oh I might fly away
Come on talk me down

When the light turns to black, when the weight on my back
Gets to much, I start to bend, can not straighten out again
Then I feel you there, you lift me up
Yeah when Im out on the ledge just one step from the edge
You take my hand
And you understand

So dont let me go
Oh I might fly away
Come on talk me down
Yeah, talk me down

When no one else can get through
All I want to hear is you
Saving me, saving me from myself

So dont let me go
Oh I might fly away
Come on talk me down
Yeah, talk me down

I said dont let me go
Oh I might fly away
Come on talk me down
Yeah, bring me round
