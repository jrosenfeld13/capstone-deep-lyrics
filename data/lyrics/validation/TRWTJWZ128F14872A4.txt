They call us rough, gaudy and crude
Ain't got no edicate, ain't got no cuth
We got our own way to see the truth
Why should we complicate and lose our
Youth

We help each other to find the truth
We help each other you can too
We help each other when we're tired and blue
If you help others they'll help you

Tell me who you can call for
When you're in trouble man
Why don't you give each other
A helpin hand

We're a livin example of this practice brother
We helped ourselves by helpin each other
Don't try for peace of mind by beingun aware

When you see life in danger for heaven's sake, care
They tell us that progress is definitely there
Well yea we know we're goin ya'll but have
You thought about where

Yea we're proud healthy happy and free
We fly the cosmos of humanity
Just like our father's together we stand
To hell with evil it'll all be damned
All be damned

We help each other to find the truth
We help each other you can too
We help each other when we're tired and blue
If you help others they'll help you
