Day by day by day oh
Livin' day by day oh...

I want to make it in life
I want the chance to be right
I want to make it in my life
I want the children to see
They have the right to be free
I want to see it in my life

Born and raised in Babylon
Under lock and key
Still they keep the pressure on
Trying to control me

Can't make it alone
I don't want to wait in vain
Together we're strong
Believe it and we'll break the chain

Day by day by day oh
Livin' day by day oh...

I want to make it in life
I want the chance to be right
I want to make it in my life
I want the children to see
They have the right to be free
I want to see it in my life

Equal opportunity
It is only talk to me
'Cause the rules of the game are set
Dividing our realities
Work is always going to be
Hard for everyone
Without the love, without the honesty
That we need to go on

Can't make it alone
I don't want to wait in vain
Together we're strong
Believe it and we'll break the chain

Can't make it alone
I don't want to wait in vain
Together we're strong
Believe it and we'll break the chain

Days I fought just to be free
Still I'm chained here in poverty
Life's a road of insecurities
But I know unity is the key

Can't make it alone
I don't want to wait in vain
Together we're strong
Believe it and we'll break the chain

Can't make it alone
I don't want to wait in vain
Together we're strong
Believe it and we'll break the chain

Can't make it alone
I don't want to wait in vain
Together we're strong
Believe it and we'll break the chain
