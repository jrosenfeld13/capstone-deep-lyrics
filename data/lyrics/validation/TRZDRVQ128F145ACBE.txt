Feel
The truth
Come Shining through
Soon There'll be
There'll be no place to turn to
In the light
Of the day
So far away
From anything
Anything that we've been used to

Just another mind gone
Just another mad song
From a self neglector
I'm telling you
It's just another night crow
Another mind blow
And then rejected
Another mind gone

Hard
To say
The right way
It should be ours
Ours just for the taking
In the dawns
They're lying
Give us strenght of mind
Yet leaves us on
While other hearts are breaking

It's just another lifewire
Just another hell fire
Needed understanding
Hear me now
It's just another headcase
Another lost face
Being so demanding
Another mind gone

It seems so hard
To keep my sanity
Just stay in touch
With reality
I apologise
I don't want a ride
I don't want to be
Another mind gone

It's just another mind gone
Just another mad dog
Feeling selfneglected
Telling you
It's just another headcase
Another lost face
Being so demanding
Another mind gone
Yeah
Another mind gone
Another mind gone
Another mind gone
Another mind gone
Just another mad song I know
Another mind gone
Another mind gone
Another mind gone
Another mind gone
It's just another headcase
Just another lost face
And there's a mind gone
