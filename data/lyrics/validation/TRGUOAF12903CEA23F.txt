How I long to see your eyes
Your eyes fill me up, I breathe them inside
I have your image deep inside of me
I hold your picture, Its a part of me

(Chorus) It has been so long X4
Without you there is no sun, just sky
I'm a wound that's bone deep, bled dry
I have your image deep inside of me
I hold your picture, its a part of me
Chorus... Chorus X2
