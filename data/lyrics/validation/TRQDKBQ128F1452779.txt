Africa is my descent
And here I am far from home
I dwell within a land that is meant
For many men not my tone
The blood of god is my defense
Let it drop down to my seed
Showers to your innocence
To protect u for all eternity
And with this wood I beat this drum
And we won't see defeat
From kings to queens becomes a prince
Knowledge wisdom is
Understanding what we need
Ever since the day u came
My whole world began to change
I knew then to dedicate my life
4 your own
Everyday I see u grow
And remember what u already know
I receive the love
That radiates from your glow
From which u came was love
And that's how it all should be
U and my soul are I
Though all the time and history
