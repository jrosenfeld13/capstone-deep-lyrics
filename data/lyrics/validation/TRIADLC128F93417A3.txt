It was when I rode off in my daydreams
Chasing that vision of light
It was then I got caught in the jet stream
And I dropped through a hole in the night
And I knew it's not you that I run from
I saw each of us living alone
And I prayed that you still could be waiting
That's when I started for home

Oh my Jenny
Oh my Jenny
Oh my Jenny my love
Oh my Jenny
Oh my Jenny
You are my rainbow above

I have seen a great city in the darkness
Dream lady dressed in cold concrete
I've seen the City of Angels
With the names of its dead in the street
And for once I could see it all your way
And for once I knew I was all wrong
And I thought of you there in my door way
And I knew I've been travelin' too long

Oh my Jenny
Oh my Jenny
Oh my Jenny my love
Oh my Jenny
Oh my Jenny
You are my rainbow above

As I crossed to the heart of the country
I was lost in a forest of signs
And I laughed 'cause life gets so funny
Here I was wasted from wastin' my time
So now shine down your sun on my shadow
Without you I don't mean a thing
And I gather me one golden morning, babe
'Cause it's your song that I need to sing

Oh my Jenny
Oh my Jenny
Oh my Jenny my love
Oh my Jenny
Oh my Jenny
You are my rainbow above
