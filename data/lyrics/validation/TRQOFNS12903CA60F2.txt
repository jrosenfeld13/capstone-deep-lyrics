Deborah Conway and Richard Pleasance
He is friends with everyone
And everybody is his friend
The stakes are high but he is sure
They will be loyal to the end
What wouldn't we do with friends like that
Walk to the edge of the precipice
Balance like a dancer in her finest hour
I don't want to be the King of Jordan
I don't want to be the King of Jordon
We are humbled by the sight
Of crown and sceptre in its glory
Tall dark handsome and polite
Makes such a pretty cover story
But the fence that he's been sitting on is not so strong
And the line that he's been taking is not so straight
And there's blind curves all down this road
Are you so sure of where you stand
When you're the centre of attention
As fame and fortune hover round
The unbelievers appetite is whetted
And long knives are easy to conceal
And a smile hides a multitude of sins
And I don't like the way you're looking at me
