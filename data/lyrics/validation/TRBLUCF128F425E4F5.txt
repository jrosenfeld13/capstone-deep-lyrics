Put up your barricades
There's money to be made
Continue your charade
Money to be made

What you're asking for means the world to me
You draw close as you whisper "precisely
Precisely"

Your safety is assured
Behind those eggshell walls of yours

Friends and family fly by on wings of faith
Faithlessly I don't recognize a face
Not a single face

Take this sorry soul
Made enough of a mess on my own
On my own

Put up your barricades
There's money to be made
