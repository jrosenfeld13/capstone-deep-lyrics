Freedom the naked power
Weakened by the ages
Raped, but not forgotten
All it's supple secrets
Gods and liberations
Those that try to use it
Are those that try to sheath it
Wide awake

Yes, I am the American man
Yes, I am the American man
Yes, I am the American man
Yes, I am the American man

Free man
Haunted by the music
Ghosts of generations
Beat the drums for freedom
Those who toiled and suffered
Now, those they try to smother
Wide awake

Yes, I am the American man
Yes, I am the American man
Yes, I am the American man
Yes, I am the American man

Where to begin?
Bred to win
Where do I go?
The soul worn off my skin
So...
I cut out the hole in my soul, I know is you
So are we ready
Ready to lose?
I know I feel, feel, feel
Inside the walls
Inside the walls
The iron walls protect the souls
Of my old boots

Yes, I am the American man
Yes, I am the American man
Yes, I am the American man
Yes, I am the American man
Yes, I am the American man
Yes, I am the American man
Yes, I am the American man
Yes, I am the American man
