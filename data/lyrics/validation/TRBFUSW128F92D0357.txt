Who is she?
This beautiful creature
Insisting on being alone?
It would all make sense
If you could hear her on the phone:

Hello, who's there?
Oh no
How'd you find me?
I gotta go
Don't wanna hear
Another lie
You tell me that you love me
And you promise that you'll change
You broke my heart
This time we're through
Now say goodbye

Say goodbye
Say goodbye
It's too late to give it one more try
You'll always have my heart
I guess you knew it from the start
But if you love me
Say goodbye

I take you back
And then
You go and hurt me
I've had enough
I'm such a fool
I don't know why
I've got to start my life again
It's over can't you see
This time it's done
It's really done
Please say goodbye

Say goodbye
Say goodbye
It's too late to give it one more try
You'll always have my heart
I guess you knew it from the start
But if you love me
Say goodbye

And the nights are gonna get easier
That's what they say
See, sometimes I don't even think about you
I don't even dream about you
Sometimes I don't even miss you
Night and day

Say goodbye
Please say goodbye
Baby it's too late to give it one more try
You'll always have my heart
I guess you knew it from the start
But if you love me
Say goodbye
If you love me
If you love me
Say goodbye
