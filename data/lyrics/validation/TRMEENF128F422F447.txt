[Intro]
Hey, darlin
You paint a pretty picture
The sun is clouded (yeah)
But we'll find our way home
Yes, we'll find our way home

[Verse 1]
Casting shadows on the pavement
Dancing toe to toe
Is this all you are
(Is this all you hope to be?)
Oh no, its just all that I know
Is it enough, and are you happy?
Do you need more?

[Chorus]
You had my heart (can't watch you watch me walk away)
What more could you want?
You had my heart (Don't you care)
(Don't you care enough to let me go)
You know that it meant everything, now everything feels far too wrong

[Verse 2]
Little girl, listen well
But you must promise that you'll never, ever tell
I speak like fire
And it burns your ears
But who will wipe away your tears?

[Chorus]
You had my heart (can't watch you watch me walk away)
What more could you want?
You had my heart (Don't you care)
(Don't you care enough to let me go)
You know that it meant everything, now everything feels far too wrong
Far too wrong

[Bridge]
If only you had words to make the sadness I feel go away
If only you had words to make the sadness I feel go away

[Chorus]
You had my heart
What more could you want? (What more could you want?)
You had my heart (Don't you care)
(Don't you care enough to let me go)
You know that it meant everything, now everything feels far too wrong
(Wrong)

[Outro]
Hey, darlin
You paint a pretty picture
The sun is clouded
We'll find our way home
Yes, we'll find our way home
