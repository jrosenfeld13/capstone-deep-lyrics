[Verse 1]
Am I foolishness to you?
And is it laughable the things I do?
Can you callused minds see past yourselves to His divine?
Am I foolishness to you?

[Chorus]
Can I sing about my Maker and have you not role your eyes?
Can I weep about my Savior and the way He died?
I know it don't make sense to those who ride the fence
But I'm sold out to Christ
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

[Verse 2]
You call it loosening up and loosening up
I call it spiraling down, woah
Only one thing's the same, only one thing remains
Jesus, Jesus

[Chorus]
Can I sing about my Maker and have you not role your eyes?
Can I weep about my Savior and the way He died?
I know it don't make sense to those who ride the fence
But I'm sold out to Christ

[Bridge]
You're all asleep, yes
You're all asleep, yeah
You're all asleep, all children
But He's over needed
You, you don't see it, no

[Chorus]
Can I sing about my Maker and have you not role your eyes?
Can I weep about my Savior and the way He died?
I know it don't make sense to those who ride the fence
But I'm sold out to Christ

Can I sing about my Maker and have you not role your eyes?
Can I weep about my Savior and the way He died?
I know it don't make sense to those who ride the fence
But I'm sold out to Christ
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, yeah-yeah-yeah
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, yeah-woah
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, yeah-yeah-yeah
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
