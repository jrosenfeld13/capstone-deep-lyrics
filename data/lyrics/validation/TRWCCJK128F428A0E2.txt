Stars in your eyes, little one
Where do you go to dream?
To a place we all know
The land of make believe

Shadows tapping at your window
Ghostly voices whisper "Will you come and play?"
Not for all the tea in China
Or the corn in Carolina
Never, never ever
They're running after you babe

Run for the sun little one
You're an outlaw once again
Time to change
Superman will be with us while he can
In the land of make believe

Something nasty in your garden's
Waiting patiently ?til it can have your heart
Try to go, but it won't let you
Don't you know it's out to get you
Running, keep on running
They're running after you babe

Your world is turning from night to day
Your dream is burning far away
Into the blue, you and I
O the circus in the sky
Captain Kidd's on the sand
With the treasure close to hand
In the land of make believe
In the land of make believe

I've got a friend who comes to tea
And nobody else can see but me
He came today, but had to go
To visit you? you never know"
