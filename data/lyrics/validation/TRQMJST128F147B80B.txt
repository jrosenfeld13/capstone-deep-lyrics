I wake her, I hold her
I tell her I love her
And she smiles and says the same
She makes me feel like sunshine when she says my name
Her laughing, her crying
Her caring, her sharing
Of my life means more to me
Than all the wealth and fame that fortune brings to me
Turn your head around
Are you sure love's the feeling that surrounds you?
Does the question count when you feel good
As good inside as I do, do you?
The sun sets, the gulls fly
We love us, she and I
