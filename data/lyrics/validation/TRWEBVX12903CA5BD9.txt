There's no wolves around here
There's no wolves around here
Have a drink
Drink your fill
From the tap
From the still
If you won't, i will
But there are no wolves around here

There's no reason to cry
There's no reason to cry
You can have a seat for a while
Relax
Smile
But don't touch that dial
'cause there is no reason to cry

There's a gutteral stop in my throat
There's a gutteral stop in my throat
The wind comes in from far and wide
Sands blow
Grains collide
I'm changing inside
And there's a gutteral stop in my throat
