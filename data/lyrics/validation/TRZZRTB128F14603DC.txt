I've got nothing to penetrate
And I've got nothing to elevate
I can't seem to concentrate
Cause I've got nothing to contemplate

I wouldn't know the solution (penetrate)
Cause this ain't my revolution (penetrate)
I practice my prostitution (penetrate)
And spread the people's pollution (penetrate)

I've got nothing to mediate
And I've got nothing to dedicate
I can't seem to separate
Cause I've got nothing to liberate

I wouldn't know the solution (penetrate)
Cause this ain't my revolution (penetrate)
I practice my prostitution (penetrate)
And spread the people's pollution (penetrate)

I wouldn't know the solution (penetrate)
Cause this ain't my revolution (penetrate)
I practice my prostitution (penetrate)
And spread the people's pollution (penetrate)

I've got no one to aggravate
And I've got no one to emulate
You want me to assimilate
But I'm not going to imitate
