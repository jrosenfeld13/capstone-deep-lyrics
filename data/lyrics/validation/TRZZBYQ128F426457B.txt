I woke up today
Nothin's changed though nothin's the same
Look out my window I should have konwn
Nothin' but clouds nothin' but rain
Two pots of coffee I'm on my way
Over worked and I'm under paid

This isn't my life
This isn't who I'm supposed to be
What happened to my life
What has happened to me?

Turn the world off
Turn myself on
Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio

Turn the world off
Turn myself on
Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
I'm not alone

A thousand faces
A thousand stories I'll never know
Freeway's flooded they're on their way
All dressed up and nowhere to go

This isn't your life
This isn't who you're supposed to be
Forget about your life
Let's just forget about everything

Turn the world off
Turn yourself on
Turn up your radio
Turn up the radio

Turn the world off
Turn yourself on
Turn up your radio
Turn up the radio

Just to feel good
Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Need to feel good
Turn up the radio

You'll be alright tonight
Just turn up and let it go

You'll be alright tonight
Just turn up and let it go

You'll be alright tonight
Just turn up and let it go

Turn the world off
Turn yourself on
Turn up your radio
Turn up the radio

Turn the world off
Turn yourself on
Turn up your radio
Turn up the radio

Need to feel good
Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Just to feel good
Turn up the radio
