When I couldn't sleep
When I saw shadows moving
When I had to cry
I was afraid of the unknown
When I wasn't sure of where my next footstep would fall
He was always there
When I did some things out of my mind
When I let my life stray out of line
When I put myself in danger
When I just didn't care
He was my knight in shining gear
He was my strength to face the fear
My booming voice of reason
Now my childhood hero down
I don't even know who's there anymore
He came walking right on in through my door
Through my door
All I remember is a demons attack
I had to protect myself from coming back
Coming back
Felt the pain of evil wrapping hands around my throat
Couldn't run away cause both my legs had been broke
Grab a gun and shoot into the dark to save my life
Didn't know what I had done til I turned on the light
Childhood hero down
Oh my God what have I done
Childhood hero down
It's just a dream that's in my head
Not just your father figure lifeless on the floor
He never should have just come walking through my door
I have to battle all the demons in my sleep
This is the company I keep that I keep
Felt the pain of evil wrapping hands around my throat
Couldn't run away cause both my legs had been broke
Grab a gun and shoot into the dark to save my life
Didn't know what I had done til I turned on the light
Childhood hero down
Oh my God what have I done
Childhood hero down
It's just a dream that's in my head
Childhood hero down
Memories and brains upon the wall
Childhood hero down
It's just a dream that's in my head
Why are all my loved ones dead
Childhood hero down
Oh my God what have I done
A shot in the dark has killed the one I love
Childhood hero down
Daddy what were you doing in my room
When I was dreaming death and doom
Childhood hero down
Memories and brains upon the wall
Watching my childhood evil fall
Childhood hero down
It's just a dream that's in my head
Why are all my loved ones dead-dead
