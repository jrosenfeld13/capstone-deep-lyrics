[Verse]
It's been three days of drums and snares
Out on the streets and in my head
The piccolos are in this band
With you and me just lying and
Saying "I'll wait"
Saying "always"

To have the chance to be so kind
To someone else who doesn't mind
Is getting rare and often times
It seems to scare the wandering eye
Looking always
Saying "I'll wait"

[Chorus]
This convalesce it is broke
Comforts the test letting go
You snare the game of our heart
But you went gone
So please stow this heart
It's cold, it's hard
Please stow this heart
It's cold, it's hard

[Verse]
I wandered off under the news
The bezzle town on troll abuse
Just thinking of some name I knew
Without a sense of self to use
Saying "I'll wait"
Saying "always"

And offer come, as soon as I
Knew who it was who wasn't mine
You had convinced me of the white
And so I left myself behind
Saying "I'll wait"
Saying "always"

[Chorus]
This convalesce it is broke
Comforts the test letting go
You snare the game of our heart
But you went gone
So please stow this heart
It's cold, it's hard
Please stow this heart
It's cold, it's hard
