[Verse 1]
I'll lay down my glasses
I'll lay down in houses
If things come alive

[Verse 2]
I'll subtract pain by ounces
Yeah, I will start painting houses
If things come alive

[Verse 3]
I promise to commit no acts of violence
Be it physical or otherwise
If things come alive

[Bridge]
I'll say it now
I'll say it now
I'll say it now
Oh, I'll say it now
Cuz I want it now

[Pre-Chorus]
When personality is scarred tissue
We travel South with disuse
I'm subtle like a lion's cage
Such a cautious display

[Chorus]
Remember take hold of your time here
Give some meanings to the means
To your end
Not even jail

[Verse 4]
We marshal in the days of longing
We tremble like anyone's children
And wink towards the fire

[Verse 5]
I'm erring on the side of caution
Betraying no other symptom
But girl, you shake it right

[Verse 6]
I will bounce you on the lap of silence
We will free up to the beats of science
And girl, you shake it right
I'll say it now

[Bridge]
Oh, but hold it still, darling, your hair so pretty
Can't you feel the warmth of my sincerity?
You make motion when you cry

You're making people's lives feel less private
Don't take time away
You make motion when you cry

We all hold hands
Can't we all hold hands
When we make new plans?

[Pre-Chorus]
I pretend like no one else
To try and control myself
I'm subtle like a lion's cage
Such a cautious display

[Chorus]
Remember take hold of your time here
Give some meanings to the means
To your end
Not even jail
