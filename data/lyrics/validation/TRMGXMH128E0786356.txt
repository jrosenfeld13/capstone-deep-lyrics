[Chorus]
(Oh Deanna) Oh Deanna
(Oh Deanna) Oh Deanna (Oh Deanna)
Well you know you are my friend, now (Oh Deanna)
And I ain't down here for your money
And I ain't down here for your love
I ain't down here for your money
I'm down here for your soul

[Verse 1]
There no carpet on the floor
And the winding cloth holds many moths
Around your Ku Klux furniture
I cum a deaths-head in your frock
And we discuss the murder plan
We discuss murder and the murder act
Murder takes the wheel of your Cadillac
And death climbs in the back

[Chorus]
(Oh Deanna) Oh Deanna
(Oh Deanna) Sweet Deanna
(Oh Deanna) Oh Deanna

[Verse 2]
Well, this is a car
And this is a gun
And this a day number one
Our little crimeworn histories
Black and your smoking christmas trees
And honey, it ain't a mystery
Why you're a mystery to me

[Verse 3]
We will eat out of their pantries
And their parlours
Ashy leavings in their beds
And we'll unload into their heads
On this mean season
But his little angel that I squeezin'
She ain't been mean to me

[Chorus]
O Deanna O Deanna! O Deanna
You are my friend and my partner O Deanna
On this house on the hill O Deanna
And I ain't down here for your money
I ain't down here for your love
I ain't down here for your love or money
I'm down here for your soul

[Chorus]
(Oh Deanna) Oh Deanna (Oh Deanna)
Well you are my friend and my partner (Oh Deanna)
On this house on the hill (Oh Deanna)
And I ain't down here for your money
No, I ain't down here for your love
I ain't down here for your love or money
I'm down here for your soul

[Verse 4]
(Oh Deanna) Oh Deanna (Oh Deanna)
I am a-knocking (Oh Deanna)
With my toolbox and my stocking (Oh Deanna)
Well I'll meet you on the corner
Yes, you point it like a finger
And squeeze its little thing
I hear its kick, I feel its bang
And let's not worry about its issue
Don't worry about where its been
And don't worry about where it hits
Cause it just ain't yours to sin (Oh Deanna)
Cause it just ain't yours to sin (Oh Deanna)

[Verse 4]
O Deanna No it just ain't your to sin
O Deanna Sweet Deanna
O Deanna And we ain't getting any younger
O Deanna And I don't intend gettin' any older
O Deanna The sun a hump at my shoulder

[Chorus]
Oh sweet Deanna (Oh Deanna)
I ain't getting any younger (Deanna)
And you're my friend (Deanna)
The sun a hump at my shoulder (Deanna)
And I don't intend gettin' any older (Oh Deanna)
Oh Deanna (Deanna)
Well, I ain't down here for your money
I ain't down here for your love
I ain't down here for your love of money
I'm down here for your soul
