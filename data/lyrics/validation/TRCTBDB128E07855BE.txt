Silent night! Holy night!
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in Heavenly peace!
Sleep in Heavenly peace!

Silent night! Holy night!
Shepherds quake at the sight;
Glories stream from Heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia
Christ, the Saviour, is born!
Christ, the Saviour, is born!

Silent night! Holy night!
Son of God, Love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy Holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Lord at Thy birth
Jesus, Lord at Thy birth
