I've been running through this town
I've been combing every street
I've been searching for the reason within reasons
Been searching for the higher ground in me
And I've been trying to surrender
To trust in every word
All my days of misery
Someone could have taken them from me

So tell me where you are
Tell me how you feel
Tell me what you need
Just tell me how you feel
And let it all just rain on me
Let it all just rain on me
Let it all just rain on me....
Rain down on me

If only for a day
Oh if only for one night
I could tell you this is everything that i have ever lived for
But I'd be giving it all away
So look into these eyes
And tell me how you feel
All my days of misery, someone could have taken them from me

So tell me where you are
Tell me how you feel
Tell me what you need
Just tell me how you feel
And let it all just rain on me
Let it all just rain on me
Let it all just rain on me...
Rain down on me

So tell me where you are
Tell me how you feel
Tell me what you need
Just tell me how you feel
And let it all just rain on me
Let it all just rain on me
Let it al just rain on me...
Rain down on me
Yeah yeah yeah-ah-ah...
