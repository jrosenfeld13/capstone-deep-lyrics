Everyday I live in pain
This whole situation has gone insane
Exit stage left when the way is clear
But nothing's right and no one's near
As my soul creeps towards the flame of the unholy
Oh, what a shame!
The black gets darker, the world gets bluer
My peace of mind gets fucking greyer

You breathe not air but the scent of the kill
If follows your ass like a shadow of guilt
Truth lies with whatever you find
Yet clouds your vision like you are blind

You fell to your knees as you wept
Tears unworthy of being kept
Confusion: the only state of mind to live by
With understanding
