All men, all men are liars
Their words aint worth no more than worn out tires
Hey girls, bring rusty pliers
To pull this tooth
All men are liars and thats the truth

Well do you remember Rick Astley?
He had a big fat hit it was ghastly
He said Im never gonna give you up or let you down
Well Im here to tell you that dicks a clown

Though he was just a boy when he made that vow
I bet it all that he knows by now

All men, all men are liars
Their words aint worth no more than worn out tires
Hey girls, bring rusty pliers
To pull this tooth
All men are liars and thats the truth

Among Gods creatures man must be
The most slimy and slippery now
There stands the naked ape in a monkey suit
Behind the little moustache he grew, a shifty brute

All the ones start choking on the words they ate
Sweating on getting their stories straight

All men, all men are liars
Their words aint worth no more than worn out tires
Hey girls, bring rusty pliers
To pull this tooth
All men are liars and thats the truth

All men, all men are liars
Their words aint worth no more than worn out tires
Hey girls, bring rusty pliers
To pull this tooth
All men are liars
And all men are liars
All men are liars
All men are liars
And thats the truth
