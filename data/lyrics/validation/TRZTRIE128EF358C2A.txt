I came to see the end
But it already began
A lifetime of consequence unleashed in a moment
I rolled up on the end
With my dick in my hand
Where had the time gone and who are my friends
I came to see the end I saw it second hand
Unholy waters heaven sent to take the lamb
There comes a time my friend when you must defend
What you believe at least that's what they said

I wish that someone
Would stop me from driving into the sun
I hope that someone
Will be there when I crash and burn

I hear it's unhealthy to inhale methane through a hollow stick
But you'd eat a shit sandwich if you thought it would make you look slick
Down here we don't take unkindly to your metal debauchery
I came to see the end but it already began
I sat down with misery and we became friends
We rolled up on the end
Helluva time we all had
Now that we've been there we won't come back again
I hear it's unhealthy to inhale methane through a hollow stick
Although the motive is still suspect the outcome remains the same
The bleeding injustice you've unearthed smells of its disdain
