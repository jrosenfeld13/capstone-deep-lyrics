Love lifts me up
When I'm down at heart
And fills me with a hope that we can start
To change the way we feel
With just a glimpse
Of something real
Every night
We hold on tight
Love makes us strong

If your heart is right
You can't go wrong
You can't go wrong

When the world is wicked
And worse for wear
Love's the ticket
To anywhere
It's a journey deep inside
Lift you up into
The wild blue sky
A better life
Is clear in sight
So come along

If your heart is right
You can't go wrong
You can't go wrong

What a complicated
Work of art
This power driven thing
We call the heart
It runs on pure emotion
Stronger than a ragin' ocean
Heaven knows how it flows
On and on

If your heart is right
You can't go wrong
You can't go wrong

If your heart is right
You can't go wrong
If your heart is right
You can't go wrong
You can't go wrong
You can't go wrong
If your heart is right
You can't go wrong
