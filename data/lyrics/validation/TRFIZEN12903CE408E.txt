You never told me from the first time
I had to beg you not to leave
You never seemed to care the first time
Now is the last time you are walking out on me
Youve done enough for me to hate you
Expecting me to forgive you
I dont believe youll change
I dont know where I went wrong
You only want me when Im gone
Youre not that smart, youre not so strong
You only want me when Im
Gone
Its over, all over, so over
Youll never know
What does it take to make you believe?
How did we ever start?
You deserve a broken heart
Cry me a river were so through
People change and I forget you
The light dims and still you
Like a ghost that I cant shake
I feel so stupid when I look back
All the things that you lack
Reflected onto me
I dont know where I went wrong
You only want me when Im gone
Youre not that smart youre not so strong
You only want me when Im
Gone
Its over, all over, so over
Youll never know
What does it take to make you believe?
How did we ever start?
I dont deserve this broken heart
Cry me a river were so though
You never told me from the first time (You said you were my friend)
I had to beg you not to leave (I thought you were my friend)
You never seemed to care the first time (You never were my friend)
Now is the last time you are walking out on me
Its over, all over, so over
Youll never know
What does it take to make you believe?
How did we ever start?
I dont deserve my broken heart
Cry me a river were so thought
Cry me a river were so thought
Cry me a river were so thought
I cried and now Im over you
