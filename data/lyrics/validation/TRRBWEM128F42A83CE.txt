I'll take the lead you follow me
Come and relieve the friends that I keep
They're sick of me
Small minded creed blisters and weeps
Swallow the shit that jealousy feeds
And choke on it

And I may have a point to prove
I might just have a few enemies that I might just like to lose

I'll take the lead you follow me
Come and relieve the friends that I keep
They're sick of me
Come and relieve the friends that I keep
They're sick of me

And I may have a point to prove
I may just have a few memories that I might just like to lose

Here I stand with my tail between my legs
And I'm set to confess to these sins I didn't commit

Small minded creed blisters and weeps
Swallow the shit that jealousy feeds
And choke on it

And I may have a point to prove
And I might just have a few enemies that I might just like to lose

Here I stand with my tail between my legs
And I'm set to confess to these sins I didn't commit
No

It's all I have to say

Here I stand with my tail between my legs
And I'm set to confess to these sins I didn't commit
