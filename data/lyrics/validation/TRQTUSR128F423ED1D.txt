Too many answers for me today
I love you my brother but i need time away
The smell of my bedroom is all that i can take
Away from the voices, the choruses they raise

This is all you'll get
This is all i have to give
This is all you'll get
This is all i have

Eyes stare in the sink
Grandma she comes near
A pat on the back and a whisper that I cannot hear
Sit down, sit down you're getting weak kneed
Your tears are falling, they're falling slowly

This is all you'll get
This is all i have to give
This is all you'll get
This is all i have

So come on back we're waiting
Dressed for your arrival
Holding onto ribbons and bows
Threw them in the gutter
Said there was another
Darling won't you please come home
