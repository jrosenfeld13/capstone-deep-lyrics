Eruptions of fire and stone all around
They fill the air and shake the ground
And it's proving impermanence, the tortured
Landscape heaves
Nothing will be left alive

Bury my remains
Under ashes falling on my grave
Make me whole again
Give me the sight to see your ends
Bury my remains, cover up this body in decay
Make me whole again
Paint me on a brand new canvas

Not far from here, a place prepared
Can't find me way, send up a flare
Open the sky
Show me the way through twilight

Even now I see a spark in the distance
A flicker of hope for peace and silence
This span so hostile, won't last forever
This path through struggle will make me stronger
