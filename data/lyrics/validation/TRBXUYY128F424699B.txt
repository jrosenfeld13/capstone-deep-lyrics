[Verse 1]
It's time to fight
As one on the battlefield for every right
It's up to you to change someone's destiny
It's time to prove what you wanna do!

[Bridge]
I can see a burning flame
That light up lost gone souls
Somewhere is a spark of life
That leads towards our goal

[Chorus]
We're marching for freedom
Stand for one kingdom
Follow the wisdom, all true at heart
Gather all forces, from long distant courses
Stronger then ever, all true at heart

[Verse 2]
I have a dream
To see all the people of our world be free
We'll live as one, our enemies forces
Will be on the run, the future is here

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
[Solo]

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
