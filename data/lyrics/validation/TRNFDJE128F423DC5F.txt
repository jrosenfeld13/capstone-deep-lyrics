[Verse 1]
Open up your eyes
Take the devil from your mind
He's been holding on to you
And you're so hard to find
The wind outside is cold
Restless feeling in my soul
Tempting me to get away
But there's no place a man can go

[Chorus]
God, will you lead me where i roam?
Help me not to let my feelings show
No, no you are the one, oh, how could you be
So blind?

[Verse 2]
The devil prays on runaways
He's never far behind
The many years i've tried
Now have been revealed to me
Closer is the love you'll find
Waiting so patiently

[Chorus]
God, will you lead me where i roam?
Help me not to let my feelings show
No, no
Take the devil
Take the devil
From your mind
