[Verse 1]
Fat man looking in a blade of steel
Thin man looking at his last meal
Hollow man looking in a cotton field
For dignity

[Verse 2]
Wise man looking in a blade of grass
Young man looking in the shadows that pass
Poor man looking through painted glass
For dignity

[Verse 3]
Somebody got murdered on New Years Eve
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave
I went into the city, went into the town
Went into the land of the midnight sun

[Verse 4]
Searching high, searching low
Searching everywhere I know
Asking the cops wherever I go
Have you seen dignity?

[Verse 5]
Blind man breaking out of a trance
Puts both his hands in the pockets of chance
Hoping to find one circumstance
Of dignity

[Verse 6]
I went to the wedding of Mary Lou
She said, I dont want nobody see me talking to you
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew
About dignity

[Verse 7]
I went down where the vultures feed
I wouldve gone deeper, but there wasnt any need
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
Wasnt any difference to me

[Verse 8]
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade
House on fire, debts unpaid
Gonna stand at the window, going to ask the maid
Have you seen dignity?

[Verse 9]
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors
Looking into the lost forgotten years
For dignity

[Verse 10]
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues
Said hed give me information if his name wasnt used
He wanted money up front, said he was abused
By dignity

[Verse 11]
Footprints running across the silver sand
Steps going down into tattoo land
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
In the border towns of despair

[Verse 12]
Got no place to fade, got no coat
Im on the rolling river in a jerkin boat
Trying to read a note somebody wrote
About dignity

[Verse 13]
Sick man looking for the doctors cure
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
And into every masterpiece of literature
For dignity

[Verse 14]
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin
Bites the bullet and he looks within
For dignity

[Verse 15]
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed
Dignity never been photographed
I went into the red, went into the black
Into the valley of dry bone dreams

[Verse 16]
So many roads, so much at stake
So many dead ends, Im at the edge of the lake
Sometimes I wonder what its going to take
To find dignity
