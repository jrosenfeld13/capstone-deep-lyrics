My sweetheart is a soldier
As handsome as can be
But suddenly they sent him
Away across the sea

So patiently I waited
Until his leave was due
Then wrote and said "My darling
I'll tell you what to do"

Come to the station
Jump from the train
March at the double
Down lover's lane
Then in the glen where the roses en-twine
Lay down your arms (Lay down your arms)
Lay down your arms and surrender to mine

A soldier is a soldier
And when he's on parade
An order is an order
And has to be obeyed

You've got to do your duty
Wherever you may be
And now you're under orders
To hurry home to me

Come to the station
Jump from the train
March at the double
Down lover's lane
Then in the glen where the roses en-twine
Lay down your arms (Lay down your arms)
Lay down your arms and surrender to mine

The girl who loves a soldier
Is either sad or gray
'Cause first of all he's with her
And then he's far away
But soldiers have their duty
To answer to the call
And that is why I'm calling
The loudest of them all

Come to the station
Jump from the train
March at the double
Down lover's lane
Then in the glen where the roses en-twine
Lay down your arms (Lay down your arms)
Lay down your arms and surrender to mine
