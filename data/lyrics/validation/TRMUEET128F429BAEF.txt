Here she comes with summer in her heels
You can meet her at the station to escape for a day
She wants to know existence exists
So you take her to the places that the tourists never see
You lift her up, and feel yourself fall
You feel so proud beside her
You walk a little taller
She's a beatific vision
The world can see
She's got you tongue-tied
Got your heart skipping beats

I don't know what she's got, but it's got me
I don't know what she's got, but it's got me

You meet alot of women rambling around
I can tell you in my life she's the best I've found
You walk together through the lanes ans the parks
Wrap her in the evening 'til the stars come out
Lie back, forget all your cares
Beside her all that matters is the two of you are there
She says, "The afterlife is what you leave behind
I'm gonna leave alot fo footprints
Gonna take alot of time."

I don't know what she's got, but it's got me
I don't know what she's got, but it's got me

If ever there was blessing in the air, it was right there
If ever there was blessing in the air, it was right there

Beatific visions
Entwined in one another
There she goes with summer in her heels
