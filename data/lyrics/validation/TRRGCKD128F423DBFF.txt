I don't know just where I'm going
And tomorrow it's a little overwhelming
And the air is cold and I'm not the same anymore
I've been running in your direction for too long now
I've lost my own reflection
And I can't look down if you're not there to catch me when I fall

If this is the moment I stand here on my own
If this is my rite of passage that somehow leads me home
I might be afraid but it's my turn to be brave
If this is the last chance before we say goodbye
At least it's the first day of the rest of my life
I can't be afraid 'cause it's my turn to be brave

All along all I ever wanted
Was to be the light when your life was daunting
But I can't see mine when I feel as though you're pushing me away
Well, who's to blame?
Are we making the right choices?
'Cause we can't be sure if we're hearing our own voices
As we close the door even though we are so desperate to stay

If this is the moment I stand here on my own
If this is my rite of passage that somehow leads me home
I might be afraid but it's my turn to be brave
If this is the last chance before we say goodbye
At least it's the first day of the rest of my life
I can't be afraid 'cause it's my turn to be brave

And I might still cry
And I might still bleed
These thorns in my side
This heart on my sleeve
And lightning may strike this ground at my feet
And I might still crash
But I still believe

This is the moment I stand here all alone
With everything I have inside everything I own
I might be afraid but it's my turn to be brave

If this is the last time before we say goodbye
At least it's the first day of the rest of my life
I can't be afraid it's my turn to be brave
