There are times
You live as if in a dream
Drawn by your heart to a distant door
One that opens
For a moment
To a world that you've never known before

Were you real
Or were you part of a dream
Calling to me from across the floor?
In your sweet voice
There was music
And we danced the bolero de amor

Let the drums carry us away!
They say all there is to say
And all too soon the night becomes the day
And magical - miracle

You are real
And we are living a dream
Sharing a love we have hungered for
Let your passion soar like music
In the spell of bolero de amor

The drums carried us away
They said all there was to say
And all too soon the night became day
And magical-miracle

There are times
You live as if in a dream
Drawn by your heart to a distant door
Trust your heart and
Take the moment
When you hear
Your bolero de amor
Amor
Amor!
