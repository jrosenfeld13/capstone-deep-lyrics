Start of the year and we're drinking beer
Stinking hot day ain't strange down here
It's summertime in the sunburnt land
There's nothing like kicking back and having a can
Or watching the cricket with me mates
Or barbecuing snags on the greasy hot plates
Watch out for the mozzies coz it's getting late
Did someone pack the Aeroguard for gods sake

This is summertime in Australia
This is summertime in Australia

Heading to the beach to cool down
Or just to throw the frisbee around
Music festivals every week
Daylight saving means the sun don't sink
And listening to the top 100 on Australia Day
It's our day done the Aussie way
Just hanging out with all my friends
It's days like these I wish would never end

This is summertime in Australia
This is summertime in Australia

Middle of the year and the footy's here
Another good reason to drink more beer
The rain is falling and the wind is blowing
Someone better have the fire going
And head up to the mountains and hit the slopes
The snow is where it's at when it's below zero
Breathing in the cool fresh air
Just living my life without a care

Oh this is winter
Winter in Australia
This is winter in Australia

Coz I'm so lucky to live in the land
Surrounded by all this water and sand
I'm a proud Aussie and this is how I'll show it
So please help me sing this song if you know it

It goes
Aussie Aussie Aussie
Oi Oi Oi
Aussie Aussie Aussie
Oi Oi Oi
Aussie Aussie Aussie
Oi Oi Oi

Aussie Aussie Aussie
Oi Oi Oi
Aussie Aussie Aussie
Oi Oi Oi
Aussie
Oi
Aussie
Oi
Aussie Aussie Aussie
Oi Oi Oi

This is life in Australia
This is life in Australia
This is life in Australia
This is life in Australia
