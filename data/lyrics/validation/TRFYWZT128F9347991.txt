I know girls like you
Need someone to screw
Up you're life
And make you contemplate suicide
When you need a friend to blah blah blah blah
Call on me, yeah
You need someone bad to irritate your dad
Someone who'll make you cry
And sock you in the eye
When you need a friend to bring you to your knees
Call on me, yeah
Am I crazy enough
Am I angry enough
Am I stupid enough
Am I lazy enough
Am I drunk enough
Do I flunk enough
Am I jealous enough
Am I selfish enough
To be your bridge under troubled water
Yeah
You like pain, you're insane
You can keep my car
And punch my face in the bar
With a blah blah blah blah blah blah
Call me, oh yeah
Am I crazy enough
Am I angry enough
Am I stupid enough
Am I lazy enough
Am I drunk enough
Do I flunk enough
Am I jealous enough
Am I selfish enough
To be your bridge under troubled water
Yeah
Am I boring enough
Am I snoring enough
Am I demanding enough
Un-outstanding enough
Am I bad enough
Mad enough
Am I bad enough
Wear plaid enough
Am I drunk enough
Smell like a skunk enough
Do i wank enough
Do crank enough
To be your bridge under troubled water
