Fallow drama
I'm listening for the fruit to fall, love
Baked in the footlight
Some buttermilk free love cult
Lady or the tiger
Our runaway summertime hit
Slather me with butter
Ring around the world ash pit

Out in the wide net
Skan and the owlkin
Know not where
Their next meal
Is coming from
Airliner fallopian juke
Open up wide
I'll lift you up
Tiger tail
And I just can't let it go
