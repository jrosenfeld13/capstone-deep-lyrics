Standing on the mountain, far as I can see
Standing on the mountain, just as far as I can see
Dark clouds above me, clouds all around poor me

Feeling low and weary, Lord, I've got trouble in mind
Feeling low and weary, Lord, I've got a troublin' mind
Everything just gets me, everybody's so unkind

Harvest time's coming and will catch me unprepared
Harvest time's coming and will catch me unprepared
Haven't made a dollar, bad luck is all I've had

Lord, how can I bear it, Lord, what will the harvest bring?
Lord, how can I bear it, Lord, what will the harvest bring?
Putting up all my money and I isn't got a doggone thing

I'm a weary traveler roaming around from place to place
I'm a weary traveler roaming around from place to place
If I don't find something this will end me in disgrace

Ain't got no mother, father left me long ago
Ain't got no mother, father left me long ago
I'm just like an orphan, where my folks is I don't know

Blues around my shoulder, blues all around my head
Blues around my shoulder, blues all around my head
With my heavy burden, Lord, I wished I was dead
