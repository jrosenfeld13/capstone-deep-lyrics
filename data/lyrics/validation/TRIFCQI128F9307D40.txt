Darling, are you dreaming?
Are you dreaming of me now?
Screaming, are you screaming?
'Cause it's such a nightmare now?

There must be, must be something else waiting for you, oh
There must be, must be something else waiting for you, oh

I can't keep on without you
I can't keep on without you

Leaving, are you leaving when I need you here the most?
I need you more than ever
All I have is your holy ghost, oh

There must be, must be something else waiting for you, oh
There must be, must be something else waiting for you, oh

I can't keep on without you
I can't keep on without you
Oh, without you

You paint my broken heart
Like some awful piece of art
And I watch my world as it falls down, around
But still I pray you will come back some day

I will keep on without you
I will keep on without you
I will keep on without you
Without you
