I used to think that love
Could never take a hold
Spin a line around me
It feels so natural
I'll give into you
Give into my needs
But clearly I'm not thinking too straight
Honest and true
I'm not really handling this
What else can I do
But surrender
Don't be tender
My heart's on the line
Don't be tender
Don't make me all
What can't be mine
I surrender
Don't be tender
My heart's on the line
Don't be tender
Don't make me all
What can't be mine
It's all so bittersweet
Your touch lingers on
Even after you're gone
There's no escape for me
I'll give into you
Give into my needs
But clearly I'm not thinking too straight
Honest and true
I'm not really handling this
What else can I do
I surrender
Don't be tender
My heart's on the line
Don't be tender
Don't make me all
What can't be mine
Do you miss me baby
Do you miss me baby
Do you love me baby
Enough to let me go
But surrender
Don't be tender
My heart's on the line
Don't be tender
Don't make me all
What can't be mine
But surrender
Don't be tender
My heart's on the line
Don't be tender
Don't make me all
What can't be mine
Do you miss me baby
Do you miss me baby
Do you love me baby
Enough to let me go
Do you miss me baby
Do you miss me baby
Do you love me baby
Enough to let me go
