Running Away this town's too dull for us to stay
Feeling the pinch and waiting on a seven year itch
Just trying to make some sense of it all
Hanging on a wide angled curve
Just hoping to see you there
You said you feel the same thing I swear
But swearing is not our game
High, high in the morning light
You sit and you wonder why
The air is cleaner than what we breathe
So run away with me
Run away
Wasting our day is not on our agenda babe
Needing you there, a sign, a wink, a stare to see that you'll be there for me
Just hoping to see you there
You said you feel the same thing I swear
But swearing is not our game
High, high in the morning light
You sit and you wonder why
The air is cleaner than what we breathe
So run away with me
Run away
