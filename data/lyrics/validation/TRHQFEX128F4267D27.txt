It's loud and clear
Your silence has been breaking your heart
Like no one hears
You feel you may have fallen too far
But even if
You don't know the right words to say

Pray
Sit back and watch the scenery change
Hold on to the promise that help is on the way
Pray

If you think
You're not good enough to receive
What you need
Have a little faith and believe
God is not
A stranger to the things you might say

Something beautiful
Your miracle
Is waiting on you
