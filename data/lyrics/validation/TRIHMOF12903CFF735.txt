My hands are shaking; head is spinning
No mistake, the end's beginning
Body's aching, I feel like breaking down
Looking left and searching right
The pressure mounting, my skin's too tight
Though I've made this bed, I'm not laying down
Next stop is heartbreak city
Get off this train of pity
And hang on - the worst is coming
Be strong - the walls are tumbling down
So long - your head's been numb but your heat's still beating loud
Tired of running, sick of fighting
Plug my ears for the truth is frightening
My will is bending, I'm on shaky ground
The more I plush, the further you go
As I'm pulled down by the undertow
I'm reaching out - please don't let me drown
Don't let me down
Next stop is heartbreak city
Get off this train of pity
And hang on - the worst is coming
Be strong - the walls are tumbling down
So long - your head's been numb but your heat's still beating loud
And I worry, can I make it on my own
End of story, let's write this book again
Next stop is heartbreak city
Get off this train of pity
And hang on - the worst is coming
Be strong - the walls are tumbling down
So long - your head's been numb but your heat's still beating loud
