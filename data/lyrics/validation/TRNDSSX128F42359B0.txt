You need a little light in your life
A safety net so you're not so blind
Like hidden torches in the paper rounds of old
And magazines so gently thumbed by landing lights
When you were young as the radio would talk you off to sleep
Although the arcades shine bright, they don't have the glow of the city lights
As they long to guide you home from time to time

Neon lights and screeching times
Swarm like moths to pier fires on the stretch about a mile from home
It seems a million miles away as we were are walking in the gaze
Of the green eyed monster on the banks of waterloo

Although the arcades shine bright, they don't have the glow of the city lights
And they long to guide you home, you've got to
Get out of this place, get out of this place
Get out of this place, while your still alive Sam

Take some time then soon repress the thoughts of walks in dungeness
And the lighthouse keeper as he keeps the boats at bay
Remembering this little light that shines in westcliff park Drive
A suburban lighthouse when you need to feel safe
The city tonight does not feel as warm as those winter fires
And its good to be home from time to time
