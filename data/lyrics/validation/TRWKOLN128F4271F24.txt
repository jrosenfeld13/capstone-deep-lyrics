Uh
Woo
Well, well

You're downhearted and confused
Because baby, you've been startin' to lose
Losin' out on everything you might try to do
Bad luck, fella, 's got a hold on you

Losin' your money, 'bout to lose your home
Done lost your woman and everything's wrong
Law of average plainly states that chances go around
But if you wanna know the truth about it
I'll tell you what's pulling you down, yeah

You got (bad luck, that's what you got, that's what you got), yes, sir
Bad luck (that's what you got, that's what you got), yeah
Bad luck (that's what you got, that's what you got)
You got bad luck, bad luck, ba-a-a-by

Played a number 'cause that number's hot
But the bookies get you for every cent you've got
Walk around in a daze with your pockets bare
Go to see your woman, and she ain't even there

Losing your rhythm and all your track of time
The more I think about it, I think you're 'bout to lose your mind
Some people call it jinx, some say, "It ain't my day"
But if you wanna know the truth about it
I'll tell you what's pullin' you way down

(Bad luck, that's what you got, that's what you got) Yes, sir
Bad luck (that's what you got, that's what you got), yeah
You got bad luck (that's what you got, that's what you got)
You got bad luck, bad luck
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad luck

Don't go away
Huh, woo, huh, huh
Yeah, yeah
One more thing

Law of average plainly states that chances go around
But if you wanna know the truth about it
I'll tell you what's pullin' you down
Down, down, down, down, down

(Bad luck, that's what you got, that's what you got) Yes, sir
You got bad luck (that's what you got, that's what you got), oh, yeah
You got bad luck (that's what you got, that's what you got), uh-huh
You got bad (bad luck, bad luck, bad luck, bad luck)
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad luck

(Bad luck, that's what you got, that's what you got) Bad luck
No more bad luck (bad luck, that's what you got, that's what you got), bad luck, children
Bad luck (Bad luck, that's what you got, that's what you got), bad luck
You got bad luck, bad, bad (bad luck, bad luck, bad luck, bad luck)
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad luck

(Bad luck, that's what you got, that's what you got) You ain't got your baby
(Bad luck, that's what you got, that's what you got) And all the stars
(Bad luck, that's what you got, that's what you got) The stars, they shout it out
(Bad luck, bad luck, bad luck, bad luck) I can't get away from this bad luck

Bad luck, bad, bad

I wanna get away but I can't keep myself
'Cause I got bad luck
Bad luck, y'all
Children, say with me, "Bad luck"
Everybody's got bad luck, bad luck, bad luck

(Bad luck, that's what you got, that's what you got)
(Bad luck, that's what you got, that's what you got)
(Bad luck, that's what you got, that's what you got)
(Bad luck, bad luck, bad luck, bad luck)

(Bad luck, that's what you got, that's what you got) Mm-mm-mm, yeah
(Bad luck, that's what you got, that's what you got) Yeah
(Bad luck, that's what you got, that's what you got) Ha ha, yeah, yeah, I got it
(Bad luck, bad luck, bad luck, bad luck) Come on, come on

Doggone, uh, woo
People of the world out there
I know none of y'all satisfied, satisfied
The way prices have been goin' up on things
On that I say I'm just mad about mornin' paper, yeah

And cut down on smokin' (cut down on smokin')
And cut down on drinkin' (cut down on drinkin')
'Cause early one mornin', I got me a paper
I sat down on my living room floor
Opened it up (opened it up)
Opened it up (opened it up)
Guess what I saw?

I saw the President of the United States
The man said he was gonna give it up
He's given these high hopes
But he still turned around
And left all us poor folks behind

They say they got another man to take his place
But I don't think they need to satisfy the human race
Bad luck, bad luck, bad luck
Hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah

The only the thing that I got, that I can hold on
Is my God, my God, Jesus, be with me, Jesus
Give me good luck, good luck, help me, Jesus
