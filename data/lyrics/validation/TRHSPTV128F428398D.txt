Hey, listen
To my story 'bout a gal named Daisy May
Lazy Daisy May

Her disposition
Is rather sweet, and charming
At times, alarming
So they say

Do do do do do doo doo doo
Do do do do do doo doo doo

She had a man tall, dark and handsome
Large and strong
To whom she used to sing this song

Hey, Daddy
I want a diamond ring
Bracelets, everything
Daddy
You oughta get the best for me

Hey, Daddy
Gee, won't I look swell in sables
Clothes with Paris labels
Daddy
You oughta get the best for me

Here's an amazing revelation
With a bit of stimulation
I'd be a great sensation
I'd be your inspiration

Daddy
I want a brand new car
Champaigne, caviar
Hey, Daddy
You oughta get the best for me

Here's an amazing revelation
With a bit of stimulation

I'd be your inspiration

Daddy

Champaigne, caviar
Daddy
You oughta get the best for me
