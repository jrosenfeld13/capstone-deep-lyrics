I think about you
I think about me
I think about love, oh yeah
How I want it to be

When I think about love
I never wait
Dinner for two, me and you
I'll get ya home by eight, yeah

All I wanna do
Is to make it with you
All I wanna say
That I just can't wait

Talk about me
I'm a sign of the time
Gotta life kicking in
Hangin' out I'm in overdrive

Think about love
Give it what I got
My sights on you
Ooh, baby shoot, shoot, oh yeah

All I wanna do
Is to make it with you
All I wanna say is baby

Chorus: I will be, I'll be your man in motion
I want you, I want you all night long
I will be, I'll be your man in motion

Think about you
Cold steel in your eyes
Need it so bad, oh yeah
Gonna dress you up and take you for a ride

When I'm next to you
Call it love
Call it passion
Call it anything just call me to you

All I wanna do
Is shake it with you
(Shake, shake, shake)
All I wanna say is baby

(Repeat Chorus)
All I wanna do
Is shake it with you
All I wanna say is baby

(Repeat Chorus x2)
