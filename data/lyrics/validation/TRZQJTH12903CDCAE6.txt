(She was) peace in the madness like the eye of a storm
Overwhelmed by attraction, if not for this, what for?
Surrounded by desire, this is all I'll ever need
I should have known this could not go further than my dreams

I thought that love had found me
Dear God, its so deceiving

I have tried to understand why fate brought me such beauty so late
Looking past the safety
Can you answer why your love can't be mine

Closely reading your eyes
I'm starting to believe that somewhere in the complex
I am the one you need
An image of perfection
How could it ever be?
I should have known this could not go further than our dreams

It's dangerous
The blade is double-edged
You will be cut no matter what in subtle, silent romance

Looking at the safety, now I see why your love can't be mine
