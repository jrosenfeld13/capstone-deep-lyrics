[Verse 1]
Slow down, lie down
Remember it's just you and me
Don't sell out, bow out
Remember how this used to be

I just want you closer
Is that alright?
Baby let's get closer tonight

[Chorus]
Grant my last request
And just let me hold you
Don't shrug your shoulders
Lay down beside me
Sure I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there
Lay down beside me

[Verse 2]
Oh, I've found, that I'm bound
To wander down that one way road
And I realise all about your lies
But I'm no wiser than the fool I was before

I just want you closer
Is that alright?
Baby let's get closer tonight

[Chorus]
Grant my last request
And just let me hold you
Don't shrug your shoulders
Lay down beside me
Sure I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there
Lay down beside me

[Bridge]
Oh, baby, baby, baby
Tell me how can, how can this be wrong?

[Chorus]
Grant my last request
And just let me hold you
Don't shrug your shoulders
Lay down beside me
Sure I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there
Lay down beside me
Grant my last request
And just let me hold you
Don't shrug your shoulders
Lay down beside me
Sure I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there
Lay down beside me

Yeah, lay down beside me

[Outro]
One last time let's go there
Lay down beside me
