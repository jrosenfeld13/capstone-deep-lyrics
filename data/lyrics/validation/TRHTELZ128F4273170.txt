Well, I want to paint your picture
With that great look in your eyes
And I want to write a song so gentle
It could make you cry

I want the world and all it's charms
And nothing else will do
And, hey, I want you

Well, I want a roaring city
And I want a healing sun
And I want a magic wilderness
Where we could be as one

I want the world and all it's charms
And nothing else will do
And, hey, I want you
I want you

Well, I want to be your soldier
And I want to be your friend
And I want to be your dancing fool
And dance you till the end

I want the world and all it's charms
And nothing else will do
And, hey, and, hey
Hey, I want you
I want you
