Dust on the bible
Dust on the holy word
The words of all the prophets
And the sayings of our Lord

Of all the other books you'll find
There's none salvation holds
Get that dust off the bible
And redeem your poor soul

I went into a home one day
To see some friends of mine
Of all the books and magazines
Not a bible could I find

I asked them for the bible
When they brought it what a shame
For the dust was covered o'er
It not a fingerprint was plain

Dust on the bible...

You can read your magazines
Read of love and tragic things
And not one verse of Christian
Not one verse do you know

When it is the very truth
And its contents good for you
Dust on the bible
Will doom your poor soul

Dust on the bible...
