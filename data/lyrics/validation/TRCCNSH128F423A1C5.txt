We've been waiting all our lives
For things we've always had but have no eyes to see
Something new is going to happen
The most natural thing but nothin' we'd expect

All these buildings and mountains
Slowly they'll arise
Before our eyes

How do cities understand
We drink our wine and wonder why we're really here
What's the point of even asking
You take the good and bad and make the best of it

All these buildings and mountains
Slowly they'll arise
Before our eyes

All these buildings and mountains
Slowly they'll arise
Before our eyes

Have you watched the cities move?
Does nature fall before this age of industry?
For today I'll let it go
You've been good to me
Have I been good to you

All these buildings and mountains
Slowly they'll arise
Before our eyes

All these buildings and mountains
Slowly they'll arise
Before our eyes
