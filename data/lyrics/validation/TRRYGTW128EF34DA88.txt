I serve you wild and full of grace, you see it written on her face
You know they lock her door from the outside
A subtle smile you couldn't place 'cause it was slapped off of her face
Whose patience then is it that's being tested?

No harm
There's no harm done
Besides, there's no harm
There's no harm done

I wonder how you coexist, this place they'd better get dismissed
If she is not the one who sees things that way
They've said it once, they'll say it again, will this frustration ever end?
Time and time again, they say you did this

No harm
There's no harm done
Besides, there's no harm
There's no harm done

It seems so never-ending, I'm tired of compromising you
Your praise is condescending, who ends up sacrificing all
I put in all this effort, I put in all this effort
And this is now or never, and this is now or never, oh

Leave me all alone, this is what I want
I could fend for us of carry on
Leave me all alone, this is what I want
I could fend for us of carry on

I wouldn't call it cowardice, these scars you wear, I will dismiss
As mere reflections of a girl whose hand did hide

There's no harm done, no harm at all, dear
There's no harm done
