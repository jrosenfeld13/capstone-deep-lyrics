Mmh...

I ain't asking you to keep no secrets
My reputation's already shot
Ain't asking you to commit treason
Just tell me if you like it or not
Like it or not, baby
That's the way I want it to be
Don't give me your heart and soul
My love is only skin deep

I'll give you my time and money
And I'll give you somewhere to sleep
Don't ask me for my heart and soul
My love is only skin deep
My love is only skin deep
My love is only skin deep

I ain't looking for no blue-eyed lover
That's what stole my baby away
I can see your eyes are darker than midnight
And that's the time that I want to play
I want to play, baby
That's the way I want it to be
Don't give me your heart and soul
My love is only skin deep

I'll give you my time and money
And I'll give you somewhere to sleep
But don't ask me for my heart and soul
My love is only skin deep
My love is only skin deep
My love is only skin deep
Yeah

Oh, I'll give you my time and my money
Now, I'll give you somewhere to sleep
Baby, don't ask me for my heart and my soul
Oh, my love is only skin deep
Baby, my love is only skin deep
Hey... don't even ask me, baby
Don't even ask me
Oh, baby
It's only, only skin deep, baby
