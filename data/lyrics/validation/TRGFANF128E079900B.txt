Should come snow
But we got rain and it's leaking in
I think of Paris
How that ugly tower stands 3 years of wind

Now don't it seem like we're living in a slowdown town
(Seem like we're living in a slowdown town)
I feel like we're living in a slowdown town
(Slowdown town)
And on and on it goes, on and on it goes

Billions of people be happy
Living like the way we do
With the world in our hands
Believing that we're small and true

But sometimes I feel like we're living in a slowdown town
(Feel like we're living in a slowdown town)
Yes, I feel like we're living in a slowdown town
(Slowdown town)
And on and on it goes

I'll be here and the wind and the rain will be
Hammering down the building over me
I'll be here in my tower of mistrust
I built this myself with nails that don't rust

Don't you feel like we're living in a slowdown town
Oh honey, I feel like we're living in a slowdown town
(Feel like we're living in a slowdown town)
So people, come on, let's just blow it
And get out of this damn town
Or on and on it goes
(Feel like we're living in a slowdown town)
Or on and on it goes
(Feel like we're living in a slowdown town)
Or on and on it goes
