A bad mistake, a crying shame
Get caught playing a damn fools game
A bad mistake, a crying shame
Get caught playing a damn fools game

Oh, yeah now ... yeah now

Listen, stop and think about what you want to do
Then take a good look about looking in good to you?
Oh, think real hard about what it is you see
Is that really where you want to be?
(Broken heart, alone)
See what's going on
It's a fools game

And if you rep and dealing on the street
When your mind and body and soul ain't what you treating
Gotta good brain, better use it if you can, yeah
Don't allow yourself to be dragged down by the man

Awww, now there's a law of the jungle
And there's a law of the land
You're caught in the middle
You're just trying to make it the best you can

Oh, it's a fools game
(Fools game)
The city
(It's damn fools game)
It's a fools game
(Fools game)
Yeah, it's a damn fools game
(Damn fools game)

A bad mistake, a crying shame
Get caught playing a damn fools game
A bad mistake, a crying shame
Get caught playing a damn fools game

(Piano solo)
(Guitar solo)

Awww, there's a law of the jungle
And there's a law of the land
That you're caught in the middle of
You're trying to make it the best you can

It's a fools game
