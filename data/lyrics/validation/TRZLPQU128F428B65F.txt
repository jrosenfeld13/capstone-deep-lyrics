Hey little girl, where are you going
I know I have to change or you're gonna leave
But hey little girl, my love's still growing
Is there something I can do to make you believe?

I don't wanna lose you
Cos' I'm stuck on you like glue
I don't wanna lose you
Why don't we start out something new

Hey little girl, what game are you playing
Can you show me to the place where I can learn those rules
Hey little girl, I just hope you're staying
I really don't know why you have to be so cruel

I don't wanna lose you
Cos' I'm stuck on you like glue
I don't wanna lose you
Why don't we start out something new

Why don't you stay with me baby
I'll do anything you want me to
I'll be down on my knees
I'm begging you please
Let me stay forever with you

I don't wanna lose you
I don't wanna lose you
I don't wanna lose you
I don't wanna lose you
Why don't we start out something new
