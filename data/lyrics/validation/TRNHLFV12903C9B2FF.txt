You either live it up or don't live it down
Keep your head in the clouds, your ear to the ground
You're either lost in the narrows or being found
You either pay with your life or pay by the pound

There's no time, there's no time for someone to save you
There's no time, there's no time
All the world ain't waiting for you to finally come around

You either live it up or don't let it go
You're either in with the in or out of the no

There's no time, there's no time for someone to save you
There's no time, there's no time
All the world ain't waiting for
There's no time, there's no time for someone to make you
Make you finally come around

What a life, what a lie
We're living here on borrowed time
And life's what happens in between the planning and the scheme
You either live it up
(When the cracks split in the road)
Or you don't live it up down
(Are all you've seen)
You either live it up
(When the cracks split in the road)
Or you don't live it down
(Are all you've seen)
So don't be giving up
(When the cracks split in the road)
Or let it bring you down
(Are all you've seen)
Or let it bring you down
(When the cracks split in the road
Are all you've seen)
