Just get over here, yeah, yeah
I want somebody
(Over here)
Only thing I want
(Over here)

Please get over here
Get here
Please get over here
Get here
Please get over here

I need somebody
To comfort me
Cause you're no here no more

I know I'll make it
Oh, I need to hold you get over

I ain't had enough without you
So get over here
Come over
I just want to hold you

I need you to love you
I wanna hold you
I need you to love you
I think I can make it feel just a little better
I need you to love you
