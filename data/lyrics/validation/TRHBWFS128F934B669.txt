In Times that past they set the stone to reach the crown conquer the throne, pain submersed in innocent blood
The wars of cultures in the mud
Striving for power in past days increasing influence lead to decays
All that's left are broken bounds sabred down freedom's head
You took their blood, You took their souls You took their pride you took their children
Burning bridges between brothers torn apart by written letters expropriation of the unborn, generations to the chains
Striving for power in past days increasing influence lead to decays
All that's left are broken bounds sabred down freedom's head
You took their blood, You took their souls You took their pride you took their children
You - took - their - blood
This is a call to arms
Sabred down freedom's head
You - took - their - blood
