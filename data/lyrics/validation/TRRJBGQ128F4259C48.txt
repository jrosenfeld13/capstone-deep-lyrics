It builds up inside
Intensifies
Ready to explode
Contained within never not I

Anxiety
I shiver failing to hold it back
Reality
Drifting away
From conscience on my back
It's payback time
I'm punished for my life
Hurt by the stone
Cast by all I've ever met
Why must this happen all at once?
Suffocate my mind
Why must this happen all at once?
I feel, I feel I wanna

Die, go away
I can't handle it
Surrendering inside
Peel away my skin
Ready to say goodbye

Pushing me, pounding at me all at once
Feels as if... if I had a gun
I was told once before
I know I'd reach the end of forever
I know I got what's coming to me
Deserve the hell I'm in
Why must this happen all at once
I feel... I feel I wanna
