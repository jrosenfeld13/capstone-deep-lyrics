Little old man
Little old man staring down the road
Waiting on the bus
He's getting kind of cold

Bus finally gets there
He got nowhere to sit down
And the driver said, "You can stand right here behind me
O wait for the next one to come around"

And the old man says, "That's okay, I'll stand
I might look like a little old man to you
But I've been riding this bus for years and years and years
I don't even know where it's going to"

And the driver says, "You don't know where this bus is going to?"
Old man says, "No, I don't, do you?"
Driver says, "You don't know where this bus is going to?"
Old man says, "I just want it to get me through"

Hey, I'm staying on the ride
It's going to take me somewhere
Staying on the ride
It's going to take me somewhere
Somewhere, somewhere
Somewhere, somewhere

The bus is rolling along
Outside it's looking kind of strange
The Earth is shaking, the clouds are breaking
Everything is blue where it was grey

A thousand rivers flood
Over fields of snow
The driver looks back in the mirror for the old man
"Where did he go, where did he go?
Oh, there he is

Hey, old man, old man, old man
You still don't know?"
And the old man says, "No, I don't, son
But I'm happy to go"

Hey, I'm staying on the ride
It's going to take me somewhere
Hey, he said, I'm staying on the ride
It's going to take me somewhere
Somewhere, somewhere
Somewhere, somewhere

I was born with no name
Knowing nothing, still I don't
Somebody said, "You need a name, I'm going to give you a name"
And I said, "No, you won't," I said, "'No, you won't"

"You can let me off here, son
Thank you for the ride"
And the driver said, "This is the middle of nowhere, sir"
He pulls off to the side

And the old man says, "It might look that way to you
Maybe it is"
Old man says, "It might look that way to you, son
Maybe it is"

And he says, stay on the ride
It's going to take you somewhere
Hey, hey, he said, stay on the ride
It's going to take you somewhere
Somewhere, somewhere
Somewhere, somewhere

It always takes you somewhere
Going to take you somewhere
It always takes you somewhere
Got to take you somewhere
It always takes you somewhere
Going to take you somewhere
It always takes you somewhere
Going to take you somewhere
