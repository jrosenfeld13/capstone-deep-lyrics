It was your love
That brought me here
Seems I have aged
Beyond my years
()
Arcadian wives
I remember all of you
The feeling was still new
And you were so real
Arcadian sundown
It is still the same old town
Halfway up the hill and looking down
Some cut me loose
I ran away
Some I have loved
Up to this day
Sometimes I think
That my mistakes
Meant more to me
In many ways
()
Now I belong
With someone new
But all my dreams
Belong with you
