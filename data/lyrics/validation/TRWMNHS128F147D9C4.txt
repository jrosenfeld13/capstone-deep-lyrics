I'm crowded when I'm gone
I live here to seep through this song
Hey la
I can't go on
I'm lost
I'll be there turning on & off
Hey la

And when you reach that point
You're a wall
And when you bleed sight
You receive a call

Oh please take us
We're wrong
We live now to relive on & on
Place my paces
Pave my way
We only remain
The same way as the sounds on a tape

And when you draw a line
It goes where you want
And when shadows step ahead of you
They start & stop

With these riches we walk & walk
We give to this time all that we've got
We play it this way cuz this is how we feel
It means so much to me when the pretend becomes real
