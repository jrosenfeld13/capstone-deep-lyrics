[Verse 1]
Person to person and man to man
I'm back in touch with my long lost friend
Listen to reason and understand
And think of me from way back when
He said, me and Melissa, well we fell out of love
We ran out of luck seems like lightning struck
I've been thinking of leaving but I can't raise a buck
James, I'm wondering could I borrow your truck?

[Chorus]
I said that's why I'm here. Got no other reason
That's why I'm standing before you, that's why I'm here

[Verse 2]
John's gone, found dead, he dies high, he's brown bread
Later said to have drowned in his bed
After the laughter, the wave of the dread
It hits us like a ton of lead
It seems "learn not to burn" means to turn on a dime
And walk on if you're walking even if it's an uphill climb
And try to remember that working's no crime
Just don't let them take and waste your time

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
This is an IOU, I reckon I owe you one now
Listen Wendy and listen Gloria, this'll be better tomorrow
Fortune and fame's such a curious game
Perfect strangers can call you by name
Pay good money to hear fire and rain again and again and again
Some are like summer coming back every year
Got your baby got your blanket got your bucket of beer
I break into a grin from ear to ear
And suddenly it's perfectly clear

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
This is the part about Kitty and Jim
He loved her and she loved him
Wake them up shake them up the middle of the night
Got to tell me everything's alright

[Chorus]

[Outro]
He said that's why I'm here. That's right
