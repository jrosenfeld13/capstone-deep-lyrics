I tested your patience
Without you even knowiing
So i continued to throw words
Around carelessly
I knew how to get you off
Certain words
Evoked this beast from you
It was your carless eyes
That strayed away
Which brought forth
Your true feelings
Now tell me of the nights
When you pushed my patience
The thrusts of hormonal guilt
I suffer here
Your skin
Holds the image of his face
And your hair
Smells of compulsive lust
Now tell me
Was it worth it?
