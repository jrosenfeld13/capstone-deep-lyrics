I'm looking for a sign
To show me how
To cross the distance
And leave this all behind
I want to run
But there's no motion here
Just lifeless moments
Locked outside
And all that's left are tears
To cool the sun

Everything is gray
Tell me is there such a place

Where hearts are never broken
Dreams don't die
Souls are never searching
Crying out for a reason why
And love is everlasting
A place where there are no more fears
Far away from here

Will you reach out to me
Pull me through
A world of sorrow
To where I'm meant to be
From dark to light

Oh, where there is no more gray
Oh, tell me, please tell me is there such a place

I want to go far away from here
I want to go far away from here
I want to fly far away from here

Far away, far away
Far away from here

Dreams will never
Dreams will never die
Souls will never ever wonder why
And we will all be standing in the light
