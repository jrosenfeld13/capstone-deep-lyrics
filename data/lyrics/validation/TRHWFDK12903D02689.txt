In the middle of an island
In the middle of the ocean
You and I beneath the moonlight
With just the monkeys and the palm trees

In the middle of an island
When it's time to do some kissin'
Plenty time for lots a lovin'
And walkin' barefoot in the sand

Though there's no island at all
Just a picture on my wall
My darlin', how I wish we could be
(I wish that we could be)

In the middle of an island
In the middle of the ocean
You and I forever, darlin'
In a paradise for two
(In a paradise for two)

Though there's no island at all
Just a picture on my wall
My darlin', how I wish we could be
(I wish that we could be)

In the middle of an island
In the middle of the ocean
You and I forever, darlin'
In a paradise for two
(In the middle of the ocean on an island kissin' you)
