I try to hide it, I try to fight it
Think I'm losing control
Can't get over this, living out in the cold
No use concealing this crazy feeling
I try so hard to ignore
It's an obsession I can't hold inside anymore

It's desperation that's breaking me down
And I would do anything to be holding you now
It's desperation pulling me to the end
If I can't make you love me again

Listen to me, don't refuse me
My only chance to survive
You've got the only piece of my heart
That's still left alive
You hear me calling, see me crawling
There's nothing else I can do
Can't you see what my love is turning into?

It's desperation that's breaking me down
And I would do anything to be holding you now
It's desperation pulling me to the end
If I can't make you love me again

Hold me, hold me
Hold me, hold me, please let me love you again

It's desperation, that's breaking me down
And I would do anything to be holding you now
It's desperation pulling me to the end
If I can't make you love me again

It's desperation
It's desperation, pulling me to the end
If I can't make you love me again
