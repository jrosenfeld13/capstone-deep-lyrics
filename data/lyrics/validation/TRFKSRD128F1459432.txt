Never gonna miss it
The love I never had
Never gonna miss it
The love I never had
Never gonna miss it...

You've been coming home a little later
And you never feel like saying where you've been
You know I tried to make some conversation
But I guess the things I say are wearin' thin
You never needed me, I only see it now
But I can live alone, girl you taught me how
And I wish that I could say I'm gonna feel so sad
(gonna feel so sad)
But I just can't miss the love I never had

Never gonna miss it
The love I never had
Never gonna miss it...

When I was reachin' out you didn't want me
But at least I know I gave it one good try
(didn't I, didn't I give it one good try?)
Gonna pack my bags then I'll be leavin'
You don't have to stay around to say goodbye
Oh any fool can see it's over and it's done
It really ended girl, before it had begun
And I wish that I could say I'm gonna take it bad
Oh so bad, so bad
But I just can't miss the love I never had

(Never gonna miss it)
Oh and I wish that I could say I'm gonna feel so sad, so sad
(gonna feel so sad)
But I just can't miss the love I never had

Never gonna miss it...
The love I never had
