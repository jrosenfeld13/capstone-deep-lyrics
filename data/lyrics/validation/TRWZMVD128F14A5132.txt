One time I remember
That you were much better
Now you smoke and now you drink
I remember when you used to think

You lost it your legal
Those sweeping comments you
Taking pills and you contrdict
Comments you made before you backflipped
I hope you feel like you belong

Yeah just like you did before
Just another scenester fool
Just another fashion whore
We sure saw who stuck around

Morals walked on out the door
Now we see you at the club

Was it worth it
And you're grinding on your jaw
Feel like you belong
Turn your back
Was it worth it
Feel like you belong
Turn your back
Feel like you belong
Feel like you belong
Was it worth it, turn your back

One time I remember
That you were much better
I remember when you used to think
Now you smoke and now you drink
Yeah just like you did before

I hope you feel like you belong
Just another fashion whore
Just another scenester fool

We sure saw who stuck around
Morals walked on out the door
And you're grinding on your jawnow we see you at the club
