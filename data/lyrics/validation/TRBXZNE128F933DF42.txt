They said they'll miss me when i'm gone
I'm sitting & i'm gone
And i've been drinking
Belvedere & a couple shots
I remember who i was
& i miss him
Every time i'm on my tod
I get thinking
About the things that piss me off
& how i'm living
I just want to talk to god
& will he listen
Even though i'm doing wrong,i'm not a villian
And i know i make a lot of wrong decsions
I'll admit it
I'll admit it
I guess you get to see a lot with double vision
I just really want to stop these premanitions
I've invisioned
All the things i'm missing
It fucks with me that Wiggys gone
& i don't visit
Even though i know he's gone
He's here in spirit
I should of listened
I should of listened
When he use to phone me up
& take the piss
Tell me i was a prick & come a visit
I should of listened
I should of listened

But i'm tired fam
& its always 4 in the morning
I'm tired fam
I'm trying to put my thoughts to sleep
I've tried that
And its such a dark place
Where i'm at
Now i'm looking at these photos on my imac
& its bringing back some memories
I don't like that
I don't even know who that is
But i don't like that
I'm not like that
Anymore

They said they'll miss me when i'm gone

They said they'll miss me when i'm gone
And i've been drinking
Belvedere & a couple shots

They said they'll miss me when i'm gone

They said they'll miss me when i'm gone
And i've been drinking
Belvedere & a couple shots


I'm tired fam
& its always 4 in the morning

I'm tired fam
& its always 4 in the morning

& i'm tired fam

I'm tired fam
Its always 4 in the morning
& i'm tired fam

I've been drinking
Belvedere & a couple shots

I should of listened
(mumble)

It still fucks with me that Wiggys gone
I'm tired fam
Its always 4 in the morning

Its always 4 in the morning

Its always 4 in the morning
