You make yourself at home
In my zone
Leave my shit alone
Home alone
I got my kit
With bricks and clay
I built a fence
Keep you away

My territory
My territory
My territory
My territory

Clean up when you're done
Keep the mice out
Lock up when you run
Keep the night out
I pay my rent
To my country
But in my land
The lord is me

My territory
My territory
