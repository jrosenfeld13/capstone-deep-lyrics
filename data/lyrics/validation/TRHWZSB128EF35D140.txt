Polish the brass, Peggy
Look at the leaf on Mary's dress
She was lovesick when he left her
Cut your hair, Peggy
Bury the remnants of the past
Swallow the china
We both ate from

Oh lord, oh lord
If my eyes could speak""
Would you wash your
Holy water over me?

Put down the doll, Peggy
I know I treated you with less than respect
The weasel paid me
To let him love you
Slacken your tongue
Up to the time when Jesus spoke
Words so willful
They made you love me

Chorus

Shall we go
Leaving the gleaming brass behind
The fire burning
The winter turning?
Without clothes
Shall we collapse into Mary's dress?
The leaves are still wet
From Pilate's bloodshed

Chorus

Yes, yes, yes I will go, love
But not with you
Your cruelty calls you
To the lion's table
And I have gone
Into his belly and back again
You now, you love
You protect you.

Is this your voice
Leading me into the devil's hands?
Is this your wisdom
To leave me naked?
Well, lift your voice
So that the hounds of heaven may hear!
My soul is dangling
From your answer

Chorus

Lamb of God
Your fingertips are the mother of pearl
Your heart is the mountain
I break my hands on
Lamb of God
You take away the sins of the world
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on me
