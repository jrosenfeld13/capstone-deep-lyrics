Amoral prayers once besought
Breaking bounds, betrayal of the soul
Clearing out the heart to see the light
Forgiveness promise, concealed in lie

Processing life
Living decay

Beyond compute, the meaning of loss
At war with time, existence in exile
In defiance of revolt
No more regrets, we all shall fail
When brought to justice so much we learn
We are doomed to fail
Spiritual venoms blind to bliss

Processing life
Undo the progress of disease
Processing life
Undo the torment of belief
Processing life
Undo the torment
By processed life

Processing life
Living decay

Amoral prayers once besought
Breaking bounds, betrayal of the soul
When brought to justice so much we learn
We are doomed to fail
Spiritual venoms blind to bliss

Processing life
Undo the progress of disease
Processing life
Undo the torment of belief
Processing life
Undo the torment
By processed life
