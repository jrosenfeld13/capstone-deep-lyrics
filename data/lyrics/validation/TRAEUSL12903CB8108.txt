Another broken dream, they say all the time
Sorry if I can't be as you'd like to find
If we could only see
Things as they're meant to be
But we believe in dreams

Satisfaction - is it a dream
No distraction - is it a dream
No more fighting - is it a dream
No backbiting - is it a dream

Promises broken, it's an imperfect world
Harsh words are spoken though they weren't meant to hurt
If we could only see
Things as they're meant to be
But no, it's just a dream

Satisfaction - is it a dream
No distraction - is it a dream
No more fighting - is it a dream
No backbiting - is it a dream

Never losing - is it a dream
Freedom choosing - is it a dream
Never needing - is it a dream
No hearts bleeding - is it a dream
