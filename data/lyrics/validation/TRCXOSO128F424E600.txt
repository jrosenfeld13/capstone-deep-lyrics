At work your mouth stays firmly shut
While your boss asks for advice
Later at the bar behind his back you criticize

(chorus)
An armchair quarterback
You'll never have to lose
You'll never have to wipe the dog shit off your shoes
An armchair quarterback
Do you get those armchair blues?
---
When your girl asks what you like
You shrug, make it her choice
When she's not around you share her failures with the boys

(repeat chorus)
Instant replay
Perfect hindsight
In slow motion
You're always right
Watching life on tape delay
You know what happened yesterday

(repeat chorus)
Those armchair blues
