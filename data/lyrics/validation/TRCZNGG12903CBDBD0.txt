(*Dave Berg, Annie Tate, Sam Tate)
My hands are in my pocket
My pockets are full of change
Enough to buy some bait and gasoline
I head down the road where the road gets smaller
Next thing you know I am way back in a holler
And my lines in the water
Where the water runs deep
I can't help but to believe
I know where heaven is

(chorus)
Its a life full of days like this
Enough to make the devil smile and
Take a break for a little while
And walk away knowing my soul won't ever be his
Cuz I know where Heaven is
Got a fork in the pie
And the pie is homemade
Half the people here has got my last name
I am sitting at a table
The table is to small
Cuz two new cousins got born last fall
The tire swing is swinging out over the creek
Ain't no better place to be
I know where Heaven is

(chorus)
Its a life full of days like this
Enough to make the devil smile
Take a break for a little while
And walk away knowing my soul won't ever be his
Cuz I know where Heaven is
I dont need no directions
I dont need no map
I know I am in paradise
Wherever my heart hangs its hat
I know where Heaven is
Look around its hard to miss
Living proof that God exists
I know where heaven is

(chorus)
Its a life full of days like this
Enough to make the devil smile and
Take a break for a little while
And walk away knowing my soul won't ever be his
Cuz I know where Heaven
I know where Heaven
I know where Heaven is
Yes I Do
