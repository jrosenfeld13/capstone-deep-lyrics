A never ending painting
No subject defined
Not a precise style
Confused traits, poor colours

Are you really able to find a message?

Grow dim again
Defeated
Grow dim again
Grow dim again
To not graze this lying vision
To not admire the banal

Distantly glittering sides try to illude
Disturbing
No results again

Distantly glittering sides try to illude
Disturbing
No results again

I rove hearing the noise of false moves

Grow dim again
Defeated
Grow dim again
Grow dim again
To not graze this lying vision
To not admire the banal

Distantly glittering sides try to illude
Disturbing
No results again

Distantly glittering sides try to illude
Disturbing

Skimming transparent figures
Observing a pale and sober painting
I will deface it, enjoy the cut
