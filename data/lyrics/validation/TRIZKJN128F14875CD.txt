Left alone with shadows
This is when he smiles
Just as I get started
He repeats the ending
Sucking in his breath
As he holds me down
It occurs to me to pray
And I'm always ending
Yeah I'm always ending

What could I do? What could I do?
What could I do? What could I do?
Man sized boy -

Punish me with all his jokes
And I've got no smokes to spare
And I've got no room to breathe
And I've got no patience
Tapping on my chest to see
If I act scared or light or leave -
And then if I let him tap again
I will always be here -
Be all blasted open

What could I do? What could I do?
What could I do? What could I do?
Man sized boy -
I'm all blasted open

I've got hope for all the messes
Who are cold and blasted open
I got told, and I believe it
To repeat the ending
Left alone with shadows
This is when he smiles
Just when I got started
He repeats the ending
I repeat the ending
