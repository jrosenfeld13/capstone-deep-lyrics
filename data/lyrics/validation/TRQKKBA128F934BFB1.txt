You better think twice
About leaving me behind
Make up your mind
About what you're gonna do

You know it ain't easy
When your love hurts night and day
Oh, how you please
When I hear you call my name

Breathlessly I await the moment to surround you
Oh, do not fear the song that makes you sing
It will offer you wings to fly away
But do not expect to land if you can't stay

You better think twice
About leaving me behind
Make up your mind
About what you're gonna do

You take my advice
Oh woman, you've got to choose
Take a little time
You got nothing more to lose

In time, you know my melody will haunt you
Your words can make it rhyme so easily
It ain't no sin, when love is real
So come on and let me know just how you feel

You better think twice
About leaving me behind
Make up your mind
About what you're gonna do

You take my advice
Oh woman, you've got to choose
Take a little time
You got nothing more to do
