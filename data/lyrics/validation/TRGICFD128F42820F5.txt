In union with the Lamb
From condemnation free
The saints from everlasting were
And shall for ever be

In covenant from of old
The sons of God they were
The feeblest lamb in Jesus fold
Was blessed in Jesus there

Its bonds shall never break
Though earths old columns bow
The strong, the tempted, & the weak
Are one in Jesus now

When storms or tempests rise
Or sins your peace assail
Your hope in Jesus never dies
tis cast within the veil

Its bonds shall never break
Though earths old columns bow
The strong, the tempted, & the weak
Are one in Jesus now

Here let the weary rest
Who love the Saviors name
Though with no sweet enjoyments blessed
This covenant stands the same

Its bonds shall never break
Though earths old columns bow
The strong, the tempted, & the weak
Are one in Jesus now
