You're not who they say You are
They made You the enemy
(CHRIST-Jah flesh; CHRIST-light within; CHRIST-Beginning and the end)
Taken something so beautiful
Painted a new picture that makes me sick
(CHRIST-Witness; CHRIST-Living one; CHRIST-First and last)
Feed our minds confusion
Sweeten the taste of pollution
(CHRIST-Word life; CHRIST-Resurrect; CHRIST-Everlasting Jah)

Some people call You Father
Maybe You could set me free
These people hate each other
But You've always been there for me

I refuse to be like you
Without my life, caving in
(CHRIST-Jah flesh; CHRIST-Light Within; CHRIST-Beginning and the end)
I surrender, giving up all that is me
Yielding to you
(CHRIST-Witness; CHRIST-Living one; CHRIST-First and the last)
Shape me in my brokenness
Empower me forever
(CHRIST-Word life; CHRIST-Resurrect; CHRIST-Everlasting Jah)

Some people call You Father
Maybe You could set me free
These people hate each other
But You've always been there for me

Some people call You Father
Maybe You could set me free
These people hate each other
But You've always been there for me

Some people call You Father
Maybe You could set me free
These people hate each other
But You've always been there for me

I know You will complete this work started in me
I need You more than ever now that I know who You are
I know You will complete this work started in me
I need You more than ever now that I've come so far

I know You will complete this work started in me
I need You more than ever now that I know who You are
