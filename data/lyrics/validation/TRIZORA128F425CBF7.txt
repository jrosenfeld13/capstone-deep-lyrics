Roses whisper goodnight
Neath silvery light

Asleep in the dew
They hide from our view

When the dawn peepeth through
God will wake them and you

When the dawn peepeth through
God will wake them and you

Slumber sweetly my dear
For the angels are near

To watch over you
The silent night through

And to bear you above
To the dream land of love

And to bear you above
To the dream land of love
