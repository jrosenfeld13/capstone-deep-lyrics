Why am I so scared to be home?
Is it 'cos the streets don't know me anymore?
My heart will shake and my eyes will close
As I get out of this minor confused state
Confused state

They say I'm trying too hard

This is home versus home
A girl, a ghost and a telephone
Will indicate this is where you belong, belong

Start your point, and we'll check you out
Is it home that makes you scared to be alone?
My heart will shake and my eyes will close
As I get out of this minor confused state
Confused state

They say I'm out of my mind

This is home versus home
A girl, a ghost and a telephone
Will indicate this is where you belong, belong

I lost love, you lost your father
I know it doesn't compare
My heart and your despair
But, it's all part, of home versus home

I lost love, you lost your father
I know it doesn't compare
My heart and your despair

But, it's all part, of home versus home
But, it's all part, of home versus home
But, it's all part, of home versus home
