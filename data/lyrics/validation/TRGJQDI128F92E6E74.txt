Where the way of life is understood
Reins on horses
Led back too far to realize the fears in
Where the way of life is not understood

(Nadja Smith, in Newspeak)
Less than a month after Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev
Spoke about the need to turn US and USSR economies towards peace
Congress Ted Weiss introduced a bill that could create a cabinet level economic defense adjustment council that would assist communities that were affected by the closings due to military cutbacks
The economic adjustment cabinet calls for the establishment of labor and management committees, to develop detailed alternative uses for military bases and production laboratories, such as the Brooklyn Navy Yard
Communities affected by the closing would get one year in advance of the venue's closing and federal governments plans to close down a base or discontinue a defense contract

This would ease the military's worries about cutbacks in areas such as Long Island
(?) in other aerospace contractors
In addition, individuals in affected communities could eligible for adjustment benefits and training for peacetime employment
This plan would free our nation of the tyranny of jobs lacking
And the approval of military contracts
And allow us to pursue lasting peace without losing our commitment to increasing employment, says Weiss

It may be that war is no longer economically desireable

(Jeanne Lee)
Its the old shell game
You don't see what you'd thought you'd see
Used to fight one more
Since the next generation is on all of our lines, I wonder who the wire's for
Maybe there's a (?)
So its business as usual

(Scat Singing)

Wild sensation
Titallation
Entertains the entire nation
Government (?)
Double speak
Ambushed concepts of reality
Where is the informed citizen so vital to democracy?

(Peace Chorale II)
Only is the entangled web
Wanting is the bewilderment
Taking is the presentiment
Only is the contained content
