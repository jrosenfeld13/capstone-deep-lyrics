[Verse 1]
When I'm all alone
And no one else is there
Waiting by the phone
To remind me
I'm still here
When shadows paint the scenes
Where spotlights used to fall
And I'm left wondering
Is it really worth it all?

[Chorus]
There's a peace inside us all
Let it be your friend
It will help you carry on In the end
There's a peace inside us all

[Verse 2]
Life can hold you down
When you're not looking up
Can't you hear the sounds?
Hearts beating out loud
Although the names change
Inside we're all the same
Why can't we tear down these walls?
And show the scars we're covering

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
There's a peace
Oh there's a peace inside us all
Let it be... Oh, I said let it be, let it be your friend

[Chorus]
There's a peace inside us all
Let it be your friend
It will help you carry on In the End
There's a peace inside us all
There's a peace, inside us all, Inside us all
Let it be, Let it be, Let it be [x7]
Let it be your friend
