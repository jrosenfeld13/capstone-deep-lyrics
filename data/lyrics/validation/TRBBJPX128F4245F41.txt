Every now and then, the weather's fine
The sun shines, and i'm alright

Every now and then, my feet hurt
I'm itchin' all over, my heart aches

But when im in trouble
My heart is screamin loud, your name
When you're around
Everything's no more the same
You act as if i were the one, you're lookin for
You're the one that i adore, hug me

The sky is blue, my dream comes true
When i'm with you

Come on, grasp me, kick me, now caress me
Lick me, there's nothing i wouldn't do, for you
