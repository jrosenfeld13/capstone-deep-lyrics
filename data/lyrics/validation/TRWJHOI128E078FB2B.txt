Intro:
Ayo, yeah niggas
I'm talking to all y'all hard rock niggas
Let y'all niggas know that I understand
What niggas is really going through, ya understand?
Motherfucking down to they last cent
Smoking looseys
Thinking up shit to do, doing stick ups and shit
Busting at niggas, murdering niggas
Getting bullshit ass money
What if that was your peoples you murdering clown?
It's wild

Shout out to grandpa, you know what I'm saying?
Shout out to grandpa kelly
My man Ralou's brother little Devin
Ya know I'm saying, Freaky Taliq's moms, rest in peace
Know I'm saying?
Everybody wanna live the ill life, know I'm saying?
But yo we trying to live it like love, peace and nappiness
You know I'm saying? word up

Verse 1
I'm growing up in the ghetto
And there was nobody happy
And my head is mad nappy and
I'm thinking up a way that I can get some dough
Man I'm trying to blow
But yet this record shit is so slow
I got the whole family on my back
All I do is eat and sleep
Run the street with that ill pack
You know them Lost Boyz guys
With Timbs and jeans
Field jackets, and hats covering the eyes
But listen, that's how it is
If you don't dig how I live
Motherfuckas mind ya biz!
Cause everyday on the street
The black man is getting beat
Police line us up on the concrete
Now people look at me
And always see wrong
A new problem everyday
I'm trying to be strong
Now how strong can a nigga be
When the blacks is locked down
And the Wghite man's got the key
It's getting harder day after day
Somebody gots to pay
And in my closet lays an AK
A newborn is found dead
Plus money killed the girl
And put the gun to his own head
You never hear this on the 6:00 news
When my niggas get killed in the street over tennis shoes
It's hard as hell for us Blacks to earn cash man
The homeless keep warm by setting fire to a trash can
Now everyday I need ends
Newports, my nigga weed
St. Ides is my best friend
Pop's is broke
No calls coming in on my phone
And money I'm down to my last stone
My mom dukes is always banging on my door
My music's too loud
I got clothes on the floor (pick 'em up)
She doesn't understand
I'm cruising in the fast lane
I'm fresh out of nerves, Ma
You're working on my last vein
Now how can I explain
That I don't wanna take her out
But that's stuck in my brain
We're having fight after fight
Because I leave when it's bright
And come skunked up the next night
But that's the life that I live, understand me
It's bad enough that Po-Nine tried to can me
Ayo my lifestyle's rough
I got three sisters, four brothers
Man, 8 is enough
But yet I gots no hero
But I got the 4-1-1 on the ghetto
Tune into channel zero
Tune into channel zero
Tune into channel zero

Chorus:
Lalalalalala
Everybody in the world
Lalalalalala
Everybody Uptown
Lalalalalala
Everybody in Queens, bounce
Tune into channel zero
Lalalalalala
Everybody in Brooklyn
Lalalalalala
Everybody in the Bronx
Lalalalalala
Everybody in the world, bounce
Tune into channel zero

Verse 2:
I live in Queens, New York (and what you do?)
I twist a cap with my niggas
Smoke a blunt let's start to talk
About this ill situation
That us blacks is in
It's time we build a better nation
Motherfuck them police
Some whites talk about peace
Others treat us like beasts
But they ain't ready for the planet
Marky Mark be talking that slang
But he don't even understand it
Yea I said Marky Mark
Fronting like the buddah is sparked
I never seen you in the park
You gets awards for your bullshit skills, G
A White boy acting black, that shit kills me
Pants sagging, talking slang kid and all that
I never seen you in the project's hall, black
Ayo, I wants no Grammy
Ya whiteys gave Elvis a stamp
And what ya plan to give my man Sammy?

The Klu can get a Klan but the Blacks gets one month
And every year, what the fuck is that there?
Now you're best to disappear
The Black Planet is near
Four cops dismissed down in L.A.?
Now what the fuck are y'all telling me?
There's no justice, understand man, there's just us
The only time we stick together is when the Whites rushed us
Yeah, I'm beefing with you Blacks
Cause only on racial attacks is when we walk in packs
We need to stick together daily, understand?
Cause I got more reasons than Philip Bailey, man
Ayo, us Blacks need to get the facts right
Cause hey it's only right when the Whites see us Blacks fight
And in the street, niggas fight over concrete
To make ends meet
