Share your nights
And your dreams
Share your feelings
Deep as they may seem
Your words may disappear
If no one's there to hear

Two to tango
Two to move
And all we've got to do
Is see it through
As the day fades away

Two to tango
When the evening comes
And the rain goes
With the midnight sun
If you find your place
Leave behind the troubles that
You face

Two to tango
Two to move
And all we've got to do
Is see it through
As the day fades away

In a twist of fate
Time will rearrange
All your answers
Then the questions change
There beyond you or i can see
All that is and all that has to be

Two to tango
Two to move
And all we've got to do
Is see it through
As the day fades away
