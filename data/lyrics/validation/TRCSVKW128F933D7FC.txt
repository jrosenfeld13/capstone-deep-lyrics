She lives, no fear
Doubtless in everything she knows
Through time unchecked
The sureness of her flows
She leaves herself inside you when she goes

She lives in a time of her own...

You have always heard her speaking
She's always been in your ear
Her voice sounds a tone within you
Listen to the words you hear
Her time has no past or future
She lives everything she sees
Her time doesn't spin outside here
It's in every breath she breaths

She lives in a time of her own...

Her love whips hard
Like wind and stands in eager pain

She wins your thoughts
And drives your inner planes
She clears and shares
A love that never strains

She lives in a time of her own...

You have always heard her speaking
She's always been in your ear
Her voice sounds a tone within you
Listen to the words you hear
Her time has no past or future
She lives everything she sees
Her time doesn't spin outside here
It's in every breath she breaths

She lives in a time of her own...

Her eyes like light reflect the aura of her hair
She sends, attends, behind an alpha stare
She seeks the stars and spirals up their stairs

She lives in a time of her own
She lives in a time of her own
She lives in a time of her own
She lives in a time of her own
