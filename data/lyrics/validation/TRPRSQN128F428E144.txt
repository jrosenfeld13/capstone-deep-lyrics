Sweet obscenity
Bring her back to me
Lost in her perfume
Think i'm gonna sue
Sweet obscenity
Didn't i know it
Didn't i call her name
Stale cigarettes
Crumble in your fingers
Caught with a drink in my hand
Edging to the door
Sweet obscenity
Didn't i know it
Didn't i call her name
Tiger lily girl
Standin' cross-eyed in the corner
Tiger lily girl
Standin toungue tied in the corner
Somethin' in her eye
Tells that i should try
Somethin' she might say
Tells right away
Somethin' in her eye
Didn't i know it
Didn't i call her name
Tiger lily girl
Standin' cross-eyed in the corner
Tiger lily girl
Standin toungue tied in the corner
