Rock

You look to me with your resurrection eyes
A curse of truth that is longing for disguise
Now covered in scars unveiled by vanity
The bloody mirror's shattered, it's left it's mark on me

A march for the sick, starving for control
To the bastard's beat
Now shifting in shadows and crying for release
All life has surrendered crawling on it's knees
Covered in scars this curse of vanity
I have come to learn I traded diamonds for disease

A march for the sick, starving for control
Dying on my knees, starving for control
A march for the sick, starving for control
To the bastard's beat

Bring it down now,this loss must have it's reprisal
Master the arts of guilt and denial
Forgive the shameless, beg to remain nameless
And forever dwell with regret behind my eyes

Now shifting in shadow's and crying for release
All life has surrendered crawling on it's knees
Covered in scars this curse of vanity
I have come to learn I traded diamonds for disease

You look to me with your resurrection eyes
A curse of truth that is longing for disguise
Now covered in scars unveiled by vanity
The bloody mirror's shattered, it's left it's mark on me

A march for the sick, starving for control
Dying on my knee, starving for control
A march for the sick, starving for control
To the bastard's beat

Bring it down now, this loss must have it's reprisal
Master the arts of guilt and denial
Forgive the shameless, Beg to remain nameless
And forever dwell with regret behind my eyes
