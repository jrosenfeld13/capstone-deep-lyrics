Spoken:

This is one, um, that I used to listen to when I was a little, little kid
My parents had, um, this record and I'd listen to it over and over and um
I've been wanting to do this song for a really long time
Um, it's called Tall Trees In Georgia

Sung:

Tall trees in Georgia
They grow so high
They shade me so
And sadly walking
Through the thicket I go

The sweetest love
I ever had I left aside
Because I did not
Want to be any man's bride

But now I'm older
And married I would be
I found my sweetheart
But he would not marry me

When I was younger
The boys all came around
But now I'm older
And they've all settled down

"Control your mind, my girl
And give your heart to one
For if you love all men
You'll be surley left with none"

Tall trees in Georgia
They grow so high
They shade me so
And sadly walking
Through the thicket I go
