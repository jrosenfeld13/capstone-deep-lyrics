O holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Saviour's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth

A thrill of hope the weary soul rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees, oh, hear the angel voices
O night divine, O night when Christ was born
O night divine, O holy night

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
Become the wisemen from orient land

The King of kings lay thus the lowly manger
In all our trials, born to be our friend
He knows our need, to weakness is no stranger
Behold you the King, O night when Christ was born
O night divine, O holy night

Fall on your knees, oh, hear the angel voices
O night divine, O night when Christ was born
O night divine, O holy night

(Ooh) O holy night
(Ooh) O holy night
(Ooh) O holy night
(Ooh) O holy night
(Ooh) O holy night
