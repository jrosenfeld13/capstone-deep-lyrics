Flying high to the sky
You and me, flying high
Flying high to the sky
Come with me, flying high
Flying high to the sky
You and me, flying high
Flying high to the sky
Come with me, flying high
Flying is our game
It's like a high
Soaring through the
Clouds in the sky

[Chorus]
So come fly with me
Cause we're flying high
Flying high to the sky
Flying high through the sky
Flying is our game
It's like a high
Soaring through the
Clouds in the sky

[repeat Chorus]
Flying (flying) flying (flying)
Flying (flying) flying (flying)
Flying (flying) flying (flying)
Flying (flying) flying, baby
Flying is our game
It's like a high
Soaring through the
Clouds in the sky

[repeat Chorus]
Flying (flying) flying (flying)
Flying (flying) flying, baby
Flying (flying) flying (flying)
Flying (flying) flying, baby...
