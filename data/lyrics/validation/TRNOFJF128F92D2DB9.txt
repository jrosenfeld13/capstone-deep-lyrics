Starting now the wait is over
As long as you jump the ride
'cause I won't highway-walk forever
As long as you jump the ride

As long as you follow me
This is what I do, like I do
I've been on the ride before
It never stops at all
It never stops at all

You'll start your engines like a virgin
As long as you jump the ride
We'll cut the whip and lose the anchor
As long as you jump the ride

As long as you follow me
This is what I do, like I do
I've been on the ride before
It never stops at all
It never stops at all

As long as you follow me
This is what I do, like I do
I've been on the ride before
It never stops at all
It never stops at all

Don't you feel for us?
That we're on the round and round?
Don't you hear the endless motor sound?

As long as you follow me
This is what I do, like I do
I've been on the ride before
It never stops at all
It never stops at all
Never stops at all
