Remind yourself
That they are the ones who will hold you still
My thoughts exploding in thousands of pieces
(Thousands of pieces)
It looks so beautiful when
I know it's not love 'cause

I've been trying (As we are waiting)
I've been trying to let you know
So come close, this is who we are
Come on you show yourself
So come close, this is who we are
Come on you can be yourself again

When you notice yourself
As something more than just a reflection
You'll see it's not me
I guess I'm trying to say
I know it's not love, 'cause

I've been trying (As we are waiting)
I've been trying to let you know
So come close, this is who we are
Come on, you can show yourself
So come close, this is who we are
Come on, you can be yourself again

Now you've found love, it's shining through
Come close, this is who we are
Come on, you can show yourself
So come close, this is who we are
Come on you can be yourself again

Come close, and I will carry you
Come close, in my arms
