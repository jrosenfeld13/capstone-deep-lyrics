[Verse 1]

All stations from Waterfall to Bondi Junc
Last time it got there before the express - who woulda thunk?
A bunch of dudebros on the goon
By Hurstville they're already half drunk

[Verse 2]

Out at Town Hall, off they go to who knows where
One of them leaves a Subway wrapper on the chair
While the latest David Guetta single
Plays on some gronk's iPhone upstairs

[Middle 8]

She was standing on the platform
Thousand yard stare in her eyes
Thirty seconds on, the train pulled away
But there she stayed

[Verse 3]

A girl behind me on her phone asks a friend how she's doing
From what I can gather, the other night she fell asleep during
"Like is that even possible?"
Kings Cross my stop, finally there
