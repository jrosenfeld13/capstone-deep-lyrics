The factory fleshtones
The neon green lines
Either lovers or losers
A million meantimes

Darling I've fallen
But every bit hurts
The great open skies
Just make it seem worse

The blankets are beaten
The coffee's grown cold
A sweetheart complexion
That never seems old

Darling I've fallen
But every bit hurts
The great open skies
Just make it seem worse

The lonely days
The longest nights
The simple things
That make it right
The lonely days
The longest nights
The simple things
That make it right

Darling I've fallen
But every bit hurts
The great open skies
Just make it seem worse

Darling I've fallen
But every bit hurts
The great open skies
Just make it seem worse

Darling I've fallen
But every bit hurts
The great open skies
Just make it seem worse
