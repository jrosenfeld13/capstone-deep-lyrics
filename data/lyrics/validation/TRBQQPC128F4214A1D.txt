We all have dreams that we'd die to pursue
We all have things in our hearts that we try so hard to do
You sold your soul to the devil to spread your wings and fly
Now soon comes the rain - tear drops from angel eyes

Chase the rainbow to grab that gold
Traded in your soul for no one left to hold
All alone on a level, out of reach, so high
Fallen off the clouds - ain't' too proud to cry
The life you know got turned around
Up and down and up and down
'Til you hit the ground
Easy come, Easy go
Couldn't hang on to what you had before
Day by day...you lost your way
Innocence was sacred in your youth
Innocence got tainted when you lost sight of the truth
You live in a fantasy confused by big, bright lights
You can't tell right from wrong and you can't tell wrong from right

But everyday is a brand new day
Get back to your core and you might just change your ways
Cause when your fantasy falls before your eyes
Fallen of the clouds then you realize
The life you knew got turned around
Up and down and up and down
'Til you hit the ground
Easy come, Easy go
Couldn't hang on to what you had before
Day by day...you lost your way
Easy come, Easy go
Hang on to what you had before
That day...you lost your way
Day by day you lost your way
Forgot your roots, sold your soul, and said come what may
Now your back is restin' flat against the wall yeah, yeah
And we watched you fall
Easy come, Easy go
Couldn't hang on to what you had before
Day by day...you lost your way
Easy come, Easy go
Hang on to what you had before
That day...you lost your way...
