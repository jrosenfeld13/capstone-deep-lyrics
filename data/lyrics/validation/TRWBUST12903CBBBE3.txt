Whoa, whoa, oh, whoa

Baby, how can you win
If you give up on love?
For every tear that you cry
I'll sacrifice enough

Just try it again, let me in
Just follow me from here
Open your heart
I can turn it around

Where will you go
If in your heart you forget how to find love?
You'll never know if you don't give it a chance
You gotta prove your faith

Ooh, you're stuck and you know it, know it
Oh, girl, you're stuck and you know it, know it
You're stuck and you know it, know it
If you don't believe

I don't understand
Why should I take his name
Tell me how can I help
If you don't pass this blame?

Why do you pretend, you don't feel
How I feel inside?
When I see the truth
Every time in your eyes

Where will you go
If in your heart you forget how to find love?
You'll never know if you don't give it a chance
You gotta prove your faith

Baby, you're stuck and you know it, know it
Baby, you're stuck and you know it, know it
You're stuck and you know it, know it
If you don't, if you don't just believe

Just say you believe in me
Just like I believe in you
Baby, don't be afraid, be afraid of love

Tell me where will you go
If in your heart you forget how to find love?
You'll never know if you don't give it a chance
You gotta prove your faith

I can see that you're stuck and you know it, know it
Really could see that you're stuck and you know it, know it
You don't have to be, have to be stuck and you know it, know it
If you just believe, please don't give up on love
