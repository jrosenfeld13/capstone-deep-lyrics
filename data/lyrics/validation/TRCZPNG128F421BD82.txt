Feeding the lie
For the campaign
Sacrifice the blood
Of those who will resist

Who do we have to hate
The die-hard or the slave
The initiator or the henchman

Suffering in lies
Suffering in lies
On a silver plate, they teach hate
Powering hostility

Suffering in lies
Suffering in lies
Dead and buried, who's concerned
Powering hostility

Enduring freedom
Fighting the holy war
Commercial killing
Panic they adore

Who do we have to hate
The die-hard or the slave
The initiator or the henchman

Suffering in lies
Suffering in lies
On a silver plate, they teach hate
Powering hostility

Suffering in lies
Suffering in lies
Dead and buried, who's concerned
Powering hostility
