[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I can't quit her
She's got a hold on me
She got her hand on my soul
I can't quit her
Cause I see her face everywhere I go

[Chorus 1]
In the city streets, in the country fields
In the back of my mind
I know it can't be real
For a woman to possess
All the tenderness she had
But the hands of time
Keep tickin' on my back
Cause it's been so long
Since I had her back beside me
Yeah, I know

[Verse 2]
I can't quit her
Cause on my darkest night
She comes on like a light
I can't quite her
Try as I may, with all my might
She had a woman's touch
And a young girls eyes
And in seconds flat I was pros'lytized
Turned around
And made to feel sweet love
But the hands of time
Keep tickin' on my back
Cause it's been so long
Since I had her back beside me

[Bridge]
True love is somethin'
Ev'ry young boy knows about
And he fights his whole soul all the best to find some
I was a young boy
'till I held her in my arms
Now I find that I'm strung out behind some

[Verse 3]
I can't quit her
She got her hand on me
She got a hold on my soul
Cause I your face everywhere I go
I can't quit her, woo ooo yeah
I know
You know I see your face
Everywhere I go!
I need her...I need the little girl
