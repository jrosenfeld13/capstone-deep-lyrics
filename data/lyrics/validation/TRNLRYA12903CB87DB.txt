[Verse 1:]
Been dreams about
But never can i fly
Then because i always bounced too high
If i had a wish they will last a little more
Id rise above the clouds
And learn what I am bounding for
I found a way
At night i wrote
I leave today
I am talking about bounding away
Never get too far
Don't really know
I am always lost
Where i should go
I am talking about fading away
If i don't see my stars
If i had my wish
The stars won't move at all
Our shadows would be free
To lie down with me before
My dreams have traced a circle in the sand
Circle in the sand
Can i cast a shadow on the land
High up in the sky and twist and turn and  plummet to the earth below

[Chorus:]
And bounce (too high too high too high) [x5]

[Chorus:]
Can't you feel them (too high too high too high)and bounce
Turn to rubber band  (too high too high too high)and bounce
Can't you feel them (too high too high too high)and bounce
Turn to rubber band (too high too high too high)and bounce

[Outro:]
And bounce
Bounce [x3]
Haaaaahaaaaahaaaaa [x2]
Bounce [x7]
And bounce (too high too high too high) [x4]
Too high
Bounce [x10]
Too high too high too high [x4]
