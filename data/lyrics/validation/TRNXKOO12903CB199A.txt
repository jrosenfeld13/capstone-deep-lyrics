Drenched my car in gasoline
And I went racing down the street
I got lights, police and sirens
To take me from
This life and into the next

Into the Land of milk and honey
Noone here will listen
The keys in the ignition
Land of milk and honey
To you it's just rocks and stones
But I used to call this home
(Would you know where to go
If everything you know has gone away)

I'll never keep my memories
Yeah, no matter how hard I try
They will forever just stay here
The whispering
Of a life so far away
