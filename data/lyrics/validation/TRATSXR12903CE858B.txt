VERSE 1:
Home to me is by your side
Take the wheel, I'm along for the ride
I tried to be brave, but I guess I lied
When I said I was fine without you

I don't need to make future plans
As long as you just hold my hand
I want you to know I understand
I'm patient
I don't doubt you

CHORUS 1:
I'll go anywhere anytime
I'll go anywhere anytime
I'll go anywhere anytime
With you, with you

VERSE 2:
When you're up in the sky above the sea and the clouds
Think of how I called your name out loud
Think of how if you weren't so proud
You could be my lover

And then when your plane touches solid ground
And the taxi whisks you on into town
In the glittering lights I'll be all around
Cuz we belong with each other

CHORUS 2:
Oh, I'll go anywhere anytime
I'll go anywhere anytime honey
I'll go anywhere anytime
With you, with you

BRIDGE:
If you're up for an adventure let's go
Take a warm coat for the snow
I'll bring the snacks, you take the wheel
I can't explain, but every time it rains
This is how I feel
