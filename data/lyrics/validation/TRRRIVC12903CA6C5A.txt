Even now, when there's someone else who cares
When there's someone home who's waiting just for me
Even now I think about you as I'm climbing up the stairs
And I wonder what to do so she won't see

That even now, when I know it wasn't right
And I found a better life than what we had
Even now I wake up crying in the middle of the night
And I can't believe it still could hurt so bad

Even now, when I have come so far
I wonder where you are
I wonder why it's still so hard without you
Even now, when I come shinin' through
I swear I think of you
And how I wish you knew
Even now

Even now, when I never hear your name
And the world has changed so much since you've been gone
Even now I still remember and the feeling's still the same
And this pain inside of me goes on and on
Even now

Even now, when I have come so far
I wonder where you are
I wonder why it's still so hard without you
Even now, when I come shinin' through
I swear I think of you
And God I wish you knew
Somehow
Even now
