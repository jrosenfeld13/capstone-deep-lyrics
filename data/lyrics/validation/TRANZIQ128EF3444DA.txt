A single rose
The curtains close
A stranger's clothes
Were all I found
The great unknown
The tightrope show
A world below
Don't look down
Don't look down
Don't look down

Horse's head found in a bed
Broke the code and braved the weather
Wore a gown of chestnut brown
Finger's crossed that there's a heaven

Heaven heaven heaven heaven

Found a scroll
And ancient bones
A million ghosts
Were all around
The great unknown
The tightrope show
A world below
Don't look down
Don't look down
Don't look down

Horse's head found in a bed
Broke the code and changed the weather
Wore a gown of chestnut brown
Finger's crossed that there's a heaven

Heaven heaven heaven heaven

I found a scroll
And ancient bones
A million ghosts
Were all around
I found a scroll
And ancient bones
A million ghosts
Were all around

Horse's head found in a bed
Broke the code and braved the weather
Wore a gown of chestnut brown
Finger's crossed that there's a heaven

Horse's head found in a bed
Broke the code and changed the weather
Wore a gown of chestnut brown
Finger's crossed that there's a heaven

Heaven heaven heaven heaven

I found a horse's head
I found a horse's head
I found a horse's head
I found a horse's head
I found a horse's head
I found a horse's head
I found a horse's head
I found a horse's head
