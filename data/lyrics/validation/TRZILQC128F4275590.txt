[Intro]
No home

[Verse One]
This is not any form of home
Home, home is where the heart is
No home, no heart
No home, no heart

[Verse Two]
This your viewing room
Your room, no view
Nothing seen, nothing heard
Your home, no heart

[Chorus]
Shut up I'll kick you out
Shut up I'll do you in

[Verse Three]
This your trap, your crap
This is not my thing
No soul, no heart
No home no heart

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Our wounds heal slowly
They grow into mold me
Home

Can you trust me? (I've lived here for so long)
I won't change
So long sometimes
Can we just be enemies?

[Outro]
Our wounds heal slowly
They grow into mold me
Home
(Shut up I'll kick you out
Shut up I'll do you in)
