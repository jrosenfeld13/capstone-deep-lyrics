Take the risk to switch on your eyes
Try to breath, this is real life
Touch of sheet on this empty room

You won't die
You won't leave any clue
The world is warming up
The sounds are breaking down the night
And the sun is appearing out
You can turn off all the neon lights

And the sun is appearing out
Where do you think we should go?
It's not a covering silence to respect
Turn on

Voices from the infinity
That make me feel alive
I guess it's impossible for me
To imagine how this ends

But you can do it for me
They think I'm lonely
I'll do that journey
I guess I'm falling on

And the sun is appearing out
Where do you think we should go?
It's not a covering silence to respect
Turn on

Voices from the infinity
I guess it's impossible for me
To imagine how this ends
The night you told me tricks and jokes

Help me for the last time
Share with me the skyline

Voices from the infinity
They make me feel alive
That night you told me tricks and jokes
Help me for the last time
Share with me the skyline

Take the risk to switch on your eyes
Try to breath this is real life
Touch of sheet on this empty room
You won't die
You won't leave any clue

You should turn off all the neon lights

That night you told me tricks and jokes
Help me for the last time
Share with me the skyline

Take the risk to switch on your eyes
Try to breath this is real life
Touch of sheet on this empty room
You won't die
You won't leave any clue

And the sun is appearing out
Where do you think we should go?
It's not a covering silence to respect
Turn on

Voices from the infinity
Are calling tonight
Voices from the infinity
