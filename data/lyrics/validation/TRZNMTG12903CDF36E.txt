Stale drops of inferior taste
Handed down just to lay to waste
Foul scent of a dream gone bad
Die the death that he never had
I've seen the flaming sights
I've walked that dreaded mile
Religious fragmentation I gasp another line

So be it-This place turns to dust
So be it-Our blood turns to rust...
I see the world as gone'
Bring the pain!
I see the world as gone
Epidemic spreads across the land

To every place and into every man
The solution lost for all
Betrayed and broken
Domestic intervention may stop it for a while
Concealed intentions our code they mastermind

So be it-This place turns to dust
So be it-Our blood turns to rust...
I see the world as gone'
Bring the pain!
I see the world as gone'
