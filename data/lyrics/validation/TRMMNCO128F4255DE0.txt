The two of us together, we'll go down forever
By the skipping sound that my heart was making, I knew right then for sure
You're lips were softly moving, what you said, I could not hear
By the quivering way that you breathed my name, I knew right then for sure
That what I've wished was here
Sing it while we're young, Sing it, you've got all this light
I won't desert you, I won't desert you
Sing it while we're young, Sing it, we got blown away
I won't desert you, I won't desert you
The two of us together, what you said, I could not hear
But that cracking sound in your whispered voice, I knew right then for sure
The two of us together would never be forever
The shining rain running down your face and that skipping sound that my hear would make
All I've wished is gone

Sing it while we're young, Sing it, you've got all this light
I won't desert you, I won't desert you
Sing it while we're young, Sing it, we got blown away
I won't desert you, I won't desert you
I am not afraid
Sing it while we're young
Sing it, you've got all this light
I won't desert you, I won't desert you
Sing it while we're young, Sing it, we got blown away
We got blown away
We got blown away
