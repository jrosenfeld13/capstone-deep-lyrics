Like beeing in a strange dream
Somehow we're in the wrong van
Pop music on the radio
The guys are sleeping like dogs

A cool guy with tattoos driving
He has a thick pierce in his tongue
No reason so we just keep moving
Making music everyday

Yeah, gonna make it work
And find the power inside us
Yeah, gonna make it work
Nobody can control us
We'll be changed by this endless trip

Surely we are moving forward
What's waiting there for us?
300 miles, another town
Tell me all about your dreams

This endless trip is a sweet dream
I believe this make me strong
No reason so we travel on
Each new day a mystery

Yeah, gonna make it work
And find the power inside us
Yeah, gonna make it work
Nobody can control us
We'll be changed by this endless trip

I feel freedom, I feel spirits
I feel my future
When I reach the end of this road
I will find a new world there. Yeah!

Yeah, gonna make it work
And find the power inside us
Yeah, gonna make it work
Nobody can control us
We'll be changed by this endless trip
