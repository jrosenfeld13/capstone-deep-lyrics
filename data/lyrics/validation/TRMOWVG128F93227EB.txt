Here I am, baby
The one who swore to never yield
Here I am, baby
The one who swore to play the field

Said I wouldn't let no man tie me down, not a single one now
Wasn't gonna ever give my heart to a mother's son now
Many a day I proudly stated the man for me ain't been created

But here I am, baby
The one who was so love defiant
Here I am, baby
The one who was so self reliant

Said I wouldn't depend on nothing else, I'll be independent
Make a fortune all my own and I know how to spend it
I'd be so stationary, love would be unnecessary
But here I am

Here I am, baby, baby, baby
You won me and I do concede
Here I am, baby, baby, baby
I find you're what I really need

Said you've got me hanging on a string, don't you let me drop now
Since you started loving me, don't you ever stop now
Don't wanna be loved by another, I ain't going another bother

Here I am baby, baby, baby
Take me 'cause I'm yours alone
Here I am baby, baby, baby
Yours to call your very own
Take me 'cause I'm yours alone
