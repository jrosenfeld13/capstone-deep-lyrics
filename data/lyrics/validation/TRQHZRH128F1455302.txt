[Intro]
This tune is one of my all-time favourite songs
Send my love to Rosie, where she may be

[Verse 1]
It's just like heaven
Being here with you
You're like an angel
Too good to be true
But after all, I love you, I do
Angel baby, my angel baby

[Chorus]
Uh, uh, I love you
Uh, uh, I do
No one can love you like I do
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh

[Verse 2]
When you are near me
My heart skips a beat
I can hardly stand on
My own two feet
Because I love you, I love you, I do
Angel baby, my angel baby

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Please, never leave me
Blue and alone
If you ever go
I'm sure you'll come back home
Because I love you, I love you, I do
Angel baby, my angel baby

[Chorus]
