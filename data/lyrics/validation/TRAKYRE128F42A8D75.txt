You should have told me
Never should have sold me down the river
Wasn't fair play
And I'm goin' away, goodbye

I could do much better
Will you write me a letter of recommendation?
Say what you think
But please don't stint on the praise

You can play any part
With a versatile heart
Sugar, soft and sweet
You made my life complete

When I sifted through the wreckage
And I read your message, it tore me apart
You're lucky you can choose
Who you love and who you lose, that's an art

Was the screw worth turnin'?
Was the bridge worth burnin' you so and so?
On your high moral ground
Worth less than the pound and your halo

You can play any part
With a versatile heart
Sugar, soft and sweet
You made my life complete

You can play any part
With a versatile heart
Sugar, soft and sweet
You made my life complete

You say you love me, I bet you do
Too bad you never told me so
Stay on the road, you two faced fool
That way we'll never come to blows

You should have told me
Never should have sold me down the river
Wasn't fair play
And I'm goin' away, goodbye

I could do much better
Will you write me a letter of recommendation?
Say what you think
But please don't stint on the praise

You can play any part
With a versatile heart
Sugar, soft and sweet
You made my life complete

You can play any part
With a versatile heart
Sugar, soft and sweet
You made my life complete
