I've thought about it a million times
It takes all my strength just to keep it calm
I hove to tell myself, just let it breathe
Holding it inside will only help to do me in
Each time I close my eyes I see another chain
It's one I can't forget, something I can not break out of

I need a second skin, something to hold me up
Can't seem to get out of this hole
I've dug myself right back in

Just to wake up tells me I must be brave
It hits me like a drug shot into my vein
It's not as delightful of a pain
Immobilizing me
Almost makes me think I'm dead

I need a second skin
Something to hold me tough
Can't do it on my own
Sometimes I need just a little more help
I want that chance to give every drop that's left in me
I need a second skin
Something I can not break out of

I tell myself, just let it breathe
It's a calmness I'm always searching for
But the dirt it gets so heavy
It falls above my head
Seeping from under my feet
It just keeps on getting deeper

I need a second skin
Something to hold me up
Can't do it on my own
Sometimes I need just a little more help
I've got that chance to give every drop that's left in me
I need a second skin
Something I cannot break free of

Though no one ever said it'd be easy
Still one's left to deny the choice that comes
Between your willingness to survive
Though you're knowing what you stand up against
A world set to deceive
You need a special strength

I've got that second skin
I've got that chance to give
I've got the only way that I know how to live with it
I need a second skin
Something to hold me tough
I need a second skin
Something I cannot break out of
