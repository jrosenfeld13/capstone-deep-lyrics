[Chorus:]
I can't believe I've fallen so hard for you
We've known each other so long
All along I've been out lookin for somethin
When somethin was you all along

[Verse 1:]
I used to look to you as a friend
The one I'd call when I felt like my life was bout to end
When the sky is fallin down and the walls are closin in
Inside I need a friend so I'm callin you again
Oh can you life me up cause I feel so down
I'm lost in my head I feel used but refused to belive that love is dead
She gave me all the signs but I was blind, my thrid eye sees you
I keep hookin up and leavin
Believin this ones right
But that one just ain't my type or hype
See I'm not tryin to waste my life
We'll sit back and watch as it races by
Cause what I'm lookin for is a love that's true
I never thought it was you and I don't know why
I always thought it was her that I'd find her for sure
But I'm a little too old to be actin immature

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Your the one that love me your the one that cares
And girl you're the one that'll always be there
See I've looked high and I've looked low
For the girl that I had right under my nose and
Goes to show that you really never know
So I turned around and found my way back to your front door
And I don't think we can just be friends anymore
I'm here to let you know I let the other girls go
I hope you feel like I feel cause I swear there's somethin real
It's tearin me apart now I'm the owner of a lonley heart
So if I wish upon a star we can live a fairy tale
I'm not afraid to try and I'm not afraid to fail
I made up my mind this time you tipped the scale
Let my lips touch your lips...keep it down girl
Cause I wouldn't want you to miss this for the world
My third eye sees you now...

[Guitar Interlude]

[Verse 3:]
Girl you could keep me here to stay
Girl you just take my breath away
You're more than just a friend to me
So you can have your way
Let's say that we were meant to be
If we don't try we'll never see
Believe and take a chance with me
So you can have your way

[Chorus]
