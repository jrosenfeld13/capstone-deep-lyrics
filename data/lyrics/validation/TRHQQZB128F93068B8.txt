(Chorus)
Cove to cove, from all around the world
With my pieces of eight in capturing the fool
Or so the story goes. He found his bullion

Forgotten gold, he's got a hook as his hand
Fortunes lost, pillage and take my friends
Forgotten gold, he's got a parrot on his shoulder

(Chorus)
With a patch on his eye
And a sword by his side
A bag full of gold
And one wooden leg
A patch on his eye
A sword by his side
A bag full of gold
...One wooden leg...

Pass the sentence, now walk the plank
Cast your verdict, now walk the plank
Send the accused, now walk the plank
The sentence cast, now walk the plank

(Chorus)
