On that day I finally saw it through wide open eyes
And on that day another autumn day I saw the lies
And I said stop, cause I can't breathe
Let me take away the blinding light
And I said stop, I can't breathe
Got to find my way out of this circus ring reality now

And I can't wait to shut it out tonight
And I can't wait to leave this all behind
And timelines blur the faces everything and all
And in the meantime I'll just fall

On that day I finally saw it through wide open eyes
On that day I lost the sweet denial and saw the lies
And I said stop, cause I can't breathe
Got to find my way out of this circus ring reality now

And I can't wait to shut it out tonight
And I can't wait to leave this all behind
And timelines blur the faces everything and all
And in the meantime I'll just fall

Let me know how to deal with screaming here in silence slowly drowning
I'm slowly drowning
Maybe I'll just take my pills that take away the laughter pain and all
Take it away it all
Please make me feel alive and real and take away this need
And take these dreams that hold me down now

And I can't wait to shut it out tonight
And I can't wait to leave this all behind
And timelines blur the faces everything and all
And in my own time I will fall
In my own time I might fall
In my own time I will fall
