Why can't she make up her fucking mind
I'm just here wasting so much time
I know it's my fault
It's not my problem anymore

Someday
Maybe she'll come back to me
And I'll say
Why don't you go fuck yourself
But everybody's talking
They know that I'm lying
She gave me everything
All I want is more

Yeah, I wrote this song for her
But it won't make up for anything
I know it's too late, so why do I wait?
It's not my problem anymore

Someday
Maybe she'll come back to me
And I'll say
Why don't you go fuck yourself
But everybody's talking
They know that I'm lying
She won't do anything
I'll always wait for her

Someday
Maybe she'll come back to me
And I'll say
Why don't you go fuck yourself
But everybody's talking
They know that I'm lying
She gave me everything
All I want is more

All I want is more
