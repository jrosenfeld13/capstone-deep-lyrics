Monday on the line
When you know that now's the time
To leave and be free, aware of your destiny
When that moment arrives
Wild visions through the mind
And all I see is what used to be
My life could soon be a memory

I don't ever wanna feel pain
Wanna be ready when you call my name
I don't ever wanna feel fear
'cos every night feels alright when your near

Battle through this war of nerves
When your life it takes a turn
And what I have is what I fear
While in my mind your lying here
Fear that unholy dread
There's a piece of me in all he said
All kinds of weird stuff inside my head
The stage fright in my own bed

I don't ever wanna feel pain
Wanna be ready when u call my name
I don't ever wanna feel fear
'cos every night feels alright when your near

Don't wanna be like a voice without words
'cos I need you here with me
Don't wanna be alone in this world
Will I surpress my fear
When will I beat
This war of nerves

I don't ever wanna feel pain
Wanna be ready when you call my name
I don't ever wanna feel fear
'cos every night feels alright when you're near
