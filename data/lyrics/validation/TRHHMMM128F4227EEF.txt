We welcome you
We welcome you

The journey has begun
We're glad you chose to come
We're the children of the Sun
And we welcome you

To the place where time and light are one
With the energy of a thousand Suns
Ships of light on a sea of stars
Past the rings of Jupiter, canals of Mars

Past the edge of time in our universe
It's an endless flight on an unknown course
Though a million lifetimes yet to come
Fly the crystal ships and children of the Sun

Through colours man has never seen
To places man can never dream
On shafts of light the ships are spinnin'
To the place where life this is begin'

Every muscle cell and tissue achin'
As at last the walls of time are breakin'
Down, ... down, ... down
