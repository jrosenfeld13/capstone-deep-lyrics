Lisa washed her hair on Monday
Lisa washed her hair on Tuesday
Lisa washed her hair on Wednesday
Lisa washed her hair in Thursday

Then her husband noticed that her shampoo
Had upset her pH balance
Her hair was all dried out and frizzy
So he shot the bitch and moved to the city

Her husband got a job at a roller rink
He tried to pick up chicks but he had a little dink
He brushed his teeth with Aim but it didn't matter
Nice fresh breath but his dink didn't get no bigger

Oh what a stupid world
