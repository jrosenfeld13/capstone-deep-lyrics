I want to hurt you and don't know why
Though I know it's not like me
I cannot help it
Though I try to keep you away

And all this time I thought I knew who you were
But this time all your words were just lies for demise
And your thoughts were found unpure
So when push comes to shove I found reasons
To not work it out or relate
And get off on the fear that I give when you're near
And the problems that I create

This time, I think you'll finally see
This time, I will not break
This time, I'm smart enough to know
There is only so much I'll take (this time)

This time, I'm gonna make a change (this time)
This time, you're in my way (this time)
This time, I will not play the same
Head trip on me game that you play

As unresolved situations escalate
Inside something brings me to push you
To find out what you can take
When we run out of love and change seasons
With our lives together at stake
I'm aware of the tears that I give when you're near
And the confusion that I make

This time, I think you'll finally see
This time, I will not break
This time, I'm smart enough to know
There is only so much I'll take (this time)

This time, I'm gonna make a change (this time)
This time, you're in my way (this time)
This time, I will not play the same
Head trip on me game that you play

I want to hurt you and don't know why
I cannot help it
Though I try to keep you away

This time, I think you'll finally see
This time, I will not break
This time, I'm smart enough to know
There is only so much I'll take (this time)

This time, I'm gonna make a change (this time)
This time, you're in my way (this time)
This time, I will not play the same
Head trip on me game that you play

(This time) I want to hurt you
(This time) I don't wanna lie
(This time) I want to hurt you
(This time) I don't wanna lie
