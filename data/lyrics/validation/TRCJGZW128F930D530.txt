Sister
You've been on my mind
Sister, we're two of a kind
So sister
I'm keepin' my eyes on you
I betcha think
I don't know nothin'
But singin' the blues
Oh sister, have I got news for you
I'm somethin'
I hope you think
That you're somethin' too

Oh, Scufflin'
I been up that lonesome road
And I seen a lot of suns goin' down
Oh, but trust me
No low life's gonna run me around

So let me tell you somethin' sister
Remember your name
No twister
Gonna steal your stuff away
My sister
Sho' ain't got a whole lot of time
So shake your shimmy
Sister
'Cause honey this 'shug
Is feelin' fine
