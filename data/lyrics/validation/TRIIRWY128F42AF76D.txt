The return of the ghostfaced killer

You'd better watch out, you'd better lock your door
What's that sound coming through my wall?
All those screams, sounds like murder
The return of the ghostfaced killer

Hear the footsteps, they're coming up the stairs
Climbing the walls and they're moving round the chairs
All those screams, sounds like murder
The return of the ghostfaced killer

You'd better watch out, you'd better lock your door
'Cause you don't know who that killer will be waiting for
The ghostfaced killer

The return of the ghostfaced killer
The ghostfaced killer
The return of the ghostfaced killer
