[Verse 1]
Oh, girl I've known you very well
I've seen you growing everyday
I never really looked before
But now you take my breath away

Suddenly you're in my life
A part of everything I do
You got me working day and night
Just trying to keep a hold on you

[Hook]
Here in your arms I found my paradise
My only chance for happiness
And if I lose you now I think I would die

Oh say you'll always be my baby, we can make it shine
We can take forever, just a minute at a time

More than a woman, more than a woman to me
More than a woman, more than a woman to me
More than a woman, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
There are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me
And I can see myself
Let history repeat itself

Reflecting how I feel for you
Thinking about those people then
I know that in a thousand years
I'd fall in love with you again

[Hook]
This is the only way that we should fly
This is the only way to go
And if I lose you I know I would die

Oh say you'll always be my baby, we can make it shine
We can take forever, just a minute at a time

More than a woman, more than a woman to me
More than a woman, more than a woman to me
More than a woman, oh, oh, oh

[Outro]
More than a woman, more than a woman to me
More than a woman, more than a woman to me
More than a woman, more than a woman to me
More than a woman, more than a woman to me
More than a woman, more than a woman to me
