I could be a Casanova
If I could get out on my own
I'm always tied to someone's finger
I'd like to break that little bone
Be the big man in this small town
Try my hand at being cool
Drink martinis with a virgin
Cash out on the golden rule

But I don't wanna be lonely
Let it all go to waste
I don't wanna be lonely
Like some playboy in outer space

Make a scene with all the hipsters
Stay out late and never leave
Let it all ride double zero
Is that so hard to believe?
I could even go soul searching
Try to find my inner child
Spend my money on some new wheels
Sit back and watch the girls go wild

But I don't wanna be lonely
Let it all go to waste
I don't wanna be lonely
Like some playboy in outer space
Like some playboy in outer space

(solo)

I could be a Casanova
If I could get out on my own
Get some darlings on the sofa
Make them dinner, make them moan
Lose a few friends in the meanwhile
Win a weekend at the Sands
Take a real chance on losing you
Could you ever understand?

But I don't wanna be lonely
Let it all go to waste
I don't wanna be lonely
Like some playboy in outer space

I don't wanna be lonely
What a terrible waste
I don't wanna be lonely
Like some playboy in outer space
Like some playboy in outer space
Like some playboy in outer space

I don't wanna be lonely
I don't wanna be lonely
I don't wanna be lonely
I don't wanna be lonely (lonely)
I don't wanna be lonely (lonely)
I don't wanna be lonely (lonely)
I don't wanna be lonely (lonely)
Like some playboy
