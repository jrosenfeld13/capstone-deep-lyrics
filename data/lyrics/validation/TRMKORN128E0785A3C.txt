Sometimes I feel as though my life's getting stranger
Now I need to find a way to get this strain off of my back
Sometimes we need to lock the door
And throw away the key
Sometimes we need to learn to let be

Yeah, it's nice to feel the sun
Yeah, it's nice to feel the sun

So I awake to find that I'm in no danger
I finally found the strength I need still spinning on my back
And now I feel the sun
Shining down on me
Sometimes we have to live and be free

Yeah, it's nice to feel the sun
Yeah, it's nice to feel the sun

For days now I've waited for the light to shine
Shine down on me

Yeah, it's nice to feel the sun
Yeah, it's nice to feel the sun
