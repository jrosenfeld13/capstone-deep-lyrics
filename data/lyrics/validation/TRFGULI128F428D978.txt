Christmas lights up the city
Roof tops covered in snow
Lovers sharing a sleigh ride cuddled close
And their eyes seem to glow

Window shopping on main street
Bundled up head to toe
Children are skating around a Christmas tree
I see smiles young and old

If everyday could be Christmas
What a wonderful world it would be
We could carry this feeling within us
All through the year
If everyday could be Christmas

Chruch bells ring in the distance
Peace on earth fills the air
Sidewalk Santas handing out candy canes
I feel love everywhere

If everyday could be Christmas
What a wonderful world it would be
We could carry this feeling within us
All through the year
If everyday could be Christmas

Oh it's that time
We open and give from our hearts
Let love shine brighter than any star

Oh if everyday could be Christmas
What a wonderful world it would be
We could carry this feeling within us
All through the year
Oh if everyday could be Christmas
If everyday could be Christmas
Yeah if everyday could be Christmas
If everyday could be Christmas
