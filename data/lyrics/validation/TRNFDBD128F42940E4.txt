I don't feel like going home without you
I don't feel like going home all alone
I don't feel like going home

Turn three-sixty, spin my head around
Nearly did my back in, just to catch your eye
Trying to tell you something, still can't spit it out
Better keep my mouth shut, till we say goodbye

We get closer, touch and hit it off
But before I knew it, you up and leave me
Bolt to the door, tripped and hit the deck
Now I can't stop myself screaming out your name

I don't feel like going home without you
I don't feel like going home all alone
I don't feel like going home without you
I don't feel like going home all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone

All alone
All alone

We get closer, touch and hit it off
But before I knew it, you up and leave me
Bolt to the door, tripped and hit the deck
Now I can't stop myself screaming out your name

I don't feel like going home without you
I don't feel like going home all alone
I don't feel like going home without you
I don't feel like going home all alone

I don't feel like going home without you
(I don't really feel like going home)
I don't feel like going home all alone
(I don't really feel like going home at all)
I don't feel like going home without you
(I don't really feel like going home)
I don't feel like going home all alone
