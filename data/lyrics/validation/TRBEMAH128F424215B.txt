Love, oh Love
Why are you leaving me? (Why are you leaving, why are you leaving)
I did everything I could
I truly did so good
But still you're leaving me
Friends talk, and you walk
But I'm the one who's losing
In my mind and sometimes
And yes it gets confusing
Cause love can replay can
Get to be demanding
I always thought we had a real understanding

Love, oh Love
Why are you leaving me? (Why are you leaving, why are you leaving)
I did everything I could
I did it just for you
But now you're leaving me

It should be we disagree
At least we'd end up talking
But will-say has changed your ways
And you started walking
I never thought we never get to see
The moment all of your friends could
Make you turn your back on me

Love, Just what I'm supposed to do (What am I supposed to do)
I gave evey single dime
Devoted all my time
To making love to you

Let's talk today to find a way
To get this thing together
Just trust in me and you will see
That love can last forever

Cause nothing we've got
Can so be so cruel with me, baby
So just take my hand
And I don't mean with delay, baby (trust in me, baby)

I say oh, love, Just what I'm supposed to do (Just what am I supposed to do)
I gave evey single dime
Devoted all my time
To making love to you

Let's talk today to find a way
To get this thing together
Just trust in me and you will see
That love can last forever

I'm so in love with you
All that I can do
Is come to please you
Every time I see you

Say, love
