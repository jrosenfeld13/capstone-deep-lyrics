You got me losing my mind
Walkin' the line between Heaven and Hell
You got me caught in between
A doubt and a dream but I know you so well

I hear that all is fair in love and war
Well, you and I have seen 'em both before
Something's happening that I can't ignore
I just can't seem to see no difference anymore

You got me spinning around
Draggin' me down then you love me again
I'm higher than high
Ready to fly then you say it's the end

I hear that all is fair in love and war
You and I have seen 'em both before
Something's happening that I can't ignore
I just can't seem to see no difference anymore

Spending most of my time
Trying to make up my mind what you're thinkin' about me
The moment I do
You're somebody new, it's a new mystery

I hear that all is fair in love and war
Well, you and I have seen 'em both before
Something's happening that I can't ignore
Oh, I can't seem to see no kind of difference anymore

Anymore
