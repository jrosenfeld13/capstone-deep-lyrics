AND NOW (Wassup)...INTRODUCING TO THE WORLD (Who) MUNGA...HONOREBEL...

Yes, yesssss!!!

And I came to take my place, never you forget my face
Its, M to da U to day N-G-A!! Fiyah more shot dan di NBA
Rastafari get the praise when mi pray
Di gurl dem love when my tune play
And I came to take my place, never you forget my face
Its, M to da U to da N-G-A!! Fiyah more shot dan the NBA
Rastafari get the praise when mi pray
Di gurls dem love when my song play

Good evening, its a good evening
Selling dro, making dough, its a good season
Chilling on my block, we having a good reasoning
Eating some collard greens with some good seasoning

Huh! Its no gimmick when Im spittin my lyrics
I give a fuck about those hypocrites and da critics
The perfect in da mimics, they have never yet seen this
Cuz imma fly to the sky if the sky is the limit

Hopping out of da Civic, Im throwing bows like Riddick
Its so miraculous, its ridiculous
They tryna bite me like Dracula
But I sting dem with my venom cuz Im SOO spectacular!

And I came to take my place, never you forget my face
Its, M to da U to day N-G-A!! Fiyah more shot dan di NBA
Rastafari get the praise when mi pray
Di gurl dem love when my tune play
And I came to take my place, never you forget my face
Its, M to da U to da N-G-A!! Fiyah more shot dan the NBA
Rastafari get the praise when mi pray
Di gurls dem love when my song play

And my future is for me to decide, I roll with my queen to the side
Black Benz, top down, red, chromed and gleamed to da side
Always got my ting to the side; BIG chrome machine to da side
Extra magazine to the side, Full four magnum infrared beam to the side

So much fool from me to decide, coming, bulging teeth to the side
I cast two but he cower to a fool, under my banana wit a gleam to da side
I keep Marlon to the side, Charleen to the front, Carleen to the side
Guess Jeans, Sneaks and Tees, Clean...Cap, leaned to the side!!

And I came to take my place, never you forget my face
Its, M to da U to day N-G-A!! Fiyah more shot dan di NBA
Rastafari get the praise when mi pray
Di gurl dem love when my tune play
And I came to take my place, never you forget my face
Its, M to da U to da N-G-A!! Fiyah more shot dan the NBA
Rastafari get the praise when mi pray
Di gurls dem love when my song play

Yeah!! I picked up Marvette in my Carette
A piece of fiyah fell from my spliff and burnt a hole in my carpet
Police was on da block, but Munga nuh fret
Cuz my dough is one of the biggest and my car is one of the fastest

Ha! I was bouncing to some Black Eyed Peas
Just eat some collard greens, brown rice and some black eyed peas
Tell squadie dont stop I...PLEASE!!
Dont let me have to leave yuh with a black eye, please!

Why?!?! Its so terrific, yet so horrific, Im so prolific
Sick wit it, find my formula and stick wit it
I rhyme right to rhyme tight
Fools I told yall before, I showed yall before!

Im so rich, cuz Im.so slick, I write...so quick
My lines is so sick, my dough...so thick
And my, whole clique be gangstas
Dat means da nines dont stick

And I came to take my place, never you forget my face
Its, M to da U to day N-G-A!! Fiyah more shot dan di NBA
Rastafari get the praise when mi pray
Di gurl dem love when my tune play
And I came to take my place, never you forget my face
Its, M to da U to da N-G-A!! Fiyah more shot dan the NBA
Rastafari get the praise when mi pray
Di gurls dem love when my song play
