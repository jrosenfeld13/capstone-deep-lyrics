Eyes, I've opened mine
I've seen they signs
We live in times designed to test, select the best
And train the rest to serve and blindly follow

Rise giants, can't have you sleeping so long
Start stretching, we need your strength to move on
Stand tall in defense of your land
Reach out lend us a hand

For it seems all cultures dream
They have a giant who is sleeping
Or a king who will return in times of need
To fight for setting his people free

They teach the kids which fads to follow
So they're unaware tomorrow
When another crippled culture
Dies in the shadow 'neath the corporate vulture

Rise giants, how have you slept for so long?
Start stretching, we need your strength to move on
Stand tall in defense of your land
Rise up to fight the force that draws us backwards

Back along the track we just came down
Everyday losing ground
For so few dare to move forward
Or even look all around

When people before could take it no more
They'd create a big friend like Gigantor
By getting in touch with force and much more powerful
Stuff stored deep within us

For it seem all cultures dream
They have a giant who is sleeping
Or a king who will return in times of need
To fight for setting his people free

Free, if anyone asked me
I'd take the chance and shake the Red King
To see, if we are in his dream
The time's right, we should wake all our giants

We should summon them now to rise upon our enemies, and
Like dominoes they will fall over
For I believer our destiny is lying in the eyes of our
Giants
