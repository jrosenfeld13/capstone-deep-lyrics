[Intro]
Choking on your fear
You no longer see so clearly

[Chorus]
This love that never lasts
(choking on your fear)
Is love that fools so easily
It's anger deep inside
(you no longer see so clearly)
It's anger deep inside of me

[Verse]
It's empty words that ring
(choking on your fear)
Empty words don't mean a thing
This love that leaves so fast
(you no longer see so clearly)
Is love that comes so easily

[Chorus]
This love that leaves so fast
(so fast)
Is love that fools so easily
This love that leaves so fast
(so fast)
Is love that comes so easily
This love that leaves so fast
(so fast)
Is love that fools so easily
This love that leaves so fast
(so fast)
Is love that comes so easily
