You...
Me...
Maybe...

Well i was wondering
If you'd fly away with me
We'd go to a promise land
Some place, sometime to breath

You know i got faith in you
Put a little trust in me
We've got what eachother needs
So baby just believe

{Pep Love}
I do
You and I, I
You and me, we
Could come together and set this wourld free, please
Believe in this dream we gon weave
Cuz we believe in this theavin'
This heevin' this eve of distruction behind us
Let this love intertwined us and find us
Out of this bind plus
Peace your highness
Ease your mind
Its time to just chill and just build and just unwind

{chorus}
Ease you mind come chill with me
No more work just for a week
Its goin good
Now we can see
We were ment to be

Ease you mind come chill with me
No more work just for a week
Its goin good
Now we can see
We were ment to be

When i first looked at you
I knew there was something real
You're different from other men
Wanna give
To you what you've given me
There's no need to question these
Intentions that I have

Its the little suttle things
Excuses to make you smile
Come over just for a while
Dont wanna hold back any more

Ease you mind come chill with me
No more work just for a week
Its goin good
Now we can see
We were ment to be

{Pep Love}
Infinity and beyond
The potential for this stretch is long
We on a higher eschelon
'n extra strong
When we're together theres no presseure just a song and
You inspire me
I empower you
We on some real shit
Cuz this is how we do
To let love live
We creatin a great theme
Amd makin a great team is Goapele sing

{Goapele}
Some people go
On looking for

Just to find what we have now so
Let the wind blow
Let the sun shine
Let the birds fly
Turn it up lets ride
Come on let catch a show
Escape a moments
In these tryin times you got me on a natural high

Ease you mind come chill with me
No more work just for a week
Its goin good
Now we can see
We were ment to be

Ease you mind come chill with me
No more work just for a week
Its goin good
Now we can see
We were ment to be

Ease you mind come chill with me
No more work just for a week
Its goin good
Now we can see
We were ment to be
