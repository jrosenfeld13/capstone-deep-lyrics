I live under a giant cloud
Well its my shield, and its my shroud
At home on the range, but alone in the crowd
I plug my ears when it gets too loud, yah

So get that kinky noise out on the stage
With your spinnin curls in a purple rage
The sun in our eyes, and a burning sage
Youre all alone then you turn the page

Could it be? Yah it could be
Could it be? That youre for me, yah
Im lookin right to your head
And talkin to you seems to wake the dead
But right now you just said
I think were gonna break the bed

Hands in the air and knees on the ground
Dont be suprised if I fall around
We were over the water, when the plane went went
I was over my head and you let me drown

Could it be? Yah it could be
Could it be? That youre for me, yah
Im lookin right to your head
And talkin to you seems to wake the dead
But right now you just said
I think were gonna break the bed

Im lookin right to your head
And talkin to you seems to wake the dead
But right now you just said
I think were gonna break the bed
I think were gonna break the bed
