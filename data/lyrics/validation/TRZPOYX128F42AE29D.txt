Hey!

You said you needed full time help
'cause you're all alone
I said i'd work for nothing at all
If i just could take you home

And now you're taking applications
For your love
You wanted certain specifications
I circled the one that said all the above

Work... for love

Finally got my resume
And you said you'd reviewed it some other day
I said, 'girl, hey, do it if you dare
Where i'd like to go our love will flare'

Finally my letter arrived
And i knew you would be mine
Instead i had to prove my turf
For the first two weeks work overtime

Work... for love

You've got to work

You've got to work for love (had enough, had enough?)
