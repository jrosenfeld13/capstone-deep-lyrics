[Verse 1]
Open up your eyes
Take a look at me
Get the picture fixed in your memory
I'm driven by the rhythm like the beat of a heart
And I won't stop until I start
To stand out, to stand out

Some people settle for the typical thing
Livin' all their lives waiting in the wings
It ain't a question of "if"
Just a matter of time
Before I move to the front of the line

[Pre-Chorus]
Once you're watching every move that I make
You gotta believe that I got what it takes

[Chorus]
To stand out
Above the crowd
Even if I gotta shout out loud
'Til mine is the only face you'll see
Gonna stand out 'til ya notice me

[Verse 2]
If the squeaky wheel's always gettin' the grease
I'm totally devoted to disturbin' the peace
And I'll do it all again, when I get done
Until I become your number one

No method to the madness
And no means of escape
Gonna break every rule or bend them all outta shape
It ain't a question of "how"
Just a matter of when
You get the message that I'm tryin' to send

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm under a spell
I'm in over my head
And you know I'm going all of the way to the end

[Chorus]
To stand out
Above the crowd
Even if I gotta shout out loud
'Til mine is the only face you see
Gonna stand out,'til ya notice me

[Bridge]
If I could make you stop
And take a look at me
Instead of just walkin' by
There's nothin' that I wouldn't do
If it was gettin' you to notice
I'm alive

[Pre-Chorus]
All I need is half a chance
A second thought
A second glance
To prove, I got whatever it takes
It's a piece of cake

[Chorus]
To stand out
Above the crowd
Even if I gotta shout out loud
'Til mine is the only face you'll see
Gonna stand out
Stand out (aayah)

[Outro]
Stand out!
(Yeaeaeaeah)
Stand out!
(Uh)
'Til mine is the only face you'll see
Gonna stand out
'Til ya notice me
