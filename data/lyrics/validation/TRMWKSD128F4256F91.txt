I displayed metered bluff
Pandering not to one
Shovels showered down
Sediment flaked off my skin

Sweet jets polished the rest
Hungry knives and hornets bounced right off
Bridge of toungues guides me out
Great corn grinders master spout

Vomit for pandora
And bathe in the squalor
Let it flow down the valley
Make a new vesuvius
