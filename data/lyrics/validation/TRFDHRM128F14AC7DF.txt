The work has been done
And the boss is gone
Baby, I'm on my way to you
Friday night

I missed your embrace
Seven lonely days
There are so many kisses due
Friday night

The week has been long
But our love is strong
And tonight we will start a new
Friday night

The taste of the wine
Will be so divine
When I'm sharin' my glass with you
Friday night

Since Friday night
I've been so lonely
Tell me why
You kiss me only
Only Friday night
The more kiss you
Friday night
The more I miss you
Every night
My love's too big for only Friday night

Friday night
Wrong or right
Dim the light we're out of sight
Friday night
Wrong or right
Hold me tight with all your might
Friday night is alright
Every night should be a Friday night

I hope and I pray
You will say one day
That our love is not only for
Friday night

For then is will be

Ev'ry night, you'll see
And for ever and evermore
Friday night

Since Friday night
I've been so lonely
Tell me why
You kiss me only
Only Friday night
The more kiss you
Friday night
The more I miss you
Every night
My love's too big for only Friday night

Friday night
Wrong or right
Dim the light we're out of sight
Friday night
Wrong or right
Hold me tight with all your might
Friday night is alright
Every night should be a Friday night

Since Friday night
I've been so lonely
Tell me why
You kiss me only
Only Friday night
The more kiss you
Friday night
The more I miss you
Every night
My love's too big for only Friday night

Friday night
Wrong or right
Dim the light we're out of sight
Friday night
Wrong or right
Hold me tight with all your might
Friday night is alright
Every night should be a Friday night
