As we went to the door
I was asking for more
So she reached out and turned off the light
Then her daddy called
To mind the lecherous lout
Who was a monster in the dead of night
So I went away home
Feeling hurt and alone
And frustrated in the dead of night
Then I called her at dawn
And we made love on the lawn
'Cos her daddy thought it was alright

Danger to the girl at night
In the morning it will be alright
Don't do it in the dead of night
Tomorrow it should be alright

In the Birmingham Mail
They reported a whale
They'd discovered in the dead of night
In the local canal
It was found by a pal
Of the bloke who'd lost it from his bike
We can say it again
If it doesn't make sense
But never in the dead of night
If we wait until dawn
When the reason is born
We can see it better in the light

Dreaming in the dead of night
In the morning it will be alright
Screaming in the dead of night
Tomorrow it will be alright
