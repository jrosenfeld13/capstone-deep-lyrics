Love
Love is strange
Many people
Take it for a game
Once you've had it
You're in an awful fix
'cos when you've had it
You never want to quit

Many people
They don't understand
They think love
Is money in their hand
But your sweet love
Is better than a kiss
And when you leave me
Those kisses I will miss

Love, mmmm
Love is strange
Many people, mmmm
Take it for a game
Once you've had it, mmmm
You're in an awful fix
'cos when you've had it
You never want to quit

Many people, mmmm
They don't understand
They think love, mmmm
Is money in their hand
But your sweet loving, mmmm
Is better than a kiss
And when you leave me, mmmm
Those kisses I will miss

Those kisses I will miss
Those kisses I will miss
