O' you go the high road an' I'll take the low road
An' I'll be in Scotland before ye
For me and my true love we'll never walk again
On the bonnie bonnie banks of Loch Lomond

You'll take the acid an' I'll take the dope
An' I'll be stonied before ye
For me an' my true love, the drink waters' well
On the bonnie bonnie banks of Loch Lomond

Step we gaily on we go
Heel for heel and toe for toe
Arm in arm [an' row an' row
All for Mhairi's wedding]

I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll take the low road

On the lead guitar, from Yorkshire
Mr. Steven Rothery!

I said you, you, you, you take the high road
I said I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll take the low road

On the bass guitar, the backing vocal, from Aylesbury
Mr. Peter Trewavas!

I said you, you, you, you'll take the high road
I said I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll take the low road

On the keyboads, from Dublin
Mr. Mark Kelly!

I said you, you--, you'll take the high road
I said I'll, I'll--, I'll take the low road

On drums, percussion

And a very big round of applause for yourself
Our audience tonight. It takes two!

On vocals, and percussion
Fish!

A dream fulfilled!

Sweet Ma- Ma- Ma- Ma- Margaret (4x)

I said you take the high road
[an' I'll take the low road
An' I'll be in Scotland afore you
For me and my true love we'll never meet again
On the bonnie bonnie banks of Loch Lomond]

Sweet Ma- Ma- Ma- Ma- Margaret (4x)
