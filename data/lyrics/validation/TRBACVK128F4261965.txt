I'm the spaceman cowboy
Psychedelic psychic
Paranoid schizoid
Counting all my vices
I'm fighting all my blessings
I'm caught up in a crisis
Although my sleep's deathless
My days seem lifeless

I scream at existence, it answers with silence
I silenced the questions with outbursts of violence
I'm lost in the maze where I find my reality
I triumph on self defeat and beat myself gradually
I drove myself mad, searching for sanity
I lost my way home while exploring the galaxies
I'm fueling these fires that burn my mentality
My muse is abuse and a long road of tragedies
I drown in the depths of my bitter self knowledge
I used all my bravery trying to have courage
I seek for forgiveness, but beg to be punished
I fight for my freedom while chained to these gutters
I find all my comforts in deep insecurities
Spoil what's beautiful looking for impurities
I'm buried in the lies trying to live my life truthfully
I sail my ship alone and I'm still having mutinies
I'm wearing a disguise hiding from the phonies
I'm hiding from myself, but I'm scared of being lonely
My world's like a cell God created just to hold me
My life's like a game where my death is the trophy

I'm the spaceman cowboy
Psychedelic psychic
Paranoid schizoid
Counting all my vices
I'm fighting all my blessings
I'm caught up in a crisis
And though my sleep's deathless
My days seem lifeless

Although I keep aging, memories are timeless
I drink to forget, an empty bottle's my reminder
I live for the wisdom and die trying to hide from it
My theories are terminal, my lifestyle's survivalist
I'm weary of science, but slave to the scientist
I dig my own grave, but too afraid to lie in it
Straight from the snake pit into the lion's den
Fighting the beast 'cos it won't let the violence end
Searching for peace in a war-torn environment
Holding the torch that no-one's igniting yet
Walking into darkness, scared 'cos I'm fearless
Fighting with the demons even though they ain't appeared yet
Trying to see it clearly when I've never got a clear head
So far from living yet I'm so scared to greet death
Sure that I'll drown with this strange urge to seek depth
Wisdom's invisible, I'm still trying to see sense
Trapped in procedures we take to gain freedom
Fighting for strength yet way beyond healing
Searching for love even though I can't receive it
Preaching the truth unsure if I believe it

"The madness of a memory which busies itself among forbidden things
While the angel forms became meaningless spectres with heads of flame
Then silence
And stillness
And night
Were the universe"

Trapped in the labyrinth, cold and lonely
A thousand years of nothing eternally control me
The world's like a cell God created just to hold me
My life's like a game where my death is the trophy

Praise Judy clay, we shall not grow weary
Burnt from within, it's the Wickerman theory
Burn burn burn burn burn burn burn burn
