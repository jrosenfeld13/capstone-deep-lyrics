I want nothing but the love of the next stranger who
Walks through that door
I want nothing but to dissolve in the night and to feel
Direction no more

I want nothing, no I want nothing
I want nothing,no I want nothing

I want nothing but to follow you til we can walk no more
I want nothing but to cut away until I find the core
I want nothing, no I want nothing
I want nothing, no I want nothing
I want nothing, no I want nothing
