Blood is flooding my vision
The crash of metal suffocates my hearing
I'm loosing myself
I feel like a dead man
All this biomechanics bypasses my brain
The cement of our survival
Crumbles as if a second lasted a century
Our beloved world is collapsing in front of us
Driving Edaenia's fell
I feel like a dead man
All this biomechanics bypasses my brain
With a child's purity
With the strength of ten armies: Saviour, you were our chalice
Why did you decide to take us on
My faith in you was blind
Work was guiding the reconstruction, if only...
You hadn't been held hostage
By OM's legion, that's a lie
Total Slander!! Men's exploitation won't exist in twenty fifth century
There were no weapons
You tell us to make some
To faith
Your answer is madness
With a child's purity
With the strength of ten armies: Saviour, you were our chalice
Why did you decide to drive us to death
With a child's purity
With the strength of ten armies: Saviour, you were our chalice
Why did you decide who your murderers should be
My faith in you was blind
Work was guiding the reconstruction, if only...
A nation's symbol
I crush with my own hands the seeings that created you
Non humans, fear our sadism
I have nothing left to lose
Brutal rage, my entire being will unleash anathema
No burden will be heavier to carry
Than not to kill our executioner
My tears are for you, Almighty
I set intoxicated on destroying you
Wiped out and disincarnated
Your testament delivers your will of non-existence
Mistake, you're but a mistake
You're asking me to correct it, makes me edgy
Every trick against your machine
Make my neurons implode, make my soul die
