You may be right, you may be wrong, girl
I've been hurtin' much too long, girl
You know, I think I've finally reached the end
You keep tellin' me that guy's just a friend
We've been all through it and you'll do it again
Don't stand there tellin' me, girl, that you're so sorry
Baby, baby, I can't take it no more
Baby, baby, I can't take it no more

You build me up, you let me down, girl
I'm not the kind to fool around, girl
If this guy really means so much more
Than all the happiness that we had before
Just go ahead, girl, and walk out the door
You know I can't go on, I'd rather see you gone
Baby, baby, I can't take it no more
Baby, baby, I can't take it no more

Baby, baby, I can't take it no more
Baby, baby, I can't take it no more
Repeat until fade out
