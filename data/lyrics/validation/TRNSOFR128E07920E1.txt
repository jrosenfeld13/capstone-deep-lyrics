I can see by the hole in your head that you wanna be friends
You're the right one baby

I can tell by the moon in your eyes that you're loved by the tribe
You're the right one baby

Hook you up to the coil of the one who makes time with the sun
And who keeps us pumping
See your mind on the hood of my car, and forever in power
As the world keeps dumping down

We are the only ones

Put the earth in the crook of your arm now
Tease it and and charm it and watch life spray everywhere

I have something more cosmic in mind
It's a warpage of time and it's bliss for everyone

Hook you up to the coil of the one who makes time with the sun
And who keeps us pumping
See your mind on the hood of my car, and forever in power
As the world keeps dumping down

We are the only ones
Oh yeah
Yeah we are the only ones

(What can I say)
(What can I say)
(What can I say)
(What can I say)

We are all here my friend
All dogged all spaced but all so beautiful
We burn that mountain down
And always pump for peace when possible
We bite ourselves and bite our dogs
And stretch the flesh unmovable
We are all here my friends
Alive and spaced but all so beautiful

We are all here my friends
All dead and spaced but all so beautiful
We burn that mountain down
And always pump for peace when possible
We bite ourselves and bite our dogs
And stretch the flesh unmovable
We are all here my friends
Alive and spaced but all so beautiful
