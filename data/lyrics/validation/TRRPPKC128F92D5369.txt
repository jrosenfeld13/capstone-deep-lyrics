The put the chairs out on the lawn
Grandma's got her new dress on
There's fresh flowers on Grandpa's grave
And Junior smells of aftershave
Oh boy, hey hey, it's a national holiday

Everything's ready for the big parade
The mayor's got his place in the shade
We can't till the sun goes down
To lie on a hill at the end of town

While a presidential proclamation
Is blasting out across the nation
And Mad Dog and his band of jerks
Are lighting off the fireworks
Oh boy, hey hey, it's a national holiday
It's a national holiday

So let's all sing the national anthem
Free the hostages, pay the ransom
Raise the flag, lower the taxes
Ban the bomb, bury the hatchet

The chiefs of staff have called a session
A call for an end to armed aggression
They're easing up on covert actions
Appeasing all opposing factions

They communicated with the communists
Pacified the pacifists
Stopped all pain, stopped all sorrow
Real life shall resume tomorrow
Oh boy, hey hey, it's a national holiday
It's a national holiday [x3]
