I came upon my crossroads yesterday
I met her on a ship just west of Eyeball Bay
We ate fish and we listened to some old time rock'n roll
She said "you can call me baby if you let me hold your soul"
But it's because she's wonderful
The guys they look her way
She's some kinda big shot

- Chorus -
She's some kinda wonderful
She makes a mean steak
And she's an' eyeful
My baby she's some kinda wonderful to me
She's some kinda wonderful to me
She's some kinda wonderful
Forget it snowflake she is mine
So you just say she's wonderful
And then be on your way
She's some kinda wonderful you see

We bought a little house on highball way
Great kids, nice home
And a brand new chevrolet
All my neighbors and friends say
The wife is a little bit strange
I know the eyes are freaky
And the horns are there to stay

But it's because she's wonderful
The guys they look her way
She's some kinda big shot

She's some kinda wonderful
She makes a mean steak
And she's an' eyeful
My baby she's some kinda wonderful to me
She's some kinda wonderful to me
She's some kinda wonderful
Forget it snowflake she is mine
So you just say she's wonderful
And then be on your way
She's some kinda wonderful you see

She's some kinda wonderful
She makes a mean steak
And she's an' eyeful
My baby she's some kinda wonderful to me
She's some kinda wonderful to me
She's some kinda wonderful
Forget it snowflake she is mine
So you just say she's wonderful
And then be on your way
She's some kinda wonderful you see
