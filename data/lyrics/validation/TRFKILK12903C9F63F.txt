Hello, how are you doing today
I hope I find you feeling healthy
I'm so glad our paths crossed this time today
On our way into the night
I saying love treats us well keeps us dancing
Baby I love you well our love is sure and find
So why when I approach you my tears they fall like rain
You tell me baby your heart into a thousand pieces dies

Stop only the old and wise with clouded eyes
You can't see what I can see
Blindly throw my faith to the face
Of the next pretty girl to come my way

So here we are all of us stand around
We're leaning heavy on each other
But still we worry what is it lies behind
Staring eyes of on another
Love I come to you you turn me up turn me down
Silly baby I love you so it tears me up inside
Love I come to you my tears they fall like rain
You tell me baby your heart into a thousand pieces dashed

Stop only the old and wise with clouded eyes
You can't see what I can see
Blindly throw my faith to the face
Of the next good thing to come my way

Love running here celebrating and relating
Baby our love is pure our love is pure and fine
So why, when I approach, the tears they fall like rain
You tell me baby your heart into a thousand pieces dashed

Hello, how are you doin' today?
I hope I find you feeling healthy
I'm so glad our paths crossed this time today
On our way into the night
I say its love, its hidin' deep, deep down inside us all
So maybe, we should lift it up above from a deep inside
Love, it's not so tough and you come admit it to
Baby, your heart into a thousand pieces dashed

Stop, only the old and wise, with clouded eyes
You can't see what I can, 'cause I
Blindly throw my faith to the face
Of the next pretty girl to come my way

Here we are all of us stand around
We're leaning heavy on each other
Always wonderin' what is it lies behind
The worried eyes of one another
I believe it's love, it's hidin there, in the shadows in the dark it's
Baby we'll shed a little light and it will shine
Love, when I approach, my tears they fall like rain
'Cause you know baby, my heart's into a thousand pieces dashed

Stop, only the old and wise, with clouded eyes
You can't see what I can, 'cause I
Blindly throw my faith to the face
Of the next good thing to come my way

I say it's love, so share it out, share it fair, but share it liberal
Maybe our thing's a better world than it could be love
But love, when I approach, the tears they fall like rain
You tell me baby, your heart's into a thousand pieces dashed

Stop, only the old and wise, with clouded eyes
You can't see what I can, I
Blindly throw my faith to the face
Of the next good thing to come my way
