Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me singing a prayer for
Someone I really could care for

Then suddenly there appeared before me
The only one my arms could ever hold
Then I heard somebody whisper, "please adore me"
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold

Blue moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
