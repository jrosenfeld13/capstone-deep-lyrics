A black cat moans
When he's burning with a fever
A stray dog howls
When he's lonely in the night
A woman goes crazy
With the thoughts of retribution
But a man starts weeping
When he's sick and tired of life
I keep on dreaming
Dreams of tomorrow
Feel I'm wasting my time
Lighting candles in the wind
Always taking my chances
On the promise of the future
But a heart full of sorrow
Paints a lonely tapestry
The sun is shining
Ooh, but it's raining in my heart
No one understands the heartache
No one feels the pain
No one ever sees the tears
When you're cryin' in the rain
When you're cryin' in the rain
Cryin' in the rain
I can never deny
All the sweet things I've tasted
Though I've been mistreated
I keep coming back for more, more, more
I know where I'm going
There's no hope for absolution
I can't seem to separate
The good times from the bad
The sun is shining
Ooh baby, it's still raining in my heart
No one understands the heartache
No one feels the pain
No one ever sees the tears
When you're cryin' in the rain
When you're cryin' in the rain
When you're cryin' in the rain
When you're cryin' in the rain
No, no, no!
The sun is shining
But, it's raining in my heart
No one understands the heartache
No one feels the pain
No one ever sees the tears
When you're cryin' in the rain
When you're cryin' in the rain
When you're cryin' in the rain
When you're cryin' in the rain
Cryin' in the rain
Cryin' in the rain
