So are we lost or do we know?
Which direction we should go?
Sit around and wait for someone to take our hands and lead the way?
Cause every day we're getting older
And every day we all get colder
We're sick of waiting for our answers (Our answers)

Wake up, Wake up, Wake up
Yeah I'm so tired of waiting, waiting for us to
Wake up, Wake up, Wake up
Yeah I'm so sick of waiting, for us to make a move

Are we meant to take the pain?
Should we sit around and wait?
Are we being saved, or was that another lie you made to make us hate?
Cause every day we're getting older
And every day we all get colder
We're sick of waiting for our answers (Our answers)

Wake up, Wake up, Wake up
Yeah I'm so tired of waiting, waiting for us to
Wake up, Wake up, Wake up
Yeah I'm so sick of waiting, for us to make a move
Wake up, Wake up, Wake up
And we will never lose
Wake up, Wake up, Wake up
It's time to make a move
Wake up, Wake up, Wake up
And we will never lose
Wake up, Wake up, Wake up
It's time to make a move

It's not enough, To let it rust
Wait until, It's over...

We're sick of waiting for our answers
(Our answers, Our answers...)

Wake up, Wake up, Wake up
Yeah I'm so tired of waiting, waiting for us to
Wake up, Wake up, Wake up
Yeah I'm so sick of waiting, for us to make a move
Wake up, Wake up, Wake up
And we will never lose
Wake up, Wake up, Wake up
It's time to make a move
Wake up, Wake up, Wake up
And we will never lose
Wake up, Wake up, Wake up
Oh, make a move
(Move, move, move, move etc.)
