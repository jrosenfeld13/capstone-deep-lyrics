[Verse 1:]
Oooh.....

This will be an everlasting love
This will be the one I've waited for
This will be the first time anyone has loved me

I'm so glad you found me in time
And I'm so glad that you recrefied my mind
This will be an everlasting love for me

[Verse 2:]
Loving you is some kind of wonderful
Because you showed me just how much you care
You've given me the thrill of a lifetime
And made me believe you've got more thrills to spare, oh

This will be an everlasting love
Oh, yes
It will now

[Verse 3:]
You brought a lot of a sunshine in to my life
You filled me with happiness I never knew
You gave me more joy then I ever dreamed of
And no one, no one can take the place of you

This will be you and me
Yes, sir-ee
Eternally

Hugging and squeezing
And kissing and pleasing
Together forever throughever whatever
Yeah, yeah yeah you and me

So long as I'm living true love
I'll be giving to you
I'll be serving
'Cause you're so deserving

Hey, you're so deserving
You're so deserving
Yeah, yeah yeah

Whoooaaah

[Repeat 18x]
Love

From now on
