[Verse 1]
I hope youre doing fine out there without me
Cause Im not doing so good without you
The things I thought youd never know about me
Were the things I guess you always understood

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So how could I have been so blind for all these years?
Guess I only see the truth through all this fear
And living without you

[Chorus]
And everything I have in this world
And all that Ill ever be
It could all fall down around me
Just as long as I have you
Right here by me

[Verse 2]
I cant take another day without you
Cause baby, I could never make it on my own
Ive been waiting so long, just to hold you
And to be back in your arms where I belong

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Sorry I cant always find the words to say
But everything Ive ever known gets swept away
Inside of your love

[Chorus]
And everything I have in this world
And all that Ill ever be
It could all fall down around me
Just as long as I have you
Right here by me

[Bridge]
As the days grow long I see
Time is standing still for me
When youre not here

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Sorry I cant always find the words to say
But everything Ive ever known gets swept away
Inside of your love

[Chorus]
And everything I have in this world
And all that Ill ever be
It could all fall down around me
Just as long as I have you
Right here by me
And everything I have in this world
And all that Ill ever be
It could all fall down around me
Just as long as I have you
Right here by me
