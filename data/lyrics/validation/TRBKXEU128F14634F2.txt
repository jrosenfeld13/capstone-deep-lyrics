[Intro]
The sign said underground
The train went over land
They threw my body down
It felt too good to make a stand
The earth shook the devils hand

[Verse 1]
Went along for the ride
I'm aware of the plans
Underneath inside
I have to satisfy my man
The earth shook the devils hand

[Interlude]
And, oh, she was intense
Every movement grand
The passion was immense
I swear i felt my soul expand
The earth shook the devils hand
The earth shook the devil's hand
The earth shook the devil's hand

[Verse 2]
That night it dawned on me
Just how good it really can be
I won't forget that night
It made me who I am
The darkness took the light
It felt too good to give a damn

[Outro]
The sign said underground
The train went over land
They threw my body down
It felt too good to make a stand
The earth shook the devil's hand
The earth shook the devil's hand
The earth shook the devil's hand
