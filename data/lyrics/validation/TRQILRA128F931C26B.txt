Keep your friends close, your enemy closer
A kiss on the cheek from a punk-ass poser
Ah, head is in his arm
Pay back time, I come and deliver
I'm a golden handed unicorn killer
There's bounty, bounty on that horn
Turn up the sun and things get frantic
Alone in the dark a celebrity panics
A rainbow, rainbow's turning black
Easy in my ear, I'm feeling the suction
Kids are in the field with murderous action
Easy puts the weapon in my hand

Easy speaks to me
(So step forward)
Easy speaks to me
(Little warlord)
Easy speaks to me
(So step forward)
Easy Speaks to me
(Little warlord)

I drink rain and piss out acid
Cornflake kid befalls the flaccid
You're weak, got no self-control
I dropped that girl under the alter
That I knew was weird, she wanted a halter
To ride 'cross the purple sky

Easy speaks to me
(So step forward)
Easy speaks to me
(Little warlord)
Easy speaks to me
(So step forward)
Easy Speaks to me
(Little warlord)

Easy speaks to me
(Easy) Easy (Easy) Easy (Easy) Easy
Easy speaks to me
(Easy) Easy (Easy) Easy (Easy) Easy
Easy speaks to me
(Easy) Easy (Easy) Easy (Easy) Easy
Easy speaks to me
(Easy) Easy (Easy) Easy (Easy) Easy
Easy speaks to me
