Hey baby can I call you up?
Don't you wanna party with me?
Don't wanna hear no busy signal
Pick up the phone, it's me (Hello)

Do you wanna ride my motorbike (ah)
Don't you wanna party with me (oh yeah)
Grab it to my hips and hold it tight
Come and pop a willy with me

Electric boogie
Show me on the dancefloor
Electric boogie
Rock your body once for me
Electric boogie
Pump and bounce to this (oh)
Electric boogie
Get on down, to the ground

Get around my fingers through your hair
Don't you wanna party with me? (Uh huh, that's right)
Could I ask you for a kiss?
Get one on this cheek for me

Do you wanna come and fill me up
Don't you wanna party with me? (Where's the party?)
Do you wanna dance on to the twilight?
You wanna get funky with me (Oh baby, let's get funky)

Electric boogie
Show me on the dancefloor
Electric boogie
Rock your body once for me
Electric boogie
Pump and bounce to this (oh)
Electric boogie
Get on down, to the ground

(Bridge)

Electric boogie
Show me on the dancefloor
Electric boogie
Rock your body once for me
Electric boogie
Pump and bounce to this (oh)
Electric boogie
Get on down, to the ground

Electric boogie
Show me on the dancefloor
Electric boogie
Rock your body once for me
Electric boogie
Pump and bounce to this (oh)
Electric boogie
She's so fine, she blow my mind

Electric boogie
Show me on the dancefloor
Electric boogie
Rock your body once for me
Electric boogie
Pump and bounce to this (oh)
Electric boogie
Get on down, to the ground

Electric boogie
Show me on the dancefloor
Electric boogie
Rock your body once for me
Electric boogie
Pump and bounce to this (oh)
Electric boogie
