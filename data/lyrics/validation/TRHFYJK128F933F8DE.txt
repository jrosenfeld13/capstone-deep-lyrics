We stare at the sun, until it blinds us
No room for responsibility
We're too busy buying lies
And this claustrophobia will choke us, every time we try
I've developed a fear for
Everything, a fear for openness

I slowly
Start to hope

As the sky turns red
As the snow melts in our hands
Your tears will lead us in
And keep us warm and safe again (x2)
Try

And I will leave you
With just a word
A word that literally describes everything
