Fader

I'm in transit
Floating stranded on this boat
And I pledge my self allegiance
To a better night sleep at home
And the sweet sweet sun's comin' down hard
The sun's comin' down hard
It burns the bones
So hold a hand for cover
Hold a hand for cover
Hold a hand for cover from harm

Woo oo oo...
Talk don't change a thing
Woo oo oo...
Oh, it's fading fader

Woo oo oo...
Words don't sink it swims
Woo oo oo...
Oh, it's fading fader

Bless this mess
We tried our best
That's all that we can do
While the angels walk
With the lonely ones
In the cold rain to rescue you
And this fable world's comin' down hard
The wall's comin' down hard
On all our homes
So hold a hand for cover
Hold a hand for cover
Hold a hand for cover from harm

Woo oo oo...
Talk don't change a thing
Woo oo oo...
Oh, it's fading fader

Woo oo oo...
Words don't sink it swims
Woo oo oo...
Oh, it's fading fader...

Woo oo oo...
Talk don't change a thing
Oh, it's fading fader
(I'm in transit)
Words don't sink, they swims
(Ah, sweet as a moment, be that it may)
Oh, it's fading fader
Oh, it's fading fader
