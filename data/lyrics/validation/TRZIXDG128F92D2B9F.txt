Stayed away too long and I'm wonderin' why
Thought of all the reasons to make you change your mind
Thought of all the things that we did in the past
And still I'm wonderin' baby did I went too fast

I had eighteen arms to hold you
I had eighteen lips to kiss you
I had eighteen ways to love you
And still I'm wonderin' why you left me

Alright baby, c'mon back
