[Verse 1: Phrase]
You don't really wanna take the risk
A raw kind of journey on a shaky ship
And take the shift no one else wants to take
Work late, no sleep, trying to calculate
If the winds are right and the tide is out
Guess the only way I know is just finding out
And grinding out until I'm far out at sea
Far out, this is even far out for me
But I thrive on it, bring it on, pump the heat
I'm like Indiana Jones meets Pistol Pete
At the front of a train, cold, shovelling shit
'Til the flames so big, no smothering this
If the brakes give way, full steam ahead
My dreams are big, my dreams are red
My dreams were born in the music box
So they don't stand still when the music stops

[Chorus: Phrase & Jade Macrae]
Hey Mister Robot
Give me back my music box
Wind me up, wind me up
Set me free, let me be
Hey Mister Robot
Give me back my music box
Wind me up, wind me up
Don't let that music stop

[Refrain: Jade Macrae]
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Stop Mister Robot
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Give me back my music box
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Stop Mister Robot
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Give me back my music box

[Verse 2: Phrase]
Nah, robots I don't talk to them
And if I did I would only start talking when
They all quit trying to test if my lights are on
I got a sixteen gigabyte iPod on
And it's loaded with the brand new beat from Phazes
So I don't need your bullshit to get me places
Go stick your little job and your special papers
Back where they came from, yep catch your man
I'm on the next flight out, next up Japan
To meet the man who made my music box
And yeah, I bet he got a dream just like me
Uh, I bet he move like lightning
Never said yes when he thought like no was right
Took a left when the rest told go to right
So hold tight to the dream in your music box
So we don't stand still if the music stops

[Chorus: Phrase & Jade Macrae]
Hey Mister Robot
Give me back my music box
Wind me up, wind me up
Set me free, let me be
Hey Mister Robot
Give me back my music box
Wind me up, wind me up
Don't let that music stop

[Refrain: Jade Macrae]
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Stop Mister Robot
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Give me back my music box
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Stop Mister Robot
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Give me back my music box

[Outro: Jade Macrae]
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Stop, stop, stop, stop
