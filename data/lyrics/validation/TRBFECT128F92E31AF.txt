The dawn is breaking, my head is aching
I feel rejected, it's cristal clear
I'm so hang over, dont want this to be over
I am addicted, it's cristal clear
(It's cristal clear)

I'm losing everything, everything dear to me
I'm losing everything, everything I want to be

I'm losing everything, everything dear to me
I'm losing everything, everything I want to be

The night is inviting, theres no use in fighting
I play my role, it's cristal clear
I want it, I hate it, if I need it I'll take it
Losing control, it's cristal clear
(It's cristal clear)

I'm losing everything, everything dear to me
I'm losing everything, everything I want to be

I'm losing everything, everything dear to me
I'm losing everything, everything I want to be

Everything I want to be
Everything I want to be
Everything I want to be

I'm losing everything, everything dear to me
I'm losing everything, everything I want to be

I'm losing everything, everything dear to me
I'm losing everything, everything I want to be

I'm losing everything, everything dear to me
I'm losing everything, everything I want to be

Everything I want to be
Everything I want to be
