It's easy to see why
Cause I look in those green eyes
And I fall in love with her
All over again
Yeah, but this can be dangerous
Cause those green eyes seem to say yes
So easily & to so many men

(chorus)
Well I know I've got a jealous heart

A jealous mind
But I'm trying to keep a hold of my girl

Now loving so caring
But sometimes she's daring
And those big green eyes
They set you up for a fall
Now I'm tryin' to keep her
But I just can't reach her
That with me it's all
Or nothing at all

(repeat chorus)
