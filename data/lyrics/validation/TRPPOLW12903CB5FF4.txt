[Verse 1]
Wasn't like me to fall in love
That's just the way that I was
But now when I feel you holding me
Something inside just tells me
You've gotten to this heart of mine
And I know its true 'cause darling, I'm
Darling, I'm starting to find

[Chorus:]
I'm getting used to you
Ooh, and I'm loving every single thing about you
I'm getting used to you
And I could never get used to living without you

[Verse 2]
Didn't think that a love could mean that much
But you've sure changed my mind with your touch
Never knew that my heart could need you so
Now I know that these arms can't let you go
No, they wouldn't even try
'Cause I'm sure that you're the one that I
Oh, one that I need in my life

[Chorus:]
I'm getting used to you
Ooh, and I'm loving every single thing about you
I'm getting used to you
And I could never get used to living without you

[Bridge:]
You've gotten to this heart of mine
And I know it's true
'Cause darling, I'm
Oh, darling I'm starting to find
You're the one I need in my life

[Chorus:]
I'm getting used to you
Ooh, and I'm loving every single thing about you
I'm getting used to you
And I could never get used to living without you

[Outro]
Ain't no living without me loving you
Ooh
Getting used to you
Getting used to you
Darling, darling
Getting used to you, baby, yeah
