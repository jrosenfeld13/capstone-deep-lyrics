As I awake
I wake into the brightest of reality sun
I chased it back
The morning brings goodbye and it was already gone...

Twas black and white
A feast and then the dance was something beautiful
Under the lights
The morning brings the pain of what's impossible...

I dreamt you married me
I kissed you and began our own eternity
I dreamt you married me
Yeah and then I woke up in reality
And it was just a dream
I know that forever is too much to ask
It was the best dream i've ever had
And I will leave it at that...
