I know it all seems like we're losing our minds
We got shampoo and warfare all over the headlines
I know it's all hype and violence we see
And they never seem to mention the likes of you and me

I know it seems like we're losing our minds
And things ain't gonna get better
I know it seems like we're losing our minds
But we can't change this, it's just the way it is

Close your eyes, it's all just noises in your head
Close your eyes, it's all just noises in your head

You and her can move mountains
All you give, but he can't buy
And the danger keeps on coming
But it's alright 'cuz we got each other

I know it seems like we're losing our minds
And things ain't gonna get better
I know it seems like we're losing our minds
But we can't change this, it's just the way it is

Close your eyes, it's all just noises in your head
Close your eyes, it's all just noises in your head
Close your eyes, it's all just noises in your head
Close your eyes, it's all just noises in your head

It's all just noises in your head
It's all just...
It's all just noises in your head
It's all just...
