[Verse 1]
She always shows up when I'm up
But she never shows up when I'm down
But she's under arrest
'cause I might guess
The Sheriff of Hong Kong
Then she goes up in a flash
I bite the end of her sash

[Refrain]
Then I'm long gone
To Hong Kong Kong

[Verse 2]
She never makes a taste mistake
She's the Sheriff of Hong Kong
Now I'm the Sheriff of Hong Kong
Now she's the Sheriff of Hong Kong

[Refrain]
We're long gone gone
To Hong Kong Kong
Whoa I'm long gone
To Hong Kong Kong
Long gone gone
To Hong Kong Kong
