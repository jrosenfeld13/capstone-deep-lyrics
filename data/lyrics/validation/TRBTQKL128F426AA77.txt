Hang around, Willie Boy
Don't you raise the sails anymore
It's for sure, I've spent my whole life at sea
And I'm pushin' age seventy-three
Now there's only one place that is meant for me

Oh, to be home again
Down in old Virginny
With my very best friend
They call him Ragtime Willie
W're gonna soothe away the rest of our years
We're gonna put away all of our fears
That big rockin' chair 'won't' go nowhere

Slow down, Willie Boy
Your heart's gonna give right out on you
It's true, and I believe I know what we should do
Turn the stern and point to shore
The seven seas won't carry us no more

Oh, to be home again
Down in old Virginny
With my very best friend
They call him Ragtime Willie
I can't wait to sniff that air
Dip'n snuff, I won't have no care
That big Rockin' Chair won't go nowhere

Hear the sound, Willie Boy
The Flyin' Dutchman's on the reef
It's my belief
We've used up all our time
This hill's to steep to climb
And the days that remain ain't worth a dime

Oh, to be home again
Down in old Virginny
With my very best friend
They call him Ragtime Willie
Would-a-been nice just t'see the folks
Listen once again to the stale jokes
That big Rockin' Chair won't go nowhere

I can hear something calling on me
(And you know where I want to be)
Oh Willie don't you hear that sound
(Oh to be home again down in old Virginny)
I just want to get my feet back on the ground
(Oh to be home again down in old Virginny)
I'd love to see my very best friend
(They call him Rag-time Willie)
I believe old rockin chair's got me
