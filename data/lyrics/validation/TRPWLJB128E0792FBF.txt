Wanna be young - The rest of my life
Never say no - Try anything twice
'Til the angels come - And ask me to fly
Gonna be 18 'til I die - 18 'til I die

Can't live forever - That's wishful thinkin'
Who ever said that - Must've been drinkin'
Don't wanna grow up - I don't see why
I couldn't care less if time flies by

18 'til I die - Gonna be 18 'til I die
Yeah - It sure feels good to be alive
Someday I'll be 18 goin' on 55 - 18 'til I die
Ohh right

Anyway - I just wanna say
Why bother with what happened yesterday
It's not my style - I live for the minute
If ya wanna stay young get both feet in it - 18 'til I die

A little bit of this - A little bit of that
A little bit of everything - Gotta get on track
It's not how ya look - It's what ya feel inside
I don't care when - I don't need to know why

18 'til I die - Gonna be 18 'til I die
Yeah - It sure feels good to be alive
Someday I'll be 18 goin' on 55 - 18 'til I die
Yeah - There's one thing for sure - I'm sure gonna try

Yeah - Don't worry about the future - Forget about the past
Gonna have a ball - Yeah - We're gonna have a blast
Gonna make it last - Hey

18 'til I die - Gonna be 18 'til I die
Yeah - It sure feels good to be alive
Someday I'll be 18 goin' on 55 - 18 'til I die
Gonna be - 18 'til I die - All right!
I'm gonna be 18' til I die
