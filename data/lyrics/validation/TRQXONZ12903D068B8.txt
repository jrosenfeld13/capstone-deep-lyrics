I used to follow you
I used to lean on you
You told me what to do
When I was feeling blue
I thought you spoke the truth
But now you've lost me too
I don't care, what you know
Don't you dare, say hello
All alone, got no pain
On my own, feeling sane
I've come to realize
You've got me mesmerized
You almost wrecked my life
But God was on my side
