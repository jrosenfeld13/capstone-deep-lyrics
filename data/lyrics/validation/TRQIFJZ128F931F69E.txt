Wild wild women like to have a good time
Wild wild women like to have a good time
Wild wild girlfriends have to lose their minds
Wild girls hoop and holler and yell oh-wee
Wild girls hoop and holler and yell oh-wee!
They can scream and break down, but it don't move me
Wild girls dig me, for they love a cool one
Wild girls dig me, they love a cool one
To go home to, but I've had my fun

Well I can romp and stomp
Well I can rock and roll
Well I can do the bop
Well I can thrill my soul
Well I can drink their wine
They all wanna be mine
Well now baby-baby, oh can't you see
Well baby-baby, oh can't you see
I want a young girl to make love to me
(Git that!)

Say, all my good friends, they wonder how
Well all my good friends, they wonder how
How I make these young girls go wild
Well I just shake my head
Well I just wink my eye
Well I just whisper "baby"
Well I just heeve and sigh
Well I just romp and stomp
Then I leave 'em high and dry
Wild wild women, I must confess
Wild wild women, I must confess
I wanna tame one and make love my way
