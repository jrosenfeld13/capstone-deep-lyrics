It's the first glance just for you alone
It's the last dance before the journey home
It's a lesson to learn to see the chance is yours to take

It's the first kiss, hold her in your arms
Oh the nearness, falling with her charms
It's a lesson, to learn to see the choice is yours to make

Look my way
There's a smile on my face
Yesterday
Just another time and place
Don't delay
Cos the joy is in the chasing of the dream

It's the first break, spinning of the wheel
It's the handshake, closing of the deal
It's a lesson, to learn to see the chance is yours to take

And I've lived to learn, in love there's always pain
So I wait in line, it's coming round again
Got to take the chance or you'll never win the game
And the world will pass you by

It's the first day, hear the baby cry
Such a short way, before we say goodbye
It's a lesson, to learn to see that time is all it takes
