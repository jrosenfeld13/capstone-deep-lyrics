Maybe you don't know
What is joy or sorrow
You feel so abandoned
Suppress your feelings

That's the legacy of destiny
I don't know if you'll find out the truth
The peace in your heart

The realm of fantasy
To the world's end
In all my life confronting the danger

Your heart is like a frozen half light atmosphere
A lonely soul that smoulder from the thirst of suffering
Your heart is like a frozen half light atmosphere
One symbol of a strange concealed lightning

All my being that never fall down
Unharmed facing the obstacles of life
For the risk of an everlasting idea
Chronicle of the pure
This cosmos is so fucking hard

The wolves always return for their quarry
Entering the game of life
All the innocence is gone away

Your heart is like a frozen half light atmosphere
A lonely soul that smoulder from the thirst of suffering
Your heart is like a frozen half light atmosphere
One symbol of a strange concealed lightning

Your heart is like a frozen half light atmosphere
A lonely soul that smoulder from the thirst of suffering
Your heart is like a frozen half light atmosphere
One symbol of a strange concealed lightning
