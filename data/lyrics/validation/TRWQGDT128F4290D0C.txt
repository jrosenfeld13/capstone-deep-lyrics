You think that money is everything
And yet it's anybody's Spring
Go make a fortune, become a king
And still it's anybody's Spring

And if you flash a bank roll
Do you suppose the brook would care?
Or that a rose would say
'There goes a millionaire!'
It's more than diamonds around a ring

Because it's anybody's Spring
You may be born with the silver spoon
And yet it's anybody's moon
You couldn't buy a ticket

To hear the first robin sing
It's free because
It's anybody's Spring
