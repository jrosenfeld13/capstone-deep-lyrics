Three in the morning
Tossin n turnin its late
Just can't rest waiting for the phone to ring
Will you call ring my phone
Girl I hope you did not forget
I can't sleep and I can't eat
And I won't until I hear your voice

When will you call

Three days ago
Rolled over to an empty bed
And I went to the bathroom
And your toothbrush wasn't there
Wheres your clothes
And wheres your shoes
Girl what would I do without you
I can't sleep and I can't eat
And I won't until I hear your voice

When will you call

No notice no letter
You just packed your shit and left
Girl I deserved better
I treated you like no one else
How could you
You know I loved you
And I thought this love was truer

Now we're threw
What Im gonna do
Gotta start a new life without you (repeat)

When will you call
Been rackin my brain all night and all day
Waitin for your call
Waitin for your call
Waitin for your call
Baby waitin for ya
To just say the word in my ear
Let me know that you're here forever
Baby baby baby call me
When you get a chance call me
Call me call
When will you call
(ad libs)
When will you call
Now we're threw
And Im without you
