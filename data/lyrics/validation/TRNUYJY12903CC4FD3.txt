I don't care what you say
Nothing's gonna change me anyway
I don't care what you say about me
Look inside what you see
Ain't the kind of man I wanna be
Look inside and what you see is not me

I'm alright, you won't break me
I'm not a slave to conventional ways
I'm alright, you won't shake me
Time left a mark here that you can't erase

People come, people go
Is it sincere or just a show
People come, people go, you don't know
