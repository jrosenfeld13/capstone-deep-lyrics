Cut, cut the, cut, cut the mic range...

In, in the mix

Everytime I think of you
It always seems I do
Everytime I have you
I thought you'd understood

Everytime I think of you
It always seems I do
Everytime I have you
I thought you'd understood

Everytime I think of you
It always seems I do
Everytime I have you
I thought you'd understood

Everytime I think of you
It always seems I do
Everytime I have you
I thought you'd understood

Drop the bass

Drop the bass

Cut, cut the, cut, cut the mic range...

Everytime I think of you
It always seems I do
Everytime I have you
I thought you'd understood

Everytime I think of you
It always seems I do
Everytime I have you
I thought you'd understood

Drop the bass

Everytime I think of you
It always seems I do
Everytime I have you
I thought you'd understood

Everytime I think of you
It always seems I do
Everytime I have you
I thought you'd understood

Cut the mic range
Drop the bass
