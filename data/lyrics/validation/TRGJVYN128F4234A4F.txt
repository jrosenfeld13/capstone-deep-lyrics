Looking at the pictures in my mind
I saw it
I knew it was wrong but I chose to ignore it
Got one thought left
I got one frame of mind
I got one good reason to f*ck myself blind
A little whisky
A little porn
I'm logging on and now the fun has begun
I got one chance left
I got no friends left
And I don't care less
And I don't care less
I wish I knew
How you were feeling
I think I know you
But you don't know me
I wish I knew
What you were thinking
I think I know you
But you don't know me
Taken down the pictures of my family
I don't want to know them
They don't want to know me
My girlfriends left
She got so upset
Cos I wear her dress
When I show for the strangers
I'm thinking too much
And I'm drinking too much
Nicotine is a crutch
But it helps with the shaking
I got one chance left
I got no friends left
And I don't care less
And I don't care less
And there's one dance left
And my brains a mess
And I don't give a f*ck
Cos I don't care less
I wish I knew
How you were feeling
I think I know you
But you don't know me
I wish I knew
What you were thinking
I think I know you
But you don't know me
Live in a world of make believe
And every day is a fantasy
And nobody ever talks to me
I don't care cos the only person that matters
Is me
Everybody is laughing at me
Nobody ever talks to me
There's nothing left..I might as well be dead
