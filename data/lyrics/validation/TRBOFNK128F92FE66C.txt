I closed the door
She stole the key
I gave her pearls
I washed her feet
I said "My love,"
She was asleep
Dreaming of
Other things

She's going to turn the light out
Close your eyes, let it be
She's going to turn the light out
Time is out on me

Carry on
In restless speech
That we'd belong
We long to be
Inside someone
Inside of me
And all my wrong
Be left at sea

She's going to turn the light out
Close your eyes, let it be
She's going to turn the light out
Time is out on me

She's going to turn the light out
Close your eyes, boy, let it be
She's going to turn the light out
Time is out on me
