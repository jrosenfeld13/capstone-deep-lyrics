[Verse 1]
Hey man, oh leave me alone you know
Hey man, oh Henry, get off the phone, I gotta
Hey man, I gotta straighten my face
This mellow thighed chick just put my spine out of place
Hey man, my schooldays insane
Hey man, my work's down the drain
Hey man, well she's a total blam-blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she... then she...

[Chorus]
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight...she's all right

[Verse 2]
Hey man, Henry, don't be unkind, go away
Hey man, I can't take you this time, no way
Hey man, droogie don't crash here
There's only room for one and here she comes, here she comes

[Chorus]
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight...she's all right
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight...she's all right

[Outro]
A Suffragette City, a Suffragette City
I'm back on Suffragette City, I'm back on Suffragette City
Ooo, Suffraggete city, ooo, Suffragette City
Oooh-how, Suffragette City, oooh-how, Suffragette City, oooh-how
Suffragette
Ohhh, wham bam, thank you Ma'am!
A Suffragette City, a Suffragette City
Quite all right
A Suffragette City
Too fine
A Suffragette City, ooh, a Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City, oh my Suffragette City
Oh, Suffragette
Suffragette!
