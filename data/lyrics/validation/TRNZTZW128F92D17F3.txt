I'd love to comb your hair
Your hair is such a mess
Just take off that dress
I'd love to comb your hair

I don't like my hair neat
I don't like my hair neat
I don't like my hair neat
I don't like my hair neat

Just take off your shoes
Just take off your shoes
You've nothing left to lose
Just take off your shoes

The shoes stay on my feet (on my feet)
The shoes stay on my feet (on my feet)
The shoes stay on my feet (on my feet)
The shoes stay on my feet

What's that sound?
I like that sound
I love that sound
It's the sound of my shoes

What's that sound?
I like that sound
I love that sound
It's the sound of my shoes

I'd like to hold your hand
Wearing my brand new gloves
This must be real love
I'd love to hold your hand

Those gloves don't touch my skin
Those gloves don't touch my skin
Those gloves don't touch my skin
Those gloves don't touch my skin

I'd love to do your nails
Before someone gets hurt
Don't be such a flirt
I'd love to do those nails

These nails have served me well
These nails have served me well
These nails have served me well
These nails have served me well

What's that sound?
I like that sound
I love that sound
It's the sound of my shoes

What's that sound?
I like that sound
I love that sound
It's the sound of my shoes
