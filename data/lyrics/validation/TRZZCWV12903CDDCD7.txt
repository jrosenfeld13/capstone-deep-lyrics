Something about this is precious, Something about this is sad
Something about this is better, Than I've ever had
Hard and lean, You know what I mean?
How do the roots become tangled? Why does the spirit grow tired?
Where is the key to your kingdom? Yes that's my desire

CHORUS:
There are those who live to count the cost
And then those who count themselves content
I see heaven wrapped up in a box
It is you come back to love again, In a dream, This living dream

Up in a heap I'm not bothered, Down in the dumps I'm okay
Here in my heart you're the best road, That I'll ever take, I'm serene yeh

CHORUS:
There are those who live to take the chance
And then more who find themselves content
I see heaven mapped out in advance
It is you and that's my journeys end, In a dream, This living dream

I'm trying to hang on to the essence, I'm feeling more faint by the day
It took such a long time to get it, I don't want to see it erased

CHORUS:
There are those who live to count the cost
And then more who count themselves content
I see heaven wrapped up in a box
It is you come back to love again, In a dream, This living dream
This living dream
