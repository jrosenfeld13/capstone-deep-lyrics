(SOLO - Carmelo)

Caught in the whirls of time
Cold winds bring me to timeless shores
Shattering, flowing down grain by grain
By the sandglasses of the past

An innate memory
An anxieting deja-vu

The unconscious awareness
Of the error we are
The unconscious awareness
Of the exception we are in the universe

(SOLO - Carmelo, Antonio)

We are alone
