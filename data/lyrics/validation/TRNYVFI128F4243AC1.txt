No government is a way of life
No government means to trust your friends
I know who I am and you know who you are

If everybody knew what they wanted
There'd be nothing, nothing left
People would do what they wanted
And there'd be no government

There'd be no government
There'd be no government
People would do what they wanted
And there'd be no government

There'd be no government
There'd be no government
People would do what they wanted
And there'd be no government

Life has me tempting, refreshing me
Making me stretch
My body is flowing and happy
And feeling refreshed

My choices, believe me, are infinite easy
Exciting and mystical choices before me
They tell me my life is a journey in no government

If everybody lived in their bodies
We'd have so much, so much time
Touching would be such a pass-time
And we'd have such lazy days

We'd have such lazy days
For we'd kiss them away
People would worship eachother
And we'd have loose, lazy ways

No government is an easy time
No government is an exciting life
We'd work for ourselves
And we'd love for ourselves
And for no government

There'd be no suffering
There'd be no government
People would see and let them be
And we'd have no government

There'd be no government
There'd be no government
People will see and let them be
And will be no government

No government is a way of life. (7x)
