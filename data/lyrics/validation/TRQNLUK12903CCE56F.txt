Holyroller, mind controller
Suspicion on the faces of the newborn
Governor
Governor of our states of complacency
Blood is thick but oil is thicker
Hustler, guzzler with stamina
Fact denier, death defier
Legitimizer of dodgy braggadocio
I don't want no heroes
Cause someday you see the wire
And the luster luster-lacking
To their building leaping
As they tire
Bonds and bondage
Shacks and shackles and dreams deferred
Systematic attacks
And roadmaps to nowhere
Murder music, music to murder by
Hardwire, we're hardwired
To build it up and smash it down again
Hardwired
To raise it up and raze it down again
Hardwired
Psychic shrapnel
The ruin in me
I don't want no heroes
Cause someday you see the wire
And the luster luster-lacking
To their building leaping
As they tire
Redefinitions, non-recrimination
A legalized hitlist
Dodging bullets
Outrunning bullets like daddy mention
Dodging bullets
Troubler, tumbler, bumbler
Kicking and screaming
Into a century of truth
Its a standard behaviour, standard behaviour...
I don't want no heroes
Cause someday you see the wire
Someday you see the wire
Cause they tire, they tire
