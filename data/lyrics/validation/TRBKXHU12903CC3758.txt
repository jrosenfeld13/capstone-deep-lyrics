Don't look out at me
From behind your blinds
Come on, now and see
What I am made of
I know you're pretty
And I can feel high
And I can do
Something with you

Neighbour, neighbour
Neighbour, neighbour
Neighbour, neighbour
Think I love you
Neighbour, neighbour
Neighbour, neighbour
Neighbour, neighbour
Think I love you

Looking at you
Oh, I can feel high
Looking at you
Do you feel my eyes?
Looking at you
Oh, I can feel high
Looking at you
Baby, do you feel my eyes?

Neighbour, neighbour
Neighbour, neighbour
Neighbour, neighbour
Think I love you
Neighbour, neighbour
Neighbour, neighbour
Neighbour, neighbour
Think I love you

Don't look out at me
From behind your eyes
Come on, now and see
You may just change your mind
Don't look out at me
From behind your eyes
Come on, now and see
You may change your mind

Neighbour, neighbour
Neighbour, neighbour
Neighbour, neighbour
Think I love you
Neighbour, neighbour
Neighbour, neighbour
Neighbour, neighbour
Think I love you
