Why?
You change yourself
Into something different for no one
Else's but the whole world's expectations

You dug yourself
Real deep this time
So lose the shovel
You dug yourself
Real deep this time
So listen here

Lean on this crutch
Or be trampled

This filthy world
Is what we are left with

Try turning this around

I just look back
At the filthy world
And I bow down
Cry out

Love is reflection
Painted deep
Drowning in your own
Self-reflections

Drowning in your own
Disconnected reflections

We're all torn from this
Disconnected reflections
