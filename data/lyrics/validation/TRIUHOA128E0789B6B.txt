Take love, get love
You never give any in return
Baby, how you'll have to learn

You're really hurtin' me
With your two-way love affairs
Baby, I don't even care

So you've gone and left me, I don't mind
There are many more around like you
Baby, don't deceive me, I'm not lyin'
Now I know exactly what to do

And I will take love, get love
And I won't give any in return
Baby, how you'll have to learn

So you've gone and left me, I don't mind
I will find another girl like you
Do you think you'll make me break down and cry?
I will let you go without even a sigh

And then I'll take love, get love
And never give any in return
Baby, how you'll have to learn
Baby, how you'll have to learn
