I want to be on that
White capped mountain peak
Above the lake above my station
A moving carriage
The perfect marriage
Of like apart from destination

Ringing all the bells
Down at the white hotel
Tonight

I want to write the letters
Of persecution
To someone I don't know who doesn't know me
I want to be the dust
Inside a vacuum
An icecube frozen in the melting sea

Ringing all the bells
Down at the white hotel
Ringing all the bells
Down at the white hotel

Tonight
Tonight

Ringing all the bells
Down at the white hotel
Ringing all the bells
Down at the white hotel
Tonight
Tonight

Ringing all the bells
Down at the white hotel
Ringing all the bells
Down at the white hotel
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
