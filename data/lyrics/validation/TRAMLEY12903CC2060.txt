Save your S.O.S
If you wanna know
Lost a food contest
Cashed in your bones
On the way home

I'll hold you up when you fall down
Hold you up when you fall down
This isn't just the way you were
It's how you're bound

Swear you could not say
It's not the same
Just get through the day
Not ashamed
What it betrayed

Hold you up when you fall down
Hold you up when you fall down
This isn't just the way you were
It's how you're bound

Hold you up when you fall down
Hold you up when you fall down
This isn't just the way you were
It's how you're bound

Hold you up when you fall down
Hold you up when you fall down
This isn't just the way you were
It's how you're bound
This isn't just the way you were
It's how you're bound
