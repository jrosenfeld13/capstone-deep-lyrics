(Verse 1)
Drive fast, don't crash, make your money, make it last
Hang tight, kick back, prepare yourself for the attack-
Buy low, sell high, take your pills, tell your lies
Fake your tan, wear a tie
Go to the gym you'll never die!

(Bridge)
And that's the way to go!
And that's the way to go-to go!

(Chorus)
Fake it baby - They won't even know!
You can make it
Cos everybody knows that's the way to go
[Uh huh!]
Cos everybody knows that's the way to go

(Verse 2)
Tune in, drop out, raise your voice, never shout
Find your true love on the couch, this is what it's all about
Change your face, keep your name, keep it real don't play the game?
Don't you know they're all the same ? Don't you know they're all the same?

(Bridge)
[Oh!]
And that's the way to go
And that's the way to go-to go!

(Chorus)
Fake it baby - They won't even know!
You can make it
Cos everybody knows that's the way to go
Fake it baby - They won't even know!
You can make it
Cos everybody knows that's the way to go

(Verse 3)
Dig deep, fly low, celebrate a TV show
Raise the stakes, drop the pressure, happiness you'll never measure
Bite your tongue, pay the man, time to start your five year plan
Holiday in Vietnam, then blow a kiss to Uncle Sam

(Bridge)
And that's the way to go
And that's the way to go-to go!

(Chorus)
Fake it baby - They won't even know!
You can make it
Cos everybody knows that's the way to go
Everybody knows that's the way to go
[Uh huh!]
That's the way to go
Cos everybody knows that's the way to go
And that's the way to go-to go!

(Reprise)
Buy low, sell high, take your pills, tell your lies
Fake your tan, wear a tie
Go to the gym you'll never die!
