Dave Cairns)

Standing in the shadows
Where the in-crowd meet
We're all dressed up for the evening
We hate the punk elite (who are the punk elite?)
So take me to your leader
Because its time you realised...

CHORUS

That this is the time
This is the time for action (time for action)
This is the time to be seen (time to be seen)
This is the time for action
Time to be seen

They can laugh in our face
Cos we know we're right
Looking good's the answer
And living by night
So take me to your leader
Because its time you realised...

REPEAT CHORUS

Look at Sweet Julia
Speeding on the late night train
They're laughing at the way she dresses
Too smart and clean
But she don't care
Because she know's she's right
And you know we're only two steps away

REPEAT CHORUS AS LIB TO FADE
