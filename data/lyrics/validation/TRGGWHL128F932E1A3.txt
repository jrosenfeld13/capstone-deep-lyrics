Stay
Close the door and stay
Tell the world to go away
And stay

Sleep
Shut your eyes and go to sleep
There's nothing here that won't keep
Sleep

Ask me if I understand
Wondering how I can
I do
Even when I don't

Sing
Sing the songs you used to sing
For the love of everything
Sing

Ask me if I understand
Wondering how I can
I do
Even when I don't

(Don't take your love away)
The time has come
For everyone
To stand before the day
And see the sun before it slips away
I called you up and said all that I could say
Change your mind and stay, stay, stay

Stay
Stay
For as long as you can stay
Life is hard, but it's okay
Stay
Stay
