I've got to be a rug cutter
Swing out in the groove
I've got to be a rug cutter
So my jive will improve

I was so un-trucky
Now I'm super-ducky
Gonna cut back a figure
So, Gate, I'll dig ya

I've got to be a rug cutter
Swing out in the groove
I've got to be a rug cutter
So my jive will improve

I've got to be
I've got to be
Rug cuttin' me
Rug cuttin' me

Swing out in the groove
