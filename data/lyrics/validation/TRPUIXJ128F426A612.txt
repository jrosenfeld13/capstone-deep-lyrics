[Verse 1]
Why can't I take it all OK?
I like to dig and fuck around with your day
I'm going to tell your mamma
Yeah I'm going to blackball your name
There is no way you'll go without me
Every chance I'll make you pay

[Chorus]
On your space, in my face, I tell you I know (On your face)
Something about you, I know something about you (I know something)
In my space, on your face, I tell you I know something (In my space)
About you, I know something (I know something)

[Verse 2]
Why can't I put your words away
I'd like to have more of you in my veins
I'm going to tell your papa
Yeah I'm going to try and ball your babe
Your gold key don't fit my crapper
Haven't got no shit today

[Chorus]
On your space, in my face, I tell you I know (On your face)
Something about you, I know something about you (I know something)
In my space, on your face, I tell you I know something (In my space)
About you, I know something (I know something)

[Verse 3]
I'm going to tell your mama
Yeah I'm going to blackball your name
Ain't no way you'll go without me
Every chance I'll make you pay

[Chorus]
On your space, in my face, I tell you I know (On your face)
Something about you, I know something about you (I know something)
In my space, on your face, I tell you I know something (In my space)
About you, I know something (I know something)
