If a star fell from the sky for every time you told a lie
There wouldn't be a star left in the blue
Ain't no river long enough or wide enough or deep enough
To hold all of the tears I've cried for you

I hate the lies
But love the liar
Can't help myself
What can I do
I hate the lies
Love the liar
So much that I convince my heart they're true
And I just can't stop loving you

[piano]

If somebody wrote a song for every time you've done me wrong
The blues would be the only songs you'd hear
You come up with same excuse
You smile at me and what's the use
Your voice is like a love song to my ear

I hate the lies...

[ strings ]

I hate the lies...
