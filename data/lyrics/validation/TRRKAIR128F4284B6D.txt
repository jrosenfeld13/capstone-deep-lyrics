Faceless masses paralyzed
Intro position we'll fall
The gardens of Eden in turmoil the waters black with ash
Accepting blind the gift of ease
While the parasites feast
In the lungs of hell we can't breathe from bereavement to resignation
An emotional inquisition
From bereavement to resignation
Where the last bit of patience ends every decibel of silence will be heard
From the sacred and the profane
To the ordinary and mundane
A social machine demonic asleep at the wheel
Accelerating through lives of burning thirst
From bereavement to resignation
An emotional inquisition
From bereavement to resignation
A designer disease
Our lives remain incomplete
In propaganda sermons
Our words become obsolete
