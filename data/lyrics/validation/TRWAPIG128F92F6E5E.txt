Oh live without you
Oh I can live without you
Oh I can live without you
Oh I can live without you

I got love on my mind
Ain't no use in me wasting time
I got love on my mind
Ain't no use in me wasting time
I got love on my mind
Ain't no use in me wasting time
I got love on my mind
Ain't no use in me wasting time

When the heartache is over
I know I won't be missing you
Won't look over my shoulder
Cause I know that I can live without you

Oh live without you
Oh I can live without you
Oh live without you
Oh I can live without you

I got love on my mind
Ain't no use in me wasting time
I got love on my mind
Ain't no use in me wasting time
I got love on my mind
Ain't no use in me wasting time
I got love on my mind
Ain't no use in me wasting time

Oh I can live without you
Oh I can live without you
Oh I can live without you
Oh I can live without you

When the heartache is over
I know I won't be missing you
Won't look over my shoulder
Cause I know that I can live without you

Oh I live without you
Oh I can live without you
Oh I live without you
Oh I can live without you

I got love on my mind
Ain't no use in me wasting time
I got love on my mind
Ain't no use in me wasting time
I got love on my mind
Ain't no use in me wasting time
I got love on my mind
Ain't no use in me wasting time
