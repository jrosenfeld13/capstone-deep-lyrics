Well it's a shame about Monday
It starts when it ends
You've got all of your work days to play with your friends
You're blacker than lacquer
And smarter than jean
And when you drink too much you're condescendingly mean
Well I saw you leaving the other night
With a dark haired guy on a motor bike
Well my friends said they saw you drunk in the club talking really loud about how you're in love

Hey Tina you're much meaner than you ever were to me before
You're so bitchy you make me itchy
Can't you just turn me on some more and more so much more

Now it's already Wednesday, Tuesday never came the first three days always feel the same
You see you're weekend coming and you're planning your fun, you can't get excited until you're week is done

You raise your glass to your mouth but don't take a sip just touch the glass to your bottom lip, well all the guys at the bar keep staring you down (down town)
Just another see-through guy in town

Hey Tina you're much meaner than you ever were to me before
You're so bitchy you make me itchy
Can't you just turn me on some more
(You're in love)
And more so much more

Well on and on and on and on
I don't wanna wait til our drinks are done
On and on and off and on
Can we just take a little bit of time to get on

Hey Tina you're much meaner than you ever were to me before
You're so bitchy you make me itchy
Can't you just turn me on some more
(you're in love)
Hey tina you're much meaner than you ever were to me before
You're so bitchy you make me itchy
Can't you just turn me on some more and more and more
