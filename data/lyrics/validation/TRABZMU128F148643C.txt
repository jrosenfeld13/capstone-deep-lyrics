I dunno why you think that you are so brilliant
You think that you're superior to me
You may have won the last miss universe contest
But babe that doesn't mean a single thing

'Cos you - oh you - you make me spew

You're face is covered with a pound of polyfilla
You say it's just a bit of mascara
You look like some old whore that's just come out of Soho
The clothes you wear don't help you much at all

Times are hard and I ain't indifferent
You seem to bring the devil out in me
The way you always paint your nails
You're always watching T.V
