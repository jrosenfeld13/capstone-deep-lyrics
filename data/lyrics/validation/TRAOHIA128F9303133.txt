I took __________ from a magazine
Wrote it out on a blank sheet
Signed my name and made the crease
It may be my greatest piece
I think I think it's gonna sell
Promise me you'll never tell
Trust me it will be a breeze
It's so easy to please

Okay stop okay stop okay okay stop okay stop okay stop

Now everything's goin' really good
Since I left the neighbourhood
Broken window, no big deal
Most people think that I'm for real
I'm cooler now I've got the look
I think it's time to do a book
I read one that I really like
But it'll take some time to retype

Okay stop okay stop okay okay stop okay stop okay stop
Okay stop okay stop okay okay stop okay stop okay stop

So many parties to attend
I look but I can see no end
I think I think I got it sealed
Everybody thinks that I'm for real

Okay stop okay stop okay okay stop okay stop okay stop
Okay stop okay stop okay okay stop okay stop okay stop
