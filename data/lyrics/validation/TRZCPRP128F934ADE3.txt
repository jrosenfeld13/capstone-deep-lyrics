Feel like you're flying
Higher than any plane

Nobody knows you
And everyone knows your name

Talk in third person
As if you're someone else

Pockets are breaking
From an overflow of wealth

From up here where I stand
A speck of dust I see

And though I love you all
You look like ants to me

Feel like you're falling
No one can understand

Fear overtaking
Like a giant in the land

Path is obstructed
Clouds you can't see through

Vision is failing
Lacking a Godly view

Flying up above it all
Falling reminds me just how small

Fearing the insignificance of mortal man
