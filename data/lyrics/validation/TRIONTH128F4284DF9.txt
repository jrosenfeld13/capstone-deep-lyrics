God on high
Here my prayer
In my need
You have always been there

He is young
He's afraid
Let him rest
Heaven blessed
Bring him home
Bring him home
Bring him home

He's like the son I might have known
If God had granted me a son
The summers die on my own
How soon they fly on their own
Before I'm old before I'm gone

Bring him peace
Bring him joy
He is young
He is only a boy

You can take you can give
Let him be let him live
If I die, let me die
Let him live
Bring him home
Bring him home
Bring him home
