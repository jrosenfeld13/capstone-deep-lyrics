Oh I got to, yeah I got to
Call out your name and it use to
Make me feel good, yeah, real good

My body is out for a rebound
I want to, I really want to
Be doing the things that we ought to

You know what to give
Give me all you got before I'm gonna get a bad fever
Gonna get a bad fever

Here comes the red van
It's my gun man
A part of my heart with a beer can

It's no scam, much better than
Those fatty creeps with a bad tan

I got shivers, he's my Peter Pan
I'm Tinkerbell going to Neverland

Come on over, Ill make you understand
You could be my cover
You could be my man

I got to, yeah I got to
Call out your name and it use to
Make me feel good, yeah, real good

My body is out for a rebound
I want to, I really want to
Be doin the things that we ought to

You know what to give
Give me all you got before I'm gonna get a bad fever
Gonna get a bad fever

Come on over
Ill make you understand
You could be my cover
You could be my man

Dont you ever feel that we're spinning the wheel?
Dont you ever see I'm head over heels?
Dont you ever wonder how it would feel to give me all you got?

Dont you ever feel like that we're spinning the wheel?
Dont you ever see I'm head over heels?
Dont you ever wonder how it would feel to give me all you got before I'm gonna get a bad fever
