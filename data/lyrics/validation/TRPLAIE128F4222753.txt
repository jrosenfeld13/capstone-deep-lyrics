The days of wine and roses
Were a long time ago
The proms, teenage cruisin'
And the picture show

You tried so hard
To fix your outsides
Until you realized that I took
Everything dear inside

[Chorus]
Give me your heart
Give me your soul
I'll take you when you're young
The devil in miss jones

Your daddy had a funny way
Of showing you his love
It's a shame you've hid well
From the lord up above
There's something inside
That burns like a fire
And you realize you've been blessed
With a wild desire

[Chorus]
Your parochial background
Vanished in the wind
Perhaps a ographic future
And a million dollar friend
You tried so hard to always be the one
You're loved by all men, but respected by none

[Chorus]
I'll take you when you're young
And I'll leave you when you're old
