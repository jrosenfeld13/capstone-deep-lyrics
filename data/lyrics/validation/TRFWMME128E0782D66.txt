[Verse 1]
Sons of the silent age
Stand on platforms blank looks and notebooks
Sit in the back rows of city limits
Lay in bed coming and going on easy terms
Sons of the silent age
Pace their rooms like a cell's dimension
Rise for a year or two then make war
Search through their one inch thoughts
Then decide it couldn't be done

[Chorus]
Baby, I'll never let you go
All I see is all I know
Let's take another way down
(Sons of sound, and sons of sound)
Baby, baby, I'll never let you down
I can't stand another sound
Let's find another way in
(Sons of sound, and sons of sound)

[Verse 2]
Sons of the silent age
Listen to tracks by Sam Therapy and King Dice
Sons of the silent age
They pick up in bars and cry only once
Sons of the silent age
Make love only once but dream and dream
They don't walk, they just glide in and out of life
They never die, they just go to sleep one day

[Chorus]
Baby, I'll never let you go
All I see is all I know
Let's take another way down
(Sons of sound, and sons of sound)
Baby, baby, I'll never let you down
I can't stand another sound
Let's find another way in
(Sons of sound, and sons of sound)
