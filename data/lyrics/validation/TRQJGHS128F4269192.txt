Oh baby, come on, let me take you where the action is
Oh baby, come on, let me take you where the action is
Oh baby, come on, let me take you where the action is
It's so neat to meet you, baby, where the action is

In every little town across the USA
There's a spot where the people go 'most every day
So leave all your troubles and get away
Come on down and listen to the guitar play

Dance, dance, dance when you hear that beat
Dance, dance, dance, get up off of your seat
Dance, dance, dance, let your backbone slip
Let's go to a place on the Sunset Strip

If all night long you've been waitin' to dance
Well all night long you're gonna have your chance
So don't sit at home just a twiddlin' your thumbs
You can't resist the sound of the drivin' drums

Dance, dance, dance when you hear that beat
Dance, dance, dance, get up off of your seat
Dance, dance, dance, let your backbone slip
Let's go to a place on the Sunset Strip

Oh baby, come on, let me take you where the action is
Oh baby, come on, let me take you where the action is
Oh baby, come on, let me take you where the action is
It's so neat to meet you, baby, where the action is
