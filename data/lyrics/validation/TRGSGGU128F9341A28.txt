[Verse 1]
What the hell are you standing there for?!
Expecting me to help you, when I'm down myself
Waiting my saviour, my world is flooding over
There's no room for air, I can't breathe
I would give a kingdom for one more day
I'd give a kingdom
For one more day as a king of your world
I'd give a kingdom, for one more day

[Verse 2]
What the hell am I waiting here for
Expecting you to come and give away your life
Just for a moment of my time
Have a hole where I should have a heart
I'm made of wood, I'm falling apart
I would give a kingdom for one more day
I'd give a kingdom
For one more day as a king of your world
I'd give a kingdom, for one more day

[Chorus]
I'd give it all for a heart
If I was a King I would give away my kingdom
Treasures and crowns wouldn't mean a thing
If I only had a heart, if I only had a heart...

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Now I know I will never love you
I'm a man without a heart, I'm not allowed to feel human feelings
I'm king of the land, I'm ruler of seas
I'd give it away in a moment
If I only had one moment
I'd give a kingdom
I'd give a kingdom
I'd give a kingdom
For just one more day

[Chorus]
I'd give it all for a heart
If I was a King I would give away my kingdom
Treasures and crowns wouldn't mean a thing
If I only had a heart...

I'd give it all for a heart
If I was a King I would give away my kingdom
Treasures and crowns wouldn't mean a thing
If I only had a heart, if I only had...

I'd give it all for a heart
If I was a King I would give away my kingdom
Treasures and crowns wouldn't mean a thing
If I only had a heart, if I only had a heart...
