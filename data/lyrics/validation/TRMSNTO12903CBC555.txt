I'm a tip-top daddy and I'm gonna have my way
Keep away from the corners is what I got to say
With a-one hand only, get a-ready for a ride
Give me one hand loose and I'll be satisfied
Give me a free hand baby, 'cause I wanna rock
Turn me loose and maybe I will blow my top
Give me a free hand woman, let it swing by my side
Just give me one hand loose and I'll be satisfied
Turn loose! Oh, turn loose!

Well, feel the rhythm in your bones and you know how I feel
But don't you grab me close baby, this time is for real
Get ready for some rockin', pick 'em up and put 'em down
Give me one hand loose and I'll be satisfied
Give me a free hand baby, 'cause I wanna rock
Turn me loose and maybe I will blow my top
Give me a free hand baby, let it swing by my side
Just give me one hand loose and I'll be satisfied
Satisfied! Oh, do it!
