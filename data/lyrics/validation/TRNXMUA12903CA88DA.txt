Late one night in the pale moon light
Hey now, now, now, carry 'em out
Ran a crew of hoods with a lust for life
Hey now, now, now, carry 'em out

They grabbed this boy asleep in bed
Hey now, now, now, carry 'em out
Laying in slumber as if half dead
Hey now, now, now, carry 'em out

They're knockin' down your wall
And they're kickin' down your doors
The hooligans are coming
They're comin' back for more

You know they're here they smell your fear
What you gonna do?
Remember this test keep sleeping dressed
This story is the truth

Can't see no soul through his dark blindfold
Hey now, now, now, carry 'em out
Taken to a place where the air is cold
Hey now, now, now, carry 'em out

Wondering if this is how life ends
Hey now, now, now, carry 'em out
Then the fold comes off and it's all his friends
Hey now, now, now, carry 'em out

They're knockin' down your wall
And they're kickin' down your doors
These hooligans are coming
They're comin' back for more

You know they're here they smell your fear
What you gonna do?
Remember this test keep sleeping dressed
This story is the truth

Hey now, now, now, carry 'em out
Hey now, now, now, carry 'em out
Hey now, now, now, carry 'em out
Hey now, now, now, carry 'em out

They're knockin' down your wall
And they're kickin' down your doors
These hooligans are coming
They're comin' back for more

You know they're here they smell your fear
What you gonna do?
Remember this test keep sleeping dressed
This story is the truth
