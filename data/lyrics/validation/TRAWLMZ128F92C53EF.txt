So we went down later that night
Over the hill so far away
Down in the dark hallows we found
Some of our friends stumbling around
Bringing back the old ones who are waiting
You try to hide the truth from us
We know you do, you lie to us
You tell us lies all the time you know
Oh oh bringing back the old ones
Oh oh bringing back them all
Take us away over the hill
We will be back later than noon
You try to hide the truth from us
We know you do, you lie to us
You tell us lies all the time you know
Oh oh bringing back the old ones
Oh oh bringing back them all
