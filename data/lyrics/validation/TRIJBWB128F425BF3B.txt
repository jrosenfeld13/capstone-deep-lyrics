Walking inside your room
I feel as if I'm lost
It was last year, June
When you went out of sight
But not out of mind
I had to stay alone
And put the past behind

Wandering around the brine
We often used to
Stare at in summertime
I feel as if you stand
On the waterside
So don't you think there is
Something left untried

Standing at the place we met
I agree to be as you said
Have to laugh about myself
Yeah I do
Yeah I really do

I should cry about myself
And my sick behaviour
But I can't keep a straight face
I don't know what to do
I feel totally displaced
I feel out of space

What you have said to me
Left an aweful flavour
But now I am amused
It seems I hope, I feel
That I'm out of danger
I just can't laugh

Driving the streets we drove
I feel you by my side
I make my eyes rove
But when I see the plain
Where we used to stop
A voice inside my brain
Said let curtains drop

That was a place of sorrow
This was a place of joy
Here I forgot tomorrow
Pleasure and joy alloy
A place of sorrow
A place of joy

Mission, seclusion
A kind of disolution
Ruction, destruction
A failing reconstruction

Vexation, collision
Object of derision
Tension, addiction
Omnipresent friction

That was a place of sorrow
That was a place of joy
Here I forgot tomorrow
Pleasure and joy alloy

Love is as warm as tears
It is a precious veil
Love is as cold as dark fear
Can be a hurting nail
