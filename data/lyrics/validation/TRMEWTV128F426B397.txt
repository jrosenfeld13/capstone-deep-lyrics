There is no reason to run anymore, no reason to hide away
Since he's come into my life, he's brought sunshine to my day

Chorus:
I will let my light shine, no more shadows
I will let my light shine, darkness run away
I will let my light shine, for a bright tomorrow
I will let my light shine

No more casting shadows, no more living a lie
Since he's come into my life, he's brought sunshine to my skies
