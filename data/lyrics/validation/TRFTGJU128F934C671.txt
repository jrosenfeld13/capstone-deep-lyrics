The agony you put me through
Rival not of what I'll do to you
Ripping away at my humanity
Tearing me in two
The burning passion of a love once lost
Raging below into a dreadful cost
Vengeance will be mine you see
For everything you've done to me

[Chorus]
Cannot trust
Deceiving lust
That hateful sin
The dread within

Walk on down that faithful aisle
No more means to have it reconciled
Your actions repaid
Straight from the heart
Until your death do us part

I could not trust
Your deceiving lust
That hateful sin
And my dread within
I could not overcome
For what is done is done
That memory I will wipe out
Until flesh and ground are one

Carry the burden deep inside
Try to disappear you cannot hide
Bury the truth under your veil of lies
Your devotion now deceased
Your words are broken
Nothing spoken
A perfect lack of purity
Your actions repaid
Straight from the heart
Until your death do us part
I could not trust
Your deceiving lust
That hateful sin
And my dread within

[Chorus]
