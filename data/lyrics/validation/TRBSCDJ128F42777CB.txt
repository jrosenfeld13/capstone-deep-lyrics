Riding round town with all the windows down
Eight track playing all your favorite sounds
The rhythm of the bongos fill the park
The street musicians trying to get a start

'Cause it's summer, summer time is here
Yes, it's summer, my time of year
Yes, it's summer, my time of year

Stretched out on a blanket in the sand
Kids of all ages digging Disneyland
Rapping on the C B radio in your van
Well give a big ten four to the trucking man

'Cause it's summer, summer time is here
Yes, it's summer, my time of year

In Atlantic City or out in Malibu
Or anywhere between, I'm telling you
When you feel those balmy breezes on your face
Summer time is the best time any place

'Cause it's summer, summer time is here
Yes, it's summer, my time of year
