Solitaire, solitaire
Catch the moment that i had you near
Solitude, solitude
Will good fortune make a path for you ?

Ava ava
Spending my days without you
Ava ava
Ending my days without you

Celebrate, celebrate
Cut the bows and watch this all sail away
Fear is fine, fear is mine
But when it's gone will that morning be mine?

Ava ava
Spending my days without you
Ava ava
Ending my days without you
