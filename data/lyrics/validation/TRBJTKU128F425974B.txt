Where are you when the sun goes down
And I need somebody that I can rely on?
Where are you when I'm all alone
And I'm wanting a mattress, that I can lie on?
Well I look for you most everywhere
And I've been tought about crawling away
But I'm gettign nowhere and you're on the run so
I've gotta ask you, I've gotta ask you
*What are you worth babe? Nothing!
What do you give me? Nothing! Nothing!
What are you good points? Nothing!
What am I left with, nothing, nothing!
Well I've got detectives on the job and what do they come up with?
Nothing!
And I've torn down all of your secret walls and what do I find there?
Nothing!
(*repeat 2x)
** (I need) somebody, somebody, anybody's body
(** repeat)
(*repeat)
(**repeat)
Absolutely nothing!
I need somebody's body
Absolutley I need anybody's body
I need anybody's body
(continue with ad libs from this section)
What do you give me?
