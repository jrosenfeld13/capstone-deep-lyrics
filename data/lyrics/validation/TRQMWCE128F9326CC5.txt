Welcome into my house, come along and follow me
To a place that you've never been, a mystic fantasy
Take a ride and go with me in a time and a space
I'll show you things that you never knew, existed in another place

Ah aaaah... I wanna know
Ah aaaah... I wanna know
Are you ready, are you ready
You ready, are you ready
Are you ready, are you ready
You ready, are you ready

Welcome to tomorrow, welcome to tomorrow
Welcome to tomorrow, welcome to tomorrow
Welcome to tomorrow, welcome to tomorrow
Welcome to tomorrow, welcome to tomorrow
Welcome into my world
Welcome into my world
Welcome into my world
Welcome into my world
My world

Welcome into my world
Welcome into my world

Hokus Pokus turn around, ain't no magic act around
Hokus Pokus turn around, ain't no magic act around
Hokus Pokus turn around, ain't no magic act around
Hokus Pokus turn around, ain't no magic act around
