Operation Uppsala

(verse 1)
Enemies of Jah them come to I and I
Try to take away my pride
His majesty was there and di angels of Jah
We were all standing there in Uppsala
Informer and police dem rush I and I
And try to sabotage mi chanting
But Uppsala reggae raise di wicked man shall fall
Cah victory shall bloom above them all

(verse 2)
Enemies of Jah dem lock up my teacha
And couldn't even try to explain himself
Dem carry him dung a station
Abusing dem powa
It all happen dung in Uppsala
Di flash light on di ??
Di dogs and di gun
Di plan was to find di sensimilia
Di monsta dem nuh like
My Solomon herb
The truth is written inna di bible worls

(verse 3)
When we do good babylon dem no like it
If you do bad babylon dem no like it
If you dont move babylon dem no like it
If you just step babylon dem no like it
Dem want fi run dem a sciss cah dem a fascist
No dem no like RastafarI dem a racist
Dem neva accept king Selassie dem a prejudice
Some police dem a move like dem a terrorist
