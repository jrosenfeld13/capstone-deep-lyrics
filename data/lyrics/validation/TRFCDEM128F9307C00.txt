They found sixth-form poetry scrawled on the walls
Of your old bedroom
And Friday night is going to free-fall
Through club lust, angel dust and sweet perfume
And you remind me of some art-house black and white I saw
They'd coloured it with chalk
And are you wise? Wise beyond your years or
Or are you all talk?

Now, don't you think something's gotta happen soon?
It's been so long now since they changed that tune
Oh, Juliet keep that in mind

Well there is something so beautifully chic
About burning out so young
When you accessorise with bruises on your cheek
And cool tricks of the tongue
You're spending Saturday alone drowning heartache out
With cheap red wine
I know you want to make the news but lately all you do
Is memorise the headlines

Now, don't you think something's gotta happen soon?
It's been so long now since they changed that tune
Oh, Juliet keep that in mind

Sometimes you'll count the days
And sometimes you'll just slip away
There are watches to unwind
And ladders still to climb

Now, don't you think something's gotta happen soon?
It's been so long now since they changed that tune
Oh, Juliet keep that in mind
Don't you think something's gotta happen soon?
It's been so long now since they changed that tune
Oh, Juliet keep that in mind
Keep that in mind
Keep that in mind
Juliet
Juliet
