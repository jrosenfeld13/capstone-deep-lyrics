Make the next one a large gin
Before I start it up aagin
Make the coldness disappear
Before I cry myself to sleep
Saint Christopher told me today
He said that we both had to stay
He said that we both had to start again
Because I?m sinking under the sea
And I?ve been so long waiting to breath
And do you know how I feel today
To watch my whole life slipping away
I burned myself out on the trail
It doesn?t matter anyway
Saint Christopher told me today
Exactly what I had to say
He said that we both had to move away
Because I?m sinking under the sea
And I?ve been so long waiting to breath
And do you know how I feel today
To watch my whole life slipping away
You?ll never take me alive
No matter what you do
I said no matter how you try
You?ll never take me alive
No matter what you do
I said no matter how you try
Because I?m sinking under the sea
And I?ve been so long waiting to breath
And do you know how I feel today
To watch my whole life slipping away
Slipping away...
