I am a common man, I use common words
This is no manifesto, this is no propaganda

(hey!)
95% of the world is third world

Take a look around, you might not like what you see
Yeah we're all comfortably living in a privileged society

Open up your mind and think outside of the box
Yeah, it's just a case of ignorance and benevolence

America's a privileged society
When it comes to other countries, we don't see the cultural beauty
We see famine, death, disease, poverty and war
Which almost always involves US military
That is what most US citizens know about other countries
Is what they see on CNN and other television programming
And yet here in our own country, unemployment is at an all-time high
And thousands of businesses have gone bankrupt
Just look around, how many buildings do you see empty and policed?
And here in America, disease, poverty and famine DO exist
And it's not just in our ghettos anymore
It's now become a struggle for the middle-class to survive
Maybe if the poor in America had something for corporations
And our government to profit off of (like oil)
Maybe then they would take an interest in problems here in America
Or maybe they would just bomb us...
