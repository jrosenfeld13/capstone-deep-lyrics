La-la la-la la la-la-la

If you walk out and face up the day
Somehow, the look seems to fall off your face
Wonder who's finding all this a game
Bet they're slipping down in decay

La-la la-la la la-la-la

Somehow, you fall down and pick up the ground
Keep all the message and make it your sound
Why not, why not, slip into ice
If you want more, take some advice

La-la la-la la la-la-la
La-la la-la la la-la-la
