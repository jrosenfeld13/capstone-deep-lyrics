Here we go again
Feeling so small inside
I could implode
Humiliated
By my own ways of weakness

Wash me white as snow
Let me start again
Oh, let Your warm breeze
Blow away all this filth in my soul

Reaching out my hands
Letting it out before my head explodes
Then liberated
Restoration through forgiveness

Wash me white as snow
Let me start again
Oh, let Your warm breeze
Blow away all this filth in my soul
Wash me white as snow
Lift me up again
Oh, let Your mercy flow
Give me life so I can live

And so, now I can once again lift my head up high
Shamelessly look into anyone's eyes
Because
When I'm weak, then You are strong
Yeah, I will leave condemnation and sin behind
Confidently marching forward with this in mind
You are right when I am wrong

Wash me white as snow
Let me start again
Oh, let Your warm breeze
Blow away all this filth in my soul
Wash me white as snow
Lift me up again
Oh, let Your mercy flow

I will not let go, I will not give in
'Cause He told me so: by His love I'll win
I will not let go, I will not give in
'Cause He told me so: by His love I'll win
I will not let go, I will not give in
'Cause He told me so: by His love I'll win
I will not let go, I will not give in
'Cause He told me so: by His love I'll win
