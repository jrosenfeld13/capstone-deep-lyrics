Spent the night with Jim Beam and Johnny Walker Red
Woke up with a freight train runnin through my head
I'm a beer man

Bobby's more the wine kind
Donny does his shots
Sammy sips Martini's
Willie smokes pot
But I'm a beer man

I've done a little steppin out there on a limb
But my open mind winds up closed again
I like brown bottles and aluminum cans
Simple maybe, but that's who I am
Hey, I'm just a beer man

Take your Caviar and that fish--it ain't cooked
Take it off the cracker and throw it on a hook
I'm a beer man
Lord and if I was a rich man, tell ya what I'd do
I'd be the same ol' plain ol' guy you always knew
Just a beer man

I've done a little steppin out there on a limb
But my open mind winds up closed again
I like brown bottles and aluminum cans
Simple but that's who I am
Hey, I'm just a beer man

Yeah I've done a lil steppin out there on a limb
My open mind winds up closed again
I like brown bottles and aluminum cans
Call me simple but I can't change who I am
Oh I'm just a beer man

Yeah I'm a beer man

Yeah I'm a beer maaaaaaaaan, yes I am!
