Every night, every day, oh, I'm searching for my way
And I'm dreaming of you all my life
Every night, every day, oh, believe me oh, I pray
Set the dream to your heart to survive

Every night, every day, oh, I'm searching for my way
And I'm dreaming of you all my life
Every night, every day, oh, believe me oh, I pray
Set the dream to your heart to survive

I saw love in her eyes, a promised paradise
Every night, every day, baby, oh, I pray
Oh, she lied when she cried, she can not hide
She was sad, oh, so sad when it wasn't made

I saw love in her eyes and my paradise
Every night, every day, hard for me to say
I was blind, oh, so blind, couldn't realize
That my heart, oh, my heart was so hypnotized in you

Every night, every day, oh, I'm searching for my way
And I'm dreaming of you all my life
Every night, every day, oh, believe me oh, I pray
Set the dream to your heart to survive

Oh, I cry, I cry forever, why can't we stay together?
Can't you see my life is in your hands?
Oh, I cry, cry forever, baby, I will love you ever
Can't you see my life is in your hands?
Can't you see my life is in your hands?

Oh, it hurts that she's gone, feeling so alone
Every night, every day, hope don't turn away
Come back, please come back, always in my head
Only you makes me blue, that's what love can I do

Can I find in your mind? You're the lovin' kind
Every night and every day, believe me when I say
I need you, just you, couldn't realize
That your heart in my heart was so specialized in me

Every night, every day, oh, I'm searching for my way
And I'm dreaming of you all my life
Every night, every day, oh, believe me oh, I pray
Set the dream to your heart to survive

Oh, I cry, I cry forever, why can't we stay together?
Can't you see my life is in your hands?
Oh, I cry, cry forever, baby, I will love you ever
Can't you see my life is in your hands?
Can't you see my life is in your hands?
