I love it when we do what we do when we do
I love it when we do what we do when we do

Aahaaa...
Aahaaa...
Aahaaa...Yeah

When you're around
The sun is always shining
And since we met
I haven't once stopped smiling,yeah
The love I feel for you
Is almost blinding, yeah

Running up and down the street
Hugging everyone I meet
Now you love me life is sweet
When I got you in my arms
I can't turn off the fire alarms, yeah

CHORUS 1:
I love it when we do what we do
'cause we do what we do 'til it's done
I love the way we do what we do
'cause we do what we do and it's fun
You're the one

When you're around
My eyes don't ever wonder
And no one else
I've ever been more fond of, oh
So baby don't you break this spell I'm under, yeah

When I look into your eyes
I don't have to fantasize
You're a dream that's realised
I'm dancing on the moon inside
If life is cruel then someone lied, yeah

CHORUS 1

CHORUS 2
I take it when we kiss and we hug
And you cute little bug in a rug, my love

Aahaaa...

When you and me
Turn into us
It makes me cry
It makes me trust

I love it when we do, I want do, I want
Do I want do, I want do,I want do, I want
CHORUS 2

You and me
Taste so sweet
It makes me cry
You're the one

You and me
Taste so sweet
It makes me cry
You're the one
