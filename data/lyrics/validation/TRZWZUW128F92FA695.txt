He's an unidentified flying object
You will see Him in the air
He's an unidentified flying object
You will drop your hands and stare
You will be afraid to tell your neighbors
They might think that it's not true
But when they open up the morning papers
They will know they've seen Him too

He will come back like He promised
With the price already paid
He will gather up His followers
And take them all away

He's an unidentified flying object
He will sweep down from the sky
He's an unidentified flying object
Some will sleep but will not die
He's an unidentified flying object
Coming back to take you home
He's an unidentified flying object
He will roll away your stone

And if there's life on other planets
Then I'm sure that He must know
And He's been there once already
And has died to save their souls

He's an unidentified flying object
You will see Him in the air
He's an unidentified flying object
You will drop your hands and stare
He's an unidentified flying object
Coming back to take you Home
He's an unidentified flying object
He will roll away your stone
