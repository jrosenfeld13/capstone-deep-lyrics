(R. McGinley)

I wanna talk to you don't want something that
I get for nothing I wanna talk to you
I know when something isn't worth discussing

You might say I know but you always knew
I could be unkind but I can't be cruel
All my lies are false but your heart is true
When I see you cry I think tears are cool

I wanna talk to you I don't wanna lover
That I take for granted I wanna talk to you
I wanna say something that you'll find romantic

(Chorus)
I don't say my prayers but I pray for you
I might say who cares but I know you do
You're the one who knows that my lies aren't true
When I see you cry I think tears are cool

(repeat Chorus 1x) (drums enter)
