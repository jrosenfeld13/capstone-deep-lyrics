Shady Sadie, serving lady
Don't pay her no mind, no
She'll take every dime
She's got a one-a-day lunch
Good for all the bunch, yeah
Hot lunch, yeah

Macaroni and baloney
Tuna fish, our favorite dish
Hot lunch, hey
If it's yellow, then it's jello
If it's blue it could be stew oo, oo

She's got a one-a-day lunch
Good for all the bunch
Hey, now
Hot, hot lunch
Oh, oh, no
Yeah
