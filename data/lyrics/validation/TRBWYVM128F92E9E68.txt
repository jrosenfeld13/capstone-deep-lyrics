[Verse 1]
Oh, my land is like a wild goose
Wanders all around, everywhere
Trembles and it shakes 'til every tree is loose
It rolls the meadows, and it rolls the nails

[Chorus]
So take me down to your dance floor
And I won't mind people when they stare
Paint a different color on your front door
And tomorrow, we will still be there

[Verse 2]
Jesus built a ship to sing a song to
It sails the river, and it sails the tide
Some of my friends don't know who they belong to
Some can't get a single thing to work inside

[Chorus]
So take me down to your dance floor
And I won't mind the people when they stare
Paint a different color on your front door
And tomorrow, we will still be there

[Fiddle Solo]

[Verse 3]
I've loved you every day, and now I'm leaving
And I can see the sorrow in your eyes
I hope you know a lot more than you're believing
Just so the sun don't hurt you when you cry

[Chorus]
Oh, take me down to your dance floor
I wont mind the people when they stare
Paint a different color on your front door
And tomorrow, we may still be there
And tomorrow, we may still be there
