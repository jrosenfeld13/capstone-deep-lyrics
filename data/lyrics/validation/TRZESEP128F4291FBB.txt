Overblown state of mind

Changes made for a lie seen as true

Judged fairly for a crime

Given up on a life spent with you

Fourtunes speant from behind

Broken image of a mind

Rusted, begging, towed the line

Only witness to a life speant with you

Now i'm giving up on lies worth believing

And i'm giving up my mind, yeah

Stolen years from a life not worth living

And i'm running out of time

Been called unforgiving

Secrets passed on a line broken through

And belived all the sinning

Given up on a life spent with you

Now i'm giving up on lies worth believing

And i'm giving up my mind, yeah

Stolen years from a life not worth living

And i'm running out of time

Now i'm giving up on lies worth believing

And i'm giving up my mind, yeah

Stolen years from a life not worth living

Well it happens all the time
