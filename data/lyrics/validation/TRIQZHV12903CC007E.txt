Listen to me now
I say face to face
I can't stand you lie to me
Couse you even can't lie
I see through your eyes
I see you're fucking weak inside

You get what you give  from me

You treat everyone
Like you are the one
The only one for everyone
I don't need this
Fuck all your shit
You fucking spineless leech

You get what you give  from me

You cannot fight
And you can hide
You hide couse you know that I am right
The karma will find you
There is nothing to rescue
And than you know, will of god

You get what you give  from me
