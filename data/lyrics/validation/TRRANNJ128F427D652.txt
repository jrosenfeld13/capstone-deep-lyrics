This blinding kiss breathes helium into my heart
And erases the embraces of all other lovers
With this kiss

Your ruby lips speak for themselves, they tell nothing but lies
I dissolve into the wax of a flickering candle
With this kiss

This isn't real, in Chinatown everything's cheap
I'm shipwrecked on the coast of your shoulders
And this kiss

And this kiss
And this kiss
And this kiss
And this kiss
And this kiss
This kiss
With this kiss
