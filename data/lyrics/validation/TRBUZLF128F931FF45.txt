People tell me everyday, "you better grow up and change your ways."
I tell 'em that i ain't gonna listen
So you can stop your moanin' and pissin'

F**k you, i'll do what i want
F**k you, i'll do what i want
F**k you, i'll do what i want
F**k you, i'll do what i want

Don't need your rules
I don't play your games
All you phonies are the f**king same
I don't wanna be like you
I'm gonna do what i wanna do

F**k you, i'll do what i want
F**k you, i'll do what i want
F**k you, i'll do what i want
F**k you, i'll do what i want

F**k you, i'll do what i want
F**k you, i'll do what i want
F**k you, i'll do what i want
F**k you, i'll do what i want
F**k you, i'll do what i want
F**k you, i'll do what i want
F**k you, i'll do what i want
F**k you, i'll do what i want
