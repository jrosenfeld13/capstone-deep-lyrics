[Verse 1]
I sent myself a dozen roses
Right before the office closes
Just to make my girlfriends green with envy
Ever since I lost you
All the crazy things I do
I didn't even know I had it in me, oh but

[Chorus]
Hey, it's all right
It's just another Saturday night
Got nobody, got no nothing to lose
I'm going to get dressed up and go downtown

[Bridge]
Spread a little misery around
Anything's better than feeling the blues

[Verse 2]
Found a restaurant on my way
I told them it was my birthday
Just to hear the waiters sing off-key
I've sprung a loose wire that's a fact
Got a strange little monkey on my back
But I kind of like the company and I guess

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Dance the little monkey around
Anything's better than feeling the blues

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Live it up and never live it down
Anything's better than feeling the blues

[Outro]
Anything's better than feeling the blues
