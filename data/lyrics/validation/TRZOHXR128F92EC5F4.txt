[Intro]
Mmmm, mmmm
I get wings to fly
Oh, oh....I'm alive....Yeah

[Chorus 1]
When you call on me
When I hear you breathe
I get wings to fly
I feel that I'm alive

[Verse 1]
When you look at me
I can touch the sky
I know that I'm alive

[Chorus 2]
When you bless the day
I just drift away
All my worries die
I'm glad that I'm alive

[Verse 2]
You've set my heart on fire
Filled me with love
Made me a woman on clouds above
(Yeah)
I couldn't get much higher
My spirit takes flight
'Cause I am alive, oh

[Chorus]
(When you call on me)
When you call on me
(When I hear you breathe)
When I hear you breathe
I get wings to fly
I feel that I'm alive
I'm alive

[Verse 3]
(When you reach for me)
When you reach for me
(Raising spirits high)
God knows that
That I'll be the one
Standing by through good and through trying times
And it's only begun
I can't wait for the rest of my life

[Chorus 1]
(When you call on me)
When you call on me
(When you reach for me)
When you reach for me
(I get wings to fly)
I feel that I'm alive

[Chorus 2]
(When you bless the day)
When you bless the day
(I just drift away)
I just drift away
All my worries die
I know that I'm alive

[Outro]
I get wings to fly
God knows that I'm alive
