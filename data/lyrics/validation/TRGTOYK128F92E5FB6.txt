I have been fading in the dark for too long
Suspended and waiting for some light to turn on
I'm reaching up to make contact, take away this empty space
I'm so tired of just drifting through the Milky Way

My heart is a star for you to ignite
I'm ready to be the one that burns for you tonight
So bring me to life
Just like the stars that shine when galaxies collide

Love is a destination few ever find
But I'm watching our constellations start to combine
Counting down for an impact staring at the sky above
I've had enough of this distance so far from your love

My heart is a star for you to ignite
I'm ready to be the one that burns for you tonight
So bring me to life
Just like the stars that shine when galaxies collide

My heart is a star for you to ignite
I'm ready to be the one that burns for you tonight
So bring me to life
Just like the stars that shine when galaxies collide

Galaxies collide
When galaxies collide
