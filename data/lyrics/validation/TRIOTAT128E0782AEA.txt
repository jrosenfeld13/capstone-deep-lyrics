[Verse 1]
When you're sickened by the night
And the sun is in your eyes
To remind you what you've done

[Pre-Chorus]
You can breathe so hard it hurts
Try to put it into words
It is 5 AM

[Chorus 1]
So much nicer to go home
Came in someone else's car
Shiver in your night-time clothes
You don't know where you are
And if you ask, they'll know

[Verse 2]
Vicious sting at back of eyes
Purple palm print on your thigh
Your head aches, you're dizzy

[Pre-Chorus]
You can breathe so hard it hurts
Try to put it into words
It is 6 AM

[Chorus 2]
So much harder to go home
Trapped in someone else's car
Shiver in your night-time clothes
You don't know where you are
And if you ask, they'll know

So much harder to go home
Came in someone else's car
Shiver in your night-time clothes
You don't know where you are
And if you ask, they'll know
