Wait and see, I'm young
I grow each day

Oh, I feel this pointer inside of me
I cannot argue with myself

I'm not afraid, she's a Jedi too
Oh,I don't believe in anything
Sorry but if I'd known
Where do Mondays go
You see I don't believe in anything

So I will complete my training here
I probably should
Wake me up, prepare my ship, I'm off
And you should know
I won't come back again

I'm not afraid, she's a Jedi too
Oh,I don't believe in anything
Sorry but if I'd known
Where do Mondays go
You see I don't believe in anything
