Just staring off into space again
What am I looking for
Maybe a cigarette might
Calm me down or keep me warm
Maybe a drink might be able
To tell me that I might be able
To do this alone
Theyre probably both wrong

Why should I wait
(I hate this feeling)
For my mistakes
(Theyre tearing me up inside)

My head is a mess
Dressed in guilt
Tilted left
And when I straighten this out
Ill find the rest
And wear it on my chest
So the the world can see
Everything that has been happening to me
Theres nothing to hide anymore
Theyre breaking through my front door

Why should I wait
(I hate this feeling)
For my mistakes
(Theyre tearing me up inside)

I waited too long to find the things
Taking the life away from this
You couldn't care that life was this
Without all the shit you covered it with

Why should I wait
(I hate this feeling)
For my mistakes
(Theyre tearing me up inside)
Why should I wait
Wait for
Something to point me the right way
