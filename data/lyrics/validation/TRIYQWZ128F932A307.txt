Loneliness is your only friend
Broken heart that just won't mend
Is the price you pay
It's hard to take when love grows old
Days are long and the nights turn cold
When it fades away
You hope that she will change her mind
But the days drift on and on
You'll never know the reason why she's gone
Empty rooms, where we learn to live without love
Empty rooms, where we learn to live without love
See her face in every crowd
Hear her voice but you're still proud
So you turn away
Tell yourself that you'll be strong
But your heart tells you
This time you're wrong
Empty rooms, where we learn to live without love
Empty rooms, where we learn to live without love
Empty rooms, where we learn to live without love
You hope that she will change her mind
But the days drift on and on
You'll never know the reason why she's gone
Empty rooms, where we learn to live without love
Empty rooms, where we learn to live without love
Empty rooms, where we learn to live without love
Empty rooms, where we learn to live without love
