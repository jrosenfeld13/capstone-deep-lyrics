[Intro:]
Waiter? Can we have the same table we had yesterday?

Here we are again sipping our drinks just like friends
I wonder if they see the sparkle in your eyes
I wonder if they know that I am not your guy hmm
I wonder if they see that I don't belong to you
Wish that you we're mine (mine all mine)

It'll be hard for him to understand
I am his friend and he is your man
I wonder what my lady would say
If she knew I bet you everyday
Sooner or later don't you know
They go find out that they're haters
Wish that you could be mine (mine, all mine)

It's 2 a.m. the place is gonna close
The bartender looks as though he knows
Everybodys, everybody's made it home
Here we sit together all alone
I got to get up and pay don't you know
I got to explain why I am so late
I wish that you could have to go home
