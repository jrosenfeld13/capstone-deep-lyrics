I done had my fun if I never get well no more
I had my fun if I never get well no more
You know, my health is failing me now
And I'm going down slow
Please write my mother, now tell her this for me
Want you to write my mother, darlin', tell her this for me
Tell her, forgive me for my sins
They were never meant to be
Mother, please don't worry, this is all in my song
Tell her, mother, please don't worry, this is all in my song
Tell her, my son was a good boy, you know
[Incomprehensible] travelin' on
On the next train south, look for my chloroform
On the next train, next train south, look for my chloroform
If you don't find my body
All you can do is moan
Don't send no doctor, doctor can't do me no good
Tell her, don't send no doctor, doctor can't do me no good
Yeah, it's all my fault, you know that I
Didn't do the things that I should
Mother, please don't worry, Lord, do this for me
Tell her, mother, please don't worry, won't you please do this for me
Forgive me for my sins
You know they were never meant to be
