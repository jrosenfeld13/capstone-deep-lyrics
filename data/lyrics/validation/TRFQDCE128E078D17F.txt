(M. Crenshaw)

It isn't such a crime
It isn't such a shame
It happens all the time
You shouldn't take the blame
Go on and have a laugh
Go have a laugh on me
Go on and have a laugh
At all your misery
Mary Anne, Mary Anne (don't cry Mary Anne)
I really wanna tell you Mary Anne, Mary Anne
I'm thinking of you
Mary Anne, Mary Anne (don't cry Mary Anne)
I really wanna tell you Mary Anne, Mary Anne, Mary Anne
You take a look around
And all you seem to see
Is bringing you down
As down as you can be
Go on and have a laugh
Go have a laugh on me
Go on and have a laugh
At how bad it can be
Mary Anne, Mary Anne (you'll be all right)
I really wanna tell you Mary Anne, Mary Anne
I'm thinking of you
Mary Anne, Mary Anne (you'll be all right)
I really wanna tell you Mary Anne, Mary Anne, Mary Anne
Mary Anne, Mary Anne (goodnight Mary Anne)
I really wanna tell you Mary Anne, Mary Anne
I'm thinking of you Mary Anne, Mary Anne (goodnight Mary Anne)
I really wanna tell you Mary Anne, Mary Anne, Mary Anne
