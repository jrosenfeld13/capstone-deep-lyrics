Circus never ending - laughing clown in the lion's den
My fatally wounded production line in my human mind

The stranglehold behind my grin, A schizophrenic Siamese twin
Destroying me so silently, Guiding voice sat behind my wheel

The voices in my head
Speak and I will follow, come what may
The voices inside of me
Cannot control what I can't see
Cannot control, the voices guiding me

Voices self inflicting - flooded mind my confusion reigns
Threefold my infection - cathedral drowns echoes pull me down

Persecuted, on me they prey - like vultures round an R.T.A
Behind my mask, hidden lives - all the violent voices I despise
