One by one we've broke each vow we made
It was you who lied it was me who paid
As sure as there's a heaven beyond the sun
We'll pay for our lies one by one

My plans and hopes have tumbled down
My castle of dreams plunged to the ground
How can you face me after what you've done
You've shattered my dreams one by one
One by one...

How can you go to sleep at night
Don't know mem'ries make you long for daylight
You'll pay the price after having your fun
You'll regret each mistake one by one
The love I treasured you sold for gold
And then you left me cold
You're happy now but the time will come
Your false love will lead you one by one
One by one...
