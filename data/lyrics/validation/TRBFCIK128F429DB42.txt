I only knew you for a while, I never saw your smile
Till it was time to go, time to go away (time to go away)
Sometimes it's hard to recognise, love comes as a surprise
And it's too late, it's just too late to stay, too late to stay

We'll always be together, however far it seems (love never ends)
We'll always be together, together in electric dreams

Because the friendship that you gave
Has taught me to be brave
No matter where I go
I'll never find a better prize (find a better prize)

Though you're miles and miles away, I see you every day
I don't have to try, I just close my eyes, I close my eyes

We'll always be together, however far it seems (love never ends)
We'll always be together, together in electric dreams

We'll always be together, however far it seems (love never ends)
We'll always be together, together in electric dreams

We'll always be together, however far it seems (love never ends)
We'll always be together, together in electric dreams

We'll always be together, however far it seems
We'll always be together, together in electric dreams
