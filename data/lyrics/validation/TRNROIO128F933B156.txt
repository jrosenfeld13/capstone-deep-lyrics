The sun would shine upon my face
If I could only slow this pace
But I will not see the light today
Things to do and bills to pay

In my dreams
I will sleep like a baby

Brother is that your rifle there?
And do you know the man
In the middle of the crosshairs?
No I do not know my
Enemys name
So much easier to kill
Him that way
In my dreams
I will sleep like a baby

I will take the long way home
I will take the long way home....

The sap is rising in the trees
And I will fall upon my knees
'cause the songbird tells me as she sings
Machines can not make sweeter dreams

In my dreams
I will sleep like a baby
