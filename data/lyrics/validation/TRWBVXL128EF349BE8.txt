Don't you know what you're doing is bound to failYou're a puppy dog chasing the same ol' tailThe face is different but the heart remainsThe same ol' lover with a brand new name
You're burning the candle at both ends sonWhen you gonna learn that the fire is hotIf you always do what you've always doneYou always get what you always got
You're robbin' the house thinkin you won't get caughtEverytime you lose you say it ain't your faultYou keep on doin what you've been doin againThinkin what you did'll have a different end
Chorus
Life is a lesson and the lesson I've learnIs the choice you make is gonna be long termIf there's anything brother that I can sayIs that you'll pay tomorrow for what you do today
Chorus
