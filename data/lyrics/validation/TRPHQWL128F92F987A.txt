As above so below
All things come from the one
Now you are the victim, carried by the wind
Rooted in the ground
If you want to learn the secrets
Close your eyes

The ladder falls away
At the gates of Urizen
Fallen eagles blaze
At the gates of Urizen
Eternal twins are damned
At the gates of Urizen
Separate lives began

In every woman is a man
From the moon come silver ghosts
Spectres of the blood
From my spirit comes the darkness
From the void the crimson fortress rises

At the gates of Urizen
The ladder falls away
At the gates of Urizen
Fallen eagles blaze
At the gates of Urizen
Eternal twins are damned
At the gates of Urizen
Separate lives begin

At the gates of Urizen
The ladder falls away
At the gates of Urizen
Fallen eagles blaze
At the gates of Urizen
Eternal twins are damned
At the gates of Urizen
Separate lives begin

At the gates of Urizen
At the gates
