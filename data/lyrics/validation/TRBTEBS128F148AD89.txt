[Verse 1]
I would like to believe
That the things that bring me down
And the life I lead
Are one and the same and no different
Pick your mind to conceive
Of a way to pick you up
Cause you might just be going
Down, down, down, and so

[Chorus]
When your will breaks down, will you pick you up?
Have you had enough?
Yes, I've had enough

[Post-Chorus]
Yes, I've had enough

[Verse 2]
Getting bored as I speak
On a simple lesson taught
All in one bad week
When it seemed just like we had lost everything
You awake from the night
Sometimes riding golden sun
And the heat rises
Off the ground, ground, ground, and so

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Do you think if you try
Then you'll calm down?
If I scream at the sky
Will you come down?
If I could, you know that I would
Turn it around
But the things that pick me up
Bring me down, down, down, and so

[Refrain]
Have you had enough?
Yes, I've had enough

[Chorus]
