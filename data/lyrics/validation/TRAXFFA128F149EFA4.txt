If you were to ask me, how long I've been running for
I don't even think that I could answer
I just don't know anymore
I'm a sucker for weakness
And the blood covering my floor
Is all that I have left to remind me
Of the girls I loved before

Believe me when I say that I love you, angel
(Because I do) (x2)
But accidents will happen
(And they do)

Courtesy came calling with her best friend common sense
Unaware that malice and manipulation had taken up residence
Caring came to the crime scene, but bloodlust beat them back
So apathy could laugh with his compadre
And anger could attack...anger could attack

Belive me when I say that I love you angel, because I do
But accidents will happen, and they do
Belive me when I say that I love you angel, because I do
But accidents will happen, and they do

Hey honey hold my hand and hope for heaven
Because I just can't help myself
Even angels end up burned and buried in my backyard
And you, you're just like everyone else
