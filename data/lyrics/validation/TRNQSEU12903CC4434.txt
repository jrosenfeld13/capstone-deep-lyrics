[Verse 1]
Some people think he's good looking
Other people think he's not
Some people don't even know his name
Other people know it by heart
Some people think he likes to go out dancing
Other people not
One guy I know thinks he's hard to get along with

[Chorus 1]
But a lot of people think he's fine
Yeah, yeah, a lot of people think he's fine
And he don't even know
Just sees how each day goes

[Verse 2]
Some people say she's funny
Other people say she's dumb
Some people say she's stuck-up
Others say she's shy
Some people like her for her charm
Some people take her for granted

[Chorus 2]
Some people want to steal her heart
Yeah, some people want to steal her heart
And she don't even know
How could that be so?
