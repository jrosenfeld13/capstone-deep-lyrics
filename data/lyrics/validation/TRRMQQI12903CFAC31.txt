This is the real world made wrong made right
Or maybe just made
You waste my time with explanations
So all the big colours fade

So you want to be happy
So you want to be happy
So you want to be happy
Don't you know happy is never enough

Looking for big answers getting nowhere
But then you're swimming in the shallow end
You take these broken bones
I'll tell you something, these things don't mend

So you want to be happy
So you want to be happy
So you want to be happy
Don't you know happy is never enough

I'm on the wrong train I can tell
'Cause I'm the only one who thinks so
Hard on the heels of getting somewhere
But there are things that we don't know

So you want to be happy
So you want to be happy
So you want to be happy
Don't you know happy is never enough
