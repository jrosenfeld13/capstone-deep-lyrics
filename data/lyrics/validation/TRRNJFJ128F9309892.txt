Endless train of thought running through my mind
Things aren't what they seem in these treacherous times
Currents shift
We swim against the tide

Unbelievers dressed in smiling suede
Can't fill the void
Can't dull the blade
All counterfeit and gimcrack cheats selling the truth!

This generation knows it
This desolation shows it
This detonation can lift you high

Fascination feeds on jagged lives
With a silver palm and a bunch of fives
Setting your feet on a one way street
It's a road to ruin!

This generation knows it
This desolation shows it
This detonation can lift you high

Detonate my dreams
Detonate my dreams

Turning back the clock reverse in time
Talking sideways with no reason or rhyme
All by themselves in a private hell
The chosen few

This generation knows it
This desolation shows it
This detonation can lift you high

This generation knows it
This desolation shows it
This detonation can lift you high
