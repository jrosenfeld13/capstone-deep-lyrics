You're always dancing down the street
With your suede blue eyes
And every new boy that you meet
He doesn't know the real surprise

(here she comes again)
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky
Oo, she'll make you flip
(here she comes again)
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky
I kinda like the way she dips
Well she's my best friend's girl
She's my best friend's girl-irl
But she used to be mine

You've got your nuclear boots
And your drip dry glove
Oo when you bite your lip
It's some reaction to love, o-ove, o-ove
(here she comes again)
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky
Yeah, I think you'll flip
(here she comes again)
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky
(here she comes again)
I kinda like the way, I like the way she dips
'cause she's my best friend's girl
Well she's my best friend's girl-irl
And she used to be mine
She's so fine

You're always dancing down the street
With your suede blue eye-eyes
And every new boy that you meet
Doesn't know the real surprise

(here she comes again)
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky
(here she comes again)
Oh, she'll make you flip
(here she comes again)
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky
(here she comes again)
I kinda like the way, I like the way she dips
'cause she's my best friend's girl, uh
She's my best friend's girl-irl-u-irl
She used to be mine
She so, fine

(my best friend's girlfriend)
Oh
(my best friend's girlfriend)
She used to be mine
(my best friend's girlfriend)
Yeah yeah
(my best friend's girlfriend)
Said she used to be mine
(my best friend's girlfriend)
Oh, yeah yeah yeah
(my best friend's girlfriend)
She used to be mine
(my best friend's girlfriend)
