The lights on the westway go on
A million cars hurry home
An ice-cream van shuts off its tinsel bells
Winter won't be long

I see you everyday
I watch you as you walk down this way
We pass on the stairs on this council block
Too shy to find words to say

But your smile is a prayer that prays for love
And your heart is a kite that longs to fly
Allelujah, here I am
Let's cut the strings tonight

So meet me on the corner at eight
Let's get out of this place
We'll kiss the first of a million kisses
And let the past fall away

For your smile is a prayer that prays for love
And your heart is a kite that longs to fly
Allelujah, here I am
Let's cut the strings tonight

Yes, your smile is a prayer that prays for love
And your heart is a kite that longs to fly
Allelujah, here I am
Let's cut the strings tonight

Yes, your smile is a prayer that prays for love
And your heart is a kite that longs to fly
Allelujah, here I am
We'll cut the strings tonight
And we'll kiss the first of a million kisses, ah
