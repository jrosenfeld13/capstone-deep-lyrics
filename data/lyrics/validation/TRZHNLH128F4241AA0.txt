[Chorus]
I will never know
Cause you will never show
Come on and love me now
Come on and love me now
I will never know
Cause you will never show
Come on and love me now
Come on and love me now
Come on and love me now

[Verse 1]
Carnival
Came by my town today
Bright lights from giant wheels
Fall on the alleyways
And I'm here
By my door
Waiting for you

[Chorus]
I will never know
Cause you will never show
Come on and love me now
Come on and love me now
I will never know
Cause you will never show
Come on and love me now
Come on and love me now
Come on and love me now

[Verse 2]
I hear sounds of lovers
Barrel organs, mothers
I would like to take you
Down there just
To make you mine
In a merry-go-round

[Chorus]
I will never know
Cause you will never show
Come on and love me now
Come on and love me now
I will never know
Cause you will never show
Come on and love me now
Come on and love me now
Come on and love me now

[Outro]
Come on and love me now
Come on and love me now
Come on and love me now
Come on and love me now
Come on and love me now
Come on and love me now
Come on and love me now
