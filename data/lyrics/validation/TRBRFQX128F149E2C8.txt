Look at these stills
Automatically shot
Paramount pictures
Ain't provin' alot

Look at these pills
Is it all that I got
Doesn't make me feel good
But I'm talkin a lot

And what do you see
From bottom to top
Funtime & friends

Yeah we're all moving up
I want the deck not the card
I'm gonna fake a new start
Gonna clean up my garbage
And sell it like art

Chemical nation
Look at the state you're in
Chemical nation
Don't stop at the start rebegin

Look at my feet
Look at my shoes
From way down to top
I can laugh at the clues

You can take away food
Take away beds
Taking the waves
Are they girls are they pets

And what does it mean
And where did it go
Pile up my bullshit
Where I cannot go

And where does it stop?
How long does it last
Affraid of what they call
The chemical past

Chemical nation
Look at the state you're in
Chemical nation
Don't stop at the start rebegin
Yeah what is that?
Is it only?
Like trenches
In the sidewalks to gold
Yeah where does it comes from?
Communer income?
Your little tina's on her away
To the toplesss ball
