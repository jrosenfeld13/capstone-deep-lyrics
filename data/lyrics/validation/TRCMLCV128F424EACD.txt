[Verse 1]
Beyond the boundaries of your city's lights
Stand the heroes waiting for your cries
So many times you did not bring this on yourself
When that moment finally comes
I'll be there to help

[Hook]
On that day when you need
Your brothers and sisters to care
I'll be right here

[Chorus]
Citizen soldiers
Holding the light for the ones that we guide
From the dark of despair
Standing on guard for the ones that we sheltered
We'll always be ready
Because we will always be there

[Verse 2]
When there are people crying in the streets
When they're starving for a meal to eat
When they simply need a place to make their beds
Right here underneath my wing
You can rest your head

[Hook]
On that day when you need
Your brothers and sisters to care
I'll be right here

[Chorus]
Citizen soldiers
Holding the light for the ones that we guide
From the dark of despair
Standing on guard for the ones that we sheltered
We'll always be ready
Because we will always be there

[Bridge]
There... there... there...

[Verse 3]
Hope and pray that you'll never need me
But rest assured I will not let you down
I'll walk beside you but you may not see me
The strongest among you may not wear a crown

[Hook]
On that day when you need
Your brothers and sisters to care
I'll be right here

[Hook 2]
On that day when you don't have the strength
For the burden you bear
I'll be right here

[Chorus]
Citizen soldiers
Holding the light for the ones that we guide
From the dark of despair
Standing on guard for the ones that we sheltered
We'll always be ready
Because we will always be there
