It can feel so good to run away, I know the feeling
But you're not this person here today, your secrets keep you
Standing on the edge of what you'd be
Standing on the edge of what you'd be

And when you say what you saw, I'll be right there
Helping you feel through the years
Hiding your fear doesn't help you but I'm here
Helping you feel through the years

Open up your mouth and say the words
You know the ones
You danced around as if you never heard
Them spoken, stop pretending
'Cause this is what you need

And when you say what you saw, I'll be right there
Helping you feel through the years
Hiding your fear doesn't help you but I'm here
Helping you feel through the years

Oh, I was the first to serve and do
Be every move you make
And I'll be the last one to go on
From your life

And when you say what you saw, I'll be right there
Helping you feel through the years
Hiding your fear doesn't help you but I'm here
Helping you feel through the years

Oh, I was the first to serve and do
Be every move you made
And I'll be the last one to go on
From your life

Right there
Helping you feel through the years
Helping you feel, helping you feel, yeah
Helping you feel through the years
