[Verse 1]
When I sleep
I have dreams about the way we used to kiss
About the way you used to hold me
And say nothing would ever harm me
When we first met
Oh how you charmed me
Made me smile when I was down
Big pimping around the town
You and me
Whenever they'd see you
They'd see me
A lover and a friend to me you were
How did it end?
How it hurts
To not have you in my life
When I wanted to be your wife

[Pre-Chorus]
You never know what you have
Till its gone
Treated you wrong
For so long
Now you're gone away
But the love still lives here

[Chorus 1]
Still
I still got love for you
Still
After all we've been through
Still
I gave my heart to you
And baby, you're the only one

[Chorus 2]
There's other men than you
Still
They can come close to you
Still
Once I said I love you
I knew you'd be the only one

[Verse 2]
A good man you were to me
Always there to care
Would do anything in this world for me
Didn't matter, what, when, or where
You were there
I never thought we'd part from the arguments we'd start
When I just wanted to get some attention
And I'm sorry baby for bitching
If I could take back the words
That I said to make you leave
I'd be down on bended knees
Asking you to please forgive me

[Pre-Chorus]
You never know what you have
Till it's gone
Treated you wrong
For so long
Now you're gone away
But the love still lives here

[Chorus 1]
Still
I still got love for you
Still
After all we've been through
Still
I gave my heart to you
And baby, you're the only one

[Chorus 2]
There's other men than you
Still
They can come close to you
Still
Once I said I love you
I knew you'd be the only one

[Pre-Chorus]
You never know what you have
Till it's gone
Treated you wrong
For so long
Now you're gone away
But the love still lives here

[Chorus 1]
Still
I still got love for you
Still
After all we've been through
Still
I gave my heart to you
And baby, you're the only one
