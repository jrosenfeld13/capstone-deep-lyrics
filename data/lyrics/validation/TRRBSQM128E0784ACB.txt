[Verse 1]
It starts in my belly, then up to my heart
Into my mouth, I can't keep it shut
Do you recognize the smell?
Is that how you tell us apart?

[Non-Lyrical Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I fool myself to sleep and dream
Nobody's here, no one but me
So cool, you're hardly there
Why can't this be killing you?

[Non-Lyrical Chorus]

[Post-Chorus]
Frankenstein would want your mind
Your lovely head, your lovely head

[Outro]
Your lovely head
