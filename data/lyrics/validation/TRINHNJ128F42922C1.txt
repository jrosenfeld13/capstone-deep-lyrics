My mama done tol' me
When I was in pig tails
My mama done tol' me
Hon, A man is gonna sweet talk
Give ya the big eye;
But when the sweet talkin's done
A man is a two face
A worrisome thing
Who'll leave ya t'sing
The blues in the night
Now the rain's a fallin'
Hear the train a collin'
Whoo-ee (my mama done tol' me)
Hear the lonesome whistle
Blowin' cross the trestle
Whoo-ee (my mama done tol' me)
A whoo-ee-duh-whoo-ee, ol' clickety clack's
An echoin' back th' blues in the night
The evenin' breeze will start the trees to cryin'
And the moon'll hide its light
When you get the blues in the night
Take my word, the mockin' bird'll
Sing the saddest kind o' song
He knows things are wrong and he's right
From Natchez to Mobile
From Memphis to St. Joe
Wherever the four winds blow
I been in some big towns
An' heard me some big talk
But there is one thing I know
A man is a two face
A worrisome thing
Who'll leave ya t'sing the blues in the night
My mama was right, there's blues in the night
