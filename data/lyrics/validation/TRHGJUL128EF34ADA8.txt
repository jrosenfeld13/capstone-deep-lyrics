Starting out with nothing
As I climb the trips
Miles in the horizon
And never looking back

I lie, it tasted like
And even paid the dues
I wanna ride the back crew
And let me see it new

Don't wanna wait forever
Don't wanna waste my time
Don't wanna wait for something to come
And never pass me by

Don't wanna step in front
Don't wanna cause a scene
I need to stop getting hurt
I need to get back to work

I'm tired of kicking up dirt
I'm tired of making it worse
I wanna see the sunset
I wanna live this world

Don't wanna wait forever
Don't wanna waste my time
Don't wanna wait for something to come
And never pass me by

Don't wanna wait for
Don't wanna wait for
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't wanna

Don't wanna wait forever
Don't wanna waste my time
Don't wanna wait for something to come
And never pass me by

Don't wanna wait forever
Don't wanna waste my time
Don't wanna wait for something to come
And never pass me by

Don't wanna wait forever
Don't wanna waste my time
Don't wanna wait for something to come
And never pass me by
