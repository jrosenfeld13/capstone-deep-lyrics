Jackie got married on Valentine's Day
It was a lovely wedding
He met his bride on the interstate
Seventeen miles from Connecticut
At least that's what Jackie said
Ruby told me she wished she were dead
And I hold all these things in my heart
Bobby got shot on Independence Day
He was a fine young preacher
Till they carved his heart away
Ruby said he would want it that way
I don't really know what to say
And I hold all these things in my heart
I've got no infant Messiah
I've got no gabardine prose
I've just got five hundred dollars
That nobody knows about
I'll give you my money
I will sell you my soul
If you would just hold these things
If you would just hold these things in your heart
