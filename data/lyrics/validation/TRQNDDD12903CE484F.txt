I remember the moment you told me
Our love was lost and ooh
How it split me in two pieces
Never thought you'd be so cruel
So calm and so cool

Stop for a second and see
Can you see, can you see?

Look back, baby, it's your heartbox missing a beat
'Cause it's me that's walking
On the sunny side of the street
In the sunshine, in the sunshine

Well I guess I was wrong
When I thought I heard my heart say
That you must be the one
'Cause it's only a couple of weeks now
And it's already gone

Yes she's already gone
And now I'm moving on and on, and on

Look back, baby, it's your heartbox missing a beat
'Cause it's me that's walking
On the sunny side of the street

Look back, baby, it's your heartbox missing a beat
'Cause it's me that's walking
On the sunny side of the street
In the sunshine

You said it was over
Over, it's over, you said it was over
I'm not the one looking over my shoulder

You said it was over
Over, it's over, you said it was over
I'm not the one looking over my shoulder
Looking over your shoulder
Stop for a second and see

Look back, baby, it's your heartbox missing a beat
Look back, baby, it's your heartbox missing a beat
'Cause it's me that's walking
On the sunny side of the street
Me that's walking, me that's walking on

Look back, baby, it's your heartbox missing a beat
'Cause it's me that's walking
On the sunny side of the street
Look back, baby, it's your heartbox missing a beat

Oh, look back, baby, it's your heartbox missing a beat
'Cause it's me that's walking
On the sunny side of the street

Is my heartbox, is my heartbox missing a beat?
In the sunshine, in the sunshine
Feels all right
In the sunshine, in the sunshine
Feels all right
