[Verse 1]
Lunatone, a girl who shimmers through my dreams
And in the glow of twilight her beauty sings, it sings
Lunatone, bring me your love
Lunatone, bring me your...

[Verse 2]
Your light I'll love forever
Until the end of time
Someday we'll die together
Love's purity enshrined
Lunatone, bring me your love
Lunatone, bring me your...

[Chorus]
What would I do without my Lunatone?
Your light means everything to me
You make the night so perfect
Without you I'm lost
Open your arms to me

[Verse 3]
And when the clouds come over
And I cannot see your light
Hold fast to our love, darling
Everything will be all right
Lunatone, bring me your love
Lunatone, bring me your...

[Chorus]
What would I do without my Lunatone?
Your light means everything to me
You make the night so perfect
Without you I'm lost
Open your arms to me
