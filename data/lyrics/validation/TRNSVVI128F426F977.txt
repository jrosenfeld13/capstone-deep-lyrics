The, the, the tongue of romance

With the gift of gab
A tongue well understood
A tongue in your skin
A tongue in your neck

A smooth tongue
A biting tongue
To whisper sweet nothings
The tongue of love

In your depths
One understands by heart
These moments less heavy and sad
The seducing words

A sumptuous tongue
In your bitter mouth
Watered silk which gives pleasure
The tongue of love

The tongue of love
Spoken here in France
The common tongue
For singing a Cha, Cha, Cha

A French kiss
A parting of the lips
From Brest to Aix le Bain
A spell of enchantments
A languid lapping dance
The tongue of romance

The tongue of romance
Like a beautiful flower
Which opens to the sunrise
And wakes the sleeping pussy

In this languorous night
A soft and caressing tongue
A lapidary phrase
The tongue of pleasure
