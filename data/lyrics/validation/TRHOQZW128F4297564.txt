[Verse 1]
What if I told you
It was all meant to be
Would you believe me
Would you agree
It's almost that feeling
That we've met before
So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy
When I tell you love has come and now

[Chorus]
A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss
Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this

[Verse 2]
Everything changes
But beauty remains
Something so tender
I can't explain
Well I maybe Dreamin
But till I awake
Can we make this dream last forever
And I'll cherish all the love we share

[Chorus]
A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss
Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this

[Verse 3]
Could this be the greatest love of all
I want to know that you will catch me when I fall
So let me tell you this
Some people wait a lifetime

[Chorus]
A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this
Some people search forever
For that one special kiss
Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this

[Outro]
Oh, like this oh, I can't believe it's happening to me

Some people wait a lifetime
For a moment like this

Oh, like this
