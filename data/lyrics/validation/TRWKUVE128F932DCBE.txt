Part time lovers
Arrange to meet
Stony hearts
Almost beat
Dressed to kill
Make your mark
Conversation razor sharp

Shooting stars glow and fade
In and out of love as seasons change
Torn between the lust and pain
Cant give it up, cant get enough

Going to stir it around
Turn it upside down
Push it ride it twist it inside out

This is love, a strange love
This is love, a strange love
This is love, a strange love
This is love, Strangelove

Aim at target
Pull the trigger
Slip a ring
On your finger
Weddings plans
Stony broke
Conversation
Up in smoke

Fight it out, run away
Ripping up the rules, the games we play
Talk about it, cast round for blame
Cant give it up, cant get enough

Going to stir it around
Turn it upside down
Push it ride it twist it inside out

This is love, a strange love
This is love, a strange love
This is love, a strange love
This is love, Strangelove
