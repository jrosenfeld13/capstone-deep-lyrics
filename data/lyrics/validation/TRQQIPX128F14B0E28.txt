On a cloudy summer afternoon
We sat and waited for the raindrops
Pitter patter of the raindrops
Fell in love, fell in love

Time was passing by the shadows fell
I never noticed when the rain stopped
Pitter patter of the raindrops
I fell in love, I fell in love

We read the paper
As we laid on the floor
Smoking that last cigarette

Nothing was said
For an hour or more
But I can never forget

How the time was passing by
The shadows fell
I never noticed when the rain stopped
Pitter patter of the raindrops
I fell in love, oh, I fell in love

Oh, we read the paper
As we laid on the floor
Smoking that last cigarette

Nothing was said
For an hour or more
But I can never forget

It was on a cloudy summer afternoon
We sat and waited for the raindrops
Pitter patter of the raindrops
I fell in love

Oh, we fell in love (raindrops)
Me and my girl fell in love (raindrops)
