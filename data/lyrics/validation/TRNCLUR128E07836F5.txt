[Verse 1]
Damsel in distress is quite submissive
Look how sun burnt my vanity is
Effeminate human creature
Superficial, seducing detour
I'm going to the mall for the cookie-cutter
The ugly duckling will always suffer
Contaminated standards, don't try to fight it
I better get back on my diet

[Chorus]
Obsessed with the beauty contest
Beauty contest
How'd my vanity get such a mess?
Beauty contest
I'm obsessed

[Verse 2]
Reduce myself, I've got the strict restrictions
Not sexy enough without the regulations
Molten point countdown my fading features
Born to blossom and bloom to perish

[Chorus]
Obsessed with the beauty contest
Beauty contest
I've got to get out of this mess
Beauty contest
I'm obsessed

[Verse 3]
And I've fallen, I can't help myself
I'm feeling envious of all the rest
You're bringing out the lemming in me
A victim of the cattle-call disease
Not easy to be me
I feel swollen

[Chorus]
Obsessed with the beauty contest
Beauty contest
How'd my vanity get such a mess?
Obsessed with the beauty contest
Obsessed with the beauty contest
Beauty contest
I've got to get out of this mess
Obsessed with the beauty contest
Obsessed with the beauty contest
Beauty contest
How'd my vanity get such a mess?
Caught up in the beauty contest [x5]

[Outro]
And I feel swollen
How'd my vanity get such a mess?
[Gwen's niece, Madeline] My vanity's a mess
