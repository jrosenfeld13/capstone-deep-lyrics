Shes got the time
Says shes got time on her side
Running the rule
Commanding the late boys eyes
She runs around, knows all the streets by name
So mysterious, shadows meet James Dean
Shes intoxicating, soon your favorite drink

Your black dress in disarray
Only dance floor prayers can save
Temperatures rise and I start to move
But its you thats coursing through my veins

Say shes got hope
Took shelter to the Hollywood list, taking control
Wanted my heart but I gave her my soul
Shes like a Page, Davis, with a Monroe kiss
Disappeared today, left no trace
But someday Ill know your name

Your black dress in disarray
Only dance floor prayers can save
But its you thats coursing through my veins

Dont need no drugs, youre my chemical
Now Im dependent, swear Im clinical
Addicted to those glances, taking chances tonight
I need a fix in those heroin eyes
Dont need no drugs, youre my chemical
Now Im dependent, no not cynical
Addicted to those glances, taking chances tonight
I need a fix in those heroin eyes

Shes no saint (shes no saint), shes no saint
Shes no saint but shell take you to your knees
Try her boy, but shell still do what she please
Do you believe in science? Shes perfect chemistry
She wanted my love but I gave her the rest of me

Dont need no drugs, youre my chemical
Now Im dependent, swear Im clinical
Addicted to those glances, taking chances tonight
I need a fix in those heroin eyes
Dont need no drugs, youre my chemical
Now Im dependent, no not cynical
Addicted to those glances, taking chances tonight
I need a fix in those heroin eyes

Youll adore me before the night is over

If Londons calling dont you dare pick up the phone
Only you entwined
Could make this orphan feel at home
Lips that need no introduction, but now waiting for your call
If pictures worth a thousand words
Then your touch is worth them all

Dont need no drugs, youre my chemical
Now Im dependent, swear Im clinical
Addicted to those glances, taking chances tonight
I need a fix in those heroin eyes
Dont need no drugs, youre my chemical
Now Im dependent, no not cynical
Addicted to those glances, taking chances tonight
I need a fix in those heroin eyes
