Now I heard that you've been lookin' for some lovin'
Someone to take you by the hand, ha...ah...
I want you to know I got plenty of honey
What I'm saying is, "Baby, here I am"

Rescue me, I need your lovin'
Rescue me, I need some tender lovin' care
Rescue me, I need your lovin'
And I guarantee I'll make you so very happy

For so long I've been waitin' and waitin'
For someone like you to come along, ho...ho...oh...
Deep inside it's got me wantin' and achin'
For you to fill me with your charms

Rescue me, I need your lovin'
Rescue me, I need some tender lovin' care
Rescue me, I need your lovin'
And I guarantee I'll make you so very happy

Rescue me, I need your lovin'
Rescue me, I need some tender lovin' care
Rescue me, I need your lovin'
And I guarantee I'll make you so very happy

Rescue me, I need your lovin'
Rescue me, I need some tender lovin' care
Rescue me, I need your lovin'
And I guarantee I'll make you so very happy

Rescue me, I need your lovin'
Rescue me, I need some tender lovin' care
Rescue me, I need your lovin'
And I guarantee I'll make you so very happy
