Headin' for the sun in your quiet way
Like a ghost dressed in summer clothes
Take your time down that tender road

When you go across the lane
You (??)
Like a boat left out in the Seine

Won't you be on your own, on your own?

Without a name, all alone

Won't you be on your own, on your own?

Without a name, all alone
