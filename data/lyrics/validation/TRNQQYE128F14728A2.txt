Stop start and come back
Stop start and come back
Stop start and come back
Changing what you know

Everytime forever
Every now and never
Everyone together
Come on and feel the flow

You stepped into the future (future)
Into the great divide
You stepped into the future (future)
And it's opening wide

Yesterday is waiting
Here today and moving
Tomorrow's still returning
Let go of what you know

Everytime forever
Every now and never
Everyone together
Come on and feel it flow

You stepped into the future (future)
And it's where you're at
You stepped into the future (future)
When there's no turning back

From where you're at you can't turn back you can't turn back
From where you're at you can't turn back you can't turn back
