[Verse 1]
Well, I jumped outta bed and I hollered hallelujah
For there ain't another soul in sight
I sing a little song as I fix my coffee
'Cause she's really gone, alright

[Chorus 1]
Put on my old blue jeans and my Levi jacket
I'm gonna have all the fun I can
Tonight I'm really gonna be myself
And you're looking at a happy man

[Verse 2]
Well, my baby left with all of my money
And nearly everything that I had
She thinks I'm a-sitting at home a crying
But I'm far from being sad

[Verse 3]
She had me a-being somebody I wasn't
But it's good to me again
Now I'm free as a breeze I do as I please
And you're looking at a happy man

[Verse 4]
Everything's gone and I ain't got nothing
But I don't need nothing but time
There ain't a thing I miss I like it like this
Lord, I got an easy mind

[Chorus 2]
Well, I'm not the same I made a big change
I want everyone to understand
This old country boy is jumping for joy
And your looking at a happy man

[Verse 5]
Well, I jumped outta bed and I said God almighty
There's ain't naked woman in sight
She thinks I'm a-sitting at home a crying
But everything'll be alright

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 6]
Everything's gone and I ain't got nothing
But I don't need nothing but time
There ain't a thing I miss I like it like this
Lord, I got an easy mind

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
This old country boy is jumping for joy
And your looking at a happy man
