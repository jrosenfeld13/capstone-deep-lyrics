VERSE # 1

Sit around and watch TV
God I hate what I see
Lock me up and throw away the key
I'll spend my time chugging tea

CHANNEL

But I can't, it's not fair
Think about it, while getting gray hair

CHORUS

Well it's just another phase that I'll go through
This time I'm sure I'll lose you
Place my bets on all the Jacks and Queens
The probability being that it seems
I'm blind, I'm blind

VERSE # 2

Throw my change down a machine
Buy a chocolate bar so I can dream
Another day goes down the drain
Wash away, ya wash away the pain

CHANNEL

CHORUS (repeat, tag)
