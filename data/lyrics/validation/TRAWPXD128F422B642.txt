"My friend" come to the end
Fuck off I'm sick of your words
And the way you shout loud
"I'm proud, I'm proud"
Proud to be a German and proud to be white
But your eyes aren't blue
What a shame, oh look at you
Alone a piece of shit, but strong in a crowd
Then you loose your cowardice
And another black girl cries

God damn your kind

Refrain:
For our history from the past
Until today there is the black
And the red is for the blood
Of the millions that was shed
For the exploitation of the poor
There is the gold on our flag
Is it that what are you proud of
You patriotic pack

You wear the Belgium colours
You thought it is the German flag
Oh, I know what do you hide
Behind your national pride
It is stupidity
But it's too dangerous to ignore
Your welcome friend is silence
This time we'll offer resistance
You poison this country
With shit that you've been told
That your race is the best, better than the rest

God damn your kind

Refrain
