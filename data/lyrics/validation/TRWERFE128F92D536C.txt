Well you're living on the street and craving something hot
That's simmering in a dumpster down by Popeye's parking lot
Smell the rich aroma: a fragrance to entice
Of dirty deep fried chicken and dirty dirty rice
Dirty deep fried chicken and dirty dirty rice

All my bros on Sunset know there's nothing to compete
No flop or rescue mission serves nutrition so complete
Its downright good eatin', and there's just no beatin' the price
Of dirty deep fried chicken and dirty dirty rice
Dirty deep fried chicken and dirty dirty rice

Yuppies think I'm a wino 'cause I seem to have no class
Girls think I'm perverted 'cause I watch them as they pass
Cops think I'm a drug-hound, but I only have one vice:
Dirty deep fried chicken and dirty dirty rice
Dirty deep fried chicken and dirty dirty rice

Frying chickens in the sun...
Politicians have their

Fundraising dinners, their fine filet of sole
Their creme d' escargot and their nouveau casserole
They can have all the caviar, the pink champagne on ice
Gimme dirty deep fried chicken and dirty dirty rice
Dirty deep fried chicken and dirty dirty rice
Dirty deep fried chicken and dirty dirty rice
