Why can't they be like they used to be only yesterday
Ooh, bring back my sunshine day

I look at things that once were mine with such despair
Why do the things I say only fall on empty air?
Ooh, bring back my sunshine day
My mind cries, bring back my sunshine day

I say the things I used to say, but they don't seem right
Why does this world seem like the darkest endless night?
Ooh, bring back my sunshine day
Bring back my sunshine day

Why can't they be like they used to be only yesterday
Ooh, bring back my sunshine day
