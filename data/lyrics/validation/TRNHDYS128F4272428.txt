Hey blood you're leakin!
I ain't your average, I ain't your norm
From hard rock to quiet storm
I'm leakin' on adjacent station
Spreadin' my funk all across the nation
On your feet on VCR
A.M./F.M
And in your car
If I'm bleedin', I'm a blood brother
Blood is thicker than mud muther                                                    If I'm bleedin', I'm a blood brother
Blood is thicker than mud muther
I'm leakin' (like so many, so many boys and girls)
I'm leakin' (that make me stink... mmmh!)                   Sometimes I'm leakin' (like so many, so many)
And then I'm leakin' (that make me stink)
I'm stickin' (stickin'...radio)
I'm peakin' (peakin'...stereo)
Sometimes I'm creepin' (creepin'... video)
Right now I'm leakin' (leakin'...into a TV show)
I ain't your average, I ain't your norm
From hard rock to quiet storm
I'm leakin' on adjacent station
Spreadin' my funk all across the nation
Turn me up, turn me down
Turn me off and I'm still around
If I'm bleedin', I'm a blood brother
Blood is thicker than mud, ain't it
Blood is thicker than mud, ain't it
