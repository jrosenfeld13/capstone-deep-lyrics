[Verse 1]
Didn't sleep last night
Couldn't calm down
Cold water running past my window
Kept me crying out

Give me sunlight
The good medicine
It's all part of the open pressures
Of growing up

[Hook]
Met a friend, but then again
You could get around town like they do
Have a shower then drive around
Looking out for Northfields Avenue, oh

The journey's sour, the fire's out
Love achieving sounds sell a heart of glue
Have a listen a dirty mind
Moving matters untold residue

[Bridge]
It's all evolution's fault now
It's all down to echoes in the crowd
It's all evolution's fault now
It's all down to echoes in the crowd

It's all evolution's fault now
It's all down to echoes in the crowd
