[Verse 1]
Kiss kiss, the babies
Got to have the hanging man
Shock you clean
Till the penal hits the pentane
Free yourself
Because I could shock you down
You kill yourself please?
Because you're already gone
Now in time it seems like I am coming
No drone that says I'm already there
I'm standing on the roof of the world

[Chorus]
Mayday

[Verse 2]
You won't be saved
From the builder in the morning sun
You won't be spared
From cheating at your solitaire
Your bootleg soul
Put the freedom in past form
The jokes on you
But now you're living in vain
I'm putting in my 2 weeks notice
As of 2 fucking weeks ago
I'm not in your ranking anymore

[Chorus]
