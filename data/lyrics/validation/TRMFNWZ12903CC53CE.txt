You light up another cigarette
And I pour the wine
It's four o'clock in the morning
And it's starting to get light
Promise me you'll wait for me
'Cos I'll be saving all my love for you
And I will be home soon
Promise me you'll wait for me
I need to know you feel the same way too
And I'll be home, I'll be home soon
Promise me you'll wait for me
'Cos I'll be saving all my love for you
And I will be home soon
Promise me you'll wait for me
I need to know you feel the same way too
And I'll be home, I'll be home soon
