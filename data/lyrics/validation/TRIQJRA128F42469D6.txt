Looking at life
Through others eyes
Is the wrong solution
Hiding the fears that hold the cries
Creates the mind pollution
Reaching out from within the lies
And escape the illusion now
I know you
You know me
I'm all the things
In your dark that hide
I'm Coming
Your Going
One million miles right by your side
Your brightest hour
Is when I come to you
Your answers
Need questions
It's the wrong side of the right
Completion
Deletion
How convienent at the time
Look away but I am into you
