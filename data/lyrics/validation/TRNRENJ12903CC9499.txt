Oooooooh skat

Am I pleased to meet ya
Picture from the people
Somethin I got to teach ya

Oooooooh crack

You're quite the creature
Girl from the creature feature
Tasty like to eat ya
Thinkin' so nasty

Just got me feelin' so nasty

Oooooooh pop

I'll take you from the eighties
Bimbos rock the latex
Dingos gots the babies

But oooooooh stop

Look we're ready to rumble
Girlfriend can you show me
The way that the cookie crumble
Thinkin' so nasty

Just got me feelin' so na-

Keep it rockin baby
Don't try to hide it none
Give me somethin and I won't try to fight it none
All the troubles in my mind they don't feel so bad
When you got me in your palm slidin' in your hand

Oooooooh snap

Girls got to eat ya
Cookin' I gots a t-bone
Hungry I need to feed her

Oooooooh chun

Touched quite a female
Checked all the styles she show
Chick don't reply to email
Thinkin so nasty

Just got me feelin' so na-

Keep it rockin baby
Don't try to hide it none
Give me somethin and I won't try to fight it none
All the troubles in my mind they don't feel so bad
When you got me in your palm slidin' in your hand

Keep it pumpin' baby
Don't try to hide it no
Give me somethin and I won't try to fight it girl
All the problem in the world I don't understand
When you got me in your arm slidin' in your hand

Yippiyo-Ay
When you wear a smile

Yippiyo-Ay
When you rock a frown

Yippiyo-Ay
When you goin off

Yippiyo-Ay
When you comin down

Yippiyo-Ay
When I'm feelin bad

Yippiyo-Ay
When I'm feelin sad

Yippiyo-Ay
No it ain't so bad

Yippiyo-Ay
When I'm in your hands

Keep it rockin' baby
Don't try to hide it none
Give me somethin' and I won't try to fight it none
All the troubles in my mind they don't feel so bad
When you got me in your palm slidin' in your hands

Keep it pumpin' baby
Don't try to hide it none
Give me somethin and I won't try to fight it girl
All the problem in the world I don't understand
When you got me in your arm slidin' in your hand

Yippiyo-Ay

Give me somethin and I won't try to fight it none (Yippiyo-Ay)
All the troubles in my mind they don't feel so bad (Yippiyo-Ay)
