I said I've had visions of weeping
She said I've had the same about you
They come to me sometimes when I'm sleeping
I said that's a way for me too
Now it's been a long time and I don't have the mind
To justify what we've been through
Logic is fine and science can be kind
But it can't define me and you

Yet I thought I had something special to say
But this nightmarish world
Makes you throw your thoughts away
As though I was someone special today

We say why are the innocent bleeding
Is there not a thing we can do
They say please swallow this trust we are feeding
And don't worry, it's bad for you
Now it's been a long show and I thought you should know
It's time for us to play our hand
But words are much too slow they lost meaning years ago
Isn't that how this began

Some say now! The truth is before us
Others say oh no this is not real
Some say be cruel then they'll adore you
Others say you can't touch till you feel
Now its been a long trip and its only the tip
Of the iceberg I'm trying to melt
Our tickets have been ripped and you've got to bite your lip
When you think about the way that felt
