Rows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would've done
The clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's clouds illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairytale comes real
I've looked at love that way

But now it's just another show
You leave them laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let em know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take and still somehow
It's loves illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say, "I love you", right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well, something's lost but something's gained
In living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all
