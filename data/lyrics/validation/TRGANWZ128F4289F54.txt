Girl I can tell
You're thinkin' of leavin'
But it'll hurt me so much
You don't want me to know
You've done all you can
To hide what your feelin'
But one part of you let your feelings show

Oh your finger tips
Tell me you'll stay
And your tender lips
Say you won't go away
Your lovin arms
Make me think you're still mine
Oh girl if only your eyes could lie

So I say what's wrong
And you say its nothing
I can almost believe it
When I hold you like this

But I know in my heart
That there's no tomorrow
But just for tonight
I'll pretend that there it

Oh your finger tips
Tell me you'll stay
And your tender lips
Say you won't go away
Ohh your lovin arms
Make me think you're still mine
Oh girl if only your eyes could lie
Oh girl if only your eyes could lie
