Ladies and gentlemen, on our left is Neptune
Wake up you're going places without ever leaving a trace
This grace can help you wander, wake up you're going places
Without ever leaving a trace, smile on a little childs face

Ladies and gentlemen, on our right we have Mars
Wake up you're going places without ever leaving a trace
This grace can help you wander, wake up you're going places
Without ever leaving a trace, smile on a little childs face
Wake up you're going places without ever leaving a trace
Wake up we're going places

Ladies and gentlemen, on our left is Neptune
