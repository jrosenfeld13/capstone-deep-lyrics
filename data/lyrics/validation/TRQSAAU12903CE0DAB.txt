Peverett / Price - Knee Trembler Music, Inc - ASCAP

Thumbin' a ride to Geneva, standing in the falling rain
Getting dirty looks, I wish I could've took a train
Your friends said, "Why did you leave her?" - I had to make it on my own
Now I'm standing on the highway, tryin' to find my way alone

Well I got my home in my hand - travelin' across the land
Tryin' to earn a living, givin' everything I can

It's getting so hard to remember, it's even harder to forget
Well if I don't find a way, how'm I gonna pay my debt?

Well I got my home in my hand - travelin' across the land
Tryin' to earn a living, givin' everything I can

{Rod - Slide Solo}
Slide on!

Well I got my home in my hand - travelin' across the land
Tryin' to earn a living, givin' everything I can

Well I got my home in my hand - travelin' across the land
Tryin' to earn a living, givin' everything I can
Tryin' to earn a living, giving everything I can
(Home in my hand, home in my hand)
(Home in my hand, ho-o-ome in my hand)
Yes I've got my home (Home in my hand, home in my hand)
Ooh I've got my home (Home in my hand, ho-o-ome in my hand)
Well I've got my home in my hand
Yes I've got my home, home in my hand
Well you know I'm travelin' across the land
Yes I've got my home in my hand
Well I've got my home (home in my hand)
Well I've got my home (home in my hand)
Well I've got my home (home in my hand)
Yes I've got my home (ho-o-ome in my hand)
Yes I've got my home (home in my hand)
Well I've got my home (home in my hand)
You know I've got my home (home in my hand)
Well I've got my home (ho-o-ome in my hand)
Yes I got my home (home in my hand)
You know I got my home (home in my hand)
I said I got my home (home in my hand)
Yeah I got my home (ho-o-ome in my hand)
