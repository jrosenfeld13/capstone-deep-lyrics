Oh, baby
Still water runs deep
Ooh-ooh-ooh...
Oh-oh, oh, yeah

Into every life, short or long
A little bit of rain has got to fall
We've got to take it all in stride
Let thy will be done
He will always hear you when you call
Anytime you call
He will shine His faithful light
Into the darkness of the night
Whoa, baby

Still waters run deep
And some things mean forever
Like the stars in the sky
Like a love that never dies
Whoa, baby, still waters run deep
And I've got myself together
I believe in heaven above
And the power of love
Life is long for me and you

Into every life, a time will come
When you feel your back against the wall
Forget your foolish pride
Let thy kingdom come
And He will always be there when you call
Anytime you call
He will shine His faithful light
Into the darkness of the night
Whoa, baby

Still waters run deep
And some things mean forever
Like the stars in the sky
He's got a love that never dies
Whoa, baby, still waters run deep
I've got myself together
I believe in heaven above
And the power of love
Life is long for me and you
Oh, yeah

Winning His heart to be strong
Just remember what He said
If you believe, He'll make the way
And His love you can depend
You don't have to be afraid
His truth is the light
And we're all precious in His sight
Whoa, baby

Still waters run deep
And some things mean forever
Like the stars in the sky
Like the love that never dies
Whoa, baby, still waters run deep
I've got myself together
I believe in heaven above
And the power of love
Life is long for me and you...
