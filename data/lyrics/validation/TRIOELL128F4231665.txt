From the guy at the back with love to the girl up there
To the devil in Miss Jones even if I only stare

I love you, need you now Tracy Cruz
And the devil inside you

From the place where they say "Deep down I bet she's really sad"
Though the look on her face is more fun than you've ever had

I love you, need you now Tracy Cruz
And the devil inside you

She starts twisting making sounds
She starts turning all around
She looks happy as can be
She's with him and I'm with ... me

So I fall to my knees and God in such an awful place
And say why in the hell d'you give her such a perfect face

I love you, need you now Tracy Cruz
And the devil inside you

So come on and let it loose
I've a rope and you've a noose
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord what's left to take
Cause I could not get more from this
If I gave her just a kiss
I know it's wrong when I do it
I'm better to have been through it
Could not get more from this
Could not get more from this
You better bury me deep
