[Verse 1]
Light me a candle, Im coming home
Then leave it by your side where I belong
Ive been in this cold world for so long
So Light me a candle, Im coming home

[Chorus]
I want to feel the love thats in the hearts
Of all the ones that make us who we are
Thankful for the ones we have and what we have to give
In this heart set loves
Thats where my Christmas lives

[Verse 2]
Snow on the window, asleep by the fire
Somehow these children never get tired
Missing the ones that, we wish were here
Remembering the ones who look on but we dont shed a tear

[Chorus]
I want to feel the love thats in the hearts
Of all the ones that make us who we are
Thankful for the ones we have and what we have to give
In this heart set loves
Thats where my Christmas lives
In these heart set loves
Thats where my Christmas lives

[Verse 3]
All along the halls are ringing
Choirs singing Christmastime is gone
In trees the lights are streaming
Children gleaming Christmastime is gone
Oh we still knowing Christmas time is gone
Oh we still knowing

[Outro]
I wanna feel the love that's in the hearts
Of all the ones that make us who we are
Thankful for the ones we have and what we have to give
In this heart set loves
That's where my Christmas lives [x3]
