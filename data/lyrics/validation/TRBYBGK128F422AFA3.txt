I see telepresence
Placeless space
Birdcage on a loop, Baby
Total waste

I feel greed infection
Tears of steam
It's the Jesus Channel, Baby
Make the metal scream
Make the metal scream
Make the metal scream

I see blowdown damage
Static kill
Mean square displacement, Baby
Just for a thrill
I got no protection
No regime
Come electrocute me, Baby
Make the metal scream
Make the metal scream
Make the metal scream

I've seen his face so many times
I know him blind
Not enough action
Not enough satisfaction
By the time I trace this shakedown
I'll be redefined
No piracy
No privacy

I got all the angles
Impicture force
In deformation, Baby
Without remorse

I got no reflection to redeem
Come and lacerate me, Baby
Make the metal scream
Make the metal scream
Make the metal scream
