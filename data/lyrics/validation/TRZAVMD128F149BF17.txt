I still remember the day that we met
Your smile is something I'll never forget
And since that day my love grows and grows
And that's the way it goes

The way it goes...

I spent a lifetime just waiting for you
But from now on dear my searching is through
For you have made all my dreams come true
And that's the way it goes

From out of nowhere you came into view
Now I'm completely in love with you
You walked right in, my heart walked out
You took its place without doubt

Oh won't you please open your heart to me
For since I've known you, you're all that I see
You are the one love that my heart has chosen
That's the way it goes -
It goes ---
