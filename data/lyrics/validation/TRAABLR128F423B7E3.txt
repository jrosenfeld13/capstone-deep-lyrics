Lead Vocal by Greg

Well, these late night conversations
Leave a strange taste
Like french cigarettes
And these coloured drinks
That you keep on throwin' at me
Just keep on reminding me
I came to forget

So now every night
You insist on reminding me
Of my lost possibilities
And the stains on the wall
Well, I don't mean to complain
But it hurts just the same
And now both of us know
The leaves will fall on their own

Just throw me a line
That's all that I ask
Well, it's sink or swim and I'm goin' fast
I need love and it's you
And I feel like William Holden floating in a pool

Yea, you tell me
Life is for living
It's best in the giving
But it's so hard to be free
Still I do my best
But you refuse my gift
And now all that we share
Is a collection of tears

Just throw me a line
That's all that I ask
Well, it's sink or swim and I'm going fast
I need love and it's you
And I feel like William Holden floating in a pool
