I got a bone to pick with you
About our relationship or our lack there of

Don't forget to say you're sorry
You didn't mean it, You did it anyways
This time there's
No forgiveness from this trespass

Words your ammunition
You're armed to the teeth
Your words an arsenal
So point them at my heart

I am intrigued by your audacity
I can't fathom why you would
Think that I would give in so easily
I want things to be different

Scream yourself awake
Take your own life for
Those you've betrayed
