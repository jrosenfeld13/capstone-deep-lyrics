I met your girlfriend, shes very nice
How could you do this, you didnt think twice
I didnt think youd be so naughty
To get yourself fucked at the office party


But after pint, six, seven, eight, nine (six, seven, eight, nine)
You nip to the loo for a sneaky line (a sneaky line)
Then its okay as long as nobody sees (anybody, anybody)
The lucky lady on her knees


So keep your hands to yourself
Wed rather die lonely on the shelf
And take yourself back out that door
Youre making my flesh creep you bore


And when youre zipping up your flies (zipping up, zipping up, zipping up)
Fabricate your next set of lies (your next set of lies)
Cos what if someone told your daughter (your little baby girl)
Shes got a fuckwit for a father


So keep your hands to yourself
Wed rather die lonely on the shelf
And take yourself back out that door
Youre making my flesh creep you bore


And after all times moving on (ding dong, ding dong)
And Desmond Morris cant be wrong (he surely cant be wrong)
What can you do its in your genes? (its in your genes)
So why dont you keep it there and dream (dream, dream, dream, dream)


So keep your hands to yourself
Wed rather die lonely on the shelf
And take yourself back out that door
Youre making my flesh creep you bore


So keep your hands to yourself
Wed rather die lonely on the shelf
And take yourself back out that door
Youre making my flesh creep you bore


So keep your hands to yourself
Wed rather die lonely on the shelf
And take yourself back out that door
Youre making my flesh creep you bore
