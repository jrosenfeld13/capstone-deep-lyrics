Ah
Oh well, the music is coming to an end
I fell for you and the love pretend
You know, I smelled the truth
But denied my instinct
I left the city, my family, my precinct

And now I'm looking
At liberty, good belief
Revolution, new obsession
Ideas, like new years
And good things
I've grown wings
With hope and dope and charity

I ain't being disarmed like this
I don't seek your foolish kiss
This is feeling victory
And I won't tell you what I see
No more, no more

Don't think it- i'll feel this time
You've got to trust in someone
Drop your guard and make love
Don't play your cards to your heart now
Don't play your cards to your heart now

Stop, yell, make a noise!-that's for all of us
Don't think revenge is a path to happiness
For the real link to enlightenment is forgiveness
For under the sun we are better and warmer together

I ain't being disarmed like this
I don't seek your foolish kiss
This is feeling victory
And I won't tell you what I see
No more, no more

Hey!
Don't think it- I'll feel this time
You've got to trust in someone
Drop your guard and make love
Don't play your cards to your heart now
Don't play your cards to your heart now

Let the sun ray in
Let the oceans wave
Let the trees rise up
Let all my love come play
Drive away

I'll be a bystander
That innocent man (That enters the mind?)
Out of a nightmare
Back into my heart

All of the reds
Drop your guard and make love, love

Revolution, new obsession
Ideas, new years
Good things
I've grown wings
Hope, dope, charity

Don't play your cards to your heart now
