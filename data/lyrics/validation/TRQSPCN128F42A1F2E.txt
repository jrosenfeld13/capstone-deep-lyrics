[Instrument break]
[Verse 1]
I was a PFC on a search patrol huntin' Charlie down
It was in the jungle wars of '65
My weapon jammed and I got stuck way out and all alone
And I could hear the enemy movin' in close outside
Just then I heard a twig snap and I grabbed my empty gun
And I dug in scared while I counted down my fate
And then a big marine, a giant with a pair of friendly eyes
Appeared there at my shoulder and said wait
When he came in close beside me he said
"Don't worry, son, I'm here
If Charlie wants to tangle now he'll have two to dodge."
I said, "Well thanks a lot."
I told him my name and asked him his
And he said, "The boys just call me Camouflage."
[Chorus]
Whoa Camouflage
Things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa Camoufalge
I was awfully glad to see this big marine
[Verse 2]
Well I was gonna ask him where he came from
When we heard the bullets fly
Coming through the brush
And all around our ears
It was then I saw this big Marine light a fire in his eye
And it was strange but suddenly I forgot my fears
[Verse 3]
Well, we fought all night side by side we took our battle stance
And I wondered how the bullets missed this man
Cause they seemed to go right through him
As if he wasn't there
And in the mornin' we both took a chance and ran
[Verse 4]
And it was near the river bank when the ambush came on top of us
And I'd thought it was the end and we were had
Then a bullet with my name on it came buzzin' through a bush
And that big marine he just swatted it with his hand
Just like it was a fly
[Chorus]
Whoa Camouflage
Things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa Camouflage
This was an awfully strange Marine
[Verse 5]
And I knew there was something weird about him
Cause when I turned around he was pullin' a big palm tree
Right up out of the ground
And swattin' those Charlies with it from here to Kingdom Come
When he led me out of danger
I saw my camp and waved goodbye
He just winked at me from the jungle and then was gone
And when I got back to my HQ, I told 'em about my night
And the battle I'd spent with a big marine named Camouflage
[Verse 6]
When I said his name a soldier gulped
And a medic took my arm
And led me to a green tent on the right
He said, "You may be tellin' the truth boy
But this here is Camouflage
And he's been right here since he passed away last night."
In fact, he's been here all week long
But before he went he said, "Semper Fi,"
And said his only wish
Was to save a young marine caught in a barrage
So here, take his dog tag, son
I know he'd want you to have it now."
And we both said a prayer for a big marine named Camouflage
[Chorus]
Whoa Camouflage
Things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa Camouflage
This was an awfully big marine
[Verse 7]
So next time you're in a jungle fight
And you feel the presence near
Or hear a voice that in your mind will lie
Just be thankful that you're not alone
And you got some company
From a big Marine the boys called Camouflage
[Chorus]
Whoa Camouflage
Things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa Camouflage
This was an awfully big Marine
[Chorus]
Whoa Camouflage
Things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa Camouflage
This was an awfully big Marine
