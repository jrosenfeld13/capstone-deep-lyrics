The Day the Rains Came Down
Jayne Morgan
The day that the rains came down
Mother Earth smiled again
Now the lilacs could bloom
Now the fields could grow greener
The fday that the rains came down
Buds were born, love was born
As the young buds will grow
So our young love will grow
Love, sweet love
A robin sang a song of love
A willow tree reached up to the heavens
Asif to thank the sky above
For all that rain, that welcome rain
We looked across the meadowland
And seemed to sense a kind of a miracle
Much too deep to understand
And there we were, so much in love
The day that the rains came down
Mountain streams swelled with pride
Gone the dry river bed
Gone the dust from the valley
The day that the rains came down
Buds were born, love was born
As the young buds will grow
So our young love will grow
Love, sweet love
Rain sweet rain
