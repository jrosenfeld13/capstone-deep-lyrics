I gotta get me a grip and be strong
Gotta show I can rip, moving on
As I trembling, Its not ending
Gotta avoid to make slips and meet nongs

Cause I want it, yeah I wanna live my life
I wanna live my life in this world
And I need it, yes I need it
Yeah, I need to spend my days on this earth

I gotta learn to say NO, disallow
Well, its my turn to go pro, right about now
Ive been fading for too long, degrading
I gotta earn me some dough, this is how

Cause I want it, yeah I wanna live my life
I wanna live my life in this world
And I need it, yes I need it
Yeah, I need to spend my days on this earth

At 23, I was far from feeling free
At 24, my life was a big bore
Now Im 25 and Im still not high
Yeah, Im 25 but still alive
Ill never give up until I reach my goal, until I reach my goal...
Controlling body and soul

Yeah I want it, yeah I wanna live my life
I wanna live my life in this world
And I need it, yes I need it
Yeah, I need to spend my days on this earth
