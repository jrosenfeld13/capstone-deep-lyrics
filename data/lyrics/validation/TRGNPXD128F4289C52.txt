I've been travelling all over this world, yeah
I've seen so many beautiful girls

Let me sing
I've been travelling all over this world
And never have I seen so many beautiful girls
That were precious like diamonds emeralds and pearls
With names like ?, Suzanne and Cheryl

I'm in a state of shock
I've seen the cream of the crop
I'm in a state of shock
Oh lord
I'm in a state of shock
I feel like i'm up on top
Whoa lord

There are too many women in this world to be fighting over one
If you don't believe me what i'm telling just take a trip to Washington
There are too many women in this world to be fighting over two
If you don't believe me just take a trip to Arbeque

Girls like sure like the sun ?
Still get relief from marijuana some
Ziggy ziggy

I've seen girls from miles around
Some of them black some white some brown
From uptown, downtown and all around
And all i got to say it was so profound

I'm in a state of shock
I feel like i'm up on top
Whoa lord
I'm in a state of shock
I feel like i'm up on top
Whoa lord

Zoom de-la humm dem whoa
So many girls in comparison than boys
Zoom de-la humm dem whoa
So many girls in comparison than boys

There's like girls like Sam that match every man
Words like Her to get your money's worth

Girls like rice and all of them nice
No-nnno!
Whoa lord

I'm in a state of shock
I can't believe i'm up on top
I'm in a state of shock
I can't believe i'm up on top
Whoa lord

Just when i thought i've seen them all
I end up seein' more than ever before
Near and far, down with yall, at the rave at the mall
Summer winter spring and fall
And all i got to say is i had a ball
And its lovelyness
I say again its lovelyness

I'm in a state of shock
I feel like i'm up on top
Whoa lord
I'm in a state of shock
I feel like i'm up on top
Whoa lord
Still in a state of shock

Whoa-whoooa!
