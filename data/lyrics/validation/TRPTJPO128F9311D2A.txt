There is no shuffle
There is no shuffle here
Here on the North Pole
On this quiet dome
Sunshine on crystal
And milky walls of ice
All seem so fragile
Under the polar sky
Cold in the head
But warm in the heart
You could find pleasure
You could find displeasure
There is no sound here
But the rumbling waves
Of the polar sea

I know this anger burning inside of you
And I'm afraid I can feel it too
I know this anger burning inside of you
There is an ice-floe between you and me

This is the place
This is the only place
Cold in the head
Warm in the heart
There is no shuffle
There is no shuffle here
Here on the North Pole
On this quiet dome
Remember what they said
You've got to go ahead
Always ahead...
