We drive to keep our conscience clear
Imagine closure sinking deep into the air
Our loss is not gaining new ground at all
I fight this everyday
Against this ever-changing face
I fight you everyday
Against your ever-changing face
With a fresh sense of purpose and direction
We cannot hide now from ourselves
In disguises all our own
Still we can't escape at all
We run from things that can be seen
But if we would close our eyes
We would see the real threat against us
I won't run from this world
Only our faces hide
The quiet defeat inside
Only our faces show
Reflections of so much more
