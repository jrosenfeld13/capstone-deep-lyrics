I need more than religious affection
I need more than your pious perfection
I need you to know the one you give away
To every pretty stranger who should pass your way!

Oh when will you give me your street corner love? Yeah!
When will you give me your street corner love?

You take good care of my spiritualities
You keep a book on my socialities
You say you know just the food my body needs
To keep it strong and healthy, now I'm full of seeds!

When will you give me your street corner love? [x2]

Think I'll make it back to Selma Avenue
I won't be proud* but I won't go hungry
I won't have shelter but I won't get cold
I won't have you but I won't grow old...gracefully

So give me more than your gay personality
Sometimes your smile is a frowning reality
Give me light, love me like we never met
Love me like tomorrow finds us searching yet

Oh when will you give me your street corner love? Yeah!
When will you give me your street corner love? Yeah! [x2]
