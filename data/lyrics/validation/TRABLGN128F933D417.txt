When you believe like I believe
You can turn your life around and live your dream
What makes you strong
What drives you on
You know you're not alone
When you believe

Here's to the girl I left behind
The one who thought the world
Would always pass her by
She looks at me now
With wonder in her eyes
She knows how far I've come
How hard I've tried

When you believe like I believe
You can turn your life around and live your dream
What makes you strong
What drives you on
You know you're not alone
When you believe

Here's to the woman I have become
The one who wants to thank you
For all you've done
You lift me high
You gave me wings to fly
And all I wanna say
Is you take my breath away

Look at me now
With wonder I can't hide
I know how far I've come
How hard I've tried
The way I feel inside

When you believe like I believe
You can turn your life around and live your dream
What makes you strong
What drives you on
You know you're not alone
When you believe

When you believe like I believe
You can turn your life around and live your dream
What makes you strong
What drives you on
You know you're not alone
When you believe

You know you're not alone
When you believe
