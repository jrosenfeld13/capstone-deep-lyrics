Moonlight shinin' through the trees

An iridescent glow
Moonlight shinin' through the trees

An iridescent glow

Call it your destiny, but

Nobody really knows

Its a slight variation

On the story of how things start

Roses and clover start growing

And they wrap around your heart

Well theres no use pretending

That its just gonna go away

Roses and clover start growing

And they wrap around your brain

Going down, down, down, down, down

Where the roses and clover grow

Going down, down, down, down, down

Where the roses and clover grow

Heart beats a nervous tension

Just like in their dreams

But all this feels way too real

To be just what it seems

And the air is getting heavy

And her smile makes him crazed

And he fears that hell just disappear

And slide into this haze

Going down, down, down, down, down )

Where the roses and clover grow )

Shes waiting in the garden, dont you know)2x

Down, down, down, down, down )

Where the roses and clover grow )

Going down, down, down, down, down

Down, down, down, down, down

(Shes waiting in the garden, dont you know......)

Down, down, down, down, down

Where the roses and clover grow

Shes waiting in the garden, dont you know

Just waiting in the garden, dont you know

Waiting in the garden, dont you know
