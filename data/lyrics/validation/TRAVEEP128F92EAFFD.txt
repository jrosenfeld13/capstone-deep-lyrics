Line 'em up, go, that's what she said
When the lightning struck
I couldn't see the difference;
Time to let go of Russian roulette
God's the only one who knows how we are not dead!
Out the window, but don't waste it
'Cause falling on the floor is overrated
Over the rainbow, I'm bleeding
What I wanted isn't always what I needed!

But you're whispering so loud
With words that never die...

I remember everything you said to me
The words you spoke, they burn
Burn within my heart, (whoa! whoa!)
Burn within my soul
I remember everything you said to me
The words you spoke they burn
Burn within my heart, (whoa! whoa!)
Burn within my soul
And I will carry them with me forever..

A night of looking down a musket
Somehow I always end up on this magic carpet;
Hit the tango, wherever wind blows
It always takes me further than I wanted to go!
After the sideshow, an invitation
Outside the city limits leaving condemnation
Ears are ringing with little whispers
After everything that's all I can remember!

But you're whispering so loud
With words that never die!

I remember everything you said to me
The words you spoke, they burn
Burn within my heart, (whoa! whoa!)
Burn within my soul
I remember everything you said to me
The words you spoke they burn
Burn within my heart, (whoa! whoa!)
Burn within my soul
And I will carry them with me forever..

I hear what you whisper!
I'll always remember!!

(sweet solo)

I remember everything you said to me
The words you spoke, they burn
Burn within my heart, (whoa! whoa!)
Burn within my soul
I remember everything you said to me
The words you spoke they burn
Burn within my heart, (whoa! whoa!)
Burn within my soul
And I will carry them with me forever..

Go!
