Did you come up to me
So your night would be cheaper
Did you make up your mind
About me from the start

Did you come here tonight
To find something deeper
Or did you just follow me home
'Cause you're afraid of the dark

Did you...
Did you really think you found somebody
Or did the vodka make you leave with me
Ain't it funny how you wake up runnin'
When it felt so right... last night

You can give her the world
And the eight hours later
You can't even put a face to her name
If you don't even know her
How can you hate her
You just stick to the rules
And there's no one to blame

Did you...
Did you really think you found somebody
Or did the vodka make you leave with me
Ain't it funny how you wake up runnin'
When it felt so right... last night

I promised you a part in my unwritten script
And I told you stuff like I've been waiting for you
All my life
You bragged about your hits on Myspace
And how your future looked so bright... last night

Did you...
Did you really think you found somebody
Or did the vodka make you leave with me
Ain't it funny how you wake up runnin'
When it felt so right... last night
