[Verse 1]
Are teenage dreams so hard to beat
Everytime she walks down the street
Another girl in the neighborhood
Wish she was mine, she looks so good

[Chorus]
I wanna hold her wanna hold her tight
Get teenage kicks right through the night

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna call her on the telephone
Have her over 'cos I'm all alone
I need excitement oh i need it bad
And it's the best, I've ever had

[Chorus]
I wanna hold her wanna hold her tight
Get teenage kicks right through the night

[Chorus]
I wanna hold her wanna hold her tight
Get teenage kicks right through the night

[Chorus]
I wanna hold her wanna hold her tight
Get teenage kicks right through the night
