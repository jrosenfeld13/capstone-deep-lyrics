When the sun in the morning
Peeps over the hill
And kisses the roses 'round my window sill

Then my heart fills with gladness
When I hear the trill
Of the birds in the treetops on Mockingbird Hill

Tra la la, twiddle-dee dee-dee

It gives me a thrill
To wake up in the morning
To the mockingbird's trill

Tra la la, twiddle-dee dee-dee
There's peace and goodwill
You're welcome as the flowers on the mockingbird hill

Got a three-cornered plow
And an acre to till
And a mule that I bought for a ten-dollar bill

There's a tumble-down shack
And a rusty old mill
But it's my home sweet home up on Mockingbird Hill

Tra la la, tweedle dee dee dee
Tra la la, twiddle-dee dee-dee

It gives me a thrill
To wake up in the morning
To the mockingbird's trill

Tra la la, twiddle-dee dee-dee
There's peace and goodwill
You're welcome as the flowers on the mockingbird hill

When it's late in the evening
I climb up the hill
And survey all my kingdom while everything's still

Only me and the sky
And an old whippoorwill
Singing songs in the twilight on Mockingbird Hill

Tra la la, twiddle-dee dee-dee

It gives me a thrill
To wake up in the morning
To the mockingbird's trill

Tra la la, twiddle-dee dee-dee
There's peace and goodwill
You're welcome as the flowers on the mockingbird hill
