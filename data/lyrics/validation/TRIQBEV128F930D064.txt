Those forgiving lips have been good to me
And if I start to slip and lead you on
I will leave

I'll be lost here with you
If I stay around
I'll be lost here with you

The stillness in her cheeks
Gave me hopeless dreams
And all the joy I knew
Was swept away, swept away

I'll be lost here with you
If I stay around
I'll be lost here with you
I'll be lost here with you
If I stay around
I'll be lost here with you

Close enough to feel
All the good you give
But Ii want something new

I'll be lost with you
You're not safe with me
My mistake is not murder
I'll be lost with you
You're not safe with me
My mistake is not murder
