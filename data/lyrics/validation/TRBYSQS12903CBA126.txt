Make me a deal and make it good for me
I won't get full of myself, coz I can't afford to be
This is small town music, this is big town music
He's ahead of his time you know but, he can't use it
If only he could prove it

Tomorrows just a song away, a song away, a song away
Tomorrows just a song away, a song away, a song away
Its just a song away

Hey

See what your man has done to the world
See what the world has done to your man
You know I'm leaving you, you don't need me
Loving you wasn't always so easy

This is believe me music, this is forget me music
This is who can love me you know, this ain't no roxy music
This is new form music, this is old form music
This is i paid attention not some makes his prediction music
Oh he could let me use it

Tomorrows just a song away, a song away, a song away
Tomorrows just a song away, a song away, a song away
Its just a song away

Not wanting to write a truthful song over an eighties groove
I like to let you know I'll always be straight with you
I stole my personality from an anonymous source
And I'm gonna pay for it too, I don't feel bad about that
Give me my chance back

This is on the rise music, this I novelty music
This is who can blame music, I don't get fooled by it
This is where'd you go music, this is come home music
This is down to the wire I'm such a perfect angel music
Who really tries

Tomorrows just a song away, a song away, a song away
Tomorrows just a song away, a song away, a song away
Its just a song away

This is success music and whats it to ya?
My lawyer always says these are the fact about the future well

Tomorrows just a song away, a song away, a song away
Tomorrows just a song away, a song away, a song away

Tomorrows just a song away, a song away, a song away
Its just a song away
