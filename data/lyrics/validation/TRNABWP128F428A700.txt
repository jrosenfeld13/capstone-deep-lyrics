Got to get something done today
Give accomplishment a shot
Might not have a full palette to use
But I'm gonna paint with the colors I've got

There're your hopes and ideals you embrace
Then there's what's staring you in the face
Sorrowful times are here but they won't last
'Cause this too shall pass

Feeling like a lazy tub o' lard
Rajneesh Jr. gave me his business card
Think I'll take the personality test
To document my fine mess this far

There're your hopes and dreams you embrace
Then there's what's staring you in the face
First place man will one day roll in last
'Cause this too shall pass

Better get on out to the starting line
They're coming soon
They're gonna fix it in time
I just want to get what's mine
Not a fortune gonna just, gonna just, love life
And this too shall pass

Do what you got to do to find a cure
For the things that make you feel so impure
Just how I don't know for sure
Sometimes misery has a strange allure

There're your hopes and ideals you embrace
Then there's what's staring you in the face
Sorrowful times are here but they won't last
'Cause this too shall pass

There are your hopes and dreams you embrace
Then there's what's staring you in the face
Sorrowful times are here but they won't last
'Cause this too shall pass
