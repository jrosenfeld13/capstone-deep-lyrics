[Verse 1]
Stop loving me a little at a time, let me lose you a little at a time
Walk away slow like you don't want to go, leave me a little at a time

[Chorus]
For my benefit try to cry a little bit
For old times sake give me a slow heartbreak
I put up a fight but I'll be all right if you stop loving me a little at a time

[Verse 2]
Hurt me a little at a time, turn me away a little at a time
Walk away slow like you don't want to go, leave me, a little at a time

[Chorus]
