When I'm feeling down and out and life's become a real bad joke
I remember why you left to make a brand new start
The timing always was the worst and consideration my strong suit
After all this said and done now, who will be the wiser?

Never wanted you around but you where always there in spite
Never know which one of us, who was wrong and who was right?

Knowing this I guess I'm glad that you were not around
But it sure would be nice just to hold you one more night
This time I feel I have to call you just to find out how you are
But I know just what will happen cause the hate is still alive

Never wanted me around but I was always there in spite
Never know which one of us, who was wrong and who was right?

Yesterday I got your message, the phone was ringing off the hook
You come to say that you were sorry, "could we make a brand new start?"
When I heard your voice
I broke down and began to laugh
Live and learn, you always told me my life to live and yours to learn

Never wanted us around but we where always there in spite
Never know which one of us, who was wrong and who was right?

When you're feeling down and out and life's become a real bad joke
Just remember why you left to make a brand new start
The timing always was the worst and consideration your strong suit
After all this said and done now, who will be the wiser?
