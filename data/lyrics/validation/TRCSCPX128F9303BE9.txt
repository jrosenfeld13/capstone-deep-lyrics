You knock on her door
She don't recognise your voice no more
So she got on an aeroplane
Na na na na na so long after
Strip down from the fever
Laid down in a hotel bed
Wouldn't take no phone calls at all
Didn't want no more voices in her head

And that's the way that you feel
And that's the way that you feel
And that's the way that you feel honey know
That's the way that you feel

In the blue part of the evening
Sometimes its hard
She thinks she hears you coming
But she's stuck against the wall
Oh she wants what she wants
So she do what she do
But now she looks at you
She covers one eye 'cause she can see into your mind
She no longer want to

And that's the way that you feel
And that's the way that you feel
And that's the way that you feel honey know
That's the way that you feel
