Some say that life's like an apple
I prefer to think of it as pie

I knew a boy who took a bite out of life
He took a bite out of life

He took a big ol' juicy bite out of life

He took a bite out of life

I knew a boy who took a bite out of life
He took a big ol' juicy bite out of life

I have known a thing or two about
Love and lust and fly fishing for trout
If you feel your days are getting dim
Grab hold of life and sink your teeth right in
