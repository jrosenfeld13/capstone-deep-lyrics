From the albums TAKIN' IT EASY (1978) and THE SEALS & CROFTS COLLECTION (1979)

Well love, you came to my rescue. I knew the moment I met you
Lonely and I was cryin'. Hurtin', I felt like dyin'

Oooo. You're the love, you're the love in my heart and soul
You're the dream, you're the dream, you're the dream in my life
You're the way, you're the way, you're the way that my feelings flow
Oh, my love loves you, girl. You, ah ah. You, girl, girl. You

Showed me that I was someone. Gave me the strength to go on
Now that I'm flyin' and free. Thank you for what you gave me

Oooo. You're the love, you're the love in my heart and soul
You're the dream, you're the dream, you're the dream in my life
You're the way, you're the way, you're the way that my feelings flow
Oh, my love loves you, girl. You, ah ah. You, girl, girl. You
