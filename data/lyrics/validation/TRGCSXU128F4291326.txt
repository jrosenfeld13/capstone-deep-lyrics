So many years I've been fading
And closed the doors behind
Pay that price if you lost it all
The end is not the past recall

Bridge:
Waiting for the enclosening darkness
And there you will be the light
As it's carved in your soul
Step out from your mould

Chorus:
The captured mind is a captured state
But only free will has it's sustain
You burn away all you once loved
Now it's time to turn away

It's all too clear you've been hiding
Nothing to tell but lies
Feel shame when you distain it all
Your stand is not the past recall

(bridge)

(chorus x2)
