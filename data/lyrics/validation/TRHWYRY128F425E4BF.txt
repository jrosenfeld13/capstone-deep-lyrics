Clink, clink, clatter, rattle
The penny dropped
Iconized, though slightly slouched he
Raised both his arms
Raised his head

Outside the cabinet there stood a little girl
Goggle-eyed and quite atounded
Gazed at the wizard
Gazed at the crystal-ball

Dear Mr. Sage, what do you see?
Is it my dream? - It was here with me
Now it is lost
Where can it be?
