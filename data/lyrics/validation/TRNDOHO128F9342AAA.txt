My enemies lurk in the corner of my eye
Falling apart
Staring back from the dark shadows in my mind
Faling apart
My trust is like a crumbling statue
Falling apart
I try to hide but find no refuge
Faling apart
They seem so threatening
They all seem so threatening
They're all coming after me
The enemy's after me - that's a problem
From what i see the land of the free is ready
To arm me to the teeth - that's a problem
We're free to cheat, free to steal
Free to wreck each other at will
They shock my chill, shock my senses
Never let down my defenses
Kundalini's in a mess
And i'm shattering from stress
They victimize, traumatize
And i'm as vulnerable as a child
All the sounds i hear at night
Is my alarm going off
Are my windows shut and locked
As i fumble trough my keys
You see me falling apart at the seams
Falling apart
The enemy's after me
