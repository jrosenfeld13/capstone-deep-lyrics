[Verse 1]
Fell on my feet this morning
Two angels heard me cry
This is your fate hereafter

The future is my friend
It hurts, but it treats me well
Take hold and be its master

[Pre-Hook 1]
Gold as the sun
As you turn me on
And bathe in its sun red
I'm alive, older and strong

Let me be someone
I'll take hold and be its master

[Pre-Hook 2]
Gold as the sun
As you turn me on
With echoes of laughter
As I cry out loud

[Hook 1]
Got my feet on the ground
Your hands found me
Saw my blood on the ground
And it changed my life

[Bridge]
So many parts that I have to play
A tangle with life set me up that way
Now I know these are the words that I have to say
Won't you let me
Won't you hear me cry

[Hook 1]

[Hook 2]
Your face in the crowd
You're my future
Saw my blood on the ground
And it changed my life

[Hook 3]
Got my feet on the ground
Your hands found me
Blood on the cross
And it changed my life

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Fell on my feet this morning
