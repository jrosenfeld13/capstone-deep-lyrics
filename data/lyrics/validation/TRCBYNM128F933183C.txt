I swore, I' never be one of those
Numb, vindictive, chained to a ghost
Chant a worn out Mantra
Today's the day, I let go
Some bricks keep comin back
No matter where you throw em...

I stare up into the sky
Pray for little light chase away the night...

Hey Star, how about little light to show me where you are
Hey Star, a little mercy here would go pretty far
Hey Star, is this the year, the year of letting go
Hey Star

Losing's a part of living
Something we all go through
At least that's what you tell yourself
When it's happening to you

I Read in some book
It takes about year to let go
Yet some of us keep hangin' on
To our unbreakable ropes

I stare up into the sky
Pray for little light to take away night...

Hey Star, how about little light to show me where you are
Hey Star, how bout a little light to illuminate these scars
Hey Star, This is my year...
