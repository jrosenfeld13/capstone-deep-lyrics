Trapped inside the cage
All that you'll see you'll soon forget
These bitter words of pain and rage yours to keep as you come of age
Every second passing in our lives
Seals the door a little tighter
Walls that keep us trapped inside are barriers within our own minds
Locked down hard for none to see
Prisoners of our own misery
Try to be yourself and see what you get
Don't try to question or step out of line
You might think something you'll live to regret
Unthinkable thoughts, they'll haunt you
You'll never forget
Trapped inside the cage
All that you see you soon forget
And so we let the cycle flow
Thinking there's nothing to know
Wandering, wakeful time ticks fast
See your future become your past
Strung out on fear of what becomes of a mind on fire with a severed tongue
Days spent questioning life's worth
Turned the gift of life back into a curse
So let crows peck at my heart
May they erase the memory of today
You'll never forget
All that you see, you'll soon forget
The cage
All that you see soon forget
And so we let the cycle flow
Thinking there's nothing more to know
