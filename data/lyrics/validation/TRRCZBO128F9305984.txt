I keep your picture by my bed for when I'm feeling sad
And I don't know why I would be
The way your smile looks so real
I feel like I could start to understand your grace
And I don't understand why you're
Not here with me
And I don't even wanna know where else
You'd be

'Cause I have photographs and memories of the times
When you weren't on my mind and I was alone
And I have poetry and drawings of my life
When you weren't on my side and I didn't know
Just what is love...?

Writing moments on the wall with different colors
Keeps my mind away from missing you
And I can't wait to fall asleep to slip into my dreams
Where we can dance upon a star..
And I will be as patient as a boy in love could ever be
'Cause I don't feel like I was real until you were
A part of me

I need you back, I need you back
I need you here
I need your smile, I need your eyes
I need you dear
'Cause every line on your face makes a beautiful maze
For my eyes to trace
