I was traveling to the moon and stars
Till I crossed my heart
And I found it damaged to dust
I was living in a house of cards
Built to fall apart
But found the way straight to Your love

(chorus)
When my darkest skies have turned black
Stumbling and praying, I find my way back
You're burning like the sun
When everything in my life has turned blue
I know I believe I'm relying on You
You're the one, you're the one
One and only love

When I'm struggling through my life each day
One true thing remains...
I'm a fool to depend on me
So I'm turning in my life today
And I know I've changed
Cause I found the way
Straight to your love

(chorus)

(bridge)
Lord, You are, yes You are
My one and only love
You lift my world
You lift my world, my world
And raise it to heaven up above, so high
Lord, You are, my one and only love
My one and only love
I'm not the same, I'm not the same
You are my one and only love

(chorus)
When my darkest skies have turned black
Stumbling and praying, I find my way back
When everything in my life has turned blue
I know I believe I'm relying on you (repeat)
You're the one, you're the one
One and only...
