This country's ageing you
It's locked into it's own styles
It's always apparent
It's own self revealed

Whatever eye is trained upon it
Your face is the future
As smooth a transaction as hoped for
The hollows beneath the skin

An uneasiness with feeling
It's a clear drive
Add to where our thoughts could
Er.. oh, be revealed

Skip to these canyons
Sweet eclipse and dresses
The way your kisses
Ruffles more than surface tensions and a thought

The drive, the cures worked
From the hollowed structure of this new country
Your migr face fit deeper into blue collars
How bulls held apparent again

A sense of all time know how
What to do?
What to do?

Well you can bury it deeper
Than it's easy to find
And you you make it ring hollow
