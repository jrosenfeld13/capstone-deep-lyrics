Well I'm finally gettin' used to the water the way the tarantulas bite
Those Federales didn't believe I only came here to watch the bulls fight
Tell my mother I need a good lawyer tell my father I'm getting a tan
My sleepy siesta down south of the border is taking more time than I planned
Oh Juanity somebody betrayed me they've given me ten years to life
Juanita I need you to save me I promise I'll make you my wife

I got a big house in Milwaukee with a color TV and a pool
A Naugahyde bar and a Cadillac car Juanita they're waiting for you
Tie the burro up down in the courtyard to keep the guard busy tonight
When you bring my dinner make sure the tortilla is filled with a gun or a knife
Juanity somebody betrayed me...

Juanita you'll love Wisconsin Wisconsin is gonna love you
Yes all of Milwaukee speaks Spanish
Of course you're gonna wear American shoes
Lake Michigan tastes like tequila frijoles why they grow there on trees
You can say adios to the pigs and the goats if you'll just do this one thing for me
But Juanity somebody betrayed me...

Juanita I swear it was all a mistake
You see I was drowning out there in the ocean and I saw this bale coming by
Man so I grabbed it and I climbed up on top of it
And I found this stick and I rowed myself into shore
And when I got there the Border Patrol was waiting for me
At the I didn't know what it was
I promise you if you'll just marry me so I can become a citizen of Mexico
I'll take you to Milwaukee you can meet all my friends
They got these big shiny motorcycles
And you can ride on the back of 'em with 'em really Juanita would I lie to you
