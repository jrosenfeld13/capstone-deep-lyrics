This is your Gift
John Tesh's Christmas Worship album

"If a star can be a sign that the light is breaking thru
And the child in your arms makes the whole world seem brand new
We can embrace all the grace we've been given
Stand in the light of the wonder we live in

This is your gift, this brand new day
So take it to heart, take it on faith
Open your eyes, don't be afraid to learn how to live
This is your gift. This brand new day. This is your gift

When it's hard to say a prayer, when you're overcome by fear
And you see each day through a thousand fallen tears
Hope takes your hand and it picks up the pieces
Love comes to life as we live and believe it

This is our new beginning. This is where we start
We'll take what God has given and we'll live it from the heart

This is your gift, this brand new day
So take it to heart, take it on faith
Open your eyes, don't be afraid to learn how to live
This is your gift. This brand new day. This is your gift."
