[Barrington Levy (Bounty Killer):]
Oooh woman I heard a little rumor last night
(Little rumor last night, rumor last night)
Somebody told me you weren't doing me right
(She wasn't doin' me right, doin' me right)
While I've been turning my back
You've been out playing the field
(She jus playing the field, playing the field)
Can you look me in the eyes and say to me it's not real
(Girl that could not be real, couldn't be real)
That's all I wanted to know (Just wanna know, girl)
That look is giving you away (Give it away, give it away now - She was a {better} Gal)
An I'll never believe in a single word you say (I'll never believe yuh girl)

And the pretty stars
Thinking me out like I am in Mars

[Barrington Levy (Bounty Killer):]
