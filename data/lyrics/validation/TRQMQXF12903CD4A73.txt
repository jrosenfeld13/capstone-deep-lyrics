Well I went to a turkey roast down the street
The people down there eat like wild geese;

I'm on my way, I'm goin' back to Alabam'

Talk about yer people have a whale of a time
Eatin' up chicken' and drinkin' their wine;

I'm on my way, I'm goin' back to Alabam'

Now some folks say a tramp won't steal
But I caught three in my corn field;

I'm on my way, I'm goin' back to Alabam'

One had a bushel and the other had a peck
One had a roast'n' ear tied round his neck;

I'm on my way, I'm goin back to Alabam'

There comes Sal walkin' down the street
With run down shoes tied to her feet;
Good Mornin', honey, stand over there, baby
Get over there, now
Hello Sal, I know you
With a run down slipper and a tore up shoe;

I'm on my way, I'm goin' back to Alabam'

When I get ready to leave this earth
I'm gonna look on my money's worth;

I'm on my way, I'm goin' back to Alabam'

I'm goin back to Alabam'!
