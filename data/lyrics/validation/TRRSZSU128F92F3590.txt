Hey, dad gum your hide boy
Dad gum your dirty hide
Dad gum you dirty dog, I gave you a pig
And you wanted a hog

I took you in when you were beat
You were almost dead
I gave you some good food to eat
And a place to rest your head
I even let you wear my brand new suit
Let you wear my new shoes
And when you asked me for money
I never did refuse
Look at him laughing

Dad gum your hide boy
Dad gum your dirty hide
Dad gum you dirty dog, I gave you a pig
And you wanted a hog

Yeah, then you met my baby
Who is the apple of my heart
Well I could tell from the way you looked at her
That trouble was bound to start
'coz you started in with all your jivin'
You made her think the moon was green
Well you know Daddy I think
You are the mose convincingest fellah I have ever seen

Dad gum your hide boy
Dad gum your dirty hide
Dad gum you dirty dog, I gave you a pig
And you wanted a hog

I thought he was my buddy
I thought he was my pal
Hah! He did me out of all my money
And then he tries to steal my gal
But one of these days I'm gonna get even
But in the meantime I hope he takes another drink
Stands up and drops dead

Dad gum your hide boy
Dad gum your dirty hide
Dad gum you dirty dog, I gave you a pig
And you wanted a hog

Yes and you cam into my house
And you ate my spaghetti and meatballs
You wore my brand new suit
And you wore my brand new shoes
You beat me out of all my money, and you stole my wife
And boy I'm telling you nobody, but nobody eats my food
Listen I should get you a short stick boy
And beat you so bad
I'm angry now, somebody hold me back
I mean it, boy am I angry, somebody hold me back
Hold me back, I mean it, somebody hold me back
