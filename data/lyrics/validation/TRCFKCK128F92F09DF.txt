Pop a top again
I've just got time for one more round
Set 'em up my friend
Then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down

I'd like for you to listen to
A joke I heard today
From a woman who said she was through
And calmly walked away

I tried to smile and did awhile
But it felt so out of place
Did you ever hear of a clown with teardrops
Streaming down his face

Pop a top again
I think, I'll have another round
Another one my friend
Then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down

All to me is misery
And here I'm wasting time
'Cause a row of fools on a row of stools
Is not what's on my mind

But then you see her leaving me
Is not what I prefer
So it's either here, a drinking beer
Or home remembering her

Pop a top again
I think, I'll have another round
Another one my friend
Then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down
