What was I thinking that you were thinking
When you told me how much she cares about that boy outside?
Forget what you should be
Drive half way and meet me
I'll be your constant, your reminder
How to fly from nine to five
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

Let's make the other bed she'd sleep in
Recount the plastic stars taped to his ceiling
May they all fall down
The list goes on and on
Of words that you wrote down
The list goes on and on
Of words you'd take back now

What were you thinking that I was thinking
When you told me about how badly she wants you to decide?
Between lifeless and sweetly, or lose her completely
And I can't imagine how it felt to let that slide and die inside
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh

Let's make the other bed she'd sleep in
Recount the plastic stars taped to his ceiling
May they all fall down
The list goes on and on
Of words that you wrote down
The list goes on and on
Of words you'd take back now
What were you thinking?
