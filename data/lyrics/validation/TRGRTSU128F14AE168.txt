I turned around today
Thought I saw you crying
Sad, defeated so afraid
You're strong and beautiful
Oh, there's no denying
You're a child of light
Though shadows cloud your way

(chorus)
In your eyes, I see love
I see laughter
I see hope for the dreams
Life has shattered
I can see in your eyes
It is Christ, it is love
You're the image of

In your face I see
Through the tears you're crying
Reflections of the risen Christ
So rise and feel the sun
Fly with wings of angels
Through the dark of night
Feel your spirit burning bright

(bridge)
I'm so glad to see you smile
Compassionate and strong
You're a vision of his song
And I'm so glad to see you smile
It's Christ you're the image of

In your eyes, I see love
I see laughter
I can see in your eyes
It is Christ...

(chorus)
