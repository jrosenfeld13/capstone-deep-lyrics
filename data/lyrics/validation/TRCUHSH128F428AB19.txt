(phil vassar, charlie black)

Joe and rosalita, look'em up in the year book
Even then they had that wild-in-love crazy look
Joe's car on friday night, after the ball game
Steam so thick on the windows
They could write their names
They'd fight like cats and dogs outside of homeroom
See'em hangin' all over each other that same afternoon

Joe and rosalita
Ball-cap, good-ole boy and brown-eyed senorita
Rocked this town like no one's ever done
'round here they're known as the legends of love

Old mr.rosenbaum kicked'em out of the senior prom
Busted for dirty dancin'
Sent him home and he called her mom
Pulled the old pillow trick, and they both snuck out
Showed up two days later still in a tux and a prom gown
Got married on the steps outside the courthouse
Called it the great escape, people still talk about it now

Joe and rosalita
Ball-cap, good-ole boy and brown-eyed senorita
Rocked this town like no one's ever done
'round here they're known as the legends of love

Rosalita is still a rose
Now it's been 10 years for rose and joe
Now sometimes you see'em cruisin' down main street
Still got his arm around her, two kids in the backseat
They book a babysitter to go out on friday
Sometimes they never even make it out of the driveway

Joe and rosalita
Ball-cap, good-ole boy and brown-eyed senorita
Rocked this town like no one's ever done
'round here they're known as the legends of love
