[Verse 1]
Come along take a ride
Across the sky for an hour
Leave your mind take your soul
Fill the hole with flowers
From the lake through the trees
In the streets for the powder
In the creed for the freeze
I got a place this power

[Pre-Chorus]
Because I am a lie
Because I am a lie

[Chorus 1]
I will lead you for a while
Take you place to place
Bring you to this pyre
See you face to face, yeah

[Verse 2]
Come along to this flick
Take your sympathy with your symphony
See this dish
A wonderful wish
It's the perfect kiss
It's the real thing
See the pitch
It's the greatest of hits
It's the missing with the wishing
At least you caught a smile
When you coughed awhile
When you did this kissing

[Pre-Chorus]
Because I am a lie
Because I am a lie

[Chorus 2]
I will lead you for a while
Take you place to place
Bring you to this pyre
See you face to face

[Bridge]
I will lead you
I will lead you

[Outro]
See you face to face
Face to face
See you face to face
Face to face
Yeah
See you face to face
Face to face
I'll see you face to face
Yeah
