[Verse 1]
I don't care what nobody says
We're going to have a baby
Taking off in a Coupe de Ville
She's buckled up on navy
She don't care what her momma says
No, she going to have my baby
Taking all that I have to take
This takings going to shake me

[Chorus]
People call us renegades
Because we like living crazy
We like taking on the town
Because people's getting lazy

[Verse 2]
I don't care what nobody says
No, I'm gonna be her lover
Always mad and usually drunk
But I love her like no other
And the doctor seems to say he don't know
Where we're going to go
I'm a ghost and I don't think I quite know
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna go

[Chorus]
People call us renegades
Because we like living crazy
We like taking on the town
Because people's getting lazy

[Verse 3]
I don't care what nobody says
No I'm going to be her lover
Always mad and usually drunk
But I love her like no other
And her daddy he says he don't know
Where we're going to go
I'm a ghost and I don't think I quite know
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna go

[Chorus]
People call us renegades
Because we like living crazy
We like taking on the town
Because people's getting lazy

[Verse 4]
I don't care what nobody says
We're going to have a baby
Takin off in a Coupe de Ville
She's buckled up on navy
She don't care what her momma says
No, she going to have my baby
I'm takin' all I have to take
This takings going to shape me
