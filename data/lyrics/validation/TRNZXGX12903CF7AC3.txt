[Verse 1]
Times are hard and rents are high
What can a working girl do
But struggle through another day
Then I'll take care of you
Nights are long and dreams are cold
If they're all you wake up to
But should you rise with crying eyes
Then I'll take care of you

[Chorus 1]
So let them talk about us
Let them call us funny things
People sometimes do
I don't care as long
As you know I love you
Oh, and you know I do

[Chorus 2]
I'll be there, but you might not see me
It's never easy to get through
But when the laughter dies away
Then I'll take care of you

[Chorus 1]
So let them talk about us
Let them call us funny things
People sometimes do
I don't care as long
As you know I love you
Oh, and you know I do

[Chorus 2]
I'll be there, but you might not see me
It's never easy to get through
But when the laughter dies away
Then I'll take care of you

[Outro]
Darling, I'll take care of you
