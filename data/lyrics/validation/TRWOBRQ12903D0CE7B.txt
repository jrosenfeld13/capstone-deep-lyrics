As I sit here
And slowly close my eyes
I take another deep breath
And feel the wind pass through my bodyI'm the one in your soul
Reflecting in the light
Protect the ones who hold you
Cradling your inner childI need serenity
In a place where I can hide
I need serenity
Nothing changes, days go byWhere do we go when we just don't know
And how do we relight the flame when it's cold?
Why do we dream when our thoughts mean nothing
And when will we learn to control?Tragic visions
Slowly stole my life
Tore away everything
Cheating me out of my timeI'm the one who loves you
No matter wrong or right
And every day I hold you
I hold you with my inner childI need serenity
In a place where I can hide
I need serenity
Nothing changes, days go byWhere do we go when we just don't know
And how do we relight the flame when it's cold?
Why do we dream when our thoughts mean nothing
And when will we learn to control?
