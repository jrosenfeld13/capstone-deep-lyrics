One too many days
I've felt forgotten
And one too many nights
I've slept alone
And every time I watch the fruit turn rotten
I tell myself I'll try a little harder
Next time

Sacred are the ties
That love entrusts us
Even if they fray
Before they bind
And I'm afraid I never
Did you justice
So I'm going to feel my
Love a little stronger
Make it last a little longer
Next time

Next time
I ain't gonna fall on my knees
And come out of love emptyhanded
But next time I'll be even harder to please
When will the next time be?
Next time
I ain't gonna fall on my knees
And come out of love emptyhanded
But next time I'll be even harder to please
When will the next time be?

One too many days
I've felt forgotten
And one too many nights I've slept alone
And every time I watch the fruit turn rotten
I tell myself I'll try a little harder
Play my cards a little smarter
Next time
Wo-hoh-NEXT TIME
