[Phone Call skit]
"Hello Barbara, this is Shirley
I would like you to know that the man...
Now wait a minute Shirley
I'm a young woman
And can't afford to all the things you do for this man
I don't even have A job
And I can't buy his clothes, pay his car notes
And I surely can't keep money in his pocket
But I can give him what he needs, when he needs it
And that's all he expects from me"

I can give him love
From his woman to you
There is a thing or two I'd like to say
I don't care who claims this man
I'm gonna love him any way...
Woman to woman
He spent last night with me
Stayed here cause this is where he wanted to be
From his woman to you
I've got to make it
Just play as I can

Seems to me you're doing too much for the man
From his woman to you
That you begging loving
It's giving up yourself
And I feel sorry for you, I feel sorry for you
I don't mind sharing
If you don't bother me
I won't bother you
From his woman to you
I don't know what you're gonna, gonna do
But he is giving to me
What he is getting from you
Woman to woman
That's the truth
From his woman to you
Seems like you're the fool
I; m his only woman

And I love him
And I ain't about to give him up
I'm his only woman, woman to woman
I just want to let you know
That I ain't gonna never, never let him go
Woman to woman, I'm his only woman
