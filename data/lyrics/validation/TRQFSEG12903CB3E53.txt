You`re wearing this mask and you`re ok
You bury yourself when you say
The truth  But finally you will
You hide behind an inner smile
When the one is passing by
And turns away
What am I to do now
Colors fade to grey
What am I to do now
In this London rain
This London rain
I just hear your name
I`m screaming it into this London rain
I don`t look back
I don`t react no more
So dead and lame
On my way through this London rain
I don`t look back
I don`t react no more
I just hear your name
I`m screaming it into this London rain
I don`t look back
I don`t react no more
So dead and lame
On my way through this London rain
I don`t look back
I don`t react no more
And still I`m waiting
For the one who is to blame
Still hesitating in this London rain
London rain
