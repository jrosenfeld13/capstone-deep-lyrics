I'm hangin' on the phone I can still feel a line cuz 5 minutes too long I'm tired of wasting green shit ink and friends time fun and dreams on someone who doesn't care 3 weeks is not long when you know where is your heart but It will be long for me cuz I don't know how you'll be what are those eyes what are those smiles what are these tears I don't understand (you) maybe it's a lie maybe you'll drive by but all those remarks keeps me alone in the dark (all over again) dream stars dreams smile
