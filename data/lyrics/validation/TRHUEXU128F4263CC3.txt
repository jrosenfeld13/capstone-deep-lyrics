[Verse 1]
Listen closely to me now, my darlin' girl
There's one who's out to have you and just his breath will burn your curls
Don't you fret, you needn't bother
Don't you fret, here comes the Father, yeah

[Verse 2]
Whatcha doing up atop my roof
Creeping across them shingles
You about scared me half to death, girl
What's your name, Ruthie Lingle?

[Verse 3]
Oh yeah, I heard your talking
That little Jesus geek need a good ass, good ass clocking
Oh yeah, I seen your mocking
Don't you dare boy, think my Lord hath done forgotten? No

[Verse 4]
I beseech thee, Lord, clear my head
Before once again I scar the soul of that girl in my bed
O Lord, clear my bed before once again
I scar the soul of that girl in my head

[Coda]
Revenge is mine saith the Lord
