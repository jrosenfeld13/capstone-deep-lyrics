I was looking for a something
That I couldn't find
I was searching for a lover
That made me blind
All the people say I'm crazy
And I don't know why

Hold me by the hand baby
Never make say
I will try and find a way to tell you
And risk it all
While this mystery keeps on saying
Make that call
I can give you all my reasons
But that ain't much
Whisper in my ear... Baby

One more time
One more time... Hug me baby
Don't let me lose this time... Touch me baby
One more time... Love me baby
Take me by the hand
And make me understand

If you've found another lover
And tell me now
I can tell you there's no other
I'll show you how
While this rain just keeps on falling
I'll find a smile
Voices in my head whisper

One more time
One more time... Hug me baby
Don't let me lose this time... Touch me baby
One more time... Love me baby
And whisper one more time
And make me understand
