I once had a true love and I loved him so well
I loved him far better than my tongue can tell
And I thought that he spoke and to me did say
"It will not be long, love, 'til our wedding day"

If I were an eagle and had wings for to fly
I would fly to his castle and there I would lie
On a bed of green laurel I would lay myself down
And with my fond dreams I would my love surround

I dreamt last night that my true love came in
So slowly he came that his feet made no din
And I thought that he spoke and to me did say
"It will not be long, love, 'til our wedding day"
