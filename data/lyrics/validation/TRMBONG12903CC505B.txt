(Rob Crosby/Charlie Craig)

When I see that smile
Look into those eyes
I can't get over you
My defenses fall
And I lose control
There's nothing I can do

Don't look at me like that
It just brings back the past
And I'm right back in love again
Just when I'm doing well
I fall under your spell
Right where I've always been
If you want me to walk away
And not look back
Don't look at me like that

After all this time
You'd think that I
Could let you go that fast
I must look like a fool
Standing here talking to
Your photograph

Don't look at me like that
It just brings back the past
And I'm right back in love again
Just when I'm doing well
I fall under your spell
Right where I've always been
If you want me to walk away
And not look back
Don't look at me like that
