Oil of love, swimming in a zodiac
Lion's den, pig juice, crown on the dingo king
I got a line to the stars, I got wire to my self
I'm gonna use all you pigs for something else

Yeah

Suffi's in the penthouse nailed to a wall of flesh
Yeah, superjudge rolls up on every pussy-fool in town
I got meat in my hands, I got an eighth in my head
I'm gonna bleed on this town until its red

Oil of love, swimming in a zodiac
Lion's den, pig juice, crown on a dingo king
I got a line to the stars, I got a wire to myself
I'm gonna use all you pigs for something else
