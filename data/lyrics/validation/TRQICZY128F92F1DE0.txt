She got the #27
Taken off her license plate
'cause that was my basketball number
Back when we started to date

And I know
It's better to be unfaithful
To the people that you liked last year

Chorus:
You're still the same
You'll never change
Always a change
You're still the same

She's got a pretty mod CD collection
In the glovebox of her car
All the Blur and The Cure and Oasis cases
Tell me you get struck by stars

And I know
It's better to be unfaithful
To the things that you liked last year

[Chorus]
I can't run, I can't hide
This ain't no Marco Polo
You've gone and given yourself away
And all this time, I just thought that I was craazy

[Chorus x 2]
