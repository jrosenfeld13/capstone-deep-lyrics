Trpped in a bloody storm of dust my eyes are sharing the darkness at dawn
A new solistice is coming covering the daylight with a dark veil as a
Funeral curtain on the childish corpse
Full of bolled the moon is calling her children the abomination arrive
Straight from the shadow land
Where we standing for the revelation of doom. Nellish sentinels raise the
Apocalyptic terror
For our last hours are coming kings will be kings domination will be see ! ! !

The scripts from the underworld have taught me the unholy predicton of xul
".....the return of the dark empire my horned lord and his mighty legions
Shall pound the earth and celebrate the retribution of the holy trinity: ! !

(LEAD : NEBIROS / NORGEST)

(CHORUS:)
Gleaming sharpen iron jag millions of holy faithful blood guts spreading on
The batlle ground screaming of pain when satan's hammer sweeping the holy
Kingdom agony.... Yes agony's stiflinem hard and slow !
For the end of time we ride the holocaust we fight
We summon devil's daughter to copulate and spread her infectious seeds
Through the idiotic human race

Genocide Numanicide Infanticide Christianicide......
Genocide Numanicide Infanticide Christianicide......

The mightiest violence is executed to destroy every christian bitch ?
Pounding and shaking and mutilating and raping corpses blasted everywhere
Deceiver tears in blasphemy
Their desolate planet which they've built in peace and disgusting love of
Their jesus-Rats !
They will tear apart the dead white christ under the flagellation of my
Tongue
My black wings stained of blood are sweeping the holy kingdom in agony under
The commandments of our legions, but just in regards to the retribution of
Thr holy trinity....

(CHORUS:)
Gleaming sharpen iron jag millions of holy faithful blood guts spreading on
The batlle ground screaming of pain when satan's hammer sweeping the holy
Kingdom agony.... Yes agony's stiflinem hard and slow !
For the end of time we ride the holocaust we fight
We summon devil's daughter to copulate and spread her infectious seeds
Through the idiotic human race
