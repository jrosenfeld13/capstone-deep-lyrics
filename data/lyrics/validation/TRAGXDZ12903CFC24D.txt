Time will tell and so will those little things
You keep tucked in your head
Cause I wasn't born with enough of an innocence
To keep coming back for more

She must of lied to you
Before I had her

All day long I sit and communicate with the dead
Corpse that I call my girlfriend
And she's only half of the girl that I met
See it takes true love to watch her decay

She must of lied to you
Before I had her
She must of lied to you
Before I had the time to sit and
Think about those little things that creep inside
And tear me apart

I'm sorry I never meant to hurt you
But I'm going down that road alone
And never coming back

All day long I sit and communicate with the dead
Corpse that I call my girlfriend

She must of lied to you
Before I had her
She must of lied to you before I had
Her heart
