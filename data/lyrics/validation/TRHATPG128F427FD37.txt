At least I pretend I can change
The solidarity of shame
At least I pretend I can change
Amid your four walls of stubborn grey
Swapping handshakes for bullets
Swapping handshakes for bullets

Paint the town, paint the town red
With the blood of the elders
Paint the town, paint the town red
Anything goes, everything goes, nothing remains

What youcan see can leave you blind
Just watch the victims as they pass you by
What you can see can leave you blind
To live life permanently glazed
Swapping handshakes for bullets
Swapping handshakes for bullets

Paint the town, paint the town red
With the blood of the elders
Paint the town, paint the town red
Anything goes, everything goes, nothing remains

Swapping handshakes for bullets, wrapped up in civilised fury
Swapping handshakes for bullets, wrapped up in civilised fury

Paint the town, paint the town red
With the blood of the elders
Paint the town, paint the town red

Paint the town, paint the town red
With the blood of the elders
Paint the town, paint the town red
Anything goes, everything goes, nothing remains
