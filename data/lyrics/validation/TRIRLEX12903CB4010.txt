(You didn't even say goodbye)
So I sit here & I cry
There's nothing left for me to do
But I'm still waiting here for you

(You didn't even say you cared)
Now my love in you is shared
I don't know why you made me blue
But I'm still waiting here for you

I will walk through the storm
All my tears fell like the rain
I will long & I will mourn
Till you're back in my arms once again

(So darling, won't you hear my plea)
& please return your love to me
& then I will not be so blue
& I'll no longer wait for you

(So darling, won't you hear my plea) Darling, hear my plea
(Please return your love to me) Return your love to me
& I will not be so blue
& I'll no longer wait for you

(You didn't even say goodbye)
