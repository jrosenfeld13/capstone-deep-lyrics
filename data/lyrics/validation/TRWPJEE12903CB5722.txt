I'm gonna get up in the mornin'
I believe I should go back home
I'm gonna get up in the mornin'
I believe I should go back home
I'm gonna find my baby
Acknowledge that I done her wrong
I don't want no woman
That stays drunk all the time
I don't want no woman
That stays drunk all the time
Well you know she's a wild woman
'bout to drive me out of my mind
I believe, I believe
I'm going back home
I believe, I believe
I'm going back home
I gotta lie to my baby
I know I treated her wrong
I believe, I believe
My time ain't long
I believe, I believe
My time ain't long
I left my room this mornin'
I know I treat my baby wrong
