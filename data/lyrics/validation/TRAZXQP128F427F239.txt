[Verse 1: Bobby Vinton]
A long, long time ago
On graduation day
You handed me your book
I signed this way

[Chorus: Bobby Vinton]
"Roses are red, my love
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet, my love
But not as sweet as you. "

[Verse 2: Bobby Vinton]
We dated through high school
And when the big day came
I wrote into your book
Next to my name

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Bobby Vinton]
Then I went far away
And you found someone new
I read your letter dear
And I wrote back to you

[Refrain: Bobby Vinton]
"Roses are red, my love
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet, my love
But luck may God bless you. "

[Verse 4: Bobby Vinton]
Is that your little girl?
She looks a lot like you
Someday some boy will write
In her book, too

[Chorus x2]
