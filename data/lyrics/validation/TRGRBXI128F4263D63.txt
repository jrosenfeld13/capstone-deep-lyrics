When I was born
You were a sapling on the lawn
And as I grew
You developed, too
Strong limbs that I liked to tease
Would billow in the breeze
Intoxicating bees

Oh and in your shade
I was first laid
You stood and you swayed
I moved on, you stayed

I moved on, you stayed

When I was born
You were a sapling on the lawn
And as I grew
You developed, too

And promises were made
