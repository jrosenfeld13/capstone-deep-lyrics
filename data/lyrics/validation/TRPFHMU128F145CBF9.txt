(Love come down)
No sleep last night
Been dreaming of you
Please hold me tight
Cause I can't help the way that I feel
I just can't help the way that I feel

Deep in the night
You took my heart
Now danger's in sight
Cause I can't help the way that I feel
I just can't help the way that I feel
Do do dit dit dit dit
Dit dit do do do

Baby you make my love come down
Oh you make my love come down
Make it come all the way down
Oh you make my love come down
Baby you make my love come down
Oh you make my love come down

Can't do without your tender love
There's no way out
And I can't help the way that I feel
I just can't help the way that I feel
