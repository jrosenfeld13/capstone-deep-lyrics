[Verse 1]
There's this one guy
There's no one like him in all the world
Cause you can always see
Those girls down on their knees
In those dark sweaty rooms
Planning out his thoughts
He's waiting for just the right

[Chorus]
One by one as they
Walk right through the door, they
Keep on coming back I
Guess they just want more
He has fun fun fun and you
Might call him a whore, but
Just look where he's at cause
He is the one that scores

[Interlude: Mark and Tom as play-by-play radio announcers]
Mark: Well Tom, it looks like he's passing the ball to his tight end
Tom: I wasn't sure if he knew that a tight end
Could be a wide receiver
But haha, but little does he know 
Mark: Yeah, he won't be alone this weekend I don't think
Tom: That's funny that you say that because, uh
Like a dog he's loyal to his bone

[Verse 2]
I saw my friend there
Out on the field today
I asked him where he's going, he said
"All the way," now

[Chorus]
One by one as they
Walk right through the door, they
Keep on coming back I
Guess they just want more
He has fun fun fun and you
Might call him a whore, but
Just look where he's at cause
He is the one that scores

[Outro]
Go!
