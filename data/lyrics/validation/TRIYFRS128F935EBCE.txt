I Give You My Body Baby (3x)
I Give You, Give You, Give You My Body Baby

No Time 2 Waste (4x)

Chorus:
No Time 2 Waste
I've Gotta Move With Haste
Sorry Baby But I Have No Time 2 Waste
No Time 2 Waste
I've Gotta Move With Haste
Sorry Baby But I Have No Time 2 Waste

No Time 2 Waste - No Time
No Time 2 Waste - No Time!
No Time 2 Waste - No Time
No Time 2 Waste - No Time!

Rap:
Hold Me Love Me Yes You Can
I Wanna Be Your Loverman
If You Wanna Get On The Mike To Check
Make Sure My Lifestyle's Correct
Pick It Up, Let It Go, Let It Go
Can You Feel My Pulse, I Know Not To Slow
Oh, You Move Me, Sex Me, Groove Me
Work My Body, Show Me, Do Me Now
You Don't Know That I Know
You Know That I Know What You Know
So I Know That I Can Do This

Chorus

Rap:
Now You Go, I Stay Behind
Girls Like You Are Hard To Find
Days And Nights Feelin' Sublime
Coz' My Love Is Now So Kind
Anytime... Anyway, Anyhow
Gotta Get In Scene Like A Bowowow
Chasing You Like I'm Chasin' Bones
Just You Wait 'till I Get You Home
Now...
You Don't Know That I Know
You Know That I Know What You Know
So I Know That I Can Do This

Chorus

I Give You My Body Baby (3x)
I Give You, Give You, Give You My Body Baby

No Time 2 Waste (8x + Fade Out)
