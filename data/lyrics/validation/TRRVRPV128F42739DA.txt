I'm gonna fight for lovin' all the way till I have your love to stay
I need your body take me down give to me the love I found
Just close you round and round
Round bringin' you down
Take a look is what I feel
Boy, I'm gonna make you want me
You want me

You gotta beat it
You gotta beat it
You gotta beat it
Why don't you beat it

Beat inside of me

Why do you think you're doing wasting time
Baby, I need to make you mine
Why can't you see the ladies dark
Boy, I think you'are mad enough
Just close you round and round
Round bringin' you down
Take a look is what I feel
Boy, I'll get until you want me
You want me
