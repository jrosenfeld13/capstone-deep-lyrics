Just when I thought my life was rising
Doctors left me here to die
Trapped in a cage, locked in a prison
Won't someone break this cursed lie!?

These walls are cold behind the steel door
Hear me scream, I'm begging to be free...
My senses wonder am I dead or alive
I hear the Devil laugh at me

Everyday no way out
Everyday nowhere to run
They're coming after me
Doctors with their pain...

Take me away from here forever
Take me away from here forever

Just when I thought my life was rising
Doctors left me here to die
Trapped in a cage, locked in a prison
Won't someone break this cursed lie!?

Everyday no way out
Everyday nowhere to run
They're coming after me
Doctors with their pain...

Take me away from here forever
Take me away from here forever
Take me away from here forever
Take me away from here forever
