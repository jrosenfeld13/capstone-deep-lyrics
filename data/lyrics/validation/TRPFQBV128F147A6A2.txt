I set a play while you sweep the dirt off the floor
It's not right
No one is saying that you haven't heard this before
But I like
And I'm sorry if I ever did you harm
But I missed you
I got a working broken home

Too many people spend all their time alone
Too many people never know when to go home
And if this time we'll run away

I don't know you've got love in your eye
When you just want to start a fight
Someone is saying the war we are waging
Just doesn't feel right

Too many people spend all their time alone
Too many people never know when to go home
And if this time we'll run away

Same old, same old, same old
Same old, same old, same old

Days go by
Oh, I try to be

Same old, same old, same old
Same old, same old, same old

Too many people spend all their time alone
Too many people never know when to go home
And if this time we'll run away
