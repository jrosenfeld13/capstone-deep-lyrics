[Verse 1]
In a way, it's all a matter of time
I will not worry for you, you'll be just fine
Take my thoughts with you, and when you look behind
You will surely see a face that you recognize

[Chorus]
You're not alone, I'll wait 'til the end of time
Open your mind, surely it's plain to see
You're not alone, I'll wait 'til the end of time for you
Open your mind, surely there's time to be with me

[Verse 2]
It is the distance that makes life a little hard
Two minds that once were close, now, so many miles apart
I will not falter, though, I'll hold on 'til you're home
Safely back where you belong, and see how our love has grown

[Chorus]
You're not alone, I'll wait 'til the end of time
Open your mind, surely it's plain to see
You're not alone, I'll wait till the end of time for you
Open your mind, surely there's time to be with me

You're not alone, I'll wait 'til the end of time
Open your mind, surely it's plain to see
You're not alone, I'll wait 'til the end of time for you
Open your mind, surely there's time to be with me

You're not alone, I'll wait 'til the end of time
Open your mind, baby, there's time to be with me
You're not alone, I'll wait 'til the end of time
Open your mind, surely there's time to be with me

You're not alone, I'll wait 'til the end of time for you
Open your mind, baby, there's time for me and you
