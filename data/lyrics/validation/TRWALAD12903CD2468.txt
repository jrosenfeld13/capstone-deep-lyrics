For goodness sake! We need a break
From all the things that make us make our own mistakes
Stifle the hurt and this low down feeling
Because I'm the bane of whatever this may be
There's always something that brings it back to me
A wave that takes me under, so watch me slip away
There's always something that shakes my self belief
But if I'm too blind to see you can put the blame on me
Our time is nearly over
You'll get it soon enough
Chances are often there to seize
But I don't think you remember
I hope that you remember
Did I neglect to mention
That your chance is wasted now on me?
I don't think you remember
I hope that you remember
Take your chances well, before they are gone
So, is it right to feel uptight about the little things in life?
If there's one thing that I came with it's precious little time
I tried to make my choices with the though of you in mind
But if something good comes your way don't think twice
Because I think you'll get it if you bide your time
Every minute is a minute not to waste
I can't help you, see what's around you
The ties that bind you or what's inside you
