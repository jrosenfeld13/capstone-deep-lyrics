No words can express the emptiness I felt
Nothing can hide the way we felt inside
Stripped of our emotions, forced to reconcile
The suffering of a friend consumed us all the while
The rituals of life seem to lose their shine
So many times we let life pass by
So many times we don't even try
Feeling so useless, feeling so afraid
Awkward silence, unsure of what to say
Drowning in an ocean full of sorrow
Promise no today, promise no tomorrow
Look back and remember the times we shared
We were so much stronger, we were never scared
Never give up, never give in
This is the battle we must win
And when you're in the depths of despair
Know that I will be there
We will be there
We'll comfort you, we'll carry you...until the end
