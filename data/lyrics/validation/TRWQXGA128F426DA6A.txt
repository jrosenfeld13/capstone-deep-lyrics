Now there are people
That fall - into my life
Each one can change my world
So slightly
And everyone so different
Yet so much the same
Each and everyone so deep
Inside me

Chorus:
I love i hate
I live i die
For every single day
That passes me by
But for all the pain
That meets my eyes
I still believe in people

Now i've been called naive
Just a reckless dreamer
Destined to drown
In all my feelings
Yet i keep on smiling through my tears
Juggling wonderment with tear
Just trying to find some meaning

Repeat chorus

There are times when i feel
Like giving it all up
I'll look into myself and see a stranger
Oh and nothing can seem stranger
But i know
I'll come around
And like the fool i am
I'll see this world so much stronger cause that's the way my life lights spins
Until the day it dims
Until my life will be no longer

Repeat chorus
