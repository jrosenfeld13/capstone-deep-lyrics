Some kind of shade comes to my face When all my goals oppress my aims
You feel like a clown while to others
You're more than a winner: a model

And here I am to take what's mine
It took my a life to dare to try
What did I do wrong? I don't know
Maybe I should go

I should go
Oh, if you love me
Save me from this sea
I'm drowning in nothing

You lose your hair: you're not the same
The problem's your head it's not your age
What did I do wrong? I owe me
What not a single one wished me

And here I am to take what's mine
It took my a life to dare to try
What did I do wrong? I don't know
Maybe I should go

I should go
Oh, if you love me
Save me from this sea
I'm drowning in nothing

Maybe I should go
I should go
Maybe I should go
I should go
