[Verse 1:]
Wake up one morning you realise
Your life is one big compromise
Stuck in the job you swore was only temporary
Feel like the world is passin' you by
Never done all the things you wanted to try
Stuck in one place, got a pain in your face
From all your stressin' out

[PRE-Chorus]
You ask yourself there's got to be more than what I'm livin' for
You ask yourself there's got to be somethin else
Somethin' more, more, more

[Chorus]
Well let the sun shine on your face
And don't let your life go to waste
Now is the time, got to make up your mind
Let it shine on you, let it shine on you

[Verse 2:]
Feel like theres nothin', nowhere to go
You try and fight but you can't let go
Of all the pain, got so much to gain
Now is the time
You ask yourself there's got to be somethin else
Somethin' more, more, more

[Chorus]

[PRE-Chorus]

[Chorus]
