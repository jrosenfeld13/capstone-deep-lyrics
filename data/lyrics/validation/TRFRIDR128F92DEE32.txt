[Verse 1]
They're trying hard to put me in my place
And that is why I gotta keep running
The future's mine and it's no disgrace
'Cause in the end the past means nothing

You tell me I'm free then you tie me down
And from my chains I think it's a pity
What did it cost you to wear my crown
You don't like me why don't you admit it

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I feel a little down today
And I ain't got much to say
But you're gonna miss me when I'm not there
And you know I don't care
You know I don't care

[Chorus]
As we beg and steal and borrow
Life is hit and miss and this
I hope, I think, I know
If I ever hear the names you call
And if I stumble catch me when I fall
'Cause baby after all
You'll never forget my name
You'll never forget my name

[Verse 2]
You're trying hard to put me in my place
And that is why I gotta keep running
The future is mine and it's your disgrace
'Cause in the end your laugh means nothing

[Pre-Chorus 2]
D'you feel a little down today
Bet you ain't got much to say
Who's gonna miss you when you're not there
You know we don't care
You know we don't care

[Chorus]
As we beg and steal and borrow
Life is hit and miss and this
I hope, I think, I know
If I ever hear the names you call
And if I stumble catch me when I fall
'Cause baby after all you'll never forget my name
You'll never forget my name

[Chorus]
As we beg and steal and borrow
Life is hit and miss and this
I hope, I think, I know
If I ever hear the names you call
And if I stumble catch me when I fall
'Cause baby after all
You'll never forget my name
You'll never forget my name

[Outro]
You'll never forget my name
You'll never forget my name
You'll never forget my name
You'll never forget my name
