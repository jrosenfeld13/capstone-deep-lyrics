One fine day you'll look at me
One fine day
You're gonna want me for your girl.........
And youll know our love was meant to be

The arms I long for will open wide
Oh Yeah
And you'll be proud to have me right by your side
One fine day
Your gonna want me for your girl
You're the kind of boy
Though I know

I'll keep waiting and
Someday, darling
Who only want's to run around
You'll come to me when

You want to settle down, oh

One fine day
And then you'll want the love you threw away before
We'll meet once more
One fine day
One fine day
You're gonna want me for your girl....
One fine day (fade to end)
You're gonna want me for your girl.....
*cha*
