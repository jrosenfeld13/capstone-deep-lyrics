One more night and I know
That I'll be over you
One more night and I know
That the worst is through
And if I can make this heart
Just believe it too
Then one more night and I know
That I'll be over you

One more night and I know
That I'll forget your voice
One more night and I know
That I can make that choice
And ignore the awful sounds
That come when love's destroyed
One more night and I know
That'll I'll forget your voice

I'll escape it if I learn to take it
And just survive two or three
Of the next million thoughts
That I have about you and me

--- Instrumental ---

I'll escape it if I learn to take it
And just survive two or three
Of the next million thoughts
That I have about you and me

(One more night)
(One more night)

Yeah, One more night
Oh, One more night
Oh, One More, One more night
One More One More One more night
One more night
One More One More One More One More night...
