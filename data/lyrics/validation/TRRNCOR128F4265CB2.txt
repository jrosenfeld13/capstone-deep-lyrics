[Verse 1]
Well the train to Grinderswitch is runnin' right on time
And the Tucker boys are cookin' down in Caroline
People down in Florida can't be still
When old Lynyrd Skynyrd's pickin' down in Jacksonville
People down in Georgia come from near and far
To hear Richard Betts pickin' on that red guitar

[Refrain]
So gather 'round, gather 'round children
Get down, well just get down children
Get loud, well you can be loud and be proud
And you can be proud here
And I'll be proud to a rebel 'cause South's gonna do it again
And again

[Verse 2]
Elvin Bishop's sittin' on a bale of hay
He ain't good lookin' but he sure can play
And there's ZZ Top and you can't forget
That old brother Willie's gettin' soakin' wet
And all the good people down in Tennessee
Are diggin' Barefoot Jerry and the C.D.B

[Refrain]
Well gather 'round, gather 'round children
Get down, well you can get down children
Get loud, well you can get loud and be proud
Well you can be proud here
Be proud to a rebel 'cause South's gonna do it again
Yes it is
