Save me

Out of nowhere you said
Wait for me, wait for me
And out of nowhere you read
Straight into me, into me

Left me wanting to know
Where do we go, do we go
Somewhere dark and remote
I wanna know, wanna know

Is this real, am I just making this up?
Or will you be my surprise?
Dont wake me up, wake me up

Is this real, are you gonna sweep me off my feet?
Or am I here foolishly
Waiting for a ghost to come and save me
Save me
