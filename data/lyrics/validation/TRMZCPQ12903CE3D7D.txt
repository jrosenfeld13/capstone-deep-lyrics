Memories and old cd's of living easy
Three o'clock bus stop; regards my elementary
I recall my sandy feet inside my car
Low tide, old airport had blessed me with my
Favorite scar
Why does every simple thing seem to complicate me?
Running back and forth so I can be....
Back home, Back home, Back home, Back home
Bob and Pac with billie stuffed inside my luggage
I'm a foreign man who doesn't speak the language
Words and sketches, notes on napkins underlined;
In the lab still underneath L.A. and I'm asking why....
Why does every simple thing seem to complicate me?
Running back and forth so I can be....
Back home, Back home, Back home, Back home
Grab my notebook, spill it on to "2" tape
And hit the 101, 'cuz we've just begun;
To make your system shake, and
Perfect paragraphs in this letter
Explaining what I remember;
House parties, green bottles and my friends
Why does every simple thing seem to complicate me?
Running back and forth so I can be....
Back home, Back home, Back home, Back home
Back home, Back home, Back home, Back home!
