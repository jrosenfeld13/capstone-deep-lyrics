Looking at you with a tear, oh, ho
Just don't let it get to you, oh, ho
Playing on your sympathy
Now you're the bad guy, can't you see
Don't you know it's just a game

You fell for it, give me a break, oh, ho
Taking all than you can give, oh, ho
Playing up your misery
But you're the victim, can't you see
Don't you know it's just a game

Playing on your sympathy
Yeah, you're the bad guy, can't you see
Don't you know it's just a game
Don't you know it's just a game
Don't you know it's just a game
