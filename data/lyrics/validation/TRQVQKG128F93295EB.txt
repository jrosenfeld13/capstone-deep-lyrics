This is only to explain
How it is to love again
Should I begin
With the touch of a skin on skin
This is but a simple song
The snows have thawed the floods have come
Bitter yesterdays
Have all been washed away
Sorry if I move a little slow
Sorry if my table is bare
I can't remember having anybody here
It's been a long winter
I never thought I'd feel the sun again
Last day of frozen crystal clear
I see your name hang in the air
A stronger pulse will pull me back
The ice will start to crack
It's but a moment to explain
How it is to love again
Should we begin
With the touch of skin on skin?
