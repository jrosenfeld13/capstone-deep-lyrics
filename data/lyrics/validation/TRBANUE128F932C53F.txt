[Verse 1]
Were running every way but loose
And all our parts have been misused
The lines are drawn just to be crossed and
All direction gets us lost

[Pre-Chorus]
Those parlour tricks are so divine when were
Left to our own devices
The sweetest kicks are so refined when were
Left to our own devices

[Spoken]
Heres my prediction

[Verse 2]
The futures bound to come in twos
For every win theres one to lose so
Hold on to those horoscopes
This misanthrope is on the ropes

[Pre-Chorus]
Those parlour tricks are so divine when were
Left to our own devices
The sweetest kicks are so refined when were
Left to our own devices
Isnt it nice to know your vices?

[Chorus]
Little miss discretion
Likes to run through the intersections
When she arrives without design
It leaves me so unsatisfied

[Spoken]
Oh
Darling you know
Im only a man
I cant understand

[Verse 3]
Chance is for the cautious few
Who dont make up for the abuse
Why dont love me?
Why dont you leave me?
Why dont you oh
Show me the door

[Pre-Chorus]
Those parlour tricks are so divine when were
Left to our own devices
The sweetest kicks are so refined when were
Left to our own devices
Isnt it nice to know your vices?

[Chorus]
Little miss discretion
Likes to run through the intersections
When she arrives without design
It leaves me so unsatisfied
Little miss discretion
Likes to run through the intersections
When she arrives without design
It leaves me so unsatisfied

[Outro]
You know it leaves me so unsatisfied
It leaves me so unsatisfied
Cuz lately weve been riding high on
Crimes, hits and politics
