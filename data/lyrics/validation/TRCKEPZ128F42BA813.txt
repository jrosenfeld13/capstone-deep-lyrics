Yeah cut 'em off me
I could do this with stumps
Hands off me
I know I can do without

Hands on the block
Hands on the ground
Hands in the bag
'Cause you know I've found
What I can do with the stumps
The USA runs on

Why hold back?
I'll wear 'em around my neck
There ain't no holding out
There ain't no looking back
I seen the plan
I seen the map
Got no time for dead weight
Don't need no handicap
