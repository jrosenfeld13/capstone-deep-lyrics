[Verse 1]
I can only hurt your case
It's written on your face
You always come to me
I won't be used, but

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't fight you anymore
I know I'll open up the door, oh

[Chorus]
No! I won't! I can't! Not anymore
One more time and I think I'll fucking die
Why, do I
Always have to suffer the consequences?

[Verse 2]
Stay away from who I am
'Cause I know what you are
I can't believe you're here
Then again, you know that

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't fight you anymore
I know I'll open up the door, oh

[Chorus]
No! I won't! I can't! Not anymore
One more time and I think I'll fucking die
Why, do I
Always have to suffer the consequences?

[Verse 3]
Stop, I know your goddamn game
It's always been the same
The story hasn't changed
Neither will you, but

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't fight you anymore
I know I'll open up my soul, oh

[Chorus]
No! I won't! I can't! Not anymore
One more time and I think I'll fucking die
Why, do I
Always have to suffer the consequences?
No! I won't! I can't! Not anymore
One more time and I think I'll fucking die
Why, do I
Always have to suffer the consequences?
