It's my own fault baby, treat me the way you wanna do
It's my fault baby, treat me the way you wanna do
When I was lovin' you woman, long time you know I wouldn't be true

Once you told me that you love me, ooh you changed your mind
Once you told me that you love me, you, you changed your mind
I'm gonna send you back to your mother
You ain't no good

You used to make an all fancy woman, bring it all home to me
I go out every night, baby, look at me
Woman, let us be
My fault, baby, treat me the way you wanna do
When I was loving you, woman
All the time you know I wouldn't be true

Upon my knees, grabbing my right had
I'm gonna try to do better, better
You know I'm a trying the best I can

My fault, baby, oh, treat me the way you wanna do
When I was loving you, woman
All the time, I was loving

My fault, baby, treat me the way you wanna do
My fault, baby, treat me the way you wanna do
When I was loving you, woman

Oh yeah, oh yeah
All the time, all the time
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ah-ooo all the time now

You all know I
You all know I
You all know I do want you
Yeah, hey now
