It is the sweetest thing to know that
To know it is right
And what a sight
To step ahead and see the Son, now'

Not a cloud in mind
Or waiting on time
I've emptied my hands
And now I can, I can receive

The most amazing things seem to follow
The darkest of nights
And what a sight
I am saved from the deepest of graves, now'

Not a cloud in mind
Or waiting on time
I've emptied my hands
And now I can, I can receive

Today
May be the most beautiful day
I don't sing alone
And the angels say'

Today
May be the most wonderful day
I don't sing alone
And the angels say'
