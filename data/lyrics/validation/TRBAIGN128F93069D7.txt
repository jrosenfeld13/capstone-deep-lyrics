A yeah

Anybody ready to move

Some one said to me I can't take this economy
I've got a family and everybody's counting on me
Well looking at you there's something I don't see
I know you've issues but you don't seem to worry

Well this peace that no one understands but me
And I'm living today because I found a way to be good with what happens to me

[Chorus]
I got to find a reason to dance
I'm talking joy, joy, joy
Said I got to find a reason to dance
I'm talking joy, joy, joy

Someone said to me how can I smile
When people don't have food to eat
And does He even care
I feel so bad, so bad for all the people
Who don't believe that he's always there

To give us peace when don't understand somethings
And I'm living today because I found to be good with what happens to me

Oh I got find a reason to dance
I'm talking joy, joy, joy
I got find a reason to dance
I'm talking joy, joy, joy

Ku-rahm-nee ah cus seenda
Ku-rahm nee ah cus seenda

I gotta reason
I found a reason to dance
Yeah yeah
Well I gotta reason
I found a reason to dance yeah yeah

I got to find

[Chorus]
