Took a drive down the southern coast
I wanna find me something else
I wanna be with someone I'm not
It is time for the lowdown
Aahhh

This is the blood of christ
And a damn fine boujolais
I wanna be with somebody I'm not
It is time for the lowdown
Aaahhhhhh

I'm the greatest lie to walk this streets
And I stumble on my own feet
This right here is a love affair
With a bottle so sweet and fair
You can't hold a good man down
And I'm the greatest lie in this whole damn town
I don't feel like wasting more time

It's time for the lowdown
