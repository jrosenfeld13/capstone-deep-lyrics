Is this satellite?

I am revolving around Your sun
Sending a message to everyone
Wanna be Your signal
Wanna be Your sound
Can You feel it now?

(Be Your satellite)
To this world I'm shining like a star
(Burning through the night)
Reflect Your love, be Your satellite

Write Your name across the sky
Tell them the reasons why
Your love will never fail
Wanna be Your signal
Wanna be Your sound
Can You feel it now?

(Be Your satellite)
To this world I'm shining like a star
(Burning through the night)
Reflect Your love
