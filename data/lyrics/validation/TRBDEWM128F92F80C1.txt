When the cattle are prowlin'
And the coyotes are howlin'
Under the western sky
The cowboy is singin'
His spurs are a-jinglin'
As on the trail he rides

Chorus:
Woo...hoo, hoo hoo hoo hoo
Woo...hoo, hoo hoo hoo, hoo hoo hoo
Woo...hoo, hoo hoo hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo hoo, hoo, hoo

Many hours will he ride
On the trail far and wide
He's goin' home this fall
Don't care 'bout the weather
His heart's light as a feather
He sings to the cattle this call

Chorus

When the new day is dawning
And he wakes up yawning
Making his coffee strong
Makes his bed in a roll
Down the trail he will stroll
Singing his cattle the his song

Chorus

When the cattle are bedded
And the saddle horse shedded
Nothing seems to be wrong
He casts up his eyes
To the stars in the skies
He sings to the cattle this song

Chorus
