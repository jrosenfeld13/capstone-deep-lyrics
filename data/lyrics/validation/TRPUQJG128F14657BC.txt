I said the time is so rough
Jah Jah children don't cry
Dry your weeping eyes
Don't shed no tears
Sorrow will come yes
But don't let that provoke you
No no no
There's a road for everyman to trod
Trial and crosses will lean a your way
But press along
Brother sing press along
I & I got the same intention
To reach my destination
Come on press along
Brother sing press along
I said the feet they get so hot yes
Refuse from keep you going
I said the road is so rocky
As dark as hell is deep..........
