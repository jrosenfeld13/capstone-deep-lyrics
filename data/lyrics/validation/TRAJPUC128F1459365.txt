Thank the good lord for rock and roll
Thank the good lord for gin
Thank the good lord that women are made to satisfy their men
Thank the good lord for Black and Red and our good buddy Will
Thank the good lord most of all, for good old Bad Eye Bill

Bad Eye Bill from Maryville, got a yellow dog named Black
A blonde haired wife called Red, that runs around behind Bill's back
Bad Eye Bill and his buddy Will are known to take a drink or ten
Will would pick up an old guitar and Bad Eye Bill will sing

Bad Eye Bill got locked in jail, 'bout a week or so ago
Swore to the jailer and the preacher that the good lord had saved his soul
Bill went home found Black and Red in bed with his buddy Will
He shot 'em all and he started singin', and he's still singin' in jail
