Think I wanna die if you don't stay
Drop dead in place, you can forget it
Carry a torch for days
I'm gonna let it burn

I remember watching as you slowly loaded up the loom
On repeat: Caravan and we danced around the room
Once insecure about your scar but I think you got over it. (So right)

Dreamt of marimbas made from the bones of our relatives
Who never live as long as we think that they oughta live
You dreamt of sex with tigers
I tried to get my head around that one! (So right)

Left in a disguise for the faraway
Traveled all alone through boring meadows
While I sat at home
Wishing we could elope..

Will you ever know what you do to me?
I'm on my broken knees, no end of sorrow
Sorry if it's twee but it's tomorrow's hope

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

Wanna die, wanna die, I wanna die, wanna die...
I wanna die, I wanna die, I wanna die, wanna die, wanna die, I wanna die, I wanna die...

Think I wanna die if you don't stay
Drop dead in place, you can forget it
Carry a torch for days
I'm gonna let it burn

Will you ever know what you do to me?
I'm on my broken knees, no end of sorrow
Sorry if it's twee but it's tomorrow's hope
