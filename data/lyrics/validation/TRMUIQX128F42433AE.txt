Play! To the lord
Die! Pray and feel my sword
Jesus died for all our sins
Still you don't believe in God
Intolerant as I am
I will no accept your ways
In the name of our lord's son
I will get my holy gun
Breathe! Your last breath
Believe! And you will avoid death
I came here to mold your life
So you won't walk out of step
Best to be subservient
Cram the bible down your throat

Hell bent for Jesus - you've been deleted, heathen
Hell bent for Jesus - motherfucker die, motherfucker die
Hell bent for Jesus - come, kiss the bible asshole
Hell bent for Jesus - motherfucker die, motherfucker die

Pray! For your soul
Die! Pump you full of holes
It' si good for our ideals
Now that you're out of the way
Spread our word to all the rest
Killing in the name of god
In the name of our lord's son
I will get my holy gun
Love! Love the lord
Die! Love or feel my sword
Searching for the promised land
We burn "witches" every night
On a quest with holy might
The pope finances our fight

Hell bent for Jesus - you've been deleted, heathen
Hell bent for Jesus - motherfucker die, motherfucker die
Hell bent for Jesus - come, kiss the bible asshole
Hell bent for Jesus - motherfucker die, motherfucker die

Play! To the lord
Die! Pray and feel my sword
Jesus died for all our sins
Still you don't believe in God
Intolerant as I am
I will no accept your ways
In the name of our lord's son
I will get my holy gun

Hell bent for Jesus - you've been deleted, heathen
Hell bent for Jesus - motherfucker die, motherfucker die
Hell bent for Jesus - come, kiss the bible asshole
Hell bent for Jesus - motherfucker die, motherfucker die
Hell bent for Jesus - you've been deleted, heathen
Hell bent for Jesus - motherfucker die, motherfucker die
Hell bent for Jesus - come, kiss the bible asshole
Hell bent for Jesus - motherfucker die, motherfucker die
