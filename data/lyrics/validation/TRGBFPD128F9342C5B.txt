Late, I can stay up late
In and out of bed
Cleaning up the mess
Trying to be honest
'Cause I know I am on it
This is the last time I speak of it
The loyalties that have been broken
Mine isn't dead
No one is true
Nothing is sacred
When everyone's talking
And nobody's listening
When we confide in all those friends
They're just messengers
One thing is true
You throw the matter into blue skies turning to grey
If that's what you choose
My friend, there's nothing I can say
One thing that's free
I confide in you with the truth
Late, I can stay up late
In and out of bed
Cleaning up the mess
Inside my head
