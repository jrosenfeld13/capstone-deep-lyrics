Light years will burn 'fore I return
I left it all behind with no concern
For things back then can't be again
Forever trapped in time that never bends

She waits for signals I might send
But they don't come so she pretends
I ran away but I'll be back yesterday

No turning back
Once you're lost you never will be found
No gravity
Never get my feet back on the ground

Love and escape do not compute
I see the photograph before you shoot

I'm standing still but still I'm spinning
This journey ends at the beginning
It seals my fate in the great figure eight

No turning back
Once you're lost you never will be found
No gravity
Never get my feet back on the ground

No turning back
Once you're lost you never will be found
No gravity
Never get these feet back on good ground

No turning back
Once you're lost you never will be found
No gravity
Never get my feet back on the ground

Whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh
