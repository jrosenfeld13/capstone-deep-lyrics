Hey, you think you know me, but you don't
No, you don't
Why do you say you care for me, but you won't?
No you won't

How can it hurt your heart when you can't even see it?
I don't bother, but I just wanted to point it out to you
You worry too much
What do you mean?
It means nothing, it never was 'cause I told you so
I told you so. I told you so

You don't try at all, no you won't
No you won't
Why do you say you help me, but you can't?
Just go away

You're not listening to me, and if you are, you're not talking 'till I'm done talking
Suck it up
Eat it up
Fucking so hungry and you know I have to take it and you don't
'Cause you know I'd die to take it, and you don't

You want to pillow talk, but you don't
You just walk away
And you don't need it like I do, of course you don't

(Come on top?) I'm talking into my pillow and you're not really there
Just waiting for the fuck, waiting, wanting for the fuck
And you don't need it, you just want it, you don't need it like I need it
Like I think I need it

You think you know me, but you don't
No you don't
You've got me like a Scorpio
But you don't know
No you don't know
No you don't
