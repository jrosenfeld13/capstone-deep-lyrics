You're a difficult man and I don't understand things you do
I've been around, read all the signs I see in you
You've been running, dare me to follow but I won't go
There's a place in you somewhere I knew all along, now everyone knows

I don't know why you lie
It makes no difference to me
You're just wasting your time
You don't even know me

I don't care that you care
(No and) I don't dare what you dare
I don't

Just for a moment try to remember, all the lies
I always knew there's nowhere to hide, the look in your eyes
Now I hated to see you never cared about who you hurt
When it comes down to me there's no way in hell you'll treat me like dirt

I don't know why you lie
It makes no difference to me
You're just wasting your time
You don't even know me

I don't care that you care
(No and) I don't dare what you dare
I don't go where you go
(No and) I don't know
I don't even wanna know
I don't

I don't care that you care
(And) I don't dare what you dare
(And) I don't go where you go
(No and) I don't know what you know
I don't
