From a simple prayer
That began as a whisper in a quiet place
A dream can inspire the world
A voice echo far away

The wind can take our thoughts
From the wasteland where we walk
Into a pure land
As heroes proudly stand
Like a rose among thorns

From a simple act
That began in the corner of an unlit place
A vision embraces the world
A million candles blaze

We rise above ourselves
With a dignity somehow
Reach that Promised Land

As heroes proudly stand
Like a rose that grows
In spite of it all
A simple rose among thorns

In every lifetime we find a heart
That lights a spark in the eyes of the weary
Who can lead me to a greater love
Show there's good in us
