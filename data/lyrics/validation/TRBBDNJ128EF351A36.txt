Love is the gun when you ain't got money
Love is the gun and ain't that funny
Love is the gun, ain't no doubt
Shoot your shot and the light go out
Love is the gun aimed at you

Love is the gun and it's a thriller
Love is the gun and it's a killer
Love is the gun ain't no lie
Pull that trigger and find out why
Love is the gun aimed at you

Love is the gun when your mind's on the run
And the world criticise what you do
Look out momma, my gun's aimed at you

Love is the gun, the gun you fire
Love is the gun, the gun you hire
Love is the gun, set your sight
Shoot your shot and feel alright
Love is the gun aimed at you

Love is the gun, instant pick up
Love is the gun and it's a stick up
Love is the gun, ain't no game
Oh feel that pain
Love is the gun aimed at you
Look out momma, my gun's aimed at you

Love is the gun aimed at you
Love is the gun aimed at you
Aimed at you
