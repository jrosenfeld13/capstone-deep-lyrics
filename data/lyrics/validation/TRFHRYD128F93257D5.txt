[Verse 1]
Its in this wake that I find myself
Losing the will to resume this Hell
When every breath is a dying wish
Its harder to follow the point of this
This broken place that I call my home
Has deepened the sorrow that I have sown
And I cant erase what is in my heart
I want it to finish before it starts

[Pre-Chorus]
My own solution insufficient again
No false illusion, this devouring threat
I break the vessel, giving air to its red
And open my fate to the darkened sky

[Chorus]
Ive been fading away
Ive been waiting on the call to reach my veins
Ready or not
No attention to waste
Every sorrow of the soul will read my name
When I cease to exist

[Verse 2]
So now Ive come to the final sleep
I pray that forgiveness is mine to keep
I know its hard to forget this man
Driving the failure into your hands

[Pre-Chorus]
My own solution insufficient again
No false illusion, this devouring threat
I break the vessel, giving air to its red
And open my fate to the darkened sky

[Chorus] (x3)
Ive been fading away
Ive been waiting on the call to reach my veins
Ready or not
No attention to waste
Every sorrow of the soul will read my name
When I cease to exist
When I cease to exist
