Ohhh
Here it comes
Ohhh
Here it comes
Yeah

Old Mom and Dad
Couldn't believe
They made me so mad
I had to leave here

Ohhh
Here it comes

I went to the man
Took my decree
Said please understand
I've got to be free

Ohhh
Here it comes
Ohhh
Here it comes
Yeah
Ohhh
Here it comes
Ohhh
Here it comes

Lying in bed
Talking to you
The things that you said
Baby, none of it's true

Ohhh
Here it comes
Ohhh
Here it comes
