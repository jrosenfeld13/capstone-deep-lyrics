[Verse:]
We are not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ
For it is God's power of salvation;
To everyone that believes it
To everyone that recieves it
We shall have everlasting life

[Bridge:]
God's word (His word is healing for every nation)
His word (God's word is power unto salvation)
God's word (God's word came all the way from glory)
Set the captives free
Made the blind to see

[Chorus:]
We are not ashamed
We are not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ
For we have everlasting life
