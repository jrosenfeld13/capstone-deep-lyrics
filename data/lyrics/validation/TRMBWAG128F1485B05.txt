[Instrumental]

[Verse]
Don't you pretend that I'm not alive
My bones never ache unless she's nearby
Where is your face in a safe of dead tongues
I can see your reflection in your totem firstborn
I suspect, oooh
You've been carrying a pack of wolves, a pack of wolves, aaah
I regret, oooh
Not killing you while I had the chance, I know I had the chance
I know I had
Maybe I will always haunt you
Mark the somnolence with truth
Better hang your dead palace
Than have a living home to lose
In the river Ganges, God damns my name

[Outro]
Don't let these hands sharpen your eyes (A rasp of tails)
Don't let these hands sharpen your eyes (A rasp of tails)
Don't let these hands sharpen your eyes (A rasp of tails)
Don't let these hands sharpen your eyes (A rasp of tails)
Don't let these hands sharpen your eyes (A rasp of tails)
Don't let these hands sharpen your eyes (A rasp of tails)
Don't let these hands sharpen your eyes (A rasp of tails)
