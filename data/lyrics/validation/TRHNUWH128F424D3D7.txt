The fights they never end
Like the nights they've taken me over
And yeah, I get the fear
But I cannot be bothered

And all this waiting is just hesitating for nothing

And the fault lines and all the conjecture from both sides
Why, oh why, can't we change things?
This is destroying me inside
You know you want to run away

We shared our dreams
And nearly everything in between
I'll never forget those long lost days in a haze
Where we lost ourselves with no apology

And all this waiting is just hesitating for nothing, oh

And the fault lines hung on the wrong side of daylight
Why, oh why, can't we change things?
This is destroying us inside

You know you want to jump into the pit, back to life so sordid
We fell down dead but nobody saw it
I've got twenty faces and I talk in the tongues
I feel like the devil, what does the devil do?

You know you want to run away

And these fault lines and all the conjecture from pilgrims
It slides on the deck but it's all fine
We could hold on for a lifetime

You know you want to run away
