What's the safe word, Michael?

We used to love each other
Like a sister and brother
And it used to be so sweet
Then lovely
But then I discovered your secret
Little cupboard
And the things inside just shocked me
But I learned to like it
And it feels so right
With my feet tied up in the air
Beat me
Rape me
Damage me beyond repair
[2x]

We used to a little bit
And always did a trickle
Until some of it got out of control
It was a slippery slope
And when you started to choke
I said "Hey, this ain't rock and roll"
So we broke up then
At the foot of my bed
With your head tied up in the air
I ate you, I drank you
I damaged you beyond repair
