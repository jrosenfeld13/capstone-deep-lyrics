Spending these lonesome evenings
With nothing to do
But to live in dreams that I make up
All by myself
Dreaming that you're beside me
I picture the prettiest stories
Only to wake up
All by myself
What is the good of me by myself?
Why was I born
Why am I living
What do I get
What am I giving
Why do I want a thing
I daren't hope for
What can I hope for
I wish I knew
Why do I try
To draw you near me
Why do I do I cry
You never hear me
I'm a poor fool
But what can I do
Why was I born
To love you
I'm a poor fool
But what can I do
Why was I born
To love you
