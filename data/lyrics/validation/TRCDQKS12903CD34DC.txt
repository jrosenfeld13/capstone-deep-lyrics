This is the marriage of silence and love
Here is the temple where I come to learn
Here are the eternal little things I always loved
Here are all my tears just waiting for my return

This is the marriage of silence and love
This is the land of the gentle soul
Here sometimes I meet the man who can see what I see
Live what I dream and be the way he seems

And I have no doubt here I fall and rise
Here I can be poor and feel so rich inside
Here I come back to me here I come back to see
What he's doing now, what he's doing now

Oh I believe in the marriage of silence and love
And I still need some patience to grasp it all
I hope I won't forget this feelings fading off in time
Trapped behind my face, burning in my mind

Oh I have no doubt here I become wise
Here I can be poor and feel so rich inside
Here I come back to me here I come back to see
What he's doing now, what he's doing now

Oh at first I've lost my directions
And I was just glad to be alive
But then I had to meet myself and my depression
And I, and I should have swallowed all my pride
And I know it now, yes I know it know
And I want to know him now, cause I want to love him now

Still I have no doubt here I live for now
Here I can be poor and feel so rich inside
Here I come back to me here I come back to see
What he's doing now, what he's doing now

And I want to know him now
