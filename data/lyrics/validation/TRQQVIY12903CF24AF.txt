Down below the voice of treachery
Above the vile acts of cruelty
Beyond the rims of our destiny fallen
A cruce salus

And still there are things I need to say
And all these things I see myself do
Yet in the end there's one truth only

Freedom in its ultimate form
Remove the fetters from your feet
And rise again to breathe the air anew

When body's broken
And when your clothes are torn
Faith when the courage is crawling
And you're left there all alone

Beyond the rims of our destiny fallen
And still there are things I need to say
And all these things I see myself do
Yet in the end there's one truth only

Replace your heart with peace
And love your enemy
For today we walk together on
Towards eternity
