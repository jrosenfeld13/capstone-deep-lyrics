[Solo: Massimiliano]

No longer I stand this sea of light
No longer I stand the gift of god
Screaming, sighing, sighing 
Screaming, crying loud

The old boat sailed out of sight
Taking my feelings off, afar
It leaves me, drying, dry;
It leaves me crying now

[Solo: Carmelo]

No longer I stand these fields of shine
No longer I stand this sea of light
So why not moving to Nostalgiaplatz
Together, forever, together
