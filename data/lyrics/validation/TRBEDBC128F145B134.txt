I spend my money
Then I try in vain
Can't seem to understand you girl
All at once, here it comes again
This time Ive got to pay the price

There we are, and the people come and go
No matter where we stand
Turn around, Ive got the right to know
What have we done

What to do, what to do
Do about love
What to do, what to do
Do about nothing

I paid the piper
Nothing in return
Be careful when you roll the dice
Never judge it, before you read the book
Believe me when I sing this song

There we are, and the people come and go
No matter where we stand
Turn around Ive got the right to know
What have we done

Chorus

What should I say
Ill please you and I must
Make up your mind
Say you will, say you won't, say you will
