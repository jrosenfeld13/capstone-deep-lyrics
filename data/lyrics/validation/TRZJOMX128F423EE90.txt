And you'll have her eyes again soon

It's a glorious day
And my lonely heart is tired again

That's when Paula sparks a little light, in my eye
(Ever since you went away)
That's when Paula sparks a little light, in my eye
(I miss you more every day)
That's when Paula sparks a

Sleep now sweet princess
I'll cheer for you silently and carefully not to disturb
I'll be ready on that evening
When you're starved for my attention
And you'll say, oh, you'll say

And a jealous moon in love, and they are
Starved for our attention"

(I miss you more every day)
That's when Paula sparks a little light, in my eye
(Ever since you went away)
That's when Paula sparks a little light, in my eye
(I miss you more every day)
That's when Paula sparks a

Sleep now moon

That's when Paula sparks a
(Ever since you went away)
That's when Paula sparks a little light, in my eye
(Ever since you went away)
That's when Paula sparks a little light, in my eye
(Ever since you went away)
That's when Paula sparks a
