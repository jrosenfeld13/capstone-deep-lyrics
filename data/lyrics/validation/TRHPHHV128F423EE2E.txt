I hear your sound from the ground
And it feels so good
I see the lights fading
Lets gather the rain
Inside your hood
Now I hear she's got the fever
Oh and I need her, I knew I would
Now I see your stalling
Catch me I'm falling underground

Now I sense the ground is moving
Yet something is proving me wrong I find
I see the colour changing
To follow the range inside your mind
I've tried to please her, maybe I'll weave her a lullaby
The fallen trees are not yet in season
But underground

A giant grain of sand could
Slip through your hand
And you wouldn't know
You fly away, I'm sailing
My heart would be failing without this glow
I wonder if you've seen me
With infinite greenery all around
If I could here you calling
I'd break down the walls that defend her sound
