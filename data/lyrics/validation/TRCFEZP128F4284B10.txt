Grab your partner before you go
Swing 'em around to and fro
Teach em how to doe-si-doe
Last chance for a dance
Grab your partner while you can
Every woman, every man
Show them all that you still can
Last chance for a dance

Last chance for a dance
Last chance for a dance
Last chance for a dance
Last call for alcohol
Now's the time to take the plunge
Andy's doing it on the drums
Quick before they call the nuns
Last chance for a dance
Bobby does it on the bass
Staring out there into space
We all know he's off his face
Last chance for a dance

Last chance for a dance
Last chance for a dance
Last chance for a dance
Last call for alcohol

Tommy does it on the ol' banjo
Fiddler does it with his bow
If you squeeze you'll let him know
Last chance for a dance
Go on give that box a squeeze
Play that thing between your knees
Oh that boy he's such a tease
Last chance for a dance

Last chance for a dance
Last chance for a dance
Last chance for a dance
Last call for alcohol
