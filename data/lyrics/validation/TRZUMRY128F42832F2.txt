Why don't you move? Does something stop you?
And if you say it's because you're cold I won't believe you
Why don't you speak, And talk to me?
And if you never move at all I'll never be free

I have grave desires to do things to you
I want to perform the grave desires out on you

Why don't you move? Does something stop you?
And if you say it's because you're cold I won't believe you

Grave Desires I can not help it Someone get control of me, yeah

Why don't you speak, And talk to me?
And if you never move at all I'll never be free

Grave Desires I can not help it Someone get control of me, yeah

I look into your eyes
They look at me and stare at nothing
Gazing for a while
I couldn't reach you if I tried
Why don't you speak?
I'm sitting, waiting, listening
Why don't you say? What you'd like to or if you approve?

I have grave desires to do things to you
I want to perform the grave desires out on you
Why don't you move? Is there something wrong?
Why won't you even move your eyeballs?

Grave desires Tell me if you're in the room or If you've left your body
