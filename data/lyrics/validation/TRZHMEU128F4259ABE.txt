[Intro]
Turn the music up
Turn the music up

[Verse]
Move it move it, baby
Can't you see I'm ready to dance?
And I can't stop this rhythm in my heart
Move it move it baby
Can't you see I'm ready to dance?
Without this beat my life would fall apart

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Shuffle on your feet 'til the floor is hot
Gonna make a lot of money, gonna break your heart
Watch out boy
(Watch out boy)
Shuffle on your feet 'til the floor is hot
Gonna make a lot of money gonna break your heart
But I'm the only one with a key
(And that's me)

[Chorus]
Sometimes
You wake up in the morning with a bass line
A ray of sunshine
Sometimes
You know today you're gonna have a good time
And you're ready to go
Sometimes
You wake up in the morning with a bass line
A ray of sunshine
Sometimes
You know today you're gonna have a good time
And you're ready to go

[Verse]
Move it move it baby
Can't you see I'm ready to dance?
And I can't stop this rhythm in my heart
Move it move it baby
Can't you see I'm ready to dance?
Without this beat my life would fall apart

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Shuffle to the beat gonna take a cut
There's money in your feet gimme what you got
Watch out boy
(Watch out boy)
Shuffle to the beat gonna take a cut
There's money in your feet gonna stitch you up
Any other boy that you see
(But not me)

[Chorus]
Sometimes
You wake up in the morning with a bass line
A ray of sunshine
Sometimes
You know today you're gonna have a good time
And you're ready to go
Sometimes
You wake up in the morning with a bass line
A ray of sunshine
Sometimes
You know today you're gonna have a good time
And you're ready to go

[Bridge]
Turn the music up
Turn the music up, turn it up
Because it's all I've, all I've got
It's all I've got
All that I've got
All that I've got

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Shuffle on your feet till the floor is hot
Gonna make a lot of money gonna break your heart
Shuffle on your feet till the floor is hot
Gonna make a lot of money gimme what you've got
You'll never get the best of me you see

[Chorus]
Sometimes
You wake up in the morning with a bass line
A ray of sunshine
Sometimes
You know today you're gonna have a good time
And you're ready to go
Sometimes
You wake up in the morning with a bass line
A ray of sunshine
Sometimes
You know today you're gonna have a good time
And you're ready to go
Sometimes
You wake up in the morning with a bass line
A ray of sunshine
Sometimes
You know today you're gonna have a good time
And you're ready to go
Sometimes
You wake up in the morning with a bass line
A ray of sunshine
Sometimes
You know today you're gonna have a good time
And you're ready to go
