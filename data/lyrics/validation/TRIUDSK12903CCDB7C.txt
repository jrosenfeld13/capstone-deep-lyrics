(Everywhere you go)

Everywhere you go sunshine follows you
Everywhere you go skies are always blue
Children love you, they seem to know
You bring the roses out of the snow
The whole world says hello
Everywhere you go

--- Instrumental ---

(Everywhere you, everywhere you go)
Sunshine follows you
(Everywhere you, everywhere you go)
The skies are always blue
Children love you, they seem to know
You bring the roses out of the snow
And the whole world says hello there
Everywhere you go...
