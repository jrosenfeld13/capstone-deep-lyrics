Two A.M. in the downtown street, there on a corner two strangers meet
In the night
And then until the daybreak, they're gonna love or then before light
A heart will break, there in the night

Look in the alley, along the road, there the losers stand
There in the rain they bide their time, hustling what they can
They bet just to get that bottle in their hand

There in the night, somewhere in the night
Oh, they do what they do, just to get through, there in the night

And on a street in the heart of town, the lady in black she turns around
In the night, yeah
She stares at the man in the Cadillac, he drives by but he'll be back, yeah
Before the light, there in the night

See the guy along the road, who can he be
Wait awhile he'll turn around, see the man is me
'Cos when I sleep I dream, dreams won't set me free

There in the night, somewhere in the night, yeah
Oh, we do what we do, just to get through, there in the night

When the sun goes down, there the night will wait
Then slowly move for the kill
If you would come back again, it would take away this pain
But I don't know if you ever will

There in the night, somewhere in the night
Oh, there in the night, somewhere in the night, yeah

(Solo)

Oh, there in the night, somewhere in the night
Oh, there in the night, somewhere in the night
