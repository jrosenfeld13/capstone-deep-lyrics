Walking all night just to get my money
The boys can't win and they don't think it's funny
Walking all night just to get to the city
Walking on the autobahn (x4)
A change of pace and a change of scenery
The petrol in the air starts to make me dizzy
I hitched a ride with bobby in his lorry
And the man in the black said he's gonna make me sorry
Walking on the autobahn (x4)
Walking on the autobahn (x6)
