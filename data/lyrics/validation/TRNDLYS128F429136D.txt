Feeling in love, I want to testify
Little time it will take me
Feeling in love, I'm so satisfied
From the love that you gave me
The way you make my day
The things you do and say

Feeling in love, I'm so satisfied
From the love that you gave me
Feeling in love, I have no alibis
No kitschy lines to say
Only the truth, never no lies
Feeling in love today

You make all so light
You make everything all right
For your love, I'm so satisfied
Feeling in love today
To my life, you bring love
You're a saint, I know

You give to me love and joy
From here it seems to flow
For the times you were there
When no-one else seemed to care
For your love, I'm so satisfied
Feeling in love today

There is nothing to compare
You always seem to share
For your love, I'm so satisfied
Feeling in love today
Feeling in love today
Feeling in love today
Feeling in love today
