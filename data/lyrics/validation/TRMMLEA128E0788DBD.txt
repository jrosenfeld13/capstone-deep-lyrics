[Verse 1]
You wrap your arms around
A feeling that surrounds
Like liquid peppermint
Just taste the dreams that she sent

[Chorus 1]
And this feeling shivers down your spine
Love comes in colors I can't deny
All that matters is love, love, your love

[Verse 2]
You're sleeping in your bed
Just rest your weary head
Maybe you shouldn't care
Throw away those dreams and dares

[Chorus 2]
And I wonder if it matters to me
Love comes in colors I can't deny
All that shimmers is love, love, your love
Your love
Your love
