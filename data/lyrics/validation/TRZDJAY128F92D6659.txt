I've been down, down so long
But those days are gone now
I've got the will, I've earned the right
To show you it's my time tonight

It's my time, it's my time
My moment, I'm not gonna let go of it
My time, it's my time and I'll stand proud

There's nothing I'm afraid of
I'll show you what I'm made of
Show you all it's my time now

I'll break through, I've made my move
And my faith is strong now
I've got the heart to reach the heights
To show you it's my time tonight

It's my time, it's my time
My moment, I'm not gonna let go of it
My time, it's my time and I'll stand proud

There's nothing I'm afraid of
I'll show you what I'm made of
Show you all it's my time now

I've got the will, I've earned the right
Tonight, tonight

It's my time, it's my time
My moment, I'm not gonna let go of it
My time, it's my time and I'll stand proud

There's nothing I'm afraid of
I'll show you what I'm made of
Show you all it's my time now, now
Show you all it's my time now
