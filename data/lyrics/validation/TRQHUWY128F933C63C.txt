I fear a world without the sun
The day the sun never rose, cold swept the world
And now stone and ice, the children she forms
I lift my eyes to take in horizons of skin

The cold is creeping to meet with wrath above
And you'll soon be fearing to see what it kept us away from
I fear a world without the sun
I fear a world without the sun, but never who wished it gone

The trees are dead, yet alive more than ever
Growing flesh where once were leaves
They stretch instead of tower, like bone wrapped giants they reach
Oh, but nothing stirs like the fire's thunder

The cold is creeping to meet with wrath above
And you'll soon be fearing to see what it kept us away from
I fear a world without the sun
I fear a world without the sun, but never who wished it gone

And now the ground pulses, constricting for birth
