The empty page before me now, the pen is in my hand
The words don't come so easy but I'm trying
I'm searching for a melody or some forgotten line
They can slip away from us so quickly
Don't be unkind I'm not complaining
I only feel it needs explaining

(Chorus)
Though I've said it all before I'll say it once again (one more time)
Everyone needs something to believe in

So turn around, turn around it's on the other side
Feel the sound, feel the sound, it's coming from deep inside
It will fill you with emotion, if you let it be your guide so
Turn around; turn around, it's on the other side

I'm waiting for the day to end another to begin
Somehow I've forgotten what it stood for
I look into your face and see the searching in your eyes
I will he your servant till the end
The music plays, and for a moment I feel
That all there days an so fulfilling

(Chorus)
Desperation shows its ugly face in many ways
No one can escape the times we live in
The answers are so simple and we all know where to look
But it's easier to just avoid the question
And if I seem too inconclusive
It's just because it's so elusive

(Chorus)
