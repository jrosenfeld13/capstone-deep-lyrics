She's got me walking, got me talking
Talking to myself. And I've got no money
Got no honey, trouble is all I have

It happened just the other night
I had been out drinking and I was
Feeling fine, but when I got home
She was at the door, she had fire
In her eyes
So I tried to keep my cool, wasn't
Much more that I could do
Then she let me have it right between
The eyes and I knew our love was thru

She's got me walking, got me talking
Talking to myself. And I've got no money
Got no honey, trouble is all I have

Now what is a man to do
When a woman wants it all from you
Says if you want to be my man
Better quit that band and stop
Acting like a fool

She's got me walking, got me talking
Talking to myself. And I've got no money
Got no honey, trouble is all I have
