Red laces, white braces
On daytime talk shows, evening news
And public places

When you're in numbers you've got so much to say
Always hate on your faces, want to hurt other races

That ain't skinhead

Hey new-jack boot, stop preaching "White Power,"
If you wabt to be skinhead you better learn your roots

'Cause you're no skinhead, you little faker

When you're alone in your mom & pops home
Nazi flag over your bed, wishing us dead

That ain't skinhead
