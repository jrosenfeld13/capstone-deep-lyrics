Memories of the times you had That's the way you see yourself You fight for your rights You fight to survive You come into this world With nothing except yourself You, you leave this world With nothing except yourself Do what you want And how you want it Feel it's right, go out and do it Think for yourself and think for the best Or you'll go down just like the rest You come into this world With nothing except yourself You, you leave this world With nothing except yourself
