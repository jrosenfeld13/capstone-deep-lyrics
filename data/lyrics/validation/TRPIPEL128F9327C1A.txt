'm inside
Distant words stain my ground
Leaving hope far behind
The walls are building higher
My defense is all that you will see

Last call for the damned
Hear me
Cursed will be the land
We seek

I'm outside
Looking in through your eyes
All this seems so far behind
I'm outside myself

Last call for the damned
Hear me
Cursed will be the land
We seek

Last call for the damned
Hear me
Cursed will be the land
We seek
