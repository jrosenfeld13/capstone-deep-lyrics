Knife cuts through internal organs
Axe ambedded in your sternum
Ice pick puncturing your eyeballs
Hammer cracking open your skull

Skin is peeled and stripped off the bone
Vocal cords are torn from your throat
Arms and legs are broken and shattered
Skull is popped and brains are splattered

Teeth bashed in and mouth is broken
Blood is spraying all directions
Mangled, mauled and mutilated
Broken body lying in death
