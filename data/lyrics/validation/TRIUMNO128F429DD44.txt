What you spoke in a whisper I
Said more with my silence if
You degenerate into this
Hole that you dug yourself
Felt no fear as to thinking that
The words to describe would just come to me
To break this mold that you set yourself
You will wither slowly
I find no faith in god helps
I moved away from all safe things
For trust that's lost is all forgiven
Yet tears that flow have no meaning
What you said in a whisper I
Said more with my silence if
You degenerate into this
Hole that you dug yourself
Felt no fear as to thinking that
The words to describe would just come to me
To break this mold that you set yourself
You will wither slowly
