Somewhere there should be
For all the world to see
A statue of a fool made of stone
The image of a man
Who let love slip through his hands
And then just let him stand there all alone

And there on his face
A gold tear should be placed
To honor the million tears he's cried
And the hurt in his eyes would show
So everyone would know
That concealed is a broken heart inside

So build me a statue and, Lord, build it high
So that all can see
Then inscribe "the world's greatest fool"
And name it after me
After me
