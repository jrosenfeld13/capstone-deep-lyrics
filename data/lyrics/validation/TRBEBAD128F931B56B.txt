I hate you and you hate me
What a darkest fantasy

Maybe you don't want the truth
I tried, I tried, I tried but I can't live without you
It's making me blue
I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried to give my heart to you
Everything I have to give I give it to you
And I need you
Take it, don't you fake it, cuz I'll break you

Garden of Eden, take a bite
Do me evil all damn night
Sinful thoughts run through your brain
Lustful desire drive you insane

Maybe you don't want the truth
I tried, I tried, I tried but I can't live without you
It's making me blue
I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried to give my heart to you
Everything I have to give I give it to you
And I need you
Take it, don't you fake it, cuz I'll break you

Hate me

What a darkest fantasy
