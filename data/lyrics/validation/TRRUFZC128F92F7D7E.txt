I wooed her with a four letter word after trying too hard to be deep
I promised her uncountable things that were impossible to keep
Everywhere I seem to turn I'm letting someone down
Either my friends, my enemies, their wives or the crown

Slow
I'm getting slow
Did I make one false move that made her go?
What made her go?
Did I make one false move too soon?

She was blessed with second sight but didn't have a licence
"She never loved me illegally" I said in her defence
"I can see the future judge!" She said in tears
"Well I can see yours", he said, "you'll be in jail for the next ten years"

Slow
I'm getting slow
Did I make one false move that made her go?
What made her go?
Did I make one false move too soon?

We settled things with a golden handshake
The law decreet it was best
She was crying when she gave me five grand
I said, "And the rest!"

Slow
I'm getting slow
Did I make one false move that made her go?
Where did she go?
Did I make one false move too soon?

Slow
I'm getting slow
Did I make one false move that made her go?
What made her go?
Did I make one false move too soon?
