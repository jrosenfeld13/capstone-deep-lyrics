Doing the mess around
Push me down into the ground
Taste the hands that drink my body

Fight me in the dark
Wrestle your bones over mine
Into our moonless march come the wizard

Come, the wizard comes
The wizard comes
The wizard comes
The wizard comes

Wants to feel you shake and shooting
He will be our leader
Wants to feel you shake and shooting
He will be our leader

Trembling midnight lands
I travel with the wizard
Drink his blood and he's our leader

Breath songs in my head
Slow arrow flies, are burning
And the trouble we possess
While the sunshine goes on sleeping
The sunshine

Wants to feel you shake and shooting
He will be our leader
Wants to feel you shake and shooting
He will be our leader

Wants to feel you shake and shooting
He will be our leader
Wants to feel you shake and shooting
He will be our leader
