Staring into nothing
Questioning what is real
We don't share the same reality

Personal perception
Life's your own creation
What you see now is really what you believe

Lost beneath the silent sky
Yearning to know the reasons why

Want to know what's out there
Want to be made aware
Of what we cannot see but feel

Where does it begin
And where does it end
I want to venture out beyond what is known

Lost beneath the silent sky
Yearning to know the reasons why
Lost beneath the silent sky
Yearning to know the reasons why
