Some summers, some summers
Some summers, some summers
Some summers, some summers
Some summers, some summers
Some summers, some summers got grace
Some summers are all over the place. Oh god!

They started talking on the slow songs where the couples pair up
Those style of shows, they get so intimate
She felt faint, then made an escape
He swears it's an act, but she'd never admit to that

Her sleeve was tied so they never swapped numbers
They kept falling together like...
Fall into cubicles, fall into bad habits
The summer of bands, would've thought they were lovers

(?) map, the more you lack
I cared about my evenings back
You get a place that's separate to me
Days and days right down on yr knees
Heart strings will pull nostalgia
But honestly it feels like summer

Sitting right here is the boy who'll never drink again
She is the girl who hasn't been drunk at all
They've had all those university lovers
But nothing compares to the sound of the summer

They'd never. Since college. Stumbled upon it
The secret of knowledge. It's honest

She stole a poster every time they went back
A summer of bands that he knew were the soundtrack

(?) map, the more you lack
I cared about my evenings back
You get a place that's separate to me
Days and days right down on yr knees
Heart strings will pull nostalgia
But honestly it feels like...

Some summers, some summers
Some summers, some summers
Some summers, some summers
Some summers, some summers
Some summers, some summers got Grace
Some summers will only replace our god

(?) map, the more you lack
I cared about my evenings back
You get a place that's separate to me
Days and days right down on yr knees
Heart strings will pull nostalgia
But honestly it feels like summer...
