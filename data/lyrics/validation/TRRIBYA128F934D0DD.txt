Quit hanging over me
Look at the hair on the back of my neck
Standing up on the rooftops
Remembering everything she said

Swim to reach the end
But I am steady not to offend
On whom can you depend?
Swim to reach the end

Swim to reach the end
Swim to reach the end
Swim to reach the end
Swim to reach the end

Lucid afternoon dream
Cosmopolitan scene
Look at what's in store for me
Heads will turn in disbelief

Relish in your energy
That's the line of symmetry
Relish in your energy
That's the line of symmetry

Swim to reach the end
But I am steady not to offend
On whom can you depend?
Swim to reach the end

Swim to reach the end
Swim to reach the end
Swim to reach the end
Swim to reach the end
