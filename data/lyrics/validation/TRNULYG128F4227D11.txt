I think my girl is on heat
Everytime I come in she just falls down on my feet
I keep recognising strangers in the street
And they're all from the same tree
Turning like leaves in the street
Always me but I never know
Commitment bells are ringing below
I don't think I'll be coming down here for weeks

I think my girl is unseen
Everytime I get up, she just falls down on my feet
Always me but I never know
Commitment bells are ringing below
I don't think I'll be coming down here for weeks
(For weeks)
I don't think I'll be coming down here for weeks
(For weeks)
I don't think I'll be coming down here for weeks

Always me but I never know
Commitment bells are ringing below
I don't think I'll be coming down here for weeks
(Ohh weeks)
Always me but I never know
Commitment bells are ringing below
I don't think I'll be coming down here for weeks
(Ohh weeks)
I don't think I'll be coming down here for weeks
(Ohh weeks)
I don't think I'll be coming down here for weeks
