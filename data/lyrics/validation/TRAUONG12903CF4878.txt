I'm wondering
Will I ever see you again

Morning comes
And you're not here, my dear
Then my teardrops fall
'Cause I called and searched everywhere

Girl, you're gone (Gone)
I admit it, I was wrong
You said you understood
Now suddenly I'm all alone

You're my world, girl (Baby, baby, baby)
Please come back to me
You're my world, girl (Baby)
We're two of a kind (Tick-tock)

Through my tear-filled eyes, girl
I stare at the clock (Tick-tock)
Wondering am I waiting here in vain (Vain)

Have you suddenly changed you mind
Or have you found somebody new
And decided to leave me behind

You're my world, girl (Woooohooh)
Please come back to me
You're my world, girl (Baby)
We're two of a kind

Girl, never
No, never, ever will I make you cry again
I know you think that I'm just lyin' again

(Let me tell you you're wrong)
Baby, baby, let me tell you
(Let me tell you you're wrong)
Hoo (You're wrong) hoo
(A great lesson I've learned) Yeah
You never hurt the one you love

You're my world, girl (I'm down on my knees)
Please come back to me
You're my world, girl
We're two of a kind (And, oh)

You're my world, girl (Ho)
Please come back to me
You're my world, girl (You're my everything, baby)
We're two of a kind

You're my world, girl (And I need you, girl)
Please come back to me
You're my world, girl (Oh, yes, you are, baby)
We're two of a kind (Oh, girl, when you went away)

You're my world, girl (And took my sunshine)
Please come back to me
You're my world, girl
