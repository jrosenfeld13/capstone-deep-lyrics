Gotta know the answer, gotta know the truth, gotta have a feeling when I
Look at you. Cause I know my reasons and I know the facts, I try to be
Wide open so I can fight back
What you see in me never makes me sad, what I see in you only makes me mad !
Feel me as I expose myself and all I know... Feel me as I expose myself as I explode...
Gotta show emotions,gotta leave your shell, gotta find solutions deep inside yourself, 'cause you'll find the reasons and you'll know the facts, gotta be wide open so
You can fight back
What you see in me never makes me sad, what I see in you never makes me mad!
Don't you know, that there's a time and there's a space for everyone
See me as I explode!!!
