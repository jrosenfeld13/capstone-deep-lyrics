You've got it written on your face
And in the scars on your hands from all that
You could feel for a while
There was nothing worth knowing that couldn't be
Be hidden or stolen
Anyway I got to be going
You better too

We shall bend in the wind
Like reeds knowing greedy get nothing
So dressed for the occasion
This is an invitation

Every time you, you walk the streets you
You feel the sound of every punk's heartbeat
And every time the cops drive by
We smile and smile and smile and smile

Spending like a punk rocker on payday
At the monster dogs' Christmas parade
Me and The Mad Monkettes we stop and wave

Here's your conscience just in case you don't have one
Rod Serling said, he said, "Gin and tonics all night long"
Let's stop and wave

Spending like a punk rocker on payday
At the Village Halloween parade
Me and The Mad Monkettes we carry the day
Walking across that Williamsburg bridge, sir
Edward r. Murrow said, he said
"This neighborhood's gone to the dogs"
Just stop and wave

Broke as I'll be on Monday
Going out in the woods today
Me and The Mad Monkettes we lose our way
"Do you think these bruises are sexy?"
Rasputina said, she said
And it was like the beginning and end credits
All at one goddamn time

The night is never too long Not for me anyway
How is it for you so far away?
How did you get so far away?

Aging like a movie star's heyday
Hemorrhaging money I make my way
Me and The Mad Monkettes
I ain't got a regret And I can't forget it at all
