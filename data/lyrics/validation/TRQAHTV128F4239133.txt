You know how to turn me on
Oh you got it going on
Baby you can make my day
Come on, get down with me
We can dance the night away
Baby, you can make my day
Nothing's going to stop us now
We can get down anyhow
Come on, baby make my day
Come on, come on put the radio on
Turn it up; the neighbour's gone
You can make my day
You know how to turn me on, oh you got it going on
Baby you can make my day
Come on, come on, put the radio on
Turn it up; the neighbour's gone
You can make my day
Come on, come on put the radio on
Turn it up; the neighbour's gone
You can make my day!
