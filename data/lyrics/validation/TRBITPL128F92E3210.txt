Such a night
It was a night, ooo what a night it was
It really was, such a night
The moon was bright ooo how bright it was
It really was, such a night
The night was alive with stars above
And when she kissed me I had to fall in love
It was a kiss mmmm what a kiss it was
It really was, such a kiss
How she could kiss ooo what a kiss it was
It really was, such a kiss
Just part of her lips that sets me on fire
I reminisce and I feel desire
I'd give my heart to her in sweet surrender
How well I remember , I'll always remember
Ooo that night, ooo what a night it was
It really was, such a night
Came the dawn and my heart and my love and the night was gone
But I'll never forget that kiss in the moonlight
Ooo such a kiss, ooo such a night
Now she's gone, gone gone
Yes she's gone, gone gone
Came the dawn, dawn dawn
And the night was gone
And my heart was gone
And her love was gone
But before the dawn oo oo oo oo such a night
