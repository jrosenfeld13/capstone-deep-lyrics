Oh, my head hurts
Shut the sun out
Give me some rough
Give me some rough love

And an answer
Far away, under me
Get the sun out
And ignore me

Talk in a groove
Whisper a name
Anything, anything
And make me tremble

Float in the air
In the big wheel
Over and over and

All you have to do
Is show me the real you
And give me back my way
And show me another day

Take a chance
Watch and wait
Put your lips
Put your lips to my heart

And lean into me
Not enough
Make it happen
Don't disappoint me

Feel the heat
Making my eyes shine
Anyway, anyway
I'm floating backwards

Leap into hell
Into the crush, crush
Over and over and now

All you have to do
Is show me the real you
And all you have to say
Is love me like you want me to

And all you have to do
Is show me another way
And give it back to you
And love you like you want me to

Shut the sun out
Give me the love that I need
Shut the sun out
And give me the love that I need

Give me the love that I need
Shut the sun out
Give me the love that I need

Give me the love that I need
Give me the love that I need
