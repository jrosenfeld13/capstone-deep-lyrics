[Chorus]
The day the world gets around
To understanding where it is
Using all it's found
To help each other, hand in hand

[Chorus]
The day the world gets around
To understanding where it's gone
Losing so much ground
Killing each other, hand in hand
Such foolishness in man
I want no part of their plan - oh no

[Verse 1]
If you're the destructive kind
Now I'm working from day to day
As I don't want to be like you
I look for the pure of heart
And the ones that have made a start
But lord, there are just a few
Who bow before you
In silence they pray
Oh how they pray for the day the
World gets around
Using all they've found
To help each other, hand in hand

[Outro]
The day the world gets around
