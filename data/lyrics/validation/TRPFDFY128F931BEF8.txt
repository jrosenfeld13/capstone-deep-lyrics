God damn it man i almost had it
Stuck in the sewer beneath all the maggots
I ain't foolin' I've been pursuing a way to get out of these dirty old ruins

I'm checkin' out i'm never comin' back again
I'm checkin' out I'm listed M.I.A

God damn it man i almost had it
Threw me out the door and called me a faggot
I ain't done, i've only yet begun
West Oakland is the place where i'm comin' from

I'm checkin' out i'm never comin' back again
I'm checkin' out I'm listed M.I.A

God damn it
Man i almost had it
Well i did it again yeah i do it outta habit
Well i'm numb, it ain't no fun, i'm less than zero when you add up the sum

I'm checkin' out yeah
It ain't no doubt yeah
A courtship built from anger is what it amounts
I almost had it I came so close man i almost had it i almost had it

I'm checkin' out i'm never comin' back again
I'm checkin' out I'm listed M.I.A
