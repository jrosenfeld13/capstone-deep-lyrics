Tiny angels - Christmas angels try to sleep
Don't let Santa hear the sounds of little feet
Now its time to close your eyes and drift away
Until you wake tomorrow and its Christmas day

Tiny angels - I have heard you every night
Whispering with bright eyes shining in the light
Daddy, when is it Christmas - will it soon be here?
Well my darlings, it's very, very near

As near as you my angels - since you came to me
Now Christmas day and every day is the same to me
The only gifts that I could want are you, my darlings

Tiny angels - Christmas angels sleeping tight
May Santa bring you all the gifts you want tonight?
And some day when you have tiny angels too
I hope you find the joy I found in you

You changed the world, my angels - when you came to me
Now Christmas day and every day is the same to me
The only gifts that I could want are you

Tiny angels - Christmas angels try to sleep
Don't let Santa hear the sounds of little feet
Now its time to close your eyes and drift away
Until you wake tomorrow and its Christmas day

Chor:
Christmas bells are ringing
Christmas is here again
Excited people opening presents
Christmas is here again
Bright shiny Christmas trees
Small children on there knees. . .
