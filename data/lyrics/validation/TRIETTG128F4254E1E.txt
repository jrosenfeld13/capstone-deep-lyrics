Brand new mama, I understand
It's hard as hell being a young mother and
You need support your conscious told you not to abort
So to your child you're a hero of some sort
But, hey, the worst is over
You're ready to do this
I got faith and your baby renewed this
Faith that everything will be fine
Now an adult, no more youth time
[Anytime you need help sister]
We'll be there just give us a ring
We will help you raise that king
Word to the mother cause it's a black thing
I respect you in a strong way
Super late nights cause your baby slept all day
But mama don't sleep, your life's a turning page

[Hook:]
Mama's always on stage (4x)

Hey, let me guess, you're bored
Wanna get loose, attack the dance floor
Cool, I'll hold her, you have a good time
I'll keep your baby awake so baby sleeps after nine
This is reality, we need to turn our minds
Brothers talking revolution but leave their babies behind
Well sister, he's a sucker, just leave'em be
The revolution is now up to brothers like me
To step in cause your man stepped out
[The goal:] To raise the children, no doubt
So let's go to it and possibly
Bring a generation of nat's in the future, see
I respect you in a strong way
Super late nights cause your baby slept all day
But mama don't sleep, your life's a turning page
Mama's always on stage
Keep up your strength now cause we must grow somehow
Baby, mama is always on staaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaage!

[Hook:]
Mama's always on stage (4x)
Can't be a revolution without women
Can't be a revolution without children

I improved throughout my life
All of this just to soothe a wife
Brothers wear your black clothes
Talk your 5% talk
Words of wisdom should be ways of wisdom
That's exactly how you must walk
Life's too short, your mission's too dire
Nurture another mind before yours expires
Pass it on, push it along
Like the brother said it in that one song
We respect you all the way
Late, late nights cause your baby slept all day
But mama's got to stay strong, carry it on
Hey, mama's on stage

[Hook:]
Mama's always on stage
