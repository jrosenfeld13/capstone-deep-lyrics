Mmmm, mmm-hmmm
Have you ever felt the presence of a brain?
We have all seen them standing
Amidst the surprise
Sometimes a man smiles
At what, I often wonder
You can tell he's a thinker
By the far away look in his eyes
The far away look in his eyes

A penny for his thoughts can make you richer
His eyes can see what other eyes could not
What is the power of Napoleon
But not mere power, but magnetism
And magnetism is more intelligent than force
Magnetism is more intelligent than force

A duba diba diba duba duba
Bump bump da day ooh ow

Have you ever felt the presence of a brain?
We have all seen them standing
Amidst the surprise
Sometimes a man smiles
At what, I often wonder
But you can tell he's a thinker
By the far away look in his eyes
The far away look in his eyes

When god's children start thinking together
Learning to live and love one another, hey, hey, hey
