You caught me, caught me, love dancing
Sound now, seek and you will find (x3)

Say friends catch the wave, catch the love wave
Give it up, catch the wave, catch the love wave

You caught me, caught me, love dancing
Sound now, seek and you will find (x4)

Say friends catch the wave, catch the love wave
Give it up, catch the wave, catch the love wave

Is it all over my face?
You caught me love dancing
Is it all over my face?
I'm in love dancing
It's bringin' out the sane
Said one nine one seven
