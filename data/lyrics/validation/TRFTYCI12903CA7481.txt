So divine, steal my time

Like I'm coming over

It's only a movie

Hit it Jack, break my back

Is the killing over?

It's only a movie

My friend

So feline, lips like wine

Like Casanova

It's only a movie

Hit the sack, what's the crack?

Are you getting closer?

It's only a movie

My friend

My friend is golden

My friend, is golden

She said she's no... she's golden

But here is a song for me

For this movie

My friend, is golden

Let Scorpio, go and

Sting her this morning

To see what he'd bring her

My friend
