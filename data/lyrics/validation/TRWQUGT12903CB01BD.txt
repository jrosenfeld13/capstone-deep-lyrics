Eyes open as the light streams through the curtain
Only half closed and the kink in my neck
And sleeping in my clothes again
Reminds me that I'm not home
Gotta go because were leaving on a fifteen hour drive
But I'll call you sometime soon to let you know that I'm alright

Do you know what the world can bring
I wish you were here with me
To see the things that words cannot describe
Sincerely me so long goodbye

Its three am and were driving through the desert
And the moons bright so bright in fact
That I can almost write you without turning on the map light
But I gotta let you go now because it's my turn to drive
But I'll have so much to tell you at home when we arrive

Do you know what the world can bring
I wish you were here with me
To see the things that words cannot describe
Sincerely me so long goodbye so long goodbye

Do you know what the world can bring
I wish you were here with me
To see the things that words cannot describe
Sincerely me so long goodbye
