Go, no one here is watching
Drink up your pink gin
Find your way out
Cause everyone here talks too loud

Go, don't look where you're going
Run through the puddles
Run through the night
Run like you're strapped with dynamite

But I can see in the dark with my headphones on
And every light is multiplied by each new song
And the crowd looks at me like there is something wrong
I just told them what I saw when I had my headphones on

Tunnel vision is not that bad
If you like what you see
It's a cold steep walk through the parking lot
Of memories and things that couldn't be
Memories and things that couldn't be
Memories and things that couldn't be
Now belong to me

But I can see in the dark with my headphones on
And every light is multiplied by each new song
And the crowd looks at me like there is something wrong
I just told them what I saw when I had my headphones on

If I could save
With each embrace
Then I would save you

But I can see in the dark with my headphones on
And every light is multiplied by each new song
And the crowd looks at me like there is something wrong
I just told them what I saw when I had my headphones on
