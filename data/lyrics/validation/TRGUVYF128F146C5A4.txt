I invested it all, you threw in a dime
It's not good enough, it's not good enough

I ran half marathons, and you ran a mile
It's not good enough, it's not good enough

It's not good enough, it's not good enough
It's not good enough

You gave up on easter, for your vegan chums
It's not good enough, it's not good enough

You gave up on cigars, and still you smoke like a lum
It's not good enough, it's not good enough

I gave up on my liver, trying to keep up
It's not good enough, it's not good enough
I gave up half of my heart, and you gave a half-hearted shrug
It's not good enough, it's not good enough

It's not good enough, it's not good enough x 2

You're not one bit ashamed x 6
Not one bit ashamed x 7
You're not one bit ashamed x 3
Not one bit ashamed
