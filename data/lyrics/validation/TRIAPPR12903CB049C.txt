I've crawled- I've lied
Destroyed myself
I thought being numb was ok
All these fucking drugs- I put in my veins I started to believe
I used to think it was ok to drink myself to death
These pills and booze I swallowed were choking me to death
Suffering made me care- made me want to improve
Set my life straight- I hope you know I'm here for you because it kills to see you drag

I want to choke the life out of you and take your addiction away
These words mean nothing to you
But it's better than you dying in my arms- DYING IN MY ARMS

I used to think it was ok to drink myself to death
These pills and booze I swallowed were choking me to death
I've crawled- I've lied
Destroyed myself
I thought being numb was ok
It's like a fucking gun pointing right at your face ready to take off your head
