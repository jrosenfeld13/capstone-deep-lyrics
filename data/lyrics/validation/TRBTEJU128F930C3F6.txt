[Verse 1]
Dark night nothing to see
Invisible hand in front of me
Scared to death there's someone near
Scared to move but you can't stay here

[Chorus]
You know me, evil eye
You know me, prepare to die
You know me, the snakebite kiss
Devil's grip, the Iron Fist

[Verse 2]
Flying horse don't make a sound
Flying hooves don't touch the ground
Walk in circle lose you track
Can't go on but you can't go back

[Chorus]
You know me, evil eye
You know me, prepare to die
You know me, you can't resist
Devil's grip, the Iron Fist

[Verse 3]
Moon eclipse and you know why
Ghost rider in the sky
Beast of evil devil's hound
Tooth and claw they pull you down

[Chorus]
You know me, evil eye
You know me, prepare to die
You know me, the great white kiss
Devil's grip, the Iron Fist
