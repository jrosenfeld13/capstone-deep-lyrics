Walk on
If you should meet
Walk on
On down the street
Walk on
Don't even look
Walk on
Close up the book

We don't want the world to see us
Like we are
We should never have even gone this far
Quickly brush away that teardrop
Walk away darling
Don't stop
Don't look back for me baby
Walk on

Walk on
Don't turn around
Walk on
To higher ground
Take the love we shared together
Keep it in your heart forever
Don't forget me
Oh baby walk on
If you ever loved me baby
Walk on
