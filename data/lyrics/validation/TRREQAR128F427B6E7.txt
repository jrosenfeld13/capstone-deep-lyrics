I think we've waited
Long enough, baby
You know me
Only too well

I just thought of something I had to mention
So don't be defensive
No, no, don't try to pretend to
Look surprised

Have you ever known me?
Bit too shy to jump in
But when it comes to you
I can't win
'Cause you know me better than I know myself

You know me better than I know myself
You know me the best
You know me better than I know myself
You know what to expect

Understand it
Nobody understands you
The way that I can
Let's see this thing through
One thing remaining
Things will never be the same again
After tonight

So let's get down to it
This thing is getting stronger and stronger
We need to take it further
I can't wait no longer, I waited my turn
I've waited in line

How long have I known you?
Not in all this time been untrue
I think we're more than friends
Let me see this through
You know me better than I know myself

You know me better than I know myself
You know me the best
You know me better than I know myself
You know what to expect

You know me better than I know myself
You know me the best
You know me better than I know myself

How many years can we keep going on this way
Too afraid, too much at stake
Though I believe the friendship can survive
Maybe you want if we do or we don't

You know me better than I know myself
You know me the best
You know me better than I know myself
You know what to expect

You know me better than I know myself
You know me the best
You know me better than I know myself
You know what to expect

You know me better than I know myself
You know me better than I know myself
You know me better than I know myself
You know me better than I know myself
You know what to expect
