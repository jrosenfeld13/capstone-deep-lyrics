How do we deal with this?
How do we clean up all this mess?
Will there be a future for the latest generation?
Running around, believing the sound
Is anything loud enough for us to decipher
Making a stand, extending our hand
We must understand
It's the least we can offer those less fortunate than us

Something bout this place
It brings out all the worst
Our history's been disgraced
Who will destroy you first?

Something bout this place
It brings out all the worst
Our history's been disgraced
Who will destroy you first?

I'm balling up my fists
Waiting here defenseless isn't pacifist
It's ignorant, and cannot be allowed
Maybe it's here or maybe it's there
We're never aware of just how safe we are
Could it be them or could it be us
Unable to trust
The information that we need

Something bout this place
It brings out all the worst
Our history's been disgraced
Who will destroy you first?

Something bout this place
It brings out all the worst
Our history's been disgraced
Who will destroy you first?

(This time, will we all, live on?)
If hurting still exists make it go away
The problems that are plaguing you and I the same
(This time will we all, live on?)
Causing it to stay
Counting down the days
It's eating at the very core of us

Something bout this place
It brings out all the worst
Our history's been disgraced
Who will destroy you first?

Something bout this place
It brings out all the worst
Our history's been disgraced
Who will destroy you first?

There's something wrong with this place
