Time can pass and time can heal
But it don't ever pass the way I feel
You went away a long time ago
And why you left I never knew
The lonely days and lonely nights
Guess the world knows I ain't feelin' right
And when you're gone the hours pass so slow
And now I'm still feeling blue

And baby
Since you've walked out of my life
I never felt so low
Can't help but wonder why you had to go

There are many girls but I can't say
They come and go but still I feel this way
And ever since the day you said goodbye
No one treats me like you used to do

I hope you're out and happy now
Doing up the town cause you know how
Every time I hear your name I want to die
And now I'm still feeling blue

All right

And baby
Since you've walked out of my life
I never felt so low
Can't help but wonder why you had to go

I hope you're out and happy now
Doing up the town cause you know how
Every time I hear your name I want to die
And now I'm still feeling blue
And now I'm still feeling blue
