I'm not going nowhere
I'm staying'baby I'm staying
You know why?
I've got staying power
Baby, I've made plans
In a fancy restaurant where we can dance
Put on my favorite dress
You know the one
That oozes sexiness
Tonight when we make love
I'm going to work your body with my tongue
Ohh baby, my missions clear
There's more than love that keeps you here

I've got staying power
Just when you think it's over
I'll come right back again
I've got staying power
Just when you think it's over
I'll come right back again
I've got staying power
Just when you think it's over

Slow down, don't heat so fast
Anticipation makes a good thing last
Tease me with your emotions
Soon we'll share nature's body lotion
Are you ready to free
Girl you know you got just what I need
Oh baby, my missions clear
It's more than love that keeps you here

I've got staying power
Just when you think it's over
I'll come right back again
I've got staying power
Just when you think it's over
I'll come right back again
I've got staying power
Just when you think it's over

No, no baby I'm not going anywhere
No no no I'm not going anywhere
I'll be here
Ill be here
For years and years

Tonight when we make love
I'm going to work your body with my tongue
Oh baby my missions clear
There's more than love that keeps you here

I've got staying power
Just when you think its over
I'll come right back again
I've got staying power
Just when you think it's over
I'll come right back again
I've got staying power
Just when you think it's over
