[Verse 1]
We could be perfect, one last night
And die like star-crossed lovers when we fight
And we can settle this affair
If you would shed your yellow, take my hand
And then we'll solve the mystery of laceration gravity
This riddle of revenge, please understand it has to be this way

[Chorus]
Stand up, fucking tall
Don't let them see your back
And take my fucking hand
And never be afraid again

[Verse 2]
We've only got one chance to put this at an end
And cross the patron saint of switchblade fights
You said, "We're not celebrities
We spark and fade, they die by threes"
I'll make you understand
And you can trade me for an apparition

[Chorus]
Stand up, fucking tall
Don't let them see your back
And take my fucking hand and never

[Bridge]
Trust, you said
Who put the words in your head?
Oh, how wrong we were to think
That immortality meant never dying

Stand, take my fucking hand
Take my fucking

[Chorus]
Stand up, fucking tall
Don't let them see your back
And take my fucking hand
And never be afraid again

[Outro]
Just because my hand's around your throat!
