Woke up in the morning i drove from lawrence to omaha
Got there kinda early and still i checked out the local bar
Cause bear to go is all new to me
I would have sent you but you're only 19
I'm walking around in someone elses shoes
I guess it's nothing new
I flew around like a butterfly
Walking for miles usually isn't my cup of tea
Iswear to god i could walk these miles between you and me
I'm under a fire ball
And there's a cool, cool breeze
Nothing but a moving yellow line between you and me
I flew around like a butterfly
I found a four leaf clover hidden in someone elses hand
I should have let it be
Left it to the land
But it's cold out side
I don't have a phone i can't find my clothes
But it's alright. here alone
