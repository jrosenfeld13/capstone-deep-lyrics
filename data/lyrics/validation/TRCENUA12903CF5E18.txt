Let me take you down, underneath this false surface
Tonight is the night when we travel into the heart of the unknown
Night reveals what is hidden in the shadows
What you see is just a shell of me

To escape the suffering we keep our emotions at a distance
So far away that our skin becomes our fortress
Leave with me and you'll see what lies ahead
Let's gather in twilight
In those blue reflections

We are coming out as one
That is when we arrive
That is when we realize
This is when we fall down
