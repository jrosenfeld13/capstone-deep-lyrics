How I love to be the chain
How I love to say your name
How I wanna be the one you run to
How I wanna see this through

How I love to be the risk
And the wrinkles in your fist
How I love to be the one you need
How I love to watch it bleed

When will you learn just to give me
What I want, what I want
When will you learn to let it show

How I wanna be the eye
As it watches in the sky
How I thought it was a reason call
How I love to risk it all

How I love to be the twist
How I wanna live through this
Swinging wildly from a hand you hold
How I love to be that bold

When will you learn just to give me
What I want, what I want
When will you learn to let it show
What you didn't see comin
When will you learn just to give me
What I want, what I want
When will you learn to let it show

When will you learn just to give me
What I want, what I want
When will you learn to let it show
