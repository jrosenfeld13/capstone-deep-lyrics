She's tired of flat lands and cornfields
Seashells traced in snow
She wants more bugs on her windshield
She don't want to go alone

I'd love to go, but I left behind my raincoat
Will anybody miss me when I'm gone?
I'm wide awake, but I'm dreaming of the west coast
I could leave tomorrow but I won't
Cause I've still got my day job

She talks about her waterfall fountain
And her house out on the bay
She's in love with broken glass mountains
Fireplace cafes
