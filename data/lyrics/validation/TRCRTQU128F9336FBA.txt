Hidden behind merciful shadows, beyond the cruel daylight
Living to hunt and kill, we are the... damned children of the night
Dragging our immune existence through thousands of centuries
And from dusk to dawn we suffer from our immortality

Hosts contaminate our tombs and crosses burn our skin
You can kill us a thousand times, but we're the ones
Who will always remain ... - In Pain ... In Pain:
"I'm the resurrection-man, who steals his own corpse
And abducts himself to the beloved catacombs and vaults"

Death and decay, cadaverous smell
For us there's neither heaven, nor is there a hell
And only the stigmata could be able to betray
The sombre existence of the former days

After the dead Lover's kiss you fall into a dream
But with your second birth you're a prince in our mournful realm
By day, when a million suns are killing with their shine
The cold, dark crypts are saving me ... and mine
Death and decay, cadaverous smell
For us there's neither heaven, nor is there a hell
And only the stigmata could be able to betray
The sombre existence of the former days ...
