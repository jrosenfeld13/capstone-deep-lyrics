So be nice to me
Cause I've never played this game before
Arriving at your house
The whole room's been smoked out

And I can hardly breathe
I'll put my coat on what seems to be an ashtray
And I'll make my way towards the TV
Stains and empty bottles will try and distract me
But look at us, it's our team

So be nice to me
Cause I've never sang this song before
And there's no place I'd rather be
So let's drop out of life tonight
We'll drop out of life tonight

For lack of a better term, learn
Cause we can only get so far at this pace
Well look at Matt's face
He's stuck to the armchair eating twenty dollar sustenance
There's not enough here to cover this

Win or lose, this is partly mine
We can keep failing missions from time to time
We can always just take the jet-plane
Cause there's ten-thousand people in Moscow
Who still don't know our names

But I have to be up in four hours
So please save me to digital memory
Before you get too attached to me
I'll be driving home safely
So you can forget the fifty-two song set

So be nice to me
Cause I've never sang this song before
I've never sang this song before

And there's no place I'd rather be
So let's drop out of life tonight
We'll drop out of life tonight

But there's no place I'd rather be
I've never played this song before

But there's no place I'd rather be
I've never played this song before
