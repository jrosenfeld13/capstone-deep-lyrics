Baby, if we can't solve any problems
Why do we lose so many tears?
Oh, so you go again
When the leading man appears

Always the same theme
But can't you see we've got everything
Going on and on and on

And everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you
And everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you

Go on and go free
Maybe you're too close to me
I can feel your body move
But does it mean that much to me

I can't go on singing the same theme
'Cause you can't see we've got everything
Baby, even though you know

That everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you
You just don't care
Everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you

'Cause you can't see we've got everything
Baby, even though you know

That everytime you go away
Everytime you go away

Everytime you go away
Everytime you go away
Everytime you go away
...
