That's how it goes

There's no desire at all
All gone with your love
And I'm slowly fading away
I always thought you'd be mine
Until the end of time
But you're so far away from me

I'm gonna win back what I've lost
Nobody else to rule my world
It's just the way the story goes
(In my dreams)

Have no will power to be strong
I collapse without your love
I'm half the man I used to be
I surely know the thrill is gone
But I'm still burning for you
Begin to doubt my state of mind

I'm gonna win back what I've lost
Nobody else to rule my world
It's just the way the story goes

I'm gonna win back what I've
I'm gonna win back what I've lost
I'm gonna win back what I've lost

I'm gonna win back what I've lost
Nobody else to rule my world
It's just the way the story goes

I'm gonna win back what I've
I'm gonna win back what I've lost
I'm gonna win back what I've lost

That's how it goes
That's how it goes
That's how it goes
