[Verse 1]
You be you and let me be me
No strings attached emotionally
I want to get a little crazy that's putting it plain
You got the medicine and I got the pain

[Chorus 1]
When you just want to feel good
Like the doctor said
One good dose of loving
Is going to straighten out your head

[Chorus 2]
You got an open invitation
On that you can rely
You got a prepaid reservation
And that's the only way to fly

[Verse 2]
Let's make love, the feeling is right
Just passing by like ships in the night
Ought to get a little friendly there's no time like now
You bring the attitude and I'll show you how

[Bridge]
Anytime you're ready
Anytime at all
Just come on over
You don't even have to call

[Chorus 2]
You got an open invitation
On that you can rely
You got a prepaid reservation
And that's the only way to fly

[Chorus 1]
When you just want to feel good
Like the doctor said
One good dose of loving
Is going to straighten out your head

[Chorus 2]
You got an open invitation
On that you can rely
You got a prepaid reservation
And that's the only way to fly
