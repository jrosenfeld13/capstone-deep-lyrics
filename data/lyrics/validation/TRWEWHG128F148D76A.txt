The sirens hold a call
The call win you a gun
The sirens talk a lots
And that talk back to you

From the back of my head
To the back of my neck

And you must have come quickly
When you've heard the sirens talk to me
And you know your way perfectly
And you have such rhythm in your feet

The battle's just begin
The siren deep in wide

It feels like ecstacy
It feels much more to me

From the tip of my toe
To the top of my lung

And you must have come quickly
When you heard the sirens talk to me
And you know your way perfectly
And you have such rhythm in your feet

You...

Ooh...

Always last when you've nothing to gain
Always won you're the only one playing
Always last when you've nothing to gain
Always won you're the only one playing

And you must have come quickly
When you heard the sirens talk to me
And you know your way perfectly
And you have search rhythm in your feet
