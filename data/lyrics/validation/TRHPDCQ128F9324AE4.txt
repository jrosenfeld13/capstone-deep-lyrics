[Verse 1]
We do believe it ends right here
The orchestrations and the dream is clear
Shuttle departs and they're all there
Everyone's cracking up but we don't care

[Chorus]
And we agree
It's what we need
Orchestra real

[Verse 2]
Whisper, the cymbals ride on in
Though this time, we'll trade the strings for old 110
Headphones will assure position when
The crowd fades and the overture begins
Begins

[Chorus]
And we agree
It's what we need
Orchestra real

And we agree
It's what we need
Orchestra real

[Verse 3]
I don't believe the way this feels
Slight alterations leave enraptured ears
Headphones will insure possession when
The crowd fades and the overture begins
Begins

[Chorus]
And we agree
It's what we need
Orchestra real

And we agree
It's what we need
Orchestra real
