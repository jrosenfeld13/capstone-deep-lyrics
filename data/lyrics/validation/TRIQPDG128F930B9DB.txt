I don't like who I am anymore
I am safe
I'm never afraid
If the path where i walk is so safe
I will send someone out to explore

When the outcome is hard to predict
I will leave, the chance will be lost
I am calm, I am always prepared
I'm safe, I am never afraid

Leave me into the unknown
Where I'm lost and all on my own
Take me where I've never been
I go first, don't let me walk behind you

There's a person that they think I am, I am weak
Why let them decide?
How I talk, how I move and react is how they would expect me to be
Now's the time to unconver myself to detect who's hiding inside
Don't be calm, don't be over prepared
Take a chance, be unsafe, be afraid

Leave me into the unknown
Where I'm lost and all on my own
Take me where I've never been
I go first, don't let me walk behind you

Leave me into the unknown
Where I'm lost and all on my own
Take me where I've never been
I go first, don't let me walk behind you

Leave me into the unknown
Where I'm lost and all on my own
Take me where I've never been
I go first, don't let me walk behind you
