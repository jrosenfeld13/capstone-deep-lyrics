I am the conqueror
I taste your scent in the wind
Set my sail but then you sink my boat
So I begin to swim
Woo

Bash my foes until I win now
Lances smash across my chest
That's my quest, you wonder why
I will never die
The only thing I bleed for is you

Oceans of love
I crossed them for you
In the matrix of your garden
I find you in bloom
Now that you found me
No one's gonna get around me
I'm coming for you
Coming for you
Coming for you (can we get this all together)
Coming for you (can we get this all)

Nothing I cannot do
There is nothing I wouldn't do for you
And you put me all through the worst
I am cursed with a light that's made to burn
That's where I shine
And now you'll be mine

Oceans of love
I've crossed them for you
In the matrix of your garden
I beg your pardon
Now that I've hardened
No one's gonna get around me
Coming for you (can we get this all together)
I'm coming for you (can we get this all together)
Coming for you (can we get this all together)
Coming for you (can we get this all together)

I am the conqueror
Byzantine mosaic in the heat
I am cursed, through the worst
With a life that's made to burn
That's where I shine, where I shine now
And you, you, you, you, you
Are mine, mine, mine, mine, mine

Love, I've crossed them for you
In the matrix of your garden
I find you in bloom
And now that I've found you
No one's gonna get around me
You (can we get this all together)
I'm coming for you (can we get this all together)
Coming for you (can we get this all together)
Coming for you (can we get this all together)

I am the conqueror
I am the conqueror
I am the conqueror
I am the conqueror
I am the conqueror
I am the conqueror
Am the conqueror

Yeah
