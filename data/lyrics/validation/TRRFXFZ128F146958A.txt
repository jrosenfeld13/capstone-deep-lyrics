Every tongue shall tell, on that day
When the Lord comes again to judge everyone
For the wrongs they have done
And all the lies they have told
On that day, that dread day

All you back-sliders
And all you false prophets
Where will you go
On that day, that dread day?
Oh, what a day! Oh, what a day!
When every eye shall behold
The one and true one

All shall tremble
Like the leaves on the trees
On that day, that dread day
And every tongue shall tell
Every tongue shall tell
On that day, that dread day
On that day, that dread day
