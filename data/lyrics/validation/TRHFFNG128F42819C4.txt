Heard about Your band
I couldn't help it you were screaming in my ear
Coked up arsehole
Waiting for Liars
You shared a cab with Karen O
Oh oh, Oh oh oh
You're talking hyper bollocks
You're talking saleries
Oh yeh, you work in Insurance?
30k? OTE
You met Electrelane
AA? AAA
You know the girl from Sleater Kinney
You said you couldn't understand
Why it was that she contined to play
When she was only earning 10 Grand PA
You know a lot of people in the industry
Woo-hoo, woo-hoo-hoo
I heard about your Band
WHATEVER DUDE!
