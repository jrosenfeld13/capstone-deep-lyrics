Whoa, I've been tryin'
To talk to you
But there's no one home
Girl, I've been tryin'
To get closer
Ooh, but I'm tryin' alone

So when you hit me with your danger smile
Try to play me for a fool
I know you're lyin', baby
That's your style
But I'm not playing by those rules

Now I know our love is faded
Oh, like the end of lonely days
It's our love we should be savin'
No, instead we're slippin' away

Think you two-time me with your double-talk
And you expect me to believe it, oh
Before you pack your bags and take a walk
Just one more time I've gotta say

Don't tell me why you're leaving
I don't wanna know
Don't tell me why you're leaving
Just, just, just, just, just, just, just let me go

Whoa, you hit me with your danger smile
Tried to play me for a fool
I know you're lyin', baby
That's your style
I'm not playin' by those rules

So don't tell me why you're leaving
I don't wanna know
Don't tell me why you're leaving
Just, just, just, just, just, just, just let me go

Now, now, wait, wait a minute now, hold on
You said what? Where now? With who? What?
You talkin' to me?
Woman, watch out, watch out, watch your mouth, girl
Watch what you're saying!
Watch out, watch out, watch out
Don't, don't, don't, don't you tell me

Oh, don't tell me why you're leaving
I don't wanna know
No, don't tell me why you're leaving
Just, just, just, just, just, just, just up and go
