He liked to kiss the boys
He liked to kiss the girls
He liked to kiss the inbetweeners
Rub his tongue on their gums
Rub his tongue on their gums
& lie with them
& lie to them
& light it up
I know your little secret
Watch my eyes
They see what YOU don't see
They see what YOU know
& what YOU think i don't know
Ah but now we both can share
Everything we've ever done
Everyone we've ever touched
YOU liked the boys and girls
I know your little secret
All the lies
All the hesitation
Won't bring me closer now
Won't you bring me close
I know your little secret
