Thunder shook loose hail
On the outhouse again
Today I bumped into you again
I have no idea what you want
But there was something I meant to say

As the day stops dead
At the place where we're lost
I will drug you and fuck you
On the permafrost

There's not much that I miss
I'm far too forgetful for that
Sugar's sweet some of the time
It's hard to keep some things in mind

As the day stops dead ...
