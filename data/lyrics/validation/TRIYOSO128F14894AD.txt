Payne-Wray

You can open the window
Where the sunset meets the sea
Everything's for sale
Everything's for free

Sweet mother Mary
Sells her fortunes well
She's got all the answers
Just might save you from hell

Across the street at the bottomless cup
You can drink and drink but you can
Never get enough
You can have yours with sweet and low
You might even have the blues to go

One shot Johnny
Got a dog on a rope
Goin' from table to table
With a pocket full of hope

Rodeo riders and scarlet women
Lean against your walls
The show they're waitin' for
Is just three steps down the hall

The of king of jive looks like the queen of please
Makes his livin' on his hands and knees
You give and you give 'till you give it all
Oh, just think if these walls could talk, oh

I've climbed so high
And I've surely fell
Every story has a hero
Down at the Cadillac Hotel

El Dorado Slim
Works behind the desk
Either day or night
He can handle any request

J. C.'s screamin'
Bout turnin' water to wine
Got all in a big brown bag
In the lobby, just past nine, in an old Maytag

The homeless and haunted and street Van Gogh's
Lace their souls up tight
Hang your coat on a fin, you finally got in
Get ready for Cadillac night

Across the street at the bottomless cup
It's not about money, you can never get enough
A handful of honesty, a fist full of pride
It's not how you live, it's how you survive

I've climbed so high
And I've surely fell
Every story has a hero
Down at the Cadillac Hotel

I've climbed so high
And I've surely fell
Ten thousand feet to zero
Down at the Cadillac Hotel
