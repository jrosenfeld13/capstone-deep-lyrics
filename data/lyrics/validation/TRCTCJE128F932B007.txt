Living corpse in the wreck that they rent for you eat two peas
Drink their sweet pissings
No life no thoughts no energy, but a yes
A dessicated fig you've become

This is ours!!

With every breath a vomit
Diarrhoea and speech have the same result its the same impact
A diabetic you ve become in your mind
But you never dared to touch the marmelade jar

Great tolerance!

Some motionless leaves to walk on them now
A harem of worms to dance for their king

The trivial maze surrounds me
They are the killers they are all the disease
A delight in a trap from a joke
A dessicated fig inside!!!!!

Some motionless leaves to walk on them now
A harem of worms to dance for their king

Living corpse in the wreck that they rent for you eat two peas
Drink their sweet pissings
No life no thoughts no energy, but a yes
A dessicated fig you've become
