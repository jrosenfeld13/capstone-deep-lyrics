Government spin tells you what to believe
Hidden agendas designed to deceive
Dancing to the tune of the Islington beat
Myths perpetrated by the Guardian elite

Silent conspiracy, eternal shame
Another scapegoat to shoulder the blame
Truth well hidden in a bureaucratic maze
Out of the limelight and the public gaze

I've gotta, you've gotta, we've gotta stand up and fight now
I've gotta, you've gotta, we've gotta stop 'em now

What About Me? Who defends my liberties
What About Me?
What About You? Who decides what you're gonna do?
What About You?

Self preservation's the main policy
Power corrupts and breeds hypocrisy
Manipulate the press to further the cause
Encouraged by redundant archaic laws

Elected to speak for the man in the street
Empty promises safeguard your seat
The honourable member is a total disgrace
A matter of time before you fall from grace

I've gotta, you've gotta, we've gotta stand up and fight now
I've gotta, you've gotta, we've gotta stop 'em now
