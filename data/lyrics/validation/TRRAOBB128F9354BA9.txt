Are you feelin'
A little desperate
Get on your knees
And confess it
Honey please
Don't second guess it
You're desperate
For love

Is this just
A little fling
Or is it about
A little bling bling
Either way
You feel the sting sting
You're desperate
For love

It might only take a kiss
For the plot to take a twist
That you hadn't counted on

Just a tiny little minute
But eternity will be in it
If you turn me on

Red wine on my lips
Got this black silk slip on my hips
The kitchen faucet just drips and drips
You're desperate for love

Oh, it's ridiculous and sublime
It's a poem, but don't know which rhyme
But this could be your once upon a time
You're desperate for love

You're desperate for love
You're desperate for love
