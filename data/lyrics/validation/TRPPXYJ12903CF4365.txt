Why do we hut ourselves this way
It's getting worst everyday
I feel like I wanna give up
Or is it letting go

'Cause when you give up
It's freeing someone
Who's never really yours
And letting go is freeing someone
Who should have been rightfully yours

Let's give it one more try
Tomorrow might be too late
We are on our last few minutes of today

[Chorus:]
Let's give it one more try
Tomorrow might be too late
We are in/on last few minutes of today

It's been hard to keep up the fight
That's why I have to turn back
'Cause you're better off with him
And I am letting go
And letting go is freeing someone
Who should have been rightfully yours

[repeat Chorus]
Let's give it one more try
Tomorrow might be too late
We are on our last few minutes of today
And letting go is freeing someone
Who should have been rightfully yours

[repeat Chorus 3x]
