Half past 5 I'm in the pub
Six O'clock it's home for grub
Eight O'clock I'm back to the bar
Sod the walk I'll take the car

(Chorus:)
Knock it back
Have another one
Drinking and driving is so much fun

In the motor off you go
Not too fast and not too slow
Keep your head and keep your cool
Must avoid that rightful pull
As you meander down the road
Don't forget your highway code
See the spot and take your pick
Out of the car to be sick!.....
