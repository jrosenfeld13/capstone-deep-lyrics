Billy Club has got his strength
It places him above them
The feeble incompletes
Billy Club has found his pride
He looks down on their state
The verdict justified
It's self-defense
It's vigilance
It's nature's call
Oppose them all
The lesser ones are the vital threat
He needs them
Billy Club has got his faith
He's followed every lead
Set down in history
Billy Club has found his place
It's comforting and cold
It's here he realized his role
And here it comes
That old defense
He's consequence
But he has chosen
The iron grip
His Billy Club
Desensitized
He's everywhere
He's anyone. He's every...
Billy Club has got his strength for this world (repeat)
