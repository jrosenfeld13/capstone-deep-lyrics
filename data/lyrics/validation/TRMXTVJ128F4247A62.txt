Don't say everything's okay
Don't tell me that it's just a phase
It doesn't help me

All the stars are standing still
The anger and the sleeping pills
Are all that's left now

An epidemic in my heart
Takes hold and slowly poisons me
Her will won't let me breathe
It comes in waves and bleeds me dry
This love is slowly killing me
For me, there's no one else

Jealousy just eats me up
Your knife has made the deepest cut
My heart is popping

You say that there must be an end
But afterwards we'll still be friends
It seemed so easy

An epidemic in my heart
Takes hold and slowly poisons me
And her will won't let me breathe
It comes in waves and bleeds me dry
This love is slowly killing me
For me, there's no one else

An epidemic in my heart
Takes hold and slowly poisons me
And her will won't let me breathe
It comes in waves and bleeds me dry
This love is slowly killing me
For me, there's no one else

Don't say everything's okay
Don't tell me that it's just a phase
It doesn't help me
