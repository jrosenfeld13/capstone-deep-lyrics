Your thoughts are simple
You scream it out
Your expression is grim you
Don't have to be loud

But one day is coming
You can't just avoid
Your thoughts get assuming
Your fingers adroit

Muscles reaching the line of pain
Sending memories to holy brain
Your own deception appears as true
Paves the way for the absent clue

You build a weapon thing
That should free your mind
So what would grow two wings
On your own behind

Muscles reaching the line of pain
Sending memories to holy brain
Your own deception appears as true
Paves the way for the absent clue

In the margin of madness
You don't realize
That things are blessed
Which you criticize
That the world is colorful
Which you see in grey
And the men aren't cruel
That you see everyday

Muscles reaching the line of pain
Sending memories to holy brain
Your own deception appears as true
Paves the way for the absent clue
