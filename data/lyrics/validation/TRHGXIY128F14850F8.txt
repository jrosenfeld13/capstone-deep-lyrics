[Chorus]
I ain't got
Nothing to be scared of
No I ain't got
Nothing to be scared of
No I ain't got
Anything to be scared of
Because I love you

[Verse]
I was born out of love
It's the only way to come into this world
I know I'm not all there
But I'm getting, getting, getting there
If you let me live my life
I'll stay with you to the end
And I know, lord
I'm nearly there
I want to tell you this

[Chorus]
I ain't got
Nothing to be scared of
No I ain't got
Nothing to be scared of
No I ain't got
Anything to be scared of
Because I love you

[Outro]
I ain't got
Nothing to be scared of
No ain't got
Nothing to be scared of[x2]
