All this time I'm waitin'
I wasn't disappointing for a love like you
A love that is always true

But you got me dreamin'
If I need hard believing
In a love like you
A love that is always true

Love is an angel
Holding inside
Love is an angel
Standing by your side

Are you my angel, are you my guide?
Where is the answer, where is the light?
Are you my vengeance? Are you my pride?
Are you my stranger? Heaven decides

Love is an angel
Holding inside
Love is an angel
Standing by your side

Are you my angel, are you my guide?
Where is the answer, where is the light?
Are you my vengeance? Are you my pride?
Are you my stranger? Heaven decides

All the tears I've been crying
I was slowly dying
For a love like you
A love that is always true

But you got me dreamin'
If I'm in hard believing
In a love like you
A love that is always true

Are you my angel, are you my guide?
Where is the answer, where is the light?
Are you my vengeance? Are you my pride?
Are you my stranger? Heaven decides

Love is an angel
Holding inside
Love is an angel
Standing by your side

Are you my angel, are you my guide?
Where is the answer, where is the light?
Are you my vengeance? Are you my pride?
Are you my stranger? Heaven decides
