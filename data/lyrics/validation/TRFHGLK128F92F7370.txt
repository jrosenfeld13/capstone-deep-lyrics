You wonder were it all went wrong
You never knew reason
You found youself alone again
Everytime you take another chance
Put your faith in someone else
I'm praying that you find someone
Who never break your heart again
Never
And every time you cry
Every time your heart surrenders inside
You take a part of me
Everytime your crying you take a part of me yeah
And everytime you fall
Everytime your heart surrenders control
Praying that you find someone
Who never break your heart again
Every time you cry
You thought you seen it all before
You thought it was so easy
But now your dream is chrusing down
But love is just a breath away
Love is just a breath away
I'm praying that you find someone
Who never break your heart again
Cuz everytime you cry
Everytime your heart surrenders inside
You take a part of me
Every time you cry you it takes a part of me
And everytime you fall
Everytime your heart surrenders control
Praying that you find someone
Who never break your heart again
Every time you fall
Everytime you cry
Everytime your heart surrenders inside
You take a part of me
Everytime you cry it takes a part of me
And everytime you fall
Everytime your heart surrenders control
I'm praying that you'll find someone
Who never break your heart again
Everytime you cry
