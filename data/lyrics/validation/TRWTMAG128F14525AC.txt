I will welcome any stranger
For strangeness is a welcome guest
And i will make a bed for him to rest

We will arise there after
Fall around the place in drunken laughter
And never look back again

Years of merry dancing
Weighed heavy on our chest
No more could we afford a place to rest

Cold was the winter
We promised to stay dry together
We never spoke again
