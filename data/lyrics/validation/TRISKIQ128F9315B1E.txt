[Refrain]
You've got me stuck on repeat
And I just can't seem to break free
You've got me stuck on repeat
I can only move to the beat

[Verse1]
And I don't remember how it started
And I don't know how to stop
But every time I reach the bottom
Something pulls me right back to the top cause

[Chorus]
Every time I try, every time I try
Every time I try to break free
Then something comes along, something comes along
Something comes along to intervene

[Post-Chorus]
My heart's skipping, skipping
And I don't know why, I know every part
But every time I try, every time I try
Something comes and pulls me back to the start

[Refrain]
You've got me stuck on repeat
And I just can't seem to break free
You've got me stuck on repeat
I can only move to the beat

[Verse 2]
And I don't remember how it started
And I don't know how to stop
But every time I reach the bottom
Something pulls me right back to the top cause

[Chorus]
Every time I try, every time I try
Every time I try to break free
Then something comes along, something comes along
Something comes along to intervene

[Post-Chorus]
My heart's skipping, skipping
And I don't know why, I know every part
But every time I try, every time I try
Something comes and pulls me back to the start

[Bridge]
And it's you who makes me move to the beat
And it's you that's got me stuck on repeat

[Chorus]
Every time I try, every time I try
Every time I try to break free
Then something comes along, something comes along
Something comes along to intervene

[Post-Chorus]
My heart's skipping, skipping
And I don't know why, I know every part
But every time I try, every time I try
Something comes and pulls me back to the start
