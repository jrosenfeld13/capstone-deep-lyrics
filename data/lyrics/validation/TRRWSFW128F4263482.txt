You are so precious
I'll carve you in bone
For all of my efforts
I end up alone, yeah

Anything you say
You will always get your way
But tonight, my life is your life

Think of tomorrow
I take it you don't
And if you get tired
I'll carry you home

So if by design or
By freak accident
We end up apart
I will know what you meant, yeah

I scream and I shout
I will always feel left out
Oh but tonight my life, yeah, is your life

Go!

Woah, and I feel it's clear
I was never welcome here
But at least for tonight
You're mine
You're mine
