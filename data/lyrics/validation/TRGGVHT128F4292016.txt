Momentary sensory paralysis
Moments cut like shards of broken glass
Somewhere between sublime and the ridiculous
Is where we go to mend a broken heart

Feeling like a child and looking like a man
You wanna make it right, feeling like you can't

Out of this world
Out of our hands
Out of control
This beauty unfolds again and again
Out of this world
And into the blue
From me, from here to you

Not the best of times to give up anything
Least of all this love affair with life
We're so close together, yet so separate
Couldn't realize it if we tried

Feeling like a child and looking like a man
You wanna make it right, feeling like you can't

Out of this world
Out of our hands
Out of control
This beauty unfolds again and again
Out of this world
And into the blue
From me, from here to you
