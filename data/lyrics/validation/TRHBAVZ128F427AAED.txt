[Verse 1]
Hello, world
Hope you're listening
Forgive me if Im young
For speaking out of turn
Theres someone I've been missing
I think that they could be
The better half of me
Theyre in the wrong place trying to make it right
But Im tired of justifying
So I say to you

[Chorus]
Come home, come home
Because I've been waiting for you
For so long, for so long
Right now, there's a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
The fight for you is all I've ever known
So come home, oh

[Verse 2]
I get lost in the beauty
Of everything I see
The world isn't half as bad
As they paint it to be
If all the sons, all the daughters
Stopped to take it in
Well, hopefully, the hate subsides
And the love can begin
It might start now, yeah
Well, maybe Im just dreaming out loud
Until then

[Chorus]
Come home, come home
Because I've been waiting for you
For so long, for so long
Right now, there's a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
The fight for you is all I've ever known ever known
So come home, oh

[Bridge]
Everything I cant be
Is everything you should be
And thats why I need you here
Everything I cant be
Is everything you should be
And thats why I need you here
So hear this now

[Chorus]
Come home, come home
Because I've been waiting for you
For so long, for so long
Right now, there's a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
The fight for you is all I've ever known ever known
So come home, oh

[Outro]
Come home, come home
Because I've been waiting for you
