My baby told me that she's coming home again
I can see here smiling face pictured in my mind
When she's gone, my heart is filled with pain
I'm like a dong been left out in the remain
Why she left I just don't understand
Till she's here I'm an unhappy man

Without her I am loveless
I'm just a hopeless case
I am loveless

Since she's been gone I've been hurtin' for the longest time
I wanna give back some lovin'
And make her glad she's mine
Whe she's gone I'm searching for her face
I miss her smile and I need here warm embrace
She took here love, why I don't understand
Now all that's left is just a shadow of a man

Without her I am loveless
I'm just a hopeless case
I am loveless

I say a prayer every night
That she's coming back to stay
No I never ever gave her a reason to ever go away, no way
Now I know exactly what I need
To have her back, hold her next to me
There'll never be another lonely hour
For me to count the times, I've been without her

Without her I am loveless
I'm just a hopeless case
I am loveless
I'm just a hopeless case
