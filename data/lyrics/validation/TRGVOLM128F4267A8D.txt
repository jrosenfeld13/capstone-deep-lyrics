I have never loved a lady
Never touched no silken knee
Macon baby, you drove me crazy
You were so easy to me

Lay me down in Georgia pine cones
Whisper to me through the trees
You're the one I always dream of
You're the only one I see

Whoa, slow dancer, sweet romancer
Shine your light on me
Slow dancer holds the answer
Only you can set me free

Never see your face in sunlight
Moonlight sends you straight to me
You never even got my name right
You were so easy to me

Whoa, slow dancer, sweet romancer
Shine your light on me
Slow dancer give me the answer
Only you can set me free

Slow dancer, sweet romancer
Shine your light on me
Slow dancer give me the answer
