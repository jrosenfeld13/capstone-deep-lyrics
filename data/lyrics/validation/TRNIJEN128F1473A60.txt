Don't come knocking on my front door
Thinking things are like before
I don't love you anymore

Today the world is looking fine
I finally found some peace of mind
'Cause now you see I realize
Your love was only a disguise

Don't come knocking on my front door
Thinking things are like before
I don't love you anymore

Remembering how it used to be
And how you made a fool of me
But now it's over and it's done
It's like my life had just begun

Don't come knocking on my front door
Thinking things are like before
I don't love you anymore

Don't come knocking on my front door
Thinking things are like before
I don't love you anymore

I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore
