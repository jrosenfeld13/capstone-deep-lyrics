I know a girl who's tough but sweet
She's so fine she can't be beat
Got everything that I desire
Sets the summer sun on fire
I want candy I want candy
Ought to see her with her hair hung down
Ain't no finer girl in town
Candy's just what the doctor ordered
She's so sweet she makes my mouth water

I want candy I want candy
Oh
I want candy oh oh
Hey
I want candy
Candy
I want candy
With her hair hung down

Candy on the beach there's nothing better
But I like candy in slacks and a sweater
Some day soon I'll make you mine
Then I'll have candy all the time

I want candy I want candy
I want candy I want candy
Yeah
Hey hey
Hey hey
I want candy
Oh oh
Yeah
I want candy
Yeah
I want candy
I want candy...
