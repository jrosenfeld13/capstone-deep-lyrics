Ernesto says, "Jay Hanuman," one-two

This is a story 'bout a man from Talkum County
He had a dog named Bobby Shannon
You could hear him chanting every day about sundown
Spending all his off time in the cremation ground

Chorus:
Oh no, no, no Bobby
I can't see you Bobby
Bobby Shannon

He had a picture in a Shrine of a Monkey
From an old story where he jumped over the sea
He could be as big as a giant
Or as small as a flea
Old Bobby just laughed and he wink ed at me

Chorus

Now he's covered with ashes and covered with sweat
He looked like a man who had lost a bet
He glanced around once at the burning ground
Then he took off running like a scalded hound

Chorus
