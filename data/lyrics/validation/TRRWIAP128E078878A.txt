[Verse 1]
Royal Canadian blended
The spicy aroma had mended me
Matured for years and imported
Into my glass you poured it

[Pre-Chorus]
And you're the only reason
That I remain unfrozen
Suppose it stands to reason
That you would turn on me

[Chorus]
You're so solid
You're so solid
It burns inside of me
Cause you're so solid
It burns inside of me

[Verse 2]
Wild Turkey's been chosen
Its caramel nose can smell me
Arbourler, Jameson, I love you
The single malts come burning

[Pre-Chorus]
And you're the only reason
That I remain unfrozen
Suppose it stands to reason
That you would turn on me

[Chorus]
You're so solid
You're so solid
It burns inside of me
Cause you're so solid
It burns inside of me

[Bridge]
Royal Canadian blended
The spicy aroma had mended me

[Pre-Chorus]
And you're the only reason
That I remain unfrozen
Suppose it stands to reason
That you would turn on me

[Chorus]
You're so solid
You're so solid
It burns inside of me
Cause you're so solid
It burns inside of me
