In a lonely room
Waiting for the night to fall
I hear your voice in every whip-poor-will that calls
And it takes me back to a better place and a sweeter time
When I was your's and you were mine

As the shadows fall and the light grows dim
I see your face
I close my eyes and feel the warmth of your embrace
As I long for you
And for all those days when hearts entwined

When I was your's and you were mine
When I was your's and you were mine

When I was your's and you were mine
A truer love in Caroline
Ever waltzed across these hills
And danced beneath the stars
Life was sweeter than the flowers blooming on the vine
When I was your's and you were mine

So I lay my head
On a pillow soft and stained with tears
I cry for you through all the long and lonely years
But when I dream till the morning sun comes to shine
Then I'll be your's and you'll be mine

Yes, I will go back to a better place
And a sweeter time
When I was your's and you were mine
