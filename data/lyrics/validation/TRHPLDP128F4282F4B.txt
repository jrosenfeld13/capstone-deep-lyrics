Abrasive to the touch
All in all in all the same thing now
We are gathered here in nonesuch
Hooks back to the line
And I trip over myself here
And I trip over myself
Something's stuck in me here
And I can't get out

Some in paint
Some in blood
Some in makeup
Derail me
Derail me
Derail me
Derail me

To everything
Churn, churn, churn
There is a season
Churn, churn, churn
There is a reason
Churn, churn, churn
This ain't the time or the place

I am sick of walking into rainbows
I am sick of plugging into rainbows
I am sick of tuning into rainbows
I am sick of turning into rainbows

Some in paint
Some in blood
Some in makeup
Derail me
Derail me
Derail me
Derail me
