You live your life as if you really didn't care
You're on a train heading straight for despair
You hate your past, the future's a joke
The only thing you want is another line of coke

Doing drugs, you feel the need to get high
One more drink did you ever wonder why
You say you're lonely, you wanna die
Become fed up with living a lie

But Jesus said, "I do care"
Jesus said "I'll be there"

Looking for a reason
Tired of the same old lies
Looking for a reason
Someone to make me wise

I know a way, yes I do
His loving arms, oh, they are reaching out to you
He knocks at your heart's door
He longs to come in
And when He forgives. He forgives all your sin

Jesus said, "I do care"
Jesus said "I'll be there"

Looking for a reason
Tired of the same old lies
Looking for a reason
Someone to make me wise
Looking for a reason
I don't need no more lies
'Cause I got me a reason
