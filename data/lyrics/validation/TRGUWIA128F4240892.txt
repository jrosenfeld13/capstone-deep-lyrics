Punctured lungs!

I'm out of breath
This time, I'm suffocating
I've had enough now
Too numb, there's no resisting
Becoming one with all your failure
No coming back now
This bridge has been burned

Try to cut the chord
Tear away, or I will never be the same
Trust breaks like bone, violent show
Reject and throw it all away

Consume the fight in me
Suspend reality
If it stops the room from spinning
Repressed identity
Escape reality

You killed the cause
This keeps repeating
Live through the loss
Now redeem your enemies

Recycled thoughts feed your delusion
Your lie outgrows you becomes its own truth

Still it seems so wrong, the way you think
And I will never understand
Faith, broke like bones, weakness shown
You lost and threw it all away

Consume the fight in me
Suspend reality
If it stops the room from spinning
Repressed identity
Escape reality
If it stops the room from spinning

Puncture my lungs
Puncture my lungs

Punctured lungs!

I've never felt your emptiness
It makes me sick now

Obsessive with your reason
Compulsive with your failure

Try to cut the chord
Tear away, or I will never be the same
Trust breaks like bone, violence show
Reject and throw it all away

Consume the fight in me
Suspend reality
If it stops the room from spinning
Repressed identity
Escape reality
If it stops the room from spinning
Consume the fight in me
Suspend reality
If it stops the room from spinning

How could you live with yourself?
How could you live with yourself?

How could you live like yourself?
How could you live like yourself?
