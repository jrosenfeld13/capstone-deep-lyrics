[Chorus]
By the end of the bout
He was punched out
Fists capsized, muscles shouting
Deeper down
He felt the insult of a kiss

[Verse]
Deeper still than we can go
Further out than triremes row
Drowning slow
His memories persist
Out beyond the telescopes prowl
Up above the towers touched up pile
He realized
This mystery is his
Underneath the ocean floor
The part of who we are, we don't explore
I adore the meaninglessness of the this
We can express

[Chorus]
By the end of the bout
He was punched out
Fists capsized, muscles shouting
Deeper down
He felt the comfort of a kiss
