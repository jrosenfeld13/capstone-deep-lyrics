Lately I've been thinking
The way you're treating me
I've been wondering
What it's about
And there's no doubt
So when I leave
(What you gonna do?)
You're strong
No need to grieve
(What you gonna say?)
Here's my time to
No need to shout, I'm out

Drop the funk
Drop the bass

Headed, headed for me

Here's my time to go
No need to shout, I'm out
