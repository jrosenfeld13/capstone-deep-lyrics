The cold wind air it sets my gohills boots on fire
But if I told you I've forgotten my past, I'll be a motherless liar
I want out on the street, I want out on the world
I have been a mile of the devil's girl
I'm gonna hold my head on high and take a walk in the sun

Well she gave her heart to so many that shattered my world
Oh but a man can't ruin his life for the love of a girl
I'm gonna throw out my crotches, gonna run into the ring
Gonna let my nostrils swell with the nature of plains
I'm gonna hold my head on high and take a walk in the sun

Well she loved so many men, my heart was breaken
With every little kiss, well I be aching
Whatever I've be given to be taken
Oh but a man can't live when the story begins, begins to slip away

I'm gonna walk right down that road and never return
I know into these fires inside me are starting to burn
'Cause I don't need a girl beside me or a girl to keep me warm
Or a girl that I can talk to till the twenty hours or more
I'm gonna hold my head on high and take a walk in the sun

I'm gonna walk right down that road and never return
I know into these fires inside me are starting to burn
'Cause I don't need a girl beside me or a girl to keep me warm
Or a girl that I can talk to till the twenty hours or more
I'm gonna hold my head on high and take a walk in the sun
I'm gonna hold my head on high and take a walk in the sun
