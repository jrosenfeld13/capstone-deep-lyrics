[Intro]
Goddamn you!

[Verse 1]
Haven't let you in 'cause I'm in you
Haven't let you in 'cause I'm in you
Must have been a bitch, must have been a pain
Take me off the innocent
Put me in your vein

[Chorus]
It's improbable
Yeah, it's improbable

[Verse 2]
Haven't said a word 'cause you're still on
Haven't said a word 'cause you're still on
Mustn't take offense, mustn't take a bow
Used to be a derelict
Now I have to live with it

[Chorus]
It's improbable
Yeah, it's improbable
Yeah, it's improbable
Yeah, you came back, but I know better boy

[Bridge]
Trip my light fantastic
Rub me in your wound
Well I'm not broken, I'm not plastic
I'm no whore
Used against me, use me up again

[Chorus]
It's improbable
Yeah, it's improbable
Yeah, it's improbable
Yeah, you came back, but I know better boy

Sometimes I think I'm crazy, other times I know I'm not

Got no time to time to time, once again
Got no time to time to time, once again
Got no time to time to time, once again
You don't want me, you don't need me
