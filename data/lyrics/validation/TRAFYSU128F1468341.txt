[Verse 1]
Billy's leaving today
Don't know where he's going
Holds his head in disgrace
He can't escape the truth
He knows the price that he's paid
He admits that it's too late to admit that he's afraid

[Chorus]
Tomorrow comes
Sorrow becomes his soul mate
The damage is done
The prodigal son is too late
Old doors are closed but he's always open
To relive time in his mind
Oh Billy

[Verse 2]
Billy's leaving today
Don't know where he's going
He's got lines on his face
They tell the story of his pain
He accepts it's his fate
He admits it took too long to admit that he was wrong

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Once he was a lover sleeping with another
Now he's just known as a cheat
And he wish he'd had a mirror
Looked a little clearer
Seen into the eyes of the weak (2x)

[Chorus]
