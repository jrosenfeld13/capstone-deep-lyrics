In the misty moonlight
By the flickering firelight
Any place is all right
Long as I'm with you (as long as I'm with you-ooh)

In a far-away land
On the tropic sea sand
If your hand's in my hand
I won't be blue

Way up on the mountain
Or way down in the valley
I know I'll be happy
Anyplace, anywhere, I don't care

In the misty moonlight
By the flickering firelight
Any place is all right
Long as you are there

I could be happy in one little room with only a table and chair. As
Happy as I'd be in a kingdom by the sea, darling, if you were there. And I could be
Rich or I could be poor.. but if you were by my side, I could be any place in this whole
Wide worldand I know I'd be satisfied

Way up on the mountain
Or way down in the valley
I know I'll be happy
Anyplace, anywhere, I don't care

In the misty moonlight
By the flickering firelight
Any place is all right
Long as you are there

In the misty moonlight
By the flickering firelight
Any place is all right
Long as you are there

In the misty moonlight
By the flickering firelight
Any place is all right
Long as you are there
