Honey honey, up in the trees
Fields of flowers deep in his dreams
Lead them out to sea by the east
Honey honey, food for the bees

Honey honey, out on the sea
In the Doldrums thinking of me
Me on dry land thinking of he
Honey honey, not next to me

Even if he wanted to
Even if he wanted to
Even if he wanted to
Do you think he'll come back
Would he come back

Honey honey out on the sea
In the Doldrums waiting for me
Me in my boat searching for he
Honey honey, food for the bees
