Hey are you asleep now
I thought I heard you talking
'Cause they're draining out my heart
And I think I know what's coming
They can't leave this alone

My oceans are expanding
And all us fish are drowning inside
There's pollution on the tide
And this ship of fools I'm rolling with
Can't keep me alive

But in this light
I can see the angels burning from the inside out
They spread their wings to die
In this light
I can see the people the damaged goods they take this life
It's passing by

You know that we're sinking
All your jewels are dragging us down
But I'm running out of blood
Taking money over love
We can't hope to survive
So ask me if I'm hungry
While everybody's starving inside
But the doctor's never there
And this medication
Doesn't really keep me controlled

But in this light
I can see the angels burning from the inside out
They spread their wings to die
In this light
I can see the people the damaged goods they take this life
It's passing by

You you know that I'm not that strong
You know I can't get out
I'm not able now
You I know you have to change
We all stay the same
I'm not able now

Hey are you asleep now
I thought I heard you talking
'Cause they're draining out my heart
And I think I know whats coming
They can't leave this alone

But in this light
I can see the angels burning from the inside out
They spread their wings to die
In this light
I can see the people the damaged goods they take this life
It's passing by

You you know that I'm not that strong
You know I can't get out
I'm not able now
You I know you have to change
We all stay the same
I'm not able now
