Blinded by conformity
You're a shadow of what you used to be
They snatched your mind, seduced your soul
Now you're under their control

You will never be the same
There's no one but you to blame
No escape, you're outta luck
Sold your life for a few bucks
Now you walk the path of self destruct

Lured away, you're out of reach
They sucked you dry just like a leech
Now you're stuck in a pile of shit
And you just can't get out of it
