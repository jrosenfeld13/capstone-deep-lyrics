I've been loving you
Too long to stop now

You are tired and you wanna be free
My love is growing stronger as you become a habit to me
I've been loving you a little too long, don't wanna stop now

With you my life has been so wonderful
I can't stop now

You are tired and your love is growing cold
My love is growing stronger as our affair grows old
Oh baby, I've been loving you a little too long to stop now

Oh, oh, I've been loving you a little too long
Please don't make me stop now

No, no, oh, I love with all my heart
Please don't make me stop now

Please, please don't make me stop now
No, no, no, no, don't make me stop now

Said I love you, I love you with all my heart and soul
No, please don't make me stop now

Oh, my love is very strong and
Don't, don't make me stop now
Don't, don't make me stop now
Loving you
