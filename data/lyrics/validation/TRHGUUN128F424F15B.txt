Many years from now
I sit and wonder
Many years from now
I wonder

Many years from now
I sit and wonder
Many years from now
I wonder

Walked across the coffee sands
Felt the warmth of sacred lands
We watched the waves
Crash upon the shore

Everything this life should be
Got lost in memories
A distant sun still burns inside of me
It's where I want to be...
