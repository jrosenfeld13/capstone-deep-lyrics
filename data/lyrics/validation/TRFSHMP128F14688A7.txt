She's a right on sister
And she knows what she likes
She needs you and me, man
Like a fish needs a bike
Suffragette city
Don't bother her none
Cos the women's revolution
Is bound to come... and I say

Right on, sister
Right on sister, right on

She's a clear level thinker
Just look at her play
She's got it together
In most every way
The women's army is marching
And the weak shall be strong
Power to the sisters
Right on, right on... and I say

Right on, sister
Right on sister, right on
