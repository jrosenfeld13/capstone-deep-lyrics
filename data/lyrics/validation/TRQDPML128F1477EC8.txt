Christine, she tells me that she's in love again
Christine, she says that she still loves me
She stands there calling my name
In her boyfriend's jacket in the rain
I guess she's in love with the whole damned world

And the whole world loves her
Won't turn without her
It has to have her...
I can't live without her

Just one moment with christine
You know exactly what i mean
She stays the night and then she leaves
Just a little hope inbetween
One more moment with christine
She's like a life-time where i've been
I wanna live to the extreme
I need another taste of christine

Oh i need another taste (another taste) of christine

Christine, the touch of another human's hand
Their whispered breath falling on your skin
I don't know where to begin
Well, i just arrived, now i'm locked in
And now i'm caught in your mixed-up world

And the whole world loves you
Won't turn without you
It has to have you
I can't live without you

Just one moment with christine
You know exactly what i mean
She stays the night and then she leaves
Just a little hope inbetween
One more moment with christine
She's like a life-time where i've been
I wanna live to the extreme
Won't you tell me, where's christine?

How many times will it take for me to learn
Tell me, are we heading for nowhere
Christine...
How many times will it take for me to learn
Tell me, are we heading for nowhere (echo)

And the whole world loves her

Just one moment with christine
You know exactly what i mean
She stays the night and then she leaves
Just a little hope inbetween
One more moment with christine
Is like a life-time where i've been
I wanna live to the extreme
I need another taste of christine

How many times does it take to learn?
How many times does it take to learn?
How many times does it take to learn?
How many times does it take to learn?

Another taste of christine...
