[Verse 1: MC Zuko]
I play the game like a game of 5s man Im pickin' and rollin'
Im droppin a song every week with the team man Im givin and goin
I dont like wastin my time on the screen clickin and scrollin
I move the crowd make em put they hands up like Im kickin a goal in
I ride the beat like a luxury car with the top of it missin'
I said it before but Ill say it again if you with me you winnin
Every time I hit the booth Im raisin the temperatures up
And Ill only start giving a fuck as soon as the president does
Shout out my favorite Latinos I might just go south for the winter
Backwoodyharrison and Kuya Kyno smilin with a mouth full of glitter
I got the Infinity gauntlet I make the Avengers Assemble
I drive to South Central
I got the best engineer in the game checkin my levels right now
I dont like rappin bout money and clothes or holdin an Uzi
I aint really see no competition, but Im only assumin'
Im the most handsome MC here reportin' for duty
And I was built for this shit man and Ill show you to prove it

[Chorus]
Can I get a what what?
Yeah
What what?
Im startin' to feel I got the Midas touch
Im startin' to feel like I just might erupt, BOOM
This that triplet liquid slippery flow
I mean, whatchu really wanna know? Huh?
I swear to God every beat that I touch is like drippin in gold
I swear to God every beat that I touch is like drippin in gold
I swear to God every beat that I touch is like drippin in gold
I swear to God every beat that I touch is like drippin in drippin in drippin in gold

[Verse 2: Mr. Backwoodyharrison]
I dont like rappin' bout money or clothes, thats just the life that Im livin'
I dont like rappin' bout Glocks or the uzi but thats how Im spittin'
I laugh to the bank cause I heard what you make in a year, that shit is hysterical
Before I leave the house I switch the bezel
Then head to the Jungle to cop me some medical
If you dont got money I can not sit next to you
You askin' for feature not sayin' no prices dont think I could fit you in schedule nigga
Im drippin' in Virgil, Buscemi my garments
When I die, Buscemi my carcass
This the luck of the Irish like niggas in March or Im playin' in Boston
Fuck what the cost is
When Im shoppin'
Niggas trippin' fold 'em call it origami
For breakfast I might eat hibachi smokin' ridin' passenger side in the Audi
Im Satima with the hands nigga
Call me Kakorot with the saiyan nigga
From the beach raised by the sand where they shoot at ops and every other man with 'em

[Chorus]
Can I get a what what?
Yeah
What what?
Im startin' to feel I got the Midas touch
Im startin' to feel like I just might erupt, BOOM
This that triplet liquid slippery flow
I mean, whatchu really wanna know? Huh?
I swear to God every beat that I touch is like drippin in gold
I swear to God every beat that I touch is like drippin in gold
I swear to God every beat that I touch is like drippin in gold
I swear to God every beat that I touch is like drippin in drippin in drippin in gold

[Verse 3: MC Zuko]
I was with Kuya Marvs makin the beat man we both a had a look in disgust
I told him man you should give me this beat, he said you aint the only one
I mean if you want it then you better murder the shit I said boy aint no need to discuss
If you want it then you better murder the shit I said boy aint no need to discuss
Im too determined to never consider an outcome thats positive homie
Im not a good friend to keep cuz Im not good at keepin' my promises homie
Matter of fact I would rather break em just like all of these rappers esophagus homie
The sound of you seepin for oxygen sounds a lot better than all of the songs that you talkin in homie
Im just being real with you
Im just being cool
Ill take the elder wand out of Lord Voldemorts hand and Ill snap it in two
Bay to LA man thats North to the south you see us we linkin up
North to the south, we linkin up like the Korean peninsula
I aint got time for these whoa, I got someone thatll commit to me
The feeling is reciprocated I love her I hope that she stick with me
She probably wantin a gift from me man, she prolly want Tiffanys I gotta tell you
I talk about music too much to my lady she probably sick of me

[Monologue: Kuya Charles]
Listen up mofuckers. We HERE now. SAFE AND SOUND! I hope you niggas feel the pressure. WE TAKIN' OVER! AND THAT'S A FACT! Run it back
