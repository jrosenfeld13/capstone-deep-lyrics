Stare into the fishbowl that I bought for you
A 100 gallon tank is just the right size for you
I see your eyes swim back and for to me
They contemplate the universe through the glass green

Grandmother's witchboard revealed the truth of your lies
The morals of a call girl in disguise
Formaldehyde preserves you and keeps you close to me
You're my precious souvenir that no one else can see

I raise my chalice and I make a toast
Here's to Formaldehyde and the Holy Ghost
I raise my chalice and I make a toast
Here's to Formaldehyde and the Holy Ghost

I thought I'd lost you, I shed a thousand tears
But now I got you back and no one knows you're here
Late at night I hear you whispering to me
Plead for release with lifeless eyes and silent scream

I raise my chalice and I make a toast
Here's to Formaldehyde and the Holy Ghost
