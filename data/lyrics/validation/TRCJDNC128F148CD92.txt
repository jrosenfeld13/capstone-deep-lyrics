I feel used
I confess
Got my manhood
And yet
Out of place
Overdressed
Smoke alarm
Cigarettes

And when it brings you down
You'll learn to taste it

(Chorus)
Yeah
All worn out now nothing to prove
Yeah
Breathe in, breathe out, breakthrough

Look at me
Look at this
Nothing new
Nothing is

It's gonna bring you down
