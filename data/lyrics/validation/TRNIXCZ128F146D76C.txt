[Verse 1]
Blood sugar sucker fish in my dish
How many pieces do you wish
Step into a heaven where I keep it on the soul side
Girl please me, be my soul bride
Every woman has a piece of aphrodite
Copulate to create a state of sexual light
Kissing her virginity
My affinity
I mingle with the gods
I mingle with divinity

[Hook]
Blood sugar baby
She's magik
Sex magik sex magik

[Verse 2]
Glorious euphoria is my must
Erotic shock is a function of lust
Temporarily blind, dimensions to discover
In time, each into the other
Uncontrollable notes from her snow white throat
Fill a space in which two bodies float
Operatic by voice
A fanatic by choice
Aromatic is the flower
She must be moist

[Hook]
