Motivation, greed, pride
You don't care how many die
Mother Earth raped once more
Mutilated to the core

Never caring
Never sharing
Fill your pockets
With the stench of profit

Don't you see what you have done?
Blocking out the fucking sun
Savage progress, twisted fate
You won't see until it's too late

Never caring
Never sharing
Fill your pockets
And die
