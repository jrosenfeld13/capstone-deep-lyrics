Well we were born within one hour of each other
Our mothers said we could be sister and brother
Your name is Deborah, Deborah
It never suited ya
And they said that when we grew up
We'd get married, and never split up
We never did it, although often I thought of it

Oh Deborah, do you recall?
Your house was very small
With wood chip on the wall
When I came around to call
You didn't notice me at all

And I said let's all meet up in the year 2000
Won't it be strange when we're all fully grown
Be there 2 o'clock by the fountain down the road
I never knew that you'd get married
I would be living down here on my own
On that damp and lonely Thursday years ago

You were the first girl at school to get breasts
Martyn said that you were the best
The boys all loved you, but I was a mess
I had to watch them trying to get you undressed
We were friends, that was as far as it went
I used to walk you home sometimes but it meant
Oh, it meant nothing to you
Cause you were so popular

Deborah do you recall?
Your house was very small
With woodchip on the wall
When I came around to call
You didn't notice me at all

I said let's all meet up in the year 2000
Won't it be strange when we're all fully grown
Be there 2 o'clock by the fountain down the road
I never knew that you'd get married
I would be living down here on my own
On that damp and lonely Thursday years ago

Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Ah do you recall?
Your house was very small
With wood chip on the wall
When I came around to call
You didn't notice me at all

And I said let's all meet up in the year 2000
Won't it be strange when we're all fully grown
Be there 2 o'clock by the fountain down the road
I never knew that you'd get married
I would be living down here on my own
On that damp and lonely Thursday years ago

What are you doing Sunday baby
Would you like to come and meet me maybe?
You can even bring your baby
Ooh ooh oh. Ooh ooh ooh ooh. Ooh ooh ooh ooh. Ooh
