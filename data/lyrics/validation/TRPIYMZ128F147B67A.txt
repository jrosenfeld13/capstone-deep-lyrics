Jolly roger in a pickup
Has a packet on the horses
He's a docker with a bucket -
Just the ticket in a thicket

Silly sally isn't pally
With the crackers in the alley:
She's a smacker and a whacker -
Wouldn't dally with a slacker

Sally keeping in her locker
Little packets for the docker jolly roger
(looking pretty, just the sucker for a shocker)
