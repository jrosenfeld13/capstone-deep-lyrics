We can remember times and moments
And never clear our minds
We can't forget the joy and sorrow
Surrounding our lives
And if we stand the sky above us
We'll see them in another way
Like shining, flashing , shadows
Hurting down our hearts

Chrous : memories
Are real dream of life
Memories
Reminds me our night
All my life

And when our day is warm
Much longer we used to living for
Without any anger, any wonder
Everything was cool
But day by day
Of all lives
Fantasy is fading away
Like shining, flashing ,shadows
Hurting down our hearts

Chorus :
Holding to your memories
You got to be strong
Holding to your fantasies
And you can't go wrong
Holding to your memories
You got to be strong
Holding to your fantasies
And you can't go wrong

Chorus :
