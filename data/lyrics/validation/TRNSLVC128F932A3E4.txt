Train I ride, sixteen coaches long
Train I ride, sixteen coaches long
Well that long black train carried my baby from home

Train train, coming on 'round the bend
Train train, coming on 'round the bend
Well it took my baby, it's gon' do it again

Train train, coming on down the line
Train train, coming on down the line
Well it's bringing my baby, 'cause she's mine all mine
