Take my hand to the wondrous land
Of lollipop trees
Of peppermint flowers
All things make believe
Come with me, said a man with eyes that sparkled with glee
And rainbow lips that smiled up at me

Oh, tell me where he roams
The cobbler
Light of good hope

Say hello to gumdrops and trolls
And fountains of gold
And teacup boats on saucers of foam
Then we stole away to his home of wafers and cream
And he told me this wasn't a dream
