Narrow marrow
Silent sparrow
Secret serpentine smile
Distant crying child

You're my lost little love
You're my lost little one

Urgent arrow
Arcane echo
My, my, my have we thrown
Together apart
And together again

We will scatter friends
Like the whistling wind
You can see me wave
Same, I'm the same

But if I did
And I meet you there
You'll hold my hand
Pretend you understand
That I'm just one man
Still a boy perhaps
Simple silent humble human being

We will scatter friends
Like the whistling wind
You can see me wave
Same, I'm the same

And Eiffel Towers
And distant isles
And ocean miles
And mountain wilds
And film stars
And restless charge
Moving roaring
Soaring gone, gone, gone

And with built-in lion ears
I can hear you now
