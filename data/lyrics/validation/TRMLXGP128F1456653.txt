I'm running round in circles
Meeting people I see everyday
There's no-one left to talk to
Cause I allready know each word they'll say...

In the land of the living
There's a key
In the land of the living
To open me
In the land of the living
I will search no more
Cause it's you that I've been looking for
In the land of the living...

I'm running round in circles
Meeting people I see everyday
There's no-one left to talk to
Cause I allready know each word they'll say...

If only I could find the things I miss
There must be someplace where there's more to life than this...

In the land of the living
There's a key
In the land of the living
To open me
In the land of the living
I will search no more
Cause it's you that I've been looking for
In the land of the living...

I'm running round in circles
Going places I go everyday
Don't wanna be here anymore
I've got no reasons left to stay

If only I could find the things I miss
There must be someplace where there's more to life than this...

I will search no more... (x2)
Cause it's you that I've been looking for

In the land of the living
There's a key
In the land of the living
To open me
In the land of the living
I will search no more
Cause it's you that I've been looking for

In the land of the living
There's a key
In the land of the living
To open me
In the land of the living
I will search no more
Cause it's you that I've been looking for
In the land of the living!
