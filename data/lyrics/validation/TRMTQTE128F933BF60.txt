Tonight my heart well it broke like glass
I made a mistake that I'll never surpass
I'm floating in space unattached to the world
I cast off the memory of the spell of that girl
Whatever I get I guess it's what I deserve

I don't remember
Just what made it so hard before
I know you needed someone to take the fall
I know you needed someone to blame it on

I smashed the mirror just to look what's behind
Picked through the pieces just to see what I'd find
I found my heart and it broke like glass
I made that mistake that I'll never surpass
I let go of my grip on the past

I don't remember
Just what made it so hard before
I know you needed someone to take the fall
I know you needed someone to blame it on
Blame it on

Hey, hey don't you look away
Hey, hey I've got something to say

I don't remember
Just what made it so hard before
I know you needed someone to take the fall
I know you needed someone to blame it on
I don't remember
I don't remember
I don't remember
I know you needed someone to take the fall
