You must be the one I'm looking for
I can tell by your smile that you're the one
You're beautiful inside and out
Our love we share I will never doubt

There's nothing you'd ask for that I wouldn't do
These words I will promise and I swear to you
I love you

It's been awhile together we stay
My love for you grows stronger everyday
You know by now that I'm always here
No need to cry, no room for fear
