[Verse 1: ThePrettyBrownBoy]
Hopped on the beat now knowing what to do
Got the flow rolling so now i'm coming through
Lyrically Enlightened yeah that's my fucking crew
You better step your game up or we'll be stepping over you
Our flows are so true
Starting up so we're new
Why you bumpin' old stuff that shit is passed due
Your squad belongs in a zoo
Your girl was feelin' kinda blue
So I took your place last night and she said I see you grew
Just kidding I would never put myself on your level
I stay lifted off the ground while you chillin' with the devil
Your music sounds like it has no bass only treble
While my songs stay upgrading homie I never settle
I'm trying hard in this rap game
One verse of mine can put all of your songs into shame
Blank is better than me but I don't see no name
A lot of corruption in this world but who is there to blame
And me and my crew aiming to be the greatest
To get passed out troubles we stay medicated
We show love to all the people who have hated
Reppin' Lyrically Enlightened like I recently stated

[Hook: ThePrettyBrownBoy]
In most cases they call me a game changer
When I come in writtin' bars these rappers are in danger
Killin' these beats call me annihilator
I stay holding shit together like a damn stapler x2

[Verse 2: ThePrettyBrownBoy]
Let me kick it off by saying that I spit so raw
To all you haters talkin' loud i'm gonna need you to withdraw
You know my beast mode on I rarely ever take it off
I'm always reppin' west coast and my flows are never soft
All I have to say is that you haters talkin' that mad shit
So I will retaliate and bring on the madness
I'll take away everything and leave you with the sadness
And after that you can tell me that my flows the baddest
So you know I spit this fasho
Don't hesitate to kick in the door
I'm getting tired of these rappers talkin' about their dough
No one cares about your hoes
I wanna see if you can actually flow
And talk about that real shit that is kept on the low
So I guess I should continue to rap huh
I go hard in the booth even though I don't own one
My raps stay hotter than the sun
Won't ever back down in a fight homie I won't ever run
And i'm just getting started i'm far from done
I think that's enough rapping i've had my fun
Just kidding homies I won't quit until i've won
Only use my fist won't ever pick up a gun
I came through vicious with an accurate flow
Just in case you listeners didn't already know
I listened to these rappers and pulled a van gooh
And now these niggas shook oh you mad bro

[Hook: ThePrettyBrownBoy]
In most cases they call me a game changer
When I come in writtin' bars these rappers are in danger
Killin' these beats call me annihilator
I stay holding shit together like a damn stapler x2
