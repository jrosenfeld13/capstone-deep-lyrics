We're barely halfway there
You're stretched out and clamped around me
I don't think there's drink at home
You make a little snore and shift
Just keep your head down there - you sleep
I'll give directions
I'll use the private miles to plan some tactics and a gift
I'll move around you
Attack and surround you

She talked me back inside
- thank f**k our friends are nosy
Any reaction's good
- it's a stupid way to make me say it
Did we go far enough?
Did it just serve it's purpose?
If the words are still a problem
I'll cut it out and let you weight it
