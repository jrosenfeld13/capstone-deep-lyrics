[Verse]
He's just a young boy out of school hes very naughty
Living his world like he wants to
They're making laws, but they don't understand
Turns a boy in to a fighting man
They won't take me
They won't break me
No one could tell him what to do
Had to learn everything the hard way
He's on the street, breaking all the rules
I'm telling you that he's nobody's fool
They won't take me
They won't break me
Now he's leaving, getting out from this masquerade
Oh got to go
I'm finally out in the clear and I'm free
I've got dreams I'm living for
I'm moving on where they'll never find me
Rolling on to anywhere
I'll break away, yes I'm on my way
Leaving today, yes I'm on my way
Just when you think you had it all figured out
Running scared can change your mind
I never knew I had so much to give
How hard times can fool ya
Oh I'm okay, I'm alright
Feeling good out on your own

[Outro]
I'll break away, I'll break away tonight
I've got dreams I'm living for
I'll break away
Yes, I'm on my way
I'm leaving, leaving today
Yes, I'm on my way
This is my escape
Yes, I'm on my way
I'll break away
Yes, I'm on my way
