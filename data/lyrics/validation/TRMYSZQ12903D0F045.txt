[Verse 1]
Jack Candy was as old as my father
But still I took a likin' to him
He said: "You will be somebody's treasure
But no one has discovered you yet."

Jack Candy lived on Sky Valley Road
And that's where he did business I guess
Some say he sold a suitcase of cocaine
But he never showed me any of that

[Chorus]
This is a story that I've prayed to tell
This is a story that I've prayed to tell
About the day they drove him from this town
About the day I lost: Jack Candy

[Verse 2]
I was walkin' up to Jack Candy's trailer
When he shouted that I('d) better head home
The curtains closed as he went back inside
And I trembled 'cause he wasn't alone

[Chorus]
This is a story that I've prayed to tell
This is a story that I've prayed to tell
About the day they drove him from this town
About the day I lost: Jack Candy

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Some say they took him out to a clearin'
And made him crawl until he confessed
Some say they hung him up by his bootstraps
Some say they let him swing in the wind

I walked along (the) Sky Valley Road
And out onto the great northern bridge
And for hours I stared into the cold
Sick and tired of denying I loved him

[Chorus]
This is a story that I've prayed to tell
This is a story that I've prayed to tell
About the day they drove him from this town
About the day they drove him from this town

I've lived a lie and I have lived it well
This is the story that I've prayed to tell
About a love and how I let him down
About the day I lost: Jack Candy
