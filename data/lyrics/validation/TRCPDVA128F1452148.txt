Along the avenue of hope
The footsteps falter, the fingers grope
And the days stretch out beneath the sun
No one's born, and no one dies
No one loves so no one cries
And we wait to see just what we will become

Don't let me falter, don't let me ride
Don't let the earth in me subside
Let me see just who I will become

You're like the clouds in my home town
You just grow fat and hang around
And your days stretch out beneath the sun

And no one's born, and no one dies
No one loves so no one cries
And we wait to see just what we will become

Don't let me borrow, don't let me bring
Don't let me wallow, don't make me sing
Let me see just who I will become

Don't let me falter, don't let me hide
Don't let someone else decide
Just who or what I will become

Don't make them borrow, don't make them bring
Don't let them wallow, don't let them sing
Let them stretch out beneath the sun
