Could it be a stranger night?
The basements filled with kids
I don't know
Not beautiful like your songs
But all awkward and alone and don't belong
I saw a vacant seat
I sat down next to you
I thought of all the boys that wanted to
I laughed out loud
Do you hate this band too?
I smiled a nervous smile
But I warmed up and acted cool standing by the stove
And your eyes made it strange and I felt out of place
Wondering if you... if you could take her place
You can't be sly
You can't forget her
You don't ask why
You can't forget her
Give up
What hope do you have to save her?
Give up
What hope do you have to save her?
