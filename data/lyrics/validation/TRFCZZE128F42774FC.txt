Up the stairs
"Can I help ya, son?"
To her apartment
"Yeah, pops, I, I need something quick
Something now..."
She is balled up on the couch
"Quick."
Her mom and dad
"...to get out of here..."
Went down to Charlotte
"Quick and now."
They're not home to find us out
"..like a bike or, or a motorcycle or.."
And we drive
"Bike, I haven't got any bikes, haven't got any motorcycles."
Now that I have found someone
"Well, something you gotta have in..."
And I'm feeling more alone
"Well.."
"..behind all this junk around, I..
"Junk!?"
Then I ever have before

"Let me tell ya something about junk, son. See this shit around here, you think it's shit? I think you're shit. Little turd dropper. I'll show ya what I got here, I got something faster than a damn bicycle for ya, I got this here."

"What the hell is that?"
"It's a rubber sled!"
"A rubber sled?"
"Rubber sled, that's right."
"Is it fast?"
"Is it fast? Shit. That damn thing's faster than a three peckered owl. And you know what else?"
"What?"
"The best part?"
"What's the best part?"
"It's free! Ha ha ha-ha!"

Rubb-

"That's right, take your rubber sled and ride on, ride on, my man..."

Rubb-

"Thanks for the sled, pops."
"Hey, no problem, come back."
