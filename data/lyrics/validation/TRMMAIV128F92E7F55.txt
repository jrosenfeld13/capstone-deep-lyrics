Yes it's been a long damn time
Ain't been around cos' I work for my money!
I'd love to stay but I'm really runnin' short on time
And I hear you've got a new man
He's like a new-age hippie
And he's rollin' in the money
No... I don't really hold a grudge
It's just hard for me...

I feel like you already died...
I feel like you already died...
I feel like you already died!...
I know it works out bad sometimes
I'm glad we're friends
Cos' we're hateful as lovers
I walk away knowing everything I said was lies!
My heart and my mind have been all twisted...
I can't get no sleep...
I found the lighting in the grass line!...
There's a blackness passing over me
I've been transformed...
