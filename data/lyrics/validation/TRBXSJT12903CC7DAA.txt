What can I say when I can't find the words
To possibly explain what I'm feeling inside?
I tried to believe, my hope got flattened everyday that passed me by
And then you came in my life

And now I am living proof
Of what the gift of pure love can do

When I needed an angel it was you who made the sacrifice
Just in the nick of time
When I needed an angel I didn't have to look to the sky
'Cause you made me realize that you were right here all the time
Right here all the time, right here all the time

Sometimes I cry when I think about everything you've done for me
And I still can't believe that I can live my life
Every breath I take, I take for you and me
That's a promise I'll keep

And each night I think of you
And how your gift of love pulled me through

When I needed an angel it was you who made the sacrifice
Just in the nick of time
When I needed an angel I didn't have to look to the sky
'Cause you made me realize you were right here all the time
Right here all the time, right here all the time

Maybe one day everyone will say that I wanna be somebody's angel
And I will tell the world about this miracle
Every moment I'm awake I'll give the love you gave, oh angel

When I needed an angel it was you who made the sacrifice
Just in the nick of time
When I needed an angel I didn't have to look to the sky
'Cause you made me realize that you were right here all the time
You were right here all the time
