[Verse 1]
It's raining today
And I'm just about to forget
The train window girl
That wonderful day we met
She smiles through the smoke
From my cigarette

[Verse 2]
It's raining today
But once there was summer and you
And dark little rooms
And sleep in late afternoons
Those moments descend
On my window pane

[Bridge]
I've hung around too long
Listening to the old landlady's hard-luck stories
You out of me, me out of you
We go like lovers
To replace the empty space
Repeat our dreams to someone new

[Verse 3]
It's raining today
And I watch the cellophane streets
No hang-ups for me
'cause hang-ups need company
The street corner girl's
A cold trembling leaf

[Outro]
It's raining today
It's raining today
