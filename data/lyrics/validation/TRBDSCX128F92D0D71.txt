Let's go for a little walk
Under the moon of love
Let's sit down and talk
Under the moon of love
I wanna tell ya
That I love ya
And I want you to be my girl
Little darling let's walk
Let's talk
Under the moon of love
You look so lovely
Under the moon of love
Your eyes shine so brightly
Under the moon of love
I wanna go all the time
You'll be my love tonight
Little darling let's walk
Let's talk
Under the moon of love
I wanna talk sweet talk
Whisper things in your ear
I wanna tell ya the things
I know you've been waiting to hear
Come on little darling take my hand
Let's go for a little walk . .
