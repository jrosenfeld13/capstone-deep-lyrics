[Intro]
And Jackie, and Jackie, and Jackie, ha-hmm
And Jackie, and Jackie, and Jackie, hey

[Verse 1]
A Bouvier 'til her wedding day
Shots rang out, the police came
Mama laid me on the front lawn
And prayed for Jackies strength
Feeling old by 21
Never thought my day would come
My bridesmaids getting laid
I pray for Jackies strength

[Chorus]
Make me laugh
Say you know what you want
You said we were the real thing
So I show you some more and I learn
What black magic can do
Make me laugh
Say you know you can turn
Me into the real thing
So I show you some more and I learn

[Verse 2]
Stickers licked on lunch boxes
Worshipping David Cassidy
Yeah, I mooned him once on Donnas box
Shes still in recovery
Sleepovers Beenes got some pot
Youre only popular with anorexia
So I turn myself inside out
In hope someone will see, will see

[Chorus]
Make me laugh
Say you know what you want
You said we were the real thing
So I show you some more and I learn
What black magic can do
Make me laugh
Say you know you can turn
Me into the real thing
So I show you some more and I learn

[Bridge]
And Jackie, and Jackie, and Jackie's strength
And Jackie, and Jackie, and Jackie, hey

[Verse 3]
I got lost on my wedding day
Typical, the police came out
But virgins always get backstage
No matter what theyve got to say
If you love enough youll lie a lot
Guess they did in Camelot
Mamas waiting on my front lawn
I pray, I pray, I said I pray for Jackies strength, strength

[Chorus]
Make me laugh
Say you know what you want
You said we were the real thing
So I show you some more and I learn

[Outro]
And Jackie, and Jackie, and Jackie's strength
And Jackie, and Jackie, and Jackie, hey
