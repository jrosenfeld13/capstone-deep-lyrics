Pro servis neque bello captos habent nisi ab ipsis gesto
A life long love
A belief til your death
Live your life a lie
To compensate for your faults
Sacrifice all that's true
For something you can give yourself
Faith we must not compromise
Our inner strenght
For your unwritten laws
It means nothing to me
Just another handed down generation after generation
Believe in yourself
You're trained
By their overpowering way to control
Can't you see your ignorance
Is weakening our chance for survival?
