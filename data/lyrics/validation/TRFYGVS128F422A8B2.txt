Headshrinker workin' my flava try to rearrange my psych try to voodoo my child
Bloodletter fryin' my egg chewin' my leg leechin' off my pain suckin' my brain
Big thinker masqueradin' mannequin manipulator dominator slave trader breakin' me takin' me

I don't need all your therapy
I'm alright without your insight
I was fine 'till you took my mind - that's when it shrunk

Chain me crack your whip on my bad trip taking me away reshapin' my clay
You're diggin' through me like a squatbug siftin through mindmud looking for a shiftkit - finding it

I don't need all your therapy
I'm alright without your insight
I was fine 'till you took my mind - that's when it shrunk

Disablin' me you keep labelin' me you keep stickerin' me vandalizin' my skull
Tag me bag me drag me on down and ya finger my head like a 10 pound ball
You got a term for everything I think wormin' your way into my say clashin' my wave
Crushin' my skeleton shadowin' my light blurrin' my sight splinterin' my crutches

I don't need all your therapy
I'm alright without your insight
I was fine 'till you took my mind - that's when it shrunk

A frown is a smile in an upside-down world
