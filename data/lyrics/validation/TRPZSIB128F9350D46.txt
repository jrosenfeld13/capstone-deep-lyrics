ONCE UPON A TIME UPON A HILL
FAR WAY
AN UNFAIR PROPOSTION
BEFORE A RIGHTEOUS MAN
WAS MADE
COULD'VE CHANGED HIS
SITUATION
BUT INSTEAD HE CHOSE TO OBEY AT
THE GREAT EXCHANGE
AN ETERNITIY HE TRAVELED TO
BE THERE AT THAT PLACE
THE CHOSEN DESTINATION TO
SHOW MANKIND GOD'S GRACE
HIS LONGING TO REDEEM US
COULD ONLY BE EXPLAINED AT
THE GREAT EXCHANGE
CHORUS
AT THE GRAET EXCHANGE
EVEN THEN HE KNEW ME AND
HE BORE SUCH PAIN
AND HE DID IT ALL FOR LOVE
AN UNDESERVING SERVANT
WHO'LL NEVER BE THE SAME
SINCE THE GREAT EXCHANGE
I WALKED THAT SAME HILLSIDE
AS I KNELT DOWN TO PRAY
HE SHOWED ME ALL THE WRONG
I'D DONE AND THE PRICE HE
PAID THAT DAY
AND THEN I AROSE FORGIVEN
HIS LOSS BECAME MY GAIN AT
THE GREAT EXCHANGE
EVERYTHING THAT MANKIND
LOST, JESUS HAS RECLAIMED
THE PATHWAY TO ETERNITY BY
HIS DEATH ARRANGED
AND ALL OF THIS HE OFFERS, IF
YOU'LL MEET HIM TODAY AT
THE GREAT EXCHANGE
