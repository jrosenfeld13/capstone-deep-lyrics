[Introduction]
Ahem
Ladies and gentleman
Boys and girls
It is my pleasure to introduce you all
The finest, the ripest, the meanest
The strongest, the very best of them all
The South London collective group known as...
For goodness sake, Roger, who is it?

[Hook]
This is Big Bro (Bro)
Taking over the show (show)
With this nu flow (flow)
You need to listen up and feel this shit (shit)
Cos' we won't quit (quit)
We make them hits
And stack them chips
Who's this?

[Verse 1: Flawless]
It's Flawless, I came for the dough
As soon as I step in the door
I see that you're hating my glow
The crew, the flow, we're soon to blow
We're tired of being this poor
And having to sleep on the floor
And working a 9 to 5
Just like a five dollar whore
Knowing we're worth more
We simply had to settle the score
That's why you see these albums
And the singles in the store (buy it)
It's Big Brova, baby
Trying to cash some major figures
You mess with my cheese
And I'll switch just like Schwarzenegger

[Verse 2: Dion & Cherise]
It's Dion, I bet you won't forget my name
I'm probably maybe going to get inside your brain
My family does the same
It's BB's time to reign
We're doing them platinum things
I know you ain't ready for me
You move, you lose
Can't wear my shoes
Cherise, brand new
Me and my crew
Don't try our flow
If your tongue don't roll
You'll lose control
We're just way too cold

[Verse 3: J-Rock]
Hey, yo, this is J-Rock
And I've got more skills than average
Put us together, man
We're more than all of y'all can manage
'Cos we be the baddest at it
This hit took years of practice
And now we're showing more money
And it's more madness
Stack up on a daily basis
We travel so many places
Switching so many chicks
We're mixing up the names with faces
'Cos they see the ice and they trip
They like to ride in the whip
But all I want to know is
If these girls is riding the (ahhh)

Who's, who's, who's this?

[Verse 4: Nadia]
This is the N.A.D.I.A
You didn't think I was coming at you
Giving you people a different
Kind of Big Brova flavour
I bet y'all didn't think
I be riding these beats and making all paper
But I guess that I'm a paper chaser
Player, and it's in my nature

Uh uh, uh huh
Uh uh, uh huh

Uh uh, uh huh
Who's, who's this?
