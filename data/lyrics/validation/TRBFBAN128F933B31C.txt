Tend your figure religiously
Stillborn sisters- you buried three
Survived by stumbling divinity
I came to you both accidentally

Haunted wombs and barren seeds
Yet through the term you carried me
Conjugally conceived he had prayed you'd bleed
And your second child came with a pair of teeth

And round his ankles you were tethered me
You must have known he'd leave eventually
Because everything you love leaves
(everything you love leaves)
