Somewhere in the night your voice is miles away
Rendered from the dust it will be dust again
Spoken like a lullaby
Infinite as sky on sky
Somewhere in the night how sweet you sing for me

Tender as the smile that drifts across your face
Fleeting as the wind that passes on the plains
Never to be ball and chain
Never to be seen again
Somewhere in the night how sweet you sing for me

Oh you may ask but I won't say
Oh in the still of the cool day

Deep inside a dream I swore I was awake
Waking to the tune I hear your voice again
Lifted by a sudden breeze
Tangled in the cypress trees
Somewhere in the night how sweet you sing for me

Oh you may ask but I can't say
Oh in the still of the cool day
Ba da da da da da da da
