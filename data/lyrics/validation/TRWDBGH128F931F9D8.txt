[Verse One]
Try to hold us back will be the last thing you did
It's gon' be a major problem in the worst kind of way
People seem to forget, the problems of the world, until they
Scheme and forget your diamonds and your pearls
Now a days in the streets there's no code of honor
No more men amongst men, no respect for they mama
Want chips for fame, whips on dubs
Guns, drugs and motherfuckers want love
See people always seem to want a lot for a little
No respect, no manners, loyalty and no principles
No class, nothing for that ass
One man's treasure is the next man's trash
Like one man's death is the next man's life
Life one man's hoe is the next man's wife
Still, no class, nothing for that ass
But one man's treasure is the next man's trash

[Hook]
I'll live for, I'll die for, my people, my people shit
You need to know
Niggas need to know
Got love, get sex, got war, get crazy
Got niggas, got fine ass ladies
Shit, you need to know
Niggas, you need to know

[Verse Two]
Ayo it kills me to see good niggas lose freedom
Lose a life so young and they ain't really do nothing
Snakes in the grass, snitches in the streets
Flowers on the wall, jealousy in [?]
It's like a motherfucker played like man made AIDS
People kill and get paid, many piss on the grave
Smile in your face, screaming "ride or die"
Nigga changing they face
Why they lied on my nigga?
Niggas in the hood that'll play real tough
But they tell everything when they in them handcuffs
Smile in your face screaming "ride or die"
Nigga changing they face
Why they lied on my nigga?

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Having raw sex, drinking liquor smoking cigarettes
It ain't funny what people do for the money
Lie, cheat, steal in the land, kill or be killed
Hoes on the tracks selling pussy for the bills
Said you don't wanna do it don't do it while you doing it
Some pushing you, keeping your soul from soaring
It's truth, why you fighting if the battle ain't fair?
See the wars want counsel, motherfucker I don't care
To this monstrous life shit will always be a part of me
Like when dope fiends pumping shit in they arteries
And as for the ladies, shit I get 'em all day
And I ain't pumping out songs like Fifty or Jay
Look

[Hook]
