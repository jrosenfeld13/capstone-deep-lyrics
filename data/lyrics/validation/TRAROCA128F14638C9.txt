When I am sad and weary
When all my hope is gone
And I can't put my finger
On the time things first went wrong
I have a little secret
I like to tell myself
And until now I haven't told anybody else

You may not see things my way
Like my method or my reasons
But you can't tell me that I'm wrong

There's no heart you can't melt
With a certain little smile
And no challenge should be faced
Without a little charm and a lot of style
So don't put your faith in time
She heals but doesn't change
And only a fool won't take the
Chance to stay the same

When I am sad and weary
When all my hope is gone
I walk around my house
And think of you with nothing on
And I have a list of things
I go over in my mind
When I can just sit right back
And watch the world unwind

You may not see things my way
I don't care 'cause I'm not asking
But you can't tell me that I'm wrong

There's no heart you can't melt
With a certain little smile
And no challenge should be faced
Without a little charm and a lot of style
So don't put your faith in time
She heals but doesn't change
And only a fool won't take the
Chance to stay the same

There's no heart you can't melt
With a certain little smile
And no challenge should be faced
Without a little charm and a lot of style
So don't put your faith in time
She heals but doesn't change
And only a fool won't take the
Chance to stay the same

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
