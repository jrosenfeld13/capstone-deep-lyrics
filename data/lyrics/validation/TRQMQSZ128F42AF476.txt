[Intro]
Dang, that's a shame what you doin' to that hula hoop
Dang, that's a shame what you doin' to that hula hoop

[Verse 1]
Watch when they walk by
Guys get the wondering eye
They rather get smacked then not look back
Tell you whats up with that
They see that wobble wobble
Shaped just like a cola bottle
Thought you was a model
Itty bitty waist
Hip-hips all in they face

[Pre-Chorus]
That's gonna get them boys in trouble
Get his attention on the double
She got a walk so mean gotta see it to believe
(Hey)

[Chorus:]
She got them
Baby makin' hips
Ba-baby baby makin' hips
She got them baby makin' hips
When she walk, they watchin' and she knows it
She got them baby makin' hips
Ba-baby baby makin' hips
Watch her watch her work them curves
Don't be mad you got some nerves

[Verse 2]
Strut without a care
Gloss them lips slick back that hair
That suit fits you like a mitten
Got them wishing picturing you with them
Caught em watching
Like that dude, I bet you got 'em
Wrapped around your French manicure finger tips
That boy like em thick

[Pre-Chorus]
That's gonna get them boys in trouble
Get his attention on the double
She got a walk so mean gotta see it to believe
(Hey)

[Chorus:]
She got them
Baby makin' hips (she got)
Ba-baby baby makin' hips (we got)
She got them baby makin' hips (and when she walks)
When she walk, they watchin' and she knows it
(They watching, yes, they watching)
She got them baby makin' hips (we can't help it)
Ba-baby baby makin hips
Watch her watch her work them curves (ooh yeah)
Don't be mad you got some nerve

[Bridge]
You gotta feel like he really wanna get it
If he with it, then you get 'em and go, go
Just put it on 'em, too late to warn him
Time to show them boys how you roll
That's it, that's it, just like that (come on girl)
That's it, that's it, just like that (work 'em out)
That's it, that's it, just like that (yeah)
Wait a minute
Better hold him with those

[Chorus]
She got them
Baby makin' hips (baby)
Ba-baby baby makin' hips (baby makin)
She got them baby makin' hips (ooh wee cutie)
When she walk they watchin and she knows it
She got them baby makin hips
(she got em, she got em)
Ba baby baby makin hips
(we got em, we got em)
Watch her watch her work them curves
Dont be mad you got some nerve (ooh wee cutie)

[Outro]
Dang, that's a shame what you doin' to that hula hoop
Dang, that's a shame what you doin' to that hula hoop
Dang, that's a shame what you doin' to that hula hoop
Dang, that's a shame what you doin' to that hula hoop
