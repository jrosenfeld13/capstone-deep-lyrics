Sing that song a gotta gotta you get along baby
Shove that tongue a straight a to the back of my head
You got tongue a honey honey use that tongue baby
Climb on top and rock a rolla me til I'm dead

Girl I'm melting away
And you're fine and grown
Hey now you whisper your dirt
And I'll do you strong

Sing that song a firecracker sing that song a baby
You got smoke that drives a monkey out of his head
Dig yourself a kinda like a I do yourself baby
The king of dreams a gotta have queen of the bed

Babe I'm melting away
And your fine and grown
Hey now you scream out your
Dirt until I explode

Slut machine to keep my lovin strong
Slut machine to keep my lovin strong
Slut machine to keep my lovin strong
Slut machine to keep my lovin strong

Slut machine to keep my lovin strong
Slut machine to keep my lovin strong
Slut machine to keep my lovin strong
Slut machine to keep my lovin strong

Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
