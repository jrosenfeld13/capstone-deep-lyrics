By the time I close my eyes
Sarah Bellum's rested
She owes no apologies
She must do what's best
For all I know she has a baby at her breast

Sarah Bellum, yes, I'm looking for you
I won't be lonely in the meantime
If it's really you, you will understand

Daylight comes exposing me just kicking it with clowns
Some would rise in Sarah's eyes but most would scan the ground

By the time I start to rise
Her hair is washed and her hair is dried
Slipping from her gown she stretches out her arms and sighs
For all I know she has a husband by her side
