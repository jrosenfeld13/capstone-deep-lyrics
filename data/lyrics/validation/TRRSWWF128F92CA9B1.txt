Never said I knew
All the right things to do
But I know when
Somethings wrong
Why would you choose
Some knew it that you lose, once again
My trust is gone (?)
You're never gonna change
'cause you made up your mind
Ain't no body stoppin' you
Crossing that line

(chorus:)
You're steppin' over
To the other side
We left a trail
It only appeals
To how it makes you feel inside
I know although it seems
The grass is growin' and its always green
You're steppin' over

Wish I knew the way
And all the right things to say
Only no way you'd hear what I'd say
I remember when you
Used to be a friend i could talk to
And I trusted you
See, it doesn't matter
Did you want it this way
Ain't nobody stoppin' you
Take it away

(chorus)
Step on over, it's all yours
No one can touch you in your world
You're safe inside
Don't even take the time
To think about what you left
On your way to paradise

I've been hopin'
When you open your eyes
That you see it right
I was hopin'
I keep dreamin
To set it aside, stop feelin' alive
Only i'm lying to myself
If it doesn't matter
Then your losing your mind
Ain't nobody stopin' you
Cross that line

(chorus X2)
