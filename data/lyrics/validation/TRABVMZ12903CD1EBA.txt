[Verse 1]
Born in a window
Nobody's fool
Raised in a prison
You called a school
Taught your religion
Told what to do
I handed my childhood
Over to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Traveling endlessly, I'm searching for mind
I'm almost afraid of what I will find
Wandering aimlessly, oh, what can I do?
I handed my future over to you, to you

[Chorus]
Over to you
Future looks blue
What can I do?

[Verse 2]
Working for freedom
Fighting your wars
Feeding our children
Keeping your laws
Someday youll suffer
Then what Ill do
Ill hand all your promises
Over to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Standing inside myself, I'm losing control
You made me believe in the stories you told
Waiting impatiently, what else can I do?
I handed my future over to you, to you

[Chorus]
Over to you
Future looks blue
What can I do?

[Verse 3]
Tears full of sadness
Sealed in my cell
Whispering secrets
What do they tell
Mad politicians
Cant tell it true
I handed my children
Over to you

[Outro]
All over, over to you
All over, over to you
All over, over to you...
