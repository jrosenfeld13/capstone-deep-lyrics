Don't you know you're such a fool
To keep on acting like you do
Don't you know you're such a fool
To keep on acting like you do
You're a fool to play things cool
When you've got everything to lose

You hurt the ones you love the most
Every time you lose your head
Hurt the ones you love the most
Every time you lose your head
Well you shoot them down when they're too close
And you've lost another friend

Told the girl you love the best
That she could never get inside of you
Told the girl you love the best
She'll never get inside of you
And you started to regret
And you began to think things through

Lord what a stupid thing to do
What a stupid thing to do
Lord what a stupid thing to do
What a thing for me to do
What a thing for me to do
Lord what a stupid thing to do
What a thing for me to do
