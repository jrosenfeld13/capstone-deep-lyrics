Ooh oh ooh oh
I warned you, you didn't believe me
I warned you, you didn't believe me
I warned you, you didn't believe me
I warned you, and now you're caught

There's some people that you just can't trust
But some people talk way too much
Take my advice, and listen up
Don't be a fool like the rest of us
Now listen up

Ooh on the playground
Ooh on the playground
You learn so much

Now listen up
Now gather 'round
Listen up
Gather round, now

1, 2, 3 - take it from me
3, 4 - so much trouble in store
4, 5 - get it right
The first time, count it with me now

Ooh oh ooh oh

Everybody knows someone like that
Who borrows money and won't pay you back
They'll talk about at the drop of a hat
Lie about it to your face, when there caught

There's some people that you just can't trust
But some people just talk too much
Take my advice, and listen up
Don't be a fool like the rest of us
Now listen up

Ooh on the playground
Ooh on the playground

You learn so much
Now listen up
Now gather 'round
Now listen up
Gather round now

1, 2, 3 - take it from me
3, 4 - so much trouble in store
4, 5 - let's get it right
The first time, Count it with me now
