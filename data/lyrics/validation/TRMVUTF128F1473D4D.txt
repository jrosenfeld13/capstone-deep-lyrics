Up middle finger I show them
Back in the day, they didn't wanna know
They wanna dis Bound 4 da reload
They wanna talk to Neutrino
No no no
They wanna dis so solid so
No no no

Didn't wanna back we
Now they beg friend
Up middle finger I show them
Back in the day, they didn't wanna know
They wanna dis Bound 4 da reload
They wanna talk to oxide-o
No no no

No no no

The garage scene well
It's really fucked up
Certain guys can't
Won't keep their mouths shut
All they do is talk about we
Something about we're novelty cheesy
Smelling your top lip
Stop the jealousy
What, cause we didn't start from 1983
Oh, fuck me I was in my nappy
Did I mention we're only 18?
Carnival '99 DJs
Put up a list telling
Other DJs not to play this
But when I asked
A certain DJ why he gave me a
Shit reply

Later a bitch said to me
We'll never make it with Casualty
Ha ha ha, he he he
Now the silly bitch
Wants to try and hire we

(chorus)

Certain guys can't
Face the fact of
What we've done
Sold over a quarter
Of a million Casualty went
Straight into No 1
And they still wanna cuss come on
Oh yeah but the Casualty theme
What network controls the scene
So you do what you want
And you do what like
And you do what you please

Yeah, guys want to
Cuss our tunes
Say it's shit
Think other people don't like it
But boy we don't care
And we got something for you
This is DJ Oxide myself playing in
Front of about a hundred thousand people
Listen to this

When I say you say
We say they say
Make some noise
When I say you say
We say they say
Make some noise
When I say you say
We say they say
Make some noise
When I say you say
We say they say
Make some noise

(chorus)

Hey that was
Oxide and Neutrino
