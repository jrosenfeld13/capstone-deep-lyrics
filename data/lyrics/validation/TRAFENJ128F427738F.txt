Born to work under the way your velvet lies
Smoke and fog, getting hazy in the sky, arise

I've been where you've never been
I've seen what you never seen
I've dreamed what you never dream
I've left what you never leave
But now I can only find one way to take me higher

Rays of shattered light to clean my eyes
This spark just burns away until I'm blind inside

I've seen what you never seen
I've been where you've never been
I've dreamed what you never dream
I've left what you never leave
But now I can only find one way to take me higher

There's only a reflection left to hide
Once you know the aim, I told you it's still mine

I've seen what you never seen
I've been where you've never been
I've left what you never leave
I've dreamed what you've never dreamed
But now I can only find one way to take me higher
But now I can only find one way
Take me higher, take me higher, take me higher
