Big tall man standing in the street
Gun hanging on by his side
Just one man that he'd like to meet
That's when I began to hide

I recognized him from the face of his son
The hate in his eye didn't lie
And what I did can't be undone
Borrowed time, there's none to buy

Well, I hid around the back of a derelict shack
Ain't looking for a mad showdown
But he was smart, he'd already checked
A week in advance I'd paid down

Well, the hotel clerk was a fun-loving man
The job he had it didn't pay
He told all about what happened that night
There he is, that's the one's all he'd say

Well, all the people were
Running, jumping, even thumping
On my bad neighbor's doors
Crying curly Billy silly with his colt he calls filly
Let me in I gotta hide

Well, everybody was
Crying, sighing Sam McGee's dying
No one to protect our town
Curly Billy silly with his colt he calls filly
He's gonna shoot your sheriff down

Big tall man standing in the street
Now a hand hovering ready to slide
Drew out his gun, it wasn't for fun
Let me in there's nowhere to hide

Well, I made my play but it wasn't my day
I felt the ripping lead
That's when I knew my time was through
Rest in peace were the last words he said

Well, all the people were
Running, jumping, even thumping
On my bad neighbor's doors
Crying curly Billy silly with his colt he calls filly
Let me in I gotta hide

Well, everybody was
Crying, sighing Sam McGee's dying
No one to protect our town
Curly Billy silly with his colt he calls filly
He's gonna shoot your sheriff down

Well, all the people were
Running, jumping, even thumping
On my bad neighbor's doors
Crying curly Billy silly with his colt he calls filly
Let me in I gotta hide

Well, everybody was
Crying, sighing Sam McGee's dying
No one to protect our town
Curly Billy silly with his colt he calls filly
He's gonna shoot your sheriff down

Running, jumping, even thumping
On my bad neighbor's doors
Crying curly Billy silly with his colt he calls filly
Let me in I gotta hide

Well, everybody was
Crying, sighing Sam McGee's dying
