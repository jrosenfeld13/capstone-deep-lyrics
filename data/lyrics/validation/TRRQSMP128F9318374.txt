Honey, baby, I been told
You know how, shake the butter bowl
I got to see for myself
If you got any butter left

Breakdown to the left
Breakdown to the right
Breakdown to the one
Gonna love her tonight

Do the breakdown, children
Break on down
Do the breakdown, children
Break on down

You got it going, my, my, my
Just look around and grab your guy
Stop where you are, let your big hip rock
Show him how your love can rock

Breakdown for me

Breakdown to the one
Gonna give it to

Do the breakdown, children
Break on down
Do the breakdown, children
Break on down, [Incomprehensible]

Come on children, look at me

Do it in the evening, late at night
I'm gonna show you, breakdown is alright

Do the breakdown, children
Break on down
Do the breakdown, children
Break on down

Listen, it's the brand new dance that's going around
It ain't the 'Funky Chicken', it's called 'The Breakdown'
It's the brand new dance that's going around
It ain't push and pull, it's called 'The Breakdown'

Now breakdown, children
Break on down
Breakdown, children
Break on down

Mama can do it, Papa too
Grandma, Grandpa, they're doing it too
Mama, Mama, just look at Sis
She's in the backyard breaking down like this

Breakdown, children
Break on down
Breakdown, children
Break on down
Breakdown, children
