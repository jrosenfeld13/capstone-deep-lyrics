(GUITAR INTRO)

Your voice whispers

Words to make me believe

Nothin's different

Nothin's changed with you and me

The look in your eyes

Tells me what you can't hide

And I feel my heartbeat out of time

I feel lost if not forgotten

I can't find us, where are we

Where are we, are you still here

Our love is drowning in tears

Once you gave me the promise of your love

Now my eyes are open

Where are you, where am I, where are we

In the darkness

Someone led you astray

Someone thoughtless

Of the price we'd have to pay

Tears of sorrow, tears of regret

Are slowly washing our lives away

We'll be picking up the pieces

When we find them, where are we

Where are we, are you still here

Our love is drowning in tears

Once you gave me the promise of your love

Now my eyes are open

Where are you, where am I, where are we

(GUITAR SOLO)

Once you gave me the promise of your love

Now my eyes are open

Where are you, where am I

Where are we, are you still here

Our love is drowning in tears

Once you gave me the promise of your love

Now my eyes are open

Where are you, where am I, where are we
