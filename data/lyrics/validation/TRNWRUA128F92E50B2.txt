I see you in a daydream
Turn it on now make a big scene
You kiss you kiss when you want something
Fake a smile now
You got it all

And that oughta get you nowhere
What you say to me
I know how to stay outta focus

Keep your head down till the bitter end
Make believe that you my best friend
You trade passion for fashion
Nothings cool like when we were cool

And that oughta get you nowhere
What you say to me
I know how to stay outta focus

You fall through to cracks of the city street
You can't see straight
You can't see straight

I see you in a daydream
Turn it on now make a big scene
It makes you happy
It makes you happy
It makes you happy
It makes you happy

And that oughta get you nowhere
What you say to me
I know how to stay outta focus

And that oughta get you nowhere
What you say to me
You fall through to cracks of the city street
You can't see straight
You can't see straight
You can't see straight
