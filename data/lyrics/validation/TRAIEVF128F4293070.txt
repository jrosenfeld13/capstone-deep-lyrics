Paper snowflakes
They don't melt in sunshine
Plasic roses won't wilt
They'll be alright

Paper snowflakes
They don't melt in sunshine
And glass tears don't dry
They don't dry

Staircases climb in my heart of steel
Your Christmas caress, a sentiment I can't feel
Touch me again, soft against the stars door, pale
They just shine so sweet

Paper snowflakes, they don't melt in the sunshine
Plastic roses won't wilt, they'll be alright
Paper snowflakes don't melt in the sunshine
And glass tears don't dry
No

Care to caress a cute breast girl
It's moving on mine as I lay down tonight
Wills god, oh god create lapses
It's not far, it's not far
It's near
Ahh

Paper snowflakes don't melt in the sunshine
Plastic roses won't wilt, they'll be alright
Paper snowflakes don't melt in the sunshine
Glass tears don't dry

Paper snowflakes don't melt in the sunshine
Plastic roses won't wilt, they'll be alright
Paper snowflakes don't melt in the sunshine
And glass tears don't dry
Glass tears don't dry
