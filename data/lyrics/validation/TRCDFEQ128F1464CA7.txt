[Verse 1]
Honey do all the things I'll never do to you
I know what you do, all the things I never do

Sorry 'bout the fire
Sorry 'bout the torch
Sorry I had to have my revenge
Send it in a note
Said you cannot go
Say you were sick, you can't get dressed

[Chorus]
Come on, be on fire
Come on, be a liar
My dress is the prettiest
Cover me in burns
Everyone take a turn
I'm already humiliated

[Post-Chorus]
My, oh my baby, you do reflect the sun
My, oh my baby, you were almost golden
My, oh my, oh how you do reflect the sun
My, oh my baby, you were almost golden

[Verse 2]
Sorry 'bout the fire
Sorry 'bout the torch
Sorry I had to have my revenge
Send it in a note
Say you cannot come
Say you are still tied to the bed

[Chorus]
When's he gonna come
When's he gonna spring
When's he gonna crawl out in public
When's he gonna come
Screaming bombs away
When's he gonna kill me in this room

[Bridge]
My oh my he's in his gloriousness
Watch him tear me down with such a vengeance
Hold on to me, yeah baby, hold, hold on tight
Yeah, we'll just see which one of us gets out alive
Oh, honey do all the things I'll never do to you

[Chorus]
Cover me in fire
Cover me in lies
That's just your entertainment
Sorry I'm upset
Walked a mile behind
I was stuck and you still in a daze

[Outro]
My, oh my baby, you do reflect the sun
And my, oh my, you were almost golden, yeah
And my, oh my, oh yeah you do reflect the sun
And my, oh my baby, you were almost golden
