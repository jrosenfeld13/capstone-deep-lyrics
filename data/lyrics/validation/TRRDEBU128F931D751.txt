Twenty two
And trough with you
I'm twenty two
And singing to you
There's nothing true
When I'm with you
So what will make
Tomorrow alright
Lift me up
And let me drift away
Don't follow
Cause I don't
Need nobody else but me
And I don't need your sympathy
Twenty two
And trough with you
I'm twenty two
And singing to you
There's nothing true
When I'm with you
So what can make
Tomorrow alright
Lift me up
And let me drift away
Don't follow
Cause i don't
Need nobody else but me
No I don't
Need nobody else but me
To destroy myself
No I do fine on my own
No i don't
Need nobody else but me
To destroy myself
No I do fine on my own
