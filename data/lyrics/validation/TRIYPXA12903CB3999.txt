It's a sin my darling how I love you because I know our love can never be
It's a sin to keep this mem'ry of you when silence proves that you've forgotten me
The dream I built for us has tumbled each promise broken like my heart
It's a sin my darling how I love you so much in love and yet so far apart

It's a sin to hide behind this heartache to make believe that I've found someone new
It's a sin to say that I don't miss you when people know I'm still in love with you
I'm sure you're happy with another who shares the love I couldn't win
Why pretend that I can't live without you when deep inside I know that it's a sin
