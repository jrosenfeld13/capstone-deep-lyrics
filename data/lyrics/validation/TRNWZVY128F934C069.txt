Light the dawn, realization unfolding
That this tortured mind is unworthy
Yet inside this light, I spoke the words
That severed barriers of silence

And though at times I may suffer
I never lost the perception
As a result, forced to witness
Horrors that most cannot imagine

Though I command the armies of forever
I only dream of death
To exude the emptiness I felt
As eternal youth birthed its gift

And when the passion falls away
Only madness remains in the eyes
That navigate the darkness
And when you scream, your tears run dry
All the light you gave soon fades, my darling

Days that stretched on for a lifetime
Only in death unite us both
Words live on in my craving
For everlasting life to shine through me

Now my soul has been torn into
Subtle pieces of a memory
I soon take flight through the burden
Of the burden is eternity

I'll tear them down, utter words
I've been longing to speak
So, to unleash
Of the burden that slips off my tongue

The end that draws us on
Drawing closer with each passing moment
The light you cast is mine
In lightless chasm

Unyielding malice overtaking
Seeps into my soul to seek forgiveness
May this path lead the way to find the end
Of all those memories I hold dear
Lie in ruin, ashes at my feet

Now I'm a witness to the destruction
Of another witness, to the demise of me
All the anger left consuming
Won't set me free from its grasp

The blood in my veins flows like sand
Through my heart and out of my hands
Fill the burden of life, this isn't mine

I'll tear them down, utter words
I've been longing to speak
So, to unleash
Of the burden that slips off my tongue

The end that draws us on
Drawing closer with each passing moment
The light you cast is mine
In lightless chasm
