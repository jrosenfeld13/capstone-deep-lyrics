Oh, little girl of mine in Tennessee
I know she's waiting there for me
Someday I'll settle down in that little country town
With that little girl of mine in Tennessee

Oh, a long long time ago when I left my home to roam
Down in the hills of Tennessee
Was the sweetest little girl that was ever in this world
Down in the hills of Tennessee

Oh, little girl of mine in Tennessee
I know she's waiting there for me
Someday I'll settle down in that little country town
With that little girl of mine in Tennessee

Oh, she begged me not to go, ?You'll be sorry, dear, I know?
For the way that you've were treating me
So I rambled all around and nothing could be found
To take the place of her in Tennessee

Oh, little girl of mine in Tennessee
I know she's waiting there for me
Someday I'll settle down in that little country town
With that little girl of mine in Tennessee

Oh, someday I'll wander back to that little cabin shack
Little girl that's waiting there for me
I can see her smiling face waiting for me at the gate
Oh, the little girl of mine in Tennessee

Oh, little girl of mine in Tennessee
I know she's waiting there for me
Someday I'll settle down in that little country town
With that little girl of mine in Tennessee
