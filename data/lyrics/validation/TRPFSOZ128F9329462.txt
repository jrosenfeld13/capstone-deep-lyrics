You found happiness
For a short moment
Like a tender kiss
You felt safe, well and free
But the appearance deceives
Because you try to hide
Your face forced with a smile
The bitter truth behind

Now you're dancing in delight
All your dreams are fulfilled
Your wish comes true, you reach the sky
Climb the highest mountains
If it has lasted a long time
You wonder how it happens
But now you're dancing in delight
And nothing else matters

You seek desperately the courage to prevail
Tears are your silent screams, but faith is your shield
Everything you tried
Always seemed in vain
It wasn't satisfied
Nothing has really changed

Now you're dancing in delight
All your dreams are fulfilled
Your wish comes true, you reach the sky
Climb the highest mountains
If it has lasted a long time
You wonder how it happens
But now you're dancing in delight
And nothing else matters

Now you're dancing in delight
All your dreams are fulfilled
Your wish comes true, you reach the sky
Climb the highest mountains
If it has lasted a long time
You wonder how it happens
But now you're dancing in delight
And nothing else matters
