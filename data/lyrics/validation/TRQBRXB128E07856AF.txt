Ah yeah!
Calling out around the world, are you ready for a brand new beat
Summer's here and the time is right, for dancing in the streets
They're dancing in Chicago (They'll be dancing)
Down in New Orleans (Dancing in the streets)
Up in New York City (Dancing in the streets)
All we need is music (sweet sweet) sweet music (sweet sweet music)
There'll be music everywhere
There'll be swinging, swaying, records playing, dancing in the streets, Oh!
It doesn't matter what hat you wear, just as long as you are there
So come on
Grab a guy, grab a girl, everywhere around the world
There'll be dancing, dancing in the streets
(Oh) It's just an invitation, across the nation, a chance for folks to meet
There'll be laughing and singing, music swinging, dancing in the streets
All we need is music (sweet sweet) sweet music (sweet sweet music)
There'll be music everywhere
There'll be swinging, swaying, records playing, dancing in the streets, Oh!
It doesnt matter what hat you wear, just as long as you are there
So come on
Grab a guy, grab a girl, everywhere around the world
Dancing, dancing in the streets
Way down in LA, everyday, dancing in the streets (Dancing in the streets)
San Francisco way,  (Dancing in the streets),  they do it everyday now
(Dancing in the streets)
