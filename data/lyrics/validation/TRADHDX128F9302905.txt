Her father had worked all his life
Her mother was a good housewife
Inspiration i need, it's a girl star i need
Daddy said all men were workers
Girls should be sweet, be good mothers
Inspiration i need, it's a girl star i need
Girls on t.v. thin and pretty
Fronting bands while acting flirty
Inspiration i need, it's a girl star i need
She looked through all her teenage mags
Five foot eight, thirty four c bras
Inspiration i need, it's a girl star i need
Most girls models and Baywatch stars
Nice long legs and a nice trim arse
Inspiration i need, it's a girl star i need
She was small and quite chubby
She was now abnormal this way
Inspiration i need, it's a girl star i need
Why no natural girls in bands
All four males sounding very bland
Inspiration i need, it's a girl star i need
Just wanna have fun, be herself
Female role model for some help
Inspiration i need, it's a girl star i need
All i want is a real girl star

It's a girl star that i really need
It's a girl star that i really need

So now she's in her own pop band
Got a single out which wasn't planned
Inspiration she is, for other girls to do this
So maybe more will follow her
Will things be equal in the future?
Inspiration she is, it's a girl star she is
Y'know
