This dark star comes home
Every word I meant to say
In the courts when they said
Choking on all of your words
In and out sleepless nights, so far from her
Breathe in slowly, you will forget
They stole me in the night, while you slept
Wait for poisson streams
Drink in laced with strobing streets
Breathe in slowly, you will forget
They stole me in the night, while you slept
Breathe in slowly
You will forget...
Was it in the Discoveratory where the figures leapt around the glassy floor?
Oh dear, now he sinks down towards Neptuenn's Cavern...
