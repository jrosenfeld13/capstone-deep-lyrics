A daring step
The waiting crowd
A hungry child
Must learn to bow

Yes, this is all the bitter truth
The gritty sand beneath your feet
The taste of failure on your mouth
This is a game of hurt

Yes, this is all the bitter truth
Yes, this is cold reality
This is what you have come to

Yes, this is all the bitter truth
Yes, every gesture was in vain
This game is harsh and you have lost
You know it all comes down to this:
Pathetic lies and vanity
The taste of sand inside your mouth

A daring step
The wanton smile
A desperate man
Tells desperate lies

Yes, this is all the bitter truth
The gritty sand beneath your feet
The taste of failure on your mouth
