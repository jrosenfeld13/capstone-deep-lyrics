[Verse]
I have been all across the country, and I have stayed in every town;
You see, I'm trying to find my baby, and he ain't nowhere around... Can you understand?
You know which way I'm heading, if my baby cant be found... oh, yeah
Well, I spoke to the river, and the river, the river spoke back to me;
It said, "Oh! You look so lonely, and so much full of misery... Yes, you do now
If you can't find your baby, come on, girl, and make your home with me. Oh, yeah
I don't want to leave him - No, I know, I know hes still alive!
And someday, I'm going to find him, and he's gonna take me for a ride Yes, he will now
And then we'll live forever and ever and ever, forever and ever among the tides... Oh, yes, we will!
Just in case I don't find him, I'm going to take that river's invitation river's invitation

[Outro]
Oh, oh, the river! Oh, oh, the river!
Oh, the river, yeah... Oh, river's invitation
Yeah, the river
