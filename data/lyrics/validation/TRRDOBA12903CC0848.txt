[Verse 1]
My baby came home late last night
I said girl I gotta talk to you
I've been drinking with the man next door
He said he's been singing with you
Whoever's telling lies it's time to say bye-bye
You know my mama didn't raise no fool

[Chorus]
You're going to walk out that door you'll never see me anymore
Tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm going to love ya' just one more time
I'd love to see what you've got
I don't care if it takes all night
Going to make you remember for the rest of your life oh baby
We had a good thing a good thing going
But ain't been seeing eye to eye
You had a good thing but it's all over
Might as well wave and say goodbye

[Verse 2]
It's easy to see the guilt in your eyes
Girl I want you to tell me the truth
Was he worth the risk and all the trouble he's caused
Now it comes down to me and you
You thought I was blind when you were gone all the time
Playing me for a fool

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
We had a good thing going baby but it's all over

[Outro]
Good thing, good thing going
