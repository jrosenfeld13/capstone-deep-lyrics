I took time to think things over
Time I didn't want to spare
Cause someone told me I had things to fix
Things I didn't want to repair
So I was talked into sitting quietly thinking bout the things I'd done
Didn't like it so I said wisely oh hell!
Where's my fun?

Hail hail spit n' drool

I liked the way that things were going
Don't like the way they're going now
But I'd like to add there is a thing I can do
Going to tell you what, where and when and how

Hail hail spit n' drool
