Camera flash and the lights go out
I forgot what I was playing about
People come and people go
Where they go nobody knows
Nobody knows
Nobody knows
Nobody knows

Everybody's talking about the latest buzz
I wasn't listening to what it was
Pay attention, the tension grows
Where it grows, nobody knows
Nobody knows
Nobody knows
Nobody knows
Nobody knows
Nobody knows

Nobody shows you if they love you
They try so hard to be above you

Everybody's looking at the pretty boy
The one who's making all the noise
He don't read much as it shows
Ladies don't love him for what he knows
For what he knows
For what he knows
For what he knows
For what he knows

He never shows you if he loves you
He only tries so hard to be above you

It's getting late so I turn in
Nothing happened yet again
I'm just waiting on love to show
Where it is nobody knows
I'm just waiting for love to show
Where it is, nobody knows

Nobody knows
Nobody knows
Nobody knows
Nobody knows
Nobody knows

Nobody shows you if they love you
They only try so hard to be above you

Lalalalalala
