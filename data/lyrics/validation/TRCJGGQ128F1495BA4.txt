[Verse 1]
You need a love that will not change
You want a lover to remain, forever yours
Oh, but you don't have to worry
You never have to fear
Through thick and thin I'll always be here

I'll be your bridge
Over and through troubled waters
You never have to face it alone
And when the world seems to treat you unfair
Baby, for you, I'll always be there

[Chorus x2]
I won't be a fairweather friend
I'll be there 'til the end
Even through stormy weather
Time and time again

Woo!

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I know it's rough for you
And then there are times you're feeling blue
Got so much pain
Oh, but I'm the kind of person who can take the hurt away
You'll never have to suffer again

I'll be your strength
To carry you over the mountain
To lift you up when you're falling down
Baby, be strong
You can believe in me
'Cause I'm your friend
And I'll always, always, always be right there

[Chorus]

Oh, baby for you, I'll always be there, oh

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Baby, I know what's right for you
Maybe sometimes you're feeling blue
But I won't let you, I won't let you
You're never gonna face no pain again
Cause, baby no mountains high enough
I'm gonna be there to lift you up
Baby, call my name, and I'll be there

Lay your head on my, my shoulder
Lay your head on my shoulder
I'll be, I'll be, I will be right there for you
Through the bad times, my baby
I'll be your sunshine
Woo, woo
Time and time again

[Chorus]
