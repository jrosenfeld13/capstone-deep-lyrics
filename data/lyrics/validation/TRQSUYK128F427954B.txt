I can't count and I can't think straight
I lost you this afternoon
Now it's raining so I think I'll sleep in late
I can't think of anything to do
And I could say that I'm not afraid
But you'll find out anyway

Little bits of cloud, go on and bite your lip
I was just a bandage when you lost your tourniquet
Just a singing boy whose songs were worn
Like zippered scars waiting to be born

All the doctors and all the medicine
Insurance men keep you alive
All the times I should have been there
Keeping hope above your bed at night
So when I tell you I'm not alone
I'm just pretending someone else is home

Little bits of cloud go on and bite your lip
I was just a bandage when you lost your tourniquet
Just a singing boy whose songs were worn
Like zippered scars waiting to be born
