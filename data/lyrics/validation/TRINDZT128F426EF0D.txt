[Verse 1]
I can't understand
She let go of my hand
And left me here facing the wall
Id sure like to know
Why she'd go
But I can't get close to her at all
Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime
She said she would never forget
But now mornings clear
Its like I ain't here
She acts like we never met

[Verse 2]
Its all new to me
Like some mystery
It could even be like a myth
But its hard to think on
That shes the same one
That last night I was with
From darkness, dreams are deserted
Am I still dreaming yet?
I wish shed unlock
Her voice once and talk
'Stead of actin' like we never have met

[Verse 3]
If she ain't feelin' well
Then why dont she tell
'Stead of turnin' her back to my face?
Without any doubt
She seems too far out
For me to return to or chase

Well her skirt it swayed
As the guitar played
Her mouth was watery and wet
But now something has changed
For she ain't the same
She just acts like we never have met

[Verse 4]
If I didnt have to guess
Id gladly confess
To anything I mightve tried
If I was with her too long
Or have done something wrong
I'd wish shed tell me what it is, Ill run and hide

Though the night ran swirling and whirling
I remember her whispering yet
But evidently she dont
Evidently she wont
She just acts like we never have met

[Verse 5]
Im leavin' today
Ill be on my way
Of this I can't say very much
But if you want me to
I can be just like you
And pretend that we never have touched
And if anybody asks me
Is it easy to forget?
Ill say, Its easily done
You just pick anyone
And pretend that you never have met!
