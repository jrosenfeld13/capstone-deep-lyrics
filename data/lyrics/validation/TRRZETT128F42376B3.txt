[Verse 1]
Jagged purple rocks
Drunk with the tours and the travel guides
We've all come to Hope Cove
Singing the waning pop standard
In the haven of our love

[Verse 2]
Trying to break even
Most of us will not turn back
Somehow I know you will not
Carry all the ancient medicine
Steal my rosy red invention

[Verse 3]
Gather the amps
And dampen the camps
The day is done
When we see the sun

[Outro]
Perhaps then the race is won
