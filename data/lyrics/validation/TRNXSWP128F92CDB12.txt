[Verse 1]
Momma's in the kitchen
Sister's on the phone
Daddy's watching TV
I was upstairs all alone
Picking on my guitar
Just twicking all my twang
Up all night, sleep all day
And people say i'm strange
My girlfriend works at Walmart
She'll check your merchandice
If you give her any lip son
She'll cut you down to size
Got a crusafix and a crystal hanging on a silver chain
A fish hook belly button ring and a tattoo that says

[Chorus]
Strange, Strange, Just a little strange
A little wild and dangerous and slightly derranged
Strange, strange, don't you ever change
Cause everybody out there is just a little strange

[Verse 2]
She's got skirts out on the fender
Headlights to the wind
Crush velvet on the seats, makes a boy wanna slide right on in
Two tone drop top Cadillac
Cherry red and pink champagne, Chrome around the tail lights
And the license plate says, guess what?

[Chorus][x3]

[Bridge][x3]
Strange

[Outro]
Everybody looking (x8)
For some strange
