Serpent rising on the horizon, and right here in my abode
Full sensation, a manifestation, I'm petrified I cannot go
Black and white day glow, cold creeping fright show a star of infinite mass
Soul corroding and head exploding, existence reduced in a flash

Diamond of a million flies
Illusion of hope
Black lizard in disguise
Hate fiend on dope

Dwarf... The Black Dwarf

Slow death descending, pain never-ending, Astaroth won't go away
So radiating now always hating, this liar commands you to stay
Depressions and crisis, hopeless advices, suicide, acid rain
Controlling the masses, misguiding our asses, bringing me stain on stain

Freak show from outer hell
Psychos create
Heroes or villains low
The choices you make

Dwarf... The Black Dwarf

Have you seen the poison queen, sitting on your shoulder?
Don't you know what she says, can you not control her?
Read the hex like you read the stories, god is dead and you have no worries
Forget ambition, fuck the vision, kill the lights and go to sleep
The stalker is stalking and talking and talking, colossal power and wit
Pathetic, unethical and yes -- unaesthetic, oh boy, you're so full of shit

You're playing me tricks, six hundred sixty-six, the devil dictating the news
I can't keep resisting, black dwarf's insisting, I'm so afraid of you!!

Diamond of a million flies
Illusion of hope
Black lizard in disguise
Hate fiend on dope

Freak show from outer hell
Psychos create
Heroes or villains low
The choices you make

Dwarf... The Black Dwarf

From the filth of the crucifix, to the stench of headlines
The dwarf is there, his ugly face, blocking out the sunshine
No taboos and no distinctions, fantasy creating fiction
And no one knows what to believe, so kill the lights and go to sleep
