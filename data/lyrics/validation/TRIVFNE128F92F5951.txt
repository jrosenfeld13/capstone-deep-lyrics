Down a cold and darkened hallway
A doctor stood alone
With a young and frightened father
Who knew something was wrong
He said, Son this isn't easy
But we really need to talk
So he put his arm around him
And they began to walk

He said your wife is finally sleeping
She just needs to be alone right now
And your baby, well she's healthy
But there's something you should know
Son, she's slightly less than perfect
And there's nothing we could do
So before you go to see her
I thought I'd talk to you

As the young man held the warm
And sleeping bundle to his chest
He saw the imperfections
And although he tried his best
He couldn't stop the tears from falling
As he held his little girl
And in a low and trembling voice
He gently said these words

You're beautiful in every way, so beautiful
How I've waited for this day
If the world was offered to me
I just couldn't make the trade
Cause you're beautiful

When I think of how I've fallen
And all the times I've tried
To hide my imperfections
From my Father's eyes
There's a voice that still is calling
Deep inside of me
And I can always hear it
When I get on my knees

You're beautiful in every way, so beautiful
How I've waited for this day
When the world was offered to me
I just couldn't make the trade
Cause you're beautiful
You'd be amazed at how some things matter
And some things don't
When you're seen through
The eyes of God
Though we try to hide our darkness
And fill our dreams
He only sees what's in your heart

And you're beautiful, in every way
So beautiful
How I've waited for this day
When the world was offered to me
I just couldn't make the trade
Cause you're beautiful

I know God knows, you're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
