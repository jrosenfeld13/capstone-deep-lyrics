My mama done told me when I was in pig tails
My mama done told me
Hon a man's gonna sweet talk
And give you the big eye

But when the sweet talkin's done
A man is a two face, a worrisome thing
Who'll leave you singin'
The blues in the night

Now you know that rain is fallin'
Hear that train callin' whoo-ee
My mama done told me
Hear that lonesome whistle

Calling cross the trestle, whoo-ee
My mama done told me
A whoo-ee duh whoo-ee, clickety clacks
Echoin' back the blues in the night

The evening breeze will start the trees to cryin'
And the moonlight hides his light
When you get the blues in the night

Take my word, the mockin' bird will the saddest kinda song
He knows things are wrong and he's right
From Natchez to Mobile from Memphis to St. Joe
Wherever the four winds blow

I've been to the big towns an' I heard me some big talk to
Mmm but when the big talkin's done
A man is a two face, a worrisome thing
Who'll leave you to sing the blues in the night

My mama was right, there's blues in the night
