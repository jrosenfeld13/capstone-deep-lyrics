So long before
You've stood so long
At my door
Abundantly you have asked
Have you received?
Is this everything that you've hoped for?
Is this everything you've dreamed?
Well, I'm not sure if I don't really mean it

Life and history
Repeat and I
Will see visions vividly
Of how everything will end the same
Is this everything that you've hoped for?
Is this everything you've dreamed?
Well, I want it to be if the real point is seen

So in this hour
Everything I do
Will be all for this moment;
Everything's for you
My heart is open
And willing
So take it

Get up, get up, get up

So much feeling
Oh, my soul is singing
And everybody feels the same
Is this everything that you've hoped for?
Is this everything you've dreamed?
Well I think it is if the real point is seen

So in this hour
Everything I do
Will be all for this moment;
Everything's for you
My heart is open
And willing
So take it

Stay in place
When there are so
Many things to say
I want to help and not just hesitate...
But I just don't
But I just don't
So please take my life and use it
I'm ready

Oh oh, oh oh, ohhh
Oh oh, oh oh, ohhh
Oh oh, oh oh, ohhh
Oh oh, oh oh, ohhh
Oh oh, oh oh, ohhh
Oh oh, oh oh, ohhh
