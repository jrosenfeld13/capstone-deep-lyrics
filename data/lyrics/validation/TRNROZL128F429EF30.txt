Today's special is Memphis soul stew
We sell so much of this people wonder what we put in it
We're going to tell you right now

Give me about a half a teacup of bass
Now I need a pound of fat back drums
Now give me four tablespoons of boiling Memphis guitars
This is going to taste all right

Now just a little pinch of organ
Now give me a half a pint of horns

Place on the burner
And bring to a boil
That's it, that's it, that's it right there

Now beat well
