The road was for us
We paved the ocean with trust
Started a band, but man we never took care
Of all the renegade rust
It never hurt this much

It nearly beat us to death
I bled with every breath
Chances are good each miracle milestone
Is filled with regret

Just close your eyes

I stuffed it with love
Felt an empty chill
You can't speak
You haven't moved for so long
It's like you never will

I know that you've been cryin'
But I swear, we'll both be fine

Bring us peace
Renegades
Speak your heart
Renegades
Close your eyes
If you never try there's nothin'
