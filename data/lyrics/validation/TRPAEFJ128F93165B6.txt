Life's been blinding me
From what I thought I'd see
Is there clarity in this insanity? (yeah)
Whats she want from me? (yeah)

Roads in front of me
Taking me astray
Are you leaving me?
Or are you leading the way?
Can you hear what I'm sayin'?

I need to know...
I need to know...
I need to know...
I need to know...

Feel like I'm tryin' to breathe under water
Tryin' to climb but I keep fallin farther (yeah)

Will you take my hand?

Feels so far away
Want to see your face
Are you even there?
Can you show me?!
Can you make me believe?!

I need to know...
I need to know...
I need to know...
I need to know...

I need to know...
I need to know...
