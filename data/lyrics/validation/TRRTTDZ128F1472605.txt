And so
Time goes by my love
These tears
Have all run dry my love
My life is melting away
And I see a heart
That's broken
I hear the words that
You say to me
Though no words spoken
To me

CHORUS:
But once in a lifetime of moments
I see you lived for a lifetime of moments
Go gently go free
(You lived for a lifetime of moments)
(Believing in me)
The rain
Softly falls on me
My pain
It takes it all from me
I saw it right from the start
I knew lies could not help her
Now I'm running straight for a heart
To give me shelter from you
Looking into the mirror
Remembering every fear
Now my heart it knows
Everywhere you go
My life is melting away from me
