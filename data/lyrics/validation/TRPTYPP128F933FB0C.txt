When the wind blows it blows your name
Today you were a Hurricane
You blew the day into the night
Then your memories filled with dim twilight

Now I'm going back and forward
Away from and toward
Like a stranded boat I'm lost at sea
I need your love to rescue me

I saw you last night inside of my dream
Felt you so close did you feel me
Like the Moon that's always pulling on the tide
I Always knew you'd pull me gently from the sky

Now I'm going back and forward
Away from and toward
Like a stranded boat I'm lost at sea
I need your love to rescue me

I saw you on the horizon
The star you gently were rising
You were not sad, you were not scared
Someday I know we'll go and join you there

Now I'm going back and forward
Away from and toward
Like a stranded boat I'm lost at sea
I need your love to rescue me

When the wind blows it blows your name
Today you were a Hurricane
You blew the day into the night
Then your memories filled the dim twilight

Now I'm going back and forward
Away from and toward
Like a stranded boat I'm lost at sea
I need your love to rescue me
