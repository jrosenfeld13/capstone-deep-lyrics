Here comes the man in the three piece suit
And what he's doin' no one really knows
And there he goes
He's got his pride and his problems too
You want to help him, it's really up to you
Whatcha gonna do?
No one ever saw a thing, not a word was heard
Blow by blow, they knocked him down, kicked in his head
Blow by blow, it didn't matter if he's innocent
They held his trail in the woods out back
No judge or jury, he never had a chance
They crushed his hands
You know their names and you call them your friends
If truth be told, you're really just like them
Guilty as hell
No one ever saw a thing, not a word was heard
Blow by blow, they knocked him down, kicked in his head
Blow by blow, it didn't matter if he's innocent
Blow by blow, they held him down, beat him till dead
Blow by blow, it didn't matter, he's not one of them
