[Verse 1]
I knew all along
That I was right at the start
About the seeds of the weeds
That grew in your heart

[Verse 2]
Self satisfaction for this factions
Who formed to tear us apart
Oh I gave you the midas touch
As you turned round to scratch out my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh what did you expect?
Oh tell me what did you expect?
To lay it on my head?
So is it all upon my head?

[Chorus]
Bang bang you're dead!
Always so easily lead
Bang, bang, you're de-e-ead!
Put all the rumours to bed
Bang, bang you're dead

[Verse 3]
I knew all along
But I was loathe to believe
There was nothing but spite
Fury and lies
Of the words that you weave
An illusion to a conclusion
And oh its oh so tawdry
When you put it to bed kick it in the head
Oh won't they just let it be

[Chorus]
Bang bang you're dead!
Always so easily lead
Bang, bang, you're de-e-ead!
Put all those rumours to bed
Bang, bang you're dead

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh what did you expect?
Oh tell me what did you expect?
To lay it on my head?
So is it all upon my head?
Bang bang you're dead!
Always so easily lead
Bang, bang, you're de-e-ead!
Put all those rumours to bed
Bang, bang you're dead

[Outro]
Bang bang bang bang you're dead
Always dead
