[Chorus]
Today is the day for tomorrow and then some
We could keep this party going for the rest of our lives. (x2)

[Verse 1]
I can feel the worlds desire as its heart is set afire
Let it burn as it beats and well never be defeated
If we say that it will happen and we know that it will happen
It will happen just the same. And well be here to lead it

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
If the government cant fight it they will only try to hide it;
But were looking in their eyes, through their moderate disguises
Let the new will of the people overcome this evil
The stage is set for battle as the curtain slowly rises

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Anyone can be another flower on the wall
Stay true to principle and give your all for all!

[Chorus to close]
