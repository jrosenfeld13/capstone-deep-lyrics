Endless suffering
Enduring the pain
Cast aside tolerance
This torture remains the same

This endless torture remains the same
Eclipse and masking all that you ever were
Shards of reality slicing through your mind
Escaping this grieving nightmare

And I fall into nothing
Forever jaded
And I hold onto nothingness
Dissolving my senses

[solo]

Distorting the paralleled
Contorting the grieving world around you
This endless torture remains the same

Through his eyes you pierce
And smash those warped perceptions
Of this relentless debatchury
Escaping this grieving nightmare

And I fall into nothing
Forever jaded
And I hold onto nothingness
Dissolving my senses

[solo]

And I fall into nothing
Forever jaded
And I hold onto nothingness
Dissolving my senses

Tolerate my being
Binded by my hate
Calm this relentless craving
Before it's too late
