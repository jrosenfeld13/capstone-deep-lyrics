Me and some friends, whoa
We been buddies since Boca Raton
Signed on a ship
To take a trip to old Taiwan
Got as far as Siam
Took it on the lam
Arrived in Hong Kong with all our money gone
We joined up with a gang when
We found we couldn't go on

We still remain here
Though we don't belong
That's what they call us
Cowboys in Hong Kong

The stakes were high tonight
We're going to break on through
We're hiding in the tall grass
Waiting for our signal to move
Our friends are inside
They were beaten they were tied
We've got to get them out
Before they blow our cover wide
Some sad GI Joe's
Mind wanders home
Thinks about a girl left behind

We're freedom fighters
And so we say
They like to tell us
That anyway
We still remain here
Though we don't belong
That's why they call us
Cowboys in Hong Kong

There's a girl that he sees
When he's feeling lonely
She'll laugh and say, 'Okay Joe'
When they hold real tight
In the dead of the night
He'll pretend she's from Ohio
Oh... I'm a cowboy in Hong Kong

We're freedom fighters
And so we say
They like to tell us
That anyway
We still remain here
Though we don't belong
That's why they call us
Cowboys in Hong Kong
