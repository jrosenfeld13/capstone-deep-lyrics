The cornerstone of a drowning honest man

Paranoia builds this foundation of life
Forever 'til a change of times

They've killed the devil with undying affection
As he spoke with peaceful phrases before his dying breath
An unattained peace within his self before this death
For a handful of misbelievers of a no man's faith
When good made evil

Alarms triggering, in the back of your mind
Cracks streamline the walls of an empty skull
Prying into the sky

Behold, a circumstance untold of misconceptions
That lead to contradictions
Hi-fidelity of wrong proportions
That spiral into white noise

All obedience disruled...through a visual trap
Cast your stones...closet of skeletons
One to many broken bones

Hiding lies
A costly fear
Question all
Question its reason

An ecstasy you didn't reach...now empty for you

This glimpse of terror
A sight so unsound
An ecstasy you didn't reach

A blind mirror...no reflection...the real world

The furthest one has been
All this time is wasted
Standing on these actions
A quick jolt to reality

These mind terrorist invading a black sand beach
Extinguish a scene of this unleveled conflict
This lapse in time
Turn the page of life
This blame for pain
Been left behind

You acted like things never happen
A stab with simple little phrases
This action of serpent words
It's now your fear they're tasting
