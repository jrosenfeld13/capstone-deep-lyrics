You may walk away in anger
Wear your heart upon your sleeve
You make act like it don't matter
Keep me laughing while you leave

But burning bridges won't get me back
If you change your mind some day
Why can't we turn this scene around
Before you walk away

Will you be leaving leaving me today
Like the ocean leaves us waiting on
The sand crumbling in our hand
I can't live this scene again

You may turn away in silence
While the tears run down your face
Say there's nothing left to bind us
Leaving love without a trace

But if I loved you well you'd soon find out
Why your new love falls some day
Why can't we burn this heartache down
Before you walk away

Will you be leaving me today
Like the ocean leaves us waiting on
The sand crumbling in our hand
I can't live this scene again

Will you be leaving me today
Like the ocean leaves us waiting on
The sand crumbling in our hand
I can't live this scene again...
