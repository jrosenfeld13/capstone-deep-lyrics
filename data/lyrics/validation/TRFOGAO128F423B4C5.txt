Oh!

Fall in denial of
I break I give into myself
Control, I break
I cannot be saved again
Before you take all that was to be mine
Give in because
Everything you taught will become

Burned - In my mind
Burned - Redefined
Burned - Sterilized
Burned - Why?

Burned - In my mind
Burned - Redefined
Burned - Sterilized
Burned - Why?

Oh!

Stain all the undeserved
Deny my insight has become
Control, I break
Suffocate inside me
Before you take all that was to be mine
Break it down cause
Everything you taught will become

Burned - In my mind
Burned - Redefined
Burned - Sterilized
Burned - Why?

Burned - In my mind
Burned - Redefined
Burned - Sterilized
Burned - Why?
