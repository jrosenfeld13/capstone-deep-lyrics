I forgot that there is something hiding in me
I know you wanted to, but can you take it?
Can you take it?

I won't bite, oh come on and give it to me
Wrap it up in my palm and let me take it
Knowing me, I'll break it

I am you, I'll wear a ribbon and a bow
Cause you never ever know
What is gonna happen

I know I want that
I know I want that
I know I want that
I know I want that

Look at me, I can fill you to the brim
I want to take you on a whim
Gonna make you like it

Let's go out, and find there's something hiding in me
I know you wanted to, but can you take it?
Can't you take it?

Sailing in bin bags to the farthest reach
(I know I want that)
We'll search for trinkets on an empty beach
(I know I want that)
I've got a handful of kaleidoscopes
(I know I want that)
I've got a hammer and a mile of rope

I know, I know I want that
I know, I know I want that
I know, I know I want that
I know, I know I want that

I'll wear a ribbon and a bow
Cause I think you like it
I like a friend, I love a foe
Why'd you think you liked it?
I got a lot of mess in tow
And I bet you like it
I like to shout it down the phone
Oh, I really like it

I know I want it now, I know I want it now, I know I want it now
I know I want that
I know I want it now, I know I want it now, I know I want it now
I know I want that
I know I want it now, I know I want it now, I know I want it now
I know I want that
I know I want it now, I know I want it now, I know I want it now
I know I want that
