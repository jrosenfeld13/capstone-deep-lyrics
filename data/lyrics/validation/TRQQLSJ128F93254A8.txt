O come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him
Born the King of angels
O come let us adore Him, O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord

Sing choirs of angels
Sing in exultation
O sing all ye citizens of heaven above
Glory to God
All glory in the highest
O come let us adore Him, O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord

Yea, Lord we bless thee
Born for our salvation
Oh Jesus, forever be Thy name adored
Word of the Father
Now in flesh appearing
O come let us adore Him, O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord
