[Hook:]
Hey, uuh
Some people be acting like they know it all
Hey, ooh
Some people be acting like they know it all
Hey, ooh, ai
Some people be acting like they know it all
Ooh

[Verse 1:]
See, see
See this type of thing wey we dey feel
Before you know, you don dey start to dey kolo small
I no go lie
We feel these things for real
Some people no believe that money brings upon a man's downfall
Face reality and you will see
That it pays nobody
To be feeling that they know it all
Try to visualize what I feel
And I bet what you will see would be a picture of a garden wall
If you try to push am down
Try to enter the town
Try to see wetin dey happen around
Na so them go dey bring you down
Before you know, you go dey for six feet under the ground
Ooh ah

[Chorus:]
Some people be acting like they know it all
But everybody knows that people rise and fall
Some rise up again just to stand up tall
And wiser and stronger
No matter how long you live
You can not learn it all
You go only do your best because you no go fit do all
So if you want to criticize me, talk small small
Cos you no holy pass, my brother

U no holy pass, my sister

[Verse 2:]
Hmm, some people when they see a wrong thing
They will start complaining
Until the complaining turn into shouting
Anytime they see a wrong thing
They continue shouting
Until the shouting turn into traditional shouting
Make them try to correct a thing
They will start to thinking
Until the thinking make the pressure to start to set in
Make them feel like outcast in the society them live in
Because they lose them sense of belonging
But they would try to push am more
Try to open every door
When negativity doesnt make it certain
So when them try to stop the complaining and the shouting
Them no go fit because e don be spiritual something
People take advantage of the dream
Because them realizing
Say this people lost them spirit of fighting
So them start to use them head
Use am like dustbin
All the problem of the nation
Them be dumping, in them head
Slavery will start to set in like Amistad
Oya, I know say you seen the making
And them start to do almost anything for almost nothing
Cos them same people they need some fighting
But the scavengers would bring them all
They will push them to the floor
And to collect all the people them belonging
But like a goat that has pushed to the wall
We already ready to start to do the fighting
So me a go run them down
Me a go chase them outta wey town
I sabi, we go gun down them
Before them go know, them go dey for six feet under the ground

[Chorus]
U no holy pass, my sister

[Chorus]
