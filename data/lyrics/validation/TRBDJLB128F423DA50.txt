Self is the universe, not separate
The state before the fall into self consciousness

Nothing is himeself, everything is world

(CHORUS)
Primordial egg returns
Consciousness unborn
Pre-personal perfection
Bliss's scree yet untorn
Uroboric forms

Find itself as a separate entity
An ego germ is just beginning to be

Wherever there is other, there is fear

Birth, primal paradise
No gap distance or separation
Between self and environment
Unconditional omnipotence

Nothing is himself, everything is world

(CHORUS)
Consciousness unborn
Uroboric forms
