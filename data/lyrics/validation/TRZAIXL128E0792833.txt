{Chorus}
I gotta get away [Why Nesh]
Cuz females don't get along with other females
They keep scratchin' and pullin' me at my coat tail
Behind my back tellin' to go to hell

I gotta get away [Why Nesh, Why Nesh]
Cuz females don't get along with other females
They keep scratchin'and pullin' me at my coat tail
Behind my back tellin to go to hell

{Verse 1}
Now ya'll know I represent for the chicks
But this girl's so petty it be makin me sick
Plottin' an lookin' an watchin' tryna pick up my twist
Always wanna know what I'm doin' and see who I'm with
I dunno why she focus all her free time on me
Peepin' out the window when she hear me jingle my keys
Right now I'm thinking that it's to the point that she wanna be me
This broad is quick to copy everytime I get a new weave
Lookin' at the name of my bags when I bring something home
Single black female, well honestly think somthing is wrong
Sit on my steps, talk on my phone, She quickly go get her phone
That ain't the type of shit that you do when you normal and grown
Bitch go read a book or go an check a flick out or sumthin'
God dammit I gotta get away, cuz bitches be buggin'
This kiddie situation gonna make come at a chick
The funny thing is when we was younger we used to be friends

{Chorus}
I gotta get away [Why Nesh]
Cuz females don't get along with other females
They keep scratchin' and pullin' me at my coat tail
Behind my back tellin' to go to hell

I gotta get away [Why Nesh, Why Nesh]
Cuz females don't get along with other females
They keep scratchin'and pullin' me at my coat tail
Behind my back tellin to go to hell

{Verse 2}
Got this girl round my way thats a trick
Trickin' for twenties, young dummy and quick wit her lip
Get dressed and change her clothes, if she think you look betta then her
Hatin' on every female that's doin' betta then her
Don't know what it is, I guess she got sum low self esteem
Dealin' wit brothers, friends, and cousins and causin' a scene
Purposely mess wit niggas wit girls just to start beef
And she don't really care if she's known as a whore in the streets
You know the type that you speak to, but basically that's about it
Cuz she the type a girl that smile, behind ur back talkin' shit
In the club wit your homies, keep an eye on your dude
Soon as you get up, go to the bathroom, she makin' a move
Turnin' her nose up at people, actin' all jealous and better
The hate gonna get her, lookin' at the books wanna be thinner
Was raised as a quitter, that's why she act the way that she do
Content bein' the savage, actin' like a god damn fool

{Chorus}
I gotta get away [Why Nesh]
Cuz females don't get along with other females
They keep scratchin' and pullin' me at my coat tail
Behind my back tellin' to go to hell

I gotta get away [Why Nesh, Why Nesh]
Cuz females don't get along with other females
They keep scratchin'and pullin' me at my coat tail
Behind my back tellin to go to hell

{Verse 3}
This other chick must got her confused
I been focused and can't nobody take me outta my groove
Hangin' around in the corner store rollin' her eyes
A year ago beatin my arrow? cuz she wanted a ride
I'm sayin' won't you fly me out to LA to get on a hook
I'm thinkin' to myself this broad must be as dumb as she look
Handle the situation well like I always been doin'
Went away for awhile came back my name is in ruins
They say that she's tellin people that T'm broke, ain't got a dime
And that she really wanna battle wit them trash ass rhymes
Guess that's the price you pay for fame, bein' a star in this world
This verse I'm talkin bout a guy that's actin' just like a girl
Jackin' me, sweatin' me, ridin' me, doin' it tough
You never get nowhere in life doin that fealem stuff
Guess that's the price you pay for fame, bein' a star in this world
This verse I'm talkin 'bout a guy that's actin' just like a girl


{Chorus}
I gotta get away [Why Nesh]
Cuz females don't get along with other females
They keep scratchin' and pullin' me at my coat tail
Behind my back tellin' to go to hell

I gotta get away [Why Nesh, Why Nesh]
Cuz females don't get along with other females
They keep scratchin'and pullin' me at my coat tail
Behind my back tellin to go to hell

I gotta get away [Why Nesh, Why Nesh]
Cuz females don't get along with other females
They keep scratchin'and pullin' me at my coat tail
Behind my back tellin to go to hell

I gotta get away [Why Nesh, Why Nesh]
Cuz females don't get along with other females
They keep scratchin'and pullin' me at my coat tail
Behind my back tellin to go to hell

Oh oh, Yeah yeah yeah
