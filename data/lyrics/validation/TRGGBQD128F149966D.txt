In the mid-night hour!

Last night my little dancer, came dancing to my door
Last night my little angel, came pumping on the floor
She said oh come on baby, I got a licence for love
And if it expires, pray help from above, because...

In the mid-night hour! She cried: More! More! More!
With a Rebel Yell! She cried: More! More! More! Wow!
In the mid-night hour babe! More! More! Nore!
With a Rebel Yell! More! More! More!, More! More! More!

She don't like slavery, she won't sit and beg!
But when I'm tired and lonely, she sees me to bed
What set you free, and brought you to me, babe?
What set you free? I need you here by me, because...

In the mid-night hour! She cried: More! More! More!
With a Rebel Yell! She cried: More! More! More! Wow!
In the mid-night hour babe! More! More! Nore!
With a Rebel Yell! More! More! More!, More! More! More!

I'll walk the world, with you babe
Eight thousand miles, with you!
I dried your tears of pain
Eight million times, for you!
I'd sell my soul, for you babe
For money to burn, for you!
I'd give you all I have known babe!
Just to, Just to, Just to, Just to, to have you here by me!
Because...

In the mid-night hour! She cried: More! More! More!
With a Rebel Yell! She cried: More! More! More! Wow!
In the mid-night hour babe! More! More! Nore!
With a Rebel Yell! She cried: More! More! More!, More! More! More!
More! More! More! More! More!
