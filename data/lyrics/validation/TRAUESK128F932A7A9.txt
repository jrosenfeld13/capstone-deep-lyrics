Tell me all the secrets
That you think I don't already know
Take me back to the place
Where our footprints
Bleed into the snow
Separate your sex from everything
Recreate the nightmares that make you come
To understand nothing is possible
To comprehend
That the world has come undone

- In your head - By my hands -
The world has come undone

Come with me I'll show you the things
You won't admit that you really want to see
On your knees we'll crawl together
Through the doors to depravity
Separate your sex from everything
Recreate the nightmares that make you cum
To understand nothing is possible
To comprehend
That the world
Has come
Undone
