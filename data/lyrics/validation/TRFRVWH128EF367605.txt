[Chorus]
Mean looks will never have me shook, take a second look

Mean looks will never have me shook, take a second look

Mean looks never have me shook, take a second look

[Verse 1: Lil Jay]
Your mean looks will never have me shook and I know you scared
I do niggas like a comic book, I rip them up to shreds
Boy, who? I'ma handle you, get you and your manager
Hit you in your mouth and you'll be taught to say, "What's happening, bruh?"
You ain't no player 'round me, you standing there, looking mean
Shawty, you is not fooling me, who the Hell are you supposed to be?
With them shades on, I know you's a fake, homes
Keep on looking at me and get your motherfucking face blown
