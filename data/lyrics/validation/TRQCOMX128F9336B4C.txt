I can see that you need me now
Like a flower reaching for the sun light
Like a plane in the darkest night
I'm there
Now your falling and you don't get up
Can't see that it will all be alright
Can't stand another one way fight
I'm there

[Chorus]
Where you think you'll be left on your own
I'll be there
Little by little I break it down
Hurt you to help you
Little by little I'll turn you around
Got nowhere to hide
I was there when you build the walls
I'll be there when you bring 'em down
I'll break it down
It's oke that you have been let down
Everybody needs a shoulder sometimes
Everybody has a path to find
Somewhere
You're living in your own disguise
Just leave it to the wind to guide you
Where will you go?
Where will you go?
Where will you go?

[Chorus]
Where you think you'll be left on your own
I'll be there
Little by little I break it down
Hurt you to help you
Little by little I'll turn you around
Got nowhere to hide
I was there when you build the walls
I'll be there when you bring 'em down
To bring it down
We've been here before
The world will keep on turning around
The sky will never fall and time will never end

[Chorus]
Little by little I break it down
Hurt you to help you
Little by little I'll turn you around
Got nowhere to hide
I was there when you build the walls
I'll be there when you bring 'em down
When you bring 'em down
Little by little I break it down
Hurt you to help you
Little by little I'll turn you around
Got nowhere to hide
I was there when you build the walls
I'll be there when you bring 'em down
When you bring 'em down
Little by little I break it down
Hurt you to help you
Little by little I'll turn you around
Got nowhere to hide
I was there when you build the walls
I'll be there when you bring 'em down
I'll break it down
