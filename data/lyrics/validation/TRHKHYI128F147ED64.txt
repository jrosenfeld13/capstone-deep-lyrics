[Verse 1]
The lord is back
The lord is on the train
He's riding the rails to resurrection
The lord is black
His mood is in the rain
The people have called
He's coming to make corrections

[Chorus]
You can hear his voice
Blowing in the wind
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Say, you can feel the power, if you search within
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
The lord is mad
His disposition's mean
He's traveling the road to mass destruction
Poor hearts be glad, you know your troubles have been seen
He promised he would make power reductions

[Chorus]
Revelations tells us that the time is near
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Better pay attention, to the warning voice you hear
Yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 3]
The lord is back
You know the lord is on the phone
He's calling out but he gets a bad connection, uh huh
The lord, he's fire
His eye is in the sun, yes
He's watching everyone for his selection

[Chorus]
His voice is like the thunder, crashing through the night
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
His smile is warm and soothing like the morning light
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 4]
The lord is back
The lord is on the train
He's traveling the road to resurrection
The lord is black
His mood is in the rain
The people have called
He's coming to make corrections

[Chorus]
You can hear his voice
Blowing in the wind
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
You can feel the power if you search within
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Outro]
The lord is back
The lord is back (yeah, hey)
The lord is back (come on to)
The lord is back (hey hey hey)
The lord is back (yeah yeah)
The lord is back (uh huh huh)
The lord is back (hey hey hey)
(fade)
