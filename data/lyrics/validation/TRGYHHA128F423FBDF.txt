Saw your face from a window
Now I can't let it go
But I don't know your number or your name
If I only could phone you
I could say what I want to
When I'm trying to catch your eye
You're stepping out of view

It's hard to do, it's such a shame
I can't get through without your number or your name

Caught a glimpse in the subway
But you weren't going my way
You were lost in the rumble of the train
In the rush of the city
You were standing so calmly
Wish that I only had the nerve
To say hello to you

It's hard to do, it's such a shame
I can't get through without your number or your name

I'll be waiting till the end of time
With this burning, yearning in my heart and in my mind

Saw you walking this morning
So I too started walking
Maybe this time will be the one
Where you will see me too

It's hard to do, it's such a shame
I can't get through without your number or your name
It's hard to do, it's such a shame
I can't get through without your number or your name
I can't get through without your number or your name
