Here's a version of tradition you can put in your drawer
In the desk where next to your chair's the handle to your door
Dismantle the door handle, put the parts into your drawer
Say some words then make a sign, now open up the drawer:
The drawer can't tell you more
Than to deal with the door

Now you object to objects actually meaning more
Than some pathetic, lame aesthetic stolling rone is famous for
Push the drawer closed, grab a firehose, point it at the door
Get it all wet, remember, forget what rock & roll is for
The drawer can't tell you more
Than to deal with the door

Now you're fishing for a mission way beyond the door
First you dream, next you're scheming, searching through your drawer
For an oar for your trip bound for yet uncharted shores
Over-reaching, find me spieling, cataloging doors
The door's a symbol for
These objects in your drawer
