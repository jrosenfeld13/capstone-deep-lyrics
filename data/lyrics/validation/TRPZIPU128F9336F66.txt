In the world nothing can be dead and gone
The inner world is your light to guide you home
The visions we're building, they're fuelling our lives and keep us strong
They live in our children, imagine the world and pass it on

Like it were set from mankind's early dawn
Within the world the inner world is moving on
Wherever it's turning, how ever it proves you right or wrong
Addicted to learning but somehow you know it all along
