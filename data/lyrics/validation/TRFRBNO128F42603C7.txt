HE CAME THROUGH
By Russ Taft
Picture Moses by the red sea shore
Pharoah knows they can't run no more
Water way too deep and wide
They can't swim, and they can't hide
Though he was just a man, Moses raised his hand

And the Lord came through
He heard their cry
When hope was gone
He turned the tide
You can shake your head
But you know it's true
When there was no other way
The Lord came through
King Darius and all his men
Tossed poor Daniel in the lion's den
He'd (done no crime but he had to pay)
For praying to the Lord three times a day
At the break of dawn they came looking for his bones
But the Lord came through, (but the Lord came through)
And pulled him out (and pulled him out)
He tamed those cats (He tamed the cats lions)
And shut their mouths (and shut their mouths)
You can shake your head, (you can shake your head)
But you know it's true (but you know it's true)
When there was no other way
The Lord came through
Those stories gathered dust up on the shelf
Till I fell into a trap I'd made myself
All my struggle only brought me pain
And I knew that I could never break those chains
But the Lord came through, (but the Lord came through)
He rescued me (He rescued me)
He broke the lock, (He broke the lock)
And set me free (and set me free)
You can shake your head, (you can shake your head)
But you know it's true (but you know it's true)
When there was no other way
The Lord came through
He always does (He always does)
With His power (with His power)
With His love (with His love)
You can shake your head (you can shake your head)
But I'm delivered through - yes I am
When there was no other way
The Lord came through
The Lord came through
Yeah
