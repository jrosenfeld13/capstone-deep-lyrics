There is no point
No point in time
Thats right for these things
No matter when or the amount
There is no time
Even if you knew a long time before
I hear what you say
I dont believe in you now
There is no place
No place to embrace this
No place to face this
Nowhere thats good, not for these things
There is no space
Then it might just as well happen right here, (but still)
I hear what you say
I dont believe in you now
The weakening sound of your breath and your words
So clearly now, now, now
I dont believe in you now
I dont believe in you now
I dont believe in you now
I dont believe in you now
I do believe in you now, now, now
Theres no way around
I have been through anger denial and hope
I hear what you say
I dont believe in you now
Even the stars
Go into hiding
To flicker and die, die
Something slips through my fingers
And i can no longer do
I dont believe in you now
I do believe in you now
And i can no longer do
What i want to do for you
No way around/past it
Not around these things
In your eyes
Prepare
Still
Prepare  regardless of the amount, no matter the length
Thats right for these things
There is no place thats right for these things
Anyhow
It just might as well happen right here
The loosening grip
The fading
I can no longer do what i want for you
I can no longer do what i want for you
I hear what you say
I dont believe in you now
I do believe in you now
Youve tried to persuade me to let you let go
Youve tried to make me absorb
Regardless of exdperience
The length, to prepare not to get ready in advance ahead early
(acceptance left)
