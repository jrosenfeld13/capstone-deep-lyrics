[English Lyrics]

[Verse 1]
All the banners stop waving
And the flags stop flying
And the silence comes over
Thousands of soldiers, thousands of soldiers

[Pre-Chorus]
Who is that girl? Do I know her face?
Who is that girl?

[Chorus]
Joanni, Joanni wears a golden cross
And she looks so beautiful in her armour
Joanni, Joanni blows a kiss to God
And she never wears a ring on her finger

[Verse 2]
All the cannon are firing
And the swords are clashing
And the horses are charging
And the flags are flying
And the battle is raging
And the bells, the bells are ringing

[Pre-Chorus]
Who is that girl? Do I know her face?
Who is that girl?

[Chorus]
Joanni, Joanni wears a golden cross
And she looks so beautiful in her armour
Joanni, Joanni blows a kiss to God
She never wears a ring on her fingers

[Post-Chorus]
Joanni, Joanni, Joanni, Joanni blows a kiss to God
She just looks beautiful in her armour
Beautiful in her armour

[Bridge]
Elle parle  Dieu et aux anges
Dans ses prires

[Interlude]

[Outro]
Venez Sainte Catherine
Venez Sainte Marguerite
Elle a besoin de vous deux
Les voix, les voix du feu
Chante avec moi petite soeur
Les voix, les voix, les voix
