Saying goodbye is never an easy thing
But you never said, you'd stay forever
So if you must go, darling, I'll set you free
That I know in time, we'll be together

I won't try to stop you now from leaving
'Cuz in my heart I know

Love will lead you back
Someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
Where you belong

I'm sure, sure as stars are shining
One day, you will find me again
It won't be long
One of these days, love will lead you back

One of these nights
I'll hear your voice again
You're gonna say
How much you miss me

You'll walk out this door
But someday, you'll walk back in
Darling I know
I know this will be

Sometimes it takes
Sometime out on your own now to find your way back home

Love will lead you back
Someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
Where you belong

I'm sure, sure as stars are shining
One day, you will find me again
It won't be long
One of these days, love will lead you back

I won't try to stop you now from leavin'
'Cuz in my heart I know

Love will lead you back
Someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
Where you belong

I'm sure, sure as stars are shining
One day, you will find me again
It won't be long
One of these days, love will lead you back

It won't be long, I know
Someday I just know that
Love will lead you back to my arms
Where you belong

I'm sure, sure as stars are shining
One day, you will find me again
It won't be long
One of these days, love will lead you back
One of these days, love will lead you back
