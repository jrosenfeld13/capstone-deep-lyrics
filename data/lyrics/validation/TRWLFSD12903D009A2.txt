Here I am
On an island once again
Hoping I can stay
Far away
In my solitude
In this place I choose

Four winds raising waves
As old ghosts play

Dragons, dreams, and daring deeds
Breathing mystery
Kaleidoscope
Helps me cope with insecurity

Dragons, dreams, and daring deeds
To soar on gilded wing
Fancy free
For we decree a halo for the king

Here I am
Reaching for the promise land
Dancing on a myth
I romance the past in dark embrace
In my secret place

In between the winds
Where breath begins

Dreams and daring deeds
Dreams and daring deeds
Dreams and daring deeds
Dreams and daring deeds
Dreams and daring deeds
