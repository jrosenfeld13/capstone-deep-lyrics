Storm and thunder
Above the city of lies
Keep your public appearance
Be successful or die
Under the bottom
Under your floor
Is a virus in ambush
Knocking at your door

In the city of lies?
Pushing, punching
Shatter, coming
Kicking, hit him
Fighting, running
Tower of madness
But a glowing shine
Fires still burning
At the destruction line
God of thunder
Where are you now?
Are you born to die
In a city of lies?
In the city of lies
