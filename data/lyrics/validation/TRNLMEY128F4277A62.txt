Verse 1
I was looking for the answer all the time
Always looking, never finding
I was empty inside
Falling into darkness
Needing the light to see
Reaching out for shelter
Then He set me free

Chorus
I reached out, You reach out, He'll reach out today
I reached out, You reach out, He'll reach out today

Verse 2
If you're looking for the answer, now this is the time
To stop looking and start finding that feeling inside
You don't need the darkness
When there's a light to see
He'll provide the shelter
And He'll set you free

Repeat Chorus
I'll reach out, I'll reach out
I'll reach out, I'll reach out today
Oh, reach out today
Oh, reach out today
Oh, reach out today
Oh, reach out today
I'll reach out today
