No way to fight this emotion
Even if it's all that I have
Send me in a different direction
Take me down a safer path

I want to stay, someplace where
The wind is blowing
Like yesterday, all my dreams unlaid

Take a look at yourself
Tell us what you think
( In the mirror )

We must remain
This shall not be done in vain
We must remain
Fighting in the rain

Searching deep inside
For the answer
Hoping that it's not undesired
Is there any piece of the puzzle ?
Hidden right in front of my eyes

I want to stay someplace
Where I'm free to follow
A life of peace
Hate gets in the way

Take a look at yourself
Tell us all what you think
( In the mirror )

We must remain
This shall not be done in vain
We must remain
Fighting in the rain

We must remain
This shall not be done in vain
We must remain
Fighting in the rain
