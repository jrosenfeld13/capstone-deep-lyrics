Well, it's hard to live
It's hard to live in the city
Yes, it's hard to live
So hard to live in the city

I've been following you for blocks
And I wish that you would stop and tell me your name
But I couldn't understand
What you told me as you ran away

So just wear your hair down low
Don't let anybody know
That it's hard to live
It's hard to live in the city
Yes, it's hard to live
It's hard to live in the city

There's something about you
That I couldn't tell
And you were always crazy
And I didn't like that
That there's something about you
That I knew so well

To all those questions, I have no answer
I wish that I could sit in the sun

So just wear your hair down low
Don't let anybody know
That it's hard to live
It's hard to live in the city
Yes, it's hard to live
So hard to live in the city

What are you asking?
No need for walking out
You took all I could keep
You couldn't tell me
The look was on your face
I'll fake what we have left

To all those questions, I have no answer
I wish that I could sit in the sun
