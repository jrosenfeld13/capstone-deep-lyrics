[Verse 1]
If you could step into my head
Tell me, would you still know me?
If you woke up in my bed
Tell me, would you hold me
Or would you simply let it lie
Leaving me to wonder why?
I cant get you out of this head
I call mine and I will say

[Chorus]
Oh no, I cant let you go
My little girl
Because youre holding up my world
So I need you
Your imitation of my walk
And the perfect way you talk
Its just a couple of the million things
That I love about you
So I need you
So I need you
So I need you
So I need you

[Verse 2]
And if I jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge
Tell me, would you still follow me?
And if I made you mad today
Tell me, would you love me tomorrow? Please?
Or would you say that you dont care
And then leave me standing here
Like the fool who is drowning in despair
And screaming?

[Chorus]
Oh no, I cant let you go
My little girl
Because youre holding up my world
So I need you
Your imitation of my walk
And the perfect way you talk
Its just a couple of the million things
That I love about you
So I need you
So I need you
So I need you
So I need you

[Bridge]
Im on my own
Im on my own
Im on my own

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, can't let you go
My little girl
Because youre holding up my world
So I need you
Your imitation of my walk
And the perfect way you talk
Its just a couple of the million things
That I love about you
So I need you
So I need you
So I need you
So I need you
Baby, yeah
