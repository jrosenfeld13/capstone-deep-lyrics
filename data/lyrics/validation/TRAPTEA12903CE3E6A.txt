Everyday's a hot summer day
Waiting on
This laid back Sunday with you

All week long a midsummer dream
Promises
A laid back Sunday with you

Oh, my love
Such precious time with you

Walkin', talkin', holdin' hands
Lovin' this
Laid back Sunday with you

Smiles across a cool summer glass
Sharing this
Laid back Sunday with you

Waiting so long
To spend this day with you

Window shopping down at the mall
Groovin' on
This laid back Sunday with you

Checking out the band on the tawn
Diggin' this
Laid back Sunday with you

Perfect day with you
Laid back Sunday, ooh
