[Chorus]
Oh, the snow it melts the soonest when the winds begin to sing

[Verse 1]
And the corn it ripens fastest when the frost is settling in
And when a woman tells me my face she'll soon forget
Before we'll part, I'll wage a croon, she's fain to follow it yet

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
And the swallow skims without a thought as long as it is spring
But when spring goes, and winter blows, my lassie you'll be fain
For all your pride, to follow me across the stormy main

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And the bee that flew when summer shone, in winter cannot sting
I've seen a woman's anger melt betwixt the night and morn
Oh, it's surely not a harder thing to tame a woman's scorn

[Bridge]
Oh, never say me farewell here, no farewell I'll receive
And you shall set me to the stile and kiss and take your leave
I'll stay until the curlew calls and the martlet takes his wing

[Chorus]
