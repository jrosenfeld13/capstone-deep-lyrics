[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
If it's weird for girls to give guys flowers
Then maybe that's a reason to
You're not climbing up my ivory tower
So I'm comin' down for you
Is it wrong to write our names in love hearts?
In the dust that's on the car you drive
Dropping hints can only get you so far
When you don't know that I'm alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it wrong to be the instigator? (is it wrong, is it wrong?)
Is it bad to be the move maker? (no)
Guess I gotta be the first to say-a, to say-a, to say-a

[Chorus]
How do you do?
If you won't say it, I will
How do you do?
I'm really pleased to meet you
How do you do?
Gotta say it how I feel it
Say it or I will

[Verse 2]
When you're hanging at the point of stalemate
It's not the time to bite your tongue
So at the risk of lookin' really stupid
I'm gonna take the plunge

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it wrong to be the instigator? (no)
Is it bad to be the move maker? (no)
Guess I gotta be the first to say-a, to say-a, to say-a (to say-a)

[Chorus]
How do you do? (How do you do?)
If you won't say it, I will
How do you do? (How do you do?)
I'm really pleased to meet you
How do you do?
Gotta say it how I feel it
Say it or I will
Say it or I will (say it or I will)

[Bridge]
It's not good enough just to sit around drinking tea
Touching only on weather, exchanging pleasantries
I've been too reserved too circumspect
Sick of crossing wires, now I wanna connect

[Chorus]
How do you do?
If you won't say it, I will
How do you do?
I'm really pleased to meet you
How do you do?
Gotta say it how I feel it
Gotta say it how I feel it
Say it or I will
Say it or I will
Say it or I will
Gotta say it how I feel it
Say it or I will
Say it or I will
How do you do?
If you won't say it, I will
How do you do?
I'm really pleased to meet you
How do you do?
Gotta say it how I feel it
Say it or I will
