What's your name? (Peter and Bob)
What's your age? (we're 23)
Where do you live? (we live on the farm)
What do you do? (we plant weed)
We gotta do what we do 'cause we can't draw dough
We've gotta earn our living
But can't return to jobs what come on in June
Time goes another week's wages, bang goes another week's food

What happened next? (policemen come)
What did they do? (they make a rage)
What did you do? (we've stood still)
What did they do? (they drove away)
We try to seat in the fields to prepare our weed
We've gotta earn our living
And when the lawsuit come and took away our weed
Bang went another week's wages, bang went the family's feed

A-hey diddle diddle, policemen on the fiddle
He sold all the drugs to the man in the middle
He put it on the plane but he throw central
It was picked up by a hippie and it hurts car rental
Throb it into town and split it to him parson
Sold it to his friends at the net nick party
He took about a light, but missed all the points, points, points, points, points, points, points
He sat crossed legged and passed around the joint
So that he can help the West Indian export
He took about a light but missed all the points, points, points, points, points, points, points
Till we back on the farm
We're still working hard
We've got deadlines to meet
We're rushed off our feet
We've got to replant the feed and next land miles to grow
And we've gotta earn our living
But if the crops don't show, we're gonna starve
Fine goes another year's wages, goodbye to life on the farm
