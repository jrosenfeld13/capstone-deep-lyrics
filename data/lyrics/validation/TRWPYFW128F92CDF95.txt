How I'd love to be around you
When the lonely night surrounds you
How I'd love to be alone with you

What I'd give to have the power
To read your mind one hour
How I'd love to be alone with you

Just to be with you one night
You and me alone
Kiss your lips and hold you tight
Have you for my own

This would be a joy unending
Could be a real beginning
How I'd love to be alone with you

How I'd love to be around you
When the lonely night surrounds you
How I'd love to be alone with you

If I only knew for certain
I'd cut out all my flirtin'
How I'd love to be alone with you

Just to be with you one night
You and me alone
Kiss your lips and hold you tight
Have you for my own

Won't you try to be my baby
Just for once and then well maybe
I could always be alone with you

Won't you try to be my baby
Just for once and then well maybe
I could always be alone with you
And I could always be alone with you...
