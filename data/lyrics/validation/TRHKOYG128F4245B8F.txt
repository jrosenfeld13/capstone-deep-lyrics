And I thought that you had everything that you wanted me for
And I thought you wanted me to need all I wanted you for
But you can have your pretty way
Makes you want to sleep all day
All day
Here come the girls
Here come the girls
Speaking quietly, boy, you wanted her, and I don't mind
I don't care
And I thought that you had everything that you wanted before
And I thought you wanted me to need all I wanted you for
But you can have your pretty way
Makes you want to sleep all day
All day
Here come the girls
Here come the girls
Speaking quietly, boy, you wanted her, and I don't mind
I don't care
I care, then I don't care, well, I don't care
The wait that you are waiting for is waiting for you
