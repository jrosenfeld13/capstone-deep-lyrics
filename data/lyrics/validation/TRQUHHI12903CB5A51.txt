I dream often of sovereign panic
Are you listening to me?
You said, "All you ever talk about is falling in love."
I said, "Hey! It's a complicated chemical reaction!"

Now they're turning me off
Because my other shit's boring
And do you catch me off guard?

I walked alone down the street
On a concrete walk thinking my life was boring
"All you ever talk about it losing your style."
I said, "Hey! It's not easy being in it to win it!"

Now we know who you are
And we know you've been greedy
We know where you sleep
Hey man!

Hypocrites rain from the sky
Well they rain from the sky
Hypocrites rain from the sky
Well they rain from the sky
So cover your eyes

You were talking so loud with your mouth sewn shut
Everyone's freaking the fuck out
'Cause you take what you get and you promise it
[???]

I said, "Everything worth doing is worth dying alone for."
I said, "Everything you need to be free will be ignored."

It's a shotgun wedding
When you were shooting down a mountain in turn
You scream ah, ah ah
You should know this is troubling
You should know this is troubling
