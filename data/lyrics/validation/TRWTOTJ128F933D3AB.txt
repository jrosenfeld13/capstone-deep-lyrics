Waking up on the battlefield
Fears lie like gunfire in our eyes
Can't change the way we feel
It hurts us every time

Throwing hearts that will never heal
There's nothing left in here

And we fight while we cry
It's surrender, do or die
And we don't know why

This is a sad song, wounded and war-torn
With words that make your heart ache
This is a sad song, this is our goodbye

This is a sad song for all the long gone
With melodies that kill me
This is a sad song, so sing with me tonight
Just sing with me

This bed is a battlefield
All alone with your memories in my heart
Lie awake and my fate is sealed
You haunt me in the dark

Love, you are the death of me
One touch you can make me bleed

And we fight while we cry
It's surrender, do or die
And we don't know why

This is a sad song, wounded and war-torn
With words that make your heart ache
This is a sad song, this is our goodbye

This is a sad song for all the long gone
With melodies that kill me
This is a sad song, so sing with me tonight
Just sing with me

This is a sad song, wounded and war-torn
With words that make your heart ache
This is a sad song, this is our goodbye

This is a sad song for all the long gone
With melodies that kill me
This is a sad song, so sing with me tonight
Just sing with me

A battle field, it's a battle field
It's a battlefield
March with me, march with me

March with me
March, march with me
March with me, march with me

(This is a sad song)
Will you march with me?
(This is a sad song)
Will you march with me?

(This is a sad song)
Who will march with me?
(This is a sad song)

This is a sad song
This is a sad song
