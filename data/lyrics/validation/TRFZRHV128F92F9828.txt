Keep on warin' 'cause that's what got us here
Keep on talkin' till there's no one else to fear
See, me and my brother might not be around next year
'Cause one or another, cap slipped out of gear
In this sick world I see the babies dyin'
From car bombs and blind eyes and prophet's lyin'
In this sick world I'm feelin' all alone
To reap the seeds of which we've sown
In this sick world I keep my mind just tight
In this sick world I never punk the fight
In this sick world I never saw no light
So this sick world is blowin' up tonight
Freaks come out at night
Freaks come out at night
Freaks come out at night
Freaks come out at night
Freaks come out at night
Freaks come out at night
Freaks come out at night
Freaks come out at night
Keep on searchin' on this starless night
Keep on preachin', every thing's gonna be all right
Now load the weapon, these kids are just the age
Have them kill the Texan and the man who takes his place
In this sick world I see the babies dyin'
From car bombs and blind eyes and prophet's lyin'
In this sick world I'm feelin' all alone
To reap the seeds of which we've sown
In this sick world I keep my mind just tight
In this sick world I never punk the fight
In this sick world I never saw no light
So this sick world is blowin' up tonight
Freaks come out at night
Freaks come out at night
Freaks come out at night
Freaks come out at night
Freaks come out at night
Freaks come out at night
Freaks come out at night
Freaks come out at night
Freaks come out at night
Freaks come out at night
Freaks come out at night
Freaks come out at night
Freaks come out at night
Freaks come out at night
Freaks come out at night
Freaks come out at night
Keep on warin', keep on talkin'
Keep on searchin', keep on preachin'
Keep on warin', yeah, keep on talkin'
Keep on searchin', keep on preachin'
Keep on warin'
