[I. A Moment Frozen In Time]

When I long for the truth
When I search for my youth
That's when I call out your name, inside myself
Deep inside I know there's something to re-live

Day after day, life can be so hard
I need the strength to carry on
That's when I wait for you to come back
And turn wrong to right
With a word I'll be setting my spirit free
With a word I'll be where I am meant to be
And so I await for you to come back
Yes, I await for the spirit to rise

Rise! Rise!

When I long for the truth
When I search for my youth
That's when I call out your name, inside myself
Deep inside I know there's something to re-live

Day after day, life can be so hard
I need the strength to carry on
That's when I wait for you to come back and turn wrong to right
With a word I'll be setting my spirit free
With a word I'll be setting my spirit free
With a word I'll be where I am meant to be
With a word I'll be where I am meant to be

[Chorus]
Ancient Spirit will rise, right from my soul
Ancient Spirit will rise, and sound a heavy tone
Ancient Spirit will rise, from inside of me
Ancient Spirit will rise, he will set me free

Ancient Spirit will rise, Ancient Spirit will rise

[II. The Future Memories of a Glorious Past]

There was a time was sang of battles won
Of golden kingdoms, shining diamonds and pearls
Then suddenly all of these treasures turned to dust
Leaders of men bargain the glory of our past

And I can't explain the things I begged and borrowed
Now in front of me there's just a stale tomorrow

Domains were glittering like suns on windy seas
Amazing castles where the talent could be free
But now the same old games are blackening the sun
True art is buried by an army of one-track minds

And I can't explain the things I begged and borrowed
And I don't want to live in a world so full of sorrow
A world with no tomorrow
A world so full of sorrow
A world without tomorrow

[Chorus]
Ancient Spirit will rise, right from my soul
Ancient Spirit will rise, and sound a heavy tone
Ancient Spirit will rise, from inside of me
Ancient Spirit will rise, he will set me free

Ancient Spirit will rise
My Ancient Spirit will guide me right, to the end of time
And I wait for this moment to come for all my life
My Ancient Spirit will rise
