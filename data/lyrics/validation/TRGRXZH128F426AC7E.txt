Will the earth sink into the abyss of nothingness
With naught but thick blackness
And have I followed the will of my own
No, I don't think I'm any better than you
If the circle gets all straightened up
Then comes the age of northern winds
No one is crowned, Let this word be weighed
I've washed my hands to hold you close
Well, I'm dead serious tonight and I'll have it now
Set out to sing, Baby, To sing the verses of fall
When there are no more words left
That's the right thing to do, Right on yeah
Well, I'm dead serious tonight and I'll have it now
Set out to sing, Baby, To sing the verses of fall
When there are no more words left
That's the right thing to do
It's not a question of who's the meanest motherfucker on earth
It's not a question of who gives or who doesn't give a fuck
"Maahan miehet, Maahan miekat, Maahan..."
