[Intro]
When I think that I'm over you
I'm overpowered

[Verse 1]
Your data my data
The chromosomes match
Exact as in matter
A matter of fact

These amaranth feelings
A cognitive state
Need the love object
To reciprocate

[Pre-Chorus]
When I think that I'm over you
I'm overpowered
It's long overdue
I'm overpowered
When I think that I'm over you
I'm overpowered
It's long overdue
I'm overpowered

[Chorus]
As science struggles on to try to explain
Oxy-toxin's flowing ever into my brain
As science struggles on to try to explain
Oxy-toxin's flowing ever into my brain

[Verse 2]
A chemical reason
If reason's your game
A chemical needing
Is there in the brain

With preprogrammed meanings
Like a little more pep
Alien feelings
We have to accept

[Pre-Chorus]
When I think that I'm over you
I'm overpowered
It's long overdue
I'm overpowered
When I think that I'm over you
I'm overpowered
It's long overdue
I'm overpowered

[Chorus]
As science struggles on to try to explain
Oxy-toxin's flowing ever into my brain
As science struggles on to try to explain
Oxy-toxin's flowing ever into my brain

[Outro]
I'm overpowered
