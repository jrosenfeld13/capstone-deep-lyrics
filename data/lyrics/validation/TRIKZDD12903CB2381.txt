Crane

Save me! save me! save me! save me!
Wake up in the night, stare into the dark
You can feel your fear tearing at your heart
Trying to lock the door, there is no escape
Ill be watching you, every move you make
Someone please, please help me
No one will save you,though they try
Someone please, please help me
Everyone's lonely when they die
Everyone's lonely when they die
No one in the world's gonna love you - save me!
No one in the world will need you - save me!
No one in the world will kiss you - save me!
No one in the world will love you - save me!
Save me! save me! save me! save me!
Walking down the street,footsteps close behind
Dare not turn your head,don't know what you'll find
Trying to shout for help,your words turn to dust
Looking for a friend, no one you can trust
Someone please, please help me
No one will save you,though they try
Someone please, please help me
Everyone's lonely when they die
Everyone's lonely when they die
No one in the world will love you - save me!
No one in the world will kiss you - save me!
No one in the world will hug you - save me!
No one in the world will want you - save me!
Save me! save me! save me! save me!
