Gristle, bile and grime
Infesting every surface
Surreal patterns of rouge
The penance of being careless

The need for professional
Containment of disease

Scour scrub and wipe
Yearning for a sparkle
Underneath the human waste
Reveal the tiles and marble

Dial 1-800-mess-be-gone
For all your clean-up needs
A drug addled enthusiasm
Compensates our lack of expertise

A predilection for gore
An unhealthy zest
A psychotic fixation
In dealing with death

Scooping up remains
Pouring into tins and jugs
Redistribute the filth
Regurgitate the past
