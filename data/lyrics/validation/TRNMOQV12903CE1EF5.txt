I am what I am, I am my own special creation
So come take a look, give me the hook or the ovation
It's my world that I want to have a little pride in
My world and it's not a place I have to hide in
Life's not worth a damn 'til you can say
Hey world, I am what I am
I am what I am, I don't want praise, I don't want pity
I bang my own drum some think it's noise I think it's pretty
And so what if I love each sparkle and each bangle
Why not try to see things from a different angle
Your life is a sham 'til you can shout out loud
I am what I am
I am what I am and what I am needs no excuses
I deal my own deck sometimes the ace, sometimes the deuces
There's one life and it's no return and no deposit
One life, so it's time to open up your closet
Life's not worth a damn 'til you shout
Hey world, I am what I am
