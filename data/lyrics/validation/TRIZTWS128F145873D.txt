I'm a man with something to say
I don't need nobody to show me the way
I don't care if it's day or if it's night
There ain't nobody who's gonna teach me wrong from right

Cause every hungry woman
Has tried to make a fool out of me
Every hungry woman
Stick around and baby you'll see
I'm cold hearted
I'm so cold hearted

I'm a man with a mind of my own
I don't need nobody, I'm happy all alone
I don't care if it's day or if it's night
There ain't nobody who's gonna teach me wrong from right

Cause every hungry woman
Has tried to make a fool out of me
Every hungry woman
Stick around and baby you'll see
I'm cold hearted
I'm so cold hearted
I'm cold hearted
I'm so cold hearted

Let me show you why they call me cold hearted, baby

Every hungry woman
Has tried to make a fool out of me
Every hungry woman
Stick around and baby you'll see

I'm cold hearted
I'm so cold hearted
I'm cold hearted
I'm so cold hearted
Baby, I tell you I've got a heart that's made of stone
