[Verse 1]
Soldiers of Islam are loading their guns
They're getting ready
But the Russian tanks are mowing them down
They're getting ready
There's children in Africa with tommy guns
Getting ready
While the Islam armies are beckoning on
They're getting ready

[Chorus]
There's a burning sun
And it sets in the western world
But it rises in the east
And pretty soon
It's gonna burn your temples down

[Verse 2]
While the heads of state are having their fun
Are they ready?
We're looking at the world through the barrel of a gun
Are we ready?
And you stand there beating on your little war drum
Are you ready?
And it won't be long before your time has come
Are you ready?

[Chorus] (X2)

[Verse 3]
Warhead, warhead, warhead
Warhead, warhead, warhead
Warhead, warhead, warhead
Warhead, warhead, warhead

Well I don't know what it is but i feel something coming
Stuck in the middle of the Yankees and the Russians
Better get moving guns are getting loaded
Fast to the border where the tanks are a rolling
There's a nation in fear another nation crying
One nation killing and another nation dying
Talk about guns and escalation bye bye planet let alone a nation
