It's the same four walls that have always been
Just sitting in my room that I haven't lived in
And I feel so completely changed
But everything around me is exactly the same

I'm not the girl that I was before
Feel like I'm lying each time I walk through the door
Sleeping in my own bed feels like a sin
It's hard to sink back into my life again

The walls are empty
Floors are messy like I left them
But now it seems I'm going in a different direction
I can't believe I'm a stranger in my own room
Feel like nothing is mine
And it all belongs to you

I'm not the girl that I was before
Feel like I'm lying each time I walk through the door
Sleeping in my own bed feels like a sin
It's hard to sink back into my life again

The clothes are all scattered through my room
Just like my memories of you
I want to tell you what I've done
But the tears in your eyes are beginning to run
I wanted to love you like I said I would
I know you don't believe me but I tried to be good

Now I feel trapped in a room that's not mine
Looking at all the things you left behind
It's strange to go through so much
Then come home to the all the same old stuff

I'm not the girl that I was before
Feel like I'm lying each time I walk through the door
Sleeping in my own bed feels like a sin
It's hard to sink back into my life again
I'm not the girl that I was before
Feel like I'm lying each time I walk through the door
Sleeping in my own bed feels like a sin
It's hard to sink back into my life again

I'm not the girl that I was before
I'm not the girl that I was before
I'm not the girl that I was before
