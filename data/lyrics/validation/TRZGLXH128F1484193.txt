Shut up, shut up
Shut up, shut up

Shed our cold
Realada
Reala reala
Relajarse

Look, look up
Relajarse, angels see
They cant see then, sorry
Sheer and spooky

The other ones transact
(Made your life screwed up, screwed up)
Must carry this I have inside me everywhere to share
So we are to learn

Get up all (screwed it up)
We had to do (screwed it up)
Reala reala (screwed it up)
Relajarse (screwed it up)

Look, look up (screwed it up)
Relajarse, angels see (screwed it up)
They cant see then, sorry (screwed it up)
Sheer and spooky (screwed it up)

The other ones transact
(Made your life screwed up, screwed up)
Must carry this I have inside me everywhere to share
So we are to learn

Shut up, shut up

The other ones transact
(Made your life screwed up, screwed up)
Must carry this I have inside me everywhere to
Launch my summering this way
Relajarse
Relajarse
Relajarse
Relajarse
Relajarse
Relajarse
Relajarse
Relajarse

The other ones transact
(Made your life screwed up, screwed up)
Must carry this I have inside me everywhere to share

Shut up, shut up

The other ones transact
(Made my life screwed up, screwed up)
Must carry this I have inside me everywhere to share

Shut up, shut up

The other ones transact
(Made my life screwed up, screwed up)
Must carry this I have inside me everywhere to share

To realize you are but a liar
