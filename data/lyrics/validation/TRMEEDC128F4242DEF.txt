So uncertain I double as a shadow or someone who doesn't understand
Blatant or misshapen and far too weary to pretend to understand
In my mind's eye, I am love's pauper and I am going nowhere
But, I know there's a little piece of heaven - a piece of heaven somewhere
Idly, Idly, please come take my hand
Somewhere I know there is a castle floating in the air
Idly I am taking my time but someday, I will be there
Idly, Idly, Idly, please come take my hand
