[Verse 1]
Dont forget that love is all around
Its here to lift you up and hold you when youre down
Theres a helping hand, someone who cares and understands
With you all the while, someone wholl never stop until they make you smile

[Chorus]
I know that there lies a rainbow at the end of every storm
We only need one tiny ray of light to help us through the dawn
Just keep on searching for the positive in the possibility
And you will never let go of your hopes and your dreams
We will rise like the tides of the sea

[Verse 2]
Please believe youll never be alone
So dont you be afraid when youre facing the unknown
Let the power of your faith guide you through challenges you face
Any tears you may cry, let them wash away the pain thats in your life

[Chorus]
I know that there lies a rainbow at the end of every storm
We only need one tiny ray of light to help us through the dawn
Just keep on searching for the positive in the possibility
And you will never let go of your hopes and your dreams
We will rise like the tides of the sea

[Bridge]
Never give up trying to make the world smile
We must find a way that every man and woman, every child
Has a chance to find a rainbow

[Chorus]
I know that there lies a rainbow at the end of every storm
We only need one tiny ray of light to help us through the dawn
Just keep searching for the positive in the possibility
And youll never let go of your hopes and your dreams
Ill be there for youwill you be there for me?
We will rise like the tides of the sea

[Outro]
Oh, we will rise out of the stormy sea
Rising, rising, rising, rising
