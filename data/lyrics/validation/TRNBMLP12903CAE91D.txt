I can't take her light
She's walking dynamite
We go sin for sin
Sometimes I wish I'd been more careful

She's got her lights on low
You better come on slow
The way she keeps her late night promises
It's all to let you know

She'll put an arrow thru your heart
Arrow thru your heart
She'll put an arrow thru your heart
Put an arrow thru your heart

Monday-I need her
Tuesday-I need her more
Wednesday-still no answer when
Thursday-I know she's home
She calls late, late Friday night
Whatever's wrong she will make it right
Saturday-I get my way
But Sunday-I need her again

She'll put an arrow thru your heart
An arrow thru your heart
Arrow thru your heart
An arrow thru your heart
Another arrow thru your heart
Yeah an arrow thru your heart
Need to hit me hard
Arrow through your heart
An arrow thru your heart

She'll put an arrow thru your heart
Arrow thru your heart
She'll put an arrow thru your heart again
An arrow thru your heart again
Arrow thru your heart
(Arrow thru your heart)
Arrow thru your heart
Arrow thru your heart
Arrow thru your heart
Arrow thru your heart
Arrow thru your heart, yeah
Put an arrow thru your heart
Put an arrow thru your heart
Arrow thru your heart
Arrow thru your heart
