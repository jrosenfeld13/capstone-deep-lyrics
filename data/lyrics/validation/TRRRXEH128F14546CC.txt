When we get together
I always hope there'll be nice weather
Between us there's nothing worse
Than when you turn into a thunderstorm with me

How do I help you?
And how do you help me?
We'll buy an umbrella
And we might be safe from the turbulent weather

How do I help you?
And how do you help me?
We'll buy an umbrella
And we might be safe from the turbulent weather

When we get together
I always hope there'll be nice weather
Between us there's nothing worse
Than when you turn into a thunderstorm with me

How do I help you?
And how do you help me?
We'll buy an umbrella
And we might be safe from the turbulent weather

La la la...
