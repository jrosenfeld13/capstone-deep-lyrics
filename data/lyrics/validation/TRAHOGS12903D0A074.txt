Free the will to try
Adapting over time
Feel no wealth inside for the last ones
For the last ones

Hear my last words
This my last regret
Hear my last words
This my last regret

Kill the will to die
Innocence it all seemed right
Dreaming darkness lies for the last ones
Freedom is denied
For the last ones

Hear my last words
This my last regret
Hear my last words
This my last regret

Hear my last words
This my last regret
Hear my last words
This my last regret
