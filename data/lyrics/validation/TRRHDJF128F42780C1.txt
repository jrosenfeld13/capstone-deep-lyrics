Hey what would you do, caught between Death - Death and a zoo?
What if your world was stuck in a cage would you feel rage boy?
Caught in a crossfire, stung by the cold wire
Would it feel lonely?

Hey what would you give so that your heart in freedom could live?
What if your love was stuck in a cage, hey don't you feel rage boy?
Caught in a landslide, where does the child hide?
Oh does he feel lonely?

So cold on the inside, where does the Sun hide?
Oh don't it feel lonely? lonely'

Caught in a man's dream, silent the heart scream
Don't it feel lonely?'
