Meet me on the highway
Meet me on the road
As long as you've got to travel
Don't you want someone to help you carry your load?

First time out is a heady feeling
White clouds under my feet
Sailing along like a south wind
Over a fields of whispering wheat

Thinking alone on a Thursday morning
Of peace and love and war
I still don't have any answer
But I don't get high anymore

Meet me on the highway
Meet me on the road
As long as you've got to travel
Don't you want someone to help you carry your load?

Some folks are forever moving
And some folks gotta be still
Don't let it get you, there's joy in either
So do what you will
Everyone knows it's the same old feeling
Worlds below the sea
Just you and me and easy
Is where I wanna be

Meet me on the road
As long as you've got to travel
Don't you want someone to help you carry your load?
Carry, carry, I'll help you carry your load
