Through A Screen
I see you through a screen
I never knew just what it means
And if i could start again
I think you would be through a screen
You saw me just as i was leaving
You took me off my feet
All night you kept me believing
In the morning i'd be complete
You left me not the way you found me
You called me not by my name
Just ask me anything you want babe
In the morning i'll take the blame
Through a screen
You know what i mean
I think i'm so obscene
