Don't the clocks turn back this evening?
Another hour for you, to try and forget
To try and correct, your mistakes
And yes I know I'm wrong, but there's two sides to every story
Baby we are not the same
And we will never feel the same

Oh oh oh am I in trouble?
Darling I apologise
I need you more than anything
Please come back with me tonight
And oh oh oh I am in trouble
Darling i apologise
I need you more than anything
Please don't ever leave my side

These gentle twists, these gentle turns
We're getting awfully close
I have my suspicions that some things wrong, you know I should have stayed and talked
But oh I grabbed my shoes and I left the room singing oh oh oh what can I do
Baby there is no need to fight
Darling there is no need to hide

Oh oh oh am I in trouble?
Darling I apologise
I need you more, than anything
Please come back with me tonight
Oh oh oh am I in trouble
Darling I apologise
I missed you more than anything
Please don't ever leave my side
