[Intro]
March on, worker bees!
Know your enemy!

[Verse 1]
We take our orders given by the queen
Were not the killers, were the worker bees
If you resist us, you will feel our sting
Surrender now before the swarm sets in

[Pre-Chorus]
Protect the hive from enemies!
Protect the hive from enemies!
Follow the herd mentality!
Can we fight to save our souls?

[Pre-Verse]
March on, worker bees!
Know your enemy!

[Verse 2]
A pollination coming from the West
And in a flash we will invade your nest
Supply of honey flowing bottomless
Play by our rules or youll be powerless

[Pre-Chorus]
Protect the hive from enemies!
Protect the hive from enemies!
Follow the herd mentality!
Can we fight to save our souls?

[Chorus]
And we'll march!
Along with our blindfolds on
And we'll ride!
The rails with our pistols drawn
Can the Lord..
Above forgive what we've done?
Can we fight to save our souls?

And we'll march!
Along with our blindfolds on
And we'll ride!
The rails with our pistols drawn
Can the Lord..
Above forgive what we've done?

Can we fight to save our souls?
Can we fight to save our souls?

[Chorus]
And we'll march!
Along with our blindfolds on
And we'll ride!
The rails with our pistols drawn
Can the Lord..
Above forgive what we've done?
Can we fight to save our souls?

And we'll march!
Along with our blindfolds on
And we'll ride!
The rails with our pistols drawn
Can the Lord..
Above forgive what we've done?

Can we fight to save our souls?
Can we fight to save our souls?
Will we die to save our home?
