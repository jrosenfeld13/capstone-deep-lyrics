Jay:
If you want my love
Come and get it girl
And if you want me for a toy
Do I have a choice?
I don't know

Frankie:
If you want my love
Come and get it boy
And if you want to be my friend
Through thick and thin
You can fill in
That's no sin

Having big fun

Frankie, Stacey and Jay:
Cos I'm gonna love you (I'm gonna love ya)
Each and every day (each and every day)
No more work (no more work)
