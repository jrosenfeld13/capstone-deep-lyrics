I don't like the way you breathe in my car
I don't like the way you exploit my heart
Your teeth make a better seatbelt
Your love tastes better with food stamps

My car is a substitute for your body
I got it to bring along to Cincinnati

All my kids danced in, in loose traffic

I don't like the way you treat my kids
(You bruised my kids)
I don't like the way you treat my kids
(When you brag about my kids)
I don't like the way you treat my kids
(You bruised my kids)
I don't like the way you treat my kids
(When you brag about my kids)

All my kids danced in, in loose traffic
