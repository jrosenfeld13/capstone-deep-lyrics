[Verse 1]
One more!
Well i heard steve earle had lots of wives
About as many as cats have lives
Met him on his records and we're good friends
He writes a song for everyone
They fall in love and before it's done
He writes an even better one when it ends
Well i don't have to take your name
And you won't have to take the blame

[Chorus]
Steve earle, steve earle, please write a song for me
I promise i won't take a dime when it comes my time to leave
The others wanted your whole heart, but i just want your sleeve
Steve earle, steve earle, please write a song for me

[Verse 2]
Well i heard he loves each one the same
As much as ireland loves the rain
Steve, it rains at my house everyday
He met 'em all in every port
Cause falling in love is a pilgrim sport
And as long as i can be the pirate, i'm ok!
You moved to the city. Baby, you had to go
But i love apples and i could learn to love the snow

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Come on!
I could walk around in your favorite shoes
Come on, just one line
What do you got to lose?
And i don't bruise

[Outro]
Steve earle, steve earle, please write a song for me
I promise i won't take a dime when it comes my time to leave
The others wanted your whole heart, but i just want your sleeve
[Spoken]
And the shirt that goes with it cause it smells like you, and you know i like to sleep in that in the vacation house at the
Beach and a really small wedding, only 'bout 500 people
Did i tell you i have kids?
You're gonna love 'em
They're gonna need to go to college
Do you like reggae?
I love reggae
On tuesday nights, i like to go to trivia, so that's your night to go out with the boys and then you can...
Is this thing on?
Steve earle, steve earle, please write a song for me
