My imagination wants to see
The vivid colours of reality
There's a place out there beyond my grasp
A revolution in a looking glass
I've got to get this problem off my chest
I'm sick and tired of being second best
I'll rearrange my credibility
A fundraiser for a restless sea

Don't ever doubt me
What's come over you?
Won't you forgive me?
What are you gonna do?
Don't ever doubt me
What's come over you?
Won't you forgive me?
What are you gonna do?
What will you do?

I can't contain what's inside my head
I'm using words that I must have read
Do you remember the time we spent?
It seems that we were the main event
Have you a reason to behave like this?
Maybe you need a psychoanalyst
If you keep pushing me out of the door, for sure
You'll never see me again

No one to talk to
What am I gonna do?
You're never there
Right when I need you
Give me a cause
Give me a reason
For your applause
I'll commit treason

And in my mind
I know I'm right
It's the same thing every night
You're not to blame
So don't you cry
You don't need me
So hurt my pride
And all the time
I know we tried
Line by line
And side by side
And still I pray
That we'll get by
But it don't seem real
And I don't know why

And in my mind
I know I'm right
It's the same thing
Every night
You're not to blame
So don't you cry
You don't need me
So hurt my pride
And in my mind
I know I'm right
It's the same thing
Every night
Why do you cry?
You're not to blame
When will you change
This sad refrain?

This sad refrain
Oh, when will you change
This sad refrain?
When will you change
This sad refrain?
