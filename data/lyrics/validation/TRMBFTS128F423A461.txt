Initiation into a whole other realm of being
Into a new way of becoming
Transfiguration
A step into the rest
A true condition
An embrace into the depth
Embrace the depth

To be where you need to be
To be where you want to be
To see what you need to see
To see what you cannot see

Initation
Balance beam on the cross
Lightbringer to the lost
Appreciation of all and nil that's gone
An affirmation of what one has become

To be where you need to be
To be where you want to be
To see what you need to see
To see what you cannot see
