[Verse 1]
And so far we had someone
That doesn't work for everyone
But I'm thinking this could be the one
If we put our minds to it
And I came round today
And you thought I had so much to say
And I know you hate seeing me this way
But I'm having fun

[Chorus 1]
You realize, you realize
It's real life, it's real life
You realize, you realize
It's real life, it's real life
It's real life, it's real life

[Chorus 2]
Trying to prove you're alright
And losing track of the time
Even when the Summer's passing by

[Verse 2]
And bringing it down to focus
And try to bring it down but I'm hopeless
And we should write this down, so we can remember it
And yes there was a time
When we were two of a kind
But now I can't even remember why

[Chorus 1]
You realize, you realize
It's real life, it's real life
You realize, you realize
It's real life, it's real life
It's real life, it's real life

[Chorus 2]
Trying to prove you're alright
And losing track of the time
Even when the Summer's passing by
