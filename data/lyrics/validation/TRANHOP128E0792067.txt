I give up on living my return than I ever wanted I know
That anytime I want to feel right I just run into the wrong light
I'm looking down the barrel of no fun
I might as well be the only one left in hell
I might was well become
It was never my biggest concern
My boredom was so frightening that I know
That anytime I want to feel right I just run into the wrong light
I'm looking down the barrel of no fun
I just don't feel right and my mind is coming on
Even when I can tell myself that I'm barely gonna run
Even when all the chemicals are responsible fun
