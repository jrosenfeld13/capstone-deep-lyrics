Living, loving, searching for nothing
If all the classics go out of fashion
What will we do with all of the passion?

Because the shape of punk to come
Never came and will never come

Dennis, are you listening?
Is there something that I'm missing?
Where is the passion?
Was it just fiction?
If that's the best that we can do
Well, I'd rather be dead

Because the shape of punk to come
Never came and will never come

Sometimes false hope is better than nothing at all
Sometimes a dying breath can make true words
Sometimes false hope is better than nothing at all
Sometimes a dying breath can make true words
