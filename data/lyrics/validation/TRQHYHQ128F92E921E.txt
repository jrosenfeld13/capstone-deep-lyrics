[Verse 1]
Beautiful girl, lovely dress
High school smiles, oh yes
Beautiful girl, lovely dress
Where she is now, I can only guess

[Chorus]
Cause it's gone daddy gone
The love is gone
Yeah, it's gone daddy gone
The love is gone
Yeah, it's gone daddy gone
The love is gone
Yeah, it's gone daddy gone
The love is gone away

[Verse 2]
When I see you
Eyes will turn blue
When I see you
A thousand eyes turning blue

[Chorus]
Cause it's gone daddy gone
The love is gone
It's gone daddy gone
The love is gone
Yeah, it's gone daddy gone
The love is gone
Yeah, it's gone daddy gone
The love is gone away

[Verse 3]
Tell by the way you that you switch and walk
I can see by the way that you baby talk
I can know by the way that you treat your man
I can love you, baby, it's a cryin'

[Chorus]
Cause it's gone daddy gone
The love is gone
Yes, it's gone daddy gone
The love is gone
Gone daddy gone
(The love is gone)
Yeah, it's gone daddy gone
(The love is gone)

[Verse 4]
Beatiful girl, lovely dress
15 smiles, oh yes
Beautiful girl, lovely dress
Where she is now, I can only guess

[Chorus]
Cause it's gone daddy gone
(The love is gone)
Yeah, it's gone daddy gone
(The love is gone)
Said it's gone daddy gone
(The love is gone)
Yeah, it's gone daddy gone
The love is gone away
Gone away (way, way)
Gone away
Gone away
