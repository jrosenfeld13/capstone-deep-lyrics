Too bad
Let's make it of what we have
Life gets so hard without the best
Can't send this down
I'm sick of this life when it comes out of me...

How does it feel, you wanna know?
I'm so distraught
I can't be left alone
Never, seems forever
Days still take down in December

See into this break
And the memories here tell me
Do they care, to care?
When will I lose this burden I wear?
And do they care, to care?

Get you back into my life
Gotta get you
Get you back into my life
There's no way that I can do this right
Gotta get you
Get you back into my life
Yeah...

How could this be a day to me?
You're nothing like a shame to me
Regretful thoughts they break me
Make me see, without you I can't be me

See into your brown eyes
Turn into your brown eyes
See why your world is down
And I don't make a sound
I just wanna see you
Just wanna be you
Cause I don't wanna let you down...

See into this break
And the memories here tell me
Do they care, to care?
When will I lose this bruden I wear?
And tell me
Do they care, to care?

Get you back into my life
Gotta get you
Get you back into my life
There's no way that I can do this right
Gotta get you
Get you back into my life

Please go to sleep
And never mind the love
I get the moment alone again
Then you're here again
Again
Again
Again
Again...
