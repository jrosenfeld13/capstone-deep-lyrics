Fame is but a fruit tree
So very unsound
It can never flourish
til its stock is in the ground
So men of fame
Can never find a way
til time has flown
Far from their dying day

Forgotten while youre here
Remembered for a while
A much updated ruin
From a much outdated style

Life is but a memory
Happened long ago
Theatre full of sadness
For a long forgotten show
Seems so easy
Just to let it go on by
til  you stop and wonder
Why you never wondered why

Safe in the womb
Of an everlasting night
You find the darkness can
Give the brightest light
Safe in your place deep in the earth
Thats when theyll know what you were truly worth

Forgotten while youre here
Remembered for a while
A much updated ruin
From a much outdated style

Fame is but a fruit tree
So very unsound
It can never flourish
til its stock is in the ground
So men of fame
Can never find a way
til time has flown
Far from their dying day

Fruit tree, fruit tree
No-one knows you but the rain and the air
Dont you worry
Theyll stand and stare when youre gone

Fruit tree, fruit tree
Open your eyes to another year
Theyll all know
That you were here when youre gone
