A breathless drive on a downtown street
A motor-bike ride in the midday heat
The dust that hung from the desert skies
Run though we'd run it still burned our eyes

Oh yes we may walk on the wild wild side of life
And our movements traced by a stranger close by your side
And in the shadows of a promise you can take my hand
And show me a way to understand

So if you think you know how to love me
And you think you know what I need
And if you really really want me to stay
You've got to lead the way
Yes if you think you know how to love me
And you think you can stand by me
And if you really really want me to stay
You've got to lead the way

Oh oh oh, hmm hmm hmm

A reckless nite in a nameless town
Then we moved out of sight with a silent sound
A beach that wept with deserted waves
That's where we slept knowing we'd be safe
Now you may think you can walk on the wild, wild side with me
But there's a lot I can learn and a lot that I've yet to see
You know you've got my life lying in your hands
It's up to you to make me understand

So if you think you know how to love me
And you think you know what I need
And if you really really want me to stay
You've got to lead the way

Yes if you think you know how to love me
And you think you can stand by me
And if you really really want me to stay
You've got to lead the way

Yes if you think you know how to love me
And you think you know what I need
And if you really really want me to stay
You've got to lead the way
