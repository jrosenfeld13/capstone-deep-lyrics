I am in a heavenly way
Travelin' on from day to day
And I'll sing the weary long
Oh the joy, I'm movin' home

Oh the joy, the joy, the joy
The wonderful joy, I'm movin' home
Oh the joy, praise joy
The peace and joy, I'm goin' on
Heaven I sing this song
An I'm movin' home
Oh the joy, great joy, of rollin' home

And I sing a wonderful song
Oh, I sing a wonderful song
Oh, the joy, the joy, the joy
The peace and joy, of movin' home
Oh, the joy, praise joy, I'm rollin' home

And at last when day is done
And they crown a heavenly one
I will sing a wonderful song
Oh the joy, I'm movin' home

Oh the joy, the joy, the joy
The peace and joy, of movin' home
Oh the joy, free joy, of rollin' home
Heaven I sang this song
Now I'm saying something
To the joy, sweet joy, of rollin' home

And at last, I sing this song
And at last, I sing this song
Oh the joys, I'm movin' home
Movin' joys, I'm movin' on
Oh the joy, great joy, of rollin' on

And at last when day is done

And they crown a heavenly one
And I sing a wonderful song
Oh the joy, I'm movin' on

Moving, joy, joy, joy
Wonderful joy, I'm movin' on
Oh the joy, sweet joy
Peace and joy, I'm movin' on

Heaven I sing this song
A wonderful song, I'm movin' home
Oh the joy, sweet joy
The peace and joy, I'm rollin' on

And at last when day is done
When they crown a heavenly one
I will sing a wonderful song
Oh the joy, I'm movin' on

Oh the joy, the joy, the joy
The wonderful joy, I'm movin' on
Oh the joy, sweet joy
The peace and joy, I'm movin' home

Heaven, I sing this song
Wonderful song I'm movin' home
Oh the joy, free joy, I'm rollin' on

And at last when day is done
And they crown a heavenly one
I will sing, a wonderful song
Oh the joy, I'm movin' home

Oh the joy, joy, joy
The wonderful joy I'm movin' home
Oh the joy, great joy
The peace and joy, I'm movin' on

Heaven I sing this song
The wonderful song, I'm movin' home
Movin' joy, free joy
I'm movin'
