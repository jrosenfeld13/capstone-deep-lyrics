Well stop, great God, stop there and listen
Listen to the story 'bout Jezebel
Her sins were so wicked Jehovah got angry
Her soul went leapin' and jumpin' into Hell
Way back yonder in the olden days
John told Jezebel to borrow her ways
Said her evil deeds had ruined the land
And repent for the kingdom of God was at hand
She got mad at John 'cause he told her 'bout the gospel
Told her servants to boil him in oil
Well they tell me God looked from the windows of the heavens
Spoke one word and the oil wouldn't boil
He raised his hand, creation trembled
Stamped his feet and time stood still
Raised his voice, looked down and thundered
"John! Go do my will."
You got to go to judgement, stand trial
Then they tell me John moved through the power of the gospel
Told Jezebel her time was nigh
On the book of life, her days were ended
Her time run out and she had to die
Well they tell me God walked his footsteps thunderin'
He moved his head and his eyes flashed fire
Clapped his hands and death come jumpin'
Jehovah was angry, somebody had to die
You got to go to judgement, stand trial
Then Death come knockin' on Jezebel's door and said
"Come on woman ain't you ready to go?
Of your evil deeds God's done got tired
You got to go to judgement, stand trial. "
Then Death come leapin' she jumped into Hell
Great God Almighty I heard them tell
Nine days she lay in Jerusalem's streets
Her flesh was too filthy for the dogs to eat
You got to go to judgement, stand trial
"Jezebel, mind God's talking
Says he's tired of your evil ways
You got to go to judgement, stand trial. "
