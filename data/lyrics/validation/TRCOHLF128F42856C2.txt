[Verse 1: Matthew Caws]
If I fell down a big hole
Would you tell? How do you know?
(It's a deeper well, like the big O) (x2)

[Chorus]
I know, I know
It's a bad scene to behold
It's a bad dream I hope
Marie, Marie
To feel, to feel
They're following me
Marie, Marie

Go

[Verse 2]
If I painted a tear, would you figure it out?
Would it make matters clear? Or would it shed some doubt?
(It's been happening for years, it's a roundabout) (x2)

[Chorus]
To feel

[Bridge]
Pull back from the front
There's a bigger gap than you thought
A bigger trap in which to be caught

[Verse 3]
I've got to get away from the bricks
All these straight lines are making me sick

[Chorus]
