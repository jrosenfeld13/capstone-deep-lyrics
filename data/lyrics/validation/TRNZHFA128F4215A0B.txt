That coat that I gave you
All shiny and black
I'm sorry my darling
But I'm taking it back
I don't want to spoil the party
But I've got to go home
You can stay if you want to If you want to sleep alone
Some were born to greatness
Some were born to die
Never knowing the difference
Never knowing why
Some were born to change the world
Some never even try
But darling, you and I:
We were born to cry
Black has become your favourite colour for all the things it can conceal
And as we're lying here together
I know exactly how you feel
It's time for me to leave this party
But I've just got to ask you first
If you're only trying to make things better
How come they always turn out worse?
Some were born to greatness
Some were born to die
Never knowing the difference
Never knowing why
Some were born to change the world
Some never even try
But darling, you and I:
We were born to cry
Oh some were born to greatness
And some were born to die
Never knowing the difference
Never knowing why
Some were born to change the world
Some never even try
But darling, you and I:
We were born to cry
Yes darling you and I:
We were born to cry
Born to cry
