(Intro + Sample: Joe Bataan)

You are my la-
You are my la-
You are my la-
You are my la

(Verse 1: Peacemakers)

People don't really know us first at hand matter hand
Know It took a little more time to comprehend
Matter fact I was checking you out

We were building a buzz from the ground
Even they had a thing for the sound
On the phone I ain't looking too deep
Nah now

We just looking for a good time
Oh father I need more time
Crystal lights pray for rain dance
On a summer night

This your last chance
Next year you'll be past tense
On a newer stage with my past friends

Going going places I don't know
(Hilltops)

(Interlude: Voice Recording)

Awesome why is there no music playing I was going to be like who died here tho like was good ?

Vicky you didn't tell me
Like she's been talking about you guys the Peacemakers ?
I'm just seeing it here

(Verse 2: Peacemakers)

We just got that hidden vibe you know
Check my watch it's 3:05 by 4 we got to go

The saddest thing when I'm temple top
It's my life so I'm tryna make it out another way
I'll never stop

Peace please, ease your mind with those with pretty leaves
Siding with the weirdos dreams from scratch turn them to gold

Mama you told me I'm gon get it on the right time
Days you paid my cab to school

Don't see eye to eye
Sometimes I think I grew too soon

(Chorus: Peacemakers + Dawn T)

Time passes so I smoke loud, makes the hourglass last
I ain't tryna come down, I let it marinate, and hit the damn sound, the lamer play around

With the gang or I'm alone girl, i'll still get the cone stuffed, but we just keep it mellow

Woah
We just keep it mellow
Woah
Woah
We just keep it mellow

With the gang or I'm alone girl I still get the cone stuffed

(Bridge: Peacemakers + Dawn T)

What happened to us
I'm sippin' that gin ain't no brown companion
(woo) what happened to us, still blowing the bud

Still showing them love (showing them love)
Still showing them love
Showing them love
Still showing them love (showing them love)
Still showing them love (showing them love)

What happened to us
I'm sippin' that gin ain't no brown companion
(woo) what happened to us, still blowing the bud

Still showing them love (showing them love)
Still showing them love (showing them love)
Showing them love
Still showing them love

(Chorus: Peacemakers + Dawn T)

Time passes so I smoke loud, makes the hour glass last
I ain't tryna come down, I let it marinate, and hit the damn sound, the lamer play around

With the gang or I'm alone girl, i'll still get the cone stuffed

(Outro: Peacemakers + Dawn T)

Rainbow seeker seeking, better days

Lessons learned
Paved the way (way)

I could only go certain places
Stop, drop, slope
You say all you wanted was to cope (COLD)

I do what I wanna
Just to get to the dollar
Time never moved
Slow

You stuck in the past
You stuck (Stuck)
You stuck in the past
Grow up

Up
Up
Up

You stuck in the past
Grow

Up
Up
Up
Up
Up
Up
