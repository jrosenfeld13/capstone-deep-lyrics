[Verse 1]
So here you are in your small little world
Kept up like a little precious virgin girl
To hear about your grace and your silly face
Wrapped up like a knot in a ball of shoelace
And every time I talk to you
It sounds like you're caught in a psychological flu

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't ever let them see you cheat
Don't ever let them see you bleed
Don't ever let them shake your hand
Don't ever let them believe that scam

[Chorus]
Skinny
And it will make you cry
Skinny
And it will make you lie
Skinny
And if it makes you soft inside
Skinny
At least you will not die

[Verse 2]
And if you take a good look at them
All caught up in their gracious-less win
Every sin is their seamless smile
Will go on for a countless while
And just because they think they won
It just means that the shit has just begun

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't ever let them see you cheat
Don't ever let them see you bleed
Don't ever let them shake your hand
Don't ever let them believe that scam

[Chorus]
Skinny
And it will make you cry
Skinny
And it will make you lie
Skinny
And if it makes you soft inside
Skinny
At least you will not die

[Outro]
Yeah
Skinny
Skinny
Yeah
