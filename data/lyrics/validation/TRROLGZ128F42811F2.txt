Ran around the corner
Fell asleep in the sun
You had to move into the shade
Before you fired the gun
You got a hunger for destruction
Needed someone to bleed
You sealed the deal before the dawn
You let your actions proceed

[Pre-Chorus]
Some sunny day they're gonna come for you
Some sunny day they're gonna come for you
Sooner or later, said, you know that it's true
Some sunny day they're gonna come for you

[Chorus]
You think you're so sly
You tried to roll by
You played the safe side
You said "Will somebody take me
Down town?"
Another James Brown
You made the same sound
You said "Will somebody write this down?"
Down

Fighting back, revenge
You've got you're face to the ground
You make excuses for the madness
You've been hanging around
You built a house up in the trees
So you could see everyone
You set the clock and had a run
You set the clock and had a run

[Pre-Chorus]
Some sunny day they're gonna come for you
Some sunny day they're gonna come for you
Sooner or later, said, you know that it's true
Some sunny day they're gonna come for you

[Chorus]
You think you're so sly
You tried to roll by
You played the safe side
You said "Will somebody take me
Down town?"
Another James Brown
You made the same sound
You said "Will somebody write this down?"
Down

[Guitar solo]

(Down deep you're a saint, you're a sinner
You're a snake, you're a snake, you're a snake
But down deep, down down deep
Oh no, you're coming after me)
[Screams]

[Discordant piano]

[Pre-Chorus]
Some sunny day they're gonna come for you
Some sunny day they're gonna come for you
Sooner or later, said, you know that it's true
Some sunny day they're gonna come for you

[Chorus]
You think you're so sly
You tried to roll by
You played the safe side
You said "Will somebody take me
Down town?"
Another James Brown
You made the same sound
You said "Will somebody write this down?"
Down
