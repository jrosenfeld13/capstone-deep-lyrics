Left the earth in 1983
Fingers groping for the galaxies
Reddened eyes stared up into the void
A thousand stars to be exploited
Somebody help me, I'm falling
Somebody help me, I'm falling down

Into sky, into earth
Into sky, into earth

It is so dark around, no life, no hope, no sound
No chance of seeing home again

The universe is on fire, exploding without flame

We are the lost ones; we are the pioneers; we are the lost ones
We are the ones they are going to build a statue for
Ten centuries ago or were going to fifteen forward

One last brief whisper in our loved ones' ears
To reassure them and to pierce the fear
Standing at controls then still unknown
We told the world we were about to go
Somebody help me I'm missing
Somebody help me I'm missing now

Touch with my mind, I have no frame
Touch with my mind, I have no frame

Well now where is the time? And who the hell am I?
Here floating in an aimless way

No one knows where we are, though they can't feel us precisely

There is no fear here
How could such a thing exist
In this place where living and knowing
And being have never been heard of?
Have never been heard of

Doomed to vanish in the flickering light
Disappearing to a darker night
Doomed to wander in a living death
Living anti-matter, anti-breath
Somebody help me, I'm losing
Somebody help me, I'm losing now

People around, no one to touch
People around, no one to touch

I am now quite alone
Part of a vacant time-zone
Here floating in the void

Only dimly aware of existence
A dimly existing awareness

I am the lost one, I am the one you fear, I am the lost one
I am the one who crossed through space
Or stayed where I was
Or didn't exist in the first place
