What gives you the right?
You're telling me time
And time again
You don't know what to
Fight for this time
You're burning inside
Just waiting for the flames to rise
You're burning, exploding

I feel let down
Can't get up
I'm on the outside looking in

You think you can hide
Still searching for
Some piece of mind
You can't survive on emotion this time
Just look in my eyes
And tell me that you're doing fine
I'm waiting and waiting

I don't want to tell you
How to live your life
You know it's really your
Decision what you want to do
But I can't stand aside
And watch you fall
Apart, you know that's
Something I could never
Bring myself to do
