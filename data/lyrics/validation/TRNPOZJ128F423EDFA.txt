Lying there asleep
I wonder if she knows that
I am going away
I packed up and I'm heading
Out the bedroom door
I'm feeling kinda guilty
But this can't be changed
Will she resent me for this

I've said I'm sorry
But please don't worry
There's nothing that I can do
I won't forget you
Feel bad I left you
I promise I'll be back soon

It's been two weeks now
Since I left you at
The window with sad eyes
It's bad 'cos I can't even
Talk t'you on the phone
But you know that very soon
Now I'll be home
It won't be long now
I'll see you at the break of dawn now

I'm coming home now
It won't be long now
I'll see you at the break of dawn now
