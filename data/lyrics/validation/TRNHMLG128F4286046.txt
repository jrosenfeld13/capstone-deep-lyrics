[Chorus]
I know your girlfriend hates me
I see it in her eyes
The way she looks right on me
It happens every time
I know your girlfriend hates me
See you know it's true
The way she hangs upon you
And watches every move, come on
Girl you think you're something
But have I got news for you, ooh

[Verse 1]
I don't mind
If it's the cold and sadistic you like
But now I'm thinking
Who's wearing your trousers now?
She's no good
Oh, stop pretending she's misunderstood
I heard her saying it's either me or her
Smell the coffee, boy, and open your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Life's too long for you to get it wrong

[Chorus]
I know your girlfriend hates me
I see it in her eyes
The way she looks right on me
It happens every time
I know your girlfriend hates me
See you know it's true
The way she hangs upon you
And watches every move, come on
Girl you think you're something
But have I got news for you, ooh

[Verse 2]
Oh, poor you
With all your lockets that have broken in two
Does she get a little excited?
Don't hide it
I heard her screaming in the dead of the night

[Pre-Chorus]
Life's too long for you to get it wrong

[Chorus]
I know your girlfriend hates me
I see it in her eyes
The way she looks right on me
It happens every time
I know your girlfriend hates me
See you know it's true
The way she hangs upon you
And watches every move, come on
Girl you think you're something
But have I got news for you, ooh

[Bridge]
(Ring-a-ding ding ding ding ding
Ring-a-ding ding ding
Ring-a-ding ding-a ding ding ding
Ring-a-ding ding ding)
Girlfriend wants to see who's calling
Freaking out, your phone keeps going
(Ring-a-ding ding ding ding ding
Ring-a-ding ding ding)
Life's too long

[Chorus]
I know your girlfriend hates me
I see it in her eyes
The way she looks right on me
It happens every time
I know your girlfriend hates me
See you know it's true
The way she hangs upon you
And watches every move, come on
Girl you think you're something
But have I got news for you, ooh
