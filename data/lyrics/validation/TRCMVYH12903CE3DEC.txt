[Verse]
It's been a while since I've seen your face (Face, face, face)
Gotta say that I'm happy to see you come around my place
Now I think we talked about it
And I think I know what's coming up next
Let's put our minds away and let our hormones do the rest
Does it seem obscene? Does it seem like a bad thing?
Well, if it is, I'm sorry, miss, but you know I'm just nineteen
So don't be afraid when my pants start to leak
You know damn well I'm in my sexual peak
Well

[Chorus]
Why don't you have some dirty hot sex with me?
It ain't like I'm asking you to give it up for free
Oh, we can start it right now, baby, get on your knees
Don't make me beg again, girl, I just said please, please

[Verse]
Yeah, now when you look down
Don't be mislead
I've found my life purpose and it's getting upstairs, into your bed, now (Oh shit!)
So there's a phone, girl
Go right on ahead
I'm sure you'd rather be with your stupid boyfriend instead

Oh, Dad! Ay!
Atta girl! And stay!
Hey, the fuck is that? (moaning)
Oh, what - what the fuck is that?
Hey! Honey girl!
Oh, sorry, uh! Thought he was you!
Aw, Dad!
Aw, fuck...

Why you gotta sleep with my dad?
Hey boy, how's your chick?
Yeah!

[Chorus]
Why don't you have some dirty hot sex with me (Yes)
It ain't like I'm asking you to give it up for free
Oh, we can start it right now, baby, get on your knees
Don't make me beg again, well, girl, I just said please

[Outro]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Well, baby, get on your knees
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I'm beggin' you darlin', please
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Well, baby, get on your knees
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I'm beggin' you darlin', please, please
Please me
