She moves like water over England
And carves her footprints in the earth
She feels like wind to a sailor
And like a candle on a hearth

Asik olmak
[To be your lover]
Of dunyada senin asikin olmak
[In this life (world) be your lover]

She sounds like poetry to a blind man
Step, step, stepping from the pages of a book
Comes on as smooth as the truth in high fidelity
Sharper than a look
