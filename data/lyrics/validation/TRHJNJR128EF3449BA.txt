[Verse 1]
What if the best position to be in
Was shoved in the smallest crack in a wall
Where claustrophobia kicks in?
You would no longer breathe
I can hear oxygen sing
You would no longer breathe
I can hear oxygen sing

Is it wrong to use despair for our own, own personal gain
To fuel the fires in the guts?
(To fuel the fires in the
To fuel the fires in the guts)

So happiness wasn't for you
It didn't come with the blood
Didn't come with the blood

[Chorus]
Keep the slavery of despair
Get where you need to go

[Verse 2]
What if the best position to be in
Was shoved in the smallest crack in a wall
Where claustrophobia kicks in?

Use them to get where you need to go
Where you need to go
Heard you say if there's a flame you'll burn every tree
You'll burn every tree that you see
Even the one you carved the lame and the females name into
The name into

[Chorus]
Keep the slavery of despair
Get where you need to go

[Interlude]

Frown all you give
You give them the best
Crooked smile is all you give
You give them the best
You give them the best
You give them the best
