Frosty the Snowman
He's a jolly happy soul
Got a corncob pipe, cute button nose
Got two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the Snowman
Is a fairytale they say
He was made of snow
But all the girls know
How he came to life one day

Must have been some magic
In that old silk hat we found
When we placed it on his head
Sure he began to dance around

And Frosty the Snowman
Was alive as he could be
And all the girls say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the Snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
He said girl, let's run
Come on, let's have some fun
Now before I melt away

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
He only paused one moment
When all the girls just cheer "Ooh"

Frosty the Snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved bye bye
Ladies don't you cry
I'll be back again some day

Ooh, mercy

What should I say, miss

Beaucoup

Frosty, oh, so cold
OH, he led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
He only paused one moment
When all the girls just cheer "Ooh"
Frosty, stop

Frosty my Snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved bye bye
Said Anita don't you cry
I'll be back, oh baby baby I'll be back some day
Gonna get you
