Some say they are free like a bird in the tree
Some say they are freer than ever can be
But the one cannot be free until he's free from mental slavery
Free from moral destruction and this cultural exploitation

Most people don't really understand why the
Almighty created man
Man wasn't born to see destruction, but through this
Physical immoral pollution
Everyday it's a physical immoral pollution

Everyday it's all I see and I can't stand it no longer
Physically, morally, oh

He who knows and pretend that he don't know
Jah is the one who was rejected and despised
The peace may break away, but the truth must stand
It's only Jah can stop this evolution
Can't stand this physical immoral pollution
Everyday it's a physical immoral pollution

Don't get me wrong, don't get me wrong
Don't get me wrong, don't get me wrong
When I say, it's a physical immoral pollution
Everyday it's a physical immoral pollution....
