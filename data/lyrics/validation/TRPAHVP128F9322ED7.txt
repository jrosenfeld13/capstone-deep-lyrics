Lay awake
In a bed
All alone
Empty home

Just can't smile
In my state
Reconcile
With my self again, again

Lay awake
In a van
All alone
Far from home

Lay awake
In a bed
All alone
Empty home

Just can't smile
In my state
Reconcile
With myself again

Just can't smile
In my state
Reconcile
With myself again, again, again, yeahhh
