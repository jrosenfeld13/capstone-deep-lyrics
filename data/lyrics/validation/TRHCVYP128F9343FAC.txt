Let me swim in your ocean honey
Wanna soak in your sea
Let me swim in your ocean darlin'
See how good it can feel

I'll let you sit in the break
When you drive in my car
Wanna know what's in your heart
What kind of woman you are

Oh yeah i'll give you more
Oh yeah if you bargain for
Oh yeah don't think i can
Oh honey just give me your hand

There's a river inside me darlin'
Let if flow in your sea
When it gets together woman
See how good it can feel now

Gonna shake the blues away
Be free as the wind
Gonna help you to do that girl yeah
Feeling you care

Gonna thumble just before dawn
Later on when the sun is gone
I'll hold you close
Hold you next to me
Oh baby i got that feelin' now

So let me swim in your sea
Let the sunlight shine
Twistin' feelin' in my brain
Can you share what's mine

Oh let's swing the boat of mine
Ships all around
Sinking in your ocean
Down, down, down

Yeah there's a river inside me darlin'
Let it flow in your sea
When it gets togheter woman
See how good it can feel now

Now let me swim in your ocean honey
Wanna soak in your sea
Let me swim in your ocean honey
See how good it can feel

Let me swim in your ocean honey
See how good it can feel
Let me swim in your ocean honey
Wanna soak in your sea
Let me swim in your ocean honey
See how good it can feel

Gonna swim, gonna swim, gonna swim
Gonna swim, gonna swim
Swim, swim, swim, swim...
