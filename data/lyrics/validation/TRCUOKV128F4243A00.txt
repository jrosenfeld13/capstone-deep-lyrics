Who's fallen face down just inches from an ashtray- just inches from a bright blue flame
If you could lift your head you'd be laughing
A vision lighting up the room
But every last ditch attempt is your worst offence
The shortest distance between you and the bright blue flame

Who's yelling at a stranger in an elevator for looking at you like that
All your smeary-eyed magnificence glaring back
But every last ditch attempt is your worst offence
The shortest distance between you and the bright blue flame
