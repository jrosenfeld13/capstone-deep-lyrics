Well alright, yeah alright!
Saw you lookin' for somethin' simple
On beyond
We are
Yeah, alright!
You wouldn't know it
If it hit you right between, the eyes
Yeah, alright!
Gonna lift you up, gonna bring you down
Gonna let you walk through this life alone
Gona let you follow your own dreams
It'll turn your head around
For the first time in your life you might find
For the second time in a year
I don't mind
For the last time I think its time to fly
Freedom's right between the eyes...
Well alright, yeah alright!
It takes years and tears and pain
To find out where we ain't
Yeah, alright!
It never meant that much to me
Well alright, yeah alright!
I'll give you my heart, I'll give you my soul
I'll wave good-bye when you're goin'
Alright
Let You follow your own dreams
It'll turn your head around
For the first time in your life you might find
For the second time in a year
I don't mind
For the last time I think its time to fly
Freedom's right between the eyes...
It'll turn your head around
For the first time in your life you might find
For the second time in a year
I don't mind
For the last time I think its time to fly
Freedom's right between the eyes...
