Some of these days
You're gonna miss me, baby
Some of these days
You're gonna feel you're so lonely
You'll miss my huggin'
You're gonna miss my kissin'
You'll miss me, baby
When I am far away
You'll feel so lonely
And want me only
'Cause you'll know, baby
You always had your way
And if you leave me
You know, it's gonna grill me
You're gonna miss, your thin little daddy
Some of these days
I said some of these days
You're gonna miss me, baby
I'm talking about days
You're gonna feel so lonely
You're gonna miss my huggin'
You're gonna miss my kissin'
You'll miss me, baby
When I'm long gone away
You're gonna feel so lonely
And beg for me only
'Cause you know, baby
I always gave you, your way
And if you leave me
You know, it's gonna grill me
You'll miss, your thin little daddy
Some of these days
