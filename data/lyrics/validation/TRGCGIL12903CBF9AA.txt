[Verse 1]
What strange road led me to this chair
What thunder roll made the crystal clear

[Chorus]
There were times when I was not myself
There were times when I was someone else

[Verse 2]
There were times when there was no way Id sit still
There were times when blue electric bolts flew from our fingertips

[Chorus]
There were times when I was not myself
There were times when I was someone else

[Verse 3]
The September storm came down at half past twelve
The window we looked out would flash and we could see ourselves

[Outro]
See the smoke, see that theres fire
See the smoke, see that theres fire
