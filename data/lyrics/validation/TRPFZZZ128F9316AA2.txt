Come as you are, sweetheart
Come as you are
You know you've got nothing to prove
I'll put you to bed you can let it all go
You've been playing too rough lately

[Chorus]
You burn too bright
You live too fast
This can't go on too long
You're a tragedy starting to happen

Just as you are, perfect
Just as you are
I'll give you the time you deserve
Don't make those promises
Don't tell me again
That dust is gonna settle your nerves

[Chorus] x3
