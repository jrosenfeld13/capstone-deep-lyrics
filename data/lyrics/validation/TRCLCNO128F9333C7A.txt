Who's a hippy now?
I cut it off to make you proud
Abuse my limbs until the sun goes down
I don't want to be alone again

Got Jesus' autograph
No handshake or pat on the ass
His saving grace was talking fast
I don't want to be bored again
Am I ready to take that chance
Put my faith in someone else?

Let's use this dynamite
We're only making noises

I'll make the brightness yours
So we can deny who we are
I'll love you but not today
The darkness fell like a shout
Am I ready to take that chance
Put my faith in someone else?

Let's use this dynamite
We're only making noises

Together we stand, we're at the bottom of the cove;
It looked like rain, but it felt like snow
Because wherever we stand, we're at the bottom of the hole
We'll dig our way out but we'll still say no

The wound is king and how
His whorses turned they make him proud
His visions clipped like wings and crowns
Lets use this photograph
He's never even had the chance to believe in something else

Let's use this dynamite
We're only making noises

We want to effect a change with voice and electrical noises
Together we stand, we're at the bottom of the cove;
It looked like rain, but it felt like snow
Because wherever we stand, we're at the bottom of the hole
Well, we'll dig our way out but we'll still say no

Darkness fell like a shout;
The darkness fell like a shout;
Darkness fell like the shout;

We want to effect a change, with voice and electrical noises

Wherever we crash, we're gonna blame it on the old
Unique to the touch, and crippled to the bone
However we stand they'll be swinging from the ropes
Unfinished and young or unhappy and old
