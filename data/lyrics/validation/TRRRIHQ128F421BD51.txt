Born To Be

I looked inside me
To find myself
To purify me
To cease the thing

Across the river
A life goes by
Look inside the mirror
And you will find out

Solitude I was born
Terrify me
Fail of mystic broke in front of my eyes

I walked in shadows
I drown in rain
I met the desert
'Cause I'm born again

Across the river
A life goes by
Look inside the mirror
And you will find out

Solitude I was born
Crucify me
Wearing the crowd of thoughts I am

Freedom!
Born to be a man
Emptiness!
Made me understand

Oh! Let me hear the deep within

Oh again freedom!
Born to be the man
Deadliness!
Crush the way deserve

Trough one of the deep within
Shy the stream without a lie

Raft in frozen lands of life
Seems the song of what we are
