Reach for me
Don't wanna wait another day without you
Take me to higher ground
We'll be safe and sound
Reach for me

Should've known right away
When it felt too good to be true
Cause you've never said
What you mean to say
Anyway you look at it, im confused

If you can't see where this is gonna lead

Reach for me
Don't wanna wait another day without you
Take me to higher ground
We'll be safe and sound
Come on, reach for me
I can't wait another day without you
Take me to higher ground
We'll be safe and sound
Reach for me
Just reach for me

I've got it all figured out
You decide what's best for you
Cause you will build me
So don't let me down
I can't make you do
What you don't want to

If you can't see where this is gonna lead

Reach for me
Don't wanna wait another day without you
Take me to higher ground
We'll be safe and sound
Come on, reach for me
I can't wait another day without you
Take me to higher ground
We'll be safe and sound
Reach for me

Come on, reach for me
Don't wanna wait another day without you
Take me to higher ground
We'll be safe and sound
Come on, reach for me
I can't wait another day without you
Take me to higher ground
We'll be safe and sound
Reach for me
