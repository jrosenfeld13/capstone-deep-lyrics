I guess you're all waitin' for the news
And how they liked my music
So now I'm coming on home to you
So I climb up on the bus
I settle down and start thinkin' 'bout us
And how you've been behind me all the time

And if I hadn't tried, I might've died never knowing
And now I'm going back where I belong
It's a long, long way back home again
I ain't seen your smilin' face since I don't know when
It's a long, long way back home again
I do believe I'm going home

I felt so tall when I got the call and they told me
They're gonna use my songs like you told me all along
Moving down a windin' road
That goes by fields and telephone poles
And now I'm just dreamin'
About someday bein' a star and all

And if I hadn't tried, I might've died never knowing
And now I'm going back where I belong
It's a long, long way back home again
I ain't seen your smilin' face since I don't know when
It's a long, long way back home again
I do believe I'm going home
Think I'm goin' home
