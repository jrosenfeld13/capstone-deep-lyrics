[GRETCHEN]
Wait
Who is my boss now Regina is gone?

[KAREN]
I'll wear what I want
Which is what I have on
And a vest
That's how it feels
To be free, free

[GRETCHEN]
I thought you would cave
But you stood up to her
You were strong, you were brave
No, you know what you were
You were fetch

[GRETCHEN, KAREN]
So fetch! And we're free, free
You were so fearless
Woah-oh
You didn't cry or hide or throw up

So fearless
Woah-oh
No emotional trauma
Just fearless!

[STUDENTS]
Woah-oh

[CADY]
Well some people need to grow up

A girl's got to do
What a girl's got to do
I did it for me, sure
But really for you!
So that you can live fearlessly too
Imagine fearless!

[CADY, STUDENTS]

And fearless!

[CADY, STUDENTS]

[CADY]
Brush that dirt off your shoulder

[GIRLS]
Imagine just dancing like no one was there
Everyone staring but you do not care

[TAYLOR WEDELL]
Not hunching your shoulders
To make yourself small!

[GIRLS]
To walk right down
The middle of the hall
Not small
Not small
Walk tall!

[STUDENTS]
Fearless!
Fearless!
Fearless!

[CADY, spoken]
Regina, I'm sorry this had to happen

[REGINA]
It's fine for you
New hair, new skirt
It's fine
'Till someone gets hurt

[STUDENTS]
Ahhh

[REGINA]
'Till someone gets hurt!
