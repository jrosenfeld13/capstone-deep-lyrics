Satanic spells shall be cast upon all humans
Living in the faith of a dying god
Praying for their lives they shall be ripped to pieces
Burning their temples of christ, havens for their weak minds

Our legion is growing by thousand souls and thousand more
Each soul taken joins our infernal legion
Behold the mighty legion of fallen warriors
Blood is running along the ground

Those feeble creeps shall be possessed by our demonic might
Fire, screams and fierce destruction shall echo throughout the night
Open the gates to the heavenly kingdom
Submit to our black ways and drink the blood of angels

Our legion is growing by thousand souls and thousand more
Each soul taken joins our infernal legion
Behold the mighty legion of fallen warriors
Blood is running along the ground

Blood and lifeless bodies spread over the plain
Open the gates to the heavenly kingdom
God almighty is crying as his herd is slain
Let the tears rain, show the world your fear

With the moon comes the mist that surge over the plain
As souls of fallen warriors are swarming above
Smell the stench of death hear the sound of cries
Victorious chant of demons haunt this night of despair

Our legion is growing by thousand souls and thousand more
Each soul taken joins our infernal legion
Behold the mighty legion of fallen warriors
Blood is running along the ground
