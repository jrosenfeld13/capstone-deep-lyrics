Remember when you said we'd marry
The wilder shores of love
The tide, it changes fast
Ah when you're fast it never lasts

I cannot read between your lines
You cannot make me read your tiny mind
Oh who's got the time
Oh you'd go blind

Jesus and Mary
Are takin' me down to the other side of town
Where they don't count the days
With steel blades on the walls of time
They just dance naked in the sun all the time

She's the jewel in your crown
But I'm the goal that's gonna weigh you down
I'll keep you around this dirty old town

Every time I put the stove on
Dinner's cold by the time you come over
Oh you turn over on that cold shoulder

Jesus and Mary
Are takin' me down to the other side of town
Where they don't count the days
With steel blades on the walls of time
They just dance naked in the sun all the time

And you call and you call my name
Baby, hazy, lazy
Oh I am not an animal

When I lie back, I lie on my back
Baby, hazy, lazy
Oh I'll sign on the dotted line

Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down, no
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down
Don't bring me down
