Step out onto your balcony
At night and watch your city glow
Listen to the sounds of dogs going off
Try to sleep by the light of the moon
Sleep by the light of the moon

The battle thats fought between women and men
Who pretend that they try to be true
Is a battle thats lost, and pain is the cost
Sleep by the light of the moon
Sleep by the light of the moon

Woh-oh-oh
Woh-oh-oh, sleep by the light of the moon

Pretty young girls touch the back of my neck
And say: Baby, can I come home with you?
I tell em: Little sister, Im already in love
And I can sleep by the light of the moon

Most of my friends are like Indians
Shooting arrows straight up into the blue
That may not make em right
But it makes em feel like
They can sleep by the light of the moon
Sleep by the light of the moon

Woh-oh-oh
Woh-oh-oh, sleep by the light of the moon
Sleep by the light of the moon
