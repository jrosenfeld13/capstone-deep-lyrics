Merry Christmas, baby, you sure did treat me nice
Merry Christmas, baby, you sure did treat me nice
Gave me a diamond ring for Christmas
Now I'm living in paradise

Well, I'm feelin' mighty fine, got good music on my radio
Well, I'm feelin' mighty fine, got good music on my radio
Well, I wanna kiss you, baby
While you're standing beneath the mistletoe

Saint Nick came down the chimney about half past three
Left all these pretty presents that you see before me
Merry Christmas, pretty baby, you sure been good to me
Well, I haven't had a drink this morning
But I'm all lit up like a Christmas tree, ooh
