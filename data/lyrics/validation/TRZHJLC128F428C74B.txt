Don't look so sad
It's not so bad you know
It's just another night
That's all it is
It's not the first
It's not the worst you know
We've come through all the rest
We'll get through this

We've made mistakes
But we've made good friends too
Remember all the nights we spent with them
And all our plans
Who says they can't come true
Tonight's another chance to start again

It's just another New Year's Eve
Another night like all the rest
Just another New Year's Eve
Let's make it the best
It's just another New Year's Eve
Just another Auld Lang Syne
But when we're through this New Year
You'll see, will be
Just fine

We're not alone, we've got the world you know
And it won't let us down, just wait and see
And we'll grow old, but think how wise we'll grow
There's more you know, it's only New Year's Eve

It's just another New Year's Eve
Another night like all the rest
Just another New Year's Eve
Let's make it the best
It's just another New Year's Eve
Just another Auld Lang Syne
But when we're through this New Year
You'll see, will be
Just fine
