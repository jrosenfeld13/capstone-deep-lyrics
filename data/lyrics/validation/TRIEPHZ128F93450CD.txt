[Intro]
Oh, disco heaven
Oh, disco heaven

[Verse 1]
Get back, bunny
It's getting cold in here, little honey
We've got a show to put on your dress
Take a minute for us and relax, relax
Cupid's got me, oh, with his bow and arrow, baby
He'll hit you in the pants, hot pants
Get the people to dance and relax, relax

[Chorus]
Oh, the lights dim while we're dancin'
Yeah, the floor is shakin' in this disco heaven (oh, disco heaven)
D-disco heaven (oh, disco heaven)
Oh, the lights dim while we're dancin'
Yeah, the floor is shakin' in this disco heaven (oh, disco heaven)
D-disco heaven (oh, disco heaven)

[Verse 2]
Throw your head back, girly
Throw it like those girls in the movies
We've got a show to put on your dress
Take a minute for us and relax, relax
The ball is turning
A 300 mirror's burning through the hearts of the crowd
In the back hips just banging the track to the muzak, muzak

[Chorus]
Oh, the lights dim while we're dancin'
Yeah, the floor is shakin' in this disco heaven (oh, disco heaven)
D-disco heaven (oh, disco heaven)
Oh, the lights dim while we're dancin'
Yeah, the floor is shakin' in this disco heaven (oh, disco heaven)
D-disco heaven (oh, disco heaven)

[Bridge]
Oh, we got that disco, D-I-S-C-O
And we're in heaven, H-E-A-V-E-N
Disco heaven
Feels just like heaven
Disco heaven
Disco heaven
A line up for the dance
Yeah, bring those fancy pants
You know there's disco in the air, and hairspray everywhere
A disco heaven
A disco heaven
Disco heaven
Disco heaven

[Chorus]
Oh, the lights dim while we're dancin'
Yeah, the floor is shakin' in this disco heaven (oh, disco heaven)
D-disco heaven (oh, disco heaven)
Oh, the lights dim while we're dancin'
Yeah, the floor is shakin' in this disco heaven (oh, disco heaven)
D-disco heaven (oh, disco heaven)
