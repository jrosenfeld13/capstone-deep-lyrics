[Intro]
We are back again
So tell a friend
It's Chrome-, it's Chrome-, it's Chrome-
O-o-o-o-o
Until the end
Until the end

[Verse]
You and I
Baby we go side by side
Me and you
Tell me what we're gonna do
You and I
Baby we go side by side
Me and you
Tell me what we're gonna do

[Chorus x2]
No matter what I came here to do
No matter what you came here to say
We really ain't got nowhere to go
Cause you're my Tenderoni
Cause you're my Tenderoni

[Verse 1]

[Chorus]
For sure if I tell you how to do my dance
Baby, then you'll let me get in those pants
For sure if I tell you how to do my dance
Baby, then you'll let me get in those pants
Cause you're my Tenderoni
Cause you're my Tenderoni

[Bridge]
Can't fight the feeling or get shut down
She let me slide enough
Can't fight the feeling or get shut down
She'll always be my, Tenderoni

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]
