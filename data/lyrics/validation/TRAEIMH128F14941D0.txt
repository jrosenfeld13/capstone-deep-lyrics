People, People
When you hand me down
People, People
When you're laying me down
Forget you loved me
'Cause I been a bad bee now

It's the way you squeeze me baby
Honey, I'm not around

Dial up my heartbeat
Nothing but a dead line
Dial up my heartbeat, babe
Nothing but a dead line
But I'm up on my pony
Riding right out of time

It's the way you squeeze me baby
Honey, I'm not around

Stingray my lovechild
Blue honey falling down
Stringray my lovechild
Blue honey falling down
Put me in a bag, baby
'Cause I been a bad bee now

It's the way you squeeze me baby
Honey, I'm not around
It's the way you tease me baby
Honey, I'm not around
Yes, it's the way you squeeze me baby
Honey, I'm not around
