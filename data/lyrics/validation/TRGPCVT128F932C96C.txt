Well they flash
Those half-knowing smiles
As they pass
Heroic profiles
Like theyre in some book by Ayn Rand
Always working, always tanned
So satisfied but the kids dont understand

You kiss her
Dont even love you
Its a blur
Shes getting on top of you
Sometimes you see stuff nobody planned
Stick your head back in the sand
Oh, dont worry cause the kids dont understand

Stuck your hands in the wet cement
In the soft spot of my skull

Well it stings
Lick your wounds if I could
No such thing
As a normal childhood
Give em paper, scissors and crayons
Give all those concerned a big hand
Maybe they deserve it, but the kids dont understand

Stuck your hands in the wet cement
In the soft spot of my skull

Were not dumb
Even if you spell it
We catch on
Dont have to yell it
I see her flinch, when you raise your hand
Theres not too much that the kids dont understand
