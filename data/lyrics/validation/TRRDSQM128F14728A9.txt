If only i could run away
Into the words i'll never say
It would be easier than this
My soul facing you

And only now we share the weight
The sudden twisting turns of fate
And all the plans for my escape
I'm breaking

I fell awake (fell awake)
Into the life i dreamt away
Suddenly, i need more time

And if the broken-ness i feel
Takes all my wounded life to heal
To share one moment's breath with you
Would be worth every tear

Into the life i live today

I fell awake (fell awake)
Into the love that slipped away
Sadly, i need more time
