It could have been just like any other day
If not for the drug raids
They seemed so normal as they were cuffed and hauled away
Who could have thought?
We should have known
Such a nice family, but it's all a show
It could have been just like any other day
If not for the blood in the rain

It could have been just your everyday commute
And then I heard the sirens and I flipped on the news
"Disobedient civilians have all lanes damned
Arrests are being made, wrists are being slapped"
So I cranked down the window as I rolled past:
"Get a boss, take a bath."
That's what the others shouted but I blared the horn
With my fist in the air and my gas to the floor

[Chorus]
Give me death or give me rain
I feel so numb better give me pain
Bomb threats and hurricanes
Or a new berry flavor from the coffee tray...

It could have been just your forgotten school day
If not for the drills and the bells that saved
The fire started some place cool and safe
Who could have thought?
We should have known!
"Thousands dead!" the leaders spoke
I pulled at their cuffs
While they were at each other's throats:
"Does this mean I get to go home?"

[Chorus]
Give me death or give me rain
I feel so numb better give me pain
Bomb threats and hurricanes
Or a new berry flavor from the coffee tray

Liberty is too much strain
It could have been like any other day
If not for the blood in the rain

[Chorus]
Give me death or give me rain
I feel so numb better give me pain
Bomb threats and hurricanes
Or a new berry flavor from the coffee tray

Give me death or give me rain
I feel so numb better give me pain
Bomb threats and hurricanes
Or a new berry flavor from the coffee tray

Sing out!
Liberty is too much stain

It could have been just like every other day
If not for the blood and the rain
