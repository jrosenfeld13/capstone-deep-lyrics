Watch out...here i go again
I've been gone too long, remember who i am?
Hold back...i've got somethin' to say
"i never wanted to leave now i'm back to stay!"
Never sold me, what i stood for...
Noone told me what i'm good for...
So watch out...here i go again...

...ready to stay!

I believe its still in me and i can turn you...
Up...side and down!
If you decide to trust in me then i can really...
Turn...you...around!

Stand up...and have faith in me
Let me be the voice for people just like me
And you, it's true...
You will be counted too...!
Won't sell me, what i stand for
Don't tell me...no more!
So watch out...here i go again....

...willing to stay!

I believe its still in me and i can turn you..
Up...side and down!
If you decide to trust in me then i can really...
Turn...you...around!
I believe its meant to be that i can turn you...
Up...side and down
If you decide to follow me then i can really...
Turn..you..around!

Upside-down, inside out
I can turn........you around!
Upside-down, inside out
Do you believe that i can turn you 'round?

I believe its still in me and i can turn you...
Up...side and down!
If you decide to trust in me then i can really...
Turn...you...around!
I believe its meant to be that i can turn you...
Up...side and down
If you decide to follow me then i can really...
Turn...you...around!
