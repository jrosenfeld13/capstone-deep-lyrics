[Verse 1]
She's the type of girl that makes you feel better
It don't matter how you used to feel
She's the kinda girl that follows with the weather
And the sun brings out her sex appeal

[Pre-Chorus]
If you want to talk to her, it don't matter
You'll be breathless when she calls your name
Oh, I'll bet that you can hear the rain

[Chorus]
These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be alright
These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be alright
These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be alright
These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be alright

[Verse 2]
How do you think I can make you feel better?
How do I know what you say is real?
Liked an imaginary love letter
Talking mostly 'bout her sex appeal

[Pre-Chorus]
If you want to talk to her, it don't matter
You'll be breathless when she calls your name
Oh, I'll bet that you can hear the rain

[Chorus]
These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be alright
These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be alright
These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be alright
These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be alright
These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be alright
These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be alright
These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be alright
These are the good times in your life
So put on a smile and it'll be alright
