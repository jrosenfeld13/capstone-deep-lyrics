Another time - another place
Another answer just in case
It's just a memory that I will soon forget
Another glamorous debut
Another chance to see right through
Your empty promises that mean so much to me

[Chorus:]
And all at once I get the feeling
That I'll never get the chance to talk to you
And all at once I get the feeling
That I'll never hear you say it isn't true
I've got to hear you say it isn't true

I had a dream - I saw you in a magazine
I turned the page and you were gone
I can't explain - I can't express the way I feel
It's so complex - it's so unreal

(chorus)
And all these places i have been
They're all the same - it's just the miles and miles
That set them all apart
And all these faces i have seen
It seems to me that they've been
Trying to tell me something from the start

And all at once I get the feeling that I
Never get the chance to talk to you
And all at once i get the feeling
That I got to hear you say it isn't true

I know it isn't true
