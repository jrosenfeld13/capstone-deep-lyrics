When I wake, when I sleep
I hear whispers that seek to reach me
My constant One
When I dance, when I weep
When I run, You are with me

(chorus)
Everyday, every night
After death in this life
You are constantly keeping
In my joy, in my strife
When I taste my desires
I am caught in your eyes holding me
My constant One

When I taste of the words
That You speak, they will feed my hunger
My constant one
When I stray, when I turn
I will say that I love you

(chorus)

(bridge)
I want to kiss the mouth that soothes me
When the smile has vanished from my face
When I sparkle in the mist that clouds me
Be sure that I am lost in You
Lost without a trace
My constant One

(chorus)
