Talking aloud in a motel room
But no one is listening
The bed is unmade and the curtains are drawn
And the wind is whistling
Under cover the lover is waiting
But I can't turn away
I've been loving the sinner
And hating the sin
Loving the sinner yeah

I know there's somewhere a man waits for her
In misery
And I can try all I want to
Find the will
But there ain't no sympathy, no
Under cover the lover is crying
But I can't question why
I've been loving the sinner
And hating the sin
Loving the sinner and hating the sin
Hold me back until the trouble begins
Loving the sinner and hating the sin

I know somewhere a man waits for her
Wonder where she can be
And I tried so hard to find the will
But there ain't no sympathy, no
Under cover the lover is laughing
Just got me where she wants me now
I've been loving the sinner
And hating the sin
Loving the sinner and hating the sin
Hold me back until the trouble begins
I tried so hard and I don't want it to end
I tried so hard and I can't' let it go
I tried so hard and I can't' let it go
I can't let it go, I can't let it go
I tried so hard and I can't' let it go oh no
