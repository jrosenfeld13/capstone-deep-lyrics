And all this time we've waited just to see hope decimated by the setting sun
And all the while frustrated because a heart that's underrated is always losing blood

We're always losing blood

You'll never know what it means to give. receive. and not forget
Another hole as we bleed it out then breath it all back in

If you could only see we're dying faster. faster now

And all this time we've waited just to see hope decimated by the setting sun
All the while frustrated because a heart that's perforated is always losing blood

We're always losing blood

You'll never know what it means to give. receive. and not forget
Another hole as we bleed it out then breath it all back in

If you could only see we're dying
If you could only see we're dying faster. faster now

And all this time we've waited just to see hope decimated by the setting sun
And all the while frustrated because a heart that's worn and dated is always losing blood
And all the while frustrated because a heart that's worn and dated is always losing blood

And all this time we've waited just to see hope decimated by the setting sun
And all the while frustrated because a heart that's worn and dated is always losing blood
