As we plunged into
The inferno of life
This is the real hell
And paradise is only an utopia

A debt of honour
On the verge of madness
A debt of honour
In my heart of hearts

Hurt and weaken
From the swirl of barbarity
Poor child of sin
Devilish angels
A scornful look
Haunted by the past

A debt of honour
On the verge of madness
A debt of honour
In my heart of hearts

(1st Lead - Marios)
(2nd Lead - Gus)

A debt of honour
On the verge of madness
A debt of honour
In my heart of hearts

A debt of honour
On the verge of madness
A debt of honour
In my heart of hearts
