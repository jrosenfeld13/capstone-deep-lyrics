I didn't know what I should do
To help myself get over you
And mend this heart of mine
So I took my axe and walked around
Until I knew that I had found
The perfect piece of pine

Well I took my axe and walked around
Sized it up girl and I cut it down

Ooh girl, you will polish my wooden heart
Ooh girl, you will polish my wooden heart

Well I cut and sanded with the grain
I added kosher stain
And my new heart's looking good
But one more problem still remains
I just can't seem to make this thing work
The way it should
Well I cut and sanded with the grain
This heart of mine just ain't the same

Ooh girl, you will polish my wooden heart
Ooh girl, you will polish my wooden heart

When you are mine, this heart will shine
I set my watch to its perfect time
When you are mine, this heart will shine
I set my watch to its perfect time
When you are mine, this heart will shine
I set my watch to its perfect time
Time, time, hoah!

C'mon girl, you will polish my wooden heart
Ooh girl, you will polish my wooden heart

C'mon girl, c'mon, oh
C'mon girl, c'mon, c'mon girl
