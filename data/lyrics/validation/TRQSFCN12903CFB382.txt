It's a complicated mixed up angry world
Everybody's tryin' to get what they can
I need a simple, pretty, sweetheart of a girl
So I can help her understand
So I can help her understand

Baby, mess me up and, honey, bring me down
Wanna fall on through to the underground
Just do what you got and I'll
I'm gonna do what I can
'Cause every nice young girl needs an angry young man

(Needs an angry young)
Needs an angry young man

It's a shit box, sky box, sex box kinda world
Lucky if you float wade and stream
I need a rainbow, unicorn pink muffin girl
(Ah, ah, ah)
So I can help destroy her every dream
So I can help destroy her every dream

Baby, mess me up and, honey, bring me down
Wanna fall on through to the underground
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Just do what you got and I'll
I'm gonna do what I can
'Cause every nice young girl needs an angry young man

Needs an angry young man
(Needs an angry young)
Ah, ah, ah

Baby, mess me up and, honey, bring me down
Wanna fall on through to the underground
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Just do what you got and I'll
I'm gonna do what I can
'Cause every nice young girl needs an angry young man

Needs an angry young man
Needs an angry young man
Needs an angry young man
(Needs an angry young)
(Needs an angry young)
