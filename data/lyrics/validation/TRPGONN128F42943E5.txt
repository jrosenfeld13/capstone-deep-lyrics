Is it over now
Over something that you overheard
It is over dramatized
Over complicated, overhit

Oh, your clever talk
Leaves you tongue tigh
It's overkill
You wanna fix it with your hands tied
You never will

I don't wanna play this game no more
Back and forth and baaaaaaaaack
Is it over now
So tell me how does it feel?!
I guess it's over now
Are you get over me?
Are you get over me?

Take it easy now
Don't wanna change a thing
Don't want my dirty little feet all over everything
I took my shoes off
That I wouldn't chain
Over the clean sheets wrapped around that dirty paint
Ow, believe me, if I wanted to, baby, I would be there with you
I keep my hands clean
Keep my dignity
I leave it up to you

I don't wanna play this game no more
It's back and forth and baaaaaaaack
Is it over now
So tell me how does it feel
I guess, it's over now
Are you get over me?
(And back and forth and back)

Is it over now
So tell me how does it feel
I guess, it's over now
Are you get over me?
Are you get over me?
(And back and forth and back)
