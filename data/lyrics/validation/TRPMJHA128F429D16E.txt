Everything I am, I am because of you
And everything I do, girl I do it just for you
You stand by me when the times are rough
How can I ever thank you enough
Everything I am, darling I am because of you

Got my feet on the ground, you found some good in me
Everything I am, is what you mean to me
I could'nt have made it without you girl
Can I ever thank you girl, thank you girl
'Cause everything I am, I am because of you

Everything I am, I am because of you
Everything I am, I am because of you
