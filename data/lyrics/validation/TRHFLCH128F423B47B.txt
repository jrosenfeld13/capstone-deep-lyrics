Beautiful yet dangerous
Thermogenic, luminous
Like a moth drawn to a flame
I'm the same
All cremated equally

As a spark still I knew
I'll be lured, be consumed
She a pyre incarnate, incinerate
An inferno turned to flesh

You are the first
Will be my last
Will be my final words
(said she)
Pyretta Blaze

Say the words
I long to hear
Pinch, bite, kiss, suck, lick and sear
In a pyromantic way
I'm her slave
Living for her to ignite
