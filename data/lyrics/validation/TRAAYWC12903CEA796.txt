I was hanging with a girl I know
She was telling me a week ago
That I'm the only one
That she's really ever loved
I was talking with a friend of hers
Telling her I know that what a friend deserves
Is more than I can give
It's more than I can give

You know that I would give it all away
If I knew I could get it back
No need to question all the things I say
It's hard to take but it's a fact
I'm the lonely one x5

People say it's sad to think about
Someone giving more than they're gettin'
But my taking made me figure out
That I'm the lonely one
I'm the one who's always walking out
Your love has put me on the run
You know exactly what I'm talking about
You know that love is never done

I'm the lonely one x4

Passing time all the lonely nights when I think of you
You can make all the right moves
But sometimes still lose

You know that I would give it all away
If I knew I could get it back
No need to question all the things I say
It's hard to take but it's a fact

I'm the lonely one x9
