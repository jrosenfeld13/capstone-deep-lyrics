She says I think too much
She got me down on my knees
And my mind's on fire
And I need release
So I run and I run and I run
And I run all day
Hoping each step I take
Will take me further away

From the rhythm and the beat
The rhythm of daily like
The beat of the street life
Today

I'm in love with numbers
Cause numbers never lie
Neither do they hate or cheat
They make their own kind of love
I wanna paint with numbers
Like painters paint with words
Don't need to paint by numbers
Cause I can do it by ear

I paint panic and fear
The panic of daily life
The fear that I see
In the eyes of the people I meet

She says I think too much
She's got me down on my knees
And my mind's on fire
And I need a release
So I run and I run and I run and I run
And I run and I run and I run and I run
And I run
