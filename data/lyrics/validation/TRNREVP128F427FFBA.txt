It's been said so many times
Book and films and countless rhymes
Trying to describe what love
Is and will be and was
But all these other peoples tries
Are telling their tales not mine
And yours the way it needs to be
So if it's up to me

Chorus:
I will say how I feel with emotion
I will speak loud and true
I will say this with simple devotion
I am in love with you

So I'm telling you cause I just want for you to know
When something's right you don't let go
What we have is plain to see so if it's up to me
If it's up to me

Now we could choose another path
Close our eyes and turn our backs
Walk away so easily
Have we thought about this carefully?

Chorus:
I will say how I feel with emotion
I will speak loud and true
I will say this with simple devotion
I am in love with you

So I'm telling you cause I just want for you to know
When something's right you don't let go
What we have is plain to see so if it's up to me
If it's up to me

We've tried and we've tried to hide just how strongly we feel
But now, right now, I can't deny this is real

So I'm telling you cause I just want for you to know
When love's at hand you don't let go
What we have is plain to see so if it's up to me
If it's up to me
