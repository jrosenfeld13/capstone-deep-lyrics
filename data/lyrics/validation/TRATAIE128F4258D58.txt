Another day, another dollar in my hand
Working hard to make it, I give it all I can
I got a lot of dreams, and a long way to go
But I know that God provides, if I pray and let him know

'Cause I'm a simple man, and I love the Lord
I know that He'll provide my needs
Yes I'm a simple man, and I love the Lord
His love is everything to me

There's a house on the corner, with a light I can see
And standing in the door is the only girl for me
The reason that she loves me, and we walk hand in hand
Is because I'm a Christian, and we both know where we stand

I'm a simple man, and I love the Lord
We know that He'll provide our needs
Yes I'm a simple man, and I love the Lord
His love is everything to me

And there's a few things that I'd like to say to you
There still is one thing that I need
Someday, when the end of my road has come
I hope to see my Lord say "Thanks for a job well done."

Now if you see my life as happy as can be
The mystery is not so hard. It's a gift, and it's free
This gift is in a book my Lord wrote for me
You can have it too, and then you will see

Why I'm a simple man, and I love the Lord
His gift is everything I need
Yes I'm a simple man, and I love the Lord
His love is everything to me
