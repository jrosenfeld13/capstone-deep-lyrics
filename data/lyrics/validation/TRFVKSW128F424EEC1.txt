Everyday, everyday I have the blues
Everyday, everyday I have the blues
Well, you see me worried, baby
Because it's you I hate to lose
Nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Speakin' of bad luck and trouble
Well, you know, I've had my share
I'm gonna pack my suitcase
Move on down the line
Oh, I'm gonna pack my suitcase
Move on down the line
Well, there ain't nobody worried
And there ain't nobody cryin'
Seems to me everyday, everyday
Everyday I have the blues
Everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday I have the blues
You see me worryin', baby
'Cause it's you I hate to lose
Nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Speakin' of bad luck and trouble
Well, you know I I've had my share
Oh, packin' my suitcase
Oh, movin' down my, yeah
Well, there ain't nobody worried
And there ain't nobody cryin'
Seems to me everyday
I have blues, I have blues
Everyday, everyday
I have the blues, I have blues everyday
You see me worryin', baby
'Cause it's you I hate to lose
Everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday I have the blues
Everyday, blues
