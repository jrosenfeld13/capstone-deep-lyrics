I had a mother chasing planets
Shopping doctors for her Vicodin
A weekend father absent
Searching dungeons for some discipline
School was like a prison
The zombies ruled and the masses just gave in

I had to run - breakout - I had to run

I didn't see the world like the others did
Cause I couldn't see that world

I had to run - break out - I had to run
Break out - break out - break

I am invincible
No one can stop me
Not even mom and dad
They never had a daughter
But I bet they wished they had
I feel like I can walk through walls
I'm fearless and shocking
You're looking at the face of evil baby
Comin' to ya at the tender age of thirteen
The tender age of thirteen
But I'm mean...

I lived high on a hill
Until the ground gave way
I felt a wave of my debris
Pick me up and carry me

And the rocks started rollin'
The rocks started rollin'

Surfing down the avalanche
Surfing down the avalanche
Surfing down the avalanche
Surfing down the avalanche
