Dont know what Im feeling or what I should say
On how my life changed
The day I stumbled on her grave
Not a necrophilliac, I guess I was bored
I just love to spend my
Time with a fresh embalmed corpse
Of course

She was a teenage zombie
She was a teenage corpse
She was a teenage zombie
Drop dead gorgeous thats for sure

I took her to the movies
And I took her to the park
I took her in the back-seat
And thats where she stole my heart
And then I walked her home
From our postmortem date
She took me by the hand and we danced upon her grave

She was a teenage zombie
She was a teenage corpse
She was a teenage zombie
Drop dead gorgeous thats for sure
