Devil's on the loose
Devil's on the loose
Devil's on the loose
Got her brains in her shoes
Now you listen good folks, cos this is a true story
I came here on Friday
No money no hope
I left here on Monday
No money no hope
Devil's on the loose
Devil's on the loose
Devil's on the loose
Got her brains in her shoes
Well, I hope you're still there folks, there's more to come
The devil like moonshine
She's out of control
Of father, oh mother
Oh brother behold
The devil like moonshine
She busted my soul
