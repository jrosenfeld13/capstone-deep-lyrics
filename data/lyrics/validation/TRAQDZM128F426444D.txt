Time I spend with You
Makes me feel that I can do
The impossible, yeah

It's the little things You see
That mean so much to me
Makes You incredible, yes it does

I don't know how I ever lived without You
You mean everything to me, now

Everyday I'm living my life to please You, yes
In every way 'cause I want You to know
I love and need You

In my heart I'm singing Your praises
Every beat and every part, 'cause I want You to know
And show how much I do
'Cause I do

Hard to concede and at times I still believe
That I'm dreamin', dreamin'
Turn my sky from gray
Then You wipe my tears away
And gave me reason, yes You did

I don't know how I ever lived without You
You mean all the world to me
That's why

Everyday I'm living my life to please You, yes
In every way, 'cause I want You to know
That I love and need You

In my heart I'm singing Your praises
Every beat and every part, 'cause I want You to know
And show how much I do
'Cause I do

My love, I pledge to You
The happiness I long for
Has come true

And if ever I've been sure of any one thing
It's here and now
When I knew no one could love me
You found a way somehow
That's why

Everyday I'm living my life to please You, yes
In every way, 'cause I want You to know
I love and need You

In my heart I'm singing Your praises
Every beat and every part, 'cause I want You to know
I love and need You

Everyday I'm living my life to please You, yes
In every way, 'cause I want You to know
I love and need You

In my heart I'm singing Your praises
Every beat and every part, 'cause I want You to know
I love and need You

Everyday I'm living my life to please You, yes
In every way, 'cause I want You to know
I love and need You

In my heart I'm singing Your praises
Every beat and every part, 'cause I want You to know
And show how much I do
'Cause I really really do

Time I spend with You
Makes me feel that I can do
The impossible, yea
