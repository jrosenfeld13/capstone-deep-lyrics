[Intro]
Ahhh ahh ahhh
Ahhh ahh ahhh
Ahhh ahh ahhh
Ahhh ahh ahhh

[Verse 1]
Queen majesty, may I speak to thee?
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
So much, I've longed
(I've longed)
To speak, to you alone
True, I agree, I'm not of your society
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm not a king, just a minstrel
With my song, to you I sing

[Bridge]
Oh, just a minstrel
(Ah)
Our worlds are so far apart
(Ah)
Royal queen, I see love in your eyes
Your eyes, I love you too

[Musical Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Isn't it really true, these things I ask of you?
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh, your majesty, could you really care for me?

As long as you love me
(Ah)
And it won't be so hard
(Ah)
Long as I see love in your eyes
Your eyes
I love you too
(Oh, yes I do)

[Outro]
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
