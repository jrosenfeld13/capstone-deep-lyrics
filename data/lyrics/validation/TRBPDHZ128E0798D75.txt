You know it drives me crazy
Just seeing satin sliding around
Where you and music can take me
There's nothing between you and the sound
One minute wrapped around your finger
One dollar totally off
It's not exactly how I dreamed you
But it's exactly how I love to see you

Give me a sign to go by
Give me a reason to live
Give me a try and you'll find
All you ever knew a lover could give

1st Chorus:
I'll take you someday
Someday your eyes will see
I'll take you anywhere
Anywhere your heart, desires to be
Oh, the desire in me

I remember when we were new
I could't keep my feet on the ground
And then I really got to know you
Already you'd be messing around
You broke my heart in little pieces
You threw my pride on the floor
You knew exactly how to play me
Now I can say it,I can't take anymore

Give me a sign to go by
Give me a reason to stay
Give me the time I wasted
Waiting for your lies at the end of the day

2nd Chorus:
You'll want me someday
Someday your eyes will see
You'll find out soon enough
Your chance of a lifetime is leaving with me

When thoughts collide you won't know
Who your turning to, your turning to
Just stop to think of who's always
Waiting for you, waiting for you
