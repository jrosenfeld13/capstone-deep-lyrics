Well, a twinkle, twinkle, little star
Well along comes Brady in his 'lectric car
Well he got a mean look right in his eye
Gonna shoot somebody jus' to see him die
Well, he been on the job too long
Well, Duncan, Duncan was tending the bar
Well, along come Brady with his shining star
Well, Brady says, "Duncan you are under arrest"
Hmmm Duncan shot a hole right in Brady's chest
Yes, he been on the job too long
Well "Brady, Brady, Brady, well you know you done wrong
Well breaking in here while my games goin' on
Well breaking down the windows, knocking' down the stuff
Uhuh, now you lyin' dead on the barroom floor
Yes, you been on the job too long
Well Old King Brady was a big fat man
Doctor reached out, grab hold of his hand
Felt for his pulse, "Doctor," he said
"I believe, to my soul, King Brady's dead
Yes, he been on the job too long
Well high-tailed carriages standin' all around
Well just takin' Brady to his buryin' ground
Well, high-tailed carriages, rubber-tired hack
Now take him to the graveyard, ain't goin' to bring him back
Yes, he been on the job too long
Well, Women all heard King Brady was dead
Go back home and they rerag in red
Come slippin', slidin, and shufflin' down the street
In their big Mother Hubbards and their stocking feet
He been on the job too long
Well "Brady, Brady well you know you done wrong
Well breaking in here while my gigs goin' on
Well breaking down the windows, knocking' down the stuff
And, now you lyin' dead on the barroom floor
You been on the job too long
