This time my habits are laid to rest
I can't keep these secrets to myself
My lips have been sealed tight for so long
Here we are now face to face again
And my guilt is starting to set in
But there's something keeping me from letting my words flow
I'm desperate for inspiration
Excuses are long gone

Rescue me from what I've become
Because I'm too far along to give this up on my own

Temptation is in full effect
I'm torn but I haven't caved in yet
To the problems I'll create from letting my guard down
I'm done with living in regret
And my past is starting to reflect
This cycle will continue for to long

I'm as shallow as they come
With my self on my mind
I indulge in the finer things of life
But my ego's to strung out
There's no self to absorb
And I'm finding out the hard way there's more of me to explore

Rescue me from what I've become
Because I'm too far along to give this up on my own
Change the way I deal with out my self-control
There is no doubt
I can give this up on my own

It's happening
I'm dying to be reborn
Rescue me
(Rescue me from what I've become)

Rescue me from what I've become
Because I'm too far along to give this up on my own. (Give this up)
Change the way I deal with out my self-control
There is no doubt I can give this up on my own
