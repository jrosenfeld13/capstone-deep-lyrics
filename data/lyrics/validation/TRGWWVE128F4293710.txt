Waiting for the phone to ring
Waiting for the phone to ring
Waiting for the phone to ring
And I hope it will be you
Hope it will be you
Waiting for a knock on the door
Waiting for a knock on the door
Waiting for a knock on the door
And I hope it will be you
Hope it will be you

You know I dig you most
You look so good up close
You make me lose my nerve
I'd like to see you naked
I'd like to watch you shake it
Tracing every curve
Waiting

Waiting for a kiss on the lips
Waiting for a kiss on the lips
Waiting for a kiss on the lips
And I hope it will be you
Hope it will be you
Waiting for that moment to come
Waiting for that moment to come
Waiting for that moment to come
And I hope it will be soon
Hope it will be soon

You know I can't resist
My exhibitionist
You're like a sold out show
Will you get my description
You're going to blur my vision
Make my head explode

Drifting through the pages of the karma sutra
Synchronizing our desire in motion all night

You know you've got me waiting

Waiting for a ride in your car
Waiting for a ride in your car
Waiting for a ride in your car
And I hope it will be soon
Hope it will be soon

You know I dig you most
You look so good up close
You make me lose my nerve
I'd like to see you naked
I'd like to watch you shake it
Tracing every curve

Bridge

You know you got me waiting
Why you got me waiting
You know you got me waiting
Why you keep me waiting
You know you keep me waiting
Why you got me waiting for anything
From you
