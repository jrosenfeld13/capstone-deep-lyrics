I know so many people who think they can do it alone
They isolate their heads and stay in their safety zone

Now what can you tell them and what can you say
That won't make them defensive

I know there's an answer
I know now but I have to find it by myself

They come on like they're peaceful
But inside they're so uptight
They trip through the day
And waste all their thoughts at night

Now how can I tell them
And tell them the way that they live could be better

I know there's an answer
I know now but I have to find it by myself

Now how can I tell them
And tell them the way that they live could be better

I know there's an answer
I know now but I have to find it by myself
A-doo-bee-doo-bay
