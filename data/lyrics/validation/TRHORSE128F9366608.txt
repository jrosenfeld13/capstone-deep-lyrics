[Verse 1]
If a man could be his own fantasy
Then to only breed in captivity is pointless
I've been doing what I like
When I like, how I like, it's joyless

[Refrain]
Only you know me

[Verse 2]
What a waste of war this peace
Baby steps and two more sleeps
Till I get to say sorry
I get hysterical historicals of love
It's just chemicals
Give us something to stop me

[Refrain]
Only you know me

[Chorus]
Since you went away
My heart breaks everyday
You don't know 'cause you're not there
You simply found the words to make
All modern feelings fade away
Only you know me

[Verse 3]
I'm doin' fine
And the sun often shines
What are you thinking?
I done bruised up my mind
With this thunderbird wine
Baby, I'm drinking

[Refrain]
Only you know me

[Chorus]
Since you went away
My heart breaks everyday
You don't know cause you're not there
You simply found the words to make
All modern feelings fade away
Only you know me
Only you know me

Since you went away
My heart breaks everyday
You don't know cause you're not there
You simply found the words to make
All modern feelings fade away
Only you know me
Only you know me
Only you, only you
Only you know me

Waiting for you all my life
Waiting for you all my life
Waiting for you
