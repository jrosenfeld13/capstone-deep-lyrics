[Verse 1:]
I went to a party last Saturday night
I didn't get laid
I got in a fight
Uh, huh
It ain't no big thing

Late for my job
And the traffic was bad
Had to borrow ten bucks from my old man
Uh, huh
It ain't no big thing

I went to a party last Saturday night
I told you that story
It'd be alright
Uh, huh
It ain't no big thing

But I know what I like
I know I like dancing with you
And I know what you like
I know you like dancing with me
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus:]
Kiss me once
Kiss me twice
C'mon, pretty baby
Kiss me deadly

[Verse 2:]
Had a few beers
Getting high
Sitting, watching the time go by
Uh, huh
It ain't no big thing

Nothing to eat and no TV
Looking in the mirror
Don't get it for me
Uh, huh
It ain't no big thing

But I know what I like
I know I like dancing with you
And I know what you like
I know you like dancing with me
Oh, yeah

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

[Bridge:]
You know I like dancing with you
Dancing with you
C'mon

[Repeat Chorus:]

Kiss me once
Kiss me twice
C'mon, pretty baby
Kiss me

C'mon, pretty baby
Kiss me
C'mon, pretty baby
Kiss me deadly
