She's got a way - Of getting inside your soul
She'd breach the walls of Jericho
Make you fall like virgin snow
She's got a smile - Makes you forget the things
You were only just thinking about
It kind of turns me inside out
And if I try to conceal, she's got a way to reveal

I feel so naked - I feel so totally exposed
It's such a mystery, how she seems to know, every part of me
I feel so shaken - It's like everybody knows
Whenever she touches me, no one else can feel, as much as me
Yeah she's got a way

She's got a way - Of taming the wild in me
With patience and serenity
I'm drowning in her revery
And I can't run away - She's got a way to make me stay

I feel so naked - I feel so totally exposed
It's such a mystery, how she seems to know, every part of me
I feel so shaken - It's like everybody knows
Whenever she touches me, no one else can feel, as much as me
Oh, 'cause she's got a way

She comes to me like rain falls down my window
Sure as night will follow day - I'll surrender
She's got a way

I feel so naked - I feel so totally exposed
It's such a mystery, how she seems to know, every part of me
I feel so shaken - It's like everybody knows
Whenever she touches me, no one else can feel, as much as me
Oh, 'cause she's got a way - She's got a way

Such a mystery - She seems to know, every part of me
Oh she's got a way
She's got a way
She's got a way
