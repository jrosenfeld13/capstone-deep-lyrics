I can't see you in front of me but I know you're there
Feel my breath on your neck and my fingers through your hair
Get it up, I can't relax
Don't hold back, you know I want it bad
Woah oh oh! I can't say no
I lose control cause with you I'm like an animal
Woah oh oh! I can't say no
I lose control cause with you I'm like an animal
Just a drop on my lip and my heart starts to react
Nothing bites like me when I'm ready to attack, Hah!
Take it off, I wanna feel your skin
Take a bite, you know it's not a sin
Wild in the street, Don't care if anybody sees
Don't bother sayin' please if you wanna ravage me, Yeah!
