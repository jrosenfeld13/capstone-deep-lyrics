If I could separate me from myself, I'd stay away from me
If you decide I'm wrong, and you can wait that long, maybe it's not too late

I will not lose you to the melting sky
Or to the mad parade
To the bloody jaws or the fire fall
Don't be afraid

You need never know, a cold heart, heart of stone
Or lonely memory, you will never be alone

If I could separate me from myself, I'd stay away from me
If you decide I'm wrong, and you can wait that long, maybe it's not too late

I will not lose you to a world that doesn't care
To the monsters that would have you
Never surrender you, I always will be there
I will be there to wrap myself around you
I will not lose you to the dark or to the nights
To the terrible machine
Never let you lose your light

If I could separate me from myself, I'd stay away from me
But if you decide I'm wrong, and you can wait that long, don't fall away from me

Don't pull away...

If I could separate me from myself, I'd stay away from me
But if you think I belong, stay and keep me strong, maybe it's not too late
