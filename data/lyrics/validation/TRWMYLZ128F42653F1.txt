Well the world's getting heavy and it sticks to my feet
Well practiced in losing and brave in defeat
With no friends in this business you keep your enemies sweet
And keep one in the chamber for every stranger you meet

I'll take pieces of silver for a head full of rhyme
I'll take a headache and a casket for a life full of time
I'll take a patch of new mexico and I will call it mine
And I'll swear never to return to the scene of the crime

Well the mob's getting angry and the torches alight
Because they're putting up taxes by a penny tonight
And you can never taste freedom boys if you run from a fight
And when the heavens are falling take a step to the right

So we smoke ourselves skinny and we drink ourselves blind
Self-discovery knocks but there is nothing to find
And if you're looking for victims would you keep me in mind
Let us be kissed on the cheek, let us be fucked from behind

There's no need to tread carefully there's no need to fear
Just talk in obscure non-specifics and try to look all sincere
Every administration blames the one from last year
So when consequence calls there'll be nobody here

So we sell out our kids for a tank full of gas
And a lifetime in plastics for a fistful of cash
Let the rivers run dry let the economy crash
And let the discotheques resound to the requiem mass

So we sell out our kids for a tank full of gas
And a lifetime in plastics for a fistful of cash
Let the rivers run dry let the economy crash
And let the discotheques resound to the requiem mass
