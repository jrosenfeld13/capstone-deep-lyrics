I just hope you're on a better place
Where peace really exists
Where thoughts can fly like yellow birds
And land wherever they wish
I just hope that you can really see me
And guide my way through the march
Cause it's so hard to live with all this memories
And no support from your arms
Come and take me
Come and take me
Let me rest in your breast
I just hope I will never wake up again and

I just hope you're on a better place
Where peace really exists
Where thoughts can fly like yellow birds
And land wherever they wish
Come and take me
Come and take me
Let me rest in your breast
I just hope I will never wake up again and
Forever be with you
Forever be with you
