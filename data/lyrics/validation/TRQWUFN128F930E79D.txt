I don't mean to cause mass hysteria
It's on its way and it's probably gonna bury you
And there's nothing much that you can do
There's nothing good left to imitate
Nobody's left now to mediate
And everybody's still got something to prove
I can't even tell what's right from wrong
Will someone please tell me what's going on

'Cause we need more than a revolution
Something deeper than a false solution
To replace what's going wrong
So don't look alarmed when everyone's choking
Suffocated on what they're hoping in
Let's move this along

Don't ask for me to participate
I'm just the wrong kind of candidate
It's pure hypocrisy that makes me, me
God show me past all this ignorance
I can't pretend to be innocent
It takes much more than words to make a stand

'Cause there's no easy answer
Greed became a cancer
And now it's eating us away
