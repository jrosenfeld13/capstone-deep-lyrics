Oh, and you're taking it slow
And hell knows if you know what I want
Oh, and I've seen better behaviour
But just tonight, you will be my saviour

I said, will there be a day when I honestly hold it?
Oh, just touch it, any way?
Ooh ooh ooh

Oh, and you're taking your time
And hell knows if I will get mine
You're the type of girl who likes control
So woman, won't you please cut my throat?

I said you kind of smell like nursing home hallways
You know the wrong way
It's that or the highway
And the nursing home stairs

Oh, I've been sleeping at home
Ooh ooh ooh
Oh, I said woman, I've been sleeping at home
Ooh ooh ooh
I said woman, I've been sleeping at home
Ooh ooh ooh
Oh, I said woman, I've been sleeping at home
Ooh ooh ooh
Oh oh
