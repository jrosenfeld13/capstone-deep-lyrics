Someone said romance is dead
But I'm afraid that I don't agree
If you've a heart of lead
And a hole in your head
You're so blind that you can't see
There's a fire burns
As the world turns
Lights up our dreams
Who else said romance is dead?
Come take a walk with me
Sha la la, la la la, la la lee

I spray your name on the side of a train
Watch lovers kiss in the final frame
A silhouette dancing in a window pane
Love is a burning flame
The girl on a runway waiting for a plane
Is sweeter than the locket on a golden chain
Lights awake down a misty lane
See a rainbow every time it rains

Love on a left bank, a saxophone sighed
Drifting on a reed around midnight
Wrapped up in the sunset glowing outside
Alone on a deep end in the pink twilight
Snowflakes falling in the Christmas lights
Stars in heaven burning bright
A football flight on the front of the night
The roar of a crowd red and white

Someone said romance is dead
Well I'm afraid that I don't agree
If you've a heart of lead
And a hole in your head
You're so blind that you can't see
There's a fire burns
As the world turns
Lights up our dreams
Who else said romance is dead?
Come take a walk with me
Sha la la, la la la, la la lee
Sha la la, la la la, la la lee

Flowers at sunset, blues in the night
Kissed by a river in the pale moonlight
The words of the poets, lovers who sighed
Beneath the moon's eye in the heat of the night
Bathed in the glow of an old gaslight
Sitting in the rain it's a wonderful life
Take you in my arms and hold you tight
Lost in the stars with the satellites

Now someone said romance is dead
Well I'm afraid that I don't agree
If you've a heart of lead
And a hole in your head
You're so blind that you can't see
There's a fire burns
As the world turns
Lights up our dreams
Who else said romance is dead?
Come take a walk with me
Sha la la, la la la, la la lee
Sha la la, la la la, la la lee
Sha la la, la la la, la la lee
