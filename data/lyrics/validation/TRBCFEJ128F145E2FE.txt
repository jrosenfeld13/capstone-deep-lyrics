There coming over Charaton Bridge
Look do you see the man who is poor but rich

What do you wish and where do you go
Who are you, where are you from
Will you tell me your name?
Rest awhile, call me your friend
Please stay with me I'd like to help

Then he said, "How can I speak when I'm dry
And my throat is burning
So bring me aid and I'll answer your doubts
Friend in need I'd like your help
Please take me home I'll stay with you"

Then said he, "Fair Pantagruel
My name is Panurge and I have come from Hell"

Look at my friend, look around my friend
Look at my friend, look all around you
Look at my friend, take all round you
Look at my friend, look all around you
Hey, friend, look at my friend

Perque deos deasque omnes obtestatus sum, ut si quae vos pietas

So brotherhood was made as their bond
Carried him home and provide for his needs
And his shelter this day was done as no other the like
Faithfully their vow was made and from that day they were as one

Then said he, "Fair Pantagruel
My name is Panurge and I have come from Hell"
