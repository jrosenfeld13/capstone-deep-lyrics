My baby's fine
He always keeps me guessing
But never keeps me guessing about his love
He's had more girls than Howard Hughes had money
And you may think it funny when I say he loves me only
And who are you to say what he does when I'm not around
Just because I fell in love with Casanova Brown
Act 2 scene 5 is my command peformance
My name is clairvoyance and it's all too deep
I was the one
Who said tune in tomorrow
I love to the bone marrow, even when I am asleep and
Who are you to say
What I did when you were'nt around
Just because I fell in love with you
Casanova Brown
Standing room only, the concerts sold out
Everyone's there for the party
The hush turns to a shout
Everyone's got a piece
Of the pie
Of you and I
But nobody knows when the lights go down
That the tears fall harder than the whole damn crowd
Throwing down my love
Is just about all I can do
Was'nt I the one who said
I'll have my cake and eat it too
Just could'nt wait any longer
You pushed till I was through
I love you so
It hurt me but I had to let
Let you go
Did you hear me crying, baby
It sounded a little bit like this
You did'nt have to make me cry
Tell me Daddy I ask you why, It's over
It's over
It's over
Over before the love turns to hate
Let's let it end and let's still be friends
Oohhh ,oohhh, oohhh
