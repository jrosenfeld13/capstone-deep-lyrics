If I tried, would you still call me son?
If I tried, would you call me at all?
If I say that I'll go, regardless of what you want me to do
If I say that I'll go, regardless, I'm better off without
I'm better off without you

If I change my mind, it won't be soon enough for you
But I'm not you
I'm not you
I'm not you

I'll try to compromise for you to see
There's so many other things for me to find out
Run myself into the ground
Would you please forgive me if I found my way back home?

Everything I see
Everything I do
Everywhere I've been
These mean nothing to you?
