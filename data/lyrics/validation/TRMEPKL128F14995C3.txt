I'm all out of hope
One more bad break could bring a fall
When I'm far from home
Don't call me on the phone
To tell me you're alone
It's easy to deceive
It's easy to tease
But hard to get release
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Got no human grace your eyes without a face
Yeah
I spend so much time
Believing all the lies
To keep the dream alive
Now it makes me sad
It makes me mad at truth
For lovin' what was you
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage your eyes without a face
Got no human grace your eyes without a face

Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage your eyes without a face
Got no human grace your eyes without a face
Such a human waste your eyes without a face
And now it's getting worse
