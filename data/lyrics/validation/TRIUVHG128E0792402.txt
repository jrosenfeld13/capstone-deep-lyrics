[Verse 1]
Little one don't be a fool
I'm a wreck when I look mighty
In euphoria I'm bruised
In confusion next I'm lightning
In complacence I am small
Through oblivion I'm charged

[Chorus]
So follow my way
When I'm not leading anyone
Open and frayed
When you can see that I'm unsure
Out on my way
I'm only pure when I get lost
And you're only needing when you're finding that I'm not

[Verse 2]
You're just looking for a boy
Bathed in infrared and sunlight
I'm all polish and reward
When I'm confident I hopeless
Just like everybody else
Right before they fall apart

[Chorus]
So follow my way
When I am falling from your heart
When I'm the pain
Fever and sweet relief in one
Out on my way
Though I'm not worthy of your trust
Follow me down into a swan dive
All eyes closed tight

[Bridge]
Lowly, slowly, now I know I love where you go
When you're gone
Warm your hands inside my veins
I might be contagious
Through oblivion I charge

[Outro]
So follow my my way
When I am useless to your cause
When I derail
Calm in the patience of remorse
Out on my way
Out on my empty open nerves
When all you know is that I don't know where we are
When all you know is that I don't know
Follow my way
