What a wonderful time that was
I was happy with you and a life that tossed in the wind
Someday Ill toil to write it down
Yeah, one day Ill reveal it to you my love
Repeat your name, Ill never stop
Youll never know how much I care
What can I do when Im beside you
What can I say when Im around you
All of this for just one kiss, wouldnt change it for the world
(Wouldnt change it for the world)
What can I do when Im beside you
What can I say when Im around you
Go it alone, find me at home
You dont care
You dont care
Youve been very kind
Do you mind if I sit and watch you
Sigh and say
I wouldnt change it for the world
A kind of Eden in my mind
A kind of heaven I will find
When I hear you say that you really care
But what can I do when Im beside you
What can I say when Im around you
All of this for just one kiss, wouldnt change it for the world
(Wouldnt change it for the world)
A kind of Eden in my mind
A kind of heaven I will find
When I hear you say you really care
