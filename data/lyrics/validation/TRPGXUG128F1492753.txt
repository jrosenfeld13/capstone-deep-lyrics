You say "I think I am leavable
That he got drained
All the colors have left"
Oh but you know right now
You'd do it again
Cause I waited my whole life
You said "I made him so colorless
And that the air just got so cancerous"
Deep in the right school play
With thee wrong scene
I guess it changes everything

So we're on time
To say good night
But we know that
It means good-bye

Say that "It made him so colorless
That the air just got so cancerous"
I bet you know right now
You'd do it again
Cause I waited my whole life

So we are on time
To say good night
But we know that
It's like good-bye

You're all that I have now
So don't never let me go
You're all that I have now
So don't never let me go
You're all that I have now
So don't never let me go
You're all that I have now
So don't never let me go
You're all that I have now
