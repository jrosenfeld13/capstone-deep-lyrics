Oh come down from the watertower remembering why
A highway town in the sea of attrition, owning my eye
A sea I see at the end of the road, in the wilder tides
Lay me down in the echoes of seasons, with your hands over my eyes

Dawn is brave to allow all the sparrows a place for the night
In the dawn of the day, when the birds want to follow the yellowing sky
Lay me down in the echoing seasons, with your hands over my eyes
No you landed on my tongue

Cause around here folks do what they want
And where is the life you placed down on my heart?
Days go by, crosses all Ive lost
And where is the bridge that crosses all my haunts?
Cause round here folks do what they want
