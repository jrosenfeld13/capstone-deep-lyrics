I lied, right to your face
And I'll burn, eternally
In flames (flames), in flames (flames)
In flames (flames), in flames (flames)

Instinct has failed me now
Enslaved by my deceit

Lies sink in like gasoline
Saturates my body
One last spark of dishonesty
And that will be the death of me

Damned in flames, damned in flames
Damned in flames, damned in flames

Lies engulf me...lies they burn...me...
Lies they purge...me...lies they free...me...

Lies sink in like gasoline
Saturates my body
One last spark of dishonesty
And that will be the death of me

Damned in flames, damned in flames
Damned in flames, damned in flames
