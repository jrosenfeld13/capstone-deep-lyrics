I'm not sleeping
Wearing thin
I'm just waiting
Waiting to begin
Got my memories
To get me through
Memories kill me
Reminding me of you

Come down for you
So many miles
Heals my ailing
Just to see you smile
Hear me howling
At your door
You're everything and
I'm dying for some more
Dying for some more

Doesn't matter what I'll say
When I'm far away
Away
Doesn't matter what I'll do
When it's without you

I'm not sleeping
Wearing thin
I'm just waiting
Waiting to begin
Hear me howling
At you door
You're everything and
I'm dying for some more
Dying for some more

Doesn't matter what I'll say
When I'm far away
Away
Doesn't matter what I'll do
When it's without you
