I have never been aboard a steamer
I am just content to be a dreamer
Even if I could afford a steamer
I will take the ferry boat every time

I love to ride the ferry
Where music is so merry
There's a man who plays the concertina
On the moonlit upper deck arena

While boys and girls are dancing
While sweethearts are romancing
Life is like a mardi-gras
Funiculi, funicula

Happy, we cling together
Happy, we sing together
Happy, with the ferry boat serenade

I am happy, very, very happy
When we're on the ferry
The music is so merry
There's a man who plays the concertina
On the moonlit upper deck arena, arena

I love to ride the ferry
Where music is so merry
There's a man who always plays the concertina, oh my
On the moonlit upper deck arena, by and by

While the boys and girls are dancing, oh dancing
While, while the sweethearts are romancing
Life is like a mardi-gras
Funiculi, funicula

Happy, we cling together
Happy, we sing together
Happy with the ferry boat serenade

I love to ride the ferry
Sailing, sailing where, where the music is so merry
There's a man who just plays the concertina
On the moonlit upper deck arena

All the while the boys and girls are dancing
Look around and you see sweethearts romancing
Life is like a mardi-gras
Funiculi, funicula

Happy, we cling together
Happy, we sing together
Happy, with the ferry boat serenade
