She had her reasons and I really couldn't blame her
But I'd grown accustomed to having her near
Just when I thought I couldn't wait any longer
She called to tell me what I wanted to hear

(She said she's coming home)
Seems like it's been forever
(She's had her time alone)
We'll finally be together
(She said she's coming home)
I guess she's tired of making it on her own
She said she's coming home

I know she told me that it wouldn't be forever
She'd be back but she couldn't say when
Now the time has finally come and it's no secret
I can't wait to start all over again

(She said she's coming home)
Seems like it's been forever
(She's had her time alone)
We'll finally be together
(She said she's coming home)
I guess she's tired of making it on her own
She said she's coming home

She's coming home
She said she's coming home

(She said she's coming home)
And that could mean forever
(She's had her time alone)
We'll finally be together
(She said she's coming home)
I know she's tired of making it on her own

(She said she's coming home)
That could mean forever
(She's had her time alone)
We'll gonna be together
(She said she's coming home)
Oh, she's tired of making it on her own
She said she's coming home

(She's coming home, she's coming home)
She's coming home
(She's coming home)
She's coming home
(She's coming home)
