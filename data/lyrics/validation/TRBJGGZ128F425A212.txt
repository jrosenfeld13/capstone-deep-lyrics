No....
Mm....
My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so
And this I know for sure
Oh but does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me walk out the door
Don't try to fight the feeling
'Cause the thought alone
Is killing me right now
Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking through together
'Cause we don't know how
Yeah...
Chorus
Hey Ya.. (we don't no how) Hey Ya (Hey ay)
Hey Ya.. (mm hm..)Hey Ya
You think you've got it
Oh, you think you've got it
But got it just don't get it
Til there's's nothing at all
We've be together
Oh, we've been together
But separate's always better
When there's feelings involved
If what they say is nothing
Nothing forever
Then why you, why you, why you here together
No no no
Hey Ya.. (why you here) Hey Ya (why you here)
Hey Ya.. (I don't no why) Hey Ya Hey ya
Hey Ya.. (Hey Ya) Hey Ya (Hey Ya)
Hey Ya.. Hey Ya
Just coz there's nothin to prove (nothing lasts forever)
No no yeah yeah (nothing nothing at all)
Do do do do do no
(nothing nothing at all)
Hey Ya... Aaaa) Hey Ya
Hey Ya.. (hey ya) Hey Ya
Hey Ya.. (i don't I don't know why) Hey Ya
Hey Ya.. (nothin lasts forever) Hey Ya
(nothin lasts forever)
Hey Ya.. (nothin lasts forever) Hey Ya....
Hey Ya.. Hey Ya
Hey Ya.. Hey Ya...
My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so
And this I know for sure
Oh but does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me walk out the door
Don't try to fight the feeling
'Cause the thought alone
Is killing me right now
Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking through together
'Cause we don't know how
