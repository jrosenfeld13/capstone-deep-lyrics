I speak my mind. I don't hold it back
That's how I am, and I'm hopin' that's where you' at
Like I lay it on the line and that's how it should be
If you're gonna make it, man you've got to agree

I'm a stone cold believer, yes, I am
I believe you can do it if you say that you can
I'm a stone cold believer, not a smooth talkin' man
Believe I got things well at hand

Wanna climb that ladder, y' wanna make it to the top
Takes only one thing, gotta give it all y' got
Knew a man who couldn't lose, 'cause he never gave in
He stuck to his pistol well it made him a better man

I'm a stone cold believer, yes, I am
I believe you can do it if you say that you can
I'm a stone cold believer, not a smooth talkin' man
Believe I got things well at hand
