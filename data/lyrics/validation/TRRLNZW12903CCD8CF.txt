Well I said that we should run away
And live to fight another day
When I see the devil running free
I'm holding on to you and me

And the sun goes down when he's around
He just sets us up to put us down
Well I know we're not the only two
I'm just like you

Take my hand now
I'm not sure I can deal with it
Take my hand now
I'm not sure I can deal with it
Take my hand now

Are you gonna be the same
When they make you change your name
They just break us day by day
Into million of small pieces of rainbow
When do,you think it will rain?
I really wish it could rain now
Take my hand and see
We're still part of the rainbow

Well you hate yourself when you feel so weak
You hurt yourself and then you bleed
Well I know that you could change it all
If you really would

Are you gonna be the same
When they make you change your name
They just break us day by day
Into million of small pieces of rainbow
When do,you think it will rain?
I really wish it could rain now
Take my hand and see
We're still part of the rainbow

Are you gonna be the same
When they make you change your name
Are you gonna be the same
When they make you change your name

When people get strange I just run
You should know it, you should know
When people get strange all around
You should know it, you should know
When people get strange I just hide
You should know it, you should know
You should know it, you should know
