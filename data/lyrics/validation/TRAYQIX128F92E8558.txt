It's me again, insignificant me again
Just me again and my broken heart
How can I love again, Now she's gone again
I'm on that ship again,Called a sinking heart
Oh I am so lonely
I'm the man who would kill for love
I'd kill for love!
Oh, I am a phoney Valentino
The man who would kill for
Man who would kill for
Man who would kill ...for love!
So I begin again, In all the wrong again
The types of bar again, So full of charm
I buy the drinks again, For the thousand girls again
In the hope again I'll find another you
Oh I am so lonely
I'm the man who would kill for love
I'd kill for love!
Oh, I am a phoney Valentino
The man who would kill for
Man who would kill for
Man who would kill ...for love!
So I begin again, begin again
Begin again, right from the start
Begin again, begin again
Begin again, back to the drawing board
Oh I am so lonely
I'm the man who would kill for love
I'd kill for love!
Oh, I am a phoney Valentino
The man who would kill for
Man who would kill for
Man who would kill ...for love!
