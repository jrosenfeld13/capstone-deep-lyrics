You taste like wine, battle smoke
Something crying
Blue like oxygen
Coming in and out again

Good god i want you
Run hide and i'll hunt you
Tracing your mouth like clouds across the sun

I am the gentlest hammer
I am the gentlest hammer
Coming down down
Till i break through
Gotta get into you

I am the gentlest hammer
I am the gentlest hammer
Coming down down
Till i break through
Gotta get into you
Gotta get into you

You polish stones with your eyes, set kits free
Out where ships have sank coming trying to rescue me
My hand is drawing faster
I am the one you're after
And you move like shadows on the wall

I am the gentlest hammer
I am the gentlest hammer
Coming down down
Till i break through
Gotta get into you
Gotta get into you

You are my garden green, golden leaves
Haloed trees
Move into me
Take me like the enemy
I'll stay until it's ended
Till all your aches are mended
Come here sillouette
And let me see you break

I am the gentlest hammer
I am the gentlest hammer
Coming down down
Till i break through
Gotta get into you
I am the gentlest hammer
I am the gentlest hammer
Coming down down
Till i break through
Gotta get into you
Gotta get into you
Gotta get into you
Gotta get into you
