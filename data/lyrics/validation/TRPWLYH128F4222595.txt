You said you never would be mine
Come on and take a little precious time
Hey there's nothing left to loose
Stand a minute in my shoes

Take a trip on the love track
Take a trip on the love track
Take a trip take a trip take a trip
On the love track love track

Hey you on a fancy freaky trip
Following my swaying hips
You'll never wanna change that way
Cause I see it in your eyes you wanna stay

Take a trip on the love track
Take a trip on the love track
Take a trip take a trip take a trip
On the love track love track
