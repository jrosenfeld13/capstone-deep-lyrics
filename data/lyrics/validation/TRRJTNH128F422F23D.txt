Spoken:
Oh yeah, Merry Christmas

Come, they told me (pa-rum-pa-pum-pum)
A newborn king to see (pa-rum-pa-pum-pum)
Our finest gifts we bring (pa-rum-pa-pum-pum)
To lay before the king (pa-rum-pa-pum-pum, rum-pa-pum-pum, rum-pa-pum-pum, yeah)
So, to honor Him, oh yes
When we come
On my drum

Little baby (pa-rum-pa-pum-pum)
I am a poor boy too (pa-rum-pa-pum-pum), oh yeah
I have no gifts to bring (pa-rum-pa-pum-pum)
That's fit to give a king (pa-rum-pa-pum-pum, rum-pa-pum-pum, rum-pa-pum-pum)
Shall I play for you, oh yeah
Shall I play for you, oh yeah, on, on, on
On my drum?
On my drum?

Come on - spoken

Mary nodded (pa-rum-pa-pum-pum)
The ox and lamb kept time (pa-rum-pa-pum-pum)
I played my drum for Him (pa-rum-pa-pum-pum), eh
I played my best for Him (pa-rum-pa-pum-pum, rum-pa-pum-pum, rum-pa-pum-pum, yeah)
Come on - spoken
Then, He smiled at me, oh yeah
Then Jesus smiled at me
All right
Me and my drum
Me and my drum
On my drum
On my drum
On my drum
