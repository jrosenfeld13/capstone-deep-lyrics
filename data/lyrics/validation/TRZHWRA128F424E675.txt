She grabs me, takes me to the bed once more
It's just a baby, but she's done it all before
Taken advantage of a two year old, raped his innocence
And what for? Power?
Well I hope you got your score
You ruined me; my physical communication to other beings
My overall sense of feeling
I wish I could cut your memories from my brain
They haunt me, isolating me, infecting me with fear
A fear of a touch, and fear of women
Didn't you think that you would turn me into
A man that's afraid of a touch?
It's just skin against skin, but it freezes me from within
This english-burdened tongue cannot express how plagued I feel
The slightest touch brings me back to her lust, to her perverseness
Dear God, take this away
