What's that blood upon your sword, Edward?
It is the blood of my gray mare
Your gray mare's blood is never that red, Edward
You're telling lies, you're telling lies

What's that blood upon your sword, Edward?
It is the blood of my greyhound
Your greyhound's blood is never that red, Edward
You're telling lies, you're telling lies

What's that blood upon your sword, Edward?
It is the blood of my great hawk
Your great hawk's blood is never that red, Edward
You're telling lies, you're telling lies

And the sun will never shine, Edward
And the moon has lost its light
And the sun will never shine, Edward
You're telling lies, you're telling lies

What's that blood on your sword, Edward?
It is the blood of my brother
Why did you kill your own brother, Edward?
For telling lies, telling lies

And the sun will never shine, Edward
And the moon has lost its light
And the sun will never shine, Edward
You're telling lies, you're telling lies

What will you do, where will you go, Edward?
What will you do, how will you die?
I'll sail away, I'll sail away, mother
And you'll never see more of me

What of you wife, what of your son, Edward?
What will you leave to your mother dear?
The curse of hell to burn her with, mother
For telling lies, for telling lies

And the sun will never shine, Edward
And the moon has lost its light
And the sun will never shine, Edward
You're telling lies, you're telling lies

Telling lies, telling lies
Telling lies, telling lies
Telling lies, telling lies
