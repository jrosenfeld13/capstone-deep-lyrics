I finally learned to spit it out
And with that alone I've said too much
Cause anything a secret
Is willing to be kept that way
You're looking for the truths of mine
They're found in every other line
You're looking for the truths of mine
Many is a mood of mine

Penny Racer gone to mars in flames
Ready as ever to survive

Well everyones an editor
Trying to get a read on me
The less complete a sentance is
The more I guess I tried to say
You're looking for the truths in mine
They're found in every other line
You're looking for the truths in mine
Many is a mood of mine

Penny Racer gone to mars in flames
Ready as ever to survive

We'll survive

Everything's a problem
Is that why everybody answers all at once?
Everything's a problem in my mind
So why, so why make it any harder on me?
We'll make you make it, make you make it alright

Penny Racer gone to mars in flames
Ready as ever to survive
We'll survive
