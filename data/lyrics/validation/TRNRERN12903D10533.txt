According to your confined outlook
I'm punished into the mud
You think no-one could be right
Except you and your God
Who are you to give punishments
And tell who is right
Who are you to preach
Profligacy of life
I would accept your religion
If you could hold it yourself
Don't try to offer your visions
Because I have my owns
I suppose it's hard to be religious
When life can offer more
Don't despise those who live in sin
'Cause they only enjoy life
According to your confined outlook
I'm punished into the mud
You think no-one could be right
Except you and your God
Who are you to give punishments
And tell who is right
Who are you to preach
Profligacy of life
