Once again the sunrise ends your day
I can't come over
All you want is silence anyway
But your tears are beautiful
The couch is stained from your make-up
I wonder when you wake up
If you'll remember
All that lies

You say that this is freedom
And maybe this ain't real
You say you're tired of chasing the stars
But here's a new beginning
Its your freshman year
And you don't even know who you are

You fell in love
On the freeway
Where the music leads your feet
But yo turned the otherway
Down another street
So playing games when we were young
You pretend theres nothing wrong
And I guess I'll pretend I'm blind

You say that this is freedom
And maybe this ain't real
You say you're tired of chasing the stars
But here's a new beginning
Its your freshman year
And you don't even know who you are

Freshman year

Freshman year

In the mirror I see your face
Together we can leave this place
Mercy set us free tonight

You say that this is freedom
And maybe this ain't real
You say you're tired of chasing the stars
But here's a new beginning
Its your freshman year
And you don't even know who you are

I give myself life
You give yourself life
We give ourselves away
