Conversations all the same
I aint gonna play no fuking games
Deep inside I wanna change
But I know Ill always walk away
If I tell you everything, will you tell me what you fear?
When I tell you what I feel, will you tell me what is real?
Im nothing that youve seen before
I am free, I'm gonna be all that you see
When you wake up next to me
And when you dream who will you be, when you wake up next to me?
Smoking drinking gasoline I am everything you want to me
Got nine lives I have wasted five
But I know that time is on my side
If I tell you everything, will you tell me what you fear?
When I tell you what I feel, will you tell me what is real?
Im nothing that youve seen before
I am free, I'm gonna be all that you see
When you wake up next to me
And when you dream who will you be, when you wake up next to me?
