When I was a young boy I drove my mother crazy
When I was a young man I drove my teachers wild
Oh whoa oh whoa nobody to con-trol me
Oh whoa modern lover I need you near me

Never want to leave ya
Never want to leave ya
Never want to leave ya
No no no no no

Reality anonymous is comin' after me
They want me shakin' they want me screamin'
Outside 12 year olds are carryin' machine guns
They give the orders I must be dreamin'

Everywhere I go 'n' everything I see
It's all startin' to look like
Some strange mythology
Where is the spirit where is the fire

Never want to leave ya
Never want to leave ya
Never want to leave ya
No no no no no

And then I broke in two
Ya don't really think everything is really
The way you thought you thought it was did you
I broke in two but now I think it's time to move

Move
Move
Move
Move me

Watch out
Machine gun machine gun
Oh whoa oh whoa nobody to control me
Oh whoa oh whoa nobody to convince me
That everything is just gonna be o-k

Never gonna leave ya
Never gonna leave ya
Never gonna leave ya
No no no no no
No no no no no
No no nobody to control me
