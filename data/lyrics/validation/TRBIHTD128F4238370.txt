I like to live my life on the edge
No one can stop me, no!
Now it's too late
Never thinking twice about what I do
I'm like a savage animal on the loose
Live fast, oh you gotta die young

I live my life, don't wanna waste no time
I don't need no rules, all I touch is mine
Never thinking twice about what I do
I'm like a savage animal on the loose
Live fast, oh you gotta die young

Rippin' and shreddin' at speeds faster than Hell
No one's gonna stop me now, not even time will tell
Crashin' through the walls of time
Explosions from below, no ones gonna stop this ride
The doors of time will blow
Live fast, oh you gotta die young
Live fast (fast) oh you gotta die young
