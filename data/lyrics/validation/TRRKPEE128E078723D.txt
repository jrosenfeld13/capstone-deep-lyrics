If you take a ride on a plane or a train
You know you're going somewhere
But is it in vain
Oh tell me
Please tell me
Catch a staring glance at the man on the ground
Do you think his life has been lost or found
Please tell me
Oh tell me

Is anybody out there
Can you find it in your heart to care
Do you find it the same

In your life, you must help yourself
If you don't
There will be no one else
You've got to save yourself, you know, you know

If you want the apple of your eye
You've gotta make a move
Give it one more try
Then savor the flavor

Got to get up, got to feel the day
Make a strong move
Make it all go your way
Baby, not just maybe

Is anybody out there
Can you find it in your heart to care
Do you find it the same

In your life, you must help yourself
If you don't
There will be no one else
You've got to save yourself, you know, you know
