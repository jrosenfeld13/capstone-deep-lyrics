He's not so good in a crowd
But when you get him alone
You'd be surprised
He isn't much at a dance
But then when he takes you home
You'd be surprised
He doesn't look like much of a lover
But don't judge a book by its cover
He's got the face of an angel but
There's a devil in his eye
He's such a delicate thing
But when he starts to squeeze
You'd be surprised
He doesn't look very strong
But when you sit on his knees
You'd be surprised
At a party or at a ball
I've got to admit he's nothing at all
But in an easy chair
You'd be surprised
