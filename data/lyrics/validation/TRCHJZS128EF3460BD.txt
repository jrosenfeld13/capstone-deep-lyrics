Well theres something in the way she said I hate you cause you breathe
Its not the first time that I heard it but this one is out of reach
I got my mind set on destruction
And if it will strike me hard
Will you remember me

Oh its in the way you set your life on your alarm and hit the snoozer
You waste your life expectancy
You throw away you hopes and dreams
The night will never end, itll stay forever
Well the dark will eat you up inside

So I smile and shed a tear and said when will you go away
She said who cares youre not entitled to ask those things today
Dont let the salt get in your eye
Dont let the ghost get in your heart
There were sweet memories in the corner of my mind
They were telling me to throw up all the things that I want to hide that

Were having fun in the daytime
Well chase the stars in the night time
And well take the sun in the morning
We just dont care if they see us fall
If it was true

Well today I bought the paper by myself and cried cause everyone was happy
And on the streets well they were dancing to some kind of Puerto Rican music
That we would hate but we would just move along to

So if youre driving in your car and hear this song on radio 1
Well I know that it sounds silly
cause you dont have a car
But I just read it in a book
That these things happen in the fictive world

That's when I smile and shed a tear and said when will you go away
She said who cares youre not entitled to ask those things today
Dont let the salt get in your eye
Dont let the ghost get in your heart
There were sweet memories in the corner of my mind
They were telling me to throw up all the things that I want to hide

Were having fun in the daytime
Well chase the stars in the night time
And well take the sun in the morning
We just dont care if they see us fall
Just dont care
Just dont care at all
If it was true

Well there is something in the air that makes it difficult to live
The way we lived back in the days when we had all the time to kill
Its just the wildfire burning
Theres no way to put it out
Just a wildfire spreading through my days and through my nights
Dont ask no question
Dont ever tell no lie
Im so tired of explaining
Every minor detail of my life

Were having fun in the daytime
Well chase the stars in he night time
And well catch the sun in the morning
We just dont care if they see us fall

Were having fun in the daytime
Well chase the stars in he night time
And well catch the sun in the morning
We just dont care if they see us fall
Just dont care
Just dont care at all
If it was true
