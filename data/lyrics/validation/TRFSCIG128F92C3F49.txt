Jackie Traynor says that she's never at home
'Cause when she's in she knows she's never alone
There'll always be somebody who's just hanging around
Waiting for a chance to start putting her down
Next time we'll have to do better

I gotta getta
I gotta getta
I gotta getta

Little Shamey hides in the front of a car
He never learned to drive; he knows it's too late now
He turns the ignition on and it's ready to start
As the car begins to move
He feels it falling apart
Next time we'll have to do better

I gotta getta
I gotta getta
I gotta getta

I gotta getta
I gotta getta
I gotta getta
I gotta getta
I gotta getta
I gotta getta
