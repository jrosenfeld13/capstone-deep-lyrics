Shadow woman
Leave my man alone
Let all of him belong to me
Haunt the other men you've known
Set him free, set him free, set him free

If you're thinking of his welfare, say fare well
Don't torture him with yester glow
Only you can break the spell
Let him go, let him go, let him go

Let him love me for me
The woman I am
Instead of one I not
I'm all the woman he should have
He's all the man I've got

When he looks at me
It's you he sees
It's you he wants to kiss I know
But I 'm a woman too, so please
Let him go, let him go, let him go
