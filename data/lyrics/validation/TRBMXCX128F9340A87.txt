John Hardy, he was a desperate little man
Strapped on his guns every day
Shot down the man on the West Virginia line
You oughta see John Hardy gettin' away
When he ran up to Virginia around the East Stone Bridge
Thought he would surely be free
And along came a Marshal with a gun in his hand
Said, "Johnny, hey, come along with me"
John Hardy, he had himself a little woman
The Dress she wore was blue
And she howled on out to Johnny as he rode out of town
Said, "Johnny, hey, I'll be true to you"
Now his legend had traveled from the East to the West
From the North to the South end of town
But when the sun comes up tomorrow they'll take John Hardy down
And show him to his hanging ground
They're gonna let John Hardy swing down
John Hardy, he was a desperate little man
Strapped on his guns every day
Shot down the man on the West Virginia line
You oughta see John Hardy gettin' away
You oughta see John Hardy gettin' away
