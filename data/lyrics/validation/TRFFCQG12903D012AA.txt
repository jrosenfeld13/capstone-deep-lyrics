There's a song in my soul for the sun going down
When it dies at the end of the day
With the sadness descending as soft as the sound
Of the life that was slipping away
The heavens above me seem empty and gray
As dreams that won't ever come true
Then the star-spangled glory of love fill the skies
And my heart with the wonder of you
Pretty berries I carry to you
Pretty flowers still hold in your hand
Pretty reasons for dreams coming true
And for doing the best that you can
I swear to be thankful the rest of my days
And worthy whatever I do
For the chance I was given to live and believe
In the love and the wonder of you
