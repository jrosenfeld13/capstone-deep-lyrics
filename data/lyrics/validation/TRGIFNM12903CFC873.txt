Beneath the stars there are the bars that serve the bitter drink
The barman smiles at me, his wife she gives a secret wink
They listen patiently to me, my story I unfold
I see their faces change, the lights go dim, I'm losing hold

I used to be a boy, my heart was young and supple then
But now it's stony cold, I'm old and I could use a friend
My world is not like yours, I come from somewhere long ago
But now there's no way back, I'm lost and feeling so alone

You can leave me in the air age if you like
But I'd dearly love to go back to my own time

Life in the air age
Isn't all the brochures say
Life in the air age
It's too dangerous to stay
Life in the air age
Airships crashing every day into the bay

Life in the air age
It's all highways in the sky
Life in the air age
All the oceans have run dry
Life in the air age
It's grim enough to make a robot cry
