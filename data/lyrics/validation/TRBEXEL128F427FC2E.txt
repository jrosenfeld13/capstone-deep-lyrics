In my heart, you're all I need
You are all I need...Need!

I feel like you're the only one
I feel what pain you kept me from
I feel so different from the way I used to be
Soul searching always my excuse
Didn't wanna face love, didn't know the truth
So clear to me now babe

You're all I need!
'Cus in my heart

Chorus
(In my heart you're all I need)
You're all I need
(You are all I need)
You're all I need
(In my heart you're all I need)
You're all I need
(You are all I need)
Need
You're all that I (Need)

Talking
I've nevernever felt like this

I feel like you're the only one
I feel this loneliness undone
And I just can't see myself
Without me in your arms (In your arms)
If I had one last sunset to see
One day, one last deep breath to breathe
No tears would fall, knowing that you're
All I need!

Chorus
(In my heart, you're all I need)
You're all I need(said You are all I need babe)
You're all I need(Yeah)
You're all I need(In my heart, you're all I need)
You're all I need(You are all I need)
You're all I need
You're all I need(In my heart, you're all I need)
You're all I need(Everything I need)
You're all I need(Never thought, never thought I would feel like I do)
....stay right here
You're all I need(In my heart, you're all I need)
You're all I need(You are all I need)
Need!

Repeat Chorus
