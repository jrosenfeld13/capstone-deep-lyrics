[Intro]
From up above the cloud to under the bridge
I'll always have a best friend in the city I live

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is this city I live in, this big rotten apple
As lonely as I am together we cry

[Verse 2]
I drive on her streets cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
Now I never worry, now that is a lie

[Chorus] x2
I don't ever wanna feel
Like I did that day
Take me to the place I love
Take me all the way

[Verse 3]
It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have her love, this city she loves me
Lonely as I am together we cry

[Chrous] x2

[Bridge 1]
Oh no yeah, yeah
Oh no now yeah, yeah
Oh no now yeah, yeah

[Verse 4]
From the highest to high, to the lowest of low
From the hottest of hot, to the coldest of cold
From the day we pop out, to the day we grow old
From the four track tapes to over 10 million sold
From the poorest of poor, to the richest of rich
Already told ya ass before that simple living's a bitch, biatch
From up above the clouds to under the bridge
I'll always have a best friend in the city I live

[Bridge 2] x3
The bridge is over, the bridge is over, pa da pa pa
The bridge is over, the bridge is over, ha ha

[Outro]
The bridge is over, the bridge is over
Oh no yeah, yeah
Oh no now yeah, yeah
Oh no now yeah, yeah
