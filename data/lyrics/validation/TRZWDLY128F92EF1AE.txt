Walk softly through the
Desert sands
Careful where you tread
Underfoot are the visions lost
Sleeping not yet dead

Hang on - Winds starting to howl
Hang on - The beast is on the prowl
Hang on - Can you hear the
Strange cry
Winds of change are blowing by

Mountains crumble and cities fall
Don't come to an end
Just lie scattered on the
Desert floor
Waiting for the wind

Hang on - Winds starting to howl
Hang on - The beast is on the prowl
Hang on - Can you hear the
Strange cry
Winds of change are blowing by

You got your life planned carefully
But you left out one detail
The hidden hand deals just one round
And the winds of change prevail

Hang on - Winds starting to howl
Hang on - The beast is on the prowl
Hang on - Can you hear the
Strange cry
Winds of change are blowing by

Walk softly through the desert sand
Old dreams lead the way
Nothing new in the sands of time
Just changes every day

Hang on - It's starting again
Hang on - There's no shelter from
The wind
Hang on - Like a fire from the sky
Winds of change are blowing by
