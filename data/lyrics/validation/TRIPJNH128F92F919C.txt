Theres a kind of man
That you sometimes meet
Worlds passing him by
On wing-ed feet
He walks around
With his senses numb
If you know him
Thats the kind of Man That I've Become

The kids all know him
'cause when they play
He comes and shoos
Them away
He's irritated
By everyone
If you know him
Thats the kind of Man That I've Become

The friends he had
Are 'so-called' now
They all slipped
Away somehow
He's had the blues
Much more than some
If you know him
Thats the kind of Man That I've Become

He won't go to church
Cause his faiths all gone
The sweet singing of the choir
Will only drive him home
As for comfort
He hasn't got a crumb
If you know him
Thats the kind of Man That I've Become

He won't go to church
Its too loud for him now
The sweet singing of the choir
Is nothing but a row
His hearts a prune
When it once was a plum
If you know him
Thats the kind of Man That I've Become

If you know him
Thats the kind of Man That I've Become
