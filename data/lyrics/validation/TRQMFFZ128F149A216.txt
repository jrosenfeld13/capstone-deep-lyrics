Oh that old Christmas moon
Hanging pretty all clear and white
As the snow falls so soft and white
The world awaits its Christmas Night

Santa's coming real soon
And the moonbeams will guide his sleigh
All the children are tucked away
'neath that old Christmas moon

And dreams will fly o'er the rooftops
So far up in the sky
We'll see the sights, the Christmas lights
Together, you and I

And that old Christmas moon
Shining softly on snow so white
As he brightens a special night
That old Christmas moon

Soft snow is silvery white
With moon glow shining so bright
It lights up this glorious night
It's that old Christmas moon

And dreams will fly o'er the rooftops
So far up in the sky
We'll see the sights, the Christmas lights
Together, you and I

And that old Christmas moon
Shining softly on snow so white
As he brightens a special night
That old Christmas moon
