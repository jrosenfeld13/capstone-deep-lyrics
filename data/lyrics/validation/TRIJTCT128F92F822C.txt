Unter Null
The Failure Epiphany
You Have Fallen From Grace
My final offer to you
Is one pound of flesh
One pound of sin
These deeds have gone unjustified
You entered forceful in my life
I've nothing more to offer
While
You take more and more and more
I can't face the day
You hid the sun
And everything is dark again
You broke my heart
Tore me apart
You broke me down
You broke me apart
You broke me down
I hope you rot
Oh, i hope you rot
I've nothing more to offer
While you take more, and more, and more..
