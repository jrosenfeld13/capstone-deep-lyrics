I, have always tried to find
A little place that I could get away for a while
And now I'm noticing that there's no clear frequencies, no empty space left on the dial

You just gotta make a little place for yourself
You just gotta take a little time for yourself
Here's to the life, that we always never wanted
And somehow we've forgotten the road we've traveled on
Here's to the life

I have to know that you're OK
And know that you're here to stay
To know this isn't a trial
And now, I take a breath to breathe
I turn around to leave, and get away for a while

You just gotta make a little place for yourself
You just gotta take a little time for yourself
Here's to the life, that we always never wanted
And somehow we've forgotten the road we've traveled on
Here's to the life

I'm so easy to forgive, except the way I live
And everything I do, and everything I do to you

You just gotta make a little place for yourself
You just gotta take a little time for yourself
Here's to the life, that we always never wanted
And somehow we've forgotten the road we've traveled on
Here's to the life
