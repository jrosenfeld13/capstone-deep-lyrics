I'm the same as I was when I was 6 years old
And oh, my God, I feel so old
I don't really feel anything
On a plane, I can see the tiny lights below
And oh, my God, they look so alone
Now, do they really feel anything?
Oh, my God, I gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta move on
Where do you move when what you're moving from
Is yourself?

The universe works on a math equation
That never, ever, ever really ends
Infinity spirals out creation on the tip of its tongue
And it is saying
"We ain't sure where you stand
You ain't machines, and you ain't land"
And the plants and the animals, they are linked
The plants and the animals eat each other

Well, oh, my God, and oh, my cat
I told my Dad what I need
Well, I know what I have and want
But I don't know what I need
"Well," he said, he said, he said, he said
"Where we're going, I'm dead"
