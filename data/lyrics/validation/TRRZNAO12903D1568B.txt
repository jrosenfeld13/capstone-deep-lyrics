[Verse 1]
I was a teenage anarchist, looking for a revolution
I had the style, I had the ambition
I read all the authors, I knew the right slogans
There was no war but the class war
I was ready to set the world on fire
I was a teenage anarchist, looking for a revolution

[Chorus]
Do you remember when you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?

[Verse 2]
I was a teenage anarchist, but the politics were too convenient
In the depths of their humanity all I saw was bloodless ideology
And with freedom as the doctrine, guess who was the new authority?
I was a teenage anarchist, but the politics were too convenient

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I was a teenage anarchist, but then the scene got too rigid
It was a mob mentality, they set their rifle sights on me
Narrow visions of autonomy, you want me to surrender my identity
I was a teenage anarchist, the revolution was a lie

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I was a teenage anarchist
