Martha's wearing blue jeans
And she's praying for the poor
Two midgets shop for Halloween
At a Salvation Army store
And a widow with a quarter
Buys herself a plastic ring
A little faith is a precious thing

Santa in December
The circus in July
The fat man he has mouths to feed
Just like you and I
And a family of agnostics
Attends a christening
A little faith is a precious thing

Tonight meet me at the graveyard
Up on Teaberry Hill
We'll lie upon the ground and dream
Where truth and superstition
Are just a reasoning away
And nothing is ever as it seems

Like a seed that grows
'Neath fallen leaves
She wouldn't let them keep her down
Left her parents home
Moved to the country
Now her children play in the backyard
Near where the cooling towers steam
A little known faith
A little known faith
A little known faith is a precious thing

[Silence for about 1 minute]
[Instrumental Interlude]

Construction got rained out today now baby
No one will know youre missing until four
Get your children off to school
Meet me by the in-ground pool
And wear that leather dress I like so well
To the Midway Motel
The Midway Motel
The Midway Motel

Shower always full of lead now baby
But theres a telephone and two twin beds for 37 bucks so
Wash your hair beneath the eaves
Ill push the beds together
Now lets have ourselves a little R&R as well
At the Midway Motel
The Midway Motel
The Midway Motel
The Midway Motel
The Midway

[Instrumental Bridge]
Carpet fresh and diesel fumes now baby
Mixed quite nice with your perfume now baby
And a couple staying next to here
Seems to have the same idea
I guess that everybody has a service they can sell
In the Midway Motel
The Midway Motel
The Midway Motel
The Midway Motel

Close the door sir and the key
Back at home by 3:15
Well I know that classic story not to tell
From the Midway Motel
Tell
Tell
