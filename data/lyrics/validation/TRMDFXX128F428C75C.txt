[Verse 1]
Like a blue bird with his heart removed, lonely as a train
I've run just as far as I can run
If I never see the good old days shining in the sun
I'll be doing fine and then some

[Chorus]
How long, how long
Woman will you weep
How long, how long
Rock yourself to sleep

[Verse 2]
Well, I've been doing time in lonesome prison, where the sun doesn't shine
Just outside, the freedom river runs
Out there in that shiny night, with blood hounds on your mind
Don't you know it's the same sad situation?

[Chorus]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Everybody feels alright you know, I heard some poor fool say (Somebody Ooh)
Everyone is out there on the loose
Well I wish I lived in the land of fools, no one knew my name
But what you get is not quite what you choose

[Chorus]

[Outro]
How long, how long (long and drawn out)
Muddy River runs so deep
How long, how long (long and drawn out)
Good night baby, rock yourself to sleep
Sleep tight baby, rock yourself to sleep
Bye bye baby, rock yourself to sleep
