Well, after all the tears and laughter
You and I've been through
How can you ask me what love is?
Love is a chain, just a chain reaction

Once you break it, you can't fake it
Once you wind it up, you can't unwind it
Once you lose it or misuse it
You can hunt forever and never find it

You come home broken
Like your soul is black and blue
And then you ask me what love is
Love is a chain, just a chain reaction

Once you break it, you can't fake it
Once you wind it up, you can't unwind it
Once you lose it or misuse it
You can hunt forever and never find it

Get some love in your groove
Just get hip to forgive
Are you tryin' to prove
That you can take more than give?

What good is your song
If it ain't in my key?
Loneliness makes you strong
Only love makes you free

Get some love in your groove
Just get hip to forgive
Are you tryin' to prove
That you can take more than give?

What good is your song
If it ain't in my key?
Loneliness makes you strong
Only love makes you free

Well, after all the tears and laughter
You and I've been through
How can you ask me what love is?
Love is a chain, just a chain reaction

Once you break it, you can't fake it
Once you wind it up, you can't unwind it
Once you lose it or misuse it
You can hunt forever and never find it

You come home broken
Like your soul is black and blue
And then you ask me what love is
Love is a chain, just a chain reaction

Once you break it, you can't fake it
Once you wind it up, you can't unwind it
Once you lose it or misuse it
You can hunt forever and never find it

Love is a chain
Love is a chain
Love is a chain
