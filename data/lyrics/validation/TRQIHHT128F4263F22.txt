Take all you can because soon
With hate my only tool
I'll be after you
And I don't like to lose

And I am the voice of your father
The closed door that scares you
I'm always there
I am bad dreams made real
I won't rest till
Time has swallowed you

Wherever you might stand
You'll fall into my hands
You're not a clever man
You don't stand a chance

And I am the voice of your father
The closed door that scares you
I'm always there
I am bad dreams made real
I won't rest till
Time has swallowed you

And I am the voice of your father
The closed door that scares you
I'm always there
I am bad dreams made real
I won't rest till
Time devours you
