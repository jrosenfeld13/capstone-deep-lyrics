Every village has to have an idiot
Some harmless monster to soak up all our fears
Ours hangs at the Hartsdale Cheesery
Writing down the license of every car he sees

Lots of stories how he got that way
No one knows where he goes at the end of the day
We threw rocks at him when we were nine
Stared us down with the pride of Frankenstein

Hes got the pride of Frankenstein

Sometimes I feel like that village idiot
A babbling fool that children should avoid
My smiles too wide, my shoes dont stay tied
I cant get a decent haircut to save my life

Baby its sad, baby its a fact
There are people with torches for people like that

This is a song for those who cant sing
I want to buy you all a diamond ring
And if those diamond rings dont shine
We can all share a jug of cheap red wine
And the pride of Frankenstein
