So you did it again
I guess you've done this before
You lay all your time and money
On the f*ckin' wrong horse
So you did it again
I guess you've done this before
A little kissin' and a lovin'
And your best judgement
Just lying on the floor
Just lying on the floor
So you did it once more
I guess you closed your eyes
Your heartbeat ringin' in your ears
Your fingers through his hair
Oh why oh why oh why
Oh why oh why yeah
