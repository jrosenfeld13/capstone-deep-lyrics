So tear out this bitter heart
Baby let the blood drip from your hands
This is all I have
Days to come
Wounds to heal
Wounds to heal
Like the blood red moon
That illuminates
Her deceiving eyes
Nothing could be more beautiful than a promise broken under a winter's night sky
Nothing could be more beautiful
I pray for floods to wash these bridges away
To pull me under and never let me go
I drown in you
Is it that easy to forget?
Is it that easy to let go?
So let the floods take me away
So tear out this bitter heart
Fallen for a promise
With a taste of deceit
And water filling my lungs
I say goodbye
As you turn and bid me farewell
You run your fingers across all my fears
And down my insecurites
So let the floods take me away
Let the frigid water fill the spot
Where my heart once was
Fallen for a promise
