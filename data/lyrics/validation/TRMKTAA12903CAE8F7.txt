9:00 AM in a sad elevator
It will be a long day before tonight
The neon lights seem stormy at the end
My face's so white, I'm feeling bad
And I can't understand, why

I'm seeing as a depressive minor
Or couldn't breathe the air and I ...
I try to tell me with my tear for hours
The friend I need is there for me
It's lighter in the dark
Oh, my friend is not the same
But I will rescue her from me

Yeah
