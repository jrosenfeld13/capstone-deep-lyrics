Sitting in a bar room
Must have gone past ten
Well I had the kind of day
I never want again
I got this gun
Pointing to my head
Gonna pull the trigger baby
Cos you want me dead

It's got so bad hey what ya doing to me
Everywhere I look what do I see

Woa woa woa
There she goes again ooh yeah
Woa woa woa
There she goes again

Nightime turns to morning
It's a cold but sunny day
I must have walked a million miles
To get this far away
I've been in every bar
In every town
No matter where I go you're there when I turn round

It's got so bad hey what ya doing to me
Everywhere I look what do I see

Woa woa woa
There she goes again ooh yeah
Woa woa woa
There she goes again

It's got so bad hey what ya doing to me
Everywhere I look
It's driving me out my mind
Can't you let me go
I don't really want ya baby
No No No

Woa woa woa
There she goes again ooh yeah
Woa woa woa
There she goes again
Woa woa woa
There she goes again
Woa woa woa
There she goes again...
