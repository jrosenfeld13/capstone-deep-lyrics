Your love it touches me
One kiss and I can't breath
One touch, I'm suffocating
Get me out I can't breath
Afflicted feelings I should hide
There was a thousand warnings
Thought this devotion I'd deny
I turn to things that haunt me

You're a disease
Sweet tasting rabies
You suck the life right out of me
Just set me free

I think of nothing all the time
Sometimes it's nothing but you
You shouldn't mean a thing to me
This shouldn't be
A stabbing pain stuck in my side
Not sure why I adore you
A strangled choking little cry
I would do all things for you

You're a disease
Sweet tasting rabies
You suck the life right out of me
Just set me free

Leave me be
Set me free
You're a disease
And you spread this on to me
