Theives and sweet things all come this way
Anyone is welcome until the break of day
Don't be caught with your nightie mussed and if you are questioned
Don't tell them
Don't tell them what we've discussed

I look under my bed no monsters are there
I still have hands and a head so it's been a good day
Been a good day so I say my prayers, I say my prayers
Don't rescue me, I'm fine right where I am...

I'm censor. I'm optic. I'm a lake at high noon, glittering ripple
Rip open cocoon
