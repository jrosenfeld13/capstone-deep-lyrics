Yes Adam was happy as a man could be
Till Eve started messin with that old apple tree
Ain't that just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman, theyll do it everytime
You can buy a woman clothes, give her money on the side
No matter what cha do shes never satisfied
Ain't that just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman, theyll do everytime

Marie Antoinette watched those cats at the gate
Then she cried in French, let em eat cake
Ain't that just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman, theyll do it everytime

Yes Adam was happy as a man could be
Till Eve started messin with that old apple tree
Ain't that just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman, they do it everytime

Yes you can buy a woman clothes, give her money on the side
No matter what cha do theyre never satisfied
Ain't that just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman
Ain't that just like a woman, theyll do everytime
