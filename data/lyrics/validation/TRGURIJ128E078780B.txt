[Verse 1]
Wash away the thoughts inside
That keep my mind away from you
No more love and no more pride
And thoughts are all I have to do

[Chorus]
Oooooo, remember when it rained
I felt the ground and looked up high and called your name
Oooooo, remember when it rained
In the darkness I remain

[Verse 2]
Tears of hope run down my skin
Tears for you that will not dry
They magnify the one within
And let the outside slowly die

[Chorus]
Oooooo, remember when it rained
I felt the ground and looked up high and called your name
Oooooo, remember when it rained
In the water I remain

Running down... (x7)

Ahhhhh ah ah ahhhhh ah na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Ohhhhh oh ah ohhhhh ah na na
Running dowwwwwn...
