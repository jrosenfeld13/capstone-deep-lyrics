I look at the world
And I see something different
There is a message that we've been missing

Life
It keeps going
The people not caring
Hatred of life
Is that what were sharing?

I've tried to undo this
But people won't listen
Cold politicians turn to ass-kissing
In foreign countries
We're always fighting
Vietnam again coming
The heat is igniting

What's going 'round?
Keeps going 'round and 'round
And 'round
What's going 'round
Keeps going 'round and 'round
And 'round

I see the preacher
And he's on the TV
I hate to say it
But he tried to pimp me
Asking for money
He says for the kingdom
I want to believe him
But I have no reason

He's in the paper
Misusing our money
Got caught in the bedroom
And not with his honey

People are dirty
So cold and so ruthless
The women that he's with
Now she wants to use it

What's going 'round?
Keeps going 'round and 'round
And 'round
What's going 'round
Keeps going 'round and 'round
And 'round

There is a wino
He's always drinking
Stoned in the alley
Dirty and stinking
People walk by him
But they never listen

There is a message that we've been missing
Folks always giving
And others are taking
Can't make a living high-rolling and faking
I don't understand why people are fronting
Material things ain't really nothing

What's going 'round?
Keeps going 'round and 'round
And 'round
What's going 'round
Keeps going 'round and 'round
And 'round
