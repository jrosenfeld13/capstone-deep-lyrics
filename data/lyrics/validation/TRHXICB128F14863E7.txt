Save, save yourself
Save your breath
Save, save a little hope for me
Take, take a rest
Take your time
Take, take the whole bottle of wine
Lay your head
Lay it down
Lay, lay yourself down on the ground

Stop me if I'm embarrassing myself
But I can let this slip away

Hey hey
What do you think about maybe
Staying around because lately
All I can think about's you

And you think
Could I be good for you
I think, what am I gonna do
All I know is I love being with you

Right, write the books
Right the wrongs
Right, write the little radio songs
See the light
See the signs
See in between the crooked lines

Help me if I'm embarrassing myself
I can't let this slip away

(Chorus x2)
