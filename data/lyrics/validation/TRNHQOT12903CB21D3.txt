Burn into darkness
The last unholy reject
Burn as the world ends
Stand accused and count this
Burn out the stigma
A murder done in portrait
Burn up the fortress
The last unholy reject

Papa oom mow mow
Papa oom mow

Burn as the angels
Worm into the fixes
Burn with the facts of
Optic dimension
Burn with the hero
Splashing on the highway
Burn like a cable
Strung across it sideways

Papa oom mow mow
Papa oom mow

Burn into darkness
The last unholy reject
Burn as the world ends
Stand accused and count this
Burn out the stigma
A murder done in portrait
Burn up the fortress
The last unholy reject

Papa oom mow mow
Papa oom mow
