It is now that my head is spinning, and the thought
Leaves no question, but an answer

If it would ever come to mind
That I could rise above the highest tree
And frolic around that beauty
I would take that opportunity
Faster than one's healthy pulse
F-F-Faster than one's healthy pulse
Faster, yeah!

Re-doing things that were on the side of the road
When we passed them for the first time
Was a mistake I take credit for

Seeing these things, in front of my eyes
With all clarity, is the key to a lesson learned
[x2]

Re-doing things that were on the side of the road
When we passed them for the first time
Was a mistake I take credit for

Climbing this tree, of answers is only
Easily done, with an open mind
[x2]

Re-doing things that were on the side of the road
When we passed them for the first time
Was a mistake I take credit for

I stand next to the window, with the view of a sun
I see a beautiful tree with a duplication of each leaf
These are the shadows, I'm not a shadow
Lightworker, Lightworker, yeah
Lightworker, Lightworker
Lightworker, Lightworker, yeah
Lightworker, Lightworker
