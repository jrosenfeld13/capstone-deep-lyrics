I'm gonna be gettin up so early in the morning
I believe I'll dust my broom
I'm gonna be gettin up so early in the morning
I believe I'll dust my broom
Well my best gal, I'll be lovin
Now my friends can get my room

I'm gonna write a letter, gonna call every town I know
I'm gonna write a letter, telephone every town I know
If I don't find her in Mississippi
She be in East Monroe I know

And I don't want no woman
Want every downtown man she meets
No I don't want no woman
Want every downtown man she meets
Man, she's a no good doney
They shouldn't allow her on the street, yeah

I believe, I believe my time ain't long
I believe, I believe my time ain't long
I ain't gonna leave my baby
And break up my happy home
