I was young I was just a boy when you told me dreams really do come true
But I wanted something different I always wanted something different than this
Now I've grown and I found out that what you want you've got to take for yourself
But I search in the wrong places I always search in the wrong places for them

Speak loud but you never want to listen Scream out for everything you're missing
You want it all but you never want to work for it

If love is just a lyric we all sing along to bite your tongue do as you are told
To make it easier for you to write this down When time is running out why won't you say it?

This sort of thing it happens all the time so you close your eyes, pretend that things are fine just like everything is perfect, just right
Things have changed and I'm on my own And I thank the Lord I wound up alone
Because it makes me sick to see this It really makes me sick to see you like this

Call it what you like but just leave us out of it
This new change, it's for yourself
So take back what you said You're not fooling anyone
Your new life will find us well When you're all by yourself
It's too late
