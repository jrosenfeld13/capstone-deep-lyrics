I know how you feel
I'm feeling it, too
I hold my heart, I dream of you
I see your face, I feel it, too
Searching skies
I need you
I miss you

Take this and hold
My love for you
In separate times we think as two
In paradise I'll drown in you
Still searching skies
I need you
I want you

I know how you feel
I'm feeling it to
I hold my heart, I dream of you
I see your face, I feel it, too
Searching skies
I need you
I miss you

Take this and hold
My love for you
In separate times we think as two
In paradise I'll drown in you
Still searching skies
I need you
I want you

I love you, love you, I love only you...love you

Remember me near
There may be times when it's not right
For me to be there
But remember me near
Remember me near
There may be times when it's not right
For me to be there
But remember me near

Searching for strength
Can I face this day
Blinded by your love we stay
You're always there
You're in my head
Still chasing skies
I need you
Oh, I miss you

Just love you, only you, only you...

I love you, I love you, I love only you...love you

Remember me near
There may be times when it's not right
For me to be there
But remember me near
Remember me near
There may be times when it's not right
For me to be there
But remember me near
