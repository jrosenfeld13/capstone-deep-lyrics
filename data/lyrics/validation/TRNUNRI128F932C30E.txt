The company you keep
Is keeping me asleep inside my bed
Make me wishing
I was somewhere else instead

It was original
It was original thought, oh oh
You wanted something so bad
Then you killed the very thing that you got

It was so typical
It was a typical shame, oh oh
From a father to a son
And nobody could recall the name

You cried no, no, no, no
Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win
I wanna drink until I'm broken
Then just see what kind of shit we get in

I cried no, no, no, no
You gotta put up a fight, all right
If the freedom doesn't kill you
Well then man, I think the politics might

Now play it for me

I cried no, no, no, no
You gotta put up a fight
If the freedom doesn't kill you
Well then man, I think the politics might

It was original
It was original thought, oh oh
You wanted something so bad
Then you killed the very thing that you got

You wanted something so bad
Then you killed the very thing that you got
