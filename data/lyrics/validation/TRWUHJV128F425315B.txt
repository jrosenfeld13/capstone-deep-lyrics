See her laughing, talking as she's walking to the factory
She don't look that much
But I tell you, she's a ticket to the easy life for me

If she works nine to five
Sure to keep my love alive
If she works nine to five
That's okay with me

Hey, I'm in love with the working girl
Hey, I'm in love with the working girl

I walk up to her
Tell her how we must have been made for each other
And I'd take her home
Why, I'd even take her 'round for tea with my mother

Then she can go out to work and I'd
Lie around the house in the dirt and
She could go out to work
Bring her money home for me

Hey, I'm in love with the working girl
Hey, I'm in love with the working girl

(Working girl)
We got a love so pure
(Working girl)
She pays the rent
(Working girl)
Once in a lifetime chance in her
(Working girl)
Must be heaven-sent

Hey, I'm in love with the working girl
Hey, I'm in love with the working girl

We go out at night
She can buy all the drinks with the money she's earned
I dazzle her with science
And grace her with all this truth and knowledge I've learned

Then we can come back to her place
I'd put on my "hate to borrow money" face
We get a cab to her place
She'd do alright by me

Hey, I'm in love with the working girl
Hey, I'm in love with the working girl
Hey, I'm in love with the working girl
Hey, I'm in love with the working girl

Hey, I'm in love with the working girl
Hey, I'm in love with the working girl
Hey, I'm in love with the working girl
Hey, I'm in love with the working girl
