Well I let down Virginia
When I told her I was bound for leaving
I told her that the city air
Just werent worth my breathing
Then I packed my bags and left her
On her own;
Moving sad and slowly
Down the San Antone
And Im never gonna set foot in her house again

I never said Id leave her
But I never said that I would stay
And I dont mean to deceive her
But she knows it has to be this way
So walk outside and take a ride
And dont look back
Ill be far away by Monday baby
Ill be down the track
And Im never gonna step foot in her house again

She says it dont come easy;
There aint no luck for free
But theres nothing left around here
But a pale blue Monday morning me

Im getting on my knees lord
Hoping just to speak with you
Im getting on my knees lord
I know that Virginia is too
Oh but Id never thought Id feel this bad
About the past
Hearts and souls were never
Ever built to last
And Im never gonna step foot in her house again

Im sitting at the station
Hanging my head down low
Dont want no confrontations
But I dont know which way to go
And I wish to God Id see her face just
One more time
But I got to be moving on and on the line

And Im never gonna step foot in her house again...
