[Verse 1]
Sitting in my bedroom late last night
Got into bed and turned out the light
Decided to call my baby on the telephone
All I got was an engaged tone

[Chorus]
It is off the hook[x5]

[Verse 2]
Talking so long she upset my mind
Why is she talking such a long time?
Maybe she is sleeping, maybe she is ill
Phone is disconnected, unpaid bill

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Do not want to see her, afraid of what I would find
Tired of letting her upset me all the time
Back into bed started reading my books
Take my phone right off of the hook

[Chorus]
