[Intro: Bliss (Eso)]
Oh yeah (we gon' teach 'em how to walk on clouds)
Still Bliss, uh huh (it's been a long time coming)
It's still Bliss

[Verse 1: Bliss]
I still sit with the owls and peer through a spying scope
Rhyming dope perched high on a giant oak
So, let me take you on my flight
B.E.I. bright in my eyesight
The symbol lit up in the Syd' city twilight
So I spread my wings high over the nightlife
I smell the sea salt freshly in the harbour
I feel the breeze blow gently on my armour
...
It's the flow flipper, the free-form flavour
With the M-Phazer, the beat norm breaker
So if it's time to unwind and just let go
Yo, let me get a "oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, yes bro!"
And when I fly in, show me how you get loud
The catapult kid came to blow this shit down
Got the spare parts, bought an old radiator
Built a spaceship with phrase, audio aviator

[Hook]
So when the whole world sleeps, I'm wide awake
Through the push and shove, I'ma fly away
With the sun in my scope I'ma find a way
To walk on clouds when the skies are grey
So when the whole world sleeps, I'm wide awake
Through the push and shove, I'ma fly away
With the sun in my scope I'ma find a way
To walk on clouds when the skies are grey

[Verse 2: Eso]
One two, one two, we're back at it again
The renegade razor blade when I'm packing a pen
Put away them toys, I don't play that junk
Simply cause my mother didn't raise no punk
So colour me bad when I walk in my room
With a spliff and a pain-filled water balloon
And speaking on spliffs, pass that shit round
Cause I'm known for hitting that BITCH like Chris Brown!
Say get down! Shake, rattle and roll
The crowd is shitfaced and out of control
Say get back! They better make some room
Cause your man Mac is back and I just ate some shrooms
That's the naked truth and I'ma fucking raise the roof
I do the drunken river dance, my fucking favourite move
And if life's a beach, then I breathe with it happily
Cause just like that I turn dreams to reality

[Hook]
So when the whole world sleeps, I'm wide awake
Through the push and shove, I'ma fly away
With the sun in my scope I'ma find a way
To walk on clouds when the skies are grey
So when the whole world sleeps, I'm wide awake
Through the push and shove, I'ma fly away
With the sun in my scope I'ma find a way
To walk on clouds when the skies are grey

[Verse 3: Eso & Bliss]
Yeah, this is how we chill for real
We marinate and meditate on wheels of steel
B.E.I. twenty-eight that number
That got me swinging swords like the Black Mamba
In a dump-truck, bumping old Wu
So you know what shit I'm on when I roll through
This is soul food, peep the recipe
It's no riddle, M-Phizzle got remedy
At school, I wasn't that weed-crop cool smoker
I was that bush-bashing beat box bulldozer
Without a map man I grew from the lemon grove
And tippy-toed over lily pad stepping stones
The runaway crew, cool like the summer rain
The tornado tires, superhuman hurricane
Spun around my island like we circle the sun's fear
Made our own ground swell, surfing the frontier

[Hook: 2X]
