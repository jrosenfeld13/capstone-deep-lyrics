It will never be ok
No, they
Violated you
I have to make them pay
Something primal, something strong
Can't escape
And those who did you wrong
I hunt like prey

And it burns inside
The need to kill - I'm driven by
The crimson tide
Meet my demon, meet my Hyde

I was the only one who knew
Who held you
The system doesn't hear
Nobody will listen to
I will see that they all know
What you felt
And I just hate them so
Hate them, I hate

And it burns inside
The need to kill - I'm driven by
The crimson tide
Meet my demon, meet my Hyde

And it burns inside (I burn alive)
The need to kill - I'm driven by
The crimson tide (the falling sky)
Meet my demon, meet my Hyde

For the sum of the hurt
And for the hauntings in the night
They suffer this fairly
As they lie in the dirt
Begging, pleading for their lives
I cover them slowly

And it burns inside (I burn alive)
The need to kill - I'm driven by
The crimson tide (the falling sky)
Meet my demon, meet my Hyde

And it burns inside (I burn alive)
The need to kill - I'm driven by
The crimson tide
Meet my demon, meet my Hyde

(And it burns inside)
(The crimson tide)

And it burns inside (I burn alive)
The need to kill - I'm driven by
The crimson tide (the falling sky)
Meet my demon, meet my Hyde
