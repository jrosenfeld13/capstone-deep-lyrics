Are you gone, where you going?
Are you going where you going when you set
Out to meet her out to meet her
By the river by the bank in yr head
And I know Ive got a feeling
Its just a feeling but I had it when I said
I could see her getting closer
Getting closer but its probably in yr head

Are you soaked to the bone
Youve got me walking in a straight line
Love line life line all the way home

Ive got a car, you can drive it
You can take it into town any time
That you wanna if you want to
You can take it into town any time
I got a name got a number
She dont wanna but its all the same to me
Ive got a driver got a number
You can take me into town any time

Are you riding for a fall
You got me walking in a straight line
Long time last time any time at all

Are you gonna turn it on
You got me walking in a straight line
Long time last time any time you want]
Long time last time any time you want
Yeah long time last time any time you want
Yeah long time last time any time you want
