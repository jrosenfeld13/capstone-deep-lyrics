Tell me, tell me I'm your man there's a need inside of me for love and understanding standing at your door and
Feeling in trouble
Don't turn away, baby I'm your man

Hold me, hold me until I smile I need to feel the touch of your hand, if only for a little while once upon a time
We made a promise
Don't turn away, baby I'm your man

All that love, when love was new we held our hearts in each other's hands I gotta love that flows with the
Seasons baby I'm your man

Kiss me, kiss me a long, long time I need to feel your lips pressing up close to mine once upon a time we made a
Promise
Don't turn away, cuz baby I'm your man

All that love, when love was new we held our hearts in each other's hands I gotta love that flows with the
Seasons
Baby I'm your man

Tell me, tell me I'm your man
There's a need inside of me for love and understanding standing at your door and feeling in trouble
Don't turn away, baby I'm your man
Ooh baby, I'm your man
