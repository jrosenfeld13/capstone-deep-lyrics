It's a dying ember
You can barely feel it
You can hardly see it
When the wind blows
And you can't remember
If it was the first time
Or if it was the last time
You still don't know
We keep waitin'
We keep waitin' so long
For you to some back home
Come back home
You keep fadin'
You keep fadin' away
Like nameless faces from yesterday
Yesterday
You couldn't wait any longer
Was there something else to find
Would ya give me some peace of mind
Or let me go
And now you can't remember
If it was the first time
Or if it was the last time
Well now you know
And we keep waitin'
We keep waitin' so long
For you to come back home
Come back home
And you keep fadin'
You keep fadin' away
Like nameless faces from yesterday
Yesterday
(yesterday)
Yeah we've been waitin'
We've been waitin' so long
For you to come back home
We've been waitin'
We've been waitin' so long
For you to come back home
Come back home
Come back home
You keep fadin'
You keep fadin' away
Like nameless faces from yesterday
