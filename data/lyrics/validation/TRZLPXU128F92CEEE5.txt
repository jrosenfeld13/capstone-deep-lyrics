Friends I have to tell you
They sent me on a mission
Down to earth
To watch and to observe life
And gather information 'bout
Your birth

But what I mostly see is misery
And it makes me sad

So capable of love yet
Too scarred to open up and
Just wanna be accepted
But can't show that you care
Creating problems daily
No wonder some go crazy
So special and so gifted
But most don't know it's there

Friends I have to ask you
Surrounded by the beauty
Of this place
Why do you make it so hard
For all the things you want
To come your way

Well I don't think you see
Your destiny
And it makes me sad

So capable of love yet
Too scared to open up and
Just wanna be accepted
But can't show that you care
Creating problems daily
No wonder some go crazy
So special and so gifted
But most don't know it's there

Do it just let it all out
Express emotion
Say how you're feeling
It's liberating
Nothing can hurt you
You can be happy
But, you must believe it
(believe it)

Well I don't think you see
Your destiny
And it makes me sad

So capable of love yet
Too scared to open up and
Just wanna be accepted
But can't show that you care
Creating problems daily
No wonder some go crazy
So special and so gifted
But most don't know it's there
So capable of love yet
Too scared to open up and
Just wanna be accepted
But can't show that you care
Creating problems daily
No wonder some go crazy
So special and so gifted
But most don't know it's there

Won't you let me take you
Down to earth
