We'll keep on talking this out
But i've already made up your mind
I've been trying to gnaw through my tongue
To stop from confessing my crimes

And these conversations are wearing me down
What did my patience prove
If it's just another bed of nails
Always the silent treatment
Always the easy way out alive

If there's no further questions i'll be on my way home

And it's just another sharp pain
And it doesn't hurt like it used to
When i was a desperate man
When i still believed in the meaning of the word

You tried to warn me
You and your consequences
If i
Am outnumbered
If i
Am defenseless
If i come here unarmed
In the middle of the night on my own
Standing on the front lines i will die

If you invite me down
If it'll please the crowd
I only go through this for your amusement
But it doesn't hurt like should when you're throwing your stones around

Now i'm alone
Trying to sleep it off

But it's hard not to shake at the sound of it breaking
When you're living in a house of mirrors reflecting all of my failure
I will concede to my replacement
Congratulations

It's over and over again

I was in for the long run when you cut me down
Another sharp pain
A servant to your throne

Always the silent treatment
Always the stubborn child
I kept my mouth shut tight

Always the one that got away
Always the silent treatment
I only have myself to blame

Always the silent treatment
Always the bed of nails
I only have myself to blame

I only have myself to blame
