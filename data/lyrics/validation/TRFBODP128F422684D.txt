GO AHEAD AND WAIT
 Krista Detor, Cover Their Eyes

Look at all the blue sky, look at all that blue air
Hanging on the hills there, waiting for a cloud to come round
Look at all the blue sky, like a babys painting
Mr. Sunshine smiling, sunny rays streaming down to the ground

But today, theres not too much sorrow
So Ill go ahead and wait, but Ill probably end it all tomorrow

Listen to the wind blow, just the way I like it
A little winter in it, a little winter chill if you will
Listen to the wind blow, all the singing branches
Birds taking their chances, but they wont blow away, not today

Not today, theres not too much sorrow
So Ill go ahead and wait, but Ill probably end it all tomorrow

BR:
Pretty red leaves on the side of the road and the brown and orange hue
And Im thinking of you
Old pair of shoes on the side of the road and your toes were poking through
And what did I do? What did I do?

Look at all the blue sky, look at all that blue air
Hanging on the hills there, waiting for the snow
Listen to the birds sing songs about their lovers
And all of the others, they do come and go, dont you know

But today, theres only just a little sorrow
So Ill go ahead and wait, but Ill probably end it all tomorrow

Any day, theres only just a little sorrow
So Ill go ahead and wait, but Ill probably end it all tomorrow
