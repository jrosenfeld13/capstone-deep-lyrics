Ooh, let me take a candle to a cellar tonight
I'd like to take some matches there and set it alight
I can, cos I've seen those kind of places before
Ooh, I'd like to have a party in a cellar tonight
And I'd love to have a party but it wouldn't be right
I shan't, cos I've seen those kind of people before

I won the war in the sitting room
I won the war but it cost me
I won the war and I feel proud
But I don't know why it's hard to get to sleep in my house

Ooh, I have to pull the blankets up to cover my head
And I have to pull the blankets right up
But I don't know why it's hard to get to sleep in my house

Well you keep following the feel of fire
It's not difficult to see that you're
Young and selfish, but liberty and money
Don't go

Let me take a candle to a cellar tonight
Yeah, you should see the parties we've had before
Give me the time, give me the time
Give me your watchword, give me whatever you like

I won the war in the sitting room
I won the war but it cost me
I won the war and I feel proud
But God only knows why it's hard to get to sleep in my house

Ooh, your supercilious smile
Ooh, your supercilious smile

Well you keep following the feel of fire
It's not difficult to see that you're
Beautiful and young, and critical of nothing
And you keep following the feel of fire
It's not difficult to see that you're
Beautiful and young, but liberty and money
Don't go
