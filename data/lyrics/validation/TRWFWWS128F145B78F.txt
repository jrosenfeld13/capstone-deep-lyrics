[Verse 1]
What do you think they would say
If I stood up, and I walked away?
Nobody here really understands me
And so I wave goodbye, I'm fine
I'm fine

[Chorus]
Tones of home
Said, you don't like the way I'm living (You don't like me)
Tones of home, tones of home
(And so I wave) goodbye
I'm flyin'
And I'm flyin' home
Home, home, home

[Verse 2]
And I always thought this would be
See, the land of milk and honey
Oh, but I come to find out that it's all hate and money
And there's a canopy of greed holdin' me down

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
See, I'm so high to you, but don't fade away, oh yeah
I said, you're on your own
Your mom and daddy said
That you sister said
And you brother's saying (what'd your brother say?)
Is saying everybody (everybody)
Is saying everybody
Is saying I-I-I-I gotta go!

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
All my friends patronize me
They say "Yo, hey, boy! Have you found what you're looking for?"
It seems they don't really know me
'Cause it's here
An' it's what they can't see

[Chorus]
