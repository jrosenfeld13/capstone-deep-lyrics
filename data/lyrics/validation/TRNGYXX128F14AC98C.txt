Someday
You will hear me sing a love song
One day
I'll find a girl to call my own

Bringing it all together
Doing it on my own
Walking hand-in-hand like lovers
And if you wished upon the moon
Then it may be one day soon

Sunday (Sunday)
Monday (Monday)
Tuesday (Tuesday)
Is pizza day
Pizza day

Bringing it all together (bringing it all together)
Doing it on my own (doing it on my own)
Walking hand-in-hand like lovers (walking hand-in-hand like lovers)
And if you wished upon the moon
Then it may be one day soon
