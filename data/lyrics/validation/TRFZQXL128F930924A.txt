[Verse 1]
Calling out your name
Your face is everywhere
I'm reaching out to you
To find that you're not there
I wake up every night to see the state I'm in
It's like an endless fight I never seem to win

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't go on as long as I believe
Can't let go when I keep wondering

[Chorus]
Where are you now, what have you found?
Where is your heart when I'm not around?
Where are you now? You got to let me know
Oh, baby, so I can let you go

[Verse 2]
I can hear your voice
The ring of yesterday
It seems so close to me
But yet so far away
I should let it out
To save what's left of me
And close the doors of doubt
Revive my dignity, but

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't go on as long as I believe (as long as I believe)
Can't let go when I keep wondering

[Chorus]
Where are you now, what have you found?
Where is your heart when I'm not around?
Where are you now? You got to let me know
Oh, baby, so I can let you go

[Bridge]
I should let it out, it's time to let you go
Oh, baby, I just wanna know

[Chorus]
Where are you now, what have you found?
Where is your heart when I'm not around?
Where are you now? You gotta let me know
Oh, baby, so I can let you go
Where are you now, what have you found?
Where is your heart when I'm not around?
Where are you now? You gotta let me know
Oh, baby, so I can let you go
