You got me one more time on the telephone
I had a hard time making the call
What you're dying about is drying me out
And what is coming is taking control

After you laid off
Your medication
I feel hungover
Cut the connection

I
Got no reason to communicate
I
Got no reason to communicate
Know where your story goes
Nowhere but down below
Ain't complaining

Anything near you
Worth the attention
I cut the cord off my telephone
You're not wasting my precious time
What your on about is just wearing me out
And I've been
Trying for too long
I've been trying for too long

Got no reason to communicate
I
Got no reason to communicate
Know where your story goes
Nowhere but down below
Ain't complaining
Ain't complaining

I
Got no reason to communicate
I
Got no reason to communicate
Know where your story goes
Nowhere but down below
Ain't complaining
Ain't complaining
