Lord, I must confide
This world, it makes me tired
Please help me keep my eyes on You today
When everything feels wrong
I step back into the light
Where I belong
And everything's alright
And I sing this song
Jesus, I love You

'Cause everything has changed
Ever since the day
You came into my heart and made me Yours
Everyday I'll say, in in every way
I am Yours today

And when Your love collides
I find that I'm defined
Please help me learn to die in You today
When everything feels wrong
I step back into the light
Where I belong
And everything's alright
And I sing this song
Jesus, I love You

'Cause everything has changed
Ever since the day
You came into my heart and made me Yours
Everyday I'll say, in in every way
I am Yours today

I am Yours today
