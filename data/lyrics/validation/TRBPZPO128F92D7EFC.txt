In between the black and white
Where concentration cant be held
Confusing in grey haze
Endless fleeting visions are
Wasted in this
No mans land

More than six and a half
Sevens to far, youre running to far
Its somewhere in between
Here lie three numbers unlocking
Secrets untold
A crescendo of whispers
Sing softly to our ears

Our futures born in black or white
Or six or seven, left or right
Gaze trough the gray haze
A clue in a mask shows your vague
Fragments of
Alternate endings

More than six and a half
Sevens to far, youre running to far
Its somewhere in between
Here lie three numbers unlocking
Secrets untold
A crescendo of whispers
Sing softly to our ears

...Sing softly to our ears

In between the black and white
Where concentration cant be held
Confusing in grey haze
Endless fleeting visions are
Wasted in this
No mans land

More than six and a half
Sevens to far, youre running to far
Its somewhere in between
Here lie three numbers unlocking
Secrets untold
A crescendo of whispers
Sing softly to our ears
