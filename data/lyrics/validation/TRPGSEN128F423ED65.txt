Down in the depths
Hidden from sight
My secret identity

And there's a big black dog
Yes a raging canine
Running blind at nothing
Running blind at nothing

Into the valley with a secret sin
Up the stairs with a friend called Jimmy
Walking like ghosts in a sea of tin
Moving it up with a friend called Jimmy

Oh, such a happy boy today
Blew my family clear away
(I'm) going to university
What do you think now?
Such a happy boy today
Listen to the people say
"Joy of joys, oh happy day"

Look up in the air
There behind a cloud
My dream and desire

And there's a weather man
He's got his cap in his hand
He says he understands
He says he understands

Something happened in the world today
Up the stairs with a friend called Jimmy
I want to live like the folks in the bay
I'm moving it up with a friend called Jimmy

Oh, such a happy boy today
Blew my family clear away
(I'm) going to university
What do you think now?
Such a happy boy today
Listen to the people say
"Joy of joys, oh happy day"

Something happened in the world today
Up the stairs with a friend called Jimmy
I want to live like the folks in the bay
I'm moving it up with a friend called Jimmy

Oh, such a happy boy today
Blew my family clear away
(I'm) going to university
What do you think now?
Such a happy boy today
Listen to the people say
"Joy of joys, oh happy day"

Such a happy boy today
Such a happy boy today
