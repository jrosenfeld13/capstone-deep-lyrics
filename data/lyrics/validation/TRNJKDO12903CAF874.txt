Ooh, can't you see
The days are rollin' by
The things I read about the world outside
Don't seem to matter now you're here tonight
Hold me, love's callin', hold me if you can
The world just keeps on turning
It don't mean a thing to me
Long as I'm with you, babe
There's nothin' that I need
World just keeps on turning
But your lovin' stays the same
Long as I got you, babe
The world can roll away
Ooh, can you feel it
Now we're a million miles away
The world looks oh so small from up here, baby
And that's the way it's gonna stay
Hold on, love's callin', hold on if you can
The world just keeps turning
Don't mean a thing to me
Long as I'm with you, babe
There's nothin' that I need
World just keeps on turning
But your lovin' stays the same
Long as I got you, babe
The world can roll away

Oh, it's you and me, baby
Lost in our lovin' dreams
No one to tell us what we should or shouldn't do
This time life is more than it seems
Hold on, love's callin', hold on if you can

World just keeps on turning
Don't mean a thing to me
Long as I'm with you, babe
There's nothin' that I need
The world just keeps on turning
But your loving stays the same
Long as I got you, babe
World can roll away
Because the world
Just keeps on turning'
The world just keeps on turnin'
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
