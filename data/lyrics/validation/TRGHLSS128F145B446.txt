Nobody ever moved me
Did the things that you're doing to me
I see you, and that's all it takes
For you to make me crazy
I only wanted to touch you, baby
And I never meant to stay
I know

I better get a hold of my heart
Before I lose my head
Before I go too far
I gotta get a hold of my heart
Before you change my mind
And get me on my knees
I better get out while I can

Get a hold of my heart

Never thought I'd get this deep now
Ooh, and I can't get free now
No, I just can't find a way
'Cause you love me senseless
Ooh, and my heart is helpless
When you're touching me this way
I know

I better get a hold of my heart
Before I lose my head
Before I go too far
I gotta get a hold of my heart
Before you change my mind
And get me on my knees
I better get out while I can

Get a hold of my heart

And every time I see you
I see how much I need you
And when you're here beside me, baby
I know

I better get a hold of my heart
Before I lose my head
Before I go too far
I gotta get a hold of my heart
Before you change my mind
And get me on my knees
I better get out while I can

Get a hold of my heart
