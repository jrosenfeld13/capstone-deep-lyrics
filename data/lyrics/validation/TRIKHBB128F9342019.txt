Whoa, whoa, whoa
Follow me to your own demise and just drink this poison down
I'll make an offer you can't refuse, the devils coming to town
I'll steer you wrong and let you know that all that glitters gold
So won't you let me have your soul, if I could be so bold

I turn off all the lights, it's better
Everything goes black, well everything goes black

I'm bad, it's true
There's a little bit of me in everyone of you
Well, I'm bad, it's true

You can say that I'm the devil
And there's nothing you can do about it
Nothing you can do cause I'm bad

Sucked the life right out of you, you were once so alive
Rotting, stinking, wilted rose, completely paralyzed
Destruction is in high gear and your heart is what I sell
Now pack your bags, we're leaving here I'm taking you to hell

I turn off all the lights, it's better
Everything goes black, well everything goes black

I'm bad, it's true
There's a little bit of me in everyone of you
Well, I'm bad, it's true
You can say that I'm the devil
And there's nothing you can do about it

'Cause I'm bad, it's true
There's a little bit of me in everyone of you
Fucking bad, it's true

You can say that I'm the devil
And there's nothing you can do about it
Nothing you can do 'cause I'm bad

[Unverified]
The sweetest taste of death
On your lips from the start

I'm bad, it's true
There's a little bit of me in everyone of you
Well, I'm bad, it's true
You can say that I'm the devil
And there's nothing you can do about it

'Cause I'm bad, it's true
There's a little bit of me in everyone of you
Fucking bad, it's true
You can say that I'm the devil
And there's nothing you can do about it
Nothing you can do cause I'm bad

Whoa, whoa, whoa
