Up along the hallway
Down along the stairs
I can see the pictures
We made down through the years
And it makes me blue, darling
Thinking of the past
And I'm truly sorry
I couldn't make it last

Walk the way the wind blows
Cry the tears I cried
Hoping for you, darling
To be here by my side
I got to do some thinking
Of where to go from here
Walk the way the wind blows
Wipe away the tears

I remember, darling
When you first came to me
All the air was sweet then
And all our time was free
But like the leaves that wither
Our hearts fell away
I think I'll just go out alone
And walk my blues away

Walk the way the wind blows
Cry the tears I cried
Hoping for you, darling
To be here by my side
I got to do some thinking
Of where to go from here
Walk the way the wind blows
Wipe away the tears

Walk the way the wind blows
Cry the tears I cried
Hoping for you, darling
To be here by my side
I got to do some thinking
Of where to go from here
Walk the way the wind blows
Wipe away the tears
Walk the way the wind blows
Wipe away the tears
