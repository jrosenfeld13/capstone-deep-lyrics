[Verse 1]
I'm [?] in the shapes again
Because I know
Well it's just the way that I let go-ah

Everything's so overblown
Ringing in my ears
Well you made your choice you made it clear

[Chorus]
One day
I wanna tell ya
Two things
I might mail ya
Three things
Check it out, yeah

One day
I wanna tell ya
Two things
I might mail ya
Three things
Check it out, yeah
(Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I'm sick of your attitude
So self-absorbed
Well I try to push you but you never [?]
All the watches that you carry around
They're keeping time
Well the time has come and I think it's mine

[Chorus]
One day
I wanna tell ya
Two things
I might mail ya
Three things
Check it out, yeah

One day
I wanna tell ya
Two things
I might mail ya
Three things
Check it out, yeah

[Interlude]
Well it's all I got
It's all I got
Well I shouldn't enjoy your regretting
Well it's all I got
[?]
Well it's just the song that I've been singing
Just the song that I've been singing

[Chorus]
One day
I wanna tell ya
Two things
I might mail ya
Three things
Check it out, yeah

One day
I wanna tell ya
Two things
I might mail ya
Three things
Check it out, yeah

[Outro]
(I don't care)
One thing
(I don't care)
Two things
(I don't care)
Three things

(I don't care)
One thing
(I don't care)
Two things
(I don't care)
Three things
