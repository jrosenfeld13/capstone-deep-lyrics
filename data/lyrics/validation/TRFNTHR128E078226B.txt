[Verse 1]
Off the rails I was and
Off the rails
I was happy to stay
Get out of my way
On the rack I was
Easy meat, and a reasonably good buy
A reasonably good buy

[Chorus 1]
The Piccadilly Palare
Was just silly slang
Between me and the boys in my gang
"So bona to vada, oh you
Your lovely eek and
Your lovely riah"

[Verse 2]
We plied an ancient trade
Where we threw all life's
Instructions away
Exchanging lies and digs (my way)
'Cause in a belted coat
Oh, I secretly knew
That I hadn't a clue

(No, no. No, no, no. You can't get there that way. Follow me...)

[Chorus 2]
The Piccadilly Palare
Was just silly slang
Between me and the boys in my gang
Exchanging Palare
You wouldn't understand
Good sons like you
Never do

[Chorus 2 - Extended (Remastered version only)]
A cold-water room
Its not much, I know
But for now its where I belong
Am I really doing wrong?
Around the center of town
Is where I belong
Am I really doing wrong?

[Verse 3]
So why do you smile
When you think about Earl's Court ?
But you cry when you think of all
The battles you've fought and lost
It may all end tomorrow
Or it could go on forever
In which case I'm doomed
It could go on forever
In which case I'm doomed

[Outro]
Bona drag, bona drag, bona drag, bona drag...
