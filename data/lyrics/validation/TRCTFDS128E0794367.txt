Your wall's too high, I can't see
Can't seem to reach you, can't set you free
If you can hear me, follow the sound
And help me tear your wall down to the ground

Everyone gets hurt sometimes
Everybody plays the game
If you don't win the first time
Come back and try again
Rocks and bricks can't help you
You can't hide behind your wall
Why don't you try to jump it little girl
I'll catch you if you fall

Ah, sometimes early in the mornin'
Without warning you'll realize
That you ain't too wise
With your head bowed down you go down town
Watch an old lady hit the ground
Lots of people standing 'round
But nobody seems to know her

You're an hour late when you reach your floor
Ah, and everybody tells you
That your boss is sore
Watch the clock for seven more
Then go flying through the door
Back home again the day is gone
You're safe and sound but still alone
And when the night falls around your walls
Ah, tell me don't you ever wish to go outside
Follow the lights and go outside
You'll be alright
Just go outside
