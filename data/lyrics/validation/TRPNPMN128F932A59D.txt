You've been working so hard all day won't you take your rest
You 've been driving my blues away
Now it is my turn
Come fly beneath my wings
Sweet child it may not be for long
Well I may be a drinking hard
Like a fish that swims
And I could be riding high
Like the floating cloud
And if the rain does fall
Sweet child that would not let you drown
Well, I would not care to see what's within in your eyes
I would not care to know
Where your heart does lie
I've tried to trust my heart
But my eyes are pale on me
Sweet child come to me now
Let me take your hand
Well I do not know you well yet I've tried so hard
Through four and twenty years
Sweet child, I still don't understand
Well, I've heard there are great men
Who could save our souls
With kind and gentle hearts
And love is their goal
I really want to know
Sweet child, who could shoot them down
And I would rather tear him down
With the sin in his life
Who sheds his tears upon every mortal soul
And I wonder does he yearn
Sweet child, forget to comfort him
And I once did see a child, she did sit and cry
Where has the pretty flower in the darkness gone?
In the summer you shall see
Sweet child, I guess it won't be long
Won't you lay yourself down and rest
Let your mind relax
And won't you cuddle into the night
I will guide your path
Well, I may not be here long
'Cause I got a feeling to be gone
