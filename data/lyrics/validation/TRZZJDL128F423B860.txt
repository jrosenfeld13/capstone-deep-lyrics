I was sittin' there all alone
I was prayin' you would come home
I was listenin' to an old blues song
You see, I'm wounded, wounded and bleeding
Won't you ease my pain?
You're gettin' a little impatient
Smokin' like a mental patient
Happiness, fishnets and cigarettes
A pagan monkey in a dress
Tell me who can arrest
A mind ensnared by love?
A rogue elephant for a mind
And it's treatin' me so unkind
But in my heart it's an old blues song
Playful and bitchin', mischievous and earthy
Happiness, fishnets and cigarettes
A pagan monkey in a dress
Tell me who can arrest
A mind ensnared by love?
Talk about slayin' a snake
You got my heart bound up in shame
But in my soul it's an old blues song
This life can be so tragic
Until you see the magic
Happiness, fishnets and cigarettes
A pagan monkey in a dress
I'm talking 'bout
Happiness, fishnets and cigarettes
A pagan monkey in a dress
Tell me who can arrest
A mind ensnared by love?
Howdy baby, hey baby
Please stay with me, I pray
Hey baby, hey baby
Don't let me cry in vain
