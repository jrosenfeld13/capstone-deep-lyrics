In the deepest recesses
Underneath the abscesses
Somewhere between adolescence
And a pending death sentence
I can sense a re-emergence of musics hardest occurrence
Most potent at its purest
No placebos for the people
This solutions indivisible and unequivocal
To any feeble vocal previously heard
I dont merely speak words
Im conveying ideas
Sound waves paint a picture like a retinas in your ears
Synesthesias in effect
Synthesizers in your neck
808s break breast plates
Medics on deck
So theres still no need to panic
Even when Im feeling manic
Frantic energy is cracking granite throughout the vicinity
The instant the LEDs flash for the guaranteed cash
Every predecessors burned and returned back to ash
And the space that they previously took up
I occupied and shook up
And now they see my shoes when they look up
From the lowest vantage point
My advantage
Match point
Next serve
Its an ace
Put the trophy in the case
While youre at it crank the bass up on this racket
Vibration for the sedentary could be problematic
Cuz once the speakers active instant movements automatic
My enemys combative cuz their energy is static
In other words motionless
At rest
And idle
Patrons at their recital simply stand
Clearly they dont give a damn
On the other hand
What I understand
Is a beat
And the complimentary components that make it complete
Make the vocals ride
Like theyre tied to the drivers seat
And make sure that when you speak
Its nothing but pure heat
Thats my current checklist with each box Xd off
While the next (is) too soft at his peak to compete
With shit I consider weak
But its not my place to judge
Im just here to speak my mind
Several minutes at a time
Over music Ive designed
Under-rated undefined
Hardcore like a crime with triple digit jail time
Confined in solitary with restraints
And sharp like a shank through the skin of your kin
This is real hardcore
