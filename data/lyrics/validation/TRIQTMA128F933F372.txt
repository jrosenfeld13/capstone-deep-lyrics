Be what you are
Believe what you say
But don't tell me
What I have to play

Be where you are
Change by the day
But don't tell me
What I'm here to say

Land on your feet
No room for mistake
But don't tell me
That you're not afraid

Tap on the glass
You're still on display
Just don't call me
When it slips away
