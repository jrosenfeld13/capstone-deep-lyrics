Leave the keys in the door
And wait for her to come
The secret language of former lovers
Where all your senses go cold

At the end of love
You hold your breath
And if it's something that you forget
Oh, you'll remember it

Darlin' I
Can't get the stain out of my head
An eye for an eye
Is all the ladies, the stories, will tell you but
It's a lie

Leave the keys in the door
As the night soaks us
And if it's something that you forget
Oh, you'll remember it

You see the water rise above the shins and knees
I need the air and you and me
Two eyes, nothing left but sea

Darlin' I
Can't get the stain out of my head
And eye for an eye
Is all the ladies, the stories, will tell you but
It's a lie
