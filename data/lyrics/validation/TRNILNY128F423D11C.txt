To escape you must've been brave
It was a frightening case
Somebody chased you to the same place where your eyes closed
Say hello to the monster in your home
Who roams around when he thinks that he's alone
It's a dream
But no one can hear you scream
No one can hear you
You're not blind- there's a star in the sky

But oh, you'll be standing by my side

On the street wires walk with me
Position me to where I can follow your lead
You say I never leave
I've been everywhere
I've weaved through parking lots, dodging speeding cars and shopping carts
Say goodnight to the contents of your room
Trim the lights for the trimming of the moon
Your bed, it's a shoulder for your head or a helecopter pad

Do you see out of the corner of your eye that I'm standing by your side?
