What's the way of love?
Tell me your fiction
Tell me your lies
Say to me now, you'll never forget this night
I'm feeling emotionless
My head's so clear
My enemies aren't, the ones I fear
You know your kiss confuses
This troubling soul
And I found out
That we're all breaking hearts
That we're all broken hearts

[Chorus:]
If only love could find us all
If only hearts didn't have to fall
We can't mislead to make things right
So instead we'll sleep alone tonight

What's the way of love?
You are thinking I'm crazy
But you're blushing of lust
I've heard a lot of nice things
But tell me which ones I'm to trust?
These walls we made are glass
And they have been known to crack
But until then
You'll keep pushing my way
And I'll keep pushing you away

[Chorus:]
Well, if you want to take a chance
And try to make things right
You better have a reason to be loved
We all want something more
And it is worth fighting for...

[Chorus:]
And if somehow fate were in my hands
Would it be enough to understand
Why we feel lost in a world so small
If only love could find us all...
