Bye bye - all the mercenaries, bye bye - you sold your soul
So high, our beautiful eyes can see, how high, how high we've flown

Everything is in it's place and all is of it's time
I think it's so funny I left you so far behind
You might have another story but I can see your smile
Money it don't buy you love, redemption, hope or style

Bye bye - all the mercenaries, bye bye - you sold your soul
So high, our beautiful eyes can see, how high, how high we've flown

Made yourself a plan and they got a big surprise
Suddenly it's much too late and time has passed you by
Forget all the consequences, just sing me the truth
Aiming for the stars, then you're gonna hit the roof
You don't know if anybody's really by your side
Until your back's against the wall with nowhere left to hide

Bye bye - all the mercenaries, bye bye - you sold your soul
So high, our beautiful eyes can see, how high, so high, so high
So high, it's all a mystery to me, so high, so high
So high, yeah you gotta believe me, so high, so high...
