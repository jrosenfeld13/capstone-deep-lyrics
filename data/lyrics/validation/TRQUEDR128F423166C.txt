Well, the ruins are the big attraction around here
The main draw, as they say
But such contraction is hard to bear
Let's clear it away
Clear it away
Clear it away
Clear it away

I used to crack a lot of safes
Now, here I am dealing scrap
It's a living but not a life
What a beautiful, oh what a beautiful trap
Let's clear it away
Let's clear it away
Let's clear it away

Well, the ruins are the big attraction around here
And there you are in search of novelty
You take a big bite of your appetite
And then you tell me that I'm starving - Oh no
Let's clear it away
Clear it away
Oh, let's clear it away
Let's clear it away
Clear it away
Let's clear it away
Clear it away

Well, the ruins are the big attraction around here
