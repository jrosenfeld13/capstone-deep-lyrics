Over and over again they tell when it's time
To leave this world where we live
The prophecy they predict cannot be true
If the year 1914 is the turning point
Why do we still live
Immortal life destroys your vision
Paradise world is not for you
Wars don't end when you believe in God
Humanity won't be saved
Burn the bible
Desert God and prophecies
Ignore the Jehovahs
And the life goes on the way it does
Shadows from beyond of the end
Surround those hypocrisy believers
Mist of the rising life
Folds believers into morbid death
Over and over again they tell when it's time
To leave this world where we live
The prophecy they predict cannot be true
If the year 1914 is the turning point
Why do we still live
