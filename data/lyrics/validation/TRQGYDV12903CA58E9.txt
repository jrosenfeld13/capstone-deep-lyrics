I've had my days
When I just want to stay in bed
Shut out the world
And put a pillow over my head
Sometimes I feel like giving up
I just think I've had enough

Cause it's a hard road everywhere you turn
With lots of choices and bridges not to burn
There'll be things you like and things you don't
Things you'll do and things you won't
Cause it's a hard road

I've got some friends
Who like to live their life on the edge
Taking chances
But feeling no regrets
What will it take for them to see
You can't escape this reality

Cause it's a hard road everywhere you turn
With lots of choices and bridges not to burn
There'll be things you like and things you don't
Things you'll do and things you won't
Cause it's a hard road

I'm gonna make it
No matter where I go
I know I'm ready even though

It's a hard road everywhere you turn
With lots of choices and bridges not to burn
There'll be things you like and things you don't
Things you'll do and things you won't
Cause it's a hard road

Let's go
