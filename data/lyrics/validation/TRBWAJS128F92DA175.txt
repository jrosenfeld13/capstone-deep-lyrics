I was driving down the highway my music playing loud
I drove into a truckstop stepped up feelin' proud
The stupid gas attendant said "stop that fucking row"
There's always someone somewhere who'll try and turn you down

So if you need some action and nothing comes around
Don't call the doctor turn up the sound
Play it loud
In your neighbourhood
Play it loud
In your neighbourhood

I was lying on the beach taking the rays
Listening to Deep Purple reminiscing of old days
I was hassled by a lifeguard so I kicked him to the ground
There's always someone somewhere who'll try and turn you down

So if you need some action and nothing comes around
Don't call the doctor turn up the sound
Play it loud
In your neighbourhood
Play it loud
In your neighbourhood

I'm sick of people saying our music is too loud
They never stop complaining, try to turn us down
But if you want it louder we'll turn it up full blast
They'll never stop the music they're living in the past

So if you need some action and nothing comes around
Don't call the doctor turn up the sound

Play it loud
In your neighbourhood
[Repeat to end]
