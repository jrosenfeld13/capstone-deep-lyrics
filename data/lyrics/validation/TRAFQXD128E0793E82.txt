Death is on the Midway
Gambling with souls
Roulette on the wire
Ace is in the hole
I sink beneath the feeling
Moon is in my hands
A crooked wheel of Twenty-One
I just don't understand -- NO!

[Chorus]
Laugh
Yeah, drown and
Laugh
Your life is over

("There's a lot of people who are running now. I could run. Man, there's a lot of people who are running now. You think it's right to run?")

If God is the dealer
Why do we never win?
A bloody mix of silk and mud
That starts all over again -- NO!

[Chorus]

Clowns, they scare the children
Roll around the ring
The animals they wanna kill
Anyone, anything

[Chorus]
