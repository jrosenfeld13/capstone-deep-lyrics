V1
So many people spend most of their lives just draggin their feet
Afraid to take a chance, worried about nothing much, getting their means
I know im bound to make mistakes and im gunna fall
But I will be the kind of man to hold up my head, to get back up, to dust myself back off
CHORUS
Im gonna burn up that highway
Chase my dreams and tempt fate
Do things they say just can't be done
Im gunna take in every sunset
Breath each breath like it could be my last
Just in case tomorrow never comes
Im gunna live, laugh and love
Yeah baby
V2
I wanna get high but placed in each kiss I'm feelin that touch
Never had a reason to ever say I didn't give enough
I would climb the highest mountain and count every star
As long as my hearts beating I'll live on the edge
Laugh till it hurts
Live, love make my mark
CHORUS
Im gonna burn up that highway
Chase my dreams and tempt fate
Do things they say just can't be done
Im gunna take in every sunset
Breath each breath like it could be my last
Just in case tomorrow never comes
Im gunna live, laugh and love
BRIDGE
Lifes as good as it gets (yeah)
When theres no regrets (regrets)
Oh no regrets
CHORUS
Im gonna burn up that highway
Chase my dreams and tempt fate
Do things they say just can't be done
Im gunna take in every sunset
Breath each breath like it could be my last
Just in case tomorrow never comes
Im gunna live, laugh and love
Im gunna live, laugh and love
Ooh, yeah
Come on
