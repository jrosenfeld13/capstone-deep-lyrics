You are my consuming passion
Somehow just being with you is all that matters
If I can look in your eyes
Then I can lose all track of time
And a second can last forever
You make me smile despite the sadness
You are the only one who shines through all the madness
I know that you must surely be
The greatest gift I could receive
And my heart is yours forever
God only knows how I've waited for you
You've brought me so much joy
You saved my live without me knowing
You've brought me everything I need to keep on going
And in this world of constant change
I know that nothing stays the same
But my heart is yours forever........
