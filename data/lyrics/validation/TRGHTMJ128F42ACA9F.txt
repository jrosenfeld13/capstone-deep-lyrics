Not a trace of emotion remains inside
Two hearts broken lay down by the riverside
Single handed they tried to escape from me
With a turn of the wheel It was wrong with me

*Drivin' me crazy, oh baby
You're driving me crazy, oh baby
You're driving me crazy, oh baby
You're driving me crazy, oh baby

**This love was born instead of hate
Celebrate our love (celebrate)
Let me feel the right vibration
Celebrate our love (celebrate)
And until the end of time
Celebrate what's mine
Make it good and let it shine
Celebrate our love

Revelation
A fate that you can't decide
They lay drown in the flow of the rising tide
There's a side of your life that you never see
It is real this I feel
And drivin' me-

(*Repeat)

***Gotta find, gotta find, some peace within our time
Until the end of time, until the end of time
(celebrate)
Gotta find, gotta find, some peace within our time
Until the end of time, until the end of time
(celebrate)

(**Repeat with***)
