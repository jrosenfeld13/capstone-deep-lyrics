I'm all alone, when the sun, goes down
What I wouldn't give, to have someone around
The nights are endless, and dreams, are few
But when they come, well they never come true
And so it goes
No one even knows, the pain behind the smile
How all the while I'm cryin'

Save me.....someone save me
Save me.....someone save me
'cause I've been savin' myself for her too long'
It's time I'm movin' on

Won't you save me?
Too many memories in this, old town
My face turned up to meet the rain..the rain that's fallin' down
Let it come
And so it goes
That no one even knows, the pain behind the smile
How all the while I'm dyin'

Save me.....someone save me
Save me.....someone save me
'cause I've been savin' myself for her too long'
It's time I'm movin' on

Won't you save me?
Are you gonna be the one to make it right, or am I only dreamin'
Baby am I dreamin'?......Am I dreamin'?
No one even knows, the pain behind the smile
Whoooooh...baby, baby, baby, baby-they don't know
They don't know...that I'm cryin' all the while
All the while
Somebody save me....save me
Save me......somebody save me (Mm Mm)
Save me.....save me
Save me.......someone save me
'Cause I've been saving myself for her too long
It's time I'm movin' on
Won't you save me....save me
Can't you see.....that I've been lonely?

Save me.....someone save me
Save me.....someone save me
'cause I've been savin' myself for her too long'
It's time I'm movin' on
