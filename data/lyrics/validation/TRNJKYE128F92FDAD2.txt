Enemy, familiar friend
My beginning and my end
Knowing truth, whispering lies
And it hurts again

What I fear, what I try
The words I say and what I hide
All the pain I want it to end
But I want it again

And it finds me, the fight inside is coursing through my veins
And it's raging, the fight inside is breaking me again

It's still the same
Pursuing pain isn't worth the light I've gained
We both know how this will end, but I do it again

And it finds me, the fight inside is coursing through my veins
And it's raging, the fight inside is hurting me again
And it finds me, the war within me pulls me under
And without you, the fight inside is breaking me again

It's nothing
(It's everything)
It's nothing
(It's everything)
It's nothing
(It's everything)
It's nothing
It's everything

And it finds me, the fight inside is coursing through my veins
And it's raging, the fight inside is hurting me again
And it finds me, the war within me pulls me under
And without you, the fight inside is breaking me again

It's breaking me, it's breaking me

I'm falling apart, I'm falling apart
