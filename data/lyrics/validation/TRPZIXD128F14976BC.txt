There's me
Looking down at my shoes
The one smiling like the sun
That's you
What were you thinking
What was the song inside your head
There's us
Going on about a band
Working out how we play our hand
I lay there dreaming
Later all alone in my bed

If I was stupid
Maybe careless
So were you

Not everything is supposed to come true
Some words are best unsaid
Some love is not really love at all
I'll keep everything I shared with you
And that's enough
There's us

Freeze-frame
I'm not about to cry
It's too late for us to change
Why try
I've got a camera
Tucked away inside my heart

If I'm a loser
Or just unlucky
So are you

Not everything is supposed to come true
Some words are best unsaid
Some love is not really love at all
I'll keep everything I shared with you
And that's enough
There's us

Somewhere between then and now
I look away when you said we'll never change
And if you think what might have been
You'll lose today and we've got songs to play

Not everything is supposed to come true
Some words are best unsaid
Some love is not really love at all
I'll keep everything I shared with you
And that's enough
There's us
Not everything is supposed to come true
Some words are best unsaid
Some love is not really love at all
I'll keep everything I shared with you
And that's enough
There's us
