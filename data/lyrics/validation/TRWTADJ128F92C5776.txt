[Verse 1: Scott Weiland]
Driving faster in my car
Falling farther from just what we are
Smoke a cigarette and lie some more
These conversations kill
Falling faster in my car

[Chorus]
Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to take a ride
It leaves today no conversation
Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to wait too long
To wait too long

[Verse 2: Scott Weiland]
Too much walking, shoes worn thin
Too much tripping and my soul's worn thin
Time to catch a ride it leaves today
Her name is what it means
Too much walking, shoes worn thin

[Chorus]
Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to take a ride
It leaves today no conversation
Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to wait too long
To wait too long

[Bridge]
Conversations kill
Conversations kill
Conversations kill

[Chorus]
Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to take a ride
It leaves today no conversation
Time to take her home
Her dizzy head is conscience laden
Time to wait too long
To wait too long

[Outro]
Conversations kill
Conversations kill
