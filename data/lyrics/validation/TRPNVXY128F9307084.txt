Give me time
To realize my crime
Let me love and steal
I have danced inside your eyes
How can I be real

Do you really want to hurt me
Do you really want to make me cry
Precious kisses
Words that burn me
Lovers never ask you why
In my heart the fire's burning
Choose my colour
Find a star
Precious people always tell me
That's a step
A step too far

Do you really want to hurt me
Do you really want to make me cry
Do you really want to hurt me
Do you really want to make me cry

Words are few
I have spoken
I could waste a thousand years
Wrapped in sorrow
Words are token
Come inside and catch my tears
You've been talking but believe me
If it's true
You do not know
This boy loves without a reason
I'm prepared to let you go

If it's love you want from me
Then take it away
Everything is not what you see
It's over today

Do you really want to hurt me
Do you really want to make me cry
Do you really want to hurt me
Do you really want to make me cry
