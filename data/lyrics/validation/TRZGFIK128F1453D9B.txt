You may have heard of jalopies
You heard the noise they make
Let me introduce you to my Rocket '88
Yes it's great, just won't wait
Everybody likes my Rocket '88
Gals will ride in style
Movin' all along

V-8 motor and this modern design
My convertible top and the gals don't mind
Sportin' with me, ridin' all around town for joy
Blow your horn, Rocket, blow your horn

Step in my Rocket and-don't be late
We're pullin' out about a half-past-eight
Goin' on the corner and havin' some fun
Takin' my Rocket on a long, hot run
Ooh, goin' out
Oozin' and cruisin' and havin' fun

Now that you've ridden in my Rocket '88
I'll be around every night about eight
You know it's great, don't be late
Everybody likes my Rocket '88
Gals will ride in style
Movin' all along
