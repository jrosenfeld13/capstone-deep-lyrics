When I was a little baby
My Mama would rock me in the cradle
In them there, ol' cotton fields at home
When I was a little baby
My Mama would rock me in the cradle
In them there, ol' cotton fields at home

Oh when them cotton balls get rotten
You can't pick very much cotton
In them there, ol' cotton fields at home
It was down in Louisiana
Just a mile from Texarkana
In them there ol' cotton fields at home

Now it may sound very funny
But you didn't make very much money
In them there, ol' cotton fields at home
Yes it might sound very funny
But you didn't make very much money
In them there, ol' cotton fields at home

Oh when them cotton balls get rotten
You can't pick very much cotton
In them there, ol' cotton fields at home
It was down in Louisiana
Just a mile from Texarkana
In them there ol' cotton fields at home

I was over in Arkansas
When the sheriff asked me
"What did you come here for?"
In them there, ol' cotton fields at home
Yes I was over in Arkansas
When the sheriff asked me
"What did you come here for?"
In them there, ol' cotton fields at home

Oh when them cotton balls get rotten
You can't pick very much cotton
In them there, ol' cotton fields at home
It was down in Louisiana
Just a mile from Texarkana
In them there ol' cotton fields at home

When I was a little baby
My Mama would rock me in the cradle
In them there, ol' cotton fields at home
When I was a little baby
My Mama would rock me in the cradle
In them there, ol' cotton fields at home

When I was a little baby
My Mama would rock me in the cradle
In them there, ol' cotton fields at home
When I was a little baby
My Mama would rock me in the cradle
In them there, ol' cotton fields at home

Oh when them cotton balls get rotten
You can't pick very much cotton
In them there, ol' cotton fields at home
It was down in Louisiana
Just a mile from Texarkana
In them there ol' cotton fields at home
