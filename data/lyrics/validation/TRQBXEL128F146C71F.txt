[Verse 1]
Sit back, matter fact
Teasing, toying, turning, chatting
Charming, hissing, playing the crowd
Play that song again
Another couple Klonopin
A nod, a glance, a half-hearted bow

[Chorus]
Oh, such grace
Oh, such beauty
And lipstick and callous and fishnets and malice
Oh, darling
You're a million ways to be cruel
You're a million ways to be cruel
You're a million ways to be cruel

[Verse 2]
I should, I wish I could
Maybe if you were, I would
A list of standard-issue regrets
One last eighty proof
Slouching in the corner booth
Baby, it's as good as it gets

[Chorus]
Oh, such grace
Oh, such beauty
So precious, suspicious, and charming, and vicious
Oh, darling
You're a million ways
Oh, darling
You're a million ways to be cruel
You're a million ways to be cruel
You're a million ways to be cruel

Oh, darling
Oh, darling
You're a million ways
Oh, darling
Oh, darling
You're a million ways
Oh, darling
Oh, darling
You're a million ways to be
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
You're a million ways to be cruel
You're a million ways to be cruel
You're a million ways to be cruel
You're a million ways to be cruel
You're a million ways to be cruel
You're a million ways to be
Oh darling
You're a million ways to be cruel
