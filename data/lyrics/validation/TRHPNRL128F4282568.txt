Im adrift on a sea of mystery
Im sailin? round the cape unknown
But that china girl is waitin? there
So I know where I got to go

Oh china, I can hear you call

You see I really dont have the coices
Im a prisoner of those oriental eyes
So I pretend to chart my courses
But im dreamin? of those china nights

Oh china, I can hear you call

Oh china, oh china, oh china, oh yeah
Those oriental eyes are such a mystery
Yeah they are
China calls again

You see now long, long ago
I once had the power to levitate the world
With just my will
Well I thought that it was gone
How could I be so wrong
I belong to china now

Oh china, I can hear you call
