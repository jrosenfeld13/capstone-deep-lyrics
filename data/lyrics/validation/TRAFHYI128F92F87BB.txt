We've come this far by faith
Pick up your pace and don't you be late
I'm hear to tell ya about the good news
Somethin' about the path that we choose y'all
Wisdom has built this house now
Integrity will bring your pride out
If you know how to pray the situation out
Prayer is the answer, there is no doubt

Monday we held it together and
Wednesday we had stormy weather and
Friday we prayed it all better and
Sunday we heard the news

He won't stop blessing you
What he'll do is keep testing you
And a beggar is no less than you
Cause' one day it could be you
So get your folks together for some church y'all
Some good music and prayer in service won't hurt y'all
Even if you don't believe in the preacher
It's bound to be a few things she could teach you

Monday we held it together and
Wednesday we had stormy weather and
Friday we prayed it all better and
Sunday we heard the news

Monday we held it together and
Wednesday we had stormy weather and
Friday we prayed it all better and
Sunday we heard the news

Monday we held it together and
Wednesday we had stormy weather and

These are the greatest days of our test
You need to be working with a made up mind
Walk by faith nor by sight and all you
Battles you know he will fight
The sky changes colors in there many ways
The world is going to be a better place someday
Love and Unity if you just believe
Than all your blessings you will receive

Monday we held it together and
Wednesday we had stormy weather and
Friday we prayed it all better and
Sunday we heard the news

Monday we held it together and
Wednesday we had stormy weather and
Friday we prayed it all better and
