You're my boppin' high school baby, dear and you're for me
Yes, my boppin' high school baby suits me to a T
Every time I look at you, my eyes bulge out
Sayin' a-look here everybody and begin to shout
She's my boppin' high school baby, loves me naturally
Yes, my boppin' high school baby loves nobody but me
Well, things aren't always from-a A to B
And when it comes to boppin' she is heavenly
She just dances 'round the floor, nice and light
And when the music's quick then she can bop all night
She's my boppin' high school baby, loves me naturally
Yes, my boppin' high school baby loves nobody but me
Well, the boys all in school, they all envy me
'Cause my boppin' high school baby loves no one but me
But there's one thing that I'm sure about
That I won't lose my baby when school turns out
She's my boppin' high school baby, loves me naturally
Yes, my boppin' high school baby loves nobody but me
