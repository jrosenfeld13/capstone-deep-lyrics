Half the time
As I sit in disarray
I am thinking of a dream I never had
Then I awake and for a while
I call your name in Colin's house
But tiny children have a way of falling down

Oh I could make a meal
Of that wonderful dispair I feel
But waking up I turn and face the wall

The car arrives
And takes me back again
Drifting through imaginary blaze
And fighting men, a border raft
A sailing ship has run aground
And confidence is valued in these days

But each character
Is plundering my home
And taking everything that is my own

Oh no, I'm not sure about
Those things that I cared about
Oh no, I'm not sure
Not anymore
Oh no, I'm not sure about
Those things that I cared about
Oh no, I'm not sure
Not anymore
