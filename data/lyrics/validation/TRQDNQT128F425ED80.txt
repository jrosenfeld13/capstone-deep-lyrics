[Intro]
Spinning around, spinning around, spinning around

[Chorus]
I'm spinning around, move out of my way
I know you're feeling me cause you like it like this
I'm breaking it down, I'm not the same
I know you're feeling me cause you like it like this

[Verse 1]
Traded in my sorrow for some joy that I borrowed
From back in the day
Threw away my old clothes, got myself a better wardrobe
I got something to say
I'm through with the past, ain't no point in looking back
The future will be
And did I forget to mention that I found a new direction
And it leads back to me?

[Chorus]
I'm spinning around, move out of my way
I know you're feeling me cause you like it like this
I'm breaking it down, I'm not the same
I know you're feeling me cause you like it like this

[Verse 2]
The mistakes that I've made have given me the strength
To really believe
And no matter how I take it, there's no way I'm gonna fake it
'Cause it's gotta be real
I've got nothing left to hide, no reason left to fight
'Cause the truth's given me
A new freedom inside, getting rid of my desire
Do you like what you see?

[Chorus]
I'm spinning around, move out of my way
I know you're feeling me cause you like it like this
I'm breaking it down, I'm not the same
I know you're feeling me cause you like it like this

[Bridge]
Baby, baby, baby
You know you like it like this
Baby, baby, baby
You know you like it like this
Baby, baby, baby

[Chorus]
I'm spinning around, move out of my way
I know you're feeling me cause you like it like this
I'm breaking it down, I'm not the same
I know you're feeling me cause you like it like this

[Outro]
I'm not the same
I'm not the same
