Well I still want you today
And I hoped to hear you say
That I am unable to resist your evil love
And I am unable to resist

Well I still need you tonight
But I won't put up a fight
Though everything that means something
Has left me in mid-flight

And I am unable to resist your scurvy love
And I am unable to resist your evil love
And I am unable to resist

Well I still want you today
And I hoped to hear you say
That I am unable to resist your scurvy love
And I am unable to resist your evil love
And I am unable to resist
