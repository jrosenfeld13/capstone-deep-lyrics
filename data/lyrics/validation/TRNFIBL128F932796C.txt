[Patterson]

So you made it? Shame you had to fake it..
So you feigned the way? You're a fucking disgrace to the name..

So you reaped what I had sown?
Scattered ashed blown into the unknown
While you were selling my soul, cold..

Black lies failing... forging sound..
Lights out as you hit the ground
