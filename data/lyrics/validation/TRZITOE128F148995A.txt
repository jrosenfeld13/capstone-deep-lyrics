You're parents and the goverment say why do you need drugs
They think they know whats good for you but still they call you thugs
Your parents and the Goverment, they always think they're right
They bring you up the right way and teach you how to fight
Then they call you antisocial, you are opposed to all their ways
They think ????
They're laying in their graves
There is no real need for drugs or so its always said
Because they know the harm that's done the freedom in your head
