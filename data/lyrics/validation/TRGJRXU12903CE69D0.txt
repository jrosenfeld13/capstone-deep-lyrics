Ain't got no home
No place to roam
Ain't got no home
No place to roam
I'm a lonely boy
I ain't got a home

I've got a voice
I love to sing
I sing like a girl
And I sing like a frog
I'm a lonely boy
I ain't got a home

I ain't got a man
I ain't got a son
I ain't got a daughter
I ain't got no one
I'm a lonely girl
I ain't got a home

I ain't got a mother
I ain't got a father
I ain't got a sister
Not even a brother
I'm a lonely frog
I ain't got a home

Oh won't you say it to me
Please say it to me
Oh won't you say it to me
Please say it to me
I'm a lonely frog
I ain't got a home
