The Queen she divides her land into three
She is as cruel as she wants to be
Many an hour she sits there all alone
All alone but always thinking

Which of my children loves me the best?
I'll give them everything, leave none to the rest
I'll give them all my land and my jewels too
But my love, none shall have it

Mother, dear mother, you've done me a great wrong
You married me when I was far too young
The man was rich, but he left me with a child
I need your gold to feed him

Daughter, dear daughter, I've done you no wrong
I married you to a great lord's son
Find a new man for when I'm dead and gone
As for gold, I'll give you nothing

Mother, dear mother, if you see fit
Grant me your kingdom and I'll watch over it
I will rule your land as you would yourself
For I am most like you

Daughter, dear daughter, no I don't see fit
To give you my land, you'll have none of it
Your words offend me, for how could you presume
That you could rule as I do?

Which of my children loves me the best?
I'll give them everything, leave none to the rest
I'll give them all my land and my jewels too
But my love, none shall have it

Mother, dear mother, I do not want your land
I don't want your riches, nor jewels on my hand
My request is simple, it's every child's desire
I only want your blessing

Daughter, dear daughter, you're nothing but a fool
This world is governed by one and only rule
I will die with all my land and all my jewels too
And my love, none shall have it
