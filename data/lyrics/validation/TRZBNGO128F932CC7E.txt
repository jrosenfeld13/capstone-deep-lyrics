Blackened whores of our one track dreams
Pimped for profit by that bitch called greed
And this not so perfect picture of humanity
All these corrupted ideals for which we weep

You say you're about
Ready to breakdown
Well I say everything
Has already brokedown
This world we live in
Such a fucking letdown
Every dream we've dreamt
Will continue to be shotdown

We're on the comedown

We die within things that should have been
This world is buried beneath our skin
Living on nerve-fused wire rails
Giving half-truths that sleep on a bed of nails

There's no hope
Everything grows old
Common causes
Manipulate
Mentalities collide
Walking on ropes
That are threaded
With clumps of sand
As we
Victimize ourselves

I live within all the things that should have been
As I sit and let this world tear through my paper skin
Feeling the words cut like spades through my heart
Dwelling within a disappointed house of cards

You say you're about
Ready to breakdown
Well I say everything
Has already brokedown
This world we live in
Such a fucking letdown
Every dream we've dreamt
Will continue to be shotdown

The fate of the clocks future is buried in snow
Remaining in a glacial terrain that hinders growth
Peeling through layers of lies and oceans of ice
Forgotten as I'm left hooked up to this device

We must be brought down
We're such a letdown
We must be brought down
