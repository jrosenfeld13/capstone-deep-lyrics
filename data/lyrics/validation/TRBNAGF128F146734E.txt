You don't mind giving in to temptation as long as no one knows
Your midnight invitation where your madness flows
Fires of passion rage all night Angels falling out of the light

Control undercover you can paralyze
Every love is one more victim they never realize
All their desires burn like a fever
They want to run but they just can't leave her

Secret Service Secret Service
Do they know how you scream
Secret Service passion - hunger
Do they know how you scream

I should have seen through her diguise She was a masquerade
Cold kiss hungry eyes then she began to fade
Feeling lost I want to be found
Heaven's in hell DON'T LOOK DOWN

Secret Service Secret Service
Do they know how you scream
Secret Service Secret Service

Do they know how you cry Can they see your dreams
Have they heard you sigh
Or do you save it all for me in your SECRET SERVICE
