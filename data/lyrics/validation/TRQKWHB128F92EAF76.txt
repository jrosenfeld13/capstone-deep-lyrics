[Verse 1]
Those eyes they transmit
All your loving
Echoes light into dark hearts
I would swear I've seen this, left beside me
Your eyes they hypnotize

[Chorus]
She keeps me here so spellbound
Her love pulls me near to stranger ground
I've lost my mind there
This dark magic mirror, spellbound

[Verse 2]
A heart-shaped face
With words as cold as stone
I can't believe this is my fate

She raised your head
Now the night, it's coming down
I accept this fate I accept my love you won't be long

[Chorus]
You keep me here so spellbound
Your love pulls me near to sacred ground
I lost my mind there
This dark magic mirror, spellbound
And i can't leave now
Leave her now
Leave her now

[Chorus]
She keeps me near so spellbound
Her love pulls me near to stranger ground
I lost my mind there
This dark magic mirror, spellbound
This dark magic mirror, spellbound
So spellbound
So spellbound
So spellbound
