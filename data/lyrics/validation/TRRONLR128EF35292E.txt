Another night of reckless thinking leads to headaches
Sleeping with the paparazzi through another earthquake
We cut the velvet rope but couldn't cut the tension
"Yea, that's my friend"
The name was dropped in all directions

These are my friends
I just met them
As fleeting as flashbulbs
As fast as past tense

You can check your list
I guarantee my name is on it
Yea, they're with me
The pack of wolves with gin and tonics
We're breaking hearts, we're breaking necks
We're broken records
Beggars can't be choosers said the legend to the losers

Color me the loss of patience
I'll color you the withered acquantiance
Celebrities who strive to matter
Respect is killed by muffled chatter
And so it goes the tale of giants
Pierced through the back by psuedo tyrants
