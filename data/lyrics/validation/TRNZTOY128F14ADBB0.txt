I know what youre thinking
I know where youre going
I know what youre doing now
I know all the things that
Oh yeah you used to tell me
I know youre telling her right now
And all the times you held
My hand
Im so over and im so
Over you
Now its over
I know what youre thinking
I know just what you think
Of me
I know you think of someone
Else
I know all the reasons you
Think i can't get over it
Well maybe you only fool
Yourself
And all the times i held my
Breath
Im so over it and im so
Over you
Now its over
And all the times you held
My hand
Im so over it
And all the times you told
Me that you like the way i laugh
And all the things we used
To do
Im so over it and im so
Over you
Now its over
