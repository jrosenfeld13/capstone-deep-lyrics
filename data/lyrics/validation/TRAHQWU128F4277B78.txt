A mere myth to men with legs that touch the sky
The unavailable is in my reach now

That which men strive
For is what I have
It's what you've wanted all along
But you can't take what belongs to me now
And unbeknownst to me

She said those words one night
Those words that last a life time
And are worth the fight

The shadows on her face that day
Are all I remember
They shed light on what truth can be

She always looks so pretty
In her iridescence
Beauty runs deeper than flesh

She's so good to me
So very long awaited
It is understood beauty runs deeper than flesh
In her iridescence beauty
Runs deeper than flesh

We don't even have to speak like clarity
It's understood
