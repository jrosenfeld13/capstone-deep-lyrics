She comes on like a rose
But everybody knows
She'll get you in dutch
You can look but you better not touch

Poison Ivy
Poison Ivy
Late at night while you're sleepin'
Poison Ivy comes a creepin' around
She's round

She's pretty as a daisy
But look out man she's crazy
She'll really do you in
If you let her get under your skin

Poison Ivy
Poison Ivy
Late at night while you're sleepin'
Poison Ivy comes a creepin' around
She's round

Measles make you bumpy
And mumps'll make you lumpy
And chicken pox'll make you jump and twitch
A common cold'll fool ya
And whoopin' cough can cool ya
But poison ivy Lord'll make you itch

You're gonna need an ocean
Of calamine lotion
You'll be scratchin' like a hound
The minute you start to mess around

Poison Ivy
Poison Ivy
Late at night while you're sleepin'
Poison Ivy comes a creepin' around
She's round
