Hey, if you were right I'd chase away
All the reason for my old desire to change
But the right words, don't improvise the ideals
My body sails into a passage waiting in vain

It might just be so uninviting, is it comical
From until now I've gone to something else

I'll never forget how I once saw myself
If not for the way I'd changed, if not for the way

Say, every hour is always the same
Gazing endlessly to the usual clouds I'd always collect
As the town slips with the hatfull by the sunset
And paralyze the aspirations of the day

The rightous become the silenced
The fallen ones, they'll never find that road that's fallen them

I'll never forget how I once saw myself
If not for the way I'd changed, if not for the way
It's not quite the same

I'll never forget how I once saw myself
If not for the way I'd changed, if not for the way
It's not quite the same
