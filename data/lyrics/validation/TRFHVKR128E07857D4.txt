[Verse 1]
We're living in repetition
Content in the same old shtick again
Now the routine's turning to contention
Like a production line going over and over and over
Roller coaster

[Chorus]
Now I cannot speak, I've lost my voice
I'm speechless and redundant
Cause "I love you"'s not enough
I'm lost for words

[Verse 2]
Choreographed and lack of passion
Prototypes of what we were
Went full circle 'til I'm nauseous
Taken for granted, now I waste it, faked it, ate it
Now I hate it

[Chorus]
Now I cannot speak, I've lost my voice
I'm speechless and redundant
Cause "I love you"'s not enough
I'm lost for words

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Now I cannot speak, I've lost my voice
I'm speechless and redundant
Cause "I love you"'s not enough
I'm lost for words

Now I cannot speak, I've lost my voice
I'm speechless and redundant
Cause "I love you"'s not enough
I'm lost for words
