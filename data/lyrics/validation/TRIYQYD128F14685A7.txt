Still, so, here we go, nighthawk calls again
Meeting after midnight like we do
Flesh bared, never scared, know their kind too well
"Grab that Gretsch before the truth hits town"
You whispered to me as they fell

Chorus:
And when I'm safe and sound with nothing left to send
The bugle sounds again

The cards are on the table now and every other cliche
Somehow fits me like a glove
You know that I'd be loathe to call it love
For strength will come to tower above
The things that I have learned to love
And just as I'm about to say 'amen'
The bugle sounds again

The vampires made a killing, filled their pockets up with shillings
Saying 'someone has to pay' and you were still in hiding
Singing 'come and cry beside me' so I ran away

And when I'm safe and sound with nothing left to send
The bugle sounds again
