Long ago you broke off your joke and tore off your bonds
You said: "I will not serve"! indeed on every high hill
And under every spreading tree you lay down as a prostitute
I form the light and create darkness
I bring prosperty and create disaster
I THE LORD
I THE GOD
I form the light and create darkness
I make weal and create sadness
I THE LORD
I THE HORNED

[Chorus]
When the night of love draws to its close
REGE DIABOLICUS REGE MALUM
The red mist rises to greet the dawn
REGE DIABOLICUS DIABOLICUS DEUS
Covering the lord of those who do not dare to be
REGE DIABOLICUS REGE MALUM
The sign of evil is here to feel
REGE DIABOLICUS DIABOLICUS DEUS
I form life and create fire
I promise peace and create pyre
I THE LORD
I THE GOD
I form life and create fire
I bring delight and bear desire
I THE LORD
I THE HORNED

[Chorus]
