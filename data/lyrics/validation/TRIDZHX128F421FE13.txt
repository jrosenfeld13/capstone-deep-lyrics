Sometimes I hate reality, it makes me feel so bad
Seeing people hurt eachother and they don't even care

I think of self-destruction but I tell those thoughts to go away
I won't give up, I will hang on. I'll keep living form day to day
I don't plan ahead or think of yesterday
I wonder what to do now instead
I think about this fucked up world until my eyes are blazing red

Every time I watch the news or read a magazine
The pain and suffering in this world make me want to scream
People hating others because the color of their skin
People rape and kill each other for fucked up reasons

We lived in a FUCKED UP WORLD! (x4)
