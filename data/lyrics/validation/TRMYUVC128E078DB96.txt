Funny to think I trusted you
Funny to think that I have spent my whole damn life supporting you
Funny that I believed in you
Funny I thought that you'd be there if I should ever call on you

So now I'm jaded
Friends turned to enemies

Now that I know you work for them
Now that I know your life is based around such lies and corporate greed
You only believe what you are told
You only defend laws that are old - because it's law don't make it right

So now I'm jaded
Friends turned to enemies

All my life I've done what I've been asked
So who is right? The one behind the mask

So now I'm jaded
Friends turned to enemies

Funny to think I trusted you
Funny to think that I have spent my whole damn life supporting you
Funny that I believed in you
Funny I thought that you'd be there if I should ever call on you

All my life I've done what I've been asked
So who is right? The one behind the mask
All my life I've done what I've been asked
So who is right? The one behind the mask
