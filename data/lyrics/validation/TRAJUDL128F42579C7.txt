Now without her hogtied feet
She had everything that a body could need

I know where her heart was playing deep inside a broken chest
And you never seen the worry
And you know what heats amiss

Lake snake I want you (x3)
Won't you lay on top
My god is aching, lay on top

Now without her hogtied feet
She had everything that a body could need

All the judgement of her pleasure hadn't seen a broken din
And the lightness of her want
Had apes to mend had legs to sin

Lake snake I want you
