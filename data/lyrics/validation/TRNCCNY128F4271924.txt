[Verse 1]
Love, what have you done, oh wow
I was sure up 'til now
That she was a friend
I stayed 'til the end
(Don't be a fool again)
I once believed that love was fair
But I don't anymore
She said I'm a bore
My heart hit the floor
(Don't be a fool anymore)

[Pre-Chorus]
Each time around I tell myself
"It's the game of love"
Ignore the signs and risk it all in the name of love
Well, I've decided I can't let nobody hurt me again
So I'll say it 'til the end

[Chorus]
I just don't wanna be a fool (Don't wanna be a fool)
Said I don't wanna be a fool ever again

[Verse 2]
Whenever a fool's in love
He doesn't know he's to blame
He's caught in the game
It all ends up the same
(He doesn't feel the shame)
He looks at love in a different way
It breaks his heart every time
They all turn estranged
But he'll never change
(He's never gonna change)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, next time around I'll tell myself
"It'll be better than before"
I won't look back, there'll be no one
Tearing my heart out anymore, my baby
I've just decided I can't let nobody fool me again
So I'll swear 'til the end

[Chorus]
I just don't wanna be a fool (Don't wanna be a fool)
Said I don't wanna be a fool ever again

[Bridge]
(No way) I mean no more
(Never again) Ooh, no never
(I can't be a fool) Can't be, no way
No way, no way
Ooh, I don't want to be
I don't want to be a fool, no

(I can't love anybody walking on a one way street)
Any way, any way, any way, no
(If I don't find somebody, that'll be alright with me)
I know, I know it'll be alright now
'Cause I decided not to let nobody kill me again
So I'll say it 'til the end

[Chorus]
I just don't wanna be a fool (Don't wanna be a fool)
Said I don't wanna be a fool never, never again

[Outro]
(Don't wanna be a fool) Can't be a fool
(Don't wanna be a fool) Ever again
(I don't wanna be a fool) Never, oh never, oh never again
(Don't wanna be a fool) Can't be a fool
