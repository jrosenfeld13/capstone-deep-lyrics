I woke up in a bed
So I rang to be fed
From a dream to Tetley
I woke up in a war
Flynn as John Barrymore
Constant drama of body
You ask me "what the heck?"
Crick in my neck
Um, could you wait a sec?
A crick in my neck

There, behind my back
What's that sound behind my back?
Jesus said: "I gotta get outta here..."
But on the other hand
Salvage from the new land
And floating up into the atmosphere
I heard "what the heck?"
Crick in my neck
Brother, could you wait a sec?
A crick in my neck

O, body, holding me back
O, body, you're such a drag!
The physical
The tooth and nail
And withal, time is the crime
