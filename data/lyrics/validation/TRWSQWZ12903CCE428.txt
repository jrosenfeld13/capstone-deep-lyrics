Yeah, I'm gonna change everything
That holds a memory of you, oh yeah

I'm gonna start with the walls
Take the pictures off the walls and burn 'em
Move the chairs around
Take the window curtains down and burn 'em
Everything I see reminds me you were here

Yeah, I'm gonna change everything
That holds a memory of you, oh yeah

The candelabra set
You gave me on the night of my birthday
Records that you bought
The records we loved to play
The decorating man will come and rearrange things

Yeah, I'm gonna change everything
That holds a memory of you, oh yeah

Take the carpet off the floor
Throw it out the door, it's filled with tears
Everything I find
That brings you to my mind must disappear
Every night I dream, I'll dream of someone new

Yeah, I'm gonna change everything
That holds a memory of you
Yeah, I'm gonna change everything
That holds a memory of you, oh yeah
Oh yeah
