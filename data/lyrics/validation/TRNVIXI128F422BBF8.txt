I'm so scared cause along with this infection I will fear rejection
She is all I ever wanted, and I'm not the one, the only one
Through sheets you will teach and I will learn. I
've always wanted you to know
Don't care even if these sheets did burn
I'm scared, full of fear, but aware and so, you need to know
I don't wanna be your lover, I just wanna be myself
You can hide between the covers and taste the bitterness you've given to me
I don't wanna be your lover, I just wanna be myself
Why can't we just be together and say this is how we've wanted to be
I can't stand, since the birth of this inception we've been deemed a collection
You don't have to go on girl, cause I can feed your appetite
Why can't you conceive this? All she's got is all I need
All that she wants and all that she needs she can't give to me
All that I've got is all that she needs
All that she wants and all that she needs
You can't taste these lips for free
I don't wanna be your lover, I just wanna be myself
Why can't we just be together cuz I'm sick of being placed right on the shelf
