[Verse 1]
Thumbing through the pages of my fantasies
Pushing all the mercy down, down, down
I wanna see you try to take a swing at me
Come on, gonna put you on the ground, ground, ground
Why are you trying to make fun of me?
You think it's funny?
What the fuck you think its doing to me?
You take your turn lashing out at me!
I want you crying with your dirty ass in front of me!

[Chorus]
All of my hate cannot be bound
I will not be drowned
By your thoughtless scheming
So you can try to tear me down
Beat me to the ground
I will see you screaming

[Verse 2]
Thumbing through the pages of my fantasies
I'm above you, smiling at you, drown, drown, drown
I wanna kill and rape you the way you raped me
And Ill pull the trigger, and youre down, down, down
Why are you trying to make fun of me?
You think its funny?
What the fuck you think its doing to me?
You take your turn lashing out at me!
I want you crying with your dirty ass in front of me!

[Chorus]
All of my hate cannot be bound
I will not be drowned
By your thoughtless scheming
So you can try to tear me down
Beat me to the ground
I will see you screaming

[Bridge]
All my friends are gone, they died
Gonna take you down!
They all screamed and cried
Gonna take you down!
Ive got my body, got my body back against the wall!
Ive got my body, got my body back against the wall!
Ive got my body, got my body back against the wall!
Ive got my body, got my body back against the wall!
Ive got my body, got my body back against the wall!
Ive got my body, got my body back against the wall!
Ive got my body, got my body back against the wall!
Ive got my body, got my body back against the wall!

[Chorus]
All of my hate cannot be bound
I will not be drowned
By your thoughtless scheming
So you can try to tear me down
Beat me to the ground
I will see you screaming
All of my hate cannot be bound
I will not be drowned
By your thoughtless scheming
So you can try to tear me down
Beat me to the ground
I will see you screaming
