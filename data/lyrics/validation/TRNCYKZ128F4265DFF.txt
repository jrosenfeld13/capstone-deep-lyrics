Machines have no conscience

Uniform printout reads
End of line
Protect code intact leaves
Little time
Erratic surveys, free thinking not allowed
My hands shake, my push buttons silence
The outside crowd

One world government has outlawed war among nations
Now social control requires
Population
Termination

Have we come too far to turn around
Does emotion hold the key
Is logic just a synonym
For this savagery
Disguised in forgotten lost memory

Microchip logic
Have we no more thoughts
"Is this wrong" I enter
Answers sought
Punch, punch, punch
Transfer this data into code
Wide eyes watch
My number 156 is shown

Created from past life to perform illicit function
I fail this conscious madness
I man/machine imperfection

Have we come too far
To turn around
Does emotion hold the key
Is logic just a synonym
For this savagery
Disguised in forgotten lost memory

End of line
