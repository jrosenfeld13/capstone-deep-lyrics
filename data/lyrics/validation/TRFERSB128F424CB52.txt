I won't kneel everytime you call
I can feel that you crawl
I won't back everytime you cry
Misery
Time won't heal everything you do
You got me in your claw
Why do you bringing me down
Help me

With a smile on my face I leave this race

Fear for my resurrection
Fear for my resurrection

I don't want to relive my life

I have felt everything before
Dark in mind and in my soul
I feel pain sweeping me cold
Release me
Time will take everything away
Close your eyes and forget
They are now ending my life
Farewell

With a smile on my face I leave this race

Fear for my resurrection
Fear for my resurrection
