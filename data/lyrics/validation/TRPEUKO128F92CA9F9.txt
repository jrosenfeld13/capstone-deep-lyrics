Mother teach me how to walk again
Into the fire
I'm reunited
Into the fire
I am the spark

Mother teach me how to walk again
Milk and honey so intoxicating
Into the fire
I'm reunited
Into the fire
I am the spark
Into the night
I yearn for comfort

Open the doors that lead on into Eden
Don't want no cheap disguise
Follow the signs marked back to the beginning
No more compromise

And Into the fire
I'm reunited
Into the fire
I am the spark
Into the night
I yearn for comfort

Free the water that carries me to sea
You I see as my security

Into the fire
I'm reunited
Into the fire
Oh, I am the spark
Into the night
I yearn for comfort

I will stare at the sun until its light doesn't blind me
I will walk unto the fire until its heat doesn't burn me
And I will feed the fire

Into the fire
I'm reunited
Into the fire
I am the spark
Into the night
I yearn for comfort
Into the fire
Into the fire
Into the fire
I'm reunited
Into the fire
Oh, I am the spark
Into the night
I yearn for comfort
Into the fire
Into the fire
Into the fire
Into the night
Into the fire
Into the fire
Into the fire
