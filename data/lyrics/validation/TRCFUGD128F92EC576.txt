If I didn't see you
I couldn't make up my mind
About love, a question all the time
I want you near me
Won't let you out of my sight
Show me the entrance to your love
A question love no more

Until I met you
I'd never felt so good before
My old loves brand new
It takes me to make me feel good

If I didn't see you
I couldn't make up my mind
About love, a question all the time
I want you near me
Won't let you out of my sight
Show me the entrance to your love
A question love no more

Until I met you
I'd never felt so good before
My old loves brand new
It takes me to make me feel good
