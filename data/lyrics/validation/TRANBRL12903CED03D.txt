I've never been this close to Heaven
But now I'm walking on sacred ground
I didn't know Your touch could save me
But look what I've found
I dreamt you took me to the river
And I woke up baptized in Your light

I'm giving my love to You only
I'm giving my love, my love, giving my sweet soul love
I know with you I'll never know lonely
I'm giving my love, my love, giving my sweet soul love

Now that all my prayers are answered
Let me show you what faith can do
I never let myself believe in forever
'Til I met You, it's true. I do
You Took the burden off my shoulders
So I can always be praising you

I'm giving my love to You only
I'm giving my love, my love, giving my sweet soul love
I know with you I'll never know lonely
I'm giving my love, my love, giving my sweet soul love
