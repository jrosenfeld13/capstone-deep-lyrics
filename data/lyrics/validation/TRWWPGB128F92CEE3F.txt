It was last night
At our empty warehouse party
And there in the black light
I could see the tattoos glowing on your body

And she said to meet her there
Beside the power station
And she said she'd let me stare
If the chemicals don't keep her waiting

Well I'm always coming down
From the night before where I've left you
Yeah, I'm always coming down
But I'm doing my best to get caught
And I'm always coming down from the night before
Well I bet you
To hear that gets you off
What gets you off?

Red fingernail polish
Peeling like a sunburn
That black designer dress
Looks better underneath our feet
Your knees in the dirt

Well I'm always coming down
From the night before where I've left you
Yeah, I'm always coming down
But I'm doing my best to get caught
And I'm always coming down from the night before
Well I bet you
To hear that gets you off
What gets you off?
