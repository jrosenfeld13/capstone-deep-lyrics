You can push me down, but I'll still stand
You can put me down, you're such a man
I could care less what you think of me
All you prove is insecurity
I was never meant to be
But I stay positively
If progression is the least I see
I will stay positively
You insist you're right, but I prove you wrong
I don't think you'll be here for long
Why must you make others feel your sorrow?
Today you'll fight, but what about tomorrow?
Life around is turning black
But I stay positively
There is no turning back
And I will stay positively
