Don't act so tough
You think I know you too well
When I woke up
I didn't know where I was
I'm workin' hard
I'm workin' hard
I'm workin' hard
But it ain't workin' so far
We fell in love
And now it's never enough
When I woke up
I didn't know where I was
I'm workin' hard
I'm workin' hard
I'm workin' hard
But it ain't workin' so far
So far
I'm workin' hard
I'm workin' hard
I'm workin' hard
But it ain't workin' so far
So far
So far
So long
