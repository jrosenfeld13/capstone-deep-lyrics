Never give up, never give in
Never look back
C'mon now my friend
You're not alone
The hope of tomorrow is calling
There's a brighter day
On the other side
But it's up to you to put back on your stride
So get up, step out, live it
Honey don't you give up
It's time for you to start to breathe again
For the sun and the moon have never stopped
Shining on you my friend
I know you feel the world has passed you by
But the greatness in you is starting to rise
Faded dreams need to be recoloured
I know you've had it bad
But it's time to dream again
Write it down my friend
Make it pain Oh yeah
That desire you hold
It will see the light of day
There's a beautiful day
On the other side
But it's up to you to put back on your stride
So get up, step out, live it
Honey don't you give up
What's it gonna take for you to see
That it's only the grace of God
That will set you free
What's it gonna take for you to
Open up your eyes
Look beyond the skies
Faded dreams need to be recoloured
I know you've had it bad
But it's time to live again
Write it down my friend
Make it plain oh Yeh
That desire you hold
It will see the light of day
Never, never, no never give up
Time to breathe again
Time to dream again
This desire you hold
It will see the light of lay
Never give up, never give in
Never look back
C'mon now my friend
You're not alone
The hope of tomorrow is calling
