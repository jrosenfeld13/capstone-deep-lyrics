When I look into your eyes
It worries me what I see
Some kinda storm blowin around
Darlin you know there is nothing I can do for you
Cause I'm not the one you thought you found

Keep you distance
There's no chance of holding me
Trust me - it won't do you any good
I know this is not what I promised you
I never seem to keep the ones I should

Don't look - it's a long way down
Watch out it's a long way down
And getting up ain't something you've got left in you
And if you fall - I will not be around
Careful love, it's a long way down

Maybe allof this went just a little far
A subtle response to a letter I read
My intention was only to humble you
Seems l've brought you to your knees instead
So careful love - it's a long way down
