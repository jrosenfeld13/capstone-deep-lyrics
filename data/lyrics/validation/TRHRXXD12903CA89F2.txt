You didn't know I wasn't free
When you fell in love with me
And with all your young heart
You learned to care
It brought you shame and disgrace
The world has tumbled in your place
Because they call our love
A back street affair

They say you wrecked my home
I'm a husband that's gone wrong
They don't know the sorrow
That we've had to bear
For the one that I'm tied to
Was the first to be untrue
And yet they call our love
A back street affair

We have each other now
That's all that matters anyhow
Why the judgment of
Gossip's never fair
We'll just be brave and strong
Then someday
They'll see they're wrong
So let them call our love
A back street affair

We'll be free to love someday
When all the talk has died away
And the happiness
We've hoped for then we'll share
I'll climb a mountain high
And the world will hear me cry
That our love is not
A back street affair
