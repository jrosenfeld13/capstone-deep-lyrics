Oh-oh-oh-oh!
Oh-oh-oh-oh!

Kat DeLuna
And Akon
Yeah-oh!
Konvict

I see you dancing with every girl
(Eh!)
Looking for someone to rock your world
(Yeah!)
I'm checking your body
It's looking right
(Eh!)
Boy I can tell that you go all night
(Yeah!)

Sweet boy, I just wanna be your fantasy boy
If you want it boy you gotta
Push, push, push baby
Don't stop for a minute
Oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh!
I said push, push baby
Take it to the limit
Oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh!

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh!
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh!
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh!
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh!

Push it baby just the way I like
(You know I want it)
Pick me up and take me for a ride
(You know I want it)
Sexy body don't you wanna turn me out
(You know I want it)
When I hop into it
Take me to the crowd
Oh-oh-oh-ohh!

Sweet boy, I just wanna be your fantasy boy
If you want it boy you gotta
Push, push, push baby
Don't stop for a minute

Oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh!
I said push, push baby
Take it to the limit
Oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh!

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh!
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh!
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh!
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh!

It's like I won this lottery
Which I about to go get my claim on
Damn you look like the perfect picture
About to go get my frame on
Looking like the type I've been searching
To put my last name on
Come on closer with your umbrella
'Cause you're about to get rained on
Clap it up baby keep on clapping
Back it up by the way you're stacking
Kat DeLuna's now the captain
Akon wanna know what's cracking

Push, push, push baby
Don't stop for a minute
Oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh!
I said push, push baby
Take it to the limit
Oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh!

Push, push, push baby
Don't stop for a minute
Oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh!
I said push, push baby
Take it to the limit
Oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh!

(Come on!)

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh!
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh!
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh!
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh!
