I'll leave it burning
And I won't be coming back again to this dismal town
Filled with fair-weather friends
This time (this time)
I'll break ties with the greatest of ease
Expect the worst from me, I'll come through like you wouldn't believe
We built this life, and now it's ours (we built this life and now it's ours)
We'll leave this town for dead (dead)
Leave these streets and take with us our scars
We built this life, and now it's ours (we built this life and now it's ours)
We'll leave this town for dead (dead)
Leave these streets and take with us our scars
I'll leave it burning, and I won't be coming back again
Because this town toure me down and I had to built myself back up again
Snow falls (snow falls) on the sight of your first kiss
I'm running out of places to hide
I always knew it would come to this
We built this life, and now it's ours (we built this life and now it's ours)
We'll leave this town for dead (dead)
Leave these streets and take with us our scars
We built this life, and now it's ours (we built this life and now it's ours)
We'll leave this town for dead (dead)
Leave these streets and take with us our scars
Apologies to my friends and family for my songs ending up this way
Each word, each line, just a fragment of whatever it is that I was trying to say (farewell)
If you get one parting gift, it's that I carry memories like a bag of bricks (farewell)
And if you've seen the last of me, well then you've seen the very best of me
I'll leave it burning and I won't come back
