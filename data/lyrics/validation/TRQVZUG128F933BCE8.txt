Like water to earth, spiders to dirt
My love's like a force that can't be disturbed
The more that it yearns, the more that it burns
More that a love like mine must be returned

No, I don't wanna see nobody but me
Next to you, it's much more than jealousy
It's the air that I breathe, fire in me
Baby, I'm not gonna stop

Till you're addicted2me like the sand to the sea
And everything that you see is a vision of me
You're addicted2me like a fatal disease
Until your love for me is a love like mine

Nobody got a love like mine for you
Nobody got a love like mine
Nobody got a love like mine
A love like mine

I'm here at your door down on the floor
Needin' you more and more
I'm so high for you
So high, so high, so high

Till you're addicted2me like the sand to the sea
And everything that you see is a vision of me
You're addicted2me like a fatal disease
Until your love for me is a love like mine

Nobody got a love like mine for you
Nobody got a love like mine
Nobody got a love like mine
A love like mine

Nobody got a love like mine for you
Nobody got a love like mine
Nobody got a love like mine
A love like mine

Got love in my eyes, a love like mine
Love in my soul, you make me whole
Got love in my eyes, a love like mine
Love in my soul, you make me whole

Till you're addicted2me like the sand to the sea
And everything that you see is a vision of me
You're addicted2me like a fatal disease
Until your love for me is a love like mine

Nobody got a love like mine for you
Nobody got a love like mine
Nobody got a love like mine
A love like mine

Nobody got a love like mine for you
Nobody got a love like mine
Nobody got a love like mine
A love like mine

(Addicted2me)
I got love in my eyes
(The disease)
I got love in my mind

(Addicted2me)
Got love in my soul
(The disease)
You make me whole
