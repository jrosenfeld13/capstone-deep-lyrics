All the words sound so accidental
Rise and fall like an old balloon
Oh, my words and my marble-heavy mind
Wasting time

All wasted on instructions
For you to carry me around
You pay me attentions
Then wave me off with a good bye

When you speak to me
I speak too pleasantly

Where's the knife? Where's the fire?
Run away like I'm some holiday
Where's the knife? Where's the fire?
Am I a saint or a liar?
Where's the knife? Where's the fire?

I won't question your opinion
I can't even disagree
You touch on all my troubles
Expecting nothing more from me

I am eager for your answer
It is just like some baby bird
My mouth is so wide open
For what you think you might have heard

When you speak to me
I speak too pleasantly

Where's the knife? Where's the fire?
Run away like I'm some holiday
Where's the knife? Where's the fire?
Am I a saint or a liar?
Where's the knife? Where's the fire?
