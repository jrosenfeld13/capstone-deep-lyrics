Wait for me by my dying chair
Tell God and the Devil meet me there
They can use my soul as a battle ground
But until then, they can leave me out

There is no wrong, no right
But there's a million constellations in the sky tonight
Take me down when you're feeling low
There will never be a place with you that I won't go
Let's let them say we're crazy
We may never know

Wait for me by your anywhere
And in a while I will meet you there
And if it hurts, least we're feeling now
Least if we feel then we live somehow

There is no wrong, no right
But there's a million constellations in the sky tonight
Take me down when you're feeling low
There will never be a place with you that I won't go
Let's let them say we're crazy
We may never know
