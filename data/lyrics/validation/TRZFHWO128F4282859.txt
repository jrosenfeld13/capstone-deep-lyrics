Written by Beverley and Colin Campsie

Someone turned the light out in my life
And I don't know if I can make it through the night
I'm afraid to wake tomorrow
With no one by my side
When all the words that broke my heart
Will still be on my mind
Love is the light
That filled my life with dreams
When it used to shine on me
Finally the spark has faded in the dark

I believed that love would find a way
Now I don't know if I could give it all again
After all the words of wisdom
That fill me with regret
I'd rather cry remembering
The times I can't forget

Love is the light
That filled my life with dreams
When it used to shine on me
Finally the spark has faded in the dark

Love is the light
That filled my life with dreams
When it used to shine on me
Finally the spark has faded

Love is the light
That filled my life with dreams
When it used to shine on me
