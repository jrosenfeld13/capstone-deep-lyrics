Can I lift my dress up for you?
Can I lift it in the night?
The white undersides of my thighs look much better
In the dark light
Theres a kid in there
And hes big and dumb
And hes kinda scared
And he's, well, hes too old to be there
Hes just looking for a ride

And Ill lift it to the ceiling tiles
Of stadiums and shrines
You see something to cheer about
Ill tell you that its mine
Im sorry that your mother died
But that one wasn't my fault
And Im sorry anybody dies at all, these days

So hold out all your knives away from my eyes
Hold out all your knives away from my eyes
