On The Beach
It's time to leave, this party's boring
I'd rather be alone with you
I found a place where we can go
Just the two of us will know
'Cause there's some things I'd like to do
Ooh, I want to
Woo you all night on the beach
'Cause we got all summer to learn how to love
On the beach
They don't expect us 'til tomorrow
I'll have us back again by two
We'll take the car and slip away
There'll be no one there to say
Just what we should and shouldn't do
Ooh, I want to
Oh, I want to
On the beach (on the beach)
I've waited so long to be there
We'll take the highway, just outside the city
'Cause the night's young and you're so pretty, yeah
Ooh, I wanna... ooh, I wanna... oh, I wanna
