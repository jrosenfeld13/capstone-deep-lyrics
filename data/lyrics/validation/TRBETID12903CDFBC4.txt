When you're near me I feel so romantic
When you're far away I'm always blue
If you want me to remain romantic
Here are all the things you'll have to do

Hold me,honey won't you hold me
Hold me never let me go
Take me,honey won't you take me
Never to forsake me cause I love you so
Thrill me,let your kisses thrill me
Just like you alone can do
Hold me ,tenderly enfold me
Never try to hold me away from you

Thrill me, let your kisses thrill me
Just like you alone can do
Hold me,tenderly enfold me
Never try to hold me away from you
