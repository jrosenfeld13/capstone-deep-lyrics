[Verse 1]
I'm gonna steal me a silver stallion
With not a mark upon his silky hide
Teach him he can trust me like a brother
One day we'll saddle up and ride

[Chorus]
And we're gonna ride, we're gonna ride
Ride like the one eyed jack of diamonds
With the devil close behind
We're gonna ride

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna find me a reckless woman
Razor blades and dice in her eyes
Just a touch of sadness in her fingers
Thunder and lightening in her thighs

[Chorus]
And we're gonna ride, we're gonna ride
Ride like the one eyed jack of diamonds
With the devil close behind
We're gonna ride

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna chase the sky forever
With the woman and the stallion and the wind
And the sun is gonna burn into a cinder
Before we ever pass this way again

[Chorus]
And we're gonna ride, we're gonna ride
Ride like the one eyed jack of diamonds
With the devil close behind
We're gonna ride
