Oooh I didn't talk too much in fact not at lot
Oh but to ask her the price I was to be no fool
Money's no time to waste or to shoot up the wall
You got the know how the place teacher take me to your school

She lead the way from the alley back to her house
Must not be seen going in must not be seen coming out
She said I looked mighty but thin she told me
"I'm gonna give you a second helping"

Ooh Razor Blade Alley I've been there
Razor Blade Alley neither of us cared
It was the prime time but the wrong place
It was my first time I hope my last taste

I'm just too shy to check in but this pain of pissing razors is cutting in

Mmm felt like a knight without shining armour on
At the time she thought she was in a dream
Floating up on cloud nine now I awake
She is nowhere but the razor cuts deeper everywhere
