I see a long blood stained corridor in front of my eyes
Walls all ripped and torn of lost souls trying to get out
I want to run - escape this
Leave all behind - this suffering
Run out of here - alone to be
I don't care they're all gone to me
All I feel now is mental disarray
Feeling claustrophobia while running in dismay
I'm not here to stay; running away
Hell awaits but not today
Smashing against the wall while running through this nightmarish hall
In this hell, tearing nails out while clawing the way up again
I want to run - escape this
Leave all behind - this suffering
Run out of here - alone to be
I don't care they're all gone to me
All I feel now is mental disarray
Feeling claustrophobia while running in dismay
I'm not here to stay; running away
Hell awaits but not today
No matter what's ahead
Always smashed into another dead end
The air smells rusty and stale
My body feels cold and pale
Run
I want to run - escape this
Leave all behind - this suffering
Run out of here - alone to be
I don't care they're all gone to me
All I feel now is mental disarray
Feeling claustrophobia while running in dismay
I'm not here to stay; running away
Hell awaits but not today
Feeling the pain once more and illness growth flowing in the air
Screaming in horror, mind in fear, take me away from the hell that's here
