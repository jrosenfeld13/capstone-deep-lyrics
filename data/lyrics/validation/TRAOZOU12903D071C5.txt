Thorn In My Pride (Dizzy Mizz Lizzy)
(Track 1 on "Rotator")

Bring me water
Bring me something shorter
Bring me anything I need
Take my power
Take my darkest hour
Take my non existent greed

Thorn in my pride
Thorn in my pride
When you're by my side
A thorn gets in my pride

I deny you
If I cannot hide you
It's a shame but it's the truth
So stop your cryin'
'cause blame it on my youth

Thorn in my pride
Thorn in my pride
When you're by my side
A thorn gets in my pride
