[Intro]
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
We must get to the point
We are all gathered here tonight
Under one roof
To ban together
Through the new sound
One and all
This is the new way
We are
The Omge

Yeah, yeah, yeah!

[Verse 1]
Bond together
With this sound
We're gonna break it, break down walls
We're gonna, we're gonna bring 'em down
You're gonna get it
And everything you think is right is really wrong
Oh, it's really wrong
We're gonna get it together (x2)
We're gonna get it to go

Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
In the matter of things
This is how we sing
See the people rise
We cut 'em down a size
Just one more try
For all of our lost minds
Time moves to slow
We're gonna get it to go

[Bridge]
And makin' it right
We're gonna make it right
You're gonna get it
You're gonna get it
You're gonna get it
(It's all right)

Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
In the matter of things
This is how we sing
See the people rise
We cut 'em down a size
Just one more try
For all of our lost minds
Time moves to slow
We're gonna get it to go
In the matter of things
This is how we sing
See the people rise
We cut 'em down a size
Just one more ride
For our foolish minds
Time moves to slow
We're gonna get it to go

[Outro]
(Ah, ah, oh, oh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Get it to go
We're gonna get it to go
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
All right, all right, all right...
We're gonna get it to go
