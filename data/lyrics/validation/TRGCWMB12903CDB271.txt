I know a man and his friend
And I know them well
I think they're kind of strange
But it's hard to tell
They've got a box full of secrets
That they're giving away
I received a tape
And I heard it play

Trails of colour dissolve
In your mind
The gates of evil
The paths we find
You're so self assured
It's just a game you play
And we're not gonna do a thing that they say

Kind of strange
Kind of crazy
Kind of out of touch
Into something that's nothing
If nothing's that much
Oh if nothing's that much
To you
Why try to hide
The things that are true
Wouldn't it be
Fair to say
That you're not gonna do a thing that they say
I know a man and his friend
And I know them well
I think they're kind of strange
But it's hard to tell

Trails of colour dissolve
In your mind
The gates of evil
The paths we find
You're so self assured
It's just a game you play
And we're not gonna do a thing that they say
