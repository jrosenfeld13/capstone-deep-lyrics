[Chloe Dancer]
Chloe don't know better
Chloe is just like me, only beautiful
A couple of years' difference
But those lessons never learned
Did you know?

Chloe dances the tables in the French Quarter
She's always been given
So I can't always make her laugh
But I'm proud to say
And I won't forget

The time spent layin' by her side
The time spent layin' by her side
Dreams like this must die
And a dream like this must die
Dream like this must

[Crown of Thorns]
You ever heard the story of Mr. Faded Glory?
Say he who rides a pony must someday fall
Talkin' to my altar, say life is what you make it
And if you make it death, well rest your soul away
Away, away, yeah, child

It's a broken kind of feelin', she'd have to tie me to the ceilin'
A bad moon's a comin', better say your prayers, child
I wanna tell you that I love you but does it really matter?
I just can't stand to see you draggin' down again, again
My baby again, oh, yeah

So I'm singin'
And this is my kinda love
It's the kind that moves on
It's the kind that leaves me alone
Yes, it does
And this is my kinda love
It's the kind that moves on
It's the kind that leaves me alone

I used to treat you like a lady, now you're a substitute teacher
This bottle's not a pretty, not a pretty sight
I owe the man some money, so I'm turnin' over honey
You see, Mr. Faded Glory is once again doin' time, oh yeah

And this is my kinda love
It's the kind that moves on
It's the kind the leaves me alone
Yes, it does
And this is my kinda love
It's the kind that moves on
It's the kind that, it's the kind that
It leaves me alone, yeah

Like a crown of thorns
It's all who you know, yeah
So don't burn your bridges woman
'Cause someday, yeah

Kick it, oh yeah

And this is my kinda love
It's the kind that moves on
It's the kind that leaves me alone, yeah

This is my kinda love
It's the kind that moves on
It's the kind that, it's the kind that, yeah, yeah

Baby
I said com' on, com' on, com' on
Com' on yeah
I said baby
Don't burn your bridges, woman
Don't come back here
I said good times
I said tu tu tu
