So, you've been trying to get ahead
But coming up empty handed
Losing all those friends you made instead
Oh you pushed your way up to the top
You got so tall you had to stop
Did you squint to see who you were stepping on?
It's your secret to success
That's causing such a mess
And to be honest
Forgetting all of us
Now that is just Bad Business
You think you're worth your weight in gold
While everybody's looking like the color of money
We knew you when and we don't really think it's funny
OK I'm just hoping for that day when your business life comes to an end
Deal with us just like people again
And you're just scheming on success
But only coming up with meager messiness
Oh you can sell sell sell
And never do well
When dealing in Bad Business
If you're plainning to invest
Well anyday now we'll be coming to collect
Oh yeah- well you can sell sell sell
And never do well
When dealing in Bad Business
