[Verse 1]
There's four cruisers
Flashing in my rear view
And they're not gonna take me out
I'd watch it - what'd you do now?
There's four cruisers
Weighing on my conscience
There's one thing for sure:
This is not a fucking love song

[Chorus]
My fear is gone, and still I don't know why
I've waited for so long to let you know (I'm not going back)
That this is all your fault, and there's no one left to blame
Did you think we'd make it out?
Did you know?
Do you know?
Oh
Yeah!

[Verse 2]
Somewhere out there
There's a man on the ground
Who ain't living anymore
And his name
Is written on my knuckles
Take me
Take my fucking burden

[Verse 3]
There's four cruisers
Flashing in my rear view
They're never gonna take me out
I'd watch it - what'd you do?
In each cruiser
Is a man with his six-gun
And his fancy little bullets
With my name on 'em

[Chorus]
My fear is gone, and still I don't know why
I've waited for so long to let you know (I'm not going back)
That this was all your fault, and there's no one left to blame
Did you even think this out? Did you know?

[Bridge]
Hey hey, ho ho
Wild chase to the open road
Hey hey, ho ho
This car's too fucking slow
Hey hey, ho ho
Wild chase to the open road
Hey hey, ho ho
This car's too fucking slow
Don't know where I'm going
But not slowing down
And I'll die before I stop this fucking car
Street lights, white lines
This is all I have left
This is all I have

[Outro]
Flashing lights and racing hearts
Will you ever just slow down?
How did we end up here?
And all those sirens are getting louder
Flashing lights and racing hearts
I don't think we're gonna make it out
This won't end well (make it out...)
This won't end well
