Wallpaper for the soul
To keep away from the black hole
In my heart there's plenty of room
For everyone to kill the gloom
Don't worry too much about what to say
The words would have come anyway

Follow me
To the house of the free

Wallpaper for the soul
Like the one stole
A long time ago

Wallpaper for the soul
Seeing life through the keyhole
And you don't want to go

A piece of sunshine a piece a of gold
Like a secret never told

A piece of sunshine a piece of gold
Wallpaper for the soul

In your heart there's plenty of room
For everyone to kill the gloom

Wallpaper for the soul
