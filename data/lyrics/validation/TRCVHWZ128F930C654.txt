Hey babe, you got something for me
Place another two in the crown
Hey babe, that's really something to see
A vision lighting up all the town
I hear a call from above say "The beast must die"
You want to crawl away, don't even think about it

Inside your head, eat your meds
I'm tired of keeping away
Paint your mole, wait for goal
You need a slap in the face

Let's talk about love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
I know you love yourself
Right on, you got it so tightened up
And I'm so blown away by your fucking cool
I hear a call from above say "The beast must die"
You want to crawl away, don't even think about it

Inside your head, eat your meds
I'm tired of keeping away
Paint your mole, wait for goal
You need a slap in the face
With your chain pot smoking, my head working
I want a piece of the cake
Inside your head, eat your meds
You need a slap in the face

I'm so blown away by your style and your cool
I'm so blown away by your style and your cool
I'm so blown away by your style and your cool
I'm so blown away by your style and your cool

Inside your head, eat your meds
I'm tired of keeping away
Paint your mole, wait for goal
You need a slap in the face
With your chain pot smoking, my head working
I want a piece of the cake
Inside your head, eat your meds
You need a slap in the face
