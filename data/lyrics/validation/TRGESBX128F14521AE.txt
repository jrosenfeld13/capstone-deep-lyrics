Are you the tornado in my sails
Are you Jesus without the nails
Are you the bury met without the rails
Are you Paris without snails
Of course you're not
But you're all I've got
And that's fine & dandy
When you lick my candy girl
(And I don't mean that rude)
When you lick my
When you lick my candy
Are you Disneyland without whales
Are you a farmer without bales
Are you the red lion without ales
Are you the lakes without the dales
Naturally you're not
But you're all I've got
And that's fine & dandy
When lick my candy girl
(And I don't mean that rude)
When you lick my
When you lick my candy
Are you Ra without Dion
Are you the words in the sky without neon
Are you indigenous or did you disappear
Are you the lime in my bottleneck of beer
Candy candy candy girl...
