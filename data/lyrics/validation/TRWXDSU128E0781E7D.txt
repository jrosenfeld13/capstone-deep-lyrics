New brat in town
New brat in town
Who's been found
Counting aloud
When there's a new brat in town

Your precious things
Your precious dear
And a chat show host
Went and cut the throat
Of an off-shore engineer

Hey, hey
Yeah, yeah
Assumed a crucifix
Hey, hey
Yeah, yeah
You are the proper one

New brat in town
New brat in town

I'll give you half an hour
Make a phone call, pack a suitcase
Break your fingers, shut the door and don't be late
I give you half an hour
New brat in town
Got the bully boys out and twenty pound of hate

She's an acrobatic kid
High-flyer as a child
Been eaten alive
Time, time, time, time
You're doing fine

Hey, hey
Yeah, yeah
Assumed a crucifix
Hey, hey
Yeah, yeah
You are the proper one

New brat in town
New brat in town
New brat in town
New brat in town

Hsssssssssssss
