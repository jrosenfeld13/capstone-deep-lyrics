[Verse 1]
So he would sulk and drink and mope
And cross his arms and hope to die
And then a fairy came one night
To bring this sorry boy to life
She pulled some strings and spun him about
That boy sprang up and began to shout
"My arms, my legs, my heart, my face they're alive!"
And she would cry, "Liar, liar!
What have I done?
You're no lover, and I'm no fighter."

(The story goes on)

[Verse 2]
So he would buy her things and kiss her hair
To show he was for real
And she would take those gifts and kisses
Though just stringing him along
She knew about those wooden boys
It's an empty love to fill the void
"Pinocchio! Oh boy, how your nose has grown!"
So he would cry, "Liar, liar!
I'll prove it to you!"
But then it grew
He had grown tired of her

[Bridge/Outro]
So it was true
He left her apartment
And he walked all night long
Until he was stopped by the shore of the ocean
But still he walked on, amongst the whales
And the waves, and screamed
"Liar, liar!"
And his wooden body floated away
He just drifted away

And now I wonder how I was made
Now I wonder how I was made
My arms, my legs, my heart, my face
My name is Driftwood
