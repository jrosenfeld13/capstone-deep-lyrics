Without an invitation
It used to be more fun
Surveillance through the dry brush
You knew the art of ring and run
And hid behind the T-bird
Unless the door would open first
You had a talent for excuses
An innocent who'd been coerced
You had to have it all rehearsed when

Knocking at the big house
Knocking at the big house

It always seemed the easiest
When it didn't mean that much
Though you welcomed competition
You had an ace no one could touch
But didn't have a short clue
That this gift's a given thing
Call it camouflage or filthy rags
It was not enough to let it ring
You had to sign this offering by

Knocking at the big house
Knocking at the big house

Now there's nothing to conceal you
You come in from the front
The hedges have been cut back
And you're much too old for scavenger hunt
Maybe you're collecting
Donations for the cause
It may be now or never
So let it ring
Don't you pause
You are not breaking any laws by

Knocking at the big house
Knocking at the big house

Well, keep your eye up to the keyhole
What do you see now
You'll be

Knocking at the big house
Knocking at the big house
Knocking at the big house
Knocking at the big house
