It's raining at the border, tears of love like blood spilt
Stagnant on the carpet
It's raining and another filthy widow watches
And the self is no friend and all enemies attack from within
Way down deep, you know why
The darkness is separated by a slow, red river
Night sneaks into sleepy corners
I lay at the edge of a field of fire
Thousand ghosts in my dusty bed, with thousand ghosts
Way down deep you know why

The earth spits threadbare it's shallow daughters who
Tread like broken tramps, damp on stone cold stares and
Deep within The fear of a hundred lonely victims down
The fear of a hundred lonely victims down
Way deep down you know why

I will listen for your baited steps like shadows in the
Hall that fall slowly and trace the shutters of your
Hollow thoughts and beat my heart against these walls
And beat my heart, it's raining at the border, tears of blood

It's raining
It's raining
Tears of blood

It's raining
It's raining
Tears of blood
