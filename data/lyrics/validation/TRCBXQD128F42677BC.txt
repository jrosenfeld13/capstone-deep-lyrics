I'm going to tell you about it here
I can't remember how old I was
When Mama said to me
If it makes you happy, son
Then be what you want to be
Now, Lord, that my arms they're reaching for the sky
The people I thought were my friends are starting to wonder why
And I say

Chorus:
Have some trust in your old friend, baby
I'll be around if you need a helping hand

I've traveled around
Lord, playing my songs almost for free
If you're wondering what it's worth, it means the world to me
Now all they do is turn their heads when I walk by
I can't see why they don't understand, hell, they just wondering why
And I say

Chorus:
Have some trust in your old friend, baby
I'll be around if you need a helping hand

The time has come for me to say these words to all of you
Y'all always trusted me before, well I am doing what I got to do
You talk about me behind my back and play your foolish games
But when it comes to real trust, baby
It's worth much more than fame

Have some trust in your old friend, baby
I'll be around if you need a helping hand
(REPEAT)
