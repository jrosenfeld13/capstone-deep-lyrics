[Verse 1]
I come awake
With a gift for womankind
You're still asleep
But the gift don't seem to mind
Rise on this occasion
Halfway up your back
Sliding down your body
Touching your behind

You look so self-possessed
I won't disturb your rest
It's lovely when you're sleeping
But wide awake is best

[Chorus]
Wake up and make love with me
Wake up and make love
Wake up and make love with me
I don't want to make you
I'll let the fancy take you
And you'll wake up and make love

[Verse 2]
You come awake
In a horny morning mood
And have a proper wriggle
In the naughty naked nude
Roll against my body
Get me where you want me
What happens next is private
It's also very rude

I'll go and get the post
And make some tea and toast
You have another sleep, love
It's me that needs it most

[Chorus]
Wake up and make love with me
Wake up and make love
Wake up and make love with me
Wake up and make love
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
