You called and so I came
To turn the night on
So turn the lights off
My work is never done

I guess I'll take the blame
For turning the night on
And you can let your guard down
Toe to toe and One on One

So many choices in the world
So many boys so many girls (x4)

It ain't easy (x3)
It's harder than it looks

It's my claim to fame
I keep turning the night on
And getting yoru mind off
And making you come undone

Well it looks like you're having fun
Since I'm turning the night on
You can get your feet wet
You gotta walk before you run

So many choices in this world
So many boys so many girls (x4)

It ain't easy (x3)
It's harder than it looks

It's the story of my life
I've been turning the night on
You'll never forget me
When the morning comes

So many choices in this world
So many boys so many girls (x4)

It ain't easy (x3)
It's harder than it looks
