[Chorus]
You're wasting your time
Trying to tear us two apart
You can't stop our plans
We were destined from the start
He loves me
I love him
And even though were young at heart
You're the one in denial

Tired of creeping around when I'm craving for
His kiss
Whenever I'm lonely he is the only one
I miss
You say it ain't right but I think that you got it wrong
Its bliss
And I love him yeah yeah
I love him

He makes me go oo-oo-ooooo
When he looks at me
Oo-ooo-ooo
And it's plain to see
Nothing you can do-oo-ooooo
To discourage me
And I love him
I really love him

[Chorus]
My parents say I'm too good and that he doesn't deserve me
My friends think he's not cool enough so they'd rather desert me
My sister says her boyfriend has a brother and she'll introduce me
But I don't want him, no
I've got my man

There's nothing you can do-oo-oooo
To discourage me
I'm cool with my man's family
If you were in my shoes
You'd feel differently
But you're in denial
You're in denial

[Chorus]
You're the one in denial
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one in denial

Said I would cry for him
Lie for him
Hell I'd even die for him
Cry for him
Lie for him
Hell I'd even die for him
Cry for him
Lie for him
Hell I'd even die for him

[Chorus 2x]
