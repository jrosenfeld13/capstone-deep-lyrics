It seems like years ago
That the headlines read

Lord Lucan Is Missing
Lord Lucan Is Missing

Lord Lucan Is Missing
Lord Lucan Is Missing
Lord Lucan Is Missing
Lord Lucan Is Missing

Fleet Street looked everywhere
And the police did too

Lord Lucan Is Missing
Lord Lucan Is Missing

Lord Lucan Is Missing
Lord Lucan Is Missing
Lord Lucan Is Missing
Lord Lucan Is Missing

Is he in the Clement Club?
Or in the South Of France?
Playing on a roulette wheel
In annother game of chance

Lord Lucan Is Missing
Lord Lucan Is Missing

Lord Lucan Is Missing
Lord Lucan Is Missing
Lord Lucan Is Missing
Lord Lucan Is Missing
