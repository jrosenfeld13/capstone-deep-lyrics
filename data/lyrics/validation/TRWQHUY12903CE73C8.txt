How did you come to this strategy?
Do you want to show us the reality?
But all your messages are meaningless
And provocation is not your business

You are the sucking sponges in our brains
You are the cold acid in our veins

Dance dance dance to the violence
Sing sing sing to the killing
United colours of perversity
United colours of perversity

The most stupid bastards of your shop
Will even know how to achieve the aims
Advertise for the things you sell, advertise
But no pictures of an overground hell

You are the sucking sponges in our brains
You are the cold acid in our veins

Dance dance dance to the violence
Sing sing sing to the killing
United colours of perversity
United colours of perversity

Sweet and sour, contrasts do attract?
