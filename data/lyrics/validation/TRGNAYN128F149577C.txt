No Match (For That Old Flame)
(Rhett Akinslarry Boonepaul Nelson)
Remember when you told me you were over him
Well girl I know you never mean to lie
But every time that we go out and he walks in
You say hello like you never said goodbye
And that old spark gets in your eye
Guess I'm no match for that old flame
Lord he left a memory that I can't love away
All fires don't burn the same
And I'm no match for that old flame
I know you say that this is all just in my head
Well girl you know I want that to be true
And though you say your love for him is long since dead
You come alive every time he looks at you
And I have to face the cold hard truth
That I'm no match for that old flame
Lord he left a memory that I can't love away
All fires don't burn the same
And I'm no match for that old flame
I'm no match for that old flame
Lord he left a memory that I can't love away
All fires, they don't burn the same
And I'm no match, I'm no match for that old flame
