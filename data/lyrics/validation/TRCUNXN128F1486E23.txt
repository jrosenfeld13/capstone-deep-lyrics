I awake to the drip drop of icicles
Melting outside my window
Everything was new

I had noticed a bird and seen
Cherry blossom was falling like confetti
What is happening to me these days?

I, I got intuition, oh I, I had my suspicions
I'm in love with you
It feels like springtime

Emeraldine, apple seed, olive green intense
Colors unfurl like petals in a time lapse sequence
Feels like something in embryo
My heart melts like two inches of snow in April's glow

What's this urgency? What's this heat I'm feeling?
Could I say I'm dreaming?
Do I change my ways?
What is happening to me these days?

I, I got intuition, oh I, I had my suspicions
I'm in love with you
I, I got intuition, oh I, I had my suspicions
I'm in love with you
It feels like springtime
