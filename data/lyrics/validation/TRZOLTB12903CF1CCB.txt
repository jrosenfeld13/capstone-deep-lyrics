Here I go again
A vicious cycle without end
Seeking distance for security
Desperate act to remain free
A balance point cannot be found
This whole thing will come crashing down
(Down! Down!)
My fear will drag you down
Into this world that I create
Your love for me has sealed your fate
(Down! Down!)
My fear will drag you down
Can I trust in what I feel?
Praying that this time it's real
(Feel the strain)
All this time's been spent in vain
(My name)
Open wounds that still remain
(Decay)
As my faith is stripped away
(You'll say)
The final price I have to pay
Diggin' in deeper still
The hollowness I yearn to fill
The story always ends the same
The cycle soon begins again
A balance point cannot be found
This whole thing will come crashing down
(Down! Down!)
My fear will drag you down
Into this world that I create
Your love for me has sealed your fate
(Down! Down!)
My fear will drag you down
Can I trust in what I feel?
Praying that this time it's real
(Feel the strain)
All this time's been spent in vain
(My name)
Open wounds that still remain
(Decay)
As my faith is stripped away
(You'll say)
The final price I have to pay
(Feel the strain)
All this time's been spent in vain
(My name)
Open wounds that still remain
(Decay)
As my faith is stripped away
(You'll say)
The final price I have to pay
Diggin' in deeper still
(I've to pay)
The hollowness I yearn to fill
(The final price I've to pay)
The story always ends the same
(The final price I've to pay)
Stepping outside the circle
Stepping outside the circle
Stepping outside the circle
Stepping outside the circle
Stepping
