Damage is done
You've had all your fun
The ending's begun
The enemy has won
Walking off a cliff again

You've used all your tricks
Your lies don't stick
You don't want to admit
You're done
Walking off a cliff again

Keep your hat on tight
'Cause you don't wanna die
And if you do, you don't
Want to die out of style
You're not worth my while

The damage is done
You've had all your fun
The ending's begun
The enemy has won
Walking off a cliff again

You've used all your tricks
Your lies don't stick
You don't want to admit
You're done
Walking off a cliff again

Keep your hat on tight
'Cause you don't wanna die
And if you do, you don't
Want to die out of style
You're not worth my while
