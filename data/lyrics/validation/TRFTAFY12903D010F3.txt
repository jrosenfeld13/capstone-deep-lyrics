[Verse 1]
Stay by me, stay by me
You are the one, my only true love
The butcherbird makes its noise
And asks you to agree
With its brutal nesting habits
And its pointless savagery
Now, the nightingale sings to you
And raises up the ante
I put one hand on your round ripe heart
And the other down your panties

[Chorus]
Everything is falling, dear
Everything is wrong
It's just history repeating itself
And babe, you turn me on

Like a light bulb, babe
Like a song

[Verse 2]
You race naked through the wilderness
You torment the birds and the bees
You leapt into the abyss, but find
It only goes up to your knees
I move stealthily from tree to tree
I shadow you for hours
I make like I'm a little deer
Grazing on the flowers

[Chorus]
Everything is collapsing, dear
All moral sense has gone
It's just history repeating itself
And babe, you turn me on

Like an idea, babe
Like an atom bomb

[Verse 3]
We stand awed inside a clearing
We do not make a sound
The crimson snow falls all about
Carpeting the ground

[Chorus]
Everything is falling, dear
All rhyme and reason gone
It's just history repeating itself
And, babe, you turn me on
