No one had taken notice of her smile
No one had spotted her tears
No one had deemed her good or vile
No one had calmed her fears

But she brought me a golden heart
On a velvet chain
You know we'll never be apart
Or experience pain

She whispered
Never be apart
Never going back to the start
Experience pain
Never again

No one had taken notice of my smile
No one had spotted my tears
No one had deemed me good or vile
No one had calmed my fears

But her blood lives inside me
In every vain
She shows me what I can not see
Keeps me sane

She whispered
Never be apart
Never going back to the start
Experience pain
Never again
