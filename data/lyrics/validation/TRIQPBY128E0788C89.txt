(Riperton - Rudolph - Thedford)

I'm silk and satin
And I know child and lover's pain
But don't be fooled 'cause I'm tender hearted
I'm stronger than a hurricane

I like fire, I like ice
I can cut you like a knife
But I'd rather be nice
I'm a woman

So don't push and don't shove
What you want there's plenty of
I was born to make love
I'm a woman

Hot nights... dripping passion
Lead you to my bed of flames
Leave your world enter my enchantment
And I will love you wild and un-restrained
