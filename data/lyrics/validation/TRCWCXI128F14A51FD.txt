I WROTE TO YOU SOMEWHERE IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA
A POET'S HEART IN THE EYE OF A HURRICANE
I STRUGGLE WITH FINDING WORDS TO SING THESE DAYS I SAID
AS IF MY THOUGHTS ARE WAITING IN THE WINGS
FOR THE STAGE TO CLEAR

AND YOU IN YOUR ELEGANCE AND HUMOR FILL THE ROOM
YOUR LOVE AND YOUR CONCERN
YOUR ANGER AT THE INJUSTICE OF MAN'S NARROWNESS AND FEAR
I THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE

YOU WROTE OF LOVE FROM THE COAST OF MENDOCINO
A POET'S HEART CRYING A FIGHTER'S TEARS
THE CHILDREN OF YOUR BODY SPREAD OUT ACROSS THIS EARTH
LIKE MESSAGES WRITTEN ACROSS TIME
MEASURING THE YEARS

AND YOU IN YOUR ELEGANCE AND HUMOR FILL THE ROOM
YOUR LOVE AND YOUR CONCERN
YOUR ANGER AT THE INJUSTICE OF MAN'S NARROWNESS AND FEAR
I THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE

I HEARD YOUR SONGS REACH OUT TO CALIFORNIA
A POET'S HEART LOCKED IN THE COEUR D'ALENE
OF THE OLD MEN AND THE BOOZE SINGING OUT THE TRUTH IN LIVES
OF FORGIVENESS AND LOYALTIES TO FRIENDS
CONSTANT AS THE ENDLESS RAILROAD TIES

AND YOU IN YOUR ELEGANCE AND HUMOR FILL THE ROOM
YOUR LOVE AND YOUR CONCERN
YOUR ANGER AT THE INJUSTICE OF MAN'S NARROWNESS AND FEAR
I THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE

SO HERE WE ARE JOINED FINALLY BY OUR WORDS
ALL POET'S HEARTS CLOSE THOUGH FAR APART
I REMEMBER HOW YOU SAID THAT LANGUAGE IS A KNIFE
THAT SPREADS WHAT WE FEEL ACROSS THE DRY CRUST
OF SOMEONE'S HEART

AND YOU IN YOUR ELEGANCE AND HUMOR FILL THE ROOM
YOUR LOVE AND YOUR CONCERN
YOUR ANGER AT THE INJUSTICE OF MAN'S NARROWNESS AND FEAR
I THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE
