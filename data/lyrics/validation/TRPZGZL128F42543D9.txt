This is the end you know
Lady, the plans we had went all wrong
We ain't nothing but fight and shout and tears

We got to a point I can't stand
I've had it to the limit, I can't be your man
I ain't more than a minute away from walking

We can't cry the pain away
We can't find a need to stay
I slowly realized there's nothing on our side

Out of my life, out of my mind
Out of the tears that we can't deny
We need to swallow all our pride
And leave this mess behind

Out of my head, out of my bed
Out of the dreams we had, they're bad
Tell them it's me who made you sad
Tell them the fairytale gone bad

This is the end
You know

This is the end you know
Lady, the plans we had went all wrong
We ain't nothing but fight and shout and tears

We got to a point I can't stand
I've had it to the limit, I can't be your man
I ain't more than a minute away from walking

We can't cry the pain away
We can't find a need to stay
I slowly realized there's nothing on our side

Out of my life, out of my mind
Out of the tears that we can't deny
We need to swallow all our pride
And leave this mess behind

Out of my head, out of my bed
Out of the dreams we had, they're bad
Tell them it's me who made you sad
Tell them the fairytale gone bad
