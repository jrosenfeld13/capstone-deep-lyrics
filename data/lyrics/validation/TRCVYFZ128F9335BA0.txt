[Verse 1]
You do something to me
Something that simply mystifies me
Tell me, why should it be
You have the power to hypnotize me?

[Verse 2]
Let me live 'neath your spell
Do do that voodoo that you do so well
For you do something to me
That nobody else can do

[Verse 2 Reprise]
Let me live 'neath your spell
Do do that voodoo that you do so well
For you do something to me
That nobody else can do
That nobody else can do
