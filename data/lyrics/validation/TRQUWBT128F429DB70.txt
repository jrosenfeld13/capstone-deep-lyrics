My taste's a little strange
I've been told
You're the kind of person
I want to hold
You'll never be a picture
I don't care
I've been looking out for you
Everywhere
Be my lover now
Be my lover now
You make me feel so hot
I want you so
Will I always love you?
I don't know
There may be no tomorrow
Anyway
Let's forget the future
And live today
Be my lover now
Be my lover now
I'm tried of trying
Tired of lying
Letting pride get in my way
I'm going to speak true
I really want you
I've got nothing else to say
Be my lover now
Be my lover now
Be my lover now
Be my lover now
I'm tried of trying
Tired of lying
Letting pride get in my way
I'm going to speak true
I really want you
I've got nothing else to say
Be my lover now
Be my lover now
Be my lover now
Be my lover now
So if you need somebody
Just let it flow
I'm waiting for your answer
Let me know
I want to be your lover
Right away
If you want me, baby
You've got to say
Be my lover now
Be my lover now
Be my lover now
Be my lover now
Be my lover now
Be my lover now
