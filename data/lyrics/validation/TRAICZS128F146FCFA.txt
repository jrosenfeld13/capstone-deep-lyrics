Not too long ago
You said you'd love me 'til the end
But lately you're indifferent
And I can't even be your friend

If I'm really such a bore
And you don't love me any more
Leave my heart
So I can smile again

Untie me
(Untie me)
Untie me, baby
(Untie me)

You're not ever there
When I need you
I don't know what to say
Or what to do, so untie me

If you found a new love
I won't put the blame on you
But if you found a true love
Just let me start my life anew

If I'm really such a bore
And you don't want me anymore
Leave my heart
So I can smile again

And untie me
Untie me, baby

You're not ever there
When I need you
You don't care what I say
Or what I do, so untie me
