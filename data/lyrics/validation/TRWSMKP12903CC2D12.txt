[Chorus]

Take a breath and catch up
To know you aint alone and somebody gives a fuck
Not everyones selfish, there are those who care
And this call is for all of those out there

They want a shout out yeah raise their cups
A toast to the common man, please stand up
I feel what youre feeling too, been there yup
Imma drink what youre drinking to, tip your cup

[Verse 1]
No matter what beneath the surface
We all hurting and the stress aint worth it
Its a bad time in life but the shit aint curtains
Just a little bit of peace all we need for certain
Banks is failing and Wall Street crumbling
And all those in charge they twiddle their thumbs bumbling
While the dollars that they heard is numbering
Double by the second leaving my folks wondering
Whats left for the people like us
Who cook, who clean, who ride the bus
Who live life with hope in a higher trust
And when head hits the pillow with a tired thrust
What about the ones who deal with news
Who deal with injustice and sing the blues
It all depends on which path you choose
I choose now go easy this ones for you

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
So listen hey hey, there aint no maybe
Live most of my life just south of crazy
And no I was not a pampered baby
The spoon was rusted and the TV hazy
The jeans were faded, the gold was plated
More than common, I was underrated
Thats when my lifestyle became sedated
Eyes half-closed, listen its cool because Im faded
Forget all that made me hated
Had a smooth knack for playing the low and downgraded
But this time I contemplated through knowledge downwind ? and created
This song for ones like me who wanna live their life and be let be
Who survive most days on a hope that cope
And not end up on dope or the end of a rope

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Liz with the lies and the game life playing
I dont know it all but I speak the truth Im saying
Every night bow my head and to the sky Im praying
About conflict and message and the rhymes Im laying
I got a few things thats been on my mind
Like the cause of poverty, the rise in crime
The homeless rate, unemployment climbs
And were reminded every hour its a volatile time
So where the complaint box Imma stand in line
Imma send it by post, SMS, online
Tell em all the job theyre doing aint fine
They think theyre high on the hog, theyre really just swine
While we struggle to find the time
Just smile a little, enjoy some wine
And do believe me, Im down for mine
Im down for yours too now relax, unwind

[Chorus]
