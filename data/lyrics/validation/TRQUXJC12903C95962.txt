(Verse 1)
Everyday I get a little closer
And everything I'm made of
Starts to melt away
I see the signs
But I can't quite
Make the words out
All I want is to be near you
But I'll push you away

(Pre-Chorus)
I just want to get away
But I hurt you every day

(Chorus)
The part that hurts the most
The part that hurts the most (is me)
The most (is you)
It's everything I do without you
The part that hurts the most
The part that hurts the most (is me)
The most (is you)
It's everything I do without you

(Verse 2)
Every chance I get I'm movin' closer
I know I'm not supposed to
But I can't break away
I see the signs
But I can't quite
Make the words out
All I want is to be near you
But I'll push you away

(Pre-Chorus)

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
I hate talkin' about it
Try to lose it but instead I found it
I just want you to know
I couldn't love anyone more

(Bridge)
No! Stay away from me!
Get up! I'm tryin' to walk away
It just won't let up!
No! Stay away from me!
Get up! I'm tryin' to walk away
It just won't let up!

No! Stay away from me!
Get up! I'm tryin' to walk away
It just won't let up!
No! Stay away from me!
Get up! I'm tryin' to walk away
It just won't let up!

(Chorus)
The part that hurts the most
The part that hurts the most (is me)
The most (is you)
It's everything I do without you
The part that hurts the most
The part that hurts the most (is me)
The most (is you)
It's everything I do without you (x2)
