Oh, my friend what have they done to you?
Held you down until you liked the view
Strangers on the street, they mock you
Phantoms in your sleep might shock you

I don't want to be the one to hold you down
I don't want to be the one to turn away
I don't want to play wolf when you call
'Cause tears won't help at all

Oh, Delilah is the message clear?
It's been raining down for years and years
Never said I was a saint
The whiskers they betray the greasepaint (ch)

Oh the answer to my greatest fears
Oh the reason for the wasted years
So in love with your own pain
You stay inside and pray for rain
Where losers always win the game
You fall in love with your own shame (ch)
