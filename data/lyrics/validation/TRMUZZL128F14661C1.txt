[Intro]
I'll lead you

[Chorus]
Don't look at me if you're looking for perfection
Don't look at me, I will only let you down
I'll do my best to point you in the right direction
But don't look at me, no, no, no
Don't look at me, look at Him

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I have a fear that you will see a mirror
And get the thought that it's the main attraction
But all that you detect is just what I reflect
Of the object of my own affection

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll lead you, I'll lead you to the One I found
He'll give you everything you need
All you need

[Chorus]
Don't look at me if you're looking for perfection
Don't look at me, I will only let you down
I'll do my best to point you in the right direction
But don't look at me, no, no, no
Don't look at me, look at Him

[Verse 2]
Oh, it's understandable to want a hero
But people can't meet all your expectations
Still some can teach you things about the love He brings
Just know the source of life is in the Savior

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll lead you, I'll lead you to the One I found
He'll give you everything you need
All you need

[Chorus]
Don't look at me if you're looking for perfection
Don't look at me I will only let you down
I'll do my best to point you in the right direction
But don't look at me, no, no, no
Don't look at me, look at Him

[Bridge]
He's the One who lived a perfect life
He's the One who always gets it right
He's the One and only guiding light, ohh yeah
He is everything you want to be
He's the answer to your every need
If you follow Him then you will see He's like no other, ohh yeah
Ooh yeah

[Chorus]
I'll do my best to point you in the right direction
But don't look at me, no, no, no
Don't look at me, oh, don't look at me
I'll only let you down
I'll do my best to point you in the right direction
But don't look at me, no, no, no
Don't look at me, look at Him
