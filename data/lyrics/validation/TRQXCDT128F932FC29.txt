Look at my face again
Cause i have suffered
Only to lose you now
From all the pain that you caused me
You are the death of me
I know you'll be the death of me
I never wanted this to ever end
Cause i breakdown
From everything that i can't believe
I know i'll make it on my own
So if you give it back to me
Then i will go alone
With the pain you've caused me
Just look into my eyes and you will always know
That i have suffered
Only to take the fall
From all the pain that you have caused me
You are the death of me
I know you'll be the death of me
I never wanted this to ever end
Cause i breakdown
From everything that i can't believe
I know i'll make it on my own
So if you give it back to me
Then i will go alone
With the pain you've caused me
Give it back to me
Give it back to me
Just give it back to me
Cause i breakdown
From everything that i can't believe
I know i'll make it on my own
So if you give it back to me
Then i will go alone
With the pain you've caused me
The pain you've caused me
