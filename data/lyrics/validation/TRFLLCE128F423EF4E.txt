It's war I tell ya
I met some fellas
Who used to love you
But now they don't know you
My favorite cousin
Who used to mean something
He played me records
I've tried to forget
Like french and saunders
He talked for hours
Through costume dramas
Watched by piranhas
And rows and rows and rows and rows of
Muppets staring straight at the sun

But I feel the force, I'm dead of course
Enrolled on a popular culture course
But I can't save nothing but world cup drumming
It's stuck in my throat like it used to mean something
I feel the force, I'm dead of course
Enrolled on a popular culture course
But I can't save nothing but world cup drumming
And I polish it every day

It's war I tell ya
On fortune-tellers
On trumped-up charges
You always were the hardest
My favourite brother
Who used to be taller
He played me records
I'll only hear once
Like french and saunders
He talked for hours
Through costume dramas
Watched by piranhas
And rows and rows and rows and rows of
Muppets staring straight at the sun

But I feel the force, I'm dead of course
Enrolled on a popular culture course
But I can't save nothing but world cup drumming
It's stuck in my throat like it used to mean something
I feel the force, I'm dead of course
Enrolled on a popular culture course
But I can't save nothing but world cup drumming
And I polish it every day

It's war I tell ya
It's war I tell ya
It's war I tell ya
It's war I tell ya

I can't save nothing but world cup drumming!
I can't save nothing but world cup drumming!
I can't save nothing but world cup drumming!
I can't save nothing but world cup drumming!
