Way down in Charleston
Lives old Geechy Joe
Going way down to Charleston
To dig old Geechy Joe
Got a good old geechy urge
Can't do nothin' else but go
Got misery
Misery I can't lose
I got misery, misery
Nothin' but bad news

Gonna dig old Geechy Joe
To voodoo these geechy blues

I've gotta get back to Charleston
If I have to walk down
Those railroad track
Gotta rub my hand on a lodestone
Blue is black
If old Geechy Joe can get it
I just ain't ever comming back

Comin' home, Geechy Joe, coming home
