You'd never admit, you played a part
In ripping us both in two
It's easier said, when it's ordinary life that got to you
Was it a waste of time to pull the line again
Now that it's gone
Now you're looking at your past like a broken glass
Puzzle from mistakes that you made

And I know, yes I know, yes I know
Yes I know, yes I know that you want this
And I know, yes I know, yes I know
Yes I know, yes I know that you still care

It's never enough, it's never done
The way that you want it to
It's easy to walk when you run from all the years they stole from you
Was it a waste of time to pull the line again
Now that it's gone
So now you're looking at your past like a broken glass
Puzzle of mistakes that you made

And I know, yes I know, yes I know
Yes I know, yes I know that you want this
And I know, yes I know, yes I know
Yes I know, yes I know that you still care

But when will you learn to make this over
Cause there's no harder life that I could lead
Than when I am with you

So you're looking at your past through a broken glass
Puzzle of mistakes that you made

And I know, yes I know, yes I know
Yes I know, yes I know that you want this
And I know, yes I know, yes I know
Yes I know, yes I know that you still care

But when will you learn to make this over
Cause there's no harder life that I could lead
Than when I am with you
When will you learn to make this over
Cause it's alright, it's okay
Just don't say that you love me if I'm just some mistake you made
