I dare you to be real
To touch
To touch a flickering flame
The pangs
The pangs of dark delight
Don't cower
Don't cower in night fright

Don't back away just yet
From destinations set
I dare you to be proud
To dare to shout aloud
For convictions that you feel
Like sound from bells to peal

I dare you to despise
Bureaucracy and all its lies
In the void
In the void they stare
They never
They never dared to dare

I dare
I dare
I dare you
You
You
You
I dare you
You
I
I
I
I
I
I
I
I
I dare you
