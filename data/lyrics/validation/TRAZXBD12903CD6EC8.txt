You called me up this evening
Cause you wanted to know what's going on

You give me ultimatums
Cause you don't want to feel you are alone

And I tell you that some folks don't evolve
They're content with what they've got
They just sit back and they watch TV

I talked about September
Fought about your taste you were on mine
What did you mean anyhow
When you said I'm lost, but there's still time

And I tell you that some folks don't evolve
They're content with what they've got
They just sit back and they watch TV
And I tell you that some folks don't evolve
They're content with what they've got
They just sit back and they watch TV
But that's not me

One day, you come around to see the other side of things
One day, you come around to see the other side of things
Yes you will
You'll come around to see the other side of things
You'll come around to see the other side of things
