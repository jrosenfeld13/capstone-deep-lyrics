I've got a feeling you don't care
And everything I say you cannot hear
So celebrate the time we have
'Cause I don't think I can stay, for too long

Oh yeah, and how could I forget
The complications you have failed to comprehend
I know, I know you're wasting time

You're wasting time on me
Now I can see

Tell me do you still have pieces of me
'Cause I am not complete at all
We can try, we can try
But we're never gonna get it right
Unless we fall

And now that all is said and done
I guess it's time to turn our backs and run
Away so I can finally take the break that I deserve
And why were at it we can slowly build this bridge
And burn it to the ground in a matter of ten seconds
She said we've got to get around baby she said

You're wasting time on me
Now I can see

Tell me do you still have pieces of me
'Cause I am not complete at all
We can try, we can try
But we're never gonna get it right
Unless we fall

It's time to replace
(All the times we've had 'cause they're never coming back)
We've got to erase
(I know the cause was clever but I should have know better)
