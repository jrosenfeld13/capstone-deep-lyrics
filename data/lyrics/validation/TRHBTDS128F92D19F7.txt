I was sitting at a table on an open bay
Waiting for drink of rum
When I asked my waiter for the time of day
She said, "Look out there's a centipede coming your way"

In Lahaina, the sugarcane grow
In Lahaina, the living is slow
In Lahaina, the mangoes are sweet
But the centipede he crawls all over your feet

I was lying by the water in the morning sun
Shaded by a coconut tree
When I turned around it was all I could see
There was great big centipede staring at me

In Lahaina, the sugarcane grow
In Lahaina, the living is slow
In Lahaina, the mangoes are sweet
But the centipede he crawls all over your feet

I had only just a second to decide what to do
While looking at his poisonous fangs
When I said I thought it was a beautiful day
He said, "Wow Mr. Hall, I think you're pushing my leg"

In Lahaina, the sugarcane grow
In Lahaina, the living is slow
In Lahaina, the mangoes are sweet
But the centipede he crawls all over your feet
