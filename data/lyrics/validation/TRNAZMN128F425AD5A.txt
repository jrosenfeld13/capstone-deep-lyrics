Just save the robots
Save it
Just save the world
Welcome to Wonderland
And call me Bob
You see me on your screens
The smile is never fading
And if you wait a while
As the new message is loading
Then you will understand
All the good reasons to buy
Lets get some action started
Just save the robots
It is time to start the fight
Just save the world
No other way to get around it
We gonna go make it right
And then it all goes mute
Because the line is down
Someone just cut the juice
And all the robots will starve
Who takes the orders now
And who will call to catch the bonus
With all the plug-in brains
And teasers stuck in the line
Lets get some action started
Just save the robots
It is time to start the fight
Just save the world
No other way to get around it
We gonna go make it right
