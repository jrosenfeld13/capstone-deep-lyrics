Here I am once again
Need a true helping hand
Yes I do, yes I do

I ain't wise, I ain't cool
Lot of times, been a fool
Yes I know, yes I know, sure I know, sure I know

I'll be back, with full attack
And waving flags, standing tall

Thank you God, for my friends
Fir a fair second chance
Thank you all, thank you all

I'm so glad you're around
Always there, when I'm down
Knowing you, got me through
Catch my fall, catch my fall

I'll be back, full attack
With waving flags, standing tall
Thank you all

Never crawl
Stand up tall
