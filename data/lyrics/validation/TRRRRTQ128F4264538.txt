At night before I go to sleep I think of what the darkness hold
In slumber land I drift into another world
It ain't hard
It ain't hard

And in my sleep there is a place that I can see come in to view
I tried to get a closer look, but took too long
It was gone
It was gone

I wake up and wonder where I've been in my dreams
It's a shame the world's not what it seems in my dreams

Though it's unreal I think I get a better deal
When no one tells me what I should think or feel
It ain't hard
It ain't hard

When I just come to know a pressure on my mind
The sleep's the only kind of peace that I can find
I can find
I can find

I wake up and wonder where I've been in my dreams
It's a shame the world's not what it seems in my dreams
