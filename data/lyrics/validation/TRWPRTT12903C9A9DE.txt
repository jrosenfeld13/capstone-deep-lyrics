I don't want to fight
Every single night
Everything I want is in your eyes
You and me go back
To places I don't know to care
The spoils of all I got were left for scraps

Don't let me say this
But you're no worse than me
It's crazy

We are the real
If real ever was
And just because
We are the real
They feel we have enough
We are the real
'Cause someone gave us up

I want to be there when you're happy
I want to love you when you're sad
Can't stand the morning rain?
Get out, I'll take your place then
Can't stand the blazing sun?
Then close your eyes you'll see
The angel dust

I don't want to be
Anything believed
A million watts of sound can't compare
Come along you'll see the world
The pulse ripples, the crowd unfurls
The current starts to flow and then you're on
Oh it's white hot soul they want
To sing for

We are the real
If real ever was
And just because
We are the ruin
Of every living soul
We are surreal
'Cause someone gave us up

Don't break the oath
I want to love you when you're happy
Don't break this oath
I want to be there when you're sad
Freeze-frame the pouring rain

We are the real
As real as any ghost
So easy now
We are the real
In ever living soul
Oh don't they know?

Can't stand the blazing sun?
Can't stand the morning rain?
Oh get out I'll take your place again

I don't want to be alone
I don't want to be alone
I don't want to be alone at all
If it's a white hot soul they want
Then a black heart they'll get
