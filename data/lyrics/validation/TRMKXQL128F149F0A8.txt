Yeah oh
There's a rumor going round
Whispers of the story you're not telling me
A message from me underground
It seems our love ain't what it used to be

It's love or true confessions
I don't want to always be the last to know
It's love or true confessions
Even if it means I have to let you go

Do you follow?
Outta of sight, outta mind
You get away with anything you please
I've never been the jealous kind
You'd better speak now, awful ever hold your peace

It's time for true confessions
I don't want to always be the last to know
It's love or true confessions
Even if it means I have to let you go

You've got to let me know
I can read your mind
There's more to me than meets the eye
Tell me the truth
You'll only get the truth from me, the truth

True confessions
I don't want to always be the last to know
It's love or true confessions
Even if it means I have to let you go in a whirl

No, it's all up to you
I don't want to lose our love
I give you my heart but every time you turn apart

True confessions
I don't want to always be the last to know
It's love or true confessions
Even if it means I have to let you go

True confessions, oh no
I don't want to always be the last to know
True confessions
You've got to say what's on your mind, Yeah

True confessions, it's all up to you
I don't want to lose our love. Oh no
True confessions, I don't want to let you go
True confessions, I don't want to always be the last to know
True confessions, say what's on your mind
Love ain't what it used to be
