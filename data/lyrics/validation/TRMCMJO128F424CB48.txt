Another day
When the pains of life won't bar my way
I'll break these chains
That hold me down
I'll tear you down into my private hell
Another day
I will trade my soul for your demise
Trapped in this wheel
I struggle on
Just to make it to another day
No! I won't take no more
No more pain
I'm gonna throw your weight of my back
Put my heart into the attack
I will tear you down
Smash your crown
Have your rule come to an end
And when you finally die by my hand
It's a breath of life to this land
All the wasted years
Come back as tears
In a heavy sigh of relief

Another day
When the dawn breaks over a brand new world
I'll let the sun
Wipe my tears away
Find my peace in the world without end

No! I won't take no more
No more pain
I'm gonna throw your weight of my back
Put my heart into the attack
I will tear you down
Smash your crown
Have your rule come to an end
And when you finally die by my hand
It's a breath of life to this land
All the wasted years
Come back as tears
In a heavy sigh of relief
