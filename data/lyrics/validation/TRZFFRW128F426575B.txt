She was My Heart, my soul, my girl, my life
I want that shit, I'll make that sacrifice
You know I know, you know What's on my mind
I like the sex but we're just wastin' time
No replay's, like Shifty please stay
Sick of breakin' up every other week day
And we can't seem to see eye to eye
You even yell when I try to get high
And I can't keep you, you're evil
And all my friends think that I should leave you
It's a stand still that I try to see through
But you're actin' like a bitch so I got to leave you

Oh, I think iv seen this once before
I know the way it ends when you just walk out the front door
Oh, I think iv seen this once before
I know the way it ends when you just walk out the front door
Your just a waste of my time, waste of my time, waste of my time, waste of my time
My time

You came, I went, you saw, I fucked, I left
Went neck to neck, but now it's sudden death
Get out of my bed, I came to make it mine
Don't want no head, stop all that wastin' time

Oh, I think iv seen this once before
I know the way it ends when you just walk out the front door
Oh, I think iv seen this once before
I know the way it ends when you just walk out the front door
You're just a waste of my time, waste of my time, waste of my time, waste of my time
My time

Waste of my time, waste of my time, waste of my time, waste of my time
My time

I'm mad but, I packed your bags up
Put 'em by the door, you can have that stuff
Story of them all, and a man's bad luck
But it's all for the best I guess, Next
Now I feel like the man on the moon, like
Staring down on the world lookin' for a new girl
And a new life, now I guess one day, some day I'm a get it right

Oh, I think iv seen this once before
I know the way it ends when you just walk out the front door
Oh, I think iv seen this once before
I know the way it ends when you just walk out the front door
You're just a waste of my time, waste of my time, waste of my time, waste of my time
My time

Your just a waste of my...

Time
