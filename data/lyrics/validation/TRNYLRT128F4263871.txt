Living in fear fuck pretend
24 years struggle within
Making it clear this is sin
Lie my dear lie my friend

So sad

Living in me complicate
What's it gonna be so irate?
Choke on me asphyxiate
All I see all my hate

So sad
Too bad

I'll be the one
Kill you for fun
This song is dumb

You said you were my friend
Hope you never call again
Right

Coming undone live with this
Beautiful one state of bliss
My affliction's killing this
Bury this one for a kiss

So sad
Too bad

I'll be the one
Kill you for fun
This song is dumb

You said you were my friend
Hope you never call again
Motherfuck

You said you were my friend!
You said you were my friend!
You said you were my friend!
You said you were my friend!
You said you were my friend!
You said you were my friend!
You said you were my friend!
You said you were my friend!
