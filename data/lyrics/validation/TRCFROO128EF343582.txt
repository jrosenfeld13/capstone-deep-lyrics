[Verse 1: will.i.am]
Ever since I was a little younger
I always had a ryhme that I flung up
Any situation that you brung up
Black Eyed Peas will shake a party like thunder
Now everybody wanna ask and wonder
How the Black Eyed Peas took it from the under
From the bottom to the top
Now we make your body rock
Mutha (Hey!) don't sit and ponder
Cause we come with no bloops no blunders
We keep it fat like Attila the Hun-a
Latin ladies by like ay caramba
We caliente like you chilling in the summer

[Hook: will.i.am]
We gave you something now you gonna ask for some more
But no brother you ain't gonna get no more
And I know you really like this audio delite
Cause my drum goes dum diddy dum-a (check it out)
One-time-for-ya-mind, two's for your soul
Three's for your body, and four's for the ambience, check it out cause this is how it go

[Verse 2: will.i.am]
I'm sick with the rhyme, I'm infected
Since '95 the BEP's perfected
The way we get down on the record
We comin' up with heat that's not expected
You can't, you can't, you can't help but check it
We stand out like chubby people in checkers
We coming hectic and hyper, aiming like a sniper
And when I rock the mic you'll respect me
You respect it cause you know I'm known to kill it
I make it, make it, make it, make it hotter than a skillet
Yeah, and I know you goin' feel it
Black Eyed Peas we do it we're the realest

[Hook: will.i.am]
We gave you something now you gonna ask for some more
But no brother you ain't gonna get no more
And I know you really like this audio delite
Cause my drum goes dum diddy dum-a (check it out)
One-time-for-ya-mind, two's for your soul
Three's for your body, and four's for the ambience, check it out cause this is how it go

[Verse 3: apl.de.ap]
My faith will never fall
Forever remain myself after all
Gainin' fame, mass appeal, entertainin' y'all
Never change or conform
We always rock it raw
I remember when we used to bust at the mall
Ways of expressin' my love for the art
Now we here to restore these rap laws
Cause the way it is now is not the way I saw so check it
I'mma do it like this
So y'all could recite this
Hip hop anthem once more
I won't let the mic rest
You won't catch me rhyme-less
No matter what the future got in store

[Hook: will.i.am]
We gave you something now you gonna ask for some more
But no brother you ain't gonna get no more
And I know you really like this audio delite
Cause my drum goes dum diddy dum-a (check it out)
One-time-for-ya-mind, two's for your soul
Three's for your body, and four's for the ambience, check it out cause this is how it go
