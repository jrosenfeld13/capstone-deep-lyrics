CHORUS
I CAN'T HELP MYSELF
WHENEVER YOUR AROUND ME GIRL
I WANT NO ONE ELSE
LADY YOU JUST ROCK MY WORLD

VERSE 1
I TRIED TO FIGHT IT BUT IT DON'T MAKE SENSE
YOU SEEM TO BREAK MY DEFENSE
YOUR VIBE AND YOUR CONFIDENCE
DRIVES ME CRAZY, TAKES OVER ME
WHENEVER YOU COME AROUND
MY WALLS THEY COME TUMBLING DOWN
YOU KNOW THAT YOU WEAR THE CROWN
YOU DRIVE ME CRAZY, TAKE OVER ME

PRE-CHORUS
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU
EXPECT A MAN TO DO
WHEN HE'S AROUND YOU, GIRL
WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY
WHEN YOU COME MY WAY
WHETHER NIGHT OR DAY, GIRL

CHORUS 2X

VERSE 2
YOU MAKE ALL MY SENSES WEAK
SOMETIMES IT IS HARD TO SPEAK
AND WHEN YOU BRING OUT THE FREAK
IT DRIVES ME CRAZY, TAKES OVER ME
GIRL NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE
EVEN IF YOU'RE NEAR OR FAR
YOU KNOW YOU SHINE LIKE A STAR
IT DRIVES ME CRAZY, TAKES OVER ME

PRE-CHORUS
CHORUS 3X
