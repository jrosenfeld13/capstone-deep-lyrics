There's stormy seas this side of heaven
No guarantees of reaching shore
Well I'm not perfect and you're no better
But this is something worth fighting for
We got something worth fighting for
It's not enough these hearts and flowers
You build your home on something more
When life gets tough then
Love must be tougher
This is something worth fighting for
We got something worth fighting for
For everything I ever wanted
And I never wanted less
Than a lifelong true companion
And a love that can always stand the test
We can be strong
Come hell or thunder
Mightier than the sword
This time we're on the side of the angels
Cause this is something worth fighting for
We got something worth fighting for
This is something worth fighting for
Worth fighting for
