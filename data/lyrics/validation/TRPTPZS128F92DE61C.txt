Please don't guide me again
Could you just leave me here?
I'll bury these wounds with you
I'll be gone by nightfall

The shadow is gone
And then you're leaving coldness here
It's getting darker now
The night is drawing closer my dear

To writhe..
I found my suffering - the life
I hear you suffer me - to writhe
I bound my suffering - tonight

The start of cold seasons
Just a road of despair
There is no way out of here
Again to feel you near

Why do you love to torture me
Cut me open and leave me this way?
And when away of de profundis
You disappear from me again

I can feel the warm nightfall
As I taste the death on her lips
I am doomed to hold this woe
It's time to kneel I'm so alone

To writhe..
I found my suffering - the life
I hear you suffer me - to writhe
I bound my suffering - tonight

The start of cold seasons
Just a road of despair
There is no way out of here
Again to feel you near

Why do you love to torture me
Cut me open and leave me this way?
And when away of de profundis
You disappear from me again

To writhe..
I found my suffering - the life
I hear you suffer me - to writhe
I bound my suffering - tonight
