Little boy. always scared. never learned how to make friends. pushed around. laughed upon. you are still stuck in a world that's in the past. and it's gonna last. last until you understand. i won't take this even though i'm sorry too. and i know just how you feel. you're not the only one that's striving for the truth. but this is not the way to be. different ways. still the same. guess we never have much choice. without trust for no one. as if everything is all the same today. like nothing's ever changed. will you ever understand. i would like to know your heart. was it like this from the start. is it ever gonna change. will it always be the same. don't you know just what you do. is there only room for you. won't you come in from the cold. won't you leave your lonely road
