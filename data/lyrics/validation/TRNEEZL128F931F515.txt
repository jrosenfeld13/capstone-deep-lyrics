Dream me on down
Dream me on in
To a dark gravity

This is no story
To be spun or told
Its just a sign
To a girl shaped hole

One eye is Saturn, one is Mars
A halo storms around her head
A voice so soft it smashes stars
(The pieces rain upon my bed)
I see, I feel, I hear a crown
Of hair so dark it swallows suns
And still I feel as if Ive swallowed silk
Or fallen in black milk

This is the sound
That you know
When the lightening
Rod blows

Dream me on down
Dream me on in
To the shimmer and spin

Plot me a course
By Pluto and Mars
To a vanishing point
Between her and the stars

Between her and the stars
