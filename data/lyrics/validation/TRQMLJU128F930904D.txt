[Verse 1]
You've got me poppin' champagne
I'm at it again
Caught up in the moment
But not in the right way
I'm falling in between
Tearing up at the seams
We're just aiming to please
And aesthetics don't hurt one bit

[Pre-Chorus]
So follow me down
Take this all the way
Any way you want to

[Chorus 1]
Why don't you say so?
I think I'm caught in between
The nights and days fly by
When I'm lost on the streets
And my eyes, they despise you for who I am
Why don't you say so?
Why don't you say so?

[Verse 2]
You've got me thinking that
Lately I've been wishing
The television set would show me more
Than just a picture of the things I've grown to detest
I strip down my dignity
They can take all of me
But they won't ever take what I still believe

[Pre-Chorus]
So follow me down
Take this all the way
Any way you want to

[Chorus 1]
Why don't you say so?
I think I'm caught in between
The nights and days fly by
When I'm lost on the streets
And my eyes, they despise you for who I am
Why don't you say so?
Why don't you say so?
Give up and let go
I'm just a boy with a dream
And you can take one look
As I fall in between
With my eyes just as wide as my mouth can be
Why don't you say so?
Why don't you say so?

[Bridge]
I know, I know, I know
That there's a place for me somewhere out there
I know, I know, I know
That there's a place for me somewhere out there

[Chorus 1]
Why don't you say so?
I think I'm caught in between
The nights and days fly by
When I'm lost on the streets
My eyes, they despise you for who I am
Why don't you say so?
Why don't you say so?
Give up and let go
I'm just a boy with a dream
And you can take one look
As I fall in between
With my eyes just as wide as my mouth can be
Why don't you say so?
Why don't you say so?
