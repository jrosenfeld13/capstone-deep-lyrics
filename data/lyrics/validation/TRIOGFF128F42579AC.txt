As you pray like victims
Sworn to fulfill duality
Victimized by your duty
Your awakening incomplete

Seething, seething
Breathing fear within
Seething, seething
Breathing fear within

Fear will be one with the unknown
And once awake you will find you got it all wrong

Accumulate and find the things you lack
To stimulate the change of track
Fear never binds you and never will
Religion holds you and blinds you still

As the sage, a victor
Called to end all duality
Terror turns into beauty
Find awakening is complete

Seething, seething
Breathing fear within
Seething, seething
Breathing fear within

Fear will be one with the unknown
And once awake you will find you got it all wrong

Accumulate and find the things you lack
To stimulate the change of track
Fear never binds you and never will
Religion holds you and blinds you still

You come alive and feel this way
Never will life betray you again
Only have the self to blame
Never will life betray you again

Accumulate and find the things you lack
To stimulate the change of track
Fear never binds you and never will
Religion holds you and blinds you still
