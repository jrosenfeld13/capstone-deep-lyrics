Gouging into flesh, an act of forensic grandeur
Abusing my identity to ravish insides, a concoction of a mind deprived
Scandal on the operating table, my fetid fetish to carve, maim and dice
Stripped to the gore, operating manure

Gore seeping from the insides, dissolving carnal tissue
Medical knowledge abused and forlorn for a private psychological feast
A carnival of dissolving tissues, brutaly I thrust the scalpel, into this pool of pus

Skin after skin, I peel expectance
Skin after skin, another stiff ready to fester

A morbid patologist
Handing a rusted saw
Jaw cracked and splintered to bits
Shattered and torn apart
Shattered ribs implode
Gastric juices drool, no more...

Gore seeping from the insides
Dissolving carnal tissue
Medical knowledge abused and forlorn
For a private psychological feast
A carnival of dissolving tissue
Brutaly I thrust the scalpel, into this pool of pus

A lament configuration
Surgical abmination
Giblets squashed on the floor

Skin from skin is torn
A forensic doctrine of gore
