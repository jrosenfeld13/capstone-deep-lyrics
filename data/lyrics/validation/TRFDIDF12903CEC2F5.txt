(Holly Dunn/Tom Shapiro/Chris Waters)
I can say no to cherry pie ala mode
A Mercedes don't tempt me a bit
I can resist buying designer clothes
But heaven knows I've got to admit
Cowboys are my weakness
From L.A. to Abilene
Cowboys are my weakness
Could it be the genes
I really go for a rodeo Romeo
I gotta know what's under that hat
Show me a man who loves his old pickup truck
You gotta love somebody like that
Cowboys are my weakness
From L.A. to Abilene
Cowboys are my weakness
Could it be the jeans
They're so strong, they're so shy
A little bit wild, but so am I
I love their walk and I love their ways
Makes me wanna go yippee yo ki ay
Cowboys are my weakness
From L.A. to Abilene
Cowboys are my weakness
Oh, you know what I mean
