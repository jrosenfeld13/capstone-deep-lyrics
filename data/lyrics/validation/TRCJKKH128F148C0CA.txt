The boy could play before he learned to grow
Worked in a band who had no name at all
Every mornin' at the break of dawn
You could see him draggin' home his drums

I was vaccinated with a Victrola needle
And I'm hooked on rock and roll

They called the family doctor to see what he could do
Doc said, "No you can't cure his soul
Once he's infected with the blues"
So I travel 'round from town to town singin' out the news

I was vaccinated with a Victrola needle
And I'm hooked on rock 'n' roll

When you find you got no mind to
Work from nine to five
Find the back beat, set your heart free
And feel that music runnin' through your feet

Mama told me long ago
"Ain't no future in that rock 'n' roll"
And I said, "Hey mama
It's burnin' hot inside my soul"

It's like a fever that won't cool down
I've been addicted since I heard that sound

I was vaccinated with a Victrola needle
And I'm hooked on rock 'n' roll, yeah

When you find you got no mind to
(Bop shoo bop, bop bop shoo bop)
Work from nine to five
Find the back beat, set your heart free
(Bop shoo bop, bop bop shoo bop)
And feel the music runnin' through your feet

Mama told me long ago
"Ain't no future in that rock 'n' roll"
I said, "Hey mama
It's burnin' hot inside my soul"

It's like a fever that won't cool down
I've been addicted since I heard that sound

I was vaccinated with a Victrola needle
And I'm hooked on rock 'n' roll, yeah

Hooked on rock 'n' roll
(I've been addicted since I heard that sound)
Hooked on rock 'n' roll
Hooked on rock 'n' roll
(It's like a fever that won't cool down)

Hooked on rock 'n' roll, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hooked on rock 'n' roll
(It's burnin, burnin, burnin in my soul)
Hooked on rock 'n' roll
Hooked on rock 'n' roll
(I've been addicted since I heard that sound)

Hooked on rock 'n' roll
Hooked on rock 'n' roll
Hooked on rock 'n' roll
Hooked on
