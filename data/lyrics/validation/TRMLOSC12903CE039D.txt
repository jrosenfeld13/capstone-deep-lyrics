A boy chases a girl until she catches him
But this is one thing he should never see
& the love for her man makes a woman understand
& that's the way love should be

Woman helping man
Underneath God's plan
Woman helping man
& man protecting her the best he can

A man goes through this world trying the best he can
Sometimes his love means sympathy
But when she holds him tight, suddenly everything's all right
That's the way love should be

Woman helping man
Underneath God's plan
Woman helping man
& man protecting her the best he can

(repeat & fade):
Woman helping man
Underneath God's plan
