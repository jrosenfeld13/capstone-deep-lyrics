Hey Hey Stranger
I hear that they call you the lone ranger
They say you love to live in the saddle
Is it true you want to high ho my silver
Giddy up you can try lawd have mercy
I will take that ride with you
I'm mighty thirsty

For love any kind of love but I do prefer
That it be good love
Hey hey stranger
I hear I fear my heart might be in danger
They say that you're a fast shootin' papa
And when you want it you take it just like an outlaw
Giddy up you can try lawd have mercy
I will take that ride with you I'm mighty thirsty

For a man any kind of man but I do prefer
That it be a good man
Hey hey stranger
