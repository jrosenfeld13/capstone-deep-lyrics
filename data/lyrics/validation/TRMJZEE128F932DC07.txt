I know you have wasted time
Thinking about her
But here, everybody is standing
Standing beside you
Now don't you worry
'Cause I'm one of them too
My love I have for you
Is strong and is just for you
So take my hand
In this crowded room
Take me anywhere you deem beautiful
It's so easy so simple so beautiful
It's so easy so simple so beautiful
It's so easy so simple so beautiful
So let me, let me guide you
'Cause there's just one thing
I would like to do
I just want to make you happy
I just want to make you happy
So let me, let me guide you
Oh 'cause there's just one thing
I would like to do
I just want to make you happy
I just want to make you happy
It's so easy so simple so beautiful
It's so easy so simple so beautiful
It's so easy so simple so beautiful
It's so easy so simple so beautiful
