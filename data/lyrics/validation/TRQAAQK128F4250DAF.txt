Go west young man
And break bread in the new lands
And my life is over
While yours just beginnin'
I say, "Go west young man
And break bread in the new lands"
And my life is over
While yours just beginnin'
We can offer you everythin', we can offer you everythin'
We can offer you everythin', we can offer you everythin'
We can offer you everythin', we can offer you everythin'
Go west young man
And break bread in the new lands
And my life is over
While yours just beginnin'
The crazy spinnin' circle's going round and round
The crazy spinnin' circle's going round and round
The crazy spinnin' circle's going round and round
Around and round, around and round
Go west young man
And break heads in the new lands
And my life is over
While yours just beginnin'
I say, "Go west young man
And break heads in the new lands"
And my life is over
While yours just beginnin'
We can offer you everythin', we can offer you everythin'
We can offer you everythin', we can offer you everythin'
The crazy spinnin' circle's going round and round
The crazy spinnin' circle's going round and round
The crazy spinnin' circle's going round and round
Around and round, around and round
The crazy spinnin' circle's going round and round
The crazy spinnin' circle's going round and round
The crazy spinnin' circle's going round and round
Around and round, around and round
Around and round, around and round
Around and round, around and round
Around and round, around and round
