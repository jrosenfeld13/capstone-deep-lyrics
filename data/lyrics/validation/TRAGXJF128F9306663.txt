Lady of the dawn
You opened up my sleeping eyes
I never knew
That I was born
But I like you
For your body
And I love you
'cause you're wise
I am your prisoner
You're my lady of the dawn

You are the dealer
In this strange uncertain game
Take my cards
And deal again
I can feel my life is changing

Woman
Now you've taught my how to learn
Teach me to earn
The love you give to me
The love you give to me

Lady of the dawn
You opened up my sleeping eyes
I never knew
That I was born
But I like you
For your body
And I love you
'cause you're wise
I am your prisoner
You're my lady of the dawn

I was waiting
In the darkness of the night
Only now, I see the light
Softly shining in the sidelids
Woman, if you really hold the key
Turn it for me
And help me understand
Help me understand

Lady of the dawn
You opened up my sleeping eyes
I never knew
That I was born
But I like you
For your body
And I love you
'cause you're wise
I am your prisoner
And you're my lady of the dawn...
