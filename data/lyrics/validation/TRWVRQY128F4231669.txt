Your present arrived
Oh yeah, your present arrived
Oh yeah, your present arrived

So I opened it up
And I opened it up
And I opened it up
I opened it up

Light upon light upon light upon light upon light
Light upon light upon light upon light upon light
Oh yeah, your present arrived

When you walked in
When you walked in
The room became a palace
When you walked in

With a love so true
Light upon light
A love so true
Light upon light

Light upon light upon light upon light upon light
Light upon light upon light upon light upon light
Oh yeah, your present arrived

A love so true
A love so true
Light upon light
Oh yeah, your present arrived

No strings attached
But the rope is heavy
No strings attached
But the rope is so heavy
But the rope is so heavy
The rope's so heavy
The rope's so heavy
The rope's so heavy
The rope's so heavy
It's the big excitement

Light upon light upon light upon light upon light
Light upon light upon light upon light upon light
Light upon light upon light upon light upon light
Light upon light upon light upon light upon light
Oh yeah, your present arrived
