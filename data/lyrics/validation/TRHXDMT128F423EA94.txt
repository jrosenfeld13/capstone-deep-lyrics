Well you gotta see this, Golden thing
You golden thing
And when you get there better kiss me
Garbage piled up to the ceiling
Ashtrays shaped like asses
All this money and a golden thing
You golden thing, Hell, I got
Horseheads that I dance around in
In coked up anorexics
Got a tree and this golden thing
You golden thing, Hell, I got

Well you gotta see this, Golden thing
You golden thing
And when you get there better kiss me
