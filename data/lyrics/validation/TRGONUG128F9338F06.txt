From the drivers seat I could scarcely eye the street
Your skin was bathed in amber light
And rain streaks

And for the remainder of the ride
You slept silent beside
From cradled heart-shaped cheeks
And legs crossed at the knee

I turned 22 and wrapped in tangled sheets with you
On the unfamiliar floors
Of people that you knew

Now we move far and out of touch
Kill pleasantries in such
And truth be told, I think of you much too much

And once I whispered soft discreet, as you lay beside asleep
Your mouth agape and sweet
With bookends on your knees
And with pressed palms against my eyes
I still see you on that drive
Your face bathed in amber light
As you slept silent beside
