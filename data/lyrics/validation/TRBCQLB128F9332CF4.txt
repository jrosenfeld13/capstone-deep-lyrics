Suddenly it all occurred to me
Lost as I am
There's breathing room
On both sides me
So what if we beg to differ my friend?
That dissolves away as fast as gravity will take me
Suddenly I came to be lost in my head
A victim of anxiety
So what if I beg to differ my friend?
Let's fall away as fast as gravity will take us there
Guide me way beyond this
Way beyond this world
Thought you would
Guide me way beyond this
Way beyond this world
Suddenly what all occurred to me got to my head
Your broken words inspire me
So what if we beg to differ my friend?
We dissolve away too fast as gravity takes us there
Guide me way beyond this
Way beyond this world
Thought you would
Guide me way beyond this
Way beyond this world
You taught me to face what I've never seen
Then you let me lie (It's all been a game)
You taught me to hate above everything
Then you sold me lies (You're not what you seem)
I'm trying to erase what you've done to me
Guide me way beyond this
Way beyond this world
Thought you would
Thought you would
Thought you would
Guide me way beyond this
Way beyond this world
Thought you would
Guide me way beyond this
Way beyond this world
Thought you would
Thought you would
Thought you would
Thought you would
Guide me way beyond this (Thought you would)
Way beyond this world (Thought you would)
