Do you feel I should say goodbye?
That will not be necessary
Here's the reason why
Because your dreams of my premature demise will be overshadowed
By the truth you cannot hide

It seems simple to me that revenge ain't so sweet
Twisted turned you so ugly

You take your pleasure from my pain
Inflict your damage
I expect your delusion is part of you hating yourself
So take your pleasure from my pain

Your desire to obliterate my world isn't gonna happen
That's not what I deserve
With the belief that you bullied out of me
Did it satisfy you? Did it make you feel complete?

I would rather be free, keep my integrity
There's no price that's the bottom line

You take your pleasure from my pain
Inflict your damage
I expect your delusion is part of you hating yourself
So take your pleasure from my pain
Inflict your damage
I expect your delusion is part of you hating yourself
So take your pleasure from my pain

Say what you want, it's all in vain
It will be falling on deaf ears again
Say what you like this is my life
You don't understand what I need to survive

You take your pleasure from my pain
Inflict your damage
I expect your delusion is part of you hating yourself
So take your pleasure from my pain
You take your pleasure from my pain
Inflict your damage
I expect your delusion is part of you hating yourself
So take your pleasure from my pain
So take your pleasure from my pain
So take your pleasure from my pain
So take your pleasure from my pain
