[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
This one goes out to the one I love
This one goes out to the one I've left behind
A simple prop to occupy my time
This one goes out to the one I love

[Chorus]
Fire!
Fire!

[Verse 2]
This one goes out to the one I love
This one goes out to the one I've left behind
A simple prop to occupy my time
This one goes out to the one I love (Love)

[Chorus]
Fire! (She's comin' down on her own, now)
Fire! (She's comin' down on her own)

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
This one goes out to the one I love (Love)
This one goes out to the one I've left behind
Another prop has occupied my time
This one goes out to the one I love (Love)

[Chorus]
Fire! (She's comin' down on her own, now)
Fire! (She's comin' down on her own)
Fire! (She's comin' down on her own, now)
Fire! (She's comin' down on her own)
