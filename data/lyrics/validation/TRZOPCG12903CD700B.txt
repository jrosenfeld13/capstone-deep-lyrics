Tell him what you know thought you had me
But I let it go
And now I'm gonna take down the whole thing
Everything is going down with me
Thought you told him everything
Left out a little bit about yourself
And I found out from your best friend
I think its time that I filled him in
And now I'm gonna take down the whole thing
Everything is going down
With me

You know to much keep it to yourself
So much at stake but you don't give a damn
And now it's coming back on you
You keep on pushing baby can't you see
Always try but your never gonna get to me
I'll make sure this time

Tell him what you know I thought you had me
But you let me go
Can't take it anymore cause
I got so much I've been saving up

Everyone's gonna drown in it
