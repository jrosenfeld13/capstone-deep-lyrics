A rose must remain with the sun and the rain
Or its lovely promise won't come true
To each his own, to each his own
For me there's you

Two lips must insist and two more to be kissed
Or they'll never know what love can do
To each his own to each his own
For me there's you

If a flame is to grow there must be a glow
To open each door there's a key
I need you I know
I can't let you go

Your touch means too much to me dear
What good is a song if the words don't belong
And a dream must be a dream for two
No good alone I found own my one and only you...
