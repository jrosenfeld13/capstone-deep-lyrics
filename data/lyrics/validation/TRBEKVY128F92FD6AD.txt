On a chance we meet again
In a life and death experiment
And they cut your thoughts in increments
I could see that you were Heaven-sent

You, you're so loud
I can hear you breathing out
You're so loud
I can hear you dreaming now

See the world behind your eyes
As they mix up all your parts
I think that you're so beautiful
When you speak from someone else's heart

You, you're so loud
I can hear you breathing out
You're so loud
I can hear you dreaming now

Outside of the daydreams, and how it seems
I see everyone you know
Outside of your worst fears, and the best years
Oh, the places we could go

Outside of the right now, and the right here
All the things you'd wanna know
Outside of the confines of our real lives
I see all the mysteries of you

Outside of the daydreams, and how it seems
I see everyone you know
Outside of your worst fears, and the best years
Oh, the places we could go

Outside of the right now, and the right here
All the things you'd wanna know
Outside of the confines of our real lives
I see all the mysteries

(You, you're so loud)
When you speak
(I can hear you breathing out)
The whole world
(You're so loud)
Can hear you
(I can hear you dreaming)

You, you're so loud
I can hear you breathing
I can hear you breathing
I can hear you breathing out
I can hear you breathing
I can hear you breathing
