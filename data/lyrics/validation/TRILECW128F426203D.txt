I didn't have to turn my head whenever you walked in
The only one to let these chills roll down my skin
My heart beats faster
I hear your name
I feel my confidence slipping away
Thought I was doing fine
About to get you off my mind
I see you face and then I'm wrapped
Around your pretty little finger again
It feels like ages since you lay down in my arms
See no good reason still I'm tangled in your charms
My God you're smiling
You catch my eyes
My heart is pounding deep inside
Thought I was doing fine
About to get you off my mind
I see you face and then I'm wrapped
Around your pretty little finger again
SOLO in D
Ain't gonna let no man go down without a fight
My stalls and walls look better in the bright daylight
My heart beats faster
I call your name
I feel my confidence slipping away
Thought I was doing fine
About to get you off my mind
I see you face and then I'm wrapped
Around your pretty little finger
Thought I was doing fine
About to get you off my mind
I see you face and then I'm wrapped
Around your pretty little finger again
