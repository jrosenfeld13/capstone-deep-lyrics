Talk to me what are you doing what are you
Thinking rite now set me free I'm just a prisoner
To you and time goes by I'm still waiting forever
And a day boy I thought I saw you yesterday
I thought those words I herd you say

(Chorus)
When I look at the sunrise sunlight, nothing
Feels awake when your living this feeling
Don't ever let me go when I look at the
Starlight it feels right your bodies on my mind ill set
You free , ill set you free

Look at me what are u thinking tell me what your
Seeing let me go if there's nothing you

Believe
An time goes by I'm still waiting
Forever and a day boy I thought I saw you yesterday

(Chorus)
When I look at the sunrise , sunlight nothing feels awake when your living this
Feeling don't ever let me go when I look at the
Starlight it
Feels right your bodies on my
Mind ill set you free 
Ill set u free
