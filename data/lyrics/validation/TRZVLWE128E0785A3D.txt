As I ponder my thoughts and fears and life
I stand tempted to throw it all away

So I sit and I slowly lose my mind
Look for signs of you

Just to feel it again
Need to find my way back home again
A place where I can feel myself again
Leave the world behind and start again

As I gather my self I know that I still
Stand tempted to throw it all away
So I sit and I watch the world pass by
Look for signs of you

Just to feel it again
Need to find my way back home again
A place where I can feel myself again
Leave the world behind and start again
Need to find my way back home again

Another lonely day
As the sunlight turns to haze
I'm calling you to say
I miss you
I'm ok

Need to find my way back home again
A place where I can feel myself again
Leave the world behind and start again

It's hard for me to say
I feel so far away
Soon one of these days
I'll be back home to stay
