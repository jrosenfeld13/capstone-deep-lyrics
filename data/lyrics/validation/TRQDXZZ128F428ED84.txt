[Intro]
If God came down on Christmas Day
What would he think? What would he say?
Would he notice all we'd done? Or just about a seldom one
I think I know what God would say if he came down on Christmas Day
He'd say to every boy and girl
Where's the oi I gave to the world?

[Verse 1]
Haji was a punk just like any other boy
And he never had no trouble until he started up his Oi band
Safe in the garage or singin' in the tub
'till Haji went to far and he plugged in at the pub

Twas a cold Christmas eve when Trevor and the skins
Popped in for a pint and to nick a back of crisps
Trevor liked the music but not the unity
He unwound Haji's turban and he knocked him to his knees

[Chorus]
If God came down on Christmas Day
I know exactly what He'd say
He'd say "Oi to the punks and Oi to the skins
But Oi to the world and everybody wins"

[Verse 2]
Haji was a bloody mess, He ran out thru the crowd
He said "we'll meet again, we are bloody not unbowed"
Trevor called his bluff and told him where to meet
Christmas day on the roof down on 20 Oxford Street

[Chorus]
If God came down on Christmas Day
I know exactly what He'd say
He'd say "Oi to the punks and Oi to the skins
But Oi to the world and everybody wins"

[Bridge]
On the roof with the nun chucks Trevor broke a lot of bones
But Haji had a sword like that guy on Indiana Jones

Police sirens wailing, a bloody dying man
Haji was alone and abandoned by his band
Trevor was there fading and still so full of hate
When the skins left him there and went down the fire escape

[Verse 3]
But then Haji saw the north star shining more than ever
So he made a torniquet from his turban saving Trevor
They repelled down the roof with the rest of the turban
And went down to the pub where they bought each other bourbon

[Chorus]
If God came down on Christmas Day
I know exactly what He'd say
He'd say "Oi to the punks and Oi to the skins
But Oi to the world and everybody wins"

If God came down on Christmas Day
I know exactly what He'd say
He'd say "Oi to the punks and Oi to the skins
But Oi to the world and everybody wins"
Oi Oi!
