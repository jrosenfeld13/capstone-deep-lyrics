Riding, riding a snail
Firing, firing with nails
I'm your God, crosseyed God
You're my slave, electric slave
You're my slave, I'm your God
You're my sleep, I'm your noise
I'm your eye, you're my blood
I'm your blow, you're my dust
I'm your God, you're my foam
I'm your God, you're my shell
I'm your God, you're my eyes
I'm your God, you're my slave
I'm your God
