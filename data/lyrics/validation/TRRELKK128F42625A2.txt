I was alone, I decided to get up, decided to get out
I picked up the phone and I gave my boys a shout
Told them I'd be out around nine, no particular plan
Just whatever comes to mind

Bryan called me up, said there's a show tonight
Do you want to go tonight, I'm giving my girl the night off
'Cause I'm hanging out with Steinkopf
Whenever I'm down, I know where my friends can be found
Whenever there's a doubt, I just have to shout

He's my friend, he's my alibi
My accessory to the crime
A bond that will never die
Until the end of time

Another night and we got somewhere to go
Going out, meeting up at the punk rock show
Where the air is hot and the music is loud
My kind of place, this is my kind of crowd

And we'll be here 'til the night is through
Loyal to my friends and sworn to fun

He's my friend, he's my alibi
My accessory to the crime
A bond that will never die
Until the end of time
