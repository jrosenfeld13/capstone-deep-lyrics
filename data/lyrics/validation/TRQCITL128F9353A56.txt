Feed me, feed me, baby
Need you, need you, need you, baby
Only you can make me human
Only you make me a woman

I know why you come, baby
I know why you stay, baby
I've got something you want, baby
Tell me it's OK

[Chorus:]
Be my joy, be my joy, be my joy
Be my joy, be my joy, be my joy

C'mon over here, baby
Let me come to you, baby
What more can I do, baby
Drive me, thumb me down, baby
Never stall me, oh baby
You don't have to love me, baby

[Chorus]
Where you going now, baby
When you coming back, baby
What time can I call you, baby
What if you're not there, baby

Do you like my hair, baby
Where else can I reach you, baby
You've made me so happy, baby
Have I told you that

[Chorus]
Be my joy, be my joy
Be my joy, be my joy
