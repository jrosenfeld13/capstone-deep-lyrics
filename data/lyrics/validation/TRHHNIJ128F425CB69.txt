Well I've been up to Paris
And I've slept in a park
Went down to Barcelona
Someone broke in my car
And I'll search the world over
For my angel in black
Yeah, I'll search the world over
For a Euro-trash Girl

Took the train down to Athens
And I slept in a fountain
Some Swiss junkie in Turin
Ripped me off for my cash
Yeah, I'll search the world over
For my angel in black
Yeah, search the world over
For a Euro-trash Girl

The CRS on the metro
Shook me down for a bribe
On my knees for the sergeant
When my passport arrived
Yeah, I'll search the world over
For my angel in black
Yeah, I'll search the world over
For a Euro-trash Girl

Euro-trash Girl, Euro-trash girl
Euro-trash Girl, Euro-trash girl

Called my mom from a payphone
I said "I'm down to my last."
She said "I sent you to college
Now go call your dad."
And the waitress that he married
Well she hung up the phone
You know she never did like me
But I can stand on my own

Sold my plasma in Amsterdam
Spent it all in a night
Buying drinks at the Melk Weg
For a soldier in drag
And I'll search the world over
For my angel in black
Yeah, I'll search the world over
For a Euro-trash Girl

Euro-trash Girl, Euro-trash girl
Euro-trash Girl, I'm a Euro-trash girl

Yeah, I'll search the world over
For my angel in black
Yeah, I'll search the world over
For a Euro-trash Girl

Solo Johnny

Got a tattoo in Berlin
And a case of the crabs
A rose and a dagger
On the palm of my hand
And I'll search the world over
For my angel in black
Yeah, I'll search the world over
For a Euro-trash Girl

Euro-trash Girl, Euro-trash girl
Euro-trash Girl, Euro-trash girl

Yeah, I'll search the world over
For my angel in black
Yeah, I'll search the world over
For a Euro-trash Girl
