Please forget the words I say
Don't mind them
Or what's happening
It's all going to go away
So don't hold it against me now

Please don't remember this
Please don't think of this
Please ignore how cold I seem
It's in my blood to sell you things
And I wish I wanted to change
So forget this evening

Please don't remember this
Please don't consider this

It will be okay
It will be okay
For it to be erased

It will be thrown away
In the end
It always gets to be okay

Please accept this apology
From the asshole that is ruining things
Tell me when to buy my own tone
Whenever you want
I will shut the fuck up

Please don't remember this
Please don't remember this
Please don't remember this
Please just forget about it all
Please don't remember this
