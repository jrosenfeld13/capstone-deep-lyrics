Been staring for a hundred hours
Run down a spiral drain
Keep mouth clamped tight, and it isn't right
Three words keep running round my mind
But my tongue is hard to find
I need to let it go, because I know
Dark secrets burn their vessel
Tearing out to grab a mouthful
Chunk of heart destroyed by quiet
Yell it out before it kills you now
Let it all out

Used to let rumors do my work
They got around real well
Now they only hurt, it's a liar's quirk
This time I gotta say it straight
I mean to do some good
I'm calling out your name, while the chance remains
Dark secrets burn their vessel
Tearing out to grab a mouthful
Chunk of heart destroyed by quiet
Yell it out before it kills you now
Let it all out

I want you...

So now you know where I come from
My secret's come undone
My heart revealed my cause
I'm lying naked at your feet
Don't crush the heart that bleeds
Take me at my word, it may sound absurd but

I want you...
