Oh, the shark has pretty teeth dear
And he shows them pearly white
Just a jackknife has Macheath dear
And he keeps it out of sight

When the shark bites with his teeth, dear
Scarlet billows start to spread
But Macheath wears his white gloves, dear
So there's not a trace of red

On the side walk Sunday morning
There's a body oozing life
Someone slipping round the corner
Is that someone Mack the Knife?

Johnny Whitey disappeared, dear
After drawing out his cash
But Macheath spends like a sailor
Did our boy do something rash, dear?

Jenny Diver, Suky Tawdry
Polly Peachum, Lucy Brown
Oh the line forms on the right, dear
Now that Mack is back in town

Mack the Knife
