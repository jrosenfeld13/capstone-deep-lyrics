Flirting with a floozy
I heard there was talk of a jacuzzi
And she's lapping up your charm
A little bit faster than it oozes

Her ex is there and he's fiddling with his hair
At the back of the minibus
Said they'll die
Pretending he doesn't care

Car 31 what have you done?
You're taking everyone home
Spoiling the fun

And there's a cardigan in the corner
And she's starting to bore you
But you can't say a word
Incase her sister finds out
I should definitely warn you

It's happening again
There's a crowd of you in the rain
Now your gutted cause you look back
And reminisce and realise it's never the same

Car 31 what have you done?
You're taking everyone home
Spoiling the fun
