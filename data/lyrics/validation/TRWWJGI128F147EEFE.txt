(Ad lib)
When we're together you look at me
And I see forever with you
One thing I know you got me hooked
There's nothing that I wouldn't do, yeah
Every day I wanna be with you
And every day I just wanna give you
Much more love
Much love
It's all for you, baby
No one makes me feel like you do I got much love
It's all for you, baby
I can't hide what's inside for you
Baby, get with me so you can see
That no one is for you like me, no. no
Don't be afraid, my love is real
I've got something you can feel, yeah
Every day I wanna be with you
Every day, baby, I-
And every day 1 just wanna give you
I just wanna give you more love
(* Repeat 2 times with ad lib)
Break it down, yeah
Come on now, get with it
I just wanna give it, baby
Come on now, get with it
I want you to hit it, baby
(*Repeat and fade with ad lib)
