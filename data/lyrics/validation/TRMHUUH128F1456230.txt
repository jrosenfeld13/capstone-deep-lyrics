It's like awaking from a dream
All I remember is a lullaby
I couldn't tell you where I've been
A thousand images just flutter by

Takin' my time in a white limousine
If I was the King, she'd be my Queen

And my thoughts are growing louder
And my mind has lost its way
And the flames are getting higher everyday

My mind is back behind my eyes
And there before me sits a butterfly
And as I watch, she gently cries
Can there be anyone who'll pity her?
How many faces have all of you been?
If I was the King She'd be my Queen

And my thoughts are getting louder
And my mind has lost its way
And the flames are getting higher everyday

My mind is back behind my eyes
And there before me sits a butterfly
And as I watch, she gently cries
Can there be anyone who'll pity her?
How many faces Have all of you been?
If I was the King, she'd be my Queen

And my thoughts are getting louder
And my mind has lost its way
And the flames are getting higher ev'ry day
And the flames are getting higher ev'ry day
And the flames are getting higher ev'ry day
