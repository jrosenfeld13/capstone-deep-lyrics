I found me a pulse
I found me a pulse
And I came to the screaming city, baby
I found me a pulse
I bought me some clothes
I bought me some clothes
And I played in the screaming city, baby
I got given clothes
We're village idiots
And words tie us up in knots
But it's OK
I lost me some clothes
And my GP upped my dose
I crave acclaim not your simpering pity maybe
I won't give up the ghost
I'll be the hostess with the most
And I won't give up my post
I come alive in the screaming city, baby
And I won't give up the ghost
But we're village idiots
And the party never stops
But it's OK
Cos to struggle would be meaningless
We are what we are
Everyone one of us
You love those disco thrills
Oh you love those disco thrills
Oh you really take the biscuit, baby
You love those disco thrills
But we're village idiots
And the party never stops
But it's OK
Cos to struggle would be meaningless
We are what we are
Everyone one of us
But it's OK
But it's alright
But it's OK
