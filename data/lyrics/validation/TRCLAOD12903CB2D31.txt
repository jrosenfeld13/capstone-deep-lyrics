I seen the demons
But they didn't make a sound
They tried to reach me
But I lay upon the ground

I seen the people
But they didn't make a sound
They tried to reach me
But I gave the run around

I reached for feelings
But they didn't make a sound
They tried to reach me
But I lay upon the ground

So, miles and miles of squares
Where's the feeling there?
Still nobody cares
For miles and miles of squares

Daydream, I fell asleep
Amid the flowers
Daydream, I fell asleep
Amid the flowers

I seen the demons
But they didn't make a sound
They tried to reach me
But I lay upon the ground

I seen the people
But they didn't make a sound
They tried to reach me
But I gave the run around

Daydream, I fell asleep
Amid the flowers
Daydream, I fell asleep
Amid the flowers

So, miles and miles of squares
Where's the feeling there?
Still nobody cares
For miles and miles of squares

Daydream, I fell asleep
Amid the flowers
Daydream, I fell asleep
Amid the flowers

Daydream, I fell asleep
Amid the flowers
Daydream, I fell asleep
Amid the flowers
