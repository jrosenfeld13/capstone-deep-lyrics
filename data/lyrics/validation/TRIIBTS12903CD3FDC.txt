(I thoought it was you)

I thought it was you
I thought it was you
I thought it was you
'Til my heart went bang
And drifted into something better
Something that I thought I'd never...

I've been on the ceiling
Still around to tell
I've been on the pavement
And I've been in the stairwell
Taking numbers from a certain someone
You don't know them
Didn't seem to matter
Walked without a care
Ran right in the rush hour
Just to get you out of my hair
Dirty weather never flattened my complexion really

You've gone out of fashion
You've gone off the dial
Tender navigation doesn't fit in with my style
For the less attention to the minor details of intention
Told me in the mirror
Told me on the vine
Couldn't make it clearer
Told me on the vine
Couldn't make it clearer
If you put it up in lights in Broadway
Here's your one way ticket to your closing night
