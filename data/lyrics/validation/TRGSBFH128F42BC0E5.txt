[Verse 1]
Tonight we drink to youth
And holding fast to truth
I dont want to lose what I had as a boy
My heart still has a beat
But love is now a feat
As common as a cold day in LA

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes when Im alone, I wonder
Is it a spell that I am under
Keeping me from seeing the real thing

[Chorus]
Love hurts
But sometimes its a good hurt
And it feels like Im alive
Love sings
When it transcends the bad things
Have a heart and try me
Because without love, I wont survive

[Verse 2]
Im fettered and abused
I stand naked and accused
Should I surface this one man submarine
I only want the truth
So tonight, we drink to youth
Ill never lose what I had as a boy

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes when Im alone, I wonder
Is it a spell that I am under
Keeping me from seeing the real thing

[Chorus]
Love hurts
But sometimes its a good hurt
And it feels like Im alive
Love sings
When it transcends the bad things
Have a heart and try me
Because without love, I wont survive

[Outro]
Love hurts
Love hurts
Without love I wont survive
Love hurts
Without love I wont survive
