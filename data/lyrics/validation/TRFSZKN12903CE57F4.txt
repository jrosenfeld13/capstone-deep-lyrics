How did we end up here
How did everything good just disappear
How could I change something I don't know

You say that this ain't a game
Say that you think I won't ever change
Say I learn my lessons far too slow

So you got the best of me
I'll just take what's left and leave this place
And when you look back I hope I'll always be your favorite waste of time
Your favorite waste of time

Just a spinning wheel
Say that that's the way I made you feel
Since the day I wandered through your door

Now that the deal is done
I roll west into the setting sun
Where I can't waste your precious time no more

So you got the best of me
I'll just take what's left and leave this place
And when you look back I hope I'll always be your favorite waste of time
Your favorite waste of time
