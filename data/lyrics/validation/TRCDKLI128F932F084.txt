How about the possibility of you and I
Lady, can we try
Lady, say you're wit' it
If you're not wit' it, then excuse me

[Angie Stone]
Can't make you stay
If you want to go
Sugar, I can't make you love me
If your heart says no
There's one thing I'm certain of
And I know it's true
Can't nobody love you like I do, like I do

[Calvin Richardson]
Hey, excuse me please
You sure look good to me
With your straight hair or braids
Kinda got my momma's ways (kinda got my momma's ways)
How about the possibility of you and I
Lady, can we try
Lady, say you're wit' it
If you're not wit it, then excuse me

[Raphael Saadiq]
The first time I saw your thighs
That's when I realized
My heart, it skipped a beat
I can't seem to make you see
I tried everything in my book
I'm laughing 'cause you won't even look
I gotta stop wasting my time, so excuse me please

[Angie Stone]
Can't make you stay
If you wanna go
Sugar, I can't make you love me
If your heart says no
There's one thing I'm certain of
And I know it's true
Can't nobody love you like I do, like I do

[Raphael Saadiq]
I'ma try this one more time
You look like virgin eyes
This one here might be true
And here's a few rules for you
I, I wanna be married but free
I gotta let the drama miss me
Could this apple fit on your tree
If not, excuse me please

[Calvin Richardson]
Hey, excuse me please
