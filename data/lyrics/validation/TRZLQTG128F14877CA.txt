Under your leaves I laid
With wishes you'd call my name
And bring me to you well
So my thirst no longer is
You know I'll do anything for you
Bring singing birds to your crown
Climb to the very top of you
Though I might fall
But one day I must go
To get myself a warmer coat
I'll promise I'll be back real soon
Back under your leaves again
