Well know that, I know this
That they'll want control of you
And hope that but notice
But you know they never do

And there are better days waiting for everyone
Slow starts, cold hearts will always be cold
Well they'll always be cold
Sat up, shut out
We know but you're never told

You can be grateful
You can be strong
We are not wrong
No one can love you
Fathering unto
We are with you

Know that we wish there were circles in all
And hope that but notice
As you walk through hopeless halls
And there are better days waiting for everyone
But cheekbones, good homes
Won't always be there
They won't always be there
Set out to shut up
And you know that you want them to care

You can be grateful
You can be strong
We are not wrong
No one can love you
Fathering unto
We are with you

Come down it's alright
A tower of luck
But you don't know it yet

You can be grateful
You can be strong
We are not wrong
No one can love you
Fathering will undo
We are with you
