My life was not in vain
Proved by the stripes on his back
Our sins have been now covered
Open the gates and set me free!

Look on me, send forth your fire
One last chance to throw down my life
Look on me, send forth your fire
One last chance to cover me

Here I am before your throne
You look at me as I turn away
Endless shame stripes my face
I look to you for I am lost
Your out stretched arms hold me tight
The look in your eyes takes my fear
My hands are raised up to the sky
I'm living breathless in my solitude!
