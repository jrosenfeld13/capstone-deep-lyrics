Twilight zone, nothing's wrong
With this feeling again deep inside
Between night and day

Twilight zone, midnight crawl
And I know that I'm not the only one
To reach this peaceful feeling

The moon's above me, and it's got a golden green face
The best that I can do is feeling my breathe under my chest
With this feeling again deep inside ... x2
I'm lost in my soul, I get lost in my soul
Large fields
Long fields...
