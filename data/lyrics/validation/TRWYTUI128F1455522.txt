Some things are
Better left unsaid
You'll find a nice
Place to hide them
But days like this
There is just too
Much going on
So I'm picking up
The pieces of my past
But I can't find
No peace at all
So in other words
I am so ready to be found
So I'll try and I might
Stand up and fight
To leave this place someday
All I need is that moment
To make me believe
That you're alive
And then I'll be alright
Paradise grown cold
One hand on my door
Way too high hopes
I can't tell right
From wrong
Show me how it's done
Lord I need to be saved
And then I'll be alright
On days like this
There is just too
Much going on
So I'll try and I might
Stand up and fight
To leave this place someday
All I need is that moment
To make me believe that
You're alive
And then I'll be alright
