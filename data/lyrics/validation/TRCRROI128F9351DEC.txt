[Verse 1]
Now don't you know my daddy told me
Told me right from the start
Said, listen
Said no matter how old a man is
He's partly a boy in his heart

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you'd be surprised at the things
You do now that you still wanna do

[Chorus]
But when it comes to the way
(The way you treat your woman)
When it comes to the way
You treat your woman
You can't let the boy
Overpower the man in you

[Verse 2]
Oh, let me tell you that
Every man has to
Understand that you can
Go out with the fellas
But if the boy in you
Tells you to stay late
Don't listen
Well, if you stop to think about it
The man in you is gonna say wait
Listen here (that ain't right)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, you'd be surprised at the things
That a man who loves his woman won't do

[Chorus]
'Cause when it comes to the way
When it comes to the way
(The way you treat your woman)
You treat your woman
You can't let the boy
Overpower the man in you

[Verse 3]
One more thing now
That all you guys have to realize
That there are many pretty women
And if the boy in you looks their way
Take a good look
You know that if you
Stop to think about it
The man in you is gonna say
Come on

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, you'll be surprised at the girls
Who are gonna wink an eye at you too

[Chorus]
But when it comes to the way
(The way you treat your woman)
When it comes to the way
You treat your woman
You can't let the boy
Overpower the man in you
Oh, no, oh, no, the man in you
Oh, no, no, no
