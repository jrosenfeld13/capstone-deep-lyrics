I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
They won't mean a thing if you're not here with me

I'll have a blue Christmas, that's certain
And when those blue new heartaches starts hurting
You'll be doing alright in your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas

Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Just won't mean a thing, no 'cause you're not here with me

And when those blue, blue snowflakes start falling
That's when those blue, blue memories start calling
You'll be doing alright in your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue Christmas

Yes, I'll have a blue, blue Christmas
Yes, I'll have a blue, blue Christmas

Blue Christmas
Blue, blue Christmas
I'm having a blue
Please come home
I miss you so
