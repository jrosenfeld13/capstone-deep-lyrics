Baby, I know I blew your mind
Oh, I just kept hangin' 'round you
I thought you needed me near, oh yes I did now
Thought someday we'd settle down, oh yeah

Try to run my game on you - no baby, no no
Just tryin' to make you know
If you let me, I know I can
I can sail a ship on dry land
Hey, if you let me, I know I can
Be a man, I wanna

I know you told me from the start how you felt
Oh, my mind was already made up, yes it was now
I was gonna take care of you, oh yeah (I really love you)
Instead I made things just a little rough on you, oh yeah

Try to run my game on you - no baby, no no
Just tryin' to make you know
If you let me, I know I can
I can build a house on quicksand (quicksand, baby)
If you let me, I know I can
Be a man, I wanna

Try to run my game on you - no baby, no no no
Just tryin' to make you see
My mind went up and left me
My heart's givin' in with you, yeah
Baby, I miss you
Oh, if you let me, I know I can
I can sail a ship on dry land
Hey, if you let me, I know I can
I can build a house on quicksand
Hey, if you let me, I know I can
I'll do anything you want me to baby, all you gotta do is let me
