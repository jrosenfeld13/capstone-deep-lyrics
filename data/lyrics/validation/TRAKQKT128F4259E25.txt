[Verse 1]
I talk to you by satellite
I hope before they reach you
The space will make the words sound right
I hear your voice come out the phone
I'd like both ears to hear you
Speak when I'm not on my own
And I forget that I'm not set in stone

[Verse 2]
I don't know where to draw the line
The flat horizon stretches out between
Your world and mine
And where I go will follow no design

[Chorus]
When I feel
Like the world is lonely
You can heal me when you say
That you know the world'll be OK

[Verse 3]
My jaded senses taste the view
The city eye-pollutes you
Makes you yearn for something new
I waste my time with magazines
The pages live life for you
When your needs don't match your means
But your caress
Will suppress my selfish genes

[Chorus]
When I feel
Like the world is lonely
You can heal me when you say
That you know the world'll be OK

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
The words we say won't go away
The meaning hides inside them
Tries to look the other way
And I'll forget
The words I meant to say

[Chorus]
When I feel
Like the world is lonely
You can heal me when you say
That you know the world'll be OK

[Outro]
I know the world'll be OK
I know the world'll be OK
I know the world'll be OK
I know the world'll be OK
I know the world'll be OK
I know the world'll be OK
I know the world'll be OK
I know the world'll be OK
