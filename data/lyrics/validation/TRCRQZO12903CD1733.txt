There is no difference
Between death and life
Just a circle to be
Closed by time
Creatures comforts in this
Earthly plane
Have become more hallowed
Than wisdom today

[Chorus]
In the stream of consciousness
We cannot see the truth
Play your role so perfectly
No matter which life we choose

Emotional terror confusing
Our minds
Love and hate keeping us blind
Pretend death is the
End of the line
Expect reward in paradise

[Chorus REPEATS]
Living in an ice age
Emotions gone numb
The truth once so near
But now so far away
So turn another page
Get our daily work done
All the nightmares are clear
And happening today

Mindless fools obey all rules
Lost all worth, born to serve

Emotinal terror confusing
Our minds
Hate and love is keeping us blind
Creature comforts in this
Earthly plane
Have become more hallowed
Than wisdom today

There is no differnce between
Death and life
Just a circle to be
Closed by time
Pretend death is
The end of the line

[Chorus REPEATS]
