I woke from a lovely dream
I was rescuing you and I from a thief
In the gold of a dying summer day
There is no such thing as now
Only what was and what will be
Where do we live with certainty? Tell me
Cause here tonight I see the fading coals
Yeah they go on burning for so long
On and on they glow
What kind of fire makes them strong?
Sick with the old fire I still burn

I was chasing a holy ghost
It brought me to some stormy coast
There to be infected with more need
And then I found my way back home
And I'm swallowing pills
And I'm casting stones
And I'm making believe
I've got plans to get well
But it's a hard sell
Cause here tonight I see the distant stars
Yeah, they send their light out for so long
I'm a firefly in a jar
I can only burn here for so long
Sick with the old fire I still burn
