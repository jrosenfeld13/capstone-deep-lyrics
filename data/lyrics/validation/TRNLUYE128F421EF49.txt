When I was in goldmines
Everybodyd ask what I was digging for
When I was on hard times
It seemed like everybody knew that score
And I was such a bore

When I lost my true love
Everybody said we told you so
Camping with people I knew loved
Its such a funny place but I would always glow
So sad to see you go

You cut your tongue and it made you dumb

You always thought youd lose me
When I didnt have that much to say
But you came to learn I was
Off in my other place
And youd lose me anyway

You cut your tongue and it made you dumb

I always knew Id lose love
When it was off in ancient Rome
Riding over viaducts
And spending so much time alone
So sad to see you go

You cut your tongue and it made you dumb
