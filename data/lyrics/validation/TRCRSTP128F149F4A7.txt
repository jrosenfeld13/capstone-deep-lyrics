Oh, go tell the mountainside
Go tell the mountainside
Throw its roots to the sea

Oh, how you've grown up so wild
How you've grown up so wild
You're like the mustard seed now

I was the sun she was the moon
I was the sun she was the moon
I was the sun
And our children were the stars

Oh, we touched like the sands
It was just like the sands
On the shores to come

Oh, to sail in your eyes
Through those dawn colored eyes
We could leave today mama

I was the sun she was the moon
I was the sun she was the moon
I was the sun
And our children were the stars

Yeah, I was the sun she was the moon
I was the sun she was the moon
I was the sun
And our children were the stars

Heaven, you let your hair hang down
You let your hair hang down
All along your breast
Heaven, you let your hair down
You let your hair hang down
All across my flesh
Heaven, you let your hair hang down
You let your hair hang down
That's the way it's best
