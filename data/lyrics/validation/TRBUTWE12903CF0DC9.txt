He was young and attractive and straight from Savannah, GA
But he couldn't find a job so he hitched to the south of LA
His mother and father, they cried when he told them goodbye
They wondered and sat and hoped that their boy would survive
City lights
Shining bright
Every night 'til five, a thrill
He was venting from bar to bar
Ending up in a stanger's car
Soon he will find his time was wasted

Just arrived on the Hollywood scene
Lookin' for a good time
Young and clean on the Hollywood scence
Gotta have some pleaseure

Just arrived on the Hollywood scene
Lookin' for a good time
Young and clean on the Hollywood scence
Gotta have some pleaseure

Love at first sight for night was his motto
So back to the streets to get money, that was his game
He walked down the street in his tight-fitted jeans just to be noticed
He would talk that talk and he gave himself a new name
Sad look
In his eyes
It would make you
Want to cry
One sinner, young and shy
With ambitions high
Here's a lesson, you must learn
Play with fire, you'll get burned

Just arrived on the Hollywood scene
Lookin' for a good time
Young and clean on the Hollywood scence
Gotta have some pleaseure

Just arrived on the Hollywood scene
Lookin' for a good time
Young and clean on the Hollywood scence
Gotta have some pleaseure

God know what you're going through
And He understands the need in you
Satisfaction, uh huh, He wants to give it to you, satisfaction
If you're lost, alone, and on the streets
Only the Lord can fill your needs
For satisfaction, he wants to give it to you, satisfaction
God loves you, loves you
He wants you to know
God loves you, loves you
He wants you to know
God loves you, loves you
He wants you to know
God loves you, loves you
He wants you to know
Whoaoooaooaoah!
He wants you to know
Whoaoooaooaoah!
He wants you to know
God loves you, loves you
He wants you to know
