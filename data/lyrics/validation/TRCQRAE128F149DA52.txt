Shine...

Think about back in the day
When I was afraid to say what I had to say
But things changed and I found a way to release this pain
Still strugglin but I know I've got myself to blame
I gave up everything to find a way to keep my veins clean
Everyone around me seems to feel okay
I need to feed off of them and teach myself to do the same thing
But you know it's hard when you're scattered, shattered and had it
Don't know what to do about it, confused and getting rowdy

This is all I'll ever need to set my mind at ease
I'll sacrifice anything just to be
Shatter all my petty dreams away
Just let me shine

Never have I felt this way
I've only got myself to blame
This is my chance to get away
I want to shine

With a beat that's poppin
I know for nothing I ain't stoppin
Better get out of my way boy
Or you'll be the next one I'll be droppin
This is something I can do without
So go on about your way
For the ones who feel this you gotta get up and rock this bitch
With a stolen innocence I'm about to loose my mind again
But I can't and I won't cuz I know that all I want to do is shine

This is all I'll ever need to set my mind at ease
I'll sacrifice anything just to be
Shatter all my petty dreams away
Just let me shine

Never have I felt this way
I've only got myself to blame
This is my chance to get away
I want to shine

C'mon shine with me now! C'mon!

Never have I felt this way
I've only got myself to blame
This is my chance to get away
I want to shine

Never have I felt this way before
I've only got myself to blame
This is my chance to get away
I want to shine
