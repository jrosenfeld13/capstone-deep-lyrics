Tell me now do we bear the sins of each other

Love what are we hoping for
Here we stand, closing a painful door
And I never knew, people could hurt for so
Now they're looking for a way out
And there's nowhere left to go
Is there anybody up there listening
You better come on down and lend a hand
If we all get to live with the sins of each other
Then here we stand
We'll find where you lie
Then we will take you home
And you won't be alone
Back where you started from
As near as we can come
You'll rest again
In the arms of love
Now when you are broken in two
Can we try to make it up to you
Is there anybody up there listening
You better come on down and tell us why
And if we all bear the cross of the world that we live in
Then we will try
To find where you lie
Then we'll take you home
And you won't be alone
Back where you started from
As near as we can come
You'll rest again
In the arms of love
We'll find where you lie
Then we'll take you home
And you won't be alone
Back where you started from
As near as we can come
You'll rest and then
We'll find where you lie
Then we'll take you home
And you won't be alone
Back where you started from
As near as we can come
You'll rest again
Ooh in the arms of love
