Mysterious vibes
That we share
Mysterious vibes
That we share
Mysterious vibes
That we share
God's love
Is in the air

I feel the mystery of love
Oh I feel the mystery of love

Mysterious vibes
That we share
Mysterious vibes
That we share
Mysterious vibes
That we share
God's love
Is everywhere

I found the mystery of love
Oh I found the mystery of love

After all the things were said
The mystery has gone from my head
I thought that I had worked it out
Now I know what love is about
If this feeling happens again
Don't be afraid it's not the end
All the things that come from above
It's God's way of showing...
