My past in a vcr, stay close to the television
At 22 he's a scrape and a pull
A million colors you can't 'em apart
I'm a prisoner of routine
And i'm boring myself to death
So make a list of your expenses
Make a list of what you'll keep

You shed a little width for so much depth
You shed a little width for so much depth

On a hook on a line with a balance
You and your sister got your souls in receipts
Now i'm working 9 to 5 like a peasant
I can't quit that easily

You shed a little width for so much depth
But i know if you were out tonight
Then everything would open up

These blank stone walls collapse on themselves
You think you have choose a big stance, a big satic you

You've aged a little but we just can't tell
You've aged a little but we just can't tell
You've aged a little but we just can't tell
Well every little bit helps

I know if you were out tonight then everything would open up
These blank stone walls collapse on themselves
You think you have choose a big stance, a big satic you
