[Hook: Mitchy Slick]
You gon need more than one gun if you gon eat around here
My gangstas do more than stand around and drink beer
Niggas dont squab no more its all gunplay
Talent that big yeah you gon see him one day
Every OG got a youngster thatll whack for him
And if he gets pissed hell dust off a old mac for him
Last couple niggas smoked got they whole wigs riddled
These niggas got some big ass guns thats why I ride with two pistols


[Verse 1: Phil Da Agony]
Yeah
Blast for your stash
Im like Fat Alberts younger homie Dumb Donald with the mask
Drunker than lil' Rass Kass of the flask
My eyes start getting all wide once I see cash
Lemon pepper sea bass
Sprinkling that Lawrys seasoning
With a pinch of Mrs. Dash
Ashenn my backwood packaging
While I break every letter down in my rap
Like an acronym
Whatever happened to that?
That nigga shit
Like 'em blacker than black
Pull out the mac from the back of the lac
That's my nigga Ill clap for him
The first rapper ever took me on tour
Ill go to war for him
Go to the drawer for him
Pull out a couple of stacks
Either that or just dust of the gat
Yeah that

[Hook: Mitchy Slick]

[Verse 2: Krondon]
I arise hit me knees and pray
And pull the Henny out
For my bredren in heaven I pour the Remy out
Fatal without doubt
Too many pennies
A littles better than not any
Take it from me
Willy Hutch and the clutch off blunts and clear Belvederes
Nevada nights off white huntin' for Brittany Spears
Hear the boom blast
Fast as the words up out a DOOM mask
No school or class could the fool pass
Rescue please ??? President Hussein
Dont let em shame your name and wish the truth came
Free the lame, art of war, armageddon for the future
Cant tell the Saint from the shooter
Codeine supplement
Never seen such a crime scene like outsourced torture for the government

[Verse 3: Phil Da Agony]
Yeah that, you aint never lied
You qualified to be the south-east ghetto tour guide
Lets slow ride and take a closer look inside
Trigger side, homicide
Its like Amistad, swallow your pride
Like a super big gulp
Knocked out like the great white hope
Socked out, before you hit the floor
You hit the ropes hard
Bullet proof booth like the Pope Car
Vacation with your bitch send a post card
Corny like Carson Daly, this your last call
Put a gun straight to your head, hate to blast yall
So imma just stall y'all out
The little homeys gonna air you out
When they see you with the bitch out
No doubt
