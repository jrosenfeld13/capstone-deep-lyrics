I won't blame you if you can't find your way
I will wait for you here
If you don't get here till the end of the day
Still I'll wait for you here

Now it's Sunday and I've lost sight of you
I'm wondering where you are
Are you hurting? Are you crying for me?
Have you wandered off too far?

I won't blame you if you can't find your way
I will wait for you here
If you don't get here till the end of the day
Still I'll wait for you here
