Oh, woman be wise
Keep your mouth shut
Don't advertise your man

Don't ever sit around holdin' no conversation
Explainin' what your good man do to you
Cause men are scarce these days
And it ain't no good
To go talking them around in your neighborhood

Gotta be wise
Keep your mouth shut
Don't advertise your man
Don't be a fool
Don't advertise your man

Now, your best girlfriend
She may look like a highbrow
But I seen her changing her clothes
At least three times a day
What do you think she's doin' now
While you're so far away?
She's lovin' your man in your own damn bed
Call for the doctor, investigate your head

Gotta be wise
Keep your mouth shut
Don't advertise your man

She's lovin' your man in your own damn bed
Call for the doctor, examine your head
Oh, woman be wise
Keep your mouth shut
Don't advertise your man

Woman be wise
Keep your mouth shut
Don't advertise your man
Don't be a fool
Don't advertise your man
