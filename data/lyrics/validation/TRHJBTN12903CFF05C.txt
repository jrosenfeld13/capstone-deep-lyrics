I hear you knocking
But you can't come in
My shotty's cocked
I'm playing hell to win
You can't imagine
How it can consume
The game is winning
Can't avoid my doom

I guess you've noticed
That I'm not the same
Devils conspire
To control my brain

[Chorus:]
Yeah, I can feel
Mad seasons changing
Everything and nothing's real
My eyes are going
Yeah, I can't feel my reasons changing
Everything and nothing's real
My spirits blown away

The moon is talking
And I must comply
The dead are walking
Can't avoid their eyes
The dawn's upon me now
I cannot quit
Reduced to defecating
Where I sit, oh no

I guess you've noticed
That I'm not the same
Devils conspire
To control my brain

[Chorus]
Away [16x]
