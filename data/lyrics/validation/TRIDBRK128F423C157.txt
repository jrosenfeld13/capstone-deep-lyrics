Ooh ooh dont you be blue
You there in the mirror Im talkin to you
Shes gone
There aint nothing you I can do

Me oh my theres a tear in your eye
Just hold still and Ill wipe it dry
My girls gone
Gone, gone, gone

(Chorus)
(Missin that girl)
Its hard I know my friend
(Missin that girl)
She does you in and then
You try convincing the world
That you aint missin that girl

Hey hey what do you say
You cant stay in the bed all day just moping
Just a wishing and a hoping

Some other guys and the something that flies
So cest la vie and au revior
My girls gone
Gone, gone, gone

Repeat Chorus
