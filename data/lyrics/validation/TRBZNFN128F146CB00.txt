Should the image change
Would the rest look better
Surface dissolves skin and bone
We're on the other side
It might be better
If I left you now
Talk for hours
But it doesn't change
This feeling won't go away

Should the image change
Cost effects the measure
It does explain a second chance
I keep it all inside
It might be better
If I left you now
Talk for hours
First impressions last
And cast shadows on the rest
