Tell me how, how long were you planning to wait for?
Are you in or are you out, give me a sign, boy
You take it in, you take in but you hold on for
For anything, for anything while everything passes you by

Hey!
There's always a reason
(2x)

Tell me how, how long were you planning to run for?
Are you scared or has the shame finally caught up?
You let its hold, you let its hold on you get stronger
You got wrong, you got it wrong, you gotta pick it back up and run

Hey!
There's always a reason
(2x)

Hey!
We dont wanna hear it
Hey!
You've always got somethin' in your way

Hey!
There's always a reason
(4x)

One, two, three, four!

Hey, hey, there's always a reason
(There's little use in running now)
Hey, hey, there's always a reason
(Gonna find you anyhow)
Hey, hey, there's always a reason
(And it'll turn you right around)
Hey, hey, you've always got somethin' in your way
