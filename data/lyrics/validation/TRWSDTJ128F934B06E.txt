[Verse 1]
I've got a friend
Who I've known since I was seven
We used to talk on the phone
If we have time, if it's the right time
Accompany me
By the kitchen sink
We talk about love
We talk about dishwater tablets, illness
And we dream about heaven

[Chorus]
I know it
I think I know it from a hymn
They've said so, it doesn't need more explanation
A box to open up with light and sound
Making you cold, very cold

[Verse 2]
I leave home at seven
Under a heavy sky
I ride my bike up
I ride my bike down
November smoke
And your toes go numb
A new colour on the Globe
It goes from white to red
A little voice in my head says oh oh oh

[Chorus]
I know it
I think I know it from a hymn
They've said so
It doesn't need more explanation
A box to open up with light and sound
And if you don't, you're on your own

[Chorus]
I know it
I think I know it from a hymn
They've said so
It doesn't need more explanation
A box to open up with light and sound
Making you cold, very cold
