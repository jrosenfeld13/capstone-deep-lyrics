OH MY LOVE
NOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY
YOU TAKE MY BREATH AWAY AND I AM YOURS
OH MY LOVE
I THOUGHT I WOULD NEVER FIND
SOMEONE TO LOVE
WITH MY WHOLE HEART AND MIND

Chorus:
WHEN I LOOK AT YOU
HERE BY MY SIDE
ALL MY DREAMS COME TRUE
WHERE LOVE CANNOT HIDE
ALL AT ONCE
WHERE IT NEVER DIES
CAUSE I SEE LOVE
IN YOUR EYES
I BELIEVE THAT THIS LOVE WAS MEANT TO BE
TWO HEARTS BEAT AS ONE
IN OUR SWEET DESTINY
SO HERE WE ARE
IN A MOMENT LOST IN TIME
TWO REASONS THAT RHYME
IN OUR LOVE FOR ALL TIME
Chorus
AND HOW YOU GAVE YOUR LOVE TO ME
NOW I SEE IT'S REAL
AND NOW OUR LOVE WILL ALWAYS BE
NOW I'VE FOUND YOU
Chorus
