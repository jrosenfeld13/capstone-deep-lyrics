Sometimes the way that you act makes me wonder
What I am to you
Sometimes I can't stand the way that I'm acting
To be part of the things you do

Often I've asked you for too much of your time
Like I'm stealing
And when I dream of the fear that you're leaving
I reach out
Oh baby, then you

So many times have I asked you to tell me
That I'm your girl
Time after time I have needed a reason
Just to get inside your world

So many times have I asked you to ask me
How it feels to love
And when this love seems the only conclusion
That I'm guilty of
Oh baby, then you

Put your loving arms around me
And you whisper to me when you
Put your loving arms around me
And inside your arms I'm burning

Put your loving arms around me
And you whisper to me when you
And inside your arms I'm burning

I'm burning, inside your arms I'm burning

Sometimes the way that you act makes me wonder
What I am to you
Sometimes I can't stand the way that I'm acting
To be part of the things you do

Often I've asked you for too much of your time
Like I'm stealing
And when I dream of the fear that you're leaving
I reach out

So many times have I asked you to tell me
That I'm your girl
Time after time I have needed a reason
Just to get inside your world

So many times have I asked you to ask me
How it feels to love
And when this love seems the only conclusion
That I'm guilty of
Oh baby, then you

Put your loving arms around me
And you whisper to me when you
Put your loving arms around me
