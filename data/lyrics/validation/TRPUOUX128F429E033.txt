When I feel you in my bones
She waits beneath me on her own

We gravitate to the sound of the music
And let it run and course through all our veins

Will you take me home?
I'm lost and found on every Friday night

When I'm walking down your street
The wind makes moves now with my feet
And when I feel her coming around
She's all alone my love is sleeping sound

Will you take me home?
I'm lost and found on every Friday night
And when I'm sad and alone
It's hard to find a girl on Friday night
