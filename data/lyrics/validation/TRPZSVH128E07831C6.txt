We better get injected
Just to combat our demented ways
If you don't care don't panic
The after shock but is just a passing phase

Do you know me, my brother ?
Is my blood as bona fide as yours
Has the Devil got my number?
Did I get stuck at the get go?

I never thought I'd reach the end
I never thought I'd find a gap
I never thought I'd reach the end
I found the point of no return

So here I am now, I'm ready
I've been waiting for the sky to fall
You know that hell's got no fury
Like a man too scared to just back down

We don't want peace and quiet
If it means walking unidentified
Divided here together
I'll make my own way to the exit

I never thought I'd reach the end
I never thought I'd find a gap
I never thought I'd reach the end
I'm ready to surrender

I never thought I'd reach the end
I never thought I'd find a gap
I never thought I'd reach the end
And I'm ready to surrender

And I never thought I'd reach the end
I'm ready to surrender, to surrender
To surrender, to surrender, to surrender
