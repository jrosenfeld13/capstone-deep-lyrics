[Intro]
Here i am. Broken wings, quiet thoughts, unspoken dreams
Here i am. Alone again and i need her now to hold my hand

[Chorus]
She's all, she's all i ever had
She's the air i breathe
She's all, she's all i ever had

[Verse]
It's the way she makes me feel
It's the only thing that's real
It's the way she understands
She's my lover, she's my friend
And when i look into her eyes it's the way i feel inside
Like the man i want to be
She's all i ever need
So much time, soo much pain (but) there's one thing that still remains
(it's the) the way she cared the love we shared
And through it all she's always been there

[Chorus]
She's all, she's all i ever had in a world so cold, so empty
She's all, she's all i ever had

[Outro]
It's the way she makes me feel
It's the only thing that's real
It's the way she understands
She's my lover, she's my friend
And when i look into her eyes it's the way i feel inside
Like the man i want to be. She's all i ever need
