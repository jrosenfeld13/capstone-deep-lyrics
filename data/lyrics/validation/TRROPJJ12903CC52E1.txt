Love is strange
Lots of people take it for a game
Once you get it you never want to quit
After you've had it
You say love, love is strange
Is better than a kiss
When you leave me
Sweet kisses are a miss
Hey, you sexy thing
How do call your love girl?
I say love girl
And if she doesn't answer
I say you'd better come here love girl
And if she still doesn't answer
Well then it is
Baby love is strange, baby, baby ...
You are the one
Tell me something
How do you call your love boy?
I say come here love boy
Oh, but if he doesn't answer
I say, Ah come here love boy
But what if he still doesn't answer
I simply say, Baby, oh my baby
Come here like that
You're the one
What do you call your love girl, my sweet baby
How do you call your lover boy
You know all sorts of ways
Baby, my sweet baby
Oh my baby, you are the one
