Terrorists in the city
Terrorists in the city

Some of them a work in iniquity
Some of them a work in iniquity
Don't kill the old lady
Or the baby where a suck pon titty
You know that no really pretty
Jah Jah him na go have no pity
Me say the woman just a band her belly
Me say the woman just a band her belly

John Brown him dead and gone
Jah know that him history still a go on
As him dead more John Brown born
Police full him up a corn
And him friend them run and gone

(Repeat Whole)
