The city explodes tonight, erasing feelings that i used to feel
Throw away the key, all locked up inside
The bridges will burn tonight, i wanna know what its like
To remember all the days weve never had
Im burning cold, im freezing out, im not the same that i used to be
You and i, bad memories and good times, the jump up to the sky
Together we get high
We have waited too long, i wasnt trying to impress myself
All the good things in my life getting away from me
Im burning cold, im freezing out, im not the same that i used to be
Dont turn your back on me, things i couldnt see
Spread your wings and fly over to me, oh my god
Its everytime the same, feelings without names
Cross your heart and come over to me, oh my god
The jump off
