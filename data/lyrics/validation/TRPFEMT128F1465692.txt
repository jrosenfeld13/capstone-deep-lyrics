Did I tell you
Where I went this morning?
Did I tell you
Where I've been all day?

You know
Where I go when I'm without you
You know
Behind the sky
The sun is always
Blue
Blue
Blue

Did I tell you
Where I spent my evening?
Did I tell you
Where I spent last night?

You know (you know)
Where I go when I'm without you
You know (you know)
Even among the stars
The moon is always
True
True
True
You
Only you
Only you

Did I tell?
