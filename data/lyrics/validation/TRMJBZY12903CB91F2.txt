[Verse 1]
The devil went down to Georgia
He was looking for a soul to steal
He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind
He was willin' to make a deal
When he came across this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the devil jumped upon a hickory stump and said
"Boy let me tell you what
I bet you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player too
And if you'd care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the devil his due
I bet a fiddle of gold against your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you"
The boy said "my name's Johnny and it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet, you're gonna regret
'Cause I'm the best that's ever been"

[Chorus 1]
Johnny you rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard
'Cause hells broke loose in Georgia and the devil deals the cards
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose, the devil gets your soul

[Verse 2]
The devil opened up his case and he said "I'll start this show"
And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow
And he pulled the bow across his strings and it made an evil hiss
Then a band of rednecks joined in and it sounded something like this
When the devil finished, Johnny said
"Well you're pretty good ol' son
But sit your ass in that chair
Right there, and let me show you how it's done"
Fire on the mountain, run boys, run
The devil's in the house of the risin' sun
Chicken in the bread pan, pickin' out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no yee-haw

[Chorus 2]
The devil bowed his head 'cause he knew that he'd been beat
He laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet
Johnny said "Devil just come on back if you think you've got it in ya
'Cause I'll make you squeal just like a pig from West by god Virginia"

[Outro]
Fire on the mountain, run boys, run
The devil's in the house of the risin' sun
Chicken in the bread pan, pickin' out dough
Granny, will your dog bite? No, child, no yee-haw
