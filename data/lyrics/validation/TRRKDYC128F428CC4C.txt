The things I'll do for you
Make you forget what he put you through
Take away the pain, just trust in me
I wanna be everything that you need

I won't cheat or lie
I'll do the best, never make you cry
Give you the world if you were mine
Girl, if you only knew the things I'll do for you

Where's your man? Baby, did you tell him it's the end?
What did he have to say
When you told him that you needed space?
Your own place, that things have changed

All this time inside he left you crying
His other girls always kept him lying
But baby, when you had enough, you know what's up
I will be right here

The things I'll do for you
Make you forget what he put you through
Take away the pain, just trust in me
I wanna be everything that you need

I won't cheat or lie
I'll do the best, never make you cry
Give you the world if you were mine
Girl, if you only knew the things I'll do for you

Moving on can really be hard
But understand from me you've got no pressure
Healing's gonna take some time
But what I provide will ease your mind

Girl, I can't hold it inside
I'm letting go all of my pride
Caress your heart in tenderness
Your loveliness has captured my mind

The things I'll do for you
Make you forget what he put you through
Take away the pain, just trust in me
I wanna be everything that you need

I won't cheat or lie
I'll do the best, never make you cry
Give you the world if you were mine
Girl, if you only knew the things I'll do for you

I been loving you for so long
I know that it ain't wrong
Baby, let me show you how good
My love can be to you

The things I'll do for you
Roses in the bedroom
Sing you a song if that turns you on
Or we can listen to the quiet storm

Lay you down by the fire
Do the things to keep you satisfied
Give you the world if you were mine
If you knew the things I'll do

The things I'll do for you
Make you forget what he put you through
Take away the pain, just trust in me
I wanna be everything that you need

I won't cheat or lie
I'll do the best, never make you cry
Give you the world if you were mine
Girl, if you only knew the things I'll do for you

The things I'll do for you
Make you forget what he put you through
Take away the pain, just trust in me
I wanna be everything that you need

I won't cheat or lie
I'll do the best, never make you cry
Give you the world if you were mine
Girl, if you only knew the things I'll do for you

The things I'll do for you
Make you forget what he put you through
Take away the pain, just trust in me
I wanna be everything that you need
