I enter the temple of holy love
And shout your name to God above
I tell myself this is no game
I only hope you feel the same

They say that love's a two way thing
And all of the pleasures it may bring
But our love will never be
Until you give yourself to me

[Chorus 1]
How can I love you more?
How can I love you more?
Please tell me
How can I love you more?
I give you a love so pure

Loosing you would make me feel
Helpless, weak, alone, unreal
Life I could not contemplate
I need your love don't make me wait

Don't tell me it's not enough
I try so hard don't be so tough
I never felt this way before
I'm sick, and baby, you're my cure

[Chorus 2] [x2]
How can I love you more?
How can I love you more?
Oooh baby
How can I love you more?
I give you a love so pure

[Chorus 1]
