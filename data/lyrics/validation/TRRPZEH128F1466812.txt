Hey yo check it out I got a hype rhyme for ya
That I'll rock from London England to the boondocks of Georgia
Intelligent, benevolent, super
All the qualities of H I C the alley-ooper

My main man and me we've been cool since day one
Scoopin' all the fly girls, havin' all the fun
Sport the dope threads and the hundred dollar kicks
Makin' power moves so get off my

Nah I won't say it, cause it's crystal, it's clear
I get the job done each and every year
Back in school I used to act the fool
But I rocked an A average so everything's cool

Tool, my pencil, the mic's my utensil
I wreck the mic check and you can write that in stencil
So you wonder why I made it and your shit is goin' wrong
Hey yo troop, I got it goin' on!

I got it goin' on! I got it goin' on!
I got it goin' on! I got it goin' on!

Hey yo, I'm like a mad man when I get the mic in my hand
I run loose at the mouth cause I really don't give a damn
I'm on a mission, chasin' a dream
When I hear the beats thump I shake like a fiend

And when the notes are blue I do the do with the Us3 crew
Right in the back log, Geoff and Melle Mel y'all
Chillin' on the track boy, mixin' up the schizmo
Keepin' shit in fit form they got it goin' on

Patterns in the poems get you open like a spliff
If you take a sniff you might end up like a stiff
Cause it's funky, a hip-hop junkie is what I am
Straight from Brooklyn with a gun in my hand

I'm just kiddin', or should I say fibbin' or bare faced lyin'
It doesn't matter, you know what I'm implyin'
And if you still don't know what's goin' on
Yo G I got it goin' on!

I got it goin' on! I got it goin' on!
I got it goin' on! I got it goin' on!

Zoom-ga-zoom, zoom-ga-zoom-ga-zay
Sit back relax and I'll make your day
Radical concepts that's my choice
Freak it to the music and flow through my voice

So let's face it, it's time to get back to the basics
Sing a simple song that goes on and on and on
I'm climbin' to the top just like King Kong
And guess what? I got it goin' on!

I got it goin' on! I got it goin' on!
I got it goin' on! I got it goin' on!
I got it goin' on! I got it goin' on!

The drum, the drum, the drum, the drum
The drum is the most important instrument
