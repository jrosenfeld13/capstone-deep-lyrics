Oooowwww

I walk the city streets
And I'm looking for some tushie
I want to feel, I want to touch
And not just some hoochie koochie
9 to 5, half alive
Devil in a sheepskin
Time to die, the beast is out
I'm going down in sin
I remember shadows
I'm leaving for my grave
Something's in the air tonight
You can smell it all the way

Night wolf, Night wolf
Burning with desire
Night wolf, night wolf
Turn my heart on fire
Night wolf, night wolf
Burning with desire
Night wolf, night wolf
Turn my heart on fire

I get my kicks
From rock and roll
Attracted to sensation
Getting high, going out of control
There's a fire in my soul
I'm a tail right on your tail
Looking to get laid
Murder's up, cheap for some
Good times going to stay
Hanging in the shadows
I'm looking for some more
Open up your pearly gates
I'm standing at your door

Chorus

Chorus

Turn my heart on fire
Turn my heart
Turn my heart
Turn my heart
Turn my heart on fire
Fire Fire Fire
