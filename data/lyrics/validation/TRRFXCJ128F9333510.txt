I had joy and I was strong
And I was good at holding on
And I had heart and I had soul
And if I wanted to I could even make it snow
Anytime

Did I look desperate to you
Or did it look like I knew what I was doing
Well all that is true
But as the days get longer
I can't remember
IfI'm getting worse or getting better
At playing this part
Now where did it start

I had joy and I was strong
And I was good at holding on
And I had heart and I had soul
And if I wanted to I could even make it snow
Anytime

Did I run circles around your heart
It was a private mission
It's an old tradition
That I cannot stop
cause if I do they'll catch me and they'll never let me
Keep my secret weapon hidden in the bedroom
At the top of the stairs
Man, I hope it's still there

I had joy and I was strong
And I was good at holding on
And I had heart and I had soul
And if I wanted to I could even make it snow
Anytime

All I wanna do is run
All I wanna do is fly
I've been saved so many times
Just from staring at the sky
I'm still staring at the sky
And I'll never understand
Why

I know my way through these woods
And though the paths have faded
And the trees have shaded
Where my heart once stood still
I still feel it beating
All the years mean nothing
I am still believing
I can see the touching
Of my soul and the sun
I close my eyes and I've won

I had joy and I was strong
And I was good at holding on
And I had heart and I had soul
And if I wanted to I could even make it snow
Anytime
Oh where did that little girl go
I need to find her
I need to find her so I can get through this show
Do you know?
