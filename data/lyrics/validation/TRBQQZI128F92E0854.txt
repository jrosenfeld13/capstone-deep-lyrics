[Intro]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey

[Verse 1]
Blast beats, arena seats
And a ringtone by The Saints 		(ooo ooo)
Dont know much about those weekend punks
But Ive heard they have a claim to fame

Street fights and open mikes
Where the bar chords meet the beats	(ooo ooo)
Anthems written for the discontent
But the eyeliner is key

[Chorus]
The punks are writing love songs 	(Oh-oh)
The punks are writing love songs 	(Oh-oh)
The punks are writing love songs 	(Oh-oh)
Theyre mixing up the bag 		(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

The punks are writing love songs 	(Oh-oh)
The punks are writing love songs 	(Oh-oh)
The punks are writing love songs 	(Oh-oh)
Theyre mixing up the bag 		(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

[Bridge]
Hoods up
Poetry from the cul-de-sacs 		(ooo ooo ooo)
Bats out
Anarchy with a note attached 		(ooo ooo ooo)
Blast beats
Uno seats in the photographs 		(ahh ahh ahhhhhhh)
Theyre taking lyrics from the teddy boys
They sing attack, attack, attack

[Chorus]
The punks are writing love songs 	(Oh-oh)
The punks are writing love songs 	(Oh-oh)
The punks are writing love songs 	(Oh-oh)
Theyre mixing up the bag 		(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

The punks are writing love songs 	(Oh-oh)
The punks are writing love songs 	(Oh-oh)
The punks are writing love songs 	(Oh-oh)
Theyre mixing up the bag 		(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

[Verse 2]
Has-beens and safety pins
Avoid The Voidoids and their curse(ooo ooo)
You want your record on the radio
Youd better sweeten up that verse

Abbreviate the longish names
You can bet that hearts will beat	(ooo ooo)
The sort-of clever and nostalgic ones
Will sing their poems at breakneck speed

[Chorus]
The punks are writing love songs 	(Oh-oh)
The punks are writing love songs 	(Oh-oh)
The punks are writing love songs 	(Oh-oh)
Theyre mixing up the bag 		(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

The punks are writing love songs 	(Oh-oh)
The punks are writing love songs	(Oh-oh)
The punks are writing love songs 	(Oh-oh)
Theyre mixing up the bag 		(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

[Bridge]
Hoods up
Poetry from the cul-de-sacs 		(ooo ooo ooo)
Bats out
Anarchy with a note attached 		(ooo ooo ooo)
Blast beats
Uno seats in the photographs 		(ahh ahh ahhhhhhh)
Theyre taking lyrics from the teddy boys
They sing attack, attack, attack

[Chorus]
The punks are writing love songs 	(Oh-oh)
The punks are writing love songs 	(Oh-oh)
The punks are writing love songs 	(Oh-oh)
Theyre mixing up the bag 		(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

The punks are writing love songs 	(Oh-oh)
The punks are writing love songs	(Oh-oh)
The punks are writing love songs 	(Oh-oh)
Theyre mixing up the bag 		(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
