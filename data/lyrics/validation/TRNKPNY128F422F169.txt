Somwhere in line there's a traitor
No way
And you know that's a sign from pressure from outside
This time around
Coercion, renegades against the wall
Shaking out of anxious boredom
Can't wait to fly to regain composure in my life again
Somehow the opposition has been informed
Can't tolerate the uncommitted numbers
The faction must re-encode the mission
