I was thinking it did sound like you were saying
"none of my friends are drugs"
But then it said "all my friends are drunks"
That's not funny at all

While I sit here on my ass

Looking to get in a fight
Cause all of my friends are drunks

All of my friends are drunks

'cause they like to hum along
While I sing these shitty songs
Cause all of my friends are drunks
