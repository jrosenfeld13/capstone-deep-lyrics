Katie was a kid, I guess she hid her thoughts from everyone
Went to school at eight, she was never late
Didn't know the meaning of fun
Every night Katie prayed to God above
But her daddy gave her everything but love

She woke up one day, said: "I'm on my way"
Her mummy read the letter, It did say:
"I'm on my way, I'm on my way"

Riding with the angels
Riding with the angels
Riding with the angels

Riding with the angels
She's having fun, fun, fun
She's having fun, fun, fun

Rode around and every boy in town tried to win her back
It was no go, cause she rode with Joe, he was the leader of the pack
People ran for cover when they rolled to town
The night was black, rain on the ground

Engines scream, running too fast
They knew the ride would be there last
They're on their way, on their way

Riding with the angels
Riding with the angels
Riding with the angels

Riding with the angels
She's having fun, fun, fun
She's having fun, fun, fun

Riding with the angels
Riding with the angels
Riding with the angels

Riding with the angels
She's having fun, fun, fun
She's having fun, fun, fun

Riding with the angels
She's having fun, fun, fun
She's having fun, fun, fun
