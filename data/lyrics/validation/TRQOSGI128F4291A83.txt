When you get the time
Sit down and write me a letter
When you're feeling better
Drop me a line

I want to know how it all works out
I had a feeling we were fading out
I didn't know that people faded out so fast
That people faded out
When there was love enough left to fix it
But there it is

There it is
We were only one push from the nest
There it is
We were only one argument from death
There it is
The sun rises but the...
The sun also sets
The sun sets
The sun also sets

When you get these feelings
Next time, next time
Oh, be sure
You can tear someone apart

I want to know how it all works out
I had a feeling we were fading out
I didn't know that people faded out
That people faded out so fast

I want to show you what I got inside
But you know all of those parts of me died
Just like that they faded out
They faded out so fast
And there was love enough left to fix it
But there it is

(Mhm...)
There it is
We were only one shove from the nest
There it is
We were only one argument from death
There it is
We were only one moment from death
There it is
We were only one push from the nest
There it is
There it is
There it is
We were only one push from the nest
There it is
We were only one moment from death
There it is
The sun rises but the...
The sun also sets
The sun sets
The sun also sets
