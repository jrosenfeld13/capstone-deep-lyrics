Blow, blow down your door
You wanted less, but you got more
Blow, blow down your door
Walk the path, walk the floor

If I x4

Devil's gonna make you turn
Red, red hot and burn
Devil's gonna make you turn
Never lose and never learn

If I x8

Long, long way home
I was leaving, I was gone
Long, long way home
You were calling me beyond
Fall down, kneel, cry
Tell my heart, I won't deny
Fall down, kneel, cry
Alright, testify!

If I x8

What you gonna do when you're
Earth to the ground no more
What you gonna do when you're
6 feet down and you're...

Hey
If I x8

Long, long way home
I was leaving, I was gone
Long, long way home
You were calling me beyond
Fall down, kneel, cry
Tell my heart, I won't deny
Fall down, kneel, cry
Alright, testify!

Speak out tongue, find the word
Speak out tongue, now I heard
Speak out soul, hold the line
Speak out soul, day and night

Speak out tongue, find the word
Speak out tongue, now I heard
Speak out tongue, find the word
Speak out tongue...
