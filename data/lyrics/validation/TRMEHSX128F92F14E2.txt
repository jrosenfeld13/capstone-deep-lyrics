Whenever I call you friend
I begin to think I understand
Anything we are
You and I have always been ever and ever
I see myself within your eyes
And that's all I need to show me why
Everything I do, always takes me home to you ever and ever

Now I know my life has given me more than memories
Day by day we can see
In every moment there's a reason to carry on

Chorus:
Sweet love showing us a heavenly light
I've never seen such a beautiful sight
Sweet love flowing almost every night
I know forever well be doing it

Sweet love showing us a heavenly light
I've never seen such a beautiful sight
Sweet love flowing almost every night
I know forever well be doing it right

Whenever I call you friend
I believe I've come to understand
Everywhere we are
You and I were meant to be forever and ever
I think about the times to come
Knowing I will be the lucky one
Ever our love will last
I always want to call you friend

Repeat Chorus

Now I know my life has given me more than memories
Day by day we can see
In every moment there's a reason to carry on

Repeat Chorus

Sweet love...sweet love
You're the glowing light in my life
The source of pride in my life
Everything I do takes me back to you
