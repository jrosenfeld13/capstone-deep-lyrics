[Intro]
Strange things
Seem like a strange thing

[Verse 1]
Strange things are happening nowadays, my friend
Seems like we are near to the end
But we've got hopes in Jah Jah, yes I know
To guide us through and through, day by day

[Chorus]
Let's live in love, brothers
Let's live in love, sisters
We can do it, if we only try
Let's live in harmony, as it should always be
Let's live in love, in love and unity

[Verse 2]
Remember how we used to stick together, now
Stick together like birds of a feather
Vanity has led some of us astray
But hear me now before it's too late

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Seems like a strange thing, ah.. yes
Come and let us join us together, now
Make this world a better place
Oh, we got to learn to live in harmony
Come on, come on, come on, hear me now!

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Let's live in love, in love and unity
Let's live in love, in love and unity
We got to live in love..
