There was a fine rain
There was a red wine
There was a long whistle
It was a good sign

There was a band playin'
Somewhere off-screen
There was a girl sayin'
'Come clean.'

CHORUS
In a dream
On a bus
On a busted afternoon
In a haze
On a bus
On a busted afternoon
In a bad way
On a busted afternoon

There was a sad truth
There was a punch line
There was a long whistle
It was a good sign

There was a long goodbye
There was a long goodbye

(Repeat Chorus)
