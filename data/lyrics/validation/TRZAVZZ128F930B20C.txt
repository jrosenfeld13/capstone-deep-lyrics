I read directions - I read the signs
For my protection I would resign

All around the island
I can see the crowd
Back into the middle
Where I could think out loud to myself

Chasing rainbow colors
Try to learn my name
I was never good at this game

No remedy - I'm not so bad
No comedy - I'm feeling bad
No felony - but I've been had

I dropped a package - began to shake
Nowhere to hide from the rattlesnake

Deep inside the island wrapped in cellophane
Trying to be normal
But I can't stand the pain in myself

Chasing rainbow colors
Try to learn my name
I was never good at this game

No remedy - I'm not so bad
No comedy - I'm feeling bad
No felony - but I've been had

Aahhh

I don't know any monsters, no conspiracy
Even with the surface feeling slippery
And I think that I know you
At least to some degree in myself

Chasing rainbow colors
Try to learn my name
I was never good at this game
