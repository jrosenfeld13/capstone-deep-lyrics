Now, while embodying the enemy
Damnation. Why scream of retribution, when no prayer of the unopened hands helping out
Infected by words of creation they learn, swarming the light the forsaken, implausible burn
Now, with confidence, we burn the chains to love, that warm embrace, so I let go, and with confidence drag the rope
And for this, than like a wish they worked careful and close as they burnt you out
Return me bastard child, will burn by my side
Write the spiral out. Accepting the hope in a failure burrowing deep inside time as we soullessly beat in a lie the path we'll walk tonight
In a prayer I walk in silence so destroy; now inside themselves they fold
With confidence. This is our time. I will not die
Revoke. Revolving
I am, to be renewed
