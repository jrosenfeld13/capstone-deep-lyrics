Let's take the long way home tonight
Just cruise along the boulevards
Let's shine a little, we're the street lights
And dream ourselves away to Mars
Let's follow all the stars above
Or maybe take the subway home

These days are mine
And I'm gonna take it slow
Like the peaceful waters flow
I'll make it up as I go
That's all I really know
So let's take the long way home

Let's cry a little if we wanna
Or laugh out loud the best we can
Let's meet the comfort of convenience
And search a silence deep within
Let's stay a while and take it easy
If that's something you can overcome
Let's take a minute just to slip away
And linger on before it's gone

These days are mine
And I'm gonna take it slow
Like the peaceful waters flow
I'll make it up as I go
That's all I really know
So let's take the long way home

These days are mine
And I'm gonna take it slow
Like the peaceful waters flow
I'll make it up as I go
That's all I really know
So let's take the long way home

And I'm gonna take it slow
Like the peaceful waters flow

And that's all I really know
So let's take the long way home
