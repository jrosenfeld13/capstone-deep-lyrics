As I ramble around on the outskirts of town
Visions from the past fill my mind
I remember the day that you went away
And each and every tear that I cried

Chorus:
Autumn chill cuts the air
Leaves blow through the sky
I feel your spirit everywhere
I can hear you sigh.restless wind

I look back on the past, time has gone by so fast
Since those trips to the hills where you lived
When I was young you were always so strong
You seemed to have the world on a string

Chorus

Roots run deep
And you ran faster than the wind
Roots run deep
I still feel all the love you send

Chorus

I turn back towards my home but I don't feel alone
Like I did when I left for the night
Cause you're right here with me and now I can see
The spirit and the soul never die

Chorus
