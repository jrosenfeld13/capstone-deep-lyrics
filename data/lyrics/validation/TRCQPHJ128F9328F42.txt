Life is a ball game
Bein' played each day
Life is a ball game
Everybody can play

Yes you know, Jesus standing at the home plate
He is waiting for you there
You know, the life is a ball game
But you've got to play it fast

The first phase is temptation
You know the second phase is sin
The third phase tribulation
If you pass, you can make it in

Old man Solomon is the umpire
And Satan pitchin' a game
He'll do his best, strike you out
He playin' just the same

You know, Daniel's up to bat first
You know, he pray three times a day
Yes Satan pitched him a fast ball
But he hit it anyway

Yes you know, Job is up to bat next
Satan's struck him in every way
But Job hit a home run
And he came on in that day

Yes you know, prayer is a strong bat
To hit at Satan's ball
And when you start to swing it
You got to give it your all and all

Yes you know, the priest gonna be your catcher
And on him you can depend
Oh Jesus standing at the home plate
And He is waiting for you to come in

Yes you know, Moses is on the sidelines
Waiting to be called
You know, the day he parted the Red Sea
Little price all and all

Then John came in the ninth inning
And the game was almost done
Then God gave John a vision
And he knew we'd already won

Yes you know life is a ball game
Being played each day
You know life is a ball game
Each and everybody can play

Yes you know, Jesus is standing at the home plate
He is waiting for you there
Well you know, life is a ball game
But you've got to play it fast
