[Verse 1]
Strike this match and let loose the oven's breath
Up the volume that flirts with the UHF
Swipe the magnet on the audio tape
These arsons of grand larceny
Keep running, keep running in place
Achilles tendon severed from the race

[Chorus 1]
Quick to the throat in this ink cartridge funeral
Well, marble caps-lock, zip code affiliate
You've got a run on your pharmaceuticals
You better change it before the night grows old

[Verse 2]
Set the temperature at delete
Keep running, keep running in place
Let's hit the neighborhood today

[Chorus 1]
Quick to the throat in this ink cartridge funeral
Well, marble caps-lock, zip code affiliate
You've got a run on your pharmaceuticals
You better change it before the night grows old

[Chorus 2]
You got a run on your pharmaceuticals
You better change it before the night grows old
Prescriptions filled, now cut your suit and tie cuticles
You cut your fingernails way too short

[Outro x4]
Well, what if forensics finds the answers?
What if they stole my fingerprints?
Where did I leave my book of matches?
We'll find you
