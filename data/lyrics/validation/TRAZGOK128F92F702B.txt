There's no sight she'd rather see
Than poor ol' broken hearted me

I've never been the kinda man
To let a woman change my plan
But all of that was history
When she sho 'nuff did this to me
Her lies they won me over quick
She ruled my mind, my heart, my dick
I took the line, the hook, the bait
And now I'm sick from what I ate

There's no sight she'd rather see
Than poor ol' broken hearted me
Her mission is my misery
Poor ol' broken hearted me

The force of her magnetic pull was cruel and unusual
And when she calls, I wag my tail
I'm harder than a coffee nail
A pilgrim on my bended knees
I'd cross the desert if it please you
Baby treat me as you will
Yours to bless, yours to kill

There's no sight she'd rather see
Than poor ol' broken hearted me
So Happy when I'm on my knees
Poor ol' broken hearted me

She'll get bored of me one day
Or I'll resolve to walk away
With good intent my road is paved
But I'm not sure I want to be saved

There's no sight she'd rather see
Than poor ol' broken hearted me
Her mission is my misery
Poor ol' broken hearted me

There's no sight she'd rather see
Than poor ol' broken hearted me
So Happy when I'm on my knees
Poor ol' broken hearted me

There's no sight, no sight, no sight she'd rather see
Poor old broken hearted me
Her mission is, mission is, mission is my misery
Poor old broken hearted me
