I can't keep running away from you
And I know
I've gotta get the guts to get you
Right back in the ground where I found you
If I reach inside will I find the truth?
I can't keep wearing myself out
So I'll shed my skin and start again
I wanna let you know
I've got a heart like a f*cking machine
And my blood is burning gasoline
Tonight we're digging graves
Tonight we radiate
And my life's about to change
I'm kicking out the skeletons tonight
You're no longer welcome in my closet anymore
