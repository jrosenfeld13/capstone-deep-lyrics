[Verse 1]
Would you spare me a minute, give me a single chance
To look in your eyes, let me hold your hand?
I want to get close enough to read you, understand you
Open up your heart, open up your mind
Nobody needs another stalker in your life
I'm only here to help you learn to love me, to know me

[Chorus]
I need a hook so you won't be the one that got away
I need a look that stuns you, makes you want to stay
Don't wanna speak in case it comes out wrong
Don't wanna blink 'cause in the second, you could be gone
I need a twist to help me turn, turn this story around
I need a bridge to cross this dangerous ground
Meet me in the middle like I want you to
I gotta find your heart to shoot my arrow through

[Verse 2]
Did you see me staring, uh, you caught my eye?
Don't turn around, don't walk away
The night is young, can we get together? Ooh
Got so many questions, feelings I can't explain
We're worlds apart, don't even know your name
I'm longing to give you my heart

[Chorus]
I need a hook so you won't be the one that got away
I need a look that stuns you, makes you want to stay
Don't wanna speak in case it comes out wrong
Don't wanna blink 'cause in the second, you could be gone
I need a twist to help me turn, turn this story around
I need a bridge to cross this dangerous ground
Meet me in the middle like I want you to
I gotta find your heart to shoot my arrow through

[Bridge]
Turn around (don't evaporate)
Like you never came (turn around)
Don't be a ghost forever never there to haunt me
Sliding doors, they aren't just on a train
We're alone on a platform in the rain
There's a chance and it won't come again
Turn around, your whole life has changed

[Chorus]
I need a hook so you won't be the one that got away
I need a look that stuns you, makes you want to stay
Don't wanna speak in case it comes out wrong
Don't wanna blink 'cause in the second, you could be gone
I need a twist to help me turn, turn this story around
I need a bridge to cross this dangerous ground
Meet me in the middle like I want you to
I gotta find your heart to shoot my arrow through

[Outro]
Turn around
Turn around
