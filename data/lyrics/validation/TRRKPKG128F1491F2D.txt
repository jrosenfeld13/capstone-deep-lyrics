Who knows what's right
Lily you don't have to when you see the moon
You trust its light
The crickets sing loud
Lily you can hear it in their voices how you've made them proud

At the top of your voice there is no doing wrong i swear
Lily you be just who you are

Don't keep appointments
With disappointment
Hiding in a hiding place you don't have to look away
The mississippi brings new water every day

Look at the sun how it glows in a million waves
Lily there are just as many ways

At the top of your voice there is no doing wrong i swear
Lily you be just who you are

Southern skies
Lily you're connected to the stars and to the world tonight

The night is fair
Lily it can promise that the next day there'll be
So much there
