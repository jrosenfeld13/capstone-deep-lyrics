Hear my voice
As we talk about love
And I feel your heart
As we share all our faults
I don't seem to understand
Is this the way you made your plan
To fall in and out of love
See to you I speak the truth
All my love I give to you
Only thing I asking for

(chorus)
Please don't break my heart
See I don't play games with love (2x)
Feel my heart
Every beat is filled with love
Though times will be hard, (so hard)
Our love with remain strong
Can you tell me
See I don't understand the view
That to win you've got to lose
Is not what I'm living for
See to you I speak the truth
That there is no substitute
When you find the one true love

(chorus)
Please don't break my heart
See i don't play games with love (2x)
