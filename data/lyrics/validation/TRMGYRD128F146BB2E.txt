Hey hey it's okay to
Make a little mess out of your life
'Cause you don't need a diagram
To tell you how to have a good time

I said hey (hey)
Don't mean to frighten you away
This is Cracker soul, it comes so easy
I said hey (hey)
Don't get your head a mess
This is just the best, it comes so easy
It comes so easy

Hey hey it's okay to never know
The answer but ask why (why oh why?)
You don't need another burden
Come and party with your spirit guide

I said hey (hey)
Don't get your head a mess
This is Cracker Soul
It comes so easy
I said hey (hey)
Don't get yourself distressed
Love is just the best
When comes easy
It comes so easy
