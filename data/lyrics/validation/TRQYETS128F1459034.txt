You get the wrong impression of me
You think I would not miss yer if you did not come
It's obvious you don't see clearly
'Cause if you did you'd see how all at sea I am

Now if you took a careful look
You might just see the horizon and me
And if you took another look
You might discern - my concern

I'm not waving I'm drowning
Why don't you save me?
'Cos you are the only one who can
I'm not waving I'm drowning
C'mon an' save me
You are the only one who can

Though our relationship is sinkin'
It could be salvaged if we do not lose our head
It would be wrong of you in thinkin'
It's past recovery, that would be short-sighted

Now if you took a careful look
You might just see the horizon and me
And if you took another look
You might discern - my concern

I'm not waving I'm drowning
Why don't you save me?
'Cos you are the only one who can
I'm not waving I'm drowning
C'mon an' save me
'Cause you are the only one who can

I'm not waving I'm drowning
Why don't you save me?
You are the only one who can
I'm not waving I'm drowning
So c'mon an' save me
'Cos you are the only one who can
C'mon an' save me
