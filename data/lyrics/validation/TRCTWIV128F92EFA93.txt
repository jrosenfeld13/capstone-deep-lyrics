Out here on this road
I had a feeling, that I'd find a meaning
But everything's moving so slow
I'm caught between to and fro
And I've still got a long way to go
Still on the pathway I only got half way
Caught up in the ebb and the flow
My head is reeling
Got lost in a feeling
And I don't know which way to go
Maybe where the winter wind blows?
Or out where the wild river flows?
I've got a puzzle in my mind
Where's the place between high and low?
Maybe one day I'll know
Maybe one day I'll know
But I've still got a long way to go
I've still got a long way to go
I've still got a long way to go
I've still got a long way to go
I've still got a long way to go
