I'm choosing words that seem to be forgotten
As I use them
These are the words that let me be forgiveen
The minute I choose them
So I won't try try try
To sell my advice
It's meant to be forgotten
The minute you try
The lies take the place
Of advice

But I can't say
If I'm awake
Like I say
We're built that way where I'm from
An extension of
Lacan's way
A mirror stage
Of disappointment
Where you're from

Give me a clue when these words were written
In reference to use them
So when they're gone they intend to be forgotten
The minute you choose them
There's not much point
Accepting your advice
Like oh to be forgotten
It only takes two minutes for you
To change your mind

But I can't say
If I'm awake
Like I say
We're built that way where I'm from
An extension of
Lacan's way
A mirror stage
Of disappointment
Where you're from
