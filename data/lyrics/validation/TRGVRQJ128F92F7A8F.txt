I just wanna remember you
The way you're standin' there
With that 'hurry home'-look in your eyes
And flowers on the table

Sometimes I see too much
Sometimes I see too little
Sometimes shadows fall, darken all
And cover up the fable

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Everytime that I see your face
It's like cool, cool water runnin' down my back
Cool, cool runnin' down my back

Sometimes I see my memories
Like a film that never stops
Although I know how it ends
Still I can't help but watch

There's a break in the clouds
As I feel myself shiver
Still, there's no light comin' through
No reflection on the river

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Everytime that I see your face
It's like cool, cool water runnin' down my back
Cool, cool water runnin' down my back

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Everytime that I see your face
It's like cool, cool water runnin' down my back
Cool, cool water runnin' down my back
Cool, cool water runnin' down my back
Cool, cool water runnin' down my back
Cool, cool water runnin' down my back
