[Verse 1]
I don't pick up the mail, I don't pick up the phone
I don't answer the door, I'd just as soon be alone
I don't keep this place up, I just keep the lights down
I don't live in these rooms, I just rattle around

[Chorus]
I'm just a ghost in this house
I'm just a shadow upon these walls
As quietly as a mouse I haunt these halls
I'm just a whisper of smoke
I'm all that's left of two hearts on fire
That once burned out of control and took my body and soul
I'm just a ghost in this house

[Verse 2]
I don't mind if it rains, I don't care if it's clear
I don't mind staying in, there's another ghost here
She sits down in your chair and she shines with your light
And she lays down her head on your pillow at night

Chorus:
I'm just a ghost in this house
I'm just a shell of the man I was
A living proof of the damage heartbreak does
I'm just a whisper of smoke
I'm all that's left of two hearts on fire
That once burned out of control and took my body and soul
I'm just a ghost in this house

[Chorus]
I'm just a ghost in this house
I'm just a shadow upon these walls
As quietly as a mouse I haunt these halls
I'm just a whisper of smoke
I'm all that's left of two hearts on fire
That once burned out of control and took my body and soul
I'm just a ghost in this house
