Taking in the party
He put me down for awhile
100 watts of ambition
Springing off his smile
His lips looked set to kiss me
But he closed up like a fist
He's got a fortune in charm
And makes a gift out of empty arms
But i was sold, i was sold, no one had to convince me
Bendng over backwards
I watched the light burn out
His excuses fell like diamonds
Brilliant, cutting, lost and found
He's got a fortune in charm
And makes a gift out of empty arms
But i was sold, i was sold, no one had to convince me
(i don't believe it)
(believe it)
