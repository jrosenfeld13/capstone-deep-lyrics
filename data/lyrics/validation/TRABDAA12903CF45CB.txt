I won't bow down
To the god of this wold
False prophets who sell
Their souls for silver and gold
I won't rest until
Your idols fall to the ground
Just try and stop me
Just try and stop me now
So take your best shot
Show me what you got
So take your best shot
Is that all you got
I'm not going to be afraid
Tonight, I'm not gonna run away
I'm not going to be afraid
Tonight I'm ready
Show me what you got
You think you're so tough
Take your best shot
Is that all you got
Come on, come on
If God is for us
Who can be against us
