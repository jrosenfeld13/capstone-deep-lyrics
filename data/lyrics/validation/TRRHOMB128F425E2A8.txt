Today will be the saddest day
Because my love, he's gone away
Tonight will be the longest night
Without him by my side

One more chance is all I ask
Darling, say it's not too late
One more chance is all I ask
Life without you I can't take

Tomorrow brings the hardest road
My broken heart a heavy load
And I cannot see a light
Anywhere down the line

One more chance is all I ask
Darling, say it's not too late
One more chance is all I ask
Life without you I can't take

One more chance is all I ask
Darling, say it's not too late
One more chance is all I ask
Life without you I can't take
