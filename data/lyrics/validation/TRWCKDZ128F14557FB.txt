[Verse 1]
Summer moved on
And the way it goes you can't tag along
Honey moved out
And the way it went leaves no doubt

[Pre-Chorus]
Moments will pass
In the morning light I found out
Seasons can't last
And there's just one thing left to ask

[Chorus]
Stay, don't just walk away
And leave me another day
A day just like today
With nobody else around

[Verse 2]
Friendships move on
Until the day you can't get along
Handshakes unfold
And the way it goes no one knows

[Pre-Chorus]
Moments will pass
In the morning light I found out
Reasons can't last
So there's just one thing left to ask

[Chorus]
Stay, don't just walk away
And leave me another day
A day just like today
With nobody else around

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Reasons can't last
And there's just one thing left to ask

[Chorus]
Stay, don't just walk away
And leave me another day
A day just like today
With nobody else around

[Outro]
Summer moved on
