They were partners in crime
When the wife admits
That her son had been taking
What the neighbors have missed
There's a law in the city
And it's clear as a nail
You don't blame who you have
You just take what you steal

But nobody told him that
"It's up to you deciding
You're getting the lock
Or giving it"
His family moans in disapproval
It's damaging but not threatening

The partners in crime
Were ahead at the finish
The P.I. started detecting
Where the family had lived
And his jaw started to squeak
And the kid started to spill
He attached to the manila
That he had hired them all

The lieutenant underestimated
His need for notoriety

He spilled when they told him
"It was up to you deciding
You're getting the lock
Or giving it"
His family moans in disapproval
It's damaging but not threatening

And it was up to you deciding
You're getting the lock
Or giving it
His family moans in disapproval
It's damaging but not threatening
