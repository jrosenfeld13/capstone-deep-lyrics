The city feels clean this time of night
Just empty streets and me walking home
To clear my head
I know it came as no surprise
I'm affected more than I had guessed
By what was said

If this love's not meant to be
If a heart's not ready to open
If the naked eye won't see
It's broken

If this love's not meant to be
If a heart's not ready to open
If the naked eye won't see
Oh, it's broken

It's a quiet time before the dawn
And I'm half past making sense of it
Was I wrong?
Should I think to give it all?
In a world where not much ever seems
To last long

If this love's not meant to be
If a heart's not ready to open
If the naked eye won't see
It's broken

If this love's not meant to be
If a heart's not ready to open
If the naked eye won't see
Oh, it's broken

If this love's not meant to be
If a heart's not ready to open
If the naked eye won't see
It's broken

If this love's not meant to be
If a heart's not ready to open
If the naked eye won't see
Oh, it's broken

If this love's not meant to be
If a heart's not ready to open
If the naked eye won't see
It's broken

If this love's not meant to be
If a heart's not ready to open
If the naked eye won't see
Oh, it's broken

Oh, it's broken
Oh, it's broken
