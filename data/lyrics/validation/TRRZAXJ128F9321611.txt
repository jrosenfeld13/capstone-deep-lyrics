I fall into your trash bin once again
Same kind of story
I know what's happened every time before
Still I want more

I wonder who and what I'm fighting for
Maybe it's you
I'm maybe better off oblivious too
While they're having fun with you

I've heard of your ghosts
Why won't they let you go?
I've heard of your ghosts
Why won't they let us get on with our love?

I'm coming to your rescue once again
It always happens
Though I don't know what to save you from and why
I never see them come

I've heard that you hang out with your old friends again
Always doing something
What can I do to stop them from hunting you again?
Disappear into the blues

I've heard of your ghosts
Why won't they let you go?
I've heard of your ghosts
Why won't they let us get on with our love?

Why won't they let us go on
With our love?
Why won't they let us go on?

I've heard of your ghosts
Why won't they let you go? (I-I-I-I-I....)
I've heard of your ghosts
Why won't they let us get on on on on on... (I've heard of your ghosts)

I've heard of your ghosts
Why won't they let you go? (ah ah ah ahhh)
I've heard of your ghosts (I've heard)
Why won't they let us get on with our love?
