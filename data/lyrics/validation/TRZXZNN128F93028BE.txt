All I wanted was something to hold dear
Something to hold near to my heart
Denied again I'm left with a bitter taste in my mouth and a heart as cold as ice
With no warmth in sight your embrace feels like a slap to my face
So shallow and fake will this ever end. will my torment ever cease
Wishing I could feel nothing. a life dead to love
All I wanted was something to hold dear. something to hold near to my heart
Denied again I'm left with a bitter taste in my mouth and a heart as cold as ice
With no warmth in sight hoping for a heart that can feel no pain
Rip this from my chest so I can never find it in myself to love and forgive you
Will my torment ever cease. wishing I could feel nothing. a life dead to love
Free from love. free from emotion. I'm free from you
