[Verse 1]
Talking bout Jumping Jim, talking bout Mud Slide Slim
Don't you know that a fish got to swim, don't a goose got to fly high?
Little dog got to die and I'm going home
Woh, don't you know. Woh, don't you know
Talking bout a life on the street, going to think about an itch in my Feet
Can't you hand me down them highway shoes?
Lord knows I'm talking about the walking blues

[Chorus]
Got the rocking pneumonia blues and I'm headed home, bye-bye
Woh, don't you know. Woh, don't you know

[Verse 2]
Listen here now, don't you come round talking bout over yonder Listen
Bound to wake up the walking man in me and I'm bound to Wandering, hey now
Talking all about spooning into bone, looking just like Sherlock Holmes
Looking for a needle in a haystack, seeing and eating lots of fatback

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Woh, who, don't you know. You ought to know, you ought to know You ought to know
You ought to know like a fish in the stream, ought to know like a leaf On the tree
Ought to know like a boat in the sea
