We've been good friends so very long
Oh but now I'm feelin' something much more strong
You make me feel so good
When you move like you should
Ooh, what I'm thinking can't be wrong

I always knew that it was true
That there was rhythm deep inside of you
Now I can't wait no more
To get you on that floor
And that's not all that we can do

Clap your hands (You got to clap your hands now) Background repeats 4x
Clap your hands (You got to clap your hands)
Ooh, clap your hands, baby
Clap your hands

I see it in the way you dance
That you are looking, looking for romance
I'll give you such a thrill, you'll never get your fill
If you just give me half a chance

Clap your hands (You got to clap your hands now) Background repeats 4x
Clap your hands (You got to clap your hands)
Ooh, clap your hands, baby
Clap your hands

You got to clap your hands now
You got to clap your hands
(repeat)
Oooh, ooh, oh yeah
You got to clap your hands now
You got to clap your hands

Clap your hands (You got to clap your hands now) Background repeats 4x
Clap your hands (You got to clap your hands)
Ooh, clap your hands, baby
Clap your hands
