Your best friend, your best girl
Just made a big mess o' your world
'Cause arm in arm they left you feelin' blue
She set a trap, you got caught
You should a took her with a grain o' salt
So have a little faith and love will come to you

So she's leavin' for somebody new
She's even got you believin'
There's nothin' you can do
Brush that teardrop off your face
And put a smile back in its place
Have a little faith and love will come to you

Beyond the clouds the sky is always blue
Have a little faith and love will come to you

So don't be lonely and don't be blue
Your one and only is somewhere waitin' just for you
With two lovin' arms to hug your neck
Is right around the corner where you least expect
She'll be there with love to pull you through
Just have a little faith and love will come to you
