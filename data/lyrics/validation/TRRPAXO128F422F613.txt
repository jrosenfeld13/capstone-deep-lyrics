Great Wall of China
It's so big it's seen from outer space
Put there to keep
Starving neighbors locked outside the gates

So what's changed today?
Empires hoard more than they need and peasants threaten our comfort
We'll build a great wall around our power
Build a great wall around our power

Bankrupt L.A.'s streetcar line
So people pay more to drive
Plant strategic freeways
To divide neighborhoods by color lines

We'd rather pay for riot squads than pump the ghetto back to life
We'll let your schools decay on purpose
To build a great wall around our power
Another great wall around our power

Warlords in gray suits take a different route to work each day
Secondhand green berets form the companies' private armies
We'll take all your gold but won't teach reading or feed your poor
The league of gentlemen would rather feed guns to puppet dictators

There's too many people in your world and refugees are expensive
When they trickle down into our soil we hunt them and arrest them
Classify them insane and put them back on the next plane
To the waiting arms of the same death squads they fled

We've build a great wall around our power
Worldwide great wall around our power
Economic great wall around our power
Give us your poor, your tired, your weak
We'll send 'em right back to their certain death
