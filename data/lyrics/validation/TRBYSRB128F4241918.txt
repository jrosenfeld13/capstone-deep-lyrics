All sprawled out
Laid to rest
Woke up early
Got it again

I feel so stupid today
Why ain't it any other way
It's too late to complain
Bad, bad timing
Ugly saying
Flat out fucked
Flat out fucked
Flat out fucked
Flat out fucked

So mixed up
No room to move
I ain't got nothing
Got nothing to lose

I feel so stupid today
Why ain't it any other way
It's too late to complain
Bad, bad timing
Ugly saying
Flat out fucked
Flat out fucked
Flat out fucked
Flat out fucked
