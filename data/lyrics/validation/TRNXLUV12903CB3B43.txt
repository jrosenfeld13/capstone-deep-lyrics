Got so weary of bein' nothin'
Felt so dreary just doin' nothin'
Didn't care ever gettin' nothin', felt so low
Now my eyes on the far horizon can see a glow
Announcin' things ain't what they used to be
No use bein' a doubtin' Thomas
No ignorin' that rosy promise;
Now I know there's a happy story yet to come
It's the dawn of a day of glory: millennium
I tell you things ain't what they used to be
