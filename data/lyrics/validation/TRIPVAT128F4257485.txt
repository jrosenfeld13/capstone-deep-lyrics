Striking down, in the dead of the night
Armed with swords
To show our bloody might
Like a fierce full storm, coming in from the north
Don't stand against us, we always come forth

Let the horns blow bid farewell to your love
We call upon thor from his mountain above
Ride when the mist clears at breaking of dawn
Ride to invade, to engage
To strike like thunder, thunder.... Thunder

With ships blessed and pressuring oars
We travel afar, to the foreign shores
Hide your woman I say, for cruel are our ways
Hide yourself if you can, this is the end of your days

Those of the brave, that die by the sword
Side by side, they stand proud
To open the gate of valhalla
