We Came Across The West Sea
We Didn't Have Much Idea Of The
Kind Of Climate Waiting
We Used Our Hands For Guidance
Like The Children Of A Preacher
Like A Dry Tree Seeking Water
Or A Daughter

An Angel Came From Outside
Had No Halo Had No Father
With A Coat Of Many Colours
He Spoke Of Brothers Many
Wine And Women Song A Plenty
He Began To Write A Chapter
In History
