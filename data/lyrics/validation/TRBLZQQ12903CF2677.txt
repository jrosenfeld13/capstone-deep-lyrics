With a pistol in both hands
He walked in like he had a plan
Had the eyes of a dead man
Never seen such a blood fan
Bodies twitching while ears ring
Biding time while my heart stings
Got twelve souls, sure of nothing
Wait and see what hell brings
Two tears in a bucket
The river runs red
Two tears in a bucket
Always fear for the undead
Always fear what I said
