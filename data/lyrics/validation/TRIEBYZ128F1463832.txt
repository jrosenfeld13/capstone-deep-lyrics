(bricusse / newley)

Who can i turn to
When nobody needs me?
My heart wants to know
And so i must go
Where destiny leads me
With no star to guide me
And no-one beside me
I'll go on my way
And after the day
The darkness will hide me

And maybe tomorrow
I'll find what i'm after
I'll throw off my sorrow
Beg, steal or borrow
My share of laughter

With you i could learn to
With you on a new day
But who can i turn to if you turn away?
Oh, oh, yeah

With no star to guide me
And nobody beside me
I'll go on my way and after the day
The darkness will hide me

And maybe tomorrow
I'm gonna find what i'm after
I'll throw off my sorrow
Beg, steal or borrow
My share of laughter

With you i could learn to
Oh, with you on a new day
But who can i turn to if you turn away?
