Can I never ever break these wielded gates
Cause I've got a fire burning outside the walls
This time, will the readings become clear?
The days of wondering resounding for years

Toss and turn forever
Sticks and stones lie beneath
Prophecies of disbelief

Could I follow all the loose ends that I've found?
That leads up to the inevitable defeat
And fright and nerves and shades of hurt and thoughts that
Somehow keep swirling towards the bleeding end

Toss and turn forever
Sticks and stones lie underneath
Prophecies of disbelief

Whenever you stopped feeling something
Whenever you stopped feeling weak
I turn again
All I want is to sleep

Once I've settled down
My eyes staring out
But still towards the ground
This headache race
Won't back down
If I make this
It will get its rest
And I try to, you know
But the tightened ropes deny me of the soothing rest
Euphoria

Toss and turn forever
Sticks and stones lie underneath
Prophecies of disbelief

Whenever you stopped feeling something
Whenever you stopped feeling weak
I turn again
All I want is to sleep
