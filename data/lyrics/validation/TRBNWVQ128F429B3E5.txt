White walls and empty hallways
Nine o'clock it's my wake up call
Drip drip what a sinking feeling
Tick tock now it's time to go
Are you scared cuz I'm not baby
We're just not built to last
There's an end to every story
Bye bye flash flash it goes so fast

So when I fall asleep tonight
Could you stay and hold me tight
And could you pray that I wake up here tomorrow
Because The pain is gripping me
And the drugs are as useful as a song
Soft November rain
Washes me away

Do you believe in fallen angels?
Stay here and wish me well
Do you believe we live forever?
Or Lie, die we're going strait to hell
I'm close but you'll get closer
Stay clear and think it through
Cash cash it turns to paper
And when you're six foot down
It's kinda hard to use

Hold me now as I fall to sleep
I'll meet you in your broken dreams
Stay here now as I fall to sleep
I see the light it's taking me away
Will you remember me?
