[Verse 1]
Dear Ms. Leading, I hate to tell you that I no longer need your services
The bitter fabricating manufacturer of lust you have been presented as
Doesn't do a thing for me, I now know your identity
A black widow who tempts her prey with promises of love
If ignorance is bliss, wish I were blissfully ignorant
But I'm not. I'm enlightened now, light has been presented to me
In spite of you

[Refrain]
Come now, Ms. Leading, I regret to inform you
I've fallen out of lust
It must be so hard to understand
(Oh no, I don't think so, oh no, I don't think so)

Did you really think me a fool enough to play along?
Make-believing everything you said was true
Push your pouting lips on other unsuspecting lovers
(Oh no, I don't think so, oh no, I don't think so)

[Verse 2]
Dear Ms. Leading, in response to your response, I'm simply unavailable
I hope you got the message in the message that I sent
(Shame on me for falling for someone so dense)
In different times, I might've fooled around for something warm
Something with security
As fleeting as the momentary rapture and the pleasure of
Collapsing in arms so welcoming to others just like me

[Bridge]
(Go take another life...) (x3)

[Guitar Solo]

[Refrain]
Come now, Ms. Leading, I regret to inform you
I've fallen out of lust
It must be so hard to understand
(Oh no, I don't think so, oh no, I don't think so)

Did you really think me a fool enough to play along?
And make-believing everything you said was true
Push your pouting lips on other unsuspecting lovers
(Oh no, I don't think so, oh no, I don't think so)
