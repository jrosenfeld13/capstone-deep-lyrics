A soul is passing by
Pale voice calls out:
"Don't fear the fouler things
Beyond your dreams"

No, don't look back
Just follow the path to the light

"Save me, and bring me back to life
I can't hold on anymore
Save me, please save this wretched soul
Before the ravens are calling my name"

Enchanting words seducing
Fail to hold back
Enslaved by wicked evil
Now a darkened soul

No, can't look back
The clear path is fading to black
