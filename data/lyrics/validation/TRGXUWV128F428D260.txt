Don't do that (don't do that)
Don't do that
Don't do that (please don't do that)
Don't do that

I can love you - love you little Chinagirl
You're living in a secret world
And I don't know if it's easy
Babe, when you're falling in love
I can leave you - but I promise to return
Oh, I know your heart will burn
Oh, I don't know if it's easy
Babe, when you're falling in love

Don't do that (don't do that)
You break my heart (breaking my heart)
I fall in love (falling in love)
You break apart (breaking apart)
But if you go I lose my love
If you go I'll never love
Don't do that (don't do that)
Don't do that to me

I can leave you - if you look at me this way
Meet me in my dreams and say
Oh I know it's not sweeter - sweeter when you're falling in love
I can leave you - no more nights with no end
Babe, I know you understand
Oh, I know love is sweeter - sweeter when you're falling in love
