It's time for getting down
Into the room like an illusion, in the corner of my eye
The light reflected off of your glass, onto the base of your neck
Staring you down from the inside out and back again
Nothing stands between us
Staring you down from the inside out and back again
It's time for getting down
I always love a challenge, but I guess that this is too much
I've got to make my move now, before you walk away
My heart has failed my head again
I can spend my life dreaming of how it would be breaking your heart for me
To stop misleading right now would be a great time to start
