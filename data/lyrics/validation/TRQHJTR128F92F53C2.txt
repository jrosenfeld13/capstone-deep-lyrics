Well, I'm down on my knees
I ain't got no dime
Down on my knees
I ain't got a dime
Well, I'm groanin' down the hardway
Pretty soon I'll be made
Please, Missus Henry
Take me to your dad?
I can drink like a fish
I could crawl like a snake
Bite like a turkey
And swim like a drake
So, please, Missus Henry
Missus Henry, please!
Please, Missus Henry
Missus Henry, please!
Down on my knees
I ain't got a dime
Down on my knees
I ain't got a dime
Now, don't crowd me, baby
Or I'll fill up your shoe
I'm a sweet lovin' daddy
But, tonight I am blue
I'm a thousand years old
And I'm a generous bomb
I'm T-boned and punctured
But I'm known to be calm
So, please, Missus Henry
Missus Henry, please!
Please, Missus Henry
Missus Henry, please!
Down on my knees
I ain't got a dime
Down on my knees
I ain't got a dime
Down on my knees
I ain't got a dime
Down on my knees
I ain't got a dime
Down on my knees
I ain't got a dime
Down on my knees
I ain't got a dime
Please, Missus Henry
Missus Henry, please!
Please, Missus Henry
Missus Henry, please!
Down on my knees
I ain't got a dime
Down on my knees
I ain't got a dime
Down on my knees
I ain't got a dime
Down on my knees
I ain't got a dime
Down on my knees
I ain't got a dime
Down on my knees
I ain't got a dime
Down on my knees
I ain't got a dime
Down on my knees
I ain't got a dime
Down on my knees
I ain't got a dime
Down on my knees
I ain't got a dime
Down on my knees
I ain't got a dime
Down on my knees
I ain't got a dime
