Victoria have they locked you in the cold room
My darkest fears have come true
And never more am i to hold you

Heavy weather in my ashtray
Heaven knows how
Things turned out this way

It was only a game that we were playing
Tell me darling will you forgive me someday
We are only flesh and blood we are not angels
If you could see me now
What would you say

Victoria tell me where are we to lay you
At last my mind is made up
And nevermore will i betray you

We will have to tell the children something
When they get back from school

Heavy lines now on your copy tray
Heaven knows things turned out this way

It was only a game that we were playing
Tell me daring will you forgive me someday
We are only flesh and blood we are not angels
If you could see me now
Would it be fair to say that
It was only a game that we were playing

Well victoria i have seen the x-rays
We are only flesh and blood we are not angels
If you could see me now tearing off your dressing gown
You are all that i would care about
What would you say
