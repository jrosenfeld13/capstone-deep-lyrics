Just like the dew that clings to dawn
I'll cling to you, my love
I can't erase the memories
Of things we used to do
Oh how I love you, girl
Oh how I love you
Now I sit alone
With memories by the score

You remind me of the golden sun
That shines after the storm
Oh how we used to plan a life
In dreamland for us both
Now you have shattered our plan
And got yourself another man
Now I sit alone
With memories by the score

I pray the stars may safely keep
And watch you as you sleep
And day by day the sun will shine
As you trod along the way
Remember I'll always love you, girl
No matter where you are
Though I'm left alone
With memories by the score
Though I'm left alone
With memories by the score
