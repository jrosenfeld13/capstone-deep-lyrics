I've had sins and I've had pain
My heart has been broken
And my life has been strained
But in spite of everything I've been through
I still gotta say thank You
I've been up and I've been down
Had my life turn, turn, turn
Completely around
But in spite of everything I've been through
I still I gotta say thank You
Thank You, thank You
For Your many blessings
(For Your blessings)
In spite of my mess
(In spite of my mess)
Lord, You looked down and You blessed me
(For Your blessings)
Even in the midst of my test
(In the midst of my test)
(In spite of everything)
In spite of everything
(I've been through)
I still gotta say thank You
Thank You, Jesus
For Your blessings
(For Your blessings)
In spite of my mess
(In spite of my mess)
Lord, You blessed me
(For Your blessings)
Right dead in the middle of my test
(In the midst of my test)
(In spite of everything)
In spite of everything, in spite of everything
That I've been through
I've still gotta thank You, Jesus
I wanna say, I just wanna say, thank You, Jesus
(Thank You, Lord)
Oh yeah, thank You
Yeah, just wanna say thank You, Jesus
(Thank You, I gotta say)
I gotta say thank You for every iddy biddy
Thing You've done in my life
For all the ways make me
For all the doors You open, Lord
I wanna say hey
(Thank You)
(I gotta say)
Glory, Hallelujah, for all You've done in my life
You've been Lord, You've been my protection
(My protection)
All of the way
(All of my way)
I thank You, Lord
(I thank You, Lord)
I thank You, Lord
(I thank You, Lord)
I thank You, Lord
(I thank You, Lord)
Yes, yes, yes, yeah
(In spite of everything I've been through)
I still gotta look to heaven and say thank You
Lord, I thank You for every iddy biddy
Thing You've done in my life
I say thank You, just wanna thank You
I must, I must, I shall say thank You
Oh, thank You, hey, I thank You
Just wanna say thank You
