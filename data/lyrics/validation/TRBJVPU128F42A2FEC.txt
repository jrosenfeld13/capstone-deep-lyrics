Ooh not one tear, no babe
Babe

The birds don't sing the same anymore
They always sounded happy before
But now there's something missing
Cause they don't see me kissing you
No more

The sky has fallen down through the floor
I go to sleep with noone to hold
In bed when you were near me
I didn't really feel the cold
At all

I'm picking up the pieces now
Know I'm gonna get through somehow
Don't cry for me
Gotta make it on my own
Learn to be alone
(Ooh baby)
Don't cry for me

I feel like there's a hole in my heart
Gotta fill it up and make a new start
I can't sit here forever
Although it seems I'll never ever get that far
I'm gonna get outside and make some new friends
And put me back together again
It's no use feeling lonely
When I know I'm not the only one who feels like this
So I'm

Picking up the pieces now
Know I'm gonna get through somehow
Don't cry for me (No babe)
Gotta make it on my own
Learn to be alone
(Ooh baby)
Don't cry for me

Ooh it's hard, baby it's hard, but I'm trying
Trying my best ooh to make it through
I know deep in my heart that I'm crying
I'm trying to forgive you

The birds don't sing the same anymore
They always sounded happy before
But now there's something missing
Cause they don't see me kissing you
No more baby

3x
Picking up the pieces now
Know I'm gonna get through somehow
Don't cry for me (No babe)
Gotta make it on my own
Learn to be alone
(Ooh baby)
Don't cry
Don't cry for me
I'll be okay, baby, I'll be okay
Don't you dare
