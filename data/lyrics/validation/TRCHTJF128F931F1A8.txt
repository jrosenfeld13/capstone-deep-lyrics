Hold me like a wild flower
Fall around me like a sun shower
Kiss me like your on fire
And tell me what's underneath
Show me
I want you to show me
What love is

Run with me like a hell bent gypsy
Scream for me from the highest balcony
Carve my name on an old red door in Spain
Make me immortal make me immortal in your heart
And show me
I want you to show me
What love is
What love is

Baby get my attention
Touch me deep inside
Show me what I've been missin'
Missin' all my life
Give me my finest hour
Give me my ray of light
Give me somethin' that can't be denied
Like a thousand red balloons in a saphire sky
A Roman candle burnin', burnin' through the night
Like the pyramids in Egypt
The diamonds in your eyes
Show me
Show me what love is

Like the Eiffel tower shining with a million lights
Snow flakes falling like confetti on a New York city night
And to hold on to forever
A new born baby's cry
Show me
I want you to show me
What love is
Show me
Show me what love is
Like your on fire
