[Verse 1]
Reckoner
Can't take it with you
Dancing for your pleasure

[Verse 2]
You are not to blame for
Bittersweet distractors
Dare not speak its name
Dedicated to all human, all human beings

[Verse 3]
Because we separate
Like ripples on a blank shore
Because we separate (In rainbows)
Like ripples on a blank shore (In rainbows)

[Verse 4]
Reckoner
Take me with you
Dedicated to all human, all human beings
