Sun sinking like a stone
Eyes watery unknown
Dry desert on the strip
You stepped on truly a sobering
Back when I was bate and mashed
I focused on the moments and cried

Follow the pioneers and tell them
Follow the pioneers, portray them
Follow the pioneers

Sun skip it like a stone
Teeth chewing on your bones
Jaws stronger than the rock you rest on
What do you want from me
Back when I was bate and mashed
I panicked when you suddenly cried

Follow the pioneers and tell them
Follow the pioneers, portray them
Follow the pioneers
