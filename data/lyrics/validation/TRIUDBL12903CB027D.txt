When the tide comes in
And splits the land between
My love counts on me
But skip the land and row
Where it's bound to blow
Colder winds I know
Out to sea, out to sea
Skip off forevermore
Always pining for
My love left on the shores
And if I head for ground
Fearing I may drown
Will I let my love down?
Out to sea, out to sea
