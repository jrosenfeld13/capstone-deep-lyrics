It's in Estonia
It's up the creaky stairway
We sat in the wicker chair
You know the one we used to share
And it's just the kind of thing that we don't talk about anymore

Remember when your sister was young
She wore a ring in her tongue
Got shown the door by your mum
And now she has a 5 year old son
And it's just the kind of thing that she won't talk about anymore

I'll bet you wouldn't believe me
If I whispered in your ears and said
I can see a pink elephant
And it's standing on the corner of the bed
You'll just smile and roll your eyes to the back of your head

You were a girl, you weren't sure
You cared for your family anymore
Looked for the mother you had before
And it shook them all to the core
And it's just the kind of thing that you don't talk about anymore

I recall your friend back home
She brought up a kid on her own
But he died before he had grown
So she gave you all the clothes that she'd sewn
And it's just the kind of thing that she don't talk about anymore

I'll bet you wouldn't believe me
If I whispered in your ear and said
"I can see a pink elephant
And it's standing on the corner of the bed"
I'll bet you wouldn't believe me
If I whispered in your ear and said
I can see a pink elephant
And it's standing on the corner of the bed
You'll just smile and roll your eyes to the back of your head

You'll just smile and roll your eyes to the back of your head
Yeah, you'll just smile and roll your eyes to the back of your head
Yeah, you'll just smile and roll your eyes to the back of your head
