I lie here awake
My lifeless body that's cold feeling the pain
That's a cry far away
Why is this prolonged, I've already lived, what's to fear

Now kill the power, become partners of sin
Alone in our decision to unlock the door
And escape from within
For only death is my life
Escape from within

From terminal living, cutting me, low in my prime
Contract of death, silent screams beg to be signed
You'll live the life of a saint as you decide
Mercy kill to turn the tide

Now kill the power, become partners of sin
Alone in our decision to unlock the door
And escape from within
For only death is my life
Escape from within
Escape from within

From terminal living, through the years I've laid alone
Tubes through my body, there's no will to carry on
You'll live the life of a saint as you decide
Mercy kill to turn the tide

Now kill the power, become partners of sin
Alone in our decision to unlock the door
And escape from within
For only death is my life
Escape from within
Escape from within
Escape from within
