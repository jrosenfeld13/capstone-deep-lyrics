[Verse 1]
Girl on a mission, pole position
To get to the club and start tripping
Tell the DJ he's too arty
We don't wanna paint, we just wanna party
Girls go ohhh and the boys go ohhh
You came on and played the song
And now I think I'm in love with the DJ

[Pre-Chorus]
I like how you build me up
And then you burn it down
You know you rock my world
And spin it round

[Chorus]
You got me from the get go, get go
Everyone else is just so sure, so sure
You had me straight from hello
You got me from the get go
You got me from the get go
You got me from the get go
From the get go, from the get go

[Verse 2]
Watch the shorties blowing kisses
Homies [?]  in like missiles
They all try to get my (?)
But I just dance alone and wish
That you're looking, that you're looking
That you're looking to the left
That's what I said
So I shake it to the, shake it to the
Shake it to the West
And then you did
[?]
And no surprise that it's magic
You came on and played the song
And now I think I'm in love with the DJ

[Pre-Chorus]
I like how you build me up
And then you burn it down
You know you rock my world
And spin it round

[Chorus]
You got me from the get go, get go
Everyone else is just so sure, so sure
You had me straight from hello
You got me from the get go
You got me from the get go
You got me from the get go
From the get go, from the get go

[Bridge]
Can't get your music off my mind

[Chorus]
You got me from the get go, get go
Everyone else is just so sure, so sure
You had me straight from hello
You got me from the get go
You got me from the get go
You got me from the get go
From the get go, from the get go

[Outro]
From the get go, from the get go
