Tear down these walls
Cut the ties that held me
Crying out at the top of my voice
Tell me now if you can hear me

I'm awake today
I've got something to say
Can you hear me now?

You'd better make way
I've got something to say
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?

I'm awake today
I've got something to say
Can you hear me now?

No need to obey
I've got something to say
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?

Tear down these walls
Cut the ties that held me
Crying out at the top of my voice
Tell me now can you hear me?
