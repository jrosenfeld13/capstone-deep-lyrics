Many mates and mood swings
Many more - many more to come
Tax seasons coming, and the cars not running, and
Parties seem less fun

I was smarter long ago
This I know this I know for sure
All of my friends have no direction
Theyve stopped dreaming of more

Searching for a hobby
Wasting time - waiting for a sign
But when push comes to shove, and youve found no love
You can think of 89

We were younger then, and had good intentions, but
Threw them all away
We had petty needs, and our dignity, but weve
Thrown it all away
