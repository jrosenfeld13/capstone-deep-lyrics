You were the apple of my eye
[Incomprehensible]
Did you take me on for fun
Or did you take me for a ride?
Maybe we were a little young
Too young to know there was something wrong
But before I move along
I need to know where you're running from?
Ah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You're running from
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
But it's too late, but it's too late
It's too late, talk about now
It is too late, it's too late
It's too late to talk now
I was a thorn stuck on your side
I could never change your mind
But no matter how hard you try
You couldn't hide from the king inside
Baby, we were a little young
I sit inside when you're having fun
But before I move along
I need to know who you're running from?
Ah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You're running from
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
But it's too late, but it's too late
But it's too late to talk now
But it's too late, but it's too late
But it's too late to talk now
But it's too late, but it's too late
But it's too late to talk now
It's too late, it's too late
It's too late to talk now
It's too late, it's too late
It's too late to talk now
It's too late, it's too late
It's too late to talk now
