Lately I've been watching a little complex grow
You know, you gotta know
That's why I chose to tell 'ya
That humble stance and timid glance
Makes your world turn so slow
You know, you gotta know
There's no one going to help you
Watching you, that shyness too, with everyone you know
You know, you gotta know
That's how they step around you
It takes you twice the time to find the things you're looking for
You know, you're moving slow
No one will stop to tell you
You can light up anyone you please
You should spend less time down on your knees
Lately I've been watching a little complex grow
You know, you gotta know
That's why I chose to tell 'ya
That humble stance and timid glance
Makes your world turn so slow
You know, you gotta know
There's no one going to help you (x5)
