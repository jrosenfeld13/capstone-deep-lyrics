Broken windows and empty hallways
Pale dead moon in a sky streaked with grey
Human kindness overflowing
And I think it's gonna rain today

Scarecrows dressed in latest styles
With frozen smiles to keep love away
Human kindness overflowing
And I think it's gonna rain today

Lonely, lonely
Tin can at my feet
Think I'll kick it down the street
That's the way you treat a friend

Bright before me the signs implore me
Help the needy and show them the way
Human kindness overflowing
And I think it's gonna rain today

Lonely, oh so lonely
Tin can at my feet
Think I'll kick it down the street
That's the way you treat a friend

Bright before me the signs implore me
Help the needy and show them the way
Human kindness overflowing
And I think it's gonna rain today

Human kindness, it's overflowing
And I think it's gonna rain today
