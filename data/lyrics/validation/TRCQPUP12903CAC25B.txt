My little Margie, I'm always thinkin' of you, Margie
I'll tell the world I love you
Don't forget your old promises to me
I have bought, I gotta a house and ring and everything
For my own [unverified]

I say, say you are my inspiration
Days are never blue
After all is said and done
Baby, you're the only one
Oh, Margie, it's you
