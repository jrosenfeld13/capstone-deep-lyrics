My words, words are your law
Perfection with no regression
Obey, obey your ruler
Refusal is out of question
Supreme overpower
Used by the highest author
I make the rules you follow
Everything you have to swallow

You cant turn my head
Because Ive decided
I am god, I
You cant turn my head
Because Ive decided
I am god, I

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who is the fairest of all
I am, I am the king now
Hallowed be my name
Visage  its just perfect
Cant be -no- detected
Always effing and blinding
Built like a brick shithouse

You cant turn my head
Because Ive decided
I am god, I
You cant turn my head
Because Ive decided
I am god, I

I am Godeye, the world is mine
Ill keep on watching you so do it right
Under the control just stay blind
Follow the orders you cant deny

I am Godeye, the world is mine
Ill keep on watching you so do it right
Under the control just stay blind
Follow the orders you cant deny
