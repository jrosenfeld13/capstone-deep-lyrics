Each cry of praise begins with Thee
You've given the gift of life
And hid in our hearts eternity
Revealed in the mercies of Christ
Tho' darkness surrounds us in shadows of death
We look for Your heavenly rays
The fruit of our lips giving thanks with each breath
We offer to Thee our praise

For Your generous favors O God
For the gift of our freedom in Christ
As an offering of praise unto You
We will give our lives in sacrifice

Our fountain of praise begins with Thee
It flows from Your heart above
Mercy like rain comes cleansing and free
To shower Your children in love
The thirst of our souls left parched by sin
Is quenched by Your river of grace
As rains that ascend to the heavens again
We offer to Thee our praise

The fire of our praise begins with Thee
You bathe us in flames of light
Each fiber within us is yearning to be
Engulfed in the glory of Christ
May all that is empty within be consumed
And fire for Thee set ablaze
With a fragrance of sacrifice sweet as perfume
We offer to Thee our praise
Our praise
