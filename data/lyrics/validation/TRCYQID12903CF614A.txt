Mr. Sandman bring me a dream,
Make him the cutest that Ive ever seen
Give him two lips like roses and clover
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over

Sandman, Im so alone
Dont have nobody to call my own
Please turn on your magic beam
Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream

Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream
Make him the cutest that Ive ever seen
Give him the word that Im not a rover
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over

Sandman, Im so alone
Dont have nobody to call my own
Please turn on your magic beam
Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream

Bung, bung, bung, bung

Mr. Sandman (Yes?) bring us a dream
Give him a pair of eyes with a come-hither gleam
Give him a lonely heart like Pagliacci
And lots of wavy hair like Liberace

Mr Sandman, someone to hold
(Someone to hold)
Would be so peachy before were too old
So please turn on your magic beam
Mr Sandman, bring us, please, please, please
Mr Sandman, bring us a dream
