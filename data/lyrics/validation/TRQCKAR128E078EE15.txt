[Verse 1]
Mom and Dad went to a show
Dropped me off at grandpa Joe's
I kicked and screamed
Said, "Please, don't go!"

[Chorus]
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!

[Verse 2]
Had to eat my dinner there
Mashed potatoes and stuff like that
I couldn't chew my meat too good

[Chorus]
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!

[Verse 3]
Said, "Why don't you stop your crying
Go outside and ride your bike"
That's what I did
I killed my toe!

[Chorus]
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!

[Verse 4]
After dinner I had ice cream
I fell asleep and watched TV
I woke up in my mothers arms!

[Chorus]
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Grandma take me home!
Wanna be alone!
