I'm goin' where those people sing
Sellin' me those crazy things
About the future and afterlife

About my twenty kids and thirty wifes

They say I was a king, a warrior chief
I looked at them in disbelief
They crack my head and slam my jaw
That's when I saw it all

Oh, pango pango pango
(Pango pango pango)
Pango pango pango
Pango pango pango
(Pango pango pango)
I'm wastin' here in pango

You know they did a crazy dance
But I stood my ground a took a stance
They screamed at the sky, they heated the sun
I feel the presure, I have to run

Nowhere to hide, nowhere to go
I got's to got's to feel the flow
Nowhere to hide, nowhere to go
I'm stuck here in Pango

Pango pango pango
(Pango pango pango)
Pango pango pango
Pango pango pango
(Pango pango pango)
I'm runnin' fast by movin' slow

The salad steaks and monkey brains
Curse you all who feel the pain
Oh melt me in a pot of Jones
Oh, Pangooooo

Pango pango pango
(Pango pango pango)
Pango pango pango
(Pango pango pango)
Pango pango pango
(Pango pango pango)
Once I was high but now I'm low

Pango pango pango
(Pango pango pango)
I'm wastin' here in Pango
(Pango pango pango)
Pango pango pango
I lost my soul in Pango
(Pango pango pango)
