Early in the morning wake-a up-a take a sucker out
Swift no doubt if his breath smells like ka-ka
Sing for my supper, whose that knocking at my door
Oh it's Mr. Wolf, I'm sorry not today thanks

My tummy growls louder than any predator
I'm very raw
Take any He-Man out like Skeletor
Glow in the dark skull underneath my hoodie
Undercover goodie dangerous with the voodoo boogie

No sperm-losing master of reality
Clairvoyant metamorphing bloody pussy eater
Bodies stick together coiled spinning een tot sewe
"Waddy tudor jones is baie lief vir sy lewe"
Stop looking at me funny, look at yourself
You look stupid, cos you look everyone else
I'm so-so fresh, like the longlife soya milk up on my shelf
Indestructible pop terrorist

Super evil, I am your enemy
Super evil, I am your enemy

Beautiful, pop composition unremovable
Attached to your face laying eggs in your mouth
Show you stuff maybe you don't wanna see
Nod your head to the lobotomy
Brain boil, bumble and toil cookie crumble
Creep walk knuckle drag dirt rough rumble
Tremendous terror tremor voodoo boogie boogie shake

Slang sling, funky with the boom-band brain
DJ fuck, swift with the kif
Uh-Uh-Uh-Uh-uckin' dogs
Im like fun fun fun, stroke, give up and run
Nobody knows where we're coming from
Minds open like automatic doors
Fuck speaking to you, I'll make the jump and speak thru you
Totally rad spitting nails, cause I'm made from slugs and snails and puppydog tails

Super evil, I am your enemy
Super evil, I am your enemy

I come thru like, a-a-a-a-a- a creepycrawlie
Hold your breath; deep-end Im still scoping out your legs
Rappers wanna battle like a poo in a bath
I'll fuckin' give you lift home after the show

Defiancy will be the death of Waddy

Mediocrity will be the death of me

Now I'm back on the track like a cat
Night stalking, skywalking roof to roof jumper
Boot bumper make you wanna pump up the bass
Whack mc's get punched in the face
Pardon me son but Im as hard as they come
Made in japan plus I rock a ray gun
Make everyone move they're bum to the drum
Don't test, cos I'm known to get dumb

Super evil, I am your enemy
Super evil, I am your enemy
