Love, come on and take me there
Come on and take me where You are

I can only see so far from this distant shore
So I close my eyes and dream
Cause it's there beyond the eastern sky
That You've prepared for me
And with every breath I yearn to be
Where faith will turn to sight

Chorus:
Love, come on and take me there
Come on and take me where You are
Love, come on and take me there
Come on and take me where you are

So I open my eyes to another day
Faces a world I don't fit in
So all that I can do is wait for You
For You to come again
Like a thief in the night You'll crack the sky
To take me away from there

So I'll look for You everywhere I go
Will You speak to me will You let me know
That the dawn will break and it won't be long
Til You come for me I can still be strong
I can hold on tight til the light break through
I will wait; I will wait for You

Chorus
