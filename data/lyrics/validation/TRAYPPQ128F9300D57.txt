I ain't proud
Lord, I ain't proud
I ain't proud
Well, I ain't proud
Lord, I ain't proud today

I ain't proud
Lord, I ain't proud
I ain't proud
Well, I ain't proud
Lord, I ain't proud

I'm in love with company
Please don't talk to me
I'm at home but it ain't my own
I'm rowing out to sea

I got a heart that beats
Shoes for my feet
I got food to eat
So then why do I feel so completely incomplete?

Now I've been laughed in the face by a briefcase
Lost every race
At 24 years of age, I've got to pick up the pace

I'm in love with company
Please don't talk to me
I'm at home but it ain't my own
I'm rowing out to sea

I ain't proud
Lord I ain't proud
I ain't proud
Well I ain't proud
Lord I ain't proud today
