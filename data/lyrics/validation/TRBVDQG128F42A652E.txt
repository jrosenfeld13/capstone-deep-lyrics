[Verse 1]
She was the girl with the string around her neck
-ing with the boy who could only give her less
It could be more if she learned to never expect
-ing and now it's she, it's her and him and then a baby
Next the wedding bells won't ring, but she could care less
How you exist

[Hook]
When you're living in a dreamworld (dreamworld)
You're living in a dreamworld (dreamworld)
You're living in a dreamworld (dreamworld)
You're living in a dreamworld (dreamworld)

[Verse 2]
He grew up drinking the milk from the cow from the farm
-ing was the trade his father's father's father's father
Made him go and give back to his country
He gave his both knees, he's overseas to fight the disease
It's spreading fast over maps and it don't look back

[Hook]
When you're living in a dreamworld (dreamworld)
You're living in a dreamworld (dreamworld)
You're living in a dreamworld (dreamworld)
You're living in a dreamworld (dreamworld)

[Verse 3]
It is a lie out of science fiction reads
Just like a child, A to Z or zero, one, two, three
Times the size of the people that came before
Me and you and what we'd do for money
This greed and jealousy turn to need
(Jealously turn to need, jealousy turn to need)
See, I'm a man with a plan to use my hands
They're touching yours, you're the girl who wanted more
Like every story'll fade from love to lie
The clover under your feet, a shooting star in the night
The people under your feet are shooting stars in the night
The people, all that you meet

[Hook]
They're living in a dreamworld (dreamworld)
Living in a dreamworld (dreamworld)
You're living in a dreamworld (dreamworld)
Living in a dreamworld (dreamworld)
