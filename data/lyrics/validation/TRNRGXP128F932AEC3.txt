Many years ago, he
Looked out through a glassless window
All that he could see was Babylon
Beautiful green fields and dreams
And learn to measure the stars
But there was a worry in his heart

He said
How could it come to this?
I'm really worried about living
How could it come to this?
Yeah, I really wanna know about this

Is it like today?
Uh, uh-uh

Then there came a day, moved
Out cross the Mediterranean
Came to rest on isles and the Greek young men
And with their silver beards they laughed
At the unknown of the universe
They could just sit and guess God's name

But they said, (hey)
How could it come to this?
We're really worried about living
How could it come to this?
Yeah, we really want to know about this

Is it like today?
Oh, oh-oh

Then there followed days of kings
Empires and revolution
Blood just looks the same
When you open the veins
And sometimes it was faith, power or reason as the cornerstone
But the furrowed brow has never left his face

He said
How could it come to this?
We're really living in a landslide
How could it come to this?
Yeah we really wanna know about this

Is it like today?
Oh, oh-oh

Then there came a day, man
Packed up, flew off from the planet
He went to the moon (to the moon)
To, (to the moon) the moon
Now he's out in space, hey, fixing all the problems
He comes face to face with God

He says
How could it come to this
I'm really worried 'bout my creation
How did it come to this
You're really killing me you know

It isn't just a day
Oh, oh-oh
Is it like today?
Eh? Ah
Is it like today?
Oh, Bang!
Oooh

Many years ago, he
Looked out through a glassless window
Didn't understand, much what he saw
