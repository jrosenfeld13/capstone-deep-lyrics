Oh the pride and the ego used to run my life
It's hard for me to say, but I was finally flat
All the power and the glory, yeah I had it all
Oh, the selfishness, that's where I was at

I forgot who I was
Lord you know I forgot you
But you never forgot me
No you never forgot me

Calling
Is in your hands, you've given everything to me
Lord you are the reason I stand here today
Lifting my voice, raising you up, cos I believe
Oh I believe I'm nothing, nothing without you

All my second chances, they were not deserved
Why you never gave up, it's a mystery
My strength is my faith and my faith is in you
Now I understand it's not about me

I'll not waste another day
Lord use me as you will
I surrender all
I surrender all

Calling
Is in your hands, you've given everything to me
Lord you are the reason I stand here today
Lifting my voice, raising you up, cos I believe
Oh I believe I'm nothing, nothing without you
Nothing without you
Nothing without you
