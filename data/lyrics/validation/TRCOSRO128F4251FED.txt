Amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen
Sing it over one time children
Listen to my story
It's a story about my Jesus
Amen
See the little baby
You know He's wrapped in a manger
Born Christmas morning
Amen
See Him at the seashore
Talking to the fishermen
And He's making them disciples
Amen, amen
Riding through Jerusalem
Waving palm branches
In pomp and splendor
See Him in the garden
Prayin to His Father
In deepest sorrow, sorrow
Led before Pilate
Then they crucified Him
But He rose on Easter
Amen, amen, amen
Hallelujah!
Yes, He died to save you and me
And He lives forever and ever
Amen
Glory hallelujah!
He died to save you and me
And He lives forever
Amen, amen, amen
