Across a sea of sand a treasure waits
Buried 'neath the past, a living gate
A voice ever calling me
Through golden dreams...destiny

"Damned is he who takes from the hand of my sleeping shadow"

In the city of the Dead
They come for everything
Follow the voice that sings
I crush they're unbelief
Black wings await the thief

I struggle on.. I've journeyed for so long.. for glory..
They say I will be damned, entombed beneath the sand..
A story

My City of the Dead
I'll Break your unbelief

I reach the gate... no time to contemplate tomorrows
A strange power holding sway
Dark eyes within the maze
"The Shadow"

"Awake, I rise in wrath and call your name in a place closed... now open
Damned is he who takes from the hand of my sleeping shadow
Though he may have all that lay within...Forever"

"You've come for everything

I judge your unbelief"

A story to be told a dream of shining gold..so hollow
The fallen find their way, brave kings become the slaves...of " The Shadow"

Pay the price
