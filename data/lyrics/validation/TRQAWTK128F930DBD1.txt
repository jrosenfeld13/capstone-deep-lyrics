This is the sound of letting go
This is the last breath I'll ever know
This is the last breath I'll never know
As I look up with my last breath, and I say:

I want to know what it's like
To walk in the footsteps you have made
I will run my course, finish my race
Until I'm called home

Death will bring the greatest day I've ever lived
On that glorious day held off so long
All the world will rejoice as the son comes home

I patiently await the day when all is revealed
When morning never comes
When we speak these words
Eye to eye, hand in hand, face to face
