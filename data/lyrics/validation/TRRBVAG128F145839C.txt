[Verse 1]
She rises early from bed
Runs to the mirror
The bruises inflicted in moments of fury
He kneels beside her once more
Whispers a promise
"Next time I'll break every bone in your body"
And the well-wishers let the devil in
And if the river ran dry they'd deny it happening

[Bridge]
As the card players deal their hands
From the bottom of the deck
Row upon row of feudal houses blown away
Medicine for the popular complaint

[Verse 2]
When the poets dreamed of Angels
What did they see?
History lined up in a flash at their backs
When the poets dreamed of Angels
What did they see?
The bishops and knights well placed to attack

[Instrumental]
