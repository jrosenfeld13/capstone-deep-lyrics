What have I said?
Give me a clue
What have I done to you?

Whenever I'm there
You give me a stare
Breaking my heart in two

I wanna be your friend
Oh yeah
I wanna be your friend

I wanna be your friend
Oh yeah
I wanna be your friend

Wouldn't it be good?
Wouldn't it be great?
Wouldn't it be oh so fine?

If I was there
If I were yours
Maybe if you were mine?

I wanna be your friend
Oh yeah
I wanna be your friend

I wanna be your friend
Oh yeah
I wanna be your friend

Ahh
Ahhh-Ahh
Ahhh-Ahh
Ahhhhhhhhhhh-
Ahh
Ahhh-Ahh
Ahhh-Ahh
Ahhhhhhhhhhh-
