Feels like I've been sleeping
For a thousand years
Secrets I've been keeping
Fill an ocean with tears

But I've found the answer
To what I'm searching for
'Cos I felt so empty
Until you touched my soul

I can't let you go
Now that you're mine
I can't let you go
I want you for all time

Filled with such confusion
I was losing my mind
Fell for love's illusion
Time after time

Any my life without you
Sends a chill right through my heart
But you made love easy
From the start

I can't let you go
Now that you're mine
I can't let you go
I want you for all time

I can't let you go
Now that you're mine
I can't let you go
I want you for all time

But I've found the answer
To what I'm searching for
'Cos I felt so empty
Until you touched my soul

I can't let you go
Now that you're mine
I can't let you go
I want you for all time

I can't let you go
Now that you're mine
I can't let you go
I want you for all time
