I remember you used to pray for me
Now you turn your head away
Expectations that i never met
Forgotten promises you never kept
I know someday
There can be a time when you can look me in the eye
Now i write these words
Just to keep it clear
In a jaded song you won't ever hear
I never
Wanted you forgiveness
You did what you had to
I did what i could
Now weve gone our separate ways
I never
Found comfort in your acceptance
If time is a healer
Then ill sit here and wait for
Your poison words to scar
One notebook filled with a million words
Sits quietly by my side
Like a loaded gun
With the wrong intentions
They tell me life is pain
I forgot a long time ago
How every day im reminded of the way
Put me down
The way you put me out
The way you torched my fucking world
I never
Wanted your forgiveness
You did what you had to
And i did what i could
Now weve gone our separate ways
I never
Found comfort in your acceptance
If time is a healer
Then ill sit here and wait for your poison words to scar
So you think you got me all figured out
You think you know what this hate is all about
Dont try to understand
Dont try to comprehend
The answer is in my words
When the world comes crashing down all around
And you need a quiet place to hide
Youll find me deep inside my head under a tree of thought
In a world of pain
I never wanted your help
I never needed you here
So when you think of me
Try to understand
Guide me through your maze of life
Guide me through your narrow world
I forgot a long time ago
How every day im reminded of the way
Put me down
The way you put me out
The way you torched my whole world
