After years of saying please
I'm getting up off of my knees
I'm so tired not being taken seriously
And I can't count all the times
Big opportunities came by
I thought if I hold out
Something better will arrive
It's a long way there
But you'll get there soon
A long way, but you'll get there
It's a long way there
But you'll get there soon
A long way, but you'll get there
It's not the prophet that I see
But more the genuine belief
If you build up from the ground
It will pay off eventually
But it's a long way before that happens
And I'm willing to stay
Long way before that happens
And I'm going to stay
I'm ready to stay
And I'm gonna stay
It's a long way there
But you'll get there soon
A long way, but you'll get there soon
