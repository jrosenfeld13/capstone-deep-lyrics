You're the analyst
The fungus in my milk
When you want no one
And you got someone

Through the wind you crawl
And laugh at burning dunes
When no one else will ever see

Now that you know
Why you feel like you do
They're turning their head
Whilst they wait for no one
And finally I know
Why you feel like letting go

I'm watching you watch over me
And I've got
The greatest view from here

I'm watching you watch over me
And I've got
The greatest view from here

Mistakes don't mean a thing
If you don't regret them
So pack your tactic
Toes for the winter

Chain a waterfall
To burned and withered skin
No one else will ever see

I'm watching you watch over me
And I've got
The greatest view from here

I'm watching you watch over me
And I've got
The greatest view from here

Now that you know
Why you feel like you do
They're turning their head
Whilst they wait for no one
And finally I know
Why I feel like you're letting go

I'm watching you watch over me
And I've got
The greatest view from here

I'm watching you watch over me
And I've got
The greatest view from here

The greatest view from here
The greatest view
