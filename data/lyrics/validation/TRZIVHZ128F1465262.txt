Did you believe them when they told you they discovered you?
And that everything is free as long as you do what they tell you to
You think it's true

But nothing could be farther from the truth, my love

Did you even listen when they told you to change your name?
And how nobody wants honesty when looking at a perfect frame
Play the game

But nothing could be further from the truth, my love
And nothing is more powerful than beauty in a wicked world
Play it girl
Play it girl
Play it girl

Does it make you feel good when they tell you what you want to hear?
And after they suck all your soul, well, that's when they'll disappear
Disappear forever, and ever
Like a prince in your little fairy tale
And you will find, the day when they put your soul on sale

That nothing could be further from the truth, my love
And nothing is more powerful than beauty in a wicked world
