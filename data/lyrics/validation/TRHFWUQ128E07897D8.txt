We was a-d-d-d-drivin' d-downtown L.A.,
About a-midnight hour
And it almost b-b-blew my mind
I got caught in a coloured shower
All those lights were t-t-twinkling on Sunset
I saw a sign in the sky
It said, "T-t-t-trip a t-trip, I trip, trip,"
I couldn't keep up up if I tried
Ah, we stepped down to reality company
To get some instant sleep
And the driver turned, I said, "Welcome back"
He smiled and he said, "Beep beep"
What goes on ? Chick-a-chick
What goes on ? I really wanna know
What goes on all around me
What goes on ? I really wanna know
When in should come-a my dream woman
She got sequins in her hair
Like she stepped out off of a Fellini film
She sat in a white straw chair
But I thought I'd take a second look
Just to see what I could see
And my scene had popped out like a bubble does
There was nobody there but me
I said, "Girl, you drank a lot of drink-me
But you ain't in a Wonderland
You know I might-a be there to greet you, child
When your trippin' ship touches sand."
What goes on ? Chick-a-chick
What goes on ? I really wanna know
What goes on ? Chick-a-chick
What goes on ? I really wanna know
A silver goblet of wine is-a to be
Held in a bejewelled glove
And her knights they toast the tournament
The falcons they fly above
And the queen will a drink of the dew tonight
But the jester she cries alone
Because Merlin he spoke of an instant spell
To make the devil's white knights moan
And-a all in all, the seagull said
"As I look to where I've been
The whole wide human race
Has a-taken far too much Methedrine"
What goes on ? Chick-a-chick
What goes on ? I really wanna know
What goes on ? So near
What goes on ? I really wanna know
Yeah well, come on
We sat in a velvet jewel case
With sparkles everywhere
And Julian he sat on a diamond ring
And-a talked of the days gone by
We spoke of a common kaleidoscope
And the pros and the cons of Zen
And he spoke and-a said for a piece of cake
He really did have a yen
Bobby Dylan he sat "the Mad Hatter"
A broken hour glass in his hand
And-a Joannie sat in a white lace
Looking cool with a black lace fan
What goes on ? Chick-a-chick
What goes on ? I really wanna know
What goes on ? Yes please tell me
What goes on ? I really wanna know
