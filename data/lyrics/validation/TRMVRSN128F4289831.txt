There's a legend about a church in our town the steeple so high seen for miles around
Look on the hill and you'll realize the steeple's too big for the churches size
It seemes it was a long time ago when this church had no steeple
Just four walls and the roof overhead sheltered the humble people
But the money was short cause the times were bad
They had to get along on what they had
Just good simple people praying for a steeple
About this time when spring was near a man of weath and his sweetheart dear
Made their plans for the bells to ring they would wed on the first of spring
So this man of wealth and his true love dear named the wedding hours
They would wed in the little church the one that had no towers
But he was the kind and generous man he told his true love of his plan
How to build a steeple for these good people
Yes they'll have their steeple the bells there will ring
They'll ring for our wedding on the first day of spring
But they say death comes like a thief and soon his heart was filled with grief
One week before the wedding day he learned his love has passed away
Inspite of his grief and broken heart he kept the promise given
I'll build the steeple so my love can hear the bells in heaven
And then he built the steeple there the tallest one in all the land
That's how the people got their steeple
Well that is the reason the steeple lives so high
And how the bells ring louder when springtime is nigh
