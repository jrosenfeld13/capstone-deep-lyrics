[Verse 1]
Shadows form knights and pawns
Upon the squares
Blood is drawn up from the well
Secret signs brought the crime
Right to your door
An innocent guilty as hell

[Chorus]
Oh, the cot is open wide
Damp with milk and honey
Gone the mother and the child
In Jesus name

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Oh, the cot is open wide
Damp with milk and honey
Gone the mother and the child
In Jesus name

[Verse 2]
Should they be waiting there
On my return
I may run into their arms
Walking on a razor's edge
Unconcerned
Game is lost again, I'll never learn
