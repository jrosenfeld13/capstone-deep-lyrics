Now this dark cloud is rising, and it's thundering all around
Look like something bad is going to happen, you better lower your airplane down

Now that mean old twister's coming, poor people running every which away
Everybody's got to wonder, what's the matter with this cruel world today

Now my mama told me, when I was only five months old
If you obey your preacher, the good Lord is going to bless your soul

Now the daylight is failing, and the moon begin to rise
I'm just down here weeping and moaning, right by my mama's side

Now I'm going home, I done did all in this world that I could
Says I got everybody happy, around here in my neighborhood
