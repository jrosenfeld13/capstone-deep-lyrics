Nothing's wrong with having nothing
When there's nothing to be gained
Put your mind on anything you please
Having pennies in your pocket
Equalises many things
Surely wish it did grow on the trees

I'd live from the gold leaf tree
Yes I would

Have you seen the tree in blossom
Shimmering in the setting sun
Would you point the way that I must go
I've been searching since I realised it could be done
Still today there's nothing I can show

I'm gonna find the gold leaf tree
Wherever that may be

It's a thought away from here
It's infinity I hear
I'll find that gold leaf tree
Wherever that may be

Do you think that I'll be happy
When I find the leaves of gold
Will I feel there's nothing, more to do
Will the rainbows end I followed
Fade just like a Marigold
I must find out for myself and you

I've gotta find the gold leaf tree
I'll live where the light goes free

It's a thought away from here
In infinity I hear
I'll find that gold leaf tree
Wherever that may be
I'll find that gold leaf tree
Wherever that may be

I'll find that, oh I'll find the gold leaf tree
