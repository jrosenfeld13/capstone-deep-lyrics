In this ever changing world
In these times
These days of challenge
As my systems begin to fail
I hear voices
Beyond the veil ...

Love decays
Under our dying star
Strange how time delays
The knowing who we are ...

As the years slip through my hand
My life
Runs out
Like Sand ...

I will play a poison lullaby
In fields of gravity
Under a falling sky ...

As the day
Slow-fades away
Warning shadows
Crawl across my walls of grey ...

Sweetness drips
From the exquisite corpse
Sleeping sickness
Grips at every ghost who walks

As the years slip through my hand
My Life
Runs Out
Like Sand
