Hostile, rapacious, predatory menace
Shrouded in a veil of obscurity
Tooth-studded jaws
Omnivorous appetite
Abrasive placed weaponry
Decontorcicating
Evokes excrutiating painful
Injury from an epidermal wound
Titanic primeval butcher

Pressure sensores submerged in anatomy
Fluid filled tubes, extended impulse nerves
The scent of blood
Incites enravishment
Ominous reconnaissance
Irresolution
Preceding systematic slaughter
Quintessent, carnivorous, piscine

Desperate diversion
Elusive maneuvers
Erupt in a frenzy
Impelling determined attack

Split by the wrath of a blubber lance
Pain is not conceived
Evil smelling mass unleashed
Indulging in an autophagous feast

Defy the force of a power-driven spear
Lude monstrosity

Terminal mouth with tricuspid teeth
Revealing all the inner sights of hell
Contorting velocities
Of crushing violent rage
Shattering pain evolves
Blood-soaked chunks from wounded prey
Mangled flesh abounds
Succumb to nefarious mandibles
Dragged underneath
Immersed in fear of death

Denuted bone, massive tissue loss
Exposing entrails, savage autopsy
Ruptured torso spewing forth
Dragged underneath
Now immersed in fear of death

Internal organs severely ruptured from
Infinite barrage of sledgehammer blows
A slashing maw
Immense bite radius
Piscatory savagery
Mob feeding pattern
Fierce competition for the sparse
Remains of a carcass torn to shreds
Perditious abomination

Primitive killer
Ravenous glutton
Most non-selective feeder to endure

Savage attacker
Voracious torpedo
Gormandizing with ferocity
