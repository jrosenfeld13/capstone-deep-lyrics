Brownstone, back again?  What?
Dark Child for life, FJ, oh
Check it out

1 - 	Let's get it started
	All I wanna do is have a party
	Let's not waste no time lets get it started
	I won't stop till we fall in love

Hey, yo, Kina, take it away

Sittin , hoping, wishing , dreaming
Of those things that we'd be doing
Only if you give me a chance
Every time I sync, we're moving
You slow down and stop my grooving
Baby won't you let go and dance, oh, oh baby

Repeat 1

Hey, yo, Nicci, come on

Baby can't you see it's only you
And only you that's just for me
Is it fiction or truth, hey
Love is high and love goes slow
Is this the way my story goes
Don't just stay and just let it flow

Every little thing that you do to me baby
It's staying in my head and ya driving me crazy
All I wanna do is be your number one baby
We can get it started

Every little thing that you do to me baby
It 's staying in my head and ya driving me crazy
All I wanna  do is be your number one baby
We can get it started

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

Hey yo Maxee, take it to the bridge

We can fall in love if you want to
Baby I want you
Whatchu wanna do
We can fall in love if you want to
Baby I want you
Whatchu wanna do

[Mike Nitti]
Now what I wanna do
Is break it up from the back
Once again hear the lacing of a Dark Child track
Mike Nitti make it rope and that's a well known fact
Told you on the other joint I get down like that
So smoke the sunny gold I got the key to the room
Lemme get you on a zoom then I'm out like shoe
And it's back to ac go scoop up moves
Ya know you're sick like the flu if you don't know what I do
Mr. Cuttie Pie, did you flash back to superfly
All their stars wanna do me, why who am I?
You better ask somebody and you'll recognize quick
Smell something that's me cuz I'm on shhhhhhhhhh

Repeat 1 until fade
