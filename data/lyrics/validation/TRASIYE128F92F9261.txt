Can't stop thinkin'
Must've been trippin' this evening
My mind is racing demons
And all of my feelings are numb

Yeah and when I roll with my head in the wind
And I feel like the king of the...

Dead men wishin' they had gotten together with you, girl
But you're a dirty little liar
With a message of obsession to come

You got your head in the clouds
And your world's upside down

Get away from the life you're living
Get away from the man that's stealing your life
Get away from the drugs you're taking
Get away from the film of sex in your life

Can't stop drinking
I'm cold, kicking and bleeding
The wine is numbing feelings
And all of my memories are gone

Yeah and when I roll with my head in the wind
And I feel like the king of the...

Dead men wishin' they had gotten together with you, girl
But you're a dirty little liar
With a message of obsession to come

You got your head in the clouds
And your world's upside down

Get away from the life you're living
Get away from the man that's stealing your life
Get away from the drugs you're taking
Get away from the film of sex in your life

You got your head in the clouds
And your world's upside down

Get away from the life you're living
Get away from the man that's stealing your life
Get away from the drugs you're taking
Get away from the film of sex in your life

Get away
Get away
Get away

Get away
Get away
Get away
