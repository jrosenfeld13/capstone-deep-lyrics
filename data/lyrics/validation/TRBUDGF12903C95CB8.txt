Father, how can it be that you are
Father, to me
Savior, how can it be that you are
Savior, for me

You're everything I need

Wonder of the world you've been more wonderful to me
And as long as I can speak
I will say so
I'll say so

Wonder of the world you are displayed for all to see
And for all eternity
I will say so

Healer, how can it be that you are
Healer, in me
Favour, how can it be that you show
Favour, on me

And everything I need

Wonder of the world you've been more wonderful to me
And as long as I can speak
I will say so
I'll say so

Wonder of the world you are displayed for all to see
And for all eternity
I will say so

Oh
I can't be silenced
I can't be quiet
For all you've done

And Oh
I couldn't fight it
I cannot hide it
All you've done
All you've done

Wonder of the world you've been more wonderful to me
And for all eternity
I will say so

Wonder of the world you've been more wonderful to me
And as long as I can speak
I will say so
I'll say so

Wonder of the world you are displayed for all to see
And for all eternity
I will say so
Say so
