[Hook: Supastition]
No matter where you are
No matter where you're at
We're gonna resurrect the music and bring it back
No matter where you're at
No matter where you are
You gotta rock to it, Cam and Supa keep it raw

[Verse One: Supastition]
Repertoire forever, I'll be damned if I'mma change up
This therapeutic music, I use it to channel anger
At any given time, Supa's liable to spark shit
And we's wild, speed dial your fire department
Inform 'em, people wanted the flows hot now-a-days
I smell smoke in Carolina, there's a four alarm blaze
I had to prove that I'm nice and sick with it to the game
I refuse to kiss ass for some critical acclaim
Am I dope as they proclaim? You seen the way I stand my ground
When placed beside bigger niggas with a name
My sound ain't for the suburbanites
It's more for the homies on the grind within the urban life
9 to 5 worker type
I'm here to show my state and all tobacco and livestock
And you can see the difference in the rap flow that I got
There's no dispute about it, we the best in here
Breakin' new ground with the sound of yester year
Let's keep it rockin' y'all

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Supastition]
I'm a franchise player, y'all little dudes get benched
Even in Paris I'm the shit dawg, excuse my French
It's me and DJ Cam, forever we stay fam
Let's get this paper up front like it's a prepaid plan
Now it's official, Supastition keep it poppin' out in France
Other rappers? Not a chance
Brother, y'all can not advance
I spit with a heavy impact that'll break your bones
Got Carolina in my arms like ??
I'm that thorough
My colony is standin' right beside me son
Team players, never selfish like Iverson
Just give me some bass and the livest drums
I'll have you rushin' to the record store by the time I'm done
I bring back that old feel with no frills it's so real
It's the Suparemacy with DJ Cam on the wheels
There's no dispute about it, we the best in here
Breakin' new ground with the sounds of yester year
Let's keep rockin' y'all

[Hook]


[Bridge: Supastition]
No matter where you're at
No matter where you are
No matter where you're at
No matter where I am
It's Supa and DJ Cam

[Outro: Supastition talking]
Let rock y'all. From NC all the way to Paris. Worldwide
