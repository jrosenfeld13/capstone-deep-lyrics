I know right now things don't seem bad
You don't understand what makes me so sad
Well, neither do I Hard as I try It alludes me

Please believe me when I say it ain't you
Nothing you said, nothing you can do

It's deep-seeded fears
From uncertain years
That haunt me

I grew up under a Falling Sky
Trying not to make waves
Try not to cry
Long summer days wound up so tight
Like a hundred degrees
Sittin' on dynamite

Uncertain years took their toll
Left behind this scared sad soul

Afraid of bad news And all
I could lose In an instant

Everyday I forget a little more
Let a few more ghosts drift out that door

There were minor crimes
But given the time
All's forgiven

We were sailing on an unsteady ship
Playing perfectly still so nothing would tip

So afraid and I all could think
Was that I'd be the weight
That'd cause this boat to sink

I grew up under a Falling Sky
Trying not to make waves
Try not to cry
Long summer days wound up so tight
Like a hundred degrees
Sittin' on dynamite
