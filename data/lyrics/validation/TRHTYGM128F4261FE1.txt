She rides in the front seat...
She's my older sister
She knows her power over me
She goes to bed an hour later than I do
When she turns the lights out
What does she think about?
And what does she do in the daylight that makes her so great?

Oh, but to be...
Oh, but to be
Oh, but to be
I'd like to be...
My older sister...

She flies through the back door
She's my older sister
She throws French phrases 'round the room
She has ice skates and legs that fit right in
She's wicked to all the beaming dreamers who later
Boast of an evening by her fiery side

Oh but to be...
I'd like to be
Please let me be
Oh let me be...
My older sister...

And in her black gymnastic tights
She runs into some elastic nights
Sophisticated sister sings for the soldiers of the soccer team
Their silver ideas and sororities
They tinker with love and their Model T's
Oh Lord...
Won't you let me be her for just one day?

She turns everybody's heads
While I wear her last year's threads
With patches and stitches and a turned up hem

Oh but to be...
Oh but to be
I'd like to be
Just once to be...
My older sister...
