[Intro: Gabe Saporta]
I make them good girls go bad
I make them good girls go
Good girls go bad
Good girls go bad

[Verse 1: Gabe Saporta]
I know your type (your type)
Yeah, daddy's little girl
Just take a bite (one bite)
Let me shake up your world
'Cause just one night couldn't be so wrong
I'm going to make you lose control

[Pre-Chorus: Gabe Saporta]
She was so shy
'Til I drove her wild

[Chorus 1: Gabe Saporta]
I make them good girls go bad
I make them good girls go bad
You were hanging in the corner with your five best friends
You heard that I was trouble, but you couldn't resist
I make them good girls go bad
I make them good girls go
Good girls go bad
Good girls go bad
Good girls go

[Verse 2: Leighton Meester]
I know your type (your type)
Boy, you're dangerous
Yeah, you're that guy (that guy)
I'd be stupid to trust
But just one night couldn't be so wrong
You make me want to lose control

[Pre-Chorus: Gabe Saporta]
She was so shy
'Til I drove her wild

[Chorus 2: Gabe Saporta & Leighton Meester]
I make them good girls go bad
I make them good girls go bad
I was hanging in the corner with my five best friends
I knew that you were trouble, but I couldn't resist
I make them good girls go bad
I make them good girls go
Good girls go bad
Good girls go bad
Good girls go bad

[Bridge: Gabe Saporta & Leighton Meester]
Oh she got a way with them boys in the place
Treat 'em like they don't stand a chance
And he got a way with them girls in the back
Actin' like they too hot to dance
Oh she got a way with them boys in the place
Treat 'em like they don't stand a chance
And he got a way with them girls in the back
Actin' like they too hot to dance

[Breakdown: Gabe Saporta & Leighton Meester]
I make them good girls go bad
I make them good girls go
Them good girls go bad (yeah)

[Outro: Cobra Starship & Leighton Meester]
I was hanging in the corner with my five best friends
I knew that you were trouble, but I couldn't resist
I make them good girls go bad
I make them good girls go
Good girls go bad
Good girls go bad
Good girls go
