Teeth marks up and down your arms
Hurry, sound the alarm
She's not coming home tonight

Laughing at your nightmares
Angels pull out your hair
She's not in love with you tonight

Get the keys to the car
We're gonna drive to an evil star
We're gonna drive to an evil star

So, put your seatbelts on tight
We're gonna burn through every stoplight
She is turning blue
So, put your seatbelts on tight
The streets are turning white
She is turning blue (alright)

Teeth marks on your purple arm
Waiting at the parking lot
The chase is better than the high

Screaming at the clouds
The voices are so loud
Her mouth is falling from the sky

Get the keys to the car
We're gonna drive to an evil star
We're gonna drive to an evil star

So, put your seatbelts on tight
We're gonna burn through every stoplight
She is turning blue
So, put your seatbelts on tight
The streets are turning white
She is turning blue

Her mouth is falling from the sky
Her mouth is falling from the sky
Her mouth is falling from the sky
I'm gonna catch it like a butterfly

Her mouth is falling from the sky
Her mouth is falling from the sky
Her mouth is falling from the sky
I'm gonna catch it like a butterfly
