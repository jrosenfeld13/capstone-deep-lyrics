Don't know why, but the one I love left me
Left me lonely an' cold an' so weak
And I need someone's arms to hold me
Till I'm strong enough to get back on my feet

Can I sleep in your arms, tonight, mister?
It's so cold lyin' here all alone
An' I have no hold to hold on you
An', I assure you, I'll do you no wrong

I haven't smiled since he left me
'Cause a smile somehow seems out of place
And I just need two lips to kiss me
Then I can smile again and I can show my face

Can I sleep in your arms, tonight, mister?
It's so cold lyin' here all alone
And I have no hold to hold on you
I assure you, I'll do you no wrong
