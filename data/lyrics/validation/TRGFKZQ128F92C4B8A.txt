Is it true what they say?
Are we too blind to find the way?
Fear of the unknown clouds our hearts today

Come into my world
See through my eyes
Try to understand
Don't want to lose what we have

We've been dreaming
But who can deny?
It's the best way of living
Between the truth and the lies

See who I am
Break through the surface
Reach for my hand
Let's show them that we can
Free our minds and find a way
The world is in our hands
This is not the end

Fear is withering the soul at the point of no return
We must be the change we wish to see
I'll come into your world, see through your eyes
I'll try to understand before we lose what we have
We just can't stop believing 'cause we have to try
We can rise above their truth and their lies

See who I am
Break through the surface
Reach for my hand
Let's show them that we can
Free our minds and find a way
The world is in our hands

See who I am
Break through the surface
Reach for my hand
Let's show them that we can
Free our minds and find a way
The world is in our hands
This is not the end

Hear the silence preaching my blame
Will our strength remain if their power reigns?

See who I am
Break through the surface
Reach for my hand
Let's show them that we can
Free our minds and find a way
The world is in our hands

See who I am
Break through the surface
Reach for my hand
Let's show them that we can
Free our minds and find a way
The world is in our hands
This is not the end
