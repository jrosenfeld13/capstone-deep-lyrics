You are more than what we can sing
You are God and nothing we bring is fit for a King
So search us and know deep in our souls
We praise You
You are infinite worth
When weve not the words, our hearts will sing
We are here on the earth
And somehow were heard when our hearts sing to You
You are more than words on our lips
We are poor with nothing to give
But we want to bring more than the song
We sing to praise You, we praise You
You are infinite worth
When weve not the words, our hearts will sing
We are here on the earth
And somehow were heard when our hearts sing to You
Its You we engage
Its You we embrace
When our hearts sing
You are infinite worth
When weve not the words, our hearts will sing
We are here on the earth
And somehow were heard when our hearts sing
We are here on the earth
And somehow we're heard
When our hearts sing to You
Its You we engage
Its You we embrace
When our hearts sing
You are more than words on our lips
We are poor with nothing to give
