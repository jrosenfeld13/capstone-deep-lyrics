[Intro]
Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore

[Verse 1]
A-there's a cockroach in my coffee
There's a needle in my arm
A-and I feel like New York Cittay
A-get me to the farm

[Chorus]
A-get me to the farm
A-get me to the farm
Somebody get me to the farm

[Verse 2]
I got terminal uniqueness
I'm an egocentric man
I get caught up in my freakness
But I ain't no Peter Pan
Get me to the farm

[Chorus]
A-get me to the farm
A-get me to the farm
Somebody get me to the farm

[Verse 3]
Buckle up straight jack
Sanity is such a drag
Jellybean thorazine
Transcendental jet lag
Sanity I am not got to
Feeling like a pi'ata
Sucker punch - blowing lunch
Motherload - pigeonholed
I'm feeling like I'm bout to explode
I want to be a Hare Krishna
Tattoo a dot right on my head
And the prozac is my fixer
I am the livin dead

[Chorus]
A-get me to the farm
A-get me to the farm
Somebody get me to the farm

A-get me to the farm
A-get me to the farm
Somebody get me to the farm

A-get me to the farm
A-get me to the farm
Somebody get me to the farm

A-get me to the farm
A-get me to the farm
Somebody get me to the farm

A-get me to the farm
A-get me to the farm
Somebody get me to the farm

A-get me to the farm
A-get me to the farm
Somebody get me to the farm

[Outro]
