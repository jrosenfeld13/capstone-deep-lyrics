[Verse 1]
Hey you, hey you, Devil's little sister
Listening to your twisted transistor
Hold it between your legs
Turn it up, turn it up
The wind is coming through
Can't get enough

[Pre-Chorus]
A lonely life, where no one understands you
But don't give up, because the music do
Music do!
Music do!
Music do!
Music do!
Music do!
Music do!

[Chorus]
Because the music do
And then it's reaching
Inside you forever preaching
Fuck you too
Your screams will whisper
Hang on you
Twisted transistor

[Verse 2]
Hey you, hey you, finally you get it
The world it can eat you if you let it
And as your tears fall on
Your dress, your dress
But when she's coming through
You're in a mess

[Pre-Chorus]
A lonely life, where no one understands you
But don't give up, because the music do
Music do!
Music do!
Music do!
Music do!
Music do!
Music do!

[Chorus]
Because the music do
And then it's reaching
Inside you forever preaching
Fuck you too
Your screams will whisper
Hang on you
Twisted transistor

[Bridge]
Music do!
Music do!
Music do!
Music do!
Music do!
Music do!
Music do!
Music do!
Hey you, hey you, this won't hurt a bit
This won't hurt a bit, this won't hurt!
Says who?
Says who?
I'm not the timeless bitch
I'm not the timeless bitch
I'm not the time
Just let me be
Between you and me, them things
Them things

[Chorus]
Because the music do
And then it's reaching
Inside you forever preaching
Fuck you too
Your screams will whisper
Hang on you
Twisted transistor
