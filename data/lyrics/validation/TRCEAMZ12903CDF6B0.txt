As an outlet for oppression
And as a tool for control
Icons of a sterile creed have come to rule man's destiny

In the guise of self-made saviuors
They've tried to enslave us all
But these holy chains of imprisonment will be shattered
By the death of god

Encircled by a deceitful light
You escape the harsh reality
Live sheltered from the awful truths
You internalize the lies of a dead revelation

Within the iron gates of fate
They send their lambs to certain death
Control, kill, justify
You've internalized their lies of a fake revelation

You buy redemtion, they crush your pride
And feed your mind with visions spawned by fools
