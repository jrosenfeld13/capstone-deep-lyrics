When you gonna stay the same
Not till I've gone away
When you gonna take the blame
Oh when your love has strayed

When you gonna taste the same
Go and perform again
When you gonna call the game
This is the lost complaint

Chorus:
I just want the focus on you
My photograph won't disappoint you
I just want the focus on you
Marie Claire's /Mademoiselle's /Seventeen's
Got nothing on you
I just want the focus on you

When you gonna change your name
To one that we can say
When you gonna keep the take
That's when the crime has paid

Chorus
