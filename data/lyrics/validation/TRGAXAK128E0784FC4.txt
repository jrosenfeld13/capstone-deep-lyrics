[Chorus 1]
All around that dull grey world
From Moscow to Berlin
People storm the barricades
Walls go tumbling in

[Chorus 2]
The counter-revolution
People smiling through their tears
Who can give them back their lives
And all those wasted years?
All those precious wasted years
Who will pay?

[Chorus 1]
All around that dull grey world
Of ideology
People storm the marketplace
And buy up fantasy

[Chorus 2]
The counter-revolution
At the counter of a store
People buy the things they want
And borrow for a little more
All those wasted years
All those precious wasted years
Who will pay?

[Bridge]
Do we have to be forgiving at last?
What else can we do?
Do we have to say goodbye to the past?
Yes I guess we do

[Chorus 1]
All around this great big world
All the crap we had to take
Bombs and basement fallout shelters
All our lives at stake

[Chorus 2]
The bloody revolution
All the warheads in its wake
All the fear and suffering
All a big mistake
All those wasted years
All those precious wasted years
Who will pay?
