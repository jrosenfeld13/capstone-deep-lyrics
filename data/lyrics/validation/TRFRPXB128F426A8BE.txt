System of corruption
Established by the fear
Build up out of blindness
Of human naivety

Rising of the totalitarianism

First - they will take your mind
Fill it up with lies
Then possess your life
By your unawareness

Depraved imbued with hate

Structure of assumption
Allowed by ignorance
Unreal mind obstruction
As well passivity

Parting from the freedom
Sold as smart price

Thoughts - coagulate to ice
Farewell to known life
Dehumanized
The final alteration

Obey that
What they pray

Frozen tears now
We do all know
Subdued by fear how
Behave is right now

Penetrate the reality
Followed by a hazy fear
They create insanity
All this gets the target near
