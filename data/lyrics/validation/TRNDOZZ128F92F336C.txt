[Verse 1]
How do it feel to be high without drugs?
Some say it's the feelin of love for yourself
I can't call it, I just threw up in the toilet
And all my life I said I wasn't gon' be no alcoholic
I'm fallin son, tryin to stay sober
But the alchohol be callin son like a ghost, so
Let's make a toast to my liver and my kidneys
Pour out a little Henny here's to gout in your twenties
Not many niggas make it to 30 we ride dirty
Breath stinkin, already drinkin, bright an' early
I done hurled off Smirnoff, gin, and 8 ball
Passed out on the bathroom floor with my clothes on
Remember them Mickeys? tall can fit in your Dickies
Before they put them cameras up in the corner store
It used to be so much fun when we was young
Tryin to holler at somethin' smelling like 151
Gettin thrown out the club all buzzed I'm bout to get the gun, dawg
But I ain't even know where I was
My nigga Emae had to carry me home on many day
It was Heineken, Becks, Andr's, and E&J
They say alcoholism is in my DNA
Cause my pops liked to get fucked up the same way
They say alcoholism is in my DNA
Cause my pops liked to get fucked up the same way

[Verse 2]
I got so fucked up last night I passed out
Assed out man I couldn't even get to the house
And I know I shouldn't been drinkin on an empty stomach
But the Flyer said 'open bar', I said fuck it
Went from vodka to rum, from rum to cognac
And my body feel like ive been fightin in combat
And ive been coughin up yellow shit breakin a sweat
I've been shakin like a leaf but that's just what I get
For pourin my own poison and throwin it back
And it's not enough to just know better you gotta act
I know I said that the last time
But I was havin such a good time
The liquor just took hold of my mind
And I don't wanna be a Gil Scott-Heron y'all
But when you're livin' in the bottle then a nigga stop carin'
Cause the ones who made that alcohol ain't my friend
But the sad part is I'mma probably do it again, god damn
