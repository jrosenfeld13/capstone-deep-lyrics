In a taxi chasing for the sun
All around us strangers everyone
With no hope for what they hope for
We could drive all of our tears away

Oh oh ho run run away
Maybe we could run away
Oh oh ho run run away
Maybe we could run away
Oh oh ho

In a taxi ride that ends too soon
The city skyline tries to kick the moon
We have no time for what they wait for
We can drive all of our tears away

Oh oh ho run run away
Maybe we could run away
Oh oh ho run run away
Maybe we could run away
Oh oh ho

You and I against the walled in generation
You and I could kick the walls away
We have no time for what they wait for
We can run fast we can run far

Oh oh ho run run away
Maybe we could run away
Oh oh ho run run away
Maybe we could run away
Oh oh ho run run away
Maybe we could run away
Oh oh ho run run away
Maybe we could run away
Oh oh ho
