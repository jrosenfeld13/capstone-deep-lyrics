Well I don't wanna' take up anybody's time
I'm just givin' my opinion with a rhythm and a clever rhyme
I don't want these words to sound
Like I think I've got it all figured out
But there are a few things I can say I know without a doubt

I know there's a God who knows my name
And a Son who died to take the blame
I believe that Jesus is coming back
'cause promises are promises and facts are facts

These days some say there's no one way to believe
Just keep it loose, you're free to choose
There's no absolute it's all relative you see
Calling all defenders of the truth
Live a life that spells out God's worldview
Let these words be heard in everything you say and do

I know there's a God who knows my name
And a Son who died to take the blame
I believe that Jesus is coming back
'cause promises are promises and facts are facts

As sure as there's a law of gravity
That says what goes up must come down
This is the ultimate reality
That God is, and God loves, and God can be found

Well I know there's a God who knows my name
Promises are promises and facts are facts
And a Son who died to take the blame
Promises are promises and facts are facts
And I believe that Jesus is coming back
'Cause promises are promises and facts are facts

I know there's a God who knows my name
And a Son who died to take the blame
I believe that Jesus is coming back
'cause promises are promises and facts are facts

Promises are promises and facts are facts
Promises are promises and facts are facts
Promises are promises and facts are facts
