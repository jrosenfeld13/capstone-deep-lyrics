I'm takin' all your little toys away
You don't have any say so in your future
The pretty colors and the shiny lights
Do we just chase whatever we desire?

Oh silent night
Oh holy night
Sometimes you see me
Sometimes you don't

You'll get to know me better
After a walk in the dark
The monster in the mirror
We'll take a walk in the dark
Woah - we'll take a walk in the dark
Woah - we'll take a walk in the dark

I'm not afraid to close my eyes at night
I'm not afraid of what my dreams will show me
I saw a fish that had a human head
I saw some things that I would like to show you:

The broken glass
The car's on fire
Open the cages
And set them free

Mine eyes have seen the glory
I took a walk in the dark
It ain't no bedtime story
We'll take a walk in the dark
Woah - we'll take a walk in the dark
Woah - we'll take a walk in the dark

Oooh -
Who will help ya now?
Surrender
My love
Let it all come down
Burn baby burn

Now Jesus, Mary and the Holy Ghost
Took one look and they said, "Hey, we're lost!"
"How the hell do we get outa here?"
They shit their pants, they got so scared

So no matter who you are
Ya need a walk in the dark
The sweetest thing I ever saw
I took a walk in the dark
Woah - we'll take a walk in the dark
Woah - we'll take a walk in the dark
