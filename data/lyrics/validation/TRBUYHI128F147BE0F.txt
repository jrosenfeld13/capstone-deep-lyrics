There is a world. I've never heard
Yet I hear it most of the time
Here is a sound. I've never found
Yet I feel it most of the time

Oh should they ever turn you to blue, dear
What will I do
And should they ever turn you to gray, dear
What will I say

Oh oh oh oh oh, don't you turn too
Oh oh oh oh oh, if I ever change

Learn to confide, we'll move tides
I believe this most of the time
Whether it be untrue, fade from gray, fade to blue
All we need is most of the time

Oh should they ever turn you to blue, dear
What will I do
And should they ever turn you to gry, dear
What will I say

Oh oh oh oh oh, don't you turn too
Oh oh oh oh oh, if I ever change

There is a word, love
Mosgt of the time
There is a word, love

Oh oh oh oh oh, don't you turn too
Oh oh oh oh oh, if I ever change
