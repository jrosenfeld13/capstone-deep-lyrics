[Verse 1]
I clambered over mounds and mounds
Of polystyrene foam
And fell into a swimming pool
Filled with fairy snow

[Chorus]
And watched the world turn day-glo
You know you know
The world turned day-glo
You know
Oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I wrenched the nylon curtains back
As far as they would go
And peered through perspex window panes
At the acrylic road

[Chorus]
And watched the world turn day-glo
You know you know
The world turned day-glo
You know
Oh-oh

[Verse 3]
I drove my polypropolene
Car on wheels of sponge
Then pulled into a wimpy bar
To have a rubber bun

[Chorus]
And watched the world turn day-glo
You know you know
The world turned day-glo
You know
Oh-oh


[Sax Solo]

[Chorus]
The world turn day-glo
You know you know
The world turned day-glo
You know
Oh-oh

[Verse 4]
The X-rays were penetrating
Through the laytex breeze
Synthetic fibre see-thru leaves
Fell from the rayon trees

[Chorus]
The day the world turn day-glo
You know you know
The world turned day-glo
You know you know
The world turned day-glo
You know you know
The world turned day-glo
You know
Oh-oh
