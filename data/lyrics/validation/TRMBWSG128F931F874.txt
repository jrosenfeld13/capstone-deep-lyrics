I'm clinging to this thing haphazardly
I can't hold onto this thing right now

This is what the house feels like without you in it

I'm dreaming of leaving all night these days
I can't come 'round from this dream right now

This is what the house feels like without you in it
This is what the bed feels like without you in it

Whoever named the fall sure did a bang up job
They might as well have been talking 'bout me
Whoever named the fall sure did a bang up job
'Cause I'm falling in and out of your love

Haphazardly, haphazardly
Haphazardly, haphazardly

This is what the world feels like without you in it
