[Intro:]
If you love me
Say you do
If you want me
Say you do

[Verse 1:]
Your body chemistry
Your history
Your smile
I like it
I like your style

Magnetic mystery
You're hypnotistic, child
I'm knee deep
You drive me wild

[Chorus:]
If you love me
Say you do
If you want me
Say you do

If you need me
Say you do
(I need to hear it)
If you love me
Say you do

[Verse 2:]
So electrifying
You soon might just blow my fuse
Love skipper
It's you I choose

I'd buy a trip
Desire
Systematic smooth
I'm hooked up
I'm hooked on you

[Repeat Chorus:]
If you love me
Say you do
If you want me
Say you do

If you need me
Say you do
(I need to hear it)
If you love me
Say you do

[Bridge:]
Your body chemistry
Your history
Your smile
I like it
I like your style

Magnetic mystery
You're hypnotistic, child
I'm knee deep
You drive me wild

[Repeat Chorus:]
If you love me
Say you do
If you want me
Say you do

If you need me
Say you do
(I need to hear it)
If you love me
Say you do
