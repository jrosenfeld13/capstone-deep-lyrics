[Verse 1: Sporty & Baby]
There will come a time
I know I'm gonna need
Someone I can trust, someone who'll fight for me
That's the way I love
This is my time to work things out
What i want from this life
There will be someone out there for me
That's the way I love

[Pre-Chorus: Sporty & Baby]
It doesn't really matter whoever you are
Don't matter where you go
Just make sure you're there to answer when
Love comes around, don't be surprised
When love knocks at your door

[Chorus: All]
You're the prayer that I take
You're the smile on my face
Every time I breathe in
Brings me warmth from within
When you touch me I start believing
Loving is like Oxygen

[Verse 2: Posh & Scary]
Even when we're so far apart
I still feel you in my heart
'Cos you've given me the greatest gift of all
That's the way I love
The way I love ain't easy
But it could never be for me
The situation seems so insane
It's all about feeling without insecurities
That's the way I love

[Pre-Chorus: Sporty & Baby]
It doesn't really matter whoever you are
Don't matter where you go
Just make sure you're there to answer when
Love comes around, don't be surprised
When love knocks at your door

[Chorus: All]
You're the breath that I take
You're the smile on my face
Every time I breathe in
Brings me warmth from within
When you touch me I start believing
Loving is like oxygen
You're in every breath I take
Imagine a life without love
I'd be so afraid(sooo afraid)
'Cause the love that we share would be
Hard to replace
Baby hold me and never leave me
This love is my oxygen
This love is my oxygen

[Verse 3: Sporty & Baby]
Open your heart
Take a deep breath
Stop searching, start believing
Make sure you're there to answer when love
Comes around
Don't be surprised
When true love knocks at your door

[Chorus: All]
You're the breath that I take
You're the smile on my face
Every time I breathe in
Brings me warmth from within
When you touch me I start believing
Loving is like oxygen
You're in every breath that I take
Imagine a world without love
I'd be so afraid (sooo afraid)
'Cause the love that we share would
Be hard to replace
Baby hold me and never leave me
This love is my oxygen
This love is my oxygen
