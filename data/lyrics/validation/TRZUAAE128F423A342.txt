[Chorus]
My smile is stuck
I cannot go back to your frownland

[Verse 1]
My spirit's made up of the ocean
And the sky and the sun and the moon
And all my eyes can see
I cannot go back to your land of gloom
Where black jagged shadows
Remind me of the coming of your doom
I want my own land

[Verse 2]
Take my hand and come with me
It's not too late for you, if it's not too late for me
To find my homeland
Where a man can stand by another man
Without an ego flying
With no man lying
And no one dying by an earthly hand
Let the devils burn and the beggar learn
And the little girls that live in those old worlds
Take my kind hand

[Chorus]
My smile is stuck
I cannot go back to your frownland
I cannot go back to your frownland
