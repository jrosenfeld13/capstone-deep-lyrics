I hold my head in my hands

And I don't know what to do

I hold my head in my hands

She falls down when I bend

Don't undersand

Why in a zombie movie

All humans have to flee

What we all wanna be ?

I had a strange dream

And I don't know what it means

I fix my head at my feet, now

I look headless in the street

"Forgive me baby" she said

"I can't stand you no more !

I feel so down today"

Then she fell off the floor...

"Mirror, mirror, tell me frankly

Who's the funniest of all ?"

My blood is like wine, in my mind

I'm so drunk, I'm a swine

Just like you

Oh no, tell me no

I'm not the man that I thought...

So long ! So long ! So long... Bye ! Bye !

So in the end, you have to speak to pigmen

You wonder what they mean

- Piggy, do you love me ?

Are you from planet Mars ?

- ...

- Well, I guess that you are !

Down so down I feel so down today

I feel so down from my nose to my toes...

So in the end, I knew I lost my mind

I pulled my head, I pulled it off my hands

Down in a box, upon a shelf

So she won't have to face me once again

Down in a box, upon a shelf...

All actors have for tasks

To pull away the masks

For we all hide our faces

Beneath a false human grace

Piggy, do you love me ?

Tell me you love me !

Piggy, do you love me ?

Tell me you do...
