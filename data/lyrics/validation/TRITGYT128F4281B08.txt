Listen ladies
If your man should leave you
At home with all them babies
By yourself
Don't you feel bad
Honey don't you get mad
Go out and find you somebody else
There got to be
Somebody in this world for you
Yes there is
Somebody in this world for you

Now listen fellas
If someone rolls up beside your woman
And takes her away in one of them long El Dorado Cadillacs
Listen
Don't you feel bad
Buddy don't you get mad
Go out and find you somebody else
There got to be
Somebody in this world for you
Yes there is
Somebody in this world for you

Let me tell you
There's gotta be somebody out there this evening
Men and women go together
Boys and girls go together
Ladies and gentlemen go together
I don't care what you hear there's somebody out there for you
