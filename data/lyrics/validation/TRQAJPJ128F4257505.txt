Mmm, oh yeah...

Some of the men will buy you diamonds and pearls
And those are the things that mean a lot to some girls
But all I have is love, darling, all I have is love

Now they will take you places that you want to go
And show you things that you've never seen before
But all I have is love, darling, all I have is love

Maybe I'm poor, but it's you I really adore
If you won't accept it then you can walk straight out the door
'Cause all I have is love, darling, all I have is love

Some of the men will buy you diamonds and pearls
And those are the things that mean a lot to some girls
But all I have is love, darling, all I have is love

Woohoo... yeah he yeah alright... na na na na...
