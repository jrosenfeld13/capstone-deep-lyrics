To sleep with anger every day
And put your prayers in someone's mouth
I watch you struggle with your own antidote
Then you spit it out, spit it out

And I can't breathe while I watch you
Sell yourself into the world
You try to steal my life

Now kill the hatred with a new sound
Put a new voice in a dry mouth
Breaking the prison inside
We're running riot now

Now kill the hatred with a new sound
Put a new voice in a dry mouth
While we bide our time
Afraid, we wait or overthrow

Overthrow, overthrow

Things we were taught, a stain hard to remove
Beauty in our makeup, peace in a gun
Pushing our souls in resistance to prove
One of these colors doesn't bleed and run

Things we were taught, a stain hard to remove
Beauty in our makeup, peace in a gun
Pushing our souls in resistance to prove
One of these colors doesn't bleed and run

It's the war inside of us all

Poverty is the biggest, strongest jail
That the government ever built
So we go paralyzed
By the lie of socialized violence

And while American culture seeds
Stagnation with its guilt
Society is the lie we define with our silence

Now kill the hatred with a new sound
Put a new voice in a dry mouth
Breaking the prison inside
We're running riot now

Now kill the hatred with a new sound
Put a new voice in a dry mouth
While we bide our time
Afraid, we wait or overthrow

And while American culture seeds
Stagnation with its guilt
Society is the lie we define
We define with our silence

With our silence
With our silence
With our silence

A living thing
Resounding one lesson
Forever, always
