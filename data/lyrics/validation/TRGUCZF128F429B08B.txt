Do you want to ride?
Do you want to feel?
Do you want to perfect your craft?

My body is like a metaphor
It's holding me back, I'm looking for more
I'm like a child, so very innocent
A curious one, with the want for more

It's the sweetness that I crave, more and more everyday
My feelings are like the wind, they are felt and sensed
But not visualized by the eyes
This is my premonition, this is my disguise

Do you want to ride?
Do you want to feel?
Do you want to perfect your craft?

Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
I'm searching for more

It's a feeling in your head
A feeling through your body
A sense of knowing
A sense of knowing
It's a feeling in your head
A feeling through your body
A sense of knowing
A sense of knowing
A sense of knowing
A sense of knowing
A sense of knowing

My body is like a metaphor, day to day I live as a person
I want the state of emptiness

Do you want to ride?
Do you want to feel?
Do you want to perfect your craft?

My body is like a metaphor
