I can live with god and with suicide
The same thing holds if I close my eyes
It's a truth so pure it can kill you dead
A taste of heaven mixed with hell inside of my head

If a three-four chord can ignite a flame
And a girl like you can forget my name
Then I'm that far gone up this crooked [grave]
With a pistol for my creature and a feather for my day

When I took her down in a rain of toil
With a hand in my satchel and my knees in the soil
I will live with god and with suicide
My lover and her calico, a pony stands at her side

I can live with god and with suicide
The same thing holds if I close my eyes
It's a truth so pure it can kill you dead
A taste of heaven mixed with hell inside of my head
