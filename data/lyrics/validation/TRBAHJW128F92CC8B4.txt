"Love is lost but not forgotten"

Love is lost but not forgotten
I keep repeating to myself every day
Too many times I have seen
Autumn leaves turn to snow
Flowers wither to dust
But I promise
They will suffer well

Cursed be the day
When they took her away
And left me to bleed to death
Too many times since then
I have seen all beauty die
And the lakes turn to ice

But I swear
I will have my revenge
But I swear
I will have my revenge

I wander between two worlds
No one can see me
They just feel my cold breath behind their backs
No redemption for the lost souls
I am doomed to walk the earth

But I swear
I will put them to eternal sleep
Then I can leave
