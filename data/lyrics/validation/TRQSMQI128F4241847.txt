If I venture in the slipstream
Between the viaducts of your dream
Where immobile steel rims crack
And the ditch in the back roads stop

Could you find me?
Would you kiss my eyes?
And lay me down
In silence easy

To be born again

From the far side of the ocean
I put the wheels in motion
And I'm standin' with my arms behind me
And I'm pushin' on the door

Could you find me?
Would you kiss my eyes?
Lay me down
In silence easy

To be born again

You're starin' with the look of avarice
Talkin' with Huddie Ledbetter
And whisperin' in the hall
Showin' pictures on the wall
And pointin' a finger at me

There you go
You're standin' in the sun darlin'
With your arms behind you
And your eyes before

There you go
You're takin' good care of your boy
Seein' that he's got clean clothes
Puttin' on his little red shoes

And point a finger at me
Starin' straight ahead
And here I am
Standing in your sad arrest
Trying to do my very best

Lookin' straight at you
Comin' through, darlin'

If I ventured in the slipstream
Between the viaducts of your dreams
Where immobile steel rims crack
And the ditch in the back roads stop

Could you find me
Would you kiss my eyes
Lay me down
In silence easy

To be born again

In another world
In another time
In another place
So far away
