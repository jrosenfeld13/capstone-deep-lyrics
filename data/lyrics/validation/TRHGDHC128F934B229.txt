The bigger they are, the harder they fall
Where are you now in this mess you have made?
I'm leaving you here, to fend for your own
I cannot help I am already gone
{Chorus}
Pieces of dreams cannot kill the touch only the mind
These little pieces of things I've grown to hate so much
Delivered and burned, you see how it works
I could explain, but I'd feel like a jerk
I close my eyes and feed your pain
Helpless ritual, ritual habits sustained
{Chorus}
Pieces of dreams cannot kill the touch only the mind
These little pieces of dreams I've grown to hate so much
What about the de-compassion
That is in the movement on the wheels that we ride?
Kill your life!
{after chorus}
Can I believe that I need someone, to make me feel like I am special?
To lie beneath a snail with no one, and feel like a million voices
With a poor excuse I'm guilty. With the blood on my hands you'll see
Hide in the ruins that you've ruined, when you couldn't see...
Running lost intertwined with a weak compromise
Lacking a soul with the will to survive
Repeat
{chorus}
