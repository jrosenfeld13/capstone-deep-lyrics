My hand is shaking like an old mans hand
I'm trying to keep it still
I'm so dead angry my tears come out as steam
And yet I wonder if the blame's on me
And I try so hard
Not to hate you now
Not to break you now
But I swear to God, that you're no good
You keep telling me, how I'm bound to loose
And maybe that might be so
But I never tried to make you look bad
Just out of lack of self control
You're a fire burning out too slow
More than that, I just don't know
But I swear to God, that you're no good
It's just the evil in me, I suppose
Before I know it I just go off
It's just the evil in me, I suppose
Before I know it I just go off
You're a fire burning out too slow
More than that, I just don't know
But I swear to God, that you're no good
