Did I strangle you with my love?
Think I saw it wrapped around your throat
The last time I saw you, you looked so pale
And white just like a ghost

It was fun for about five little minutes
And then you cleared your throat
My eyes swelled up, I curled my toes
And you said I almost choked
And you said I almost choked

But honey why did you go
Behind the bunhouse?
Didn't you know how much I had to give?
You knocked me over the head
With a rolling pin
And then you got down and you kicked me in the ribs

The penny dropped even before I clocked
Just where your hands had been
It's like you'd done your hair for somebody else
Scared that you might have been seen

I slipped down a flight of stairs
And my face must have looked so long
Cos even the tosser with the saxophone
Was asking me what's wrong
He said 'buddy, what is wrong?'

Honey why did you go
Behind the bunhouse?
Didn't you know how much I had to give?
You knocked me over the head
With a rolling pin
And then you got down and you kicked me in the ribs

Please won't you spare me the details
Before I get up and I go
Who was it that stabbed me in the back
Or do you think I ought not to know?

You see the way I was before we met
I was curled up in a shell
And if I'm not counting planes up in the sky
Then I'm falling down a well
I'm at the bottom of a well

Honey why did you go
Behind the bunhouse?
Didn't you know how much I had to give?
You knocked me over the head
With a rolling pin
And then you got down and you kicked me in the ribs

Part 2

The boy who cried wolf couldn't take it anymore
They all tried to help but he'd heard it all before
Now he sits in a room with a lock on the door
Holding pictures in his arms and staring at the floor

But boy, you don't look a day over twenty one
But you already feel like half your life has gone
And you're close to the edge but you're hanging on
Do yourself a favour, don't do yourself any harm

And you want to tell your story but you don't know where to start
Well, your mother's pretty lonely but she don't have a heart
And you met the rich and famous and they're screwed up the same
Even "love will tear us apart" don't ease the pain

You can wipe the blood from your shoes and the tear from your eye
But the scars on your arms, well, they're harder to hide
Drawing on a cigarette, hoping your head will clear
Is like rubbing on a lamp untill a genie appears

And the last time you counted you were twenty three
But you still don't know who you want to be
And all of your heroes took their own lives
Do yourself a favour and take my advice

Oh you want to tell your story but you don't know where to start
Well, your mother's pretty lonely but she don't have a heart
And you met the rich and famous and they're screwed up the same
Even "love will tear us apart" don't ease the pain

Oh boy, you don't look a day over twenty one
But you already feel like half your life has gone
And you're close to the edge but you're hanging on
Do yourself a favour, don't do yourself any harm

And you want to tell your story but you don't know where to start
Well, your mother's pretty lonely but she don't have a heart
And you met the rich and famous and they're screwed up the same
Even "love will tear us apart" don't ease the pain
