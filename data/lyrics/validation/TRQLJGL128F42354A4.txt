[Chorus]
Go to sleep, you weary hobo
Let the towns drift slowly by
Can't you hear the steel rails hummin'?
That's a hobo's lullaby

[Verse 1]
Do not think about tomorrow
Let tomorrow come and go
Tonight you're in a nice warm boxcar
Safe from all the wind and snow

[Chorus]
Go to sleep, you weary hobo
Let the towns drift slowly by
Can't you hear the steel rails hummin'?
That's a hobo's lullaby

[Verse 2]
I know your clothes are torn and tattered
And your hair is turning grey
But, lift your head and smile at trouble
You'll find peace and rest someday

[Chorus]
So, go to sleep, you weary hobo
Let the towns drift slowly by
Can't you hear the steel rails hummin'?
That's a hobo's lullaby
