Crash landing on earth, Baby
I can't believe it but the fault is done
We came back to human kind and life is much wilder

Just be here keep concentrated, let's never change even if time goes by
Let's smash these fucking choices and let's stay together

Life is such a short time, Baby
Do we have to think about it ?
I'm lovesick UFO
Summer is on its own

Life's too obvious, Baby
Every choice is here to make you old
In every situation we belong to each other

It's overconsumption, Baby
I just want you to be it sometimes, girl
Let's just leave the human kind and let's stay together

It's overconsumption, Baby
I just want you to think about it
I'm lovesick UFO
Summer is on its own
