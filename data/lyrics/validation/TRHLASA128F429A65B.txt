The weather is fright'ning
The thunder and lightning
Seem to be having their way
But as far as i'm concerned, it's a lovely day
The turn in the weather
Will keep us together
So i can honestly say
That as far as i'm concerned, it's a lovely day
And everything's o.k

Isn't this a lovely day
To be caught in the rain?
You were going on your way
Now you've got to remain

Just as you were going, leaving me all at sea
The clouds broke, they broke and oh!
What a break for me

I can see the sun up high
Tho' we're caught in the storm
I can see where you and i
Could be cozy and warm

Let the rain pitter patter
But it really doesn't matter
If the skies are gray
Long as i can be with you it's a lovely day
