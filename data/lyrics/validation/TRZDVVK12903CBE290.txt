Pissed stained mattress
Canned dog food
Straight jacket session
Padded room
I see the light through a single foot
And I think I'm getting worse as the months goes by
Ya just couldn't live by the rules now you stay in the asylum
Ya couldn't fit in like we wanted but in here we can teach you
And if ya can't live by our rule then you'll die in the asylum
Am I insane
So they say
Lights out at 8
Take the pills
Shocking treatment
Break your will
Your progress report is looking grim and
Were trying other meds for the state your in
Out there you only make trouble for the passive ones
We understand your mind was too strong for the thought control
Committed
Never fit for release
