I lost my will somehow
And found the concept to win
All thoughts can't' be allowed
So all: repent and join in

Let us all just be the same
Join in hands and walk the same way
Those who differ take the blame
Raise your head and walk without shame
Everything would just be plain
All should learn to play the same game
Walk the same way
Feel the same
We'll be buried in the same grave
When the world's tamed
End of days
If we all could be the same way
Talk the same way
Walk the same way
