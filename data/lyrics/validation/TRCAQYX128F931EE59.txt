Spreading peace and love
In the minefields of Angola
A photo opportunity
Celebrity has sold ya
They made front page news again
But they all hate the Paparazzi lens

Hollywood cocaine
A royal fascination
Cinematic lives
Far too much temptation
10% reduction to the charitable cause
Designers help stop third world wars

Verci always win
Benetton don't kill
Gap never sins
And we all get to pay the bill

United Nations all
Waiting for that presidential call
The next one in
Watch that jaded popstar grin

Wear another name
Promote another label
Donate another dollar
From the budget on yer table
Explosive occupations for
The heroes faking for their cause

Fake it all
