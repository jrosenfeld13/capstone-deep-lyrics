It's raining at the border, tears of love like blood spilt
Stagnant on the carpet
It's raining and another filthy widow watches
And the self is no friend and all enemies attack from within
Way down deep, you know why
The darkness is separated by a slow, red river
Night sneaks into sleepy corners
I lay at the edge of a field of fire
With a thousand ghosts in my dusty bed, a thousand ghosts
Way down deep you know why

The earth spits threadbare it's shallow daughters
Who tread like broken tramps
Damp on stone cold stares and deep
Within the fear of a hundred lonely victims down
Way deep down you know why

I will listen for your baited steps
Like shadows in the hall
That fall slowly and trace the shutters of your hollow
Thoughts and beat my heart against these walls, and beat my heart
It's raining at the border, it's raining, it's raining, tears of blood
It's raining
It's raining
