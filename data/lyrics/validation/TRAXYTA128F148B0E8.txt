When you lead me
And fit around my tongue
It's so easy, to forget that I'm lost
Spent all of my life
Waiting for answers
To lift me, to numb me, to define it all

Sunshine, I'm beginning to like this

Cause all I want to be is the minute that you hold me in
When you pretend that I'm all that you waited for
Time slips to nothing and I'm better than I've ever been
I'm suspended

With your breathing, filling up my lungs
I can almost believe that I'm almost enough
Spent all of my life emptied of anthems
And bracing for something that never did come

Sunshine, I'm beginning to like this
Sunshine, I'm beginning to like it

Cause all I want to be is the minute that you hold me in
When you pretend that I'm all that you waited for
Time slips to nothing and I'm better than I've ever been
I'm suspended

It's not enough to stay surrounded
It's not enough to stay awake, torn, braced, cornered
And not feel alive

Sunshine, I'm beginning to like this
Sunshine, I'm beginning to like it

Cause all I want to be is the minute that you hold me in
When you pretend that I'm all that you waited for
Time slips to nothing and I'm better than I've ever been
I'm suspended
I'm suspended
I'm suspended
