Give me a helping hand
You powers in disguise
Tell me love
Have you been send from high above ?
And no eternity
Can take the pain away from me

Hrst Du die Engel ?
I feel the devil walks thru me

I hear the angels
Ich spre den Teufel tief in mir

Tyranny
Why can't you leave me
In silence
Agony
I feel you come to me
In silence
