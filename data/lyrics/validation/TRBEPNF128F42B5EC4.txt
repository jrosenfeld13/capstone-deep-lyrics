They stood upon the deck
As the ship went out to sea
The wind it took the sails
And left the land a memory
All upon the shore for
To wonder why the sailor goes
All to close their eyes
And wonder what the sailor knows

That is you to them
That is how they think you are
Never on the land
But sailing by the North Star

To the tower and to the ravens
And the tale that hopes they'll never leave
What if they should go?
We always dread to think of them
I wonder if they flew one day
And no-one ever knew they'd gone
To circle over ships at sea
Claiming yet another son

That is you to me
That is where I think you are
Never on the land
But gone to find the North Star
