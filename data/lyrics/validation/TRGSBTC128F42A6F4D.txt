I recall when the fire burned
Infested memories that last for years
Before your own pitiful existence
Has to be reconsidered once again
I'm still missing the essential
Wondering about the futility of your words
An eager desire the will to understand
The essence of that fascinating bitter end
Striving to keep the pieces together
Slowly climbing the stairways of recovery
A glimpse of warmth as an exit
To venture where the answers lie
Living another day I can't relate to
Somehow I will find a passage through
