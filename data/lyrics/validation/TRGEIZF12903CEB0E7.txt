Oh oh oh oh oh

[Chorus]
I'd really like to have it
But you know that we shouldn't order
Not that I'm a moral man
But you know what I I am
If I met you on the corner
Where I was once a man
Still I couldn't put it to you
But fear that you would understand

If we weren't [?]
Know that that's my favorite track
I live inside dirty water
I trust that you would take my hand
I know [?] obsession
And you've got nothing on back
Bad ways of tilted talking
Still the best you've ever had

[Chorus 2]
There has been no dirty moment
But I feel the need for bathing
I am going to keep my clothes off
Are you gonna call me baby

[Chorus]

[Chorus 2]
