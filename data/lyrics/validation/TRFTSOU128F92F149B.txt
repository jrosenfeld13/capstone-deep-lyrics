We the Matchstick Men, me and Viva love the classics
We kick a flash flood, rhythm tripping on some acid
Hit the studio, then the blunt, skipping classes
All the hipsters laughing at us, man they look like UMass kids
Well if they are white, male, and privileged then I bet you that's them
Black beats of a black Red Sox flat brim
Xbox, Assassin's Creed, got it mastered
Dorm room state of mind, bastard

I feel my iPhone buzzing, ironic cause I'm in class
Buzzing hard off the Adderall and fresh cut grass
Probably thought I'd keep my mouth shut, mother fuck that
A hipster talks shit and I'm jizzing on his mustache
Hit the rhythm like a joint: puff, pass
We shaking up the community like a varsity bus crash
Drop the beat, call it artsy, they'll love that
Spoken word poetry, Now everybody loves rap

[Viva]
I'm low income never fucking judge that
My style never should have happened like a touchback
Now I'm getting on the track
Pissing people off by the masses
I'm here to bring the fun back (do it)

I'm a casual genius when it comes to rap
And I got a magical penis, in fact
Every time I get some licky-licky on my nut sack
A unicorn is born and J. K. Rowling gets a dick in her butt-crack

I hit the track fast
On a bag of grass
Jacking off into my coffee
Using it as substitute half and half
I find the chick with the flattest ass
Only eat her out if her vagina has its own habitat

So quit yapping that "Palin's gonna happen" crap
Puff and pass it back it ain't a fucking acid tab
Jesus, just hipsters having laugh attacks
DGAF, got the bag of weed out the almanac

We in the beat like little boys' asses
Its that encore "Yonkers" for you bastards
Me and Alec poised the back
Sweaty, and some feminists masturbating at a Kids Choice concert

Hipsters mad because we don't bring violins
We bring violence and the pedophile dicks
So hide your child quick
Cause if I can't fuck him
Then I'm touching myself for acting childish

Vivarosa on the Paul Bunyan dick
Yeah, it's all fun and shit until Lihi's butthole rips
Bitch
