Time is all we have
Look around and see it's just you and me, baby
The atmosphere is love
The thunders rollin' hit the lights 'cause they keep going in and out
I'd rather see your silhouette, once the candles lit

CHORUS
Hold me baby keep it (keep it comin' baby)
All night long ('till after the candles burn)
And we'll still be going on and on and blowing ya kisses 'till morning the
Sun will be shining but we'll be going on..'till after the candles burn
Whoo, Whoo...Whoo

Don't be suprised if I start to cry
From the emotions taking over our bodies-your body and mine
You kiss the softer side, you pass it by, you never stop and I recline
'cause I won't stop like it's candles we'll be burning

CHORUS

All of these feelings inside us come by
As we capture love supernaturally that can't be defined
One of the moments we've been waiting for our whole lives
We'll love every minute
Like we were finished
We'll light the candles and do it again

CHORUS
