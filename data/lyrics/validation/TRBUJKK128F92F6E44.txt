Well I was born with a dark cloud above me
A longing deep in my soul
I was raised up right and I know my momma loved me
But I begged her to let me go

I said, "The grass is greener on the other side
Somewhere there's a bluer sky
I won't stop runnin' 'til I'm satisfied
And if wishes were horses, I would ride, ride, ride"

You know, I love you, my true companion
You've been my lifelong friend
But there's a hunger inside me
That I can't abandon 'til I see what's around the bend

You know, the grass is greener on the other side
Somewhere there's a bluer sky
I won't stop runnin' 'til I'm satisfied
And if wishes were horses, I would ride, ride, ride

Now I've been a rogue and I've been a rambler
I know too well my sins
I've got the faith of a saint but the soul of a gambler
And a heart like the restless wind

You know, the grass is greener on the other side
Somewhere there's a bluer sky
I won't stop runnin' 'til I'm satisfied
And if wishes were horses, I would ride, ride, ride
Yeah, if wishes were horses, I would ride, ride, ride
