I fell in love
We started dating
At first it was frightening
I wished it could go away

I knocked down your door
Intimidating
We started off flirting
But ended up hating

Don't forget me
Just let time decide
Let the ocean drain and...
All the stars fall down

We both know the story
And how it's ending
It's been good to know you baby
But we never speak again

When you're in Rome
Do as the Romans
I was just relating
To what everyone else were saying

Started so well
I'm just pretending
That nothing is missing
