It's been raining for a fortnight or longer
And every day the pressure's getting stronger
All the houses slowly sink into water
We have enough to drink
But the food is getting shorter

[Chorus]
WATERFALL- Here's another day
WATERFALL- The sun has turned away
The sky has opened up the doors
St. Peter's trying to sweep the floors
He sent a million raindrops on their way

WATERFALL - Here we go again
WATERFALL - it never seems to end
We used to drive but now we float
So sell your car and buy a boat
But you can't escape the pouring rain

Everybody's looking for a solution
The weather experts, The Department of Pollution
On the news they said there's no need to worry
There's nothing we can do
Just learn to swim in a hurry

[Chorus]
WATERFALL - Here's another day
WATERFALL- The sun has turned away
The sky has opened up the doors
St. Peter's trying to sweep the floors
He sent a million raindrops on their way
He sent them on their way

And it rains and it rains
It rains all day
The cities are washed away
And it rains and it rains
It rains all night
It rains all the time

[Chorus]
WATERFALL - Here's another day
WATERFALL - The sun has turned away
The sky has opened up the doors
St. Peter's trying to sweep the floors
He sent a million raindrops on their way

WATERFALL - Here we go again
WATERFALL - It never seems to end
We used to drive but now we float
So sell your car and buy a boat
And if you buy a second one
It could turn out as lots of fun
And never mind the pouring rain
