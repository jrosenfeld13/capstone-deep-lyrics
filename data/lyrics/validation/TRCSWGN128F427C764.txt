This evening at sundown
We meet in our small town
Everyone's going without ever knowing
To meet for the countdown
Our friends and our families
All hangout at Riley's
We stay for a while and jam out Guiel
Then walk on down George Street

And this road we choose, nothing to lose at all
That's the way it was and the way it is

Gone are the old days
Now we're on to something new
Our lives in the fast lane
Though it's not the same without you
It's not the same without you

Shows at the Gordon Best
And hockey at Northcrest
Our malls were a disgrace
Remember Portage Place
When we got kicked out
And told to never show our face

This road we choose, nothing to lose at all
That's the way it was and the way it is

Gone are the old days
Now we're on to something new
Our lives in the fast lane
Though it's not the same without you
It's not the same without you

We will keep, on our feet
In the streets that will never sleep

Gone are the old days
Now we're on to something new
Our lives in the fast lane
Though it's not the same without you
It's not the same without you
