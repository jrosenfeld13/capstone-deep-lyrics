Two men stand upon a solemn hill
The wind smell fresh before the storm
Fear's not present in their valiant minds
Thoughts on glory and to kill

Tonight, they won't give up without a fight
They will revenge and show their might
Two against many, soon the victory's won
Tonight, they won't give up without a fight
They will revenge and show their might
Two against many, let the demons be gone

There won't be no tales about this day
A silent prayer to his god
Battle evil in the form of snakes
Takes a will of steel to slay
