It's the same kind of story
That seems to come down from long ago
Two friends havin' coffee together
When something flies by their window
It might be out on that lawn which is wide
At least half of a playing field
Because there's no explaining
Your imagination can make you see and feel
Seems like a dream, got me hypnotized

Now it's not a meaningless question
To ask if they've been and gone
I remember a talk about North Carolina
And a strange, strange pond
You see the sides were like glass
In the thick of a forest without a road
And if any man's hand ever made that land
Then I think it would've showed
Seems like a dream, got me hypnotized

The say there's a place down in Mexico
Where a man can fly over mountains and hills
And he don't need no airplane or some kind of engine
And he never will;
Now you know it's a meaningless question
To ask if these stories are right
'Cause what matters most is the feeling
You get when you're hypnotized
Seems like a dream, got me hypnotized
