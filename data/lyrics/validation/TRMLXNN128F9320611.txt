[Verse 1]
I keep an open mind
But only till the bottle stops to spin
And there is only one direction
In the state that I am in
High on the heels of an opening door
You run out
Battered and bruised, strangely relieved
You run in

[Verse 2]
You said life it still worth living
Girl, you you don't seem so sure
You only need to be more certain
What it is you're living for
Climbing the hill of pursuing
The front runner's tail
Lower the bar to a point
You can't possibly fail
