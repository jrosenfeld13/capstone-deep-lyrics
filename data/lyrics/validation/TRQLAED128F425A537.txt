Hey babe you know I feel it
Way down to my toes
Hey babe you know I need it
To help let the whole thing flow
Gonna slip right down here
And wait until the sunlight goes
Hey babe you know I love you
Gonna let you know what it's all about
For god's sake babe don't lose it
Don't throw it all away
For god's sake you know I love it
I'm gonna do it everyday
Gonna slip right down here
Wait until the sunlight goes

Hey babe you know I love you
Gonna let you know what it's all about

Hey babe you know I feel you
Way down to my soul
Hey babe you know I need you
Gonna let the good times roll
Gonna sit right down here
Wait until the sunlight warms my soul
Hey babe you know I love you
Gonna let the whole world know what it's all about

I think I feel it coming on
I think I feel it coming on now
