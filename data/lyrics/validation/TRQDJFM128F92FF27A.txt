You don't know me
Like I know myself
So don't assume
What you cannot know
There's what you think
And there's what's fact
But only I can tell you
Just where I'm at
There's what is real
And what you're dreaming
Don't get confused
With what you want believe

Analyse yourself
Before you criticize me
I wouldn't do that to you
That's not how I want to be
Hey hey

Yeah
So take it easy
Take it easy
Take it easy
Let me do my thing

You don't own me
And you don't owe me
So please don't assume
What you cannot know
You don't know me, no
But I bet you wish you did
So take it easy
And let me do my thing

Take it easy
Take it easy
Take it easy
Take it easy
Let me do my thing
