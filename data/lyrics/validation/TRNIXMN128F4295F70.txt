[Verse 1]
Each time on my leaving home
I run back to my mothers arms
One last hold and then its over

[Verse 2]
Watching me, you know I cry
You wave a kiss to say goodbye
Feel the sky fall down upon me

[Chorus]
All I am
A child with promises
All I have
Are miles full of promises of home

[Verse 3]
If only I could stay with you
My train moves on, youre gone from view
Now I must wait until its over

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
All I am
A child with promises
All I have
Are miles full of promises of home

[Verse 4]
Days will pass, your words to me
It seems so long, eternity
But I must wait until its over
