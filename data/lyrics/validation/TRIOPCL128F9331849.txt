Don't leave me with this empty swing
Don't leave me here alone
I see that you'll come back to me
But yet don't even know

There is no way to father you
Live no clear-cut road
All your wonderings come back to me
So hurry, please come home

Dont leave me with this empty swing
Don't leave us here alone
My world's lost on this mystery
So hurry, please come home
