[Verse 1]
You're so happy now
Burning the candle at both ends
Your self loving soothes
And softens the blows you've invented

[Hook]
Breathe in deep
And cleanse away our sins
And we'll pray that there's no God
To punish us and make a fuss

[Verse 2]
Cracks healing up
Future soul forgive this mess
You waste twenty years
And wind up alone demented

[Hook]
Breathe in deep
And cleanse away our sins
And we'll pray that there's no God
To punish us and make a fuss

Breathe in deep
And cleanse away our sins
And we'll pray that there's no God
To punish us and make a fuss
