I know, you know, we know
I could never live without you

I guess you knew the score
When you walked out the door
Without saying goodbye
I think you're so unkind
If you leave me behind
Without giving a reason why

Now I can only imagine how
Our love should be
I'm filled with so emotion
I can't let go ... I won't let go

I know ...
Loving you is outta sight
You know ...
I'm not giving up without a fight
We know ...
Everything will be allright
I could never live without you

(Never live without you)

Everything you said was true
Never ever stopped loving you
Ever played your silly games
I can't get enough
Can't live without your love
I hope that you feel the same

If you could only imagine how
Our love should be
You'd feel so much emotion
I can't let go ... I won't let go

I know, you know, we know
I could never live without you ...
