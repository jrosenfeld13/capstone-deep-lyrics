Verse:
Stand here naked before you
Tear me apart
Playing games only children play
Hide and seek as I hide away
Don't want to stand here too long

Chorus:
Missing you somewhere down the line
Thinking names, are you thinking mine
Wearing life out like a race against time
Missing you somewhere down the line
Thinking names, do you even remember mine
Do you remember mine

Verse:
Look at me like every man
Sex in eyes, body with hands
Broken toys, broken homes
Wind me up, let me go

Chorus:
Missing you somewhere down the line
Thinking names, are you thinking mine
Wearing life out like a race against time
Missing you somewhere down the line
Thinking names, do you even remember mine
Do you remember mine

Bridge:
(musical)

Chorus:
Missing you somewhere down the line
Thinking names, are you thinking mine
Wearing life out like a race against time
Missing you somewhere down the line
Thinking names, do you even remember mine
Do you remember mine

Outro:
Missing you somewhere down the line
