We have two bags of grass
Seventy-five pellets of mescaline
Five sheets of high powered blotter acid
A salt shaker half full of cocaine

A whole galaxy of multi colored uppers, downers
Screamers, laughers
Also a quart of tequila, quart of rum
Case of beer, pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls

But once you get locked into a serious drug collection
Not that we need it at all for the trip
The tendency is to push it as far as you can

When the truth is found to be lies
And all the joy within you dies

When the truth is found to be lies
And all the joy within you dies

Don't you want - don't don't you want want
Don't you want - don't you want want
Don't you want - don't don't you want want
Don't you want - don't you want want
Don't don't want - don't you want want
Don't you want - don't you want want

Don't you want somebody to love
Don't you need somebody to love
Wouldn't you love somebody to love?
You better find somebody to love

Don't you want - don't you want want
Don't you want - don't you want want
Don't you want - don't don't you want want
Don't you want - don't you want want

Don't you want somebody to love
Don't you need somebody to love
Wouldn't you love somebody to love?
You better find somebody to love

Don't you want somebody to love
Don't you need somebody to love
Wouldn't you love somebody to love?
You better find somebody to love
