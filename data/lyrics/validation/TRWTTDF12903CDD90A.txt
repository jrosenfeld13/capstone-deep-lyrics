Daddy, won't you tell me
Everything about the heart?
Where it stops and where it starts
And where to let it go
Won't you tell me
So that I will know?

For it has loved a girl
And it has loved a boy
It has been set fire
And it has been destroyed
But still I hear it beating
Like that song you used to sing me all the time

I just want to know
If love is real

Is it high or is it low?
Is it fast or is it slow?
Or is it never-ending
Forever spinning like a wheel?

So, daddy, won't you tell me
Everything about the heart?
Where it stops and where it starts
And where to let it go
Won't you tell me
So that I will know?
