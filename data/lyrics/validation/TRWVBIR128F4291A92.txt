Compelled to eternal hate, censure of the mob, submit to them
Pressured from the outside, prevailing herd mentality, fearing deviation
Traumatized, retreat and submit, habitual failure, they no longer attempt
Resist all efforts at change, practice the routine

Fake courage to impress the other sheep
All cowards in their own pointless, twisted fate

Constant friction, voicings of new converts, don't know shit
Arbitrary changes visit ownership upon me

Do I look like I need you to rearrange my realm?
Drift through the motions of your predetermined course
Escape the dreary confines of your present circle
Solve your internal conflict, mend your own life

Follow useless trends, fucking with my mind, indignant lies that I reject
I care less and less for your weak opinion, pretension, pomposity
Reinforce your fear, admonishment of fools, path of least resistance
Bottomless mass of simpletons

Uncover your own future, ignore the losers words
Endure the pessimism, projections of the timid
Escape the dreary confines of your present circle
Solve your infernal conflict, before your demise

Reinforce your fear, admonishment of fools, path of least resistance
I care less and less for your weak opinion, pretension, pomposity
You're not qualified to deliver me, realize, drop your crusade
Nothing will prevent the ends I have chosen

Agonizing reapprisal, long ago I came unto my own
Discard the worthless bullshit, comprehend the revelations beyond
Hypocrites eating shit, choking on the spewings they never lived by
Estimations of lesser men, self-fulfilled to their dead ends
