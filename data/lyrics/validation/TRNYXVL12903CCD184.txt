I understand just how you feel
Your love for me, why not be mine?
It's over now but it was grand
I understand, I understand

If you ever change your mind
Come back to me and you will find
Me waiting there, at your command
I understand, I understand

I miss you so, please believe me when I tell you
I just can't stand to see you go
You know

If you ever change your mind
Come back to me and you will find
Me waiting there at your command
I understand, I understand

SPOKEN:
"I understand just how you feel. Let bygones be bygones. But always
Remember I love
You, I love you, I love you."

(We'll sip a cup of wine, my dear, for Auld Lang Syne)
I understand
