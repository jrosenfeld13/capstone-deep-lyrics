I ain't gone 'n' give up on love. Love ain't gone 'n' give up on me
I ain't gone 'n' give up on love. Love ain't gone 'n' give up on me
Every tear that I've cried only washed away the fear inside
Now I, I ain't gone 'n' give up on love

Every beat of my heart pounds with joy, not pain
Every beat of my heart beats with joy and not in vain
An although these painful memories only brought me to my knees
I was just given' up on love

Little Johnny Taylor told us long ago
What about the midnight cryin'? Whoa, the cheatin' and the lyin'?
What about the price that will oh, surely be paid?
Those that give up on on love, love will have it day
I ain't givin' up on love

I ain't gone 'n' give up on love. Love ain't gone 'n' give up on me
I ain't gone 'n' give up on love. Love ain't gone 'n' give up on me
Every time I cry, love just won't let me be, won't set me free
