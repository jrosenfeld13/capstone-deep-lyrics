I could have read
A poem called
Ozymandias
To her instead

I lived for the moment
It was a futile
Gesture anyway
I was here
And she was here

And being broad
Of minds and hips
We did the only
Thing possible

I guess I shouldn't have strangled her to death
But I had to go to work
And she had laced my coffee with acid

Normally I wouldn't have minded
But I'm allergic to sulphuric acid
Besides she had acne
And if you've got acne
Well, I apologise for disliking it instensely
But it's understandable
That ugly people have got complexes
I mean, it seems to me
That ugly people don't have a chance

It's only the children
Or the fucking wealthy
Who turn out to be good looking

An ugly fart
Attracts a good looking chick
If he's got money

An ugly fart
Attracts a good looking chick
If he's got money

An ugly fart
Attracts a good looking chick
If he's got money

It's different for Jews somehow
I'd like to see
A passionate
Film between
The two ugliest
People in the world
When I say ugly
I don't mean rough looking
I mean hideous

Don't tell me that
Aesthetics are
Subjective, you
Know all the truth
When you see it
Whatever it is

Muscle
Power, muscle
Power, muscle
Power, muscle
Power
