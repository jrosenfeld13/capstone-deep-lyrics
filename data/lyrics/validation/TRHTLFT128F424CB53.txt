Show time get on stage
Wearing shoes too high for me
Don't need them to be a lady
And kick some ass barefoot tonight

Shout!

Got my finger on the trigger
I start to SHOUT in the microphone
Plug it in my batfuzz pedal
To kick some ass barefoot tonight

Foot switch operation I am proud to be a modern girl
Who's not ashamed in guitar shops
Walking down the streets with a leppard raincoat
No mercy for your ears I am riding free 1,2,3,4
I am ready to kick some ass barefoot tonight

Shout! (x3)
