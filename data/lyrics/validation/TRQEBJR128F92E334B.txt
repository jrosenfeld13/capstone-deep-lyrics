[Verse 1]
She never mentions the word "addiction"
In certain company
Yes, she'll tell you she's an orphan
After you meet her family

[Verse 2]
She paints her eyes as black as night now
Pulls those shades down tight
Yeah, she gives a smile when the pain come
The pain gonna make everything alright

[Chorus]
Says she talks to angels
They call her out by her name
Oh yeah, she talks to angels
Says they call her out by her name

[Verse 3]
She keeps a lock of hair in her pocket
She wears a cross around her neck
Yes, the hair is from a little boy
And the cross is someone she has not met
Not yet

[Chorus - Variation]
Says she talks to angels
Says they all know her name
Oh yeah, she talks to angels
Says they call her out by her name

[Bridge]
She don't know no lover
None that I ever seen
Yeah, to her that ain't nothin'
But to me, it means
Means everything

[Verse 2]
She paints her eyes as black as night now
Pulls those shades down tight
Yeah, she gives a smile when the pain come
The pain gonna make everything alright

[Chorus - Variation]
She talks to angels
Says they call her out by her name
Oh yeah, heah, angels
Call her out by her name

[Outro]
Oh, ooh, oh, oh, angels
They call her out by her name
Oh, oh, oh, she talks to angels
They call her out
Yeah, ee, eah, eah, eah
Call her out
Don't you know that they
Call her out by her name?
