Yesterday's face
Is not the one I choose to see
Nor is the face
Of someone who gets much too close to me

I've got this place of my own
Where I can go when I feel I'm coming down
We'll do our best to ensure
You'll feel secure if you come

Love is the thing you crave
But it lies asleep inside of all your heads
Please, why don't you live a bit today?
For tomorrow you may find that you are dead

I've got this place of my own
Where I can go when I feel I'm coming down
We'll do our best to ensure
You'll feel secure if you come
