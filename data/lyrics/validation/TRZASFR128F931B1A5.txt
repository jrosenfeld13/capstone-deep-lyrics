You have made great planes
To span the skies
Gave sight to the blind
With other men's eyes
Even made submarines stay submerged for weeks
But it don't make sense
You can't make peace

You take one man's heart
Make another man live
Even go up to the moon
And you come back thrilled
You can crush any country in a matter of weeks
But it don't make sense
You can't make peace

No, it don't make sense
I said it don't make sense
No, it don't make sense
You can't make peace

You can make a transfusion
That can save a life
Even change the darkness
Into broad daylight
You make the deaf man hear
And the dumb man speak

But it don't make sense
You can't make peace
No, It don't make sense
I said it don't make sense
Yeah, no, it don't make sense
No, you can't make peace
You can't make peace
No, You can't make peace
