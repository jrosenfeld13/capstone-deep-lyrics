OK yo
I wake up late every morning
Managers calling I'm still yawning
Get up wake up hair and make-ups
Waiting for you don't be stalling
This performance is important
I don't think I can put my all in
Hold on I was drunk last night
Now it's all kicking in and I don't feel right
Gave my number to a breh who wasn't my type
Now my phone's on silent I'm being polite
Now private callers get no love from me
Just let me be

[Hook:]
Oh my gosh my days are getting longer
There's no turning back cause I'm working the 9 to 5
To keep my contract did I say 9 I meant 1:30
I'm no early birdy I'm lazy that's all that I can say
So make sure you heard me
And there's no turning back cause I'm working a 9 to 5

So you gotta...do...sum...ite... for...channel...u
Channel who sorry who I'm altered for snooze
Oh! Channel U the ones that made me huge
Like Katie Price's boobs
Whoops I'm being rude
Where's my Red Bull and my sandwich I need food
I can't handle this
I'm getting pissed like pampers throwing a tantrum
"Action"
Nah I'd actually rather catch my z's and count sheep in my sleep
Let's not wake her up she actually looks quite sweet

[Hook]

I couldn't be bothered to say much here
So oh dear
Huh where am I man..?
This... ain't good... what's going on?!

So my label have changed my image
I'm a pink lipstick chick called dipstick
This ain't on my wishlist
Oh shit I'm in FHM posing in a bikini
Next to a Lamborghini
Next stop the theme tune for Tweenies
I'm presenting C-beebies
[Pukes] Have you seen me?
Never again, am I drinking lambrini?
"It's alright, Sov it's-it's a dream... just wake up!"

[Hook]
