Jive talkin', you're telling me lies
Jive talkin', you wear a disguise
Jive talkin', so misunderstood
Jive talkin', you're really no good

Oh my child
You'll never know just what you mean to me
Oh my child, you got so much
You're gonna take away my energy with all your

Jive talkin', you're telling me lies
Good lovin' still gets in my eyes
Nobody believes what you say
It's just your jive talkin' that gets in the way

Oh my love
You're so good, treating me so cruel
There you go with all your fancy lies
Leavin' me looking like a dumb struck fool

Jive talkin', you're telling me lies
Jive talkin', you wear a disguise
Jive talkin', so misunderstood
Jive talkin', you really no good

Love talkin' is all very fine
Jive talkin' just isn't a crime
And if there's somebody you'll love till you die
Then all that jive talking' just gets in your eye

Jive talkin', you're telling me lies
Jive talkin', you wear a disguise
Jive talkin', so misunderstood
Jive talkin', you really, really, really no good

Love talkin' is all very fine
Jive talkin' just isn't a crime
And if there's somebody you'll love till you die
Then all that jive talking just gets in your eye

Jive talkin', jive talkin'
Jive talkin', jive talkin'
Jive talkin', jive talkin'
