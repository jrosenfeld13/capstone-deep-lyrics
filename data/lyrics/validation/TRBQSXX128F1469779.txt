[Verse 1]
I was such a lucky man
Before I turned the tables
You were everything to me
Now I'm like a fallen angel

[Chorus]
Made a promise to myself
I would love nobody else
But I don't know what came over me
No, I don't know what came over me
I was such a fool
All I ever cared about was you
Always you, always you

[Verse 2]
It was only for a night
A moment in madness
But I've paid a heavy price
For these endless days of sadness

[Chorus]
Made a promise to myself
That I wouldn't love nobody else
But I don't know what came over me
No, I don't know what came over me
I was such a fool
All I ever cared about was you
Always you, always you
Made a promise to myself
I would love nobody else
But I don't know what came over me
No, I don't know what came over me
But I don't know what came over me
No, I don't know what came over me
But I don't know what came over me
No, I don't know what came over me
I don't know what came over me
