Where is your shelter when the roof falls in
What will you drink when the well dries up on you
Who clots the blood when the cut sets in
If a man can't talk, how can he sing

What use is getting if you can't give back
Who'll keep you warm if the sun won't shine on you
Where is your home, on the rock or the sand
Who do you serve, money and man

Diamonds on your nails, pearls around your toes
Make-up on your pillow, who will ever know, now

You don't want to look like you
You don't want to look like you

Chorus : mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the fairest of them all

Who made the child in the depths of the womb
Who'll bring you back when the earth has covered you
Show me a man who doesn't reap what he sows
If you can't trust friends, who are your foes

Diamonds on your nails, pearls around your toes
Make-up on your pillow, who will ever know, now
Plastic on your face, your body's not your own, now
To satisfy their eyes, you give away your soul

Chorus
