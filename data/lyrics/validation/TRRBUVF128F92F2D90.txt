[Chorus]
Somewhere between now and forever
I'll see you again
Maybe somewhere by the sea
Where we both love to be
I'll see you again

[Verse 1]
I can see your (?) and maybe
(?) through the darkest days
I close my eyes and softly whisper maybe
As I'm drawing near
The smile that's on your face, oh

[Chorus]
Somewhere between now and forever
I'll see you again
Even on a crowded screen
You stand out just to me
I'll see you again

[Verse 2]
There is never (?)
Till it's you and I (?)
Something I believe will keep our love tight
Like the (?)
Holding heart to heart, oh-oo-oh

[harmonica solo]

[Verse 3]
Make believe is the only way to find it
(?) open up your eyes
(?) leave this love behind me
Some may come and go
But you always don't

[Chorus]
Somewhere between now and forever
I'll see you again
Even on a crowded screen
You stand out just to me
I'll see you a-
I'll see you again
I'll see you again
