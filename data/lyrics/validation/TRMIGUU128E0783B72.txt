Beautiful things it seems to be
Go on all around me
I'm so blind, I can't see
What's going on behind me

I'm so glad you found me
I'm so glad you found me

I'm so glad you found me
I'm so glad you found me

Back of my mind starts to feel
Are these things really real?

I'm so glad you found me
I'm so glad you found me
I'm so glad you found me
I'm so glad you found me

If things aren't real and it's all a game
Least I know I got your name
I'll find the book that's full of hearts
Call you up, we'll go dance

Beautiful things it seems to be
Go on all around me

I'm so glad you found me
I'm so glad you found me
I'm so glad you found me
I'm so glad you found me

I'm so glad you found me
I'm so glad you found me
