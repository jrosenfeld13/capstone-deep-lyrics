Vulture
Down
Down

Losing my head to Hollywood
My liver to London
My youth to Tokyo
Still on with the show

On
And on
And on
On

It's a
Hard
Lesson
But let me learn...

And the big wheels turn, turn
All your forest fires burn
And all my dead meat yearns
For the vulture's return

Take this
D-d-d-d-d-d-dead meat
My
D-d-d-d-d-d-dead meat
Your
D-d-d-d-d-d-dead meat
My
D-d-d-d-d-d-dead meat

Coming down
Vulture
Coming down
Down
Down
Down

Down in Santa Monica
Suicide motel
One date with the devil
(Satan)
Seven days in hell
But mother don't worry
I said the boy is doing fine
Home in a hurry
I'll be sane with good time

T-t-t-t-t-t-time, time

Hard
Lessons
Let me learn

And the big wheels turn, turn
And all your forest fires burn
And all my dead meat yearns
For the vulture's return

Take my
D-d-d-d-d-d-dead meat
My
D-d-d-d-d-d-dead meat
Your
D-d-d-d-d-d-dead meat
Your
D-d-d-d-d-d-dead meat

Come on down
Dead meat
Vulture
