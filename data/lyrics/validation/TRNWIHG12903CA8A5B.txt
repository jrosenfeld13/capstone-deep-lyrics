She's hungry, hungry for life
Every bound and ban cuts like a knife
She's willing to break down the walls
When the night-time falls
Blue moonlight, she's wide awake
Every breath of the dark makes her shake
In silence she's slipping away on a moonlight's ray

Hot night, there's loving and spite
In the lanes and in the alleys, darkness and light
Hot night, the good and bad's so close together

The Beauty and the Beast, saints and demons--kisses and bites
The Beauty and the Beast in the dead of the night

He's longing, longing to stray
Leaving back all the yesterday's clay
Right down where the streets have no names
The winds were never tamed
Together they're taking to flight
Hand in hand through the maze of the night
Don't follow the Will-o'-the-wisp in the shadow's mist

Hot night, there's loving. . 

The Beauty and the Beast. .
