The night is falling like an angel on your
Memory
And we are well acquainted
We are sworn enemies
And the lonely beating of my heart tonight
Is only one more thing I gotta fight
Well I think about you baby
Days of heaven that we had
Then I get to thinkingmaybe
-Maybe too much thinking's bad
Well my mind takes no prisoners
-pities no one
Spares not even me 'til the harm is done
Here I go again
The night just walked in
In walks the night
In walks my fantasy
Darkness all around me
And I'm dying for the light
Reach down for a little strength deep
Inside

Well I know I love my freedom
But lonely feelings come and go
And night time is a season
Feel the cold wind blow
And I toss and I turn and I walk the floor
I don't wanna cry - don't wanna cry no more
Here I go again
The night just walked in
In walks the night
In walks my fantasy
Darkness all around me
And I'm dying for the light
Reach down for a little strength deep
Inside

I reach down for my sanity
If only these eyes could see through all
The emptiness I found
Around me
In walks the night
I can almost feel you in the darkness all
Around
Still I'm waiting for the break of day
Waiting for a miracle
A dream that won't wander away
Well my mind takes no prisoners
-pities no one
It spares not even me 'til the harm is done
Here I go again
The night just walked in
In walks the night
In walks my fantasy
Darkness all around me
And I'm dying for the light
Reach down for a little strength deep
Inside

I reach down for my sanity
If only these eyes could see through all
The emptiness I found
Around me
In walks the night
The night just walked in
In walks the night
The night just walked in
Maybe I'll be all right
In walks the night
