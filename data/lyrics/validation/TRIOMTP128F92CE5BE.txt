There's an old man on a high chair
In the name of Jesus Christ
Keep on preachin' that religion
Though the past has often lied
Sold his faith but could not face anyone
Sold us hope but couldn't change what's been done

Way down, way down deep in his eyes
How long, how long can he conceal the lies?

Flew his jet to De Janeiro
To deliver peace of mind
Kneels to kiss the burnin' pavement
All his hypocrites behind
Tries to fake his way as God's only son
Full of shit! you just can't fool everyone

Way down, way down deep in his eyes
How long, how long can he conceal the lies?

Tries to fake his way as God's only son
Full of shit! you just can't fool everyone

Way down, way down deep in his eyes
How long, how long can he conceal the lies?
Way down, way down
