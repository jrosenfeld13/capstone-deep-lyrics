I once believed, all girls are nice
But listen to me, take my advice

You've gotta get yourself on the right track
'cus finding a good girl, Boy
Is like finding.. A needle in a haystack
.. .. A needle in a haystack

Those girls are sly, slick and shy
Don't ever let them get ya with their starry eyes
They tell that their love is true
And then they walk all over you

You should know these things it's a natural fact

You better look before you leap
Still water sometimes turns very deep
Feel your love is sure
But your just their past-time lover

Know these things off the bat
