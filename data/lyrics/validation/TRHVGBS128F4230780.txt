Sleep, come on and take me
Until my love comes home
Sleep, don't you forsake me
'Cause I'm so all alone

All the time I'm by my own somehow
My heart keeps bumping me
Can't you see I'm sad and lonesome
For the want of company

Sleep, come on and take me
Until my love comes home

Old men sleep
For every lover you paint a new tomorrow
Old men sleep
And you discover a way to chase away my sorrows
Please don't wait until tomorrow

Sleep, listen to me why don't you come and take me
'Til my love comes home
Sleep, listen to me, now please don't forsake me
I'm so all alone

All the time I'm by my own some
My heart's pumping me
Can't you see I'm sad and lonesome
For the want of company, lordy, lord

Sleep, listen to me why don't you come and take me
'Til my love comes home, alone
Comes alone, till my love comes home
