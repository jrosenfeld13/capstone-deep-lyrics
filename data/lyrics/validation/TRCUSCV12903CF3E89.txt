Unrelenting, their endevour to rule lives
Teaching you an artificial truth
That you will grieve no more
That you will die no more

Narrow minded mercenaries
Slave traders, soul collectors
Send a promise of destruction
To those who will not kneel
Derision of the upright ones;
As fear devours all doubts

But there are so many things
I hold beyond their reach
The doom you promised me may come
I'm not afraid

You cannot save me
I am the counterweight
No need to save me;
For I am the counterweight
And I will grieve no more
I will die no more
