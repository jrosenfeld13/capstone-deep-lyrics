If you want love just let me know [cause I can tell you on]
My envelope's about to explode
I got what you need and you know [so don't ever have a doubt]
If you want love just let me know
Cos I can turn you on [just turn me on, turn me on, turn me on]
Tell you how [just turn me on, turn me on, turn me on] [2X]
Tell you how

Baby when you're gone I don't know what to do
Cause ain't no other lady make me feel brand new
And there's no other woman that I want to pursue
If you want my loving I'ma give it to you
Let our bodies collide and me enter you
Meet me online, take a little preview
Sex on the net, got my girl in the mood
And you know our connection is long overdue

[Chorus]

Cause I got my needs and I need them right now
And I ain't too proud to show it
See I've been on the road with my fuckin' hormones and you'd be straight over knowin it
After the show we'll go to the limo baby we can still rock n roll it
You loving [your loving] [2X]
I really need your loving, need it
If you want some loving send a request
I'ma send it over to you next day, U.P.S
That's ultimate pleasure, special delivery
I'm down for whatever, you got me feeling fevery
If you want love just let me know [cause I can tell you how]
My envelope's about to explode [you know what I'm talking bout]
I got what you need and you know [so I'll never have a doubt]
If you want love just let me know
Cause I can turn you on [just turn me on, turn me on, turn me on]
Tell you how [just turn me on, turn me on, turn me on] [2X]
Tell you how

If you want my loving, I'ma give it to you
If you need it right now, I'ma send it on through
Fed-Ex, overnight loving
Sex, me and you rubbin'
A telegram of a different kind
I'ma taste your body and seduce your mind
Lick your envelope from behind
Put my stamp on and then it's mine

[Chorus]

Love me baby, love me love me permanently permanently
You know I love to love you love you permanently permanently
You got me feeling for your love you got me yearning [yearning]
You turn me on and turn me off so keep on turning
Till my turn you know that I'll be learning
New love tricks to make you go [ooh]
My magic stick can make you go [ooh]
I love you from the bottom to the top and make you go [oh!]
So if you want some loving send a request
I'ma send it over to you next day you U.P.s
That's ultimate pleasure, special delivery
I'm down for whatever, I'm even coming nightly
Knocking on your door, you know what the business for
That's sex in your living room, the bathroom floor
When I leave you be like 'give me more' but remember
W-I-double-L spells pleasure

If you want love just let me know [cause I can tell you how]
My envelope's about to explode [you know what I'm talking bout]
I got what you need and you know [so I'll never have a doubt]
If you want love just let me know
So I can turn you on
If you want just let me know [cause I can tell you how]
My envelope's about to explode [oh!]
I got what you need and you know [so I'll never have a doubt]
If you want love just let me know
So I can turn you on [just turn me on, turn me on, turn me on]
I can turn you on [just turn me on, turn me on, turn me on] [2X]
Turn you on
