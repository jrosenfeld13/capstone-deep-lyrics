[Verse]
Thanks thanks a lot I got a broken heart that's all I've got
You made me cry now I cried a lot I lost your love baby thanks a lot
You told our friend as I was passing by that you're not sorry that you made me cry
You said I deserve just what I got well if that's how you feel honey thanks a lot
Thanks thanks a lot
You wanted a fool and I played the part now all I've got is a broken heart
We loved a little and laughed a lot then you were gone honey thanks a lot

[Outro]
Thanks thanks a lot
