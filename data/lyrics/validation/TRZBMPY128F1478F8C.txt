Whether she be priest or police, the first one on the scene is a thief
I won't believe a word she says
She won't have your smile
We can hang for a while
But I know I'll miss you just the same

E-ro-tic conversation is no substitute for what you do
And what I lose when I'm without you
It's easy to hold back temptation
My night's getting longer, getting stronger and stronger
Baby don't you worry!

So I returned her gifts, and upset the evening's happiness
But it's best...
I don't wanna lead her on, or give her the wrong idea
I'd much rather be here, with my tears...
Waiting on your return

E-ro-tic conversation is no substitute for what you do
And what I lose when I'm without you
It's easy to hold back temptation
My night's getting longer, getting stronger and stronger
Baby don't you worry!

Girl there's no pressure, I'm happy when we're together
I'll be here waiting for you
I'm in no hurry
Girl, now don't you worry
I'll be here waiting for you

If she's sweeter than usual I'll say a polite no
Then I'll turn to go home
Satisfy me in every way
You're a different girl everyday
You suit my tastes
And you're all I need to know

E-ro-tic conversation is no substitute for what you do
And what I lose when I'm without you
It's easy to hold back temptation
My night's getting longer, getting stronger and stronger
Baby don't you worry!

Girl there's no pressure, I'm happy when we're together
I'll be here waiting for you (waiting for you)
I'm in no hurry
Girl, now don't you worry
I'll be here waiting for you

Girl there's no pressure, I'm happy when we're together
I'll be here waiting for you (waiting for you)
I'm in no hurry
Girl, now don't you worry
I'll be here waiting for you

I'm in no rush
You're worth is more than "two in the bush"
I'll be here waiting for you

Girl there's no pressure, I'm happy when we're together
I'll be here waiting for you (waiting for you)
I'll be here waiting for you .... yeah
