Roll over baby
The time has come
To make a little bit more room

I've hung around you
It's gettin tough
I think I 'm gonna break down soon

I remenber
Crying in the park
It was getting dark
Suddenly I looked up
You were my sky

So sleep darlin'
Why don't you pretend we were just a dream
It's cool baby
It dosen't matter anyway
I'm so sorry
We got to the station a little too late
It's such a shame
We just missed the train

Be quiet angel
Don't make a sound
Save it for a rainy day
Oh can't you see me
Thru the clouds
Trying hard to find my way

Do you remember
Drinking all that wine
We were feeling fine
Though we couldn't walk a line
We were all right

So sleep darlin'
Why don't you pretend we were just a dream
It's cool baby
It dosen't matter anyway
I'm so sorry
We got to the station a little late
It's such a shame
We just missed the train
We just missed the train

Oh why'd that train just pass us by
Didn't anyone see we were stuck at the light
Or we would're made it on time

So sleep darlin'
Why don't you pretend we were just a dream
It's cool baby
I'm so sorry
We got to the station a little too late
It's such a shame
We just missed the train
We just missed the train

Shame shame we just missed the train
Shame shame we just missed the train
I've been roaming 'round this great big world
Trying to find a pretty girl
All dressed up in clothes that didn't fit me

I've been roaming 'round this great big world
Have you seen my pretty girl
If you see her please tell her I miss her
