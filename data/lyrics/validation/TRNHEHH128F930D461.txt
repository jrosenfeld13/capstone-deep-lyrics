Just a lonely hunter
Always searching for another prey
Or another rival
He's a cold assassin in a modern
Time of senseless hate
It's all about survival

Vicious and cold, with a
Passion to rule and control
In for the kill, with a hunger to
Take your mind and soul
Don't let go

Get it out, reign of the warrior
Get it out, it's the reign of the warrior
Get it out, the fight of the warrior
Get it out, it's the fight of the warrior

Enter in to battle, more casualities
Lie just ahead
'cause you fight 'til the end
Malicious contentment, on the
Front line of no man's land
Hunt you down again
