[Verse]
Oh I am an anti-Christ
And I am an anarchist
Don't know what I want
But I know how to get it
I want to destroy the passers by

[Chorus]
Because I, I want to be, anarchy

[Verse 2]
In this fucking city
Anarchy for the USA
It's coming sometime, maybe
Give the wrong time
Stop a traffic line
Your future dream is a shopping scheme
Because I wanna be, anarchy
Well it's the only way to be
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
There are many ways to get what you want I use the best, well I use the rest
Well I use the enemy
I use anarchy

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Fuck the rat race man
Is this the PMRC
Or is this the DEA
Or is this the CIA
I thought it was the U.S.A
Or just another country
Some other fucking country

[Chorus]
And I, want to be, anarchy

[Verse 4]
Oh I want to fucking hear it man
And I, want to be, anarchy
Let's say it again boys
And I, want to be, anarchy
Fucking destroy
