[Verse 1]
The wheat waving next to you is healthy and so fine
As is dinner with your loved ones every day
But your routine is changeless through the decades of your life
Green pastures, open spaces, holy ways

[Chorus]
And it must look pretty appealing, the acres of lights
The crowded festive nights
And the millions of others just like you
Yeah it must look pretty appealing
This other world of sin
We keep dreaming of what other people do

[Verse 2]
The person sitting next to you is dismal and deranged
On the bus ride home from work to end your day
And the food on your table is more plastic than protein
And your intellect depends on your TV
And it must look pretty appealing
The pastoral retreat, the folks on old main street
And the few pleasant people just like you

[Chorus]
Yeah it must look pretty appealing
The simple way of life
We keep dreaming of what other people do
But we never do what other people do
You're too scared of other people not like you
