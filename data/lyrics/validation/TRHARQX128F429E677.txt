Whispering voices in the night
Speaking to me of the mystery of love
In the twilight of my mind
I can see the shadows of death

Tears in may - show my pain
And wash my love away -love away
Tears in may - tell me why
Was our dream born to die
All in vain -tears in may
Tears in may
Tears in may

The secret world of our dreams
Is still waiting in my soul
And when the moon is shining through the clouds
My love will take control

Why

Tears in may - show my pain
And wash my love away -love away
Tears in may - tell me why
Was our dream born to die
All in vain -tears in may
Tears in may
Tears in may

And I hear cassandra calling
When the stars of fate are falling
I'm so lonely and I cry those tears
Tears in may
Tears in may

Tears in may - show my pain
And wash my love away -love away
Tears in may - tell me why
Was our dream born to die
All in vain -tears in may
Tears in may
Tears in may
