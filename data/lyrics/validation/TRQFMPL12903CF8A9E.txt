Why did you come if you can't stay forever?
How could you leave me all alone on this earth?
Who was I before you?
I can't remember
Why couldn't I have been the one to leave here first?
I love you, but goodbye
I love you, but goodbye
No words of wisdom could make me feel better
Lately I'm having hard days and I curse the night
Maybe I'll fly far away and try to forget her
Maybe I'll stay right here where I am and get on with my life
She said," I love you but goodbye."
I love you, but goodbye
A bird with clipped wings can still sing but no longer fly
What are we here for?
Who makes the decision?
For every beginning there must come an end
I want to thank you honey for that all you've given
I want to thank you
I want to thank you for being my friend
I love you, but goodbye
I love you, but goodbye
I love you, but goodbye
I love you, but goodbye
