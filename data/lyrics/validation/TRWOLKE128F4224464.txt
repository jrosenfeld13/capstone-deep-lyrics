You know You know You know
I'm back I'm back back back back, I'm back again bitch
Global Kiusico

[Verse 1]
Dropping my mixtape, delete your existence
I'm out of the system, my brain needs a fix in
They call me Roxana, I'm Hannah Montana
I'm sipping my whiskey, Cubana en la cama
I'm playing the villain, the good bitch is boring
I don't fight for a man, I'll text them and come here
My verse is fire, got y'all tight, bitch you lose your turn
Time to go, you're unemployed, maybe you will not return

My name will be on the charts, people knowing who I am
Be the best on the game, that's why I'm working in here
Talking shit, dropping names, that's everything that you got?
Cause I got ammo, I got barz and my uzi on my arms
My good ass, like my barz, and they're way up to your bars
You're so dumb, leave you numb, in the battle for the crown
Now honestly, I'm the best, and I'm flexing on myself
Cause finally, the self-esteem found the way up to me, sis

[Chorus]
If you want this bitch, boy you betta pay me
Glossy on my lips, boy you betta taste me
Margarita in my hand, boy you betta grab me
I just wanna pay my tax, boy you betta get it
I'm all about shmoney
I want to buy a Rolly
He says he wanna own me
Boy you HA, get off me
I'm in my paradise
I'm in the paradise
I need you to find my price
I'm a million dollar doll, bitch

Boy, I'm a million dollar doll, bitch (x2)

[Verse 2]
When I was a kid, my biggest dream was to be rich
I wanted to be a star, photos with my 4 Benz
People screaming my name, as harder as they can
Nobody believes the monster I became
But now that I'm here, I want to be more than that
It's not that I'm mad, I just wanna change that
It's because I'm really sick, of basic bitches think they lit
With my name on their mouth, cause they would never caught a lick
She came from the nothing, but she turned into something
Inspirational shit, just call me Onika or Belcalis
Money comes, money goes, be rich it's now the life goals
Fuck the elite, fuck the tags, fuck the gender shit and roles
Be a man, keep it rude, you should lookin a dude
No one cares, how you feel, just pretend everything is cool
Fuck that shit, just be you, no ones tells what to do
Keep you cute, live your youth, your amazing and me too
Bitches talk shit cuz' you're cool, that's why they envy your mood
Found myself on the art, music saves me from my shit
I don't get why y'all mad, you're being jealous or a fan?
But if you wanna fuck with me, you better give me a hit bitch

Boy, I'm a million dollar doll, bitch
