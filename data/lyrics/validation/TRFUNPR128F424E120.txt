[Intro]
Hello, hello, hello

[Verse 1]
I'm waking up at the start of the end of the world
But its feeling just like every other morning before
Now I wonder what my life is going to mean if it's gone
The cars are moving like a half a mile an hour at that
I started staring at the passengers who're waving goodbye
Can you tell me what was ever really special about me all this time?

[Chorus]
But I believe the world is burning to the ground
Oh well, I guess we're gonna find out
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come
Well I, believe, it all, is coming to an end
Oh well, I guess, we're gonna pretend
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come

[Verse 2]
I think it turned ten o'clock but I don't really know
Then I can't remember caring for an hour or so
Started crying and I couldn't stop myself
I started running but there's no where to run to
I sat down on the street and took a look at myself
Said where you going man you know the world is headed for hell
Say your goodbyes if you've got someone you can say goodbye to

[Chorus]
I believe the world is burning to the ground
Oh well, I guess we're gonna find out
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come
Well I, believe, it all, is coming to an end
Oh well, I guess, we're gonna pretend
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come

[Verse 3]
It's gone, gone, baby its all gone
There is no one on the corner and there's no one at home
It was cool, cool, it was just all cool
Now it's over for me, and it's over for you
Well its gone, gone, baby its all gone
There is no one on the corner and there's no one at home
Well it was cool, cool, it was just all cool
Now it's over for me, and it's over for you

[Chorus]
I believe the world is burning to the ground
Oh well, I guess we're gonna find out
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come
Well I, believe, it all, is coming to an end
Oh well, I guess, we're gonna pretend
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come

[Outro]
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come
Let's see how far we've come
