Motor bikin'
Motor bikin'
Motor bikin'
Motor cyclin'

Moving on the queen's highway lookin' like a streak of lightnin'
If you gotta go, go, gotta go motor bike ridin'

Listen to me and I'll tell you no lie
Too fast to live, too young to die
I bought a new machine today and say
It take your breath away

Motor bikin'
Motor bikin'
Motor bikin'
Motor cyclin'

Moving on the queen's highway lookin' like a streak of lightnin'

Baby, won't you come with me?
I'll take you where you want to be

Well, here I am again and I'm dressed in black
I got my baby, she's right in the back
We're doin' 'bout 95
Whew, so good to be alive

Motor bikin'
Motor bikin'
Motor cyclin'

Moving on the queen's highway lookin' like a streak of lightnin'
If you gotta go, go, gotta go motor bike ridin'

Motor bikin'
We go motor bikin'
Motor bikin'
Whew, we're motor cyclin'

Moving on the queen's highway lookin' like a streak of lightnin'
If you gotta go, go, gotta go motor bike ridin'

Motor bikin'
We go motor bikin'
