Slut! Shut the fuck up and get off my dick
Wasted! That's what the hell your are
A piece of pussy and that makes me sick
Money is all that matters in your worthless life
Right now you get everything back
You broke my heart, so I'll break your neck
With my hands, I fucking crack the bone
Oh, I enjoy your pain
Watch you bleed to death
Just can't wait till you take your last breath
You played your games with me
Love made me blind now I can see
You wanted my money but I'm not rich
Whatever you got, you deserve it bitch
Dead! Your body smells like rotten fish
Painful was your demise and cash has been your last wish
Yeah, I will keep your body in my house
Fuck you whenever I want
Lick up your asshole and your cunt!
With my tongue I taste the juice
Ain't got nothing to loose
I take the shit on your face
Your existence was a disgrace
I gotta give you what the fuck you need
Cash! Here you are, I fill your body with it
Open up you buttcheeks and drop the coins in your ass
Sweet little sister, now you're my piggy bank
Some day you're gonna be full
A money-pregnant slag
And heavy like a tank
My horny little piggy bank
