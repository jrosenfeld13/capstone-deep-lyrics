Good night
Baby
Sleep tight
Here with me
We can lay in the bed
You and me
And i won't go away
Or leave you alone
Sweetie pie
Baby
Sleep tight
Here with me
And in the morning
We'll open our eyes
And look at each other
And sunny skies
And when you think
Of getting high
I'll think of nice things
To make you smile
'Cause when you drink
It makes me cry
And when you get high
