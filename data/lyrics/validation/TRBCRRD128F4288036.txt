I see you 
And i'm waiting to make my move
But i'm scared, and i know
That u have better things to do

I touch your hand, and i'm wearing my heart
On my sleeve, its cleche, i know, but baby its the price we pay
To get the things that we've wanted and get the things
We've left behind, what you wanted what you needed
What you've always dreamt about

Dont take another step, dont breath another breathe
Unless your coming back to me

CHORUS:
I'm trusting you and i'm taking the long way home
I'm leaving, and its not because of you
Will you just hold me tight and never let me go
I know this whole things wrong but baby were invincible

If i could take these words and fill them up with air
I'd fly you too the stars so we can disapear
If i could take your heart and keep it close to me
I swear it will not brake, i swear it will not bleed
And i believe just anything you say

If you'd tell me to get lost id ask how far away
And now its getting late and i can't keep my eyes open
But my hearts open for you

CHORUS:(x4)
I'm trusting you and i'm taking the long way home
I'm leaving, and its not because of you
Will you just hold me tight and never let me go
I know this whole things wrong but baby were invincible
