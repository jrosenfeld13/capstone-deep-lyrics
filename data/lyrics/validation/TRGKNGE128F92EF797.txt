[Verse 1]
Line of force from heaven
A tear in a stranger's eye
Then it goes forever
Where all things never die
People look whenever
These places have been won
Minds just go on breathing
When these moments have begun

[Hook]
It's so far away, and it's closing in
It's so far away, it seems to draw me in

[Verse 2]
Taken from the killing ground
By an all providing hand
With no sense or reason
Making the final demands
Taking good advantage of
All the things I'm told
I wash my hands in innocence
When you start taking hold

[Hook]
