Baby baby baby got to say what's on my mind
Tomorrow you are leaving and I will be left behind
Nothing only changing you're doing what you got to do
One moment between us
One moment to cling to you

Let the darkness fall
Woah
Hear your body call
(Hear your body call)

Let the hours crawl
Woah
You can have it all
(Hear your body call)

Won't you stay with me tonight
Won't you stay with me tonight

Baby baby baby all the lights are going on
(You just come in closer now just come in closer)

We can can be together only till the night has gone
(We should be together for the final time for ever)

Somewhere in the future will you smile when you think of me
(Somewhere in the future some for the future)

Somewhere in your heart will you hold a tender memory
(Some for the future always for the future)

Let the darkness fall
Woah
Hear your body call
(Hear your body call)

Let the hours crawl
Woah
You can have it all
(Hear your body call)

Won't you stay with me tonight
Won't you stay with me tonight
Won't you stay with me tonight
Won't you stay with me tonight
Tonight

Won't you stay with me tonight
Won't you stay with me tonight
Tonight

Won't you stay with me tonight
Tonight

Woah
So let the darkness fall
Woah
Hear your body call
Let the hours crawl
Woah
You can have it all

Let the darkness fall
Woah
Hear your body call
Let the hours craw
