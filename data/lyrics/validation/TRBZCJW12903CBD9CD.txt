In the blue of evening
When you appear close to me, dear one
There in the dusk we'll share a dream reverie

In the blue of evening
While crickets call and stars are falling
There 'neath the midnight sky you'll come to me

In the shadows of the night we'll stand
I'll touch your hand and then
Softly as your lovely eyes entreat
Our lips will meet again

In the blue of evening
Night winds above whispering, "I love you"
There will we find romance in the blue of evening
