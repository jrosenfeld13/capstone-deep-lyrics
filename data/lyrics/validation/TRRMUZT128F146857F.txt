She knows I"d do anything she wants me to
The love she finds is deeper than the ocean
She knows I"d do anything she wants me to
A river of dew, warmer than the dawning

Surrender-tie the cover to the ground
Surrender-tie the cover to the ground
But don"t turn around and walk away again
Don"t turn around and walk away again

He knows I"d say anything he wants to hear
Bright and clear calls the voice of lovers
He knows I"d do anything he wants me to
Like ruby rain I wash away the pain

Surrender-tie the cover to the ground
Surrender-tie the cover to the ground
But don"t turn around and walk away again
Don"t turn me down and walk away again
