Livin' on free food tickets
Water in your milk from a hole in the roof
Where the rain come through
What can you do, uh-huh

Tears from your little sister
Cryin' because she doesn't have a dress without a patch
For the party tonight
But she knows she'll get by 'cause she's

Livin' with the love of the common people
Smile from the heart of the family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can, as she can

It's a good thing you don't have bus fares
It'll fall through the hole in your pocket
And you'll lose it on the stone on the ground
Gotta walk into town to find a job

Tryin' to keep your hands warm
When the hole in your shoe lets the snow come through
And it chills you to the bone
So now you'd better go home, where it's warm, and you'll be

Livin' with the love of the common people
Smile from the heart of the family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you as much as she can, as she can

Livin' on a dream ain't easy but the closer the knit
The tighter the fit and the chill stay away
Keep the man's strive, the family pride
You know that faith is your foundation
With a whole lotta love and a warm conversation

But don't forget to turn
Makin' you strong where you belong and you're

Livin' with the love of the common people
Smile from the heart of the family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can, as she can
