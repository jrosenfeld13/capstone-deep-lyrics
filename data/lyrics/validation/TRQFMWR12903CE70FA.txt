Just shake it, you can break it, you can hang it on the wall
Out the window, catch it 'fore it roll
You can shake it, you can break it, you can hang it on the wall
Out the window, catch it 'fore it falls
My jelly, my roll, sweet mama, don't let it fall

Everybody have a jelly roll like mine, I lives in town
I, ain't got no brown, I, an' I want it now
My jelly, my roll, sweet mama, don't let it fall

You can snatch it, you can grab it, you can break it, you can twist it
Any way that I love to get it
I, had my right mind since I, I blowed this town
My jelly, my roll, sweet mama, don't ya let it fall

Jus' shake it, you can break it, you can hang it on the wall
It out the window, catch it 'fore it falls
You can break it, you can hang it on the wall
It out the window, catch it 'fore it...
My jelly, my roll, sweet mama, don't let it fall

I ain't got nobody here but me and myself
I, stay blue all the time, aw, when the sun goes down
My jelly, my roll, sweet mama, don't let it fall

You can shake it, you can break it, you can hang it on the wall
It out the window, catch it 'fore it fall
You can break it, you can hang it on the wall
Out the window, catch...
My jelly, my roll, sweet mama, don't let it fall

You can snatch it, you can grab it, you can break it, you can twist it
Any way that I love to get it
I, had my right mind, I, be worried sometime
'Bout a jelly, my roll, sweet mama, don't let it fall

Just shake it, you can break it, you can hang it on the wall
It out the window, catch it 'fore it falls
You can break it, you can hang it on the wall
It out the window, catch it 'fore it falls
My jelly, my roll, sweet mama, don't let it fall

I know I been to town, I, I walked around
I, start leavin' town, I, I fool around
My jelly, my roll, sweet mama, don't let it fall

Just shake it, you can break it, you can hang it on the wall
It out the window, catch it 'fore it falls
You can break it, you can hang it on the wall
It out the window, catch it 'fore it...
My jelly, my roll, sweet mama, don't let it fall

Jus' shake it, you can break it, you can hang it on the wall
It out the window, catch it 'fore it...
My jelly, my roll, sweet mama, don't let it...
