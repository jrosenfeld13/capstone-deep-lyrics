Falling in a dark hole that never ends
Because I lost a friend
Missing you is like a road that never seems
To get you to your destination
Ive been looking but I cant find you
Where did you go  What was my mistake
Ive been trying retrace my steps
To get back to you for my lifes sake
Its been so long since I heard from you
So long  what did I do
Its been so long since I felt your touch
So long  you availeth much
If you drop a needle in a haystack
Is it really worth trying to find
Picking through each straw because I never thought
I would be so lost without you
Everyday I long for a chance to be with you again
For with failing I cry that Im sorry for pushing you away
I would do anything to rekindle our being
Im lost without your presence
Its been so long  Im wondering will I feel you again
