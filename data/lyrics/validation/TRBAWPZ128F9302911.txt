Why don't you kiss and tell?

They say learn from your mistakes
But I can't learn anymore
They say learn from your mistakes
But I can't learn anymore
That thought just makes me sick
Am I so disposable?
That thought just makes me sick
Am I so disposable?

Why don't you kiss and tell?

I thought I'd got it right for once
It's like some sad ritual
I thought I'd got it right for once
It's like some sad ritual
But friends speak your conscience
Hey I'm just another girl
But friends speak your conscience
Hey I'm just another girl

Why don't you kiss and tell?
