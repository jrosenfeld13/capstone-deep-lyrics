[Verse]
Rock and roller steam, pulp and paper shack
Wrinkles on my head, people on my back
All going nowhere, never coming back
Got to be rich to be poor
Keeps me satisfied
Keeps me satisfied
Spending money for the time I buy
Keeps me satisfied
Man back from the dead, weasels in the pack
Approval from the pope to stretch them on the rack
All going nowhere, never coming back
Got to be rich to be poor
Keeps me satisfied
