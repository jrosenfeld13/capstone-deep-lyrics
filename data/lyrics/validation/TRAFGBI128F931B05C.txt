I was born in the city
Oh, but I was born in the country
My mother said I didn't have a name
But she would have to love me just the same

I was looking for something
I was looking for something
Well, I was looking for a place to go
Someplace that maybe I could call my own

Just let it go, just let it go cause it's gone
You're pointing fingers, you're pointing fingers
Just let it go, just let it go, let it die
You didn't know it was the very first time

It's getting hard to remember
It's getting hard to remember
That all the warning signs must be ignored
We've got to have the things we can't afford

Just let it go, just let it go cause it's gone
You're pointing fingers, you're pointing fingers
Just let it go, just let it go, let it die
You didn't know it was the very first time

Oh, it was the first time
Oh, it was the first time
Oh, it was the first time
Oh, it was the first time

We were killing the neighbors
And we were laughing in churches
I'm very sorry but I disagree
I don't know what has gotten into me

Just let it go, just let it go cause it's gone
You're pointing fingers, you're pointing fingers
Just let it go, just let it go, let it die
You didn't know it was the very first time

Oh, it was the first time
Oh, it was the first time
Oh, it was the first time
Oh, it was the first time
