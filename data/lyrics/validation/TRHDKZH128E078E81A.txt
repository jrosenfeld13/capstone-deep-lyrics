[Verse 1]
Yeah
This could be it, I think I'm in love
It's love this time
It just seems to fit, I think I'm in love
This love is mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see you with me when I'm older
All my lonely nights are finally over
You took the weight of the world off my shoulders (the world just goes away)

[Chorus]
Oh, when you kiss me (when you kiss me)
I know you miss me (I know you miss me)
And when you're with me
The world just goes away
The way you hold me (the way you kiss me)
The way you show me (I know you miss me)
That you adore me
Oh, when you kiss me
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
You are the one, I think I'm in love
Life has begun (I think I'm in love)

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see the two of us together
I know I'm gonna be with you forever
Love couldn't be any better (the world just goes away)

[Chorus]
Oh, when you kiss me (when you kiss me)
I know you miss me (I know you miss me)
And when you're with me
The world just goes away
The way you hold me (the way you kiss me)
The way you show me (I know you miss me)
That you adore me
Oh, when you kiss me
Oh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see you with me when I'm older
All my lonely nights are finally over
You took the weight of the world off my shoulders (the world just goes away)

[Chorus]
When you kiss me (when you kiss me)
I know you miss me (I know you miss me)
And when you're with me
The world just goes away
The way you hold me (the way you kiss me)
The way you show me (I know you miss me)
That you adore me
The world just goes away (when you kiss me)
When you kiss me (I know you miss me)
I know you miss me (And when you're with me)

[Outro]
Oh, the world just goes away
When you kiss me
