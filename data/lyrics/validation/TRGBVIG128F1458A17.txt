Burning embers of the second death
Will come in the night
Priests and kings, the alpha and omega
Poison bites

False prophets and deceivers
Swing from the trees
Now, dawn the age of birds
Drunk with blood
Like lepers with disease

Lord of the sky, Mercury the guide
Lord of the underworld
I swear the sacred rite
I will crucify, slay them with their tribe
Hear my war cry

They'll find no sanctuary
Hidden in their ancestral halls
Let loose the knot that binds
The spirit and the flesh, let it fall
For only courage and heroism
Linger after death
So hold fast thy sword, rejecting pain
Feel the dragon's breath

Lord of the sky, Mercury the guide
Lord of the underworld
I swear the sacred rite
I will crucify, slay them with their tribe
Hear my war cry
I've sworn the oath, I've sworn the oath
I've sworn the oath

Lord of the sky, Mercury the guide
Lord of the underworld
I swear the sacred rite
I will crucify, slay them with their tribe
Hear my war cry

Burning embers of the second death
Will come in the night
Priests and kings, the alpha and omega
Poison bites

False prophets and deceivers
Swing from the trees
Now, dawn the age of birds
Drunk with blood
Like lepers with disease

Lord of the sky, Mercury the guide
Lord of the underworld
I swear the sacred rite
I will crucify, slay them with their tribe
Hear my war cry
I've sworn the oath, I've sworn the oath
I've sworn the oath
