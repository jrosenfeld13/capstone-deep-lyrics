You are afraid to say it's true reality escapes you
Time after time you try to prove to yourself you're right
But your ways are not the way how long do you have to play
This game before you see I'm right it's not just a game it's a fight
You're afraid to hold out your hand don't be afraid to take a stand

Chorus

It's a shame to be ashamed
To be ashamed of the One that we should glorify

You are afraid of the price you'll pay will you be strong or walk away
You're reasons are runnin' thin all that's left to do is give in
Inside this generation of sin there's only one place to begin
And it's at the starting line or you will be left behind

You say it's hard to believe in something you can't see
A choice you make today will affect you eternally
Now I'm here to stay
And I've made a change
And I won't go away
From the One who gave life
