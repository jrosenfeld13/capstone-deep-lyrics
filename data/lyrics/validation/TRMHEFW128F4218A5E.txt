Where did you go Karen Silkwood?
What was the price on your head?
Why do our heroes all vanish?
Why are our heroes all dead?

In the dark of night I hear the vultures scream
And I just can't seem to wake up from the dream

How many armies must yet perish?
How many young people die?
Why are we breathing dioxin
While it rains acid rain from the sky?
