Looking for the right kind
Live free or die

I want to see your smile through a pay phone
Season has changed
I want to see you in it
Lights that shine are caustic without you

[Chorus]
When we're all passed over
The rhythm of the river, it will remain
And it will ... and it will ... remain

Nicotine and waiting
Just wanted to keep it alive
You turn and before you know it
We're just threading this needle for life
A brighter way is what you've proved
Anesthetize is what you do

Someday we'll be together
Father south than the train line
The delta mud will be there
We're just living this way because we've known no other

[Chorus]

Looking for the right kind
Live free or die
