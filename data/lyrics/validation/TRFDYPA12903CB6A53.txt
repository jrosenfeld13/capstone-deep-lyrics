This life is mine
I want no direction
And I like to trash
To do it here and there

Need no other choice
To live is my result
Don't like those creepers
Around me in this world

Life's destroyer - life's destroyer
Life's destroyer - life's destroyer
Life's destroyer - life's destroyer
Life's destroyer - life's destroyer

Never back out of my life
So you don't believe
Parents see the result
Cause I'm standing here

Life's destroyer - life's destroyer
Life's destroyer - life's destroyer
Life's destroyer - life's destroyer
Life's destroyer - life's destroyer

All day long you work to pay for your deadstone
I suppose that you hate yourself
