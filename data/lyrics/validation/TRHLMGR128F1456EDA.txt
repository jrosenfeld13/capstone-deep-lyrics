I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you

I was beat, incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue
But you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
Shiny and new

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
Next to mine

Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you
'Cause only love can last

You're so fine and you're mine
Make me strong, yeah you make me bold
Oh your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out
What was scared and cold

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat
Next to mine

Wow hoo oh oh ho oh
Wow hoo oh oh ho oh
Aah!
Wow hoo oh oh ho

You're so fine and you're mine
I'll be yours till the end of time
'Cause you make me feel
Yeah, you make me feel
I've nothin' to hide

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats
Next to mine

Like a virgin
Ooh ooh ooh hoo hoo
Like a virgin

Feels so good inside
When you hold me..
And your heart beats
And you love me...

Oh ho ooh oh ho
Oh oh oh ho ho
Oh ho ho

Ooh baby
Yeah

Can't you hear my heart beat
For the very first time?
