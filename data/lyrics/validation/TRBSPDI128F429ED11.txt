Pushing his pen across the page
To nowhere in particular
He's dreaming of his holidays
His stomach's perpendicular

He tried to keep his keep fit interest
But the summer's nearly here
The only exercise he really gets is when he's lifting beer

Our man is feeling rather wonderful
Lying somewhere comfortable
His feet up in the air...oh
Our man is sipping drinks incredible
Eating all that's edible
He hasn't got a care

His day's spent pushing money round
But he's not got a lot of his own
His wife lives on the other side of town
And all his kids are fully grown
Would the enormous coporation
Lose much more than it's pride?
If he was to take an early pension
With a little on the side

Our man is feeling rather wonderful
Lying somewhere comfortable
A-bathing on his yacht...oh
Our man is drinking drinks exotica
Dreaming of Uttoxeter
I think not

He's fanning himself with fivers
And drinking blue lagoons
He's watching erotic scuba divers
While the band plays calypso tunes

Our man is feeling rather wonderful
Lying somewhere comfortable
His feet up in the air...oh
And he smiles because there's no
Extradition there...oh
Our man is feeling rather wonderful
