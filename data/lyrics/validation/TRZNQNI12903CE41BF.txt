I don't need a break from you
I won't reach out for your hand
You offer me cool, but I reject it
I won't wear your brand

I've got enough rules of my own
Pushing in on me
I don't need any more
Rules that keep me tied up

You offer me your acceptance
You think that's important to me
Well I don't like anybody
That's got all the answers for me

I've got enough rules of my own
Pushing in on me
I don't need any more
Rules that keep me tied up

Well maybe now you're getting what you expected
That may change
But I can change my mind anytime
And I just might turn it on you

I've got enough rules of my own
Pushing in on me
I don't need any more
Rules that keep me tied up

Ah!
