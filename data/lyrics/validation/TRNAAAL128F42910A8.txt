I know my love by his way of walking
And I know my love by his way of talking
And I know my love dressed in a suit of blue
And if my love leaves me, what will I do?
And still she cried, "I love him the best
And a troubled mind sure can know no rest"
And still she cried, "Bonny boys are few
And if my love leaves me, what will I do?"
There is a dance house in Maradyke
And there my true love goes every night
He takes a strange girl upon his knee
Well, now don't you think that that vexes me?
And still she cried, "I love him the best
And a troubled mind sure can know no rest"
And still she cried, "Bonny boys are few
And if my love leaves me, what will I do?"
If my love knew I can wash and wring
If my love knew I can sew and spin
I'd make a coat of the finest kind
But the want of money sure leaves me behind
And still she cried, "I love him the best
And a troubled mind sure can know no rest"
And still she cried, "Bonny boys are few
And if my love leaves me, what will I do?"
I know my love is an errant rover
I know he'll wander the wild world over
In dear old Ireland he'll no longer tarry
An American girl, he's sure to marry
And still she cried, "I love him the best
And a troubled mind sure can know no rest"
And still she cried, "Bonny boys are few
And if my love leaves me, what will I do?"
And still she cried, "I love him the best
And a troubled mind sure can know no rest"
And still she cried, "Bonny boys are few
And if my love leaves me, what will I do?"
What will I do?
