As for the time we lost
And as for the words
I fear I never said enough
I watched as the night moved fast
And years simply changed
And endings let a calm begin

Try to remember this
As your mind races away
Try to remember this
We were taught to be amazed
And now we're on our own

Come with me, and carry on
I always hoped we'd grow this strong
To find a place, to stop and be alone

Looking out on the park, last night
The snow in the street lamps
Fell for hours but left no trace
I turned down the lights
I turned down the blinds
And waited as I tried to sleep

Try to remember this
When your world soon comes undone
Try to remember this
With each setting of the sun
We forget some things we own
We forget some things we own

Come with me, and carry on
We'll drive an hour just north of town
Where you and I can stop and be alone
Where you can I can stop

I opened the letter
You left on the table
"Please come to find me, when you're able"

Remember this
As your mind races away
Try to remember this
We were always so amazed
Remember this
When your world soon comes undone
Try to remember this
With each setting of the sun

We forget some things we own
We forget some things we own

Remember this
Remember this
Remember this

We forget some things we own
We forget some things we own
