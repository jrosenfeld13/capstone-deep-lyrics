Wait and watch she's defrosting
Wets in trickles of sunshine orange skin
Slowly come the gong of her voice
Flopping belly seallike onto my aching back

She'll make you shiver make my fleshiver

Waiting's over she's singing
Surfs the shaking roof of my mouth
I am the moose I'll howl at the flakiest moon

She'll make you shiver make my fleshiver

She guides a weight into my spine
Melts the darkest day thaws a man out of my back
Licks and quivers until...
