[Verse 1]
Think of all the luck you got
Know that it's not for naught
You were beaming once before
But it's not like that anymore
Count all the moods you've known

[Chorus]
What is this down side
That you speak of

[Verse 2]
Round up the friends you got
Know that they're not for naught
You were willing once before
But it's not like that anymore
The time that you would never trade
Is equal to the effort made
You were simple once before
But it's not like that anymore

[Chorus]
What is this down side
That you speak of
What is this feeling
You're so sure of
What is this down side
That you speak of
What is this feeling
You're so sure of
