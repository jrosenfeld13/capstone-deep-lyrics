One, two, three

Well, I don't want to hear
The latest gossip in this town
And I refuse to let the things
I can't change bring me down
Whatever is lovely, holy and pure
Well, I will think on these things

Give me the sunshine
A blue night
A blanket of shining stars
Well, tell me the Good News
Now, sing Hallelujah
Christ in me
That's Good News indeed
Good News indeed

Well, I have had more
Than my share of petty quarreling
And now I long to join
In peaceful, hopeful harmonies
Whatever is good, honest and true
Well, I will think on these things

Give me the sunshine
A blue night
A blanket of shining stars
Well, tell me the Good News
Now, sing Hallelujah
Christ in me

Give me the sunshine
Now open the curtains
And let me see
Well, tell me the Good News
And I'll sing Hallelujah
Christ in me
That's Good News indeed

Whatever is lovely, holy and pure
Well, I will think on these things

Give me the sunshine
A blue night
A blanket of shining stars
Well, tell me the Good News
Now, sing Hallelujah
Christ in me
That's Good News indeed
Good News indeed
Oh, that's Good News indeed
Good News

Give me a little Good News
Give me Good News
