Gimme more
Gimme more of your shiny side
If human is devine
They talk a lot
You can keep the ocean
On your left or take
And early morning dip
Into this very moment
That alone is free to go
Translate it into action
Paying lipservice to satisfaction
Smile and see sister of free
Down at your knee
Whisper whisper who dares
Between the lines beyond your cloud
Well there's a child that's trying to get out
When it will it'll turn to you
It'll turn to you
Sister of free
Down at your knee
