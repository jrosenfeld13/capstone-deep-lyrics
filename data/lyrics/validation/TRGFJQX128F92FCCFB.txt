He got a wrinkled up rock 'n' roll T-shirt on and a beanbag for a couch
He can hold his beer but he can't hold a job and he creeps your little sister out
When he flexes his muscle and he makes that Hooters girl on his right arm dance
Well he wants to be a star play air guitar someday in a heavy metal band

[Chorus] That's a red flag, that's a bad sign
That's a good fit somethin' ain't right
Hold on there, I wouldn't go there
If I was you

I ain't sayin' I'm a knowitall
But something sure should have tipped you off
When he said, "Hey baby can I bum a couple bucks for gas,"
Yeah that's a red flag

You say this one's different cause he bought you flowers, a dozen fr'every day of the week
He drives by your house every hour on the hour and writes you poetry
It's all about destiny, how it's meant to be, how it's written in the stars that shine
And he's talkin' love and kids and stuff, and you've only been out one time

[Repeat Chorus w/new ending]
Now I ain't sayin' I'm a knowitall
But something sure should have tipped you off
When he called just to say "I called how come you didn't call me back?"
Yeah that's a red flag

[bridge]
Mama's boy and jocks and flirts, weirdos in speedos and plain old jerks
And hare-brained half-baked honky tonk clowns with half a dozen girls in half a dozen towns

[Repeat Chorus]
Now I ain't sayin' I'm a knowitall
But something sure should have tipped you off
When some guys says "My ex-old lady was a nag,"
Yeah that's a red flag
