She said, "When it all came tumbling down
I was frozen. I was ripped to the core
I thought about everything I had learned
And how I didn't want to learn nothing anymore."

Ain't that just like you?
Shining all the lights on yourself
Ain't that just like you
Firing all your guns at once until you fade away

She said, "When all my leaders started lying to me
I was shattered. It just didn't make sense
I started drinking and my life got worse
And I knew it was more than coincidence." (ch)

"I can't breathe but I can't leave
I'm a slave to the grave that I dug for myself
I want to go where the lights aren't shining on me
I'll crawl in a hole and fade away."

Part Two

Now you say the end is near
Well, I've been hearing that for years
The shaking followed by the tears
Anger and then shifting gears
And if the world must end
There's no need to pretend
I want to love you like there's no tomorrow

Oh, my sweet catastrophe
Is this the way it has to be
Locked away by house arrest
