Back again
Right where I started
And I can't find anything
To take me out of your
Shallow waters
That I've been drowning in so long
Who's here to take me out

Time to face another day
But will it be just like the last one
It's up to me to make the difference this time
I'll face another day
And it won't be just like the last

You talk loud without words
I've had enough manipulation

I found my way out
I'm not a slave to your game

Taking back what's mine
