Keeping afloat after midnight
Using your favorite smile
Keeping it flowing round midnight
You're gonna drift for a while
Going too fast after midnight
You won't be able to choose
Water's too high around midnight
You know you're going to loose
Although you swear
That you will never ever ever loose control
I've seen you slipping baby, sliding
But I've never seen you fall
Keeping your cool after midnight
Leaving with faces you know
Keeping it cool after midnight
Busy but taking it slow
Seeing your eyes after midnight
Makes me forget what I've lost
Hearing your voice around midnight
Gratefully paying the cost
And though you think
That you will never, ever, ever
Loose your grip
I've seen you tripping, baby
Sliding but I've never seen you slip
So easy to let go
Much easier I know
So easy to look back
So easy to keep track
I loved you for a while
I loved your weary smile
So easy to keep track
So easy to look back
