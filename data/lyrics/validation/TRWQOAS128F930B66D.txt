[Verse 1]
Abductors, they come at night
They come at night and they infiltrate you
They paralyze and they mentally rape you
Expressionless they disintegrate you
The probe your soul and desecrate you

[Chorus 1]
Abductors, will bleed your mind
Abductors, cutting inside
They come for you in the night

[Verse 2]
They strap you as someone's slain before you
And powerless begin to explore you
You scream in pain but they just ignore you
The bring machines and they drill and bore you
Abductors, cutting inside
Abductors, drinking your mind
No one believes that you
Were chosen from few
Defiled and abused
By alien rituals

[Chorus 2]
You wake in fright they are in your room
You better hope your memory fails you
A lower form of life to them
Just one more blood experiment

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 3]
They send you back and disorientate you
A lesser race they discriminate you
Whatever said will incriminate you
No one believes
The skeptics laugh and annihilate you
They dig you out and excavate you
Authority and even God forsakes you
No one believes
Hey, maybe I am just a liar
