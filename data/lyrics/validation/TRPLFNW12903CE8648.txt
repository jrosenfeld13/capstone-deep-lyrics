You my friend my special friend i give thanks to you my dear friend
I won't pretend and say till the end but take time now and say thank you
I never said i was the best friend i could be the friend that you need
But still i take the time to thank before it's too late
Take time now before a face in the crowd is what our friendships become
I thank you for the time we talked all night
And for the time you told me i'd be all right
Thank you for listening and hearing my side thank you for being my friend
Thank you for being alive
