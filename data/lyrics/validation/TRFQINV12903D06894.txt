Water was running; children were running
You were running out of time
Under the mountain, a golden fountain
Were you praying at the Lares Shrine?

Oh, all your cities lie in dust
Oh, all your cities lie in dust

We found you hiding, we found you lying
Choking on the dirt and sand
Your former glories and all the stories
Dragged and washed with eager hands

Oh, all your cities lie in dust
Oh, all your cities lie in dust
Oh, all your cities lie in dust
Oh, all your cities lie in dust

Oh, all your cities lie in dust
Oh, all your cities lie in dust
Oh, all your cities lie in dust
Oh, all your cities lie in dust
Oh, all your cities lie in dust
