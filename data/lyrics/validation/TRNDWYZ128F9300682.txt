See a flame in a town full of strangers
See a plane falling out of the blue
Every day when I'm chasing the dangers
I want to make love to you

See a fir in a street full of sadness
See a kid in the snow with no shoes
Every day when I'm chasing the madness
I want to make love to you
I just want to make love to you

I have to keep the picture everywhere I go
I keep it to myself so no one else will know
The world is crazy only thing I want to do
I want to make love to you

I have to keep the moment running through my head
I seem to feel your arms around me in the bed
The world is crazy only thing I want to do
I just want to make love to you

(I can't stand being without you, baby
'Cos you're the one that's got the feeling for me)

The people are reachin' for power
I see the soldiers erasin' what's true (yes I do)
Every day when I'm chain' the hours
I want to make love to you
I want to make love
