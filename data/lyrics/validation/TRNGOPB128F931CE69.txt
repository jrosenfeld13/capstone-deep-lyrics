I'm inside out, ohhh
It's the way you swore, that you didn't want more, then you always need me to stay for the morning

I'm inside out, ohhh
It's the way you swore, that you didn't want more, then you always need me to stay for the morning

Leaving you a message from my hell
The last that I expected was for my soul to sell
I took all your hits but there's something I missed 'cause you're turning my world inside out
One way or another it's better to leave me to fall

I'm inside out, ohhh
It's the way you swore, that you didn't want more, then you always need me to stay for the morning
I'm inside you, ohh
There's everything you know and everything I don't, everytime you need me to stay for the morning

Keeping you a secret from my friends
They can see that some thing's different but they can't quite tell
One moment I'm spinning the next one I'm flipping 'cause you can't decide what you want
What started so simple, is burning right out of control

I'm inside out, ohhh
It's the way you swore, that you didn't want more, then you always need me to stay for the morning
I'm inside you, ohh, there's everything you know and everything I don't, everytime you need me to stay for the morning

It's the way you move, it's the way you are, it's the way you need me to stay
It's the way you move, it's the way you need me to stay for the morning

I'm inside out, ohhh
It's the way you swore, that you didn't want more, then you always need me to stay for the morning
I'm inside you, ohh, there's everything you know and everything I don't, everytime you need me to stay
