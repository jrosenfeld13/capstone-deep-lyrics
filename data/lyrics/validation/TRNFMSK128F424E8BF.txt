I don't know what you've been through
I see it on you
I don't know what you've been through
Now how does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
Now how does it feel

You've always been just like a riddle
I find you so hard to figure out
I could just wonder 'till forever
Still there something I don't know about

I don't know what you've been through
I see it on you
I don't know what you've been through
Now how does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
Now how does it feel

Let me in it's now or never
No matter how I try to win
It never gets any better
And now I'm sittin' here again

I don't know what you've been through
I see it on you
I don't know what you've been through
Now how does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
Now how does it feel

Tell me now, tell me how
I need to know
Tell me now, tell me how
I need to know how it feels
How does it feel
How does it feel
Now how does it feel

Tell me now, tell me how
I need to know
Tell me now, tell me how
I need to know how it feels

I don't know what you've been through
I see it on you
I don't know what you've been through
Now how does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
Now how does it feel

Tell me now, tell me how
I need to know
Tell me now, tell me how
I need to know how it feels
How does it feel
How does it feel
Now how does it feel
