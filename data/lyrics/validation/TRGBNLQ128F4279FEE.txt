What are you goin' to do to make me hate me?
I can't see, how you can this time
A fistful of lies and a verbal decimation
It's so sad but baby, keep on tryin'
I got me no chains or fancy aspirations
I've still got a losing streak
I don't need praise or instant admiration, no, no, no
It takes more than you to make me weak
I wanna know
What are you goin' to do to stop me this time, baby?
You've been tryin' to funk around with my mind lately
You know, you know, kinda messin' around with my mind
You wanna mess round with my mind
Well, I'm gettin' so sick and tired of hearin' about it
Like I'm not the man and I don't exist
You wanna know about this and you wanna know things about me
What you're sayin' always has a vicious poison twist
Baby, why do you do it to me?
Tell me, why do you do it to me? Why do you do it?
You're messin' around with my mind
What are you goin' to do to stop me this time, baby?
What are you goin' to do? What are you goin' to do?
Now, tell me
What are you goin' to do to stop me this time, baby?
You've been tryin' to funk around with my mind lately
So what are you gonna do, yeah? What you gonna do?
What you gonna do to stop me this time, baby?
I know you can't stop me
You've been tryin' to mess around with my mind lately
You've been tryin' to mess around with my mind
What are you gonna do to stop me this time, baby?
You've been tryin' to mess around with my mind lately
You've been messin' with my mind, you do it all the time
You've been messin' with my mind, you know you do it all the time
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Well, I'm breakin' out, I'm breakin' out
I'm flying higher than a pig in space
And they've been so blind, they've been so blind, yeah
Now, I was born in '69 and I'm tellin' the world
But they don't wanna know about me, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I wanted just to do my thing
I wanted just to make my life
Have that swing and let it go, I feel so good
All they wanna do is just mess with my mind
I know that all they wanna do is mess around with my mind
All they want to do is mess with my head, yeah, yeah
What are you gonna do to stop me this time, baby?
What are you gonna do to stop me this time, baby?
