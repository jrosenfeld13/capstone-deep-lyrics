Just as you're waiting there, you sit up in your evil chair;
Looking down on me, well, you never really give a shit
I've been searching for you. I've stuck up for you
Too many times. Well I got my real answer
And now I am my only war
Each time I thought ahead, I had answers
You come again
Evil answers throw me back down in the hole
Just when I would think to pass
Nothings gonna give
But each time you walk on by
Do you really think I ?
It never really feels too good when I'm
Holding everything inside of me; now that you would
Well, I've been searching for ya; stuck up for you too many times
Well, I got my real answer. Now, I am my only war
Each time I thought ahead, I had answers
You come again;
Evil answers throw me back down in the hole
Just when I would think to pass;
Nothings gonna give
But each time you walk on by
Do you really think I watch?
Each time I thought ahead, I had answers;
You come again
Evil answers throw me back down in the hole
Just when I would think to pass;
Nothings gonna give
But each time you walk on by
Do you really think I...care?
