Once more I get burned
Kick out the closed gate
'Cos I'm ready to join the crowd
I'm ready to unlock the padlock on my mind

Twisted, torn, tension, tear
My will from my mind, reason from rhyme
And I can't decide which one to feed
Which one to fight

Once more I get scarred
Break through the brick wall
Just gather my thoughts and go
I'm ready to pick up the pieces of my life

I wanna be out of sight
I wanna be out of mind
I wanna be out of sight
I wanna be out of mind

I can't seem to judge
The distance between
My hands and feet
Quite literally

Walk slow into the vacuum
This is the end of everything
Welcome back to the black hole
Raise the shade up from your eyes

And I'll be out of sight
And I'll be out of mind
And I'll be out of sight
And I'll be out of mind

And I'll be out of sight
And I'll be out of mind
And I'll be out of sight
And I'll be out of mind

Once more I get burned
Kick out the closed gate
'Cos I'm ready to join the crowd
And I'm ready to unlock the padlock on my mind
