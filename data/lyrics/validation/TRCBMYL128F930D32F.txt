[Verse 1]
When I think about all the girls I'm with all the time
Yes I like to please their bodies but I feel like it's a waste of time
Can you tell me what is wrong
I'm supposed to love the fact that I never gave a girl my heart
If I told her I did I lied and instead I tore her's apart
Can you tell me how long cause

[Chorus]
Right now I just wanna be staring into your eyes
Right now I'm so lost but when I find you I'll be found
And I won't have to ask all these questions like can someone tell me where you are

[Verse 2]
What'll happen if i settle and just go along with what I have
Cause there's a difference between good and great
But good wasn't built to last
Can you tell me is this all for me

[Chorus]
Right now I just wanna be staring into your eyes
Right now I'm so lost but when I find you I'll be found
And I won't have to ask all these questions like can someone tell me where you are

[Bridge]
What would it take to be
In a love I know that's right for me
And I know that you don't even know me yet
But I believe that one day I'll be where you are
