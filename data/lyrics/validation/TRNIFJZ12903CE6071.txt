Give me what I want
And give it to me now!
Don't be such a holy cow
Everybody knows that
You can't make it happen

Give me what I want
And give it to me now!
Don't be such a greedy sow
Everybody knows that
You have never been down

Especially after
Never having been there

I'm the one who has
And I will tell you this
With a biblical kiss
I will eat you
Your folks
And your kids for breakfast

I'm the one who has
And I will tell you this
That I would never wish
Death upon you
Your cats
Or your throw cushions on Christmas

Especially after
Never having really
Done anything at all

You can't be the one
No you can't be the one
No you can't

Be the one
No you can't be the one
No you can't be
