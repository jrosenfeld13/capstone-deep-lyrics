You offer your assistance
But you won't accept my help
You draw your own conclusions
And there's room for little else

Your own participation's
Based on how much you can lose
I cannot help but feel
That this won't be of any use

Don't offer me your credit
'Cause I do not want the blame
Don't do me any favours
I don't want to play that game

I do not want to see myself
As someone that you saved
I'd rather be your adversary
Than to be your slave

'Cause every friendly gesture
Turns my stomach inside out
Don't do me any favours
I am better off without

Don't offer me your credit
'Cause I do not want the blame
Don't do me any favours
I don't want to know your name

But it's all right
Yes, it's all right
Yes, it's all right
Yes, it's all right
Yes, it's all right

Don't give me your credit
'Cause I do not want the blame
Don't do me any favours
I don't want to know your name

Don't do me any favours
Don't do me any favours
Don't do me any favours

But it's all right
Yes, it's all right
It's all right
Yes, it's all right
It's all right
Yes, it's all right
