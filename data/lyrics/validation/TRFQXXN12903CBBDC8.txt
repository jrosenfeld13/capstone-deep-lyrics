I'm sick, I can see it now
Clear as daylight
So fucking what
Keep your opinions and leave me alone

Paint it red, burn the bitch
Let her serve herself
The pain is real
It's all true I was there

Going insane's overrated
I was right all along
You're all the monsters - I am the normal one
So here I am and yes I'm fine
Fucking fabulous alright
And I'll make it out alive
No matter how

The medications knocks the edge right off and every step away
From feeling this
Is beauty in it's own right
The sidetracks and your skilled manipulation of my senses left me down
But I've been down before

Pigs are noble creatures
Compared to scum like you
But I'm certain there's one out there's more out there left to chew

The medication lost the edge right off and every step away
From feeling this
Is beauty in it's own right
The sidetracks and your skilled manipulations of my senses left me down
But I've been down before

Ain't nothing you could say
Ain't nothing you could do
Ain't nothing there at all for you

Suppose I could make you see
Would it make a change?
Well come inside and burn

The medication lost the edge right off and every step away
From feeling this
Is beauty in it's own right
The sidetracks and your skilled manipulations of my senses left me down
But I've been down before
