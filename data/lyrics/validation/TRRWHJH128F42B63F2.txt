The months go by
And I don't think of you
The signal is frail
An imprint of what you do

So I turn up the sound
And you are nowhere
I have learnt this to my cost
But I maintain in the slow lane
I maintain In the slow lane

The scent goes by
Still I smell of you
You say I cry
At the merest thought of you

So you let me down
To laugh at nothing
I have learnt this for myself
But I maintain in the slow lane
I maintain in the slow lane

So I turn up the sound
And you are nowhere
I have learnt this to my cost
But I maintain in the slow lane
I maintain in the slow lane

Turn down the sound
You are nowhere
You let me down
To laugh at nothing
I have learnt this to my cost
I have learnt this for myself
