I've tried so hard to say some words to you
I've bled so much and felt so blue
A part is moving on and losing touch
My road is getting longer and growing rough
I walk around some days I never found
I'm certain you've got spies below the ground
It's not good times I need
A promise to believe

And my mean so much
My mean so much

And when they say that I was in demand, and how I changed when I let go your hand
From where I'm sitting, it seems out of breath
Far above us, without any left
Well, this was one that finally stayed a while
And looking back, those hours made me smile
I've lived with this before
Yeah, I've lived with this and more

My mean so much
My mean so much
My mean so much
My mean so much

I've lived with this before
I've lived with this and more

My mean so much
My mean so much
My my my mean so much
