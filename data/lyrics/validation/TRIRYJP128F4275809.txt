The celebration is ending
And now no one will compare
I'll be searching for you in everyone
But you won't be there
No, you won't be there
No, you won't be there

The celebration has ended
And now no one will compare
I'll be searching for you in everyone
But you won't be there
No, you won't be there
No, you won't be there
