Apartment walls, halls are small
Government building site much too small
These tiny boxes won't let me out
These tiny boxes are so remote

It's a screaming mess
A television city dream
Your robot's eyes gleam
In my future dream
Yeah hey!

It's not fate or chance
It's the money in the bank
Burn their timber and gather their bricks
Drive 'em into the fire, the bloody dicks

It's a screaming mess
And I am the prisoner
(The prisoner, the prisoner)

Go!

It's not fate or chance
Kick somebody in the face
Burn their timber and gather their bricks
Drive 'em into the fire, the bloody dicks

It's a screaming mess
A television city dream
Your robot's eyes gleam
In my future dream
And I am the prisoner
(The prisoner, the prisoner)
Well I am the prisoner
(The prisoner, the prisoner)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

The prisoner!
