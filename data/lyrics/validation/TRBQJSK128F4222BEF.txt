(Welcome to the ball)
I should have seen it in your eyes
The feelings trapped inside
You kept it hidden oh so well
All the pain you must have felt
I tried to tell you on the phone yesterday
I wanna be there for you now
I'll be there
When love comes down
Alone no more
We're just strangers in the night
That drift away
Reach out, come on, babe
Won't you reach out, take my hand?
We'll never drift away again
Just like I tell you on the phone everyday
I wanna be there for you now
I'll be there
When love comes down
Alone no more
When love comes down
Don't ya' know that you're a part of me
And this you can't deny
'Cause when we kiss, we just can't hide
Just look in my eyes
Take me away
When love comes down
Don't run away, don't run away, don't run
We can go to the other side
When love comes down
Got to have your lovin', oh
When love comes down
I'll be there, you know I will
When love comes down
Got to have love, got to have love
Got to have your love baby
