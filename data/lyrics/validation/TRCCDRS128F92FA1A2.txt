All for the love we want
All for the love we need
Deep in the lonely heart
Winter holds the seed
Reach till you know how far
Trust till you know how true
Give till you know how much
Loves inside of you
For this we she'd our skin
Feel where each breath begins
Bleed as we pick the rose
Fall back with both eyes closed
All for the love we want
All for the love we want
For this we she'd our skin
Feel where each breath begins
Bleed as we pick the rose
Fall back with both eyes closed
All for the love we want
All for the love we want
All for the love we want
