You must believe me, brothers, for I have no need to lie
I jumped off the edge of this old world to see if I could fly
I fell down into the darkness like a stone dropped in the sea
And I landed upside down outside a door marked with a three

And I swear I heard the banshees reelin' just inside the door
And the staircase it was full of ghosts who lived there long before
And as I turned the key my life had changed for sure

There were drunks and punks and poets, there were gumboots and guitars
And the legendary stardust cowboy tracked me by radar
In the corner was a jester with his eyes all glowing red
When I asked him where I was well he just laughed at me and said

You're in the land of bedlam boy, in the state of anarchy
If the swallows do not get you then you'll have to deal with me
Then he licked my cheek and offered up some tea
And I fell on my knees!

And now I'm baking in this hot Alberta sun
Western wind is waving in the wheat
So much of me lives on
There at number three Roxburgh Street

You must believe me, brothers, for I have no need to lie
The drunks all went to college now the poets never try
The banshees have been silenced and the swallows left the nest
And then the jester's selling real estate and the punks all drive a desk

And I swear if you were there right now and standing in that door
You would hear the ghosts of banshees wheeling just like long before
And the melody would haunt you evermore
Down to your core!

And now I'm baking in this hot Alberta sun
Western wind is waving in the wheat
So much of me lives on
There at number three Roxburgh Street
