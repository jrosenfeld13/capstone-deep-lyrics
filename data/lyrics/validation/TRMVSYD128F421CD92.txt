[Verse 1]
Your neighbours were screaming
I don't have a key for downstairs
So I punched all the buzzers, hoping you wouldn't be there
And now my head's hurting
You say I always get my own way
But you were in the shower when I got there, I'd have wanted to stay, but I got nothing to say

[Bridge]
Cos you were so beautiful before today
But then I heard what you got to say...man that was ugly

[Chorus]
The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Frank's in there, I don't care
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Just take it
Take the box

Take the box

[Verse 2]
I came home this evening and nothing felt like how it should be
I feel like writing you a letter, but that's not me...you know me
Feel so fucking angry, don't wanna be reminded of you
But when I left my shit in your kitchen, I said goodbye to your bedroom
It smelled of you
Mr. False Pretence, you don't make sense
I just don't know you
But you make me cry, where's my kiss goodbye?
I think I love you!

[Chorus]
