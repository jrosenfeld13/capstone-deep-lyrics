Two a.m. in Austin that truck stop looks promising
But don't they all
That Silver Eagle's slowing down
Maybe there'll be time enough to call
I don't want to wake him but if I wait later then
I'll miss my chance
I just want to hear his voice
I've just got to know he understands
I send my love across the line
The road leads back to us
Until then I send my love across the line
I wish that I could be there to show him
That he is where I'd rather be
But for now these words along the wire
Will have to take the place of me
I wonder if we ever know
The reasons why we take the roads
That drive us on
When all that really matters
Are the ones we always leave behind at home
I send my love across the line
The road leads back to us
Until then I send my love across the line
The road leads back to us
Until then I send my love across the line
