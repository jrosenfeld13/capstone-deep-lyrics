There is a demon among us
Whose soul belongs in hell
Sent here to redeem us
She knows it all to well

He comes and goes, he comes and goes
She knows it all too well
But when all is said and done
The sun goes down
The sun goes down
The sun goes down
The sun goes down

She tries her best to leave him
But she is still captured by his spell
She knows now she must deceive him
He knows it all to well

She comes and goes, she comes and goes
He knows it all too well
But when all is said and done
The sun goes down
The sun goes down
The sun goes down
The sun goes down

She comes and goes, she comes and goes
He knows it all too well
But when all is said and done
The sun goes down
The sun goes down
The sun goes down
The sun goes down

The sun goes down
There is a demon within us
The sun goes down
She tries her best to deceive him
The sun goes down
