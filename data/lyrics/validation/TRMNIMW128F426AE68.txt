I try too hard
Persuasion never wins
So let me start again

And here it is
As plain as day
These words not mine but His
And this is what they say

Chorus:
My hands they made you
My breath I gave you
My son he saves you
If you want to, you can wear My name
My love unending
My truth unbending
I want you to wear My name

I'm just like you
Our sin, a cross, His son
As your friends we come

So here we are
Another verse, a different view
God as a Father
Us, His pursuit

(chorus)
Unending
Unbending
I want you

(chorus 2x)
One thing's for certain
I want you to wear my name
Wear my name...
