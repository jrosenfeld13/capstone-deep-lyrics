[Intro: Sporty & All]
Ah, say you'll be there
I'm giving you everything
All that joy can bring, this I swear

[Verse 1: Baby]
Last time that we had this conversation
I decided we should be friends, hey
But now we're going round in circles
Tell me, will this deja vu never end? Oh

[Verse 2: Scary]
Now you tell me that you've fallen in love
Well I never ever thought that would be, ay
This time you gotta take it easy
Throwing far too much emotions at me

[Pre-Chorus: Posh]
But any fool can see they're falling
I gotta make you understand

[Chorus: All, (Baby) & Scary]
I'm giving you everything
All that joy can bring, this I swear
(I'll give you everything)
And all that I want from you
Is a promise you will be there
(Say you will be there)
Ow, say you will be there
A-won't you sing it with me?

[Verse 3: Ginger]
If you put two and two together
You will see what our friendship is for, oh
If you can't work this equation then
I'll guess I'll have to show you the door

[Pre-Chorus: Posh]
There is no need to say you love me
It would be better left unsaid

[Chorus: All & (Scary)]
I'm (I'm), giving you everything (I'll give you everything)
All that joy can bring (all that joy can bring)
This I swear (Yes, I swear)
And (and), all that I want from you (all I want from you)
Is a promise you (is a promise you) will be there
Yeah, I want you

[Pre-Chorus: Posh]
Any fool can see they're falling
I gotta make you understand

[Bridge: Scary]
I'll give you everything, on this I swear
Just promise you'll always be there

[Chorus: All & (Sporty)]
I'm giving you everything (I'm giving you everything)
All that joy can bring (all that joy can bring)
This I swear (yes, I swear)
And all that I want from you (all that I want from you)
Is a promise you (want you to promise to)
Will be there (always be there)
I'm giving you everything (I'm giving you everything)
All that joy can bring (all that joy can bring)
This I swear (yes, I swear)
And all that I want from you (all that I want from you)
Is a promise you (want you to promise to)
Will be there (always be there)
I'm giving you everything (I'm giving you everything)
All that joy can bring (all that joy can bring)
This I swear (yes, I swear)
And all that I want from you (all that I want from you)
Is a promise you (want you to promise to)
Will be there (always be there)
