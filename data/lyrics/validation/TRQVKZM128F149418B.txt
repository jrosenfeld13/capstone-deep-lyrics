She has a place where she keeps her space neat
In a tiny room where she never sleeps
And she doesnt go there very often, but dreams of it nightly
It holds tightly to her glass
These feelings always pass

The skys are not clear for Calamity Jane
Everyone feels her pain

Silly to hide it will get you again
And no one is to blame
It's just the way
Another day for Jane

And locked away in her better days sun
Hides a tiny scene where the rain won't come
Longing for her cloudy silver lining
Where nothing is in the way
Just dont put space between her dreams and her reality

The skys are not clear for Calamity Jane
Everyone feels her pain

Silly to hide it will get you again
And no one is to blame
It's just the way
Another day for Jane

The skys are not clear for Calamity Jane
Everyone feels her pain

Silly to hide it will get you again
And no one is to blame
It's just the way
Another day for Jane
