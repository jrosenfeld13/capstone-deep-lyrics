You want it
It's coming
Only it's just time before we fall
Hand me your jacket now, i am yours

Missed the first step, fell - cut my lip, i've been eating too much sugar
There's no cover, there's a truth in it definitely
If only i'd known where i was, it was too dangerously balanced to try and walk the ledge

Take one step back (107, pick me up)
It's one step forward (give me your word)
Give me your word (107, take me home)
I'll go steady with you, baby

Comfort bound, turn off the light, won't go back to sleep until i read 5 more pages then i'm gonna set them on fire
Watch them leave, watch my words disappear
Watch me from inside my room crouched down on all fours

Take one step back (107, pick me up)
It's one step forward (give me your word)
Give me your word (107, take me home)
I'll go steady with you, baby

Take one step back (give me your word)
It's one step forward (give me your word)
Give me your word (107, pick me up)
I'll go steady with you...

You watch it
It's coming
Only it's just time before we fall
Hand me your jacket now i am yours

She is - she is everything
She is - she is everything
She is - she is everything
She is - she is everything

I've... back (107, pick me up)
It's one step forward (give me your word)
Give me your word (107, take me home)
I'll go steady with you, baby

Take one step back (107, take me up)
It's one step forward (give me your word)
Give me your word (give me your word)
I'll go steady with you
