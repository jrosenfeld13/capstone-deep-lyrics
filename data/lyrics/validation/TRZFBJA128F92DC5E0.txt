[Verse 1]
The night is early and the sky's still blue
Ain't even got to where we're going to
And you're nibbling and whispering in my ear
What you want to do? Baby I do too
Well I don't want to take this night too fast
It's just beginning, wait a minute, let's make it last

[Chorus]
Easy does it
We're going to take our time, girl we got all night
No need to rush it
Let's just kick back and relax
Slow it on down, soak up this moment
Easy does it

[Verse 2]
The summer sun is finally going down
Parked on this back road not a soul around
And we're kissing and listening to the radio
When "Let's Get It On" just happened to come on
Well all day long I've been playing it cool
You say, "Boy I want to, when you going to make your move?"

[Chorus] [x2]
