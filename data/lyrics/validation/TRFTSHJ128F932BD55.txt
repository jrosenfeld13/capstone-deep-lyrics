No more shall you share the air that I breathe
I am to suffocate, to break, and to beat
My heart beats the fire of blood freezing cold
Hands with no weapons tear through your soul

Only your death, complete defeat
I need your blood, upon my hands
Hold your fucking tears
Your life is ripped apart

Down, pound the ground
With your body crushed beyond dust
Beaten and broken, broken and bleeding, horribly quashed
Cry if you can, scream if you will, die if you must
Crushed beyond dust, crush, crushed beyond dust
