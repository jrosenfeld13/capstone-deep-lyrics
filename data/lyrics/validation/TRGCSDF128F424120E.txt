This fan might set the whole place on fire

I walked out of recriminations
Walk out today is good for my soul
Today is a day I try to keep my eyes shut
Hold up the light, cold for a time

Is the light so bad, were we so bad today?
I won't be long, I almost fell today

[Unverified]

I must have forgot some good times
Who's not been told that it's bad to sleep too long?
I sometimes regret knowing what to do
It's time that you left, look back again tomorrow

Is the light so bad, were we so bad today?
I won't be long, I almost fell today

Is the light so bad, were we so bad today?
I won't be long, I almost fell today
