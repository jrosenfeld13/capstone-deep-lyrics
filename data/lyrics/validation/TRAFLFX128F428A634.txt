My mother fucked a donkey
Down in Mexico
She had treinta margaritas
Treinta years ago
Her purse had just been stolen
She had to make some cash
For fifty thousand pesos
The donkey fucked her ass
I'm so ashamed it makes me sick
My mothers box was his salt lick
Human-donkey fornication
Her taco is the destination
It soon became apparent
It wasn't for the dough
A genuine fiesta - at the donkey show
The crowd would shout ole
As she nibbled on his sack
They never had a patron
Demand their money back
A real freak show in the pit
The donkeys fucking my moms tits
Acting like a true ranchero
Dancing around a big sombrero
The donkeys name was Lucky
Oh boy he loved to fuck
He'd get so damn excited
He'd kick and make you duck
If you want to be star
It's easy to be famous
Just pull down your pants
Let Lucky fuck your anus
I'm so ashamed it makes me sick
My mothers box was his salt lick
Acting like a true ranchero
Dancing around a big sombrero
Lucky the luckiest donkey
Lucky the luckiest donkey
Lucky the luckiest donkey
Lucky the luckiest donkey
