You sinners drop everything
Let that harmony ring
Up to heaven and sing
Sing you sinners

Just wave your arms all about
Let the Lord hear you shout
Pour that music right out and
Sing you sinners

Wherever there's music
The devil kicks
He don't allow music
By the river Styx
You're wicked and all depraved
You all misbehaved
If you want to be saved
Sing you sinners

You sinners drop everything
Let that harmony ring
Up to heaven and sing
Sing you sinners

Just wave your arms all about
Let the Lord hear you shout
Pour that music right out
Sing you sinners

Wherever there's music
The devil kicks
He don't allow music
By the river Styx
You're wicked and you're depraved
You all misbehaved
If you want to be saved
Sing you sinners
C'mon and sing you sinners
