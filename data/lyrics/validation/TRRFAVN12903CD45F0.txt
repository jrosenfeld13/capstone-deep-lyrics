It?s alright now

Words and Music by Margo Guryan

It's alright now
We talked the whole thing over
We understand each other
And we won't be seen together anymore

It's alright now
Be careful not to touch me
Don't tell me what you're thinkin'
And don't ask me what I feel

Ev'rything will be okay tomorrow
When love is gone
No one seems to love forever
Why should ours go on
And on
And on

It's alright now
It's time that we were leaving
I've other things to think of
And you shouldn't see me cryin' anyhow
And anyhow it's alright now
