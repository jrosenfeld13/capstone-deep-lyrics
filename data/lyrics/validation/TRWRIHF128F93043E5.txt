Steady like a gun
I am living a nightmare
Married to my fucking disease
Can't stop now, wanna
Die in a car crash
Maybe that's what I need

I can't stop a deadlock
I won't let ya pray for me
I'm not gonna stay long
My head is turning

Fallout
Left me without love
Tear us apart my heart
Burning inside of me
Oh yeah, hey

Terrified of none
I am sleeping with hardware
Fearless and fucking mean
Out of control, stone
Cold and reckless
Looking for my enemies

I can't stop a deadlock
I won't let ya pray for me
I'm not gonna stay long
My head is turning

Fallout
Left me without love
Tear us apart my heart
Burning inside of me

Fallout
You're leaving me undone
Maybe I'll use my gun
It's right here beside me Ahh

Running from the law
Always looking behind me
They better get ready for me
Wanna kill them all
And put an end to
This long chase

I won't stop till I succeed
The lawyers, the fraud
The system is flawed
It's time to take it
To the streets

I won't take the fall
I will leave them with no trace
For the naked eye to see

I can't stop a deadlock
I won't let ya pray for me
I'm not gonna stay long
My head is turning

Fallout
Left me without love
Tear us apart my heart
Burning inside of me

Fallout
You're leaving me undone
Maybe I'll use my gun
It's right here beside me
It's right here beside me
Burning inside of me

Ahh Fallout
