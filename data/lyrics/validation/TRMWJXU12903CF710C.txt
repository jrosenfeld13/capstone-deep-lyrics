A violent encounter
The red sky was bleeding
Glimpses of heaven
In sections of seven
Awaiting eternity

The violets adorned her
And wishers would mourn for hours
But fountains of joy
Have hollowed her eyes

Soul bound in my body
My eyes are broken windows
Go inside of me
Awaiting eternity

Her breath was all given
And torn by a living heartache
Who's choking despair
Wrenched with claws she could not bear
Awaiting eternity

Her death withdrew sunshine
Now drops of the separation
Find sharp, jagged mountains
To echo her cries

Soul bound in my body
My eyes are broken windows
Go inside of me
Awaiting eternity
