[Verse 1]
We strike first and we're unrehearsed
Here we go again to stage the greatest show on heaven and earth
Come on, get your money's worth

[Chorus]
Don't wanna live (can't live)
Don't wanna give (can't give)
Don't wanna be (won't be)
E-M-P-I-R-E

[Verse 2]
We're coming on fast and we're built to last
We stumbled once in 'Nam
Now we're glad to finally say those days have passed
Tell me how long can it last

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
We just started out
You don't need to be afraid
Yeah you deserve two minutes hate

Well, we spit and we cursed
And our bleeding hearts burst
But even ten million souls marching in February
Couldn't stop the worst, couldn't reverse...

[Chorus]

I can't live if living is with you
