Leave my house
Leave the troubles at the door
I need the coast of the East of England
He says were all going one day
Why cling on?
I think that he and I will be saved
I want to see the electricity
On the masts of the ships
As the storm builds
Lighthouse beams
I know where I am
By counting the flashes
Years ago I read that there were
Ghosts here
I want to see the electricity
On the masts of the ships
As the storm builds
