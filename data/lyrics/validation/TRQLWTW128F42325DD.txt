Living in a cast iron chain to an eight legged monster
The bonds that surround my home, they look like flies
Love to prevent thyself from getting any colder
And all I see is the dirt behind your shadow tongues

I will resolve the reason i'm stuck here
And I see the door and its all i ever needed

And the time that you hate to walk away
Because the time that you regret, you walk away

They say that I live like a dog, but I think I'm bitten
A kitchen full of nothing, but there'll be something soon
I see a light above me, could it be my angel?
Could it be my love, to keep this struggle on

I will resolve the reason i'm stuck here
And I see the door and its all i ever needed

And the time that you hate to walk away
Because the time that you regret, you walk away

I will resolve the reason i'm stuck here
And I see the door and its all i ever needed

And the time that you hate to walk away
Because the time that you regret, you walk away
