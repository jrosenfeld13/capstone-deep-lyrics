Late, winter light
Folds the air, fills my eyes
There against the sky
I call on faith with arms stretched high

And would you know how much i love you?
Would you feel the way that i do?
If i told you all the things that move my soul
And while the world is turning darkly
Would you still be the earth beneath me?
If i tell you everything, would i be sure?

Down the path we're on
We cannot turn
We cannot run
Here, we share our wounds
How we embrace what we become!
