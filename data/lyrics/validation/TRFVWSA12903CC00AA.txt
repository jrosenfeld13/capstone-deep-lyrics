This is the final state here
There's no real feeling just custom
The hell inside destroys everything
The falsehood
No feeling hurts anymore
You can't see anything in my eyes
I ever lie to myself
I don't give a shit

No understanding
No patience
No desire
No love
There's no word that could save me
For the last time

The burning fire is frozen now
Hatred and cautempt in my heart
Regret and escape in my soul
That's what I am
Take me down so I will feel
How cruel I am inside
I know that I'm a cad
And that I won't change

No understanding
No patience
No desire
No love
There's no word that could save me
For the last time
