You used to be right
You are a chemical
I've got to mix you in so I don't taste you anymore
Help for the night
Condition critical
Somehow I have got to learn to just let these things go

[Chorus]
Sell me something I haven't bought before
I'm not sure I really like this store
Just hold out your left hand and
Shake me [x5]
You, a knight upstanding
Kentucky gentleman
I'm so quick to judge but you just always seem to be on trial
Me, almighty
Preachin' to the choir now
I can't believe I haven't learned to shut my fuckin' mouth yet

[Chorus]
Sell me something I haven't bought before
I'm not sure I really like this store
Just hold out your left hand and
Shake me [x5]
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shake me
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shake me
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shake me
Shake me [x5]
Every time it happens we always end up laughing but when has it gone to far?
It's times like these I wonder who we really are
Okay

[Chorus]
Sell me something I haven't bought before
I'm not sure I really like this store
Just hold out your left hand and
Shake me [x5]
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shake me
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shake me
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shake me
Shake me [x5]
