I wish I was infinite
And given my way
I'd be so fucking cool
When i'm feeling the rush
I look at you through different eyes
I never knew my thoughts televise
What you think
I'm the twin inside you

It's hard to believe what you say
Unaccepting what you've tried to show us
It's hard to believe what you say
Unaccepting what you've tried to show us
And nothing can fix what's incomplete
Can't get to us can't get to us
And nothing can fix what's incomplete
Can't get to us never get to us

Refreshing the memories
Of times we've known
Constantly stumbling over reason
Where do these words go
Now so true
Covering no one else but you
Stepping up to make a day
Devour every modern day

It's hard to believe what you say
Unaccepting what you've tried to show us
It's hard to believe what you say
Unaccepting what you've tried to show us
And nothing can fix what's incomplete
Can't get to us can't get to us
And nothing can fix what's incomplete
Can't get to us never get to us

Fell awake in my dizziness
I'm blinding
I wish I was obedient
Aren't I something
I'll never be rational
I'm binding
My way to everyone in
This velvet sky of mine

Boredom does nothing for me
So why does it follow
Walking with the deadbeats down the street
I want everything
Be your idol
Be your maker
You're everything
Your dirty dream desire
You're everything

Boredom does nothing for me
So why does it follow
Walking with the deadbeats down the street
I want everything
