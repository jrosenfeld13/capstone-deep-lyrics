-I BELIEVE IN YOU  Amp Fiddler-

I believe in you
But if you don't believe in me
I'll be leavin' you
You better think about it

Whenever you'd call
I would come running
Really didn't matter
For you I would pry baby
'Cause that was my style baby
Now you're acting all funny
Callin your honey
And kissin my buddy
And dissin my gigs baby
But that's how I live baby

I believe in you
But if you don't believe in me
I'll be leavin' you
You better think about it

I know you got diamonds
And pearls on your mind
You know i'm on a crime
But you can't wait baby
(I'm) just tryin' to play safe baby
You're working my nerves
And I don't deserve
I'm standing on the verge
Of getting it on baby
Listen to the words of this song baby

I believe in you
But if you don't believe in me
I'll be leavin' you
You better think about it
