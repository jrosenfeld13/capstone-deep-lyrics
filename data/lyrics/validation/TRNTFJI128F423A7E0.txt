Nothing can touch you now
With tunes that angels would die for
It's no secret I hope you'll fail
Then come to me all broken and scarred

We used to look at the stars
They were ours, all ours to keep
Now that I look from afar
I dream you near
But you're outta reach

I lost you to the wide, wide world
To the cameras the bright lights
And the boys and girls
I lost you to the wide, wide world
Do you remember me?
The girl back on earth

There's nothing you can do now
Immune from danger that lay in wait
I was certain in no doubt
And suddenly it's all to late

We used to look at the stars
They were ours, all ours to keep
And now that I look from afar
I dream you near
But you're outta reach

I lost you to the wide, wide world
To the cameras the bright lights
And the boys and girls
I lost you to the wide, wide world
Do you remember me?
The girl back on earth

Everywhere that I go
You're all that I see
You're all that I know
But you forget about me
You're distant and cold
A stranger to me
And all that is left is a bitter sweet memory

I am the girl back on earth
You with your cameras
The bright lights
And the boys
And those girls
I lost you to the wide, wide world
Will you remember me?
Will you remember me?
Remember me
Will you remember me?
The girl back on earth
The girl...
