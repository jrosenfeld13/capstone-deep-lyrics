Across the sky seen from every window
The desert rain is always on the run
Beneath the sun candles out they're so gone
They're waiting for the cursed to turn the night

The noble queen flying high with wings of
Rage and fire marking out the scene
And they will be castles of this morning
Yesterday will blow the light away

Sometimes it feels like I've lost the days
Filled up with anger and pain, oh Lord
Now I can be with useless sin
Finding the trail to go

May the rivers flow till the end there will be no insanity
May the rivers grow like the angels, my dream continue
With signs of surrender

With nasty canes I will do de cruel thing
Beating all the stories left behind
And I will dance seeking for the moonlight
Testifi your guilt will always loose

May the rivers flow till the end there will be no insanity
May the rivers grow likw an angel , my dreams are your destiny
May the rivers go to the end of the story it's history
May the rivers flow like a saint then your dreams will continue
With signs of surrender
