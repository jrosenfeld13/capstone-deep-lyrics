Would you give blood if you had any
Would you say i'm good or are there far too many
Fish in the sea
Won't you please say that again

Shame on you
There's something in my head
And it's got it's back to me

One day i'll make you sing my praises
But at the moment you're far too lazy to
Get down on your knees
I'm begging please say that again

I'll carry on for as long as I have to
Come round to my house and I'll show you how to
Get down on your knees
I'm begging please say that again

Shame on you
There's something in my head
And it's got it's back to me

Would you walk near me if you knew how to
Could i ever see you and do you know how to
Get down on your knees
I'm begging please say that again

Shame on you
There's something in my head
And it's got it's back to me

Shame on you
There's something in my legs
And they never walk to me

Would you give blood if you had any
Would you say i'm good or are there far too many
Fish in the sea
Won't you please say that again
And again and again and again

Shame on you
There's something in my head
And it's got it's back to me

Shame on you
There's something in my legs
And they never walk to me

Shame on you
There's something in my mouth
And it never talks to me

Shame on you
There's something in my head
And it's got it's back to me
