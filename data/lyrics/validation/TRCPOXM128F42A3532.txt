Oh...1,2,3...1,2,3,4,5,6...1,2,3,4,5,6...oh, yeah...

You can close your eyes and pretend that everything's fine
But sooner or later you'll open your eyes
And reality will strike you blind
They're stealing all our money
And destroying all our dreams
We're working hard to make them rich
With their get rich corporate schemes, go!

We won't submit!
They're full of shit!
I'd rather die!
Than live a lie!

You bust your ass every week
You think that you are free
I want to take a fuckin' gun
And shoot them in the head
'Cause I won't rest until the day
That I look out and see
The lawyers and the politicians
All lying around dead

Punks unite, show some might
Don't go down without a fight
Don't back down, stand your ground
Let's go out and burn this town
We'll skank all night at the sight
Of the city burning bright
All around you'll hear the sound
Of the town burning down

(Open up your eyes)
You work for the system, you're a tool
(I can't take the lies)
And if you believe them you're a fool
(Can't you hear the cries)
From the working class, the ones you rule
(And you cannot hide)
Because we'll find you

(It's time for us to fight)
Against everything that you stand for
(Time to feel our might)
Gonna kick your ass and even the score
(Burn everything in sight)
Break all of your windows, loot your stores
(Gonna start tonight)
We're hard to the core

(It's time for you to pay)
Got the rotten shit that you have done
(We won't fade away)
Our hate will burn you like the sun
(We will seize the day)
It's time for us to have some fun
(We are here to stay)
Until we've fuckin' won

We won't submit!
They're full of shit!
I'd rather die!
Than live a lie!

We're running out into the streets
To pick up sticks and stones
We'll wait outside your fuckin' house
And break your fuckin' bones
We won't listen to reason
'Cause it makes no sense at all
We will bring you fuckin' down
And make you fuckin' fall

(Open up your eyes)
You work for the system, you're a tool
(I can't take the lies)
And if you believe them you're a fool
(Can't you hear the cries)
From the working class, the ones you rule
(And you cannot hide)
Because we'll find you

(It's time for us to fight)
Against everything that you stand for
(Time to feel our might)
Gonna kick your ass and even the score
(Burn everything in sight)
Break all of your windows, loot your stores
(Gonna start tonight)
We're hard to the core

(It's time for you to pay)
Got the rotten shit that you have done
(We won't fade away)
Our hate will burn you like the sun
(We will seize the day)
It's time for us to have some fun
(We are here to stay)
Until we've fuckin' won

We won't submit!
They're full of shit!
I'd rather die!
Than live a lie!
