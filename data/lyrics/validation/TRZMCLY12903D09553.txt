I recall what I said to myself the very first day we met
It's just a matter of time till I make him mine and then I found to my regret
He was easy to love but so hard to get
All the girls are crazy for him and that he already knows
I took a look in his little black book and the competition surelly stopped me
He's easy to love but so hard to get
But if at first you don't succeed you know you got to try and try again
And if at first he don't follow your leave
You got to keep on goin' after him until you win
Don't you know you'll never love a guy who's easy to get that wouldn't be much fun
There's never a guy a standing right by there's always got to be the one
Who's easy to love but so hard to get

Yes he's easy to love but so hard to get
But I can't forget he'll be mine it's just a matter of time
