Worlds Apart lyrics
Outside Your Window lyrics
Outside your window
Each time the wind blows
Outside your window
Each time the wind blows
Outside your window
Living in the fast lane
Don't get much time to be with you
Some day I know this will change
I can see that you're worried
I don't know what you've been told
Some things ain't quite what they seem
So I'll be waiting for tomorrow
To see you again, my love
And there's just something I want you to know
In my heart, until then, I hope...
Chorus
Each time the wind blows
Outside your window baby
You'll be thinking about me
Because I know
Each time the wind blows
Outside your window baby
I'll think of you endlessly
Buy a ticket for the night train
In no time I'll be with you
I never want to be this far away
Back in my arms again
I ain't ever going to let you go
With you is where I'm going to stay
So I'll be waiting for tomorrow
To see you again, my love
And there's just something I want you to know
In my heart, until then, I hope...
Chorus
(Reach out) I want you to know
I know you want me to show
I'll show you all that you need
With you I feel so complete
I really want you to see, it's so easy
Each time the wind blows
Outside your window
Each time the wind blows
Outside your window, I hope
Each time the wind blows
Outside your window baby
You'll be thinking about me
Because I know
Each time the wind blows
Outside your window baby
Back in my arms again
I ain't ever gonna let you go
