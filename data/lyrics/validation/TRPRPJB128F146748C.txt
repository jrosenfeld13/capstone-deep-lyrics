Captain I am sorry that the ship should go astray
Letting the ocean have its own way
Lay me down to pass exam, I'll pay for all my sins
Pleading for mercy, my cancel begins

Times have changed, and my vision ain't so strong
For the battle was too long for me to bear
I don't feel the pain, for my soul is sinking fast
And I notice there's at last a chance for me

In and out of turmoil, and in and out of mind
Deeper the ocean, stronger the tide
Stormy seas surround me, no sails to keep me dry
I prayed to you captain, but you heard not my cry

Times have changed, and my vision ain't so strong
For the battle was too long for me to bear
I don't feel the pain, for my soul is sinking fast
And I notice there's at last a chance for me

For me, for my story
Let me lie in peace
I want to say I'm sorry now
Then I'll be on my way
Then I'll be on my way
Then I'll be on my way

Times have changed, and my vision ain't so strong
For the battle was too long for me to bear
I don't feel the pain, for my soul is sinking fast
And I notice there's at last a chance for me
