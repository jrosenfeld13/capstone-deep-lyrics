I'm from New Jersey, I don't expect too much
If the world ended today, I would adjust

I'm from New Jersey, no, I don't talk that way
I watched too much TV when I was young

I'm from New Jersey, my mom's Italian
I've read those mafia books, we don't belong

Girls from New Jersey who have that great big hair
They're found in shopping malls, I will take you there

I'm from New Jersey, it's not like Texas
There is no mystery, I can't pretend
I'm from New Jersey, it's like Ohio
But even more so, imagine that

I know which exit, and where I'm bound
Tolls on the parkway, they will slow you down

New Jersey people, they will surprise you
'Cause they're not expected to do too much
They will try harder, they may go further
'Cause they never think that they are good enough

I'm from New Jersey, I don't expect too much
If the world ended today, I would adjust

I would adjust
I would adjust
