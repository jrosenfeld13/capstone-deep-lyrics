So come with me to a place that we don't know
Come with me, I just wanna say hello
If you need some inspiration before we go, just know
It's the way I have fallen in with you
It's the way I have fallen in with you

So come with me to a river I have seen
On the way, we can wash off in the stream
Time is waiting for the lightning to arrive
You can take my life but I'll never die
You can tell that's the way I'll survive

So here we are now, a couple of fools
Driving around, nothing to do
We just made a bad decision, that's alright

You can take my life, but I'll never die
You can tell that's the way I'll survive

Looking for the bandstand in the sky
