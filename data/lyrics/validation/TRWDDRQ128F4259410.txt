Hazy eyed
Lazy thigh
The sun beat down
What the hell did we ever have in common?
The boat was late
The first mate
He and i got so high
The sea got rough

I remember the time
We spent
On your spanish isle
When we were young
And we
Were
Freaks

Cellophane bags
Riches to rags
Man we got busted

You did alright in jail
You turned out to be quite a punk

"listen man, people are fuckin' sleepwalking, they're just sleepwalking man!"

You and i live on different galaxies
Mr and mrs

But i remember the time
We spent
Down there on your planet
When we were young
And we
Were
Freaks

A wrong left turn left a bad sunburn on a dirty mattress for 72 hours
You didn't even have the strength left to scream out to scream out
"NO MORE NO MORE NO MORE!"
Still have those handcuffs and those bloodstained black satin sheets
You guessed it right
Sooner or later love comes to this

But i remember the time
We spent
In honeymoon city
When we were young
When we were young
And we
Were
Freaks
