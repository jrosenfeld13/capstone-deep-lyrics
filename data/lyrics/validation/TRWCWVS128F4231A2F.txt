Hoochiah!

[Verse 1]
I never knew that a kid like me
Could take his mic around the world and flash the big SD
And rock the masses, from Madrid to Calabasas
Tijuana, Mexico, bootleg demos in Tokyo
You say they know me though, 'cause I be puttin' in work
Commit my life to rebirth, well respected, 'cause that's my word
I'm sure yo heard, 'bout a new sound goin' 'round
She might have left my hood, but she was born in my town

[Pre-Chrous]
You didn't know, thought we was new on the scene
Well, it's alright! It's alright!
I know you know, I see you smilin' at me
Well, it's alright! It's alright!

[Chorus]
Boom! Here comes the Boom!
Ready or not, here comes the boys from the South
Boom! Here comes the Boom!
Ready or not, how you like me now? I say:

[Verse 2]
We rep the South, so what you talkin' 'bout?
I'm not runnin' off my mouth, I know this without a doubt
'Cause if you know these streets, then these streets know you
When it's time to handle business, then you know what to do
Me and my crew, we stay true, old school or new
Many were called, but the chosen are few (we are few)
We rise to the top, what you want? Just in case you forgot
Rush the stage, grab my mic, show me what you got

[Pre-Chorus]
You didn't know, thought we was new on the scene
Well, it's alright! It's alright!
I know you know, I see you smilin' at me
Well, it's alright! It's alright!

[Chorus]
Boom! Here comes the Boom!
Ready or not, here comes the boys from the South
Boom! Here comes the Boom!
Ready or not, how you like me now? I say:
Boom! Here comes the Boom!
Ready or not, here comes the boys from the South
Boom! Here comes the Boom!
Ready or not, how you like me now?

[Interlude]
Is that all you got? Ah, haha, I'll take your best shot
Is that all you got? Ha, I'll take your best shot
Is that all you got? I'll take your best shot
Is that all you got? I'll take your best shot
Is that all you got? I'll take your best shot
I'll take your best shot, I'll take your best shot!

[Bridge]
Is that all you got?
Well, it's alright! It's alright!
I'll take your best shot
Is that all you got?
Well, it's alright! It's alright!
I'll take your best shot
Is that all you got? I'll take your best shot
Well, it's alright! It's alright!
I'll take your best shot, take your best shot
Is that all you got? I'll take your best shot
Well, it's alright! It's alright!
I'll take your best shot, take your best shot

[Chorus]
Boom! Here comes the Boom!
Ready or not, here comes the boys from the South
Boom! Here comes the Boom!
Ready or not, (ha ha!) how you like me now? I say:
Boom! Here comes the Boom!
Ready or not, here comes the boys from the South
Boom! Here comes the Boom!
Ready or not, (ha ha!) how you like me now?
