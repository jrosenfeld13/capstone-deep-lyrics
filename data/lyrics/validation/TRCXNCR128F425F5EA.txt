Count yourselves worthy
To suffer loss
Brought down held back
Marvel not that the world hates you
If you were of it it would hold you high
But as it hated Christ it hates those that follow him
Not withholding pride not withstanding right
Unashamed we rise to the name of Christ
Keep yourselves pure for the renewing of your minds
To be a light in deed and word
For this is life for this is love
Abiding in the will of the Father
Count the cost suffering all lost
In the name of Christ
Take up your cross
Looking to that which is unseen to our eternal hope
Not moved by the things of this world
Our redemption draws near the end is in sight
Hold true Christian brethren to these promises of life
