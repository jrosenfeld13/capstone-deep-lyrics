Your fallen tears have called to me
So here comes my sweet remedy
I know what every princess needs
For her to live life, happily...

With just a wave of my magic wand
Your troubles will soon be gone
With a flick of the wrist
In just a flash
You'll land a prince with a ton of cash
A high priced dress made by mice, no less
Crystal glass pumps and no more stress
Your worries will vanish
Your soul will cleanse
Confide in your very own furniture friends
We'll help you start a new fashion trend!

I'll make you fancy
I'll make you great
The kind of gal the prince would date
They'll write your name on the bathroom wall
"For a happy ever after, give Fiona a call!"

A sporty new carriage to ride in style
Sexy man, my chauffeur Kyle!
I'll vanish your blemishes
Tooth decay
Cellulite thighs will fade a way
And oh, what the hey!
Have a bichon frisee!

Nip and tuck, here and there
To land the prince with the perfect hair
Lipstick, liners, shadow, blush!
To get that prince with a sexy tush!
Lucky day! A bouquet!
You and the prince take a roll in the hay!
You can swoon on the moon
With the prince
To this tune!
Don't be drab, you'll be fab!
Your prince will have rock hard abs!
Cheese souffl!
Have a nice day!
Have some chicken fricassee!

Nip and tuck, here and there
To land the prince with the perfect hair
Lipstick, liners

Fiona:
"Stop! Thank you, very much, Fairy Godmother, but I'm afraid that I don't need all this!"
All:
(Astonished murmuring)
Dresser:
"Fine. Be that way."
