It's been a long two years
It's time to smile we've made it this far just like you said
Just like you said we would
There are no more tears
We've used them all so now we'll rely on our laughter
And the faith that pain gives joy

I hope that you can see the strength that pulled us through
Is now passed on to me I need to wear it like you always do
Like you always do

This far from home
It doesn't feel as far when I know you're doing well
Distance is what you make it
The distance is what you make it

I hope that you can see the strength that pulled us through
Is now passed on to me I wear it like you always do
I hope that you can see the strength that pulled us through
(I hope that you can see the strength that pulled us through)
Is now passed on to me I wear it like you always do
(Is now passed on to me)
Like you always do

I hope that you can see the strength that pulled us through
(I hope that you can see the strength that pulled us through)
Is now passed on to me I wear it like you always do
(Is now passed on to me)
I hope that you can see the strength that pulled us through'
(I hope that you can see the strength that pulled us through)
Is now passed on to me I need to wear it like you always do
(Is now passed on to me)
Like you always do
