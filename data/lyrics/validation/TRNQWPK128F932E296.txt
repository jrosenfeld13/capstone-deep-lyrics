Lying On The Ground
Written by A.J. Croce

Verse 1

Such a strange world
That we walk in
Everyone alone
Trying to find their way
Though we try to fly
We never really get away

Chorus

As hard as you might try
You can not let me down
Cause I'm already
Lying on the ground

Verse 2

It's only human that we question
All the world around
We are so much the same
Needing others love and confirmation
The only game

Chorus

Bridge

No need for pomp
Bring on the circumstance
I can take the tension
Not to mention lack of your romance

Chourus

Verse 3

So we dig a little deeper
Searching for a treasure
That we'll never hold
Though maybe just a little wiser
Twice as old

Chorus
