Swans do fly high above you
All the time
Prince of Sun from his pavilion
Makes you shine

Come, come, come into my garden, lady love
Maybe I can hold your gold hand
Glide within my gold grove, lady love
Know the earth and you'll understand

All the time
Prince of Sun from his pavilion

Come, come, come into my garden, lady love
Maybe I can hold your gold hand
Glide within my gold grove, lady love
Know the earth and you'll understand

Come, come, come into my garden, lady love
Maybe I can hold your gold hand
Glide within my gold grove, lady love
Know the earth and you'll understand

Come, come, come into my garden, lady love
