Fast train
Where do your passengers wait?
What's at the heart
Of your engine's rage?

To what smooth place
At the end of the line
With crackling fires
And quiet plains

Do the trees bend down
Fold their limbs round you
Welcome home, faithful one
We forgive you

Slow down fast train
Slow down fast train
Take me with you
