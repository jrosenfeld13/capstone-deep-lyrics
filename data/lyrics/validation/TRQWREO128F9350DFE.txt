By Mark Wright, Amy Sky, Gary Chapman
On the road in a thunderstorm with a load that's overdue
Drivin' on in the drivin' rain till I get back home to you
This west coast time is just a bit too fast for me
But I'll be fine when I'm back in Tennessee

CHORUS:
'Cause when we're together love's so strong
I feel I could take the whole world on
If it's gonna rain I don't care
I can take the pain if you're there
Everything is better
When we're together
Oh, when we're together
By your side all the time I see life from a different point of view
Why did I ever try getting by livin' without you
My love was locked in a prison of my pride
Then you knocked and and the door flew open wide
Thank God you came inside

(REPEAT CHORUS TWICE)
Oh, when we're together
When we're together
I know we're gonna make it
You know we're gonna make it
Just as long as we can stay together
When we're together
