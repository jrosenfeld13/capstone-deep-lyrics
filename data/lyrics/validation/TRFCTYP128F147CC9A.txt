[Chorus 1]
Sound of gunfire comes through the night
Killing and hatred, it is a terrible sight
Reports come in of the heavy attack
Message is seen, we are moving back

[Verse 1]
Preparations are made for the journey back
It is a survival, supplies are packed
No more nights in this eternal hell
Destination is simple, we move out

[Chorus 2]
Killing time - You left from the line
Killing time - Your turn to kill
Killing time - What do you say
Killing time

[Chorus 3]
And he knew what he needed to keep us alive
No time for cowardice, kill and survive
Like a killer kid with a switchblade knife
Nasty word, he will take your life

[Verse 2]
The silence is over, they attack again
Killing and hatred drive me insane
Reports come in of a heavy attack
Message is seen, we are moving back

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 2]
