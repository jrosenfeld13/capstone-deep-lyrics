Everything is foolhardy
And never is so good
Who will need an explanation
If all is understood

This time has come again
It's all shining through
This one will be forever
And I'll be there for you

It was just midnight
Feeling so high
Dancing on a crest of a wave
Your eyes met mine
Leaving those cares behind us
Dancing in the mood

This time has come again
It's all shining through
This one will be forever
And I'll be there for you

A certain combination
Near impossible to find
Rolling on stormy weather
Such a fine line
Striving to a seventh heaven
Knowing that we could

This time has come again
It's all shining through
This one will be forever
And I'll be there for you
