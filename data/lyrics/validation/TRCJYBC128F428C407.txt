Listen close with your ear to the ground
As El Diablo stirs, this place comes crashing down
And through these evil ways, once renowned and straight outta hell...
Haven been replaced by human will
There is a way out
We see it! RIGHT!
You and I wasting time
Preaching to a choir that sees black and white
You and I treading water all the time
Your skin and bones are waiting
From skin and bones to waste
We see it! Right!
We see it rise and fall a thousand times!
We See it! Right!
We drive all night, just to see it
