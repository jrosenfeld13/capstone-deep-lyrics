She's the center of attention
She's a beauty queen with possibilities
She don't care for my affection
She's my obsession in her black designer jeans

What more can I say?
She keeps me up at night in unfamiliar ways

I'll send a message to you
But you won't hear
I'm hopeless and tired of waiting for you to appear
I'm close but you're so far
Another lesson in love
Why does it always have to be so hard?

I'm so desperate to feel her
I've come way to close to leave and let it be
Throwing my love out to her
Praying one day that she'll come take it graciously

What more can I say?
She keeps me up at night in unfamiliar ways

I'll send a message to you
But you won't hear
I'm hopeless and tired of waiting for you to appear
I'm close but you're so far
Another lesson in love
Why does it always have to be so hard?

Another lesson in love
...Always have to be so hard
Another lesson in love, oh

What more can I say?
She keeps me up at night in unfamiliar ways

I'll send a message to you
But you won't hear
I'm hopeless and tired of waiting for you to appear
I'm close but you're so far
Another lesson in love
Why does it always have to be so hard?

I'll send a message to you
But you won't hear

Another lesson in love

Another lesson in love
...Always have to be so hard?
Another lesson in love, oh
