She sang we wear the party all over our bodies and faces
What allows me to speak in wild abstractions
The senseless killings gifts God gives us have no one to love them
(Oh...)

It's the kind of thought that kills you twice on the way down
You might forget them but you're not nice they don't forget about you
How they claw me in my false or foster reflection
Is that my reflection in the Damascus play?
How they claw me in my foster or false reflection
(Am I to defy my waking master?)
(Warlocks)

You should call me sometime. I won't answer but, at least I'll know you care
(How will you know it was me?)
Wha- you think I ain't got caller ID?

Guess I should be happy for you, for your success and all that
But your fame ain't got nothing for us
I supported you kid, back when no one else did (oh yeah, alright)
You know I waved your flag, back when no one else did
I just want things to be the way they used to be
When you only set a place for me
(Oh...)

The great chorus of my skull is choking on their dulcet tones
Ten lashes on the ass of anyone who even tries and
Heaven's patience glaring down at us filling your womb with black butterflies

You don't have to try to steal no nothing from my heart
Because for you anything you want is always free (free free)
Send your freaky fantasies to my phone
Black condoms on vanilla ice cream cones
Now that I'm not a virgin to you you'll never walk alone
Far beyond the self-abuse of shame
I live to make you call my name
(Oh... call my name!)
(Call my name)

Guess I should be happy for you, for your success and all that
But your fame ain't got nothing for us
I was your booster babe, back when no one else cared (oh yeah, alright)
You know I celebrated you (I'm hard for you girl)
Back when no one else even thought to
I just want things to be the way they used to be
When you only saved a seat for me
(Come back! Come back!)

I feel so at peace
Why is the sky karma
I think I'm the one I got from
