[Verse 1]
A teenage dream's so hard to beat
Every time she walks down the street
Another girl in the neighbourhood
Wish she was mine, she looks so good

[Chorus]
I wanna hold her, wanna hold her tight
Get teenage kicks right through the night

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna call her on the telephone
Have her over cos I'm all alone
I need excitement, oh I need it bad
And it's the best I've ever had

[Chorus]
I wanna hold her, wanna hold her tight
Get teenage kicks right through the night

[Verse 1]
A teenage dream's so hard to beat
Every time she walks down the street
Another girl in the neighbourhood
Wish she was mine, she looks so good

[Chorus]
I wanna hold her, wanna hold her tight
Get teenage kicks right through the night

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna call her on the telephone
Have her over cos I'm all alone
I need excitement, oh I need it bad
And it's the best I've ever had

[Chorus]
I wanna hold her, wanna hold her tight
Get teenage kicks right through the night
I wanna hold her, wanna hold her tight
Get teenage kicks right through the night
