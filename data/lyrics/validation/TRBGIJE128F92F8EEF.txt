We've seen 'em come and we've seen 'em go
But we're the boys who are in the know
We're back have you missed us?
We're back you could have fucking kissed us

We're back been away a while
We're back with our combat style

Pretenders to our name
We're back we're in the game
We'll take you on and sort you out
'Cos that's what combats all about

We're back been away a while
We're back with our combat style

You want the real men?
We're back we're here again
You know what we're fighting for
We're back we're combat 84

We're back been away a while
We're back with our combat style
