[Verse 1]
Yeah, baby!
Going to pulp you to a mass of bruises
Because that's what you're looking for
There's a hole where your nose used to be
Going to kick you out of my door

[Chorus]
Got to get into a fight
Can't get out of it
Got to get into a fight

[Verse 2]
Going to blow you to a million pieces
Blow you sky high, I don't care
Splatter matter on the bloody ceiling
Blow the building right into the air

[Chorus]
Got to get into a fight
I can't get out of it
Got to get into a fight
Going to put the boot in
Got to get into a fight
Yeah, watch me now  (Wouh wouh now) Hu!

[Verse 3]
What I want is power, more power
What I need is an innocent life
Want to do it in the broad daylight
I'm the truck, I'm the suicide

[Chorus]
Got to get into a fight
I can't get out of it
Want to get into a fight
Going to get away with it
(Wouh wouh now)
Got to get into a fight
Watch me, watch me now

[Chorus]
Yeah, got to get into a fight
I can't get out of it
I got to get into a fight
Going to put to boot him

[Verse 3]
It's all for his greater glory
It's all for a Saturday night
There's a hole where your face used to be
I got you in my telescopic sight
Got to get into a fight

[Outro]
Going to put the boot in, (Wouh wouh now) fuck him now
Nah, (Wouh wouh now) yeah!
(Wouh wouh now)
Can't get out of it
Wouh wouh now!
Going to slap the face in, (Wouh wouh now) ah!
Slash you with a razor, (Wouh wouh now) oh!
Wouh wouh na!
(Wouh wouh now) Yeah!
Can't get out of it
(Wouh wouh now)
Wouh wouh na!
Wouh wouh na!
Wouh wouh, wouh wouh na!
(Wouh wouh now)
Ooh, oh na!
