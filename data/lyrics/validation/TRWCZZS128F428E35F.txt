[James Dean Bradfield]
Ultramarine, everything vanishes
Moonlight for my stars in the drift
Not shared through speech
Each sun feels like the last
Death is proclaimed at sunset
By a final light
Which darkness fills
With every shade
Solitude bides time

Joy gives me my last regret
Joy gives me my last regret
Joy gives me my last regret
Joy gives me my last regret

Ultramarine, everything vanishes
Moonlight for my stars in the drift
Not shared through speech
Each sun feels like the last
Death is proclaimed at sunset
By a final light
Which darkness fills
With every shade
Solitude bides time

Joy gives me my last regret
Joy gives me my last regret
Joy gives me my last regret
Joy gives me my last regret
