NANETTE:
I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too
Life's really worth living
When you are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you?
When skies are gray
And you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through
I wanna be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too
I want to be happy...worth living
When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you?
When skies...blue
I'll send that sun smilin' through
I want to be happy...happy too
I won't be happy
(She won't be happy)
I won't be happy
Till the day you're happy too

When skies are gray
And you say you are blue

JIMMY:
I'll send the sun smiling through

NANETTE:
I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too

JIMMY:
When skies are gray
And you say you are blue

NANETTE:
[Spoken]
What're you gonna do?

JIMMY:
I'll send the sun smiling through

BOTH:
I want to be happy
But I won't be happy

NANETTE:
Till I make you happy too

JIMMY:
I can make you happy too
