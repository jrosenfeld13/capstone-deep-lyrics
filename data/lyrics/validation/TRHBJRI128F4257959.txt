[Intro]
Something so benign for me construed as cruelty
Such a difference between who I am and who you see

[Verse 1]
Conclusions you come to of me routinely incorrect
I dont know who youre talking to with such fucking disrespect

[Chorus]
This shits making me crazy
The way you nullify whats in my head
You say one thing do another
And argue thats not what you did
Your ways making me mental
How you filter as skewed interpret
I swear you wont be happy til
I am bound in a straight jacket

[Verse 2]
Talking with yous like talking to a sive that cant hear me
You fight me tooth and nail to disavow whats happening
Your resistance to a mirror I feel screaming from your body
One day Ill introduce myself and youll see youve not yet met me

[Chorus]
This shits making me crazy
The way you nullify whats in my head
You say one thing do another
And argue thats not what you did
Your ways making me mental
How you filter as skewed interpret
I swear you wont be happy til
I am bound in a straight jacket

[Outro]
Grand dissonance
The strings of my puppet are cut
The end of an era
Your discreditings lost my consent
