Somehow two people brought their lives together
In a lasting kind of way
Somewhere between forever and right now
Is where I'll always stay
'Cause when she sings her songs of love
I see myself between her ever line
And her bedroom ballad is her best, her sweetest
And it's playin' on my mind

Nobody seems to understand how any man can
Wear a smile all day
They ask me who was on the phone 'cause guys
Never talk to wives that way
She's got a way of sayin' things just when
I need a thought to make it rhyme
And her bedroom ballad is her best, her sweetest
And it's playin' on my mind

Like, honey, I love you
And its it already seven
Just sayin' that she needs me
Takes me mighty close to Heaven
And she'll hug and chase me off to work
With a song of love that most men never find
And her bedroom ballad is her best, her sweetest
And it's playin' on my mind
Her bedroom ballad is her best, her sweetest
And it's playin' on my mind
