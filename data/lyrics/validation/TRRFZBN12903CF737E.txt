Voice of Regina Spektor: Jenny, um, I don't know if that's you, because that didn't sound like you, but you know, it's a funny world where machines could replace people. Whoever that was, tell Jenny that Regina called her. And P.S. I can't believe what he did

All the evidence points in one direction
Says I don't need you physically around
I've got your voice on tape
I've got your words in me
I don't want anything else
I don't want anyone else
Thing that I had but I dropped
All that I had but I dropped
I want you back and forth
I want you up and down
I want you inside out

Regina Spektor: I was hoping you could keep me company for the ride home, but it's okay if you're sleeping

I've got your voice on tape
I've got your words in me
I don't want anything else
I don't want anyone else

And you say that I don't have this down
I've been practicing out loud

Other Voice: [garbled] I just wanted to call to say hi, and um, I think I might bring Marissa and Tracy up to Topeka [garbled]

I want you back and forth
I want you up and down
I want you back and forth
(I've got your voice on tape)

I want you back and forth
(Thing that I had but I dropped)

I don't want anyone
I don't need anyone else
(All that I had but I dropped)

I've got your voice on tape
I've got your words in me
I've got your voice on tape
(I've got your words in me)
I've got your words in me
(I've got your voice on tape)
I've got your voice on tape
(I've got your words in me)
I've got your words in me
