Sailing down my golden river
Sun and water all my own
Yet I was never alone
Sun and water, old life givers
I'll have them where e'er I roam
And I was not far from home
Sunlight glancing on the water
Life and death are all my own
Yet I was never alone
Life to raise my sons and daughters
Golden sparkles in the foam
And I was not far from home
Sailing down this winding highway
Travelers from near and far
Yet I was never alone
Exploring all the little by-ways
Sighting all the distant stars
And I was not far from home
