It was very late last night
I sat at the radio
Dialing from left to right
Why I do not know

I heard a man in a voice low
And sweet with circumspection
Say innocent listener don't you know
The flame is its own reflection
The flame is its own reflection

He turned me on off I turned him
We tuned out all direction
I sat alone my head aswim
The flame is its own reflection!
The flame is its own reflection!

The universe is nought but sound
Sound is its own perfection
Mind is the only truth I've found
The flame is its own reflection!
The flame is its own reflection!

I sat alone my head aswim
The flame is its own reflection!
Mind is the only truth I've found
The flame is its own reflection!
Mind is the only truth I've found
The flame is its own reflection!
The flame is its own reflection!
