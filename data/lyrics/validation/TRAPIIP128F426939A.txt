As I fall in this floating box
My mind is back to that day
I had forgotten along the way
Now the time has come, I see it's time to pay

My will is prophecy, my own mythology, an oracle to be
The blood shed by my soul, the deal time controls, tears for gifts you gave
If six was nine

The days I woke with resolve
To do an act with meaning
Seems I've lost power
To change things for the better

[Solo: SK]

When I was drawn toward you
I needed all you had
My instincts had been twisted
I learned it all too late
