On a short part
Of the long march home
With the trail that swells (?)
In a small space

There's no breath
There's no ventilation
Cause there's too much traffic
Telepathic traffic

Traffic

Get depressed with the best
It's lost, after the disaster
Cause you're sure
But it doesn't strike a cord

If I can't see it
And if we don't need it
Cause there's too much traffic
Telepathic traffic

Traffic

There's no breath
There's no ventilation
No breath
There's no ventilation
No breath
There's no ventilation

On the television
Stereo vision
When everything slips
You're the only one who sticks

On the _____________
There's a short wave
Just so you can take a short trip
On a short wave

Television
Stereo vision
When everything slips
You're the only one who sticks

On the ____________
There's another wave
Just so you can take a short trip
On a short wave
