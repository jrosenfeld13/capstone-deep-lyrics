We have come from the ashes
Of the burning away
Pouring blood in the fire
On the altar of pain
Led into temptation
Now, the black Gods align
Here, there is no salvation
And your blood is my wine

Here's a world that is waiting
Between the living and the dead
Here the flesh and its pleasure
Are eternally wet
All is all for the taking, for a life or a lie
At the end of the breaking
I'll be watching you die

Crawl to the silence, renounce and deny
The stars and the numbers
Foretold of this time
To the words and the wisdom
To the promise of lies
By their anger and fury
The strong will survive
