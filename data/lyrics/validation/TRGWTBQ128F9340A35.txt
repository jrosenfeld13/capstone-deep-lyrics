Figure eight as double four
Figure four as half of eight
If you skate, you would be great
If you could make a figure 8
That's a circle that turns 'round upon Itself

1 x 8 is 2 x 4
4 x 4 is 2 x 8
If you Skate upon thin Ice
You'd be wise If you thought twice
Before you made another single move

1 x 8 is 8,2 x 8 is l6
3 x 8 is 24, 4 x 8 is 32
And 5 X 8 is 40, you know

6 x 8 is 48, 7 x 8 is 56
8 x 8 Is 64, 9 x 8 is 72
10 x 8 is 80, that's true

11 x 8 is 88, and 12 x 8 is 96
Now, here's a chance to get off
On your new math tricks
'Cause 12 x 8 is the same as
10 x 8 Plus 2 X 8
80 plus 16 ... 96

1 x 8 is 8, 2 x 8 is 16
3 x 8 is 24, 4 x 8 is 32
And 5 x 8 is 40, you know

Figure eight as double four
Figure four as half of eight
If you skate, you would be great
If you could make a figure 8
That's a circle that turns 'round upon itself

Place it on its side and it's a symbol meaning Infinity ...
