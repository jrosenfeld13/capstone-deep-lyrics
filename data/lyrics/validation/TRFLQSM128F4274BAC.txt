Corrine, Corrina, where you been so long?
Corrine, Corrina, where you been so long?
I ain't had no lovin' since you've been gone

Corrine, Corrina
Corrine, Corrina
Corrine, Corrina
I love you so

I love Corrina, tell the world I do
I love Corrina, tell the world I do
I pray every night she learns to love me too

Corrine, Corrina
Corrine, Corrina
Corrine, Corrina
I love you so

I left Corrina, way across the sea
I left Corrina, way across the sea
If you see Corrina, send her home to me

Corrine, Corrina
Corrine, Corrina
Corrine, Corrina
I love you so

Corrine, Corrina, why don't you come on home?
Corrine, Corrina, why don't you come on home?
I'm mighty tired, bein' all alone

Corrine, Corrina
Corrine, Corrina
Corrine, Corrina
I love you so

Corrine, Corrina
Corrine, Corrina
Corrine, Corrina
I love you so
Corrine, Corrina
