Any minute the sparks will fly
At that point you will see fear in their eyes
It don't take much to send them crawling back
Just a harsh word then you attack

Gather up and
Take a sigh
See them dropping,Dropping like flies
Find revenge as Sweet as pie
See them dropping, Dropping like flies

Some call them noble but I say they're scum
Put them in control see what you become
No excuses for lack of brains
You had your chance now you can't complain

Gather up and
Take a sigh
See them dropping, Dropping like flies
Find revenge as Sweet as pie
See them dropping, Dropping like flies
See them dropping, Dropping like flies

Dropping
Smashing
Dying
Down

Can't you see 'em up there
Up on their hill so high
Close enough for gunfire
Shoot 'em down to size
Long way down

Gather up and
Take a sigh
See them dropping, Dropping like flies
Find revenge as Sweet as pie
See them dropping, Dropping like flies
Gather up and
Take a sigh
See them dropping, Dropping like flies
Find revenge as Sweet as pie
See them dropping, Dropping like flies x 3
