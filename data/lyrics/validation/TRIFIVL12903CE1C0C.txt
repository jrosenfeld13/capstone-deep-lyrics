[Verse 1]
James, get up off the bathroom floor
And unlock the door
You can stay tonight, you don't belong anywhere
Anymore
The white town express heads out west
And crashes on the couch
As [?] in the street
Outside the house when they kicked you out

[Chorus 1]
And you lit the flames of a fathers rage
You sister was smart and your mother ashamed
But tonight [?]
[?]

[Verse 2]
The boys wore ribbons in their hair
Stripped to underwear
Slept through the giggles of the girls
Choosing double dares
[?] and laces
Cats cradled cross themselves
The devil dance spring heeled and proclaimed
Sleep is the prey of alleyways

[Chorus 2]
[?]

[Outro]
Get high, stay low
Leave a note for some folks you know
I've left to join the wild boys
When the grief hits I'll be far from home
Where the beach meets the tide
The water's black with fungus[?]
And the pylons form a secret here
The kids in need of quiet time
The motorway is not as free
As the freeways in the films you see
Where no-one learns to live alone
And shoot grainy photos[?] and take them home
The best tales, first light[?]
Insert the birds between the nests[?]
Get in late and sleep to death
There's sanctity in single beds
