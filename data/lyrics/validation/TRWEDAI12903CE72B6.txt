Let's all raise a glass to the rock stars of the past
Those that made it, those that faded
Those that never even made the grade
Those that we thought would never last
Singers come and go and stars fade away
They vanish in the haze and they're never seen again
But the music just keeps playing on
They can't stop the music
They can't stop the music
They can't stop the music playing on
I've been half a million places
I've seen half a million people who stare
I've been a star and down and out
I've been put on, sat on, punched and spat on
They've called me a faggot, a spiv and a fake
They can knock me down and tread on my face
But they can't stop the music playing on
Let's all raise a glass to the rock stars of the past
Those that made it and those that faded
And those that never even made the grade
And those that we thought would never last
Singers come and go and stars fade away
(You can't stop the music, you can't stop the music)
They vanish in the haze and they're never seen again
(You can't stop the music, you can't stop the music)
But they can't stop the music playing on
(But they can't stop the music playing on)
You can't stop the music, you can't stop the music
You can't stop the music, you can't stop the music
You can't stop the music, you can't stop the music
You can't stop the music, you can't stop the music
You can't stop the music
