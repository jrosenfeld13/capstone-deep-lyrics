I promise by the moon that we shall meet again
I bring a souvenir from planet transparent

We were poles apart
Even though my heart beats rhythms
Of long forgotten songs
I promise that we shall meet again some sunny day
I fake me strong in water wind brings in my eyes
We'll leave the past behind us
Of ones we say goodbye
I promise by the moon
Maya Maya Maya Maya My Maya
And all the fireworks explode the quite night
We'll beat the stars below us
And love and scream and fight
I promise
Even though my heart beats rhythms
Of long forgotten songs
We were poles apart
