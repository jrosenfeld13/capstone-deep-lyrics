I'm a boogie rambler
Boogie night and day
Oh baby, boogie night and day

My father was a rambler
And my mother too
Oh baby, boogie all night long

Oh baby, boogie all night long
I'm a boogie rambler
Boogie all the time

My dang ol' mother, she boogie too
Oh yeah, yeah she boogie too
She boogie so long, boogied all the time

Oh baby, chop me all the time
Oh baby, chop me all the time
Want you to chop me, baby
Chop me all night long
