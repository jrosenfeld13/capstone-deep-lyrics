Erotic saints
Rated R
Rainbow veins
And sunlight scars
Say my name
Say my name
Keep me dry
In a cool place
Get me out
In a few days
I will feel so much better

Until we all are grown apart
We live our lives the way we want
Until we all are torn apart

Been in for days
Neon tan
Asbestos lips
Will kiss your hand
Every word you say
Blow me away

This is it
Here it comes
I think I'll quit
To use my lungs
Beta dreams
Airbrush a tumor

Until we all are grown apart
We live our lives the way we want
Until we all are torn apart
Until we all are grown apart
We live our lives the way we want
Until we all are torn apart

Until we all are torn apart
Until we all are torn apart
Torn apart

Until we all are grown apart
We live our lives the way we want
Until we all are torn apart
Torn apart
Until we all are grown apart
We live our lives the way we want
Until we all are torn apart
Torn apart
