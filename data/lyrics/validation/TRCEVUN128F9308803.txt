Hold that train

Hold that engine, catch me mama, get on board
Hold that engine, catch me mama, get on board
'Cause my home ain't here
It's a long way down the road

On that choo-choo, mama gonna find a berth
On that choo-choo, mama gonna find a berth
Home into Dixieland
It's the grandest place on earth

Dixie Flyer, come on and let your driver roam
Dixie Flyer, come on and let your driver roam
Wouldn't say enough to save nobody's doggone soul

Blow your whistle, tell them mama's comin' too
Blow your whistle, tell them mama's comin' too
Take it up a little bit
'Cause I'm feelin' mighty blue

Here's my ticket, take it please, conductor man
Here's my ticket, take it please, conductor man
Homin' to my mammy
Way down into Dixieland
