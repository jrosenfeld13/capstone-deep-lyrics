If I told you that I was thinking of moving east
Would you save a place for me?
I'll come home because it's worse than I expected

A place in my heart for my home to the west
Where we'll watch the same sunsets
And when I doubt, I'll look east
And lock my heart in this brass box to newfound mass
I'm breaking off but this is my home

I'd do anything for you
Give you the world if I could
Is that what you want me to do?
These bridges and boundaries are bringing me closer to you
