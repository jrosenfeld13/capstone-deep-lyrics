Fade away
All that we have dreamed of
Bergman said it all
The magic is in the fall, so true

When you see him tell him all
All, that you don't know
All, how much we've grown
So I cry but like always
I don't feel that much in here
Now I sit by your side just to be near you
Oh, lord please don't take him yet

Now you're gone, you're with angels
I will soon come visit you
And talk about the time we had together
And our town is filled with tears

Don't feel bad while you're there
Life was only sad while you were here
Filled with rage and fear
And now I sit by your side
But you can't hear me
You can always count on me

Don't feel sad, you're with angels
I will soon come visit you
And talk about the time we had together
Now our town is filled with tears

So I sit by your side
Although you're not with me
When I comfort you, when I come to you
And like always, right here by your side!

Don't feel sad, you're with angels
I will soon come visit you
And talk about the time we had together
And our town is filled with tears
