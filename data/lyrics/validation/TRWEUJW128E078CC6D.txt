Down the back streets of desire
Left on lonesome street
Where there's smoke there is fire
Lost love and hungry eyes roam free, roam free

On the boulevard of broken dreams
All through the long cold night
There's empty chances and longing glances
Dead romances are locked out, cold outside

They say the heart is a lonely hunter
A lonely hunter in the dark
Hear them drums beat loud as thunder
It's a lonely hunter and a lonely hunted heart

In a dark room there's tragic magic
There's a heart that's torn apart
All those spells that no one catches
It's a lonely, lonely hunted heart

They say the heart is a lonely hunter
A lonely hunter in the dark
Hear them drums beat loud as thunder
It's a lonely hunter and a lonely hunted heart
It's just a lonely hunted heart, yeah-hey

It's a lonely hunter and a lonely hunted heart
Lonely hunted heart, hey-hey

Lonely, lonely hunted heart, yeah
It's just a lonely hunted heart, yeah
A lonely hunted heart ...
