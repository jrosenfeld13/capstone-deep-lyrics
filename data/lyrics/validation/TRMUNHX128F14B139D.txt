[Verse I - Peter Fox]
She call me and she weep
She was cryin on the phone
Says she couldn't sleep
And she couldn't stay alone
Well, anytime the phone a ring
She come up with some other thing

Next day she call me
Says she had a car crash
She must have it fixed
Girl, soon I'm running outa cash
Still she plan our white wedding
She want me now fi buy dem ring

She twists me right around her pretty finger
And this is what I got to say uhh girl
She twists me right around her pretty finger
And this is why I got to stay oh oh oh

[Verse II - Dell]
She's my sweet honey bunny
And she loved to be a gangster
Robbing out a bank is her greatest adventure
To make her feel fine
I must be her brother in crime

How did she get me rob the bank of the nation
Today I am in jail, cause we had a complication
But she's so sly
She got the cell keys ready for a new crime

She twists me right around her pretty finger
And this is why I got to stay uhh girl
She twisted me right around her pretty finger
This is why I got to stay baby

[Verse III - Boundzound]
She lifts her shades up
Her eyes get me shot
Back in our spot
She's rushing my blood
Paint my soul golden
And I thank god
For all we got
It's such a lot
We gotta hold on
Cool or hot
She's on my frequency
Sounding like the source
Of all I'll ever be

She twists me right around her pretty finger
And this is why I got to stay uhh girl
She twisted me right around her pretty finger
And this is why I got to stay baby

She twists me right around her pretty finger
And this is why I got to stay uhh girl
This is why I got to stay
