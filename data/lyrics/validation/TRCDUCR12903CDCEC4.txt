To the following Christians listen closely
We bring our light to a new realm, a realm you dare not enter, passing judgment behind stone walls, behind your absence of understanding
We will crush your walls that dictate where our ministry goes, don't you ever tell me I'm using God as a gimmick
I'm not a heretic, I'm not a hypocrite; those insults make me sick from the ones I have fellowship with
We aren't doing this for our own, but for one name holy and alone
These venues are our church, we are the gospel in the darkness, and this is our exaltation
We are the gospel in the darkness; we bring our light to a new realm, a realm you dare not enter, passing judgment behind stone walls, behind your absence of understanding

Are you listening!!!
We'll crush the walls that dictate where our ministry goes, this is our church, this is our worship
GORSHIP!
