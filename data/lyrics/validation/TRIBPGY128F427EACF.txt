Chorus:
I got to find me a girl
Oh, I got to find me a girl
Somebody who
Can make all my dreams
Come true
Somebody soft and warm
I know just what I want
I've been searching everywhere
Can't seems to find her anywhere
Could it be you, could it be you
Could it be you

Chorus:
I got to find me a girl
Oh, I got to find me a girl
Somebody true
To make all my lonely nights
A thing of the past
Someone to make everything
All right
I got to find me a girl
Find me a girl
Find me a girl
Oh baby
Somebody who
Can make all my dreams
Come true
Somebody soft and warm
I know just what I want
I've been searching everywhere
Can't seems to find her anywhere
Could it be you, could it be you
Could it be you
