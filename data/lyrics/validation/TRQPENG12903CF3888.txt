As we envisage the countless imperfections*
That we disrespectfully share
With the remorseless mortals
That stand beside us
All brainless humanity relapses, falling deeper into despair
Everyone's responsible for the failure of our decrepit system
As a punishing destitution, falls into place
Humankind division's a nauseous premonition
The continental divides crumble, under the weight of control
Ill advised and despicable tactics used by our rulers
Never go unnoticed as they tame
We have betrayed our charlatan Christ
Society strives to become a requiem
Prayer become inconsequential
As the light of Christ begins to fade
Our inviolate celestial body
Weakens at the core as putrefaction sets in
The great depression is upon us and we have sentenced ourselves to collapse
