Well, I left Natchez early and I don't know why;
Had a girl till sunburn and high in the sky
61 was callin' my name
I was headin' for New Orleans had to make a change
I'm back Tuesday on Mardi Gras bound;
I need that Creole Queen that I once found

//solo//

Well, Louisiana women love a fat boy song;
You'll get one, man, you'll never let her go
Runnin', marryin' and the dog - good town;
I said, the Creole Queen butt chased away your blues
I'm headin' for New Orleans on Mardi Gras bound;
I got my baby back I'm headin' back to town
