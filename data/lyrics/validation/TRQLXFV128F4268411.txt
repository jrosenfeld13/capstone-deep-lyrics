All right yea
I met this girl around quarter to ten
We made it once she said "make me again"
She wrapped her love around me all night long
In the mornin' we were still goin' strong

Now let me tell ya it sure feels good
First time I saw that girl I knew it would
Now let me tell ya it sure felt right
No pullin' teeth she didn't want to fight she said

Shake me
All night
She said
Shake me
Shake it don't break it baby
Shake me
All night
She said
All night long
All night long baby

Screamed and scratched and rolled out of the bed
I never really got her out of my head
And now and then she makes those social calls
Gives me a squeeze gets me kickin' the walls

Now let me tell ya it still feels tight
And we were shakin' after every bite
I feel her comin' in the middle of the night
Screamin' higher

Shake me
All night
She said
Shake me
Shake it don't break it baby
Shake me
All night
She said
Shake me
Ooo yea

All night, keep the fire burnin' cause we're doin' all right
All night, come on and shake it right

Shake me
Shake me
Shake me
Shake me
Shake me
All night
She said
Shake me
Shake it don't break it baby
Shake me
All night
She said
Shake me
Ooo yea

Shake me
Shake me
Shake me
Shake me
