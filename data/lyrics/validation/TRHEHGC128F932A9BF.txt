The drums will bring you home
Then our hands will do the talking
And we will be united!
Diamonds for a kiss
And if there's a god? Say it isn't your turn
We can, we're strong, we'll beat it!
We can, we're strong, we'll beat it!

Writing everything down
In order to keep track of time
The scent, the day, this moment!
With hands covering my eyes
Shadows they're good, then I know there's light
We can, we're strong, we'll beat it!
We can, we're strong, we'll beat it!

We can, we're strong, we'll beat it!
