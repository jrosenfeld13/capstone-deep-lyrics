Mantaker (mantaker)
I say she a (I say she a)
Mantaker (mantaker)
I say she a (I say she a)

In the beginin' I was fine when you
Introduced me to to an old high school friend
I was was questionin'
If she
Was schemin'

All of a sudden she was at home with us
Always sittin' right next to you
Yea I see her plan
But you don't

Don't you say no, no
She would have to make it through
Say yes

(Chorus)
She ain't your friend
She's just a man taker, yea
She ain't no friend
She's just a man taker, yea

Kepp up with all your explainations
Sayin' she your friend, that's your imagination
Why don't you just gimmie your phone
So that I can ask her on my own

Tried to contender, boy just surrender
Everywhere she ask to go
You want to send her
You do things at the click of her finger, baby

If you say no, no
She would have to make it through
Say yes

(chorus)
She ain't your friend
She's just a man taker, yea
She ain't no friend
She's just a man taker, yea

All of the sound that I kept hearin' underneath the carpet
I said nothin'
Kept it silent
Knowing the truth
'Til I saw her try to put a move onto you baby
What's she doin'
I'll tell you she a man taker

I told you that she is
I told you what she was
I'll tell you what she is

She a man taker
She a heartbreaker (x4)

(chorus)
She ain't your friend
She's just a man taker, yea
She ain't no friend
She's just a man taker, yea (x2)
