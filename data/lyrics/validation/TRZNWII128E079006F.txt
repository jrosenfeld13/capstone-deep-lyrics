Doo doo, doo doo loo loo loo, doo doo, doo doo
Doo doo, doo doo loo loo loo, doo doo, doo doo

[Michael]
I never, never had a dream come true
In my every daydream
I'm loved by you

[Jermaine]
And we're free as the wind, ah yeah
And true love is no sin
Therefore men are men, not machines

[Michael]
I never, never had a dream come true
Without you, the world out there
Is painted shades of blue, yeah

[Jermaine]
Since our roads never cross
I work just to please the boss
Think I might as well get lost in my dreams

Doo doo, doo doo loo loo loo, doo doo, doo doo
Doo doo, doo doo loo loo loo, doo doo, doo doo

[Michael]
I never had a dream come true
I guess I'm gonna, I'm gonna dream you about you, baby
My whole life through, yeah

[Jermaine]
Seems my folks are ashamed, ah yeah
Said I ain't worth a thing Lord, Lord
But I'm glad I am chained to my dreams

Doo doo, doo doo loo loo loo, doo doo, doo doo
Doo doo, doo doo loo loo loo, doo doo, doo doo
Doo doo, doo doo loo loo loo, doo doo, doo doo...
