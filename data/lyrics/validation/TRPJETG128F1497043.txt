When you're on top of the world
When it's got you down
When your flying through the air
When your crashing to the ground
When your searching for the light
There is no where to be found
Just find me,baby

I don't wanna be the strings
That ever tie you down
I will never be the broken wings
That keep you on the ground

But when we start to sing
I will be the sound
Just let me, baby

I only wanna be the one you love
I only wanna be the one you want
Come and get me, baby
Let me loos in side your soul
I only wanna be your every need
I wanna be the girl in all your dreams
I do anything to be
The one you love

Baby, you can tell me anything
All the secrets of your heart
You can look inside of me and see
How beautiful you are
I wanna show you everything
Each and every part of me is yours
Just take it, baby

I only wanna be the one you love
I only wanna be the one you want
Come and get me, baby
Let me loos in side your soul
I only wanna be your ever need
I wanna be the girl in all your dreams
I do anything to be
The one you love 

Let me be the lover
You won't took uncover
Let me be the one you love
Hey baby

I only wanna be the one you love
I only wanna be the one you want
Come and get me, baby
Let me loos in side your soul
I only wanna be your every need
I wanna be the girl in all your dreams
I do anything to be
The one you love
