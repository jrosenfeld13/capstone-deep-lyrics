They think they are the superior ones
They think they are above our heads
They read the bible and they kiss the cross
They do a lot of things that makes no sense

They read the bible just to hide from truth
They read the bible so they can sleep at night
They read the bible and dream of paradise
They read the bible and worship Jesus Christ

Stay away from all the Christian shit
Holy men prowls in every corner
Don't be fooled by their disgusting tricks
If they try send them to the coroner

I teach my brothers not to fall in traps
I teach my brothers not to believe their words
I teach my brothers to despise them all
I teach my brothers to hate them all

Worldwide they preach to ambush the weak
Holy legions lie in wait

Hate them

Crush them all with Jesus they bleed
A paradise it would be

Hate them

The strong ones stand tall
The weak ones will fall

They think they are the superior ones
They think they are above our heads
They read the bible and they kiss the cross
They do a lot of things that makes no sense

They read the bible just to hide from truth
They read the bible so they can sleep at night
They read the bible and dream of paradise
They read the bible and worship Jesus Christ

Hate them
