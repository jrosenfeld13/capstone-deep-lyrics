Time runs out

Those words seemed so sincere
And I've been so lonely here
I find myself lost in escape

Marked by hands I held as my anchor
But in your shallow sea I drown

I can still hear the trees
At my back and haunting me
Unafraid, unaffected
This has all gone so wrong
Under this December sky
I walked away compromised
Counting steps, of what's left
To bring this all to an end

Outside you will find the ring that once belonged to me
(Just give me one reason why
Well maybe some other time)
Sharing space with her face
(You think this all is a game
It's not a game to me)
Pictures on the drivers seat

So now we will both kill the messenger
It's such a blur
You didn't even see
This meant everything to me

Invisible, plans you made
Deconstruct me
Tethered to the dream of you
But disappearing

If it's grey then just leave it
Some colors start bleeding
So guard yourself
That's what my folks used to say
Defended your secrets
Claiming past loves and regrets
The ambition was hidden
To shield yourself from the blame

Outside you will find the ring that once belonged to me
(Just give me one reason why
Well maybe some other time)
Sharing space with her face
(You think this all is a game
It's not a game to me)
Pictures on the drivers seat

Your failing words once moved heaven and earth
But now they can't make me believe

Invisible, plans you made
Deconstruct me
Tethered to the dream of you
But disappearing

Those words seemed so sincere
In this shallow sea I drown

You want to run and hide to catch your breath
(This can't be happening)
But why don't you come inside and capture all that's left
(This can't be happening)
Capture all that's left
(Oh, but this is happening)

I don't want to wait for this
A ruined list, the longing kiss
Making all the moments last
As if we had, the sentiment
Yearning for the sound
Breaking from the crowd
Leaving all the cynics
Racing for the finish

Time runs
Time runs
Time runs
Time runs out

If I should die
If I should
If I should die
If I should
If I should die
If I should
If I should die
If I should
