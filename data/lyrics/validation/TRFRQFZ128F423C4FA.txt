[Verse]
How many times must I tell you babe
How many bridges I have got to cross?
How many times must I explain myself
Before I can talk to the boss?
Before I can talk to the boss?

[Chorus]
How many times must I say I love you
Before you finally understand?
Will not you be my forever woman?
I will try to be your forever man
Try to be your forever man
How many times must I say I love you
Before you finally understand?
Will not you be my forever woman?
I will try to be your forever man
Try to be your forever man

[Outro]
Forever man, forever man, forever man
Forever man, forever man, forever man
Try to be your forever man
Forever man, forever man, forever man
Forever man, forever man, forever man
Try to be your forever man
