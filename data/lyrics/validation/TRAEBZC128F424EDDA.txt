Haunted
By your voices
Feel dead
And unconscious

Pain and hate become our process
It spreads as he watches
Hatred is contagious
Hatred is contagious

It breaks me
It takes my pride
It makes me
But I am alive

(but I am alive)

Crosses
Are our losses
Tombstones
Make our fossils

Pain and hate become our bosses
It spreads as he watches
Hatred is contagious
Hatred is contagious

It breaks me
It takes my pride
It makes me
But I am alive

Hatred
Is contagious
Hatred
Is contagious

It breaks me
It takes my pride
It breaks me
It's built on lies
It makes me
But I am alive

But I am alive
