[Intro]
I'm so tired, you on my head
Whiskey'n mama, you shouldn't have said
You wanted me to be your lover tru
Then turn around and treats me just likes you do
I should have known better than to fool with a whiskey'n mama

[Verse 1]
Now I could be right and could be wrong
You been laying out all night long
You telephoned this morning, said you'd be home soon
The doorman said he seen you at the Club Blue Lagoon
I should have known better than to fool with a whiskey'n mama

[Chorus] [x2]
Whiskey'n mama, you standing there
With your curly hair
Just to have you do me good
I know you could if you only would

[Verse 2]
Well, the sun come shining on the rain soaked street
Whiskey'n mama, where can she be?
I guess I'll have to put you down on my list
I didn't want to do it but you insist
I should have known better than to fool with a whiskey'n mama
