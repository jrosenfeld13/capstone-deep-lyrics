Your love, love is all around me everywhere
Love has come to touch my soul with someone who really cares
No one can deny us people who once passed me by will turn their heads and

I am happy just to be with you
And loving you the way I do
Is everything I need to know
Just a resting in the afterglow of your fire

You, yes, you have always been here, a feeling deep inside
A feeling that I could not see, or touch or try to hide
My love is in and without you, I bless the day that I found you
So listen, baby

I am happy just to be with you
And loving you the way I do
Is everything I need to know
Just a resting in the afterglow of your fire

Love is like a voice in my head
Keeps turning out the things that we said

I am happy just to be with you
And loving you the way I do
Is everything I need to know
Just a resting in the afterglow of your love
