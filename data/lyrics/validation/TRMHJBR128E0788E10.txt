Sign a name, sign away every hour, every day
You're living your dream
Play the game; take the blame for the power and the fame
You're living your dream
Sell your life; sell your soul telling everyone you know
You're living your dream

And you know that you're good
Cause they told you you could be
The next best superstar
And you know you can sing
And you'll do anything to be
The next best superstar
You're the next best superstar

Make a joke; do the show, where does all the money go?
You're living your dream
Crack a smile in denial; throw your morals on the fire
You're living your dream
Sell your life; sell your soul telling everyone you know
You're living your dream

And you know that you're good
Cause they told you you could be
The next best superstar
And you know you can sing
And you'll do anything to be
The next best superstar
You're the next best superstar

Now you're broken
And how they brought you down
So now you're crawling out

And you know that you're good
Cause they told you you could be
The next best superstar
And you know you can sing
And you'll do anything to be
The next best superstar

And you know that you're good
Cause they told you you could be
The next best superstar
And you know you can sing
And you'll do anything to be
The next best superstar
The next best superstar

The next best superstar
