Picture in my head
Stretches miles wide
Picture in my head
Is burning me inside tonight

I'd like to know the facts
Before they deceive me
Why the mountains touch the sky
But there's no ground beneath me
Why the trees in the forest stand so tall

God, I want to know
Bury it in hope
Pull me by the rope
Nothing but alone

What's the fastest way home?
Put an end to the unknown
Leave me alone

But that won't be enough
My hope in life is soon to be my crutch
I kept it in and now I'll keep it shut
So throw it all away, lock it up
An illustration
And off better days
It's just an image in my mind

God, I want to know
Bury it in hope
Pull me by the rope
Nothing but alone
