The flavour fades
From lady marmalade
Our carousel
Has lost it's caramel

Cos my baby's gone suga free
She ain't sweet like she used to be
My sweet tooth is missing a cavity yo
Because my baby's gone suga free

My cinnamon girl
Took back her peppermint pearl
It's seems that she
Now counts her calories!

Cos my baby's gone suga free
She ain't sweet like she used to be
My sweet tooth is missing a cavity yo
You know my baby's gone suga free

Honeydew
And now honey don't!

My baby's gone suga free
She ain't sweet like she used to be
My sweet tooth is missing a cavity yo
My baby's gone suga free
