The 8000 times you were right
You realised that life seems unfair
But since you've got no one to blame
There's no need to change your course

There were things you need
There were things I gave
But they never seemed enough
Until I cried, you kept it and waved me goodbye
Old ties
Old ties

With the powers invested in me
I'll force you to see and believe
Cause sometimes the party goes bad
And people get mad but not me

There were things you need
There were things I gave
But they never seemed enough
Until I cried, you kept it and waved me goodbye
Old ties
Old ties
Old ties
Old ties
