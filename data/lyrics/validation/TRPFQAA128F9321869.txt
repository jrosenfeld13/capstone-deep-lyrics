Oh such handsome people carry on with you now
Laughing at our Yugo when all their cars are new
Telling everybody that they're better than them and always counting money with a devilish grin
It's often hard to love you when you're fooling around with fools
Still I've known so many girls who just tear my heart in two

They only remind me of you
