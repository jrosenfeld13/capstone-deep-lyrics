Youre a bullet-proof lover, make no mistake
There aint no other, youve all it takes
To make me feel so angry and so confused
You got me so messed up, what can I do?
Ive had my fill, all that I will take
I cant stand no more, oh I only ache
My heart would break
Oh a bullet-proof lover, you say be true
But bullet-proof lover, look at you
Bullet-proof lover, cant you for once step down?
You might have set me up, but Im no clown
That makes your victory shallow, and when that you see
There wont be no more what youll put one on me
Ive had my fill, all that I will take
I cant stand no more, oh I only ache
My heart would break
Bullet-proof lover, you say be true
But bullet-proof lover, look at you
Bullet-proof lover, you say be true
But bullet-proof lover, look at you
Bullet-proof lover, look at you
Bullet-proof lover, look at you
Bullet-proof lover
