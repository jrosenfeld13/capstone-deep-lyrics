I still believe in your eyes
I just don't care what
You've done in your life

Baby I'll always be here by your side
Don't leave me waiting too long
Please come by!

I, I, I, I still believe in your eyes
There is no choice
I belong to your life

Because I, I live to love you some day
You'll be my baby
And we'll fly away

And I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you

You are, oh!
You are, oh!
You are, oh!

Every day and every night
I always dream that
You are by my side

Oh, baby, everyday and everynight
Well, I said everything's
Gonna be alright

And I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you

You are, oh!
You are, oh!

I still believe in your eyes
I just don't care what
You've done in your life

Baby, I'll always be here by your side
Don't leave me waiting too long
Please come by!

I, I, I, I still believe in your eyes
There is no choice
I belong to your life

Because I, I live to love you someday
You'll be my baby
And we'll fly away

And I'll fly with you
Il fly with you

Every day and every night
