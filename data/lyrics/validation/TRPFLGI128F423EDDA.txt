Settle down and think It through
Everything's not lost
And all the times I've failed you
The lines I wouldn't cross
And all the lines I wouldn't cross

Far away that you are
A jealous sky awaits
And I've been searching every star
For a chance to twist my fate

I will throw myself to the sea
Let it carry me
To the places I didn't go
I couldn't let you
Know I was leaving
But you are the reason
Now I'm standing and feeling alive, tonight

Come back to me you're all I know
There's words I need to say
Like I was wrong, and I was caught
But your love saved the day

I will throw myself to the sea
Let it carry me
To the places I didn't go
I couldn't let you
Know I was leaving
But you are the reason
Now I'm standing and feeling alive

I couldn't let you
Know I was leaving
But you are the reason
Now I'm standing and feeling alive, tonight

Open, open, so open, open
So open, open. Open, open

Know I was leaving
You are the reason
Now I'm standing and feeling alive, tonight

I couldn't let you
Know I was leaving
But you are the reason
Now I'm standing and feeling alive

Know I was leaving
Now I'm standing and feeling alive, tonight
