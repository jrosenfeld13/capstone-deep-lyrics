So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
Cuz nothing else matters

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we do it our way
All these words I don't just say
Cuz nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do, No
Never cared for what they know, No
But I know

So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
Cuz nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do, No
Never cared for what they know, No
Never cared for what they do, No
But I know

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us, something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters, Oh

So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
Cuz nothing else matters
Cuz nothing else matters
