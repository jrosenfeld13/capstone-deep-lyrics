Why don't you tell me you love me?
Why don't you say that you care?
I might do something extravagant
Like play with your hair

Where would that lead me?
Up to your bedroom and into your arms
Would you please me
Or would your conscience save you?

Where would that leave me?
Where would that leave me?

I won't pretend to be perfect
If you won't pretend that I should
We might do something indiscreet
Ah, you know we could

Where would that lead me?
Up to your bedroom and into your arms
Would you please me
Or would your conscience save you?

Where would that leave me?
Where would that leave me?
Where would that leave me?
Where would that leave me?
(Repeat and fade)
