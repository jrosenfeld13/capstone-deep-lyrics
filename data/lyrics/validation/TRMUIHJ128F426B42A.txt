Sun explodes on my skin
I don't like the state I'm in
Trying to catch the perfect wave
It's coming now, come on, let's rave
But I drown, yeah, I drown

Out all day, all in vain
Pale skin, sun causes pain
The water's cold, deep and black
Down again, board's cracked
And I drown, yeah, I drown

Look who's here to save my soul
Sweet night, she's on a roll
Covers me with her all black
Satin dress, takes me aback
And I drown, yeah, I drown
