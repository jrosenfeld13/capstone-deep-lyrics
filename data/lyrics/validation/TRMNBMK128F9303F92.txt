From nowhere through a caravan
Around the campfire light
A lovely woman in motion
With hair as dark as night

Her eyes were like that of a cat in the dark
That hypnotized me with love

She was a gypsy woman
She was a gypsy woman

She danced around and round
To a guitar melody
From the fire her face was all aglow
How she enchanted me

Oh, how I'd love to hold her near
And kiss and forever whisper in her ear

I love you, gypsy woman
I love you, gypsy woman

All through the caravan
She was dancing
All the men
Waiting for the rising sun
Everyone was having fun

I hate to see the lady go
Knowing she'll never know
That I love her
I love her

Gypsy woman
I love a gypsy woman
I love a gypsy woman
I love a gypsy woman
I love a gypsy woman
