We can make our dreams come true
So I will watch you think it through
You know I'm right

I heard you crying for the second time tonight
We can build it up our way
We can shape the world our way

If we stay here we die here
We'll never get away
If we stay here we die here
With nothing left to say
(repeat)

We can take this world apart
And make ourselves a brand new start
You know I'm right

I saw you smiling for the second time tonight
We can tell the truth one day
But we'll save the world our way

If we stay here we die here
We'll never get away
If we stay here we die here
With nothing left to say
(repeat)

We can make our dreams come true
So I will watch you think it through
You know I'm right

We can take this world apart
And make ourselves a brand new start

We can build it up our way
(I want you there with me I just can't do this alone)
We can shape the world our way
(I want you there with me I just can't do this alone)

If we stay here we die here
If we stay here we die here
With nothing left to say

If we stay here we die here
We'll never get away
If we stay here we die here
With nothing left to say

Our way
I just can't do this alone
(repeat)
