Down in Mexicali
There's a crazy little place that I know
Where the drinks are hotter than the chili sauce
And the boss is a cat named Joe

[Chorus]
He wears a red bandanna, plays a cool piano
In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico
He wears a purple sash and a black mustache
In a honky-tonk, down in Mexico

Well, the first time that I saw him
He was sittin' on a piano stool
I said "Tell me, man, when does the fun begin?"
He just winked his eye and said, "Man, be cool"

[Chorus]

In Mexico
All of a sudden in walks a chick
In Mexico
Joe starts playing on a Latin kick
In Mexico
Around her waist she wore three fishnets
In Mexico
She started dancin' with the castanets
In Mexico
I didn't know just what to expect
In Mexico
She threw her arms around my neck
In Mexico
We started dancin' all around the floor
In Mexico
And then she did a dance I never saw before

So if you're south of the border
I mean down in the Mexico
And you wanna get straight, man, don't hesitate
Just look up a cat named Joe

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Hey, como est usted senorita
Come with me to Mexico City
You can get your kicks in Mexico
Hahaha, crazy. Come with me, baby. Come with me
Ah we can watch the bull fights together
Come with me, senorita. yeah... yeah...
