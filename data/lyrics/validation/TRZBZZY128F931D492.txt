Lying in the quiet darkness
Getting high alone
Pictures shifting out of focus
Not as far to go

Eyes to the sun
One more blind
Secret kind

Yesterday is twice removed
Tomorrow's close behind
Alone and unreliable
Windows out of time

Eyes to the sun
One more blind
Secret kind

Lying in the quiet darkness
Getting high alone
Pictures shifting out of focus
Not as far to go

Eyes to the sun
One more blind
Secret kind

Eyes to the sun
One more blind
Secret kind
