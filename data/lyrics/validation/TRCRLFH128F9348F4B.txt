My weak resistance, of yer flower
Got me infected, coz I was to blind to see
Everyone told me, but did I listen
No I was sick'n tired of the same reply from thee

You lead the game, i followed...
You were the bait, I swallowed...

It's a miracle you walk the earth, alone
It's a miracle I stand beside you
Yer like a plague in awide'n open show
You pass it on like I need it the most

I smelled yer rose'n craessed yer petals
Never bothered by the thorns that made me bleed
Coz I longed to feel you so deep inside me
Bt now I'm stukk with you forever without remedy

You lead the game, I followed...
You were the bait, I swallowed...

You knew my pain...
You lead the game...
And I followed yeah I followed
Your lies, your play, yer all the same to me
