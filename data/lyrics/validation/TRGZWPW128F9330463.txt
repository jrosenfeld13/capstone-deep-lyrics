You came to me
Was like a dream
But maybe it's time I let you go
It's all on me
Can I find it inside
And feel that fire burn in my eye
Can I give you up
Can I come back down

Gotta get you out of my head (repeat)
I'm addicted to love (background)

Chorus:
And I wonder why
I'm addicted to love
One day I will run away from you and this love (repeat)
