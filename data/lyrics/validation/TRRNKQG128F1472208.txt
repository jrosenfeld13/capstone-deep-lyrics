Take my sword from the slaughter
Melt it down into vapor, and my armor, too
I hear hot blood flap and flutter
From your temple to shoulder
And all through you

When you hold on to me it isn't easy
When you hold on to me isn't fair
But when there's no key you find me there

I'm turning white, I'm leaves of paper
Turn my hands from this labor and lift me through

When you hold onto me it isn't easy
But you should hold on to me
It isn't fair, but when there's no key you find me there

And kids get lost, lambs out wandering
And bigger, blacker things come calling
From outside a tiny garden
Somebody once laid their hearts on
And kids get lost, and kids get broken
And their diaries get found and opened
And their legs get led astray
And then they lie inside some secret place
Where the sun looks in the open ceiling
And kids grow up, and kids stop feeling
Kids, and feel adults, and face away

But in last love dreams
The lost and passed out of this world are softly sighing
They're trying to decide if they should leave the things that keep them crying
And some will rise and keep on living with open eyes, with minds forgiven

The river's flowing is arrested
And resumed after they've blessed it
Over and over and over, and over and
Over and over, and over again
(It's over)
