Oh, Chipper
I'm: homed, embedded, emfoamed, hula-hulaed, raveled out

Suspended in roar, in rip, in posture
Thermoset natured, surrounded
Wow

When my bubbling words
My mouth's corners to hers
Snaplings are lip-read Braille

I spit
I moan when excavating foam
Elbows out bulge in a night flowerer

Foam, foam, foam hideaway
Rolled over slack hideaway
Foam, foam, foam hideaway
Rolled over slack-jawed we hide away
