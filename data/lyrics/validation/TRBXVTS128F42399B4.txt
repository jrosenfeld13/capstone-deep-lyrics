If the question's asked
When the kid is innocent
And the answer's plain
Because you're not into it

The line is drawn
And your unligtented son
Will go forth with
A wealth of misinformation

His day has come
If it's on the tube
Put him in real time
It'll do him good

Make him realise
The continuum between
Ignorance and childhood

Shield nothing
Let him breathe
Let him see

Shield nothing
Let him breathe
Let him see

When the kid can't sleep
From the fear of the mystery
Please keep in mind
The good you've designed

And when the bell rings
At noon of no concern
Try not to act surprised
When the epithet cries
"My mother lies
My eyes aren't blind
My life's a line"

Though this is another
Disease and we cry
When understanding is reached
This what fostering means
It will all be over soon

Shield nothing
Let him breathe
Let him see

Shield nothing
Let him breathe
Let him see
