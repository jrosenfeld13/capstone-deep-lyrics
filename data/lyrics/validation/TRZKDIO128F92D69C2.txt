I see trails
I see stray dogs in space chasing their tails

Tall illusions with
Massive momentum
Asking me questions
From another dimension
Small illusion with
Massive momentum
Your rhetorical questions have
Massive momentum

I see trails
I see you carving your name unto side of a killer whale
How did I get here?
The dude at the gate giving directions

Tall illusions with
Massive momentum
Small illusion with
Massive momentum
Asking me questions
Of
Another dimension

Momentum
In all 1 million corners of the season, how about reason?
Momentum
In all 10 thousand corners of the thrill, got the chills?
Momentum
In all 1 million corners of the season, carry your reason!
Momentum
In all 10 thousand corners of the thrill, got the chills?
Momentum
In all 1 million corners of the season, just treason!

You see trails
You see the Garden of Eden and man looks pale

Tall illusion with
Massive momentum
Asking me questions
From another dimension
Small illusions with
Massive momentum
You're the rhetorical question with
Massive momentum
