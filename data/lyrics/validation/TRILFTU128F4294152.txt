Verse 1
Smile, wave
Convince the sanctuary, our charade
Though you're the object of my deepest rage
Just counterfeit this holiness for me
And everything will be okay

My sweet one, you tell no lies
The greatest reason to be despised
(But) we must pretend
Your broken wrist
Just happened when you fell off your bike
Your bike, your bike

Chorus
This is the reason
The sanctuary hums
'God save us, God save us
From your chosen ones'

Verse 2
Smile, wave
Protect his pulpit from all suffering
He'll make celebrity the end game
So much more valuable than family
Not even violence can betray...

As long as you keep your lips
Locked up till the end of this age
Even if you won't
It's your word up against what he'll say
He'll say, he'll say

(Chorus)
Bridge
Cry, girl
Become the wails of victims unheard
Your tears have given you the calm nerve
So if they're asking you to hide your bane
You just keep screaming to the grave

(Chorus) x2
You'll be the reason
The helpless celebrate
He takes us, He takes us
From our violent shame

(Chorus)
This is the reason
The helpless celebrate
He takes us, He takes us
From our violent shame

You'll be the reason
The sanctuary hums
'God save us, God save us
From your chosen ones'
