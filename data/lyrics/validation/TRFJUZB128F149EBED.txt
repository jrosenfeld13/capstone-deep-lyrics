I am the hungry wolf
And run endlessly with my mate
I see the gutter feed on the foolish
Outrun and kill the strong

At daybreak I roam
Awake to who follows me
I roam, I roam

I am the hungry wolf
And run endlessly with my mate
Welcome to the dripping jaws
The alter of your death

At daybreak I roam
Ready to tear up the world
I roam, I roam

The hungry wolf
Stares from the hill
At the villagers around the fire
She loves her mate
As he loves her
And they live together for life

I am the hungry wolf
And run endlessly with my mate
Look across the street, my friend
We're waiting for you to slow down

At daybreak I roam
Eyes in the back of my head
I roam, I roam

The hungry wolf
Stares from the hill
At the villagers around the fire
She loves her mate
As he loves her
And they live together for life

I am the hungry wolf
And run endlessly with my mate
I see the gutter feed on the foolish
Outrun and kill the strong

At daybreak I roam
Ready to tear up the world
I roam, I roam
