I turned on the telly
When I got home from school
You were there in your wellies
And a yellow Cagoule
You opened my eyes
To the birds and the bees
I loved you so
My Really Wild Show
On the BBC

Michaela Strachan you broke my heart
Michaela Strachan you tore me apart
Michaela Strachan you broke my heart
When I was twelve

(x2)
It ain't gonna happen
For me and the Strachan

I used to want to be a vet
Just so I'd see you one day
You put the meaning in wacaday

I found myself working
In a shop at sixteen
It never stopped hurting
To miss you on TV

I'll always remember all those times that we had
You helped me to sleep
I fancied you heaps
And so did my dad

Michaela Strachan you broke my heart
Michaela Strachan you tore me apart
Michaela Strachan you broke my heart
When I was twelve

(x2)
It ain't gonna happen
For me and the Strachan

It ain't gonna happen

(x2)
It ain't gonna happen
For me and the Strachan

I used to want to be a vet
Just so I'd see you one day
You put the meaning in wacaday
