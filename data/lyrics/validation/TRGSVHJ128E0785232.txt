[Verse 1]
I can't stand to think about
A heart so big it hurts like hell
Oh my God, I gave my best
But for three whole years to end like this

Well do you want to fall apart
I can't stop if you can't start
Do you want to fall apart
I could if you can try to fix what I've undone
Cause I hate what I've become

[Chorus]
You know me
Or you think you do you, you just don't seem to see
I've been waiting all this time to be
Something I can't define. So let's
Cause a scene
Clap our hands and stomp our feet or something
Yeah something
I've just got to get myself over me

[Verse 2]
I could stand to do without
All the people I have left behind
What's the point in going 'round
When it's a straight line baby, a straight line down

So let's make a list of who we need
And it's not much, if anything
Let's make a list of who we need
And we'll throw it away cause we don't need anyone
No, we don't need anyone

[Chorus]
You know me
Or you think you do, you just don't seem to see
I've been waiting all this time to be
Something I can't define. So let's
Cause a scene
Clap our hands and stomp our feet or something
Yeah something
I've just got to get myself over me

And I hate what I've become

[Bridge]
You know the night life is just not for me
Cause all you really need are a few good friends
I don't want to go out and be on my own
You know they started something I can't stand

You leave for the city, well count me out
Cause all this time is wasted on
Well, everything I've done

[Chorus]
You know me
Or you think you do you, you just don't seem to see
I've been waiting all this time to be
Something I can't define. So let's
Cause a scene
Clap our hands and stomp our feet or something
Yeah something
I've just got to get myself over me
You know me
Or you think you do you, you just don't seem to see
I've been waiting all this time to be
Something I can't define. So let's
Cause a scene
Clap our hands and stomp our feet or something
Yeah something
I've just got to get myself over me, yeah
Over me, yeah. Over me
