In the year of the angels
You were famous for your kiss
In the year of the robins
You were lost in the midst of your bleeding heart

In the time of loners
Twenty lies beyond
It's been years since you left me
It's been hard living without you

You're alone, one last loner
And I'm a loner too
And I believe you're filled with sin
Like me loner blue

In the year of angels
You were lonely for a kiss
In the time of sunshine
You were lost in the midst of your beating heart
