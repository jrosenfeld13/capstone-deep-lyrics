There's a light in the window
That tells me you're home
I've a dove that you hear
That I call my own
There's a time I remember
When I called you mine
Memories of your kisses
Much sweeter than wine

(chorus)
Maybe I won't be afraid to love somebody new
Maybe I can open up my heart
Then I won't drown in my own tears
Drown in my own tears

There's a place where we used to meet
Everyday
And a time when we used to love
Everyway
All that's left is the pieces
Of a broken heart
And a house where nobody lives
Since we're apart

(chorus)
There's a light in the window
That tells me you're home
I've a dove that you hear
That I call my own
There's a time I remember
When I called you mine
Memories of your kisses
Much sweeter than wine

(chorus)
Drown in my own tears
(fade)
