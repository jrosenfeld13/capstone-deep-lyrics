There's a cause for me to pause
Cause in our love there is a clause
Cause we belong to other hearts
Hold me back
Hold me back
Hold my will
Heart be still

You seem better than candy
My sugar dandy
I've got to stand back from the heat
Hold me back
Hold me back
Hold my will
Heart be still
Heart be still

Where we'll go no one knows
I feel weak when you do speak
It's like a rollercoaster at it's peak
Hold me back
Hold me back
Hold my will
Heart be still
Heart be still

I've got to get back
I've got to get back
I've got to get back on my feet
Just let me say my say
You're a friend I wanna keep

Where we go no one knows
Our unsaid love could be a scream
The finest dream I've ever seen
Your charm grabbed me by the arm

I've got to get back
I've got to get back
I've got to get back on my feet

I've got to get back
I've got to get back
Just let me say my say
You're a friend I wanna keep
