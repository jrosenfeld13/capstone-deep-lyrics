[Intro]
Man!
I saw this fine lady at the golf club the other day
See, I work nights so I can't make it to the real night club
So I go to golf clubs instead to get my swing on

So anyway
I was hittin' on this lady when this little boy
Came up screaming, "Mommy! Mommy! I want some ice cream!"
I wasn't gonna [?] this up, so luckily I had my Game Boy with me
So I grabbed the kid and I told him

[Chorus]
Hey little man, hey boy
Need you outta my way boy
You go play with my Game Boy
[?] with the playboy

Hey little man, hey boy
Need you outta my way boy
You go play with my Game Boy
[?] with the playboy

Hey little man, hey boy
Need you outta my way boy
You go play with my Game Boy
[?] with the playboy

Hey little man, hey boy
Need you outta my way boy
You go play with my Game Boy
[?] with the playboy

Hey little man, hey boy
Need you outta my way boy
You go play with my Game Boy
[?] with the playboy

[?] with my game son
You know what's up so don't play dumb
You gotta go can't stay son
'Cause I wanna see where ya came from

Hey little man, hey boy
Need you outta my way boy
You go play with my Game Boy
[?] with the playboy

[?] with my game son
You know what's up so don't play dumb
You gotta go can't stay son
'Cause I wanna see where ya came from

Hey little man, hey boy
Need you outta my way boy
You go play with my Game Boy
[?] with the playboy

[?] with my game son
You know what's up so don't play dumb
You gotta go can't stay son
'Cause I wanna see where ya came from

Hey little man, hey boy
Need you outta my way boy
You go play with my Game Boy
[?] with the playboy

[?] with my game son
You know what's up so don't play dumb
You gotta go can't stay son
'Cause I wanna see where ya came from

Hey little man, hey boy
Need you outta my way boy
You go play with my Game Boy
[?] with the playboy

[?] with my game son
You know what's up so don't play dumb
You gotta go can't stay son
'Cause I wanna see where ya came from

Hey little man, hey boy
Need you outta my way boy
You go play with my Game Boy
[?] with the playboy

[?] with my game son
You know what's up so don't play dumb
You gotta go can't stay son
'Cause I wanna see where ya came from
