*girlie girlie you're the one i want
I want you in the kitchen
And i want you when i wash
Girlie girlie you're the one i need
Goody good girls are good for me

Cleaning makes no meaning when you look upon the cieling
Instead i like to be in bed and sleep until the evening
I have to find a girl who understands the way i feel
You're the one for me

*girlie girlie..

**oh you're so sweet-girlie girlie
Baking cookies for me-girlie girlie
Oh you're so fine-girlie girlie
Goody good girls are good for me

I've tried to flirt with dirty shirt although my sox are filthy
I have tried to find a girl real fast and i hope she's under thirty
Cooking cleaning do the dishes i will make you see
You're the one for me

*girlie girlie ..

**oh you're so..
