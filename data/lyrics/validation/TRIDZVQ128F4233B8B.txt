Way down South, in Birmingham
I mean South, in Alabam'
There's a place
Where people go to dance the night away

It's a junction
Where the town folk meet
At each function in their best they'll greet you

Way down South, in Birmingham
I mean South, in Alabam'
That old place

Boop bop, Boop Bop
Boop bop, Boop Bop
Boop bop, Boop Bop
Boop bop, Boop Bop

Way down South, in Birmingham
I mean South, in Alabam'
'Ans old place
Where people go to dance the night away
They all drive or walk for miles
To get blues - that southern style
So blue - it'll make you want to dance the night away
Tuxedo Junction - where I want to be
