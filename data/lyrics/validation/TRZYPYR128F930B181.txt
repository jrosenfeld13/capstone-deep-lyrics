You're one of a kind, yeah
I guess you are, baby
One, hey yeah

When I saw you from across the room
I knew you'd be the one I choose
To spend my life with and have kids with
I felt a strong affinity, complete exchange of energy
Flow right through me like poetry

Mesmerized by the twinkle in your eyes
So surprised about the way I'm feeling, yeah
Energized, I caught the voltage of your love
So alive, this love can't be denied

You are not like the others
A waste of time, can't be bothered
You stand out, baby
You're one of a kind, yeah

You are different from the rest
Out of all of them, you are the best
I'm glad to say, baby
You're one of a kind, yeah

Like an oasis in a desert plain
You came my way and erased my pain
Baby, baby, your kisses lubricates my soul
Your, your, your, your touch rejuvenates me
Illuminated me and it makes me glow

Mesmerized, baby, baby, I'm mesmerized
So surprised about the way I'm feeling
Energized, caught the voltage of your love
So alive, I'm so alive baby
This love can't be denied

You are not like the others
A waste of time, can't be bothered
You stand out, baby
You're one of a kind, yeah

You are different from the rest
Out of all of them, you are the best
I'm glad to say, baby
You're one of a kind, yeah

(Shoo bee do bop)
I used to be a pessimist
(Shoo bee do bop)
Now I'm a born again optimist

(Shoo bee do bop bop)
Because of you, baby
You're one of a kind, yeah

(Shoo bee do bop)
My faith is renewed, yeah
(Shoo bee do bop)
Is renewed by love

(Shoo bee do bop bop)
You must be sent from up above
You're one of a kind, yeah

You are not like the others
A waste of time, can't be bothered
You stand out, baby
You're one of a kind, yeah

You are different from the rest
Out of all of them, you are the best
I'm glad to say, baby
You're one of a kind, yeah
