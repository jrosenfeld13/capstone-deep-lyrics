[Chorus]
You count them one, two three
You look so cute when you get that mad
You drain the life from me and it feels oh so good
The looks you give are so contagious
The way we move is so outrageous
Just let me in (wasting time)
Just let me in Let's make it look right
So stay up and get down
Sleep's just time spent wasting time
So get down, get down
Let's make it happen all night

[Verse 2]
You're moving close, my pulse is racing
We're getting close, yeah I can taste it
I've never done it quite like this
So slow it down now, just slow it down

[Chorus]
The looks you give are so contagious
The way we move is so outrageous
Just let me in (wasting time)
Just let me in, Let me in
So stay up and get down
Sleep's just time spent wasting time
So get down, get down
Let's make it happen all night
You count them one, two three
You look so cute when you get that mad
You drain the life from me and it feels oh so good
You count them one, two three
You look so cute when you get that mad
You drain the life from me and it feels oh so good
So stay up and get down
Sleep's just time spent wasting time
So get down, get down
Let's make it happen all night
