[Intro: Mike]
I don't wanna fight no more baby
Just meet me half way
Help me fellas

[Pre-Chorus]
You say
The things you feel are right
But I feel those things are wrong
And for that we fight all night long

[Verse 1]
There you go
Tripping over the things I say
'Cause things ain't goin your way
Friends say I should leave
But love forces me to stay
I try
Try to give you all of my time
But still I feel denied
When we fuss and fight
I keep asking myself why
Every single day I pray that
Things will turn out right
'Cause where it seems we go problems to arrive
What must we do
Do to make each other see
This realtionship should be
All about me for you and you for me

[Chorus]
You say
The things you feel are right
But I feel those things are wrong
And for that we fight all night long
If you
Knew all the things I knew
Walked around inside my shoes
We can make our love flow all night long

[Verse 2]
What's the deal
Do you ever feel the things that I feel
I'm tryin' to keep our loving for real
Even though it seems we don't seem eye to eye
You know
I never wanna see you go
Your the best I've ever known
So tell me just how long this is gonna take to be
Happy every day and every night just like we should
Cuz to be happy with you all my life I know I could
What must I do
Do to make you trust in me
Is that a possibility
Don't you know that it hurts me when we disagree

[Chorus]
You say
The things you feel are right
But I feel those things are wrong
And for that we fight all night long
If you
Knew all the things I knew
Walked around inside my shoes
We can make our love flow all night long

[Chorus]
You say
The things you feel are right
But I feel those things are wrong
And for that we fight all night long
If you
Knew all the things I knew
Walked around inside my shoes
We can make our love flow all night long

[Bridge]
Baby today
We'll put the past behind
Let's not waste no time
We can do it
Ohhhh
All night long
I like it when you do
Do those things you do (to me)
All night
If you feel

[Interlude: Mike]
Walk with me baby
Don't you wanna do that
Try to meet me half way
I really need you
Huh, are you listening

[Outro]
You say
The things you feel are right
But I feel those things are wrong
And for that we fight all night long
If you
Knew all the things I knew
Walked around inside my shoes
We can make our love flow all night long
