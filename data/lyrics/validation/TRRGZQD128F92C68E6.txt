Ooh...

Just as long as I'm in this world
I'll be, I'll be a light of this
Just as long as I'm in this world
I'll be, I'll be a light of this
Just as long as I'm in this world
I'll be, I'll be a light of this
Just as long as I'm in this world
I'll be, I'll be a light of this world

Ooh...

Sometimes I feel this earth is not my home
And everything I know is an illusion
So many dreams have been broken and it seems
So much time is wasted in confusion

But I don't know if pain makes me stronger
But if you're beside me tonight

Just as long as I'm in this world
I'll be, I'll be a light of this
Just as long as I'm in this world
I'll be, I'll be a light of this
Just as long as I'm in this world
I'll be, I'll be a light of this
Just as long as I'm in this world
I'll be, I'll be a light of this world

Ooh...

Some that I love I will never see again
Never see again in this world
The one I was I will never be again
No use to pretend that I'm the same girl

But I won't wait for you to believe me
And if time will give me today
I won't wait for heaven to receive me
I will pray, I will say

Just as long as I'm in this world
I'll be, I'll be a light of this
Just as long as I'm in this world
I'll be, I'll be a light of this
Just as long as I'm in this world
I'll be, I'll be a light of this
Just as long as I'm in this world
I'll be, I'll be a light of this world

Ooh...
