Dwelling inside was an anger
An anger that grew into hatred
Grinding
Turning inside of me
Seeking
Finding the need to feed
On my soul
It now appears I've lost control
Of my mind
It's now begun to tear and grind
The pain
Its destination my brain
Can't hide from being eaten from inside
Iinsiiiide

Originating deep within
A heart that is now cold and dead
Tearing its way through my organs
Leaving nothing but shreds
Ripping
Tissue is torn away
Severing
Parts and veins in the way
My insides
Are on the outside of me
My bones
Now shatter and explode
The pain
Its destination my brain
Can't hide from
Being eaten from inside

Left on the ground is my head
Waiting for the final blow
Brain violently corroding
The end won't come fast only slow
Seeing
What's left of my body
Drowning
Blood is surrounding me
My skull
Melts revealing my brain
Exploding
My body's imploding
The pain
Its destination my brain
I've died
I've been eaten from inside
