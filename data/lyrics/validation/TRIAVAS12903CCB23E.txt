I lock my door as the sun does rise
As i observe the things that i despise
I write down all the things i see
I check my notes they're describing me

My tears of joy are sad to you
I can't feel hope like you do
I always pray that the light will stay
To light my soul, my soul is gray
My soul is gray

See the tears in my eyes
They won't tell you no lies
As you read my history
See my fears go away
As you thought me to pray
The healing the mystery

If i could chose what i would do
I'd stay in bed the whole life through
The shiver me life once gave
Is as exciting as my future grave
My future grave

I gaze alone at the setting sun
I know today that i have won
