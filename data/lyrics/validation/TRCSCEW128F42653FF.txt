Well I don't know, but I've been told
Two sides to every story
The one is right and the other is wrong
Guess it depends which side your on

'Cause one man's blessing is another man's curse
One man's drink is another man's thirst
One man's pleasure is another man's pain
One man's loss is another man's gain
One man's lie is another man's truth
There's two sides to every story

Well, good guys, bad guys all the same
Good guys win, bad guys get blamed
I don't care what side you're on
You might be right, you might be wrong

And one man's freedom is another man's prison
One man's honor is another man's shame
One man's guilty, one man isn't
There's two sides to every story

One man's heaven is another man's hell
One man's buy is another man's sell
One man's day is another man's night
One man's peace is another one's fight
One man's loss is another one's glory (glory)
There's two sides to every story

There's two sides to every story

There's two sides (two sides) to every story
