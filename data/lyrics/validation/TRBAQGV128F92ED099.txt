I've got the sun
Shine
In my hands
You've got the sun
Shine
In your hands
We've got the sun
Shine
In our hands
Now let it shine all over this land

You've got to love
Love
One another
Whoa, shine
Shine
On your brother
And the whole
World
Will discover
In the arms of every woman and man

We've got the sun
Shine
In our hands
I've got the sun
Shine
In my hands
You've got the sun
Shine
In your hands
Now let it shine all over this land

Holy, holy
Glory, glory
Hallelujah
I believe it now
Holy, holy
Glory, glory
You can give without receiving
