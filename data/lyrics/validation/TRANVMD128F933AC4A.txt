So, you've come
Look down, my angel eyes
Hold my gun
My heart can't recognise home

And you'll say run
I think I heard you come undone

You lose your way
I know I can't feel that way

You say shut up
Don't let it shine

I'll take your heart if
You take mine

Break down in defence
To your consequence
Break down to the sound
I know I hear it now

What's on your mind?
(2x's)

You say shut up
Don't let it shine
I'll take your heart if
You take mine

Break down in defence
To your consequence
Break down to the sound
I know I hear it now
I know I hear it now
