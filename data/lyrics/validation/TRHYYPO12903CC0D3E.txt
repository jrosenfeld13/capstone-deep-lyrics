Love, you cast me aside
Threw me away
Are you saving me up for a rainy day?
Tell me can you explain
Why I'm feeling this pain
Hewn inside my heart

First, you make me your slave
To your every command
How you walked out on me
I don't understand
If you only would stay
Then I know you would say
"That will be all right"

Love, you cast me aside
Threw me away
Are you saving me up for a rainy?
First, you make me feel fine
Now, you make me feel blue
What did I do to you?
Ah ah
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
Clouds won't you go away
If you only would stay
Then I know you would say
"That will be all right"
Love, you cast me aside
You threw me away
Are you saving me up for a rainy day?
First, you make me feel fine
Now, I'm feeling so blue
What did I do to you?
Oooh, whoa whoa

You cast me aside
You took all my dreams
And you broke them in two
What did I do to you?
You cast me aside
Ahhhhhhhhh
Oooh whoa
What did I do to you?
