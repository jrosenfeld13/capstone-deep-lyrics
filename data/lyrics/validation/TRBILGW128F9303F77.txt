Even when your heart is aching*
Even when the clouds are fading I won't let you down
I will be around
You gotta let it go
Let the feelings grow
Don't need to run away
You gotta understand
I'll be here 'til the end
I'm here to stay
Let the feelings go
Let the feelings go when the music starts 'cause it feeds your soul
When the moon is bright then the feeling's right deep in your soul
Let the feelings go
Let the feelings go when the music starts 'cause it feeds your soul
When the moon is bright then the feeling's right deep in your soul
Even when your heart is aching
Even when the clouds are fading I won't let you down
I will be around
You gotta let it go
Let the feelings grow
Don't need to run away
You gotta understand
I'll be here 'til the end
I'm here to stay
Oh
Uh oh
Oh
Uh oh
Oh
Uh oh
Oh
Uh oh
Let the feelings go
Let the feelings go when the music starts 'cause it feeds your soul
When the moon is bright then the feeling's right deep in your soul
Let the feelings go
Let the feelings go when the music starts 'cause it feeds your soul
When the moon is bright then the feeling's right deep in your soul
Let the feelings go
Let the feelings go when the music starts 'cause it feeds your soul
When the moon is bright then the feeling's right deep in your soul
Let the feelings go
Let the feelings go when the music starts 'cause it feeds your soul
When the moon is bright then the feeling's right deep in your soul
Oh
Uh oh
Oh
