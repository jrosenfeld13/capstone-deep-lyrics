"AS the hordes of the night finally were defeated, nature was
Beginning on it's task to restore Dragonland to it's former
Grandeur and beauty. The sun reached the surface for the first
Time in a hundred years, revealing the scars the evil reign
Had bestowed upon the earth. But alas, we could yet again live
As the free people we once were. Thus, fulfilling all of the
Lost saviour prophecies on but one aspect, I knew my quest
Was far from finished. As I kneeled in the bloodslaked soil of
The battlefield, the sky itself seemed to open up an reach for
Me, call for me. After a moment of hesitance all was clear..."

As this eternal struggle has come to end
The light of life now shines upon us once again
But can we truly be free of tyranny and grief?
I see a thousand points of light reaching for me

Now nature grows and blooms and people live again
Yet this is not the end I feel it

This power given to me is more than I can bear
Unbidden flowing through my mind
Divine it is but it could ruin this world
I see a thousand points of light reaching for me

Now nature grows and blooms and people live again
Yet this is not the end I fear it

I am the one to end this game
This world will never be the same
I have the power in my hands
The Time has come to save all life
I'll do what it takes no more lies
I'll choose the destiny of Dragonland

A thousand points of light
The madness now have to end
I've yet to destroy the ones, the Gods
Responsible for this
A thousand points of light
My final quest is at hand
To let people live their lives in peace
Without Gods and without me

(Solo)

With great reluctance I reached into the light
I rise up to the skies enraged and full of might
They stand before me radiating azure-blue
I'll fight them till the end, yes, that's what I must do

And I shall rid this world of Gods to rule our lives
So now the end is here I know it

With all my force I strike them down
They scream in anguish as they drown
In fire they now turn to sand
They beg for mercy I give none
My live is over my quest done
I've saved all living here in Dragonland

A thousand points of light
The madness now it has end
I've yet to become one with
All one with universe
A thousand points of light
Dragonland is at peace
A thousand points of light
Is reaching for me
