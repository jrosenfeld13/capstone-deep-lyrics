Black destiny what's to fear
Torn from reality leave me be
Alone with the shadows from my past, a past wherein I will never last
A thick twisted voice I hear, it fills my mind with despair
The silent sadness overwhelmes me
Calling, tempting, die with me
Will I ever find the strength to destroy all illusions
Will I ever find the courage to break all the mirrors
Oh yes, I will. Deeper and deeper into my mind I fight desperatly for an end
I'm torn apart, kill the sane
Am I free, in death's name
Chained to the lie called life a vast landscape has poisoned me my eyes bleed
I can not see black sight, and black is thee
Too many years of waiting
Too many years of hunger
Too many years of restlessness
This thy black destiny
Deeper and deeper into my mind, I fight desperatly for an end

Chained to the lie called life, a vast landscape has poisoned me
My eyes bleed, I can not see
Black sight, and black is thee
Too many years of waiting
Too many years of hunger
Too many years of restlessness
This thy black destiny:
