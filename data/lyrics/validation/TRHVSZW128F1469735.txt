Every day is a Saturday, in the month of Spring
Seems the world is full of girls
Lookin' out for that love thing
The hood's down, we're cruising downtown
Just hangin' with my friends
The radio's ready to blow
We're getting in that vibe again

[Chorus]
When your body keeps swaying side to side
Your spirit is free, it feels good to be alive
Oh yeah, that's the swing (swing)
When you're happy to face the day with a smile
Open your heart, let somebody inside
Oh yeah, that's the swing (swing)

Everyone is having fun, like a holiday yeah
Plain to see she's the one for me
Don't need words to communicate
The music's loud, we're foolin' around
Just getting in the groove yeah
The sun's out, a lot of people about
We're checking out the views

[Chorus]
When your body keeps swaying side to side
Your spirit is free, it feels good to be alive
Oh yeah, that's the swing (swing)
When you're happy to face the day with a smile
Open your heart, let somebody inside
Oh yeah, that's the swing (swing)

It's a kinda faith that you believe
To free your soul to fly
Kinda hope that makes you see
Your dreams can come to life

Here I am and I'm gonna try to make you understand
'Bout the things that I'm feelin'
'Cos the swing's got me reelin'
Try thinkin' about the things that make you happy
Keep your dreams alive, people this is how it can be
When you think that we're just hangin' and we're doin' bad
We're just feelin' things that you never felt and never had
'Cos when you wake up in the mornin' and your soul's singin'
That's why you're swing it

[Chorus]
When your body keeps swaying side to side
Your spirit is free, it feels good to be alive
Oh yeah, that's the swing (swing)
When you're happy to face the day with a smile (when you're happy)
Open your heart, let somebody inside
That's the swing (swing)
