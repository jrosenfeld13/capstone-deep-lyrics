May seem peculiar
How I think o'you
If you want me, darlin'
Here's what you must do
You gotta give me
'cause I can't give the best
Unless I got room to move

If you want me darlin'
Take me how you can
I'll be circulating
'cause that's the way I am
You gotta give me
'cause I can't give the best
Unless I got room to move
