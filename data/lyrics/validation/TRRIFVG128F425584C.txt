You think you're scaring me
Oh God you only bore me
You think you are making me any happier

You smile, you are biting me
I think you just beg me
I think you are begging me to have happiness with you

You think you're porn star
You act like a porn god
You say you are pornostar
You ain't no better than I

You think you're scaring me
Oh god you only bore me
You think you are making me any happier

You think I think you are a star
Stars've always been so far
You think I'm happy?
I ain't happy now

You better deny it
