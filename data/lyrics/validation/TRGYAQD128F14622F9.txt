[Verse 1]
Deep down in Jamaica, close to Mandeville
Back up in the woods, on top of a hill
There stood an old hut made of earth and wood
There lived a country boy named, Johnny B. Goode
He never learned to read and write so well
But he could play his guitar like ringin' a bell, yell

[Chorus]
I said go, go Johnny!
Johnny be good tonight! Yeah ah
I said go, go Johnny!
Johnny B. Goode...

[Verse 2]
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Dee-oo-doo, dee-oo-doo
Sitting in a tree in the railroad track
Dee-oo-doo, dee-oo-doo
Old engineer in the train sittin' in the shade
Choo-chooooo
Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made
Dee-oo-doo, dee-oo-doo
People passing by would stop and say:
Dee-oo-doo, dee-oo-doo
"Oh my, oh my, oh what a boy can play"

[Chorus]
I said go, go Johnny!
Johnny be good tonight!
Said go, go Johnny!
Johnny B. Goode...

[Musical Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Mama said: "Son, you gotta be a man
Go, be a man
You got to be the leader of a reggae band"
Skengay skengay, skengay skengay
People comin' in from miles around
Dee-oo-doo, dee-oo-doo
To hear you play until the sun goes down
Dee-oo-doo, dee-oo-doo
Boy, someday your name will be in the lights
Dee-oo-doo, dee-oo-doo
Sayin' "JOHNNY - JOHNNY B. GOODE TONITE"

[Chorus]
I said go, go Johnny!
Johnny be good tonight! Yeah ah
Said go, go Johnny!
Johnny you better be good

[Outro]
Said go, go Johnny!
Johnny be good tonight!
Play! Go Johnny!
Johnny B. Goode...
I said go go, go, go go Johnny!
Johnny be good tonight!
