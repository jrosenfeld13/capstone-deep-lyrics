This train I ride is heading up
Gonna shoot the moon for the stars above
And all those angels in the sky
Gonna point me out I'm gonna tell you why

And if you need some further proof
That I don't lie that I'm telling the truth
Then look me squarely in the eyes
These eyes of love don't tell no lies

'Cause final love is here that final love is here
Final love final love that final love is here

If I had rivals for your heart
Would you take my side or would you set me apart
If you found me living on my bended knees
Would you take my side or would our love cease

'Cause final love is here that final love is here
Final love final love that final love is here

This train I ride is heading up
There's a silver spoon in my loving cup
And all those angels won't deny
We're gonna reach those diamonds in the sky

'Cause final love is here that final love is here
Final love final love that final love is here
