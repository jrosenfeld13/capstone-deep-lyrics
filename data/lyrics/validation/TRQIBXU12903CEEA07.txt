"Are you all sitting comftybold two square on your botty? Then I'll begin "

Once upon a time in a land of greens
Where the sky was silky soft
And full of colored dreams
Deep inside a rainbow
Lived Happiness Stan
In a small Victorian charabanc

Evening will be here quite soon
Stan can sit and watch the moon
Watching as the white light
Slowly makes the night bright
Hours slipping by while time stands still

Think of black and black will think of you
It's coloured Stan the bruises
Of the darkness that we knew
For black had stolen half the moon away
