Cough up blood, cough up dust
Remember who you can trust
Cough up lungs, cough up smoke
Caged life is just a joke

In a church hall, in a shopping mall
Are the secrets and the pitfalls
Untold stories (void promises)
No one will ever know

Cough up blood, cough up dust
Remember who you can trust
Cough up lungs, cough up smoke
Caged life is just a joke

The ants march in and out of line
Forgetting who they meet, thinking of what they find
Forever running out of time
Marching in and out of line
But I won't let it this time

Cough up blood, cough up dust
Remember who you can trust
Cough up lungs, cough up smoke
Caged life is just a joke
It's a f**king joke

Cough up blood, cough it up
I'm coughing up blood
