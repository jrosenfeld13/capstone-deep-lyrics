[Verse 1]
I cannot be held responsible for blown behavior
I lost all contact with my only savior
No-one locked me out because I failed to phone up
I cannot bear to live forever like a loner

[Chorus]
Do not let go the coat

[Verse 2]
It is easy to be sad: when you lack a partner
But how would I react to a broken heart now
It is not really true rock and roll unless I am
Hanging onto you and when I hold it next time

[Chorus]
I will not let go the coat

[Verse 3]
I try to explain but you never understand it
I need your body but I cannot just demand it
I will not let go like a stray at heel
(Never let it out of your sight)
Every lonely wife knows the way I feel

[Chorus]
(Do not let go tonight)
Do not let go the coat
Never let go the coat

[Verse 4]
Your friends all pass for life is just a market
But you have to finish everything you started
So I live my life tearing down the runway
Sure to get the hang of hanging in there someday

[Chorus]
Do not let go the coat
Will  get no more chances - forget the war dances
Go blind and hang on  do not try the slang son
Never let go the coat
