Let me sing a song for you
That's never been sung before
All the words were meant for you
And never been said before

She kisses when she sleeps
She kisses when she's sleeping
Let me sing a song for you
A song that's worth the dreaming

Don't waste my time
This is it
This is really happening

What's the use in marigolds
These flowers are for you
All the lights go after burn
The sky it splits in two

I kiss her on her teeth
I kiss her on her teeth
Let me sing a song for you
That alters your belief

Don't waste my time
This is it
This is really happening
