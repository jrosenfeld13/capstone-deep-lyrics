You know what it means
That you'll soon be off
But you don't know where to -
And what comes before
You thought there'd be so much more
But the good films run out
Don't hang on
Just because you can
Now you must let go
As you fall astern
And we all prepare to yearn
For the one who once was
I'll think of the good
And work on the things we should -
Put an end to
Don't hang on
Just because you can
Now you must let go
Up somewhere
No place near
Far from here
I know that you are
