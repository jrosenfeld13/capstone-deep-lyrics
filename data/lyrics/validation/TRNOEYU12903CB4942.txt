Born in a coffin with lipstick on your cheek
I can't look away, I can't look away
Where have you been all night, your eyes look just like bullet holes
You can't see a thing, you can't see a thing

Here we are /out in the flesh/
In a dream and out of breath
You look like you're so ready to die

Look at you now
I can see you're barely breathing
Give me something to regret
Without a doubt
You're so pretty when you're bleeding
Only livin to forget

I woke up on lover's lane from a near death experience
What can I say? What can I say?
What are you waiting for? No one's ognna live forever
So come out and play, come out and play

Here we are /out in the flesh/
In a dream and out of breath
You look like you're so ready to die

Look at you now
I can see you're barely breathing
Give me something to regret
Without a doubt
You're so pretty when you're bleeding
Only livin to forget

I choose to live
While I'm still alive
Buy the ticket, take the ride
No one here gets out alive
Make the most out of your life
'Cause no one here get's out alive
No one get's out alive
No one gets out alive

Look at you now
I can see you're barely breathing
Give me something to regret
Without a doubt
You're so pretty when you're bleeding
Only livin to forget
