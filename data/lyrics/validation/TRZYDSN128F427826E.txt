Someday we will cross a bridge, someday we will see
That I can lean on you and you can put your weight on me
And every man will get a chance to be what a man wants to be
And every woman will look at her child and know that he's growing up free

The sun is gonna shine again
We'll make it around that bend
I'll walk one more mile with you Cos you're my friend
The sun is gonna shine again

Someday we will ride a train that only seats one class
To a destination that feels like home at last, oh I
Know it seems impossible now, I know it seems like a joke
But if there's no purpose, if there's no love
We hang at the end of a rope

And the sun is gonna shine again
We'll make it around that bend
We'll walk together, I swear
Cos you're my friend
The sun is gonna shine again

I have had my mind made up and I have been in doubt
But sometimes even I can see the light that will not be put out
And every man will hold up his head and know it won't get beaten back down
And every woman will be not afraid to walk on the very same road

And the sun is gonna shine again
We'll make it around that bend
We'll walk together, I swear
Cos you're my friend
The sun is gonna shine again

We'll walk together, I swear
Cos you're my friend
The sun is gonna shine again
