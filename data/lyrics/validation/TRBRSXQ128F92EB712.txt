No where to run
No where to go
Welcome to life damnation
Welcome to fun
Welcome to hope
Here is your invitation

Welcome to the gate
To the unknown fate
Waiting for a better day
Jesters dance around
Slowly growing old
Having party while they stay

No where to run
No where to go
Welcome to life damnation
Welcome to fun
Welcome to hope
Here is your invitation
