I am soft and silly and my name is Lillianaloo
And sir you're grace in action to my satisfaction
Well my mama she's savin' cause my daddy's a ravin' crazy gambler
But you my captain are grace in action to my satisfaction oo

Come along now and I'll be your woman if you'll be my captain
I'll be your woman if you'll be my captain
I'll be your woman if you'll be my fearless captain
Die! I would lay me down and die, for my captain

I am soft and silly and my name is Lillianaloo
And sir you're fair black fashion for this winter's passion oo
I've been sold by sailors, I've been worn by tailors, soldiers wound me
But you my captain are medication for my reputation

Come along now and I'll be your woman if you'll be my captain
I'll be your woman if you'll be my captain
I'll be your woman if you'll be my fearless captain
Die! I would lay me down and die, for my captain

Captain, say yes
