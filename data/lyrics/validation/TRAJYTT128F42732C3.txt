I'm lying alone with my head on the phone
Thinking of you 'til it hurts
I know you hurt to but what else can we do?
Tormented and torn apart

I wish I could carry your smile in my heart
For times when my life seems so low
It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring
When today doesn't really know (doesn't really know)

Chorus

I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you
I know you were right, believing for so long
I'm all out of love, what am I without you
I can't be too late to say I was oh so wrong

I want you to come back and carry me home
Away from these long lonely nights
I'm reaching for you, are you feeling it too
Does this feeling feel oh so right

And what would you say, if I call on you now
And said that I can't hold on?
There's no easy way, it gets harder each day
Please love me or I'll be gone

Chorus (times 2)
