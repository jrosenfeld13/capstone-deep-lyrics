Was it right when
It made the germs that
Would have put you away before the vaccine?

Or was even that nearsighted?

Like the x ray
That pinpointed the break
And showed us the baby before it was too late?

Before the meat turns
Toxic in our tubes
Beware the "fittest and the cycle"
That too often turns a stalemate

Crucify our father Edison
Sacrifice to the New Mysticism
Smash the bulbs that lengthen the day
Grind up the pills that took the fever away
Behold! The monsoons and the river snakes
