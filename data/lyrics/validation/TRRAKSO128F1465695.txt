Emerging
Through water
That's all we know

On hands and knees
Towards the shore
That's all we know

That's all we know
That's all
That's all we know
That's all

And he crawls
To the door
In the warm nurse
Where he walks
For the first time

Surrounded by dry clouds
He is leaving a trail

That's all we know
That's all
That's all we know
That's all

He climbs out of sleep
Holding on to the lamp
By his bedside table
The sunlight feeds
Of his radio

That's all we know
That's all
That's all we know
That's all
That's all we know
That's all
That's all we know
That's all

That's all we know
That's
All
