Even if they say, we'll never make it
Even if they tell us to give up
Even if they think, they could break it
I'm telling you they won't
We'll fight forever
They all don't like the picture
Of you and me together
I think they're just worried
'cause together we're so strong
It's like a fusion- we're only one body
We're one body and one soul

We go on searching just the perfect tones (yeah we'll find them)
We keep on finding words, creating songs
And one day we will feel that it is done (so sweet)
Believe me now, that we are on the run

Once we will write it the most beautiful song (dudududu)
We will conquer the world with my hum (dudududu)
Let us turn our story to a poem
And with it grow into one

Even if they say, we'll never make it
Even if they tell us to give up
Even if they think, they could break it
I'm telling you they won't
We'll fight forever

We go on searching just the perfect tones (yeah we'll find them)
We keep on finding words, creating songs
And one day we will feel that it is done (so sweet)
Believe me now, that we are on the run

Once we will write it the most beautiful song (dudududu)
We will conquer the world with my hum(dudududu)
Let us turn our story to a poem
And with it grow into one

I dreamt alone until you came along
Now I see that we're meant to be
Together in life (yeah)

Once we will write it the most beautiful song (dudududu)
We will conquer the world with my hum(dudududu)
Let us turn our story to a poem
And with it grow into one
