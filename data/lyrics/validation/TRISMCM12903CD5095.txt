[Intro]
If you should loo-oo-se me
Oh, yeah, you'll lose a good thing
If you should loo-oo-se me
Oh, yeah, you'll lose a good thing

[Verse 1]
You know I love you
Do anything for you
Just don't mistreat me
An I'll be good to you

[Chorus]
Because if you should loo-oo-se me
Oh, yeah, you'll lose a good thing

[Verse 2]
I'm giving you one more chance
For you to do right
If you'll only straighten up
We'll have a good life

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
This is my last time
Not asking any more
If you don't do right
I'm going to march out of that door
And if you don't be-lee-eeve me
Just try it, daddy
An you'll lose a good thing

[Outro][x2]
Just try it, daddy
An you'll lose a good thing
