[Verse 1]
Young, dumb, don't see a problem
Bloodshot, stare like a hoodlum
Simple as this  I'm in love with the risk
I know what I've done
But tell me what did I miss
So please don't save something
Waste not, save nothing
Lose the halo, don't need to resist
A lick of the lips and my grip on your hips

[Chorus 1]
Sick, sick, sick
Don't resist
Sick, sick, sick
Don't resist

[Verse 2]
First thing we succumb to
Shall erase and undo days of unrelease
If there's no police
Race to slip into whatever fits you
Make something, make someone
Beg on a knee, baby, baby please
Pout your bottom lip, while cracking the whip
You know what we want is candy to cum to

[Chorus 2]
Sick, sick, sick
Don't resist
Sick, sick, sick
Don't resist
Sick, sick, sick
Don't resist
Sick, sick, sick
Don't resist

[Bridge 1]
Eternal eclipse in the teeth of the risk
The tongue is a twist in perpetual bliss
Forever midnight
Forever midnight
Forever midnight
Forever

[Chorus 3]
Sick, sick, sick
Don't resist
Sick, sick, sick
Don't resist
Sick, sick, sick (I'm gonna take)
Don't resist (I don't wanna change)
Sick, sick, sick (I'm gonna take)
Don't resist (I don't wanna change)

[Bridge 2]
Baby, baby come out
C-c-c-c-come out
Baby, baby come out
C-c-c-c-come out

[Chorus 4]
Sick, sick, sick (I'm gonna take)
Don't resist (I don't wanna change)
Sick, sick, sick (I'm gonna take)
Don't resist (I don't wanna change)
Sick, sick, sick (I'm gonna take)
Don't resist (I don't wanna change)
Sick, sick, sick (I'm gonna take)
Don't resist (I don't wanna change)
