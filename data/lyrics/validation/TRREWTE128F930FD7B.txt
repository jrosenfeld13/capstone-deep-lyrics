She captured both rock and bird
Tied one to the leg of the other
Kept them as prisoners
Until they knew who was master

Then she threw them to the sky
Bird with unbarred wings disappeared
Rock with weighted heart returned

And rock became her anchor
And bird became her dream

Now she stands on the forest floor
Among the pines and towering firs
Rock still firm beneath her feet
Bird perched high above her

Singing songs of love's betrayal
'I offered you my endless skies
You countered with hoods and chains
This song I sing will be the last
To be inspired by your memory'
