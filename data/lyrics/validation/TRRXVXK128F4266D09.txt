Hey now, Eddie, all covered in confetti
C'mon over here and gimme some of your spaghetti
Hey now, Ed, you big biscuit head
Stop cracking your toes and get your pig out my bed
Hey now, Mack, with your head in a crack
Your body in a bag and your flamingo in a sack
Hey now, Chester, you big baby bester
Who cut's your clothes, the butcher or the jester?
Biscuit Head, why you have a biscuit head
Biscuit Head, a double-decker biscuit head
Biscuit Head, why you have a biscuit head
Biscuit Head, a noteworthy biscuit head
Hey now, Mabel, why you looking for a label?
I hope that you don't get eaten in the fable
Hey now, Nellie, with an anchor on your belly
Shall I compare peanut butter to your jelly?
Hey now, fellow Rocker, you're such a good talker
Can't chew gum and Rockerfeller from your locker
Hey now, Bill, did you get your fill?
C'mon up the stairs, come up and sign your will
Biscuit Head, why you have a biscuit head
Biscuit Head, a double-decker biscuit head
Biscuit Head, why you have a biscuit head
Biscuit Head, a noteworthy biscuit head
It's got you all laid up in bed
