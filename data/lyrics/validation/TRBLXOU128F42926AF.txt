Alive!
Dead!
I was inside your head
Had time well spent, I got your mind well bent
Snuck back into shade

Ooooooooooooooooooooo
You searched the globe for them perfect looks
And you searched for answers in all your books
And finally by diabolic accent here I am

Said it's just a diabolic
A diabolic scheme
(Diabolic scheme)

Said it's just a diabolic
A diabolic scheme
(Diabolic scheme)

That's me all right like purity white, and like viciousness black
I give a little then I take it back

Can you take it?
Ooooooooooooooooooooo
Can you take it? Yeah!
Ooooooooooooooooooooo

So what's the attraction? the sucker sing
Profilic depth or static cling?
Well from the greatness to greatnessis where I span
You have me for a moment grab on while you can

Said it's just a diabolic
A diabolic scheme
(Diabolic scheme)

Said it's just a diabolic
A diabolic scheme
(Diabolic scheme)

Diabolic
Diabolic scheme
Ooooo, oo, ooooo
Ooooo, oo, ooooo
Thank you!
