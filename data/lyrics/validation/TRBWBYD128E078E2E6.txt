[Intro]
Ooo baby, oh, yeah
Ooo you know about the after party
Oh yeah, alright

[Verse 1]
If you know you gon' be hitting the club tonight
Then you gotta make sure that your looking right
Getting all dressed up (to the nines), with a fresh haircut (and)

If your peeps intend on stayin' 'round yours tonight
You can jump into a cab there's no need to drive
Keep your glass filled up, (don't feel no pressure)
Cause tonight it's alright

[Pre-Hook]
And if your feeling lucky, might find yourself somebody tonight
Yeah, gon' just set it off, think it off
When you step into the party, the vibe is gon' be waiting inside
So just get onto the dance floor yeah

[Hook]
Stand up, everybody
Get up now, move your body
Straight up we're having a party
Cause tonight we're going all the way

Wild out, that's cool with me
Grab your coat girl, come chill with me
We'll pull up to the after party
Cause tonight we're going all the way

[Verse 2]
Now the DJ's on the mic and the crowd is hype
Everybody's out on the floor cause the vibe is right
Ladies shaking it up (getting down)
Fellas with their hands up (and)

You can tell this jam is straight off the hook tonight
And there ain't nobody in looking to fight
Tryna mess things up, cause we all came here to party tonight

[Pre-Hook]
You feel this party's started
Now everybody's out on the floor yeah
Just party on party on, we all came here to party
The drinks don't stop till 6 in the morning
Get onto the after party

[Hook 2x]

[Bridge]
And when the DJ stops at the break of dawn
We'll grab our coats and make our way up to the door
If it's no jams you want, then back to mine for sure
We'll have an after after party

[Hook 3x]
