Met on a Monday it was instant love
Come Tuesday morning there was no sign of
I searched the streets both high and low
I had no particular place to go
So I prowled the discos till the break of dawn
All the spots where Wednesday's child would never haunt
Searched every cat house that I could
Well I mean, she never deemed to be no Jenny be good

Now this ain't no whiskey - I'll make it plain
Just good old fashioned 'Lovers Pain'
I'm getting wild again
Just like a child again
I'm getting wild again
Just like a child again

Now it's Thursday, there's still no sign
I gotta take tougher steps to find this love of mine
So I combed the alleys, but I took my gun
You know you can never bee too careful
Down them hit and runs
Come Friday morning
I'm running out of patience and I ran outta dope
Thought I'd give it just a' one more try
'Fore I knew it, 'twas Saturday night now

This ain't no whiskey - or cocaine
Just good old fashioned 'Lovers Pain'
I'm getting wild again
Just like a child again
I'm getting wild again
Just like a child again

On rolled Sunday, I'm deep in despair
I'm so frustrated now I'm pulling out my hair
Walking by an oaken door I'm hit with a hymn
Thought, "Oh well, what the hell" and entered therein
Now wouldn't you know it as I stepped in that place
I saw my lover over there in the preachers embrace
I said "It's took me a week to find you child"
She said "I'm sorry my man, I found you too wild"

Now this ain't no whiskey - I'll make it plain
Just good old fashioned
I got the hell of a 'Lovers Pain'
I'm getting wild again
Just like a child again
I'm getting wild again
Just like a child again

You know she hit me with this wild again stuff
