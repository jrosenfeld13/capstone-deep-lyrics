What will we do, Gwyn?
What will we do, Gwyn?
Everything's a mess
Cause when I touch your arm, I can tell
Caught in this static
I think it's your heart, cause you don't want me around
Stocks are in the Dow
But you have to work now, so get out of bed

What will we do, Jen?
What will we do, Jenny?
Market crash, out of cash, we're in the poor house
Honey pie, don't 'cha cry, we're still together
Buy and sell, may as well invest in the weather
Honey pie, you know I'll love you forever

Stocks are in the Dow
But you have to work now, so get out of bed
Caught in this old room
I think its your heart, but you already know
What were we thinking?
What were we thinking?

Everything's a mess
Cause when I touch your arm, I can tell
You'll have to sell your car
Cause when I touch your arm, I can tell...
