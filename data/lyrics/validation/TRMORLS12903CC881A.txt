Oh
What have we done?
Is it true?
Is everything gone?
Why didn't we
Listen to you?
This could have had a different end
I know
So look over your shoulder, now
And tell me what you see
Does it make you proud
Or do you have any regrets?
Empty
Has this place become
Tortured spirits of yesterdays children are
Looking for a place to stay
I'm sorry
It's all over now
The thought of turning this around
Is nothing but an empty wish
So, look over your shoulder, now
And tell me what you see
Does it make you proud
Or do you have any regrets?
