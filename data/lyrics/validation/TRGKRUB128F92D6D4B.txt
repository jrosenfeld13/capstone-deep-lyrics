I know, I'm not your first love
There's been others before me
But I'm the one that's got you now
That's all that matters to me

And I know other arms have held you
I'm not jelous of these
Mine are thee arms that hold you now
That's all that matters to me

I came alive when you came along
You brought life into me
Honey, I don't care, what's in your past
Your as far as I can see

And I know other lips have kissed you
I know you've been thrilled and pleased
But mine are the lips that kiss you now
That's all that matters to me

Mine are the lips that kiss you now
That's all that matters to me
