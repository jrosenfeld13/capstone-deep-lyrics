I remember the future
Like it was only yesterday
Keep reminding myself to keep time
Cause time can slip away
And it waits for no man
And it waits for no woman
And it craves no war, turn back the clock
Just like we were before

I remember the future
Like it was only yesterday
Keep reminding myself to keep time
Cause time can slip away
And it waits for no man
And it waits for no woman
And it craves no war, turn back the clock
Just like we were before
I remember the future

I remember the future
Keep reminding myself to keep love
Cause love can slip away
And it waits for no man
And it waits for no woman
And it craves no war, turn back the clock
Just like we were before
I remember the future

Don't forget to look ahead
See what you will find
Don't lose touch, lost in space
Or are you lost inside your mind?
I remember the future
Don't forget
I remember the future
I remember the future
