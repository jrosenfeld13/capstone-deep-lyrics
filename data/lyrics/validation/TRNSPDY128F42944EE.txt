[Verse 1]
You get me down
But I like that
On the ground
But I like that

[Chorus]
Do you lie awake
Thinking of me?
Do you like dreaming?

[Verse 2]
You make that sound
And I like that
That place I've found
And I like that

[Chorus]
Do you lie awake
Thinking of me?
Do you like dreaming?

[Bridge]
Ba-ba-bam-bu-bu-da-da-dum
Ba-num-ba-ba-da-dum
Ba-num-ba-num-la-la-lalalalalalala

[Chorus]
Do you lie awake
Thinking of me?
Do you like dreaming?
