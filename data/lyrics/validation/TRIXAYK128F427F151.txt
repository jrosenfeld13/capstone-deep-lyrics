You never said a word
But the thousand things you should have said I heard
Made my heart stand still

I never thought I'd be
Any one of all the things you wanted of me
Now I know I will

You wordlessly whisper
That you're all alone and hoping
You silently signal
Could I come around some time

I'm not sure what that's for
But I'll use it
This is my art now, falling apart now
For love

I'm not sure what that's for
But I'll use it
This is my art now, falling apart now
For love, love

You never made me laugh
So much as in that silly photograph
What'd you think I saw?

I never had to dream
To understand what all your phrases mean
You mean so much more

You wordlessly whisper
That I make you feel like crying
You silently signal
Can I see the things you feel

You never talk about just what I mean to you
You never say you'd be unhappy if I moved
But I'll be there, oh I'll be there
Yes I'll be there, if you still want me
