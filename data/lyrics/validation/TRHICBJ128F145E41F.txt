Well I sacrificed to make you want me
Nothing for myself
Now your gonna leave me
For love with someone else

I cried my eyes all open yeah
Oh whether right or wrong
I need you baby
Well I'll keep on keeping on

Well I tried to do my best
[Don't do it)

Go down to the river
And there I'll be
I'm gonna jump in babe
'Cause you don't care about me
Open up your eyes today
Can't you see I love you
Open up your heart babe
Can't you see I need you

[Don't do it)
I'm no good without yer
[Don't do it)
Can't go on without yer
[Don't do it)
Life's no good without yer
