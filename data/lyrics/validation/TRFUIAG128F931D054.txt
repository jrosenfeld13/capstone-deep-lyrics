[Verse 1]
It was on our wedding day
When my heart began to stray
Never thought I'd make such a big mistake
Throw my life away

[Chorus 1]
I've gone days without food
I've went weeks without sleep
Keeping this in
I've got cuts I can't close
I've got wounds that won't heal
It's all your fault

[Verse 2]
I've been shattered and wrecked
My hands covered in blood
Scars on my skin
I forgot how to feel
Now I'm weak with deceit
My skin is paper thin

[Chorus 2]
We get through this
Feeling it, keeping it, holding it in
We go through this
Over and over again

[Verse 3]
I'd go years without tears
In a life with no fear
A life without you
Now I'm breaking my back as
I cover my tracks
My skin is paper thin once again

[Chorus 2]
We get through this
Feeling it, keeping it, holding it in
We go through this
Over and over again

[Chorus 1]
I've gone days without food
I've went weeks without sleep
Keeping this in
I've got cuts I can't close
I've got wounds that won't heal
It's all your fault


[Bridge]
My American dream
Wasn't ever to lie, steal and cheat
He won't leave her for this
What's the point?
I wish they would die

[Chorus 2]
We get through this
Feeling it, keeping it, holding it in
We go through this
Over and over again
We get through this
Feeling it, keeping it, holding it in
We go through this
Over and over again


[Outro]
This was not a test
This was all for real
This was not a test
This was all for real
This was not a test
This was all for real
This was not a test
This was all for real
