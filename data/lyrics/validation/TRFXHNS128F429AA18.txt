You were standing there in front of me that night
No one knew how much you meant to me on sight
You look so young and free
Oh boy this made for me
I loved you than I love you now I know
Smile at me that way my heart begins to say
I loved you than I love you now I know

You bring sunshine to my life
You bring love sweet love
And flowers blooming every little garden
You bring sunshine to my life
You bring love sweet love
I loved you than I love you now I know

I can not imagine life without you now
Never leave me nor deceive me made this far
Be with me anyway, make happy feel so gay
I loved you than I love you now I know
Remember what I say with you it's always may
I loved you than I love you now I know

You bring sunshine to my life
You bring love sweet love
And flowers blooming every little garden
You bring sunshine to my life
You bring love sweet love
I loved you than I love you now I know

Be with me anyway, make me happy feel so gay
I loved you than I love you now I know
Remember what I say with you it's always may
I loved you than I love you now I know
