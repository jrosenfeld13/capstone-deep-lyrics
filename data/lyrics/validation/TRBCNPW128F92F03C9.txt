Every time I can't get to sleep
I struggle with my conscience
Promises I cannot keep
Running out of patience

[Pre-Chorus:]
Every time I sleep I cannot keep my sanity (Sanity)
Every time I wake I cannot fake my anxiety

[Chorus:]
This is my nightmare  this is not a dream
This is my nightmare  this is not a dream

Fighting through the dead of the night
Waiting for the sun
Waking in a state of fright
Nowhere left to run

[Pre-Chorus:]
Every time I sleep I cannot keep my sanity (Sanity)
Every time I wake I cannot fake my anxiety

[Chorus:]
This is my nightmare  this is not a dream
This is my nightmare  this is not a dream

Try to dream of sunshine  all I see is rain
Senseless aggravation  messing with my brain
Messing with my brain

[Pre-Chorus:]
Every time I sleep I cannot keep my sanity (Sanity)
Every time I wake I cannot fake my anxiety

[Chorus:]
This is my nightmare  this is not a dream
This is my nightmare  this is not a dream
This is my nightmare  this is not a dream
This is my nightmare
