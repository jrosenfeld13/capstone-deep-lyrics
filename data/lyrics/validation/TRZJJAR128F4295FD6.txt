When I wake up in the morning gets me outta bed
Keeps me runnin' skippin' jumpin' like a little kid
You know sometimes I can hardly keep it inside
It overtakes me, overwhelms me, and I'm more alive
I did not get it from any woman or man
And it's okay if they don't always understand
It's very easy to get caught in circumstance
It's even easier to break out in a dance

Chorus:
JOY!
Unspeakable Joy!
'Cause they did not give it, they cannot take it away!
JOY!
Unspeakable Joy!
In my heart and I can't let them steal my
JOY!
Unspeakable Joy!
'Cause they did not give it , they cannot take it away!
JOY!
Unspeakable Joy!
'Cause they did not give it, they cannot take it away!

People ask my why this supernatural high
Seeing only sun when there's a cloudy sky
I know that trouble tries to surround me
But I've been given something greater deep inside me
I did not get it from any woman or man
And it's okay if they don't always understand
It's very easy to get caught in circumstance
It's even easier to break out in a dance

(Chorus)
JOY!(x3)

(Chorus)
JOY!
Unspeakable Joy!
'Cause they did not give it, they cannot take it away!
JOY!
Unspeakable Joy!
In my heart and I can't let them steal my
JOY! (x11)

(Chorus)
When I'm facing opposition of bad attitudes
We can see notions, dispositions of completely rude
When darkness thinks that it's outdone me
I must remember that the greater love's inside me
I did not get it from any woman or man
And it's okay if they don't always understand
It's very easy to get caught in circumstance
It's even easier to break out in a dance

(Chorus)
JOY!(x5)
