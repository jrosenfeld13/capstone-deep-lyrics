Heavens you are
Show me the shine, far
Built by the stars
Sold in her pawn shop
You are the one
I am the people
You are the church
I am the steeple
I saw the beauty of the world
Anyone can see it in the sky
On a clouded tree or anything
She's got the beauty of the world
On every inch of her skin
Her mind, her eyes
Your heart beats mine
In the mind of candy lands
And multi colored light
I'll try to find my mind
Ear to the ground
You can hear my sound
Screaming the sound
You can see my town
Built by the stars
Sealed with her ---- -----
Heavens you are
Show me the shine, far
I saw the beauty of the world
Anyone can see it in the sky
On a clouded tree or anything
Shes got the beauty of the world
On every inch of her skin
Her mind, her eyes
Your heart beats mine
In the mind of candy lands
And multi colored light
I'll try to find my mind
To find my mind
I saw the beauty of the world
Anyone can see it in the sky
On a clouded tree or anything
Shes got the beauty of the world
On every inch of her skin
Her mind her eyes
