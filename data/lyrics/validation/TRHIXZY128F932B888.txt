So long
I've been waiting for so long to come back to you
And it's been so long
That I hardly know what I should do
Cause it's been so long I'm hurting so god damn bad
But I know you're the best girl I ever had
And I told myself I didn't care about that
But I must, cause I'm frozen, and just can't react

And if you're saying you don't want me back
Well then I guess I'm leaving- "Oh no- come back!"
Well it's a simple decision, just say yes or no
Should I commit, or make like the wind and blow?

It's what you say, not how you say it
It's what really happened not how you portray it
It's what went down and not what's up
It's what in full motion and not what's stuck
It's what I feel, not what I say
But the ball's in your court anyway
I will hold you till you die
But then, I'll say goodbye
We do what we do and we drive and we drive
But I see through you because I'm
The strongest man alive
The strongest man alive
The strongest man alive
The strongest man alive
The strongest man alive
