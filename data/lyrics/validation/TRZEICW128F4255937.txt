Tell your good friends
You love them all doubtlessly
Wordless and senseless without reservation

Now's the time
Now's the time
Now's the time
Now's the time

Tell your good friends you love them without complaint
This road stretched for miles, straddled the countryside
Licking the hills with autumn decay
A fire that burned the bright gold covered forest down

This is the end of all that you thought was good

This is the end of reckless young energy
Breathless suspense and restless potential

This is the end
This is the end
This is the end
This is the end
This is the end
This is the end
This is the end
This is the end
This is the end
This is the end
This is the end
