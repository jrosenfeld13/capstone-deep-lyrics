Hey come on, man
They're draggin' down on main-street

I got a date with my baby about a half past eight
I don't have to worry, she won't be late
We're going down town where the cats all meet
We're going down town to drag main-street

Drag, drag, all night long
Drag, drag, never go home
Draggin' main till the break of dawn
Draggin' main-street all night long
(Everybody now let's go cats, all night long)

I got a hot rod Ford and a new exhaust
Four valve carburettor, I can't let lost
I put it in low, push the clutch in twice
I hear the cats holler, man alive

Drag, drag, all night long
Drag, drag, never go home
Draggin' main till the break of dawn
Draggin' main-street all night long

We'll all get together about half past nine
We'll all line up, side by side
When we get single, we throw it in low
And everybody holler go, man, go

Drag, drag, all night long
Drag, drag, never go home
Draggin' main till the break of dawn
Draggin' main-street all night long
