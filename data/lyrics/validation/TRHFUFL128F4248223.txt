The more I needed, the less you gave
I guess you thought that it worked that way
You never would listen
And now that I'm leavin'
You're not believin' a word I say

Chorus:
Oh, if you I think I won't go, watch me
Whoah, watch me prove you wrong today
You don't even know you lost me
You think I'd always stay
Oh, just watch me walk away

Don't tell me that it can't be done
That the world is colder without someone
You might get lonely, it might get crazy
But this time, baby, I'm good as gone

Repeat Chorus:
Cab on the street, hand on the door
Bag at my feet, need I say more?
Whoah, watch me

You don't even know you lost me
You think I'd always stay
Ooo, just watch me walk away
Just watch me walk away

Repeat Chorus:
