If I sent a rose to you for every time you made me blue
You'd have a room full of roses
If I sent a rose of white for every time I cried all night
You'd have a room full of roses
And if you took the petals and tore them fall apart
You'd be tearing at the roses just the way you tore my heart
And if someday you're feeling blue you could send some roses too
I don't want a room full of roses I just want my arms full of you
[ strings ]
And if someday you're feeling blue...
