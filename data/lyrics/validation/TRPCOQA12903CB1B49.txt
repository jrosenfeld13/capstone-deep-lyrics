All the songs to sing been sung
All the things to do been done
You got nowhere left to go

All the dreams to dream been dreamed
All the things to see been seen
Guess you better find your way back home

(Chorus:)
Dear ol' Sula
Knew I'd lose ya
I ain't been waitin' for you

All the things to feel been felt
All the pretty roses smelled
Sit back these days, get left behind

All the things to touch been touched
Baby grown, you learned so much
Pick a grape and turn it into wine

(Chorus)
All the songs to sing been sung
Can't take the honey if you don't get stung
Sting a bee, sing a bird a song

All the dreams to dream been dreamt
In my bones you never left
Ain't it bitter-sweet like home-sweet-home

(Chorus)
Dear ol' Sula
Knew I'd fool ya
I ain't been waiting
