Oh, sometimes I go walking
Through fields where we walked
Long ago in the sweet used to be
And the flowers still grow
But they don't smell as sweet
As they did when you picked them for me

And when I think of you
And the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever think back
On old memories like that
Or do I ever cross your mind?

Oh, how often I wish
That again I could kiss
Your sweet lips
Like I did long ago

And how often I long
For those two loving arms
That once held me so gentle and close

And when I think of you
And the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever think back
On old memories like that
Or do I ever cross your mind?

When old memories appear
My eyes won't stay clear
When I think
At all those happy times
Do you ever recaal
These old memories at all
Or do I ever Croos your mind?
