I still love the smell
The sweet smell of incense
Since the prayers and the bells
Made complete sense
Most of all I loved benediction
With an innocent child's conviction

Innocence
Sweet smell of innocence

I remember the lights
On the Christmas tree
And the waiting in turn
To see what he brought me
Oh the joy, the love and belief
And the Christmas lullabies
Singing me to sleep

Innocence
Sweet smell of innocence

Between the past
And whatever the future sends
I choose innocence

I remember the taste
Of the first kiss by the river
And the promises we'd keep
Forever and ever
I still love the smell
Of my innocent years
And I choose innocence
After my tears

Innocence
Sweet smell of innocence
Sweet smell of innocence
