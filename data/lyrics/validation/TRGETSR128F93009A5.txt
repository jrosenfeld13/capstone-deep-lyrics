The singer steps foward
He is not a torch song singer
He is not the embodiment of a soul brother
The unassuming troubadour
Sings to himself, softly
Not a word escaps his lips

They don't even try
His words would rather stay as long with him as possible
But his melody is for me and for you
I prefer to be alone when you're not around
Sometimes when I speak I can't stand the sound
Of my voice, this great big destructive machine
That takes too much time to say what it means

They tell me that my father is sick once again
With the plague that has decimated many old men
And I settle once more to a long sad dread
That reminds me that all loved ones will soon be dead

This is why I spent so much time making love to you
In your arms I was searching for things that were true
This is why I spent so much time making love to you
In your arms I was searching for things that were true

It's a memory of mine that I'm watching for a moment
I'm distracted just a bit by something less important
But I'm here for the part of the day that I crave;
I have caffiene in my system that makes me feel brave
The chill in the air is exactly what I want
With the sun on my face and my eyes tightly shut

It's important to me to remember these things
It's important to me to remember these things

I'm pretending we're in Prague sipping sodas by the square
Where the clock brought the masses to the ceremony there
Every hour little puppets spin around the clock face
Each figure represents one of the human race
And somehow we were always on time for the show
We'd arrive to the chaos of the people right below those large chiming bells that had a song to sing;
It's important for me to remember these things

Absinthe and sex
Black garters, cheap wine a hotel in Prague
A Moment in time
We are hungry and scary
And so much in love
We laugh at each other
As we push and we shove

The singer keeps singing. The singer keeps singing. The singer keeps singing. Keep singing, singer

That was the first time I really caught your eyes
In the small Italian shop with the coffee that you liked
And when our eyes met
I couldn't look away and my mouth opened to speak
But there wasn't much to say
I was frozen, transfixed by the way that you looked
But you grabbed me and pulled me into a small nook
Where we kissed like we had never tasted lips before
And I still wanted more

I still want more

I am frightened of what these words might bring;
But it's important for me to remember these things
I am frightened of what these words might bring;
But it's important for me to remember these things

You're too far away for this to make sense
And I feel in my heart ever mile of distance
And I don't him to stop 'cause
I know what that means
The Song will be over
And so will you and me
The Song will be over
And so will you and me

The song ...
