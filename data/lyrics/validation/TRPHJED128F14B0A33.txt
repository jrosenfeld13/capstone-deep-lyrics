There's some things she needs to verify
Could you bring forth an alibi?
Cause she was always in-between the jury and the Attorney

You give an ultimatum, and he will decline
And he was undecided most of the time
And he was always in-between his life and a movie Scene

And the weight of our words is what we don't Understand
All the tests and the parts of every woman and Every man

So with dignity and grace
All you have to raise
All the things in your mind that we
Play, and we play, and we play
The things that made you cry
That you forgave, let go by
Or you will push the one you love out of your Life

And there was always something she had to plan
She's always looking down in her left hand
She was always in-between her life and her Childhood dream

And there was always something he had to mend
You give a rule, you give him something to bend
And he was always in-between his word and what His word means

And the weight of our words is what we don't Understand
All the tests and the parts of every woman and every man

So with loyalty embraced
All you have to sustain
All the things in your mind
That will change they will change
The things that made you lie
You want to forget and let go by
You will push the one you love out of your life

So with dignity and grace
All you have to raise
All the things in your mind that we
Play, they replay, they replay
The things that made you cry
That you forgave, let go by
Or you will push the one you love out of your Life
