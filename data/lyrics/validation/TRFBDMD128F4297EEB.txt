Everyone that i see

Is making eyes at you and me

You see you've got this thing with walking

And me, I've got this thing about you

Everyone we pass by

Is stealing looks at you and I

We're not dressed right for the season

And we are smiling for no reason

It's really not a complicated thing

This knot between my stitching and your ring

But who knows if it'll ever be roken

For now there's no reason to call off the joking

It's really not a difficult thing to conceive

That all our clothing is matching accidentally

Or that babies are noticing motherly

Motions in you that are familiar and lovely

Everyone that I know

Is telling me to try take things slow

But even things that are wrong about you

Make my will too strong to doubt you

Everyone in the town

Is kind of wishing that this'll go down

But the jealous thay can't bless nothing

And they've got nothing but their suffering

It's really not a worry in my mind

That we'll be losing out or wasting any time

Because no one has got what I've got

And it's not like there's anything coming to stop us

It's as if there was a star that had told me so

That there was nothing left to do but to go back home

Now I ain't got no luck without you

It's just like an angel, this thing about you
