He was beautiful, beautiful to my eyes
From the moment I saw him sun filled the skies
He was so, so beautiful, beautiful just to hold
In my dreams he was springtime, winter was cold

How could I tell him what I so clearly could see?
Though I longed for him, another trusted me completely so I never could be free

Aah but it was beautiful, knowing now that he cared
I will always remember times that we shared
Now it's all over still the feelings linger on
For my dream keeps returning now that he's gone

For it was beautiful, beautiful, beautiful to be loved
