[Verse 1]
Don't look over my shoulder
I'm trying to read
Remember those intimate moments
Don't forget my privacy
We both have our orders
And a trick up the sleeve
There's no use pretending
You're alseep

The subject was roses
Quine geology
Deliberate notice
You're taking of me

Caution and danger
Are not family
Don't try turning the tables
On me!

[Chorus]
Too long and too lonely
For your eyes only
Secretly

[Verse 2]
Enjoy the paradox
You thinking I'm the fox
Can't you see
You personally

So many people know who you are
And they know how you've been looking
For your counterpart

We're chasing an echo
In sonic 3-D
If I laugh without joking
Make believe

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Enjoy the paradox
You thinking I'm the fox
Can't you see
You personally

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I like what you're showing
For your eyes only
Secretly
For your eyes only
