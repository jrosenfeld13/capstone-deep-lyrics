I sing for love of womankind
I have one in my heart and mind
Low, my heart aches for her

My soul swims naked in her streams
And in her meadows lies to dream
Hay, what need to waken

Her breast blow blossom in my hands
Her eyes shine moons on secret lands
As through my clouds her raven thoughts go flying

Space nearly parts and nearly joins
Love's magic song moans through her loins
Well hay, the lead long sweets of loving

May she glow always in her sun
Have nothing lost and nothing won
Oh, now what fear can chain her?

Oh blessed is he who joys and grieves
Who wears the coat the rainbow weaves
Lo, around his body
