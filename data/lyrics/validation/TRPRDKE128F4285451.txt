Another day is over
Hard work and play comes to an end
Evening shadows grow long and strong
As the dawn of night begins

Supper's over, prayers are said
The kids are tucked in and that's when
Gentle arms serve me love and peace of mind
It's man and wife time

I lay beside her and I realize
I am such a lucky man
For I've got everything that life
Has to offer in my hands

And I'm happy deep within
As I hold her in my hands
And she knows she's mine and only mine
At man and wife time

God has given me an angel for my very own
And she's brought a bit of heaven to my life
She's filled our home with love
She's taught our children right from wrong
And loved me so completely as my wife

The years go by like hours
And silver creeps into her hair
But the love in her eyes survives
Never dies, it's always there

Reassuring, telling me time has handled
With care what we share
And heaven can't offer more than what I find
At man and wife time

Man and wife time
Man and wife time
