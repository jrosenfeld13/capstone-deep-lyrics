I wish I was in Carrickfergus
Where the castle looks out to sea
I would swim over the deepest ocean
For my love to be with me

But the sea is wide
And I cannot swim over
Nor have I
The wings to fly

I wish I had
A handsome boatman
To ferry me over
My love and I

I wish I was
In the land of Eire
Where the mountains
Reach the sea

Where flowers blossom
As I do remember
Where my true love
Came to me

But the sea is wide
And I cannot swim over
Nor have I
The wings to fly

Ah, to be back now
In Carrickfergus
To be together
My love and I

To be together
My love... and I!
...Ooooooooh...

I wish I was
In Carrickfergus
To be together
My love and I!

I wish I was back home again.....
