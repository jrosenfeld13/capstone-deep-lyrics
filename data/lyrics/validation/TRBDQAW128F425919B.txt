Lovers live longer
Lovers live right
Lovers get crazy
Deep in the night
Lovers live longer
So let's stay together
'Cause the way we're going
We might live forever

Babe, I read it in the news today
How to live to be a ripe old age
Funny thing is what they had to say
I something we've known all along

Lovers live longer
Lovers live right
Lovers get crazy
Deep in the night
Lovers live longer
So lets stay together
'Cause the way we're going
We might live forever

I play your body like a fine guitar
You light me up just like a shining star
Let 'em guess how young or old we are
And we'll just love our lives away

Lovers live longer
Lovers live right
Lovers get crazy
Deep in the night
Lovers live longer
So let's stay together
'Cause the way we're going
We might live forever

Lovers live longer
So let's stay together
'Cause the way we're going
We might live forever
