I don't need You to exist just so I can feel good
They tell me that I should
Well, at the same time I admit
I like You best when You're understood so I can feel good

I thought I had You figured out
Then You broke all my silly rules
If there's supposed to be a little bit of doubt
Then You're right and I'm the fool

Oh my God, You're just not what I thought I knew was true
Oh no, what have I got myself into?
Did I, did I find the real You?

You put Your law inside my mind
In a place I cannot find subconsciously in line
You wrote it on a stone that's my heart
The fear of who You are, a truth I can't deny

I thought I had You figured out
Then You broke all my silly rules

Oh my God, You're just not what I thought I knew was true
Oh no, what have I got myself into?
Have I gone crazy over if's and maybe's, can I believe this?
Help my unbelief, my unbelief in You
Still want to find You

Oh my God, You're just not what I thought I knew was true
Oh no, what have I got myself into?
Have I gone crazy over if's and maybe's, can I believe this?
My unbelief, my unbelief in You
I found the real You

Well, I don't need You to exist so I can feel good
'Cause now I'm feeling good
I think I found the real You
