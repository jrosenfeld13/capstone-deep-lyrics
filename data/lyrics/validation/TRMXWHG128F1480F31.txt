Fear loves the night
Loves the night

Sunrise fear
Hold me closer
Sky is blown
Sky is blown

Fear; wild my spirit
Has no allies
Fusion

Here in my head

Dream everything
Making you beg
For mercy my friend

Down on your knees
Leaning my head against your head
It's a matter of conscious for you
That you did what you did

Just like the way you were
Never going down
Cos I'm never going back again
