[Words & Music: M. Kiske]

I've been had once again
The old betrayer did win
Felt small I thought to give in
And now I sleep with my sin

You say I just fly
On wings I have borrowed
I'm loaded to try
To shoot you with my sorrow

I'm alone tonight
No one there in sight
And I die to be the king of it all
To become the laugh of all rise and fall
Yes so tall!

You'll be the one that will bleed
If I fall over my feet
The love you need you must breed
The hate we build cuts so deep

If I could I sure would
Be all that you needed, it would all feel so good
But it doesn't come easy

I'm alone tonight
No one there in sight
And I die to be the king of it all
To become the laugh of all rise and fall
Yes so tall!

Your common sense is no defense sometimes
And if it ends all what it meant stays mine!

You say I just fly
On wings I have borrowed
I'm loaded to try
To shoot you with my sorrow

I'm alone tonight
No one there in sight
And I die to be the king of it all
To become the laugh of all rise and fall
Yes so tall!
