[Intro]
See you sitting there
Looking just a little like me
And we're both too proud to say anything real
Things are bad, but when you ask me if it's all over
Don't you know how I feel?

[Verse 1]
I remember back at BHS
Killing time on the courtyard steps
Thinking we were rebels (huh) but the world was unimpressed
It was just so easy to love you
The way you laughed at all my best defenses
Made the world's most convincing actor
Come back to his natural senses

[Chorus]
We ain't got much, but we got each other
And I can see that's all that I wanted all along

[Verse 2]
We were born in a minefield
In a world that's spinning like a roulette wheel
Where everybody is so scared but they can't slow down
You were the first good thing I let myself let in
And if I ever made you doubt I love you
Let me tell you what a fool I've been

[Chorus x2]
We ain't got much, but we got each other
And I can see that's all that I wanted all along
