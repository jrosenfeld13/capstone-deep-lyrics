In my dreams you told me that you really really care
In my dreams you told me it's a love that can't compare
So hold me, hold me, hold me, and never ever let me go

In my dreams you told me it's a love that can't compare
In my dreams you told me it's a love you want to share
So hold me, hold me, hold me, and never ever let me go

It seems that dreams are sometimes make believe
But now I know oh that they are real
For in my dreams you said you love me
And in reality you love me, love me, too

Now my dreams have come true, I'm as happy as can be
For I know, in my heart, you won't take this love from me
So hold me, hold me, hold me, and never ever let me go

It seems that dreams are sometimes make believe
But now I know oh that they are real
For in my dreams you said you love me
And in reality you love me, love me, too

Now my dreams have come true, I'm as happy as can be
For I know, in my heart, you won't take this love from me
So hold me, hold me, hold me, and never ever let me go
