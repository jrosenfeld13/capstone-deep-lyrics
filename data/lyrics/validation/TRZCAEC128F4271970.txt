Stay with me, my love
I hope you'll always be, right here by my side if ever I need you
Oh my love, in your arms I feel so safe and so secure
Everyday is such a perfect day to spend alone with you
I will follow you, will you follow me
Everyday and night that we know will be
I will stay with you, will you stay with me
Just one single tear in each passing year

With the dark, I see so very clearly now
All my fears are drifting by me so slowly now
Fading away
If I can say the night is long, but you are near
Close I am though I'm better for the smile you give and while I live
I will follow you, will you follow me
Every day and night that we know will be
I will stay with you, will you stay with me
Just one single tear in each passing year

I will follow you, will you follow me
Everyday and night that we know will be
I will stay with, you will you stay with me
Just one single tear in each passing year
