My shadow follows me
Wherever I should chance to go
John The Gun did say
If you should chance to meet me
As I wander to and fro
Sad would be your day

My life is mine and the light did shine
Till the guns they did go through me
So now I shall never fall
Ideals of peace are gold which fools have found
Upon the plains of war
I shall destroy them all

Put away your guns of steel
Death comes too soon for all
Your Master He may need you soon
And you must heed His call
I am the master of the games
That you will hardly ever play
So I will teach your sons
And if they should die
Before the evening of their span of days
Why, then they will die young

Put away your guns of steel
Death comes too soon for all
Your Master He may need you soon
And you must heed His call
I am the master of the games
That you will hardly ever play
So I will teach your sons
And if they should die
Before the evening of their span of days
Why, then they will die young

Condemn me not
For always will I play the game of war
In moonshine or in sun
And if any cross the path I choose to tread
Their chances they are poor
My name is John The Gun

Put away your guns of steel
Death comes too soon for all
Your Master He may need you soon
And you must heed His call
I am the master of the games
That you will hardly ever play
So I will teach your sons
And if they should die
Before the evening of their span of days
Why, then they will die young
