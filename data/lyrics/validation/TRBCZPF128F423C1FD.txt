[Intro]
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh

Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh

[Verse 1]
I've been found guilty
Of love in the first degree
But I don't mind
As long as you're here with me
A judge and jury
When they heard my plea
You know they sent me up the river
They put the blame on me

[Chorus]
Lock me up
Throw away the key
I'm just a prisoner of love
I'm doing time
I'm doing fine
I'm just a prisoner of love

[Hook]
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
(a prisoner of love)
Uh-huh, uh-huh

[Verse 2]
It was the sixteenth of September
A day I won't forget
I was hypnotized
Captured by your smile
I said of my conviction (conviction)
That it set me free
I'm doing time for my crime
In love's penitentiary

[Chorus]
Lock me up
Throw away the key
I'm just a prisoner of love
I'm doing time
I'm doing fine
I'm just a prisoner of love

[Hook]
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
(A prisoner of love)
Uh-huh, uh-huh

Uh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh

Uh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh

Love love love love
Love love love love

[Modified Chorus]
Lock me up
Throw away the key
I'm just a prisoner of love
I fell in love, mama, can't you see?
But I'm just a prisoner of love
A prisoner of love
A prisoner of love
Yeah
A prisoner of love
A prisoner of love

[Outro]
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Tie me up, chain me to a tree
Handcuff me
Tie me up, chain me to a tree
Handcuff me
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Tie me up, chain me to a tree
Handcuff me
Tie me up, chain me to a tree
Handcuff me
