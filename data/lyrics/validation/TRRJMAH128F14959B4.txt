I was movin' up an old dusty road
Wasn't botherin' nobody, wasn't botherin' a soul
I saw a woman's picture on a warnin' sign
She had the face of an angel and the eyes of a child

So I moved a little closer just to dig her face
Wondered why was it hangin' in this lonely place
There was fine print hangin' beneath her face
Like clothes hangin' on a line
Said watch out men 'cause this pretty girl
She's guilty of an awful crime
She'll take your love, she'll stand you up
She'll make you feel ten feet tall
She'll cut you down, you'll hit the ground
You, your heart and all

They call her the love love love love rustler
Yeah
They call her the love love love love love rustler
Yeah, that's what they call her
Alright

So, I moved on up on into town
Just to see if this rustler could be found
Well, lo and behold, to my surprise
She laid a kiss on me hotter than a brandin' iron
She came on tough, she came on strong
She calf-tied my soul, now I can't leave her alone

When she told me to buck, I buck
When to move, I move
When she told me to jump, I jump
When to woo, I woo
She dug her spurs into my mind and rode me to the ground
If I had the will or strength I'd crawl outta town

I love that love love love love rustler
I love the love love love love love rustler

Love rustler
She's got me
Let me up, baby
I got to get outta here
