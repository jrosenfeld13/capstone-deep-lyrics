It's Saturday night and all is well, going out drinking gonna raise some hell, skeezers in the back, stuffing their nose, pulling out, 8-balls from their pantyhose

Fighting and drinking on a Saturday night. Ain't no excuses, that's just our life
Fighting and drinking on a Saturday night. Ain't no excuses, that's just our life
Just our life
Just... Our... Life

Non-stop chillin', nothing to lose - Snickers - After hours with the Skarhead Crew, no money in my pocket, fist full of brews, non-stop chillin' is the life I choose

I'm drunk again
