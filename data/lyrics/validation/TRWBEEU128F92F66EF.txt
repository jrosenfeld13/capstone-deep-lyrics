Sun shines brightly
On my soul
Whenever I
Think of you

I'm faithful to the fight
Between the boy and the girl
I'm faithful to the night
To make me feel alright

So come on, come on, come on
Follow me down
So come on, come on, come on
Follow me down

It's hard to tell
Who's gonna love you the most
It's hard to discover
That they treat you like a ghost

So your faithful to the fight
Between the boy and the girl
You're faithful to the night
To make you feel alright

So come on, come on, come on
Follow me down
So come on, come on, come on
Follow me down
Oh, won't you follow me down

So rock me
And shock me
Reach me
And teach me
Baby, what's it gonna be
What's it gonna be?

So break me
And shake me
So find me
Reming me
Baby, what's it gonna be
What's it gonna be?

Come on, come on, come on
Follow me down
So come on, come on, come on
Follow me down
So come on, come on, come on
Follow me down
So come on, come on, come on
Follow me down
