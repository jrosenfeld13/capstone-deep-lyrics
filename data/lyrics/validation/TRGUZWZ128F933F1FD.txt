Since I went on the wagon, I'm certain drink is a major crime
For when you lay off the liquor, you feel so much slicker
Well that is, most of the time
But there are moments, sooner or later
When it's tough, I got to say, love to say, Waiter

Make it another old-fashioned, please
Make it another, double, old-fashioned, please
Make it for one who's due to join the disillusion crew
Make it for one of love's new refugees

Once high in my castle, I ran to you
And oh what a castle, built on a heavenly dream
Then quick as a lightning flash, that castle began to crash
So, make it another old-fashioned, please

Leave out the cherry
Leave out the orange
Leave out the bitters
Just make it straight, right
