Strong boy

You're wrong, boy

You think you've got my baby now

But this fight ain't quite won

You shorted me

A might big mistake

'Cause muscles ain't enough

To make her run away from me

She knows what kind of lover I can be

Strong boy

You're wrong, boy

My baby likes to have her fun

But I'm the one she loves

You've made your pass

You did find in your class

But all that you've been holdin'

Is a glove without a hand

You may be her boy, but I'm her man

Strong boy

You're wrong, boy

You leave women everywhere

You never get your fill

You've lost your pride

My heart is twice your size

How does it feel now

That you found one thrill you can't try

Stick around and watch my love roll by
