I see light - I see light at the end of the tunnel...
Joy, joy, joy - in my heart - I see light...

I spoke to someone yesterday
He didn't want politics in any way
They were young and can do as they pleased
When they were older they're on their hands and knees

I say drop down baby
Drop down dead tonight
I say drop down baby
Drop down dead tonight

There is rich and there is poor
But I know who I'm fighting for
And when the bell strikes twelve tonight
I'll pack my bags and turn the light

I say drop down baby
Drop down dead tonight
I say drop down baby
Drop down dead tonight

By the candle light there'll be songs
Singing, singing, singing all night long
And the trees that hid away by day
They'll be strong and here to stay

I say drop down baby
Drop down dead tonight
I say drop down baby
Drop down dead tonight

I say drop down baby
Drop down dead tonight
I say drop down baby
Drop down dead tonight

I say drop down baby
Drop down dead tonight
I say drop down baby
Drop down dead tonight
