I feel like I am drifting through the sky
Through the heavens I can hear your voice, I feel alive
You're everything that I want you to be
You give me all the strength I need
'Cause baby I'm in free fall with you

I'm skydivin' (3x)
Yeah!

Take me to a place where I can dream
So we can climb above the clouds and feel so free
And as we fall I'll take your hand
Don't let me go, please understand that
Baby I'm in free fall with you

I'm skydivin' (3x)
Yeah!
