I'm dustin' off Hank and I'm puttin' him on
And I'm gonna drink one and listen to a country song
The way it sounded in nineteen-fifty-two
I'm takin' some old things, and makin' 'em new

I'm pickin' up the phone and I'm startin' to dial
A number of friends I haven't talked to in a while
And I'm gonna tell 'em that I love 'em, yes I do
I'm takin' some old things, and makin' 'em new

Lately my world's been movin' way too fast
I need to slow down and catch up with some of the past
Maybe go back home and stay for a week or two
I'm takin' some old things and makin' 'em new

I'm takin' your picture out of that drawer
And I'm gonna hold you close to my chest once more
Remembering the love that felt so true
I'm takin' some old things and makin' 'em new

Baby, my world's been movin' way too fast
I need to slow down and catch up with some of the past
Maybe go back home and stay for a week or two
I'm takin' some old things and makin' 'em new

Strummin' my D-18 and hummin' a Haggard tune
I'm takin' some old things and makin' 'em new
I'm takin' some old things... and makin' 'em new
