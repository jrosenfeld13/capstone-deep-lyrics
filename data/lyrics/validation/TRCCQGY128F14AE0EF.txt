It felt like rain
That fell again
Down on me
It felt like rain
That touched my face
And I can't believe it
Like rain
I can't believe it
No I can't believe it

The things You said
Seem to find their way back into my head
And I regret my ways
You never left
Remind me once again so I won't forget
You're never far away

It felt like rain
That said again
That it's okay
Pale like white
I close my eyes
'Cause I can't believe it

I can't believe it
The way You forgive me
