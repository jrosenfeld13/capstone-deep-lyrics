Oh, You know I really want to talk
Seems like I just can't get enough
Oh how I really need your love
I, I just can't get you out of my mind
And I know I think I realize
Oh I really need your love

All I want, all I need
All I want is the rhythm and your heart baby
All I want, all I need
All I want is the rhythm and your heart baby

All I want is your heart baby
Your heart baby

All I want, all I need
All I want, all I need
All I want, all I need
All I want is the rhythm and your heart baby
All I want, all I need
All I want, all I need
All I want, all I need
All I want is the rhythm and your heart baby

Oh, You know I really want to talk
Seems like I just can't get enough
Oh how I really need your love
I, I just can't get you out of my mind
And I know I think I realize
Oh I really need your love
