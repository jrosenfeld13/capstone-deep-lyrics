Old Sasha was there already
With his bag of tricks
You're a sweet small shivering body
With nothing left
And I begged him to steal just one more life
From the nine God gave you
He said the miracles were through

The cabin shook and listed
When you screamed
I found some whiskey in the kitchen
And poured it in your tea
I tried to calm you
I kissed your neck and I cooled your forehead
And the telephone went dead

Oh my God and oh my Dear
The shades are drawn
Well I guess our time is here
We were never as lucky as we'd like
Oh my God and oh my Love
The doctor's gone, well I guess our time is up
Break the fever and cheat death one more time

The trees were as still as iceberges
And green with Spring
My knuckles popped and chattered
Like wind-up teeth
With my nerves as tight as tension wires
And searchlights in the mist
I bit my lip, I bit yours in it

Oh my God and oh my Dear
The shades are drawn
Well I guess our time is here
We were never as lucky as we'd like
Oh my God and oh my Love
The cop's outside, well I guess our time is up
Break the fever and cheat death one more time
