(Jenny Lou Carson)

They say a man's home is his castle
He's like a king on a throne
It may be a shack down alongside the track
But everything in it's his own

So don't think of taking his loved one
It's written Thou shall not steal
Don't rob another man's castle
No matter how lonesome you feel

--- Instrumental ---

Don't rob another man's castle
Don't take his treasures away
Strange as it seems when you steal a man's dreams
You'll never know then how you'll pay

So don't rob a man of his loved one
You'll break his heart don't you see
I robbed another man's castle
Now someone just stole her from me...
