A legion of demons
Born from boundaries of death
Like a onslaught of evil
To destroy this Earth

Covering the morbid skies
Like a mist of sulphur
I can see Satanas
The cursed of death
Terminate masses and reigns
With blood axes of hate
The beasts of son of devil
Tormenting the preachers of Christ

The humans try to react
To this nuclear war
Which is like a endless pain
Burning in the fire of Hell
