Like a spotlight that breaks into the darkness
Like an arrow that's racing to it's target
I got you in my sight
I am fixed on you
And I can feel you calling looking for me too

Nothing's gonna stop me 'cause I'm on a mission
I'm getting ready for a demolition

Collide, crash into me
Collide, I want to be broken by you
And made brand new
Collide

In the aftermath of your hurricane
It won't be what I lost but what I stand to gain
So bring your storm to me 'cause I know when it's through
The clouds will roll away
As sky will turn to blue

Nothing's gonna stop me I know what I'm doing
Make something beautiful from out of the ruins

Collide, crash into me
Collide, I want to be broken by you
And made brand new
Collide

Rearrange me
Only you can save me

Collide, crash into me
Collide, I want to be broken by you
And made brand new
Collide
