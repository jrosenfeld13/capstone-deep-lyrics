I'm fakin' Jamaican
And I think I'm a rasta
My hair looks like pasta
I think I'm a rasta
I'm fakin' Jamaican
Fakin' Jamaican
Fakin' Jamaican man
Fakin' Jamaican
Fakin' Jamaican man

I'm fakin' Jamaican
And I think I'm a rasta
I am Milli Vanilli
I won me a Grammy
I am fakin' Jamaican
Fakin' Jamaican
Fakin' Jamaican man
Fakin' Jamaican
Fakin' Jamaican man

Fakin' Jamaican
Fakin' Jamaican man
Fakin' Jamaican
Fakin' Jamaican man
