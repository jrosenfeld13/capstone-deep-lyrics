God loves people more than anything
God loves people more than anything
And more than anything, He wants them to know
He'd rather die than let them go
Cause God loves people more than anything

God loves the weary when they're too weak to try
He feels their pain, He knows their shame
He cries with those who cry
He won't give up or walk away when other people do
Cause God loves people more than anything

God loves people more than anything
God loves people more than anything
And more than anything, He wants them to know
He'd rather die than let them go
Cause God loves people more than anything

God loves the wounded who've stumbled into sin
He reaches down and pulls them out
And cleans them off again
And He will heal the broken heart that's given up on love
Cause God loves people more than anything

God loves people more than anything
God loves people more than anything
And more than anything He wants them to know
He'd rather die than let them go
Cause God loves people more than anything

More than anything, He wants us to go
And show the world so they will know
That God loves people
More than anything
