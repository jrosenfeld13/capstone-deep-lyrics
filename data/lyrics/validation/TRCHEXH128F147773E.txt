Ah ah
Ah ah ...

With a jingle
And a jangle
And a tingle
And a tangle
You can slip and slide
You can slip and slide
To eternity

You can't walk a tight rope
Without a safety net
Can't forget your tight fist
Queuing for it's debt

With some shame and sham
And some blame and glam
With some shame and sham
And some blame and glam
Tiptoeing west
With blindfolds on
Tiptoeing west
With blindfolds on

And I'd rather be the devil than go
Creeping to the cross

With a jingle
And a jangle
And a tingle
And a tangle
You can slip and slide
You can slip and slide
To eternity

You can't walk a tight rope
Without a safety net
Can't forget your tight fist
Queuing for it's debt

Ah ah
Ah ah...

And I'd rather be the devil than go
Creeping to the cross

Ah ah
Ah ah...

With some shame and sham
And some blame and glam
With some shame and sham
And some blame and glam
Tiptoeing west
With blindfolds on
Tiptoeing west
With blindfolds on

And I'd rather be the devil than go
Creeping to the cross

Ah ah
Ah ah...
