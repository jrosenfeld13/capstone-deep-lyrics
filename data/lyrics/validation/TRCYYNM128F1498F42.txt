And now with the following collection of...

Im above everything else
Saved the ones who shouldn't be
Hold on to them all so youll
Find yourself away from me

Our lost faith strung out on a line
My most empathetic dreams of you
The sorry excuses on which we dine
When all my fears tell me it's true

Borrowed dreams of some imagined future
All wrapped up inside this borrowed hope

Don't manipulate the most
Beautiful thing youll ever know
To the extent of saving your
Ragged torn out sickly show
Holding my head above the fold
Can't decide which side I want
I buried everything so deep in the cold
Now I stop inside of the lies I flaunt

Borrowed dreams of some imagined future
All wrapped up inside this borrowed hope

Pull it all away from me
Show me all the things I can
Never be allowed to see
It's all so far away

If you must have faith in someone
Trust that Ill push you away
If you must have faith in someone
Trust that Ill push you away

WHAT AM I IF?
The flies all stick to me

WHAT AM I IF?
The maggots live in me

WHAT AM I IF?
I'm closet to the stink

WHAT AM I IF?
You're all thats real to me

WHAT AM I?

Teach me just. show me
Break everything. flush it away
Teach me just show me
The starts already over
Break everything and

FLUSH IT AWAY!
