Snow alights as dark sea grows
Then far below lies softly glowing
Snow turns slowly into water
I know deep down hidden in you submarine bells chime
Gold and groaning, sunlit toning, submerged sound sublime
So the colder, deeper tolling
Reaches dissolution
You wish a vicious whirlpool go swirling round and round
I can watch in wonder as your gaze shifts past my shoulder
Just a glimpsed abyss that flashes at me
I know deep down hidden in you submarine bells chime
Gold and groaning, sunlit toining, submerged sound sublime
Since the weakest currents bruise it
Someday I may lose this
Immersed in words sand miss you
Kiss foaming waves goodbye
I slice the surface here beside you
Lungs filled liquid yell I love you
Sound moves further underwater
Deep and dark my submarine bells groan in greens and grey
Mine would chime a thousand times
To make you feel okay
K-k-k okahy
