All along you knew that you would be coming back again
All along you told me that you would always be my friend
All along, all along you knew where you could find me
If you took the freeway to the canyon

Oh this last year left its mark on me
You build me up just to watch me fall
To come as far to think that we were never that close at all
Never that close at all
Never that close at all
It feels just like a dream now

I was only trying to hide my body from the wind
I was always flying as if I'd never come down again
But all along, I was only trying just to find you
When I took the freeway to the canyon

Oh, so many things come so slow to me
I build them up just to watch them fall
Now 'bout that girl that came to me -- were we ever that close at all
Ever that close at all
Ever that close at all
It feels just like a dream now
It feels just like a dream now
It feels just like a dream now
It feels just like a dream now

All along you knew that you would be coming back again
All along I told you that I would always be your friend
And all along, all along you knew where you could find us
If you took the freeway to the canyon
To the canyon
