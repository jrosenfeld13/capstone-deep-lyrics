(I've)traced my life right (and) I'm still down
Than I've heard your sound
Went around still all around

(I've)Got ain't good, I'm goin' down
Get some painful sound
Life is so rough just fill around

Set us free this time
Set us free this time

What's the different until the maze
Thank for all my race
Crank the fire on the stage

Have enough (of) me it's such a waste
(Still) crample weirdful way
Help me keep your measure stage

And it all
Comes together now

All your story

On your own, (the) path you run
Become in peaces now

You've got no choice

You have come and I'm just gone
Time to focus on the world
You've got to go in to it
It ain't easy we don't do it

But it's all became to do
It's been down in front of you
'Cause you know the truth is vague
And you're wastin' time hangin' around in town

Set us free this time
Set us free this time
