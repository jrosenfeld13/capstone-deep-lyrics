Chances are..we're gonna leave now
Sorry for..the victim now

Though my days..are filled with sorrow
I see here..a bright tomorrow
Chances, chances are..some might not hold out
Chances are..hang on right now

Though all of my, days..are filled with sorrow
I stay here..a bright tomorrow

Chances, chances are..some might not hold out
Chances are..hang on right now
Chances are..oh, chances, you're my chances
Chances are..hang on right now
(Chances are)..hang on right now

Deal with loneliness..heartaches and teardrops
(Chances are)..we'll have to wait
(Chances are)..hang on right now
Chances are..chances are..
Oh chances, you're my chances..
