When you cannot dream, you cannot sleep, you cannot even see
Others already looked and they have seen what they want you to see
When you cannot breathe, you cannot weep, you cannot even speak
Others already have and they have spoken what they would like you to speak

When you cannot dream, you cannot sleep, you cannot even see
Others already looked and they have seen what they want you to see
When you cannot breathe, you cannot weep, you cannot even speak
Others already have and they have spoken what they would like you to speak

Where did you lie? It's the trees that are burning
Where did you hear? It's the sounds unheard
Where did you see? Should the young sound swallow?

Where did you lie? It's the trees that are burning
Where did you hear? It's the sounds unheard
Where did you see? Should the young sound swallow?

Everyone is guilty, dreaming, dreaming, each and every one to stop
Everyone is guilty, dream, speak, spoken, please be careful, leave me falling
Everyone is guilty, dreaming, dreaming, each and every one to stop
Everyone is guilty, dream, speak, spoken, please be careful, leave me falling

Everyone, everyone, everyone
Everyone, everyone, everyone
Everyone, everyone, everyone
