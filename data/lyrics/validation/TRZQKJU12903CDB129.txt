Trapped inside myself
And I just can't escape the feeling
Like someone got me by the throat
Give me some room to breathe
Let me be a human being
Trying to break down the barriers!
Trying to break down the barriers!

Sometimes I just wanna sit back
And learn to live with the pain
Losing you all is my nightmares
But we all die alone!
WE ALL DIE ALONE!

Years down the road we're still here
Looking back at all the times we shared
Seeing how mistakes became lessons
Counting all the memories
I know by now that some things have changed
But in my heart I'm still feel the fuckin' same
