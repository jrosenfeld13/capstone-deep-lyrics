You think that you are cool
You go to fool school
Learn the rules, So weak
If Im getting punched or kicked
Im going down in one shot
Cannot handle too much pot, So weak
Like a stupid baby
Your favorite word is maybe
You will get rabies
So weakx2
Cannot handle heavy lifting
Can't afford expensive gifting
Attitude needs shifting, so weak
Learn a trade, get a job
Become opposite of slob
All you want is applause , so weak
You watch the tube and stuff your face
Dumbly watching will and grace
Tie your shoelace
So weakx2
So weak x4
