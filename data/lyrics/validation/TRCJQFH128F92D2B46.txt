My time is the right time
And the feeling isn't even my time

Why are there so many records of my life
Why can't I just curl up onto the night
Why can't I just curl up onto problems and get missed of my own life

It's colder in house than you think
It's colder in your bones
And in your bones it is so cold
And in your bones it is so cold and sick
