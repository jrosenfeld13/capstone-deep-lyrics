Baby, let's do it
Let's make it through the summer

Shimmery summery sha-la-la love
Shimmery summery
Shimmery summery sha-la-la love
Shimmery summery

Hey, let's calculate
Come up with a catchphrase
For kids to sing throughout the summer
Naive, innocent and sweet
Some fluffy make-believe
To sell the idea of summer

Everybody gets a little bit funny
Shimmery summery sha-la-la love
Shimmery summery uu-ah uu-ah
Everybody wants to find their honey
Shimmery summery sha-la-la love
Shimmery summery u-aa
Baby, let's do it
Let's make it through the summer

Whoa, that could bring us dough
Quite catchy even though
It's not as good as Coco Jambo
Well, what the hell
If only it will sell
We can forget it after summer

Everybody gets a little bit funny
Shimmery summery sha-la-la love
Shimmery summery uu-ah uu-ah
Everybody wants to find their honey
Shimmery summery sha-la-la love
Shimmery summery u-aa
Baby, let's do it
Let's make it through the summer

Mandatory reggae part!
Autumnal love grows like a rainstorm
Wintry love will keep you warm
Springtime love well it's a bit of a norm
But there's something really special
In that shimmery summery sha-la-la love

Everybody gets a little bit funny
Shimmery summery sha-la-la love
Shimmery summery uu-ah uu-ah
Everybody wants to find their honey
Shimmery summery sha-la-la love
Shimmery summery u-aa
Baby, let's do it
Let's make it through the summer
U-aa u-aa u-aa

Shimmery summery sha-la-la love
Shimmery summery
Shimmery summery sha-la-la love
Shimmery summery
Shimmery summery sha-la-la love
Shimmery summery
Shimmery summery sha-la-la love
Shimmery summery
Uu-ah uu-ah
