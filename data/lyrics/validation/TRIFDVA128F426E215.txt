By the time I get to Phoenix
She'll be rising
She'll find that note
I left hanging on her door

And she'll laugh when she reads the part
That says, "I'm leaving"
Cause I've left that girl so many times before

By the time I make Albuquerque
She'll be working
She'll probably stop at lunch and to give me a call
But she'll hear that phone keep on ringing
Off the wall
That's all

By the time I make Oklahoma
She'll be sleeping
She'll turn softly in her sleep and call my name out low

And she'll cry just to think I'd really leave her
Though time and time I've tried to tell her so
She just didn't know
I would really go
