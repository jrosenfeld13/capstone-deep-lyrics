I can't stand I can't think, I've had too much to drink
Forced down my pills now I can't wait
Gonna be f*cked don't wanna be straight!
Your view is restricted, so is your mind
You've got to break down the barriers
And use your mind
I drink too much but I've nothing to lose
You stick to your fashion I'll stick to my booze
Watching you preach has become rather bland
What do expect to change with an 'X' on your hand?
