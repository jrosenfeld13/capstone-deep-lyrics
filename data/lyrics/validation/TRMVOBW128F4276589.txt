Love letters straight from your heart
Keep us so near, while apart
I'm not alone in the night
When I can hold all the love you write

I memorize every line
And I kiss the name that you sign, yes I do
And darling then I read again right from the start
Love letters straight from your heart

Love letters straight from your heart
Keep us so near, while apart
I'm not alone in the night
When I can hold all the love you write

I memorize every line
I kiss the name that you sign, oh darling
And only then I read again right from the start
Love letters straight from your heart
Keep 'em coming
Love letters straight from your heart
