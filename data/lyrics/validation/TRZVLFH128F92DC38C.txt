Ecce Dominus dissipabit terram:
Et nudabit eam, et affliget faciem ejus
Et disperget habitatores ejus

For by fire and by his sword will the Lord plead with all flesh
But countless shall be the slain of man

Dissipatione dissipabitur terra, et direptione prdabitur;
Dominus enim locutus est verbum hoc

For by fire and by his sword will the Lord plead with all flesh
But countless shall be the slain of man

Propter hoc maledictio vorabit terram
Et peccabunt habitatores ejus;
Ideoque insanient cultores ejus
Et relinquentur homines pauci

For by fire and by his sword will the Lord plead with all flesh
But countless shall be the slain of man
