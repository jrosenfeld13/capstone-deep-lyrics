Lonely boys and your lonely girls
Here at the end of the lonely world
You're finding out if there's someone to cry about

Lonely girls and your lonely boys
Playing alone with your lonely toys
Well don't be blue 'cause there's no one to play with you

Get a grip on yourself you know you should
I got a grip on myself and it feels good
Get a grip on yourself take my advice
I got a grip on myself and it feels nice

When the lights come on and the party's through
There are always a few with nobody to do
Well now don't despair, you'll eventually get there
And meanwhile all of the lonely ones
Here's what to do while you wait for the sun to rise above
The loneliest kind of love

Get a grip on yourself you know you should
(get a grip on yourself)
I got a grip on myself and it feels good
Get a grip on yourself take my advice
(get a grip on yourself)
I got a grip on myself and it feels nice

Well it feels nice
Yeah it feels nice
Well it feels nice
Yes it feels nice
If you're looking for someone to get a grip on you
First you've gotta get a grip on yourself its true

Get a grip on yourself you know you should
(get a grip on yourself)
I got a grip on myself and it feels good
Get a grip on yourself take my advice
(get a grip on yourself)
I got a grip on myself and it feels nice

Well it feels nice
Yeah it feels nice
Well it feels nice
