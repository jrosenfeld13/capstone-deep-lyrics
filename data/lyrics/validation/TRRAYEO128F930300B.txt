[Verse 1]
Watching the people get lairy
It's not very pretty I tell thee
Walking through town is quite scary
It's not very sensible either
A friend of a friend he got beaten
He looked the wrong way at a policeman
Would never have happened to Smeaton
An Old Leodensian

[Pre-Chorus]
La...la la la la la
Ah...la la la la la

[Chorus]
I predict a riot
I predict a riot
I predict a riot
I predict a riot

[Verse 2]
I tried to get to my taxi
The man in a tracksuit attacks me
He said that he saw it before me
And wants to get things a bit gory
Girls scrabble round with no clothes on
To borrow a pound for a condom
If it wasn't for chip fat they'd be frozen
They're not very sensible

[Pre-Chorus]
La...la la la la la
Ah...la la la la la

[Chorus]
I predict a riot
I predict a riot
I predict a riot
I predict a riot

[Bridge]
And if there's anybody left in here
That doesn't want to be out there
Ah...

[Chorus 1 - Shortened]
Watching the people get lairy
It's not very pretty I tell thee
Walking through town is quite scary
It's not very sensible

[Pre-Chorus]
La...la la la la la
Ah...la la la la la

[Chorus]
I predict a riot
I predict a riot
I predict a riot
I predict a riot

And if there's anybody left in here
That doesn't want to be out there

[Chorus]
I predict a riot
I predict a riot
I predict a riot
I predict a riot
