Chess is such a difficult game
There are so many pieces
So many squares where you can go
So few promises

Never you mind all the others
Anticipating your next move
I know it's hard, cause you've got a lot to do

Street signs and traffic lights
Ever confusing the issue
Stop, left, go right, no U-turn
Where's the goddamn exit?

Never you mind all the others
Influencing your next move
I know it's hard, cause you've got a lot to prove
La la la la la la la~

Sex and drugs and rock and roll
The pieces lie right before you
This puzzle can't be done wrong
So come on while you can

Never you mind all the others
Anticipating your next move
Never you mind all the others
Never you mind what they do

Don't let them get you down, cause if they do
You'll be trapped forever under their shoe
Here is the paintbrush, so go
I know it's hard, cause you've got a lot to do

La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la~
