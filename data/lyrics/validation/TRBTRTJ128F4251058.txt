See the scene of devastation
Brought about by your father
Your hope's here, you will learn
How to rebuilt a future

Touch the ravaged land
Bequeathed by your ancestors
Your saviour's here, you will learn
How to get life to come forth again

Join Edaenia

Hear this deathly silence
Brought about by your father
Your hope's here, you will learn
How not to fear loneliness

Smell the charred bodies
Bequeathed by your ancestors
Your saviour's here, you will learn
How not to wage wars

Join Edaenia, Man's hope
As was written in the Prophecy

Taste irradiated flesh, caused by your actions
Here is your future, you'll probably learn
Not to give death anymore
Here is your future, you'll probably learn
Not to give death anymore
