[Verse 1]
It's alright
You're ready for the night of your life
Stars will shine so bright
They say, we're dancing the stress away
This beat is underneath your feet
Right now, together we will meet
This place, will blow your mind away
Hey-ey

[Chorus]
Welcome to the club now
Gonna pump it up now
This is an emergency
Music is my galaxy
Welcome to the club now
Everybody hop now
We've gotta going on
Until the break of dawn

[Chorus]
Welcome to the club now
Gonna pump it up now
This is an emergency
Music is my galaxy
Welcome to the club now
Everybody hop now
We've gotta going on
Until the break of dawn
So put the record on

(So put the record on)
(So put the record on)

(To the club now)
(To the club now)

[Verse 2]
Right now
Standing here in line
So open up the door Mr. Frankenstein
'Cause we're here, to dance the night away

[Chorus]
Welcome to the club now
Gonna pump it up now
This is an emergency
Music is my galaxy
Welcome to the club now
Everybody hop now
We've gotta going on
Until the break of dawn

[Chorus]
Welcome to the club now
Gonna pump it up now
This is an emergency
Music is my galaxy
Welcome to the club now
Everybody hop now
We've gotta going on
Until the break of dawn
So put the record on

(So put the record on)
(So put the record on)
