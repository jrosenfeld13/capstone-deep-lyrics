[Chorus]
We could blame the world forever
We could just escape together
So are we breaking out, or are we breaking down?
We can't blame this world forever (This world forever!)

[Verse 1]
The end will never come
There's still a mountain left to climb
But we will overcome
The hurdles placed inside our minds
(So close but still so far!)
Each day will bring us brand new scars
(What are we fighting for?!)
We cannot live like this no more
'Cause in the thick of darkened days, we know

[Chorus]
We could blame the world forever
We could just escape together
So are we breaking out (breaking out!), or are we breaking down? (breaking down!)
We can't blame this world forever (This world forever!)

[Verse 2]
Just need some clarity, can't seem to open up these eyes
For what your sympathy it took me time to realize
(This is not what I want!)
Or how I thought this life would be
(This is not what we need!)
So take this shit away from me
Because in the thick of darkened days, we know

[Chorus]
We could blame the world forever
We could just escape together
So are we breaking out (breaking out!) or are we breaking down (breaking down!)
We can't blame this world forever (This world forever!)

[Bridge]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
So are we breaking out
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Or are we breaking down
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
I guess what's done is done
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
But we will overcome
(We could blame this world forever)

[Chorus]
We could blame the world forever
We could just escape together
So are we breaking out (breaking out!) or are we breaking down (breaking down!)
We can't blame this world forever

[Outro]
'Cause in the thick of darkened days, we know
