Time, 'feels I'm like running out of time
I'm getting desperate to find
But if I don't, will I regret it?

Mood, again this weary mood
Things won't go the way they should
And tomorrow it won't be any better

When times get rough on you
Remember times go by
A feeling of comfort must be somewhere to find

Night, I tossed and turned last night
I couldn't get things out my mind
The ceiling didn't make it any better

Thoughts and doubts keep tossing me
Is this the way that it will always be
Tired out faith, mixed up with sadness?

When times get rough on you
Remember times go by
A feeling of comfort must be somewhere to find

As long as you keep the fire burning inside

Sometimes I'm feeling insecure
Like this is all and there is nothing more
Like this is all and it will last forever

Wrong, I'm sure my senses can't be wrong
Oh, I've been waiting for so long
I've done my time, for me it's now or never

When times get rough on you
Remember times go by
A feeling of comfort must be somewhere to find

As long as you keep the fire burning inside
