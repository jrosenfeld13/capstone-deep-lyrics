(First sight!) Turns me round again
Brings me face to face with my sin
I've got it, always had it
A reason to look within now
(Take flight!) To your sun again
Burns the sin straight from my hands
I've got it, always had it
A reason to live within now

Every time I fall, you catch me

And every time I lose control
You help me, you save me
And every time I lose myself
You find me, redefine me

(My God!) How stained my hands have been
Makes me sick from inside out again
I've got it, always had it
A reason to look within now
(Stand close!) To my side again
Never stick a knife in my back, friend
I've got it, always had it
A reason to live within now

Every time I fall, you catch me

And every time I lose control
You help me, you save me
And every time I lose myself
You find me, redefine me

Somebody to make me feel whole again (Life gets better)
Somebody to make me wanna love again (Life gets better)
Somebody to make me see the sun again (Life gets better)
Somebody to hold me, hold me
Until this life feels better

Every time I fall

Every time I lose control
You help me, you save me
And every time I lose myself
You find me, redefine me
And every time I hate myself
You love me, forgive me
And every time I lose myself
You find me, redefine me
