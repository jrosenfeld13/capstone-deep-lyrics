Haven't seen her, she hit the wall last night
Bumped his head low, a cause-effected fight

She says she ain't gonna take it no more
(Golden ring around her finger)
But she won't ever set him free
(Golden ring around her finger)

Come to find out, she'd been with someone else
So it's a bitch now, he sees it in himself
Long before we, teachers of our game
On a bent lord, it tends to get insane

She says she ain't gonna take it no more
(Golden ring around her finger)
But she's not gonna set him free
Set him free

He keeps the light on, prepare for war
He keeps the light on, prepare for war
He keeps the light on, prepare for war

Severed past gone, it's all the same today
Cannibalistic, eating themselves away

She says she ain't gonna take it no more
(Golden ring around her finger)
But she's not gonna set him free
Set him free

Cause he keeps the light on, prepare for war
He keeps the light on, prepare for war
(Golden ring around her finger)
He keeps the light on, prepare for war
(Golden ring around her finger)

Fill me (Fill me, kill me, fill me, kill me, fill me, kill me)
Kill me (Fill me, kill me, fill me, kill me, fill me, kill me)
Fill me (Fill me, kill me, fill me, kill me, fill me, kill me)
Kill me (Fill me, kill me, fill me, kill me, fill me, kill me)
