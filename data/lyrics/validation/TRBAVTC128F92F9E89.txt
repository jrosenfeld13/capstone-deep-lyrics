You're the one that I am with, when I'm all alone*
You take me and you shake me down, soaking to the bone
No matter what I say to you, it's gonna work out fine
Been there before you see the light, I crystalize
Your shadow will not let me see, a vision of your soul
For all that you have given me, let me take control
You crystalize in every drop, every drop of tear
I carry you inside of me, don't let me disappear
Your the one that I am with now, when I'm all alone
I see your soul shine
Watch myself climb
Into the sun
Your the one that I am with now, when I'm all alone
I see your soul shine
Watch myself climb
Into the sun
Your shadow will not let me see, a vision of your soul
For all that you have given me, let me take control
You crystalized in every drop, every drop of tear
I carry you inside of me, don't let me disappear
Your the one that I am with now, when I'm all alone
I see your soul shine
Watch myself climb
Into the sun
Your the one that I am with now, when I'm all alone
I see your soul shine
Watch myself climb
Into the sun
Your the one that I am with now, when I'm all alone
I see your soul shine
Watch myself climb
Into the sun
Your the one that I am with now, when I'm all alone
I see your soul shine
Watch myself climb
Into the sun
