Well the answer is always the same
Won't you please just let it be
Cause I've been there and all I can say
Is that it slips away from me
With the memory of yesterday's grace
She spins away from me
So I can go on

Every long night
Every whisper
Every song that never saw it coming
And she says it's oh so right

Every cold night
Every shiver
Every time I didn't feel it coming
She says it's oh so right

As heartless and cruel as can be
She moves away from me
Still I need to be hers every time
With all that I can be
As she calls in the deep of the night
She takes all I've got from me
So I can go on

Every long night
Every whisper
Every song that never saw it coming
Baby don't you know that it's not alright
It's not alright, no, no, no

Every cold night
Every shiver
Every silent scream
And she never listens
Well it's not alright, not alright

She rides with the gods of the night
She rules the tides in me
She crushes the waves with her sigh
And she...oh lord... becomes a part of me
But her care is as sharp as a knife
I'll say, for how could she just step away from me
How can you just walk away from me?

Every cold night
Every whisper
Every silent scream
And you never listen
And you say what?...It's allright
Well it's not allright, no, no

Every last time
Every shiver
Every dirty game
Well it just isn't right
It just isn't right

She wakes at the dawn of the day
She spins away from me
So I can go on...
I can go on...
