You make me feel so good, you make me feel so good
You tame a wild man, just like no other could
I'm going up I'm coming down
I'm always floating when you're on the ground
When I hear you it's a beautiful sound
Turn up the reverb, turn up the reverb
You're gentle to the bone, pure and homegrown
You're living every day, you're a precious stone
I'm a going up I'm coming down
I'm always floating when you're on the ground
And when I hear you it's a beautiful sound
Turn up the reverb, turn up the reverb
I hope it never ends, I hope it never ends
'cos I'd be too long lonely but I'd be back again
I'm going up I'm coming down
I'm always floating when you're on the ground
When I hear you it's a beautiful sound
Turn up the reverb, turn up the reverb......
