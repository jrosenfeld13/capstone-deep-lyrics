Men without ties don't dress for dinner
It's Friday night frozen pizza thing
Don't want no wife or no beginner
Friday night frozen, pizza king

Everything you buy is soon expired
Some neighbors they're a-thinking that you're gay
Others they assume that you've been fired
See you smoking cigarettes all day

Well, men without ties don't dress for dinner
Do the Friday night frozen, pizza thing
Well I don't want no wife or no beginner
You're the Friday night frozen, pizza king

On Saturday they won't catch you in your yard
You're dreaming of tonight's fine cuisine
With a microwave and a library card
It'll taste like plastic, but it'll be faster
Ha, sing it

Men without ties don't dress for dinner
Do the Friday night frozen pizza thing
Well I don't want no wife or no beginner
You're the Friday night frozen pizza king

Men without ties, it's about time

Men without ties don't dress for dinner
Do the Friday night frozen pizza thing
Well I don't want no wife or no beginner
You're the Friday night frozen pizza king

Men without ties don't dress for dinner
Men without ties don't need a thing
Don't want no wife, show to cut by

Men without ties, men without ties
Men without ties, men without ties
Men without ties, men without ties
Men without ties, men without ties
