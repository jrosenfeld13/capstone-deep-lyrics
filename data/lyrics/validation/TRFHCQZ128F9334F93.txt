Lights, they wash your face
Pale and misty white
Colour flowers
Your eyes seem ever changing in my mind
Colours bleed to red
As I kiss your face
Want to tell you I love you
Everyday as we grow
See I know now
Yes I know now it's all my own
And I know now

Can you feel my pain
As you walk on by
Will you tell me you need me
Every time, yeah
All alone

See I'll show you things never seen before
For your mind to untangle
On your own, all alone
Yes I know now
Yes I know now
It's all my own
Yes I know now
I'll watch as you go
Yes I know now
It's alright

And I know now
Yes I know now
It's all on my own
As you blossom
Yes, you blossom everyday
And I know now
Yes I know now it's all my own
As you blossom everyday
Everyday...

Oh, I don't feel my arms are breaking up
I don't fear my eyes are turning red
I don't feel my arms are breaking up
I don't feel you slipping from my hands

Yes I know now
Yes I know now it's all on my own
As you blossom everyday
And I know now
Yes I know now it's all on my own
As you blossom everyday
Now I know
Yes I know now
It's all on my own
As you blossom everyday
