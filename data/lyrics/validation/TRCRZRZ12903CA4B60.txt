I got this hot girl
She drive a hot car
You know I met her where
Were at the rock bar
She stole my heart, pow
She's on my chart now
And everytime we hit the club, it's like shit wow
She's a nine out of ten
Oh man, we're playing to win
I'm hoping that this thing we got will never come to an end
'Cuz that might tear me apart'
It's always good from the start
The way we move, yeah
The groove is like picasso and art

Now she all mine, we're drinking more wine
There's a melody that plays in my head all time
It sounds so damn good, really really damn good
Really really damn good, pretty damn good, come on

I'm singing that melody
The phone gave to me (to me)
When I rang your number (your number)
I'm singing it
I'm singing that melody
The phone gave to me
When I rang your number (rang your number)
Remember it

All right here we go, yo
Not as a winner, winner
I'm a beginner, sinner
The kind of girl that you would never bring home for dinner
I show our love in public
Because I know she love it
If there's a spot on my body, it makes her kiss and rub it
But tell me who cares
A love for two pairs
I'm gonna try to make this last for least a few years
My heart will never pause
I'm using metaphors
You and I, we're king and queen girl, I'm for ever yours

Now she all mine, we're drinking more wine
There's a melody that plays in my head all time
It sounds so damn good, really really damn good
Really really damn good, pretty damn good come on

I'm singing that melody
The phone gave to me
When I rang your number
I'm singing it
I'm singing that melody
The phone gave to me (swing-swinger)
When I rang your number

Can I get your number?
5-5-4-9 (5-5-4-9) 2-3-6-1-9
One more time
5-5-4-9 (and) 2-3-6-1-9
Got it!

I'm singing that melody
The phone gave to me
When I rang your number
I'm singing it
I'm singing that melody (swing-swinger)
The phone gave to me
When I rang your number
Remember it

5-5-4-9, I'm singing that melody, 2-3-6-1-9
I'm singing
5-5-4-9, I'm singing that melody, 2-3-6-1-9
I'm singing it
5-5-4-9 2-3-6-1-9
