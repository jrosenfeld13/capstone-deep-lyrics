My baby flirts and walks the streets of the town that never sleeps
She knows it hurts that I'm complete with the town that never sleeps
Sometimes I follow her all night
To be sure that she's all right
Some things she's done have made me weep
In the town in the town that never sleeps
The lights that glitter in the night fill her needs and bring delight
Her life could never be complete without a town that never sleep
Sometimes I follow her all night...
In the town in the town that never sleeps
