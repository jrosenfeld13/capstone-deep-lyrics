Walking in the street
Breath the only friend
Strangers pass me by
I'm moving, moving with the wind
Inside me now, the gold
The gold at rainbows end
Stranger to myself, a stranger
Stranger till the end
Behind the closed door
The one we painted green
To remind me of the perfect plan

Wash my face in fields of green
Take me to the stars for free
Point me to the high wire call
Wake me true and wake me all

Walk me in the streets
Take me, to a view on high
To an empire state
Tease, tease and bake me dry
Swerve and turn on me
Melt me, melt me to the wall
Like an unspeant fortune, I'm running
Running with the call
Behind the closed door
The one we painted green
To remind me of a perfect plan

Wash my face
In fields of green
Take me to the stars for free
Point me to the high wire call
Wake me true and wake me all
