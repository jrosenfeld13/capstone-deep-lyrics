Old lover, you miss me
Over the ocean, I hope this finds you well
Warm sun on my back
The earth on its axis
The violence when we met

We're good people but why don't we show it?

Dead birds on the stairwell
Some ugly morning
Fell from their nests

No, don't tell your parents when we start sharing each other's beds

We're good people but why don't we show it?

I want to raise dogs; dogs and money
Stop threatening to leave town and I'll stop running

We're good people but why don't we show it?
