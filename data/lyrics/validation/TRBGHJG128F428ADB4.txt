Shake it up and throw it
Roll it up and smoke it
No one knows what it's worth
Where it's going
Tired moneymakers
Boring conversators, keep it up
We all know where you blow it
And now I live in a world that I call my own
It's always nice when no one's home
Give it a time and a place if you don't ask what it's for
It's another world but it's something more than ordinary
And I live in a world that I call my own
It's always nice when no one's home
Give it a time and a place if you don't ask what it's for
It's another world but it's something more than ordinary
Such a lovely day and it's nothing more than ordinary
It's another world but it's something more than ordinary
Such a lovely day and it's nothing more than ordinary living
That you're living

Such a lovely day and it's nothing more than ordinary living
That you're living
Waking up and rollin'
Loaded up and flowing creeping out
We all know
Where you're going
Trying to ignore it
What you're looking for and no one knows
What its worth
Where it's going
And now I live in a world that I call my own
It's always nice when no one's home
Give it a time and a place if you don't ask what it's for
It's another world but it's something more than ordinary
Such a lovely day and it's nothing more than ordinary
It's another world but it's something more than ordinary living
That I'm living
