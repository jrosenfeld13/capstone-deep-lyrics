I wanna hear it again, I wanna hear it again
The Old Piano Roll Blues
We're sittin' at an upright, my sweetie and me
Pushin' on the pedals makin' sweet harmony
When we hear rinkety-tink, and we hear Plinkety-plink
We cuddle closer it seems
And while we kiss kiss, kiss, kiss, away all our cares
The player piano's playing razz-a-ma-tazz
I wanna hear it again, I wanna hear it again
The Old Piano Roll Blues

But We, Played the Piano Roll Blues
We sat there and began to play
My sweetie and me
We sat there pushing on the pedals making sweet harmony
But we, cuddle closer it seems
It seems just like a dreamin'
While we kiss, kiss, kiss, our cares all away
The player piano's playing razz-a-ma-tazz
But we, wanna hear it again
Those Piano Roll Blues

I wanna hear it again, I wanna hear it again
The Old Piano Roll Blues
The Old Piano Roll Blues
We sat there and began to play
We're sittin' at an upright, my sweetie and me
We sat there pushin' on the pedals makin' sweet harmony
When we hear rinkety-tink, and we hear Plinkety-plink
We cuddle closer it seems
Cuddle closer it seems
Its like a dreamin while we kiss kiss kiss away all our cares
The player piano's playing razz-a-ma-tazz

I wanna hear it again, just hear it again
The Old Piano Roll Blues
The Old Piano Roll blues
