I could be dreaming
I could have ordinary people chasing me from town to town
Mission Impossible
They've got a spy for every blink of your eye

I'm feeling hunted
I'm feeling haunted
They've got a knife for every time you take the same train into work
A family's like a loaded gun
You point it in the wrong direction someone's going to get killed

If you had such a dream
Would you get up and do the things you've been dreaming

Is he your husband?
Or just your boyfriend?
Is he the moron who's been beating you and keeping you inside?
I've never done this kind of thing
But if I kill him now, who's going to miss him?

For every step there is a local boy who wants to be a hero
Do you want to do it now?
Outside the butchers with a knife and a bike chain

Chain
La la la
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
If you had such a dream
Would you get up and do the things you believe in

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
If you had such a dream
Would you get up and do those things
If you had such a dream
Would you get up and do those things

While your head is clear
While your head is clear
While your head is clear
While your head is clear
La la la la la

Here they used to sit in the shade, of a long lazy summers day, talking listlessly over village gossip, or telling endless sleepy stories about nothing. But it would have been worth any statesmans money to have heard the profound discussions which sometimes took place, when by chance an old newspaper fell into their hands, from some passing traveler. How solemnly they would listen to the contents, as drawled out by Derrick Van Bummel, the schoolmaster, a dapper, learned little man, who was not to be daunted by the most gigantic word in the dictionary...'
