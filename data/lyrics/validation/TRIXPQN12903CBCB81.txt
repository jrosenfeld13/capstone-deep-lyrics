I can be a real winner
Just let me change
I can be a real loser
If thats your thing
Honey just tell it to me
Should I be bonafied
I could be a real win
Just take me to your side

Ive been thinking about the situations
And how the things they used to be
When you would never have a doubt
Ive been thinking about invitations
To remote locations in our heart
When you and I were going out

Working for the city honey
So it dont go cold
Shoot me from a distance honey
Do what Im told

Ive been thinking about the situations
And how the things they used to be
When you would never have a doubt
Ive been thinking about invitations
To remote locations in our heart
When you and I were going out

We could be politicians
Live in deep fame
We could preach superstitions
Live without shame
Anything to please you
Make you feel strange
I could be a winner
Just let me change

Ive been thinking about the situations
And how the things they used to be
When you would never have a doubt
Ive been thinking about invitations
To remote locations in our heart
When you and I were going out
