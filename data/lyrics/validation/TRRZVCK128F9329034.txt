Sixteen going on seventeen
But she thinks that she's twenty-one
Doing things she ain't done before
Got her hands on a loaded gun
Talking 'bout
Sweet seventeen
Got a mouthful of sticky stuff
Blowing bubbles in the parking lot
She's in love with a film star
So she gives it everything she's got
Her daddy tells her she's crazy
And her momma says
Please slow down
See her out on the dance floor
She's gonna wind up in the lost and found
I'm talking about
(Fifteen sixteen seventeen)
Sweet seventeen
(Fifteen sixteen seventeen)
Sweet seventeen
I wouldn't say she's easy
But she's the kinda girl that won't say no
She's always getting into trouble
Though she's only got a year to go
She's got a record with the local sherriff
And a reputation coast to coast
(Fifteen sixteen seventeen)
Sweet seventeen
(Fifteen sixteen seventeen)
Sweet seventeen
Sixteen going on seventeen
And she acts like she's twenty-one
Counting days til she's eighteen
She's rated expert
She's having fun
I'm talking 'bout
(Fifteen sixteen seventeen)
Sweet seventeen
(Fifteen sixteen seventeen)
Sweet seventeen
(Fifteen sixteen seventeen)
You know what I mean
(Fifteen sixteen seventeen)
Sweet seventeen
