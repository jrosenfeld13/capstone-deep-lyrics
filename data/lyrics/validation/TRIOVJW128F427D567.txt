I told you romance, this is you last chance
Why stand and whisper, go up and take her love
Why stand and tell her, how much you love her
You know you want her, there be no other love

Love......Wild love! Love......Wild love!

If you want her love, tell her that you want it all
If you want her love, tell her that you want it all!

I told you romance, this is you last chance
Go up and show her, there be no other love
Love......Wild love! Love......Wild love!
