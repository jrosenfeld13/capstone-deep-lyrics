[Verse 1]
It doesnt take a genius to see Im not really into this
Pushy invitations just arent my thing
But you've been making assumptions out of fleeting emotions
So, Ill bury the hatchet and say what I need to say

[Chorus]
Well, Im sorry that I didnt want what you wanted
It was supposed to be our year
It took a long time to come
But now Im sadly admitting
That smiles and first impressions arent holding up

[Verse 2]
So easily embarrassed, cheeks bright as the sun
And Im the worst company to keep
Teasing you down these city streets
And with a smile going sideways, cant forget where youre from
Youll want to talk to me tonight
But will you want to talk tomorrow?

[Chorus]
Oh, Im sorry that I didnt want what you wanted
It was supposed to be our year
It took a long time to come
But Im sadly admitting
That smiles and first impressions arent holding up
