Now do you understand
That this was no ordinary man
And do we all agree
That we should use any means nessesary

Like standing in the line
Like pulling at the same time
(Can We)
Do you think there's hope for us
(Can We Save It)
Do you think all is lost
(Can We)
Can we save the world in time

The Man's a fool
The Man's a crazy, mixed up fool
The Man's a fool
The Man is crazy, mixed up

Now do we dare go on
Know'in that we've done something wrong
Do we dare turn back
Knowing what will happen
We could soon be strong
We could live as one
(Can We)
Do you think there's hope for us
(Can We Save It)
Do you think we can still trust
(Can We)
Can we save the world in time

The Man's a fool
The Man's a crazy, mixed up fool
The Man's a fool
The Man is crazy, mixed up

I say it with reluctance
(Can We)
I say it with repentence
(Can We Say It)
I say it so opus
(Can We)
Can we save the world in Time

The Man's a fool
The Man's a crazy, mixed up fool
The Man's a fool
The Man is crazy, mixed up

Would we get a chance
Or is it hopeless
Revenge and Reluctunce
Please reveal my sentence
Can we save the world in time
(Can we)
Can we save the world in time
(Can we Save It)
Is all lost
Is there such a hollocast
(Can we Save It)
Can we save the world in time
(Can we)
Can we save the world in time
(Can we Save It)
The Man's a fool
(Can we)
Can we save the world in time
