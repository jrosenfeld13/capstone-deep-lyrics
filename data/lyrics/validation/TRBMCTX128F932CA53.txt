[Verse 1]
I saw Gene today moving fast on his feet
Making his way through the crowd on the street
Maybe getting back to a Green Room track
Or the one where the horses run in Los Alamitos

[Chorus]
Oh no, that cant be right
All I suppose it was
Was a trick of the light

[Verse 2]
I saw Tom again through the bar and grill window
On piano he played his songs final crescendo
Thought Id go in, grab the leg of my friend
Hell grab mine--its another fine old Low Five

[Chorus]
Oh no, that cant be right
All I suppose it was
Was a trick of the light

[Bridge]
Ive seen Doug and Dave and my old friend Joe
Where the shadows danced and the light fell so
It crowned their heads like a saints halo
My heart said yes till my eyes said no

[Verse 3]
I saw Mama again and Dad among the funeral crowd
Dad was looking content
Of course Mom was laughing long and loud
They looked like visitors from another place and time
Not one you will find in this old world

[Chorus]
Oh no, that cant be right
All I suppose it was
Was a trick of the light
All I suppose it was
Was a trick of the light
