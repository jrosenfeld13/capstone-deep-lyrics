As it grooves, your body moves
Your body starts to get the feeling
And what you're feeling is happiness

Let your body go as you listen
Let it flow to your system
It'll take control of your mind
And make you move your behind

As it grooves
You feel the tension
In the air and now you're hype
You're getting down 'cause
The sound is just your type

Gn and D-o-s-e
Sticking it to you right
So come on, come on and
Party hearty all night and

[Chorus:]
Wiggle it just a little bit
I wanna see you
Wiggle it just a little bit
As it grooves
Wiggle it just a little bit
I wanna see you
Wiggle it just a little bit
As it grooves

Once the dj lets it spin
It'll penetrate your skin
It'll penetrate your soul
And make you lose control

The D-o-s-e's coming at you
Invading you like a body snatcher
Wether if you're drink or sober
This here groove is
Taking over your body

And now you're partying like
You never partied before
You're jumping up and down
Like crazy on the dance floor

You're getting busy like a bee
And that's the truth
I got a feeling there's
A fire on the roof

[Repeat Chorus]
I bet you're moving your body
From side to side
I bet the groove
That you're hearing
Is keeping you satisfied

Dancing by yourself
Is bad for your health
So grab a cutie by the hand
And tell her that you wanna dance
As it grooves

As it grooves
You feel the tension
In the air and now you're hype
You're getting down because
The sound is just your type

Gn and D-o-s-e
Sticking it to you right
So come on, come on
Party hearty all night and

[Repeat Chorus]
As it grooves
As it grooves
As it grooves

Rotate your waist just a tad
Better yet, get bad
Get nasty, get naughty
And if you wanna crack a forty

But don't drink it
If you're driving
Word 'em up, y'all
I ain't jiving

Just kicking it live and making you
Wiggle it just a little bit

And now you're partying like
You've never partied before
You're jumping up and down
Like crazy on the dance floor

You're getting busy like a bee
And that's the truth
I got a feeling there's a fire

[Repeat Chorus]
