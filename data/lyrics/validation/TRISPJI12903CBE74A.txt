All of my love, all of my kissin'
You don't know what you've been a-missin'
Oh boy, when you're with me, oh boy
I want the world to see that you were meant for me

All of my life, I've been a-waitin'
Tonight, there'll be no hesitatin'
Oh boy, when you're with me, oh boy
I want the world to see that you were meant for me

Stars appear and shadows fallin'
You can hear my heart callin'
A little bit of lovin' makes everything right
I'm gonna see my baby tonight

All of my life, I've been a-waitin'
Tonight, there'll be no hesitatin'
Oh boy, when you're with me, oh boy
I want the world to see that you were meant for me

Stars appear and shadows fallin'
You can hear my heart callin'
A little bit of lovin' makes everything right
I'm gonna see my baby tonight

All of my life, I've been a-waitin'
Tonight, there'll be no hesitatin'
Oh boy, when you're with me, oh boy
I want the world to see that you were meant for me

Stars appear and shadows fallin'
You can hear my heart callin'
A little bit of lovin' makes everything right
I'm gonna see my baby tonight

All of my life, I've been a-waitin'
Tonight, there'll be no hesitatin'
Oh boy, when you're with me, oh boy
I want the world to see that you were meant for me

That you were meant for me
