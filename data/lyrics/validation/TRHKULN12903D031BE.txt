So round, so firm, so fully packed
That's my gal
So complete from front to back
That's my pal

Toasted by the sun
And I'm a son of a gun
If she don't make my five o'clock shadow
Come around at one

You can bet your boots I'd walk a mile
Through the snow
Just to see her toothbrush smile
They mentioned on the radio

If you don't think she's a lot of fun
Just ask the man that owns one
So round, so firm, so fully packed
That's my gal

So round, so firm, so fully packed
That's for me
She's just like a money back
Guarantee

Like a bar fly goes for a drink
Like the Bobby Sox goes for Frank
Just like Jesse James would go
For money in the bank

From head to foot she's perfect size
She's a whiz
Always wears a forty five
Gun that is

She's got the look that's so impressive
She's got the pause that's so refreshing
So round, so firm, so fully packed
That's my gal

She's done told me that I'm top hand
Won't be long 'til she wears my brand
So round, so firm, so fully packed
That's my gal
