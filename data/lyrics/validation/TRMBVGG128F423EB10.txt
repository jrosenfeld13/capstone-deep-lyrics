Some lucky bum
Took away my right to some
Sweet honey love
Look what's been done to me look what i've become
In for the fight fo your life today
I'm giving you a head start
You better run bum
Look what you've done what you've become
One unlucky bum
Coo coo coo coo quitter
Coo coo coo coo quitter
Run for cover or run to win
What will end your suffering
