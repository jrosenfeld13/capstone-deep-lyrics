You've got your plans to do things right
I've got my mind it's all made up
We have our time
But now it's running out of space
You know my life is just a speck
And your heart is all the same
See I've been staring too long at the screen
Oh God, my mind is such a mess
But there's these things I got to do
You were my friend
But now you're taking off your clothes
I tried to look, but close my eyes
I took a breath and made you mine
You had your arms all tangled up in the moon

Whats say
That night you took away a little more than just my breath
I swear to God that I was thinking about the summer
Or the words that I wrote on the walls that saved my life
I don't care if I will ever be the same
But everything just keeps reminding me of winter
Like the drive that I took on the night I lost my mind

So, where's my hope in all of this?
I guess it never did exist
I wrote those songs
And took them all to heart
You know I'm proud of what we did
I left you naked and apart
With your thoughts all laid out in your room
So what if there's something that I missed
I know you found a way to start
I see the men that had you tearing up you head
That's my excuse to make a mark, when you're all tangled up in red
I had you tricked, but then you grabbed me by the throat

Whats say
That night you took away a little more than just my breath
I swear to God that I was thinking about the summer
Or the words that I wrote on the walls that saved my life
I don't care if I will ever be the same
But everything just keeps reminding me of winter
Like the drive that I took on the night I lost my mind

I hope you break through all of this
I hear you tearing up your fists
With all those walls that broke your heart
I'm oh so sick of everything you wrote
I'll hold you true to every breath that we spoke of in this room
So where's your pride, and all of your friends?
I hear you making this a story that we hope will never end

I hope you break through all of this
I hear you tearing up your fists
With all those walls that broke your heart
I'm oh so sick of everything you wrote
I'll hold you true to every breath that we spoke of in this room
So where's your pride, and all of your friends?
I hear you making this a story that we hope will never end

Are these just the nights that we stayed for?
Are these all the lines that could keep us here? [4x]
