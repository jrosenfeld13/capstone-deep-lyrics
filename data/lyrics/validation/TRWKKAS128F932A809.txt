You're the sweetest thing that there's ever been
You can make history just by walking in
You're an animal lover, this cat thinks you're a kitten
I want to rabbit about you to anyone who'll listen

'Cause you're OK, you're alright
Don't have to be blind to know that you're outta sight
And having said that, my dear
How I wish that you were here

You know you can charm the birds right down from the trees
You can make a grown man cry just by saying please
You're an olympic runner, stop them in their tracks
When you leave the field behind they keep on coming right back

'Cause you're OK, you're alright
Don't have to be blind to know that you're outta sight
And having said that, my dear
How I wish that you were here

Well, you're the tops, you're the best
You put in the shade all the rest
Must admit, I must say
Little darling you are so...

OK, you're alright
Don't have to be blind to know that you're outta sight
And having said that, my dear
How I wish that you were here

Yeah, you're OK, you're alright
Don't have to be blind to know that you're outta sight
And having said that, my dear
How I wish that you were here
