Well, it's a teenage boogie on a Saturday night

A teenage boogie (hey hey)
A teenage boogie (ho ho)
A high schooly boogie (hey hey)
A hillbilly boogie (ho ho)
A teenage boogie (teenage boogie)
It's a teenage boogie on a Saturday night

Saturday night about eight o'clock
This old place begins to reel and rock
Everybody gathers from miles around
To hear them sing as they shuffle on down
A teenage boogie (teenage boogie)
It's a teenage boogie on a Saturday night

A teenage boogie (hey hey)
A teenage boogie (ho ho)
A high schooly boogie (hey hey)
A hillbilly boogie (ho ho)
A teenage boogie (teenage boogie)
It's a teenage boogie on a Saturday night

They ramble and they jamble till broad daylight
They sing and they jive and everything's right
A teenage boogie on a Saturday night
A high schooly boogie makes everything right
A teenage boogie (teenage boogie)
It's a teenage boogie on a Saturday night

A teenage boogie (hey hey)
A teenage boogie (ho ho)
A high schooly boogie (hey hey)
A hillbilly boogie (ho ho)
A teenage boogie (teenage boogie)
It's a teenage boogie on a Sat-ur-day night
