Baby likes to rock it like a boogie woogie choo choo train (train)
She got the boogie woogie woogie spread all over the place
Got it stacked to the ceiling got it stickin in your face
You know my baby likes to rock it like a boogie woogie choo choo train

She said her name was emergency, and asked to see my gun
Said her telephone number was 9-1-1
Got brother Jimmy on the TV, killer on the stereo
She said if you want to get it, you got to let it go
She got the boogie woogie woogie spread all over the place
You got it stacked to the ceiling got it stickin in your face
You know my baby likes to rock it like a boogie woogie choo choo train
