I'm in need of something refreshing
Think I need a soft drink

Think I need something to calm me down, I get in a state
Can't seem to cope with mixing my drink and work these days
I'm going down, drown for the third time in the froth and dregs
Try to walk across the floor but I can't feel my legs

Oh anyone here help me find my way to bed
How can I hope to cope with an aching head?
Bababada etc

Just let me feel the thrill of it fizzing up my nose
I can even feel the blood returning to my toes
I'm going down, drown for the third time in the froth and dregs
I try to walk across the floor but I can't feel my legs

Oh anyone here got an antidote to take
How can I hold my beer when I've got the shakes?
Bababada etc

Think I need something to calm me down, I get in a state
Can't seem to cope with mixing my drink and work each day
I'm going down, drown for the third time in the froth and dregs
Try to walk across the floor but I can't feel my legs
My legs, my legs...
