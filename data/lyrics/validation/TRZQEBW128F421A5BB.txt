Where do I sleep tonight?
And where did I leave my mind?
I'll end up on the floor
And these words will do just fine

I remember nights spent up on rooftops
I remember bike rides in the rain
We spray painted all their signs to what we wanted them to say
But we got so far away

It was a matter of time between the age that we left reason
And the day we chose to leave it
I'd rather stop the beat then
Fucking waste my life

Skating on the ice between politics and treason
Where all the problems stem and what's it all to say
If this all just a pipe dream then the plumbing's slowly leaking
His ink says we're still breathing so this is why I try, and I have to say goodbye

So where do I sleep tonight?
And where did I leave my mind?
I'll end up on the floor
And these words will do just fine

The things we did to get even were messing with my mind
And I know you had your reasons but I did too
We had to see this through and leave the rest behind
And I know you had your reasons but I did too

If I could take it back and you could take it back
We'd end up back where we were
If I could take it back and you could take it back
We'd end up back where we were
