Now I can't connect with what I feel
Don't really know if I ever will
Have I lost my edge? have I lost my edge?
Our hair was messy and our clothes were trendy
We were always late but it felt so early
We shared our dreams in a special frenzy
And our parents thought we were all just lazy

That's right
Now I can't connect with what I feel
Don't really know if I ever will
Have I lost my edge? have I lost my touch?
Our hair was messy and our clothes were trendy
We would never say yes but always maybe
We based our songs on our modern friendship
And our parents thought we were all just crazy
Now I can't connect with what I feel
Don't really know if I ever will

Have I lost edge?lost my touch?
Does it really matter that much?
And I can't dig in, feel my songs
At least not the way that I did before
Have I lost my edge? lost my style?
Will it be gone after a while?
Now I can't connect with what I feel
Don't really know if I ever will
Have I lost my edge? I lost my touch?
Does it really matter that much?
Have I lost my edge? lost my style?
Will it be gone after a while?
Have I lost my head? am I a fool?
Maybe I've never even been that cool!
