Blue for the blue I feel when I'm feeling down
And the ground, feeling down
It could be most any day

Green for the ice, take a look around
When the sun goes down
And the sun goes down in the strangest way

Red for the light, gotta stop this thing
Find a song to sing that is everything
That I meant to say
I meant to say

Green for the mice and I try like the world
Never see the good that's done the bad
It's too late to see

Two of us make it easier
To read the signs, memorize the lines
Won't you stay with me?

One for the road, I'll be on my way
Come another day when the things we say
Find a way to be
A way to be

[Hook]
Autumn calls for a change of year
Bringing winter near, of green to brown
And the sky's a sign
Wintertime is a razor blade
That the devil made, it's the price we pay
For the summertime

Spring days come and it's hard to know
Where the rain comes from, where the children go
It's a nursery rhyme
A nursery rhyme

[sound of breathing]
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahhhhh....
