[Verse 1]
Grooving around in a trench coat
With the satin on trail
Seems to be all around its tin and lead pail, we pale
Jiving on down to the beach
To see the blue and the gray
Seems to be all and it's rosy-it's a beautiful day!

[Chorus]
Will you please keep on the track
'cause I almost want you back
'cause I know what you are
You are a gigolo aunt, you're a gigolo aunt!
Yes I know what you are
You are a gigolo aunt, you're a gigolo aunt!

[Verse 2]
Heading on down with the light, the dust in your way
She was angrier there, than her watershell male
Life to this love to me - heading me down to me
Thunderbird shale
Seems to be all and it's rosy - it's a beautiful day!

[Chorus]
Will you please keep on the track
'cause I almost want you back
'cause I know what you are
You are a gigolo aunt, you are a gigolo aunt
Yes I know what you are
You are a gigolo aunt, you're a gigolo aunt!

[Verse 3]
Grooving on down in a knapsack su-perlative day
Some wish she move and change as she kind move jiving away
She made the scene should have been su-perlative day
Everything's all and it's rosy, it's a beautiful day

[Chorus]
Will you please keep on the track
'cause I almost want you back
'cause I know what you are
You are a gigolo aunt, you are a gigolo aunt
Yes I know what you are
You are a gigolo aunt, you're a gigolo aunt!
