After the caskets put into the ground
Loved ones crying walk away
Corpse unknowingly left behind
Other needs for sick human prey

Casket closed as mourners read
Pages from their holy book
Waiting in a meat locker
Morticians meal hangs from a hook

Storing dead carcases to dine upon
Chewing on rotten arms and legs
Brutal desecration of the dead
Hacking bodies until he's fed

Service for a vacant coffin
Corpse is being digested
Chronic hunger for cold flesh
Remains of the dead are molested
