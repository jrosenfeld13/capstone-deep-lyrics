Like a hole in a 45
There's an emptiness in all our lives
Lost innocence in tired eyes

And there's oil burning in the east
But it isn't for the lamp of peace
Were already dead, the breathing deceased

People suffer but we just need what we need
Leaving marks in backs, wish I could change the past but

So we spend these beer stained nights
Searching for the things that I won't find
Revolving doors of internal wars
(Someone please sew my mouth shut)

Supporting afghan renegades
With a rose and a razorblade
Hitting pipes under city lights

Hung himself on Christmas day
Day I heard his best friend say
Everyone he loves are in their graves

Stuck in these lonely caves we fucking can't escape
Straws, empty bags and a broken Ramones tape

So we spend these beer stained nights
Searching for the things that I won't find
Meaningless sex, whose sheets am I in?
It's uneasy stench stains my skin
We're all reading out last rights with self-hate crimes
Panhandling for hope under smog filled skies
(Someone please sew his mouth shut)

Give us something to ease this pain
Take it all but it won't go away
Bloodstained we walk in vain
Straight-jacketWe're being restrained!

Give us something to ease this pain
Take it all but it won't go away
Bloodstained but all hope is not in vain
Motionless Release the chains!

10,000 beer stained nights
Searching for the things that I won't find
Burning cross on my TV screen
The tension won't seize there will be no peace
So read me my last rights with self-hate crimes
Tied down she shot it up-we said goodbye
It's all been misery on a mainline
