[Verse 1]
You've got your mother and your brother
Every other undercover telling you what to say (say)
You think I'm stupid, but the truth is that it's cupid, baby
Lovin' you has made me this way
So before you point your finger
Get your hands off of my trigger
Oh, yeah
You need to know this situation's getting old
And now the more you talk the less I can take, oh

[Chorus]
I'm looking for attention
Not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well, if you don't have the answer
Why are you still standin' here?
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Just walk away
Just walk away
Just walk away

[Verse 2]
I waited here for you
Like a kid waiting after school
So tell me how come you never showed (showed)?
I gave you everything
And never asked for anything
And look at me
I'm all alone (alone)
So, before you start defending
Baby, stop all your pretending
I know you know I know
So what's the point in being slow?
Let's get the show on the road today
Hey!

[Chorus]
I'm looking for attention
Not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well, if you don't have the answer
Why are you still standin' here?
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Just walk away
Just walk away
Just walk away

[Bridge]
I wanna love
I want a fire
To feel the burn, my desires
I want a man by my side
Not a boy who runs and hides
Are you gonna fight for me?
Die for me?
Live and breathe for me?
Do you care for me?
'Cause if you don't, then boy just leave

[Chorus]
I'm looking for attention
Not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well, if you don't have the answer
Why are you still standin' here?
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Just walk away
Just walk away
Just walk away

[Outro]
If you don't have the answer
Walk away
Just walk (walk) away
(Just walk away)
Then just leave
Yeah, yeah
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
