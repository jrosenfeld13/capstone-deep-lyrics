We're in a new state
A state used to burn
I know there's no need for us to lose control
But I know there's something large just hiding in the dark
Big white elephant
We're on our way down
A falling empire
All eyes
Always down
Wake up
Don't you dare to let us down
We are an empire reckoning love of the big mistakes
That are swept under our bed
We are an empire
My dear
We're giving up the coast for a big white elephant
We're on our way down
A falling empire
All eyes
Always down
Wake up
Don't you dare to let us down
All eyes
Always down
Wake up
Don't you dare to let us down
All eyes
Always down
Wake up
Don't you dare to let us down
All eyes
Always down
Wake up
Don't you dare to let us down
(All eyes)
(Oh)
(All eyes)
(All eyes)
(Oh)
(All eyes)
(All eyes)
(Oh)
(All eyes)
