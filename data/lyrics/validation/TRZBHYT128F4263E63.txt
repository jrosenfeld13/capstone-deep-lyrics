Here we are, watch the sparks that makes the flame
A face we know by many other names
The equation broken down so easily
We must poise ourselves so patiently

It's the apple of my eye that sends a trail
Of shivers speeding down my spine

There's a maker on the ball
There's a faker who expects it all
Pick a passion to believe
There's an eye that sees it happening

It's the hit that knocks the wind right out of me
Catch my breath

I start salivating in anticipation
Ask me if I'm happy just to have a chance
At following your lead, yes, indeed

Seeing through the eyes of a king upon his throne

I start salivating in anticipation
Ask me if I'm happy just to have a chance at following
And each and every one of us
Who has ever had to feel it from afar, here we are
