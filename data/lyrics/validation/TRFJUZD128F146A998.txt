You and I have been
Through times both good and bad
And I have seen
The both of us so sad
And I would be incomplete
Without you in my life
Now I want you to see
You mean the world to me

I've been lookin' at my life
And all the things that make it right
So many friends they come and go
But you're the only one who truly knows
What's in my heart what's in my mind
The only one who took the time
You and I have been
Through times both good and bad
And I have seen
The both of us so sad
And I would be incomplete
Without you in my life
Now I want you to see
You mean the world to me

I've been thinking for so long (I need you)
Give me the strength to carry on (I want to thank you)
What's in my heart what's in my mind
The only one who took the time
To let me know you're there for me
The only one who took the time
To find me
You and I have been
Through times both good and bad
And I have seen
The both of us so sad
And I would be incomplete
Without you in my life
Now I want you to see
You mean the world to me
To me to me
