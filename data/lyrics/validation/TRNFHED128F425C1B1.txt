M dancing with your darkened soul
Must be murder and love at the same time
Ive been caged by the dead of night
Im smelling blood and awake for the second time
The deepest glance upon your face
Im spellbound by your kiss
Was never touched like this before
Was never kissed like this before
My blood runs faster into the cold
Im nearly dead but I will rise again
The deepest glance upon your face
Im spellbound by your kiss
Get faster
Reach devil
