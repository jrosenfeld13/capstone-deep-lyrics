Have you ever ridden horses
Through a rainstorm
Or a lion through a busy street bazaar
There are many things
I'd love to turn you on to
But I somehow feel
They're safer where they are
Well, some people are
Inbound with infatuation
And some others spill
Depression as the law
From one's mother
Getting at no imagination
So beware then
Maybe sin is at everyone's door
Yes, there's a man I know
With no expression
He's got none at all
Yes, there's a man that I know
With no expression
He's got none at all
But you never, no
You would never see this man laughing
Come to think of it
I've never seen him cry

But he might be sitting
And you hear him singing
But by and by he'll stop and sigh before
His voice would even begin to speak
And he'd just cry
Yes, there's a man I know
With no expression
He's got none at all
Yes, there's a man that I know
With no expression
He's got none at all
Have you ever ridden horses
Through a rainstorm
Or a lion through a busy street bazaar
There are many things
I'd love to turn you on to
But I somehow feel
They're safer where they are
Yes, there's a man I know
With no expression
He's got none at all
Yes, there's a man that I know
With no expression
He's got none at all
