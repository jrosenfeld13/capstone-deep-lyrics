She's like the swallow that flies so high
She's like the river that never runs dry
She's like the sunshine on the lee shore
I love my love and love is no more

Its out of wild roses she made a bed
A stony pillow for her head
She laid her down no word she spoke
Until this fair maid's heart was broke

Shes like the swallow that flies so high
Shes like the river that never runs dry
Shes like the sunshine on the lee shore
I love my love and love is no more

I love my love and love is no more
