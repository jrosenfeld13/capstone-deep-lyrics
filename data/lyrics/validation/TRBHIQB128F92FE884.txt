He drinks the blood of angel
As he's chewin' up their wings
Relentless in his pursuit of destroying everything
He'll hold your world in one claw
And shred it with the other
And when he's through with your life
He'll move on to another

As the glowing eyes get ready to pounce

From town, cruse around
Koffin kat rock
He's our demon kat
Koffin kat rock
Chaos is his goal
Koffin kat rock
Clawing at your soul
Koffin kat rock

Well he's hiding in the darkest shells
Of man's ? ? ? ?
And when it wants to feed on flesh
Its bound to get its way
The children in the back yard
Are easiest to prey
The koffin kat will never stop
We're not 'bout to take it away
Oh baby, away? No

From town, cruse around
Koffin kat rock
He's our demon kat
Koffin kat rock
Chaos is his goal
Koffin kat rock
Clawing at your soul
Koffin kat rock

He drinks the blood of angels
As he's chewin' off their wings
Relentless in his pursuit of destroying everything
He'll hold your world in one claw
And shred it with the other
And when he's taken your life
He'll move on to another

As the glowing eyes get ready to pounce

From town, cruse around
Koffin kat rock
He's our demon kat
Koffin kat rock
Chaos is his goal
Koffin kat rock
Clawing at your soul
Koffin kat rock
