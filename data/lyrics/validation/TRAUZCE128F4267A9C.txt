[Instrumental Intro]

Stick up your hands
You must stand and deliver
My stomach's empty
My clothes are all torn
Open your hearts to the joys of the giver
Only your pockets are terribly worn

This is a holdup
No way to mistake it
We're men of violence
So don't fool around
If you have money
We're going to take it
You try and stop us
You'll end underground

When we get your money
We'll ride towards the sunset
At Rosas Canteen
We'll stop by the door
We'll spend all your money
Just getting the nose wet
Tomorrow evening
We'll be back for more

So hand us the money
Don't stand there and shiver
Tax time is coming
Give alms to the poor
Or Ill put a bullet right through your best liver
Wealth is disease
And I am the cure

[Instrumental Bridge]
When we get your money
We'll ride towards the sunset
At Rosas Canteen
We'll stop by the door
We'll spend all your money
Just getting the nose wet
Tomorrow evening
We'll be back for more

So hand us the money
Don't stand there and shiver
Tax time is coming
Give alms to the poor
Or Ill put a bullet right through your best liver
Wealth is disease
And I am the cure
