Hey listen people, I'd like to say
A million minds have a choice but
They choose to walk this way
So when it's time to
Make your decisions true
Remember who it is you're fighting for it's you
No one can tell you how you shuld feel inside
What's right from wrong is a choice
You make up in your own mind
Think you shoud, well you got time
No matter what the case may be
You can demand
You can demand what you want and take it you can
Command all the rules and take them you can demand
And when the times
Your wasted to do more
Just keep you head out of the clouds
And keep your feet on the floor
And when you think that at times
It's tough to do
Remember who it is you're
Looking out for you
Don't let them trick you with fancy words
As long as you're able to see through the lines
You'll be just fine
Think you should hurry well you got time
No matter what the cause may be you can demand
You can demand what you need and I'll tell you
If you can't understand this way of life
Your way of living how you don't like won't
Suffice, look at all the things you have
Then decide it's your life and realize
You can demand
