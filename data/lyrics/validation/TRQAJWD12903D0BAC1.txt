If you're in
I want out
Fuck you all
Good bye
Such a shame
It's been real
Hope you all die
Make a break for better days
Watch the world burning below
Vow we're not looking to make amends

Let them eat crow!
In search of life on status quo, so Godspeed, go!
Our Northern Lights are getting low, so Godspeed, go!
Taste the pain
Smell the burn of the first kill
Watched your face enjoy the ride like a pink pill
Never tell, promise?
Don't need to know nothing but the best
Civilization, or social unrest
In search of life on status quo, so Godspeed, go!
Our Northern Lights are getting low, so Godspeed, go!
