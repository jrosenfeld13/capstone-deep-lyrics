I paid the full lip service to the repercussions
Which is to say, I weighed the risk reward
But who can budget for a fallout of these proportions?
Take your shot, that's what you pay me for
Nobody said you're getting away with murder
Here, smile into the hidden camera with your friend
She didn't ask if we were on or off the record
Or what that may or what that may not mean
When you went away, I thought that I was free
How wrong can you be? How wrong can you be?
Fortune hits the wall and the whole 500 fall
How wrong can you be? How wrong can you be?
I didn't see it at the time as a conflict of interests
A pretty girl at the wheel of a German car
It isn't hard to surrender to market forces
Take your seat, become the passenger
Nobody said we're getting away with murder
No looking in the rear view mirror, foot to the floor
She didn't say I'm working for the competition
A pretty girl at the wheel of a German car
When you went away, I thought that I was free
How wrong can you be? How wrong can you be?
Fortune hits the wall and the whole 500 fall
How wrong can you be? How wrong can you be?
