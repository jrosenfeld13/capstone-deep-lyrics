The moon is not only beautiful
It is so far away
The moon is not only ice cold
It is here to stay

When I lay me down
Will you still be around
When they put me six feet underground
Will the big bad beautiful you be around

Everyone says they know you
Better than you know who
Everyone says they own you
More than you do

When I lay me down
Will you still be around
When they put you six feet underground
Will the big bad beautiful moon be around

Cause the moon is not only beautiful
It is so far away
The moon is not only ice cold
It is here to stay

Everyone says they know you
Better than you know who
Everyone says they own you
More than you do
