I can't believe what he's done for me
It makes me want to cry
I don't know why you put me here
But I'm sure you have your reasons
Why have you put me here?
Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining
I don't know what's gonna happen next
But my faith's in you
You've gotten me this far
My life is going so fast
I need to sit back and take it all in
Without god I wouldn't be here now
My dreams are turning into everyday life
Things I thought would never happen are happening all the time
All my wishes are coming true because of you
All my dreams are coming true
And I don't know what's gonna happen next
