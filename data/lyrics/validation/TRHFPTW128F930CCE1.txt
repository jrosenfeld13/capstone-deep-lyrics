Have you heard about this house?
Inside, a thousand voices talk
And that talk echoes around and around
The windows reverberate
The walls have ears
A thousand saxophone voices talk

You should hear how we syllogize
You should hear
About how Babel fell and still echoes away
How we idolize
Theorize
Syllogize
In the dark
In the heart

All I hear is...
Talk!
All I hear is...
Talk!
Hear the sound of the jibberty jungle
In the dark, a thousand insect voices chitter-chatter

The sun goes up
Goes over
Goes down
I seek sleep
I sleep
I forget
