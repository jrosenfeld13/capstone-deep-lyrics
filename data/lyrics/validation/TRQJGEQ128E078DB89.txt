I'm sorry I never listened
I was selfish with my time
I know you don't believe me now but you were always on my mind
I know I've had two chances
You've already said goodbye
But please just reconsider once and give me one more try

Give me one more try
Give me one more try
Give me one more try
Give me one more try

Too much time on my hands lately
And I think too much
I think I'm out of touch
But all that's changing now
'Cause I've seen right through
But I won't see through you

Come with me
Come with me
Come with me
Give me one more try
Give me one more try
Give me one more try
Give me one more try

Dark clouds hang overhead
And obscure the view
When all along I knew
Still go sprightly now
There's fresh air today
This flame hasn't faded you say

Come with me
Come with me
Come with me
Give me one more try

I'm sorry I never listened
I was selfish with my time
I know you don't believe me now but you were always on my mind
I know I've had two chances
You've already said goodbye
But please just reconsider once and give me one more try

Give me one more try

I'm sorry I never listened
I was selfish with my time
I know you don't believe me now but you were always on my mind
I know I've had two chances
You've already said goodbye
But please just reconsider once and give me one more try

I'm sorry I never listened
I was selfish with my time
I know you don't believe me now but you were always on my mind
I know I've had two chances
You've already said goodbye
But please just reconsider once and give me one more try

Give me one more try
