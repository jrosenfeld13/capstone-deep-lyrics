[Verse 1]
We're in the door, I get a smile from a fly boy
He's seen me before, and makes his move like a fly boy
I'm sick and tired of them fly boys
So bye bye boy
I'm in the lounge, I get a wink from a bad boy
He comes around, all puffed up like a bad boy
I'm sick and tired of them bad boys

[Chorus]
Cause I got my eye on this other guy
That can improve with his poise, he's on that no doubt
And tonight I don't mind me a shy boy, so I gotta know
Are you a shy boy?

[Verse 2]
I'm by the stage, I get a look from a rock boy
He's got the shades on indoors, like a rock boy
I'm sick and tired of them rock boys
So bye bye boy
Out on the floor, I get the moves from a homeboy
Tryin to score, his body rocks like a homeboy
I'm sick and tired of them homeboys

[Chorus]
Cause I got my eye on this other guy
That can improve with his poise, he's on that no doubt
And tonight I might need a shy boy, so I gotta know
Are you a shy boy?

[Bridge]
Free boy, fresh boy, slick boy
You're messin with the tomboy
Might just knock you out like a school boy
Crude boy, playboy, cowboy
I heard it all before boy
I'm goin out to get me a shy boy

[Chorus]
Cause I got my eye on this other guy
That can improve with his poise, he's on that no doubt
And tonight I might need a shy boy, so I gotta know
Cause I got my eye on this other guy
That can improve with his poise, he's on that no doubt
And tonight I might need a shy boy, so I gotta know
Are you a shy boy?
Shy boy
Shy boy
Shy boy
