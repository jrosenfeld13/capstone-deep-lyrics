[Verse 1]
No need to whine, boy
Like a windup toy you stutter at my feet
And it's never the time, boy
You've had too much wine to stumble up my street
Well, it isn't a problem
Nothing we can't keep between the sheets
Tell me you're mine, love
And I will not wait for other bedtime treats

[Chorus]
Is it something you lack
When I'm flat on my back?
Is it something that I can do for you?
It's always someone you hate
Or it's something you ate
Tell me is it the way that I touch you?
Have you found a new mate
And is she really great?
Is it just that I'm much too much for you?
Woah!

[Verse 2]
Don't feed me a line, boy
I can hear that voice you use upon the phone
And there's no need to be coy
That is something you can do upon your own
Well, it isn't a problem
Nothing we can't solve so just relax
Am I on the wrong train love?
And will I have to tie you to the tracks?

[Chorus]
Is it something you lack
When I'm flat on my back?
Is it something that I can do for you?
It's always someone you hate
Or it's something you ate
Tell me is it the way that I touch you?
Have you found a new mate
And is she really great?
Is it just that I'm much too much for you?

Woah!
I really want you to
Woah!
I really want you to
Woah!
