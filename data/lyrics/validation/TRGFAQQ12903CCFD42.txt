I'm gonna work my way out of this jam
I'm gonna be someone and know who I am
For right now, I don't think that I do

We could leave this place and fly far away
Let's escape this town, the streets and the cars and the crowds
Then into the clouds

Where nothing could stop us, nothing forever
Nothing could stop us, if we stick together

I might be dreaming but I think I believe
I might be seeing things that aren't quite real
But right now, I don't care if I do

I didn't mean these words that I said back then
I'm sorry I would never, ever do that again
I promise that I won't

And now we're taking off, the journey begins
It's time to leave this place, the streets and the cars and the crowds
Then into the clouds

Foe some place faraway, forever ever
Stay the same, no never ever
Into the sky, then into the clouds
