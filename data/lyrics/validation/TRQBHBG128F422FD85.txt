Tonight's the night that we got the truck
We're going downtown, gonna beat up drunks
Your turn to drive, I'll bring the beer
It's the late, late shift, no one to fear

And ride, ride, how we ride
And ride, low ride

It's a roundup time where the good whores meet
We're gonna drag one screaming off the street

And ride, ride, how we ride

Got a black uniform and a silver badge
We're playin' cops for real, we're playin' cops for pay

Let's ride, lowride

[Break]

Pull down your dress, here's a kick in the ass
Let's beat you blue till you shit in your pants
Don't move, child, got a big black stick
There's six of us, babe, so suck on my dick!

And ride, ride, how we ride
Let's ride, low ride

The left newspapers might whine a bit
But the guys at the station, they don't give a shit
Dispatch calls, "Are you doing something wicked?"
"No siree, Jack, we're just givin' tickets!"

Let's ride, ride, how we ride
And ride, ride, how we ride
And ride, ride, how we ride
Let's ride, low ride
