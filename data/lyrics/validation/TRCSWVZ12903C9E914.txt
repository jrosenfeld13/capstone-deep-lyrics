Is there something that you're trying to say?
Don't hold back now
It's been a long time since I felt this way
So don't hold back now
I purposely forgot about
Loving anyone
'Cause I'm the only one who has
Who has been stepped upon

Is there something that you're trying to say?
'Cause I can take it
'Cause I grew up a man this way
If I'm hurt I'll shake it
I'll crawl back into my cave
That's how I'll make it
Cause out of all this hurt we have
Beauty thus become
Beauty thus become

Chorus
In the mourning I can see the signs
No wonder I could never keep you satisfied
In the mourning I can see inside
Myself and all the things that you were trying to hide
In the mourning I can see the signs
No wonder I could never keep you satisfied
In the mourning I can see inside
Myself and all the things that you were trying to hide

Wishing all the best for you
And now I'll say goodbye
'Cause all the shit that we've been through
Put wisdom in my eyes
So walk away don't turn around
'Cause I won't be standing here
'Cause all the lies I've been living through
Are becoming very clear
And beauty thus become

In the mourning I can see the signs
No wonder I could never keep you satisfied
In the mourning I can see inside
Myself and all the things that I was trying to hide
In the mourning I can see the signs
No wonder I could never keep you satisfied
In the mourning I can see inside
Myself and all the things that I was trying to hide

Then you conned me into thinking
That all I had was you
The small insinuations
Were cutting me through were cutting me through
And now I stand alone here
Stronger then before
And I'll never go back never go back never go

In the mourning I can see the signs
No wonder I could never keep you satisfied
In the mourning I can see inside
Myself and all the things that I was trying to hide
In the mourning I can see the signs
No wonder I could never keep you satisfied
In the mourning I can see inside
Myself and all the things that you were trying to hide
In the mourning I can see the signs
No wonder I could never keep you satisfied
In the mourning I can see inside
Myself and all the things that you were trying to hide
In the mourning I can see the signs
No wonder I could never keep you satisfied
In the mourning I can see inside
Myself and all the things that you were trying to hide
