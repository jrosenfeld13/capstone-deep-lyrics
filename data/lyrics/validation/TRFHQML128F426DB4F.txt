[Verse 1]
As I look into your eyes I see the sunrise
The light behind your face helps me realize (Sunrise)
Will we sleep and sometimes love until the moon shines?
Maybe the next time I'll be yours and maybe you'll be mine

[Chrous 1]
I don't know if it's even in your mind at all
It could be me
At this moment in time
Is it in your mind at all?
It should be me
It could be me in your mind
Forever

[Verse 2]
Wondering through life will love come home to you
And the love you want forever, will they be true to you
(Shhhh)
Will we sleep and sometimes love until the moon shines?
Maybe the next time I'll be yours and maybe you'll be mine (You'll be mine)

[Chorus 2]
I don't know if it's even in your mind at all
It could be me
At this moment in time
Love's indescribable
It should be me
It could be me in your mind
Forever

[Bridge]
Easy, ready, willing, over time
Where does it stop where do you dare me to draw the line
You've got the body now you want my soul
Don't even think about it
Say "no go"

[Chorus 3]
(Sunrise)
I don't know if it's even in your mind at all
It could be me
At this moment in time
Is it in your mind at all?
It should be me
It could be me in your mind
Forever
(Sunrise)
At this moment in time
Is it in your mind at all?
It should be me
It could be me in your mind
Forever
Forever
(Sunrise)
