Johnny got shot through the grease
Drove his wheels through guarantee
Walked about with a monkey on his back
Torn pages of a coward's almanac
He got stuck between y-z
First letters of his own alphabet

Everythin' is cut and dry
The rooster crows 3 times
As he turns and goes
The rooster crows 3 times

A wise man told him about a song
First he had to blow the dust from his tongue
And Johnny said
Cannot see the mess I'm in
Can't seem to plug my organ in

Everythin' is cut and dry
The rooster crows 3 times
As he turns and goes
The rooster crows 3 times

Wished I had a bad, bad memory
For all my so-called friends to see
So keep on readin' between the lines
A frog's tongue freakin' at a jar of flies
If we never meet again
It's too soon
So let's not pretend
