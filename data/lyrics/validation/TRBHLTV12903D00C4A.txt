To the window the watcher came
And from the sky the ashes rained
As we danced
Lost in cities paved with gold
Their promises of fortune told
As we hide
Walls are breaking on us all

Don't leave me out here
One more day on my own
Can't give you up
Can't carry on
Don't leave me out here
One more night on my own
Can't give you up
Can't carry on

To catch the fire from the light
As we hide
From sleeping giants where they lie
And this time

I don't know when I'll be leaving
Maybe I have seen the burning of the sun
I believe in, I believe in
Miracles for some of us
