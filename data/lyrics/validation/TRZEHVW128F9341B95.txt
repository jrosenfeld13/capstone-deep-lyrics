When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you all the way
Happy to be near you
When you need someone to cheer you all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue sea is
That's how deep it goes

If it's real when somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you all the way
Through the good and lean years
And for all those in between years, come what may

Who knows where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way, all the way

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you all the way
Through the good and lean years
And for all those in between years, come what may

Who knows where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way, all the way
