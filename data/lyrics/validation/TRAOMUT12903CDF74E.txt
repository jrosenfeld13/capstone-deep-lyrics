Sunrise is hours away
Precious seconds of life
Drift away

Unnoticed, yet perfect
Slowly disappearing
I have found the edge
Have I found the answer?

Truth is my weapon
Your anger not enough
I wish to be alone
With my God
With my God

Moving through black waters
Leviathan
I wish to be alone
With my God

Have I found the answer?
The currents ebb and flow
The currents ebb and flow

Rising to the surface
From untold depths
Have I found the answer?
The currents ebb and flow

This fragile human condition
And cold necesity of death
Solitary and noble
Clarity briefly

Your breathing
Is my breathing
Your blood
Is my blood

Your breathing
Is my breathing
Your blood
Is my blood

I wish to be alone with my God
I am always part of you
Secret one, precious one

Dying a death so tender
Don't fear thy exorcist
Drift away
The currents ebb and flow
