It's like the heat never leaves
Point to face all random
Graven fears
So far from the humdrum
Poindexters and cigarettes
Trophy wives who haven't married yet
Graven fears
The firm and the gun-run

No kissing for free
Pre-requisites and nominees
All dissing for free
Street thieves and anomolies

The beat never leaves
Point to face all random
Meltdown nears
A living conundrum
Fashionistas, the minute set
Trophy wives who haven't married yet
Meltdown nears
So far from the humdrum

No kissing for free
Pre-requisites and nominees
All dissing for free
Street thieves and anomolies

Pray for the ancients
