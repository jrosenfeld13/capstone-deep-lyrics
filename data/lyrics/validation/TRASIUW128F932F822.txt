My dear stop complaining
My patience is waning
I don't give a damn anymore

For 6 years I waited
Angry and frustrated
I don't give a damn anymore

I've been locked up, been locked down
I've been held up in a showdown
I waited for you all the while

My gal I've been drifting
From Raleigh to Reno
My blood summons me to the road

My look's never good
But I did what I could
I don't give a damn anymore

I've been held up in bus stops
I've been lonesome in land lock
And I thought of you all the while

Your rope's getting tighter
My standards are higher
I don't give a damn anymore

Oh stiff boots and rawhide
I'm done with my old life
I don't give a damn anymore

I've been locked up been locked down
I've been held up in a showdown
I waited for you all the while

I've been stood up been broke down
I've been better back in this town
I'll saddle up soon and be gone

I'll saddle up soon and be gone
