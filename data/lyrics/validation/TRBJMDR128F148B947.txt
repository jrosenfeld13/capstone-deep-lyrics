I knew that you'll be no good for me
But I took the chance forever lasting loving tender
But now you're making life so hard for me to move along
Cause you knew my love was the best that you ever had

(Wanna move along)
I want the chance to get you out my head
(Can't take the move)
What's done is done there's no more to be said
(Oh pitiful)
But now I'm moving along without you
(No time to waste)
The rules of love I must learn before I start again

It's never too late, it's never too late, no
It's never too late to learn, you'll never know
It's never too late, it's never too late, no
It's never too late to learn

It's never too late, it's never too late, no
It's never too late to learn, you'll never know
It's never too late, it's never too late, no
It's never too late to learn

Among the world to become my reality I'm gonna make just fine
This time I'm gonna be strong and I'll do it right
No more relationships to send me out of my head
I'm gonna stay away, oh, oh, yeah
It's easier

(Don't wanna be afraid)
Don't need your friendship, don't need your love
(I'm on the mood)
I'm moving on living without you
(It's time to change)
The rules of love I must learn before
The rules of love I must learn before I start again

Never too late to learn, you'll never know
It's never too late, it's never too late, no
It's never too late to learn
It's never too late, it's never too late, no
It's never too late to learn, you'll never know
It's never too late, it's never too late, no
It's never too late to learn

It's never too late, it's never too late, no
It's never too late to learn, you'll never know
It's never too late, it's never too late, no
It's never too late to learn
It's never too late, it's never too late, no
It's never too late to learn, you'll never know
It's never too late, it's never too late, no
It's never too late to learn

It's never too late, it's never too late, no
It's never too late to learn, you'll never know
It's never too late, it's never too late, no
It's never too late to learn
It's never too late, it's never too late, no
It's never too late to learn, you'll never know
It's never too late, it's never too late, no
It's never too late to learn, you'll never know
