The way you
Fucked me up, a
Kind of poetic karma

And as I sit
At the bar with my friend Con
He tells me
I deserve it all

He says, "Now you know how it feels to be complete"

"I don't feel like that," I said, "I am now in hell"
He replies "you did before you fucked up
And had her you felt complete before you fucked up
Then you lost her
You see now you know what its like to be complete"
