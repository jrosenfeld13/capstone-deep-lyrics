[Verse 1]
I'm shaking hands with a heart attack
Slow twists and did the flip
Treadmill on the conveyer belt
Can't walk, your jeans will rip

[Chorus]
We're aiming for your eyes
For your eyes, for your eyes
Trophy bullets, trophy wives
We're aiming for your eyes
For your eyes, for your eyes
Trophy bullets, trophy wives, trophy wives
We're aiming for your eyes
For your eyes, for your eyes
Trophy bullets, trophy wives
We're aiming for your eyes

[Verse 2]
Inside the airway fighting
It's a hideaway for the season
Shot down another program
Guillotine punishment for treason
You whine 'cause no one's trying
Got no theory for the reason
And you clap 'cause you need violence
Guillotine, ugh (whoa)

[Chorus]
We're aiming for your eyes
For your eyes, for your eyes
Trophy bullets, trophy wives
We're aiming for your eyes
For your eyes, for your eyes
Trophy bullets, trophy wives
We're aiming for your eyes
For your eyes, trophy wives
We're aiming for your eyes, yeah, yeah
