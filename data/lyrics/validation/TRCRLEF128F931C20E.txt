You: you're everything I ever wanted to be
When you're here with me I just wanna lose me
In your love that rises to the sun
And says everything I never could think of

In silence we rise and we fall
Here for today then we're gone

But you: you'll always be my only real friend
I said you: I know you'll always be there 'til the end
You may say I'm holding on to something from the past
'cause they know nothing in this life will ever last

In silence we rise and we fall
Here for today, then we're gone
The time that we take to look back
These days and these moments have passed

I've running down the mountainside alone
I've been stuck out in the rain, and in the cold
I've been going down on the streets
I've been climbing up the mountain

'cause you: you're everything I ever wanted to be
When you're here with me I just wanna lose

In silence we rise and we fall (rise and we fall)
Here for today, then we're gone (here then we're gone)
The time that we take to look back (take to look back)
These days and these moments have passed

Then we're gone...
(into the night, oh)
