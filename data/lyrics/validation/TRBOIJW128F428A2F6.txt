Now I've been workin at this company for three years
You'd think by then that Id earned some repsect
But the company is run by high corporate fagits
Who're only interested in gaining more profit
And when I thought I wasn't getting my fair share
And I asked for a bigger cut of the wealth
They just told me to think again
And said that they could find someone else
Employer's Market
Nah they don't give a shit!
Still at this company for the fourth year
Guess I'm too lazy to find a better job
Maybe I'll see if K-Mart's still hirin
Or get an application at Jack-In-The-Box
And when I got caught out to lunch early
I got a lecture for 10 minutes long
And then he fired me right there at 1:30
That's what inspired me
To write this song!
