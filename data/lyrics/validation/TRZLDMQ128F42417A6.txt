My love is a storm
She doesn't wait for me
And now that she's gone
I fear that she'll never be
Back in my arms
Oh
She held me tight
And I just might
Be losing
Oh
When the rain comes down
The clouds will roll
Lord, and the wind will blow
You are my undertow
Caught in a rip tide
And I am currently in love with you

My love is an ocean
She glides like a seagull
She is the potion
That makes me emotional
She is a song
That the waves sing
To the shore
In the key of a gentle breeze
Oh
You are everything
To me
And more
You are my undertow
Caught in a rip tide
And I am currently in love with you

You are my undertow
Caught in a rip tide
And I am currently in love with you
Oh
You are my undertow
Caught in a rip tide
And I am
Currently in love with you
