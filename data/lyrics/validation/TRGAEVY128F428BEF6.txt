[Verse 1]
It is an S.O.S sent out telepathically
Signs of our distress don't allow complacency
We need restoration now of our integrity and
A drastic bold reminder of our morality,

[Pre-Chorus]
The rectifying troop is here
The ones we have needed all these years
To stop the heinous wrongdoings
And verify our moral benevolence as a people

[Chorus]
Operation
Operation rescue
They're here to right our fall
They have heard a troubled call
Operation
Operation rescue
You may wonder where they come from
But I just wonder why they're here at all

[Verse 2]
Life ever-after it's what they're in the business for
See them brandish the key to our kingdoms door
It's pervasive, a part of, part of you and me
But not overwhelming as they wish it to be

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If no one believed in fairy tales
There's nothing they could do but fail
Yet everywhere we look someone is
Trying to reassure our moral benevolence as a people

[Chorus]
Operation
Operation rescue
They're here to right our fall
They have heard a troubled call
Operation
Operation rescue
You may wonder where they come from
But I just wonder what compels them all

[solo]

[Outro]
Operation, operation rescue (x2)
You may wonder where they come from
But I just wonder what compels them all
