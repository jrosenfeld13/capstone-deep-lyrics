Jabawokee ding dong
Slip slap slee
Dipstick paddywhack
Pee pee googalee gee
Polly wolly sling slang
Skooey dibbily doo
Wing wong ping pong King Kong Cheech 'n Chong
Hop hip kagagoogoo

Hickory dickory slickory flip flap
Dip stick to my Lou
Flim flam wham blam Sam bam Cunningham
Whack snack koochie koochie koo
Plus you gotta dip, you gotta doodle
You gotta eat Grandma's stroodle
'Cause she stayed up all night to make it from scratch
You gotta gish, you gotta gash
You gotta wax Grandma's mustache
And lay out socks
To make sure they match
Whoa, you gotta help out your Grandma

Slappety dappety sling skism skasm
Bing bang boo
A yip, a yap, a snippety snap
Walla, walla scrappy dappy doo
Piddle paddle fiddle faddle widdle waddle
Awhee clunkety clang
A plop, a fizz, a whackety whiz
Chitty chitty bang wang lang
Zippity doo dang lipidee ay
Oompa loompa doo

Stinky winky linky foo man choo
Plus you gotta dip, you gatta doodle
You gotta shave Grandma's poodle
'Cause Grandma would do the same for you

You gotta libby, you gotta labby
You gotta hug Grandma, even though she's flabby
'Cause you should know Grandma's are people too
Whoa, you gotta love your Grandma

Now if you listened to the words of this song
You know they're comming straight from the heart
Never make fun of your Grandma
Even when he rips a juicy fart

And rember to dip you gotta doodle
You gotta stop playing with your noodle
'Cause Grandma said it would make you go blind
You gotta girpper, you gotta griper
You gotta change Grandma's diaper
And then pretend you really didn't mind
Whoa, respect to the Grandma
