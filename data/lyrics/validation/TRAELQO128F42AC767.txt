[Verse 1]
There's a story that my daddy tells religiously
Like clockwork every time he see's an opening
In a conversation, 'bout the way things use to be
I just roll my eyes and make a B-line for the door
I'd always end up starry eyed and cross legged on the floor
Hanging onto every word
Man, the things I heard
It was harder times and longer days
Five miles to school uphill both ways
We were cane switched raised and dirt floor poor
Course that was back before the war
Yea your uncle and I made quite a pair
Flying F-15's through hostile air
He went down but they missed me by a hair
He'd always stop right there and say

[Chorus]
That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
As your chins held high as the tears fall down
Gut sucked in, chest stuck out
Like a small town flag a flying
Or a new born baby crying
In the arms of the woman that you love
That's something to be proud of

[Verse 2]
Son graduating college, that was momma's dream
And I was on my way to anywhere else when I turned Eighteen
That's when you got a fast car, and think you got everything
I learned real quick those GTO's don't run off faith
I ended up broke down in some town north of L.A
Working maximum hours, for minimum wage
I fell in love next thing I know
Babies came and the car got sold
Sure do miss that old Hot Rod
But you sure save gas in them foreign jobs
Dad I wonder if I ever let you down
If you're ashamed how I turned out
Well he lowered his voice, then he raised his brow
Said let me tell you right now

[Chorus]
That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
No need to make a million just be thankful to be working
If you're doing what you're able
Putting food there on the table
And providing for the family that you love
That's something to be proud of

[Pre-Chorus]
And if all you ever really do is the best you can...
Well, you did it man

[Chorus]
That's something to be proud of
That's a life you can hang your hat on
As your chins held high as the tears fall down
Gut sucked in, chest stuck out
Like a small town flag a flying
Or a new born baby crying
In the arms of the woman that you love
That's something to be proud of
That's something to be proud of
That's something to be proud of
That's something to be proud of
Now that's something to be proud of
