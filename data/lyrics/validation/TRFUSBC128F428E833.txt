Pretend you're happy when you're blue
It isn't very hard to do
And you will find happiness without an end, if you pretend

Remember any one can dream
And nothings bad as it may seem
The little things you havn't got, could be a lot
If you pretend

You'll find a love you can share
One you can call your own
Just close your eyes and you'll be there
You'll never be alone

And if you sing this melody
You'll be pretending just like me
The world is mine, it can be yours, my friend
So why don't you pretend

You'll find a love you can share
One you can call your own
Just close your eyes and you'll be there
You'll never be alone
And if you sing this melody
You'll be pretending just like me
The world is mine, it can be yours, my friend
So why don't you pretend
So why don't you pretend
So why don't you pretend
