When we touch..
I feel something happen
When we breathe..
All the world is undone

Stay with me..
As my heart surrenders
Comfort me..
As I fall I cry..

Ohh.. ohh

When we sleep..
Darkness brings us release
All you need..
You can find it in me

Stay with me..
As my heart surrenders
Comfort me..
As I fall I cry

[Chorus x5]
Standin' in the rain
Twisted and insane
We, are, holdin' onto nothing

Feelin' every breath
Holdin' no regrets
We're, still, lookin' out for something
