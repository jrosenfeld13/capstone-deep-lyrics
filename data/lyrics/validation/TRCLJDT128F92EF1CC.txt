[Verse 1:]
A smoky room
A small caf
They come to hear you play
And drink and dance the night away
I sit out in the crowd
And close my eyes
Dream you're mine
But you don't know
You don't even know that I am there

[Chorus:]
I wish that I was in your arms
Like that Spanish guitar
And you would play me
Through the night 'til the dawn
I wish you'd hold me in your arms
Like that Spanish guitar
All night long
All night long
I'd be your song
I'd be your song

[Verse 2:]
Steal my heart
With every note you play
I pray you'll look my way
And hold me to your heart someday
I long to be the one
That you caress with tenderness
And you don't know
You don't even know that I exist

[Chorus:]
I wish that I was in your arms
Like that Spanish guitar
And you would play me
Through the night 'til the dawn
I wish you'd hold me in your arms
Like that Spanish guitar
All night long
All night long
I'd be your song
I'd be your song

[Bridge:]
Te sientas entre la gente
Cierras tu ojos
Y sueas que soy tuyo
Pero yo no s ni siquiera que estas ah
Me gustara tenerte entre mis brazos amor
I sit out in the crowd
And close my eyes
Dream you're mine
And you don't know
You don't even know that I exist

[Chorus:]
I wish that I was in your arms
Like that Spanish guitar
And you would play me
Through the night 'til the dawn
I wish you'd hold me in your arms
Like that Spanish guitar
All night long
All night long
I'd be your song
I'd be your song
