[Verse 1]
Got a surprise from my honey
Got a message from my girl
When she picked up a pen from beside her bed
And wrote me a scribbled note
Said she'd be coming back to see me
That she would be visiting real soon
Gonna get up from her long white bed
And leave this cold white room

[Chorus]
Well, whoo-hoo-hoo
Well, whoo-hoo-hoo
Well, whoo-hoo-hoo

[Verse 2]
We would once more live together
Go out on a lovin' spree
Just like before the accident
My baby would look at me
I saw her sweet face trembling
As she tried to open her eyes
I jumped with the joy of a grateful boy
The day my baby gave me a surprise

[Chorus]
Well, whoo-hoo-hoo
Well, whoo-hoo-hoo
Well, whoo-hoo-hoo

[Verse 3]
Got a surprise from my honey
Got a message from my girl
When she picked up a pen from beside her bed
And wrote me a scribbled note
I saw her sweet face trembling
As she tried to open her eyes
I jumped with the joy of a grateful boy
The day my baby gave me a surprise

[Chorus]
Well, whoo-hoo-hoo
Well, whoo-hoo-hoo
Well, whoo-hoo-hoo
Well, whoo-hoo-hoo
Well, whoo-hoo-hoo
Well, whoo-hoo-hoo
Well, whoo-hoo-hoo
Well, whoo-hoo-hoo
Well, whoo-hoo-hoo
