I have been waiting here
Feels like a million years
Sometimes I disappear
Into the blue
Lost in the city lights
I can stay out all night

But it's such a lonely life
And nothing, nothing seems right

But with the wave of your hand
Everything changes
With the wave of your hand
I feel your magic on me

And I have the spark of love
I have desire
And I'm drawn to the fire
With the wave of your hand

I never know what you'll find
Whenever you read my mind
It's just like I'm hypnotized
And then I come alive
You put a spell on me
That's right where I wanna be
And there's no mystery
Because I believe

With the wave of your hand
Everything changes
With the wave of your hand
I feel your magic on me

And I have the spark of love
I have desire
And I'm drawn to the fire
With the wave of your hand

With the wave of your hand
Everything changes
With the wave of your hand
I feel your magic in me .......
