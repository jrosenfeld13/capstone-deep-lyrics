My pretty willow tree
I cherish your charm
Tell me should I seek My Love
Search till he is found
My Prince is somewhere near
Did he pass your gate?
I know that for true love
It is never late
So among the trees
I run on tiptoes
I put on my favourite ring
Dance on the fresh grass
And sing my heart out
Oh, sing!
All of Dearest Men
You know I was true
Was a time when love lost
My blue had a deeper hue
I know there's no escape
When the pasion grows
And there's no way out
When the feeling flows
So among the trees
I run on tiptoes
I put on my favourite ring
Dance on the fresh grass
And sing my heart
Oh, sing!
Grandmother and mother tell me:
Just choose and follow your way
But I answer My Beloved Ones:
It's harder to do than say
