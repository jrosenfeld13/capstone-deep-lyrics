[Verse 1]
I am home
Lost my job
And incurably ill
You think this is easy, realism
I've got a girl out there, I suppose
I think she's dancing
Feel like Dan Dare lies down
I think she's dancing, what do I know?

[Chorus]
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around, no, can't turn around, no, oh ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around, no, turn around no, oh no
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I've got believers (kiss-kiss)
Believing me

[Verse 2]
One more weekend
Of lights and evening faces
Fast food, living nostalgia
Humble pie or bitter fruit

[Chorus]
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around, no, can't turn around, no, oh oooh
I am a D.J., I am what I say
Can't turn around, no, turn around, ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I've got believers (kiss-kiss)
Believing me

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around, no, can't turn around
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around, no, can't turn around
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no (kiss-kiss)

[Verse 3]
Time flies when you're having fun
Break his heart, break her heart
He used to be my boss and now he is a puppet dancer
I am a D.J., and I've got believers

[Outro]
I've got believers, I've got believers
I've got believers in me (I've got believers)
I am a D.J., I am what I play, I am a D.J
