Oh, if they knew what is really going through her mind
Oh, how she dazzles triumphant, there's no competition...
But when not dreaming
She thinks her world will fall apart
There's no one there to love her
And quench this burning passion

We, ordinary people
Sometimes frightened a little
Hiding our secret hopes
Want an ordinary love
Need someone to hold

If they only knew
What's going through her mind
If they only knew
How lonely is her life
If only we could see
Through other people's eyes
We might understand each other's hearts

Oh, if they knew, what is really going through his mind
He is so helpless, his head in the sand, day-and-nightmares
But the crowd around him believes he has the power
To change the world, stop wars and hunger
Yet for his dreams no one cares

We, ordinary people
Sometimes frightened a little
Hiding our secret hopes
Want an ordinary love
Need someone to hold
