Just beyond my windowpane, I saw you
Walking in the rain away from me
Visions of your future lay before you
You are free

I saw you in the company of strangers
Laughing just a little bit too loud
Looking at reflections in a mirror
I can see the smiling faces
But not me among the crowd
Wondering how

I wish that I could play this like a love song
So I could shape it like I wanted to
I'd make it purely from the heart
I know that surely from the heart
There only comes the gentlest of tunes
But where are you?

We tried to set the world on fire
And almost did with our desire
Two of us and maybe more
Kids inside a candy store
Sparks of joy and celebration
Suddenly we're drowned beneath the tears
And baby, you're the reason that
I haven't played this song in years
Yes baby, you're the reason that
I haven't played this song in years

Some believe in magic potions
Heads all full of crazy notions
Castles built upon a sandy shore
Only magic I believe in
Is the magic I receive from
Loving you and needing nothing more
Nothing more

We never heard each other's cries
That's how lovers turn to lies
When I gave, you wanted more
Then suddenly we're keeping score
I forgave your small deceptions
Till I couldn't hide my deepest fears
And baby, you're the reason that
I haven't played this song in years
Yes baby, you're the reason that
I haven' t played this song in years
