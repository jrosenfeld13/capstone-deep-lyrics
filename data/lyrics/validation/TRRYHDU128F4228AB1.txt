There is a face deep in your mind
One that your heart won't leave behind
Memories are cold-empty of laughs
And all that remains are photographs

(Chorus)
When she's gone there are no reasons
Nature's cruel - it's just different seasons
Going on and on

There is a voice deep in your soul
Telling you not to lose control
And day after day you hold back the tears
'Cos pain is the greatest of your fears

(Chorus)
There are no reasons
Say it's only different seasons
