It was early Sunday morning
I was running from the cold daylight
What's your name? I don't remember
Anything that happened late last night

Come on, baby, save me
Love me, betray me
I'm crazy, you break me
Ain't that every song that you love?

I got a little money
But that can only buy me love
A little game
Where nothing's ever good enough

A little fire. I'm insane
Another pitiful refrain
I want to get higher than Ive ever been
You take me there, Ill break you in

Come on, baby, save me
Love me, betray me
I'm crazy, you break me
Ain't that every song that you love, you love?

You love my eyes
My sweet disguise
I'll tell you what you
What you want to hear, my dear

Come on, baby, save me
Love me, betray me
I'm crazy, you break me
Ain't that every song that you love, you love, you love, you love?
