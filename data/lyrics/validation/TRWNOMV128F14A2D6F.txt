It's been close to a year since we spoke last
You haven't changed
And now you're talking into my right ear
What happened when you ran off
With that friend of yours
Or was she useful?

Tossing around bah ra koontzae
Vroom vroom then be silent
... I sit around bah ra koontzae
Vroom vroom then be silent
Tossing around bah ra koontzae
Vroom vroom then be silent
... I sit around bah ra koontzae
Vroom vroom then be silent

Bet on your life you can't
Remember when the clouds
Sang out that soft chant
The one you thought you had
And the one you thought was yours
Now you've come to a door, to adore...

Tossing around bah ra koontzae
Vroom vroom then be silent
... I sit around bah ra koontzae
Vroom vroom then be silent
Tossing around bah ra koontzae
Vroom vroom then be silent
... I sit around bah ra koontzae
Vroom vroom then be silent

Panic under pressure cooker
Thoughts lead me dying sooner
Rough mouth fits makes you calm
You thought all the while
You were smarter

By the way...
Be sure to write
The last thing
Makes it alright

Tossing around bah ra koontzae
Vroom vroom then be silent
... I sit around bah ra koontzae
Vroom vroom then be silent
Tossing around bah ra koontzae
Vroom vroom then be silent
... I sit around bah ra koontzae
Vroom vroom then be silent

Panic under pressure cooker
Thoughts lead me dying sooner
Rough mouth fits makes you calm
You thought all the while
You were smarter

Panic under pressure cooker
Thoughts lead me dying sooner
Rough mouth fits makes you calm
You thought all the while
You were smarter
