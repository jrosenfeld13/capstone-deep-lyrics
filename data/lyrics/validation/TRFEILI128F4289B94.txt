Call up, the station
Intimidation
No need to go on
Make some plans for everyone

Dress up
You don't fit
This suits me perfect
Take a photograph
Leave a dying image

Wait for the train, that may never arrive
Place yourself in the middle and push me aside
You'd better hold on, 'cause this is your last ride

Deny it
You've never won
Do you ever wonder why?

Deny it
You've never won
Do you ever wonder why?

It's going to hit you, when you least expect it
It's been happening so long
I guess we knew it all along

Reach for your limits
I don't think we'll make it
If it were up to you, then none of us would be around

Starve for a good day
At home it would last
You can save me a window for questions you ask
After all we've been through, it doesn't matter

Deny it
You've never won
Do you ever wonder why?

Deny it
You've never won
Do you ever wonder why?

Deny it
You've never won
Do you ever wonder why?

Deny it
You've never won
Do you ever wonder why?

Look at yourself
You've never belonged
But you never bothered to blend
This latest fashion has brought us apart
You did your time, now GO!

Deny it
You've never won
Do you ever wonder why?

Deny it
You've never won
Do you ever wonder why?

Deny it
You've never won
Do you ever wonder why?

Deny it
You've never won
Do you ever wonder why?
