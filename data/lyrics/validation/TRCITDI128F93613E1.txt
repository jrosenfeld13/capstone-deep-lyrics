Woke up dreaming
I was gonna die
Woke up dreaming
I was gonna die
Cause my baby said her
Said her last goodbyes

Reached out for her
And she was not there
Reached out for her
And she was not there
Lord I miss her body
And her long brown hair

Heart rate fallin' - river flood
Black cat bawlin' - moon drippin' blood
Woke up dreamin', I was gonna die
All my sins abound me
It's my turn to cry
Yeah...

Devil's risin'
You don't have a chance
Devil's risin'
You don't have a chance
Where there's fiddles playin'
Shake your bones and dance

I just want to
Live another day
I just want to
Live another day
See that brown-haired woman
Comin' back this way
Oh Yeah...
