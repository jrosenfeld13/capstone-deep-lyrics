I Promise revenge for everyone!
And no more elections
Vengeance will be the forefront of our platform
And no more nominations!
Eyes and teeth will fill the streets
And you and me we'll be able to sleep
Everyone
These are trouble days
"We need a leader who will help us
Make them pay"
Times have never been so strange
"We need a man who will feed our rage!"
Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, you are all guilty
My client, police warrant, state prosecution
What the hell have you done?
Two or three wrongs ought to make a right
Vengeance to all and to all a good night
Of Sleep!
Everyone
