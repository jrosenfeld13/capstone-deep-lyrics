[Verse 1]
Now she brags about her law degree
We used to chat about the lottery
Don't you know she used to present those novelty checks?
And we can't talk about her history
She won't shut up about her ministry

[Pre-Chorus]
She's so demure, so insecure so
Mums the word about philosophy
She sits in bed with a dictionary
Unprepared for the judiciary
She's not a product of the monastery

[Chorus]
She's covered in flaws
She's not the supreme girl that I thought she was
She's not the supreme girl that I thought she was

[Verse 2]

It's a northern Texas fantasy
A fighting chance to join the monarchy
As a girl she used to lament
The lack of girls in government
She's so demure so insecure

[Chorus]
But she's covered in flaws
She's not the supreme girl that I thought she was
She's not the supreme girl that I thought she was
She's not the supreme girl that I thought she was

[Pre-Chorus]
Mums the word about philosophy
She sits in bed with a dictionary
Unprepared for the judiciary
She's not a product of the monastery

[Bridge]
And now I find out she's in love with me
She wants to know me better personally
She won't shut up about her ministry
We used to chat about the lottery

[Chorus]
But she's covered in flaws
She's not the supreme girl that I thought she was
She's not the supreme girl that I thought she was
She's not the supreme girl that I thought she was
She's not the supreme girl that I thought she was

[Outro]
She's not the supreme girl
She's not the supreme girl
She's not the supreme girl
She's not the supreme girl
