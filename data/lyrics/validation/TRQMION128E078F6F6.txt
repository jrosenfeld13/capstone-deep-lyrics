[Spoken Intro]
Hello? Who's calling?
It's JoJo, honey
It's Dalvin, baby
It's K-Ci, sugar
Devante, sexyhuh, and you know I'm...

Lonely (whoa) without you (Baby, baby, baby)
Take you back now
Crazy! (Oh, my phone...)

(Devante & K-Ci talkin')

[Verse 1: K-Ci]
Yesterday it was pouring for straight two months now
How did we do it? I just don't know how
Life's a real big drag without you
You have to feel the same 'cause our love was so true
Your friends told me that you kept up with me
I don't understand why we both can't see
Why is it this way when we knew it could be
If we both just stop and listen to me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: K-Ci + (Jodeci)]
All alone I sit at home, baby
(Waiting for the phone to ring)
All I know is that I miss you, baby
(This loneliness is driving me crazy)
My phone

[Chorus: Jodeci + (K-Ci)]
My phone doesn't ring anymore
No hands knocking at my door (Knocking at my door)
Lonely days are here again (I know they are)
I know you feel the same, girlfriend
(Listen, baby...)

[Verse 2: K-Ci]
Who was that guy I saw you walking with?
In your smile I knew you wasn't with it
Let's stop this pride and find our love again
It won't take no time for our hearts to mend

[Pre-Chorus: K-Ci + (Jodeci)]
All alone I sit at home, baby
(Waiting for the phone to ring)
You know, you know, you know, you know
All I know is that I miss you, baby
(This loneliness is driving me crazy)
My phone, baby

[Chorus: Jodeci + (K-Ci)]
My phone doesn't ring anymore
(My phone don't ring anymore, baby)
No hands knocking at my door (Knocking at my door)
Lonely days are here again (I know they are)
I know you feel the same, girlfriend
(My phone)
My phone doesn't ring anymore
(My phone don't ring anymore, baby)
No hands knocking at my door
(No hands knocking at my door)
Lonely days are here again (Oh oh oh...)
I know you feel the same, girlfriend
(Check it out, girlfriend...)

[Bridge: K-Ci + (Jodeci)]
I wanna tell you why (I'm lonely)
I'm so lonely (without you)
Don't know what I'm about do, oh girl
I guess I'll just (take you), take you (back now)
Driving me crazy, baby (Crazy)
Loneliness is driving me (crazy)
Loneliness is driving me (crazy)
I don't know what to tell you (Crazy)
My... (Crazy) My...

[Chorus: Jodeci + (K-Ci)]
My phone doesn't ring anymore
(My phone ... ring anymore, baby)
No hands knocking at my door (You don't come around like you used to)
Lonely days are here again (My lonely days are back)
I know you feel the same, girlfriend

[Bridge: K-Ci + (Jodeci)]
(My phone) You don't come around (My phone)
You don't call me no more, baby
(This loneliness is driving me crazy)
(Crazy)

[Chorus: Jodeci + (K-Ci)]
My phone doesn't ring anymore
(Ring anymore, yeah)
No hands knocking at my door (Knocking, knocking at my door, baby)
Lonely days are here again (My lonely days...)
I know you feel the same, girlfriend
My phone doesn't ring anymore
(I don't know what I'm gonna do, baby)
No hands knocking at my door (I just can't take it no more, baby)
Lonely days are here again (My my my...)
I know you feel the same, girlfriend

[Outro: K-Ci + (Jodeci)]
What am I to do? What am I to do? (This loneliness...)
I just can't take it, I just can't take it
(This loneliness is driving me crazy)
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah (My phone)
(This loneliness...this loneliness...)
I don't wanna stop loving you, no no, baby
(This loneliness is driving me crazy)
(My phone doesn't ring anymore)
Ring anymore, baby
