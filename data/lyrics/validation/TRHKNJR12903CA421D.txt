You stole a kiss and stole my heart
Made me a fool right from the start
It wouldnt have been so bad except
This little plan, it fell apart

If I were you
Id dare not speak
Id run like hell
In hopes of seein tomorrow

Its such a travesty
The way you say our love should be
Yeah, such a tragedy
Think you can just break my heart and leave me
Well you better run
Oh, man on the run
Playin for fun
Wind me up
Leave me undone

Its such a travesty
The way you say our love should be
Yeah, such a tragedy
Think you can just break my heart and leave me
Well you better run
Oh, man on the run
Playin for fun
Wind me up
Leave me undone

These lips are sealed, Ill never speak
Your name in loving memory
So dont you try to make ammends
Thats what ya get for playin mean

If I were you
Id dare not speak
Id run like hell
In hopes of seein tomorrow

Ahhhh, break my heart and leave me
Man on the run

Its such a travesty
The way you say our love should be
Yeah, such a tragedy
Think you can just break my heart and leave me
Well you better run
Oh, man on the run
Playin for fun
Wind me up
Leave me undone
