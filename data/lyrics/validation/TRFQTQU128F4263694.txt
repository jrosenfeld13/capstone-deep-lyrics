Beautiful feather hovering overground
We're similar
We're both being pushed by the wind
Through the air
To wherever
Haven't I seen you before?
Haven't you been here before?
As we both sit here together
Whatever
As the wind blows...

It's so supernatural, It's so supernatural
Let it fly

Wonderful words lying in the grass
We're similar
We're both getting cut off again
Together
Whatever
As we both sway...

It's so supernatural, It's so supernatural
Let it fly

We must stop meeting this way
We've both been living o.k
'Cuz we fell so far from this tree again

And the sun is my best friend
And the earth opened up to me
We've been seperate for so long
So long...

It's so supernatural
Now everything's beautiful

We fell far from this tree
For so long
We crawled out of this stream
For so long
What's become of you?
What's become of me?
It's ok, It's ok
It's part of everything

It's natural
It's part of everything
