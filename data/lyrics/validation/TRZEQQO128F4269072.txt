Emergency emergency, heat is on and burning me
Superstitions in my mind, over and over losing time
Sometimes you feel so far away, somtime it gets so hard to say
Don't stop the fight, don't die now don't stop the fight don't die now
The pressures keep on rising, every night a crazy dream
I've been hurting, no one knows through it all the pain still grows
Sometimes you feel so far away, sometimes it gets so hard to say
Don't stop the fight don't die now don't stop the fight don't die now
He was a rotten boy he never liked being kicked around [no good]
He was afoolish boy dont ask me why
But he could steal your heart away
Sometimes you feel so far away sometimes it gets so hard to say
Don't stop the fight don't die now don't stop the fight don't die now
