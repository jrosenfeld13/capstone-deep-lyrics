We fell victims to your lies once before
Wise to da game
We fall victims to your lies no more
Wise to da game
From the drugs to the beatdowns
To the talks behind each others backs
To the labels that divide our scene
Talk about unity how come you don't look
Time to rise above the ignorance cause I'm wise to da game
And I refuse to take part cause I'm wise to da game
Time to rise above the ignorance gain knowledge judge for yourself
Put the jealousy aside and start helpnig each other out
Cause I seen it rise and I seen it all fall
Time to move ahead
And learn from the mistakes that we made before
