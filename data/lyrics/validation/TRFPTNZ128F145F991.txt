Arriving in at work behind
Speed up the assembly line
Don't force units together
Follow the instruction sign
This isn't happening a fourth time
Work the parts responsibly
Piece them biologically
Release them incomplete
Barely will they think or breath
This isn't happening a fifth time
This blood is flowing through a warped mind

[Chorus]
See what's inside all the things you will find
Can you see yourself doing that?
When you're out on the move seeking something to prove
Can you see yourself doing that?
You were in their design
Just thrown into a mind
And the world becomes a path
Homicidal divide
Manufacturer's pride
In the wake of aftermath

Compatible reality
Forming separate entities
Dead heads and holy water
We instill the wants and needs
Work with the team to meet the deadline
Modern man cannot survive
Drowning in formaldehyde
Inhuman creation station
That's where we control your lives
And it's been happening since the dawn of time
This blood's still flowing through a warped mind

[Chorus]
See what's inside all the things you will find
Can you see yourself doing that?
When you're out on the move seeking something to prove
Can you see yourself doing that?
You were in their design
Just thrown into a mind
And the world becomes a path
Homicidal divide
Manufacturer's pride
In the wake of aftermath
