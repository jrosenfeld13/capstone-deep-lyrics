Oh well, I'm tired and so weary but I must go along
Till the Lord will come and call, call me away, oh yes
Well, the morning's bright and the lamb is the light
And the night, night is as black as the sea, oh yes
There will be peace in the valley for me, someday
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, oh my Lord and no trouble, I'll see
There will be peace in the valley for me
Oh well, the bear will be gentle and the wolf will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh yes
And the beast from the wild will be laid by a child
And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, oh yes
There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, oh my Lord and no trouble, I'll see
There'll be peace in the valley for me
