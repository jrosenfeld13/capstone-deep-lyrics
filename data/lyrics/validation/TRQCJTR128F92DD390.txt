Open your eyes, look to the skies when you're lonely
There will be stars shining for you
Sleepers awake, it's getting late, snow is falling
The whole wide world is wombling too

All day long, we will be wombling in the snow
We wish you a wombling Merry Christmas
All day long, we will be laughing as we go
We wish you a Merry wombling Christmas

Under the ground there is the sound of a symphony
The lights are low, the fire is bright
Wombling through, I'll tune in to you, you tune in to me
We'll send a message into the night

All day long, we will be wombling in the snow
We wish you a Wombling Merry Christmas
All day long, we will be laughing as we go
We wish you a Merry Wombling Christmas
