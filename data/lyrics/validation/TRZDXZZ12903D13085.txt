I dream of the day when we find, we find ourselves
And we are both together, we are both together
Speaking your truth, you have lost me, lost me
In a place that is so tender, it is so tender
Your hand is back where it belongs
On my hip, on my hip
Your voice is sweet and it's singing me a song
Your hand is back where it belongs
On my hip, on my hip
Your voice is sweet and it's singing me a song
Your touch makes me blind, now, I don't want to see
Not now, no, no, not ever, oh no, no, not ever
Smiling this way and I wonder could it be forever
Wonder could it be, could it be forever
Could it be forever?
Your hand is back where it belongs
On my hip, on my hip
Your voice is sweet and it's singing me a song
Your hand is back where it belongs
On my hip, on my hip
Your voice is sweet and it's singing me a song
Could it be forever?
I dream of the day when we find, we find ourselves
And we are both together
Your hand is back where it belongs
On my hip, on my hip
Your voice is sweet and it's singing me a song
Your hand is back where it belongs
On my hip, on my hip
Your voice is sweet and it's singing me a song
Could it be forever?
Could it be forever?
Could it be forever?
