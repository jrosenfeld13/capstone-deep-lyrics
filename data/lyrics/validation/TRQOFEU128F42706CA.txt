Take your hands off of him, he don't belong to you
Hands off of him, he don't belong to you
He's mine, all mine, no matter what you do

He's long and lean and lanky, sweet as he can be
Hands off of him, he belongs to me
Hands off of him, he don't belong to you
He's mine, all mine, no matter what you do

Treats me kind and gentle, makes me feel so good
Loves me every morning like a good man should
Hands off of him, he don't belong to you
He's mine, all mine, no matter what you do

People stare and wonder what his loving's like
Hands off of him 'less you want a big fight
Hands off of him, he don't belong to you
He's mine, all mine, no matter what you do

Well, he'll be mine until the day I die
Now you've heard my story and you know the reason why
Hands off of him, he don't belong to you
He's mine, all mine, no matter what you do
He's mine, all mine, no matter what you do
He's mine, all mine, no matter what you do, what you do
He's mine, all mine, no matter what you do
