Came in from the city
Walked into the door
I turned around when I heard
The sound of footsteps on the floor

Love just like addiction
Now I'm hooked on you
I need some time to get it right
Your love's gonna see me through

Can't stop now
Don't you know?
I ain't never gonna let you go
Don't go

Oh, baby
Make your mind up
Give me what you got
Fix me with your loving
Shut the door
And turn the lock
Hey, go get the doctor
Doctor came too late

Another night
I feel all right
My love for you can't wait

Can't stop now
Don't you know?
I ain't never gonna let you go
Don't go

Came in from the city
Walked into the door
I turned around when I heard
The sound of footsteps on the floor
Said he was a killer

Now I know it's true
I'm dead when you walk out the door
Hey, babe
I'm hooked on you

Can't stop now
Don't you know?
I ain't never gonna let you go
Don't go

Can't stop now
Don't you know?
I ain't never gonna let you go
Don't go

Can't stop now
Don't you know?
I ain't never gonna let you go
Don't go

Can't stop now
Don't you know?
I ain't never gonna let you go
Don't go

Can't stop now
Don't you know?
I ain't never gonna let you go
Don't go

Can't stop now
Don't you know?
I ain't never gonna let you go
Don't go

Can't stop now
Don't you know?
I ain't never gonna let you go
Don't go

Can't stop now
Don't you know?
I ain't never gonna let you go
Don't go

Don't go
Don't go
Don't go
Don't go
