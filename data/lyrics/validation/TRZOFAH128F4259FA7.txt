The clocks are broken
And my hair is changing colour now
And nothing ever changes on the Great Western
But you'll have me believe
There's no water in the river
But the box kicks and the swallow dives
Always makes me feel alive
And when the rain falls down
It feels like a holiday
A holiday
And as we cross the bridge
We should stay
We should stay
Twenty years of leaving
And you never knew the reasons
Two hundered miles of sleepers
Taking you nearer
To decide what you love
And what you don't hate
And follow the new bypass to from
Where you came
And when the rain falls down
It feels like a holiday
A holiday
And as we cross the bridge
We should stay
We should stay
