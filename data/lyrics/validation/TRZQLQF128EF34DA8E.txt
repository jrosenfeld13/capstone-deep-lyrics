Can you admit to yourself?
Can you confess to me when in doubt?
Turn to nobody else
Don't turn the argument inside out

'Cause you are perfect
Accused and so strung out
So strung out

Can you [Incomprehensible] yourself?
Just look long and hard
You're looking sickly pale
Do you consider yourself?

'Cause you ain't perfect
And I knew this from the start
If I knew there was something
I never would've let you go
I never would've let you go
Let you go, let you go

'Cause you ain't perfect
And I knew this from the start
If I knew there was something
I never would've let you go

'Cause you ain't perfect
And I knew this from the start
If I knew there was something
I never would've let you go
