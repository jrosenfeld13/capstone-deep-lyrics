My sister come look quickly
I can't believe my eyes
All through this burning city
The naked spirits fly

Say hello, say goodbye and walk on by

Could it be war is over?
No tear comes to my eye
Inside this shell of building
We'll wait through one more night

Say hello, say goodbye and walk on by

This life is sad and tender
Your tear reflects this night
Tomorrow we will venture
Out in the morning light

And walk the streets again
And face the peoples' smiles
And try and find the secrets
Lost in the concrete piles

Say hello, say goodbye and walk on by
Walk on by, walk on by
