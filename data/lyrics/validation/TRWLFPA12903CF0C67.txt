Don't step into my cipher unless you can decipher
Who's the hyper Buddha session budpiper
Talking out the side of your neck
Bleed me kill my dreams
As I turn the dial in self-denial
Will they check out the fake smile
Program direct scan A to Z
Same ole yeah!
No adventure to save the venture ouch
Who's the pimp trying to turn me out!!

Who's lifted?
Who's really gifted?
Is it who you know or what you know??

Mentally melting down hear the sound of the same old sound going round
Mentally melting down hear the sound of the same old sound going round
Mentally melting down hear the sound of the same old sound going round
Mentally melting down hear the sound of the same old sound going round
Mentally melting down hear the sound of the same old sound going round

Ears still burning
Tounges steady turning mad
Scheming suckers double-teaming
Like Harlem Heat I reached for the tag switched up
Now who's coming in last?
Excedrin number sucker D. J. play play blah blah
All day no way I'll play
