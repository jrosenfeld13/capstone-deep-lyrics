The time is near for the great tribulation
All lost souls should be aware of this
For it is written in the Christian Bible
Of the Four Horseman of the Apocalypse

The word of John in the Book of Revelations
Tells of a Christ who could be a counterfeit
Speaks of a whore upon a scarlet beast
And the Four Horseman of the Apocalypse

Black and red, white and pale
Death and war, famine and pestilence
The end will begin with the sound of approaching hoof beats
Of the Four Horseman of the Apocalypse

It is foretold, the moon will turn to blood
And the sun to ashen darkness
The dead will awaken, a second coming will follow
The Four Horseman of the Apocalypse

Black and red, white and pale
Death and war, famine and pestilence
The end will begin with the sound of approaching hoof beats
Of the Four Horseman of the Apocalypse
The end will begin with the sound of approaching hoof beats
Of the Four Horseman of the Apocalypse
