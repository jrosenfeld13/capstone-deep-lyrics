You spinned a long time, come on but I feel it, (?) to the ground
I got a live, I got a night, I got a bread (?)
That you like, that you like, that you like 'cause you're nothing good
But you're not depend at all, that's why I'm so confused
And (?), see the hurt down me
I came beside on the broken soul, my mind, so best we let go vision
That you like, that you like, that you like 'cause you're nothing good
But you're not depend at all, that's why I'm so confused

You're not weeders, you want leaders, you want leaders in
You're not weeders, you want leaders, you want leaders in

I said "Let in conversations", my mind is racing, we live in peaces
I lose my vision, it's not a trick now if we are lying on and push the (?) in
You lose (?) and don't want to chase in
Give me the seconds 'cause I don't want to pretend

You're not weeders, you want leaders, you want leaders in
You're not weeders, you want leaders, you want leaders in
You're not weeders, you want leaders, you want leaders in
You're not weeders, you want leaders, you want leaders in
