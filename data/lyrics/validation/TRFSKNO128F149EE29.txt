You shine the light Melissa
You really took it all yourself
You sang a lot of love songs, and wrote some
You knew it all so well

You lead the way Melissa
You're going to ride the chariot
Everybody cheers and cries some
We'll keep on standing up

Now that the one you love is gone
You are the girl to carry on
Now that you've taken off your cross
Love is not lost
Love is not lost

You've seen it all Melissa
You're going to wear Elijah's clothes
You give yourself completely
You walk salvation's road

You shine the light Melissa
You really took it all yourself
You sang a lot of love songs, and wrote some
You knew it all so well

You lead the way Melissa
You're going to ride the chariot
Everybody cheers and cries some
We'll keep on standing up

If you believe in love
If you believe in love
Love is not lost
