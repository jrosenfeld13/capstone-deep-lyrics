I was a workshop owner in the gulch for the people
And I offered myself to the world
I was a workshop owner
I was a workshop owner

I was a diesel fixer, fixed a diesel
Diesel fixed me, what a weasel
And baby was a workshop owner
Baby was a workshop owner

Baby and me were ripe for the pickin'
Well, that was the day we ran into Albert Flasher

It was a cold, snowy, rainy afternoon
And we were sittin' there in high school, my school
And Michael was a moonbeam maker
Michael was a moonbeam maker

I was a diesel fixer, fixed a diesel
Diesel fixed me, what a weasel, oh no
Baby was a workshop owner
Baby was a workshop owner

Baby and me were ripe for the pickin'
Well, that was the day we ran into Albert Flasher, ah!

I was a workshop owner in the gulch for the people
And I offered myself to the world
I was a workshop owner
I was a workshop owner
I was a workshop owner
