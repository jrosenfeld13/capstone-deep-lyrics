You know, the sun is in your eyes
And hurricanes and rains
And black and cloudy skies

You're running up and down that hill
You turn it on and off at will
There's nothing here to thrill
Or bring you down
And if you've got no other choice
You know you can follow my voice
Through the dark turns and noise
Of this wicked little town

Oh Lady, luck has led you here
And they're so twisted up
They'll twist you up. I fear

The pious, hateful and devout
You're turning tricks till you're turned out
The wind so cold it burns
You're burning out
And blowing round

And if you've got no other choice
You know you can follow my voice
Through the dark turns and noise
Of this wicked little town

The fates are vicious
And they're cruel
You learn too late you've used two wishes like a fool

And then you're someone you are not
And Junction City ain't the spot
Remember Mrs. Lot
And when she turned around

And if you've got no other choice
You know you can follow my voice
Through the dark turns and noise
Of this wicked little town. (2x)
