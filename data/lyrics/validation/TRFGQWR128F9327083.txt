[Spoken Intro]
Male voice: I don't think it's a problem cuz
Most of the girls ask for it

Kathleen: Uh huh, how do they ask for it?

Male Voice: The way they act, the way they
I...I can't say they way they dress because
That's their own personal choice
But some of these dumb hoes
Slut rocker bitches walking down the street
They're asking for it, they may deny it but it's true

[Verse 1]
Lay me spread eagle out on your hill, yeah
Then write a book on how I wanted to die
It's hard to talk with your dick in my mouth
I will try to scream in pain a little nicer next time

[Chorus]
White boy
Don't laugh
Don't cry
Just die

[Verse 2]
I'm so sorry if I'm alienating some of you
Your whole fucking culture alienates me
I can not scream from pain down here on my knees
I'm so sorry that I think!

[Chorus]
White boy
Don't laugh
Don't cry
Just die
