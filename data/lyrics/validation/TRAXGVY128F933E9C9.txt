Let's say you're livin in the inner city
You're angry young and male
They say you got a pretty good chance
My brother of winding up in jail
Incarcreation understand ia a lucrative industry
Whole towns are living on it
The 21st century slavery
Somewhere is there a solution
If there is we've got to find it
And get our heads and hearts behind it
But right now I don't know what to do
That's why I'm feeling blue

You see a lot of guys so frustrated
They just want to kick somebody's ass
It's not just a racial thing these days oh yeah
Privilege and class
Education's a factor you can't afford to ignore
It's still the best way my brother
To even up the score
