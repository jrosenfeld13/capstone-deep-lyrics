Autumn blew its leaves at me
Threatenin' winter as I walked
Summer always goes so quick
Barely stopping like my thoughts
Which dip and spin and change so fast
I have to wonder, oh, will I last, yeah
Through the windows of the train
I caught reflections of a paper cup
Hanging small in a pale blue sky
Never knowing which way's up
Above the clouds, what's to be found
I have to wonder, will I be around, yeah
As my anger shouts at my own self doubt
So a sadness creeps into my dreams
When you're scared of living but afraid to die
I get scared of giving
And I must find the faith to beat it, yeah
Must be me that's rushing by
Time just lingers on the wind
Bristlin' through my open fears
I wonder what it's going to bring
Above the clouds, what's to be found
I have to wonder, oh, will I be around, whoa
Run and hide, run and hide
I catch the sail at evenin' tide
Run and hide, run and hide
I catch the sail at evenin' tide
Run and hide, run and hide
I catch the sail at evenin' tide
