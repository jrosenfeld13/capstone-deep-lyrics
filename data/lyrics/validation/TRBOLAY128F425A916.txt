[Verse 1]
Got the sun in the morning
I got the moon at night
I got your arms around me, everything's alright
Holding you tight is how I'd like to spend the
The rest of my life
Feel the warm breeze blowing
Down through the trees
I've got your love beside me, child, that's all I need
My heart and soul is wide open to you
Nobody but you, sweet baby
No one but you, yeah

[Chorus]
Got to know that I want you, baby
Got to know that I need you, darling
I just want to say you're my everything
Like in all the songs I sing
Of happiness and joy you bring
I just want to say you're my everything

[Verse 2]
Just want to hold you
How I adore you
You've got that special touch that I long for oh so much
Oh, I'm amazed at how you right all that's wrong in my world
All I am and I hope to be
Is 'cause of you and what you do
You bring out the best in me
My heart and soul is wide open, darling
Nobody but you, sweet baby
No one but you
Yeah you

[Chorus]
Got to know that I want you, baby
Got to know that I need you, darling
I just want to say you're my everything
Like in all the songs I sing
Of happiness and joy you bring
I just want to say you're my everything

[Bridge]
Baby baby baby, oh yeah, yes
Child, you possess all that a true love should be
'Cause I'm forever loving you, you keep loving me
Yeah, oh me, baby

[Chorus]
Got to know that I want you, baby
Got to know that I need you, darling
I just want to say you're my everything
Like in all the songs I sing
Of happiness and joy you bring
I just want to say you're my everything

Got to know that I want you, baby
Got to know that I need you, darling
I just want to say you're my everything
Like in all the songs I sing
Of happiness and joy you bring
I just want to say you're my everything

Got to know that I want you, baby
Got to know that I need you, darling
I just want to say you're my everything
Like in all the songs I sing
Of happiness and joy you bring
I just want to say you're my everything

Got to know that I want you, baby
Got to know that I need you, darling
I just want to say you're my everything
Like in all the songs I sing
Of happiness and joy you bring
I just want to say you're my everything...
