Well, if you wanna keep me movin'
Then take my heart
I got a one way ticket
Don't you know
If you're too gone to rock
To get to where you're goin'
Start into my station
Baby, look what...
Wake up, take it up
In your hands
And switch it over to my band
I got somethin'...
...anythin' you need
So dial k.d.lang
On your trucker's CB

Hey now, baby
Turn off the news
You're drivin' me crazy
Hey now, baby, please

Tune into my wave
Tune into my wave

Hey, Listen to me, baby
Listen to me
Got a rock my baby boogie
And an alligator shoe
I got one foot, two foot
Sugarfoot rags
Turn on to my station
Baby, don't be a drag
Listen to me, baby
It's understood
I got while...
In cowboy boots
Groovin' to my daddy
On my daddy radio
Can you dig it like I dig it
Can you dig it at all

Well, you got everything you need
Don't touch that dial
Stakin', I'm not fakin'
Till you dig it a while
I know I'm right
I just can't be wrong
Need a little help
To make you come undone
So relax
Loosen your noose
Tune in or tune out
To get into the groove
Can you dig it like I dig it
Can you dig it with me
When the rockabilly move it
You might break up the scene
