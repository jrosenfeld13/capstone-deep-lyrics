I want to climb the mountain of dreams
But I'm just lying here on the ground
I can't move and I can't see
And can't here a fucking sound
Come to me you said
There's something beyond reality
A journey into darkness
To fight against humanity

Mirror, what do you see
Glory, fortune or insanity?
Death, means just rebirth
To the fiery kingdom under the earth
I was never like them
I could never obey their insane lord
Please let me enter
Mark me with the holy sword

Pure hate

Going into nowhere
You're asking me to follow
I really don't know
Where I'll be tomorrow
