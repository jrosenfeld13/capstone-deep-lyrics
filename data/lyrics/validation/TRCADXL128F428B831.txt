A picnic on a sunny afternoon
I'm feeling lighter than a red balloon, well it's
Hard to believe it, but I can perceive that
Love is winding up, and it'll hit me soon

We take the trail down to the rocky beach
Sewage plant is well within our nasal reach, well
We just ignore it. We've got no time for it
The sun is really looking like a big old peach

I see the future come, and I don't wanna be
One of the ones that ends up without
Somebody good, somebody good like you
Like you

We find a spot and put the blanket down
Rocks are kinda bumpy, but we sure don't frown
It feels just like velvet, and I can just tell that
A whole new way of seeing is a-comin' round

Unpack the fixin's and we start to eat
Sunlight is a-playin' with our sandy feet, well
We're making small patter, but none of that matters
'Cause now we're just transmitting an unspoken truth

I see the future come, and I don't wanna be
One of the ones that ends up without
Somebody good, somebody good like you
Like you

We find a spot and put the blanket down
The rocks are kinda bumpy, but we sure don't frown
It feels just like velvet, and I can just tell that
A whole new way of seeing is a-comin' round

Unpack the fixin's and we start to eat
Sunlight is a-playin' with our sandy feet, well
We're making small patter, but none of that matters
'Cause now we're just transmitting an unspoken truth

I see the future come, and I don't wanna be
One of the ones that ends up without
Somebody good, somebody good like you
Like you
