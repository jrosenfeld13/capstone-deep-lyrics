He is falling down the starcase
He don't know just how to stop
He's forty flights from bottom
And sixty from the top

He's a man on a mission
As brave as he seem
A lonely life's ambition
Got sieve for a brain

You won't miss your water
Till' your well runs dry
You can't taste the truth
When you're drinking a lie

It's a long hard road
But we've gotta make it through
So tell me, tell me
What in the world are we gonna do?

So don't dig yourself any deeper
The only color that I see is red
My life would be so much sweeter
Well, I'm standing on the top of your head

And when you reach the bottom
When you hit my killing floor
I'll be there to greet you
And show you to the door

It's a bright sunny day
Not a cloud in the sky
So say your prayers one last time
Cuz' today's the day you will die

So don't dig yourself any deeper
The only color that I see is red
My life would be so much sweeter
Well, I'm standing on the top of your head

You should be better off dead
My life would be so much sweeter
Standing on the top of your head
You are a sinner, don't let me down
No, I'll never forget, you put me down
You could run like a cheater, I'd still got you
You can tell me to, do anything you wanna do
