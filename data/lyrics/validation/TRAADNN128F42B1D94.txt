Waking up to the morning through my fishbowl
And I worry is she sleeping?
Is she breathing? Is she dead?

And would I be a better mother to a kitty
Or a puppy, or chimpanzees
Or maybe to your baby

Lord willing...

If I'm alive this time tomorrow
Then I'll have more time to kill
And maybe we could rearrange my furniture
To make lots more room to fill

You and I, we lay like fireflies
Retired from those summer nights
All bottled up as victims of our child's play

And when we laugh the walls are muted by our existence
Should I be a bit more persistent when I was you to stay over?

If you're willing
You are the only one that matters
And the only one who knows
Every inch of my perimeter
From my fingers to my toes

And I don't know where we'll be tomorrow
But I have one guarantee
For these arms once held malignancy
You know that I'm willing

I'm willing I'm willing
I'm willing to take you home
I'm willing, I'm willing
I'm willing to follow you home
I'm willing, I'm willing
I'm willing to take you home
I'm willing, I'm willing
I'm willing to call you home
