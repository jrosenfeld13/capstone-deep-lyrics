This looks like my day
To myself I'd often say
The winds of change are here
Don't give up don't have any fear
Cos you know you've got it

Don't ever let them get you down
Don't ever let them push you around
(You've got to)
Stand up and fight and be counted
(You've got to)
Stand up and fight and be counted
