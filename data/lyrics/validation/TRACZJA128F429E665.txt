I feel I'm falling apart 'cos I know
I've lost my guardian angel 
A fleeting glimpse of your heart
Losing right from the start 
No return
And things will never be the same!

Tried to find the words that show I sympathise
Words of comfort, words that never critisize!
Though I know you're simply laughing at me
I just can't stop and simply let it be!

Where are all those feelings, all my yesterdays
Feelings, now I have bring back those bitter ways 
Though I know you wanna turn and blow
I just can't stop and simply let you go!

I feel I'm falling apart 'cos I know
I've lost my guardian angel 
A fleeting glimpse of your heart
Losing right from the start 
No return
And things will never be the same!

Let me see you smile once more that special way
Warm as summer on a chilly winter's day 
Though I know you're simply laughing at me
I just can't stop and simply let it be!

I feel I'm falling apart 'cos I know
I've lost my guardian angel 
A fleeting glimpse of your heart
Losing right from the start 
No return
(There's no return)
And things will never be the same!

I feel I'm falling apart 'cos I know
I've lost my guardian angel 
(Guardian angel)
A fleeting glimpse of your heart
Losing right from the start 
No return
And things will never be the same!
(And things will never be the same!)
