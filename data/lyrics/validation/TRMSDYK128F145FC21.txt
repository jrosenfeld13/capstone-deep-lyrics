Nothing left to lose
Except you and your baby blues
Microphone
Check this rhyme
Pancho Villa was a friend of mine
I get fucked up, holla back ya'll
And i kick it like Jackie Chan
With my kung fu style
I'll get rid of you in a while (yeah)
Hey, Hey, Hey..all the bitches in the back

C'mon C'mon, get up get up (whoa)
I know you know it's never forever
C'mon C'mon, get up get up (whoa)
You wanna hear i'm sorry? whatever!
Now that you're gone
I'm moving on
You wrecked it all
There's nothing left to lose except for you

I got my teenage kicks
Pulling down boards like Rodman
All the lipstick chicks, sing
Na, na, na, na, na, na
I get fucked up (holla back ya'll)
And i rock it like Jackson Browne
Let me tell you right now (what?!)
I like strippers better anyhow
Hey, Hey, Hey..all the bitches in the back

C'mon C'mon, get up get up (whoa)
I know you know it's never forever
C'mon C'mon, get up get up (whoa)
You wanna hear i'm sorry? whatever!
Now that you're gone
I'm moving on
You wrecked it all
There's nothing left to lose except for you
