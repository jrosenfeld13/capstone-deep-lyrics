Blackness all around
(Can you wake me)
Truthless little town
(Can you wake me)
Flying in your streets
(Can you wake me)
Drowning in your sleep
(Can you wake me)

From another dreamless night
Long before we arise

Howling in your field
(Can you wake me)
Unconquered and unreal
(Can you wake me)
I'm crawling deep inside
(Can you wake me)
Drifting with the tide
(Can you wake me)

From another dreamless night
Long before we arise
Long before we arise
