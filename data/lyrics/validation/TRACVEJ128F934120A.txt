Once again
There's a feeling inside of me
Nothing new
I've felt it before
Like the voice of hunger
Inside of me crying out
There's got to be more

I'll put my faith
In the arms of an open road
And you can come along
If you choose

'Cause there's places
That I've never been to
Sunsets to be ridden into
Not a lot I can do
But give in to the drifter
There's a drifter in me

Though I've tried it
I'm just not a settler
And nine to five
Don't make it with me
Why deny it
It makes me feel better
To come alive
And prove that I'm free

I wear no chains
And I carry no heavy load
So much to gain
And nothing to lose

'Cause there's places
That I've never been to
Sunsets to be ridden into
Not a lot I can do
But give in to the drifter
There's a drifter in me
