I know we have been here before
Countless times engaged in an empty embrace
Your every word the touch of satin
Everything you do is a cold blade in my ribs
Leaving me breathless
Suffocating my thoughts

And I am helpless to your beauty
My eyes and woulds are still weeping
Let it dry up so I can fly again

Biting my tongue in hopes that words of weakness don't escape
Counting the days, counting the moments to dream of you again

Waiting, always waiting
Waiting, always waiting
Waiting, always waiting
Waiting, always waiting
Waiting, always waiting
Waiting, always waiting
Waiting, always waiting
