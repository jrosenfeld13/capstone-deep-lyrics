Well they took me to the hospital
And I swore I would't go
My blood was running much to high
My heart was much to slow
The doctor had some questions, somethings he had to know
My baby shook her head and said, the boy's got no control

Well I wasn't born in trouble
It's my adopted middle name
When you're running with the devil
Ya got noone else to blame

He says Im ok
He might say I'm all right
But, I lose control everywhere
It keeps me up all night

No control
I got no control
You bet I know
No no no
I got no control
Ahhh na na na no control

She always makes me feel so good
I gotta make things right
I'm watching all the boys tip her
And I dont wanna fight
But I got a temper
That's one thing she knows
And if there's some trouble I lose my control

I got no control
I got no control
Ahh no no no
No no no
I got no control
Said no control

I ain't go no, no, no con trol

(whisper) no control

Ahh no no no no no
I got no control
I got no control
Ahh no no no
I got no control
No control

Ah ah ah
Oh oh oh
No control
Ahh no no no no
Ahh no no no no
No control

I met ya where ya wanna see
And baby baby Im crazy
I wanna tell ya now
I got no control now

No no no no
No no no no
No control
