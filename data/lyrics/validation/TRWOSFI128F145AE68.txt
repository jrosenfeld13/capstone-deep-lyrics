It's all out on the streets today but you, you've found a place to hide
Too busy with the ratrace, you pass by on the other side
Yours is the face of the brand new Britain with blinkers on your eyes
Find yourself position and cling on for dear life
You're so frightened, everybody's so frightened
The papers tell of rape and murder, everything that you want to hear
Bad tidings on the radio - you find a way to name your fear
So you never pick up hitchhikers, never talk to strangers
Believe the world outside your bolted door is evil
You're so frightened, everybody's so frightened

You are just a victim of your own bad dreams
While people are the same as we've always been
But through the blindness in your eyes
For just one minute I see them shine
Love me . . won't you love me? But they all turn away

You never fight for anything, you always turn your face away
And you never get involved in trouble let all evil have it's way
So as the girl screams in the street below, you turn up the television
Perhaps you'll see it on the news - well it's nothing to do with you
You're too frightened, everybody's so frightened
Why is everybody so frightened?
