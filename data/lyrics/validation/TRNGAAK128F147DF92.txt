[Verse 1]
Did I drive you away?
I know what you'll say
You say, "Oh, sing one you know"
But I promise you this
I'll always look out for you
Yeah, that's what I'll do

[Chorus]
I say, oh
I say, oh

[Verse 2]
My heart is yours
It's you that I hold on to
Yeah, that's what I do
And I know I was wrong
But I won't let you down
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I will, yes I will

[Chorus]
I said, oh
I cry, oh

[Bridge]
Yeah, I saw sparks
Yeah, I saw sparks
And I saw sparks
Yeah, I saw sparks
Sing it out

[Outro]
La, la, la, la, oh
La, la, la, la, oh
La, la, la, la, oh
La, la, la, la, oh
