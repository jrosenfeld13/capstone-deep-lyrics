Fanfare, I'm bringing the news
Time sticks like a bottle of glue
Lots of trouble is traveling through
Will you come tonight?
New home, looks like a dream
Bite in you like a fresh tangerine
It's narcotic, a little bit mean
No pleasure is denied
Suicide soul
Tip toe in the valley of doom
Inhale the rock 'n' roll fumes
Like a bee without a zoom
Wandering through the mist
Heaven's there for all to see
Eternity for a minute or three
Oh, I just forgot what to be
So tell me what it is
Suicide soul
When she comes down, the lights all fade
And so do we into a state ever after
It's time to revel and celebrate
What brings and keeps us here
Give it up for the wall and the nerve
Take it down for the cause they serve
Around the bush and around the curve
I'm crawling back to you
I can't stop 'cause it never began
My mind keeps on repeating this twang
Like a song that somebody sang
Now sing me something new
Suicide soul
When she comes down, the lights all fade
And so do we into a state ever after
It's time to revel and celebrate
What brings and keeps us here
When she comes down, we duplicate
Our mirrored gazes lazy from laughter
It's time to revel and celebrate
What brings and keeps us here
