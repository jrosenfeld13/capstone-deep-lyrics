Just when I thought I was safe
You found me in my hiding place
I promised never again
I wouldn't give my heart but then
Closer, closer I moved near you
The way I want you makes me fear you

Loves breaks and love divides
Love laughs and love can make you cry
I can't believe the ways
That love can give and love can take away

I find it hard to explain
It's crazy, but it's happening
And I'm falling again
Much further than I've ever been
I'm falling deeper than the ocean
I am lost in this emotion

Loves breaks and love divides
Love laughs and love can make you cry
I can't believe the way
That love can give and love can take away...
