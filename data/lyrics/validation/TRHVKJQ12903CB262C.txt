The king rounded up all the insurgents
Listened closely to their gibberish
For some sign of an omen or portent
All night  all week
Soon he had collected all of their wisdom
Into a book he titled so
A Guide To The Worlds Most Fantastic Monsters
And I read it searching for some new feeling but
The monster that you run from doesnt exist
