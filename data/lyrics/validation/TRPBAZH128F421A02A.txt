What's this fierce new change?
Has your juggernaut reached my door?
Am I out of range?
Think another thought before
Babies are ground up in the last big round-up

Ease your head, play it cool in a patio chair
Try to design a postcard from your mind

Piggy bank, ooooo-whee
If it's Heaven-sent you'll go far
Listen well to me
Smoke that seven cent cigar
Can that rumba and Avogadro's Number

Ease your head, play it cool in a patio chair
Try to design a postcard from your mind

Polaroid galore
Snap my jelly roll, count your change
For your midnight chore
Play that "sell-your-soul" exchange
Menthol filter tip danglin' from your nether lip

Ease your head, play it cool in a patio chair
Try to design a postcard from your mind

If John Doe writes another book
With words that just won't quit
Why must I forge through it?
Let George do it
