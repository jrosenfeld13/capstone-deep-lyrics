Your due date is up
Don't make comments on irrelevant subjects
There is a man who seeks his own happiness
And his smile is warmer than five of yours
You keep singing to a tasteless song
He whistles to a song of hope
A night of foolish chatter is easily replaced by a couple bold statements
Few words are gold, and living is offensive in itself
Your shallow ideals are about as useless as the gnats in my eyes
Wake up
Put your heart where your mouth is
