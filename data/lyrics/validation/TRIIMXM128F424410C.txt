Took some pain
'cause nothing good is free
I love you
And it feels like you love me
You always fit the other half of me
So be my crutch, be my plane, be my tree

Girl, i miss you when you're gone
Makes no difference for how long
So come back soon
I'm in my room

Took some time
Nothing good is fast
Broke the skin
If i could i could i'd take that back
You always stay, even when i run away
You're my sunshine, you're my prayer, not my prey

Girl, i miss you when you're gone
Makes no difference for how long
So come back soon
I'm in my room, room
(in my) room
Where are you?
