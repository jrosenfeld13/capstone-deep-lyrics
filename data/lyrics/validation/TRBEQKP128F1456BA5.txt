I'm breakin' out all over, (breakin out all over)
I'm scratchin' from head to toe
Ever since you left me, girl
I just can't take no more

Pills don't help me like they should
Naw Naw Baby (naw naw, baby)
And every doctor I see, they tell me
Can't give me no good

There's no cure, naw, baby
For what you gave to me
Oh, you're the only one
Who can save me

I've got a prayer place for only you
I've got to get you there
I'm aching and shaking all over
And breaking out in a rash, Oh, baby

I'm breakin' out all over, (breakin out all over)
I'm scratchin' from head to toe
I feel like I'm on the run
And there's no place to go

Magic - you can keep it
I't ain't what I need
Naw naw naw naw baby (Naw, Naw, Naw, baby)
I'ts gonna take a mirecle, girl, before I'm free

I didn't feel the bite
But I Know I've been bit
Scratchin' day and night
I'm about to have a fit, Oh!

(Baby)
I'm breakin' out all over, (breakin out all over)
I'm scratchin' from head to toe
Ever since you left me, girl
I just can't take no more

Pills don't help me like they should
Naw Naw Baby (naw naw, baby)
And every, every, every, every doctor I see, they tell me they
Can't give me no good (Naw baby, Naw)

You've got what I need
C'mon home (C'mon Home)
Just c'mon home

I'm breaking out all over
I'm breaking out all over
I'm breaking out all over
I'm breaking out all over
I'm breaking out all over
