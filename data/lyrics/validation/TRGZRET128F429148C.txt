I won't always do the right thing
When I'm alone I'm good company
God damn, I'm one handsome man
You're a star, I know you quite like me
You make me hard but baby you're not me
Nobody will love me more than I do
I'm in love with myself
I'm in love with myself
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I love myself
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I love myself
I won't never disappoint me
When I'm alone looking in the mirror
God oh my, that's one pretty sight
You're a charm, but not enough of me
When I'm alone, no one ever disagrees
Nobody will love me more than I do
I'm in love with myself
I'm in love with myself
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I love myself
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I love myself
I love myself
Whatever you say, whatever you say, whatever
Whatever you say, whatever you say, whatever
Whatever you say, whatever you say, whatever
Whatever you say, whatever you say, whatever
I'm in love with myself
I'm in love with myself
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I love myself
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I love myself
I love myself
I love myself
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I love myself
Oh yeah, oh yeah
