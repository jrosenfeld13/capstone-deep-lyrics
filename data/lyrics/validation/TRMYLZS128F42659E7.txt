Your whispers in my ear, your words are never clear
Your goodbyes make me cry but time will dry my eyes
Loneliness is a silent scream when no one's there
You crashed into my dream, the silence leads you there

The last sound love makes is the sound of a heartbreak
The last sound love makes is the sound of a heartbreak

Who teaches you to feel but never how to heal
Truth turning into lies, forever just a night
Loneliness is a silent scream when no one's there
You crashed into my dream, the silence leads you there

The last sound love makes is the sound of a heartbreak
The last sound love makes is the sound of a heartbreak
The last sound love makes is the sound of a heartbreak
The last sound love makes is the sound of a heartbreak

The last sound love makes is the sound of a heartbreak
The last sound love makes is the sound of a heartbreak
The last sound love makes is the sound of a heartbreak
The last sound love makes is the sound of a heartbreak
The last sound love makes is the sound of a heartbreak
