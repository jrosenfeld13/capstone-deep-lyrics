Come follow me down to a tiny land
Things to see, friends to meet; you would understand
Darlin' get up, let us pack up
For the journey it's a nonstop
It's a date
Sweetheart don't be late
Come, let me go, let me go to Tobago
That paradise, found by Robinson Crusoe
And it is said, it's the land of tomorrow
Princess Margaret say, come Tobago for holiday
Now the whole world say, come Tobago for holiday
Your native friend surely would be a host
And show you some of the beauties from coast to coast
As you look down curiously at the gray sand and the blue sea
You'll agree, it's just heavenly
For rare beauty, well, it's my belief
There is no other place like the Buccoo Reef
Where the fishes seems to gather
Just to welcome every stranger
It is grand
On this Crusoe land
