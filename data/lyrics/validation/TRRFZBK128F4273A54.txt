Gather your modalistic interchange ability
It would demandno reliability
Holism; partly modified, partly unified
Seems like you are subtle to the last

Faith and honour, portrayed liike a bench
By which slaughter is proceeded
Insurrectonal by wrench
No more prosperity for you
It took all you ever had

Return my Faustian Spirit of the Earth
Grace completes nature, yet abolishes it
It shows how you're constantly
Being on alert
Ambiguity; like a vernacular pendulum
Back and forth

Redemption; you should never judge
Me and my children
Omissioned by your failures only
Attempting to touch your
Erroneous ideology
For all what I am worth; return my
Faustian Spirit of the Earth
