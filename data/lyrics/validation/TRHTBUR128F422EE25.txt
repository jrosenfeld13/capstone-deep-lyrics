I don't know you to wear a hat
But I came home late and there it sat
You rose to show what hats are for
When living through a civil war
When living through a civil war

Christmas mornings and New Years Days
They flood with dreams and drift away
They cling to logs and cupboard doors
Riding out this civil war
Riding out this civil war

Some fighters came and pitched a tent
And everyone around here, we went
The fix was in, but we bet and we swore
From both sides of a civil war...

We build this up and we knock this down
We call our little mob a town
We nail a sign up above the door
"God bless our little civil war,"
"God bless our little civil war"

Three dogs at a party an a boat at night
Play checkers in a lantern light
They sing a song out to the shore
Of women, gold, and civil war...

Every truth carries blame
And every light reveals some shame
Progress rides with thieves and whores
The stowaways of civil war
The stowaways of civil war
