[Verse 1]
Walking like you're sucking velvet snow
Walking like you're sucking  velvet snow
Start in on your story and go go
Oh walking like sucking  in velvet snow

Going cause you're sweating on our floor
Going cause you're sweating on our floor
Acting like you've never dance no more
Oh going cause you're sweating on our floor

[Chorus]
Then you go and when you go
You get top floor and when you back you go slower
Turn out the lights cause they're coming bright
And then you go

[Verse 2]
Hope that smoke ain't getting to you're face
Hope that smoke ain't getting to you're face
Showing off you're Sunday shaved and lacy
Hope that smoke ain't getting to you're face

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Little Jo she warned me not to call you
Stoked that you were carrying some bad news
Leave it up to me and I'll just drown you
Out into the city that you came from
