It's getting colder every minute in my skull
Your vodka's striking ice on fire
The smoke of my pipe keeps you under the spell
We're both aromatically perfumed
And we're cool that we're so damn fool

We're rolling from the bar to the hotel
Driving slow because the snow can make us crash
Well the car stopped and broke down
So we'll take a rest now
Everything fits perfectly
This is true love
Just as pure as we can make it
Your eyes, your eyes
Keep reminding me
Haunting

It's getting warmer every minute in my skull
Your body's striking mine on fire
The smell of your skin keeps me under the spell
You're so aromatically perfumed
This is true love
Just as pure as we can make it
Your eyes, your eyes
Keep reminding me
Haunting

Changing slowly
Changing slowly

And your words begin to annoy me
We just can't stay next to each other
This is the end, you see
Everything fits perfectly
This is true love
Just as pure as we can make it
Your eyes, your eyes
Keep reminding me
Haunting
