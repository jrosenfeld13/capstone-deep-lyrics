I took a long way home i've been a long time gone
Tired of being here alone at the end
We can't go on like this
It?s tearing us apart
When i get home
We can take from the start
Take me in your arms
Hold me baby
Sometimes i see you alone and a stranger
Take me in your arms
I need you
Love is true, i know cause i've been there
I was a soldier of fortune
She was a girl on the run
How did we ever get this far
Take time to make it and say you wanna know
I?ll be the last one to ever let you go
Take me in your arms
Hold me baby
Sometimes i feel alone and a stranger
Take me in your arms
I need you
Love is true, i know cause i've been there?
