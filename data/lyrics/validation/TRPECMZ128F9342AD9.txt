Think of where you came from
Think about your past
Wouldn't you look ridiculous
Selling out at last
Don't bite more than you can chew
In the search for the perfect you
Don't bite more than you can chew
You gotta be true, you gotta be true
Don't bite more than you can chew
In the search for the perfect you
Don't be drastic, don't be drastic
That could be me
That could be you
No one is immune
Cut some slack before you mock those
Trying to improve
We've all been there too
We always pull through
We've got to learn humility
We won't make the same mistakes
