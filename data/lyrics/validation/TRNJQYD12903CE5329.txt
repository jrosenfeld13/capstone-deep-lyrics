It don't take no melody
To make some music history
You say you wanna rock
And make it to the top
You gotta look good
And you gotta act tough

The wheel of fortune takes a spin
And you keep shouting, "let me in!"
You don't know what to do
I'm givin you a clue
So you can be the next
Supreme Rock Dude

Haircut and an attitude
Haircut and an attitude
Haircut and an attitude

Can you dig this heavy sound?
The sound that brings the ladies round
Five white boys
Bangin on toys
We get paid
For making noise

Haircut and an attitude
Haircut and an attitude
Haircut and an attitude

You say you wanna rock
And make it to the top
You gotta look good
And you gotta act tough
You don't know what to do
I'm givin you a clue
So you can be the next

You don't know what to do
