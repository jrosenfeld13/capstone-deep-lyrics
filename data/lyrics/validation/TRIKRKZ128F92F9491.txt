If you don't like the kooky way I comb my hair for you
And you don't like the look of the crazy pants
I wear for you
OK my darling, I'll change each pitch
I only wanna love you
As you like it

If you don't like the gang that I go around with
On the town
And you don't like the records I play
Because they bring you down
OK my darling, I'll have to quit
I only wanna love you
As you like it

If you're looking for a saint, dear
Betta warn you that you won't get far
I'm a man that's only human
I'm gonna change my ways for you
And love you as you are

'Cause you don't realise
That I'm gonna make a fight for you
Just a look from your eyes
And I'd set the world alight for you
OK my darling, and now the fuse is lit
You know I'm gonna love you
As you like it

If you're looking for a saint, dear
Betta warn you that you won't get far
I'm a man that's only human
I'm gonna change my ways for you
And love you as you are

But you don't realise that I'm gonna make a fight for you
Just a look from your eyes
And I'd set the world alight for you
OK my darling, when the fuse is lit
You know I'm gonna love you
As you like it
As you like it
As you like it
