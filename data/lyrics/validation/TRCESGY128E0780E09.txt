[Intro]
(When love breaks up) Breaks up
(When the dawn light wakes up) Wakes up
A new life is born
Somehow I have to make this final breakthru
Now!

[Verse 1]
I wake up
Feel just fine
Your face
Fills my mind
I get religion quick
Because you're looking divine
Honey you're touching something, you're touching me
I'm under your thumb, under your spell, can't you see?

[Chorus]
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru
Oh yeah

[Post-Chorus]
(Breakthru) These barriers of pain
(Breakthru) Yeah, to the sunshine from the rain
Make my feelings known towards you
Turn my heart inside and out for you now
Somehow I have to make this final (break)thru
(Now!)
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Your smile
Speaks books to me
I break up
With each and every one of your looks at me
Honey, you're starting something deep inside
Honey, you're sparking something, this fire in me
I'm outta control, I want to rush headlong into this ecstasy

[Chorus]
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you (ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh-)
That would really be a (breakthru!)
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru
Oh yeah

[Bridge]
(Breakthru)
(Breakthru)
(Break-)
Hey!

[Chorus]
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you (ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh-)
That would really be a (breakthru!)
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a (breakthru)

[Outro]
(Breakthru)
