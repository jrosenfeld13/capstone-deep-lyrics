The weather's grim though spring is on its way
I heard it said there's going to be a holiday
But I didn't think of that when I saw you
It doesn't mean I'd die for you

Hey King, I hope you have a good weekend
( King Rolo McGinty, that is )
I hope you get things done the way that you intend
Cause you know how things get done
And not everybody does that

I call you
You call me
I ask you
Why ask me
You drive me
Quite crazy
What is this
You tell me

We went through Saturday
And not everybody did that

Hey girl, please don't think me rude
But I owe you some kind of gratitude
I don't know how these things are done
Ooh but I shan't forget you

Cause you made it Saturday
Ooh and I shan't forget you
