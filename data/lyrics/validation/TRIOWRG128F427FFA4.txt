Well alright!
This song goes out to anybody who's ever experienced
That sense of invincibility that you have when your 16 or 17 years old
You've got some buddies loaded up in the automobile, you've got some good tunes on the stereo
And I ain't sayin' it's right but it happens
Maybe you got a few beers goin' along on the ride with you
ACDC is playin' on the cassette player
Look over at your body and you realize that the world is your oyster
And the back window are two thumpin', tri-axle, 6x9 speakers
