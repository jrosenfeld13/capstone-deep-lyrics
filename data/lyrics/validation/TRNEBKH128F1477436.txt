I just can't control
How I feel about you
And I'm so surprised
With the way I act
When you're around
I know they never see
All the things that I see
They don't understand
Just what it is
That we have found

Well I don't care what they say
I've made up my mind anyway
'Cos you've got the love that I need
And I wouldn't change it for anything

There ain't no man
Makes me feel like you do
There ain't no man
Ain't no doubt
There ain't no man
Makes me feel like you do
There ain't no man
That I've ever found

I simply love the times
That we spend together
And I love the things
That you say to me
When we're alone
There isn't any doubt
In the way I'm feeling
And I hope the way
That I'm feeling now
Will never go

Well I don't care what they say
I've made up my mind anyway
'Cos you've got the love that I need
And I wouldn't change it for anything

There ain't no man
Makes me feel like you do
There ain't no man
Ain't no doubt
There ain't no man
Makes me feel like you do
There ain't no man
That I've ever found
