[Verse 1]
Hello Hello out there
How does it go out there?
Little big, little small, little slow out there?
Not me Im feelin great
Its just me and my mates
And we slide around the city like were wearing roller skates (hey)
Catch love from The Bean to the T-Dot
Now we rest in L-O-N-G Beach (BEATCH)
They want the sound that we got
All home made like Italian Fiat
We ought
To be on top of this game
If it werent for the fact that the shit so lame
You biting my style but its not the same
Cause you rap with a band but you got now
I climb higher than an asteroid
You got swift feet but Im moving faster boy
Ive been around the world so their lies dont faze me
Ive seen it all baby I was born in the 80s

[Verse 2]
Im a bad money manager
Poor capital handler
The opposite of rappers you be seeing on the camera
Its Exposition Im the brokest dude you ever met
But still Im smiling cause we got a Black President
And yea Speks wanna remind hes only half-black
Still that half more than we ever had (fact)
And I know were all victims to the NASDAQ
Waiting on someone to come along and fix the bad math
Fuck it though Im living my life regardless
Drinking brew and Bar-B-Que the back yard gets
Filled with smoke from fresh meats and ganja
Then lay with a lady who loves to put it on ya
I climb higher than an asteroid
You got swift feet but Im moving faster boy
Ive been around the world so their lies dont phase me
Ive seen it all baby I was born in the 80s

I climb higher than an asteroid
You got swift feet but Im moving faster boy
Ive been around the world so their lies dont phase me
Ive seen it all baby I was born in the 80s
You know like Reagenomics
Big Hair
Cold War Politics
And Real Hip Hop?
I was there for that
