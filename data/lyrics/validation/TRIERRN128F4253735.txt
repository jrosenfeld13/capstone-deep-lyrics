Take the throne!!

The pain comes quick and impulsive
While and inverted cross, is burned on your back
The blood pulsates when they pierces
The human flesh with an iron barliever!

Die!!!!

Now raise your hands in the air
And with eyes filled of hate
Spit upon the holy crucifix
And scream out in lust

Deicide!!

Slowly life is floating away
And a demon from hell will rise
He is there to lead you
Upon the final path???
(To clear) all the lies, between heaven and hell
You have desecrated many victims
But your mind is still confused..

Why?

Oh let my victims please my only god
I am worthy to be a servant of satan
Come through the gate, (who is the worthy one) hahahah suck on that grammar!!!
"I grant you power, and yes you'll be my son."

The transformation is completed
My soul has entered a demon from hell..
The blood of Christians will be floating
And god will be pushed away from his throne

Fall!!!

Now raise your hands in the air
Your eyes are filled with hate
You spit upon the holy crucifix
And scream out in lust

Deicide!! (That's no scream!!hahaha)

Life slowly are floating away
And a demon from hell arises
He is there to lead you
Upon the final path
