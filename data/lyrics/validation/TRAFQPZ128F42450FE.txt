It's just coincidence
Well you can talk that way, but i have to say
I don't beleive in it
It was the chill of chance, i decided to dance the days away
And i wasn't worried at all
Sneaking through the back door
No, I wasn't worried at all
Dreams are what you live for

Waiting for the light to turn green
Carry me home
To the kindest eyes that i've ever seen
Carry me home
Well can you tell me how will it be now
How will it be
Can you tell me how will it be now
How will it be?

Well we were younger then
And the days were long and slow
But were we wiser then?
I couldn't say, I wouldn't know
But i wasn't worried at all
I had someone to run to
And i wasn't worried at all
I knew which way the wind blew

Counting out the chaos in bloom
Carry me home
And I watched the sinners spin round the room
Carry me home
Well can you tell me how will it be now
How will it be
Can you tell me how will it be now
How will it be?

In a cold world
How will it be?
In the real world
How will it be?
In a lonely world
How will it be?
Will the ghosts just stop
Following me
All now drawn into the sun
He was the only one
In the real world
How will it be?
In a cold cold world
How will it be?
Beck and call
Beg and crawl
How will it be?
Will the ghosts just stop
Following me
All now drawn into the sun
He was the only one

And so, i remember you
I remember the days and the thousands of ways you pulled me through
And dreamed of all the things you've seen
Of all the faces and all of the places you have been
And now you have no phone and you have no name and you have no number
And it comes to the end in the blink of an eye and it makes me wonder
