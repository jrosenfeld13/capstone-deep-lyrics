Who the fuck do you think you are
That you don't owe me an explanation
Who the fuck do you think I am
That I'm not owed some basic respect
I'm a human being just like you
Even your pay cheque can't change that too
Did you ever think about what I would do
I forgot you only think about yourself
Well I'll accept that times get hard
I'll even accept that years of this has jaded you
But I won't accept that it has to be like this
Because lives aren't just buisness
Thing that I can't understand
You know I'm a father you know where I stand
And I worked hard I tried my best
But it seems all that now counts for nothing
I'm a human being just like you
Even your pay cheque can't change that too
Did you ever think about what I would do
I forgot you only think about yourself
