Peel me off the hook
That's something to die for
Heal me, help me see
What the hell did I lie for?
I'm fighting private wars again
Just second thoughts of where and when
So peel me off the hook
That's something to die for

Won't you see it in your heart
You should know you always played your part
Real good, oh yeah
That's something to die for
That's something to die for

Well you know me, I never learn
I'm holding on to sacred words
So peel me off the hook
That's something to die for

Won't you see it in your heart
You should know you always played your part
Real good
If it hurts, who'll be there?
Who'll be standing by the shore?
You will see how the waves
Wash away all the dirt
That's something to die for
That's something to die for

Won't you see it in your heart
Oh, don't you know you played your part
Real good
So won't you see it in your heart
You should
Should've know you always played your part
Real good
In the end I'll be there
I'll be standing by your side
We will see how the tide
Hides away all the dirt
That's something to die for
That's something to die for
