Love comes and goes
Sometimes decades sometimes months
Raise you up to the sky
Make you feel like every little thing is bright inside you
Crashing back down
Make you so sick that you want to drown
No other pain, like losing a soul mate
The roads we take in life often seem to be very strong
Walk them carelessly like were walkin on bricks and stone
Only when we look behind that we will see the road is cracked
Oh, there we must move forward, gently as we tread
Chorus
To carry our guilt sometimes seems the only thing thats easy
Eats away your flesh and bones and all it is you need
My good amigo once said that the truth will set you free
But I guess we have to wait sometimes, wait around and see
Chorus
Now see the sun rising again
Brand new colors, brand new man again
Sweeping up the pieces of the brokenness
Sweeping up the pieces, but the pieces never end
Chorus
No other pain, like losing a soul mate
