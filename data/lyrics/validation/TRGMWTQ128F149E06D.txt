I will open my mind for you
Let me open up my heart for you
Take me anywhere you want me to
Far beyond the sun

I will open my mind for you
Let me open up my heart for you
Take me anywhere you want me to
Far beyond the sun

Many cases of abductions, UFO encounters
Alien investigation and interrogation
Oval-shaped technology, ghost-like freaks surrounding me
Captured by an outworld lifeform, alien abductees
Solarsystem creatures from a distant planet
Far beyond the moon and sun, reaching out for me to come

I will open my mind for you
Let me open up my heart for you
Take me anywhere you want me to
Far beyond the sun

I remember the vibrations, electrical sensations
Dream-like hazy liquid spaced
Cosmic faces, hearing a loud high-pitched noise
Sounding like an outworld voice
Separating from my body, taken to their spaceship
Passing through physical objects in a transformation
Letting out bloodcurdling screams as the fear in me increased

I will open my mind for you
Let me open up my heart for you
Take me anywhere you want me to
Far beyond the sun

I will open my mind for you
Let me open up my heart for you
Take me anywhere you want me to
Far beyond the sun
