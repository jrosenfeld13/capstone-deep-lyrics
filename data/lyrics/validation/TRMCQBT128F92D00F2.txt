I've reached the breaking point, don't stand too close to me
For when my optic nerves observe your curves
Then suddenly I wanna crush you close, I wanna hold you tight
I wanna kiss and tell the world, I fell in love tonight

'Cause I got to have you
Got to get through to you, baby
That you're mine, mine, mine

I have reached the breaking point, the point of no return
It's very clear to see, a fool like me will never ever learn
I have reached the breaking point, I hear the drums of doom
I'm gonna flip my wig in one great big atomic boom

'Cause I got to have you
Got to get through to you, baby
That you're mine, mine, mine

All at once there's this big upheaval
That fills my heart full of dreams
All at once comes the urge primeval
And I come apart at the seams

Oh, here I go again, the same old song and dance
I've had my share of tea and sympathy but no romance
I've reached my breaking point, it's much too late to stop
It's either shoes and rice or lose the dice and blow my top

'Cause I got to have you
Got to get through to you, baby
That you're mine, mine, mine

All at once there's this big upheaval
That fills my heart so full of dreams
All at once comes the urge primeval
And I fall apart at the seams

Oh, here I go again, that same old song and dance
I've had my share of tea and sympathy but no romance
I've reached my breaking point, it's much too late to stop
It's either shoes and rice and lose the dice or blow my top

'Cause I got to have you
Got to get near to you, baby
You're mine, oh, all mine
