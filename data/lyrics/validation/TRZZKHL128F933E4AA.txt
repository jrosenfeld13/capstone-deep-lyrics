Lying still
Movement no more
Until forever more
I thought you didn't remember
Until the sand ran out
Until the sand ran out

You're just a puppet
Suspended in mid-air
Dictated by those
Who pull your beckoning strings

Lying still
Movement no more
Until forever more
I thought you didn't remember
Until the sand ran out
Until the sand ran out

You're just a puppet
Suspended in mid-air
Dictated by those
Who pull your beckoning strings

Puppet
I love you puppet
Pull those beckoning strings
Pull those beckoning strings

Puppet
