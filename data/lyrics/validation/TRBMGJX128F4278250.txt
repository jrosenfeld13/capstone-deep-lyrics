The hill's hard to climb
The road get rough and rugged
Make me wish that I was back in my buggy
But I'll get along, hey, hey, hey, I'll get along

Lovin' you baby made me a poor chooser
You can bet your life this time
I won't be no two time loser
I'll get along, hey, hey, hey, I'll get along, yes will

'Cause if a dog in the street
Can find himself a bone, I'll get along

Well, I'll get along, get along without you baby
Oh, yeah, I'll get along get along without you baby
I'll get along, get along without you baby
I'll get along, get along without you baby

Now, lovin' you baby made me a poor chooser
You can bet your life this time
I won't be no two time loser
I'll get along, hey, hey, hey, I'll get along, yes will

'Cause if a dog in the street
Can find himself a bone, I'll get along

I'll get along, get along without you baby
I'll get along, get along without you baby
I'll get along, get along without you baby
I'll get along, get along without you baby
I'll get along, get along without you baby
I'll get along without you baby
