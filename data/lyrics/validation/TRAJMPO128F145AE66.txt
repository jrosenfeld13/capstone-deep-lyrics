Hey, hey, human gonna do The Strain
I'm gonna grip the seat I'm gonna pull your chain
Barbed-wire bum baby, be like me
We're gonna do the strain on the lavatory

We're gonna e-eeeeeeeeease it out
We're gonna squee-eeeeeeeeeeze it out
So get a grip on your seat. We're gonna get relief somehow

[guitar solo]

Nnnnnggggggh!
Nnnnnggggggh!

[talking]

Every time I settle down and try to read a book
The telephone starts ringing so I leave it off the hook
The Jehovah's Witness come knocking at my door
I try to tell them nicely but they still come back for more
Straining, complaining--No! I'm not complaining
I just got a lot of shit in me - gotta get it out!

Nnnnnggggggh!
Nnnnnggggggh!
