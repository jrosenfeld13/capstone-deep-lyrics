Been thinkin' about you in the sunshine
On a beach and bummin' around
Tho' I've been takin' all my chances
At discos and dances and ev'ry bar in town
And I've been surfin' ev'ry mornin'
At a party ev'ry night
But I've been tryin' to live with out you
And thinkin' about you and girl it just ain't right

Ju-Ju-Ju-Ju-Ju-Ju-Ju-Julie Anne like a fool
I ran away ran ran ran ran away
I'm goin' home today
And I want to stay there beside you
Ju-Ju-Ju-Julie Anne like a fool
I ran away ran ran ran away
But I'm on my knees and I'm beggin' you please

Oh
Please
Please say you'll forgive me Julie

Diggin' a record on the juke box
I nearly makes me want to cry
You always thought it was a cracker
The one by Sedaka 'bout away to say goodbye
I think about you when I'm lonely
I draw your picture in the sand
So many little things remind me
I left you behind me it's hard to understand

Ju-Ju-Ju-Ju-Ju-Ju-Ju-Julie Anne like a fool. ..
