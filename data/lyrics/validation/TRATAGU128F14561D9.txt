The evening's young
The night began
Mmh mmh

Between the bottles
In a mirror
I'm smiling at myself
Look in my eyes
And start to count
The bottles on the shelf
Mmh mmh
Bottles on the shelf

Evening's young
The night began
Barman brings
Another beer
Could ask myself
Why am I here
Between the bottles
In a mirror
You smiling at myself
Look in my eyes
And start to count
The bottles on the shelf
I know I could
At any time
Get up the chair
And leave the place

I know I could
At any time
Get up the chair
And leave the place
I wait for me
And my decision
Between the bottles
That's my face
TV shows
A football game
I leave the place
But all the same
If someone asked me:
"Hey guy you
Where do you go
What do you do?"
I wouldn't know
What I could say
