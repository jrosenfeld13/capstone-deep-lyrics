I wanna tell you but I know you know
Sometimes the things you want are never quite enough
If I had my choice I'd choose you everytime

But, girl, your wishes, they won't make you my new girl
So fall in luck do I deserve you?
Maybe not, but I just can't let go
When you hold me, girl, oooh, I must surrender
'Cause a love like your is so sweet and strong
Baby, I've got to have it all

Let's take it nice and slow
(All day and all night) Can we get up on the feeling girl?
Oho

(I want your love) I want you, ya know?

First it started with a simple kiss
Your hand in mine, no we didn't waste no time
Like Ice in Water, we were made for each other yeah
Are you thirsty now, shall we wait a while?

Now I'm feeling like a child at play
Just close your eyes, baby, let me lead the way
I got my love light on and it's shining for you, girl
I can't do without you, what I'm gone do to, do to, to you, c'mon

(All day and all night) Suga, we don't wanna rush it now
Let's take it nice and slow
(All day and all night) Can we get up on the feeling girl?
Oho

Suga, we don't wanna rush it now
Let's take it nice and slow

Tell me, baby, what's on your mind
Is it love, are you sure? (For sure)
