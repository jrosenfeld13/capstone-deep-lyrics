Dreadful life, time to die
Visions of Black ends my life
Retribution I am saved
Without form I shall be evil

Departure from the mortals
As my life ends
Departure from the mortals
But I will remain

May my lust be fulfilled
Reach the land of no return
In the forest of the dead
My evil soul will dwell

Departure from the mortals
As my life ends
Departure from the mortals
But I will remain
