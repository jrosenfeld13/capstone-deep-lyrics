[Live at Tipitina's]

This song is called One Night of Sin

One night of sin
Is all I'm now paying for
The things I did that I saw
Would make a wave stand still

Don't call my name
It makes me feel so ashamed
I lost my sweet helping hand
I've got myself to blame

Always lived a very quiet life
Never did me no wrong
Now I know that living with you
Been too lonely too long

Don't call my name
It makes me feel so ashamed
I lost my sweet helping hand
I've got myself to blame

Oh I lived a very quiet life
Never did me no wrong
Now I know that living with you
Been too lonely too long

Don't call my name
It makes me feel so ashamed
I've lost my sweet helping hand
I've got myself to blame yeah
Whoooo-oooooh-oooh

Thank you Tipitina's
See you again next time
Thank you
