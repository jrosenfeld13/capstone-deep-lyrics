[Verse 1]
Hold back the rain
Yes we're miles away from nowhere
And the wind doesn't have a name
So call it what you want to call it
Still blows down the lane
People tell me I haven't changed at all
But I don't feel the same
And I've bet you've had that feeling too
You can't laugh all the time

[Chorus]
And if the fires burn out there's only fire to blame
(hold back the rain)
No time for worry cause we're on the roam again
(hold back the rain)
The clouds all scatter and we ride the outside lane
(hold back the rain)
Not on your own so help me please hold back the rain

[Verse 2]
So what if the words ain't rhyming
Did you thing that it's just a game
I probably didn't even say that right
And I really don't give a damn
Okay go off and wander
I'm guilty just the same
Sometimes you're needed badly
So please come back again

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Hold back the rain, hold back the rain. hold back the rain
Hold back the rain (hold back the rain), hold back the rain
(Hold back the rain), hold back the rain (hold back the rain)
Hold back the rain (hold back the rain), hold back the rain
