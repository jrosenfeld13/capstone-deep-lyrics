[Verse 1]
Don't point your finger baby
This isn't the best time for you to test me
"This wasn't just anyone here" she said
If it wasn't you, it's someone you would lie for
Tell me, who would you lie for?

[Chorus]
Let's live the lie
I'm still singing "Whoa"
Don't say you won't let it go
Cause you'll never know
(You'll never know)
I'm still singing "Whoa"
Don't say you won't let it go
Cause you'll never know

[Verse 2]
Don't be so quick to blame a friend
When the smoke is cleared, there'll be nobody left
"Don't be so sure of yourself" he said
If this was me, he would never know your name
(Never know your name)
Heart means everything

[Chorus]
Let's live the lie
I'm still singing "Whoa"
Don't say you won't let it go
Cause you'll never know
(You'll never know)
I'm still singing "Whoa"
Don't say you won't let it go
Cause you'll never know

[Refrain]
I'm alright with being a thief
I'm alright with being a thief

[Verse 3]
From the top of the world
We'll let them know
That your biggest fear is letting go
From the top of the world
We'll let them know
That your biggest fear is letting go

[Chorus]
I'm still singing "Whoa"
Don't say you won't let it go
Cause you'll never know
(You'll never know)
I'm still singing "Whoa"
Don't say you won't let it go
Cause you'll never know
