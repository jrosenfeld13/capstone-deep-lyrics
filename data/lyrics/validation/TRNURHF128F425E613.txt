Love is the sweetest amnesty
Floats like a cloud between the sky and sea
I'll give it to you
Could you please give it to me
Now we can talk, now we can see
If we disagree we do it honestly
Let our lovin' be
The sweetest amnesty
Love is the sweetest amnesty
Given by the power that let us be
I'll give it to you
Could you please give it to me
'Cause I need you
Now we can talk, now we can see
If we disagree we do it honestly
Let our lovin' be
The sweetest amnesty
Between you and me
There's bound to be love and rejection
Our spirits dressed in mystery
Speak slowly through affection
Love is the sweetest amnesty
Floats like a cloud between the sky and sea
I'll give it to you
Could you please give it to me
We can talk, we can see
If we disagree we do it honestly
Let our lovin' be
The sweetest amnesty

Let our lovin' be
The sweetest amnesty
