Put on that smile, it's time to face another day
Tell everybody everything's o.k
How much longer can you play this game?
Tell me how much more can you take?
I see the broken heart you try so hard to hide
I see the tears you hold back in your eyes
I sing the song that you might realize
You're not alone and I'll be there

Like the sun that continues to shine
Just beyond all the clouds in the sky
And if ever I seem to be so far away
Remember my love remains

I see the fear and doubt that paralyzes you
Could live your dreams but you never follow through
Open the door, I'll come in if you want me to
You're not alone, and I'll be there

Like the sun that continues to shine
Just beyond all the clouds in the sky
And if ever I seem to be so far away
Remember my love remains
Our love remains

Before there were mountains, seas or any stars above
You were loved
Know that when all of these cease to be
What will remain is you and me
Forever, ever and ever
You're not alone and I'll be there

Like the sun that continues to shine
Just beyond all the clouds in the sky
And if trouble comes into your life
And even your best friends leave your side
And you can't find the strength to fight
Well please keep this one thing in mind
And whenever it feels like I'm so far away
Remember my love remains
Never get by without your love
Whenever you need me, just call my name
My love remains
