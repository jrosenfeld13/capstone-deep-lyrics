She looked at me her eyes were watering
Then I knew that this was about to end
Frozen in that moment, time was standing still
I could feel my heart, sinking fragile
Good bye, She said
I went and found somebody new
And I gave you every waking moment
I gave you everything you wanted
And now, I know your giving me up
She walked away and I could hardly breathe
Turn around and fell down to my knees
Shivering as the truth is settling
Her tomorrow has nothing to do with me
I knew someday
You'd find someone else's lips
But before you go, will you just
Leave me one last kiss
And I gave you every waking moment
I gave you everything you wanted
And now, I know your giving me up
And I can't lie still
When there's someone else beside you
And I can't lie still
Cause I'm all alone this time
I'm all a lone this time
I remember when you were falling
And I was there just holding onto you
And I remember all those
Scars I wear that you carved in me
And I gave you every waking moment
I gave you everything you wanted
And now, I know your giving me up
And I can't lie still
When theres someone else beside you
And I can't lie still
Cos I'm all alone this time
Cos I'm all alone this time
I'm all alone this time
