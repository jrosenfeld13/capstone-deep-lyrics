I've got a long black six passenger limousine
A palace in Dallas a club in New Orleans
Diamonds on my fingers silk imported clothes
And I can tell a fast train by the way she blows
So don't give me no plastic saddle lemme feel that leather when I ride
Don't give me no paint and powder honey lemme see the hide
False eyelashes and a false foundation may help to build your pride
But don't give me no plastic saddle lemme feel that leather when I ride

Well I'm the cream of societies a man about town
Never looked for nothing that I ain't found
Some say I ain't right but they can't prove I'm wrong
I know the words to the tune before you sang your song
So don't give me no plastic saddle...
Don't give me no plastic saddle lemme feel that leather when I ride
Don't give me no plastic saddle lemme feel that leather when I ride
