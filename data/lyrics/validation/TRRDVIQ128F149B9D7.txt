We see them every day
Movin' up and down
Holding their bibles in their hands yeah
Going to church every Sunday
Telling people they' re Christians yeah
Ye man, we read in the Bible
And overstand
It' s telling us of all the false prophets
When the Messiah' s
Gonna come down here
Dem a gonna say these words
Jesus I wanna be like you

Chorus:
False prophets lies and elution

A dem a go around
Lamping da creation yeah
I and I no like da Babylon style
I and I no like da Babylon style
'Causa dem a go around lampin' Jah creation
Dem a go around telling dem lies
Jesus I wanna be like you

Chorus:
False prophets lies and elution
