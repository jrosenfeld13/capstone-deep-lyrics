Took me long enough to find you
Took me long enough to get you there
Sometimes I feel like the sunshine lost
And I look for the crumbs you toss

Took me long enough to get past your eyes
Took me long enough to tranquilize
When you'd be laughing inside the storm
I can still feel your mouth so warm

You'll be back when you need someone
You'll pretend it was just for fun

Well, I'm so wound up on you
I'm so wound up on you
I'm so wound up on you
And I'm easy when you need me
Easy when you need me

Took me long enough to get over
Took me long enough to figure out
You never meant to stay around
You never meant to be losing ground

Here she comes with that tip-toe walk
And she's ready just to have a talk

I'm so wound up on you
I'm so wound up on you
I'm so wound up on you
And I'm easy when you need me
Easy when you need me

You'll be back when you need someone
You'll pretend it was just for fun

I'm so wound up on you
I'm so wound up on you
I'm so wound up on you
And I'm easy when you need me
Easy when you need me

I'm so wound up on you
I'm so wound up on you
I'm so wound up on you
And I'm easy when you need me
Easy when you need me

I'm so wound up on you
I'm so wound up on you
I'm so wound up on you
And I'm easy when you need me
Easy when you need me
