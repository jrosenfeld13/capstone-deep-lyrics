Don't I get this over ya?
Ooh it gets all over ya
In interview rooms (interview rooms)
Now wishing I could pass it again
To say anything to please the man
In interview rooms (interview rooms)

I'm counting the questions
At night, hit my thoughts
Proposing my answer

Preparing myself for a fall
Preparing myself for a fall
Preparing myself for a fall

Short and tight, it's deprecable
I've seen lights on ghost of means
At interview rooms (interview rooms)
How many lives you devastate, uh?
There, you could leave your genetic make up
At interview rooms (interview rooms)

I'm counting the questions
At night, hit my thoughts
Proposing my answer

Preparing myself for a fall
Preparing myself for a fall
Preparing myself for a fall

I haven't got the shirt
To do that kind of work
With chalks upon the walls
Ooh I take lines rise and fall

Interview rooms
In, out of interview rooms
Interview rooms
In, out of interview rooms
Interview rooms
In, out of interview rooms
Interview rooms
In and out of interview rooms!

I'm counting
The questions
I'm counting the questions
At night, hit my thoughts
Proposing my answer

Preparing myself for a fall
Preparing myself for a fall
Preparing myself for a fall

I haven't got the shirt
To do that kind of work
With chalks upon the walls
Ooh I take lines rise and fall

I haven't got the shirt
To do that kind of work
With chalks upon the walls
Ooh I take lines rise and fall
Ooh I take lines rise and fall
Ooh I take lines rise and fall!
