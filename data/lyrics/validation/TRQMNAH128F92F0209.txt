All the faces that we've learnt to love
And all the tears we cried when we opened up

I been working, dreaming, wanting something more
And i'm thinking; all this shit i'm doing, what's it for?

I'm waiting for the day to arrive

To us all, it's happening
Hanging on to anything

All the voices, can you hear them when they're shouting out?
Maybe some day we will find out what it's all about

All the fighting, the hurting, the bleeding, the crying
What's it for?
All the people living, breathing, dying
Wanting more...

Hanging on to life, you can see it in our eyes
Oh, and I declare there's no where to hide

All the faces that we've learnt to love
And all the tears we cried when we opened up
I'm waiting for the day to arrive
