[Verse 1]
You and I fall together
You and I sleep alone
After all, things might be better
After one, and there's one that's long gone
For the moon, you keep shootin'
Throw your rope up in the air
For the kids, you stay together
You nap 'em and you slap 'em in a highchair

[Chorus]
All you ever wanted was someone to take care of ya
All you're ever losin' is a little mascara
Little mascara
Little mascara

[Verse 2]
Afternoon, things are quiet
Settle back now if you can
Stations clip by like a rocket
Don't you worry if you wonder why he ran

[Chorus]
All you ever wanted was someone to take care of ya
All you're ever losin' is a little mascara
Little mascara
Little mascara

[Bridge]
That you cry, cry
That you cry
Your eyes out
That you cry
That you cry
That you cry
Your eyes out

[Chorus]
All you ever wanted was someone Ma'd be scared of
All you're ever losin' is a little mascara
Little mascara
Little mascara

[Outro]
That you cry
That you cry
That you cry
Your eyes out
That you cry
That you cry
That you cry
Your eyes out
That you cry
That you cry
That you cry
