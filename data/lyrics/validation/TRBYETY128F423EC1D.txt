Ooh yeah, yeah-yeah

Gunfire ricochet off my halo
My head is buzzin' like a hive of bees
The truth is certain, I gotta start livin'
I've been down for all to see, yeah
All my dreams creepin' up on me
The whole world is my destiny
Sweet lord, set us all free
Only one future I see, yeah

Full tilt
I'm finally hit, yeah-yeah
Full tilt
Ooh, I'm in love with that shit, baby

Oh, we've been down with our heads in the sand
Complaining that there's nothing to do
Now people listen, I'm sick of excuses
That dull confusion baby, finally through
All that time pushin' hard on me
Freak society, my destiny
Sweet lord, set us all free
Only one future I see, yeah

Full tilt
I'm finally hit, yeah
Full tilt
Ooh, I'm in love with that shit, yeah

Full tilt, finally hit
Baby, that's how I feel
Full tilt, gonna make you sweat
That's the only deal

Full tilt, now I'm free
Baby ignite my soul
Full tilt, I'm in love with that shit
Baby that's rock n' roll, yeah

Super fat funky

Gunfire ricocheted off my halo
My head is buzzin' like a hive of bees, yeah
You gotta start livin'
We gotta start livin', livin'
Do it
