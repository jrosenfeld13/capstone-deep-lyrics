So tired of listenin' to the politicians
You can't believe what you see in the news
Lawyers try with motions and revisions
To spin a tale and tip the scales of truth
I work hard to make an honest livin'
Do my best in everything I do
Whether it's nine to five, football, cars, or fishin'
Or comin' home to hug and kiss on you

No lies or alibis
It's all so clear when I look in your eyes
Like an arrow shot bull's eye straight and true
Like the Mississippi flows into the bayou

CHORUS:
(That's the truth)
I'm coming home to see you baby
You're the one thing that I know for sure
In a world that's going crazy
You're a matter of survival
My heart and soul revival
Swear on a stack of Bibles
Cross my heart and I will
Be here for you, and that's the truth

When I'm lost in the chaos and confusion
You're the light that leads me to the shore
I tell you girl in a world full of illusions
You're the ray of truth that I've been lookin' for

Now I'm late on the interstate
Radio on at the end of the day
Got the pedal to the metal, got the top rolled down
I wanna scream and shout about the love we've found

CHORUS

Like an arrow shot bull's eye straight and true
Like the Mississippi flows into the bayou

CHORUS 2x

(That's the truth)
