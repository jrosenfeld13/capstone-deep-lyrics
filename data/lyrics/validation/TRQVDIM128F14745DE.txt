[Verse 1]
Give me a word, give me a sign
Show me where to look, tell me what will I find?
What will I find?
Lay me on the ground, fly me in the sky
Show me where to look, tell me what will I find?
What will I find?

[Hook]
Oh, Heaven let your light shine down
Oh, Heaven let your light shine down
Oh, Heaven let your light shine down
Oh, Heaven let your light shine down

[Verse 2]
Love is in the water, love is in the air
Show me where to look, tell me will love be there?
Will love be there?
Teach me how to speak, teach me how to share
Teach me where to go, tell me will love be there?
Will love be there?

[Hook]
Oh, Heaven let your light shine down
Oh, Heaven let your light shine down
Oh, Heaven let your light shine down
Oh, Heaven let your light shine down

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
Give me a word, give me a sign
Show me where to look, tell me what will I find?
What will I find?
Lay me on the ground, fly me in the sky
Show me where to look, tell me what will I find?
What will I find?

[Hook]
Oh, Heaven let your light shine down
Oh, Heaven let your light shine down
Oh, Heaven let your light shine down
Oh, Heaven let your light shine down

[Outro]
I'm gonna let it shine, I'm gonna let it shine
Heaven send a light, let it shine on me
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Heaven send a light, let it shine on me
(It's gonna shine on) Shine on me
(It's gonna shine on) Well come on and shine
