One day you'll find
I never changed my mind
Just went away
With things I didn?t say

I'd seen the tides
Driftin' by
Beyond the scenes
The distant tambourines, the sky

While I stood
Waiting there to leave

But why am I
Still waiting here to leave?

And though you stayed behind
I never changed my mind
I never changed my mind
I never changed my mind
