[Verse 1]
I saw a savior, a savior come my way
I thought I'd see it at the cold light of day
But now, I realize that I'm only for me

[Chorus]
If only I could see
You turn myself to me
And recognize the poison in my heart
There is no other place
No one else I face
The remedy to agree
With how I feel

[Verse 2]
Here in my reflecting, what more can I say?
For I am guilty for the voice that I obey
Too scared to sacrifice a choice chosen for me

[Chorus]
If only I could see
You turn myself to me
And recognize the poison in my heart
There is no other place
No one else I face
The remedy to agree
With how I feel
