When you give half of you
I want all of you
When you give half of you
I want all of you

When you go back window
You see shadows
When you're shopping for me
'Cause when you give half of you
I want all of you

Sadness is a gentle mind
But a good women has her hands to use
Empty package of chips will tell you
What can be sold market and what can belongs to you
When you give
When you give half of you
I want all of you
