Everybody's a genius
And everyone's insane
Sugarplums and razor blades
Dancing in our brains

I've been gunning for sunshine
I want my piece of the sky
I think I'm going viral, baby
And I couldn't even tell you why

I'm a rock star, I'm a thriller
I'm a time bomb, I'm a killer
I've been a million people, yeah, it's true

I'm an actress, I'm a liar
I'm a sinner in the choir
Yeah, everything I am is killing you

Tell me how I could love you
And hurt you like I do?
I kiss you like a politician
I'm never gonna follow through

I get so lost inside myself
Like a tourist in Amsterdam
I'd love to introduce myself
But I don't know who I am

I'm a rock star, I'm a thriller
I'm a time bomb, I'm a killer
I've been a million people, yeah, it's true

I'm an actress, I'm a liar
I'm a sinner in the choir
Yeah, everything I am is killing you

It's time for me to face the ugly truth
The only good thing in my heart is you

[Incomprehensible]
I'm a killer, I'm a killer
I'm a killer, I'm a killer

I'm a rock star, I'm a thriller
I'm a time bomb, I'm a killer
I've been a million people, yeah, it's true

I'm an actress, I'm a liar
I'm a sinner in the choir
Yeah, everything I am is killing you
You, you, you

I'm a killer, I'm a killer
I'm a killer, I'm a killer
