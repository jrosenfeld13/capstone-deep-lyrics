She's gonna hand you a red-headed Gabriel
Coming from the bar in a plastic tie
He's gonna swing from the tree of life
He's gonna try to sell you on a great big lie

But when you speak to her, her eyes light up
The music spills right into your cup
The minstrels play and the waitress brings ice
There are pies on a carousel, have a slice
But watch out, she ain't no good for you

He's gonna spin like the tractor pull
She'll sit back when he tells his tale
He's gonna yell when he drinks his beer
She'll sit back and drink ginger ale

But when you speak to her, her eyes light up
The music spills right into your cup
It's so abrupt and it's so concise
There are pies on a carousel, have a slice
But watch out, she ain't no good for you, I say
Watch out, she ain't no good for you

She'd like to put you in her zoo
Right between the canaries and the cockatoos
She'll pull out your feathers for her brand new hat
And when she's done that, she'll feed you to her cat
So watch out, she ain't no good for you
Watch out, she ain't no good for you
Watch out, she ain't no good for you
