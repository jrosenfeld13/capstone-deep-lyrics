[Verse 1]
I should warn you
Things you're feeling, aren't normal now
Think you need me
It's not easy, let you go some how

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're too far gone
Hope is such a waste
Every breath you take you give
Me the burdens bitter taste

[Chorus 1]
You promise that you'd stay
You say you want to go
Your lips provide a shelter for the
Things that I don't know

[Chorus 2]
Please speak slowly
My heart is learning
Teach me heart-ache
Stop this burning now

[Verse 2]
Wishful thinking
Patience shrinking, bliss is far away
North is calling
Now I'm falling, at your feet please stay

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2][x4]
