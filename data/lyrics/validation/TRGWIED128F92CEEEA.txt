The world's got so dark I need some guidance to see
'cause this pain in my heart is taking everything from me

If it's true that love makes the world go round
Please give some love to me
'cause I'm feeling so alone right now, it's suffocating me

God give me strength, to keep on walking
God give me strength, to keep on, keep on
God give me strength, to keep on walking
God give me strength, to keep on, keep on

The air's got so thick I find it hard to breath
And never before have I felt so desperately in need

I know that I must start listening to the voice inside of me
The truth is that when I speak to you, I hope to speak to me

God give me strength, to keep on walking
God give me strength, to keep on, keep on
God give me strength, to keep on walking
God give me strength, to keep on, keep on

Oooh, oooh, my darling
God is you
God is you

God give me strength, to keep on walking
God give me strength, to keep on, keep on
God give me strength, to keep on walking
God give me strength, to keep on, keep on

God give me strength, to keep on walking
(God, keep on giving me strength)
God give me strength, to keep on, keep on
(God, keep on, keep on giving me strength)
God give me strength, to keep on walking
(God, keep on giving me strength)
God give me strength, to keep on, keep on
(God, keep on, keep on giving me strength) [repeat]
