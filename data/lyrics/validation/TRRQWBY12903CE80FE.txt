Don't close your eyes
They may not open
What if they open
Would you be alive

Everyone falls
But not everyone rises
Why don't you get up
And rise again for me

Chorus

What if the world were
A little more perfect
Would you stop crying or
Would you take the leap
What if the world
Were a little more perfect
Would you open your eyes
And blink again for me (for me, yeah, for me)

What about friendship
What about friends
You said the whole world
Was against you
And it all had to end

What about love
What about family
What about all that
You have to live for

What if the world were
A little more perfect
Would you stop crying or
Would you take the leap
What if the world
Were a little more perfect
Would you open your eyes
And blink again for me (for me)

It isn't easy here without you
Why did you leave me
What am I supposed to do
(without you)

What if the world were
A little more perfect
Would you stop crying or
Would you take the leap
And what if the world
Were a little more perfect
Would you open your eyes~
And what if the world were
A little more perfect
Would you stop crying or
Would you take the leap
And what if the world
Were a little more perfect
Would you open your eyes
And blink again for me (for me, for me)
