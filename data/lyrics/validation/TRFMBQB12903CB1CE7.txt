Whatever Lola wants
Lola gets
And little man
Little Lola wants you

Make up your mind
To have
No regrets
Recline yourself
Resign yourself
You're through

I always get what I aim for
And your heart and soul
Is what I came for

Whatever Lola wants

No use to fight
Don't you know you can't win

You're no exception to the rule
I'm Irresistible you fool
Give in
Give in
Give in

Hello Joe, it's me!
It's so far
Hold on, that's you!

Uh huh!
Boo bee do!
Ah hah

Peek a boo!
La la la

Whoo hoo!

Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha!

I always get what I aim for
And your heart and soul
Is what I came for

Lola wants
Lola gets
You'll never win

I'm Irresistible you fool
Give in
Give in

Hello Joe!
