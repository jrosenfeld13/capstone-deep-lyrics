[Verse 1]
And it's amazing with the look in your eyes
Like you could save me
But you won't even try
And then you tell me again
How everything will be alright

And if I told you that I'm sorry
Would you tell me you were wrong?
Would you hold me down forever?
If I came to you for answers

[Chorus]
I saw pictures in my head
And I swear I saw you opening up again
Cause I would be heavenly
If baby, you'd just rescue me now

[Verse 2]
And I'm surrounded
You spill all alive and brand new
And I'll forget about you long enough
To forget why I need to

[Chorus]
I saw pictures in my head
And I swear I saw you opening up again
Cause I would be heavenly
If baby, you'd just rescue me now

[Bridge]
The days are drifting away from me
I still wake up burning through everything
And it's all I know
Somebody save me now

[Chorus]
And I saw pictures in my head
And I swear I saw you opening up again
Cause I would be heavenly
If baby, you'd just rescue me now

[Chorus]
I saw pictures in my head
I saw you opening up again
Cause I would be heavenly
If baby, you'd just rescue me now
