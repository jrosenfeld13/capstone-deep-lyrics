Out a little late, aren't you?
What's out there I don't give you?
Don't I drink and sleep with you?
What you want you'll never get
What you want is infinite
You'll never get your fill of it
So again you drink and you grind your teeth
Gnashing at the bit of this emptiness
You can't swallow down
It echoes in your mouth
The words keep bounding out

Up a little late, aren't you?
You let an empty bed scare you
Still, I drink and sleep with you
Standing up to stay awake
You start to blink, you start to sway
Blacking out another day
So again you sleep and you grind your teeth
On the kitchen floor you can't feel a thing
That's what you prefer
Yeah, you found a cure for it
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh

And again you wake from a drunken sleep
You make some promises you know you'll never keep
But at least you try
Or at least you try to try
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh

[after break and short instrumental]
Baby, I quit
I quit, I quit, I quit
I just don't want-
I can't want anything
I'm left all alone in this empty bed
Maybe I can't sleep but I can't [?] a lover to help me rest
Oh no, oh no
