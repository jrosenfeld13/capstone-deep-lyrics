An angel enters in a skull in her hand
Casket for a purse hoping to reverse
Scars that life can leave hidden up her sleave
Performs a silent mass to purify the past

This blackened heart wears virgin white
Oppression lit by candlelight
But then you change before my eyes

I see your face as I am looking through the lens
No more disgrace as I am looking through the lens

An angel sits alone, awaiting kodachrome
Striking dark facade to pose for for other gods

Take off the mask that hides the fears
Those nightmares of abusive years
And then you change before my eyes

I see your face as I am looking through the lens
No more disgrace as I am looking through the lens
I see beyond the painted walls of your defense
I see your face as I am looking through the lens

An angel for a day, she turns to fly away
Removes the wedding gown, there'll be no hiding now
And then you'll change before my eyes
