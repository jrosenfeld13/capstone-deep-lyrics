[Chorus:]
There's a hole in the world tonight
There's a Cloud of fear and sorrow
There's a hole in the world tonight
Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow

They say that anger is just love disappointed
They say that love is just a state of mind
But all this fighting over who will be anointed
Oh how can people be so blind

[Chorus:]
There's a hole in the world tonight
There's a Cloud of fear and sorrow
There's a hole in the world tonight
Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow

Oh they tell me there's a place over yonder
Cool water running through the burning sand
Until we we learn to love one
Another we never reach the promise land

[Chorus:]
There's a hole in the world tonight
There's a Cloud of fear and sorrow
There's a hole in the world tonight
Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow

[Repeat Chorus: (no music)]

[Repeat Chorus: 4x's (fade out)]
