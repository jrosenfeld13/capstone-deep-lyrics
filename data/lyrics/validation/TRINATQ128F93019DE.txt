Dododo dobedodododododododo dododo oh yeah

For quite some time I been trying my very best
Hope to get real close to you
It seems my best efforts had no real effect
And there's no way that I can get through to you

So my intentions are strictly honorable
Throughout the years that I've known you
Hoping within your heart you'll be there, willing and able
See I want you and this time I gotta get you

Hard to get, is there something that I'm doing wrong
Hard to get, oh yeah is that the game you're playing
Hard to get, oh girl won't you stop for wasting time
Hard to get, oh yeah can't you see I wanna make you mine

See I've been trying so many ways to win your attention
But it seems I can't please you
Though within your eyes I can see true affection
Your body language can't lie to me

My devotion is strongest on the level
My direction leads only to you
So deep within me only you seem able
To give me love I could never forget

[Chorus]
Hard to get, surely I'm not mistaken
Hard to get, my love is true and that's for sure
Hard to get, won't you stop playing games with my affection
Hard to get, this love I'm offering is all for you
Oh oh yeah oh yeah

You're trying to make me feel my chances are weaker
'Cause every day you're playing hide and seak
And I'm sending messages to you right around the clock
I'm still waiting, say you never answer back

[Chorus]
See I've been trying so many ways to win your attention
But it seems I can't please you
Though within your eyes I can see true affection
Your body language can't lie to me

My devotion is strongest on the level
My direction leads only to you
So deep within me only you seem able
To give me love I could never forget

[Chorus]
You're trying to make me feel my chances are weaker
'Cause every day you're playing hide and seek
And I'm sending messages to you right around the clock
I'm still waiting, say you never answer back

[Chorus]
I can see you want it
Makes no sense you're hiding
Oh oh oh yeah yeah
