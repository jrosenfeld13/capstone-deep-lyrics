Post mortal suffering
When you beg for your soul in hell
Burning in eternity
The result of a living lie
Words of a fallen savior
Are feeding my hate
Revolting thoughts of an unclean mind
Soon to be ended

I will not accept your words
I will not obey
I am not one of many
Who's living like a slave

I will start collecting
Corpses for my mass grave
Mutilation of the flesh
Will be their final stage
