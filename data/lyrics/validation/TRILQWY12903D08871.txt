I walked the highway
There's no car pool lane
But there's four or five in my brain
No pain

Mountains
Over
Dead
Princess croumbling

Days of my career
Hangin' on chandeliers
Take out some beer tonite
All right
Through The
Eastern
Waves

Hitch-hiked to Dallas
The car was clean
The seats so warm
I fell asleep
Time was set aside
Oh yeah!
