Well you get what you want and you want what you see
And that's a very simple thing to me
You've been down for too long it's not right it's just wrong
But it's true most unfortunately

You're a heartbreak collector and pyscho inspector
You're the answer that nobody needs
When you check out you can leave in no doubt
That you failed where all the others succeed

And yesterdays dreams
Have been sold off it seems
And though everyone tries
No one knows what it means
Tell me, where do you go?
Where do you go, my honey?
When you hear that shout
When all the lights go out

Well you don't speculate there's no reason to wait
When you carry yourself like you do
And there's no room for laughter you'll deal with it after
You've overthought the rest of it through

And how do you sleep when the company you keep
Comes up for air faster than you
There's no reason to live when the answers you give
Are so believable they might just be true

And yesterdays dreams
Have been sold off it seems
And though everyone tries
No one knows what it means
Tell me, where do you go?
Where do you go, my honey?
When you hear that shout
When all the lights go out

And yesterdays dreams
Have been sold off it seems
And though everyone tries
No one knows what it means
Tell me, where do you go?
Where do you go, my honey?
When you hear that shout
When all the lights go out
