If I had a penny for everytime
I didn't hold your hand
If I had a nickel for everytime
I didn't understand

I'd be the world's first billionaire
'Cause you're not there
And no one ever told me
What you already knew

If I had only reached out
I might still be touching you
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch you
(You've got, you've gotta to touch
You gotta touch the one who loves you)

I Would get embarrased for every time
A movie made you cry
You get sentimental, and
I would never know the reason why

I hold the world's highest record
For my selfish pride
Is it really over?
Can I get close to you?

I only want to show you
That I've learned a thing or two
Touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You got to....
