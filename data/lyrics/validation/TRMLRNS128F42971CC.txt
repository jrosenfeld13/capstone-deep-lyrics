Leaderboard, who's keeping score?
You've got it all but you want more
Put your money where your mouth is
Money where your mouth is
Pretty boy, who's keeping score?
You've got it all and you want more

When i said goodbye to you
I didn't think that we'd make it through
Put your money where your mouth is
Money where your mouth is
When i open up to you
You only tell me that you like the view

DO DO DO...
DO YOU KNOW WHERE TO GO IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY?

Eloquent and self assured
An artist's grasp of insecure
You put your money where your mouth is
Money where your mouth is
I'm getting bored, i'm getting bored
Of talking straight into the wall

When i said goodbye to you
I didn't think that we'd make it through
Put your money where your mouth is
Money where your mouth is
When i open up to you
You only tell me that you like the view

DO DO DO...
DO YOU KNOW WHERE TO GO IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY?

You are so disgusting
You're my hero
You look just like trouble
You're my hero

DO DO DO...

So dance the dance we used to dance
When you cared less
About the things
That don't matter at all
To anyone that i'd open my door to
