This imagery of love and truth
Your beauty and infinitude
I am mesmerized by you, my love

I'm building memories of you
You who made the sun and moon
Jesus, I have been consumed by you

Over and over your blood washes over
In infinite waves of love
Over and under
Your presence it covers
And I've been embraced by the Son
It's a quiet revolution

Your majesty and mystery
Your goodness and your sovereignty
Fear and love embracing synergy (?)
For you alone i will adore
For I have knelt upon your shore
Gazed upon your sea of love

Over and over your blood washes over
In infinite waves of love
Over and under
Your presence it covers
And I've been embraced by the Son
Over and over your blood washes over
In infinite waves of love
Over and under
Your presence it covers
And I've been embraced by the Son
It's a quiet revolution (x7)
