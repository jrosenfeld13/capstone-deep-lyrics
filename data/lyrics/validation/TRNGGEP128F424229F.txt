Looking down from on top of it all
Looking down on everyone else
So high above, it all looks the same
Bring you down to see how it is

The greatness you feel, so smug on your throne
Your view of it all is clouded and warped
Clearly you'll see how it unfolds
Brought down from above to see how it is

Don't you feel passion
Don't you know love
The bitterness that drives you
Will hurt us all

Down with the righteous, down with the liars
Down with the leaders who rape their own men
Down with your idols, down with your ideals
Down with the thieves who rob us of life

King to king, so hungry for power
Fortress to fortress with no ground to gain
On missions of hatred that lead us to ruin
A course that would change if we bring them down

Down to the sorrow, down to the crying
Brought down to the suffering, now how does it feel
Down to the horror, down to the screaming
Brought down to the silence they'll hear in the end
