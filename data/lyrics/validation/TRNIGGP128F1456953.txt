I got woke up this morning with a late night call
My telephone was ringin' clean off the wall
And on the other end a good friend says to me
Oooh, my daddy' gone, brother won't you help me please

I felt so bad, to hear him so sad, the next phone call

Now a week's gone by and it's 3 A.M
Oooh, that damn telephone is ringin' once again
I've been told to call a stranger says to me
Seems your best friend just wrapped his car around a tree

Oh Lord, what a mystery, the next phone call
What's it gonna be? The next phone call
Well it might be your brother
Oh well, it might be me
The next phone call, yeah

Now it's ringin' again, I'm half afraid to pick it up
But it's my baby's voice and ooh it cheers me up
But my ears are deceiving, what's this he's sayin'
I packed my bags today, tomorrow I'll be leavin'

Now I'm so tired of bad news, I wanna tear out the phone
But I ain't the kind to let it run me from my home
And good news or bad, I'll find out in the end
It just might be an old friend askin' how I been

Oh Lord, what a mystery, the next phone call
What's it gonna be? The next phone call
Well it might be you brother
Oh it might be you, or might just be me
Will it be good news? Will it be bad?
Will it make me happy, or will it make me sad?
The next phone call
