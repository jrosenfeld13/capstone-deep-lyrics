There was a time
In one place we put our heads together, put minds to it
And we accomplished so many things
We put heads together, put minds to it
We collide like worlds together then redefine our art
We collide like worlds together from the start
Then one boy
Less apple green puts heads together, gets to grips with gravity
He was the youngest
One on the street to put heads together put minds to it
We collide like worlds together then redefine our art
We collide like worlds together from the start we collide
There was a time
In one place we put our heads together, put minds to it
And we accomplished so many things
We put heads together, put minds to it
We collide like worlds together then redefine our art
We collide like worlds together from the start we collide, collide
