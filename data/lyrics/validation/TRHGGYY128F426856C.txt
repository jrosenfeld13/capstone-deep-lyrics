There is no time for feelings in your world
This is not the time of harmony at all
But there are crimes of violation
I can see the signs of satiation

Turn around, around your eyes
Take a look, a look inside
Turn around, around your head
Take a look, a look inside

Come on, shed your skin
Come on, shed your second skin tonight

You are not alone, open your mind
Try to find the roots of your heart
Come on and take this chance tonight
Ans show me your inside

And all the fears, fears fall down
Like the trees of autumn
Let their leaves, leaves fall down
Like the trees in autumn

Come on, shed your skin
Come on, shed your second skin tonight

Fear is like a haze
Blocking everything
Real love, luck, joy of life
It weakens your essence

When the fear is so near
Let it fall down
Let the tears in your fears
Let them fall down

Come on, shed your skin
Come on, shed your second skin, tonight
