Let the mayhem begin...

I thought you had my back.. thought i knew you
It's clear to me.. you'll see.. i don't play that game
Don't claim to be the same as me, cause you're not
You ain't gotta shot.. shot.. in this world

I will attack
You best be steppin way back!
Get away.. get away
How bout a bitch slap.. egomaniac
God damn.. i can't stand the sight of you
I'm so glad to meet you
Face to face and in person
I'm so glad to meet you
Face to face and in person

Better watch your back boy... i'll jack you up!
Time to check your clock boy... your fifteens goin fast
Don't call yourself my friend boy.. you ain't got a shot.. shot.. in this world

I will attack
You best be steppin way back!
Get away.. get away
How bout a bitch slap.. egomaniac
God damn.. i can't stand the sight of you
I'm so glad to meet you
Face to face and in person
I'm so glad to meet you
Face to face and in person

I will attack
You best be steppin way back!
Get away.. get away
How bout a bitch slap.. egomaniac
God damn.. i can't stand the sight of you
I'm so glad to meet you
Face to face and in person
I'm so glad to meet you
Face to face and in person
