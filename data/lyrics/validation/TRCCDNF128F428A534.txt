As the warriors surround our major force
We begin to let the battle take its course
Say a prayer for all men about to die
Who die in ranks without a reason why

But we'll fight it to the last
Like our fathers in the past
But we'll fight it to the last
Our swords and shields we must cast

As the soldiers charge out goes the battle cry
And blood runs into rivers where they lie
The might and muscle will not cease until the end
But every man stood ground their quest was to defend
