I don't want to be a fucking disgrace in this place do I?
I don't want to be fucking straight laced in this place do I?
I don't want to be a crease on a piece of crimpolene do I?
I don't want to be the colour grey like today do I?
I don't want to be a fucking disgrace in this place do I?
I don't want to be the colour grey like today do I?

I'll be with you
I'll be with you
For all my days

I don't want to be dragged over hot coals on a sunny day do I?
I don't want to be the weatherman in the rain do I?
I don't want to be a sign of the times do I?
I don't want to be the butt of the joke that's all folks do I?

I'll be with you
I'll be with you
For all my days
