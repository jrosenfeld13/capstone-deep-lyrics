I am Francisco Vasquez Garcia
I am welcome to Almeria
We have sin gas and con leche
We have fiesta and feria

We have the song of the chochona
We have brandy and half corona
And Leonardo and his accordione
And calamari and macaroni

[Chorus]
Come all you rambling boys of pleasure
And ladies of easy leisure
We must say adios until we see
Almeria once again

There is a minstrel, there you see
And he stoppeth one in three
He whispers in this one's ear
"Will you kindly kill that doll for me?"

Now he has won chochona in the bingo
All the town has watched this crazy gringo
As he pulls off the doll's head laughing
And miraldo! throws its body in the sea

[Chorus]

El vienticinco de agosto
Abrio sus ojos Jaime Fearnley
Pero el bebe cinquante Gin-campari
Y se tendio para cerrarlos

Y Costello el rey de America
Y su esposa Cait O Riordan
Non rompere mes colliones
Los gritos fuera de las casas

[Chorus]
