[Verse 1]
Emptiness weighing me down
Let me take a break to figure me out
No point finishing now
Playing the wrong game, rolling down

[Bridge]
I can't take word from no one
I can't be who you want
Is it, worth it?
Having paper jars
Is it, worth it?
Ignoring what you want

[Chorus]
And if you wanna change me
Watch me, cause I do what I do
And if you tryna play me
Ain't nobody playing for you
And if you wanna change me
Ain't nobody changing for you
Say no more, Take it slow
You think it's all about you

[Verse 2]
Whose world is it anyway
School to the most, so we're all the same
You can't frown with the smile on my face when dreams trump reality
Fuck what they're telling me

[Bridge]
I can't take word from no one
I can't be who you want

[Chorus]
And if you wanna change me
Watch me, cause I do what I do
And if you tryna play me
Ain't nobody playing for you
And if you wanna change me
Ain't nobody changing for you
Say no more, Take it slow
You think it's all about you

[Chorus]
And if you wanna change me
Watch me, cause I do what I do
And if you tryna play me
Ain't nobody playing for you
And if you wanna change me
Ain't nobody changing for you
Say no more, Take it slow
You think it's all about you
