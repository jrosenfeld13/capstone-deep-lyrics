Doesn't seem that long ago
Three of us walkin' down that road
Grey fifty-five Chevy, parked in the front yard
Little Melody tagged along
Those were the best days now they're gone

It's been twelve years since it went down
Lord, lost my best friend now
I can still see him, fishin' on that old dock
I know I can?t bring back yesterday
But oh, Lord, can you help me find my way?

Down to Brickyard Road, oh, walk on down
Down to Brickyard Road, he's with me now
Swore I saw a free bird fly, ridin' the winds of the Southern sky
When I hear that whistle blow
It carries me back to Brickyard Road

Brother, do you realize what you've done?
Touched the hearts of everyone
You might've died too young but your songs live on
I know I can?t bring back yesterday
But we'll be all together again some day

Down to Brickyard Road, oh, walk on down
Down to Brickyard Road, he's with us now
Swore I saw a free bird fly, ridin' the winds of the Southern sky
When I hear that whistle blow
It carries me back down to Brickyard Road, oh, Brickyard Road

Down to Brickyard Road, oh, walk on down
To Brickyard Road, oh, he's with us now, he's with us now
Swore I saw a free bird fly, ridin' the winds of the Southern sky
When I hear that whistle blow
It carries me back down to Brickyard Road
And Brickyard Road, oh, he's with us now

I can see him standin' on the dock
Saw his Chevy out in the front yard
Walk on down, walk on down
Oh, Brickyard Road, he's with us now, he's with us now
Oh, Brickyard Road, walk on down, walk on down

Momma and Daddy's doin' all right
I saw Melody last Saturday night
She's all grown up, she's such a pretty girl
Things just ain't the same since you left our world
Walk on down

Wanna go back
Wanna go back to
Brickyard Road, Brickyard Road, oh

God, won't you turn it back
Oh, turn on, turn on, turn on, oh
Down to Brickyard road
Oh, I can see him now, I can see him now
Down to Brickyard road
