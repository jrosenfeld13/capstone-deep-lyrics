I want to fly a little to the right, I'll never get to crowsdell
And I want to stay awake all night to realise (I'm not Ben Hoy)

What should I take with me to the north? It's the good north
The promised success, the appropriate north. It's the good north

Apparently, you're happy, you've realised
I'm meant to be, unhappy, I've realised (I'm not Ben Hoy)

What should I take with me to the north? It's the good north
The promised success, the appropriate north. It's the good north

I want to reunite, I'll never save (What will you save?)
When everything is broken now
I want to reunite I'll never save (What will you save?)
Everything is broken

I want to fly a little to the right, I'll never get to crowsdell
And I want to stay awake all night to realise (I'm not Ben Hoy)

And what should I take with me to the north? It's the good north
The promised success, the appropriate north. It's the good north

I want to reunite I need to save (What will you save?)
When everything is broken now
When everything is broken now
When everything is broken now
When everything is broken now

Everything's gone now, everything's gone now
(You've gone now, when everything's broken now)
Everything's gone running without a sound
