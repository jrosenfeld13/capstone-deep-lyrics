You see it in your dreams
Keeping you from sleep
You're just not the same as you used to be
You're trying to move on
Been trying for so long
You're just not the same
You will never be

I know how it hurts
I know we have all been where we cry
And baby you hurt oh I know
Things we did they just won't die
But life it goes on
Gotta live
We gotta live with how it feels

Down there inside
The feelings that you fight
The demons that you hide
Know you're not alone in how you feel down there inside
We've all got things we hide
You feel down there inside
So hurt

You've got your mistakes
You lived ugly days
No you're not the same as you used to be
And all your memories are living in your dreams
You're just not the same
You will never be

I know how it hurts
I know we have all been where we cry
And baby you hurt oh I know
Things we did they just won't die
But life it goes on
Gotta live
We gotta live with how it feels

Down there inside
The feelings that you fight
The demons that you hide
Know you're not alone in how you feel down there inside
We've all got things we hide
You feel down there inside
So hurt

Live
We gotta live with how it feels

Down there inside
The feelings that you fight
The demons that you hide
Know you're not alone in how you feel down there inside
We've all got things we hide
You feel down there inside

So hurt
So hurt
So hurt
You hurt
You see it in your dreams
