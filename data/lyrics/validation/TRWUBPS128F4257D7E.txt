Once upon a time, I took an airplane
I went to San Diego, California
That was a three hour trip
I've enjoyed myself, flying in the air

[Chorus]
Northwest Airlines
Northwest Airlines
Northwest Airlines
Northwest Airlines
Northwest Airlines

While I was in the air, I had fun
The airplane was at an altitude
Of 35,000 feet, it was a long trip
It was a fun flight

[Chorus]

The people on the airplane were nice
I chatted with them a lot
I was having a fun time
It was a good flight

[Chorus]

Rock over London
Rock on Chicago
American Airlines
We mean business in Chicago
