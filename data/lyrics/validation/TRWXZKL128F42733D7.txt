[Verse 1]
Barroom night life weekend romance used to turn me on
I was wild and winded and never gave my restless heart to anyone
One night stands would end up from a midnight rendezvous
Well I never ever thought that I would fall in love with you

[Chorus]
I never ever thought that I would fall in love with you
Cause I'd built a wall around my heart that no one could get through
For once I had it broke and I still feel the bruise
And I never ever thought that I would fall in love with you

[Verse 2]
Well the passion rises in my heart each time you're in my arms
The sensations of these feelings oh have never felt this strong
Well I've always played the heartbreak kid I turned to acting so cool
I never ever thought that I would fall in love with you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well I don't like to taste my pride but I guess that I was wrong
I never meant to hurt you girl I was afraid to fall in love
Well come on baby let's take it slow cause my heart is still confused
And I never ever thought that I would fall in love with you

[Chorus]

[Outro]
That I would fall in love with you that I would fall in love with you
