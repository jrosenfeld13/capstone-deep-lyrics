The next train will be leaving from platform one

Stop that train, I wanna get on
My baby, she is leaving me now
Stop that train, I wanna get on
My baby, she is leaving me now

Shalalala... (Big-a jump, eyah)
Shalalala... (Oooh, yeaheah)
Shalalala... (Big-a jump, eyah)
Shalalala...

Stop that train, I wanna get on
My baby, she is leaving me now
Stop that train, I wanna get on
My baby, she is leaving me now

Shalalala... (Big-a jump, eyah)
Shalalala... (Oooh, yeaheah)
Shalalala... (Big-a jump, eyah)
Shalalala...

'Cause if you miss the train I'm on
How did you know that I am gone?
And you can hear the whistle blow five hundred miles

Five hundred miles, five hundred miles
Was he so damn sit on the voodoo file
And you can hear the whistle blow five hundred miles

Hey, mister postman, bring back my woman
Hey, mister postman, bring back my woman

I need, I need, I need a woman (Big-a jump, hey-a)
I want, I want, I want a good one (Oh yeah, me wanna)

'Cause if you miss the train I'm on
And then you'll know that I am gone
And you can hear the whistle blow five hundred miles

Five hundred miles, five hundred miles
Was he so damn sit on the voodoo file
And you can hear the whistle blow five hundred miles

Let it go!
