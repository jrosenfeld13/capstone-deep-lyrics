I was born by the river
That my momma cried when my daddy died
Maybe that was the reason I didn't get the attention that I was needing to cuss (curse), 'cause I reminded her of him too much (him too much)
Couldn't understand what she felt so I hated her yeah til I was old enough to hate myself
And I felt like a slave down in South Carolina
Cursing the vagina that gave life to me oh
I couldn't see what I had the potential to be til I got down on my knees and begged God to please
Take control of my life today 'cause there's no way there's no way no way no way I, I can do it on my own hey
And no matter how my friends tried to console
They could never never know what I go through
So I turned my heart over completely to you
Yes Lord I do

I was born in a hurry
'cause my momma had to be back to work at 8:30
Maybe that was the reason there was always this feeling like she was rushing herself
She didn't even have the time to spend loving herself, let alone someone else
So I hated her yeah 'cause I loved her yeah
And I cried yeah like the klu klux klan at the Million Man March
Partially broke my spirit
Partially broke my heart
I couldn't start to be what I had the potential to be til I got down on my knees and begged God to please
Take control of my life today
'cause there's no way there's no way no way no way I, I can make it on my own hey
And no matter how my friends tried to console They could never know what I go through
So I turn my heart over completely to you yes Lord I do
