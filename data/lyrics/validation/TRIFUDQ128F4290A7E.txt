Wouldn't it be good to be on your side, oohh
Check this out
(Thursday night, That's official)
I knew this was normal, we meat from the start
Faith brought us here together, I know we playing our part
Now my heart is not to be messed around with
I went thru to many relationships to fall in the ditch
And now to switch to how you can just come back and explain
That you've changed and maybe we could rearrange
And make things the same but I know your aim is one: Just a game
I knew that you were sorry and this time you really meant it
And that you pray to got that the commitment, but I reset it
I mean, do you truly understand how much a family means to me
And how a family must stand and that a woman must be strong enough
Stay long enough, see thru wrongs enough to correct her man
And like girl we got to have this plan
We can built this foundations on the run, and not on same
Wouldn't it be good to be in your shoes
Even if it was for just one day
Wouldn't it be good if we could wish ourselves away
Wouldn't it be good to be on your side
Grass is always greener over there
Wouldn't it be good if we could live without a gear
(Thursday night, that's official)
Late nights I stay up thinking of you
This time candle lights I burn for you
Trust me again and I earn for you
I guess it's time for the right thing and it's my turn to do
To refocus and just commit
Get that house that I always wanted and live til I'm 96
And tell the tail how grandpa survived it all and went from poor to rich
Always be no odds, stay away from the mad make gods
Read the message among the stars, put these fancy cars
I'm going to stay focus on the goal
And that's to be a soldier in a war gone cold
Spread some love to who ever needs it
And make them believe it that they still can rebuild and achieve it
And if you see this, we can be this
Whatever happened in the past, f**k it,we can beat this
Wouldn't it be good to be in your shoes
Even if it was for just one day
Wouldn't it be good if we could wish ourselves away
Wouldn't it be good to be on your side
Grass is always greener over there
Wouldn't it be good if we could live without a gear
(Oh, sure, they're from another planet)
Wouldn't it be good oh so good!?
Wouldn't it be good for just one day?
Wouldn't it be good so far away, yeah!
Wouldn't it be good to be in your shoes
Even if it was for just one day
Wouldn't it be good if we could wish ourselves away
Wouldn't it be good to be on your side
Grass is always greener over there
Wouldn't it be good if we could live without a gear
(Background:
I'm tired so bad, don't know how bad now
You've got it easy, you don't know when you got it good
It's getting harder, just keep your life and soul together
I'm sick of fighting even though I know should
