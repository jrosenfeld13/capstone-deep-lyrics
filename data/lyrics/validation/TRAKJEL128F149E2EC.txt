I always knew you were a landslide
Like plains are roofs until they fly
What you've been calling minor cracks dear
I fear are bound to shift to gaps of greed
Leave
Before they come and call you
Before you're stuck with me
Never ask for any meaning
Never ask me to be dealing
With the cure for what im healing
Wait in vain for prefab feelings
Now comes the time to face your plot dear
And to embrace this mental plague
I'm your neurotic countercrashtest
May i steal the engine from your burning wreck?
Fear
Won't drive you to my outskirts
So get off while you can
Jump into the same old river
Knights are white and horses shiver
Hate the series love the trailer
Like the song but hate the lyrics
So now i've written you my last will
It sounds exactly like the first
I might escort you to my to the exit
Face it dear
I'm just a hunter with no gear
Hey
This silence is amusing
And it would be a shame to sing
Bout diamonds falling off my ceiling
Moralisers keep patrolling
All my exes keep on calling
Greet the gap before you're falling
Never say you love me (you don't)
Never say you do (you don't)
Never say you trust me (you don't)
Don't believe my truth (landslide)
Fruits are best forbidden (to rot)
Roots are there to hide (deep down)
Memory's a riddance (recall)
Overpaint the slides (landslide)
Love me like a landslide (you don't)
Lead me to my mud (you won't)
Slide into the open (landslide)
Gliding from my hand (landslide)
