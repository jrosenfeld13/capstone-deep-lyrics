As she sits upon a window sill
She knows that love is something she'll never feel
And her tears keep her company
While she dreams of how it would be

CHORUS
And as she cries someone whispers in her ear
I died for you, I died for you my dear

And as she falls into her daddy's arms, she knows that this is true
And as she cries, he cries too

CHORUS 2X

She could hardly see, but she could believe

And as she knows, in her heart of hearts that the Lord loves her soul

CHORUS

And as she smiles, someone whispers in her ear
I love you, I love you, my dear

She could hardly see, but she could believe
