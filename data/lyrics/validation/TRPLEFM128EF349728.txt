I don't want you to be no slave
I don't want you to work all day
I don't want you to be true
I just want to make love to you

I don't want you to wash my clothes
I don't want you to keep our home
I don't want your money too
I just want to make love to you
Love to you
Love to you
Love to you

[Harmonica solo]

I can tell by the way you
Switch and walk
Now I can see by the way you
Baby talk
Now I can know by the way you
Treat your man
That I could love you baby until the
Cryin' shame

I don't want you to cook my bread
I don't want you to make my bed
I don't want you because I'm sad and blue
I just want to make love to you
Love to you
Love to you
Love to you
