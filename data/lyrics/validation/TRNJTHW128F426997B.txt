Hear that whistle it's ten o'clock (don't let go don't let go)
Come on baby it's time to rock (don't let go don't let go)
I'm so happy I got you here (don't let go don't let go)
Keeps me grinnin' for ear to ear (don't let go don't let go)

Oowee hmm this feelin's killin' me
Ah shucks well I wouldn't stop for a million bucks
I love you so just hold me tight and don't let go

Thunder lightning wind and rain (don't let go don't let go)
Love is poundin' inside my brain (don't let go don't let go)
I'm so eager I'm nearly dyin' (don't let go don't let go)
You've been keepin' your lips from mine (don't let go don't let go)

Oowee hmm this feelin's killin' me...

( sax - guitar )
Hound dog barkin' up side the hill (don't let go don't let go)
Love is draggin' him through the mill (don't let go don't let go)
Now if it wadn't for havin' you (don't let go don't let go)
I'd be barkin' and howlin' too (don't let go don't let go)

Oowee hmm this feelin's killin' me...
Hold me tight and don't let go...
