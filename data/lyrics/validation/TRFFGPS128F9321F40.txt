I've got a bad case of history
Obsessing me, caressing me but I'll never stop
I've got a deep side memory
Infesting me, it's best to see I'm over the top

In the blackness of decay
I can't give myself away

I've gotta blind handed destiny
Exiting me, inviting me to where I get off
I've gotta ...
But there's a factory outside where all the creamers since been had

And I watch the sun go down
On the princess and her gown

God only knows (God only knows)
God only knows (God only knows)
God only knows (God only knows)
God only knows (God only knows)

I've got a bad case of history
I'm dancing 'round without a sound on [?] hill
I've got a dead ghost inside of me
I keep him hid, I can't get rid of him but I will
I've got a dark clouded mystery
Your misery or somebody that's watching me still

It's as silent as the glove
When you find yourself in love
