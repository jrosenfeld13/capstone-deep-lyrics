When you've had your fun, and your work is done
You must not succumb
I can feel you breathe. It's like a mega-weedge inside
Please don't hide

So mom, if you please, pass me the pork roll egg and cheese, if you please
On a kaiser bun
Mom, if you please, pass me the pork roll egg and cheese, if you please
On a kaiser bun
When the guava's drained, Eddie Dingle remains
But we must further ourselves on
So dynamic is life, staring into the sight's
Not right, but wrong in a good way

So mom, if you please, pass me the pork roll egg and cheese, if you please
On a kaiser bun
Mom, if you please, pass me the pork roll egg and cheese, if you please
On a kaiser bun

When you've had your fun, and your work is done
You must not succumb
I can feel you breathe. It's like a mega-weedge inside
Please don't hide

So mom, if you please, pass me the pork roll egg and cheese, if you please
On a kaiser bun
Mom, if you please, pass me the pork roll egg and cheese, if you please
On a kaiser bun
Mom, if you please, pass me the pork roll egg and cheese, if you please
Kaiser bun. Pork roll egg and cheese
