[Verse 1]
Day after day, time passed away
And I just can't get you off my mind
Nobody knows, I hide it inside
I keep on searching but I can't find

[Pre-Chorus]
The courage to show, to letting you know
I've never felt so much love before
And once again I'm thinking about
Taking the easy way out

[Chorus]
But if I let you go I will never know
What my life would be holding you close to me
Will I ever see you smiling back at me?
Oh yeah, how will I know
If I let you go?

[Verse 2]
Night after night I hear myself say
Why can't this feeling just fade away
There's no one like you (no one like you)
You speak to my heart (speak to my heart)
It's such a shame we're worlds apart

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm too shy to ask, I'm too proud to lose
But sooner or later I gotta choose
And once again I'm thinking about
Taking the easy way out

[Chorus]
But if I let you go I will never know
What my life would be holding you close to me
Will I ever see you smiling back at me?
Oh yeah, how will I know
If I let you go?

[Bridge]
If I let you go, ooooh baby
Ooh, once again I'm thinking about
Taking the easy way out

[Chorus]
But if I let you go I will never know
What my life would be holding you close to me
Will I ever see you smiling back at me?
Oh yeah, how will I know
If I let you go?

[Outro]
But if I let you go I will never know
Will I ever see you smiling back at me?
Oh yeah, how will I know
If I let you go?
