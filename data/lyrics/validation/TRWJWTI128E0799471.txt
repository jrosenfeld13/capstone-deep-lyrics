Oooh Baby
Oooh Babe...

(Verse 1)
Everythin you said to me tell me was I buggin, dreamin
Cuz it's not that real to me
There has been no sleepin
I've been thinkin of how I...

(Bridge)
Begged to love me
(now you) want to leave me
(and it) hurts me deeply inside
(ooh baby how I...)
Want to touch you
(and i) need to hold you
(baby) stay with me one more night (one more night)

(Chorus)
Turn around, and take just one more look
See if your really sure
That you can walk away
From my love
Down on my knees to pray
And you will turn around and be my baby

(Verse 2)
Begged to love me
(now you) want to leave me
(and it) hurts me deeply inside
(ooh baby how i..) begged to love me
(now you) want to leave me
(and it) hurts me deeply inside
(ooh baby how i..)
Want to touch you
(and i) need to hold you
(baby) stay with me one more night (one more night)
Want to touch you
(and i) need to hold you
(baby) stay with me one more night (one more night)
All the moments that we shared
You could never put a price on us
I tried to trust in you
After all of this i've deered
You say that you are leavin
Have you been thinkin (of how I...)

(Bridge)
Begged to love me
(now you) want to leave me
(and it) hurts me deeply inside
(ooh baby how i..)
Want to touch you
(and i) need to hold you
(baby) stay with me one more night (one more night)

(Chorus)
Turn around, and take just one more look
See if your really sure
That you can walk away
From my love
I'm beggin you to stay
Down on my knees to pray
That you will turn around and be my baby

(Verse 3)
Just when i give in, you're leavin
Don't walk away from my love
Can't go a day without your love
Your all i'm dreamin of turn around, and take just one more look
See if your really sure
That you can walk away
From my love
I'm beggin you to stay
Down on my knees to pray
That you will turn around and be my baby
Just try again, believe me
This is where love begins
Don't wanna here you say
That you wanna walk away

(Chorus 3X)
Turn around, and take just one more look
See if your really sure
That you can walk away
From my love
I'm beggin you to stay
Down on my knees to pray
That you will turn around and be my baby

(Chorus fades)
