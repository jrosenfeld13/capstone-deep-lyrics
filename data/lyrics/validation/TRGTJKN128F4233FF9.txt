[Intro: Breez Evahflowin]
Yo.  Breez Evahflowin.  Stonegroove in it.  U.S. to U.K., improving it.  Im from New York

[Verse 1: Breez Evahflowin]
And its a rough city unless you a jigga or Puff Diddy
Lifes like a bitch made of brickstough titties
Stand out like the results of a buck fifty
Wild like one hand on the wheel, the other whiskey
Its the riskiest path to choose, but if
This be the gas, Imma mass some fuel
After school, drop fantastic jewels
This a racestay frozen, Im passing you
Harrassing you, battle and embarrassing you
Tearing your grin in two (What?), exposing your mentals (Ahhh!)
I only take Cheapshots on instrumentals
This funny-looking nigga bring it
Wrote a hook, wish Aaliyah was down here to sing it
It bring a tear to my eye
Only deal in the truth, hear the proof in the chorus
Coming down harder than the tooth on a walrus
Whatever!  (Flowin)

[Hook: Naya Tabia and (Breez Evahflowin)]
You dont know the different thoughts of me (What is good?  What is good?)
Look at what hip hop has done to me (Hip hop and you dont stop.  What?)
Fronting like this all yall wanna be (Keep fronting, keep, ke-keep fronting)
Youre just a fantasy (Word)

[Interlude: Breez Evahflowin]
Yo.  Its like I was talking to my man Stelf Index.  Ayyo, theres a lot of fantasy gangsters out here.  So, yo, Stronghold gon speak on it.  Yo

[Verse 2: Breez Evahflowin]
So far, not a bad year.  Breez joints mad near
Like smoke to the lungs of Vast Aire
Yall need to cop that Cannibal
Less you lost in the bullshitthats understandable
Its hard to resist the hypnotic repeat
Of garbage rocked at least forty hours a week
Dont front like the product is weak
NYC underground rise from the part of the deep

[Hook: Naya Tabia and (Breez Evahflowin)]
You dont know what this has me (What it done?  What it done?)
Look at what hip hop has done to me (Hip hop and you dont stop, stop)
Fronting like this all yall wanna be (Keep fronting, keep, ke-keep fronting)
Youre just a fantasy (Word)

[Verse 3: Breez Evahflowin]
When I sell my CDs to label owners
I spit on them first like them cats in the back of the McDonalds
Arrogant models keep fronting
Cause when I heat something, dont be like Breez, I need something
Keep hunting.  Forgiveness come through knee-bumping
Be bumping my shit like Tell me I aint
And keep a straight face.  So I can encase
The image when you igillimate and you vacate
A day takes more to wait, more wrong to break
From the cultivate, I motivate
I only play the odds when success looks clear
And take tests under stress where the best get dizz
Iron-sharp and iron-tight, stone-fist-rock the mic
Like Terror.  You scored but your stats dont count
Like era.  There are
Better ways in than to pay them.  Fuck that, yo

[Hook: Naya Tabia and (Breez Evahflowin)]
You dont know what this has me (What it done?  What it done?)
Look at what hip hop has done to me
Fronting like this all yall wanna be
Youre just a fantasy

[Outro: Breez Evahflowin]
Its like what?  Uh.  Breez Evahflowin.  Stonegroove in it.  Stronghold keep moving it.  Haha, haha, haha.  Yeah.  For all those out there feeling this tune
