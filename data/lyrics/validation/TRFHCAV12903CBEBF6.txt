And did those feet in ancient time
Walk upon England's mountain green
And was the holy Lamb of God
In England's pleasant pastures seen!

And did the Countenance Divine
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?
And was Jerusalem builded here
Among those dark Satanic Mills?

Bring me my Bow of burning goal
Bring me my Arrows of desire
Bring me my Spear: O Clouds unfold!
Bring me my Chariot of fire!

I will not cease from Mental Fight
Nor shall my Sword sleep in my hand
Until we have built Jerusalem
In England's green and pleasant land
Until we have built Jerusalem
In England's green and pleasant land
