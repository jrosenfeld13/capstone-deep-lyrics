My head's in the dark, my heart's on the loose
It's the dogs in the alley I can't refuse
I beat the drum to the winds of change
But the winds of change are out of my range
I'm part of the city, it's part of me
We're part of something that can not be seen
One half's dirty and the other half's clean
The past's pain leaves the deepest stain
People, where are you?
On the razorsedge
Is where the action is
On the razorsedge
Love is avarice
Cut through you like a razorblade
Five days a week I slammed the door
Breathed the dirt and the hammer of the factory floor
But the things you hide far beneath
Just rise to the surface as you try to sleep
Is what you do worth what you get paid
When it stays with you twenty four hours a day
My mind was blocked, I needed someone to pick my locks
I had to get out, I had to breakthrough
People, where are you?
On the razorsedge
Is where the action is
On the razorsedge
Love is avarice
Cut through you like a razorblade
