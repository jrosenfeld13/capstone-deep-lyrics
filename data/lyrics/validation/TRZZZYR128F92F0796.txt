[Verse 1]
Do you worry that you're not liked
How long till you break
You're happy cause you smile
But how much can you fake
An ordinary boy, an ordinary name
But ordinary's just not good enough today

No, a woo oo
Ow, a woo oo
Ow, a woo oo

[Pre-Chorus]
Alone x7
I'm thinking

[Chorus]
Why-eieieie yeah, Superman's dead
Eieieie, yeah, is it in my head?
Eieieie, yeah, we'll just laugh instead
I worry about the weather
Whether not you should hate hate hate

[Verse 2]
Now you're worried about your faith
Kneel down and obey
You're happy you're in love
You need someone to hate
An ordinary girl, an ordinary waist
But ordinary's just not good enough today

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

[Pre-Bridge]
No, a woo wo
Ow, a woo wo
Ow, a woo wo
Why-eieieie yeah x4

[Bridge]
Doesn't anybody ever know x3
That the world's a subway, subway
Doesn't any, any, any, any, any
That the world's a subway, subway, HIE
