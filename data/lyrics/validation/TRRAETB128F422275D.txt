Don't ask me why I'm so angry
Or why I'm so disturbed
Unless you got a couple good hours
To hear my troubling words
You talk of truth, honor and respect
You talk of living, but you haven't lived
Seems to me your always on the take
That's because you ain't got nothing to give

Chorus:
Don't ask me why! I will not pretend!
Just walk on by! Cuz today I'm no man's friend!

Seems to me you got a couple of your wires crossed
You're in the right place at the wrong time!
You don't seem to be bothering anybody else now
But you're sure taking up space in my mind!

(Repeat Chorus)
