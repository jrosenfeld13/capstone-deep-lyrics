It all started with a shotgun, back in 1973
When my Daddy bought a brand new twelve gauge
Gave his old one to my brother and me
Now we went out shootin' stop signs
One night when he was workin' late
And that's how I learned the meaning of a misdemeanor
At the ripe old age of eight

But Daddy it wasn't even my idea, I did it on a double dog dare
And it's a cold, hard fact when you're young and dumb
The trouble with trouble is, it starts out as fun

Now midnight racin' at the K Mart 'round 1979
I betcha I'll beat to the garden shop, seemed like a good idea at the time
So I buckled up for safety, I pushed my pedal down all the way
And I finally found the finish line in a window full a lingerie

They let me make one phone call, "Hello Daddy, remember me?"
He said, "No!, I'm gonna hafta sleep on that, I'll come down there in the mornin' and see"

And Officer it wasn't even my idea, I did it on a double dog dare
And it's a cold, hard fact when you're young and dumb
The trouble with trouble is, it starts out as fun

It's a good fifteen years later, it's a small town Saturday night
And they're still sneakin' out their windows, wrappin' houses and pickin' fights
And I've long since retired, yeh, I put away my teenage ways
But did Daddy find it difficult not to laugh, like I do when I hear mine say

Oh Mama it wasn't even my idea, I did it on a double dog dare
And it's a cold, hard fact when you're young and dumb
The trouble with trouble is, it starts out as fun, fun, fun, fun, fun
