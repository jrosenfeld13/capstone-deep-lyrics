Dream A Dream
Lo, How A Rose E're Blooming
Lo, how a rose e'er blooming
From tender stem hath sprung!
Of jesse's lineage coming
As men of old have sung
It came, a flow'ret bright
Amid the cold of winter
When half spent was the light

Isaiah 'twas foretold it

The rose i have in mind
With mary we behold it
The virgin mother kind

To show god's love aright

She bore to men a saviour
When half spent was the night

O flow'r, whose fragrance tender

With sweetness fills the air
Dispel in glorious splendour
The darkness ev'ry where

True man, yet very god

From sin and death now save us
And share our ev're load
