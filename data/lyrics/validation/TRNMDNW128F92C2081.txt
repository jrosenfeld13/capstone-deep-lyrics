Barney and me
You know we lived out our dreams
Outside the newsagents closed for the night

We dreamt of being kings
Okay, we did the same things
But never the same way twice

The picture's faded, I'm still the same
It's the picture that keeps me sane
Ooh, it stops the lonely thinking
Of the time when we were the only?

Ooh it stops my mind from going round?
Round, round, round and round it goes
Not much to say, you've headed out
On Kingsway while I took the avenue down

Tomorrow would be the same
Somehow, I feel it's a shame
That we won't be there tonight

Reflected in the pane
Sitting through the rain
And the dark, barely seventeen
Feeling like we've been here so long
