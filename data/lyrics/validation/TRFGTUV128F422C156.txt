[Verse 1]
You were born on a black day
Shot through with starlight
And all the angels singing
Just about got it right

[Verse 2]
Cut through with silver
And goodness did heaven know
I don't know where we're going
But darling bless your soul

[Chorus]
Baby, set my soul on fire
I've got two little arms to hold on tight and I want to take you higher
Baby, never should say never
I've got a hurricane inside my veins and I want to stay forever

[Verse 3]
Sweetheart, it may not be easy
But we're trying hard to hold on
Trying to make it better

[Verse 4]
Sweetheart, you get so much freedom
But freedom is just another word
When you've no one left to hurt
And I said

[Chorus x2]

[Outro]
I've got two little arms to hold on tight and I want to stay forever
I've got a hurricane inside my veins and I want to stay forever
