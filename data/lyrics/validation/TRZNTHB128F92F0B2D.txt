Give me a woman, give me a blues tune
'Fore I start roamin', just make it real soon
I know that somewhere she's waiting for me
I know that she'll care, won't make me lonely
Give me a woman, any kinda woman will do

And if I find her, I'll take her with me
My past behind me, nothing can stop me
And when I see her, I know I've found her
Won't stand nobody hanging around her
Give me a woman, any kinda woman will do

Give me a woman, give me a blues tune
'Fore I start roamin', just make it real soon
I know that somewhere she's waiting for me
I know that she'll care, won't make me lonely
Give me a woman, any kinda woman will do
