I'm flying across the ocean
And I'm soaring back home
To the place I was born and probably raised
And I'm flying across the mountains and valleys
Back home to the one that I love so happily

Can ya' blame me for feeling homesick
'cause I've been away such a very long long time ?
I served a while in the county jail, five years for

For bein' hungry tired and poor, I got worried so

On and on this I will follow with your buttons and bows
On and on this I will follow, all alone
You know I will follow with your buttons and bows
With your buttons and your bows
On and on I'm flying across the ocean, going home

I'm flying across the ocean
Goin' home, hoo hoo
