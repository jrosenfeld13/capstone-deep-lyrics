[Verse 1]
I love the way that your heart breaks
With every injustice and deadly fate
Praying it all will be new
And living like it all depends on you, oh

[Chorus]
Here you are down on your knees again
Trying to find air to breathe again
And only surrender will help you now
I love you, please see and believe again

[Verse 2]
I love that you're never satisfied
With face value, wisdom and happy lies
You take what they say and go back and cry
You're so close to me that you nearly died, oh

[Chorus]
Here you are down on your knees again
Trying to find air to breathe again
And only surrender will help you now
I love you, please see and believe again

[Bridge]
They don't have to understand you, be still
Wait and know I understand you, be still, be still

[Breakdown]
Here you are down on your knees again
Trying to find air to breathe again
And only surrender will help you now
The floodgates are breaking and pouring out

[Chorus 2]
Here you are down on your knees (whoa)
Trying to find air to breathe (whoa)
Right where I want to you to be again
I love you, please see and believe again

[Outro]
Here you are down on your knees again (whoa)
Trying to find air to breathe again (whoa)
Right where I want you to be again
See and believe
