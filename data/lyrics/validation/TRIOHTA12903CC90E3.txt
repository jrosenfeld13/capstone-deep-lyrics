(Nananana)

[Verse 1]
I don't dare to let it show
Therefor you will never know
What I really feel inside
And how I lay awake at night

[Pre-Chorus]
Will I ever fall in love?
And if I do, will it be with you?
Will I ever fall in love?
And will you be the one for me?

[Chorus]
Will I ever fall in love?
And if I do, will it be with you?
Will I ever fall in love?
And will you be the one for me?

[Post-Chorus]
Nananana, wey-oh
Nanananananana, wey-oh
Nananana, wey-oh
Nanananananana, wey-oh

[Verse 2]
I guess it's all in my head
And I will be alone instead
Dreaming of a night with you
And all the things that we would do

[Pre-Chorus]
Will I ever fall in love?
And if I do, will it be with you?
Will I ever fall in love?
And will you be the one for me?

[Chorus]
Will I ever fall in love?
And if I do, will it be with you?
Will I ever fall in love?
And will you be the one for me?

[Outro]
Nananana, wey-oh
Nanananananana, wey-oh
Nananana, wey-oh
Nanananananana, wey-oh
Nananana, wey-oh
Nanananananana, wey-oh
Nananana, wey-oh
Nanananananana, wey-oh
