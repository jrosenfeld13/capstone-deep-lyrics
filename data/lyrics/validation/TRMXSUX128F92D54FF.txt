[Verse 1]
I've been trying for days
To think of a way
To find the words to make sense
Of how we behave
This might take a while
So please just hear me out
We know how things can get crazy
When we go ablaze
We just get carried away

[Pre-Chorus]
Believe me, I know
Don't even say a word
Now please just hear me out

[Chorus]
See my side
And I'll see yours better
Love me back
And I'll love you better

[Verse 2]
Sometimes the stunts that we pull
Don't even make sense
But I was never the one to feel that resent
This ain't 'bout who's to blame
So please just hear me out
When the scene gets intense
It's hard to prevent
From going all crazy again

[Pre-Chorus]
Believe me
I know
Don't even say a word
Now please just hear me out

[Chorus]
See my side
And I'll see yours better
Love me back
And I'll love you better
See my side
And I'll see yours better
Love me back
And I'll love you better

[Bridge]
We'll get right back
On the right track
We'll get right back on
We'll get right back on
On the right track

[Chorus]
See my side
And I'll see yours better
Love me back
And I'll love you better
See my side
And I'll see yours better
Love me back
And I'll love you better
