Rain keeps on falling
Sun refuse to shine
Baby quit your stalling
And say that you are mine

'Cos I've got so many troubles
Oh, I feel like I could cry
Going down in the subway
Jump on the train-tracks and die

Down in the subway
I hide these tears of mine
Down in the subway
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry 'til the end of the line

Cold-hearted baby
You're too mean to smile
Every day is stormy
Oh, you're my evil child

I've got so many troubles
Oh, I feel like I could cry
Going down in the subway
Jump on that train-track and die

Red-blooded baby
You're too tough for me
Well I don't mean maybe
Oh why don't you let me be

'Cos I got so many troubles
Whoa I feel like I could cry
Going down in the subway
Jump on that train-track and die

Jump on that train-track and die

Jump on that train-track and die

Going down in the subway
Jump on that train-track and die

Jump on that train-track and die
