No one is helping you, you have to help yourself
Think about what you are or take the stairs to hell
Crawling in between symptoms of decline
Following a dark road while searching for a light

Your halo is broken
Your last will unspoken
You shadows and demons are fading
Welcome back to real life

No one loves you, you have to love yourself
This terrified state built by you, not the fault of someone else
Crawling in between symptoms of decline
Following an endless road long way back in time

Your halo is broken
Your last will unspoken
You shadows and demons are fading
Welcome back to real life

Disorder, confusion and disarray
You're fighting against it
Disorder, confusion and disarray
A nameless monster in your head

We are searching while we're breathing
While we're living for a lie in your eyes

Your halo is broken
Your last will unspoken
You shadows and demons are fading
Welcome back to real life
