At a table for two
With a romantic view
He said theres something
That you need to know
I dont usually date
So if i hesitate
It's just that i'm taking it slow

He said, "Darling i dont want to hurt you,"
As he gently reached out for her hand
She laughed, she picked up her menu
And said mister you dont understand

I've been loved, I've been left
I've been wronged by the best
I've had hopes that were shattered in two
I've heard promises spoken
I've had dreams left so broken
There was no chance they'd ever come true
It ain't easy to see
By looking at me
But theres no hell I haven't walked thorugh
If youre worried thats fine
But this heart of mine's
Been broken by better than you

When dinner was done
She said I had fun
As they walked to her door he smiled
He said, "It's only 10 could I come in?
Maybe we could just talk for awhile."
She said, "Honey I know what youre after
And as much as i'd like you to stay
Nothing good ever lasted
When it gets started that way."

I've been loved, I've been left
I've been wronged by the best
I've had hopes that were shattered in two
I've heard promises spoken
I've had dreams left so broken
There was no chance they'd ever come true
It ain't easy to see
But take it from me
There's no hell I haven't walked through
And I won't cross that line
'Cause this heart of mine's
Been broken by better than you

No I won't cross that line
'Cause this heart of mine's
Been broken by better than you
