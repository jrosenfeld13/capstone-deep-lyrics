From the Album: Space
Everybody run from the FBI, pretty woman spots you and walks on by and youre running out of time. Throw a man in jail and hell sin no more. Set a captive free and hell be at your door and hes watching as you soar
Hey it feels right to change your mind from the other side, we dont call shots but weve all tried to cover the shame
Rock your body now till it hits the ground. Hope youll come around and enjoy the sound. Wipe your tears away and stay
Send a boy to space and he will scream out loud, lasso up the moon and well be so proud. And were walking, yeah were walking with the crowd yeah
Hey it feels right to change your mind from the other side we dont call shots but weve all tried to cover the shame
Rock your body now till it hits the ground. Hope youll come around and enjoy the sound. Wipe your tears away and stay
Rock your body now till it hits the ground. Hope youll come around and enjoy the sound. Wipe your tears away and stay
Rock your body now till it hits the ground. Hope youll come around and enjoy the sound. Wipe your tears away and stay
Rock your body now till it hits the ground. Hope youll come around and enjoy the sound. Wipe your tears away and stay yeah yeah
