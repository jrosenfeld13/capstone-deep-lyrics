Caroline's dancing
Petina's at home
They get up every morning
Taking lessons on the phone

Girls that don't talk
Girls that don't talk
Girls that don't talk
Girls that don't talk

Sandra's at school
It's another late night
She comes home quiet
Because her mother's uptight

Girls that don't talk
Girls that don't talk
Girls that don't talk
Girls that don't talk

Girls that don't talk
Still can't see
When they come home from work
I wish they'd talk to me!
