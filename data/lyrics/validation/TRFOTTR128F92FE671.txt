There's a cold wind from Alberta
That carries me on down
From Greenbay to the Port shore
This rig is homeward bound
Nothings gonna stop me
From that boy of mine
It's pedal to the metal
And ridin that red line

(Chorus)
Forty tons of iron
Sixteen hours to go
18 wheels to take me
To the one that I love so
I know he's waiting for me
And looking mighty fine
It's pedal to the metal
And riding that red line

Springfield to St. Louie
Just said goodbye to me
I'm southbound like a nighbird
On the wing and sailing free
The morning light will bring him
I can see him in the view
My hauling days are over
This run is nearly through

(Chorus 2x)
The queen of my destiny
Riding on the wind
I'm heading home again
