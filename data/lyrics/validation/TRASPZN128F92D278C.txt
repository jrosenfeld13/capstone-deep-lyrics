My latest sun is sinking fast my race is nearly run
My strongest trials now are past my triumph has began
Oh come angel band come and around me stand
Oh bear me away on your snowy wings to my imortal home
Oh bear me away on your snowy wings to my imortal home
( steel )
Oh bear my longing heart to him who bled and died for me
Whose blood now cleanse up from all sins and gives me victory
Oh come angel band...
