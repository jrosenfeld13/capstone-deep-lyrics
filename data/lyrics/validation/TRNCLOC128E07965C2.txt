We'll fly you to the promised land

The promised land
We'll fly you to the promised land

The promised land
And the answer will be
When he gives us the key
And the answer will be in the promised land

Come and spread your wings
We'll fly you to the promised land
Hi de hi
De hi
Hope you understand
If you're standing in the queue

He's really gonna like the look of you
Wow

Wow Lord
We'll fly you to the promised land
And I'm tellin' you
Fly to the promised land
