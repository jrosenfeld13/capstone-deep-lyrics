[Intro]
All alone, the broadening skies
Under thee, every night, I lie (every night, I will lie)
Scratch and claw and grip the rails
Every day, my living hell
Oh God, you know I tried
I know how hard I try
You know I tried

[Verse 1]
Hey, I'd like to daze away
To a place no one has known
In a state of mind I could call mine
That only I could own
Where I can hum a tune any time I choose
And there's no such thing as time
Where I feel no pain, just calm and sane
What a place for one to find

[Chorus]
Now, you see
I'm watching everything I do
And they're watching everything I say
So they will leave me be
Whoa, leave me be

[Bridge]
(Sometimes, I gotta ask myself, I said)
Why am I even here?
And I wonder...
You leave me wondering

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Won't you stop watching me?
I said, they're watching me, watching me, watching me, yeah

[Verse 2]
Now, in my corner, I got their stealin' in my eyes, and
And arms holding up my knees
And, man, rocking back and forth's my life
I didn't mean to feel this way
When I walked into the door
And they ripped away my memories
And I can't remember who I was before
Lord, no, Lord, no

[Chorus]
And now, they're watching everything I do
And they're watching everything I say
So they'll leave me be
Oh, leave me be

[Outro]
And I only wanted to be sixteen
And free, yeah

And I wonder...
