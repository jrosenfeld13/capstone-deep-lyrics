A 4-year old at play
Shot and killed today
Never even had a chance
17 and high
Threw away his life
Has a gun to feel like he's a man
Can't have it any other way, no

Laying in the street
Askin' for a drink
Doesn't have a place to live
Pregnant at 13
Still can hear the screams
Something that she never will forget
Can't have it any other way, no

I'm trying, to open my mind
So you can keep your faith
'Cause I'll just walk away
No reason for me to stay
I'm trying to open my mind
I'm trying to make up my mind
