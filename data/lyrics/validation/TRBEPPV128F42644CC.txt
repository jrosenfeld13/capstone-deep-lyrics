I've tried Tequiila, tried Mary-Jane
It got me no-where, it just drove me insane
Single dumb an' stupid, baby, wasn't I a fool?
Ain't nothin' better than lovin' you
Hey!

I've meditated on a single drop of rain
Heard one hand clappin': there was silence in my brain
It showed me somethin', baby, I already knew:
Ain't nothin' better than lovin' you

I been high a time or two
Those days are done:
Now, you're the one I'm turned on to. (Whoo!)
I know, now, what I'm gonna do
The master-plan for this old man is:
Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you

God made your body, baby: he built it well
If He made somethin' better then he kept it for himself
When we get to Heaven, girl, I bet he'll tell you too:
Ain't nothin' better than lovin' you

I been high a time or two
Those days are done:
Now, you're the one I'm turned on to
I know, now, what I'm gonna do
The master-plan for this old man is:
Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you

Instrumental Break

After tryin' everything
I found my life's Venus

I been high a time or two
Those days are done:
Now, you're the one I'm turned on to
I know now, what I'm gonna do
The master-plan for this old man is:
Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you

I been high, yeah, a time or two
Those days are done:
Now, you're the one, girl, I'm turned on to
I know, now, what I'm gonna do
The master-plan for this old man is:
Lovin' you, lovin' you
Oh, lovin' you
