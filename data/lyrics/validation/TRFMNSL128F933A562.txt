The head is a head of a serpent
From its nostrils mucus trickles...
The ears are those of a basilisk
His horns are twisted into three curls

Ea, lord of the depths...

The body is a sun fish, full of stars
The base of his feet are claws
His name is Sassu Wunnu
A sea monster. A form of Ea

Ea, lord of the depths...
