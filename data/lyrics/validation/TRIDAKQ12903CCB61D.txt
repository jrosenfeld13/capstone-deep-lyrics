You said that you would never go away
Through the good bad happy and sad
We we had a love I'll cherish to the end
It's true love that time cannot erase
(Oooh) You you were the only one

Through good bad happy and sad we are

So very very much

Let's turn out the lights
And find ourselves all over again

Sunny days are cloudy days
When you're not here with me
And cloudy days turn into rain
And it's falling down on me
And only you can make it better
Your love serves as the key
For what ills my heart
When things are dark
You're the remedy
