I tried to walk on water
I tried to lead the blind
I couldn't save the mortals
So they were left behind
The cross I bear on my shoulders
The thorns I walk upon
Mine is to do nothing
And even this, I'm doing wrong
I'm around, pray for light
Here I am, we're going down
And darkness rise
'Cause I have killed the light
Judgement day is calling
The sinners stand in line
All the angels have fallen
But I'm just doing fine
The cross I bear on my shoulders
The thorns I walk upon
Mine is to do nothing
And even this, I'm doing wrong
I'm around, pray for light...
