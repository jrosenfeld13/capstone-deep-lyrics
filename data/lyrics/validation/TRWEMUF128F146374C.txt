(lynott)

Lonesome gambler
That woman will lead to heartbreaks
Take the word of one
Who played and lost in love

I played it cool
I dealt the heartaches
I broke rules
But that woman she cut me up

That woman's gonna break your heart
That woman's gonna tear your soul apart
That woman's gonna wreck your head
That woman's gonna leave you sad, so sad

If your life depends
On what you are losing
You're still refusing
To believe in fate or chance

You don't know now
But it's the wrong card you're using
That deck you're using
Is stacked against romance

That woman's gonna break your heart
That woman's gonna tear your soul apart
That woman's gonna wreck your head
That woman's gonna leave you sad, so sad
