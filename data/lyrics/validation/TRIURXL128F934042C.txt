Setzer

Well, it aint everyday that Hepcat gets the blues
Every once in a while, maybe just a week or two

Well, I dont got nothing to worry about
The kids take off and momma screams and shouts
It aint everyday that Hepcat gets the blues
Every once in a while, not very often

Well, they say a man has to work from sun to sun
But a womans work it aint never ever done
If I work my knuckles right down to the bone
You better have that supper at the table at home
It aint everyday that Hepcat gets the blues

When Hepcat gets the blues
Theres nothing nobody can do
The wind starts blowin and the sky gets cloudy and gray
Aint nothing nobody can say
Get on your hands and knees and pray
It aint everyday that Hepcat gets the blues

Here we go
Go ahead Cat

When Hepcat gets the blues
Theres nothing nobody can do
The wind starts blowin and the sky gets cloudy and gray
Aint nothing nobody can say
Get on your hands and knees and pray
It aint everyday that Hepcat gets the blues

You better just hope that I dont come lookin for you
Cause I just dont know exactly what Im bound to do

Im gonna drink Jack Daniels right off the floor
Get a quart of beer and baby holler for more
No, it aint everyday that Hepcat gets
It aint everyday that Hepcat gets
Aint everyday that Hepcat gets the blues
