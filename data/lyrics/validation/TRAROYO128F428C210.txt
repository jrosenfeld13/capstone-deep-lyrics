[Verse 1: Gil Scott-Heron]
Jagged jigsaw pieces
Tossed about the room
I saw my grandma sweeping
With her old straw broom
But she didn't know what she was doing
She could hardly understand
That she was really sweeping up
Pieces of a man

[Verse 2: Gil Scott-Heron]
I saw my daddy meet the mailman
And I heard the mailman say
"Now don't you take this letter to heart now, Jimmy
Cause they've laid off nine others today"
But he didn't know what he was saying
He could hardly understand
That he was only talking to
Pieces of a man

[Verse 3: Gil Scott-Heron]
I saw the thunder and heard the lightning
And felt the burden of his shame
And for some unknown reason
He never turned my way

[Verse 4: Gil Scott-Heron]
Pieces of that letter
Were tossed about that room
And now I hear the sound of sirens
Come knifing through the gloom
But they don't know what they are doing
They could hardly understand
That they're only arresting
Pieces of a man

[Verse 5: Gil Scott-Heron]
I saw him go to pieces
I saw him go to pieces
He was always such a good man
He was always such a strong, strong man
Yeah, I saw him go to pieces
I saw him go to pieces
