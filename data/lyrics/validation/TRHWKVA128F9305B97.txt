Little Rita and her sister Bette
Met some mook who drove a purple Chevy
He took them for a ride one summer night

Told the girls he was a big producer
Truth be told, he was a cheap seducer
They drove up to the hills to see the lights, yeah right

Two days later they were reading him his rights

Woodwork squeaks and out come the freaks y'all
Out come the freaks
Woodwork squeaks and out come the freaks, y'all yeah

Tara Venus was a rent-a-stripper
You can feast your eyes but you couldn't grip her
She went nowhere without Jack the Human Knife

He'd slice you silly if you got too friendly
If you value living better treat her gently
Once she does her sexy cha-cha, let her go

She will tempt you, but it's just part of the show

Woodwork squeaks and out come the freaks
Out come the freaks y'all yeah
Woodwork squeaks and out come the freaks, y'all yeah

Bobby Maggot was a big attorney
Through the courtroom down to hell he journeyed
Bald headed piece of garbage that he was

He'll defend you if your money's honest
Says he'll do his best but that's no promise
Off he goes in his Corvette to get a tan

Oh Lord, I ask You what kind of beast is man?

Woodwork squeaks and out come the freaks
Out come the freaks, out come the freaks y'all
Woodwork squeaks and out come the freaks
Out come the freaks, oh yeah
Woodwork squeaks and out come the freaks

Woodwork squeaks and out comes Trotsky
Out comes Trotsky, yeah oh
Woodwork squeaks and out comes Coltrane
Coltrane, Coltrane, out comes Coltrane

Woodwork squeaks and out comes Che Guevara
Che Guevara, Che Guevara, oh
Woodwork squeaks and out comes the Powell
Buddy Powell, Buddy Powell, yeah
Out come the freaks
