How soft a whisper can get
When you're walking through a crowded space
I hear every word being said
I remember that everyday
I get a little bit closer to you, you

How long an hour can take
When you're staring into open space
When I feel I'm slipping further away
Where I remember that everyday
I get a little bit closer to you, you, to you, you

These are the days that I won't get back
I won't hear you cry or hear you laugh
But when it's quiet and I don't hear a thing
Well I can always hear you breathe

You know there's nowhere else I've wanted to be
Than be there when you needed me
I'm sorry too but don't give up on me
And just remember that when you were asleep
I got a little bit closer to you, you, to you, you

You know there's nowhere else I've wanted to be
Than be there when you needed me
I'm sorry too but don't give up on me
And just remember that when you were asleep
I got a little bit closer to you
