Seize the pipe, offer your life, inhale this obsession
Filling the lungs of minorities youth, coincidental connection?
The sickness spreading, into their lives, free-base infecting
Who will pay for their lives?
The gullible one grabs his gun, sticks it to your head
For a piece of smoking disease,\squeeze the trigger until tour dead
Mind is thrown in disarray, for a vice, unconscious slay
Governmentally induced, no one except yourself to blame
No one to blame, suicide this game
Shell of a man left to wither and die
Deteriorating waste, ignoring his mind's cry
Addiction continues, more population to abuse
MONSTER!
Expanding into your lungs, banish your right of thought
Tasting your foul sorrow, sickening trend of this plot
Is this what your soul commands? How much rock can you smoke?
Easy prey for government plans, take this genocidal toke
Monster!, Monster!, Monster!
