Yes, something of a different pace
Fresh, It's a 97' made taste
Now, I believe the time is right
How, stepping from the left to the right
So get, ready for the rhythm in check
Direct, believe me you ain't heard nothing yet!
I will, volunteer my lyrical skill
Until, the score reaches 50-nil
Go deep, Right into the middle of the beat
It stays sweet, in every way, 7 days a week
Untied, give it to you line by line, the source is the power of the force in the rhyme
It's new, structure of this our unveiling, Go twice around the waters still keep on sailing
Panic, so get confuse I can't shake it, Feel Static, built up by the charge in the break
I can't have it, I need true spirit Reprazenters, a skilled ever ready strong team of inventors
And I got that, that's why my beats sound so pure, 'cos its the format, something you've never heard before!

Do you think that you can hold on, when the beat gets too strong and you feel that you need help to move along
Do you think that you can hang tough, when the rhythm gets rough and the DJ says "I think you've had enough"
Do you think that you can digest, when I start to digress, better get yourself a lyric proof vest!
Do you think that you can compete when you hear the fat beat, you need stamina like an athlete!
Unique, continue the future technique to full heat, let the microphone burn when I speak
Alright, now we're getting into this sound, pick it up, shake it up, turn it upside-down!
