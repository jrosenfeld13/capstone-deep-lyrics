Said it must be hard
It's hard for me, too
And everytime I close my eyes
I'm wishing I'm with you
I know it's just a couple hundred miles
But man I'd kill to see you smile
And hold your hand
And say amen
There goes my girl
There goes my girl
Well she's the one I'd love to love
There goes my girl
Well she's the one I'm thinking of
Said there goes my girl
She had me from hello
There goes my girl
And I ain't ever lettin' go
There goes my girl
Well she's the one I'd love to love
There goes my girl
Well she's the one I'm thinking of
Said there goes my girl
She had me from hello
There goes my girl
And I ain't ever lettin' go
Said it must be hard
'cause it's hard for me too
And every time I close my eyes
I'm wishing I'm with you
I know it's just a couple hundred miles
But man I'd kill to see you smile, baby
And hold your hand
And say amen
There goes my girl
There goes my girl
Well she's the one I'd love to love
There goes my girl
Well she's the one I'm thinking of
Said there goes my girl
She had me from hello
There goes my girl
And I ain't ever lettin' go
