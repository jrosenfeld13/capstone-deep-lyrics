* Originally Part of N.W.A's concert at Arsenal Hall, California 1989

[Intro: MC Ren]
Aiyyo, this is what we want you to do right now
We want y'all to listen up, as we're goin' on somethin' of our Greatest Hits
From Straight Outta Compton, 100 Miles and Running
And our new shit, the greatest shit, Niggas 4 Life..
Just check this shit out..

(*Plane on final approach over Los Angles Airport*)

(*Plane Landing sound and the L.A. Police Sirens Samples started*)

(*Sample of Press Printing Machines*)

GIVE ME MY PASSPORT!!
GIVE ME BACK MY PASSPORT!!

[Eazy-E]
Awww shit, man
Black bitches, black gangsters are at it again

[Dr. Dre]
You are now about to witness, the strength of street knowledge..

[Laylaw as a Narrator]
Straight off the streets of Compton, dedicated and by most suckers hated
Would you put your hands together for.. Eazy-E and N.W.A.? (*Echoes*)

(*Explosion*)

[DJ Yella]
N.W.A's Straight Outta Compton Video banned by M.T.V
N.W.A's music banned by most black Radio Stations
N.W.A. is criticized and for what? - Tellin' it like it is..

[Dr. Dre]
Yo, we ain't sellin' out
Fuck crossing over to them, let them cross over to us

[Ice Cube]
Fuck them!!
Long as motherfuckers still buyin' it, the Media ain't shit (*Echoes*)

[Eazy-E]
Fuck everybody, let's do it
YO DRE, KICK IN THE BASS!!
