Here it comes in judgement
Driving in the nails
Make you feel degraded
How you like to feel

You wait, I take
My fate is in the hand
That's feeding every urge I have

Don't cut me out today
Don't bring me down again
Don't cut me out today
Don't bring me down again

Yeah

Bring me down machete
Anchored to the wall
Make you feel the tension
Breathing in us all

You wait, I take
But never understand
How could I lose a winning hand

Don't cut me out today
Don't bring me down again
Don't cut me out today
Don't cut me out
Cut me out, cut it out

Don't cut me out today
Don't bring me down again, again

Don't cut me out today
Don't cut me out
Don't you try to cut me

Don't cut me out today
Don't cut me out today
Don't cut me out today
