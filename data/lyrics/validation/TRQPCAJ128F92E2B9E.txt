Save us from ourselves again!

Blood of Christ
Sacrifice
God sent his son on a suicide mission

Lazarus
Rise again
Guilty are free thinkers of murdering religion

Blood-lusting clergy
Comatose the parasite
Staring like a zombie into a blinding light

Follow me into the sea
Reverse all evolution
Now the whole world deserves to die!
The whole world deserves to die...

Snake handler
Holy men
Pass around the baskes, buy a ticket to heaven

Misanthropic talent agency
Feed me apathy directly into the blood stream

Oh, I can't find a reason to ever stop digging into my skin
Oh, I can't find a reason to ever stop digging into my inside

Part the clouds and weave a disguise
Walk among the dead as the city breathes fire

Jesus Christ go hide in the sky
You are worth much more dead than alive
The bread is the body, the blood is the wine
Kneel before the virgin as she bleeds from her eyes
Bleeds from her eyes... Bleeds from her eyes... Bleeds from her eyes...

Save us from ourselves again!

Lead the weak to follow a fairy tale
Guilt filled command the obedient herd
Speak up disciple and tell me now
Exactly how he has saved the world

Part the clouds and weave a disguise
Walk among the dead as the city breathes fire

Jesus Christ go hide in the sky
You are worth much more dead than alive
The bread is the body, the blood is the wine
Kneel before the virgin as she bleeds from her eyes

Jesus Christ go hide in the sky
You are worth much more dead than alive
The bread is the body, the blood is the wine
Kneel before the virgin as she bleeds from her eyes
