The pulse of the world when it stopped for a day
From a clear blue sky to a smouldering grey
Unmerciful cruelty
Awakening rudely
Two evils grow
Willingly exhonging blows
Pentagon's financial goals exposed

They were shot from the sky
Duped - anation in pain
Sacrificing lives for financial gain
Unmerciful cruelty
Awakening rudely
Two evils grow
Willingly exhonging blows
Pentagon's financial goals exposed

Out of sight, out of mind
Ground zero - petrified

Paying with their lives
Threatening whose will?
Burning wreckage holes
Time is standing still

Out of sight, out of mind
Ground zero - petrified

Fiendish debates, NATO inflates
Fighting a cause with a biblical fate
Fighting a cause with a biblical fate

Out of sight, out of mind

It ends in tears, distilling fears
Believing the lie when cultures collide
When the cultures collide, when the cultures collide

Out of sight, out of mind
Ground zero - petrified
