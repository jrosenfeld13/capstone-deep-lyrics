Well it looks like I'm a dumb ass, I dropped the ball again
'Cause the woman I love is pissed at me saying this has got to end
Now I tore it up late last night - got way too drunk, it's true
Can I somehow make it up to her? Is there anything I can do?

You've got to tell the girl you're sorry for anything you ever said
Tell the girl you're sorry for making her wish she was dead
Tell the girl your'e sorry for leaving her alone and cold
Tell the girl you're sorry for being such an asshole

So she tells me she's getting really really tired of the crap I tend to pull
Like showing up where she works naked covered in baby oil
Now I'm trying really hard, trying really hard, trying to keep my evil side in check
But sometimes you just gotta kick the cat and deal with what you get

Tell the girl you're sorry for being such a selfish jerk
Tell the girl you're sorry for not caring that the kitty got hurt
Tell the girl you're sorry 'cause the two of you still ain't wed
Tell the girl you're sorry for being such a shit head

I'll say I'm wrong
Will this take long?
No need for you to go on and on
I earn my keep
Just give me peace
I swear I love you
Let me sleep

Now it seems that I must apologize even though I think I'm right
'cause lordy knows, hone, if I don't there will be no nookie tonight
So I slowly turn to the woman I love saying, "baby, baby, baby please"
Then I watch her smile and point to me saying, "Get down on your knees and..."

Tell the girl you're sorry for everything you never said
Tell the girl you're sorry for giving really lousy head
Tell the girl you're sorry for feelings you can never show
Tell the girl you're sorry for being such an asshole
