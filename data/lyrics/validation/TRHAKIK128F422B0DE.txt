[Verse 1]
You're a few years overdue
I spent them waiting here for you
Now your charity's refused
I can name a penance for abuse

[Verse 2]
Twenty-four years overdue
What kind of role model are you?
Very least, learn not to do
I think I might be over you

[Chorus]
Do hope I won't learn to make the same mistakes that you would
Make me aware that only fear
My only hope is letting go

[Verse 3]
I went on a limb for you
Capsized when I turned twenty-two
Did it burn as bad for you?
No bottle serves to soothe my wounds

[Chorus]
Do hope I won't learn to make the same mistakes that you would
Make me aware that only fear
My only hope is letting go
My only hope is letting go

[Outro]
You're a few years overdue
I spent them waiting here for you
