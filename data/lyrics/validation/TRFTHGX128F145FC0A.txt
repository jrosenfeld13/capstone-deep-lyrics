Been floating around up here on cloud 11
I did my best to make it to 27
Open up my eyes and I can see the glory
Now, I'm alive and can tell the story

Now I'm a superstar in the making
I ain't fucking around and there ain't no mistaking
I never ask for something worth the taking
'Cause I'm a superstar, baby

No crying-ass bitching about my wife or girlfriend
'Cause in my life I can't have either one
No crying-ass bitching about my evil parents
They did their best to raise their only son

Now, I'm a superstar in the making
I ain't fucking around and there ain't no mistaking
I never ask for something worth the taking
'Cause I'm a superstar, baby

I'm on the rise, I'm feeling fine, I see it through
I'm on the rise
BOOM! Here come the real motherfuckers from the south

Now, I'm a superstar in the making
I ain't fucking around and there ain't no mistaking
I never ask for something worth the taking
'Cause I'm a superstar, baby
