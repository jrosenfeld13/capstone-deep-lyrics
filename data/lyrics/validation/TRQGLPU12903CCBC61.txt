Harley

Pop paper people printing : 'Rebel Insane'
They in my head and digging into my brain
I need umbrella to keep out of the rain
I can't hope to keep the pace I have made
Maybe I'll settle in the country and fade

It's all too much for me to handle with ease
I'm sinking fast, I'll soon be down on my knees
Dreams of Loretta and Lorraine and Louise
I can't hope to be the 'Devil-May-Care'
Maybe I'll settle with you all in my hair

Broke three f-f-f-fingers last night
Ain't got the energy to fight
They tell me everything's gonna be all right
I can't hope to do more than my best
It's so easy, this is really no test
