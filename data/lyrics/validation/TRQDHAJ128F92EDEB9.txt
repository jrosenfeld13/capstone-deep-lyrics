[Hook]
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know

[Verse 1]
Last night was the worst night
Beginning of the end
Or maybe it began before and here we go again
Things got so dramatic
Things got out of hand
We said words we couldn't imagine
I don't understand

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There you go with the same old thing
When things go wrong you always seem to blame me
Now I would like to find what secrets hide in your mind
Where the end will go?
Will I ever know?
Heaven only knows

[Hook]

Let's make this night the best night
It's time for second chance
Turn the beat up on repeat and we can start to dance
Sometimes when we're talking
Words get drowned out by the sound
Let's get back to touching and we'll get back on solid ground

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Let's hold hands
Like the young romance
Let's first kiss like the moment we first did
Can we make love like way back in the day, love?
We can lose control, baby don't say no
Heaven only knows

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Will you come back to me? Will you come back to me?
Will you come back to me? Will you come back to me?
Will you come back to me? Will you come back to me?
Will you come back to me? Will you come back to me?
Make this night the best night
It's time for second chance
Turn the beat up on repeat and we could start to dance

[Hook]
