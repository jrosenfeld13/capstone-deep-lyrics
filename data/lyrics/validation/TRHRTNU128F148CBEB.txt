Seven times i told you
Seven times in one day
There must be something now we can do about it
So is it maybe, is it can be or never
In the summertime, you're hard to find
You had a little something that you wanted to tell me about
I'll be around, i'm available anytime
Never together, it will never get better
In the summertime, you're hard to find

Ref:
Everyone should grow up with a big brother
Everyone should grow with a real dad
It can only get better
All we gotta do is stick together
Seven times i told you
But ten times if will take
I'm like a hurricane
Forgive me my mistakes
Ohoh no, i've got no reference
I'm not holding the key

I'm disappearing in a hole in the ground
I hear they call you call the girl who knows everything
Listen to them then, forget about me

Ref:
Everyone should grow up with a big brother
Everyone should grow with a real dad
It can only get better
All we gotta do is stick together
When you did say something, i heard nothing
That was on your mind, there was no one listening
You gave up trying, cos i was rejecting
Never look you in the eye, never connecting
It can only get better
All we gotta do is stick together

Ref:
Everyone should grow up with a big brother
Everyone should grow with a real dad
It can only get better
All we gotta do is stick together
