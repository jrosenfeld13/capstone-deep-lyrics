Love's got a hold on my heart...

I'm calling out, won't somebody out there hear my SOS?
Throw me a lifeline please, and save me
Theres no doubt, baby you took me prisoner I confess
When you crossed my defences and captured my heart

And now its too late
To put up a fight
I thought I was strong but as hard as I try
Can't break away
Darling theres no way out
Nothing can help me now
Love's got a hold on my heart

Love's got a hold on my heart...

There's no escape, now I'm like a damsel in distress
Trapped in this fairytale forever
And no mistake, it's tragic but I'll have to face the truth I guess
And live evermore resigned to my fate

'Cos now its too late
To put up a fight
I thought I was strong but try as I might
Can't break away
Darling theres no way out
Nothing can help me now
Loves got a hold on my heart
Yeah yeah
Loves got a hold on my heart

Hold on my heart
Hold on my heart
Loves got a hold on my
Got a hold on my
Heart

And now its too late
To put up a fight
I thought I was strong but try as I might
Can't break away
Darling theres no way out
Nothing can help me now
Loves got a hold on my heart

Can't break away
Darling theres no way out
Nothing can help me now
Loves got a hold on my heart
Oooh oooh
Loves got a hold on my heart
