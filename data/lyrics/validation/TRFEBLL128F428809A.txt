Look at how we set it up
Everytime with nothing wrong
We could go, it's bad enough
I had to lay it down
I had to hang it up
Still hate a lying call
Kinda makes my chest tight up
Don't wanna make that more

Look at how we set it up
Everytime with nothing wrong
We could go, it's bad enough
I had to lay it down
I was right in time
Right in line
Right in time
Right in line

Changed my mind there was something left
But I tried and tried
And I couldn't care that we had some time
I remember fine
Look at how we wasted time
To everything not at all
Tryin to get off that line
I have to pull it down
Got me feelin pretty full

Right in time
Right in line
RIght in time
Right in line

Right in time
I could never make another home
Right in line
Put it where we'd never find it
If I tried and tried
I could find another way
Look now we cry and cry
And the baby's up and ? at you too

Right in time
Right in line
