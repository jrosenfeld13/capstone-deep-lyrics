[Intro: Treach]
Sometimes because of jealousy and the intent to demise
Certain factions have to be forbidden or destroyed
Fire has to be sent to the poisoned forest
With the root of fresh trees planted elsewhere
Only then will you obtain a wilderness
That cannot be penetrated, petrified - family tree

[Chorus]
See what started as a family forest got cut
To a family tree with the limbs and the leaves
Looking' at the world for answers; the world points to the sun
And the sun says the answers in me
So I search through the darkness, can't find the key
So we locked in the land of the lost; Lord, please
Tomorrow ain't promised to you nor me
So now we choose the roots, so we can plant new trees

[Verse 1: Treach]
Many minds always meet with pens and sheets
Close my eyes, think what next on my rhymes, see this face in ink
I'm havin' visions of wisdom, dreamin' 'bout my own ending
Am I seein' death as freedom and livin' as prison
My son didn't have a daddy to shape him
So God bless him with a daddy to save him, Yeah, I raise him
And pay some attention, he talked and he listened
To reach him and teach him fefore I'm gone from existence
Teach him 'bout the foes, the ho's and all opponents
Those that always talk 'bout love but never showed it
Those who had the chances to stand and always blowed it
Those that set you up by the hour to steal your moment
Pac the word is you ain't there so fuck the rumor
I'll get a pound of that shit from Bermuda and meet you in Cuba
Fucked up on Larusa no doubt, I know the locale
If they gotta born you, I'm gonna mourn you 'til I join you

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Vin Rock]
Uhh, and now I know I got some family
Who missed me from the heart, forever we're apart
Just because I'm nothin' and you abuse me and use me
Now you wanna try to go bruise me
And even though maybe we'll end up farther than it once was
I know family don't always mean that they blood, cause
Some people just don't give a nigga what
Some people tried to use my name so all the fat we had to cut
And I'm still walking with my six amp strut
Urban eyes see through camouflage and now I know who's butt
So when I sent you tried to play me, all of a sudden now I'm shady
Maybe deep down in my heart, never trust you from the start
Never hoped you'd be my homie, don't come 'round my way
And if we never speak again, it's got to be that way
This millennium, we'll be spankin' your heiny
Remind thee Naughty invented family of the 90's

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Treach]
Life doesn't end when the sweat dries
A time when a nickle cost a dollar, when you rise, your chest dies
My dynasty many fear it 'cos I'm near it
Ancient Egyptian scriptures fitted in through hyroglyphics
Motherfuckers try to touch my mental state
Niggas smile up in your face and then they infiltrate
So it seems nowadays that the only plan
To get my people help my people get a load of land
And I'ma see it if I have to kill some shit
To make my family tree a motherfucking wilderness
See a black man standin' on the promised land
Since they broke every promise, I devised a plan
This black this and black that crap is gettin' touchy
Any black hat that cross my path, I call him lucky
Those who turn they back with they fears and try to D us
Before they can see us they gonna need a sweet Jesus

[Chorus] x2
