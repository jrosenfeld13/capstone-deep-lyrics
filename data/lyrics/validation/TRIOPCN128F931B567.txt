Crawling by the sea of black tears give your soul to me
My man is gone, betrayed I don't need your sympathy
She is the ruler of this world your know
You're so predictable now giver her your soul
1, 2, 3, 4

Betrayal runnin' through my veins. Hey hey hey
I am in the underworld underworld underworld Hey hey hey
The fear in your eye, I am the lump in your throat
The shiver down your spine, you are so devoted
Come join the army of undead and obscene
She'll give you nothing cauze that's all that you need

Betrayal runnin' through my veins. Hey hey hey
I am in the underworld underworld underworld Hey hey hey
We're in a legend that's brutal hey hey hey

Hey hey hey hey hey Wicked Wonderland, Wicked Wonderland
