If you didn't ask then he wouldn't tell
But the truth is you going through hell
But you hide it so well
You tug on his sleeve
You beg and you plead
Anything so that he won't leave
He would be like oh well (oh well)
And half of the time you knew he was lying
Said he was on his rizzily grind
He's providing so well

And now he's out there running game on you
I'll be there at the drop of a dime
And when he thinks your at home with the kids on the couch watching tv all the time

If you think you're lonely now (ohh baby I'm on my way)
Wait until tonight girl
Cause I'm coming to scoop you up
You got the kinda love
Never get enough of messing bed spreads up
It's all up to you
Wait until tonight girl
If you think you're lonely now (ohh baby I'm on my way)
Wait until tonight girl
And you can be back before he even knows your gone
Take you to the peak of ecstacy... come on
It's all up to you
Wait until tonight girl
Ohh baby I'm on my way

During love makin we lose control of ourselves
Digging in my back with your nails
But you do it so well
And we both fall alseep then your Sidekick beeps
Angry messages he left on your cell
You know he's gonna yell... oh well
Do you think he suspects us
Picked up on the trail
Thinks it's time you sit him down and tell
Cause he knows you so well

And now he's out there running game on you
I'll be there at the drop of a dime
And when he thinks your at home with the kids on the couch watching tv all the time

If you think you're lonely now (ohh baby I'm on my way)
Wait until tonight girl
Cause I'm coming to scoop you up
You got the kinda love
Never get enough of messing bed spreads up
It's all up to you
Wait until tonight girl
If you think you're lonely now (ohh baby I'm on my way)
Wait until tonight girl
And you can be back before he even knows your gone
Take you to the peak of ecstacy... come on
It's all up to
Wait until tonight girl
Ohh baby I'm on my way

For every broken date you promised
For all the lies that you coulda been honest
And for your Sandra she found a Robert
I'll get right there
If you think she's lonely now

For every little dream you sold her
For the night you wasn't at home to hold her
After the drama, here comes the Karma
If you think she's lonely know

If you think you're lonely now (ohh baby I'm on my way)
Wait until tonight
Cause I'm coming to scoop you up
You got the kinda love
Never get enough of messing bed spreads up
It's all up to you
Wait until tonight girl
If you think you're lonely now (ohh baby I'm on my way)
Wait until tonight
And you can be back before he even knows your gone
Take you to the peak of ecstacy... come on
It's all up to you
Ohh baby I'm on my way
