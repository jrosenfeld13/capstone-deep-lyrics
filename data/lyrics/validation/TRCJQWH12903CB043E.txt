Desperate Measures
It's time I had a heart to heart
With this heart of mine
Set it straight if it's not to late
And make it walk the line
She's walkin' out the door
I'm running out of time
Desperat love calls for desperate Measures
I'm gonna have to turn my life around
Or lose her forever
When push comes to shove
Desperate love calls for desperate measures
I'm gonna do what I should have done
Long before today
Set aside my foolish pride
Whatever it may take
Get down on my knees
And beg her Darling, please, please stay
Desperat love calls for desperate Measures...
Desperat love calls for desperate Measures...
Desperat love calls for desperate Measures...
