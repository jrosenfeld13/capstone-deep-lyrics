[Intro]
Someday I'll be next to you

[Verse 1]
Montague and Capulet
Whispered through the wall
Words that they could not forget
After all

Thoughts across this violet sky
Letters to the moon I write, oh
Is our love impossible?
Tell me why

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it wrong for us, oh to love so much?

[Chorus]
Keep the candle burning
Someday I'll be next to you
As long as this world's turning
One day I'll be next to you
Keep the candle burning
(Someday I'll be, someday I'll be)
Someday I'll be next to you
(Someday I'll be next to you)

[Verse 2]
Maybe if I held my ground
Or stood up to authority, oh
Then our love would not be bound
We'd be free

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it wrong for us, oh to feel so much?

[Chorus]
Keep the candle burning
Someday I'll be next to you
As long as this world's turning
One day I'll be next to you
Keep the candle burning
(Someday I'll be, someday I'll be)
Someday I'll be next to you
(Someday I'll be next to you)

[Bridge]
Someday love will carry us
To a place that's made for us

[Chorus]
And oh someday
(Someday I'll be, someday I'll be)
I'll be next to you
(Someday I'll be next to you)
As long as this world's turning
(Someday I'll be next to you)
Someday, someday
(Someday I'll be, someday I'll be)
Keep the candle burning, burning in my heart
As long as this world's turning
Next to you, I'll be next to you
(Someday I'll be next to you)
It's burning in my heart, keep the candle burning
(Someday I'll be, someday I'll be)
Someday I'll be next to you
(Someday I'll be, someday I'll be)
Keep the candle burning
(Someday I'll be yeah, someday I'll be next to you)
