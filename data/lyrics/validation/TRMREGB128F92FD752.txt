Do you remember, my angel
Trees bleeding with your name?
They served your shining halo
When you were standing upon my grave

Do you remember, my angel
Melting snow, stealing your kisses?
Little birds bringing the sun
To your window
To your heart!

Visit me in November night
Like every year
Write a letter that you want me
To lie by your side again

Visit me in November night
Like every year
Write a letter that you want me
To die by my side again

Do you remember my last words?
You didn't want to hear
Now it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter to me

Stay tonight in embrace of darkness!
Stay tonight in embrace of death!
