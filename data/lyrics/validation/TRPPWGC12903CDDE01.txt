Cut long lines!
We are the greatest friends, suffer the pace
We are the great handshake, they cover their faces
We are! we are! we are!

Oh, far away so long...
Come home!
Far away since summer
Oh, far away so long...
Come home!
Far away since summer...gone

Cut, long knives!
We are the great escape, suffer the pace
We are the great handshake, cover their faces
We are the faith's foresake, we are so tight
We are! we are! we are!
