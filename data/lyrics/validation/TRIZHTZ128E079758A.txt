Only this (moment)
Holds us (together)
Close to (perfection)
Nothing else (out there)
No one to (guide us)
Lost in our (senses)
Deep down inside I know our love will die

Only this (moment)
Holds us (together)
Close to (perfection)
Nothing else (out there)
No one to (guide us)
Lost in our (senses)
Deep down inside I know our love will die

Only this (moment)
Holds us (together)
Lost in (confusion)
Feelings are (out there)
Scared of (devotion)
Doubting (intentions)
Deep down inside I know our love will die

Stay or forever go
Play or you'll never know
What heaven decided
You can't deny it's
All you've been waiting for

Stay or forever go
Play or you'll never know
Your spirit's divided
You will decide if I'm
All you've been waiting for

Clouds in my head have been parted with grace
By the voice of an angel revealing her face
And her words they make sense 'n' I do understand
Falling in love isn't part of the plan

Forces within me mix reason with lust, but
I'll try to accept it and not make it worse
'cause I know I might lose it by taking the chance
(But) love without pain isn't really romance

Only this (moment)
Holds us (together)
Close to (perfection)
Nothing else (out there)
Always (beside her)
Trusting my (senses)
Deep down inside I know love will survive

Only this (moment)
Holds us (together)
Close to (the other)
Nothing else (out there)
Always (beside her)
Trusting my (senses)
Deep down inside I know love will survive
