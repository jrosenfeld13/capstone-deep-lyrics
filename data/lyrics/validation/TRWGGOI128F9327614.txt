I wasn't laughing
How could I be laughing?
I swore I'd never smile again
Who said I'm laughing?
After all that's been happening
I swore I'd never smile again
So just cool down and get your butt on the ground
'Cause you're making me nervous, so stop horsing around
You'll be fine, at least half of the time
If not on the surface, well then at least in your mind

And just because no one else can feel
The things you've always held for real
It doesn't mean we don't love you
In every truth you'll find a sin
Learn to take it, take it in
But never say we don't love you
