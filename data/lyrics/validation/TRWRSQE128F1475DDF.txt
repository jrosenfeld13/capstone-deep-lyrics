Love doesn't last
Love grows cold
Love doesn't last
Break my heart, I sing my song

And love doesn't last
Oh love doesn't last
Ah love doesn't last
Love doesn't last

I don't trust love
I don't trust love
Love grows cold
Break my heart, I sing my song

And love doesn't last
Oh love doesn't last
Ah love doesn't last
Love doesn't last

I love someone, she breaks my heart
I love someone oh
Love grows cold, love doesn't last
She breaks my heart, I sing my song
