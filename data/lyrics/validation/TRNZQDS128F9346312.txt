[Verse 1]
You better stop playin' games
I told you once before
It'll hurt you more this time
If you walk out that door

[Chorus]
You'd better think it over (baby)
Remember what I told you (baby)
'Cause never again
(Never again, never again)
Will I love you this way
(Never again, never again)

[Verse 2]
I've learned a little more
Each time I took you back
You made a fool of me
I'll tell you where it's at

[Chorus]
You'd better think it over (baby)
You walk out and it's over (baby)
'Cause never again
Will I love you this way
(Never again, never again)

[Bridge]
Love can't be this way
(You cheated, you lied)
Gets worse day by day
(You cheated, you lied)
I'm sick and tired of the nights that I've been cryin'
I can't go on knowing that you're untrue

[Verse 3]
You've had your last chance now
I'm walkin' out that door
And I'm not playing games
Don't want you anymore

[Chorus]
You'd better think it over (baby, baby)
This girl is gone forever (baby, baby)
'Cause never again
(Never again, never again)
Will I ever love you
(Never again, never again)

[Outro]
Will I ever love you
(Never again, never again)
Will I ever love you
(Never again, never again)
