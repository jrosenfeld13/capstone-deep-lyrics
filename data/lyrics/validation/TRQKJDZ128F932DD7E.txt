[Hook]
(White Lines) Visions, dreams of passion
(Blowing through my mind) And all the while I think of you
(High price) A very strange reaction
(For us to unwind) The more I see, the more I do
(Something like a phenomenon) Baby!
(Telling your body to come along, but white lines blow away)
(Blow! Rock it! Blow!)

[Verse 1]
Ticket to ride, white line highway
Tell all your friends, they can go my way
Pay your toll, sell your soul
Pound-for-pound costs more than gold
The longer you stay, the more you pay
Buy white line, go a long way
Either up your nose or through your vein
With nothing to gain except killing your brain

[Hook]
(Freeze! Rock! Freeze! Rock! Freeze! Rock! Freeze! Rock!)

Higher, baby
Get higher, baby!
Get higher, baby!
And don't ever come down! (Freebase!)

Rang dang diggedy dang di-dang
Diggedy dang di-dang diggedy dang di-dang

(Pipeline) pure as the driven snow
(Connected to my mind) and now I'm having fun, baby!
(High price) it's getting kinda low
(Cause it makes you feel so nice) I need some one-on-one, baby!
(Don't let it blow your mind away) Baby!
(And go into your little hideaway cause white lines blow away)
(Blow! Rock it! Blow!)

[Verse 2]
A million magic crystals, painted pure and white
A multi-million dollars almost overnight
Twice as sweet as sugar
Twice as bitter as salt
And if you get hooked, baby
It's nobody else's fault, so don't do it!

[Hook]
(Freeze! Rock! Freeze! Rock! Freeze! Rock! Freeze! Rock!)

(Ahhh) Higher, baby
(Ahhh) Get higher, baby!
(Ahhh) Get higher, baby!
And don't ever come down! (Freebase!)

(Dont you get too high) dont you get too high baby!
(Turns you on) you really turn me on and on
(Cause you gotta come down) my temperature is risin
(When the thrill is gone) no, I dont want you to go

[Verse 3]
A street kid gets arrested, gonna do some time
He got out three years from now just to commit more crime
A businessman is caught with 24 kilos
Hes out on bail and out of jail
And thats the way it goes, raah!

(Cane! Sugar! Cane! Sugar! Cane!)

Athletes rejected, governerds corrected
Gangsters, thugs and smugglers are thoroughly respected
The money gets divided
The women get excited
Now Im broke and its no joke
Its hard as hell to fight it, dont buy it!

[Hook]

Little Jack Horner sitting on the corner
With no shoes and clothes
This ain't funny, but he took his money
And sniffed it up his nose

(Hey man, you wanna cop some blow?)
(Sure, what you got, dust, flakes or rocks?)
(I got China White, Mother of Pearl, Ivory Flake, What you need?)
(Well yeah, well let me check it out man, just let me get a freeze)
(Go ahead man, stuff I got should kill ya!)
(Yeah man th-thats thats raw, woah..)
