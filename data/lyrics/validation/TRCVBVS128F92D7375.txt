Got a message from the wind today
When it blew a tear across my face
It said its time to turn and go its way
Guess its time Im movin on

Saw a bird sail the breeze that blows
Across the ridge the way I need to go
It took this much of my life to know
Ill probably never find a home

A wanderin life is what I have
Comin in and headin out
The urge to go is in my blood to stay
The wind is startin to pick up today

Mightve had what I left to find
In the place that I left behind
But a different breeze was blowin in my mind
And it just would not let me see

Now Im standin here but its just not the same
I guess the only thing I know is change
The winds a-startin to blow again
Guess its time for me to leave

A wanderin life is what I have
Comin in and headin out
The urge to go is in my blood to stay
Ill probably never know another way
The wind is startin to pick up today
