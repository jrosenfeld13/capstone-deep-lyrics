(Jay Booker)
(Track 10 - Time 4:00)

Gimme a river and a cypress tree
A day of good weather, and I will be
As happy as a little green frog in the rain
Gimme a shellcracker on the line
Deep fried potatoes, and a homemade wine
And a woman to work it off later and cry my name
It don't take much, it don't take much
It don't take much to please
A redneck like me

Gimme a truck with four good tires
A cheap Have-A-Tampa, and my desires
Will not exceed the limits of my means
I don't need no Porsche car
No pumped-up music or a whacked-out bar
No ghost-white chicky, dressed up like a bad, black dream
It don't take much, it don't take much
It don't take much to please
A redneck like me

I have seen it all in my life
Running up and down the road in overdrive
But now the time has come to take it easy
It don't take much, it don't take much
It don't take much to please
A redneck like me
A redneck like me
A redneck like me
