You're in my blood
I can't help but love you
Don't pull away
I tell you that I love you
Am I cursed to walk this earth without you?
You're in my blood
Now I can't live without you
Just take my hand
I can't go no place without you
Come a little bit closer
I tell you that I love you
Am I the one?
I'll never ever hurt you
Give me your love
I'm saying that I love you
Through the dark nights
How we loved
Now I can't live without you
I wanna look and I wanna touch
Ooh! I must be dreaming
Ooh! I must be dreaming
Just take my hand
I can't go no place without you
Come a little bit closer
I tell you that I love you
Am I the one?
I'll never ever hurt you
Give me your love
I'm saying that I love you
Through the dark nights
How we loved
Now I can't live without you
I wanna look and I wanna touch
Ooh! I must be dreaming
Ooh! I must be dreaming
You're in my blood
I can't help but love you
Don't pull away
I tell you that I love you
Am I cursed to walk this earth without you?
You're in my blood
Now I can't live without you
Through the dark nights
How we loved
Now I can't live without you
I wanna look and I wanna touch
Ooh! I must be dreaming
Ooh! I must be dreaming
