Somewhere out there in the vast nothingness of spa-a-a-a-a-a-a-a...
Space
A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a...
Time
A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a...
Somewhere out there in the vast nothingness of spa-a-a-a-a-a-a-a...
Space and time
Somewhere out there in the vast nothingness of space
Somewhere far away in space and time
Staring upward at the gleaming stars in the obsidian sky
We're marooned on a small island, in an endless sea
Confined to a tiny spit of sand, unable to escape
But tonight, on this small planet, on Earth
We're going to rock civilization...
Somewhere out there in the vast nothingness of spa-a-a-a-a-a-a-a...
Space
Time
Space and time
Somewhere out there in the vast nothingness of spa-a-a-a-a-a-a-a...
Space
A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a...
Time
A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a...
Somewhere out there in the vast nothingness of spa-a-a-a-a-a-a-a...
Space and time
