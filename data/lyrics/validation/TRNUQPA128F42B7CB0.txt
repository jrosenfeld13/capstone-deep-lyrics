Painted pictures, 2 am driftings
The sound of the rain
Candles shift the walls, moving sharply
What's left to explain

When you told me you ought to be going
I could sense how the night was exploding

If I told you that I noticed
If I told you this for certain
You'd see me as scarred
Your eyes so strained, so innocent
In a sense it's the way we both are

So don't show me the home you've recaptured don't remind me, I was there when it shattered each time I returned to the ocean
I walked on the cold sandand it taught me

To float, like a bird across the sky
Watching all the moments ease by
Feeling close enough to try

In the darkness in a shadow
In the places only I know
I run from the rain
My eyes so wide so desperate
To pull light from the pain

So don't show me I learned my own balance don't remind me, my whole world
Was challenged
Each time I return to the ocean
I close my eyes, I listen

I float, like a bird across the sky
Watching all the moments ease by
Feeling close enough to try
Close enough this time

In this strange place
There's no direction to guide us around
The ones that move slowly
Keep to the ground
And in some distant time
When your reflection
Appears a stranger from some other day
I'll know what you're thinking
I'll feel the same way

I float, like a bird across the sky
Time and time again I know why
I feel close enough to try

I close my eyes and

Float, across the sky
Watching as the moments ease by
So close, close enough to try
