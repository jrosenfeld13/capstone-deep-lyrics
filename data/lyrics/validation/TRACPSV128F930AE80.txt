She sleep in the rivers bed, drunk of her sadness
Her head head the dwelling of deepest torment, of deepest lament
Caressing the water like ice, she shakes her head until
Her spirit finds the reason of her fright
The words you meant to tell will never be
Your dreaming of violence with secret the ocean has the key
The evil hand hangs on your ship
"We're so diffrent, when I'm cold an silent
Your're setting a fire to dry your heart"
They're jumping an dancing and loving and kissing on an on
They're dying and bleeding and hating and sighing on an on
"I take back my trust in you, I take my trust in you"
She swims in the rivers bed, posessed by her feelings
The moon fades in the gloomy expense that dreft her naked skin

Caressing like marsh, she journs her hands until
Her body finds the reason of her thrill
The words you meant to tell will never be
You're diving in silence like a mermaid in the dreary sea
The evil hands inside of him
"We're so diffrent, when I'm cold an silent
Your're setting a fire to dry your heart"
They're jumping an dancing and loving and kissing on an on
They're dying and bleeding and hating and sighing on an on
"I take back my trust in you, I take my trust in you"
She died in the rivers bed, drowned by her sorrow
The waves carried her body in shreds, her soul will follow
An the words he meant to tell will never be
He's diving with sadness in unknown, dark and spellbound seas
The fading moon will shine on him
