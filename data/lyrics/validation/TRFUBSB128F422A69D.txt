Swimming in a pool of sharks
Diving in a sea of snakes
Oh, I'm going insane

The needle still injects my blood
A blazing pain, a burning flood
I'm nailed to the cross

Consequences melting down reality
My face turns black
I'm off the radar screen

Inside of a demon - he said: burn, burn, burn
The mind of a devil - like a rollercoaster
Inside of a demon - he said: burn, burn, burn
In need of an angel to protect me from myself

Standing in the line of fire
Running through the fields of war
When my hope's been stolen now

Please help me
Mend my broken wings
I have no hope
But still believe
Before I lose my faith

No evidence remains
When I will fly away
I've disappeared
I'm off the radar screen

Inside of a demon - he said: burn, burn, burn
The mind of a devil - like a rollercoaster
Inside of a demon - he said: burn, burn, burn
In need of an angel to protect me from myself
