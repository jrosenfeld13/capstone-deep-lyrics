These were the words of the wounded man
He came to me, you should understand
And he's coming to you, all the way
From the hardest place
Through the hardest days

"Out on the roads of that winding plain
I took her in, took her all I had
Understanding everything
But her coldest eye
Should have changed my mind"

So then he rose, and he rubbed his eyes
Crawled through a hole in a lake of ice
Just to show you, all the way
Though the queen has died
She has multiplied
