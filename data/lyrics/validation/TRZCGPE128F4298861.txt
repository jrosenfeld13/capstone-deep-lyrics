Oh little girl
What have we done
One of us came undone
Which one

Lost in the moment
My despair
Maybe we just don't care
I care

Put it on me
But maybe not this much
It happened with just one touch
The devil in you I trust

Caught it on your face I know it's true
Every time you look at me
This is not a place for me and you
Every time you look at me

Living in a dream that I wake up
Wondering where I'm going to
But it's true when I do I see you
Loaded like a gun

Oh little girl
Where will we go
One of us got to know
There when I told you so

You let me feel
The place of my regret
Hearing you call my name
Tomorrow lies in pain
Far away

Caught it on your face I know it's true
Every time you look at me
This is not a place for me and you
Every time you look at me

Living in a dream that I wake up
Wondering where I'm going to
But it's true when I do I see you
Loaded like a gun

Every time you look at me

Call my number (loaded like a gun)
Make me weak (loaded like a gun)
You're like thunder (loaded like a gun)
Skip a beat (loaded like a gun)

How the steel went through me
From a loaded gun
Knowing I could break if you were the only one

I can feel you almost there but it's plain to see
Going down so easily
I want you to look at me
Far away

Caught it on her face I know it's true
Every time you look at me
This is not a place for me and you
Every time you look at me

Living in a dream that I wake up
Wondering where I'm going to
But it's true when I do I see you
Loaded like a gun

Every time you look at me
Every time you look at me
