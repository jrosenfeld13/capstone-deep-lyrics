Darling, why you look so sad
Has this place got you anxious
Trust me, it's not you
I've been wondering for days
How to make them go away
There's just one thing to do

Let's go go go before a normal reaction
Gets us in trouble all over now
And I won't won't won't ever let them hurt you
Never again, love, all over now
Oh, it's just a dream

This night's enough to make me weep
And the company you keep
They don't seem to have a plan
Darling it is almost morning
This is our last warning
Let's get out while we can

Let's go go go before a normal reaction
Gets us in trouble all over now
Darling stay close to me
And I won't won't won't ever let them hurt you
Never again, love, all over now
Oh, it's just a dream

Party's over now
Party's over now

So let's go go go before a normal reaction
Gets us in trouble all over now
Darling stay close to me (party's over)
And I won't won't won't ever let them hurt you
Never again, love, all over now
Oh, it's just a dream
