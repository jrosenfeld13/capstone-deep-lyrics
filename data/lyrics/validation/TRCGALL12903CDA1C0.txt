Let go of the fear
Let go of the fear
Let go of the fear

Let go of the fear
Let go of the fear
Let go of the fear

Your covenant to thoughts could bide you
To an abyss that offers you truth
Hold close the ideals that define you
Reality exists--what is blind too
Release is a cocaine fury
And Mother's little helper
Reality can fool no one
Disguises are forms of shelter

The terror, the emptiness of silence
This paint, this safety used to hide us
Actively working on those defilements
As you turn to the path of the decepted

Reality should be defiled

Let go of the fear
Let go of the fear
Let go of the fear

Ahh

Let go of the fear (let go of the fear)

Let go of the fear (let go of the fear)
Let go of the fear (let go of the fear)

Ahh

Release is a cocaine fury
And Mother's little helper
Reality can fool no one
Disguises are forms of shelter
The terror and emptiness of silence
This paint, this safety used to hide us
Actively working on those defilements
As you turn to the path of the decepted

Ahh

Let go of the fear
Let go of the fear
Let go of the fear

Ahh

Let go of the fear (let go of the fear)
Let go of the fear (let go of the fear)
Let go of the fear (let go of the fear)

Ahh
