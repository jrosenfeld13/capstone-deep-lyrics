I thought I met a man
Who said he knew a man
Who knew what was going on

I was mistaken
Only another stranger
That I knew

And I thought that I'd found a light
To guide me through
My night and all this darkness

I was mistaken
Only reflections of a shadow
That I saw

And I thought I've seen someone
Who seemed at last
To know the truth

I was mistaken
Only a child laughing
In the sun
