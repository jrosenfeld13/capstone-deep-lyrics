No, I won't, foretold coast to coast, footloose scenarios can't break my fame, maintain, trade, meditate, all hours can't wide, operate straight from this place I say, tall words, we'll stop to where I foretold to give or I will stop to drop what was still, I stop to clutch my blood, fucked up thoughts turned the plot

Cut much, caught up, tossed enough, got it rough, thinking much about staying above, the dust fit into battle, handle cheap shots, respond or be gone beyond this Babylon, con, I've hurt worse than this, turn it into new purposes, heard nervousness brings curses, it will take more than your amount to house my count so bounce, I hold it down catchin' a bad one, catchin' a bad one, catchin' a bad one, catchin' a bad one, test of my heart

Can't believe it's happening again, all this hasn't convinced to the transcend, this can't be forced out of me, that familiar push can strain my energy, can you be here to challenge my fate, if so you can't be stronger than predestined days, force me in a corner and we'll both lose, the value of this is far beyond me or you
Me
Or you

Love, test of my heart
