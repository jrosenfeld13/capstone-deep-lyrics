There's a wind that blows
On the southern sea
And it whirls around
Deep inside of me
Always bringing me up
Never letting me down
I had a dream I was on my way
To Bridgetown

I've seen ships that sail
Each and every day
And when they start up their engines

They steal my heart away

Barbados
I'm another one born to run
Barbados
I need another sweet taste of rum
I been sailing on this raging sea
The higher the venture
The better I'll be
Barbados
