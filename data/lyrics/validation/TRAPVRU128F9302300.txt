When push comes to shove, it pours down from up above
But you painfully pursuit your point of view

The once up turns to down, it comes on from all around
But you blissfully insist to take the risk

It's all or nothing - with your back against the wall
It's all or nothing - you better learn to take a fall

The last lucky touch, all fingers digging dust
While you ritually admit you can't quit

One hand deals the blow, the other the undertow
And you righteously deny it's do or die

It's all or nothing - with your back against the wall
It's all or nothing - you better learn to take a fall

Twice upon a long ago, still seeping from down below
So you beautifully concede to be naive

A blood line in the sand, lost grip on the upper hand
With a bitter sweet goodbye, you cross the line
