[Verse 1]
Lost in the high street, where the dogs run
Roaming suburban boys
Mother's got her hairdo to be done
She says they're too old for toys
Stood by the bus stop with a felt pen
In this suburban hell
And in the distance a police car
To break the suburban spell

[Chorus]
Let's take a ride
Run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia
You can't hide
Run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia

[Verse 2]
Break the window by the town hall
Listen! The siren screams
There in the distance like a roll call
Of all the suburban dreams

[Chorus]
Let's take a ride
Run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia
You can't hide
Run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia

[Bridge]
I only wanted something else to do but hang around
I only wanted something else to do but hang around

[Chorus]
Let's take a ride
Run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia
You can't hide
Run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia

[Verse 3]
It's on the front page of the papers
This is their hour of need
Where's a policeman when you need one
To blame the colour TV?

[Chorus - Variation]
Let's take a ride
And run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia
You can't hide
Run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia
In suburbia
In suburbia

Run with the dogs tonight
You can't hide
Let's take a ride
Run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia
You can't hide
Run with the dogs tonight
In suburbia
