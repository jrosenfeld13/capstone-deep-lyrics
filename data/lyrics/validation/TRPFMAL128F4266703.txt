[Verse 1:]
Mother please forgive them
For they know not what they do
Looking back in history's books
It seems it's nothing new
Oh, let my mother live

Heaven is for heroes
And hell is full of fools
Stupidity, no will to live
They're breaking God's own rules
Please let my mother live

Father of all creation
I think we're all going wrong
The path they're taking
Seems to be breaking
And it won't take too long
Children of the future
Watching empires fall
Madness, the cup they drink from
Self destruction, the toll

I had a vision, l saw the world burn
And the seas had turned red
The sun had fallen, the final curtain
In the land of the dead
Mother, please show the children
Before it's too late
To fight each other, there's no one winning
We must fight all the hate
