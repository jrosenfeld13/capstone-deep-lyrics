Even the strong can get weak

I'm ashamed to say I followed you today
Stood so far away
But somehow I just knew you knew that I was watching you
You gave that silly grin the one that pulled me in
It's got to be a sin
That I just can't face the facts that you're not coming back
Just count me with the lonely
Go ahead count me with the one's that truly
Truly won't admit that you gotta quit before the fire starts and scars
Scars you back again but it pulls you in

'Cause still the waters run deep
Emotions run high
And I pray I'm over you by and by
Still the waters run deep
My tears barely dry
And my mind works in rewind and repeat
Still the waters run deep

I went out for the night thought I be all right
I met up with a man
He hung on to my every thought said you've been through alot
He turned to say goodbye said he couldn't lie
He wished he'd been the guy the lucky one who met me before
He could have given me more
He said just count me with the lonely
Go ahead and count me with the one's who are always last in line
Just filling up the time
Girl your gonna be fine but you will never be mine

'Cause still your waters run deep
Emotions run high
I think I'll be over this by and by
Still the waters run deep
My tears barely dry
And my mind works in rewind and repeat
Still the waters run deep

So deep So deep
The waters run deep
I feel, I feel it
So deep So deep
Even the strong can get weak
Still the waters run deep

Still the waters run deep
Emotions run high
And I pray I'm over you by and by
Still the waters run deep
My tears barely dry
And my mind works in rewind and repeat
Still the waters run deep

Still the waters run deep
Emotions run high
My heart skips a beat
Still the waters run deep
My tears barely dry
And my mind works in rewind and repeat
Still the waters run deep
My heart works in rewind and then repeat
Still the waters run deep

Rewind,Rewind and Repeat
