Let's not be the ones outside
Looking at the world go by
Saw you standing all alone

Wasted time has gone for good
Play no more, its understood
Come to the twilight zone

Let me feel your secret hand
Like a feather on the sand
Only made of gold

You can make me feel a king
And surrender everything
A fire can't control

REFRAIN:
Hold me in your arms again
Strangers down a lonely lane
We can still survive
Driftwood on the stream of life

Hold me in your arms again
Let me touch your velvet skin
No more lonely nights
On the way of no return

Play me the bolero

See your mystery in your eyes
And the emotion in your lies
I feel the magic in your touch
'cause the wanting is too much

Hold me in your arms again
Strangers down a lonely lane
We can still survive
Driftwood on the stream of life

Hold me in your arms again
Let me touch your velvet skin
No more lonely nights
On the way of no return

Play me the bolero
My bolero

Hold me in your arms again
Strangers down a lonely lane
We can still survive
Driftwood on the stream of life
Hold me in your arms again
