I miss you most on winter mornings
As we drift, we sleep through evenings, oh
We drive into the cold and dark with fingers crossed
I follow your eyes to avoid from getting lost

[Chorus]
And all I had was the memory of what was
So let's pretend it never mattered to us
I hope this message finds you well
Never thought I'd live to tell

Just to survive we do what we can
We read the maps and signs
And we make the plans by our design
I write it down to get me by the worst time in my life

[Chorus]
And all I had was the memory of what was
So let's pretend it never mattered to us
I hope this message finds you well
Never thought I'd live to tell
What's a dream and what is real
The way I really feel

I hope this message finds you well
I never thought I'd live to tell
What's a dream and what is real

So let's pretend this is the ending
To the message Ive been sending, sending

[Chorus]
And all I had was the memory of what was
So let's pretend it never mattered to us
I hope this message finds you well
Never thought I'd live to tell
What's a dream and what is real
The way I really feel
I hope this message finds you well
Never thought I'd live to tell
What's a dream and what is real
The way I really feel
