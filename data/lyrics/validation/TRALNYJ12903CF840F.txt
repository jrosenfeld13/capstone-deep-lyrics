When trouble is in my way
I can't tell my night from day
That I'm tossed from side to side
Like a ship out on a ragin' tide
I don't worry, I don't fret
My God has never failed me yet
Troubles come from time to time
But that's alright I'm not the worryin' kind

Because, I've got confidence
God is gonna see me through
No matter what the case may be
I know He's gonna fix it for me
I've got confidence
God is gonna see me through
No matter what the case may be
I know He's gonna fix it for me

Job was sick so long
Till the flesh fell from his bones
His wife, cattle and children
Everything he had was gone
But Job with his despair
He knew that God still cared
Sleepless days and sleepless nights
But Job said that's alright

Because, I've got confidence
God is gonna see me through
No matter what the case may be
I know He's gonna fix it for me
I've got confidence
God is gonna see me through
No matter what the case may be
I know He's gonna fix it for me

Mmmm, some people wonder how I smile
Even when I'm goin' through trials
They say, Andrae, how can you have a song
When everything is goin' wrong?
But I don't worry, I don't fret
My God never failed me yet
Troubles come from time to time
But that's alright, I'm not the worryin' kind

Cause, I've got confidence
God is gonna see me through
No matter what the case may be
I know He's gonna fix it for me
I've got confidence
God is gonna see me through
No matter what the case may be
I know He's gonna fix it for me
