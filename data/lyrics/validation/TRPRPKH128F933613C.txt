I was alone, I took a ride, I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could find another kind of mind there
Ooo, then I suddenly see you
Ooo, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

You didn't run, you didn't lie, you know I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone, you knew in time we'd meet again for I had told you
Ooo, you were meant to be near me
Ooo, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day
Got to get you into my life

What can I do, what can I be, when I'm with you I want to stay there
If I'm true I'll never leave and if I do I know the way there
Ooo, then I suddenly see you
Ooo, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life
Got to get you into my life, got to get you into my life

I was alone, I took a ride, I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could find another kind of mind there
Ooo, you know I need my baby
Ooo,you know I need my baby
Don't say "I'll see you"
Did I tell you that I need you
Every single day
