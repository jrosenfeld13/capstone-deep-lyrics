Every night I go to bed
Fall on my knees and I pray
For my love
Although he doesn't love me
He can stay just for me
I pray
He used to love me with all his heart n'soul
I always stayed with him just like he was a toy
And so I know it just didn't pay
To kiss, my love, and break, his heart, and try to run away
Why, oh why, does he hurt me so?
I hold on, never thought he'd ever go
Every night
Every night, ouuu huu ouuuuu
Every night, ouuu huu ouuuuu
