Why do you go on pretending
You know you want to be free
Darling, you know I'll let you go
You'd do the same for me

I understand
And darling, you are not to blame
If when we kiss it's not the same
I understand
It's not your fault because your heart has changed it's mind
You didn't mean to be unkind
I understand
Forgetting you will be far from easy
I've grown so used to your charms
I'll miss that old thrill and no one can fill
The place here in my arms
But if you find our love was really meant to be
Then darling, hurry back to me
And I'll understand

I understand
And darling, you are not to blame
If when we kiss it's not the same
I understand
It's not your fault because your heart has changed it's mind
You didn't mean to be unkind
I understand
Forgetting you will be far from easy
I've grown so used to your charms
I'll miss that old thrill and no one can fill
The place here in my arms
But if you find our love was really meant to be
Then darling, hurry back to me
