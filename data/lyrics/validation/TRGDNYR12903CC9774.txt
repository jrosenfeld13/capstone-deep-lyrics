(Verse)
[JO]
Ding, dong
Ding, dong
Do you hear the bells go
Ding, dong?
Do you know
Do you know why they're ringing?
Do you know
Why the birds are singing
Well, you're gonna get a big surprise
'Cause I'm gonna put you wise

(Chorus)
[JO]
The bells are ringing
For me and my gal
The birds are singing
For me and my gal
Everybody's been knowing
To a wedding they're going
And for weeks they've been sewing
Every Susie and Sal
They're congregating

[HARRY]
There's the church!

[JO]
For me and my gal

[HARRY]
And there's the steeple

[JO]
The parson's waiting

[HARRY]
Open the door

[JO]
For me and my gal

[HARRY]
And there's the people

[JO]
And sometime we're gonna build a little home
For two or three or four or more
In Loveland for me and my gal

(Chorus 2)
[HARRY AND JO]
The bells are ringing
For me and my gal
The birds are singing
For me and my gal
Everybody's been knowing
To a wedding they're going
And for weeks they've been sewing
They've been sewing something old and something new so
Something that is blue so
They can make a trousseau
For my gal
They're congregating
For me and my gal
Look here, why, that's the parson waiting
For me and my gal
And sometime we're gonna build a little home

[HARRY]
For two

[JO]
Or three

[HARRY]
Or four

[JO]
Or five

[HARRY]
Or maybe more

[HARRY AND JO]
Loveland for me and my gal

(dance break)

[HARRY]
Here comes that Loveland again

[HARRY AND JO]
In Loveland for me and my gal
