[Verse 1]
I ain't got no tuxedo
I don't know what fork to hold
She asked me to a dance
Where they wear fancy pants
Don't like me the way I am
Go suck some spam

[Chorus]
Ain't high falutin'
Little bit crazy
Ain't high falutin'
Pull my daisy

[Verse 2]
Her dad hates me at the front door
'Cause I blew my nose on the floor
I ask him how it be
Down at the sock factory
He said, "Boy, what's that smell?"
I said, "Muscatel!"

[Chorus]
Ain't high falutin'
Little bit crazy
Ain't high falutin'
Pull my daisy

[Verse 3]
The sign on the door says there's a dress code
The band sounds like Depeche Mode
Let's get out of here
Get ourselves a beer
Wanna be unzippin'
Let's go skinny-dippin'

[Chorus]
Ain't high falutin'
Little bit crazy
Ain't high falutin'
Pull my daisy

[Outro]
I said I ain't, I ain't, I ain't, I ain't, I ain't high falutin'
I said I ain't, I ain't, I ain't, I ain't, I ain't high falutin'
