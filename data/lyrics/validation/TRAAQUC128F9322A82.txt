We must fight
The good fight
Changing wrongs to rights

Like malcolm x -
Kissed off his slave name
Kissed off his masters god
Raised his fist in righteous rage

And dr. king doesnt rest in peace
Due to the spread of this disease

The clock
Has struck thirteen
For all us pups in centerville -

Cause this triage
Ain't no solution
Heaven help the man who can't sing or dance

Who cast the stone at wwii
Bout the good neighbor turnin on the jew -
When time will recall us in the same breath
You and me?

Fight the good fight

The scope gun of indifference
Is trained on our souls

The gravespin of heroes
Seeds the cloud with dust and blood

Not buried deep enough
To distance the thunder of truth

Bullys are cowards naturally
Spin on one and sink your knee
Right the wrongs of history

Fight the good fight

The scope gun of indifference
Is trained on our souls
Whoo-hoo-hoo

The gravespin of heroes
Sees the clouds of dust and blood

Not buried deep enough
Better bullet-proof your boy
