[Verse 1]
Poison Oak, some boyhood bravery
When our telephone was a tin can on a string
And I fell asleep with you still talking to me
You said you weren't afraid to die

In polaroids, you were dressed in women's clothes
Were you made ashamed, why'd you lock them in a drawer?
Well, I don't think I've ever loved you more ...

[Chorus]
Than when you turned away
When you slammed the door
When you stole the car
And drove towards Mexico

And you wrote bad checks
Just to fill your arm
I was young enough
I still believed in war

[Verse 2]
Well let the poets cry
Themselves to sleep
And all their tearful words
Would turn back into steam

But me I'm a single cell
On a serpent's tongue
There is muddy field
Where a garden was
And I'm glad you got away
But I'm still stuck out here
My clothes are soaking wet
From your brother's tears

[Bridge]
And I, Never thought
This life was possible
You're the, Yellow bird
I've been waiting for

The end of Paralysis
I was a statuette
Now I'm drunk as hell
On a piano bench
And when I press the keys
It all gets reversed
The sound of loneliness
Makes me happier
