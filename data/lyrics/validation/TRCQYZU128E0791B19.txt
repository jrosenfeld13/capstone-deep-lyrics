I know that the earth is rotten
And I know the whole world's corrupt
Some say that there's really no hope
Some say that our time is up

(But you know)
I found out
There's a small speck of human kindness
Buried very deep in everyone
And I've no doubts, Time's gonna change

Sometimes, I know that you say you hate me
Sometimes, I know that I say we're through
Some say, we're not right together
But I know what I have to do
Listen to me

I found out
That there's no one else that I could ever live with
Let's forget about the past
And I've no doubts, our love will last
(reason to shout - calling your name)
I found out
Hear what I'm talking about
(things gonna change)
I found out

In the grand scheme of things
We're just tiny grands of sand
We don't mean a thing to the powers in control
But it's time we made a stand
And maybe then we'll reach our goal

I know that I'm far from clever
And I know that I don't fit in
But don't treat me like I'm good for nothing
Because I see my ship's coming in

I found out
That no matter what they say
They can never take away my self respect
I've no doubts
Tide's gonna turn
I found out
Things gonna change (reason to shout)...
