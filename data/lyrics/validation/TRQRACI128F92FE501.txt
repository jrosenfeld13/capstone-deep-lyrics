Sunday morning on the bed two half-eaten croissants
Sunday morning, we'll soon be out on the boulevards
Monday morning, we have to fly back home again
While I'm sleeping you paint a ring on my finger with your black marker-pen

I'm all about you, you're all about me, we're all about each other
I'm all about you, you're all about me, we're all about each other

You don't have to tell 'cause I know so well, what we are all after?
Likewise if uncertainty puts a spell on me, I have to zoom in your laughter, your laughter
Wednesday morning, we sleep over and we're late again
Let's skip breakfast, we need this precious time just to comprehend

I'm all about you, you're all about me, we're all about each other
I'm all about you, you're all about me, we're all about each other
I'm all about you, you're all about me, we're all about each other
I'm all about you, you're all about me, we're all about each other

Each other, each other, each other, each other
