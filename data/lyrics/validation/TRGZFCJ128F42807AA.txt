I was standing by my window
On a cold and cloudy day
When I saw the hearse come rollin'
For to take my mother away

Will the circle be unbroken?
By and by Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waitin'
In the sky Lord, in the sky

I told the undertaker:
"Undertaker, please drive slow
For this body you are haulin'
Lord, I hate to see her go"

Will the circle be unbroken?
By and by Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waitin'
In the sky Lord, in the sky

Well I followed close behind her
Tried to hold up and be brave
But I could not hide my sorrow
When they laid her in the grave

Will the circle be unbroken?
By and by Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waitin'
In the sky Lord, in the sky

I went back home, my home was lonesome
Missed my mother she was gone
All my brothers and sisters crying
In our home so sad and alone

Will the circle be unbroken?
By and by Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waitin'
In the sky Lord, in the sky

We sang the songs of childhood
Hymns of faith that made us strong
Ones that our mother had taught us
Hear the angels sing along

Will the circle be unbroken?
By and by Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waitin'
In the sky Lord, in the sky
