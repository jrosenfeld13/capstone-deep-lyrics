Who cares? We do!
But we don't care what you think
Our lives aren't for the taking
When all else fails we still believe in Him
Yeah!
Time passes and with time we grow stronger
We're in this for the long run
Don't you know it's all the way?
The battle is the Lord's

So we pray and put on the whole armor day to day
The work of God grows in us with His strength
We move past hills and mountains
In Him we go forth
We are children of the Lord

We can't redo everything we've broken
But we will be outspoken
Proclaim the truth and shatter all the lies
Carry in your hearts the great commandment
Don't take the cross for granted
Don't you want to be the ones?
The daughters and the sons?

So we pray and put on the whole armor day to day
The work of God grows in us with His strength
We move past hills and mountains
In Him we go forth
We are children of the Lord

Who cares? We do!
But we don't care what you think
Our lives aren't for the taking
When all else fails we still believe in Him
Yeah!
We don't want to hear the lame excuses
The doctrinal misuses
We just want to keep it pure
The gospel must be heard!
