Will you take part in my life, my love
That is my dream
Life is but a dream; it's what you make it
Always try to give; don't ever take it
Life has its music, life has its song of love, love
Life is but a dream, and I dream of you
Strange as it seems, all night I see you
I'm tryin' to tell you just what you mean to me
I love you with all my heart
I adore you and all your lovin' charms
I want you to do your part
Come here to my open arms
Life is but a dream, & we can live it
Oh we can make a love none to compare with
Oh will you take part in my life, my love
That is my dream
