(release your body)
(beloved, freedom!)
(release your body)

Satellite, satellite
Keep on drifting out into the night
Take me high, take me low
Take me anywhere you want to go

You lift me up, i'll push you down
Take me with you as you're spinning around
Satellite, satellite
Keep on drifting till you're out of sight

(release your body)
Your freedom is the energy
(beloved, it's time to party)
The energy in you and me
(beloved, freedom, release your body)
Your freedom is the energy
(beloved, it's time to party)
The energy in you and me
(beloved, freedom, release your body)

Idlewild, idle child
I feel your presence and it drives me wild
Climb a path, up to the top
Keep on climbing, don't you ever stop

You give me light, i give you space
Light my fire with your smiling face
Idlewild, idle child
Feel the pleasure as it drives you wild

(release your body)
Your freedom is the energy
(beloved, it's time to party)
The energy in you and me
(beloved, freedom, release your body)
Your freedom is the energy
(beloved, it's time to party)
The energy in you and me
(beloved, freedom, release your body)
Your freedom is the energy
(beloved, freedom, release your body)

Satellite, satellite
Keep on drifting out into the night
Satellite, satellite
Keep on drifting till you're out of sight

(release your body)
Your freedom is the energy
(beloved, it's time to party)
The energy in you and me
(beloved, freedom, release your body)
Your freedom is the energy
(beloved, it's time to party)
The energy in you and me
(beloved, freedom, release your body)

Your freedom is the energy
(beloved, it's time to party)
The energy in you and me
(beloved, freedom, release your body)
Your freedom is the energy
