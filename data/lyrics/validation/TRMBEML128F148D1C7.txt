(Wang Chung)

Darlin', I believe in love
Since I met you, baby
I believe in love
The way you hold me
My heart is stirred
You can control me
Without a word

Chorus:
Turn on you white light
In my open eyes
Oh girl, you hypnotize me
I feel your white light
You're so bright
I'm hypnotized
And as you're looking at me
It's a deep ecstasy
And no word is enough
Just shine the light in my eyes
And hypnotize me love

Darlin', I believe in love
In this hate-ridden world
I believe in love
Do you know the power
You have over me
Use it every hour
Shine the light on me

Repeat Chorus

Turn me on (with your love)
Turn me on (with your love)
Turn your light around to mesmerise me
Turn me on, oo-oh
Just shine the light in my eyes
And hypnotize me love
Just shine the light in my eyes
And hypnotize me love

Repeat Chorus
