Dodge Swinger 1973, Galaxie 500
All the way stars' green, gotta go
Dodge Swinger 1973, top down, chassis low
Panel dim, light drive, Jesus on the dashboard
T-minus whenever it feels right, Galaxie 500
Planets align, a king is born

Whenever it feels right
Whenever it feels right
Whenever it feels right
Whenever it feels right

Dodge Swinger 1973, flaps down, chassis free
Buzz Aldrin, Armstrong, or maybe just me
Don't worry, it's coming
Don't worry, it's coming
Jesus on the dashboard

Whenever it feels right
Whenever it feels right
Whenever it feels right
I turn on the radio

Hey kid, are you going my way?
Hop in, we'll have ourselves a field day
We'll find us some spacegrass
Lay low, watch the universe expand
Skyway, permanent Saturday
Oh, by the way, Saturn is my rotary
Hop in, it'll be eternity
Till we make it to M83

Once around the Sun, cruising, climbing
Jupiter cyclops winks at me, yeah, he knows who's driving
Hit neutral in the tail of a comet
Let the vortex pull my weight
Push the seat back a little lower
Watch light bend in the blower
Planets align
A king is born
Dodge Swinger
Jesus on the dashboard

Whenever it feels right
Whenever it feels right
Whenever it feels right
Whenever it feels right
