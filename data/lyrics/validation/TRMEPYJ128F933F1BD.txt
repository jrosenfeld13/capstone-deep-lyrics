I never saw the mornin' 'til I stayed up all night
I never saw the sunshine 'til you turned out the light
I never saw my hometown until I stayed away too long
I never heard the melody until I needed the song
'Til I needed the song
I never saw the white line 'til I was leavin' you behind
I never knew I needed you until I was caught up in a bind
I never spoke I love you" 'til I cursed you in vain
I never felt my heart strings until I nearly went insane
'Til I nearly went insane
I love you
I love you
Sometimes It's just so hard to say
I never saw the east coast until I moved to the west
I never saw the moonlight until it shone off of your breast
I never saw your heart until he tried to steal it away
I never saw your tears until they rolled down your face
'Til the rolled down your face
