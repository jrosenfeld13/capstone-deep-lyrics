You feel the metal power
The flame is burning at all hours
Hold on to, on to your dream
I want you to shout and scream

Oh - trust in the fire
When the night is cold
It will keep you warm
Oh - trust in the fire
The shadows of darkness
Can't do you no harm
So trust in the fire

Get up and stand together
And the heat will last forever
Believe me, you're not alone
Rock fever's bred in the bone

Oh - trust in the fire
When the night is cold
It will keep you warm
Oh - trust in the fire
The shadows of darkness
Can't do you no harm
So trust in the fire
