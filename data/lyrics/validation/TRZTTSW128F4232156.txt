A man is innocent
Until he's proven guilty
A man is innocent
Until you make him lie

Well, you can cry little lady
But I never put no one before you
And you can hurt if you wanna
But don't let it get in your way, baby

Let people talk
But please don't believe what they say, girl
Please don't believe 'em
'Cause a man is innocent
Until he's proven guilty

When people lie to your face
Well, I guess it's just a jealousy
Oh, can't you see it must be
That he lied about your lover
Who says he's not an open cover
It's just a stab in the back
'Cause it just can't be a fact about me
It can't be, no, no
Just can't be now

Well there ain't nothing in the world
Like a woman's scorn and fury
Sometimes you can't change her mind
'Cause she's her own juge and jury

Let people talk
But please don't believe what they say, girl
Please don't believe 'em
'Cause a man is innocent
Until he's proven guilty

A man is innocent
Until he's proven guilty
It can't be, it can't be, no
A man is innocent
Until he's proven guilty
