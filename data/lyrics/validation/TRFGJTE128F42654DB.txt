Darlin' I'll pack up my clothes
Take my heart on down the road
I'll even make believe I don't love you

Lose my mind, go insane, turn my face to the pourin' rain
There's nothin' I wouldn't do if you want me to

But I'd rather stay around and love you
And be the one to make your dreams come true
But if it takes good-bye to make you happy
Then I'll just walk away if you want me to

If there's no way to make it work
I'll find a way to hide the hurt
I'll do my best to do what's best for you

I'll just take your memory and disappear quietly
Quit acting like a fool if you want me to

But I'd rather stay around and love you
And be the one to make your dreams come true
But if it takes good-bye to make you happy
Then I'll just walk away if you want me to

Ohh if it takes good-bye to make you happy
Then I'll just walk away if you want me to
