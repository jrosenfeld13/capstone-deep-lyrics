(*) I feel your love coming on
(Just) Like the calm before the storm
Your love is out to get me
I feel you taking over
You take my mind and body over

(**) I'm exposed to your love
And I feel so susceptible
My resistance is low
'Cause you're oh so incredible

(* repeat)

When you do your dance
The magic intensifies
I'm like putty in your hands
When you take me so deep inside

(* repeat 3 times)

I feel your love comin' on (repeat)

(** repeat)
(* repeat and fade)
