I've been so long in midnight
Praying for the light of dawn
And hope's been my companion
In the dark to keep me strong
But there's something awesome
Shining out through the ebony
And now my soul can finally see

There is glory in the night
So beautiful and bright
A glimpse of You
Coming from the other side
You are reaching through the stars
And You're speaking to my heart
I know it's You
Calling from the other side

How could I not have realized

You've been here all along
So constant and so faithful
Through the darkness and beyond
It's unthinkable, undreamable
There's peace when I look up
'Cause I see the evidence of love

The other sidetonight

I am dancing through the night
Knowing things will be all right
Because of You
I'll make it to the other side
You are reaching through the stars
And You're speaking to my heart
I know it's You
Calling from the other side
