I know you like that

Girl, tonight is all for you, a special rendezvous, a table for two

A table for two, dinner room with a view
Your body's unwinding you, let me eat up
Gonna start at your toes til I heat it up
A table for two
Tonight I'm gonna eat on you, but there won't be no IOUs
No teasing you, gonna kiss on your lips where it's pleasing you

Come on in, lay the table, it's your body I wanna feast
Girl tonight, I'll be your waiter, I'm gonna serve a midnight treat
Would you like a little teaser, enough to wipe your appetite
A little taste of something sweeter, served just the way you like
I wanna taste your wine, I want your lips on mine
I wanna pleasure you, baby, anyway you want me to

A table for two, dinner room with a view
Your body's unwinding you, let me eat up
Gonna start at your toes til I hit it up
A table for two
Tonight I'm gonna eat on you, but there won't be no add on you
No teasing you, gonna kiss on your lips where it's pleasing you

I'll make you say oh, a little more
I think you're ready for the main course
A little cream, and cherry thing
That I can spread below your navel ring
I work my way down just a bit lower
I wanna kiss your body right
And just when you think it's over
I'll make it last all night
I wanna taste your wine, I want your lips on mine
I wanna pleasure you (if it's alright girl)
Baby, anyway you want me to

A table for two, dinner room with a view
Your body's unwinding you, let me eat up
Gonna start at your toes til I heat it up
A table for two
Tonight I'm gonna eat on you, but there won't be no IOUs
No teasing you, gonna kiss on your lips where it's pleasing you

Fingertips, on your lips, don't it make you wanna cream
Don't say sssh, they so sweet, on my tongue
I can feel sugar rush, here it comes

A table for two, dinner room with a view
Your body's unwinding you, let me eat up
Gonna start at your toes til I heat it up
A table for two
Tonight I'm gonna eat on you, but there won't be no IOUs
No teasing you, gonna kiss on your lips where it's pleasing you
