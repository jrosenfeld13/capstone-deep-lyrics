Once was a woman and once was a man
Who'd never been lovers, just good friends
Both of them happy with rings on their hands
But they'd dreamed of each other, romance

So picture two people alone in a room
Together for the very first time
Candles are burning, holding each other

And picture two people whose dreams have come true
They must be goin' out of their minds
If for only a moment seems like forever

Finishing touches
The canvas set to dry
Each color tells its story
Of where and when and why
Finishing touches

Now no one can know what a love is to life
Till they have to choose one, lose one
And no one can know what a heartache is like
Till they have to break one, take one

Finishing touches
The canvas set to dry
Each color tells its story
Of where and when and why
Finishing touches

Now, there is a woman and there is a man
Who used to be good friends, now they're just lovers
Their dreams of forever must come to an end
And stop all this madness, somehow recover

So picture two people alone in a room
Who finally have made up their minds
Oh, how the tears flow, both know

And picture them holdin' each other real tight
Knowing it's the very last time
They gotta let go, let go

Finishing touches
The canvas set to dry
Each color tells its story
Of where and when and why
Finishing touches

The canvas set to dry
Each color tells its story
Of where and when and why
Finishing touches
