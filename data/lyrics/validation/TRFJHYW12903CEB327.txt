Tell me what is wrong
And I'll put it in a song
And I'll play it on the stage

Show me where it hurts
And I'll write it down in words
And I'll play it on the stage

Esmerelda
You're so continental
Many people know your name

I don't know when it was
I got rabbit in my blood
I do not recall the age
I always did feel bad
But I don't know what I had
But now it's all the rage

Esmerelda
You're so continental
Many people know your name
