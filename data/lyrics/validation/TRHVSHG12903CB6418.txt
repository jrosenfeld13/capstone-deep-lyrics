[Verse 1]
Go get your guns
Go get your knives
Go have some fun
Go take a life
Cause it is necessary
When they come
You watch 'em try
To flee and run
But they all die
Cause it is necessary
When it's done
Look in my eyes
And give me one
Good reason why
You think it's necessary
Maybe some
Deserve the strife
But we are none
To go decide
If it is necessary

[Chorus]
Their guns are firing, firing
Their guns are firing
Bombs away
The shrapnel falls like stars
It washes away who we are
Their guns are firing, firing
Their guns are firing
Bombs away
The shrapnel falls like stars
It washes away who we are

[Verse 2]
You hear the shots (Yeah)
There goes another one
Don't call the cops (Yeah)
Go get your fucking gun
Ready or not (Yeah)
No warning when they come
Get or get got (Yeah)
It's time to fight or run
Somebody's hit (Yeah)
They seen 'em hit the ground
Who gives a shit? (Yeah)
He's just a victim now
No candles lit (Yeah)
Darkness is all around
Put up your fist (Yeah)
Show them you'll stick around

[Chorus]
Their guns are firing, firing
Their guns are firing
Bombs away
The shrapnel falls like stars
It washes away who we are
Their guns are firing, firing
Their guns are firing
Bombs away
The shrapnel falls like stars
It washes away who we are

[Refrain]
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

[Chorus]
Their guns are firing, firing
Their guns are firing
Bombs away
The shrapnel falls like stars
It washes away who we are
Their guns are firing, firing
Their guns are firing
Bombs away
The shrapnel falls like stars
It washes away who we are
Bombs away
Bombs away
