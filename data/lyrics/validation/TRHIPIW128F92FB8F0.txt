And when my burden seems hard to bare
And there is no one to help me share
I just call on King Jesus
And I know he'll surely hear
You know He took my load away
And I begin to say
Just a little more faith and grace is all I need
Jesus Is all I need

Well....
That's all... that's all I need
When I cannot see my way
Ohhh..that's all...that's all I need
To help me run the race
That's all... all I need
When I cannot see my way
Just a little more faith & grace
That's all I need...Jesus is all I need

You know That is the key to the kingdom
You know faith can unlock the door
I just call Him every morning
The strength I need as I go
Oh, He'll give you what you need
Oh, If you'll only just believe
Just a little more faith & grace
All I need. Jesus is all I need
