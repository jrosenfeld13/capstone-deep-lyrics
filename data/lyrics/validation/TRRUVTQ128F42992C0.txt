I was working in my lab late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
My monster from the slab began to arise
When suddenly to my surprise

He did the Mash
He did the Monster Mash
The Monster Mash
It was a graveyard smash
It was a smash
It caught on in a flash
The Monster Mash
He did the Monster Mash

From the hall of gore in the castle east
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes

He did the Mash
He did the Monster Mash
The Monster Mash
It was a graveyard smash
It was a smash
It caught on in a flash
The Monster Mash
He did the Monster Mash

The zombies were having fun
The party had just begun
The guests included Wolf-Man
Dracula and his son

The brain surgeons were all digging the sounds
Of Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
The poodle stabbers were about to arrive
With their vocal group The Crypt-Kicker Five

He did the Mash
They did the Monster Mash
The Monster Mash
It was a graveyard smash
It was a smash
It caught on in a flash
The Monster Mash
They did the Monster Mash

Come in, Boris, we always have a guest for breakfast
Ha-ha-ha, I mean, Horace, we always have a breast for geckfast

Igor, have you watered the brains today, Igor? Igor?
