BE THE ONE
TONY RICH PROJECT

Could you be the one...

I can think of nothing better
Than to know the one you love
For as long as we've been together now
We should open up our hearts, yeah

(Chorus:)
If I gave you my heart
Would you be the one that I love
If I told you my fears
Would you be the one that I trust
Would you make sure everything's fine
Would you hold me close thru the night
Would you be the one that I love
Will you hold me tonight

I feel like breaking down the walls
Welcome you into my world
I'm not afraid of what you'll find in me
I just want us to be closer
Yeah...

(Chorus:)
Confide in me, tell me all your fears
I wanna be, the one that you depend on
Let's share our dreams, forget about the
Hard times that we'll face
Let's go all the way...
Yeah

(Chorus:) 2x
