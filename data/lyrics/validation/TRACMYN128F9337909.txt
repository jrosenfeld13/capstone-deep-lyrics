Stay Proud! Stay True! Stay Punk!

For all you scurvies and castaways whose lives are in a rut
And all you who've seen better days and all ya Dirty Mutts
Just have a seat we'll all be mates we'll get you all a beer!
From us to you, let the record spin you got nothin' to fear!

'Cause when you think that all is lost you know we're gonna be
Right there with ya, til' the end we're brothers you and me
'Cause when you think that all is lost you know we're gonna be
Right there with ya, til' the end we're brothers you and me

Barroom Brawls and Irish songs, your braces and your boots!
Cheers to the living! salute the dead! your family pride and roots
Pin up chicks and Piracy tattoos, Beer and Unity! what'll it be?
Everyone will see! so cheers to you and me!

'Cause when you think that all is lost you know we're gonna be
Right there with ya, til' the end we're brothers you and me
'Cause when you think that all is lost you know we're gonna be
Right there with ya, til' the end we're brothers you and me
