The sun rises at nine departs at five
Ain't doing overtime no more
Because in this world of color
The brightest picture is plugged right into your wall
And maybe there's a million people singing shoeshine blues
To no one that they've ever met before and
Indifference is a drug that I see people buy
At the local store, local store
You, you, you think a little love is all you need
But love is such a small thing can't you see
I think you'll find it sits in a book and
Changes the words that you read

You just feel what you want it to be
What you want it to feel
What you want it to be
Oh
You just feel what you want it to be
What you want it to feel
What you want it to be

The man in the moon has a cold in the back of his head today
So dark is the river as the old bridge of lovers
Finds it's getting washed all away
There are three wise men in the darkness of the desert
Still trying to be finding their way
The tables have been laid and the food has been served
But the cost of eating is too much for most to pay

You think a little love is all you need
But love is such a small thing can't you see
I think you'll find it sits in a book and
Changes the words that you read

You just feel what you want it to be
What you want it to feel
What you want it to be
Oh
You just feel what you want it to be
What you want it to feel
What you want it to be

Feel it, feel it
Go ahead now go
Well, you just feel what you want it to be
What you want it to feel
What you want it to be
Oh
You just feel what you want it to be
What you want it to feel
What you want it to be

Feel what you want it to be
What you want it to feel

What you want it to be

(Repeat until the end)
