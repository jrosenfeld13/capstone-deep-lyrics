Giving up a life worth leading tears us down
And no surprise, the coldest eyes never found
Giving up a life worth living kills us all
The longest time, the longest line that took all

Live your life in sacrifice is what you did
And I don't think a rose or "Raise a toast" seems to fit
I still get scared of fate, and interstate, and death by fire
It's just the longest time, longest line of heart's desire

Didn't I tell you there was no such thing as a bad bad day?
And baby, even if there was, I wouldn't believe it anyway

One poison, two poison, three boys and
It's not a known for sure
It's just the cold, the eyes, and no surprises, that's not pure
I still get scared of fate, and interstate, and death by fire
It's just the longest time, longest line of heart's desire

Didn't I tell you there was no such thing as a bad bad day?
And baby, even if there was, I wouldn't believe it anyway
