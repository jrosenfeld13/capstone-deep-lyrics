It's been a blue, blue day
I feel like runnin' away
I feel like runnin' away from it all

And my woman's been untrue
She's gone and found somebody new
It's been a blue, blue day for me

And I feel like cryin', sighin'
What can I do?
I feel like prayin', sayin'
Well, I'm glad we're through

It's been a blue, blue day
I feel like runnin' away
I feel like runnin' away from the blues

I feel like cryin', sighin'
What can I do?
I feel like prayin' and sayin'
Well, I'm glad we're through

It's been a blue, blue day
I feel like runnin' away
I feel like runnin' away from the blues
I feel like runnin' away from the blues
