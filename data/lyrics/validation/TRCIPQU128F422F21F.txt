You think it's easy to live the silent lie
But your second face is peeling
Every word spoken every blink of the eye
Deceit makes itself revealing
Sickening how easy trust can be offset
Blatant truth will burn right through your ??
I hope this happens to you
And I hope your soul's splitting in two
And you can look me in the eyes
Your stagnant poise generates a blame
Filtered through the heart that's dying
Self absorbed soon enough you'll be rung on
And in this pretentiousness attitude drown
The twisted truth is inhaled by all
But its purest form is thriving
This will happen to you
Someone you trust will be untrue
Rot on the inside
This will happen to you
And you'll feel the ache of being used
