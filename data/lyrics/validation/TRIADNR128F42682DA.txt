What's happening to society?
Is personal gain the highest goal?
Is important in today's life no control of your life?
Mindless follower of rules
Be anonymous, step out of line
Consider other people as fools?

I see your face and it's a dead one
You fake emotions, enslaved by faith
Has society come to the point
Where no one bothers thinking
Enslavement of the mind

The lame among society
Do not have to learn
They walk the path of insanity
But they can't see
Their own mental misery
Your minds gets weaker
As your strength grows stronger
