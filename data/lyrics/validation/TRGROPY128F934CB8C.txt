I say cocaine
Cocaine
Runnin' round your heart
Runnin' round your brain
Yeah bittersweet

I say come on mama
Come on quick
Cocaine make him poor boy
So sick

Oh sweet mama
When I thought you understood
You got no connections
It's just no good for me
Hey sweet cocaine

I say cocaine
Cocaine
Runnin' round your heart
Runnin' round your brain
Yeah bittersweet
