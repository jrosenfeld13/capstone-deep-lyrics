I'll just close my eyes
Do as you like... Fright
And all the time, I sham
'Cos so very seldom I want to laugh... Fright
And if it proves all right
I've got a fantastic method for life... Fright
You've got some good advice
Your suggestion's not
I want to try... Fright

A huge hole in the door
Making my things public
You see me now... Fright
I'm angry in my calm
And I can no longer look on and stand

Fright... Fright

I want to find some words
And shout out all furies
I hate you all... Fright
