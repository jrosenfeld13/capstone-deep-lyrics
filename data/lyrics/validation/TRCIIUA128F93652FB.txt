[Verse 1]
Why can't we speak another language, one we all agree on?
Why and when men look outside, do they see houses
Instead of the fields they grew from?
We are constantly uprooted from them, making us tiresome and fearful
Can you get up right now and endeavor to freefall?

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause you can fall if you want to
It's just a matter of how far
You've treasured your hometown
You've forgotten where you are
And it will stay with you until you're mind's been found
And it has been found wandering around

[Chorus]
With that skipping rope, the trampoline
The crafty smoke that made us choke
But we didn't give up hope
It's the simple ways of getting paid
The carelessness of running away, I wish I stayed
I wish I stayed
I wish I stayed

[Verse 2]
Patterns all arranged in my background
It's pillars and posts keeping this country on forms
Letters were all sent with no addresses, so that people can't discover
We're always undercover
Why do I always draw triangles instead of words this paper so deserves?
Cause you see, I don't own my clothes but I own my mind
And it's not what you've lost
But it's what you find

[Chorus]
With that skipping rope, the trampoline
The crafty smoke that made us choke
But we didn't give up hope
It's the simple ways of getting paid
The carelessness of running away, I wish I stayed
I wish I stayed
I wish I stayed

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause you can fall if you want to
It's just a matter of how far
You've treasured your hometown
You've forgotten where you are
And it will stay with you until you're mind's been found
And it has been found wandering around

[Chorus]
With that skipping rope, the trampoline
The crafty smoke that made us choke
But we didn't give up hope
It's the simple ways of getting paid
The carelessness of running away, I wish I stayed
I wish I stayed
I wish I stayed
I wish I stayed
