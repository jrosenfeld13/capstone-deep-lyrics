Sea sounds
A blessed man's call
I'm floating like a feather
And I just won't fall
(4x)

There's a mysterious air about this place
The silence is surrounded by the sound of empty space
The ground is full of black holes and nothing seems to grow
And time passes like wine glasses with an easy flow
The greasy glow and smell of lotion and sweat
And I can't help wonder just how blue an ocean can get
Its soothing motion has swept me off my feet, now I'm floating
If freedom is to lose control, my moves are an omen
The water and the golden sun will solve it all
My soul is one with both, feel small enough to broaden up my scope
Barely holding up but standing strong in the towering waves
The sand is warm, I've lost track of hours and days
No crowds or names or faces, no heartbreaks to remember
A thousand fading traces to the dark days of November
The mountains and the island, the shadow of the lighthouse
I'm bound to keep on smiling when I travel towards the bright clouds

Sea sounds
A blessed man's call
I'm floating like a feather
And I just won't fall
(4x)

I'm still dry cooler, give me life by the pool side
Unlike with most things, to this there are no two sides
Time stretches with the desert flavored blues slides
Never hesitate or wait, in making new strides
In a silent way, I'm smiling at myself
As the light of day recedes with a vibrant colored trail
I'm tied into its tail, disappear in the horizon
And here is what's surprising: I have no fear of rising
As the morning overtakes night and coffee doesn't taste right
You must accept the basic right of ease with no haste
Don't fight against it
I'll breathe and let the words write themselves
Left with just an instinct of the world
Sight and smell

Sea sounds
A blessed man's call
I'm floating like a feather
And I just won't fall
(3x)

Sea sounds
A tugboat's call
I'm floating like a feather
And I just won't fall
