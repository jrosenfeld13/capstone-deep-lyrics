This is it, it's the key to it all and besides
I'm so tired being sick all the time
They said don't get a first gen but it's nice, it's so nice

And you can come push the buttons if you like
Just be gentle, I'm still
Making sure all the functions are right, are all right

But this new heart of mine goes from zero to love in no time
This new heart of mine
And this new heart of mine goes from zero to love in no time
This new heart of mine

So the salesman said he got one for himself
A charmed life with some kids
And some stainless steel knives

Paid in full as of 2029
I'll need to scrape all our change and give up all my toys
But really who needs more than this thing?

But this new heart of mine goes from zero to love in no time
This new heart of mine
And this new heart of mine goes from zero to love in no time
This new heart of mine
