He knows that I love him, after all
I even love him better
And much more than before
If life was a letter it would be in capital
And all the words around us would appear so very small
Like they don't count at all

Sometimes we have to hurt each other
Sometimes we have to leave
Sometimes we have to date another
To realize we're in love

I know that he loves me after all
He even loves me better
And much more than before
If life was a tree we would be its fruit
And we would spread our seeds
To create something new

Sometimes we have to hurt each other
Sometimes we have to leave
Sometimes we have to date another
To realize

Sometimes we have to hurt each other
Sometimes we have to leave
Sometimes we have to date another
To realize we're in love
