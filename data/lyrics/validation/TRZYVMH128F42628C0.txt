I see you sing
I don't need your praise
I need a hand, she said
You said it's worth
All that is mine
Prove it, sometimes

Under a moon
That shines like it's day
It hangs like a star, somedays
I'm getting blind
I see with your eyes
It's too dark, sometimes

Prove it, sometimes

Your head in my hands
Gets darker than night
It's tearing me down, sometimes
The world's like a friend
I find I can smile
Don't say "don't cry"

Prove it, sometimes

I see you sing
I don't need your praise
You hold out a hand, she said
You said it's worth
All that is mine
Prove it, sometimes

Prove it, sometimes
Prove it, sometimes

Your head in my hands
It's darker than night
It's tearing me down, sometimes
Under a moon
Shines likes it's day...
