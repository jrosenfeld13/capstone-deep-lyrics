My love don't change
There's going to be some stealing
My love don't change
There's going to be some stealing done
And if I backbite you
I don't mean no harm

What do you want with a woman
When she won't do nothing you say
What do you want with a woman
When she won't do nothing you say
What do you want with a rooster
When he won't crow 'fore day

If my love don't change
There's going to be some riding done
If my love don't change
There's going to be some riding done
And if I take you woman
I just be made my run

Going in one of these alleys
Get me some lonesome booze
Going in one of these alleys
Get me a quart of this lonesome booze
My woman done left me
I got these love changing blues
