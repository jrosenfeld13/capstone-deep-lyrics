In deserts I was preaching
The hand of god was with me
Baptised with water and I praised
The one who came behind me
To save us all with the holy ghost
-a prophet of the fools I've been lost

I'm sure you're there wandering around
But do you care for me I'm alone
You talk of love not for me
In my dungeon cold I could think about
All the things you've said
But I can't understand your famous son

I left the way of heaven, or did you lead me from it

No no turning back
I'm banished from sanctuary
The darkness in me is filling me with pain
There's no way to turn back for eternity

In shadows I'm walking and caught in loneliness
Deliverance I wait for but how long?
Are you the one who should come show me the light in you
Or should we wait for someone? Another!

No...

Your reich should come to this world
Your way smoothed by my blood, friend
My might will decrease but you'll get
High, yes so much higher be careful of the rats, friend
Cause they'll never sleep before they catch you, too

The blind can see the sun, cripples walk alone
The deaf can hear my words they believe just believe
They believe in me. Look! The signs are near
To perform my task to perform my way
To perform the way I walked
The way of the crucifix

I hear the hangman coming, I wait for execution

No...
