I bought my friend a Mustang in 1993
My granddad died and I bought that guitar with the money that he left for me
The artwork on my bedroom walls was all made by my friends
Each piece of it was priceless and I'll never see it again

I had a shoebox full of love letters I kept it in a way
From girls I haven't seen for years to remind me of my younger days
And all my books and poetry and silly little songs
Well they all went up in flames that day now everything is gone

All the things we lost in the fire
All the things we learned on the way
Is this the end of an era or just a pub in Holloway
It started in the basement on the 18th of December
And now all that's left are memories we can't remember

Oh my girlfriend loved her wardrobe man, she had so many clothes
And now all her sexy dresses have been damaged by the smoke
Well Andy lost his passport and university degree
Danny lost his laptop and Rainbow lost her tree

Ally lost his bedroom and Jamie lost his job
Mike Russell didn't own much but he's still pretty pissed off
North London lost a boozer a venue and a stage
And everyone will really miss that pub in Holloway

All the things we lost in the fire
All the things we learned on the way
Is this the end of an era or just a pub in Holloway
It started in the basement on the 18th of December
And now all that's left are memories we can't remember

The band lost their equipment and they went their separate ways
It's pretty save to say that things will never be the same
But it came with a brand new year a time for change and that
I'd like to thank Alan Pownall for lending me his flat
