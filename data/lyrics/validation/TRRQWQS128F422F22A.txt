I never said that i was a fucking poet
I never tried to be something i knew i'd never be
There's no use in pretending
I'll tell you one thing, so listen closely
I'll tell you one thing, so listen closely when i tell you this is straight from the bottom of my broken heart. So please save the excuses for someone who wants to hear them
You're not here; that's all that matters
I'm just afraid that i will never feel this way again
You're not here; that's all that matters
The lies, the deceit; will i ever say enough is enough, or will i continue to let you walk all over me? i am done. Pistol please. I can't take this anymore
Pistol please
