We do a pretty good job of throwing sticks and stones
But everyone's got a closet full of skeleton bones
No need to tear each other down
'Cause we're all standing here on common ground

Chorus:
If we could love one another
We could bring Heaven down out of the sky
If we could love one another
We could bring hate to its knees tonight
Wouldn't every future be bright
If we could love one another
Love one another right

We find it easy enough loving the latest trends
Take something that's dead and make it our closet friend
Imagine what this world could be
If we worked as hard at loving you and me

Repeat chorus

Bridge:
Don't let your anger get the best of you
When you're provoked you simply refuse
Don't waste your time with retribution
Why not try making a contribution
Reach down a hand to the tired and weak
Lift up a soul with the words you speak
Shake it up with a revolution - and set the world on fire
