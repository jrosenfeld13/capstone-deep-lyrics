The skeleton goes twirling in the sea
For having been disobeyed to people
The father had drowned his daughter's body
No one could remember why exactly
A lost fisherman thought he'd caught big fish
The hanging bones were instead nightmarish

He rushed back home with her caught in his line
Lit a fire which appeased his panic
Kind ladies untangled her from her klink
To keep her warm, cloaked her with furs and hides
Starting to soften in the warm silence
Fell asleep, untempted by her presence

He was dreaming, a tear formed in his eyes
She saw it shine, suddenly felt thirsty
Unfurled her bones, brought her mouth to the tear
She drank and drank, it felt like a river
Plunged her hand in and gently pulled his heart
Her four-fold drum that would follow her prayer

They woke up all entwined, breath against breath
Got up to live by the sea where they were fed
By the ocean

No, they are not afraid, death has its place
In order to create, in order to live

She'd beat the drum and would sing for new flesh
Sing for hair, eyes, chubby hands, legs, and breasts
All that a woman needs would then surface
She sang some more to bear the sleeping child
Slipped in back with him, new skin against skin
Returned the heart, the magnificent drum
