Do do do do do do do doo, ba da ba babaa
It doesn't matter now, what the song's about
Do do do do do doo, ba da ba ba ba baaa
It doesn't matter now, what the song's about

I really don't want to write another I'm a dick song again
It doesn't matter now, what the song's about
My mouth is my own bear trap I keep setting and stepping in
It doesn't matter now, what the song's about

No matter what i did, no matter what i said
It doesn't matter now, we've got it figured out
We could continue on, with such nonsense to fill the days
..and we won't speak, of ugly things
But when these lyrics come out you'll come scream at me
One foots in your mouth the other foots in your grave
So sing your heart out loud (x3)

Do do do do do do do doo, ba da ba da da daaaa
Sing your heart out loud

I'm a dick, there, I said it, sing your heart out loud
