Everything is perfect
Until I get your phone call
Tellin' me something I said or did that wasn't even my fault

When will I know it's the end
When there's nothing left for me and you

Then it gets much much worse as the day goes on
I hear rumors of lies of my name being dropped
By the friends that I once loved

When will I know it's the end
When there's nothing left for me and you

Well take a good look, and tell me what you see
I got a bad feelin' about a thing or two
And the way life's supposed to be
With your bridled views and the life you choose
You take the fun out being and leave nothing to lose
When is enough enough

When there's nothing left for me and you
When there's nothing left for me and you
When there's nothing left for me and you
When there's nothing left for me and you
When there's nothing left for me and you
