[Verse 1]
I'm sorry about the mess on the table
I'm sure it was an accident
My hands are made of nitroglycerin
That explains the incident

[Pre-Chorus]
Fortune built my homes in daydreams
Pages I'd never seen
I'm sorry you were so disappointed
The contract states quite fundamentally
The undersigned is you
Lay your life on the line

[Chorus]
No questions
(Life on the line)
That's fine
(Life)
Just sign on the dotted line

[Verse 2]
The nib hesitates at the inkwell
A sample of the poet's blood
Guitars pluck a tune in the ozone
But me, I'm just stuck in the mud

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Fortune left my hopes in daydreams
Pages I'd never seen
I'm sorry you were so disappointed
The contract states quite fundamentally
The undersigned is you
Lay your life on the line

[Chorus]
No questions
(Life on the line)
That's fine
(Life)
Just sign on the dotted line

[Pre-Chorus]
Fortune built my hopes in daydreams
Pages I'd never seen
I'm sorry you were so disappointed
The contract states quite fundamentally
The undersigned is you
Lay your life on the line
