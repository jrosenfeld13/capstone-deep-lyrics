I wanna tell ya 'bout my friend the Dwarfstar
I wanna tell ya 'bout my friend the Dwarfstar
The first time I met him
He said he was a Dwarfstar
'Cause he was small
And he was famous
I wanna tell ya 'bout my friend the Dwarfstar
The second time I met him
He said I could never be a Dwarfstar
Because I was too tall
And I wasn't famous
I wanna tell ya 'bout my friend the Dwarfstar
The third, the second time I mean
That I went to see him
He was not in a very good mood
He said, "Stop comin' around here"
I wanna tell ya 'bout my friend the Dwarfstar
I wanna tell ya 'bout my friend the Dwarfstar
The last time
That I went to see him
He had passed away
I wanna tell ya
I wanna tell ya
I wanna tell ya
I wanna tell ya
I wanna tell ya 'bout my friend the Dwarfstar
I wanna tell ya 'bout my friend the Dwarfstar
I wanna tell ya 'bout my friend the Dwarfstar
I wanna tell ya 'bout my friend the Dwarfstar
The end
