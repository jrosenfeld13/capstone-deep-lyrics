Cast not thine eyes on what is mine
And leave it all behind
I take thy sight and thy mind
I'm here to lead the blind
And there's a man in home so I'm never alone
And the place that he's going is the place I call home
So I hold out today and try to make the exit in the easiest way

Old Man and the Angel
I said I'm ready for home it's the way to go , let it flow
Old Man and the Angel
Out of the warth and through the stars to the cold
Old Man and the Angel
I said I'm heading for home it's the way to go , Let it flow
Old MAn and the Angel

Take up Thy cross and walk behind
You hold it in your mind
Believe not the fear of mankind
Step out of your body and walk away

I twisted my heart and I followed my mind
I gave up the resistance and casually died
And he showed me the way
And he led me through the exit in the easiest way

Chorus

Video Angelus internehilium et imortalis
Even as we speak our hearts entwine
Senex et angelus video venestus caelum
Equiden lavare in meus vita empeteus
Aah eeh aah eeh aah

Chorus
