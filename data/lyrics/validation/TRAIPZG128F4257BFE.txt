[Verse 1]
I can tell by the way you'll be yelling her name
That its more than a friendly game
With a smile and an "I'm gonna fight 'til the death"
Expression in her eye

You think I'm so dramatic, just imagining again
You come to her defence, insisting that she's innocent

[Pre-Chorus]
Well excuse me, for wanting to be
The one and only lock to fit your key
Oh you believe there's nothing up her sleeve?
Well baby, we'll just wait and see

[Chorus]
You say that love is blind, well I say "Open up your eyes"
She's a master mind, she'd cheat and lie to get you to love her
Who's the victim if it doesn't make a difference?
And I'll, I'll be gone one way or another

[Verse 2]
Take a minute to see it from my side of things
Don't you think you would feel the shame?
Like you still gotta play for the victory
In a game you won yesterday?

I shouldn't have to fight for something that's already mine
But her pursuit of you has undermined my peace of mind

[Pre-Chorus]
But it's no use, crying to you
You're who her plan has done the damage to
What's done is done, I should just hold my tongue
But someone has got me outdone

[Chorus]
You say that love is blind, well I say "Open up your eyes"
She's a master mind, she'd cheat and lie to get you to love her
Who's the victim if it doesn't make a difference?
And I'll, I'll be gone one way or another

[Bridge]
And you're going under, yeah
And baby its no wonder, no no

'Cause she's stepping up her game
She's making you a prisoner of her hall of fame
She's looking for a winner for her trophy case

And you need to consider what you think you deserve
Is that all that you're worth?
No, no, no, no, no

[Chorus]
Say that love is blind, well I say "Open up your eyes"
She's a master mind, she'd cheat and lie to get you to love her
Who's the victim if it doesn't make a difference?
And I, I'll be gone one way or another

[Outro]
(You say love is blind, well I say open up your eyes)
You're going under yeah
(She's a mastermind, she'd cheat and lie to get you to love her)
And baby its no wonder
(Who's the victim if it doesn't make a difference)

And I'll, I'll be gone one way or another
I'll be gone one way or another
And I'll be gone one way or another
