Remember the place, when you were young
That seemed so real
Life was so much fun
I can see it in my son
Were you ever young?

Now these days are gone forever
Wish I'd make them last
Now we feel so sad together
Thinking of the past

Remember the time when we used to cry
Even though it was so small
Help was always near
Mother made it disappear
Did you ever cry?

Now those days are gone forever
Wish I'd make them last
Now we feel so sad together
Thinking of the past

Remember the way we used to laugh
And talk about our dreams
Living for today
Where is yesterday
Could you ever laugh?

Now those days are gone forever
Wish I'd make them last
Now we feel so sad together
Thinking of the past
It draws near
