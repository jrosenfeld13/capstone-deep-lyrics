Sky Blue and evergreen
On a sea of sparkling white
And I knew this morning scene
Would make me feel that all is right

So easy to be at peace
So At home here in the woods
I would carry this feeling
Always with me if I could. Chorus

Oh winter embrace me
Show me who I am
From silent to stormy
My heart is in your hands

Gliding through green corridors
A whispering train on a snowy rail
My best friend's behind me
Every morning without fail

Sometimes a moose or a deer
Or a wolf will cross our path
If we don't meet them face to face
We can always spot their tracks

Oh winter embrace me
Show me who I am
From silent to stormy
My heart is in your hands

From the warmth of my cabin
I see the snow wind through the pines
Though a blizzard is raging
A quiet gift is left behind

Sky blue and Evergreen
On a sea of sparkling white
And I knew this morning scene
Would make me feel that all is right

Oh winter embrace me
Show me who I am
From silent to stormy
My heart is in your hands
