If I ever hurt you it will be in self defense
And if I ever hurt you it will be in self defense
Cause the podium's as high as the gallows are low
Swing low, swing low, swing low

You are a beast and I am serving up your supper oh
You are a beast and I am serving up your supper Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

What will you do when the drink is all gone?
Will you slam your fist down on the table
Cause I'm not that kind of whore
No, I'm not that kind of whore
No, I'm not that kind of whore but I am a little Lord
No, I'm not that kind of whore but I am a little Lord
No, I'm not that kind of whore but I am a little Lord
Lord grant me patience, I am burning up inside
There are snakes out in the night
All these kids have gone astray
There are women with no meaning to their names when we say them
There are wars to win for now leftover sinful days

So, if I ever hurt you it will be in self defense
And if I ever hurt you it will be in self defense
And if you ever come at me I will hurt you
Oh, if you ever come at me I will hurt you
Oh, if you ever come at me you snake
You snake
You snake
You snake
You snake
I wish you the best, you snake
You are self professed, you snake
My heart's in my chest, you snake
You can have the rest, you snake
I wish you the best, you snake
You are self professed, you snake
My heart's in my chest, you snake
You can have the rest, you snake
