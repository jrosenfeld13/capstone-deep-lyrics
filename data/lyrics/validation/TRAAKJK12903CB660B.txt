[Verse 1]
Friends of mine they said they were friends of mine
Said they were passing time more like a waste of time
Close the door I said close the door I've told you twice before what are you waiting for

[Chorus]
Georgie Davis is coming out no more heroes we twist and shout
Oh no not me I'm not too late and I know that I'm not taking anymore
Rocky picture has lost his gun leave him out now he's having fun
Oh not not me I'm not too late and I know that I'm not waiting anymore hey hey

[Verse 2]
Silly lies don't have to advertise when will you realize I'm sick of your alibis
Running cold the water's running cold it's time that you were told
I think you're growing old

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I see you smile pictures on the wall there all friends of mine
See you standing round the back friends of mine think yourself lucky
Friends of mine they said they were friends of mine
They were just wasting time out on the dotted line
Money's gone I've known it all along why don't you say i'm wrong
Why don't they drop the bomb

[Chorus]
