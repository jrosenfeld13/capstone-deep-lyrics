Ohhhhh..
Sometimes I feel like giving up
It seems like my best just ain't good enough
Lord if you hear me, I'm calling you
Do you see, do you care all about what I'm going through

And then He says, one more day hmm, one more step
See I'm preparing you for myself
And when you can't hear my voice, please trust my plan
I'm the Lord, I see and yes I understand

But sometimes I feel like I'm all alone
I'm just like a stranger so far from home
I feel like I've done all that I can do
Please Lord give me strength, I'm just trying to make it through

That's when he told me ohhh (one more day), one more step, yeah (one more step)
Oh my child (I'm preparing you) I'm preparing you for myself
And when you can't hear my voice (can't hear my voice), please just trust my plan
I'm the Lord I see you and yes I understand

Ohhh He knows (how much we can bear) just how much we can bear ohhh
And in the time of trouble he promised he would always be there

I understand (I understand)
The Lord is telling you yes I understand(I understand)
I am the Lord I see you and yes I understand

This is what He says:
I am the Lord I changeth not
I won't forget nor have I forgot (yes, yes)
You see every thing works according to my plan
I am God, trust me, I got the whole world in my hand
Ohhhh

One more day, one more step (One more day)
I'm preparing you (preparing you) all for myself (for myself)
I'm getting you ready
And if you (can't hear my voice) can't hear me speaking, just trust my plan
Yeah I'm the Lord I love you, I see you and yes I understand (I'm the Lord I see and yes I understand)
I am the Lord I see what you're going through (I'm the Lord I see and yes I understand)
Every problem, every trial, every burden, every situation (I'm the Lord I see and yes I understand)
I understand, I won't leave you yeah yeah
I understand, understand, understand
Thank you Jesus..
