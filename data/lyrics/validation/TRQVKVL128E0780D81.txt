[Verse 1]
It takes the pain away
But could not make you stay
It's way too broke to fix
No glue, no bag of tricks

[Chorus]
Lay me down, the lie will unfurl
Lay me down to crawl

[Verse 2]
Your smile would make me sneeze
When we were Siamese
Amazing grace in here
I'd pay to have you near

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Don't go and lose your face
At some stranger's place
And don't forget to breathe
And pay before you leave

[Chorus] x2
