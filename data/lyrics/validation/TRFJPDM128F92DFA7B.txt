Lets leave lets, leave
Two, stand on two feet
Wake up wake up
I know, our feet will, carry
To carry on carry on home

Stay quiet stay true
I would never lie I would never lie
Stay quiet stay true
I would never lie I would never lie

You're the driver I'm in the backseat
Collecting my words
We both know where were bound for
Were bound for the ground

Keep driving now will you?
They will always lie
Keep driving now will you?
They will always lie

Stay quiet stay true
I would never lie I would never lie
Stay quiet stay true
I would never lie
I will always lie
