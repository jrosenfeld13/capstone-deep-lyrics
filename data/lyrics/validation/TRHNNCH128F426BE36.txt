(Verse 1)
They'll try to make you feel, that you're not good enough
You feel so incomplete, don't let them change you
Show this whole world that you were made to

(Chorus)
Shine, they can't shut out your light, no matter how hard they try
They try, but they never can win, cause they can't stop what's inside
They'll try to take you, try to break you down, remember you are born to shine

(Verse 2)
Don't let them make you think, that you're not pretty enough
You're beauty runs so deep, so deep inside you
And you know that's the reason why you

(Chorus)
Shine, they can't shut out your light, no matter how hard they try
They try, but they never can win, cause they can't stop what's inside
They'll try to take you, try to break you down, remember you are born to shine

(Bridge)

Shine, they can't shut out your light, no matter how hard they try
They try, but they never can win, cause they can't stop what's inside

They'll try to take you, try to break you down, remember you are born to shine
They'll try to take you, try to break you down, remember you are born to shine

(Outro)
You're born to (shine) you're born to (shine) said you're born to (shine)
You're born to (shine) you're born to (I said shine) you're born to (shine)
You're born to, you're born to, you're born to, you're born to, you're born to
