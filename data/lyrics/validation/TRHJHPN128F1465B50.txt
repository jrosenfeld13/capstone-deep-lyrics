Chorus
Giants
Do die
The bigger they are
They harder they fall
Giants
They die
Just walk around
The Jericho wall

VAmp
As We come in your name
And we stand on your word
What is loosed in the heavens
Will be lossed on Earth
As We come in your name
And we stand on your word
What is loosed in the heavens
Will be loosed on Earth
Let God arise Giants, DIE!

Chorus

Bridge
Your praise
Will bring down strong holds
When you praise
You will see miracles
Just praise
When things seem impossible
Then the King of Glory
Will show his Glory
Let God Arise giants, DIE!

When you praise
When you praise
When you praise
They Gotta come down

When you worship
When you worship
When you worship

They Gotta come down
When you shout
Just you shout
When you shout
They Gotta come down
