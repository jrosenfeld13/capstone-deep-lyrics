Excuse me, scumbag

Saturday night and we're ready to go
Grabbed some 40's on the way to the show
Parking lot pimpin', everything's all right
Slammed a pint of Jack and we're ready to fight

Don't fucking fight, let's party tonight
If you're straight edge, don't worry
Hey, I'll buy you a Sprite
Don't fucking fight, let's party tonight
Fuck it!

Saturday night and we're ready to go
Grabbed some 40's on the way to the show
Parking lot pimpin', everything's all right
Took a gram up my face and I'm up all night

Don't fucking fight, let's party tonight
If you're straight edge, don't worry
I'll buy you a Sprite!
Don't fucking fight, let's party tonigiht!
