[Verse 1]
I long for the trip don't need no grip I'm taking one more ride
Way out there in the prairie air I guess it's in my hide
Oh the clickety clack of the railroad track is calling
If a man could know where the Santa Fe goes when she gets under steam
And the big loud bell that bongs farewell to hear her whistle scream
She's bound to go where there ain't no snow a falling

[Chorus]
One more ride[x2]

[Verse 2]
I miss the gloom of the prairie moon that seemed to know my name
And the tumbleweed where the prairie dog feed I miss them just the same
They're all a part of a song of heart I'm saying
I recall the tune that I sang to the moon and it seemed to make it smile
And I rode away at the close of day and I stayed so long awhile
But I long to be where the memory is ringing

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
As the years go by I wonder why I longed to leave my home
And to hit the trail of the iron rail away out there alone
But my heart would sigh till I know that I am leaving
If I don't come back on a one way track way down from Mexico
You could find me there or any old where that a tumbleweed will grow
It's a goodbye now you'll never know how I'm grieving

[Chorus]
