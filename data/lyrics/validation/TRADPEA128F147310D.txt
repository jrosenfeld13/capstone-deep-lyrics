I've got a message
I think the moon is falling
But thank god, we're on the sun
So put the knife in
As the night just keeps on turning
It's 6 am, but we've just begun

You don't need a reason
To get out on the dance floor
We can get it on, and on
All night long

You don't need a reason
To get out on the dance floor
And we can get it on, and on
All night

I am blood, on the bottom of your shoes
You feel it baby
Hook, line and sinker
I am the sun
You are the sinking moon
Definitely maybe baby
I'm want to take you

You've got a message
But all the lights are burning
Ya, our shoes shake
Under the gun
So turn the lights out
We're holding hands while burning
You're 21 and second to none

Ya, ya, ya, ya

You don't need a reason
To get out on the dance floor
We can get it on, and on
All night long

I am the blood on the bottom of your shoes
You are the savior, baby
Come fight the singer
I am the sun
You are the sinking moon
I feel it coming
Ya, and I want to take you

Home, home

You don't need a reason
To get out on the dance floor
We can get it on, and on
All night

You don't need a reason
To get out on the dance floor
We can get it on, and on
All night long
