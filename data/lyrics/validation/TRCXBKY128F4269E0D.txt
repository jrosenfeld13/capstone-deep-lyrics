All day I've been banging the walls
Like a prisoner in a cell
If I don't get out I'm going to lose my mind
There's got to be more for me--I'm tired of the same old scene
I can't wait to see that face--to say goodbye--bye, bye
I want to say goodbye
I got something inside of me
That I don't intend to waste, I've got dreams baby I can't forget
I've been looking all around and there's nothing left for me
There's only one way out and girl I'm going to take it

CHORUS:
Push me, pull me, never get a minute to yourself
Pure hell, get you if you let it, stand up, sit down
All I ever get is your backtalk, back off, push me to the limit
I lead a double life, I come alive at night
I had champagne milkshake for breakfast
But I know where I'll sleep tonight
I've got a blue-eyed earthquake--she's lyin' in my bed
Ain't it a wonderful life

Push me, pull me, never get a minute to yourself
Pure hell, get you if you let it, stand up, sit down
All I ever get is your backtalk, back off, push me to the limit
I lead a double life, I come alive at night
I had champagne milkshake for breakfast
But I know where I'll sleep tonight
I've got a blue-eyed earthquake--she's lyin' in my bed
Ain't it a wonderful life

Push me, pull me, never get a minute to yourself
Pure hell, get you if you let it, stand up, sit down
All I ever get is your backtalk, back off, push me to the limit
I lead a double life, I come alive at night
I had champagne milkshake for breakfast
But I know where I'll sleep tonight
I've got a blue-eyed earthquake--she's lyin' in my bed
Ain't it a wonderful life

I lead a double life, I come alive at night
I lead a double life, I come alive at night
I lead a double life, 007 I come alive at night
Rock and roll heaven, I lead a double life
I come alive at night, rock and roll heaven
I lead a double life, I come alive at night
I lead a double life, 007 I come alive at night
