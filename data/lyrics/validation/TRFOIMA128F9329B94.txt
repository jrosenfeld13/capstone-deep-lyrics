Since July the 31st
When the winter did its worst
I've been pining for a place
Where sleep divides the days
And the ocean keeps those silences at bay

Late last night
I was woken by the murmuring
Of the insects and insomniacs outside
While you slept
I went through all my winter clothes
And quiet was the only thing I kept

With every passing day
Seems more difficult to say
And forgive me if I'm wrong
But you'll forget me when I'm gone

Late last night
I was woken by the murmuring
Of the insects and insomniacs outside
But up til then
I was dreaming of the the pines along the promenade
The summer on my skin

It's too long since I saw the sun arising
From the faint curve of an unbroken horizon
I don't mean to suggest I'm getting older
But the city looks it's best over my shoulder
