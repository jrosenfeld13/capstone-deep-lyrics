Someone should have told me when I was younger
Life was only learning how to lose
Now Im older and so much stronger
And I only feel Im being abused

And now my hands move slower and
Slower in pain
And, oh my minds going over and over again

My God my soul is dead
Its ringing in my head
Disregarding what you said
I fall farther down instead

I hold my hands out only hoping
For what I truly deserve
I draw back nothing
Only a promise
And I dont know what thats worth
