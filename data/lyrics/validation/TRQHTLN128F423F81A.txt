Hey hey mama
Run tell your papa
Go tell your sister
Run tell your auntie
That I'm going up the country
Don't you want to go

I need another half a dozen
To take them on my ragtime show
When I was leaving
I left some folks a grieving
I left my friend a moaning
I left my man a crying
He knew he didn't want me
He had no right to stall

He treated me low down and dirty
He's bound to reap what he done sowed
He knocked me and kicked me
He stomped and abused me
He knocked and cursed me
He treated me dirty
Even asked me would a matchbox
Hold my dirty clothes?
He treated me low down and dirty
He's bound to reap what he done sowed

I told him to gimme that coat I bought him
That shirt I bought him
Those shoes I bought him
Those socks I bought him
Cuz he knew he didn't want me
He had no right to stall

I told him pull of that that hat I bought him
And let his nappy head go bald

My mama got em
My papas got em
My sisters got em
My auntie had em
When I woke up this morning
Had the up the country blues
When I looked over in the corner
My grandma had em too
