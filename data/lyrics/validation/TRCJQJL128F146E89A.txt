Engel-Franz

She whispers oh such pretty lies
Don't believe her
For when she looks into her eyes
Love just isn't there
Brother, beware
Take care, my brother, take care
For the female of the species is deadlier than the male
The smile that made a dream begin
Clouds your vision
It's just the shadow of a dream
That you're living in
She never cared
Beware, my brother, beware
For the female of the species is deadlier than the male
Memories of kisses on a summer's day
That's all she left you when she went away
Now, you pay!
By walking streets, you'll never know
When the night comes
Sitting at places that you go
Hoping she'll be there
Brother, beware
Take care, my brother, take care
For the female of the species is deadlier than the male
