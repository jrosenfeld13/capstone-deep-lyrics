I am the ruler of these plaguelands; my reign drives fear into the heart of any man
None will appose me; these corpse are mine
Their blood forever stains the land for the ravens to feast
Their corpses are mine, none shall leave
None shall leave

I am the ruler of these plaguelands; my reign drives fear into the heart of any man
The ghastly sight of blood and entrails leaves my mark across the land
Warning signs for those who oppose to show them who's the man
Mother Nature cowers before me, clutching at her creations
Bowing down and realizing I am the new god in town
She can now see, I rule this land
