The look in your eyes makes my love grow stronger each day
My heart's double beatin' when I see you headed my way
That's the reason
Why I feel so good because I know
You're here to stay
Since you said you'd be my girl
You're the one that makes me feel on top of the world
You're the one that makes me feel on top of the world
I'm confessin' I adore you honey I do
There's no sorrow when I see my future with you
That's the reason
I can't let you go because I love
Everything that you do
Since you said you'd be my girl
You're the one that makes me feel on top of the world
You're the one that makes me feel on top of the world
That's the reason
I can't let you go because I love
Everything that you do
Since you said you'd be my girl
You're the one that makes me feel on top of the world
You're the one that makes me feel on top of the world
You're the one that makes me feel on top of the world
You're the one that makes me feel on top of the world
You're the one that makes me feel on top of the world
