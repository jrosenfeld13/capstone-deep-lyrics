[Hook]
This is just a test of the frequency
You can be a hood without delinquency
Cause I be the rhyme and the rhyme be me
Whatever I be the rhyme be

[Verse One]
I break the average nigga down, just like decomposition
On a mission to chart the art of rhyming way beyond traditions
Equally, youll find my visions gone beyond the 20/20
Had enough of these niggas showin me just who be on the money
I catch phrases out of the blue like touchdown throws to wide recievers
So, Hail Mary, But you couldnt Run with me if you were Gail Deavers
I got that monotone lyric for your recievers
Dont dont deceive us, cause we dont believe in non-believers
My style is more golden than that of a child who owns retrievers
I shine like Im David Helfgott, Searching for wealth, not solely
But baby, Do Ya Rilly Kno Whats going on?
I be that tech president that you Elec(t) like TRON
I base data on databases, so its too complicated to trace this
And with no flava you gotta face it, Youre tasteless
The way that I embrace this is like huggin a cripple
Invisible individuals get scratched like theyre pickles
I physically tickle your mind, like water that trickles over your nipples
I drip, cause lyrically I keep it kinky
Hookers wanna drink me, but they cant handle my tricks
Cause Ive been known for putting chip-clips on my bitches tits
It hits the year 2K, and its a whole different story
Dont need will smith to talk about Miami for me
Cause If I got a positive vibe, and a quote from a negative source
Saying my Rap Sheet was Right On!, like what Id do to the bus on my tours
For sure Im not a tourist, Im a purist
Came into the land of rhyme, sanded the hourglass and I cuffed the hands of time
To arrest your interest and express with mine
Niggas can check me out with ten items or less, while you regress and stand in line
They play the way like pantomimes, I only touch em with mitts
I tell em, Shut the fuck up!, and yo, they cant say shit
Im giving verbal facelifts to those with traces of painted faces
So, Ima tell you what the case is

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
So, when it comes to the written rhyme, the ink effects are diabolical
Off the top of the dome like George Jeffersons hair follicles
!?What?!, You put the ass in astronomical
Any attempt by you to even make a def jam could pass for comical
More psychological than movie thrillers, boxing niggas like Helena in Manila
Extract em like vanilla/ For real, I never had a dope name to profess
But relied on my skill when it came to the test
Im blessed in the trade of my native expression
If late is my time, then my rhyme be inte-resting
I question the power of a star
Cause kids be singing love live the king, like my name was Uncle Scar
So, Can you feel the buzz tonight?"
I never mean it in a blunt way, cause some say that theyre the fliest when the drums play
Theyre bound to go down just like morale on hump day
Cause once they front, an omen will hunt theyre ass down in my name
Cause I box out them niggas thats surrounding my game
In any way shape or form
I did circles on those who werent breaking the norm
And Im the first to try angles that you aint figured before
Youve forged on more lines than my written signature
And my shitll be hitting for sure upon the canvas
I planned this tonight so you might understand this
