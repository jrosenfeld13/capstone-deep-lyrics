How many A&R men does it take to change a light bulb?
I'll get back to you on that
How many spells and dollars does it take to make the magic
Of pulling legends from a hat
Well we'll take another sucker for another sell
Regarding them with compliments and muskatelle
A honeymoon in Vegas in a plush hotel
For that's a sad time in the morning light

How many bullets in the back does it take to kill a singing cowboy?
And how much more of this bullshit can you take
From the charming ever
When your making with the on the dotted line
Devil's in his heaven and your hair sublime
Fit them off to Sodom and the big bells chime
But it's only on the wah-wah wind

And they're serving up your future with a twist of lime
Baiting you in Dallas for the perfect crime
And you're scratching off the silver for a nail of grime
And pissing in the bitter wind

Last month's cover you passed You sell that date and your days are numbered

What is your shelf life?
