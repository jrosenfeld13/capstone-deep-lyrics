A-whisper to me quiet
A-whisper to me loud
A-whisper to me morning
A-whisper to me proud
The only thing you remember
Is you only whisper to me
I said the only the you remember
Is you only whisper to me
Or I'll make you ???
Whisper to me quiet
A-whisper to me loud
A-whisper to me later
A-whisper to me now
The only thing you remember
Is you only whisper to me
I said the only the you remember
Is you only whisper to me
Or I'll make you ???
There is no sun for me
There is no sun for me
There is no sun for me
There is no sun for me
There is no sun for me
There is no sun for me
There is no sun for me
There is no sun for me
There is no sun for me
There is no sun for me
There is no sun
There is no sun
