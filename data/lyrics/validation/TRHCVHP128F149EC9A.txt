I'd like to see
You reach your peak
And feel the beat
That gets to me

I'd like to see
You reach that sunny day
I hope you can achieve
All of the things you say
But if you don't make it
Don't give up, just fake it
You're not whipped yet
A-come on and try and forget
I'd like to see
You reach your peak
And feel the beat
That gets to me
You occupy
Your time with such silly things

Do you have to go
Everytime a phone rings
And when you don't get
What you want, don't fret
You know it's coming, baby
Relax and stop your running
I'd like to see
You reach your peak
And feel the beat
That gets to me
(I'd like to see you reach your peak)
(And feel the beat that gets to me)
If you really wanna reach your peak
You better follow me because I'm reachin', hey, hey
Hey hey, I feel the rhythm, baby
Yes, I'm reachin' my peak
(I'd like to see you reach your peak)
I'm reachin' my peak, I'm reachin' my peak
(And feel the beat that gets to me)
I'm reachin' my peak, I'm reachin' my peak, yeah
(I'd like to see you reach your peak)
Woo
(And feel the beat that gets to me)
