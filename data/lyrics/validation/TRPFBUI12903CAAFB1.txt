There's something 'bout that boy that's strange to see
He doesn't look like you, he doesn't look like me
I've been meaning to tell ya, please don't go wild
There's a possibility that he's not your child
'Cause

I made love to your father, love to your brother
Once or twice, I slept with your mother
There has to be a father, it could be you
Or half of the creatures down the local zoo

You wear tartan pyjamas an' socks in bed
Couldn't be more for him if you were dead
If I mention sex, all you do is frown
That's why I sometines have to sleep around

I made love to your father, love to your brother
Once or twice, I slept with your mother
There has to be a father, it could be you
Or half of the creatures down the local zoo
Yeah

Got green scaly skin and a pair of horns
I knew that there was something wrong as soon as he was born
I've been wracking my brain trying to think of a father
Who's a cross between a goat and an iguana

I made love to your father, love to your brother
Once or twice, I slept with your mother
There has to be a father, it could be you
Or half of the creatures down the local zoo

I made love to your father, love to your brother
Once or twice, I slept with your mother
There has to be a father, it could be you
Or half of the creatures down the local zoo

Half of the creatures down the local zoo
Half of the creatures down the local zoo
