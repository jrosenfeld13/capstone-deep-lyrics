Modern architecture
Already left to decay
You dont know what youre breathing in
What it is, I couldnt say

Well meet in Russian Literature
Fourth Floor midday
Travelling Trans-Pennine
She said shed wait

More empty buildings for invisible men
No market value to justify the price of the rent
Ignorance isnt bliss
Familiarity still ends in contempt
Were gonna need some time
But she said shed wait for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you hopeful or just gullible?
Are you hopeful or just gullible?

[Chorus]
She wont be saved
We cant be saved
I cant live my life being nervous about tomorrow
I already knew her name
I already knew her name

Theres a news blackout cause it just got worse
Status depends on the size of your purse
There it is again  that lock of hair that wont sit still

Our earthly pleasures
Distract us against our will

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
We wont be saved
She cant be saved
I cant live my life feeling nervous about tomorrow
I already knew her name
I already knew

[Chorus]
She wont be saved
We cant be saved
I cant live my life feeling nervous about tomorrow
I already knew her name
I already knew
Well, I knew her name
