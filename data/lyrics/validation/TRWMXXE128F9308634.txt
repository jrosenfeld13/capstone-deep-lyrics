"There must be some kind of way out of here"
Said a joker to the thief
"There is too much confusion, I can't get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plow men dig my earth
None with a level on the vine
Nobody out of it is worth, hey
"No reason to get excited", the thief he kindly spoke
"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I we've been through that
And this is not our fate, so let us stop talk falsely now
The hour is getting late"
All along the watchtower, princess kept the view
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants too
Outside in the cold distance, a wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching and the wind began to howl
