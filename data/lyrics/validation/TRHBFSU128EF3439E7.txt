I could escape this feeling with my china girl
I feel a wreck without my little china girl
I hear her heart beating, loud as thunder
Saw their stars crashing

I'm a mess without my little china girl
Wake up in the morning where's my little china girl
I hear her heart beating, loud as thunder
Saw their stars crashing down

I feel tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my china girl
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my china girl

I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the white of my eyes

And when I get excited
My little china girl says
Baby just you shut your mouth
She says "sh-sh-shhh"
She says "sh-sh-shhh"
