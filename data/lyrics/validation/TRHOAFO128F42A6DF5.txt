Forty winks in the lobby, make mine a G&T
Then to our favorite hobby, searching for an enemy
Here in our paper houses, stretching for miles and miles
Old men in stripy trousers rule the world with plastic smiles

Good or bad, like it or not
It's the only one we've got

I won't let the sun go down on me
I won't let the sun go down
I won't let the sun go down on me
I won't let the sun go down

Mother nature isn't in it, three hundred million years
Goodbye in just a minute, gone forever, no more tears
Pinball man, power glutton, vacuum inside his head
Forefinger on the button, is he blue or is he red

Break your silence if you would
Before the sun goes down for good

I won't let the sun go down on me
I won't let the sun go down
I won't let the sun go down on me
I won't let the sun go down

I won't let the sun go down on me
I won't let the sun go down

I won't let the sun go down on me
I won't let the sun go down
I won't let the sun go down on me
I won't let the sun go down
