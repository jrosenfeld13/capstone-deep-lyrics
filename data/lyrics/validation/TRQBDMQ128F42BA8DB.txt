Well, I ride on a mail train, baby
Cant buy a thrill
Well, I been up all night
Leanin' on the windowsill
Well, if I die
On top of the hill
And if I dont make it
You know my baby will

Dont the moon look good, mama
Shining through the trees?
Dont the brakeman look good, mama
Flaggin' down the Double E?
Dont the sun look good
Goin' down over the sea?
But dont my gal look fine
When shes comin' after me?

Now the wintertime is coming
The windows are filled with frost
I went to tell everybody
But I could not get across
Well, I want to be your lover, baby
I dont want to be your boss
Dont say I never warned you
When your train gets lost
