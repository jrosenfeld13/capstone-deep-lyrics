Where have you gone?
How Does time pass by so fast
Seems like yesterday
You and I
We Could Relate
But you know how things change
But is it me? Or is it time?
Now I'm stuck looking back
On something that I'll never have again

All this time with regret
I Just Lost Today
Worrying about yesterday

Can't live in yesterday

All this time with regret
I lost today
Worrying about yesterday
I lost today
And No I'll never forget about you
I lost today
I just came to terms that I've lost you

On with my life
