Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do
Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do to you

You're in love
Your heart's a flutter and all day long
You only stutter
Cuz your poor tongue
Just will not utter the words
"I love you"

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Wait a while
Just a little moonbeam comes peepin' through

You'll get bold
You can't resist her
And all you'll say
When you have kissed her is

Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do
