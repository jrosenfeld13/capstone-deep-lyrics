Will there be enough water
When my ship comes in?
Will there be enough water
When my ship comes in?
Will there be enough water
When my ship comes in?
And when I set sail
Will there be enough wind?
And when I set sail
Will there be enough wind?
And when I set sail
Will there be enough wind?
Cool water
And the cool wind
Just because you caught me
Does that make it a sin?
Just because you caught me
Does that make it a sin?
Cool water
And the cool wind
Will there be enough water
When my ship comes in?
Will there be enough water
When my ship comes in?
And when I set sail
Will there be enough wind?
Cool water
And the cool wind
Just because you caught me
Does that make it a sin?
Just because you caught me
Does that make it a sin?
