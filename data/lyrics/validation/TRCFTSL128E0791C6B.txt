Found a little piece of nothing and I clung on
Because even nothing feels like something
When something's gone

It's summertime
On the planet helpless
You gotta save yourself
Don't wanna scarlet necklace

Say what you mean
Mean what you say
Say what you feel
Feel what you say

Found the head of a marble angel
Down Sadness Glade
For the sins of my long-gone fore-fathers
I've surely paid

Your eyes are blue
They're just like Minton china
Keep doing what you do
And you'll be non the wiser

Say what you mean
Mean what you say
Say what you feel
Feel what you say
