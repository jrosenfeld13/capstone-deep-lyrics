What you gonna do, when guests drop in on you?
We won't go away, 'cos we've come out to stay

Stand there like parked cars if you want to
We can't force you to enjoy this music
Take it or leave it we'll carry on regardless
If you don't like it you don't have to use it

It's up to you, up to you
It's up to you, up to you
It's up to you, up to you
It's up to you, up to you

Looks like a case of the blind leading the deaf to me
You must be bored out of your pants
Take it or leave it we'll carry on regardless
If you don't like it you don't have to dance

It's up to you, up to you, black
It's up to you, up to you, white
It's up to you, up to you, unite
It's up to you, up to you, or fight

In London town you can hear the youth them say "Take warning"
It's up to you what you really wanna do
For you were standing on the corner giving trouble
When the policeman come he say you have to move on the double, yeah
So, steppin' up the street with my little rude girl
With her 'stay-pressed' to her ankles
It's up to her what she really wants to do
It's up to you, you and strictly you and you

What you gonna do, when morons come for you?
They won't go away, they want the whole world painted grey

It's up to you, up to you
It's up to you, up to you
It's up to you, up to you
It's up to you, up to you
