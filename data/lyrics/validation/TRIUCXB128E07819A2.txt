I can't stand by, see you destroyed
I can't be here and watch you burning
You lie for a moment, you lie as a decoy
Does it matter if I give in easy
So why is it so hard to get by?

And I said
We so down
But it's now or never, baby
We don't mind
If this don't last forever
See the light
But it won't last forever
Seize the time
Cause it's now or never, baby

Let's leave at sunrise
Let's live by the ocean
I don't mind if we never come home at all
Let's steal the morning and
Set in motion
In and out of love and institutions
Cause I know this can't last for long

And I said
We so down
But it's now or never, baby
We don't mind
If this don't last forever
See the light
But it won't last forever
Seize the time
Cause it's now or never, baby

So why, is it so hard to get by?

We so down
And this can't last forever
We don't mind
Cause it's now or never, baby
