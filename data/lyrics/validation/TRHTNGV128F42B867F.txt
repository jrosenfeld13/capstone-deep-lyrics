I need a beginning again
I want to feel how I used to feel
When everything was in the palm of my hand
And you where here with me
Ya know I just don't get it ya know I really don't get it at all
That you would leave so sudden
Well did you know you would leave me all alone?

I think we've fallen apart I don't know where I should start. You left me here to be broken hearted

Some days I wonder where I would be
Cos I don't think it was waisted time
I always thought you'd be waiting for me
And now I'm facing the world alone
Ya know I just don't get it ya know I really don't get it at all
That you would leave so sudden
Well did you know you would leave me all alone?

I think we've fallen apart I don't know where I should start. You left me here to be broken hearted

I wonder what you are doing today
I wonder if you could've ever changed
I wonder if you still think of me, the way that it was, the way that it used to be

I need a bgginning again
I think we've fallen apart I don't know where I should start. You left me here to be broken hearted
