I wish I knew how
It would feel to be free
I wish I could break
All the chains holdin' me

And I wish I could say
All the things that I should say
Say 'em loud, say 'em clear
For the whole world to hear

I wish I could share
All the love that's in my heart
Remove all the doubts
That keep us apart

And I wish you could know
What it means to be me
Then you'd see and agree
That every man should be free

I wish I could give
All I'm longin' to give
And I wish I could live
Like I'm longin' to live

And I wish I could do
All the things that I can do
Though I'm way over due
I'd be startin' a new

Well, I wish I could be
Like a bird up in the sky
How sweet it would be
If I found I could fly

Oh, I'd soar high to the sun
And I'd look down at the sea
Then I'd sing 'cause I know
Yes, I sing 'cause I know

I sing 'cause I know
I know how it feels
Yes, I know how it feels
