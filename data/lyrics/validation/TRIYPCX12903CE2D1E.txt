I sit in the late afternoon with my back turned towards the sun
Drifting off in memories to a day when I was young
Slipping into the darkness, across the gulf stream a warm breeze blows
I can smell your sweet perfume, feel the sand beneath my toes

Oleanna, I hear your voice at night
Calling me to come to you and splash in the moonlight
Oleanna, down beside the sea
You're a dream this dreamer keeps waiting there for me

I awake from the dream just as the sun slides to the sea
Slipping under the ocean like the way you went from me
Ooh, the waves crashed and I heard your call, felt the emptiness within
I had love I thought I'd lost but soon I'll hold you again

Oleanna, I hear your voice at night
Calling me to come to you and splash in the moonlight
Oleanna, down beside the sea
You're a dream this dreamer keeps waiting there for me

I can feel you, I can touch you, I can hold you, yes, you're waitin' there for me
I can feel you, I can touch you, I can hold you, yes, you're waitin' there for me
Oleanna, waitin' there for me

Oleanna, I hear your voice at night
Calling me to come to you and splash in the moonlight
Oleanna, down beside the sea
You're a dream this dreamer keeps waiting there for me

I can feel you, I can touch you, I can hold you, yes, you're waitin' there for me
I can feel you, I can touch you, I can hold you, yes, you're waitin' there for me
