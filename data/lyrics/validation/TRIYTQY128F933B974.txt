Give me rain
Fertile days
Open sky, open sky
Give me wind
'cross my face
Fossil, I, fossil, I
Between the layers of earth we sit
Two small creatures caught in grit
We saw sky - we will again
When moved by glacier or hand of man
Fossil, I, fossil, I
Caught in dirt, caught in dirt
I can read the years in stripy earth
Fossil, I
