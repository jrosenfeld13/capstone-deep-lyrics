God damn let's hit it on the weak spot
Everybody knows that we all had enough
Smell the scent of gasoline fumes cause we're not victims and we know what to do
Right now a systematic shutdown of new world orders and restructuring plans
Hold tight cause here comes the latest craze i've got news baby and this is what i say
Yeah, a new morning, the weather's changing
God damn let's build a new movement, dead time pacifies so let's do it
This time all these slogans will come alive, we're not going to be bored this time
Right now a systematic shutdown of neo-liberals and assorted clowns
So strike the match and baby clench your fist
Here comes a party that we don't want to miss
Yeah, a new morning, the weather's changing
Hey, independence, we are playing a little game, i said
Hey, independence, we have got it on the way
