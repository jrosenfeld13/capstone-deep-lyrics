Pay me a dollar for my sweat and my blood
With callus hands, I work the land in the pain and the mud
I take pride in what I do, to serve is my own joy
I will work hard for you 'cause I'm an all American boy

Let's go

Pay me a dollar for my sweat and my blood
With callus hands, I work the land in the pain and the mud
I take pride in what I do, to serve is my own joy
I will work hard for you 'cause I'm an all American boy

I say hey, for my lazy work today
And that's right, I'll be working through tonight
I say hey, I found a better way
And that's right, I'll be working through tonight, I say hey

Pay me a dollar for my sweat is my pay
I live to work, it's fun I shirk, to me there's no other way
My life's the job, I won't be a slob, my family time can wait
Listen here, my darling dear, to die on the job is my fate

I say hey, for my lazy work today
And that's right, I'll be working through tonight
I say hey, I found a better way
And that's right, I'll be working through tonight, say hey

I say hey, and that's right
I say hey, and that's right
I say hey, and that's right
I say hey, and that's right, I say hey
