One thing I have learned out on the highway
In every town there's a friends I'm bound to see
We went down to Tuscan, Arizona
(That's Right)
And there he was just waiting 'round for me
Thank you Lord, for Jack Daniels
Thank you Lord for saving me
The only thing that keeps me from the devil
Is another glass of that good old Tennessee
Barkeep won't you pour me a stiff one
'Cause me and the boys are gonna get fucked up tonight
You keep 'em coming
My towns a' running'
We ain't got nothing better to do
Than look at the girls climbing on the train with you
Thank you Lord for Jack Daniels
Thank you Lord for saving me
The only thing that keeps me from the devil
Is another glass of that Tennessee

Cut me off if you think I've had too many
Cause they're going down just way too easily
It's been a long time since I've seen the face of Jesus
But tonight I see him sitting right here with me
Thank you lord for Jack Daniels
Thank you Lord for saving me
The only thing that keeps me from the devil
Is another glass of that good old Tennessee
Thank you lord for Jack Daniels
Thank you lord for saving me
The only thing that better than Jack Daniels
Is drinking my Jack Daniels for free
