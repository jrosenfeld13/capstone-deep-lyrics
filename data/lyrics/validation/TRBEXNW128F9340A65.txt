I am a species born to die
Understanding this, I hardly cry
Growin' up and out, I'll marry you
I'll bear your kids and be your mama too cause

Cause I'm a woman and I'm a backbone
I'm a woman and I'm a backbone
Everybody needs one

Goin' on I live from day to day
Give a little heart for my life to pay
Smile and then I need to cry
Never knowin' if I lie (or die)

Cause I'm a woman and I'm a backbone
I'm a woman and I'm a backbone
Everybody needs one

Understand you will not see me down
Both of my feet are on the ground
Come lay your head upon my chest
I'll love you hard, I'll give my best
