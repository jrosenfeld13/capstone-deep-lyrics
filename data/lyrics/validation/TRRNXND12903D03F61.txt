Now my old friend Harry
Never slowed down and married
He's in sails, gone most of the year
And he smiles through all his lies
With dollar signs in his lies
And orders himself another beer

Now harry, he's a dreamer, a scholar and a schemer
But he'll be there for you when push comes to shove
His momma called him Harold
He was one of two women that Harry ever loved
The other was a waitress in Cave Creek Arizona
That broke his heart and tangled up his mind

My old friend Harry is looking kind of scary
Wonders if he's running out of time

Now Belux?s got a sadness
Like a dark day in December
That Harry recognizes
In all forgotten Southern towns
Thumbing through the phone book
For a name he can't remember
Looking desperate like a junkie
Waiting for a fix to come around

Sitting playing Black Jack with a hooker and a tourist
And a one eyed dealer winning every round
Harry sips black label, slumps down at the table
Feeling like a fraction of a man
Feeling like a fraction of a man
