Spring break, bamboo bills, the sun was a-smoulderin' hot
We looked like two lobsters washed up huntin' a place to cool off
I slid my Red Stripe over next to her Corona an' lime
Buffett in the background, laughed until sundown, danced until closin' time

Over two bottles of beer, we watched the sun disappear
I knew I thought she was cool an' could tell she dug me
I could go on about that first kiss, but it really all started with
Two bottles of beer in Biloxi

Gulf breeze, Mississippi moon, a billion stars above
Half a mile down the beach from that little Tiki hut
Stopped in our tracks when we found out we both went to school at UT
Only catch was, I was from Texas an' she was from Tennessee

Over two bottles of beer, we watched the sun disappear
I knew I thought she was cool an' could tell she dug me
I could go on about that first kiss, but it really all started with
Two bottles of beer in Biloxi

By the time the tide had rode in an' rode out
We were bridgin' the gap between two college towns

Over two bottles of beer, we watched the sun disappear
I knew I thought she was cool an' could tell she dug me
I could go on about that first kiss, but it really all started with
Two bottles of beer in Biloxi
Over two bottles of beer in Biloxi
