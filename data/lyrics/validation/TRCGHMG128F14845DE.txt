The curtain is dropping
I Stand in the fading lights of my summer
My heart is breaking
As the happiest time of my life is ending
I never laughing
Only forgetting
As I lose my memory
The sun is for the last time setting
All the time it takes
My whole life would never last that long
It's sad but it's true so I must get on
With my short life meandering on and on
Into inexistance
Now I'm dreaming
Of someone so precious
The world's too cruel to
Hold her in its arms and hatefully break her
Now I'm leaving
Standing at the front door for the last time
I was coasting in a dream world
But smiling faces are no more
All the time it takes
My whole life could never last that long
It's sad but it's true so I must get on
With my short life meandering on and on
Into inexistance
If you're coasting
If you're sailing
If you're dreaming
You can be my friend we can dream together
If you're coasting
If you're smiling
If you're nowhere
Hide your face till no one's looking
All the time it takes
My whole life could never last that long
It's sad but it's true so I must get on
With my short life meandering on and on
Into inexistance
I try so hard
But I can never have her back again
I lost it all and she heard me cry
And she knows so well
That it's sad but it's true so I must get on
With my short life been gathering on and on
Into inexistance
If you like me
If you're like me
If you're coasting
I will dream with you
