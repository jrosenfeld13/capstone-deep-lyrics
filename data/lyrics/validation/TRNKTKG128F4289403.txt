I was waiting for something
Maybe flying machines
That's when I found Lili
The best I've ever seen

Put her on the ceiling
Try to make her my own
People line up to see
But there never seems to be enough space

I was waiting for something
Maybe flying machines
That's when I found Lili
Best I've ever seen

Put her on the ceiling
Try to make her my own
People line up to see
But there never seems to be enough space, space, space , space

Space, space, space , space
Space, space, space , space
Space, space, space , space
