[Verse 1]
I've been all pinched up since Saturday
I've run myself dry of excellence
16 long years in-hale the bullshit in
Whatever I said on Saturday
Whatever I did
I'd do it all again
19 marks up walls
Each year one short fall

[Chorus]
Tiny voices, make things harder
Everybody will be let down
Everybody will be let down

[Verse 2]
What is this for ex-parking lot
The dreamers go by they never stop
20 plus 5 in let the youth cave in

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Tiny voices make things harder
Tiny voices make things harder
Everybody will be let down
Everybody will be let down
Everybody will be let down
Everybody will be let down
