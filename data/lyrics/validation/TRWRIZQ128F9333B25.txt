Sitting here thinking about you and me
It's a crying shame 'cause it's plain to see
You made me love you so bad
You made me love you so bad
You made me love you so bad
Too bad you're no good

You smile like an angel
Lie like a rug
You wouldn't change if you could
'Cause it's in your blood

You made me love you so bad
You made me love you so bad
You made me love you so bad
Too bad you're no good

Oh, midnight knocking
You're dropping around
Trash talking is talking me down
You better watch out
When you pull that stuff
Fun is fun
But enough is enough
Oh, yeah

Call the preacher
Call the police
With a man like you
It's famine or feast

You made me love you so bad
You made me love you so bad
You made me love you so bad
Too bad you're no good

Hit it, boys
Mmmm

Ah, well
I talked to your mother
She knows I tried
I talked to your brother
He was on my side

The hardest thing
I have to comprehend
Is if I had to do it over
I'd do it again
Yeah, yeah

Call the preacher
Call the police
With a man like you
It's famine or feast

You made me love you so bad
You made me love you so bad
You made me love you so bad
Too bad you're no good
You made me love you so bad, bad, bad
Too bad you're no good
You just ain't no good

Oh, you fast talking
Slow walking
Two timing man
Ow
Whoo
Mmmmm mmmm

Ah, it's too bad
Yeah, you made me love you so bad
Too bad you're no good
You just ain't no good
Ha ha
