[Verse 1]
Well he's trucking on down from Memphis
Cruisin' down to New Orleans
Tonight he sleeps alone with a Cajun queen
Well there's smoke from the stacks a-blowing
And he don't care where he's going
The only time he feels right is when he's rolling
He's got roadmaps in his hand
Lord, drivin' just as hard as he can
Trying to dodge them scales and the Man
Well I'm talking about
Truck driving man
Yea he'll always give ya, the best that he can

[Chorus]
White cups and coffee, Lord yea
Its all that he needs
And he's all right by me
Truck driving man
Truck on
Truck driver
Shift your gears

[Verse 2]
He's got ladies up in North Dakota
From the Keys man, to Minnesota
And he loves each and every one, least that's what he's told them
Lord, flannel shirts and blue jeans
Truck stops are routine
Tonight he sleeps alone with a Cajun queen
Well I'm talking about
Truck driving man
Yea he'll always give ya, the best that he can

[Chorus]
White cups and coffee, Lord yea
Its all that he needs
And he's all right by me
Truck drivin' man
Guitar
Truck driver

[Verse 3]
Well he's trucking on down from Memphis
Cruisin' down to New Orleans
Tonight he sleeps alone with a Cajun queen
Well there's smoke from the stacks a-blowing
And he don't care where he's going
The only time he feels right is when he's rolling
Well I'm talking about
Truck drivin' man
Yea he'll always give ya, the best that he can

[Chorus]
White cups and coffee, Lord yea
It's all that he needs
And he's all right by me
Truck driving man
I said he's all right by me, truck driving man [x2]
Play the guitar
Truck driver
