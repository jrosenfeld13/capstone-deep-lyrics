Metal nights in the city
Can you feel the heat
The aching in your soul
Silver chains and black leather
And you're breaking out
Of your cage-losing control
Rock- Rock 'till the end
Come make a stand
In Thunderland
Come join the band
In Thunderland
Gimme sweat, gimme power
I want you to rock
Come on, stand up and shout
Stamp your feet, shake your body
Do it all night long
We all like it hard and loud
Rock- Rock 'till the end
Come make a stand....
