[Verse 1]
You don't know what you do to me
Everytime you come around
I can't seem to find my way
I'm shifted baby losing ground
It's like i'm spinning all around in circles
Cure me, you're my remedy
I get dizzy from the sound of your name
I'm just so intoxicated when you spin me baby

[Chorus]
You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
Right round, round, round
You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
Right round, round, round
Round and round

[Verse 2]
I can't help this craving honey
Everytime you look at me
I am feeling so lost in oblivion
That I can't breathe
It's like I'm moving right along with the beat
Want me, you're my melody
I get dizzy from the sound of your name
I'm just so intoxicated when you spin me baby

[Chorus]
You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
Right round, round, round
You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
Right round, round, round
Round and round

[Bridge]
Round and round
Spin, spin me baby
Spin, spin, spin me baby
Round and round
Spin, spin
I get dizzy from the sound of your name
I feel so intoxicated when you spin me baby

[Chorus]
You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
Right round, round, round
You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
Right round, round, round
Round and round

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Like a record baby
