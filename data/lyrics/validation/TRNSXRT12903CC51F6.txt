I was thinking that love had turned its back on me
I was hurting inside in places that you can't see
Then I finally made up my mind just to let it go
That if love didn't want me, I didn't want love anymore

That's when your light came shining
That's when your light came shining
That's when your light came shining on me

Once in a while, it could be any time of the day
I get this deep lonesome feeling that just won't go away
That's when I get to thinking, I'm losing control
And if it's gonna be like this, why should I try anymore?

That's when your light come shining
That's when your light come shining
That's when your light come shining on me

When darkness fall, shadows call and the blues hang around
Around my heart like a chain dragging me down

That's when your light come shining
That's when your light come shining
That's when your light come shining on me

That's when your light come shining
That's when your light come shining
That's when your light come shining on me
