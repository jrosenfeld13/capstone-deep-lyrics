Posing like a statue sitting in my office chair
Typing letters for computer eyes to sorta read
Drifting like an odor now I'm blending in with the air
I'm becoming more and more of what I've got to be

I'm invisible I'm floating floating
Past the homes of the Ozzie and Harriets
Past the plans of moving in next door, cause I'm prepared
I've got it all figured out

Made me out of frosted flakes and television shows
Made me out of frozen shrimp in office party bowls
I metamorphisized cause i have nothing else to do

I'll walk into the crowd to avoid becoming you

I'm invisible I'm fading fading
Into sacrifice that doesn't stand for anything
Do not disturb this state of unconsciousness
I'm safe in here, becoming part of everyone everyone everyone everyone!

I'm invisible I'm fading fading
Into sacrifice that doesn't stand for anything
Do not disturb this state of unconsciousness
I'm safe in here, becoming part of everyone
