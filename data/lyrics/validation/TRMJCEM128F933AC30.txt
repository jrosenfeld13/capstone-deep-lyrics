Out past the Levy County line
Coffee black Suwannee River blends into the coast
Gushing water crimson copper boil
I grew up there the bottom of the swimming hole

Fresh blood comes rushing back to me
I never thought I'd remember all of this
Oh dear me

It's a trick of the mind
It's a trick of the mind
Mind mind
It's a trick of the mind
Mind mind

Ready, set, dive again
Open up your mask let the water clean your glass
Find the sunken union boat
Find the 1955 Dr. Pepper can

Fresh blood comes rushing back to me
I never thought I'd remember all of this
Oh dear me

It's a trick of the mind
It's a trick of the mind
It's a trick of the mind
Mind mind
It's a trick of the mind
Mind mind
It's a trick of the mind
Mind mind
