Don't ask me what I'm doing
There's no career that I'm pursuing
I'm not even gonna try
Now you might say I'm lazy
But the truth's a little hazy
And you know I wouldn't want to live a lie

'Cos I'm not even
I'm not even
I'm not even going to try

I ain't got a plan on paper
Of a darin' little caper
You know I wouldn't want to wet your eyes
Now you might say I'm sluggish
But that's a load of rubbish
Who says you've got to work until you die

Chorus

I hope that you understand
What it means to me
Just to live a lovely life
That is prospect free

Chorus

So when my Auntie Mable
Says David have you laid the table
I'm not even gonna try
And when a friend of mine
Says David have you got the time
I'm not even going to
Pull my shirt sleeve up
And when I see a nutter
Lying in the gutter
I'm not even going to try

Cos we're not even we're not even
We're not even going to try

From my head right down
To my Silver Boots TM
I'm gonna sell my story
To whoever it suits
Cos we're not even we're not even (whisper)
We're not even going to try (whisper)
