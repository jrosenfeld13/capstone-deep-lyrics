Been this way for almost all my life
Wasn't born here Mom & me moved here when I was 5
These Kansas City boys are dull as butter knives

Had this little car since I was 17
The tape is busted got a boom box in the back seat
Blasting Misfits all up & down these streets

To stay the same to never change
To stay the same to never change

The college kids in KC all leave in the fall
Don't have time for letters or long distance calls
If friend you leave then friend you're dead to me

Mom's been sick now for a long time
She says she hopes I'll want a family after she's died
She says the less you feel like a child
The more you'll want a child

To stay the same to never change
To stay the same to never change
To stay the same to never change
To stay the same to never change
