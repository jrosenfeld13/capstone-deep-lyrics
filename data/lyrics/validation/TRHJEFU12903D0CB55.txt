[Intro: David A. Stewart]
Hey, good morning
Hey, it's calling
Hey, good morning
Watch the sun come up
It's calling
I want another day with you

[Verse 1: Example]
How can I explain it? Scratching my brain
How can 10 hours feel like 10 years?
I cry 10 men's tears as it disappears
Along with the passionate atmosphere
Took your glove as a souvenir
Left the other on the pillow as I stroked your ear
One last breath of your hair, stared for a second
Then the doorway beckoned
See I'm a lover not a fighter
So I didn't fight the fact that I more than liked ya
Didn't matter we were under influence
Made sense this was more than lust
I don't own you, you don't own me
One night only, if only
I could take you back and just show you off
But I guess if I did that, the magic is lost

[Pre-Hook: Example]
Believe me I wanna stay
But I'm off and away

[Hook: David A. Stewart]
Hey, good morning
Watch the sun come up
It's calling
I want another day with you

[Verse 2: Example]
You and that red dress - what a pairing
I kept staring, you couldn't have said less
Can't let my head rest, thinking about ya
Really wanna look into your catwoman eyes
Turn back time, cause it flies by
You know, them Marty mcfly vibes
See, I can picture the bright lights
Sights and night skies and boats go by
I don't why it happened so fast
When I tried to speak your language I'm happy you laughed
Cause I'm hardly a linguist
Spoke through kisses you didn't speak English
And It was hard to distinguish
Love at first sight or holiday romance?
Don't care I was lost in the moment
I really shoulda missed that flight

[Pre-Hook: Example]
Believe me I wanna stay
But I'm off and away

[Hook: David Stewart]
Hey, good morning
Watch the sun come up
It's calling
I want another day with you

[Bridge: Example]
I don't think I could be dreaming I felt your touch
No I remember you breathing when I woke up
Now all I have are these memories I can't trust
Just one day, won't be enough

[Hook: David Stewart x2]
Hey, good morning
Watch the sun come up
It's calling
I want another day with you

Hey, good morning
Watch the sun come up
It's calling
I want another day with you
