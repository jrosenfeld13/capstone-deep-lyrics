What's the point in knowing?
What's the use in going on
If all you do is nothing?
What is it you're showing
To all the people looking on?
Leaving us with nothing
Just a voice with no sound
What's holding you down?

Rise against!
Rise up for what is right!
Stand alone!
Are you willing to try?
Rise against!
Stand up for what is right!
One man alone!
Are you willing to die?

What's the point in living?
What's the use in moving on
If you keep pretending
Like there's nothing wrong?
What is it you're giving
To all of us who wait and hope
For someone we can follow?
If you lead i'll go
But only you know

[Chorus]
What's the point in knowing
If all you do is nothing?
What's the point in living
If you keep pretending?
If you lead i'll go
But only you know
