Head down
Are we there yet
Ever drive a ways
Seems so much shorter the way home
Eyes wide open but barely awake
Do you think that it would have been better
Do you think

Maybe we would be
Better off together
On the other hand
Sure it would hurt to see
Different faces for a change

You know
So why don't you say so
And slow down
Right now
'cause we just stand here saying nothing
Going no where
What do we know

Add a faster verse
It seemed more compelling
And I guess that's what they sold us on
Is this what we wanted
Back when we started
We're right back where we started

You know
So why don't you say so
And slow down
Right now
'cause we just stand here saying nothing
Going nowhere
What do we know

Is this what you wanted
We're right back where we started
Is this what you wanted
We're right back where we were
