You said what I thought you would
You're better than everyone else around
You keep score

It's sad that I heard that thing before
Time will tell, it's gonna tell us more
You're crazy, lazy

It won't be long till you know you're wrong
By then, she'll be gone and you'll miss her
And you'll miss her
Too late to start again
Now you won't have no friends
And it's over, and you're alone

You've never been one to take the blame
It's never yours, it's someone else's fault
You say

You've been so predictable
But once again, you've ended up
The fool

It won't be long till you know you're wrong
By then, she'll be gone and you'll miss her
And you'll miss her
Too late to start again
No you won't have no friends
And it's over, and you're alone
