Blood on the sidewalk
Washing down the drain
Rushing around the crime scene
To hide behind the stain
Hide behind the pain

Blue-colored lady
Black eye behind the shades
It's funny how the players
They can't survive the game
I'll survive the game

Rule maker, dream taker
Numbers on a sheet
The execution, the grand delusion
Success is not so sweet

Damaged for the first time
Who knew it'd be you?
You could try to save me
And I'll try to save you
Try to save you

Dealmaker, heartbreaker
Numbers on a sheet
The wild confusion, the strange delusion
Success is not so sweet
Success is not so sweet

You want a baby, I know you do
I'll be your baby
And I'll take care of you
I'll take care of you

Widow maker, deal-breaker
The blood runs down the street
The execution, conclusion
Success is not so sweet

Dream faker, pocket shaker
The numbers on a sheet
The execution, the institution
Success is not so sweet
Success is not so sweet
Success is not so sweet
