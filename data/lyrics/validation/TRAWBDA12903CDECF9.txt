Give dust to life, give life to dust
Crusades
Alloyed in a void, I am torn, I am born
Crusades
Ruderal roots tulleric shoots in cahoots
Making life out of death chthonic breath meristem
Jubilee, I am free, so I rise from debris
Other seeds who are weak need a spur so I speak
Every word like a burr, so hoist my voice and rejoice
Just a spark from the dark ignites a thousand to march
So we embark on a drive to split from the stem
Divide out of the clade, a parade to invade
Crusades

Glory to grow as part of a whole
Crusades
We are roots, we are soil, we are leaves, we are souls
Crusades
Broad canopy from the tree, a decree
Blazon to the world we were born to press on
Blank the sky with our kind, make the branches align
Sing the spores to the throng, fill the fields with our song
We are bright in our blight, full of poison and pomp
Molded as one, we will outshine the sun
Spread like vines as we climb, knots that can't be undone
The crusade has begun, turn the many to one

Crusades
Let the blind be led by the dumb
Crusades
The Philistines arrive at the gates
Crusades
Let the brave lie down on their swords
Crusades
The devoted unleash their wrath

One ant is no ant, no branch is a tree
Crusades
Just a part of a plant I gave up to be free
Crusades
Rejoice in the life that I gave to a wave
Of likes that will die and behave all the same
To populate the terrain until all that remains
Is our kind of one mind, evolved and refined
Fall from the crown, I will rot on the ground
Left by the march that moves on as the sound
From their step fades, alone, for a purpose I'm placed
Born again in new roots that will rise from my waste

Not proud of it
Not proud of it
I've wasted a lifetime
Not proud of it

We died, then we're born again
