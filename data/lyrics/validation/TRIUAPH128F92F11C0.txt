I like the way you move
I like the way you groove
I like it
The things you do
I like the way you groove
I like the way you move
I like it
The things you do
Could this be the start of something new
I can't explain the way that I feel
But I like the things that you do
And I don't think I've ever felt this way about anyone else
You're turning me on with the way that you carry yourself
That's why
I like the way you move
I like the way you groove
I like it
The things you do
I like the way you groove
I like the way you move
I like it
The things you do
I haven't felt this way in a while
I don't know what it is you're doing to me
But I like your style
Cause you are one classy lady so I've been told
Cause when I am with you it makes me lose all my self control
I like the way you move
I like the way you groove
I like it
The things you do
I like the way you groove
I like the way you move
I like it
The things you do
Sweet as berries on a vine, yeah
Clouding up the corners of my mind
Lord have mercy on my soul
But to me all the thanks that you do are
Worth your weight in gold
I like the way you move
I like the way you groove
I like it
The things you do
I like the way you groove
I like the way you move
I like it
The things you do
