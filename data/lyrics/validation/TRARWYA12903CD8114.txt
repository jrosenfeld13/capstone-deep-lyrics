"Closer"
My desperation - just look inside my eyes today
Theres no motivation that brings us one step closer
I was the one who put you by my side
And every time I wish that we were closer

All your life I have been around
You dont see me but Im still around

Black celebration - just look inside my heart today
Theres no inspiration always one step closer
I was the one always standing by your side
But every time I wish that we were closer

All your life I have been around
You dont see me but Im still around
All your life I have been around
You dont see me but Im still around

Im talking about a revolution

All your life I have been around
You dont see me but Im still around
All your life I have been around
YOU DONT SEE ME!
