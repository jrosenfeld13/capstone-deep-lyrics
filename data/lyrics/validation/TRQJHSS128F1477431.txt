Remember the day that we first met
How you drove me crazy
But I always knew that we'd connect
It was meant to be
And I, I know the we've got something special
In my heart I know that we, we belong together
All the possibilities

Just as long as we're together
There is nothing that we can't do
There's no door that we can't open
As long as its me and you

Cos we got a special kind of love
We got a special king of love

You make me happy whenever I'm blue
I can count on you
To groove me and release my frustration
And turn it into something good
You give love incredible, so special
Is the love we share and we
We belong together
All the possibilities

They say that nothing lasts forever
But we got it going on
We'll hold on through stormy weather
With a love so strong

Cos we got a special kind of love
Yes, we got a special king of love

You know, you know, you know
That we got a special kind of love
Yes we got that special kind of love

We got a special kind of love
Yes we got a special kind of love

We got a special kind of love
It's a special kind of love (x4)
You make me happy (x3)
You know, you make me happy
You make me happy when I'm blue

We got a special, its a special love (x3)
You know, you know, you know that we
We got a, we got, we got a
Special, its a special love
