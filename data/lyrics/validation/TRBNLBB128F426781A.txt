I woke to the sound of eggs (we want our jobs back)
They woke to the sound of me (we want our jobs back)
Don't give my cousins head (we want our jobs back)
And don't point that thing at me (we want our jobs back)

As the bored victims of domestic violence
Gather by the seashore

Bored

Never mind Russian roll (we want our jobs back)
To hell with freeform spazz (we want our jobs back)
I'm glad your dog is dead (we want our jobs back)
At least we'll get some peace (we want our jobs back)

As the bored victims of domestic violence
Gather by the seashore
Noses pressed against the glass
The horrible truth
The horribillerbillerbiller
