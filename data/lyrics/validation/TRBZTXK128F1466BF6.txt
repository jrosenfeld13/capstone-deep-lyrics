I want you, you, you
All I want is you, you, you
All I want is you

I give you the stars above
The sun on the brightest day
I give you all my love
If you would only say

I want you, you, you
All I want is you, you, you
All I want is you

I give you the stars above
Give you sun on the brightest day
I give you all my love
If you would only say

I want you, you, you
All I want is you, you, you
All I want is you
