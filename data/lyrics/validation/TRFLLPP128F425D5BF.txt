There's a kind of way who love it when I fall
Loves it when I bleed, loves to take control
Must she look that way, take me to the ground
I become the ground, we become the ground
Her dress becomes my thoughts
Her thoughts become a plot
Her touch becomes my fate
Can mercy find a way?
Can mercy find a way?

Find me
An empty me
Well I like you that way
But I cannot stay
Find me
A broken me
Well I like her that way, but I will not stay

There's a certain pain that separates the call
Loves to see me bleed, loves to take control
Must she look that way, take me to the ground
I become the ground, we become the ground
Her dress becomes my thoughts
Her thoughts become a plot
Her touch becomes my fate
Can mercy find a way?
Can mercy find a way?

Find me
An empty me
Well I like you that way but I cannot stay
Find me
A broken me
Well I like her that way but I will not stay

There's a kind of way who love it when I fall
Loves it when I bleed, loves to take control
