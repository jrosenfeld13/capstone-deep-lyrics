If she gets a black eye
I want a black eye
If she gets a splinter
I want a splinter too
If she gets arrested
I want arrested
If she goes tripping
I go falling over

We walk through the streets
Like lottery winners on acid
Everything she say, I was thinking anyway
(Come on girl)

If she likes Gordon's
I like Gordon's
If she likes the black stuff
I like the black stuff too
If she gets a disease
I want a disease
If she goes tripping
I go falling over

We walk through the streets
Like lottery winners on acid
Everything she say, I was thinking anyway

We walk through the streets
Like lottery winners on acid
Everything she say, I was thinking anyway
(Oh Lord, yeah)

If you look and see her now
What would you think of her boy?
What do you think of boy?

We walk through the streets
Like lottery winners on acid
Everything she say, I was thinking anyway

We walk through the streets
Like lottery winners on acid (Like lottery winners on acid)
Everything she say, I was thinking anyway (Everything she say, I was thinking anyway)

We walk through the streets
Like lottery winners on acid Like lottery winners on acid
Everything she say, I was thinking anyway (Everything she say, I was thinking anyway)

We walk through the streets
Like lottery winners on acid Like lottery winners on acid
Everything she say, I was thinking anyway (Everything she say, I was thinking anyway)
