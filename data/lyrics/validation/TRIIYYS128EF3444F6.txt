Up above me
And inside me
All around me and you
Are no victims
And no victories
Just the guilty few

Hey
Here comes my world
And hey
Here comes my real world

Stalking dreams
Through wind and rain
I've sold my heart and soul again

In the window
There's a shadow
Someone borrowed from me
There's a sunset
Low and lonely
On an island
At sea

Hey
Is this my world?
And hey
Is this my real world?

Stalking dreams
Through wind and rain
I've sold my heart and soul again

Up above me
And inside me
All around me
Something aching
Something breaking
Something shaking
In me

Hey
Here comes our world
And hey
There goes my real
Real world
