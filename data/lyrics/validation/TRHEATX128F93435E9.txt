How did my day just go from bad to worse
Lost my cell phone now I'm late for work
Wearing my favorite shoes and the heel broke
Tell me I'm getting punked
This is beyond a joke

I'm so on edge
You'd think I was scared
Of my own shadow
It's days like these
I gotta live by my motto
Get in the car
And turn on the radio
Turn it up turn it up

I like it loud
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I wanna shout
Turn it up turn it up turn it up
Loud
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I wanna shout
Turn it up turn it up turn it up

How many times we had this argument
Why is it that you have to bring it up again
Just yesterday you said you let it go
What's going on inside your head I'll never know

Bout to press play ipod in hand
I got my ear phones in
You'd never know
That I'm not even listening
You're to busy yelling

For you to notice anything
So I hit the volume and turn it up

I like it loud
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I wanna shout
Turn it up turn it up turn it up
Loud
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I wanna shout
Turn it up turn it up turn it up

Alright, everybody ready... here we go

Come on let's bring it on down
Get a bit softer now
Come on lets bring it on down
Get a bit softer now
Let's get louder now
You know I just wanna shout
Lets get louder
Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey

I like it loud
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I wanna shout
Turn it up turn it up turn it up
Loud
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I wanna shout
Turn it up turn it up turn it up
