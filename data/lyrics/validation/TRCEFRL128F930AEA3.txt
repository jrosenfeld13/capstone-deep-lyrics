JANIS MARTIN (RCA 47-6832, 1957)
You never did write, you never did call
You can't blame me for getting tired of it all
I just did what any other girl would do
Found me another boy twice as true
Then I just forgot about you
(dum-doodly-doo, ta-daa)
I'd still be there loving you now
When I thought you cared about me
But I figured by the way you never did write
That I was just a used-to-be
I'd a-been glad to have you back
But I thought you wanted to be free
And I figured by the way you never did call
That you didn't give a hoot about me
Two long years I've waited
Two long years I've cried
I'd a-been a mom, you'd a-been pop
When I found that you'd a-been true
You never did write, you never did call
You can't blame me for getting tired of it all
I just did what any other girl would do
Found me another boy twice as true
Then I just forgot about you
(dum-doodly-doo, ta-daa)
