The tiger waits in the bushes by the lake
But I'll never tear you apart
With a love so pure, our knees will shake
And tremble

There were tracks in the silt where the stream becomes still
...but I'll never rip out your heart
You're such a gentle a beast-
Oh you never got tough
Like I got tough
Like I got tough

The faces in the window -
Oh, they're just my friends
I promise I won't let them in
Oh, they live in the corn
Where they die and they're born -
Where the blades go around
Churn up the ground
To open the over-toild soil
Ooooooooo baby
Ooooooooo baby
Ooooooooo babe

Slashed 'cross the back
Your spine almost snapped
I put three bullets in its face
And I hung it from a tree
For the other ones to see
What happens if
You mess with me
