Brr,uck
Chuck, a-chuck, chuck
Huh, yeah
A summertime
And the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin'
Don't you know my darlin'
I said a-right now
And the cotton is high
Like-a, like-a, like-a
You're daddy's rich
And your mommy's
Good-lookin', yeah
So hush, pretty little baby
Don't you cry
One of these, one of these
One of these morning's, darlin'
You're gonna rise
You're gonna rise up singin'
Then you'll spread
Your little wings, your little wings
And-a take to the ska-da-da-da-dy
Brr, until-a that mornin'
There's nothin' gonna harm you, girl
With mommy and daddy standin' by, yeah
Pretty little darlin'
I said, a-right now
Don't let a tear
Don't let a tear, don't let a tear
Little darlin'
I said, fall a-from your eyes
So hush, pretty baby
Don't, youooo
Brr, ruck
Chuck a-chuck-chuck
Little darlin' do not let a tear
Fall-a from your eyeee, whoa
