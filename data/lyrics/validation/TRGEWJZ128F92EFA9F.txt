Well, I found me
Yes, I found me a full-time lover
Well, I found me
Yes, I found me a full-time lover
Well, she used to be my part-time woman
But she's my full-time lover now
Well, I work the graveyard shift
Seven days a week
I'm so downhearted
I can't hardly even speak
I'll tell you the reason
The reason why I feel this way
I can't find a full-time love
Yes, but I think I found her today
Yes, I found me
Lord, I found me a full-time lover
Well, she used to be my part-time girl, man
But she's my full-time lover now
Well, people you don't know
You don't know the shape I'm in
I ask her where's she goin'
She tells me where she's been
She came home last night
Thought she was goin' back out the door
Then she told me "Baby
I ain't leavin' you no more"
Yes, I found me
Lord, I found me a full-time lover
Well, she used to be my part-time girl, man
But she's my full-time lover now
