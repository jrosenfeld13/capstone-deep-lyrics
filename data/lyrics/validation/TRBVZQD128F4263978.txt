1991, always on the run
Seven years ago we wrote this one
Like Ernest and Julio, before it's time
Sever years later and it's holding up fine
Stupid motherf*ckers like to slug us and dis
But there was no bandwagon when we wrote this
'Cause we stretched our boundaries
We opened the door
That no one attempted before
Five guys in shorts, who gives a shit
We do what we like, we don't care where we fit
All you new jacks, what is it?
You're kidding me, get off our dicks

Now we're Anthrax and we take no shit
And we don't care for writing hits
The sound you hear is what we like
And I'll steal your pop-tarts like I stole your
(Psych!)
Beat the beats the beats you beat
The only thing harder's the smell of my feet
So listen up close or you might get dissed
Go drain the lizard or take a piss...
Watch the beat

I'm on your case, I'm in your face
Kick you and your father back in place
Step off sucker understand
Don't you know
I'm the man

We got real def rhythms and fresh new jams
If ya think we've got egos well we're just hams
Scott plays stickball and likes to skate
Frankie's never on time he's always...
Drinking the drinks, the drinks I drank
I put my money in the bank
They cut their crack, they offer joints
We don't do drugs do you get our meaning...
Point, point, point, point, and watch the beat

For a heavy metal band raps a different way
But we like to be different and not cliche
Well they say rap and metal can never mix
Well all of them can suck our...(dicks)
Fart the farts the farts he farted
I pick my nose but I'm not retarded
Like El Duce says "Smell my anal vapor"
And wipe my butt, with your fuckin' face
You stupid idiot...

Sooooooo, as this rap is winding down
It's plain to see I forgot my crown
You know Anthrax is number one
But we don't care we just wanna have...(party)
Buff the buff the buff he buffed
We are the kings and all shall buff
We're like a diamond, this is forever
And will remain the hardest ever!
