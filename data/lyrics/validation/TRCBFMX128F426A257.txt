Hello again, see you in hell
The way down deep with no believin'
Nowhere to go, nowhere to hide
You can't control your beast inside

Hello again, see you in hell
The way down deep with no believin'
No need to pray, you have to wait
Better choose your way for the final day

You might control your twisted mind
Seek for peace you'll never find
No need to pray, you have to wait
Better choose your way for the final day

Hello again, see you in hell
The way down deep with no believin'
No need to pray, you have to wait
Better choose your way for the final day

[Chorus:]
Nowhere to go, nowhere to hide
You can't control your beast inside

Believe in what you're used to be
Your past will never, never set you free
It makes no sense to run away
You will condemn on judgement day

Hello again, see you in hell
The way down deep with no believin'
No need to pray, you have to wait
Better choose your way for the final day

[Chorus:]
Nowhere to go, nowhere to hide
You can't control your beast inside
