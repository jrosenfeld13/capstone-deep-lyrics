Walking the mountain is easy for the medicine
Man who follows make sure the indian never returns

His revenge
His revenge
Rising
His revenge
His revenge
Rising

Fighting the front line is honor for the pharaoh
In egypt erases the queen the truth the history of her

Her revenge
Her revenge
Rising
Her revenge
Her revenge
Rising

Reading the pages of history its not black and
White is the man with the pen who's writing the story of life

Our revenge
Our revenge
Rising
Our revenge
Our revenge
Rising
