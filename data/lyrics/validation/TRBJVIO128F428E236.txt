I don't like it
This pressing flesh of star sign
German eyes on postage
Where's he gone today?

And I liked it
The way this blood was herself
The sunny skies encircling
Read them new today

And you feel like bite
Like something surfs alive
You feel her bite
Wither now

You feel like I'm alive
Like there's nothing in the black
You feel that guy (guise)
Muscle and dye (Frozen with sound) (x2)

But I liked it
The way this blood would hurt her
The sunny sky in circles
