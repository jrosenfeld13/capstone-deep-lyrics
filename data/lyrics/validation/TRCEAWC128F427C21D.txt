(Solo: Knight)
(Solo: Malone)

Your lowering breath reeks of penance
With blinded eyes and severed tongue
Your foulest words greet the knowledge
With Denial's only son

We are the ones who've chosen silence
Whose blinded eyes can see the truth
We are the ones who've chosen silence
On hopeless winds of stolen grief

The conquest of failure was in the heart of you
By the eyes of winter, denial was renewed

The conquest of failure was in the heart of you
By the eyes of winter, denial was renewed

This is failure's conquest!
This is failure's conquest!
This is failure's conquest!

Your lowering breath reeks of penance
With blinded eyes and severed tongue
Your foulest words greet the knowledge
With Denial's only son

(Solo: Knight)
(Solo: Malone)

Your grief came with the frailest words
Your severed tongue ever spoke
The aura of mourn that once dwelled
Now wears the madness mark!

We are the ones who've chosen silence
Whose blinded eyes can see the truth
We are the ones who've chosen silence
On hopeless winds of stolen grief

The conquest of failure was in the heart of you
By the eyes of winter, denial was renewed
