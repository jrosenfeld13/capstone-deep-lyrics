Oh yeah come on now, oh yeah

Oh yeah come on now, oh yeah
Boy I've been watchin' you
And you've been watchin' me
I know you want me baby
I'm gonna make you see
I'll give you what you need
I know the way ya feel
I'll take ya higher baby
I want you here with me
Everything ya say, everything ya do
Makes me go crazy baby I want you
You have turned me on and that's the way it is
Nothing could be better than this

[Chorus]
I've got my eyes on you
I'm gonna move you
I'm gonna groove you
Tonight is the night
I've got my eyes on you
I know you want me
Nothing can stop me
The feeling is right

[Verse 2]
So now I'm here for you
And you're here for me
I'm gonna show you boy
That we were meant to be
I've never been so sure
And now I want you more
Why don't you give it up I'm going to set you free now
Everything you say, everything you do
Makes me go crazy baby I want you
You have turned me on and that's the way it is
Nothing could be better than this

[Chorus]
I've got my eyes on you
I'm gonna move you
I'm gonna groove you
Tonight is the night
I've got my eyes on you
I know you want me
Nothing can stop me
The feeling is right
I've got my eyes on you
I'm gonna move you
I'm gonna groove you
Tonight is the night
I've got my eyes on you
I know you want me
Nothing can stop me
The feeling is right

[Bridge]
You've got the loving I want
I've got the loving you need
We've got the feeling tonight
You know the feeling is right
Don't you know I go crazy for you baby

Can't you see we were meant to be
Everything you say, everything ya do
Makes me go crazy baby I want you

[Chorus]
I've got my eyes on you
I'm gonna move you
I'm gonna groove you
Tonight is the night
I've got my eyes on you
I know you want me
Nothing can stop me
The feeling is right
