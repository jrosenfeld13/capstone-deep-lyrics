You, you can not take anything away from me
My spirit won't break 'cause there's nothin' left, you see?
You wanna take a'your poison arrow and pierce it through my heart
But my sad song's for the sparrow
I was dead right from the start

I was dead right from the start

I got strength in my mind
I got strength in my soul
And I will never fit, fit into a mold
'Cause, oh, I know me better than you will ever know
So why don't you just a'leave me, please leave me alone

Time, time, time it takes its toll
But at least I still got my soul
And there's nothin' you can do to change that
'Cause that's just the way it is
This a'well's run dry, 'cause I bled right from the start
'Cause I bled right from the start

I got strength in my mind
I got strength in my soul
And I will never fit, fit into a mold
'Cause, oh, I know me better than you will ever know
So why don't you just a'leave me, please leave me alone
Please leave me alone
