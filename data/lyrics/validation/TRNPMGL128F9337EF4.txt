I've stood in time, wind and rain
I have no feelings or name
But I can see, I can hear
The voice of death is shouting in my ear!
Making war, making love
You know what I'm thinking of
How many times the traps are set
You can't remember, and I can't forget!
Can you see me now, can you feel the pain
Can you heal the scars on me
Life within my heart, hope within my soul, is dying!
Bid farewell, the works of men
When cries of anger sound again
My tears of shame, cut like a knife
How can I justify this life!
Can you see me now, can you feel the pain
Can you heal the scars on me
Life within my heart, hope within my soul, is dying!
My mind is searching for reasons why
A time to live or die
If we had now what we had then
Lost horizons might return again...
Can you see me now, can you feel the pain
Can you heal the scars on me
Life within my heart, hope within my soul, is dying!
Lost horizons...
