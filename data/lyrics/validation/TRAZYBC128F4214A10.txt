Buckshot I said to the way of her walk
Stealth mode as I prey
I didn't go slow I'm a gigolov
But she could a changed my ways
Cause the way she smiles and her cool ass style
She was an angel in the devil's clothes
But I'd lose my grip when she'd shake her hips and right now I think she knows
That I'm in deep - I play the game
So many women make me insane
Is she the one to make me tame?
I think not
Cause I get around the block
I get around the block Everyday
I get around the block That's my way
I get around, get around now you do the same
I get around the block so who's 2 blame?
I poke and joke what's up turbo?
She giggles a little but I think she knows
That I'm out to get her - she goes with the flow
Cause she likes to play games with me
So damn sexy in a subtle way
Breakin' me down with everything she say
Make the best man feel he's just O.K
Somebody explain to me
Why was I so hooked? A lock on me
I never let a women walk on me
Will she claim me as her property?
I think not
Cause I get around the block
I get around the block Everyday
I get around the block That's my way
I get around, get around now you do the same
I get around the block so who's 2 blame?
Who's 2 blame - played that game
Always want the girls to know my name
Who's 2 blame - played that game
How can I get mad when she does the same?
My heart is numb with no activity
They never have anything to offer me
I've said before - they're all the same
But now I'm having feelings that I can't explain
Cause she break me, make me feel like I'm gonna go insane
I'm a creep, I sleep around just to kill the pain
And although, now I know she does the same I wonder who's 2 blame?
Who's 2 blame???
I played the game
She does the same
She played that game
So who's 2 blame?
Blame each other for another cheap romance
Us together, no we never had a chance
So who's 2 blame?
