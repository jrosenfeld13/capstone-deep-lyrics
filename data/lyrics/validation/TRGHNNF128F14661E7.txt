[Verse 1]
I keep trying to find a life
On my own, apart from you
I am the king of excuses
I've got one for every selfish thing I do

[Bridge]
What's going on inside of me?
I despise my own behavior
This only serves to confirm my suspicions
That I'm still a man in need of a savior

[Chorus]
I wanna be in the Light
As you are in the Light
I wanna shine like the stars in the heavens
Oh, Lord be my Light and be my salvation
Cause all I want is to be in the Light
All I want is to be in the Light

[Verse 2]
The disease of self runs through my blood
It's a cancer fatal to my soul
Every attempt on my behalf has failed
To bring this sickness under control

[Bridge]
Tell me, what's going on inside of me?
I despise my own behavior
This only serves to confirm my suspicions
That I'm still a man in need of a savior

[Chorus]
I wanna be in the Light
As you are in the Light
I wanna shine like the stars in the heavens
Oh, Lord be my Light and be my salvation
Cause all I want is to be in the Light
All I want is to be in the Light

[Verse 3]
Honesty becomes me (there's nothing left to lose)
The secrets that did run me (in your presence are defused)
Pride has no position (and riches have no worth)
The fame that once did cover me (has been sentenced to this earth)
Has been sentenced to this earth

[Bridge]
Tell me, what's going on inside of me?
I despise my own behavior
This only serves to confirm my suspicions
That I'm still a man in need of a savior

[Chorus]
I wanna be in the Light
As you are in the Light
I wanna shine like the stars in the heavens
Oh, Lord be my Light and be my salvation
Cause all I want is to be in the Light
All I want is to be in the Light

I wanna be in the Light
As you are in the Light
I wanna shine like the stars in the heavens
Oh, Lord be my Light and be my salvation
Cause all I want is to be in the Light (All I want)
All I want is to be in the Light (All I want, all I want)
All I want is to be in the Light
In the Light, in the light (Ooooh)
In the Light, in the light (I want to be, I want to be)
In the Light, in the light (I want to be, I want to be)
In the Light, in the light (I want to be, I want to be)
In the Light, in the light (I want to be, I want to be)
(In the light)

[Outro]
There's no other place that I want to be
No other place that I can see
A place to be that's just right
Someday, someday I'm gonna be in the Light
You are in the Light
That's where I need to be
That's right where I need to be
