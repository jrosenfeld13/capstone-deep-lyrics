Imagine
Imagine yourself
Everywhere you see there are people and the people are smiling
And everyone is having a good time
And the people are loving one another, sharing with one another (What a wonderful world)

Imagine a world
Where there's only peace (This would be), where there's no anger
Where there's no hate, where there's no war (What a wonderful world)

Imagine a world (This would be)
That is full of nothing but love and full of nothing but joy
This world is something that we need!
Imagine!

(Oh, oh!)
What a wonderful, wonderful

Imagine a world with no color
Everyone will respect one another
Imagine a life with no ending
Everyday will be a new beginning

A life that is happy and strong
Full of things that will never go wrong
So come on let's hold, get together
And let's sing this song forever (What a wonderful world)

Oh yes (This would be), this would be
(What a wonderful world) What a wonderful world
(This would be) This would be, this would be, yeah

(What a wonderful world this would be) What a wonderful world
(What a wonderful world) Oh yes! This would be
This would be!
(Hey!)

(Oh, oh!)
This is a song of freedom, of happiness!

(Oh, oh!)
(What a wonderful world this would be, be, be, be)
