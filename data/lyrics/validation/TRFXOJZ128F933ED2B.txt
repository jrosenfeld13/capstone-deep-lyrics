Here comes another fall from grace, I'm always falling on my face
This attitude that I embrace with a love I'm trying to replace
Try to kill this song cause the melody's all wrong
And there's a fever comin' on

It's hard to reconcile what I've become
With the wounded child hiding deep inside

[Chorus]
Breathe underwater, I'm comin' up for air
I wanna see another dawn, comin' up for air
Sick of the slaughter, I'm comin' up for air
Cause I've been floating here too long

Take my ego for a ride cause there's nobody by my side
It's getting hard to justify and it won't be long till I collide
My weakness laid bare as people stop and stare
But it's the last time I swear

It's hard to reconcile what I've become
With the wounded child hiding deep inside

[Chorus]

Stop breathing, stop breathing
Stop breathing, stop breathing

[Chorus]

I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming
Comin' up for air, comin' up for air, comin' up for air
