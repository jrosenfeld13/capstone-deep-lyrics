"Higinia"

[Verse 1:]
If you could stay here for just
A little bit, a little while, a little bit with me
You're what makes me
And if god could keep you with me
I'd trade just about anything

[Chorus:]
You're what makes me want to change things
I would die just to live and yet we all live to die
You're what makes me want to change
You will not die
You will not die
You will not die
You will not die

[Verse 2:]
If you could stay here for just
A little bit, a little while, a little bit with me
You're what makes me
And if god could keep you with me
I'd trade just about anything

[Bridge:]
I'd trade anything...

Take a step further back to where you belong
Take a look at your life what have you become

[Outro:]
I never had the chance to explain myself
I never had the chance to apologize
I never had the chance to explain myself
I never had...

You will not die
You will not die
You will not die
You will not...
