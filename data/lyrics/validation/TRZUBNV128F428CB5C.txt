Orders from authority taken with no doubt
Over everything agreed
Deaf, blind, mute and cold
You're following the mind which is not your own

No plans for tomorrow
When today is just okay
Blinded by the power
You can't notice real from fake

Awesome powers from above, huge force driven by the dumb
How to have a life according these standards around
Seeing everything without even looking, hearing it all, but still
Being deaf
Speaking with a closed mouth, no sympathy towards anything

Obey, obey, you must obey
Who wants to play this game?
Awake, awake, please get awake
From the dead

Authority accepted with no doubt
Over everything agreed
Deaf, blind, mute and cold
You're following the mind which is not your own

Obey, obey, you must obey
Who wants to play this game?
Awake, awake, please get awake
From the dead

Please hold on tight
I'll let you in a little secret:
You'll never achieve a thing
You don't have even a little clue

The unbound powers beyond your dreams
Are to be unleashed
Let your simple mind fly free
Let it breathe even for a small while!

Awesome powers from above, huge force driven by the dumb

Awake, awake, please get awake
From the dead
