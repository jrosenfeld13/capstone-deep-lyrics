Hey-ho, Daddy's home!
Heeeerrrreeee's Johnny!!!
Where did everybody go??!!
Goodbye Chicago
Goodbye Miami skies
"ground control to Major Tom
My soul been psychodelisized..."

They say the grass is greener
On the other side of the fence
And the meat is sweeter
It takes two to do the dance
Man, the girl is a dream!
I ain't seen one like that since...

They say the grass is greener
On the other side of the fence

Well, the girl from New York
Digs Peter Tork and the girls
From Milwaukee do the Walkie-Talkie
Cheerleaders in Atlanta do the
Boom-shagga-lagga, shouting
"V-I-C-T-O-R-Y!!!"
They walk and they walk and
They talk and they talk and
Theywalkandtheywalkandthey
Talkandtheytalkandtheywalkand
Theywalkandtheytalkandtheytalk
All night to get it right, but inside

They say the grass is greener
On the other side of the fence
And the meat is sweeter
It takes two to do the dance
Man, the girl is a dream!
I ain't seen one like that since...

They say the grass is greener
On the other side of the fence
On the other side of the fence
On the other side of the fence

Jimmy's dad says
"son, there's a small hotel
Two high on Ten High
And Chantilly. Man! I love the
Smell of another man's life
I love the smell of another man's wife
Strike while the iron's hot
I know it's wrong, but I can't stop
I love your mom, but I'm a bum and
Hey, c'mon..."

They say the grass is greener
On the other side of the fence
And the meat is sweeter
It takes two to do the dance
Man, the girl is a dream!
I ain't seen one like that since...
