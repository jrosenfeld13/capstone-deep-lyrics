You've got this spark of imagination
Triggered by boredom
Yet seldom turned to flame
Maybe tonight is, maybe tonight is different
Maybe tonight a bon fire

Oh my god you're right
But you wouldn't go go go anywhere
You wouldn't go

Maybe we'll jump in
In to the fire
Maybe we'll stay here
Away from our own...
You're in love with nothing
You're in love with no one
You're in love with nothing ing ing ing ing ingggggg yeahahahahah

Oh my god you're right
But you wouldn't go go go anywhere
You wouldn't go
Oh my god you're right
But you wouldn't go go go anywhere
You wouldn't go

Ease back, calm down a little
Ease back, calm down
Ease back, calm down a little
Ease back, calm down
Ease back, come down
Ease back, come down

Oh my god you're right
But you wouldn't go go go anywhere
You wouldn't go
Oh my god you're right
But you wouldn't go go go anywhere
You wouldn't go
