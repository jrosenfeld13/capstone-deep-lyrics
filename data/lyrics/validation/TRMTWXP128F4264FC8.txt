(Wade Hayes/Chick Rains)

I drove around last night, and tried with all my might
To leave the past behind, cause you stayed on my mind
So I stopped for a drink, I never stopped to think
That it wouldn't work, It just made it worse
So I came on back home, I hadn't changed a thing
And sat here all alone, missing you and wondering

Where do I go to start all over
From your memory
Where do I go to start all over
When in your arms is where I won't be

I'd take some things and leave, If the change of scenery
Would do me any good, Like I know it should
I'd still be missing you, What goods a different view
To a broken heart, We'd still be apart
Someday I'll find the answer, To this mystery
But tonight the same old question, Just keeps on haunting me

Where do I go to start all over
From your memory
Where do I go to start all over
When in your arms is where I won't be

Where do I go to start all over
When in your arms is where I won't be
