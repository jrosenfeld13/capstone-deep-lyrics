Easy isn't what I'd call this
Who knows what easy means
The more I try to make this happen
The less it's clear to me
The hope that keeps me moving
Is in Your promises to me
And right now that's enough
It's gonna have to be

Sometimes yes, sometimes no
Sometimes that's the way it goes
You're not giving any secrets away
Who's to know, who's to say
Sometimes it's hard to live this way
Holding on, letting go
When it's sometimes yes
And sometimes no

I wanna know just what it looks like
What the answer's gonna be
I wanna grab hold of something
To give me some security
And know it's You I'm hearing
Gently helping me to see
When everything I've prayed for
Is not Your will for me

Sometimes yes, sometimes no
Sometimes that's the way it goes
You're not giving any secrets away
Who's to know, who's to say
Sometimes it's hard to live this way
Holding on, letting go
When it's sometimes yes
And sometimes no

It's not poetic justice
That has me waiting all this while
It's the way a loving father
Deals with his child

So this is how I'm learning
Holding on and letting go
Sometimes yes and sometimes no
It's sometimes yes, sometimes no
