Kick ass little girl going to a party
Eating blue Smarties 'cause she's rock'n'roll
Gonna do some coke and maybe do some poking
Gonna spin some records for a Jack and coke
Wasted little dj filling up the floor
And your records are boring 'cause you're cool as hell
Everybody's flying and everybody's sliding
Slowly suiciding in a tiled cell, in a tiled cell

It's no good time to see your face
No good time to get erased
No good time to sink into the crowd

Graphic designer you could look no finer
In your eyeliner and your silas jeans
Living in the East End with your teenage girlfriend
Everyday's a weekend in a real cool scene
'Cause everybody's flying, slipping and sliding
Slowly suiciding in a tiled cell
And we'll go out together, holding hands forever
Shiny boots of leather looking like Lou Reed, just like Lou Reed

It's no good time to see your face
No good time to feel erased
No good time to sink into the crowd
It's no good time to see your face
No good time to get erased
No good time to suck up your lies

There was no good time to see your face
No good time to get erased
No good time to sink into the crowd
