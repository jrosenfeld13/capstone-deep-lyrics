[Verse 1]
You are
Eighteen year-old girl
Who live in small city of Japan
You heard me on the radio
About one year ago
And you wanted to know
All about me
And my hobbies
My favorite food
And my birthday

[Chorus]
Why are you so far away from me?
I need help
And you're way across the sea
I could never touch you
I think it would be wrong
I've got your letter
You've got my song

[Verse 2]
They don't make stationery like this where I'm from
So fragile, so refined
So I sniff and I lick your envelope
And fall to little pieces every time
I wonder what clothes you wear to school
I wonder how you decorate your room
I wonder how you touch yourself
And curse myself for being across the sea

[Chorus]
Why are you so far away from me?
I need help
And you're way across the sea
I could never touch you
I think it would be wrong
I've got your letter
You've got my song

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
At 10, I shaved my head
And tried to be a monk
I thought the older women would like me if I did
You see, ma
I'm a good little boy (good little boy)
It's all your fault, momma
It's all your fault!

[Verse 3]
Goddamn, this business is really lame
I gotta live on an island to find the juice
So you send me your love from all around the world
As if I could live on
Words and dreams and a million screams
Oh, how I need a hand in mine to feel...

[Chorus]
Why are you so far away from me?
Why are you so far away from me?
I could never touch you
I think it would be wrong
I've got your letter
You've got my song
I've got your letter
You've got my song
