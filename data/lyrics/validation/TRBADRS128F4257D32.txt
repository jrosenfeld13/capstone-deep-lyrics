And after tourniquet fights on my veins
Then I'll begin again
Rhythms are burned from the glare
From the wing on a plane
So without thinking I respond

Look at me now I am out of sight
Carrying a torch but the light ain't that bright

The air dry breeds clear
Thoughts are levelheaded
I'll be no use to my self once when I'm dead
And though I trusted I was lied to by my own
I bare no grouch and I carry no milestone

Look at me now I am out of sight
Carrying a torch but the light ain't that bright

Say you will forget
This pain I won't regret
