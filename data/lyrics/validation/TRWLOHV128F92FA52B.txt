[Chorus 1:]
There's a certain girl
I've been in love with a long, long time
(What's her name?)
I can't tell you
(No)
I can't reveal her name until I've got her
(What's her name?)
I can't tell you
(No)

[Chorus 2:]
Well, I've tried to get her time and time again
We just end up as nothing but friends
And there's a certain girl
I've been in love with a long, long time
(What's her name?)
I can't tell you
(No)

[Verse 1:]
Well, there's a certain chick
I've been sweet on since I met her
(What's her name?)
I can't tell you
(No)
I can't repeat her name until I get her
(What's her name?)
I can't tell you
(No)
Well, one day, I'm gonna wake up and say
"I'll do anything just to be your slave"

[Chorus 1:]
And there's a certain girl
I've been in love with a long, long time
(What's her name?)
I can't tell you
(No)
Well, I've tried to get her time and time again
We just end up as nothing but friends
And there's a certain girl
I've been in love with a long, long time
(What's her name?)
I can't tell you
(No)

[Verse 2:]
There's a certain chick
I've been sweet on since I found her
(What's her name?)
I can't tell you
(No)
I can't reveal her name until I get her
(What's her name?)
I can't tell you
(No)

[Chorus 1:]
Well, now one day, get her time and time again
We just end up as nothing but friends
And there's a certain girl
I've been in love with a long, long time
(What's her name?)
I can't tell you
(No)

[Outro:]
I can't tell you
(No)
I can't tell you
(No)
I can't tell you
