Hypocrite we had a deal
Nothing ever fucking real
Never tust the outsider
It's proven once ggain
You can say what you wanna say
No forgiveness no mercy
Or you can just go straight to hell
No forgiveness no mercy

It was nothing but a big charade tired of
Playing these fucking games
Can't wait to see your tombstone slate may
Have been fooled but never played

Fuck you I don't need you!

Turns out I'm better off anyway tomorrow is another day
I don't need no sympathy from someone living in a fantasy
