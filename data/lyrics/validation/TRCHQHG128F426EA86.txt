If you want somebody to be your slave
Get you somebody new
If you want somebody that you can save
Get you somebody new
If you need somebody that you can hurt
Get you somebody new
I ain't nobody to treat like dirt
Get you somebody new
I can't stand it
When you call my name
I can't stand it
Drives me insane
I can't stand it
You're my heart's desire
I can't stand it
Burns like fire
If you want somebody to be your slave
Get you somebody new

If you want somebody in your hand
Get you somebody new
If you want somebody to understand
Get you somebody new
If you want a sucker that you can hate
Get you somebody new
Baby that sucker you know I ain't
Get you somebody new
I can't stand it
When you call my name
I can't stand it
Drivin' me insane
I can't stand it
Heart's desire
I can't stand it
To call my name
I can't stand it
Drivin' me insane
I can't stand it
Heart's desire
I can't stand it
Burns like fire
If you want somebody to be your slave
Get you somebody new

I can't stand it
I can't stand it
I can't stand it
I can't stand it
I can't stand it
I can't stand it
I can't stand it
I can't stand it
I can't stand it
I can't stand it
Burns like fire
If you want somebody to be your slave
Get you somebody new
