There's things I haven't told you
I go out late at night
And if I was to tell you
You see my different side

There's things I haven't told you
I go out late at night
And if I was to tell you
You'd see my different side

There's things I haven't told you
I go out late at night
And if I was to tell you
You'd see my different side

There's things I haven't told you
I go out late at night
And if I was to tell you
You'd see my different side

There's things I haven't told you
I go out late at night
And if I was to tell you
You'd see my different side

We don't care
What you say
I'mma do my thing
From day to day
(Get it?)
We don't care
What you think
'Cause in this world
It's Swim-or-Sink
(What the fuck?!)
