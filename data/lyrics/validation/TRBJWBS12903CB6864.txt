I'll tell you why I can't find you
Every time I go out to your place...

You gone fishin' (well how you know)
Well there's a sign upon your door (uh-huh)
Gone fishin' (I'm real gone man)
You ain't workin' anymore (could be)
There's your hoe out in the sun
Where you left a row half done
You claim that hoein' ain't no fun (well I can prove it)
You ain't got no ambition

Gone fishin' by a shady wady pool (shangrila, really la)
I'm wishin' I could be that kind of fool (should I twist your arm? )
I'd say no more work for mine (welcome to the club)
On my door I'd hang a sign
Gone fishin' instead of just a-wishin'

Papa bing (yeah louis)
I stopped by your place a time or two lately
And you aren't home either
Well, I'm a busy man louis. I got a lotta deals cookin'
I was probably tied up at the studio
