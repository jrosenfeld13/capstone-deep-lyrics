Watching the tidals that wash to the shore - I never forget
Into these silent waves of all times - eternally
How long may this remain
Peace to the land
Nature and sea
Silent emotions are overcome
I wonder how
We can go on
Stormy times will we behold ?
Do we still care
What future holds
So many words been said undone
The waves of green
They will flow on
Heal me, free me - dawning is near
Where is the saviour - for us to believe
As I sit here - on Norge's shores
Cries of the unheard - will they be heard
The waves of green - whispering my name
