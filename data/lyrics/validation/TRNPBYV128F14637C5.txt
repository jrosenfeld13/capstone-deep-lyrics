I'll tell you something
You can dance till you don't exist
But it never used to be like this

The sun sets over the water
And shines in my eyes
The stars and the moon are falling
Right out of the skies
And when you cry - there is no sky

The sun sets over the water
It shines in my eyes
The stars and the moon are falling
Right out of the skies
And when you cry - there is no sky
