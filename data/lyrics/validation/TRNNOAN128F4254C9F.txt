Ah who needs food
I want a beer picnic
I'm pissed off and I'm a mess
I need a beer picnic
Ah who needs food
I want a beer picnic
I'm pissed off and I'm depressed
I need a beer, I need a f*cking beer
I know it, I'm stinking, I'm in a c*nt
Stinging head lice, four cases of Colt .45
You don't need to come along
Means there's be more for me
Ah who needs food
I want a beer picnic
Well I'm pissed off and I'm a mess
I need a beer picnic
Ah who needs food
I want a beer picnic
I'm pissed off and I'm depressed
I need a beer
Yeah, I was drunk last night, I know it
I'll get drunk again today, big f*cking deal
You and your straight edge
Can go eat shit for all I care
Well who needs food
I need a beer picnic
I'm pissed off and I'm depressed
I need a beer picnic
Ah who needs food
I need a beer picnic
I'm pissed off and I'm a mess
I need some f*ckin' whiskey
I think I pissed myself
Gonna drink 'til I throw up
Gonna drink 'til I'm drunk
And I can f*ck you up
Beer, beer, whiskey, whiskey, beer, alcohol, alcohol and drugs in my veins
