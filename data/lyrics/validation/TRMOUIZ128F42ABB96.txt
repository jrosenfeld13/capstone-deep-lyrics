Poseidon, god of the sea, releace your wrath
The depths of your kingdom reborn in Atlantis
An old shipping fortress of land raised in your throne
Surrounded by the gloves of liquid emeny

Undefeated forgotten reality
Is trembling under the sea
Beyond my eyes reborn again
The lost existence of Atlantis

A glorious city unable to resist olympian's wrath
Bloody and buried! Bares her beauty to the sea
Waves are howling as they pass through the ruins of ocean
From the center of cosmos the judgment betraed its status

Eternal curse sended by Zeus upon his brother
And the night scorns to change the tragedy
Like the boat touches the shining line of the moon
Like the music cries in its darkness
We see the past engraved beneath the sea
Trembling underneath the surface of delightful vision
Years of kingship have died in your ocean cemetery

At its depths life has died
Bleeding through thousants of years
And corrupts as the waves surround
The unfound mark of Poseidon
