[Verse 1: Issa Gold]
Always got the pack now that's a fact, I'm like a cholo
You know the game we stay in tact we mafioso
Don't hit my jack, let's sip on racks so I'm like "Oh no"
These niggas act like they can match just cook it slow though, woah woah
Nigga's see me out that's very rare I keep it lowkey
Gotta keep me segregated from the niggas that don't know me
Cause these niggas hesitate and I keep ruins as my homie's
Quick to pop a fuckin' nigga, if you disrespect the holy
Now let me get it, ugh, nigga could get deaded
But I'd rather count my cheese, than move the people like a reverend
Just know I said it, ugh, Indigo protected
Put my life up on a line, don't disrespect my fucking message
My niggas reppin', never half-steppin'
Super-duper lethal weapon, yeah I'm gone in 60 seconds
And I'm grindin' for a check, get some new shit for the set
If a nigga got a problem, we'll be coming for you next

[Bridge: AK]
What you in here for?
What you in here for?
All my niggas we dismember folks, the cold December flow
Feed you poison, we the antidote
Them boys like they were chose, they heal the globe
They fill their hopes, and steal your hopes
Fo' sho', fo' sho', fo' sho'

[Hook: Issa Gold]
My niggas keep on reppin', you know the gang we built to last
You niggas keep half-steppin', I see your future through the past
I let that good smoke set in, I blow this shit down like my last
You better use your weapon, my money like a 40 cal

[Verse 3: Issa Gold]
My nigga Doughey with the shits he keep that 40 on his lap
Torch it just like a camel raise it up where niggas at
We don't fuck around with defense keep the team inside attack
Keep a hundred niggas with me, best believe a couple strapped

[Verse 4: AK]
When my instincts take control, instant transmission to the dough
While your bitch on my guest list, you pay admission to the show
Niggas be dissin', gonna need morticians from the flow
I do my AK rendition and spray the clips out from the dome
Since we hit the scene ain't hard to see we out your league
I ain't had no pot to pee just popped the smoke and broccoli
Gotta pay the paper, no hoe get no guap from me
I'm just tryna elevate and orchestrate the prophecy
AK never cop a plea I cop the 'dro ain't got no seeds
Drop my baby LSD the reason I ain't afraid to dream
All my niggas rated G, I ride for them they ride for me
Play your role and stay asleep while we awoke fuckin' your brain nigga, bang

[Bridge: AK]
What you in here for?
What you in here for?
All my niggas we dismember folks, the cold december flow
Feed you poison, we the antidote
Them boys like they were chose, they heal the globe
They fill their hopes, and steal your hopes
Fo' sho', fo' sho', fo' sho'

[Hook: Issa Gold]
My niggas keep on reppin', you know the gang we built to last
You niggas keep halfsteppin' , I see your future through the past
I let that good smoke set in, I blow this shit down like my last
You better use your weapon, my mind like a 40 cal
