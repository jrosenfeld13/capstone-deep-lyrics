He held her below the surface
Her breath became less intense
She couldn't see through the water
His eyelash killed her eye lens

When waves become strong emotions
"It's time to go home," she said
But he only heard the ocean roar
And it smashed her on the bottom of his head

And he said, "I am in the wilderness
You turned out my light
This time I will make it right
I get cold by fire."
She said, "Let me swim I'm no one's pet
And I didn't call your light
You sour liar; when I came
It wasn't even born yet."

And he said, "Maybe, baby, I will end you now because you're neaped."
And she said, "Maybe now my eyes are sewn, but I still have hearing."
