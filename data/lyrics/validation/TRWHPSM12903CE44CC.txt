[Intro: Lee Perry]
This song is dedicated to all the DJs out there
Who fight their truths and right music
The truth, yeah, like the man said yo

[Chorus: Lee Perry]
This is my new song, Mr DJ man
This is my new song
I hope you'll like this one

This is my new song, Mr DJ man
This is my new song
Give it a helping hand

[Verse 1: Lee Perry]
You fight the war and lose the battle
So throw away that old [?]
Free up your heart and make a new start
For you are only playing your part

[Chorus: Lee Perry]
This is my new song, Mr DJ man
This is my new song
I hope you [better trip?] this one

This is my new song, Mr DJ man
This is my new song
I hope you push this one

[Verse 2: Lee Perry]
Give I a chance,  Mr DJ
Give I a chance, I say
The baby need you and I am hungry
This is my high ranking letter to you

[Chorus: Lee Perry]
This is my new song, Mr DJ man
This is my new song
I hope you like this one

This is my new song, to all the DJ man
This is my new song
I hope you (better trip?) this one

This is my new song, to all the DJ man
This is my new song
I hope you push this one

[Verse 3: Lee Perry]
You load the gun and pull the trigger
You miss your target because of your ego
Give I a chance, Mr DJ
Give I a chance, I say

[Chorus: Lee Perry]
This is my new song, Mr DJ man
