I walk my doberman
He's eager to get out
I walk him to doberman land
Where he can snout
My girl is a tiger
So I never walk around with her
So I never walk around with her
She's eager to get out

Mentally overdriven
I saw the house burn down
I saw it come alive
There's people running 'round
She's that suicidal
As if I wasn't mad enough for her
As if I wasn't mad enough for her
She's eager to get out

Girlfriend needs attention
To the day to the day that I die
Girlfriend needs attention
To the day to the day that I die

So tell me dangerman
Is it safe for me to stay
I try to reach her
But she's still light-years away
As happy as ever
As if I wasn't mad enough for her
As if I wasn't mad enough for her
She's eager to get out

Girlfriend needs attention
To the day to the day that I die
Girlfriend needs attention
To the day to the day that I die

Evil has a human face
I see it every day
Evil has a human face
I see it every day

And the clouds curtains the moon
Which is a cheese in the hot part of the horizon

And suddenly again
She changed her mind about me being in her bed

And she rhapsodized the song
I tried to sing when she was begging me for peace
Just another tease

And suddenly again
She changed her mind about me
Being in her head
