[Intro]
If the angel should awaken
With the love I run to find
Truth is spoken, still I'm broken
Live to see the promise shine

[Pre-Verse]
Running, running, running
Running, running, running
Running, running, running
Running, running, running
Running, running, running
Running, running, running
Running, running, running
Running, running, running

[Verse 1]
In the shadow of an angel (I can go)
With the promise of the light (anywhere)
In the darkness of the doorway
In the burning of the night (anywhere)

[Chorus]
I've reached, I've reached, a turning point
God knows where to lead me, the love is all I have
I've reached, I've reached, a turning point
And God knows where it leads, gone from [?] you

[Pre-Verse]
Running, running, running
Running, running, running

[Verse 2]
If the angel should awaken
With the love I run to find
Truth is spoken, still I'm broken
Live to see the promise shine
I can never let this go

[Chorus]
I've reached, I've reached, a turning point
God knows where to lead me, the love is all I have
I've reached, I've reached, a turning point
And God knows where it leads, gone from [?] you

[Chorus]
I've reached, I've reached, a turning point
God knows where to lead me, the love is all I have
I've reached, I've reached, a turning point
And God knows where it leads, gone from [?] you

[Outro]
If the angel should awaken
With the love I run to find
Truth is spoken, still I'm broken
Live to see the promise shine
The promise shine
The promise shine
