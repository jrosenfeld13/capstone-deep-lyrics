Walking down the street
Standing looking at me
If you don't wanna know me
How happy I will be
Don't cross over the street to me
If you don't want my love
Set me free

I see you walking by
Love light in your eye
I just remember all those lies
So don't cross over the street to me
If you don't want my love set me free

Baby can't you leave me alone
Baby why don't you go on home
Baby don't you know that we are through
I don't need your love so set me free

Why don't you realize
That you and I are through
Every day I see you make me blue
So don't cross over the street to me
If you don't want my love set me free
If you don't want my love set me free
If you don't want my love set me free
