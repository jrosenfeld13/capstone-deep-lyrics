[Verse 1]
I live in an ice house-a
I never do dance salsa
I'm living in Jamaica
I live in an ice breaka
I'm living in Africa
I never do know where-a
Where I'm living but I'm living in a free fall
Whenever she goes away
Might as well be in San Jose
'Cause I never can tell where my
Where my heart's gonna spend its time
Half of me's missing
I miss her kissing
I don't know nothing but I know

[Hook]
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday

[Verse 2]
My head is a hurricane
My heart is a touch insane
And my body can't sleep to dream
And my eyes open up to scream
And my mouth is a thin straight line
As I'm struggling to pass the time
And my crime is that I'm living live without her
And the morning soon will come
And the day's nearly almost done
And the clock says it's half past five
But the sun is still in the sky

[Pre-Hook]
Disorientated
Insatiated
How long I've waited but I know

[Hook]
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday

[Verse 3]
My head is a hurricane
My heart is a touch insane
And my body can't sleep to dream
And my eyes open up to scream
And my mouth is a thin straight line
As I'm struggling to pass the time
And my crime is that I'm living live without her
And the morning soon will come
And the day's nearly almost done
And the clock says it's half past five
But the sun is still in the sky

[Pre-Hook]
Disorientated
Insatiated
How long I've waited but I know

[Hook]
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
She's coming back on Friday
