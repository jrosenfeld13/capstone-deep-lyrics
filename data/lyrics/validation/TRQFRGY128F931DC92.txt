Lead Vocals: Angela Groothuizen

You check up on everything that I say and do
You check out every lover that I knew
Or did you think that my life began with you?
Wontcha give a girl a break?

You believe in rumours you hear of me
You got a wild imagination and it's running free
And you're making my life a misery
Hey, won't ya give a girl a break?
Give a girl a break
Won't ya give a girl a break?
Give a girl a break

Don't you know it's not cool to haunt me?
All I wanted was your ams around me
But I know I'm wishing that you'd never found me
I'll make it easy on your mind
Because I'm leaving you behind

I believe that living well is the best revenge
I've learned to say adieu when a romance ends
'Cause I've learned to judge a man by the love he spends

So won't ya give a girl a break?
Give a girl a break
Won't ya give a girl a break?
Give a girl a break

Give a girl
Give a girl a break
Give a girl
Give a girl a break
Give a girl
Give a girl a break

Come on give a girl
You gotta give this girl
Come on, give a girl a break
You gotta give me a break
