[Verse 1]
Everybody's talking loud
Trying to get me to join the crowd
But I can't hear what they're talking about
Because they ain't saying nothing
They say come follow me
What I'm telling you will set you free
All you gotta do is act like me
But I can't feel nothing

[Chorus]
I just want somebody
To laugh out loud
I just want somebody
To make me smile
Whoa I'm, I'm trying to find a reason to believe[x2]

[Verse 2]
(Wait a minute)
I just can't tell what's right or wrong
And I'm not sure where I belong
And where is that simple song I remember
They say everything's in black and white
And the sun shines at twelve at night
And to praise God you got to fight
It's crazy, crazy

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Don't want to live
Don't want to lie to myself anymore
Don't want to try to understand
The pain I see through my eyes
Let me laugh
Just let me cry
Just let me see right from wrong
Just let me love
Let me feel
Because I want in my life
All the things that's real
Because I
I'm trying to find a reason to believe[x6]
