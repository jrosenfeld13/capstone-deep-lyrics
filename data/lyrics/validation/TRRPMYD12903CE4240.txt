Why must it be this way?
The trust we built has faded grey
When will this all be gone
You left me all alone, you left me holding on
Today passed so long ago
You left me bruised and broken
I had no chance to grow
I never thought it would come to this
But there's so much more bad than the good times I'll miss
I'm not sorry it turned out this way
Because the only way you acted only left me saying "life goes on"
It means nothing now
Because it worked out once but I'm wondering how
And how can you lie when you know it's true
I'll never forget what you broke in two
A lifeline worn from the love we shared
But trying to hold didn't have a prayer
And it crushes down, it crushes down on me
What you offered wasn't love just misery
I look around my room and I think of you
And I hope you never know what you put me through
All those letters you wrote, those words burn in my head
Lies written in stone
Don't you remember what we said?
