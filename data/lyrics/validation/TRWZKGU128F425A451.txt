I think I drove by you
Just yesterday
I think you were wearing the same thing
You are today
I don't believe
Everyone watches
Out they'd never show
The pain that they're feeling
And sometimes you just won't let go
We all need to see
You and me

Everybody needs love
Everybody needs love
(We all need love)
Everybody needs love
Everybody needs love
(We all need love)

Some say we're different
I know we're the same
We both need the sunshine
And I know we both need the rain
It helps me to see
You and me

Everybody needs love
Everybody needs love
(We all need love)
Everybody needs love
Everybody needs love
(We all need love)

So many lives
Searching to find out what love is
Out searching is all that they'll find
This is the love
That Jesus would give up His life and
Carry a cross that was mine

Everybody needs love
Everybody needs love
(We all need love)
Everybody needs love
Everybody needs love
(We all need love)
