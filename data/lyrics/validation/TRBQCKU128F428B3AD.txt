[Verse 1]
Rain, soft in the dark
We take a left through the deepening park
Grass, soaking and warm
Past the iron gates, August has come

[Chorus]
And I want you so bad in my heart
And I touch your shadowed fingers in the dark
And the stars have fallen on this night like rain
Through the silence of the dark October lanes

[Verse 2]
Iron, cold in the breeze
The gate beneath the haunted trees
Swings, as evening reveals
Your face, so lovely and unreal

[Chorus]
And I want you so bad in my heart
And I touch your shadowed fingers in the dark
And the stars have fallen on this night like rain
Through the silence of the dark October lanes

[Verse 3]
So here everything stays
The dew on the gates has melted away
And in your sunlit eyes
I see my love and all the night

[Chorus]
And I want you so bad in my heart
And I touch your shadowed fingers in the dark
And the stars have fallen on this night like rain
Through the silence of the dark October lanes
