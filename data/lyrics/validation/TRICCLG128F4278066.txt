This is the best, the best of the blessed
It didn't test the camera
I couldn't take another picture from the fire
But it's taking hold, the paper and gold
The foolish thoughts we inspire
I somehow overthrow the places
I've grown to admire, ooh
Sit on the throne, and talk on the phone
Everybody's doin' fine
You'd be better off dead
And the rest is a throwaway line
A lock of the curls of a beautiful girl
Standing by my side
She could've thrown me off
Like the deadest weight
She's all right
There is a mountain of lovers
Uncounted to dig up and throw away
You're one of those lovers
It'll hurt to uncover one day
You are the west and the west is a test
Dig it up please and play nice
There's no way to measure
But pleasure to pleasure
It's just fine
As you yell out the window
As you stare at the wall
Through the red of the engine light
She will carry us all
It's a pretty life
'Til you're smashing the rock into roll
It's a pretty life
'Til you're smashing the rock into roll
Through the glass of the window
Through the stone of the wall
Through the red of the engine light
She will carry us all
It's a pretty life
'Til you're smashing the rock into roll
She a pretty wife
'Til you're smashing the rock into roll
