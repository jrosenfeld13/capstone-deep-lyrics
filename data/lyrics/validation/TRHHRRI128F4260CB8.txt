Don't shed a tear
I know you don't want to be here anymore
Neither do I
Neither do I

Everything's alright
We'll just write another line
The Midwest has got its own charms
Got its own charms

Don't swim in that water tonight
The bugs are starting to bite
And it's so late
It's so late

Don't let it fall
I can taste the salt on your cheek
It's just like the sea, but not as deep
You can catch them all
One by one they make their way towards the ground
But I can't see my way around

Don't swim in that water tonight
The bugs are starting to bite
And it's so late
It's so late
