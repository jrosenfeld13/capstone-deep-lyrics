The Rapture
(Love is all)

Love is all my crippled soul will ever need
Love is all my crippled soul will ever need
It's ok to feel this way
It's ok-
It doesn't matter anyway

Love is all my crippled soul will ever need
And time will take a bigger part, a-part of me
Well tonite, your la-love is all i need
Your love, yea your love is all i need

Sun goes up and sun goes down
I dig love and just having you around

Love is all
