Deep in the castle and back from the war
Back with milady and the fires burnt tall
Hurrah went the men down below
All outside was the rain and snow
Hear their shouts, hear their roars
They've probably had a barrel, and much, much more
Hurrah, Hurrah, Hurrah, Yea
Over the hills came the swords of a thousand men

We had to meet the enemy a mile away
Thunder in the air and the sky turned grey
Assembling the knights and their swords were sharp
There was hope in our English hearts
Hear our roar, hear our sound
We're gonna fight until we have won this town
Hurrah, Hurrah, Hurrah, Yea
Over the hills came the swords of a thousand men

When the knights come along at the end of the day
Some are half-alive and some have run away
Hear our triumph, hear our roar
We're gonna drink a barrel, and much, much more
Hurrah, Hurrah, Hurrah, Yea
Over the hills came the swords of a thousand men

Hurrah, Hurrah, Hurrah, Yea
Hurrah, Hurrah, Hurrah, Yea - yea

Hurrah, Hurrah, Hurrah, Yea
Hurrah, Hurrah, Hurrah, Yea - yea

Hurrah, Hurrah, Hurrah, Yea
Over the hills came the swords of a thousand men
