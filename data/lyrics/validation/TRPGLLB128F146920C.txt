Please give up skin, when you forgive and believe me
Always waiting to shock (shock)
So for gods sake, live in me
Sugar daddy (ooh daddy daddy daddy)
A walking, talking, im low
Do what you want honey bow with your pain
Loving summer, you are spring coz your my santa claus machine
(love me)
Sugar daddy, hope you know i really think you gotta
Pay for me
Blow up my chair
Go ahead suffer, dance around my.... handbag
What is love? but total affection
24 hours utter protection
Loving summer you are spring coz your my santa claus machine
(believe me)
Sugar daddy hope you know i really think you gotta pay for me
Im so glad you ashamed
Running kula shaker birthday, the mix
When gravity kicks my ass you better pay (oh money money)
For my tits to be fixed
Loving summer you are spring coz your my santas claus machine
(leave me)
Sugar daddy hope you know i think you betta pay for me
Loviong summer you are spring coz your my santa clause machine
Love me
Sugar daddy hunky dory you know that you gotta pay for me
