[Verse 1]
Well, I saw an old man walking in my place
And he looked at me, it could have been my face
His words were kind but his eyes were wild
He said: I got load to love, but I want one more child

[Chorus]
There's a mansion on the hill
Psychedelic music fills the air
Peace and love live there still
In that mansion on the hill

[Verse 2]
Around the next bend, take the highway to the sun
Or the rocky road, it really don't matter which one
I was in hurry but that don't matter now
Because I have to get off that road of tears somehow

[Chorus]
