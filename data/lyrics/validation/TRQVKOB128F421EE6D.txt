When The World Abandons All Philosophy
A Public Who Abhors Mediocrity
Finds Itself The Cure

When It Awoke We Hailed It A Miracle
Avoidance Which Is Next To Impossible
A Sermon For The Pure

Here Come The Rats, The Rats Are Gonna Find Us
With The Second Black Plague And The Hanta Disease
Here Come The Rats, The Rats Are Gonna Find Us
And The First Contamination Is The Food We Eat
So Can We Scare Ourselves, To The Brink Of Death

Panic, Panic
Panic, Panic
Panic, Panic
Panic, Panic (The Digital)

Panic, Panic
Panic, Panic
Panic, Panic
Panic, Panic

While Information Leaked To The Media
Who Did Its Part To Fuel The Hysteria
Fear Becomes The Truth

And Though The Race Continues To Propagate
The Midday News Does Nothing Implicate
Safety Is Removed

This Is The Cancer From My Cellular Phone
That Emits Radiation Which Destroys My Brain
This Is The Cancer From My Television Screen
Which Reports The Danger While It Does The Same
So Can We Free Ourselves, From The Threat Of Death

Panic, Panic
Panic, Panic
Panic, Panic
Panic, Panic (The Digital)

Go In Peace Today, Listen In Peace Today
Can We Scare Ourselves To The Brink Of Death

Panic, Panic
Panic, Panic (The Digital)
Panic, Panic
Panic, Panic
