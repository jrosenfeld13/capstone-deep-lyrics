All that junk you filled our bones with
It fills us, too
All that junk you filled our bones with
It fills us, too
All that junk you filled our bones with
It fills us, too, but
Now you're a ghost, you can find
A home away from here
I always wanted to find a home away from here
Out in the field so weighted for the first time
All that rope you hang your neck with
It left a mark
All that rope you hang your neck with
It left a mark, but
Now you're a ghost, you can find
A home away from here
I always wanted to find a home away from here
Out in the field so grounded for the first time
All that river swept you under
Carried us, too
All that river swept you under
Carried us, too
All that river swept you under
Carried us too, but
Now you're a ghost you can find
A home away from here
I always wanted to find a home away from here
Out in the field so anchored for the first time
All the wind that blows through your head
Makes things new
All the wind that blows through your head
Makes things new
All the wind that blows through your head
Makes things new
Now you're a ghost, you can find
A home away from here
I always wanted to find a home away from here
When will I watch you take off for the last time?
