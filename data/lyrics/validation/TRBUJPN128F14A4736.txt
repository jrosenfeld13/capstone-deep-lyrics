All by your self
Standing alone
No company
Wiping a tear
Off of your eye
So broken up
Where could he be?

Oh, I knew that he would leave you in the end
So I hung around and acted like a friend

Oh, I can't bear to see you standing there alone and crying
Noe one cares that love is dying hard for you

Run, run, baby, run to me
Now is not the time to be strong
Run, run, run, baby, run to me (just let it happen)
Run, baby, run

Oh, how it hurts
Nothing but pain
That's all you feel
What a surprise
Now that he's gone
You always thought
His love was real

But I knew that he would leave you in the end
So I hung around and acted like a friend

You mean so much to me that I can't bear to see you crying
Standing in a world that's dying hard for you

Run, run, baby, run to me
Now is not the time to be strong
Run, run, run, baby, run to me (just let it happen)
Run, baby, run

Run run baby run to me
(Run, baby, run)
Run, run, run, baby, run to me
(Run, baby, run)
Run run baby run to me
(Run, baby, run)
Run, run, run, baby, run to me
(Run, baby, run)
Run run baby run to me
(Run, baby, run)
Run, run, run, baby
