There was smoke on the water
A little fire in the sky
If i hear that song one more time
I'll stick a fork right in my eye
Another round and a pickled egg
A truck pulled up with a 100 kegs
Just another friday night
Fuck no fuck no
Its chug-a-lug night
Here we go
Here we go
Chug-a-lug night
Kissin' girls you don't know
Here we go (2x)
Beer is in my hair
And vomits on my toes
Here we go (2x)
For no damn reason
I'm takin' off my clothes
Here we go (2x)
I walked to the bar
But now i'm driving...
I still believe in anarchy
Pardon me sir i have to pee
Passed out greaser on the floor
A beer fart on his pompadour
I'm quite happy almost gay
What the fuck did i just say
Something new every night
Fuck no fuck no
Its chug-a-lug night
Here we go (2x)
Chug-a-lug night
Kissin' girls you don't know
Here we go (2x)
Beer is in my hair
And vomits on my toes
Here we go (2x)
For no damn reason
I'm takin' off my clothes
Here we go (2x)
I walked to the bar
But now i'm drivin home
