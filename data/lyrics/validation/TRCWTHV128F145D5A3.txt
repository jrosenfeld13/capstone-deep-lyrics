I never thought there could be so much more
You picked me up when I was living down in Egypt
Led me out and opened up the door
When you showed me just how much you thought my heart ment
But I turned and walked away into the wilderness
Now who would have guessed

I hear you calling my name for a reunion
I hear you calling my name for a reunion
I thought I'd wandered too far away
But now I've got a brand new start
Reunion, reunion of the heart

Now I'm standing n the edge of the land
I want to go out and take all that you gave me
But I'm frightened and you understand
I failed you last time and I don't want a repeat
Still when I'm quiet again I shelter from the noise
I just hear your voice

I hear you calling my name for a reunion
I hear you calling my name for a reunion
I thought I'd wandered too far away
But now I've got a brand new start
Reunion, reunion of the heart
