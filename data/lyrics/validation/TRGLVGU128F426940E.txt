For the first time in my life
I know how I want to go
Spin through the warm air
To a thousand feet below
The top of the world's the place
Where the canyons fall below
And you can see from the there
To the depts of your soul

I'm not there yet
Not weak enough yet
I'll keep paying my bills
If this is as hard as it gets
On top of the world
On top of the world

Walk up to the edge
And the silence fills your head
You'll find right there
If you will lead or just be led

I'm not there yet
Not weak enough yet
Don't flatter me now

I'm not there yet
Not weak enough yet
Don't forgive all my sins
If this is as hard as it gets

I'm not there yet
Not weak enough yet
Keep my name in your book
