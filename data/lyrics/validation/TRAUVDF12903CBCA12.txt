[Verse 1]
Welcome to addiction
Just sit back and listen
Join me on my mission, on this short exhibition
This storys non-fiction, but I have a prediction
Top spots getting evicted, take a look at this description
The vision of a musician whos gonna slay the competition and any politician who gets in his way
This is only the first edition and I have the jurisdiction
You aint got no permission, youre the definition of opposition
I got all this ammunition, you wanna step to me in your condition?
Just take a look at your position, you need a prescription
Get back to the audition, youre gonna go into extinction
Whack rapper assassin in action, any objections?
Ill cross you like an intersection, we aint got no connection
Im dangerous as an infection that got injected into your erection with no protection
No resurrection
Youre dead
Slain, murdered, deceased, lifeless, departed, executed
You aint cute bitch, theres no such thing as being too rich
Yo did Drewsome produce this?
Nah, Daga did
Hoe, youre useless
Youre so foolish
Such a doofus
Im abusive, I bully emcees and I bring em to their knees
And I tell em to suck on these
I tell em please just stop trying
Quit your crying and get to dying
Its horrifying all these artists that are rising
When did the real stop recognizing?

[Verse 2]
Hold up I aint finished
I run this rap shit, I fucking grabbed it
Im a prince, bitch, call me Hamlet
Shakespeare of rap
Id agree with that
Coming up faster than the rate that Ive been speaking at
Are you hearing that?
You aint dreaming that
Youll find me with my disciples just like Jesus had
Gods my only boss
My mind is long gone
Ill check you like lacrosse
You bitches aint making moves
I call the shots, you aint hot, get out the spot
You sound just like Lil Yacht
Im an astronaut, Im a juggernaut
Im pulling up in your blind spot, hear the gunshot, hit the jackpot, stick to the plot, all you motherfuckers gonna rot
Talk your shit, youll get bit, so quick
I dont give a fuck bout what you say about me
I only give a fuck about the people round me
Cause all you motherfuckers wanna do is doubt me
But think about what yall would do without me
Cant get number one album? Well then allow me
All these bitches over here, yeah, they surround me
Stop sleeping on me, yo, you looking drowsy
Only thing youre worth to me is a fucking bounty
Use the money from your head, buy myself an Audi
Speakers bumping so loud, man, this shit is bouncy
Swimming in so much pussy that it could drown me
All these chains on me like I was sold into slavery, gold medals for my bravery, shout out my homie, Avery
All this cake on me like a motherfucking bakery
All these other rappers dont wanna play with me, yall scared Ima renegade you
Lemme educate you, lemme tell you bout Drew
Some shit you dont wanna do
Im a young Puerto Rican who aint taking shit, so whoever starts speaking Ima add you to the list
Theres prolly no good reason why I should let you live, so when you stop breathing youll understand what you did
Im gone
