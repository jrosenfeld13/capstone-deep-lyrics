Mama
Remember how you warned me
That he would only hurt me?
Remember how I didn't listen then, wasn't listening?
Mama
You said I shouldn't see him
Said I didn't need him
Said "A boy like that is gonna take your heart
Just to break your heart"
Told me from the start
He would break my heart
And I guess I was a bad girl
But you just never understood
How the lovin' of that bad boy
Made your bad girl feel so good

I'd sneak out my window
We'd meet in the night deep in the darkness
He knew how to love me so right
Mama, ooh, he was a wild one
And, ooh, I was a child once
But I will never be a child again
After lovin' him
Oh, not after lovin' him

Mama
I never knew a boy's touch
Could ever teach me so much
All those nights you didn't understand
I was in good hands
Mama
If I would have listened
The kissin' I'd be missin'!
I tell you
You were wrong as you could be
He's still here with me

Sneakin' out my window
We meet in the night deep in the darkness
He knows how to love me so right
Mama
Ooh, that boy's touch
Need it so much
Mama
Ooh, that wild one
Need to feel him
Mama
Ooh, that bad boy
He gives me such joy
Mama
I'm such a bad girl
He gives me such joy
Mama
