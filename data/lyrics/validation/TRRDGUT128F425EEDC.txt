Everybody sitting over there, near the hot lights say yeah (yeah)

It's a hard life when you work from nine to five
Can't make quite enough to keep your poor self alive
It's a hard life when you can't pay your rent
None of your friends will borrow you a cent
Sometimes you get so tired Lord you can't go on
You know a starvin' man won't run and bark
Go on try, try, try again
Get yourself back in shape again
Go on try, try, try again
Get yourself out of that fix you're in
It's a hard, hard life
Hang on for your life
Hang on baby, try, try, try

It's a hard life when you drive your Cadillac
Finance man is threatening to take it back
It's a hard life when the man say go to jail
None of your friends will throw you bail
It's a hard, hard life
Hang on for your life
Hang on try, try, try, try......
Hang on try, try, try, try, try.........
