Well I loved my mother
But now she's gone
To the rest, to the rest
Don't know where she's gone

How far will you go then?
For you to survive
And they say, and they say
What's he saying?

But I'm living all my fantasies
I wish you well both at the same time
Now I've given all I have to give
Soon as I've been given

Why will we bother with your heart?
Why will we bother with your heart?

But it's beacause it's a reason
It's a fight now, I know it is
I know it is

Why will we go there?
You can't deny
Nevermind, nevermind
Nevermind you'll try
These troops are growing
At overtime
I can face, I can face
What a strange design

But I'm living all my fantasies
Why I've never known such a feat
But I've given all I have to give
That now something's given

Why will we bother with your heart?
Why will we bother with your heart?

But it's because it's a reason
It's a fight now, I know it is
I know it is

I wish I had a summary
I die, I wouldn't go back again

I'm losing by far
I'm losing by far

I was born in the mystic summer rain
In a field surronded by holy men

I'm losing by far
I'm losing by far
I'm losing by far
I'm losing by far
I'm losing by far
I'm losing by far
I'm losing by far
I'm losing by far
I'm losing by far
I'm losing by far
