(Stand up, we'll be more than kings)
Stand up, we'll be more than kings
Show no mercy when the gates swing

I've said it before but without accepting that my body
Was the only thing keeping me from living
I wouldn't even let the surgeon touch me
Though facing death, I dined on flesh...
But now I live to fight out-numbered
I live to fight out-numbered at the fire dawn to live in rebellious honor

I'll stand, you'll see me over all of your fallen
I'll be knee-deep, knee-deep in a sea of their organs
Send me all of hell and I'll face them
I'll face them one on one-thousand

Stand up, we'll be more than kings
Show no mercy when the gates swing
Breathe deep the sea at your knees
Breathe deep and show no mercy..
With blistering heat, the army now bursting through, blinds me
With a light not meant to empower but reigned to devour
I'll face them one on one-thousand
This kingdom's end is written, I'll take it one on one-thousand

I'll stand, you'll see me over all of your fallen
I'll be knee-deep, knee-deep in a sea of their organs
Send me all of hell and I'll face them
I'll face them one on one-thousand and yell
"Is there no one else? Is there no one else left?"
