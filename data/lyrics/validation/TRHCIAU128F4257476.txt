I've been riding a storm
Since the day our love was torn
It's so hard to believe
There's a wound that just won't heal
In me Is it lost in the dark?
Or am I still there in your heart?
Look deep into yourself
It's only you and no one else
I need You are my desire
Baby come and stop this fire Cry
I just have to have you near me
That is why I sing this song
Crying
Don't you know I'm going crazy?
Without you by my side There's a breeze blowing in
Carry in my lonely wind
I've been drowning my sorrow for long
Guess the power of love is too strong
Within me
Is there something waiting Cry
I just have to have you near me
That is why I sing this song
Crying
Don't you know I'm going crazy?
Without you by my side Ask yourself
Do you know me?
Ask yourself now baby
Do you love me? Cry
I just have to have you near me
That is why I sing this song
Crying
Don't you know I'm going crazy?
Going crazy I can't live without you girl Ask youself
Do you know me?
Ask yourself now baby
Do you love me?
Ask yourself baby
Do you love me anymore
