This is a song for all of my close friends
Anonymous neighbours with stories to tell
I didn't realise I had so many close friends nameless and shameless with history to sell

What's the fuss? You've gotta be in it to win it
I want pride but I know I'll never get it
Fame, I wanna live for 15 minutes
I want love but my heart's not in it

If only it was lonely at the top, I've got too much, but its never enough
If only it was lonely at the top
If only it was lonely at the top

Oh oh oh oh, Hey hey, If only it was Lonely at the Top

This is a song for all the complainers
All the campaigners who will not give up
They're selling their souls just to wear their sunglasses
They say "stop the press, I want to get off"

What's the fuss? I've gotta be in it to win it
I want pride but i know I'll never get it
Shame, I wanna live for 15 minutes
I want love but my heart's not in it

If only it was lonely at the top
I've got too much, but it's never enough
If only it was lonely at the top
If only it was lonely...

What's the fuss? You've gotta be in it to win it
I want pride but I know I'll never get it
Fame, I wanna live for 15 minutes
I want love but my heart's not in it

Oh oh oh oh, Hey hey

If only it was lonely at the top, I've got too much but its never enough
If only it was lonely at the top
If only it was lonely at the top
