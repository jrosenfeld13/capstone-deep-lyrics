[Verse 1]
And it rained all night and washed the filth away
Down New York air conditioned drains
Oh the click click clack of the heavy black trains
A million engines in neutral
Oh the tick tock tick of the ticking time bomb
Fifty feet of concrete underground
One little leak becomes a lake
Says the tiny voice in my earpiece
So I give in to the rhythm, the click click clack
I'm too wasted to fight back
Oh tick tock goes the pendulum
On the old grandfather clock

[Chorus]
I, I can see you
But I can never reach you

[Verse 2]
And it rained all night and then all day
The drops are the size of your hands and face
The worms come out to see what's up
We pull our cars up from the river
It's relentless, invisible, indefatigable
Indisputable, undeniable
So how come it looks so beautiful?
How come the moon falls from the sky?

[Chorus]
I can see you
But I can never reach you
