If we were nude
Would we have freedom
Would it be so rude
Or is there a reason

And if we all stripped
Wouldn't it be revealing
Wouldn't have to be hip
And you could see what I'm feeling

Do you prefer tapered jeans or bellbottoms
Tiny shirts and ladies' skirts
Backwards caps and baggy slacks
White sneakers and ties with vests

It's not fair
I can't grow that bushy hair
Last year you were the hip-hop queen
And now you're on the rock and roll team

The truth is I don't understand
Just wanna show you who I really am
Under the clothes we wear
Under the clothes we wear
I'll meet you there

If I could talk
To you in the shower
Would you have style
And would you still have your power

And if I wore preppy shirts and cargo pants
White makeup and safety pins
Skater shorts and football pads
Just like Abercrombie ads

What can I do
I can't afford to impress you
Last week you were the dancing queen
Now you're all about the indie scene

Why is everything so fake
Are we really in the groups we make
Under the clothes we wear
Under the clothes we wear
I'll meet you there

My aunt Frieda
She dresses exactly like her friends
I suspect it never ends
If we could shed this phony skin
Then maybe you would see me

Under the clothes we wear
I'll meet you there
Under the clothes we wear
Under the clothes we wear
I'll meet you there
Under the clothes we wear
Under the clothes we wear
I'll meet you there
Under the clothes we wear
