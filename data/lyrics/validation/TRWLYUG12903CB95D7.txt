Rocks thud against battered bodies. One must die to see life. Take me
Strike me down. Let me bleed. Let them see. Rejoicing in what's happened to
Me. Let my screams attract you all. My call is your great fall. One must
Sacrifice his life to save his tribe. Better one than all. Captured by a lie
And put to death by his own brother. Take me in. Strike me down. I will pay
For your life. With my blood and my pain, you will be saved from death. By
My price I paid for your sins on the cross. I will purify you and give you
Life. My sin, my shame, takes its toll on my heart. Oh how I long to be
Pure. Purify me Lord. Take my pain away. Purify me. Daddy where are you?
Take my pain away. Cover me in your precious blood. I came to this world. I
Bled. I will save your soul. I bled. I will give you new life. I bled. I
Will give you peace now. I bled
