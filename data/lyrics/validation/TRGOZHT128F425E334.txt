Night after night
I try to make it all fit together
Night after night
I see you as someone I remember

You took me by surprise
Opened up my eyes
Now we gotta talk this over

Can it really be so serious?
To be all broken up and delirious
I guess we've really been out of touch
But can it really be so serious?
(Serious, so serious)

Day after day
I know it's not the way that you want it
Day after day
I try to find the key, but it don't fit

(Day after day)
But you know how it is
(Night after night)
No matter what I did
(Day after day)
We gotta talk it over

Can it really be so serious?
To be all broken up and delirious
I guess we've really been out of touch
But can it really be so serious?
(Serious, so serious)

Tonight, tonight
I'm thinking over everything you said to me
Tonight, tonight
I'm sorry, but I just didn't see

(Day after day)
And now it's up to you
(Night after night)
There's nothing else to do
(Day after day)
We've gotta talk it over

Can it really be so serious?
To be all broken up and delirious
I guess we've really been out of touch
But can it really be so serious?
(Serious, so serious)

(Serious, so serious)
Is it so serious?
(Serious, so serious
Serious, so serious)
