(Verse 1)
So this is where the engines stop
This is where we find the words or never talk
Is this where the fuel runs out
Or the starting point to turn it back around

(Refrain)
Lift the breaks, lets not waste time cause 
Cause youre Love, is my life
I dont know what were fighting when
Were on the same side
Stuck here, were stalling
Cant keep looking backwards
Got to live for now not then
So engines can start again

(Verse 2)
So this is where the penny drops
We only seem look for it when its lost
There were times we made the traffic stops
Now the bright lights dont notice us at all

(Refrain)
Lift the breaks, lets not waste time with
The little things that stop us moving
Cause youre Love, is my life
I dont know why were fighting when
Were on the same side
Stuck here, were stalling
Cant keep looking backwards
Got to live for now not then
So engines can start again

(Bridge)
My happy memory is home
Back when the engines started on their own
Lost in so many different places
So many conversations and faces I dont want to face without

Your Love is my life
Dont where were going
But I cant wait to arrive

(Refrain)

Cause youre Love, is my life
I dont know what were fighting when
Were on the same side
Stuck here, were stalling
Cant keep looking backwards
Got to live for now not then
So engines can start 
So engines can start 
So engines can start again
