You were pretty crazy
Back when we fell in love
Wanting to be everything
That I would be proud of
Hours we spent dreaming
How we'd beat the odds
Now the truth has hit us
Life is very hard
Life can be so hard

Chorus:
I love you
Deeper than I ever dreamed of
I need you. (I need you.)
Staying here 'til we can work it out
I want you
Knowing that through all the changes
I love you. (I love you.)
Somehow I just had to tell you now

(Yeah)
Oh, to stay your princess
If I only could
If you never saw the rotten;
Only saw the good
You'd still be prince charming
But we would never know
How it's in the darkest times
True love finally grows
Come on true love grow

(Repeat Chorus)
You got me, I got you
Sometimes it takes a little working through
But I can tell you now...

(Repeat Chorus Twice)
(I need you.)
(I love you.)
(I need you.)
(I love you.)
