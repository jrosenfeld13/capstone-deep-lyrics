After all these years
I can still remember
The way you taste
The way you feel

After all these years
I?ve got my foot on the parking brake
Waiting for that song on the radio
To play out

Alive as an ember, burning inside
Just when you think it?s ended
It comes on bright, alone in the dark
I whisper your name, it?s calling me again

But I am with you now
We are dancing in the moonlight
You got me spinning around
I can feel everything

Driving me all away
Through the old time memory
Was it so wrong to say
That I wanted you again?

And I could take you back
And we could go down in the city
And get lost for hours
We won?t say anything

Memories start to fade
The moment the lights turn
There?s no one here
I?m drifting down the avenue

But I?m with you now
We are dancing in the moonlight
You got me spinning around
I can feel everything
