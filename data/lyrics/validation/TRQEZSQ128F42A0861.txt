[Verse 1: Tori Amos]
Never was a cornflake girl
Thought that was a good solution
Hanging with the raisin girls
She's gone to the other side
Givin' us the old heave ho
Things are getting kind of gross
And I go it's sleepy time

[Pre-Chorus: Tori Amos]
This is not really, this, a-this
This is not really happening

[Chorus: Tori Amos]
You bet your life it is
You bet your life it is
Oh honey, you bet your life
It's a peel out the watchword
Just peel out the watchword

[Verse 2: Tori Amos]
She knows what's goin on
Seems we got a cheaper feel now
All the sweeteaze are gone
Gone to the other side
With my encyclopedia
They musta paid her a nice price
She's putting on her string bean love

[Pre-Chorus: Tori Amos]
This is not really, this, this
This is not really happening

[Chorus: Tori Amos]
You bet your life it is
You bet your life it is
Oh honey, you bet your life
It's a peel out the watchword
Just peel out the watchword

[Interlude: Tori Amos]
Never was a cornflake girl
Thought that was a good solution

[Refrain: Tori Amos]
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys girl?
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys girl?
A-ha, rabbit, where'd you put the keys
Oh yes, rabbit, where'd you put the keys
Where'd you put the keys, girl?

[Bridge: Merry Clayton]
And the man with the golden gun
Thinks he knows so much
Thinks he knows so much, yeah
And the man with the golden gun
Thinks he knows so much
Thinks he knows so much, yeah
And the man with the golden gun
Thinks he knows so much
Thinks he knows so much, yeah
And the man with the golden gun
Thinks he knows so much
Thinks he knows so much, yeah
Yeah

[Refrain: Tori Amos]
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys girl?
Oh yes, rabbit, where'd you put the keys girl?
All this time, rabbit, where'd you put the keys, oh yeah
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys girl?
