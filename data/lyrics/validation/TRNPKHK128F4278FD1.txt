Well she paid with silver dollars
And she danced from bar to bar
Then she parked her rusty trailer
Down in the holler
Well she once believed in Jesus
But she never believed in love
Now she worships at the alter of alcohol

She won't falter when you dare her
To get up, dance on the bar
She'll just strip down except
And strut around
She's got a way of giving thanks
Make sure you'll never forget her name
Before you pass out you'll say a prayer about Amazing Grace

She never dreamed of finding true love
She never dreamed that day was near
Until she stumbled into the mens room
And found me there
Well now I treat her just like a wonder
I hold her hair back when she throws up
But I still find her down in the gutter
Drinking with the bums

She's out looking for her lover
She will never have to wonder
Cuz she'll never spend another night alone
