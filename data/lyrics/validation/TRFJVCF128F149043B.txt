Behind her eyes there's curtains
And they've been closed to hide the flames, remains
She knows their future's burning
But she can smile just the same, same

And though her mood is fine today
There's a fear they'll soon be parting ways

Standing like a statue
A chin of stone, a heart of clay, hey

And though he's too big a man to say
There's a fear they'll soon be parting ways

Drifting away, drifting away, drifting away, away
Drifting away, drifting away, drifting away, away
