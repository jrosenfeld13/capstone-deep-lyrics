Breathing an image
Unrivaled in this form
Planned movements
Another to detonate
Open valves
Restraint enter the play
Watched it all unfold
In parts assembled solely

Vortex
Blacken the view

Torque and screw
Exhaust and opinion
The deeper the ulcer
Control the situation
The level of hate
Taught by experts
A bag of pieces
Embodied before me
