Picture an ending before its begun
The art of forgiveness is not what we're taught
Reek of the havoc already made
The cradle was damaged, dug by the grave

Where you lie in the sin, for mortal is the soul
Forgive me this, father, before I go cold
From burden of grief and all I regret
Spare me the conscience before I forget

For once in this life
I better do something right
But I'm caught in a world
That won't stop burning

Won't stop burning

Jump through the arms with a mindless desire
Hand in your pocket burnt by the fire
Cold as the stone you threw a the wall
Blood never boils till the pressure is high

With despise of the fear that festers the growth
The truth always beckons, don't lose what you stole

For once in this life
I better do something right
Don't bury the voice
That's not yet spoken

I'll challenge the flames
Till this man with no country remains
Still caught in a world
That won't stop burning

Right or wrong, this is where I belong
I've always belonged
If the truth be known, there's no place left to go
No place I can go

But there is a light, there's still a spark
There is no place in this room for the dark
So scatter the bones that's left of the old
For dust only settles when bored

Settles when bored

For once in this life
I better do something right
Don't bury the voice
That's not yet spoken

I'll challenge the flames
Till this man with no country remains
Still caught in a world
That won't stop burning

Won't stop burning
Won't stop burning
