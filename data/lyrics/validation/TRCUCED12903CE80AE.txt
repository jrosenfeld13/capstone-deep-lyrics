Head against the rock
Beat the truth out of the block
That is the comfort of a serpent's eyes
Her anchored soul has drowned
But the ocean makes no sound
As if any disturbance is romanced, romanced
As if any disturbance is romanced

Hard to keep down the secret
Is that why her body pounds?
Is that why her body pounds?
Hard to keep down the secret
Is that why her body pounds?
Symptoms of another's ill intent

She feels ashamed to hurt
So she'll keep the wall alert
That soon the spill of guilt will replace
Far too many hearts would break
Break if they were wise
Forgetting is the god given grace
But guilt still has a comfortable place in me

Hard to keep down the secret
Is that why her body pounds?
Symptoms of another's ill intent
Hard to keep down the secret
Is that why her body pounds?
Is that why her body pounds?
Is that why her body pounds?
Is that why her body pounds?

Why, why the noxious swell of his face
Why, why the noxious swell of his face
Why, why the noxious swell of his face
Why, why the noxious swell of his face
And I'm hurting now
