Will you reach into your pockets?
And show us that you care
For the orphans and the farmers
Everyone give their share

I feel so guilty when Im resting
Though I rise at early dawn
For every hour that passes
I could have helped someone

And well show the world
What a country girl can change
And well show the whole wide world
That we have a pretty face

Pretty face, pretty face
Pretty face have we
Pretty face, pretty face
Pretty face have we

A thousand miles of concrete
Schools and dams and parks
Two thousand day care centers
And a center for the arts

There will always be poor people
But teach them how to care
If a hospital is needed
Every business give its share

And well show the world
What a country girl can change
And well show the whole wide world
That we have a pretty face

Pretty face, pretty face
Pretty face have we
Pretty face, pretty face
Pretty face have we

Some would call me Robin Hood
But this work we do I know is good
So dig a little deeper now
Were gonna turn this thing around

Pretty face, pretty face
Pretty face have we
Pretty face, pretty face
Pretty face have we
