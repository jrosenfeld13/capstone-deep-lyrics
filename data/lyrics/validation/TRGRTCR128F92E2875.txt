Cruising down the river on a Sunday afternoon
With one you love, the sun above waiting for the moon
The old accordian playing a sentimental tune
Cruising down the river on a Sunday afternoon
The birds above all sing of love, a gentle sweet refrain
The winds around all make a sound like softly falling rain
Just two of us together, we'll plan a honeymoon
Cruising down the river on a Sunday afternoon
