[Verse 1]
Stroll to the cafe
My God how time flies
And I close up my brain
Another friend dies
And me I'm just the same

[Verse 2]
Soaking up Broadway
Nightlife in Detroit
And I'd buy New York ladies
If these lights weren't so bright
And me I wasn't there

[Verse 3]
Stagger down Main Street
A knife in my side
And I fall to the gutter
In tears but with pride
And me I'm feeling no pain

[Verse 4]
Moving out of central
This waiter knows me well
Said he'll spill the whole story
(He) may be lyin' I can't tell
And me I'm not that kind

[Chorus]
I've been searching for my shadow in vain
How can I be still while my lifeline remains
I've been searching for my shadow in vain
How can I be still while my lifeline remains
With him

[Verse 5]
Try to steal a needle
Bring peace to my head
And I'm stumbling down the alleys
I find killers instead
And me I'm the cause of it all

[Verse 6]
Street corner women
Are taking their toll
Now they look at me, I'm dying
And I'm going home
And me, I'm lovin' it all

[Chorus]
I've been searching for my shadow in vain
How can I be still while my lifeline remains
I've been searching for my shadow in vain
How can I be still while my lifeline remains
With him
