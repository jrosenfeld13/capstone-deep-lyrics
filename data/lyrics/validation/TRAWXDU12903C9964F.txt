Going to the salon
Gotta get my hair done
Pedicure manicure everything i need and more
It's going down today i can't wait to celebrate
Drive to the car wash after that i'll drop my top

[Chorus:]
I can't wait it's going down tonight
Time to play everythings gonna be alright
Got my girls on the phone
I've been waitin for so long
It's a party going on tonight

[Verse:]
Time for a shopping spree
Spending money just for me
I don't need a man's pay i can make my own way
Credit card bank account, long as it is allowed
Thank god it's friday
Doing things my own way
[vamp:]
I got my dress, i got my fendi shoes, gotta get my prada bag
Step out the S-ca jag, then go to ballay's, to get the facts away
Then get on my 2-way, my girls reply and say
I can't wait

[Chorus: 2x]
(everybody let's party)

[Bridge:]
Said it's a party, a party, party, party
Party, party, party
Party, party, party

[Chorus: 2x]

[Bridge: 2x (until song ends)]
