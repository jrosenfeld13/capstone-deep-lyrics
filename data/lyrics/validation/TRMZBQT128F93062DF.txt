The beer was talking and it seemed a little bored
Suggested walking for awhile
Thought it'd be dramatic if we walked all night
But I got tired, so I came home
Lay back on the couch to watch TV
The drunks were talking, wasn't long before I grew bored
Lewis didn't feel the same
I guess they spoke in tongues that wrapped around his brain
He didn't mind the feeling at all
Remember me sometime when I am far away
And I will try and do the same
Maybe just like you some day I will forget
Every hit song America ever had
Like this is for all the Lonely People
And Oz never gave nothing to the Tin Man
And I've been to a desert on a horse without a name
