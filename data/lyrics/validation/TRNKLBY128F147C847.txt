This is a song about a card game

Black queen, holding hearts
Black queen, tear the game apart
Black queen, don't you know?
Can't beat aces all in a row

Black queen, no you can't
Have mercy black queen
Don't you go mess with the black queen, no

Black queen, see the whole hand
Black queen, where's your black man?
Black queen, if he ain't in the hole
Black queen, you got some more to show me, black queen

Oh, get on me black queen
Oh, Lord, have mercy, black queen yeah
She's called to beat me clean

Black queen, where's your bank roll?
Black queen, where did it go?
Black queen, the truth is hard
Black queen, you're playin' foolish cards, black queen
