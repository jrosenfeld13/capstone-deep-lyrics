Deep in the woods, far, far away live five wives who sleep all day
Five lumberjack husbands who love chopping trees
All the while they are sleeping, these five sweet ladies

Over the hill, beyond the stream, there you will find five ladies dancing
Playing with children and sheering the sheep
They're laughing so loud you can hear them next week

Over the mountain and beyond the sun, five lovely cottages built into one
Four hundred children
Six hundred sheep
Ten lovely parents sing them to sleep
La la la la
