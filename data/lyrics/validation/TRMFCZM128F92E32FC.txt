Well, I lost my baby
She just wouldn't treat me right
Well, I lost my baby
She just wouldn't treat me right

She has spent all my money
And she didn't come home 'til night
I love my baby, I can't get her to understand
I love my baby, I can't get her to understand
She leaves me early in the mornin'
She goes out with some other man

Every time I see my, baby
Walkin' down the street with some other man
Every time I see my, baby
Walkin' down the street with some other man
It used to be your cousin
But now you're runnin' hand in hand
