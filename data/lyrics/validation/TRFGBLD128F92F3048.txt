Horns raised and filled with the finest of mead
Valhalla's warriors battle succeed
The lodge so enormous, so many in here
Valkyries serve us the best flesh and beer
Forever we'll sit here, to eat and drink well
All of us heathens on a battlefield fell
Our death went divine to Valhalla came
Another brave name for the golden hall's fame

Inside the great lodge where delight does stream
A beautiful valkyrie in every man's dream
"Woman come over here and sit on my knee!
In the great sky tonight you will see
Up there I'll show you the mighty starsign
The shape of Thyrfing trapped in time
That sword my life once before took
But now in Valhalla, tonight we will fuck!"

Where delight is streaming
Fallen warriors gleaming

Soon we'll be there in the goldenmost hey
Crawling around each other 'til the very next day
Eight hundred voices in a drunken chant
Some dance around the tables, stand straight they can't
Throats are getting wet, throats are getting dry
There's a lot of mead in the horns raised high
The feast goes on forever, for ages it will last
We're all getting glorified, thinking about our past
