Oh, yeaheah
Oh, darling
Mmm...

She is floating like a butterfly
So charming (Baby, girl)
She recognise the man in me (Number one in di world)
There's something in her eyes
Like a spell getting me hypnotized, oooh, Lord

She give me one smile
Two smile, three smile
She got me going wild (Worth more than diamonds and pearl)
So, baby, don't change your smile (Sweet honey), oh no, no love

Tease me, tease me, tease me, baby
'Till I lose control
Tease me with your loving until I lose control
Take all my body and soul, oh, girl

Woman, your love is like burning fire inna me soul
Woman, tease me woman 'till I lose control
Woman, your love is like burning fire inna me soul
Woman, tease me 'till me lose control

Me gal, tease me and take a look and fancy
Right from the clock until me reach climax
A when me reach me will tell you fi stop
Will ya hear fi de sky and we not turn back

Suddenly you think of all the love that I was searching for
Holding confidence that will never, never fail
Hearing angel voices singing love prevail
Oooh, darling
Oooh, hey, come closer to me and don't bail out
When me sing I'll come

Tease me, tease me, tease me, baby
'Till I lose control
Tease me with your love until I lose control
Take all my body and soul, oh, girl

Tease me, tease me, tease me, baby
'Till I lose control
Tease me with your love until I lose control
Take all my body and soul, oh, girl

Hear me now, I will never forget the first time we kissed
It's like striking goal, catching a big fish
Yes, you are on top of my romance list
Second to none you defeat the favourite

Woman, your love is like burning fire inna me soul
Woman, tease me woman 'till I lose control
Woman, your love is like burning fire inna me soul
Woman, tease me 'till me lose control

And even if my mind should resist
Ohoho, yeaheah

Tease me, tease me, tease me, baby
'Till I lose control
Tease me with your love until I lose control
Take all my body and soul, oh, girl

Tease me, tease me, tease me, baby

Tease me with your love until I lose control
Take all my body and soul, oh, girl
