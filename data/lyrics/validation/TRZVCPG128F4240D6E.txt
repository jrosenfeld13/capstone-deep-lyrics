[Verse 1]
There were signs up in the sky
When we gathered by the garden wall
Everybody on his best behavior
Listening for the altar call

[Verse 2]
High priest of Salem in his robes
Ranting at the coming of the day
Ravens at the gates
Frightening all the visitors away

[Chorus]
I laid down by the water
Dreamed a dream of where I come from
Old things made new
Waiting for you

[Verse 3]
There were wooden wind chimes rustling
In the trees above the anthills on the dunes
On the high winds we could hear them
Old familiar tunes

[Verse 4]
The little bit of faith we had once
Like the memory of a movie
They got burned up in the great fire
Reassembling itself slowly but surely

[Chorus]
I laid down by the water
Dreamed a dream of where I come from
Old things made new
Waiting for you
