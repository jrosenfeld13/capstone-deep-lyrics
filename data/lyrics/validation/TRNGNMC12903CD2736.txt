[Verse 1]
I wanna take you to a place not very far from here
Don't have to travel far away to let down your hair
It's the kinda of place to show your face and no one cares
What you do or what you say, or what you wear

There's no secret, you can find it if you look inside
Yourself and no one else don't have to be a bumpy ride
We've been searching all our lives and now we know it's there
It's a magic place

[Chorus]
No matter how much you wanna leave you could come back (4x)
And when you come back you gonna hear the soundtrack (2x)
No matter how much you wanna leave you could come back
And when you come back you gonna hear the soundtrack

[Verse 2]
I wanna take you to a place not very far from here
Don't have to travel far away to let down your hair
It's the kinda of place to show your face and no one cares
What you do or what you say, or what you wear

There's no secret, you can find it if you look inside
Yourself and no one else don't have to be a bumpy ride
We've been searching all our lives and now we know it's there

[Chorus (quiet)]
No matter how much, you wanna leave you could come back (4x)
And when you come back you gonna hear a soundtrack (2x)
No matter how much, you wanna leave you could come back
And when you come back you gonna hear a soundtrack
