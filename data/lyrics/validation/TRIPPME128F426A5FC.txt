[Verse 1]
He got flat baby
Kick in the back baby
A heart attack baby
I need your body

A hot kiss honey
He dug a ditch baby
You make me sick baby
So unrelying

I'm such a swine baby
All down the line daddy
I hate your kind baby
So unreliable

A hot buzz baby
He's one of us baby
Another drug baby
You so desirable

[Chorus]
Trust in me
Trust in me
Put all your trust in me
You're doing morphine

Ho!

[Verse 2]
They got place baby
Kicked in the face baby
You hate your race baby
You're just a liar

Your every lick baby
Your dog's a bitch baby
You make me sick baby
You soul survivor

She never cut from me
She never cut baby
I had to work baby
You just a rival

Always to please daddy
Right up and leave daddy
You're throwing shame daddy
So undesirable

[Chorus]
Trust in me
Just in me
Put all your trust in me
You're doing morphine

Go on babe

[Bridge]
Relax
This won't hurt you
Before I put it in
Close your eyes and count to ten
Don't cry
I won't convert you
There's no need to dismay
Close your eyes and drift away
Demerol
Demerol
Oh God he's taking demerol
Demerol
Demerol
Oh God he's taking demerol
He's tried
Hard to convince her
To be over what he had
Today he wants it twice as bad
Don't cry
I won't resent you
Yesterday you had his trust
Today he's taking twice as much
Demerol
Demerol
Oh God he's taking demerol
He-he-he
Demerol
Demerol
Oh my Oh God it's Demerol
He
Ooh

Oh!

[Verse 3]
He got shit baby
Your dog's a bitch baby
You make me sick baby
You are a liar

Is truth a game daddy
To win the fame baby
It's all the same baby
You're so reliable

[Chorus]

Ho!

[Verse 4]
You just sit around just talking nothing
You're taking morphine
Ho!
Go on baby
You just sit around just talking about it
You're taking morphine
Ho-ho!
Just sit around just talking nothing about it
You're taking morphine
You just sit around just talking about it
You're taking morphine
You just sit around just talking nothing
And taking morphine

Ho-ho
I'm going down baby
You're talking Morphine

[Outro]
Go on baby!
Ho!
Ho!
Morphine!
Do it!
Ho!
He's taking morphine
Morphine!
Morphine!
