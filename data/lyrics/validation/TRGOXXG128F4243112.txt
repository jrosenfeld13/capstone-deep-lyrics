Then there are the days in between
Dont want to move
I just want to forget
When everything seems hollow and mean
Smoke another cigarette and go back to bed
These are the days in between
For no good reason

Just looking for a place to hide
So burnt out I cant explain
So I took a ride down to the end of the line
Just stumbling around from day to day
These are the days in between

And I was happy for a while
But then I started chasing your stone cold heart
But then everything started falling apart

Yeah I was happy for awhile

Eight times up
Seven times down
Watching it all go to hell
And you feel like giving up
You get lost awhile
These are the days in between
Living underneath a bad spell

But then I started chasing your stone cold heart
And I was happy for a while
But then everything started falling apart Yeah I was happy for awhile
