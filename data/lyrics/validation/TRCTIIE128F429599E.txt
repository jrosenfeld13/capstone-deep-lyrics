You were just a thing
Weren't supposed to feel it and you noticed
God damn fool what bring
Though I can't conceal it you know

It's not easy
Even if I try to hide it
I'm open again

Cause you've stolen the one thing
That you weren't meant to take
And you've pulled on the one string
That you weren't meant to play
Now it's broken
And it's twisted
And you know it's not ok
You've stolen my heart today

Swallows flew around here
They're all dissappearing and you're leaving
Your voice inside my ear
And though it's hard to hear it it's still ringing

It's not easy
Even if I try to hide it
So I'm walking away

Cause you've stolen the one thing
That you weren't meant to take
And you've pulled on the one string
That you weren't meant to play
Now it's broken
And it's twisted
And now it's not ok
You've stolen my heart today

Too bad cause I want him back
Too bad cause I'm all distracted
Feel bad should have told you that before

One chance is all you get
Got to leave me a little respect
Cause you know what my heart is for

Cause you've stolen the one thing
That you weren't meant to take
And you've pulled on the one string
That you weren't meant to play
Now it's broken
And it's twisted
And you know it's not ok
You've stolen my heart today
