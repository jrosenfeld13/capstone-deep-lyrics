In the beginning God
A fancy that wil pass
I know how it began
I believe in gas
I know that the Big Bang
Gave the world its shape
My image is not Gods
Im related to the ape

Chorus:
Lets be frank
Lets talk straight
Won't believe
Til they slam hells gate

Miracles are folly
I simply must insist
They can never happen
Because they dont exist
I can't believe that Jesus
Ever came to save
I even tried to find Him
He wasn't in his grave

Lets be frank
Lets talk straight
Won't believe
Til they slam hells gate
(2x)

I dont need a saviour
Im doing very well
You ain't gonna stop me
Im on my way to hell

Lets be frank
Lets talk straight
Won't believe
Til they slam hells gate
(2x)

Hey Frank lift up your shades
Hey Frank won't you look and see
Yeah Frank Look to Jesus
Look to Jesus and youll be set free

Lets be frank
Lets talk straight
Won't believe
Til they slam hells gate
(2x)

Lets be frank
(repeat til end)
