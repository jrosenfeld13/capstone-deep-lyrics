I don't wanna go
But I can't stay
So I'm making up the bed where we used to lay
Take my pictures from the frame
And don't call my name
And don't come around
It's such a shame
But time heals all pain
And I'll be ok
I love you from afar
And you'll do the same

(You go your way and I'll go mine)
(It's healing time)
It'll be bad for you, but good for me
The healing time
Now the hardest thing is knowing that we will never be
But I'd rather say goodbye than live a lie
It' s healing time

Trying to be friends sometimes don't work
The closer we get, the more it hurts
So just give back my gifts
And please don't say please
And don't, don't, don't play that song
The one called 'on bended knees'
Just say goodbye
Don't let me see you cry
Maybe we'll meet again under some other sky

(You go your way and I'll go mine)
(It's healing time)
(It'll be bad for you, but good for me)
(The healing time) The healing time
(Now the hardest thing is knowing that we will never be)
(But I'd rather say goodbye than live a lie)
(It' s healing time, healing time)

Don't look for no words
There's nothing to say
You can't change my mind
'Cause there ain't no way
Please no last kiss, I gave one last try
We can't be friends, Lord knows we've tried

(You go your way and I'll go mine)
(It's healing time)
(It'll be bad for you, but good for me)
(The healing time) It's healing time
(Now the hardest thing is knowing that we will never be)
Never, ever, ever, ever be
(But I'd rather say goodbye than live a lie)
(It' s healing time, healing time) No-woh
(You go your way and I'll go mine) Go your way
(It's healing time) And I'll go mine
(It'll be bad for you, but good for me) Bad for you
(The healing time)
(Now the hardest thing is knowing that we will never be)
Will never, ever be
(But I'd rather say goodbye than live a lie)
It' s healing time, healing time

Go your way, I'll go mine
Never be, never be, never be, no, no more, babe
Bye-bye, baby, bye- bye, bye-bye, bye-bye
I've got to go
Think I held on too long
