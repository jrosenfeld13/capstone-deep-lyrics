Sometime I weep
But weepings not my game
Sometime I cry
But I'm laughing all the same
Sometime I'm blue
But blue is not my color
Sometime I'm green
Green like any other lover
And I never know where to draw the line
And I never see the dangers
And I never know where the boundry lies
But you, you, you
Sometime I'm bitter
Taste so bad inside
Sometime I worry
That I'm gonna lose my tiny mind
Sometime I'm blue
But blue is not my favorite color
Sometime I'm red
When I see great big balls of fire
And I never know where to draw the line
And I never see the dangers
And I never know where the boundry lies
But you, you, you
It's a long long way (yes it is)
It's a long way down
It's a long long long way
It's a long way to fall
And I never know where to draw the line
And I never know where the darkness lies
But you, you, you
It's a long long way
It's a long way down
It's a long long long way
It's a long way to fall
It's a long long way (I'm crawling to the mountains)
It's a long way down
It's a long long long way
It's a long way down
Blue is not my color
It's not my color
It's not my color
