Look at me standing here, nothing to see
Speak to me, say the words, nothing I can hear
Take a while by my side, nothing to fear
Am I alone again?

Black night upon the sea
I will follow you
I see the fire in your eyes
True reflection, dusty skies

Look at me standing here, nothing to see
Speak to me, say the words, nothing I can hear
Take a while by my side, nothing to fear
Am I alone again?

White lies ride on the wind
Did I follow you?
I heard the silence everywhere
Foolish whispers fill the air

Look at me standing here, nothing to see
Speak to me, say the words, nothing I can hear
Take a while by my side, nothing to fear
Am I alone again?

Look at me standing here, nothing to see
Speak to me, say the words, nothing I can hear
Take a while by my side, nothing to fear
I am alone again?
