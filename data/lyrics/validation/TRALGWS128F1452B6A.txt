[Verse 1]
No greater love, Romeo and Juliet
But Shakespeare died and years passed by
Juliet knows everything about Romeo
Except why he tells her "no" at night

[Verse 2]
You know that beggars should not be choosers
Romeo's job has no social term
Jerking off is made for the losers
Instead of wit he sells his sperm

[Chorus]
And every day, just the same
Romeo's shame in black suitcase
And every day

[Verse 3]
Romeo is a poor refugee
He's just another one to bite the dust
Juliet measures time by diamonds on her watch
They come together by the force of lust

[Chorus]
And every day, just the same
Romeo's shame in black suitcase
And every day

[Bridge](x3)
I'm not Romeo
I'm not Romeo
Maybe you are Juliet
But I'm not Romeo

[Verse 4]
Why do you wake up in sweat, dear Romeo?
Why does you face turn away from me?
What is the pain that you are going through?
What is the secret that I cannot see?

[Verse 5]
Oh, I was dreaming I jumped by parachute
And I went down, down, down since my birth
But at the moment I was ready for lending
Oh, my God, I missed planet Earth

[Chorus]
And every day, just the same
Romeo's shame in black suitcase
And every day

[Bridge](x3)
I'm not Romeo
I'm not Romeo
Maybe you are Juliet
But I'm not Romeo

[Outro]
What kind of lust is dreaming in your soul?
How fast the light goes on?
