[Ryan:] Mmm, mmm, yeah

[Verse 1]
[Ryan:] I got a lot of things I have to do
All these distractions our future's coming soon
We're being pulled
[Ryan & Kelsey:] A hundred different directions
[Ryan:] But whatever happens
[Ryan & Kelsey:] I know I've got you
[Ryan:] You're on my mind, you're in my heart
[Ryan & Kelsey:] It doesn't matter where we are
We'll be alright, even if we're miles apart

[Chorus: Troy & Gabriella]
All I want to do is be with you
Be with you
There's nothing we can't do
Just want to be with you, only you
No matter where life takes us
Nothing can break us apart
(You know it's true)
I just want to be with you
(Yeah, yeah)
Just be with you

[Verse 2]
[Troy:] You know how life can be
It changes overnight
[Troy & Gabriella:] It's sunny then raining, but it's alright
[Gabriella:] A friend like you
[Troy & Gabriella:] Always makes it easy
[Troy:] I know that you get me
[Troy & Gabriella:] Every time
Through every up, through every down
You know I'll always be around
Through anything you can count on me

[Chorus: Troy & Gabriella]
All I want to do is be with you
Be with you
There's nothing we can't do
Just want to be with you, only you
No matter where life takes us
Nothing can break us apart
(You know it's true)
I just want to be with you
I just wanna be with you
