I've got me a badge, a bright shiny badge
I'm painting the crest in yellow and blue
I've got me a club, an exclusive club
Doesn't include a place for you
Hey, hello neighbor
Hey, hello neighbor, right you are
It's in the way that you walk
All of the changes, all the mistakes
It's in the demands you constantly make
It's in the way that you grieve
All of the loss
You don't know when you're better off
Or at what cost you've got it good
Hey, the banality of evil
Benevolent mother smother the child
The benefactors are in denial
Hey, hello neighbor
Hey, hello neighbor, right you are
There was a time not so long ago
I was master of everything I surveyed
Yes, there was a time
We did it my way, we'll do things my way
Benevolent mother, smother the child
The perpetrators are in denial
The banality of evil
King of the castle, room at the top
Off with their heads, chop 'em off
The banality of evil
Benevolent mother, smother the child
The benefactors are in denial
The banality of evil
King of the castle, room at the top
Off with their heads, chop 'em off
Hey, hello neighbor
I don't believe in what you believe
You skin is filthy and your gods don't look like god to me
But I want to touch you
Now that isn't right, no, that can't be right
But I want to touch you
You're leading me on, I know it
Hey
King of the castle, more room at the top
All sorts allowed, now the gloves are off
Hey, hello neighbor
Benevolent mother, smother the child
The benefactors are in denial
The banality of evil
King of the castle, room at the top
Off with their heads, chop 'em off
The banality of evil
Benevolent mother, smother the child
The perpetrators are in denial
The banality of evil
King of the castle, room at the top
Off with their heads, chop 'em off
The banality of evil
Hey, the banality of evil
Hey, the banality of evil
Hey, the banality of evil
Hey
