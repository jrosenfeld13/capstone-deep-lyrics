Met a child of the Cosmos
On the streets of Kanab
He pointed the way and
Answered the questions I had
But a short cut through Utah
Doesn?t really exist
It?ll send you through a mountain
And out a hole in a cliff

Left Flagstaff in the morning
To make Salt Lake by night
Driving across the moon
Hoping that it?s right
Went into a fog
Near the state line
But didn?t care much
About losing time

It?s true a wrong turn
Can put you in a wrong place
But it could lead to
A way cooler space
You'll never have a bad trip
If you accept
The twists and the turns
That you don?t expect

On Highway 80

Just out of the hills
Hit something slick
About took a spill
On the plateau
In snow axle deep
Still got to Rock Springs
In time for some sleep

Been a mile high
For nearly a week
But it?ll wear off
Under twelve hundred feet
Coming down soon
Traveling I-35
Playing songs and
Glad to be alive

It?s true a wrong turn
Can put you in a wrong place
But it could lead to
A way cooler space
You'll never have a bad trip
If you accept
The twists and the turns
That you don?t expect
