She spins the wheel of fortune on the boardwalk
Where lovers draw their secrets in the sand
Those Coney Island boys in satin jackets
Choose up among themselves
To see who get a chance at those

Brooklyn girls - they like to talk tough
Brooklyn girls - they shine in the rough
Brooklyn girls - Hold on, I'm coming for you

She dreams about the lights across the river
Dances in the dark while the radio plays
She knows that someone out there must be waiting
To take her in his arm and steal her heart away, oh

Brooklyn girls - they like to talk tough
Brooklyn girls - they shine in the rough
Brooklyn girls - Hold on, I'm coming for you

So much love
Lost in a crowd
Take a look around
She's just waiting to be found
