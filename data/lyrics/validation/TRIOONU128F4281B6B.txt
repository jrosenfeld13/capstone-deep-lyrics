She is deafeningly pretty, echoes are everywhere
So I drink to gain her pity, but she don't care
I love you Lilly but you're never alone
Never alone
In my dreams I fail to see why you cannot come home with me (I)
Way lay, scheme and play
Oh, I could touch you, but you'd shimmy away
I love you Lilly but you're never alone
I love you Lilly but you're never alone
I love you Lilly but you're never alone
I love you Lilly but you're never alone
Anyway, any day, anyway, what if I wait forever?
(Cos') In my dreams we make a scene to end all scenes with lust supreme (but)
Way lay, scheme and play
(It's) traces of you that trouble my view tonight
I love you Lilly but you're never alone
I love you Lilly but you're never alone
