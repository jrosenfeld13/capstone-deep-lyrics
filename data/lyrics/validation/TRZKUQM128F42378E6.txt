(written by Shelby Lynne and Bill Botrell)

Your lies won't leave me alone
You used to say you loved me did ya
Why'd you do me this way
It didn't have to be that way

I got your message on the phone
I hung on every single line
You told me what we had was only business
Hurt me so bad I had to sit down with the sickness
Oh yeah

Your lies won't leave me alone
Tore the phone out the wall and it's still ringin'
Wreck the room and curtains ain't hangin' baby
Guitar ain't playin'

Your lies won't leave me alone
Look at your picture in the room I can see you were
Never happy with me baby-
All my uncertainty is easy to see
How you're killin' me, cause

I got those bills you would not pay
The cost of our love is way too high and I just keep on
Payin' baby
Why'd you say you loved me - walk around and carry on
Hurting 'bout your love is gone, the song I sing is sad
And long, wonder if you are alone
I don't know if I belong

Your lies won't leave me - alone
