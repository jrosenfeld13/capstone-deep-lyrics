I pray thee, I pray thee
Ki-Mani marley alongside his one and only little brother, yours truley

Were living a battle, and God is on our side
Were not afraid of losing, (not me)
So were not afraid to fight
Were fighting for our freedom
Were dying for our rights, yeah
Still in my darkest hour, oh dread
I found paradise

[Chorus]
So where is the justice (somebody tell me now)
Where is the peace you talk about
Still living in darkness, (somebody tell me now)
Tell me where are the keepers of the light
The light, the light, where are the keepers of the light
The light, the light, where are the keepers of the light

[Verse 2]
Trapped in this dark place, wish a light would shine on me
Trying to keep my faith, the one thing they cant take from me
Where are the believers who believe in life
That would risk it all just to do whats right
To fight the good fight, here we go again
Children of the light on you we all depend
And we can make it work for we know what its worth
Why dont you stop the wars from all over this earth

So where is the justice (somebody tell me now)
Where is the peace you talk about
Still living in darkness, (somebody tell me now)
Tell me where are the keepers of the light

[Damien's Verse]
Can you imagine how the place get bright
If all of the keepers of the light got together like Christ
For once people might think twice, and we can live One Love inna real life
Imagine if man live like Christ, or Buddha or Mohammed all the place would nice
And not by force by choice, equal rights and love

We are the keepers, we are the keepers, we are the keepers of the light
We are the keepers, we are the keepers, we are the keepers of the light

[Chorus]
So where is the justice (somebody tell me now)
Where is the peace you talk about
Still living in darkness, (wont somebody tell me now)
Tell me where are the keepers of the light
The light, the light, where are the keepers of the light
The light, the light, where are the keepers of the light

(somebody tell me now)
(somebody tell me now)
