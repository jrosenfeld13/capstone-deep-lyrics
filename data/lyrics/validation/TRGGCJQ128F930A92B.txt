It's been way too long since I spoke my confession
My heart has a burden I hope you will listen
Oh you're my sanctuary
Despite the road we've chosen to the wilderness I roamed
But there I found no shelter like a prodigal son I've come back home
To my sanctuary
Well I believe you're the faith when there's a shadow of doubt
You're the prayer that mother's whisper each night for their sons everywhere
And your love is the gift that you give when you let me in
You're my sanctuary

I'm standin' out here knockin' knockin' at your door
I miss our sweet communion loves mercy's brought me back for more
Oh you're such a mystery how you make my spirit soar you're my sanctuary
Well I believe you're the faith...

Well I believe you're the faith...
