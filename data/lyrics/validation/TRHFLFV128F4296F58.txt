Heeey!
Fly away... yeah!
I've got to get away
Take a whiff and fly away
From all this madness in my life

I've got to get away
Light up my chalice and get on my way
To a place that is free
From all the fuss and strife

I've got to get away
Take a whiff and fly away
From all this madness in my life

I've got to get away
Light it up and take a flight away
To a place that is free
From all the fuss and strife

Just can't take no more
Of this life that we're living
So much hatred, war and sin
Get so rough
At times it seems you can never win
But im not about to give in

So i
I've got to get away
Take a whiff and fly away
From all this madness in my life

I've got to get away
Light up my chalice and get on my way
To a place that is free
From all the fuss and strife

I've got to get away
Take a whiff and fly away
From all this madness in my life

I've got to get away
Crank it up and take a flight away
To a place that is free
From all the fuss and strife

Yaaay
Fly away, fly
Leave ___ to babylon yaaay

Its so hard to live among these haters
They're fighting everything i do
But with the help of Jah i'm going through
Oh, i'm only a human
And i'm liable to do wrong
So i have to hold the meditation
To keep me going in the right direction

I've got to get away
Take a whiff and fly away
From all this madness in my life

I've got to get away
Light it up and take a flight away
To a place that is free
From all the fuss and strife

I've got to get away
Take a whiff and fly away
From all this madness in my life

I've got to get away
Crank it up and take a flight away
To a place that is free
From all the fuss and strife

Fly away yay...
