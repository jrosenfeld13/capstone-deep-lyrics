I, I lost my head when I came up
To catch my breath and
Oh, I know
There's a box beneath my bed

With all you said
I felt it too, did you feel it too
This feelings that you find, all mine
And I know there's a star and its something in the sky

Tonight I must confess
I loved you best when you were here the most
I know, it's all inside my head
It's in my head, it's in my head

Oh!
I'm so tired of the lonely places that you go
Oh!
And I'm so sick to death to the faces that I still know
And I keep on thinking to myself
Hey now will it all go wrong
Cause you know dear
When happier endings and more

I, I must confess
I loved you best when you were here the most
I know, it's all inside my head

With things you said
I felt it too, did you feel it too
This feelings that you find
All mine
And I know they are in my head
It's in my head
It's in my head

Oh!
I'm so tired of the lonely places that you go
Oh!
And I'm so sick to death to the faces that I still know
And I keep on thinking to myself
Hey now will it all go wrong
Cause you know dear
When happier endings and more

And I know
What I'll find
Somewhere in your heart
This time
And I fear
What I'll find
Somewhere in your heart
Each time
I'm afraid what I'll find
Somewhere in your heart
This time

I, I lost my head when I came up
To catch my breath and
Oh, I know
There's a box beneath my bed

With all you said
I felt it too, did you feel it too
This feelings that you find, all mine
And I know there's a star and its something in the sky
