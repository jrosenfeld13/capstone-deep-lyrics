I want a little sugar in my bowl
I want a little sweetness down in my soul
I could stand some lovin', oh so bad
I feel so funny, I feel so sad

I want a little steam on my clothes
Maybe I can fix things up so they'll go
What's the matter Daddy? Come on, save my soul
I need some sugar in my bowl, I ain't foolin'
I want some sugar in my bowl

You been acting different
I've been told
Soothe me
I want some sugar in my bowl

I want some steam on my clothes
Maybe I can fix things up so they'll go
What's the matter Daddy? Come on, save my soul
I want some sugar in my bowl, I ain't foolin'
I want some sugar hmm, in my bowl
