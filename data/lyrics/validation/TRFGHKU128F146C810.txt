Aww baby
Ohh baby
Wayne Wonder, for the ladies

What I feel, girl I know it's oh so real
When you're next to me, there's no other place I'd rather be
She close my mind, she knows just how to set me free
She makes my find complete

Always satisfy my every need
Girl, you're good to go, follow my lead
Like an open book, it is there to read
You truly make my life complete

Glad you came, glad you came my way
Came my way with your love
Swept away, girl I'm swept away
Swept away in your love

She's my friend and my lover till the end
Can't pretend, she's got a love with a perfect plan
Telling you again, what the doctor recommends
For you my love extends

Always satisfy my every need
Girl, you're good to go, follow my lead
Like an open book, it is there to read
You truly make my life complete

Glad you came, glad you came my way
Came my way with your love
Swept away, girl I'm swept away
Swept away in your love

Girl, I've got no doubts about it
The day you came into my life
No regrets, there's no excuses
No doubts about it, no doubts about it

Glad you came, glad you came my way
Came my way with your love
Swept away, girl I'm swept away
Swept away in your love

Glad you came, glad you came my way
Came my way with your love
Swept away, girl I'm swept away
Swept away in your love

Glad you came, glad you came my way
Came my way with your love
Swept away, girl I'm swept away
Swept away in your love
