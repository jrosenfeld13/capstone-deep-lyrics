Dee doodee doom doom.....
Seven little girls
Sitting in the backseat
Hugging and a kissing with Fred
I said, why don't one of you
Come and sit beside me
And this is what the seven girls said

(CHORUS)
All together now, one, two, three
Keep your mind on your driving
Keep your hands on the wheel
Keep your snoopy eyes on the road ahead
We're having fun, sitting in the backseat
Kissing and a hugging with Fred
Dee doodee doom doom.....
Drove through the town
Drove through the country
Showed em how a motor could go
I said, how do you like my
Triple carburetor
And one of them whispered low

(CHORUS)
Dee doodee doom doom.....
Seven little girls
Smooching in the backseat
Every one in love with Fred
I said, you don't need me
I'll get off at my house
And this is what the seven girls said

(CHORUS)
All of them in love with Fred
(Dee doodee doom doom)
Kissing and a hugging with Fred
(Dee doodee doom doom)
Wish that I could be like Fred (doom)
