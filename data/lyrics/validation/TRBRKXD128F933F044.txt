Melodies bring memories
That linger in my heart
Make me think of Georgia
Why did we ever part?

Some sweet day when blossoms fall
And all the world's a song
I'll go back to Georgia '
'Cause that's where I belong

Georgia, Georgia
The whole day through
Just an old sweet song keeps
Georgia on my mind, Georgia on my mind

Georgia, Georgia
A song of you
Comes as sweet and clear as moonlight
Through the pine

Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams, I see
The road leads back to you

Georgia, Georgia
No peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps
Georgia on my mind

Always on my mind though
Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly but
Still in peaceful dreams, I see
The road leads back to you

Georgia, Georgia
(Georgia, Georgia)
No peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps
Georgia on my mind
(Can't forget you, it's true)
Keeps Georgia on my mind
