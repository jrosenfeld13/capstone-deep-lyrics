Good times for a change
See the look I've had could make a good man turn bad
So please please please, let me, let me, let me
Let me get what I want this time

Haven't had a dream in a long time
See the life I've had could make a good man bad
So for one in my life let me get what I want
Lord knows it would be the first time
Lord knows it would be the first time
