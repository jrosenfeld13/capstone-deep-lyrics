22 Miles of hard road
33 Years of tough luck
44 Skulls buried in the ground
Crawling down through the muck
Oh yeah

Johnny don't like the teacher
Johnny don't like the school
One day Johnny is gonna to do somethin'
Show 'em he's nobody's fool
Oh yeah

Sisters Brothers make better lovers
Family Affairs are under the covers
Trailer park of broken hearts
Won't let you leave until you're bleeding

Sally don't like her daddy
Sally don't like her friends
Sally and Johnny are watchin' TV
Waitin' for it to end
Oh yeah

Sisters Brothers make better lovers
Family Affairs are under the covers
Trailer park of broken hearts
Won't let you leave until you
Rock

22 Miles of hard road
33 Years of tough luck
44 Skulls buried in the ground
Crawling down through the muck
Oh yeah
