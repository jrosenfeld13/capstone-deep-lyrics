And the swamp was a desolate, treeless bog
Useless rat hole in the back of beyond
One day came a tractor along came a greed man
To start the draining, to tears the turf out of its bed

Splash, splash, splash  went the bog
Crash, crash, crash  went the rig

Crossing the swamp there was a tuft he had to cross
And beneath the turf mat there was a home of an ugly troll
So woke up the swamplord who was the guardian of the bog
Horror over the man as he heard the sound of a rumbling voice

Whos that mading on my swamp?

Swampwar  the time has come to stop the deprivation
Swampwar  we have to accept instead of domination
Swampwar  the time has come to stop the deprivation
Swampwar  we have to accept instead of domination

Hahaa! Now Im coming to gobble you up!
Snip, snap, snout
This tale is told out

Swampwar  the time has come to stop the oppression
Swampwar  we have to accept instead of domination
Swampwar  the time has come to stop the oppression
Swampwar  we have to accept instead of domination
