I don't know where this began
Don't know how it will end
And another day gone
Face to face with the truth
And another new day
Tell me how does this end

If you welcome me to your world
If you welcome me to your world
I won't throw it all away

If you welcome me to your world
If you welcome me to your world
I won't throw it all away

And if you need me now
I'd do anything, just say
That you need me now
It would me everything

And if you need me now
I'd do anything, just say
That you need me now
It would mean everything

And if you need me now
I'd do anything, just say
That you need me now
It would mean everything

And if you need me now
I'd do anything, just say
That you need me now
It would mean everything

If you welcome me to your world
If you welcome me to your world
I won't throw it all away
