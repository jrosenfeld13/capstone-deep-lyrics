[Verse 1]
Satan rejected my soul
He knows my kind
He won't be dragged down
He's seen my face around
He knows Heaven doesn't seem to be my home
So I must find
Somewhere else to go
So I must find
Somewhere else to go

[Chorus 1]
So, take it - please
It's free
You'll never see
You'll never see
All the fun in life it's cost me

[Verse 2]
Satan rejected my soul
As low as he goes
He never quite goes this low
He's seen my face around
He knows Heaven doesn't seem
To be my home
So I must find
Somewhere else to go
So I must find somewhere else to go

[Chorus 2]
So, take it please
It's really sly
Come on, come on, ah
Come on, come on, come on
Take it please
It's really sly
Come on, come on, ah
Come on, come on, come on
Call me in
Pull me in, call me in
Come on, come on, oh
Come on, come on, come on

[Outro]
Pull me in
Pull me in
Call me in
Come on, come on, ah
Come on, come on, come on
Pull me in
Pull me in
Call me in, haul me in, pull me in
Come on, come on, ah
Come on, come on
La la la la la
Ohuohuoh
