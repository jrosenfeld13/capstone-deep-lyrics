[Verse 1]
You're always dancing down the street
With your suede blue eyes
And every new boy that you meet
He doesn't know the real surprise

[Pre-Chorus]
(Here she comes again)
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky, ohh
She'll make you flip
(Here she comes again)
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky
I kinda like the way she dips

[Chorus]
(And she's my best friend's girl)
(Well, she's my best friend's girl)
Girl
But she used to be mine

[Verse 2]
You've got your nuclear boots
And you drip dry gloves
Oh, when you bite your lip
It's some reaction to love

[Pre-Chorus]
(Here she comes again)
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky, yeah
I'll make you flip
(Here she comes again)
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky
(Here she comes again)
I kinda like the way, like the way she dips

[Chorus]
'Cause she's my (best friend's girl)
Well, she's my (best friend's girl), girl
And she used to be mine
She's so fine

[Breakdown]

[Verse 3]
Always da-dancing down the street
With your suede blue eye-eyes
And every new boy that you meet
He doesn't know the real surprise

[Pre-Chorus]
(Here she comes again)
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky
(Here she comes again)
Ohh, she'll make you flip
(Here she comes again)
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky
(Here she comes again)
I kinda like the way, like the way she dips

[Chorus]
'Cause she's my (best friend's girl)
Well, she's my (best friend's girl)
Earl uh-earl
And she used to be mine
She's so fine

[Outro]
(My best friend's girlfriend)
Oh
(My best friend's girlfriend)
She used to be mine
(My best friend's girlfriend)
Yeah yeah
(My best friend's girlfriend)
Said she used to be mine
(My best friend's girlfriend)
Yeah yeah yeah
(My best friend's girlfriend)
She used to be..mine
(My best friend's girlfriend)
(My best friend's girlfriend)
