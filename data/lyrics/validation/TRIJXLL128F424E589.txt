You must have made up your mind some time ago
The problems you were facing, something I'll never know
You made a choice that put an end to you
I guess it's what you thought you had to do
Made a choice for your own good and now I wonder if I would
Now I'm angry and I'm hurt, you left us all behind
Are you laughing now because we're still in this life?
And I know it's unbelievable, it wasn't time for you to die
We used to share a smile, for me to get through this
It's going to have to take a while
I look up at the sky, and I see a star
I knew that you'd go far and now we reach the end
Now I'm missing you my friend
