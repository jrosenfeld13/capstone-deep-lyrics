By the sweat of his brow is how a mans supposed to earn his pay
But the VIP's and the rich folks of this land
Think manual labor ain't nothing but a Mexican
Who swam the Rio Grande

Manual Labor that old back breaker him
Sure knows how to make a fool out of folks like me
It throws your muscle in hustle and it numbs your brain
Then it hauls you off down the tracks like a run away train

Oh, manual labor you, you old back breaker, you
I must have mistaken you for a true blue friend you've never been
My youth and my good time spent, don't know where my money went

I like how the government got more than their share, oh well, who cares?
I'm a-gettin' on a holy road, send a dollar to a TV show
God knows how the money goes when you're saving a soul, big save-on soul

Oh, manual labor you, you old back breaker, you
I must have mistaken you for a true blue friend you've never been
My youth and my good time spent, don't know where my money went

I like how the government got more than their share, oh well, who cares?
I'm a-gettin' on a holy road, send a dollar to a TV show
God knows how the money goes when you're saving a soul, big save-on soul
