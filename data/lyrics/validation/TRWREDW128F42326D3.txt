After this charade
She's just relocated life
In a simple way
She is complicated

I'll die gladly
She's no longer around
I'll crash her dream vacation
Heaven bound

I'll do anything for love

In my endless quest
Through the floozies and the tarts
An angel in decent
Holly gently crushed my heart

I'll go lightly
She's no longer around
I'll crash her dream vacation
Heaven bound

I'll do anything for love
I'll do anything for love
I'll do anything for
Goodbye
Goodbye

After this charade
She's just relocated life
In a simple way
She is complicated

I'll die gladly
She's no longer around
A pleasure dream vacation heaven bound

I'll do anything for love
I'll do anything for love
I'll do anything for love
I'll do anything for love
I'll do anything for
I'll do anything for
I'll do anything for love
