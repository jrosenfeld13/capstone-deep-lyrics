Don't hold your breath for a new revolution
The future is wasted on petty fraud
A grade A average with perfect skin
Fight for a freedom of choose - between shit and more shit

Truth - To what use?
Trust - To whom?
Within these confinements, a word will spread like fire

So stand your ground! - Choose your direction!
Who will decide?
Facing the facts - They lie!
Who will decide?
These are the victims - These are the crimes!
Who will decide?
If you give up the fight...
Who will decide?

Exploit!
Suck out the marrow - Suck out the bones
Drain it! - A negative image
Roots upturned - A palace of mirrors

So stand your ground! - Choose your direction!
Who will decide?
Facing the facts - They lie!
Who will decide?
These are the victims - These are the crimes!
Who will decide?
If you give up the fight...
Who will decide?

Social movement my ass!
Most of us can barely read and the rest all believe
In the gospel of corporate truth
Skewered and screened infotainment to uphold
And magnify the frail myth of modern democracy
We all know the construction and why it prevails...

So stand your ground! - Choose your direction!
Who will decide?
Facing the facts - They lie!
Who will decide?
These are the victims - These are the crimes!
Who will decide?
If you give up the fight...
Who will decide?
