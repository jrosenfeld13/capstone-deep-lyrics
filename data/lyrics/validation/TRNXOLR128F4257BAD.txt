Cause I can't find pleasure anywhere,this life is strangling
Me if I would turn myself inside out would I find peace of
Mind,would I find peace of mind?
And when the silence remains
And all the fields stays the same
It isn't different from the power that it holds
Now, where is the pain?
As I gaze between my desires
There's a shadow and a bleeder every once in a while
Can't you see my eyes they're trembling
Beware the millions of senses locked in this rusty cage, a fanatic rage this time I will stand still and no blood will be spilled

Yeah,I think I'm losing it
Yeah,I think I'm losing it, -
Back to normal a feast on the moral,served on a silver plate...

Yeah,I think I'm losing it
Yeah,I think I'm losing it, -
Back to normal a feast on the moral,served on a silver plate...

Yeah,I think I'm losing it
Yeah,I think I'm losing it, -
Back to normal a feast on the moral,served on a silver plate...

Yeah,I think I'm losing it
Yeah,I think I'm losing it, -
Back to normal a feast on the moral,served on a silver plate...

And when the silence remains
And all the fields stays the same
It isn't different from the power that it holds
Now, where is my pain?
A big hail to my sadistic pleasures
They saved my soul for a special price
As I begin to fade, the creature cries
So I'm heading for another one that will watch me raise my bloodstained banner
No questions asked
No question asked

Yeah,I think I'm losing it
Yeah,I think I'm losing it, -
Back to normal a feast on the moral,served on a silver plate...

A competition that will last until the silent one will speak
So this is it,is this the century sun?
Mother of destruction, please let me be the one to know
Father of my pure aggression, don't cut the way where I will go
