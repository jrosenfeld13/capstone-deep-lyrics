Every time you walk in the room
I feel my heart pump, pounding for you

Is this for real?
Each time I feel hungry for your spotlights

Sweat drips, ready on cue
I assume my place in your view
For this is clear
The big scene is near
I'm ready for my close-up with you

Oh, the way you move in my dreams
You bring real life into the scene
Was black and white, now so alive
Caught up in the action

Take two, ready, begin
Ecstasy once again
Let's take it slow
Know where to go
Give me what you're so good for

We'll soon be stars [3x]

Shooting at the speed of nights
My mind tells me no
But my heart tells it's right
I will be yours
Forever the course
Come and join the passion game
Riding on the fuel of desire
Burning up, I know I'll set the stage on fire
I close in on you
My vision is true

You and me will be stars

Shooting at the speed of nights
My mind tells me no
But my heart tells it's right
I will be yours
Forever the course
Come and join the passion game

Shooting at the speed of nights
My mind tells me no
But my heart tells it's right
I will be yours
Forever the course
You and me will be stars

We'll soon be stars [3x]
