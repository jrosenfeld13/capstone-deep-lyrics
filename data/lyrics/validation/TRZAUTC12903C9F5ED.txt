Could I've been
Something more than what I've become
Really wonderful than some

Then today I heard a sad sad song I sang
And it was wonderful with pain
And I stop believing and I started thinking
It could be my mind
That's got me all choked up inside
With thoughts of all those fears I hide
And I stop thinking how I start believing

We could share our time that means nothing
If you aren't mine
And I knew you cared about me
Because people love to be loved too

I step aside and watch my life pass me by
You were supposed to be my wife
And stop believing, then I start thinking
And now I find that this thorn stuck in my side
Is all that's left of foolish pride
And I stop thinking now I start believing
