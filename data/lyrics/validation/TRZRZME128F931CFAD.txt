I heard you're a drunk
And you never shut up
The word on the street
Is that your sweet ass
Is totally fucked

And I know you don't sleep
Because you're too scared to dream
Or maybe it's just that waking up
Is harder than it seems

But if I loved you hard enough
Could you shake off that black coal dust
And shine for me?
Come on, diamond
Shine for me

Yeah, if I loved you hard enough
Could you shake off that black coal dust
And shine like a diamond?
Shine like gold
Instead of sucking those cigarettes
Through that hole in your throat
Let me bleed your busted lip
Taste all the lies
While I'm sweeping the ashes
From your burned-out eyes
Come on now
I just want to see them shine
