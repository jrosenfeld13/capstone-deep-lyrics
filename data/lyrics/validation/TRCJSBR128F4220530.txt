Here I am
My fingers touching an ivory piano key
Once the tusk of an elephant
Now in a suburban city

I know what I want
But every day mainstreamity
Is confusing me
The main picture's no longer clear

Notes & bills & tasks & skills are confusing me
So useless things and the
Notes & bills & tasks & skills are puzzeling me
So useless things in charge

Days go by
We stare ourselves blind on cars and dimes
Work hard and well
It's hard to tell where our courage fell

But those who can see
A wider screen than 17
So very rare
They dare to care for the warmth unseen

Notes & bills & tasks & skills are confusing me
So useless things and the
Notes & bills & tasks & skills are puzzeling me
So useless things in charge

On sait ce qu'on veut
Je sais ce que je veux
On sait ce qu'on veut
Je sais ce que je veux

Notes & bills & tasks & skills are confusing me
So useless things and the
Notes & bills & tasks & skills are puzzeling me
So useless things and the
Notes & bills & tasks & skills are confusing me
So useless things and the
Notes & bills & tasks & skills are puzzeling me
So useless things in charge
