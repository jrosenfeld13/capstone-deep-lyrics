Crying to save a world that's dying
I'm crying, so lay the plans if you've got 'em
Never let 'em touch you, no, don't go, I'm lying
Touch me and I'll touch you first, no, now you, now
You're crying to make a change in science
I'm crying, I'll make the chance, I'm running
Fever in the dark, light change if it really goes fast (?)
Came back crashing onto the earth
Fever in the dark, light change if it really goes fast (?)
Came back crashing onto the earth
You're just too high and you can't go up

I witnessed your weakness, we all want
I witnessed your weakness, freedom

Lay the plants in the garden
Never let 'em touch you, no, don't go, I'm lying
Touch me and I'll touch you first, no, now you're crying

Ooh, freedom, yeah
Oh, freedom, so now I'm freedom, I'm freer
I don't mind the freedom
