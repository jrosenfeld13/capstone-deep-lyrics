Hey ho, theres an open casting call for heroes
And all that showed up was Nero
And its all blurry but somehow he was hired

Lay low cause hes gone and pissed himself laughing
Pissed in the wind and said it was raining
Said "dont worry, itll put out the fire"

If I do say so theres a lotta more story to unfold
'Cause itll twist and itll turn till its been told
That the truth is its own supply

I dont wanna talk about what was
Can we please not talk about what is?
Why should we talk about what should be
When we could talk about what could be?

Hey ho, somewhere a dreamer aint so silly after all
Sees a crack where others see only wall
Yeah all my heroes are weirdos
Yeah all my heroes are weirdos
