It's late and I'm feeling so tired
Having trouble sleeping
This constant compromise between thinking and breathing
Could it be I'm suffering because I'll never give in?
Won't say that I'm falling in love
(Please, please,) tell me I don't seem myself
Couldn't I blame something else? (No, don't say it)
Don't say I'm falling in love
Some kind of therapy is all I need
Please, believe me (Please, believe me)
Some instant remedy that can cure me completely
Could it be I'm suffering because I'll never give in?
Won't say that I'm falling in love
(Please, please,) tell me I don't seem myself
Couldn't I blame something else? (No, don't say it)
Don't say I'm falling in love
Ooo
'Cause I've been there before, and it's not enough
So nobody say it (so nobody say it)
Don't even say it (Don't you even say it)
I've got my eyes shut, won't look
Oh no, I'm not in love
Could it be I'm suffering because I'll never give in?
Won't say that I'm falling in love (falling in love)
(Please, please,) tell me I don't seem myself
Couldn't I blame something else? (No, don't say it)
Just don't say I'm falling in love (Don't say that I'm falling in love)
Could it be I'm suffering softly (Don't say that I'm falling in love)
Caught on all what you've been giving me (Don't say that I'm falling in love)
Falling in love (Don't say that I'm falling in love)
Couldn't I blame something else?
(Don't say, don't say)
(Don't say, don't say)
(Don't say that I'm falling in love) Don't say
(Don't say that I'm falling in love)
(Don't say that I'm falling in love) Ooo, oh
(Don't say that I'm falling in love) Yeah
(Don't say that I'm falling in love) Oh
