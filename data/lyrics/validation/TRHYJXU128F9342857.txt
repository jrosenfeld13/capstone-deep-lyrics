Oh, goodbye booze for evermore
My boozing days will soon be o'er
Oh, I had a good time but we couldn't agree
You see what booze has done for me

She swelled my head, she broke my heart
So goodbye booze, we now shall part
Oh, I had a good time but we couldn't agree
You see what booze has done for me

Oh, goodbye booze for evermore
My boozing days will soon be o'er
Yes, I had a good time but we couldn't agree
You see what booze has done for me

She whispered low, how sweet it sounds
Please take another ride on the merry-go-round
Yes, I had a good time but we couldn't agree
You see what booze has done for me

So goodbye booze for evermore
My boozing days will soon be o'er
I had a good time but we couldn't agree
Now see what booze has done for me
