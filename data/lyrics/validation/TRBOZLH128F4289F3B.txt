As I lay thinking of the things that I had seen
Scattered across my weary mind
The sun bursts through there in the corner of the sky
The world lit up before my eyes
Memories come crawling out once hidden deep inside
They make me laugh, they make me tremble with desire;
They fill my head with dust, they fill my heart with lust
You never know what you may find
Oh, no, don't go
Oh, no, don't go
