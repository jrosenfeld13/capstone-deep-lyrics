You reached for me from behind your screen
Making me feel wanted
Building up my hopes and my trust
Making me wait for a chance to hold you
Through lies and pain i wait and wait
To touch your lips and hold your hand, just to run my fingers through your hair
I gave you everything just for you to throw it away
We were nothing but lies
I am a fool to have fallen this far in a grave of dishonesty and heartache
I wish, i wish you never reached for me from behind your screen
