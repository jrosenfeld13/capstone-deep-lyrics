Spanish lady come to me
She lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round
It trembles and explodes

It left a smoking crater of my mind
I like to blow away
But the heat came round and busted me
For smiling on a cloudy day

Coming, coming, coming around (coming around)
Coming around in a circle (coming around)
Coming (coming), coming (coming), coming around (coming around)
Coming around in a circle (coming around)

Escaping through the lily fields
I came across an empty space
It trembled and exploded
Left a bus stop in its place

The bus came by and I got on
That's when it all began
There was cowboy Neal at the wheel
Of a bus to never-ever land

Coming, coming, coming around (coming around)
Coming around in a circle (coming around)
Coming (coming), coming (coming), coming around (coming around)
Coming around in a circle (coming around)
